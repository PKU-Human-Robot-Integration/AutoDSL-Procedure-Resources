    "Part I. Visualization of Xam movement    Preparation of bioluminescent bacteria   Make and transform competent Xam cells [as in Do Amaral et al. (2005)] with an expression vector containing the lux operon genes luxCDABEG from Vibrio fischeri (pLAFR-lux, unpublished, see acknowledgments).   Successful transformants may be screened for luciferase expression using an EnVision microplate reader and the US LUM 96 default protocol before inoculation into cassava.   Grow transformed Xam colonies at 28 °C for 2 days on NYGA plates containing the appropriate antibiotics (Rifampicin 100 µg/ml, Tetracycline 10 µg/ml).   Resuspend Xam in 10 mM MgCl2 at OD600 = 0.6.   Add 100 µl to each well of a 96 well OptiPlate, including negative controls (10 mM MgCl2 alone, untransformed Xam) as well as a positive control (E. coli with pLAFR-lux).   Run the US LUM 96 protocol and read the output for each well. Look for samples with values equal to or greater than the positive control.        Inoculations   Two days prior to the inoculation, streak out the Xam strains to be used from a glycerol stock onto NYGA plates containing the appropriate antibiotics and place at 28 °C for 2 days.   Prepare an inoculum from this plate by suspending the bacteria at OD600 = 0.01 in 1 ml 10 mM MgCl2 (see Note 2).    On the abaxial side of a leaf, create 2-3 close, shallow nicks with the tip of a razor blade, avoiding major veins (Figure 1A).   Use a 1 ml needleless syringe to inoculate the bacterial suspension (OD600 = 0.01) into the leaf via the nicks to a total area of approximately 0.25 cm2. Using a finger on the free hand, push the leaf against the syringe while infiltrating, applying enough pressure to encourage the inoculum to enter the leaf (Figure 1B).",
    "Alternatively, a toothpick dipped in the Xam (pLAFR-lux) inoculum may be used to inoculate by directly puncturing the leaf through the midvein or apoplast, though results may vary more than with apoplast infiltrations.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702190938_2639.jpg Figure 1.

Diagram showing sampled area of inoculated leaf apoplast for growth assay 6 days post inoculation (dpi).      Visualization   After 5-6 days of growth at ambient temperature, the bacteria may be visualized by exposing the leaf directly to x-ray film (Figure 2). For a one-time visualization, leaves may be removed and imaged in a standard film cassette for about 1 h. For continued tracking of bacterial movement in the same leaf, place the plant in a dark room and use binder clips to sandwich the leaf and a sheet of x-ray film between two pieces of cardboard. Keep the leaf elevated using a ring stand with a platform. After 1 h, take off the clips, image the film, and then return the plant to its growth room intact for subsequent imaging.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702190905_9563.jpg Figure 2.

    "Assaying Xam growth and symptom development    Culture growth Grow Xam strains on NYGA plates + antibiotic selection for 40-48 h in a 28 °C incubator.    Preparation of inoculum   Resuspend plated bacteria in 1 ml of 10 mM MgCl2 at approximately OD600 = 1.0 for each strain. Dilute with 10 mM MgCl2 to OD600 = 0.2 for leaf midvein growth assays, OD600 = 0.00005 (first to OD600 = 0.01, then to final OD) for apoplast growth assays, or OD600 = 0.01 for apoplast symptom assays.   Select and label cassava leaves to inoculate (see Note 3). Leaves should be labeled with a marker to indicate the inoculated bacterial strain, timepoint, and replicate number (see Note 4).      Inoculation  Leaf midvein growth assay   Hold the leaf on a piece of Parafilm-covered cardboard, adaxial side up.    Dip the 2 mm diameter Pasteur pipet tip in 10 mM MgCl2 and then use it to punch a clean hole through the midvein approximately 4-5 cm in from the leaf tip. Make sure that a film of 10 mM MgCl2 stays in the hole to prevent air from entering the midvein as this will block uptake of the bacterial suspension (Figure 3A-B).    Immediately pipette a 5 µl drop of OD600 = 0.2 bacterial suspension on the hole (Figure 3C). Move on to the next inoculation point and repeat. Let the drops dry completely without being disturbed. This can take up to 30 min.   When all inoculations are complete and dry, begin tissue extraction for Day 0.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702190925_2691.jpg Figure 3.

    "A cassava leaf with midvein inoculations on the middle 3 leaflets. A 0.6 cm2 disc including the inoculation point is taken at days 0 and 6 (dashed lines).    Leaf apoplast growth and symptom assays   On the abaxial side of a leaf, create 2-3 close, shallow nicks with the tip of a razor blade, avoiding major veins (Figure 1A).   Use a 1 ml needleless syringe to inoculate the bacterial suspension (OD600 = 0.00005 for growth assays and OD600 = 0.01 for symptom assays) into the leaf via the nicks to a total area of approximately 0.25 cm2. To do this, use a finger on the free hand, push the leaf against the syringe while infiltrating, applying enough pressure to encourage the inoculum to enter the leaf (Figure 1B).   For symptom assays, observe each site daily and keep track of the appearance and severity of water soaking symptoms, often observed by 6 days post inoculation (Figure 4).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702190948_8563.jpg Figure 4. Representative examples of Xam water soaking symptoms. ++ indicates high levels of water soaking, + indicates medium water soaking, +/- indicates little or no water soaking.      Tissue extraction for growth assays  Leaf midvein growth assay (see Note 5)   Using a cork borer, take an approximately 0.6 cm2 round leaf punch with the inoculation point exactly in the middle (Figure 3D). Place the punch in a Posi-Click tube containing a 3 mm glass bead and 200 µl 10 mM MgCl2.    Pulverize the tissue using a bead beater (2 min., 36 oscillations/second). Bring each sample to a volume of 1 ml by adding 800 µl 10 mM MgCl2.

Bring each sample to a volume of 1 ml by adding 800 µl 10 mM MgCl2.      Dilutions and plating   Make serial dilutions of the 1 ml sample of pulverized tissue in 10 mM MgCl2 and plate countable colony forming units (CFUs) (Figure 5A).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702191016_7492.jpg Figure 5. Plating and counting Colony Forming Units (CFUs). A. Diagram of plated samples showing serial dilutions. B. Chart showing representative results of an apoplast growth assay [previously published in Cohn et al. (2014)].  Leaf midvein growth assay   Inoculation point (day 0): Make 1 ml 10-2 and 10-4 dilutions in microcentrifuge tubes (see Note 6). Plate fractions of these dilutions to make final dilutions of 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6 (see Note 7).   Inoculation point (day 6): Make 1 ml 10-4 and 10-6 dilutions in microcentrifuge tubes. Plate fractions of these dilutions to make final dilutions of 10-5, 10-6, and 10-7 (see Note 8).    Leaf apoplast growth assay   Inoculation site (day 0): Plate 100 µl of the pulverized tissue sample for a 10-1 dilution.   Inoculation site (day 6): Make 1 ml 10-2 and 10-4 dilutions in microcentrifuge tubes. Plate fractions of these dilutions to make final dilutions of 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6.     Place plates in a 28 °C incubator for 4 days.   Count colonies and correct for dilutions. For example, 5 colonies on the 10-6 dilution plate translates to 5,000,000 CFUs present in the original sample.    Convert to log10 CFUs per portion of leaf sampled and plot (Figure 5B)."
