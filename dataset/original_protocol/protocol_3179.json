Keep tissue at 4°C in the meantime.\nNote: As a general rule of thumb the tissue pieces should be small enough to be taken up by a 25 mL pipette, but try to cut the tissue pieces as small as possible.\nTransfer tumor pieces to a 50 mL Falcon tube and add 10 mL of digestion solution per 100 mg of tumor tissue.\nIncubate in shaker at 100 rpm at 37°C for 16 h overnight.\nNote: Continuous movement of the tumor pieces in the digestion solution improves digestion and the final number of cells obtained.\nTransfer to 15 mL falcon tubes and spin at 1500 × g for 10 min.\nAspirate supernatant, add 1 mL of pre-warmed Trypsin-EDTA and gently pipet up and down for 1 min at 20°C .\nAdd 9 mL of ADDF+++ and spin at 1500 × g for 10 min.\nAspirate supernatant and add 9 μL of DNAse solution.\nVortex for 3–5 min, add 6 mL ADDF+++ and spin at 1500 × g for 10 min.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 mL ADDF+++ (Coat pipette with 2.5% BSA solution by pipetting up and down twice).\nNote: Coating of material with BSA minimizes loss of primary cells, which is specifically critical when dealing with small amounts of tissue.\nFilter solution through a 70 μm cell strainer (2.5% BSA solution coated) into a 50 mL falcon tube (2.5% BSA solution coated), transfer into a 15 mL falcon tube (2.5% BSA solution coated ) and spin at 1500 × g for 10 min.\nAspirate supernatant and suspend cells in 100 μL of PBS (If a large pellet is present 1 mL of PBS can be used).\nNote: keep the cells on ice from this point onwards.\nCount cells:\nTake 10 μL of cell suspension and add 10 μL of trypan blue.\nPipet 10 μL of this mix on a cell counting chamber and count cells with cell counter.\nCalculate the volume of cells needed to obtain 25,000 cells in 18 μL, which will be injected in each mammary gland.\nNote: The single cell suspension will also contain immune- and stromal cells, which are included in the 25,000 cells.\nIntraductal injections of the mammary gland\nTiming: 20–25 min\nTiming: 10 min for setup\nTiming: 10–15 min per mouse\nThis section describes the setup and steps for intraductal injections of the mammary gland. For intraductal injection the mouse needs to be immobilized and anesthetized. The nipple of the mouse should also be clearly visible, which is done by carefully shaving the area surrounding the nipple.\nPrepare the setup in a laminar flow hood as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2949-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

(P) Cage with mice.\nCover the bottom of the cabinet with 3 sterile diapers.\nInstall the camera, screen and small heating pad.\nWipe everything that will be in contact with the mouse or you during surgery with disinfectant (e.g., VirkonS) before introduction into the biohazard cabinet or introduce them sterile: tissues, razor blades, 70% Ethanol, PBS, 15 mL Falcon tube, P20 pipet and tips, 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, anesthesia induction box, waste box, Evans blue (2 mg/mL), samples on ice, syringes, instruments (tweezers, Hamilton syringe) on a tissue right of the surgical area under the camera.\nTurn on heating pad (37°C).\nCritical: It is crucial to use the heating pad on 37°C to keep the mouse on the right body temperature.\nConnect an anesthesia induction box / 5 mL syringe to the isoflurane station.\nNote: 5 mL Syringes without plunger can be used as a head cone for the anesthesia for shaving and the injection.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2.5% isoflurane and 2 L per minute air flow until it falls asleep.\nCarefully shave around the nipples.\nPut the mouse in the isoflurane/5 mL syringe under the camera on a heating pad.\nPrepare droplets of 20 μL (2 μL Evans blue + 18 μL tumor cells) in the lid of an Eppendorf tube and fill the syringe.",
    "Note: First clean the syringe with PBS. Also clean with PBS in between samples.\nCritical: While filling the syringe try to avoid air bubbles, as these can clog the mammary duct, resulting in failure of the injection.\nRemove the cap of dead skin on the nipple with tweezers (not all nipples have this).\nHold the nipple between the tweezers and inject the 20 μL cell suspension in the nipple (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2949-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Success intraductal injection\n(A) Successful intraductal injection.\n(B) Successful intraductal injection as seen under the skin.\n(C) Unsuccessful intraductal injection.\nCritical: It is not necessary to cut the tip of the nipple as described in other protocols.\nCritical: Check whether the injection was successful if the solution disperses in the mammary gland. A blue bulge directly at the place of injection indicates a failed injection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: Depending on the experiment it is possible to inject multiple mammary glands. The preferred mammary glands are the 3rd and 4th glands on both sides.\nNote: The cell suspension should be gradually injected to avoid backflow of the solution.\nMonitor outgrowth. For primary DCIS samples it takes 6–12 months on average for DCIS lesions to form, which can then be processed further.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Video of intraductal injection, related to step 19\n    \n3D whole mount imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the protocol to produce 3D whole mounts of mammary glands to image the entire ductal tree and outgrown lesions. This technique can provide information on characteristics such as extent of growth, invasive potential, 3D morphology, growth location etc.\nSacrifice the animal and carefully dissect out the injected mammary glands.",
    "Note: Continue with step 36 if you want to use the mammary glands for serial transplantation.\nPut the mammary gland in a 12- or 24-well plate.\nNote: If the tissue already contains endogenous expression of fluorophores, keep it protected from light and cover the plate with aluminum foil.\nPerform a mild digestion for 20–30 min at 37°C on a shaker (100 rpm) in 2 mL of mild digestion mix.\nNote: This step is meant to improve antibody penetration and should not alter the structure of the mammary gland, nor degrade antigen on the cell surface. If any signs of alterations in the tissue structure are observed, decrease the incubation time with mild digestion mix to 10–15 min.\nWash the gland three times for 5 min in 2 mL HBSS at 20°C on a shaker (100 rpm).\nPerform a 2-h fixation in 2 mL PLP at 20°C.\nWash the mammary glands twice in 2 mL NH4Cl (0.5 M) for 10 min.\nWash the gland three times for 10 min in 2 mL PBS at 20°C on a shaker.\nAdd 2 mL blocking buffer for 3 h at 20°C on a shaker.\nIncubate with selected primary antibodies diluted in 2 mL blocking buffer overnight (±16 h) at 20°C on a shaker.\nNote: To image primary human lesions and the myoepithelial cell layer as in Hutten et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] the following primary antibodies were used: Ku80 Monoclonal Antibody (Clone C48E7, 1:100) for the human epithelial cells and Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1A4, 1:1000) for the myoepithelial cells.\nWash 3 times for 10 min in 2 mL PBS with 0.2% Tween at 20°C on a shaker.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies in 2 mL blocking buffer for at least 5 h, protected from light at 20°C on a shaker.",
    "Note: The secondary antibodies used with Ku80 and Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin were donkey, anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (Invitrogen, A10042. 1:400) and goat anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A21241, 1:400) respectively.\nWash for 30 min in 2 mL PBS with 0.2% Tween and DAPI (1 μg/mL) at 20°C on a shaker.\nWash 3 times for 20 min in 2 mL PBS with 0.2% Tween at 20°C on a shaker.\nMount the mammary gland between 2 coverslips using a whole-gland mounting device.\nNote: For a detailed description of the whole-gland mounting device, see Hannezo & Scheele.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nImage the tissue using a confocal microscope (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2949-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Whole mount images of DCIS-MIND models\n(A) Overview image showing DCIS lesions spreading in the ductal structures, without disturbing the ductal architecture (replacement growth).\n(B) Example of a DCIS lesion showing expansive growth.\n(C) Example of a DCIS lesion showing hyperbranching.\n(D) Example of a lesion showing invasive growth.\nSerial transplantation of MIND models\nTiming: ∼20 h\nTiming: 3 h (for steps 37–58 after overnight digestion)\nThis section describes the protocol for processing the outgrowth of the primary tissue in the previous section for serial transplantation. As MIND models often only show intraductal growth it is necessary to separate the human tumor cells from the mouse cells before reinjection. Here we describe a negative selection for unlabeled human cells using magnetic bead sorting. For tumors larger than 500 mm3, the following steps are not necessary and only steps 1 to 11 need to be repeated for serial transplantation.\nSacrifice the animal and carefully dissect out the injected mammary glands.\nRepeat step 1 to 11, only suspend cells in 300 μL of cold PBS with 0.5% BSA at step 11.",
    "Add 100 μL of human FcR Blocking Reagent for up to 108 total cells (20 μL of FcR per 60 μL buffer/ 107 cells).\nLabel cells with biotinylated antibodies (Mouse Anti-MHC Class I and II) at a dilution of 1:100 (for 400 μL PBS with 0.5% BSA and FcR add 4 μL antibodies). Incubate for 20 min on ice.\nWash cells by adding 5–10 mL of PBS with 0.5% BSA per 107 cells and centrifuge at 1500 × g for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant completely then repeat wash.\nResuspend pellet in 300 μL PBS with 0.5% BSA and add 100 μL of Anti biotin MicroBeads UltraPure (20 μL of beads per 60 μL buffer).\nMix well and incubate for 20 min in the refrigerator (2–8°C).\nWash cells by adding 5–10 mL of PBS with 0.5% BSA per 107 cells and centrifuge at 1500 × g for 10 min.\nResuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μL of PBS with 0.5% BSA.\nOptional: Save 10 μL for pre-sort flow cytometry.\nPlace LD column in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS Separator.\nPrepare LD column by rinsing with 2 mL of PBS with 0.5% BSA.\nNote: LD Columns are “flow stop” and do not run dry.\nDiscard effluent and change collection tube. The LD Column is now ready for magnetic separation.\nNote: Use column immediately after filling to avoid formation of air bubbles caused by warming up. Do not store columns after filling.\nApply cell suspension from step 44 onto the column. Collect flow-through containing unlabeled human tumor cells.\nWash column with 2 mL of PBS with 0.5% BSA. Collect unlabeled human tumor cells that pass through in the same collection tube as the previous step.\nCritical: Only start performing the washing step when the column reservoir is empty.",
    "Remove column from the separator and place it on a new collection tube.\nPipette 2.5 mL of PBS with 0.5% BSA onto the column. Immediately flush out the magnetically labeled cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the column.\nNote: These cells can be used as an unstained control for flow cytometry analysis.\nSpin down the unlabeled cells from step 48 and 49 and resuspend in 110 μL PBS.\nUse 10 μL for counting as described previously in step 12.\nUse another 10 μL for flow cytometry analysis.\nStore the rest of the cell suspension at 4°C for intraductal injection.\nFlow cytometry analysis to detect human cells\nThis section describes the flow cytometry analysis to determine the number of human tumor cells available for serial transplantation.\nLabel cells from step 52b with 1 μL of human specific EPCAM-e660 antibody (1:100), add 90 μL of cold FACS buffer and incubate for 20 min on ice covered with aluminum foil.\nOptional: Also perform this and the following steps with the 10 μL saved for pre-sort flow cytometry from step 44.\nWash cells by adding 5 mL of cold FACS buffer and centrifuge at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and suspend cells in 500 μL of cold FACS buffer and add 5 μL of DAPI (1:100).\nPerform flow cytometry analysis on these cells, the unstained cells from step 51 (control) and the pre-sort sample (optional).\nCalculate the number of human tumor cells in the sample by combining the percentage of EPCAM positive cells and the number of cells counted in step 52a.\nCalculate the volume of cells needed to obtain 25,000 human cells in 18 μL, which will be used for serial transplantation by intraductal injection in each mammary gland.",
    "Note: At this point it is also possible to freeze down single-cell solution for later use. Only consider this when you have more than 500,000 cells."
