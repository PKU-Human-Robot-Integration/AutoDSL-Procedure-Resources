    "Expression and purification of GST-VCP fusion proteinExpression of GST-fused VCP and GST-fused VCP deletion mutantsTransformation Thaw competent Escherichia coli BL21 star (DE3) cells on ice.Take 50 µl of competent cells in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Add 5 ng (2 µl) of the plasmid DNA to the competent cells. Mix gently by flicking the tube 4 to 5 times to mix the cells and DNA. Do not vortex.Place the mixture on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.Heat shock at 42 °C for 45 s using water bath. Do not mix.Keep on ice for 2 min.Add 500 µl SOC (pre-warmed to 37 °C) to the tube. Mix.Keep the cells at 37 °C for 45-60 min to allow expression of the Ampr gene.Warm the LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin to 37 °C in the plate incubator.Spread 50-100 µl of the cell mixture onto the agar plates.Incubate overnight at 37 °C.Induction and expression of protein Pick up one isolated colony and pre-culture in 5 ml LB medium containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin (15 h at 37 °C, 180 rpm).Make glycerol stock (500 µl broth and 500 µl autoclaved 40% glycerol) for backup and store at -80 °C (for future use if required).Next day add 1 ml of pre culture in 100 ml LB medium containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin and grow at 37 °C 180 rpm until OD is 0.6 (flask should only be filled to 20-30% of their capacity).Check OD initially after 2 h, then after every 1 h.At OD 0.6, cool the flask on ice.Take 1 ml sample before induction. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min. Wash the pellet with 1x PBS and store at -80 °C after snap freezing with liquid nitrogen.",
    "(Use this sample as “before induction run” for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis).For induction, add 0.4 mM IPTG to the flask and allow the bacteria to grow at 20 °C for 15 h at 180 rpm.Take 1 ml of the culture, centrifuge at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min, discard the supernatant, wash remaining cell pellet with 1x PBS, snap freezing with liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C as a sample of “after induction”. Centrifuge the remaining induced bacterial culture at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.Wash the pellet with 10 ml 1x PBS. Centrifuge again at 10,000 x g at 4 °C 15 min. (The cell pellet can be snap frozen and stored at -80 °C if not immediately used).Add 10 ml of cell lysis buffer to the cell pellet.Vortex it to get clear cell suspension.Sonicate using pulse sonicator for 3 min (5 s pulse with 10 s break).Centrifuge again at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min.Use the supernatant for purification.Purification of GST-fused VCP proteinNote: Perform all the steps at 4 °C. Add 500 µl of 50% glutathione Sepharose 4B slurry resin into a column (column size 18 ml). (500 µl of 50% glutathione sepharose slurry will give 250 µl of bed volume.)Thoroughly wash the glutathione Sepharose with 10 ml 1x PBS three times to remove the ethanol storage solution.Load 10 ml of the supernatant from previous Step A1n to the equilibrated glutathione Sepharose column gently. Allow the column to drain (collect the 50 µl sample here for SDS analysis if required).Wash the column thrice with 10 ml 1x PBS.Elute the protein with 0.5 ml elution buffer. Repeat this step 3 times and collect at least 3 elution samples.",
    "Estimate the amount of purified protein using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) reagent and also run the sample on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) to check the purity of the fraction.ATP hydrolysis reaction using purified VCP proteinBefore starting the reaction, thaw the purified and aliquoted VCP protein, Kinase-Glo Plus reagent and ATP on ice. Other reagents, such as buffers, should be allowed to reach room temperature. The amount of purified protein, ATP, and inhibitor used in the reaction may vary and should be standardized upon the requirement.Prepare and label 96-well solid white multi-well plates. Dispense 20 µl of assay buffer (2.5x) to each well carefully using multi-channel pipettes.Add 10 µl of purified VCP protein or elution buffer (blank) of required concentration to each well.Add 10 µl test compound, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or DBeQ (positive control) to each well.Incubate at room temperature for 60 min.Add 10 µl of 0.5 µM ATP to the solution and mix.Incubate at room temperature for 60 min.Measure the remaining amount of ATP after the reaction by adding 10 µl of Kinase-Glo Plus reagent to each well.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. The plate should be kept in a dark room or covered using aluminum foil to protect from the light.Read the luminescence using the micro-plate reader at luminescence mode (1 s).Subtract the obtained values from the value of blank reaction (without ATPase) to calculate the amount of ATP consumed, which indicates the ATPase activity of the reaction (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200120/20200120011048_0323.jpgFigure 1. Effect of NPD8733 on ATPase activity of VCP. A. Purified GST-VCP (Full) and its truncated mutant (S459*; Ser 459 was changed to stop codon) proteins (6 µg each) were analyzed using SDS PAGE and CBB staining. B and C.",
    "ATPase activities of purified Full and S459* proteins were measured in the presence of NPD8733 or N,N'-Dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine (DBeQ) at concentrations shown in the figures. The red dots indicate the individual measurements."
