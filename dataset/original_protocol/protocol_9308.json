    "1. Preparation of solutions and materials for dissection and maintenance of neural stem cell culture\nPrepare 100ml dissection medium (KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12, Invitogen) ahead of time and refrigerate.\nPrepare100 ml culture medium (Stem Pro NSC SFM, Invitrogen) and keep at 37 °C in a water bath.\nPrepare cell-freezing medium (KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12+10%FBS+ 5%DMSO) for long term cryopreservation of cells.\nIf desired, prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for tissue fixation.\nSterile, autoclaved forceps and scalpel blades with handles are used for dissection.\nSet aside a pipette gun, 10 ml transfer pipettes, and 40 μM cell strainer (BD Falcon 352340) for dissociation.\nSet aside several 10 cm culture dishes (BD) for dissection, 50 ml centrifuge tubes (BD) for dissociation, 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes for tissue storage and frozen vials (BD) for freezing cells.\n2.     Isolating human neural stem cells from the human fetal brain\nHarvesting of viable tissue immediately after termination of the fetus is vital to the success of the procedure. For elective procedures, timing to obtain samples can be arranged in advance so as to minimize time after fetal demise. The products of conception are harvested within 2 hours post procedure, but ideally can be achieved on elective procedures within minutes. The fetal tissues often are fragmented. However, in general a significant portion of the brain remains intact for visual identification. Limitations of gestational age (GA) are determined by statutory law but have been performed using this protocol between 18-22 weeks GA.",
    "Fetal brain is placed in a 10 ml Petri dish containing ice-cold KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12 solution.  Identify different parts of the cortex by anatomical landmarks. Boundaries for the frontal and parieto- occipital cortices are oriented by the extrapolated intersection of the central sulcus and sylvian fissure. Dissect tissue from the frontal cortex anterior to the central sulcus and along the border of the sylvian fissure with surgical blades, making sure to keep the ventricle intact and undamaged.\nRemove any residual blood and meninges from the separated block of frontal cortex. If the sample is of sufficient quality, it is ideal to dissect the block into several smaller samples for various purposes: sections (fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PFA) and protein/mRNA assays (fast frozen in -80°C).\nTransfer the selected brain block to a 50 ml centrifuge tube, and add ice-cold KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12 solution at about 3 times of the tissue’s volume. Gently dissociate the tissue by mechanical pipetting with a 10 ml transfer pipette until all the tissues becomes fragmented (generally 20-30 times), and then filter the cells through a 40 μM cell strainer (BD Falcon 352340) to obtain single or near single cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 2000 rpm and room temperature for 5 min, resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml fresh warm culture medium (Stem Pro NSC SFM), and count the cell number with a hemocytometer.\nAdd 5 ml warm culture medium into each 25 cm2 culture flasks, and transfer 2X106 cells to each flask. Cultures are maintained in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 1 week before the analysis.  Change half the medium once a week for further cultures or experiments.\n3. Manipulaton of neural stem cells for further characterization or experimentations",
    "Neurospheres usually form in 1 to 2 weeks under the recommended culture conditions with NSC diameter ranging between 200 and 400 μm. Neurospheres at this stage can be dissociated with 0.2 g/L EDTA in calcium and magnesium free Hanks medium (Hanks) at 37°C for 15 min to obtain single cells. Cells suspension are spun at 2000 rpm, rinsed in fresh Hanks, and replated in warm culture medium for subculture.\nTo initiate differentiation, dissociated cells are plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin 1 coated coverslips at a density of 1X105 cells per coverslip (24mmX24mm). Oligodendrocyte differentiation is achieved by maintaining the cells in KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, Main, MD)+2% B27(50X, Invitrogen, Main, MD)+10ng/ml bFGF+100ng/ml SHH+ 10ng/ml PDGF-AA for 2days, then switching to the same medium without growth factors for another 5 days. Neuronal differentiation is achieved by maintaining cells in KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12 +2% B27 (50X) for 7 days. Astrocyte differentiation is done by culturing cells in KNOCKOUT DMEM/F12 +1%FBS for a week. \nTransfection of neural stem cells with genes can be done with dissociated cells from the preformed neurospheres. Here, we showed the neural stem cells transfected with EGFP-C1 by electroporation. The electroporation of EGFP-C1 construct was done using AMAXA Nucleofector Kits for Mouse Neural Stem Cells (VPG-1004) with AMAXA Nucleofector Device (Lonza AAD-1001), following the company’s instruction. In short, 5 μg DNA with 1 X 106 cells were mixed with 100 μl transfection medium, and after pulse electroporation, the cells were resuspended in the neural stem cells maintaining medium for further culture. The differentiation of transfected cells were processed with the dissociation of neurospheres 3-4 days after the electroporation, following the same procedures described in step 3.2. \n4.     Freezing neural stem cells and subcultures",
    "Dissociated cell suspensions are centrifuged and resuspended in freezing medium with a concentration of 1X107 cells/vial/ml. Slowly freeze the cells in -20°C, -80°C then transfer to liquid nitrogen for long time storage.\nThe cells are fast thawed with 37°C water bath and resuspended in warmed DMEM/F12+10% serum for a wash, centrifuged to remove the freezing medium, and resuspended in the warmed culture medium.\n5. Representative Results: \nNeural stem cells from a normal fetus at 18 weeks gestational age were cultured following the described methods and neurospheres can be seen after one week with round, smooth borders and fairly homogenous size (Fig.2A). These neurospheres can be transfected with EGFP-C1 or other constructs and followed under fluorescence microscopy (Fig.2B,). Established neurospheres were then dissociated with EDTA and plated as dispersed cells on coated coverslips.  Cells differentiated under the respective protocols were fixed with 4% parafamaldehyde, and stained with different cell type specific markers. Multipotentiality is observed with expression of markers indicative of neurons (Fig2C, D, rhodamine) astrocytes (Fig2E, F, rhodamine) and oligodendrocytes (Fig2G, H, rhodamine). The cells not undergone electroporation of EGFP were also differentiated into different cell types and stained with different cell specific markers. Multipotentiality is observed with expression of markers indicative of neurons (Fig3A, B, fluoroscein) astrocytes (Fig3C, rhodamine and Fig3D, fluoroscein) and oligodendrocytes (Fig3E, F, rhodamine).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2681/2681fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Figure 2.   Undifferentiated and differentiated human neural cells propogated in vitro. (A) Neurospheres are shown under phase contrast microscopy demonstrate smooth, round borders and rapid growth after culture for over 1 week.  (B) Introduction of various plasmids and constructs can be achieved through transfection. Three days following EGFP-C1 transfection, multiple cells show expression of the green fluorescent protein as seen under fluoroscein immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. EGFP-C1 transfected neurospheres are dissociated and differentiated under different conditions into neurons (C, D), astrocytes (E, F) and oligodendrocytes (G, H) and seen under rhodamine fluorescence. Concurrently, transfected EGFP positive cells are shown under fluoroscein fluorescence. Transfected cells (white arrow heads) are indistinguishable from untransfected cells (white arrows). The cell nuclei are stained with Hoechst33342. Scale bars are 200 μm for A, 100 μm for B and 25 μm for C-H.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2681/2681fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.  Neurospheres without transfection are dissociated and differentiated under different conditions into neurons (A, B, fluoroscein), astrocytes (C, rhodamine, D, fluoroscein) and oligodendrocytes (E, F, rhodamine).
