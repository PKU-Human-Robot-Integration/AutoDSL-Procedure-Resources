    "The handling of the rats and the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with European, national, and institutional guidelines for animal care.\n1. Acclimatization and Habituation\nNOTE: If rats were not transported, the acclimatization and habituation time can be reduced. For noninvasive identification, color the tail with skin-friendly marker.\nWeek 1: Acclimatization\n\tNOTE: Two sessions should be performed during the first week, one on the day of the arrival and a second one 2 days after arrival.\n\t\nOn the day of arrival of the rats:\n\t\t\nTransfer the rats in pairs of two to their new home cage. Transfer some of the old nesting and bedding material as well as some of their familiar food pellets to facilitate the habituation to the new environment.\nAvoid lifting the rat by its tail. If possible, put one hand under the belly or around the chest and the other hand supporting the hind legs of the rats to lift them (Figure 1)26.\nTwo days after the day of arrival:\nOpen the home cage of the rats and put a hand in the cage. Let the rats sniff and explore the hand. If the rats are trying to get out of the cage, hinder them by gently pressing them back in the cage. Continue with this procedure for the next four minutes.\nIf the rats are afraid and do not start exploring their environment, repeat the procedure once per day until the rats start to explore. In this case, a habituation to the clicker might be necessary.",
    "NOTE: Rats explore new things with all of their senses, so after some time, they will recognize the same experimenter as being familiar. It might happen that the rat does oral explorations of the hands, but it should not be in an invasive manner. If this situation occurs, the hand must be slowly taken away to ensure that the gloves are not destroyed.\nAdd small pieces of the intended food reward to the home cage.\n\t\tNOTE: The food reward must be in accordance with the requirements for laboratory animal nutrition. In this protocol, white chocolate is used (held at the end of a syringe), but other food, such as dry fruits, fresh fruits or cereals, is possible. If the animal facility hygiene requirements demand special conditions, there are various suppliers for treats for laboratory animals. The healthiest option is preferable, but a mix of high fat and high sugar may give the animals a greater motivation to participate.\nWeek 2: Habituation to the scientist and the food reward\nContinue with the habitation to the hand and the food reward started in the previous week. Limit the interaction time to two minutes per day.\nIn cases where the rat is very anxious, habituation to the clicker might be necessary.\n\t\t\nTo evaluate this behavior, click once every five seconds after the session on day 1. If the rat reacts with a fear-related behavior, the clicker must be habituated.\nFor habituation to the clicker, click five times while the rat consumes the reward that is placed in the cage after the session. The habituation to the clicker is completed as soon as the rat no longer shows any fear-related behavior.\nWeek 3: Habituation to intense handling",
    "On days one to three, start with lifting or stroking the rat for several seconds and slowly extend the time (max. two minutes per rat). Stop if the rat shows any aversive signs such as freezing, dodging or hiding.\nOn days four and five, end the handling in tickling, as described in Cloutier et al. (2012).27\n\t\tNOTE: Indicators for a successful habituation are, for example, the rat taking the food reward if it is offered by hand or the rats getting close to the hand, exploring it, or touching it.\n2. Clicker Training\nNOTE: A training session takes four minutes and consists of intervals of 30 seconds of training followed by 15 seconds of break. Remove any added material during the pause. The observer rat is free to do what it wants, and it is allowed to participate and to consume the reward, but the focus is solely on the other rat. All rats were tickled on day one and day five. For the training success, it is crucial that the experimenter pays attention to the animals' behavior and is acting in a calm manner. The training strongly depends on the experimenter's abilities of timing and power of observation. No verbal feedback occurs in the training, and verbal communication with the animals may just occur outside the sessions. An indicator for the learning of the desired behavior is the repetition of the behavior.\nPreparation\nPrepare the required material, such as the reward, the clicker/target stick combination, a timer, a clean cage, the metal tube, and any other specific training material.\nTransfer the home cage to a quiet place.\nRemove all items from the cage. Only the two rats (trained and observer) and the bedding material should remain in the cage.",
    "Training day 1: Establishing a connection between the primary and secondary reinforcer\nPlace a short tunnel in the home cage, preferably one the rat is familiar with.\nWait until the rat sits in the tunnel and then feed the rat with the reward.\n\t\tNOTE: If the rat is not feeding under the circumstances of the training situation, the habituation phase must be extended or adjusted.\nAs soon as the rat shows interest in the reward and is about to start nibbling on the reward, click and then let the rat feed on the reward. To ensure that the pairing of the two reinforces is successful, repeat clicking and then rewarding for 15 seconds. Do this at least twice during this first training session.\nIf the rat did participate, check for signs of the establishment of a connection between the primary and the secondary reinforcer. The main criterion for this classification is the estimation of the food reward, which is shown by the rat by sniffing, looking around and at the hand that presents the food reward or lifting to its hind limbs in order to look for the reward (Figure 2). If this occurs, move on with the next part; otherwise, repeat \"Training day 1\"\nTraining days 2 to 5: Passing through a short tunnel\n\tNOTE: A training session consists of alternating phases of 30 seconds of training and 15 seconds of break for four minutes.\n\t\nPlace a short tunnel of the same material as that of the first used/original tunnel that will link the two cages in the home cage.\nStart the timer and immediately begin with the first 30 seconds of training.",
    "The first time the rat enters the tunnel, present the reward at the end of the tunnel. As soon as the rat enters the tunnel, click and let the rat eat the reward.\nTake away the food reward and wait until the rat shows interest for the tunnel once more. Click as soon as the rat enters the tunnel and present the reward at the end of the tunnel (Figure 3).\nAfter 30 seconds of training, add a 15 second break (remove the tunnel).\nRepeat the 30 seconds of training with a subsequent 15 second break for four minutes.\nIf the rat shows the desired behavior more than four times a minute, stop clicking and just reward with the primary reinforcer.\nStop after four minutes.\nTraining week 2: Touching a target stick\nStart the timer and immediately begin with the first 30 seconds of training. Add a break every 15 seconds and then go on with the training.\nPlace the globe of the target stick near the rat.\nAs soon as the rat shows interest in the globe, click and reward the rat. Repeat this several times.\nIf the rat shows interest in the globe more than four times a minute, the next behavior to reinforce is \"touching the globe with the nose\".\nIf the rat repeats that behavior for more than four times a minute, stop clicking and just reward with the primary reinforcer.\nStop after four minutes.\nTraining week 3 (five days) and week 4 (three days): Changing the cage through a tunnel",
    "NOTE: Here, only passing through the tunnel towards the clean cage is reinforced. The training in week 4 has been shortened to three training days. This time is already sufficient for training success and gives the opportunity for one additional day for evaluation or data recording for further experiments.\n\t\nBuild up a connection between the home cage and a new clean cage by a tunnel by inserting a longer version of the tunnel already familiar to the rat.\nOn day one, perform no training, and just let the rats inspect the tunnel. There is a good chance that they will even transfer to it on their own.\nOn day two, give the rat two minutes to transfer through the tunnel on its own from the dirty to the clean side. If the rat freely transfers through the tunnel, skip to step 2.5.8.\nOtherwise, start the first 30 second training session (alternate between 30 seconds of training and a 15 second break) for four minutes.\nClick and reward the rat as soon as it shows interest in the tunnel.\nGo on to click and reward the entrance into the tunnel.\nGo on to click and reward if the rat goes deeper in the tunnel.\nContinue in a similar manner until the rat runs through the whole tunnel. As soon as the rat starts peeking out at the end of the tunnel into the clean cage, present the globe of the target stick, click, and reward for touching the globe.\nAt last, guide the rat to leave the tunnel. For this process, use the globe of the target stick. Present the globe in front of the tunnel and click and reward the rat as soon as it steps in the new cage and is touching the globe.",
    "Transfer the rat back to the \"dirty\" home cage. Put one hand under the belly or around the chest and the other hand supporting the hind legs of the rats to lift them (Figure 1). Present the globe of the target stick in the center of the clean cage. Click and reward as the rat runs through the tunnel and is touching the target stick (Figure 4).\nIf the rat repeats the behavior for more than four times a minute, stop clicking and just reward with the primary reinforcer.\nStop after four minutes.\nSubscription Required.
