    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBefore employing beta-hCG transgenic mice for the study of cancers related to the post-menopausal stratum, the responsiveness of the individual cancer cell lines to ovarian hormones as well as to beta-hCG must first be assessed. LLC1 tumor cells have been previously established to be responsive to beta-hCG (Singh et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] ).\nMethodological details have been divided into two parts.\nInitially, the work focuses on the in vitro anti-tumor effects of ovarian steroids (Progesterone and Estradiol, with Cholesterol employed as control) on beta-hCG-responsive LLC1 tumor cells; Part 1 describes protocols unique to LLC1 tumor cells that can be utilized for studying the effects of ovarian steroids in vitro.\nOvariectomy in mice induces a physiological state analogous to menopause. Part 2 describes easy-to-perform ovariectomy and tumor cell implantation procedures for use in beta-hCG transgenic mice, optimized to ensure fast recovery and survival.\nPart 1: Protocol to assess responsiveness of LLC1 tumor cells to ovarian steroid hormones\nTiming: 34–58 h\nThis Part describes assays to determine the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of ovarian steroids on LLC1 tumor cells.\nViability assay: MTT.\nSeed 8 × 103 LLC1 tumor cells into 96-well plates for 6 h; after completion of desired treatments with steroids (Progesterone, Estradiol or Cholesterol [0–100 μM]), remove the spent medium from each well; Cholesterol is employed as the negative control.\nAdd 50 μL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT to cells and incubate for 1 h.\nTo attain dissolution of the formazan crystals, add 100 μL DMSO to cells and incubate for 3 h at 37°C. Record the absorbance at 570 nm.\nCritical: Cultures should be maintained in medium containing charcoal-treated FBS for 24 h prior to initiation of these experiments to minimize the effects of steroids that could be present in FBS.",
    "Note: Readings of “blank” wells must be subtracted from all values prior to calculation of percentage viability over untreated cells.\nApoptosis assay: Annexin-V staining by flow cytometry.\nAfter completion of desired treatments with steroids, add 100 μL accutase to LLC1 tumor cells for 6 min to allow gentle detachment of cells.\nCritical: Since this assay measures apoptotic cell death, it is advisable to avoid using trypsin for cell detachment. Unlike trypsin, accutase aids in the gentle detachment of cells and, in this case, was found to prevent additional damage/loss of cell viability.\nAdd 150 μL of serum-free DMEM to each well and centrifuge cells at 100 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nWash the pellet twice with cold PBS and reconstitute in 100 μL Annexin-V binding buffer.\nTransfer the constituents to FACS tubes and add 5 μL PE-conjugated Annexin-V to the samples.\nNote: Tubes can be subjected to gentle pulse vortexing to facilitate thorough mixing and to attain a single-cell suspension.\nIncubate tubes in the dark for 15 min at 25°C, add 500 μL Annexin-V binding buffer and incubate for an additional 15 min.\nAnalyze samples by flow cytometry, employing appropriate gating to avoid debris.\nUse FlowJo software for data analysis to calculate the percentage of Annexin-V-positive cells.\nApoptosis assay: Annexin-V and propidium iodide staining by immunofluorescence microscopy.\nPlace sterile glass coverslips in 24-well plates, seed 2 × 104 LLC1 tumor cells per well and culture for 8 h.\nNote: The cell number indicated is suitable for experiments up to 24 h.\nAfter completion of desired treatments with steroids, wash cells with cold PBS.\nAdd 200 μL Annexin-V binding buffer, containing 7 μL FITC-conjugated Annexin-V and 4 μL propidium iodide (100 μg/mL), to wells.\nIncubate for 15 min in the dark, followed by three washes with cold Annexin-V binding buffer.",
    "Use DPX as mountant, and capture images on a fluorescence microscope with a 10× objective lens.\nPart 2: Protocol for ovariectomy and tumor cell implantation in beta-hCG transgenic mice\nTiming: 50–60 days\nThis Part describes procedures for ovariectomizing beta-hCG transgenic mice, as well as for the implantation of LLC1 tumor cells.\nBeta-hCG transgenic mice should be at most 5–6 months old.\nAnesthetize mice by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine in a ratio of 4:1. The constituents of the anesthetic formulation should be diluted with an equal volume of autoclaved water.\nNote: Determine the volume of the injection (μL) based on body-weight (g); three times the body-weight works best in this model.\nGently press the footpad of the animal to ensure desensitization.\nOn the dorsal side, shave the animal and disinfect the skin with 70% ethanol.\nCritical: Beta-hCG transgenic mice gain weight with age. Thus, avoid performing surgery on the ventral side / near abdominal area as the presence of fat tissue will impair easy access to the ovaries. Essential instruments are depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2608-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Surgical instruments used for performing ovariectomy\nFrom left to right: Cauterizer, surgical clip applier, surgical clip remover.\nMake a single small incision and separate the musculature using curved-tipped scissors.\nCarefully pull each ovarian fat pad out of the incision and gently excise the ovaries.\nClose the surgical cut using 9 mm surgical clips and topically apply povidone-iodine solution 10% w/v.\nCritical: To ensure real-time blood vessel ligation and minimum blood loss, employ electrocauterization.\nAdd ibuprofen and paracetamol suspension (1 mL/100 mL) to the drinking water for 2 days.\nUsing a clip remover, remove surgical clips after 10 days of surgery.\nConfirm the efficacy of the surgery by assessing serum prolactin levels, as described in Sarkar et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "After 14 days of surgery, subcutaneously inject 40,000 LLC1 tumor cells (suspended in serum-free DMEM) on the dorsal side, using a 26G needle.\nNote: Shave the dorsal side of the animal a day before tumor cell implantation; carefully inspect the area to ensure absence of skin allergy or local inflammation due to shaving.\nMeasure the tumors that arise using a digital caliper.\nNote: It typically takes more than 2 weeks for the appearance of a palpable tumor in this model.\nCalculate tumor volumes using the modified ellipsoid formula ½ (Length × Width2); w: smaller value of the two-perpendicular tumor axes."
