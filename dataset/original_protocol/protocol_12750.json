  "procedures": [
    "1. Strain construction and preparation\nGenerate a mutation or a deletion of the gene (yfm, your favorite mutation) using standard site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) as described previously26.\nBefore starting the screen, (optimally) backcross the mutant strains with a wild-type strain to clean the genetic background and generate fresh-born mutant cells as the parental strains. Streak the parental strain to individual colonies on standard rich media plates. Randomly pick eight to sixteen independent colonies (biological replicates) with the desired mutations for the plate reader assay (see 3.1).\n\tNOTE: This protocol is effective only when the parental strains have a growth defect in liquid media (minimal or rich, with or without drug, or with temperature shifts that cause the growth defect). All parental strains should be haploid and thus able to be genetically crossed with other haploid strains with a complementary mating type.\n2. Plate reader assay\nWith a sterile applicator, take a small amount of each of the colonies prepared in step 1.1 (no exact amount necessary to inoculate the starting culture) and place in a 96-well polystyrene microplate. Suspend each of the colonies in 200 µL of appropriate liquid media (rich or minimal, with or without drug). Include a blank well for every row on the plate containing 200 µL of the same media (no cells).\nRun the following protocol on a plate reader detection software connected to an automated microplate-reader: Set a kinetic program for 24 h and temperature at 30 °C, with continuous fast orbital shaking (425 cpm, 3 mm amplitude). Set the optical reads to measure light scatter at a wavelength of 600nm for optical density, and set the light to read from below the plate at a reading frequency of 2 min (721 total reads over a 24-h period per well).",
    "After 24 h, record the final blanked optical density readings (blanked OD600) and use the following formula to determine the volume needed to dilute each of the samples down to O.D. = 0.1:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59133/59133eq1v2.jpg\n\tNOTE: Export the data from the plate reader software and use a spreadsheet software to insert the above formula as a function to batch process the dilution volume to be used from each experimental well.\nEvery 24 h, dilute each of the samples using the same media as day 0 to O.D. = 0.1 (about 1.5 x 106 cells/mL) using the formula indicated in step 2.3. Save all growth curves generated daily and note any individual colony that shows an increased growth rate, judged by a final O.D. that is significantly higher than the rest of the cohort with the same genetic background or by a growth curve that is similar to that of wild-type colonies.\n\tNOTE: This assay usually takes about 7-14 days. Perform all steps under sterile conditions.\n3. Selection of suppressor colonies and confirmation of phenotype.\nFrom the last day of the plate reader assay (step 2.4), save the liquid cultures that have a noticeably recovered growth rate, presumably by gaining a suppressor mutation that can alleviate the phenotype of the parental mutation. Transfer and mix 250 µL liquid culture to a cryotube containing 250 µL of 50% glycerol. Flash freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen and save the strains in -80oC indefinitely.",
    "To confirm that the suppressor mutation is a genetically heritable element, use standard genetic crossing methods to cross yfm P (for parental, the strain used at the beginning of the plate reader assay) with yfm S (for suppressor, the strain saved at the end of the plate reader assay). If the suppressor mutation is indeed a genetically heritable element, yfm P × yfm S should yield tetrads in which two colonies have the sickness phenotype of the parental strain and two colonies have the recovered growth rate of the suppressor strain.\nFrom the cross of step 3.2, pick three colonies with the suppressor phenotype (S strain) and three colonies with the parental phenotype (P strain) from the same genetic cross (3 biological replicates for each), and proceed with the genomic DNA extraction and sequencing steps below.\n\tNOTE: Steps 3.2 and 3.3 are highly recommended, but are not required. Alternatively, one can spread recovered liquid culture collected from 3.1 on rich medium into single colonies, then randomly pick three colonies as biological triplicates for whole-genome sequencing without further genetic confirmation. In this case, three biological triplicates of parental strain should be used for genomic sequencing comparison.\n4. Genomic DNA extraction, library production and sequencing.\nFor DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing, randomly pick three biological replicates per yfm P strain, and three biological replicates of each individually arisen yfm S strains from the genetic crosses (step 3.2) or from the plates that have been spread to obtain single colonies of the S strain (step 3.3 note).",
    "Grow strains in 10 mL cultures in rich media to mid-log phase (O.D. = 0.5–0.8, about 0.75– 1.2 x 107 cells/mL), and use a shaking incubator to grow liquid cultures at 30 °C with continuously shaking at 250 rpm. Collect cells by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 1000 x g.\nSuspend pelleted cells in 400 µL of DNA extraction buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1mM Na2-EDTA), then add 400 µL of glass beads and 400 µL of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Vortex vigorously for 2 min at 4 °C.\nAdd an additional 200 µL of the DNA extraction buffer and mix by inverting several times. Centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C at 20,000 x g.\nTransfer the aqueous phase to a clean tube, add 20 µg of RNase A/T1 mix, and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nAdd an equal volume of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, spin for 5 min at 4 °C at 20,000 x g, then transfer the aqueous phase to a clean tube.\nAdd an equal volume of chloroform, mix by inverting several times, then spin for 5 min at 4 °C at 20,000 x g, then transfer the aqueous phase to a clean tube.\nPrecipitate DNA with two volumes of 100% ethanol plus 10% volume of 3 M NaOAC (pH 4.3) at -20 °C for at least 2 h, then spin for 5 min at 4 °C at 20,000 x g and collect the pellet.\nWash pellet (precipitated DNA) twice with chilled 70% ethanol (Centrifuge at 20,000 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and suspend the pellet in 50 µL of 10 mM Tris Buffer (pH 7.4).",
    "Use a library prep kit (see Table of Materials) per manufacturer's recommendations to prepare the whole-genome sequencing library.\nNOTE: We recommend the kit listed in the Table of Materials because it allows the construction of the genomic library without PCR amplification, which minimizes error mutations generated during PCR amplification. In addition, during the genomic library preparation, do not allow the beads to fully dry by shortening the bead drying time to 1–2 min.\nFor shearing parameters during the library preparation, use a focused sonicator (see Table of Materials) and set the duty factor to 20%, peak power to 175 W, with 200 cycles per burst, and frequency sweeping mode at 5.5oC to 6 °C for 45 s. Alternatively, use a DNA and chomatin shearing system (see Table of Materials) with the following settings: 50% amplitude at 4 °C with pulse mode, 15 s on and 15 s off for 10 min, with a total processing time of 20 min.\nIt is essential to handle the hazardous materials used in this step with care. Consult the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets and institution’s Environmental Health and Safety Office for handling NaOAC, ethanol, 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and chloroform.\nSequence the resulting genomic libraries. The entire sequencing reads should cover at least three times of the entire genome with the resolution at a single nucleotide range. Paired-ended sequencing (or latest technology) is recommended.\n5. Bioinformatics analysis for the identification of the suppressor mutations\nPerform the bioinformatics analysis to focus on the genomic changes that are consistently identified between parental and suppressed yfm strains in all biological replicates.",

    "Compile the variant intersection list files together with the file name appended to each line using the UNIX grep command:\n\tgrep \".\" *.list > all.list\nCross-reference the complete variant list with the current GFF3 annotation file (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Chromosome_Dumps/gff3/schizosacchar omyces_pombe.chr.gff3) using a custom Python script (variant_characterize.py) to identify consistent SNP sites in protein-coding regions (synonymous and non-synonymous), 5′ and 3′ UTRs, and ncRNA.\n\tpython3 variant_characterize.py --list common_variants.list \\\n\t--gff schizosaccharomyces_pombe.chr.gff3 \\\n\t--fasta Schizosaccharomyces_pombe.ASM294v2.30.dna.genome.fa \\\n\t--pattern 000100 --out all.list.filter.000100\n\tRepeat this script modifying the --pattern and the suffix of the output file (--out) using the binary\n\tpatterns: 000010, 000001, 000110, 000011, 000101, and 000111\nCombine the output from all these script runs in a tab-separated file, to be viewed as a spreadsheet. The annotated table of variants includes those that appear in either one or both mutant strain(s) relative to the background. The binary flag field denotes either appearance in a single mutant strain (000100, 000010, 000001), two mutant strains (000011, 000101, 000110), or all three mutant strains (000111).\nAnalyze the output annotated lists of variants not found in the parental samples, but found in one, two, or all three mutant samples. The annotation denotes both the genomic location and class of variant (synonymous/non-synonymous in a coding region, 3'/5' UTR, non-coding, etc.). From this list of candidate mutations, an example of a strongly relevant candidates might be a non-synonymous coding variant appearing consistently in all three strains. Another type of strong candidate would be an accumulation of various non-synonymous or putative regulatory mutations in the mutant strains appearing close together or within the same gene."
