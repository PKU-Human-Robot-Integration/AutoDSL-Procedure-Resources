    "All PET/CT images shown in this manuscript were obtained from participants in National Institutes of Health protocol no. 12-DK-0097 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01568671). All participants provided written informed consent, and all experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n1. Software Installation\nDownload ImageJ from imagej.net or use the link in petctviewer.org to download Fiji.\n\tNote: The 64-bit version of ImageJ is required for sets with over 1000 images.\nDownload and apply the PET/CT Viewer Plug-in to ImageJ following the installation instructions on petctviewer.org. Refer to this website for a comprehensive guide to PET/CT Viewer, and be sure to check for regular updates to the software and the link to general instructions (http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Brown%20fat%20Volume/).\n2. Loading PET/CT Images\nUpload the following three stacks of images into the PET/CT Viewer Plug-in: attenuation corrected PET (CPet), non-attenuation corrected PET (UPet), and attenuation corrected CT (CT). Upload images using one of two methods (Figure 1).\n\t\nMethod 1: Drag-and-drop\n\t\t\nDrag-and-drop from file explorer CT, CPet, and UPet filesets.\nClick “yes” on the three prompts that appear (Open all X images in “folder” as a stack), leaving the checkboxes within the prompts unchecked.\nWhen all three image sets are loaded, go to the ImageJ toolbar, select “plug-ins”, and scroll down the drop-down menu to select “Pet-ct viewer”.\nMethod 2: Read Studies from CD or location on disk:\n\t\t\nAssign a location name to the dataset in the “Setup” tab. Assign a “DICOM path” by clicking “Browse” and navigating to a high-level storage folder containing all image sets.\n\t\t\tNote: DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is a file format commonly used for medical images and the “DICOM path” refers to the set of folders that contains all raw DICOM images.",
    "Return to the “Read” tab where individual scans (from one subject and one date) will become selectable for image processing.\nSelect the subject, press “Read,” and ImageJ will automatically upload all three associated sets and launch the PET/CT viewer.\nLoad a previously made set of ROIs back into the PET/CT viewer by clicking the “load” button on the “Brown fat, ROIs” editor.\n\tNote: ImageJ will only allow an ROI .csv file created from the current set of CT, CPET, and UPET images to be loaded.\n3. Navigating the PET/CT Viewer Plug-in\nWait for the PET/CT viewer to appear after loading as a new window with three separate views of the PET/CT images, presented either individually or fused.\n\t\nClick the “MIP” button at the top left of the PET/CT viewer to replace one of the other two windows with a fused PET/CT view. However, if this button is only clicked once, the MIP will no longer be available.\n\t\tNote: The MIP or maximal intensity projection is a two-dimensional, full body image displaying only the pixels with highest intensity in each axial slice.\nClick the “MIP” button again to bring back the MIP; now views of the fused PET/CT, CT, and MIP should be available.\nSwitch the MIP image orientation with the “>>”, “F”, and “S” buttons at the top of the PET-CT viewer.\nChange the orientation of the PET, CT, and fused PET/CT images to axial, coronal, or sagittal planes using the three buttons to the left of the magnifying glass.\nClick on the magnifying glass on the toolbar at the top of the PET-CT viewer to switch the function of the mouse’s scroll wheel.\n\t\nZoom in on all views (except the MIP) by scrolling with the magnifying glass selected.",
    "Navigate through slices on all views (except the MIP) by scrolling when the magnifying glass is not selected.\n\t\tNote: Clicking on the MIP will also change the PET and CT slices to the anatomical location at the level of the cursor.\nSelect “Edit” at the top left of the toolbar and select “Brown fat, ROIs” from the dropdown menu that appears. A new dialog box will appear. Make sure that the following options are selected before starting quantification:\n\t\nCheck the “Use SUV” and “Use CT” checkboxes.\nSelect one of the three voxel inclusion criteria (“Any”, “Average”, or “All”).\n\t\tNote: “Any” was used in Leitner et al. 201719. For a detailed explanation of other options, refer to petctviewer.org.\nSelect “Interior” to apply the BAT detection algorithm to examine the voxels inside (rather than outside) the area of the ROI.\nInput SUV limits for BAT in the first row of free-text fields of this dialog box.\n\t\nInput an SUV lower limit normalized to the individual’s measured or predicted lean body mass and an upper limit sufficient to accommodate high activity levels19,20.\n\t\tNote: BAT maximal SUVs as high as ~75 g/mL have been reported in previous studies17; thus, 100 g/mL is a reasonable upper limit.\nInput the BAT density range in the second row of free-text fields.\n\tNote: A -300 HU lower limit and -10 HU upper limit were used in Leitner et al. 201719 and a range from -190 to -10 HU was also previously recommended21.\nCheck the checkbox located beneath “Vol*mean” so that all voxels deemed to be BAT will be highlighted in blue while the “brown fat, ROI” window is open.\n\tNote: The SUVmax will appear in red and the adjustable number next to this checkbox dictates the thickness of the highlight.\nDraw the ROIs",
    "Click the “Draw” button in the “brown fat, ROI” dialog box. All clicks made within the PET/CT viewer window will be considered points that make up ROIs.\n\t\t\nClick anywhere within one of the three views to begin drawing an ROI.\n\t\t\tNote: A minimum of three points is required to form an ROI. Double-click after the first or second point to automatically delete the points and leave ROI drawing mode.\nClose and store the ROI by double-clicking after defining more than two points.\nCompiling ROIs to obtain total BAT volume\n\t\nDraw ROIs in the axial plane to obtain total BAT volume.\n\t\tNote: It is easiest to have a maximum of one ROI per axial slice. Including more than one ROI per slice may lead to inadvertent overlap. Voxels identified as BAT in overlapping regions would then be counted more than once toward total BAT volume.\nSet the starting and ending “slice limit” to the same slice, so that the ROI will only apply to the current axial slice (e.g. starting slice = 90 and ending slice = 90).\nCircle one depot of BAT (e.g. in the left supraclavicular region) without completing the ROI. Continue the ROI by extending a connecting line across the body to the distant segment of BAT. Enclose the second BAT depot and double click on the previously identified point at the start of the 2nd region. Adjust ROI points as necessary to further reduce the possibility of false positives.\nLabel the ROI based on the anatomical level for future reference using the text box at the bottom left of the dialog box.\nDeleting unwanted ROIs\n\t\nRemove an unwanted ROI right after completion.\n\t\t\nDouble-click anywhere within the PET/CT viewer to complete the unwanted ROI.",
    "Click the button with the recycling bin icon in the “Brown fat, ROI” dialog box.\nClick “yes” when prompted whether or not the user wishes to remove the current ROI.\nDelete a previously-made ROI.\n\t\t\nSelect the desired ROI using the up or down arrows next to the ROI number.\nClick the recycling button.\n\t\t\tNote: Once the ROI has been deleted, the numbers associated with each ROI greater than the deleted ROI will accordingly shift down in order (e.g. if ROI #2 is deleted, ROI #3 will become #2, and ROI #4 will become #3, and so on). Labeled ROIs make this process easier.\nSaving ROIs\n\t\nClick the “Save” button and provide a file name to save completed ROIs in a .csv file.\n\t\tNote: It is recommended that ROIs be saved in intervals of 10 slices so that progress is not lost. The .csv files can be opened in a text editor or spreadsheet program and contains all relevant data about identified BAT in each ROI including volume, activity, SUVmean, etc. Changing values in a spreadsheet program may alter the file format and make it unreadable in ImageJ.\n4. Quantifying whole-body BAT\nUse these general guidelines to identify BAT in all regions of the body.\n\t\nAvoid sections of bordering tissue with high density or activity contrasts, as minute co-registration issues may introduce false positives.\n\t\tNote: Keep in mind that BAT depots are often symmetrical, a property that will aid in visual BAT identification.\nUse unique anatomical landmarks such as vertebral shape, other bony structures, and the presence of organs to identify the current anatomical region. Avoid region-specific structures known to produce false-positives.\n\t\nIdentify BAT in the cervical region (vertebrae C3-C7).\n\t\t\nNavigate to the axial view at the third cervical vertebra (C3).",
    "Note: C1-C2 regions may also contain BAT, but BAT detection is likely to be confounded by high uptake of FDG in brain and skeletal muscle.\nBegin the ROI on the lateral side of the adipose tissue depot, avoiding neck muscles around the spinous process of the vertebra, and creating a border just posterior to the lower edge of the mandible.\nExclude the thyroid, which may have similar density and activity level as BAT (Figure 2A and 2B).\nIdentify BAT in the dorsocervical region (Vertebrae C5-C7).\n\t\t\nInclude this small, subcutaneous depot of BAT.\n\t\t\tNote: It appears symmetrically within the subcutaneous fat of the back near C5-C7, Figure 2B.\nCarefully include subcutaneous adipose tissue only where metabolic activity occurs.\nIdentify BAT in the supraclavicular region (Vertebrae C7-T3; Anterior to Spine, Posterior to Mediastinum)\n\t\t\nBegin drawing the ROI one side most superficial, close to the highly active BAT region.\n\t\t\tNote: BAT may extend to the area around the head of the humerus.\nAvoid the area directly above the trachea, which contains the thyroid, and enclose the ROI so that false positives near the neck muscles and lungs are excluded.\nIdentify BAT in the axillary region (Vertebrae T3-T7).\n\t\t\nFind axillary BAT as a progression from the supraclavicular region.\nSelect BAT near where the arm begins to separate from the torso, but avoid ribs and the lungs.\n\t\t\tNote: These fat depots will eventually transition to subcutaneous WAT on the midaxillary line.\nIdentify BAT in the mediastinal region (Vertebrae T1-T7; Anterior):\n\t\tNote: BAT may accumulate around the entirety of the sternum for some individuals.\n\t\t\nSelect BAT where the sternum begins to appear at the beginning of T2 near the anterior-most region of the individual’s thoracic cavity, and continue ROIs inferiorly until the end of the xiphoid process.",
    "Identify BAT in the paraspinal region (Vertebrae T1-T12), by drawing ROIs around BAT surrounding the body, not the spinous process, of the vertebra.\n\t\t\nBegin including paraspinal BAT from the appearance of the first rib at the lower edge of C7.\nDo not include areas between ribs, where intercostal muscles are localized.\nIdentify BAT in the abdominal region (Inferior to T12).\n\t\t\nAvoid the ureters, which have a similar density to BAT and very high activity levels. (Figure 2D).\nTrace active fat directly surrounding the kidneys, until metabolic activity is no longer present.\nAdjust abdominal ROIs within this region to exclude the ureters if the SUVmax voxel appears within or near the medial portion of the kidneys.\n5. Quality Assurance\nExamine the MIP for any obvious false positives after ROIs have been drawn on all axial slices measured from the C3 vertebrae to around L3-4.\nEnsure that the red SUVmax voxel is in a region that contains BAT, instead of structures such as the ureters, which display similar density values to BAT and very high SUV values.\nSave the final .csv file when certain that all BAT has been identified and all false-positives have been excluded.\n6. Segmenting BAT into Individual Depots\nNote: The following section is focused only on quantifying regional depots of BAT17. The steps are not necessary to obtain whole body BAT volume and activity.\nGenerate a BAT mask in the “brown fat, ROI” editor (Figure 1).\n\tNote: The mask is defined as a regenerated PET image containing only SUV values for voxels confirmed as BAT within the ROIs created during the previous steps of this protocol. The SUV value for all other voxels is set to 0.",
    "Keep PET/CT Viewer open with all identified BAT or reopen PET/CT Viewer from the “Plug-Ins” drop down menu and load ROIs saved above.\n\t\t\nOpen the three sets of the subject’s scan.\nOpen the “brown fat, ROI” dialog box.\nSelect the “mask” tab and press “Make masked PET”.\nWait for an additional box to pop up, with the filename beginning with “DUP_...”\nClose the PET/CT Viewer, but leave the individual boxes (with the CT and PET scans) open, and then re-open a new PET/CT Viewer window.\nSelect the following three checkboxes in the dialog box that appears: the CT set, UPET set, and the latest CPET set (i.e., the CPET set closest to the bottom of the list) - this is the file containing the mask generated earlier.\nChange the view of the PET/CT images to sagittal and start drawing all ROIs for region-wide analysis start at the same sagittal slice.\n\t\tNote: The MIP image orientation will not change. Also, the most central slice (i.e., along the center of the spine) is a good starting location.\nChange slice limits to range from slice 1 to the last slice in the scan being analyzed.\nUncheck the density (HU) threshold and change the lower limit of the PET (SUV) threshold to 0.01 SUV to exclude any non-BAT voxels, which now have an SUV value of 0. Check the box above the “Draw Next” button.\n\t\t\nLabel regions by typing the desired label (e.g. “cervical”, “supraclavicular”, etc.) into the text field at the bottom left of the “Brown fat, ROI” dialog box.\nDraw and label the cervical ROI (Figure 3a) by beginning at the top of C3 and extending the ROI to C7, drawing a line under the body of C7 before closing the ROI.\nDraw and label the supraclavicular ROI (Figure 3b).",
    "Begin at C7, but do not include the body of the thoracic vertebrae while extending the ROI to T3, then extend the left border of the ROI to the top of the manubrium of the sternum.\nLine the right border of the ROI up with the anterior edge of the body of the thoracic vertebrae included within this region.\nDraw and label the axillary ROI (Figure 3c).\n\t\nBegin at T3, but do not include the body of thoracic vertebrae while extending the ROI to T7, then extend the left border of the ROI short of the body of the sternum.\nLine the right border of the ROI with the anterior edge of the body of the thoracic vertebrae included within this region.\nDraw and label the mediastinal ROI (Figure 3d) by encompassing the entire sternum within a single ROI.\nDraw and label the Paraspinal ROI (Figure 3e) beginning at T1, including all thoracic vertebrae (until T12) within the ROI.\n\t\nLine the left border of the ROI with the anterior edge of the body of the thoracic vertebrae.\n\t\tExtend the right border of the ROI so that all BAT in the region is included.\nDraw and label the Abdominal ROI (Figure 3f) by beginning at the top of L1 and include any BAT that was not accounted for in any of the other previous regions within the abdominal ROI.\nDraw and label the dorsocervical ROI (Figure 3g).\n\t\nInclude the region of dorsal subcutaneous fat near the cervical and top of the paraspinal region; this is where the subject’s body has made contact with the scanning bed.\nCheck “show all” to display the ROIs of all regions to line up all ROIs to prevent overlapping or under-estimation.",
    "Position the perimeter of adjacent ROIs flush with each other, so that no BAT is included in two regions, and that no BAT is missing from all regions.\nObserve the MIP from both the front and side views to check if all slices are being included in the delineated regions. Check the slice limits if there are areas that are not highlighted in blue (Step 6.2.2).\nSave the final data into a new .csv file. This file will contain regional totals or averages for all BAT parameters from each identified depot."
