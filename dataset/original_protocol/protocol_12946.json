    "1. Rearing of D. maculatus\nNOTE: A breeding colony of D. maculatus was set up in the authors' lab using adults and larvae purchased commercially. The species identity was verified using DNA barcoding53.\nTo set up a new cage in the lab, spread a thin layer of wood shavings into a medium-size insect cage (30.5 x 19 x 20.3 cm3). Place a ~ 10 x 6 x 3 cm3 chunk of Styrofoam in the cage to let larvae hide for pupation. Add 20 - 50 beetles (either adults or late instar larvae). Beetles will hide in the wood shavings.\nAdd wet cat food in a Petri dish or a weighing boat. Cover the cage with mesh cloth and place the cage in an incubator.\nFor maintaining a breeding colony in the lab, set the temperature between 25 and 30 °C. D. maculatus grows faster at higher temperatures, but this also promotes the growth of fungus and mites. To maintain a healthy colony, use 25 - 28 °C for regular stock maintenance and 30 °C for rapidly expanding the colony. The life cycle takes approximately three weeks to four months depending on environmental factors50 (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54976/54976fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: D. maculatus Lab Colony. Photograph of a typical D. maculatus insect cage is shown. Wood shavings are spread to let the beetles hide. Cat food is added in a small Petri dish or weighing boat. Styrofoam is placed into the cage as a refuge for final instar larvae to pupate. The cage shown here is 30.5 x 19 x 20.3 cm3 and houses a few hundred larvae, pupae, and adults.

    "Leave eggs in the cage to mature. To expand the colony, establish new cages with eggs (collected as described in Section 2), larvae, or adults, as above. D. maculatus lay eggs throughout the cage, especially near the food source.\nReplace wet cat food about twice a week.\n\tNOTE: Due to the unpleasant odor of wet cat food, alternative food sources were also tested (see Discussion).\n2. Embryo Collection\nTo set up a collection, separate at least 50 males and 50 females from the colony. Young adults are best. Place adults in a mini-sized cage (17.8 x 10.2 x 12.7 cm3) without wood shavings. Add cat food in a weighing boat.\nBefore starting collection, check the cage carefully for any embryos present and remove them. Put a stretched cotton ball into the cage, and leave the cage in a 30 °C incubator. After the appropriate time window, the cotton ball will be ready for embryo collection.\nFold a piece of black construction paper (A4 size) in half to create a crease, and then unfold.\nRemove the stretched cotton ball from the cage. Remove adults from the cotton ball and put them back into the cage.\nWhile pinching the stretched cotton ball very gently, tear it apart slowly into thin cotton filaments to let the eggs fall onto the black paper.\n\tNOTE: D. maculatus embryos are fragile and hard to see in cotton. They can be easily crushed if holding the cotton ball too firmly.\n3. dsRNA Preparation\nDNA Template Preparation for dsRNA Synthesis\nRun 4 - 6 50 µl PCR reactions using primers containing T7 promoter sequences at both 5' ends to amplify DNA template according to manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Purify PCR product using a commercial PCR purification kit, following manufacturer's instructions. The ideal final concentration of DNA template is ≥ 100 ng/µl.\nInjection Buffer Preparation\nPrepare 100 ml of injection buffer (0.1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM KCl). Adjust pH to 6.8 with 5 M NaOH.\nStore aliquots at -20 °C.\ndsRNA Synthesis\nSet up a reaction in a 0.2 ml PCR tube on ice and carry out an in vitro transcription reaction with T7 polymerase, following manufacturer's instructions, using ~ 500 ng template per reaction.\nIncubate the tube at 37 °C overnight.\nDigest the DNA template with DNase, following manufacturer's instructions.\nHeat the tube to 94 °C and hold at 94 °C for 3 min.\nTo anneal the dsRNA, slowly cool the tube by 1 °C/min until it reaches 45 °C after 1 hr.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 3.3.2 through 3.3.5 can be performed in a thermocycler.\nTo ethanol precipitate of dsRNA, add 280 µl of RNase free water to 20 µl of reaction to adjust to a final volume of 300 µl. Add 30 µl of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 650 µl of ethanol. Place tube in -20 °C freezer overnight.\nAfter centrifuging at 15,682 x g for 30 min at 4 °C, wash the dsRNA pellet with 70% ethanol. Dry pellet and dissolve in 20 µl injection buffer.\nMeasure the concentration of the dsRNA using a spectrophotometer at A260. The ideal concentration is 3 - 5 µg/µl. Check the quality by running 5 µl of a 1:25 dilution of dsRNA on a 1% agarose gel at 90 V for 30 min. A single band of expected size will be readily visible.\nStore the dsRNA at -20 °C or colder.",
    "NOTE: For every RNAi knockdown experiment, include a control dsRNA, which would not be expected to impact the process being studied. gfp dsRNA is an excellent control for most experiments. Prepare and inject the control dsRNA side-by-side with the experimental dsRNA.\n4. Assembly of Microinjector and Micromanipulator\nNOTE: See Figure 3.\nConnect nitrogen or other air supply to the pressure input of a pneumatic pump instrument. If a pneumatic pump is not available, apply pressure using a 50 ml syringe connected to fine tubing.\nConnect a foot switch to the remote connector of the pump to control the eject pressure flow.\nAttach a glass capillary holder to the eject pressure port of the pump with tube.\nFix the capillary holder on a micromanipulator close to a dissecting microscope.\n5. Embryonic RNAi\nNOTE: Figure 4 shows a flowchart of D. maculatus embryonic RNAi.\neRNAi Preparation\nPrepare an embryo collecting Petri dish lid (90 mm diameter). Place a piece of black filter paper to cover the inside of the lid. Put a standard microscope slide on the black paper.\nDilute dsRNA to appropriate concentration with injection buffer. Use 2 - 3 µg/µl for initial experiments. Always keep dsRNA on ice prior to injection.\nAdd food coloring at 1:40 dilution to the dsRNA and pipette gently several times to mix well.\nCollecting Embryos for Injection",
    "NOTE: At 25 °C, nuclei in embryos 6 - 8 hr After Egg Laying (AEL) migrate towards the egg periphery53. A cellular blastoderm is established within 8 - 10 hr AEL53. To ensure embryos prior to cellular blastoderm stage are used for injection, 0 - 3 hr AEL embryos are recommended for use53. Embryo collection, preparation, and injection usually take less than 2 hr if the glass capillaries are in good shape. Therefore, the whole process can be completed within 5 hr AEL.\n\t\nCollect embryos as described in steps 2.2-2.5.\nTap the black construction paper to transfer embryos into collecting Petri dish lid.\nStick double-sided tape along the edge of the slide.\nUsing a paint brush, align the embryos on the tape perpendicular to the slide edge with the anterior or posterior end at the edge. Note that the anterior and posterior ends of early embryos are not readily distinguishable, thus on average half will be injected at the posterior end which is ideal.\nLoading the dsRNA into the Glass Capillary\nTake up 2 - 4 µl of dsRNA into a 20 µl microloader pipette tip.\nInsert the tip into a pre-pulled glass capillary (referred to as needle) and gently pipette the dsRNA solution into the capillary. Prepare needles from commercial glass capillaries using a micropipette puller. An example of an ideal pulled needle is shown in Figure 5. The length and taper of needles may need to be optimized after injection trials.\nFix the glass capillary into the glass capillary holder.\nAssemble the capillary holder into the micromanipulator.\nInjecting dsRNA into Embryos\nCarefully transfer the slide with embryos onto the stage of the dissecting microscope.\nMove the slide to bring one embryo to the center of the field and focus microscope.",
    "Position the tip of the capillary with the micromanipulator while looking into the dissecting microscope. Bring the tip close to the end of the first embryo in the row.\nSwitch on the nitrogen or other air supply.\nSet the solenoid input selector switch to vacuum.\nAdjust the eject pressure regulator to 10 - 15 psi. Adjust the pressure depending on the apparatus.\nOpen the capillary if necessary. Once the tip is open, the colored dsRNA solution will fill the tip.\nMove the capillary tip forward to puncture the embryo. If the pressure setting is ideal, no embryonic fluid will flow into the capillary.\nStep on the foot switch to eject dsRNA solution into the embryo until an appropriate amount of solution is ejected. Figure 5 shows examples of embryo morphology after appropriate and inappropriate amounts of solution have been injected.\nKeep the capillary tip inside the embryo for ~ 2 sec, and then remove it.\nMove the capillary to the next embryo and repeat steps 5.4.8 - 5.4.10 until all embryos are injected. Change glass capillary if it gets clogged or breaks.\nPost-injection Recovery and Incubation\nAfter injection, place the slide in a Petri dish.\nAdd a wet cotton ball to the Petri dish. Do not let the cotton ball touch the slide.\nCover the Petri dish and wrap it with sealing film. Label the dish with the name of the dsRNA, concentration, date, time, and number of injected embryos.\nPlace the Petri dish in a 30 °C incubator until the embryos hatch.\n6. Parental RNAi\nIsolating Pupae for pRNAi\nCollect pupae from the colony.\nSort male and female pupae under microscope (see Figure 6). Keep them in two separate Petri dishes in a 30 °C incubator to ensure that no mating occurs prior to injection.",
    "Check every day for eclosed adults. Pupation usually takes 5 - 7 days at 30 °C.\nTransfer eclosed males and females (see Figure 6) to two separate Petri dishes and feed them cat food every other day until they are ready for injection.\nProceed to injection once there are enough females and males at appropriate age. Females 4 to 8 days post-eclosion are best. For a typical analysis, 8 - 12 females are used. An equal number of males are needed for mating54.\nInjecting dsRNA into Female Abdomen\nPrepare dsRNA on ice (5.1.2 and 5.1.3).\nAttach a 32-gauge needle to a 10 µl syringe.\nAnaesthetize females on CO2 stage.\nLoad dsRNA solution into the syringe without taking up any air.\nHold a female ventral side up with one hand and hold the syringe with the other.\nGently penetrate the segmacoria (membrane) between sternites 2 and 3 with the tip of the needle. Figure 7 shows a female during injection. If the needle does not penetrate the tissue easily, angle the needle upward and slowly press down. Insert approximately 2 mm of the needle into the body.\nCheck the syringe scale while slowly pushing the plunger, injecting ~ 2 µl per female.\nAfter injecting, hold the needle still for at least 5 sec before removing it from the female's abdomen.\nTransfer the injected females to a Petri dish (90 mm diameter) and feed with cat food.\nLabel the Petri dish with the dsRNA name, amount injected, date, and number of females.\nPost-injection Recovery and Mating\nIncubate the Petri dish in a 30 °C incubator.\nAfter 24 hr, transfer injected females to a mini cage.\nAdd to the cage an equal number of uninjected young males, and label the cage.\nAdd a weighing boat with cat food into the cage.",
    "Leave the cage in a 30 °C incubator to allow mating. After 24 hr, females should start to lay eggs and embryos can be collected daily or at required time intervals.\n7. Phenotypic Analysis after RNAi\nNOTE: At 30 °C, it takes ~ 55 hr for eggs to hatch50.\neRNAi Viability Analysis\nCalculate hatch rate by comparing the number of hatched larvae to the total number of injected embryos. Be sure to include a negative control injection as embryos may be harmed or killed by the injection procedure. Typical hatch rates vary from 30% - 60%. Beware of hatched larvae eating unhatched eggs.\npRNAi Viability Analysis\n\tNOTE: If female viability is impacted by the gene targeted by RNAi, females injected with specific dsRNA but not negative control dsRNA will begin to die. If egg production or egg laying is impacted, females will exhibit partial or complete sterility. Score female survival compared to negative controls or compare total number of eggs laid by experimental and control females (7.2.3).\n\t\nSet up embryo collection following step 2.2.\nAfter 24 hr, collect embryos following steps 2.4 - 2.5.\nCount the total number of the embryos.\nTransfer the embryos to a 90 mm Petri dish. Label the Petri dish with the gene targeted, collection date, and number of embryos.\nIncubate the embryos in a 30 °C incubator until they hatch. Since hatched larvae feed on unhatched embryos, check the Petri dish frequently and separate hatched larvae from unhatched embryos using forceps (see Discussion).\nCount the number of hatched embryos and calculate the hatch rate.\nExamining Cuticle Defects in Hatched Larvae\nCollect hatched larvae in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nIn a fume hood, add 1 ml of Fixation Solution.",
    "Leave the microcentrifuge tube at 4 °C at least overnight to let the solution penetrate the larval tissue.\nTo visualize, remove as much fixative from the tube as possible.\nRinse larvae at least three times with PBST.\nTransfer larvae to a multi-well glass plate with PBST using a P-1000 pipette tip with the end cut off to widen it.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, stretch larvae using forceps to examine defects. It is critical to stretch out larvae to examine defects as their bodies contract in fixative.\nExamining Cuticle Defects in Unhatched Larvae\n\tNote: This procedure is useful for examination of early embryonic phenotypes, especially for embryos that do not survive to hatching.\n\t\nFor pRNAi, add PBST into the Petri dish (7.2.4) and transfer unhatched embryos to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube using a P-1000 pipette tip with the end cut off. For eRNAi, add PBST into the Petri dish (5.5.4), brush unhatched embryos off the microscope slide and transfer them to a microcentrifuge tube.\nFix the embryos with Fixation Solution and rinse them with PBST for visualization following steps 7.3.2 - 7.3.6.\nUsing forceps, dissect embryos out of the eggshell under a dissecting microscope in PBST.\nTransfer the embryos back to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (~ 200 µl of embryos in each tube).\nRemove as much solution as possible.\nAdd 1 ml of 90% lactic acid/10% EtOH. Leave the centrifuge tube in a 60 °C incubator at least overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Embryos can be left at 60 °C for several days.\nTo mount the embryos, pipette them onto a microscope slide using a P-1000 pipette tip with the end cut off.\nManually position the embryos with forceps to an ideal orientation.\nCover the embryos with a cover-slip and visualize under microscope using DIC.\nExamining Cellular and Molecular Defects",
    "NOTE: This procedure is useful for investigating the underlying causes of cuticle phenotypes or lethality that is not accompanied by cuticle defects.\n\t\nFor pRNAi, separate embryos from cotton balls at appropriate development stage and transfer them into an embryo collecting basket. The collection basket can be the same or similar to that used for Drosophila embryo collections.\n\t\t\nMake the egg basket from a 25 ml plastic scintillation vial with the bottom of the vial removed, and a circle cut out of the lid (roughly 1 cm diameter). Place a circle of super fine mesh about 2.5 cm in diameter inside the lid, and then screw the scintillation vial on and use upside-down.\nAs the mesh can be easily removed once the embryos are washed, immerse the mesh in a microcentrifuge tube with water to recover any embryos sticking to the mesh.\nFor eRNAi, at appropriate stage, add PBST to the Petri dish. Brush the embryos off the microscope slide and transfer them to an embryo collecting basket.\n\t\tNOTE: Fixation, in situ hybridization, antibody staining, and nuclear staining protocols can be found in Xiang et al. 201553.\nSubscription Required.
