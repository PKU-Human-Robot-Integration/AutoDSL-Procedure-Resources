    "1. Surgical Preparation of Animals\n1. Experimental Subjects\nUse mice of the B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-COP4/eYFP)18Gfng/J transgenic line9; JAX strain #7612) or other mice expressing the blue light-sensitive cation channel, Channelrhodopsin-2, in cerebral cortical neurons. Application of blue light to the cerebral cortex of the B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-COP4/eYFP)18Gfng/J transgenic line causes the pyramidal neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 to depolarize and undergo action potentials9,10. As a consequence of pyramidal cell activation, local interneurons are activated, and the change in potential is propagated to neurons beyond the site of stimulation10. Perform surgery under sterile conditions in adherence to applicable regulatory guidelines: autoclave surgical tools and softpacks (surgical field, gauze pads); hot bead sterilize all heat-tolerant implanted metal devices (cannulas, screws and wires) for 30-sec; Disinfect heat-intolerant implantable devices (fiber optic cable, plastic connector) with a 10-sec dip in ethanol; blow ethanol-dipped items dry by application of canned air.\n2. Anesthesia, Stereotaxic Placement and Clearance of Skull\nUse the IMPAC6 Integrated Multi Patient (Vet Equip Inc) system to anesthetize the mouse. Use 5% Isoflurane/95% Oxygen for induction and 3% Isoflurane/97% oxygen for maintenance during surgery. Place the animal on a circulating-water blanket set to 37   C. It is not necessary to monitor body temperature if the blanket is kept at this temperature.\n3. Preparing the Skull for Implantation",
    "Prepare the incision site by shaving all fur from the top of the skull. The shaved area should extend laterally from ear to ear and anterior-posterior from the eyes to the posterior end of the skull. Disinfect the exposed skin with three consecutive swabs of betadine followed by ethanol. Make a medial incision on the top of the skull, from between the eyes to the back of the skull. Clean the skull with hydrogen peroxide and sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). Control bleeding with a cauterizing tool. Locate and mark bregma and lambda for determining stereotaxic coordinates. Stereotaxic coordinates for electrode/optogenetic stimulus configurations that we have used are presented in Table 1 and shown schematically in Figure 1A.\n4. Preparation of the Implantation Sites on Skull\nUse a high speed dental drill with a 0.5 mm ball burr bit to establish each implantation site in the skull. Chamfer the external margin of each hole using a 0.7 mm ball burr bit to facilitate screw insertion.\n5. Insertion and Securing of Cannulas, EMG Leads and EEG Leads\nInsert EEG screws (0.8 mm in length, with 2 cm of uncoated 30-gauge tinned-copper bus wire pre-soldered to screw head) into the holes and drive them in with a slotted hand screwdriver approximately 4-5 revolutions to obtain the desired depth. Hold guide cannulas in place with a stereotaxic cannula holder and then affix them to the skull and anchors with acrylic cement. Each guide cannula should contain a dummy cannula/stylet (Plastics One, part # C312 DC\\1) from the time of surgery to the time of experimentation (10-14 days) to maintain patency.\n6. Closing Surgical Site",
    "Once EEGs and guide cannulas are positioned in the skull, bond them together with dental acrylic cement (Lang Dental - Ortho-Jet cement). After cement sets, position the plastic connector (Pinnacle Technology part # 8402) above the dried cement mound. Solder the ends of the wires emanating from EEG leads to the contacts on the plastic connector. Encase the wire leads in cement. Then draw the EMG wires through the nuchal muscles by sliding them into the barrel of a 21ga needle pierced through muscle. Tie a double surgeon's knot of 5-0 nylon suture around these wires just distal to where they exit the muscle. Suture back together the skin that was retracted to access the muscle tissue with single interrupted surgeon knots, using a reverse cutting P-3 needle and 5-0 nylon suture.\n7. Post-operative Analgesia and Recovery\nAdminister buprenorphine as an analgesic (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) and flunixin meglumine (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) as an anti-inflammatory immediately after surgery, and daily on days 1-2 post-surgery. Allow animals to recover in standard colony housing conditions for at least seven days before experimentation. With no additional care beyond standard colony housing, cannulas can be expected to remain patent for at least two weeks with the indwelling stylets secured in place. EEG and EMG sensors can also be expected to retain functionality for this duration.\n2. Generation of Timed Light Pulses\n1. Programming of MC Stimulus Unit",
    "Connect the MC-Stimulus unit (Multi-Channel Systems) via a USB connection to a desktop computer. Use the spreadsheet-like MC-Stimulus user interface to program the MC Stimulus unit. Enter the desired TTL (transistor-transistor logic) voltage for the on period, the durations of stimulus on and off periods, the number of cycles per second desired, and the total number of repeated cycles for the entire stimulus session. For further details see MC-Stimulus technical manual:\nhttp://www.multichannelsystems.com/sites/multichannelsystems.com/files/documents/manuals/STG4002_Manual.pdf[href=http://www.multichannelsystems.com/sites/multichannelsystems.com/files/documents/manuals/STG4002_Manual.pdf]\n3. Manufacture/Assembly of Fiber Optic Probes for Light Delivery to the Cerebral Cortex\nSupplies and equipment needed are found at: http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/1100/1166-D02.pdf[href=http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/1100/1166-D02.pdf]\nCutting and polishing of fiber optic cables. http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/1100/1166-D02.pdf[href=http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/1100/1166-D02.pdf]\n4. Assembly of Rodent Optogenetic Stimulation System\n1. Interface of MC-Stimulus Unit and Laser\nOnce the MC-Stimulus unit is programmed, run it as a stand-alone signal generator of a 5-Volt binary ON/OFF signal. Connect the MC-Stimulus unit to the TTL enabled power unit of the laser with BNC connectors.\n2. Producing Laser Output via Fiber Optic Cable\nUse the digital display and variable power output dial of the laser power unit to manually adjust the power output of the laser. Connect the laser power unit to the laser via a ribbon cable. Connect the female FC (ferrule connector) fiber adapter of the laser to the male FC connector on the fiber optic patch cable (a 3 m length, 200 μm diameter glass conduction fiber encased in light reflecting acrylate polymer cladding).\n3. Conveying the Laser to the Animal: Rotary Commutator",
    "Connect the originating fiber optic cable (3 m in length) and the delivery fiber optic cable (45 cm in length) to opposing ends of the optic rotary joint encasing two collimating lenses (Doric lenses). The fiber optic rotary joint serves as a commutator: as the animal moves about its cage, the rotary joint rotates to prevent breakage of the fiber optic cables. Use plastic cable ties to affix the commutator to a metal stand placed above the cylindrical cage in which the animal is housed.\n4. Attaching Delivery Fiber Optic Cable to Head\nRestrain the mouse by using one hand to pin the mouse under a cupped palm. Orient the head between the experimenter's middle and index finger. Remove the dummy cannula from the guide cannula placed for the fiber optic cannula. Clear the guide cannula of debris using a sterile 25ga needle. Insert the fiber optic cable by hand and fasten it to the fiber optic guide cannula with a threaded screw cap salvaged from a dummy cannula. Control the depth of insertion of the fiber optic cable in the brain by a suture knot tied on the fiber optic cable at a fixed distance from the flat-cleaved end. The entire experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 1B.\n5. Measurement of EEG-defined Sleep and Lactate Concentration during Optogenetic Stimulation\n1. Precalibration of the Lactate Sensor\nPre-calibration of the lactate sensor is performed with an in vitro kit (Pinnacle Technology part # 7000-K1-T). The sensor is equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), then exposed to three concentrations of L-lactate in stepwise fashion per manufacturer protocols.\n2. Insertion of the Lactate Sensor and EEG Cable",
    "Insert the pre-calibrated sensor into the skull-mounted lactate guide cannula in a manner identical to the fiber optic cable insertion procedure (section 4.4). Connect the lactate sensor to the preamplifier of the Pinnacle 8,400 biosensor with bipolar plug connectors. Attach this preamplifier to the 8-pin connector on the surgically-implanted headmount.\n3. Establishing Optogenetic Stimulus Intensity\nBefore collecting data, use the laser intensity control knob to adjust the intensity of the optogenetic stimulus. The amplitude of the EEG response will vary across animals, due to factors that have not been studied systematically, and must be verified by visual inspection at the onset of stimulation. In practice, an intensity of 80-120 μWatts will typically produce an increase in EEG amplitude of approximately 50% at the frequency of stimulation. Post-hoc fast Fourier transform analysis (see section 5.5) is necessary to quantify the absolute magnitude of the response.\n4. Data Collection\nCollect data using the Pinnacle 8400 system: http://pinnaclet.com/pal-8400.html[href=http://pinnaclet.com/pal-8400.html].\n5. Data Processing with Neuroscore\nClassify sleep states by visual inspection of the EEG and EMG data with the Neuroscore interface (DataSciences, International: http://www.datasci.com/products/software/NeuroScore_CNS_Software.asp[href=http://www.datasci.com/products/software/NeuroScore_CNS_Software.asp]) or the Sirenia interface (Pinnacle Technology: http://www.pinnaclet.com/sirenia.html[href=http://www.pinnaclet.com/sirenia.html]). Process data in ten-second epochs as wake, non-rapid eye movement sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep based on EEG and EMG. Save data as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for additional analysis and statistical testing.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
