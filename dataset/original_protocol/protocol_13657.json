    "The procedures described below were performed as part of a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern Polytechnical University (No. 202101117).\n1. Preoperative preparation (the day before the surgery)\nNOTE: Required solutions: normal saline (0.9% w/v sodium chloride), heparinized saline (1% w/v heparin sodium), catheter lock solution, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as meloxicam solution (2 mg/mL).\nSolution preparation\n\t\nAliquot 200 µL of pre-packaged catheter lock solution in a 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Catheter lock solution is composed of heparinized saline (0.4% v/v heparin sodium) mixed with glycerol (v/v,1:1).\nMix 1 g of heparin sodium in 100 mL of the normal saline to prepare 1% heparinized saline.\nDissolve meloxicam in normal saline to prepare a 2 mg/mL concentration solution for postoperative pain relief.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepared heparinized saline and meloxicam solution are filtered through a 0.22 µm filter. All the solutions are sterilized and stored at 4°C for future use.\nSurgical instruments and materials\n\t\nPack all clean surgical tools in a pouch and tape it with a piece of autoclave sterilization tape. Refer to Figure 1A for the specific surgical instruments used.\nAutoclave the surgical pouch at 121 °C for 30 min for the next day use.\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nPrior to the surgery, house all male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in the standard Animal Room with controlled temperature at 22 ± 1 °C. Feed them with the standard laboratory food and water ad libitum for at least 7 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Both male and female rats can be used for the JVC model, and their typical ages and body weights vary from 9-14 weeks and 294 ± 57 g, respectively.",
    "Anesthetize the rat with 3%-3.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen in a pre-anesthesia chamber. Determine whether the rat becomes unconscious by the lack of response to foot pinch.\nGently take the rat out, place the rat's nose into an anesthetic nosepiece supplying 2%-2.5% isoflurane.\nIn the ventral and dorsal position, remove the fur thoroughly around its right shoulder and posterior areas of neck with depilatory cream and a pet razor. Return the rat to the cage for surgery to be performed on the next day.\n2. Before the surgery on the day\nPrepare the aseptic workstation\n\t\nSpray 75% medical alcohol to disinfect the operation area, and then place the heating pad covered with a clean cushion. Set the LED lamp with a cold light source beside the workstation.\nPre-warm the required solutions (step 1.1) to room temperature.\nFill 0.6 mL of heparinized saline and 0.15 mL of catheter lock solution in two sterile 1.0 mL blunt tipped syringes, respectively. Withdraw 2.5 mL of the normal saline using a sterile 5.0 mL syringe.\nSoak the cotton balls in 75% medical alcohol. Squeeze out excess ethanol before use.\nWeigh and record the rat's body weight.\n3. During the surgery\nSurgical preparation\n\t\nWear the surgical coat, sterile gloves, and facial mask. Then open the sterilized surgical pouch, leave all surgical tools in 75% medical alcohol, and dry them before use.\nJugular vein isolation\n\t​NOTE: The estimated operation time for this part is 10 min.\n\t\nAnesthetize the surgery-ready and shaved rat with 3%-3.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen in an induction chamber and determine whether the rat becomes unconscious by the lack of response to foot pinch.\nPlace the rat's nose into the nosepiece supplied with 2%-2.5% isoflurane to maintain the anesthesia.\nSubcutaneously inject (s.q.) meloxicam solution at a dose of 2 mg/kg.",
    "NOTE: Make sure to select analgesics that do not interact with the drug compound of interest in the pharmacokinetics study.\nUsing adhesive tape, restrain the rat's forearms in their ventral position to each side of the surgical platform.\nGently scrub the surgical area by alternating between cotton balls soaked in 75% medical alcohol and iodine-based scrub for a total of three times.\nCarefully lift the skin near the clavicle on the right side of the midline of the neck with forceps and make an incision towards the chest about 1.5-2.0 cm in length with a pair of surgical scissors.\nBlunt dissect the thin tissue cover with iris scissors to expose the underneath jugular vein. The proximal cephalic end of the external jugular vein consists of two branches, which can be visually identified.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the age and sex of the rat, the soft tissue (e.g., salivary glands, lymphatic nodes, and fatty tissues) covering the jugular vein varies. Compared to the young rats, the old rats are fatter (e.g., BW > 300 g), and thus need more tissue separation before the jugular vein is visible.\nLift the jugular vein along with its connective membranous tissues to visualize the lymph gland attached to the jugular vein. Carefully separate the vein along the vascular direction from surrounding muscle, fat, and other tissues.\nNudge the forceps under the jugular vein without damaging the collateral blood vessels and pass two pieces of 6-0 suture under the vein to mark the two ends of the blood vessel individually.\nPull one piece of the suture as far as possible toward the rat head and ligate the vein cranially with 2-3 knots using forceps.\nPlace the second ligature on the caudal end of the vein with 1 loose knot.\nJugular vein cannulation",
    "NOTE: The estimated operation time for this part is 15 min.\n\t\nOpen the package containing 11 cm polyurethane (PU) catheter (I.D. 0.6 mm x O.D. 0.9 mm, Figure 1B) and attach the catheter to the prepared blunt tipped syringe filled with the heparinized saline.\nSlowly push the heparinized saline into the catheter to avoid air bubbles.\nNudge the non-tip flat side of the forceps under the jugular vein to exit on the other side. Make a small v-shaped cut on the vein near the cranial tie with a pair of castroviejo micro scissors and gently open the incision with the tip of the elbow vessel dilator forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: Rinse the incision with pre-warmed normal saline (37 °C) if a small amount of blood gushes out.\nCut out the oblique opening of the front end of the jugular vein catheter. Clamp the oblique end of the tube with forceps and slide it into the jugular vein.\n\t\tNOTE: This step may need another person to facilitate the catheter sliding.\nWhile advancing the catheter, slowly withdraw the elbow microsurgical forceps and clamp the outer surface of the vessel with forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: If the right blood vessel is selected and the tip of the catheter is successfully slid into the blood vessel, the entire catheter insertion process should not feel any flow resistance.\nStop inserting the catheter upon hitting the first blue mark of the PU tube (Figure 1B), which is approximately 3.0 cm in length.\nSecure the inserted catheter to the vein with both caudal and rostral ligatures using forceps.\nThread a 6-0 suture through the exposed tissue on the right side of the incision using a suture needle (1/2 curved cutting, 12 mm) and tie the ligature with a hemostat.",
    "Bend the catheter at the second blue mark (Figure 1B) to bind with the same ligature (in step 3.3.8) and to avoid occluding the PU-tubing.\nSnip all the extra suture thread and close the catheter by replacing the blunt tipped syringe with a 22 G stainless-steel plug.\nCatheter exteriorization\n\tNOTE: The estimated operation time for this part is 10 min.\n\t\nPlace the rat in the dorsal position and gently clean the area between the scapulae with the cotton ball soaked in 75% medical alcohol.\nMake a very small incision at the center of the dorsal neck with surgical scissors. Through the dorsal incision, guide and gently push the trochar underneath the skin toward the ventral incision on the right side of the neck.\nPut the venous catheter into the trochar and then pull out and guide the venous catheter toward the dorsal incision.\nSecure the exteriorized catheter into the muscle layer in the same way with the suture (see the procedure in steps 3.3.8 and 3.3.9).\nClose the skin layer of ventral and dorsal incisions with the 6-0 nylon suture and suture needle (3/8 curved cutting, 17 mm). Swab all surgical incisions with iodophor.\n\t\tNOTE: The wound-clips is an alternative method to close the skin incision.\nRemove the catheter plug by clasping the catheter with fingertips. Place a new blunt tipped syringe and slowly draw back the syringe to test the blood flow.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the rat is in the supine position, one may not be able to obtain blood samples. Blood samples could be obtained by changing to a side body position.\nHold the catheter again with fingertips and inject 0.2 mL of heparinized saline and 0.1 mL of lock solution into the catheter using the blunt tipped syringe.",
    "Hold the catheter with fingertips and replace the syringe with a stainless-steel plug. Unclamp the catheter and push the plug slightly in to ensure the tightness of the catheter.\n4. Immediate post-surgical care\nRecover the rat in the dorsal decubitus position by caging it individually with fresh corncob bedding. Often, provide a temperature-regulated heating pad to maintain the core body temperature.\n\tNOTE: For animal welfare, leaving food and water on the bedding is an effective way to alleviate the pain caused by neck movements when eating and drinking.\nRecord the end time of the surgery and monitor the rat at 2 h intervals for at least 4 h. Provide additional analgesia for the recovery if the rat shows signs of pain or distress.\n5. Physiological and hematological monitoring during recovery phase\nMonitor the body weight and the food and water intake daily and record the data. \nTo collect a small volume of fresh blood for hematological test, place the rat in a restrainer. Open the plug and insert the syringe into the venous PU catheter to ensure the catheter is not obstructed.\n\tNOTE: The blood collection was performed at the same time daily for 6 consecutive days.\nDiscard the initial withdrawn blood, which contains a mixture of blood, heparinized saline, and catheter lock solution.\nUse a new syringe to collect 150 µL of fresh blood sample and transfer the blood sample to the 0.5 mL tube containing K2EDTA (1.8 mg/mL blood) spray dried on the tube wall.\n\tNOTE: If the catheter is blocked, 0.2 mL of heparinized saline can be injected into the catheter to flush the catheter a few minutes before the next blood collection time.",
    "Inject sterile saline in the same volume to compensate for the withdrawn blood. Inject 150 µL of pre-warmed normal saline (37 °C) and infuse 0.2 mL sterile heparinized normal saline through the catheter.\nInject 100 µL of the lock solution into the catheter to ensure the sealing and sterility of the catheter before the next sample collection.\nAnalyze the blood samples within 2 h of collection using an automated blood cell counter.\n6. Repeated blood sampling for pharmacokinetic studies of oral administered drug\nNOTE: Rats with weight gain >10 g and stable hematological level are suggested to be enrolled for future study. Following the current protocol, the JVC rats required 4 to 6 days to recover.\nAfter 4-6 days of surgery, fast the rat for 12 h with free access to water.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental goal, fasting the animal is optional.\nOrally gavage the fasted rat with natural phenol bioactive ellagic acid at a dose of 6 mg/kg with a straight gavage needle16.\nCollect 200 µL of blood samples in the heparinized tubes via the jugular vein cannula at pre-determined time points over 24 h post-oral administration. The blood collection process follows the procedure in step 5.5.\n\tNOTE: The catheter does not need to be closed with the lock solution until the blood collection is completed.\nImmediately centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min.\nAnalyze the extracted plasma sample by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy17,18.\nSubscription Required.
