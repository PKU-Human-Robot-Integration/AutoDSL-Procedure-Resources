Users should acquire permissions from the relevant institutions. The section below describes the construction of a ts maintenance plasmid for expression of the essential gene of interest, which is Ec trmD here.\nWe describe steps for construction of a pKD46-derived maintenance plasmid for Ec trmD with a ts origin of replication (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).

Construction of the λ Red-compatible pACYC-Ec trmD maintenance plasmid\n(A) To construct the ts maintenance plasmid pKD46-Ec trmD. Start with the commercial pKD46 plasmid (CGSC, #7634), carrying genes for expression of the λ Red recombinase under the control of the PBAD promoter, the araC gene for the arabinose-controlled expression of the repressor under the control of the Pc promoter, the Amp marker, the pSC101 t origin of replication, and the repA101 gene for expression of the ts replication enzyme. A cassette of the plasmid containing regulatable genes is PCR-amplified and ligated with a separately PCR-amplified Ec trmD gene, resulting in the maintenance plasmid pKD46-Ec trmD as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\n(B) To construct the λ Red-compatible maintenance plasmid pACYC-Ec trmD. Start with the commercial pACYCDuet-1 plasmid (Millipore, #71147), carrying the p15a origin of replication that is compatible with the λ Red plasmid carrying a ts origin of replication. Amplify the cassette that contains the p15a origin of replication and ligate the cassette with the Ec trmD-containing cassette amplified from (A). This results in the pACYC-Ec trmD maintenance plasmid as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.",

Therefore, the segment of araC-PC-PBAD-Ec trmD in the ts maintenance plasmid needs to be subcloned into a vector that is compatible with the commercially available λ Red plasmid. The pACYCDuet-1 vector is a good candidate, which has a p15a replication origin and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance marker.\nWe describe steps for construction of a maintenance plasmid for Ec trmD that is compatible with the λ Red plasmid. This involves subcloning of araC-PC-PBAD-Ec trmD to pACYC (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).

    "This section describes the creation of a ts trmD-KO strain by first introducing the ts maintenance plasmid to MG1655, followed by removing the trmD gene from the chromosome via λ Red recombination. Note that λ Red is a homologous-recombination-based technique for genetic engineering7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] as outlined in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. The resulting strain provides the platform for genome-wide screening of suppressors of trmD-KO.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2565-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A general scheme of λ Red recombination\nA Kan marker gene is amplified with flanking sequences that are homologous to the flanking sequences of Ec trmD on the chromosome. This Kan marker gene is introduced to the E. coli chromosome by electroporation in the presence of a λ Red-expression plasmid, which catalyzes homologous recombination to replace the chromosomal trmD with the marker gene. In E. coli and in all bacterial genomes, the trmD gene is in an operon that consists of the rpsP gene (encoding the small ribosomal protein S16), the rimM gene (encoding the assembly factor for the small ribosomal subunit), and the rplS gene (encoding the large ribosomal protein L19).\nDesign primers.\nNote: Two pairs of oligo DNA primers are required: one is to amplify the kanamycin (Kan) marker cassette from pKD4 (CGSC, #7632) for recombination and the other is to confirm knockout of the chromosomal Ec trmD.\nTo amplify the Kan marker for homologous recombination, design primers to be Kan cassette-specific, preceded by a 5′-extension homologous to the target gene Ec trmD and its flanking sequences (underlined).\nRecombination F:\n5′-CCACCGGATAAACGGTAAAAGACGGCGCTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′.\nRecombination R:\n5′-ATCCTGGGTAAACTGATATCTCGGGGGCATGGGAATTAGCCATGGTCCATATG-3′.\nTo confirm knockout of the chromosomal gene, design primers in 100–200 bps upstream and downstream of the Ec trmD ORF.\nEc trmD check F:\n5′-TCGTCGATATGATGGAAACCGGATC-3′.\nEc trmD check R:\n5′-CGGTTACGAATAGCGATAACCACGCC-3′.\nPCR amplification.",

In one, we tag the gene for expression with a 6×His-tag to allow analysis of the gene product from the maintenance plasmid (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). In the second, we tag the gene for expression with an ssrA-degron tag9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] to facilitate rapid degradation to induce the KO state (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4C). The degron tag encodes the sequence for a 5-residue tag YALAA, the critical component of the degron motif AANDENYALAA, targeted by the ClpXP-mediated protein degradation. To apply this, the design of the Ec trmD R primer is modified accordingly.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] In the third, we express the eukaryotic counterpart of the essential gene in the maintenance plasmid, considering that the protein product of a eukaryotic gene in E. coli is usually more prone to rapid degradation. The eukaryotic counterpart of trmD is trm5, which functionally supports E. coli viability in place of trmD.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] We have confirmed that expression of human trm5 (Hs trm5) from the maintenance plasmid generates a protein product that is rapidly degraded, thus inducing the KO state much faster than expression of trmD and even faster than expression of trmD with a degron tag (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2565-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

One is maintained viable by the pACYC-Ec trmD plasmid (left), the second is maintained viable by the pACYC-Ec trmD-deg plasmid (center), and the third is maintained viable by a pACYC-Hs trm5 plasmid (right). Loss of growth is observed in multiple cycles of growth and dilution in the Ara– condition as compared to the Ara+ condition. A culture of each strain grown to saturation in the Ara+ condition was inoculated into an LB medium at 1:100 in the Ara+ and Ara– condition for monitoring growth by OD600. When the OD600 of the Ara+ culture reached 1.0 (as indicated by the ∗), the culture was diluted to OD600 of 0.05, which started the second cycle of growth. With the untagged TrmD, loss of growth was not observed in the first 8 h, whereas with the degron-tagged TrmD, loss of growth was observed. Loss of growth was most pronounced by expression of human Trm5 protein.\n(C) Stability of the maintenance TrmD protein without (left) or with (right) the degron tag. Whole-cell lysates harvested over the time-course shown in (B) were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-TrmD antibody, showing rapid degradation of the degron-tagged TrmD relative to the untagged TrmD.\n(D) Loss of viability over a serial 10-fold dilution of a culture grown to saturation in the Ara– condition as compared to the Ara+ condition.\nGrowth validation.

    "Inoculate the preculture at 1:100 to a fresh LB medium of 2 mL with Kan50 + Cm34. Prepare duplicates and add Ara0.2 to one of the two as a control while no Ara in the other.\nNote: With the addition of Ara0.2 (Ara+) in one culture, the trmD gene in the maintenance plasmid would support viability of the KO strain, whereas without the addition of Ara (Ara−) in the second culture, the trmD gene in the maintenance plasmid would be turned off.\nGrow the two cultures at 37°C and monitor growth by measuring OD600. In this first cycle of growth, there may not be a sufficient difference between the two cultures (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nMeasure OD600 at OD600 around 1.0 (usually 3–4 h) and dilute each culture into a fresh LB medium with Kan50 + Cm34 in Ara+ or Ara− condition, to OD600 around 0.05.\nGrow the two cultures at 37°C and continue the growth and hourly OD600 measurement. In this second cycle of growth, the Ara+ culture may start to show a faster growth than the Ara− culture (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), indicating that the Ara− culture is gradually losing viability.\nIf the growth difference is still small, repeat steps 12d–12e one more time.\nNote: The growth defect in the Ara− condition should be observed earlier and more clearly when the maintenance trmD gene encodes a degron tag (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), which is confirmed by rapid degradation of the degron-tagged trmD protein in immunoblotting (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).

Spot 3 μL of each serial dilution on an LB + Kan50 + Cm34 plate with or without Ara0.2. Incubate the plates for 12–16 h at 37°C.\nNote: Notably, this series of KO strains does not have the ts origin of replication yet, and thus each is grown at 37°C.\nCheck the growth next day. If successful, cells will barely grow on the Ara− plate whereas cell growth will be robust on the Ara+ plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: In general, the KO strain obtained here is not suitable for biological assays, because the strain made by λ Red recombination may harbor off-target genomic mutations that can affect the phenotype. For biological assays, we recommend using P1 transduction, as shown below, to introduce the trmD-KO locus into a well-defined WT strain harboring a ts maintenance plasmid. Successful transductants will be selected by the Kan marker on the genomic locus of interest.\nPreparation of P1 lysate from a donor trmD-KO strain for transduction.\nUse the trmD-KO strain obtained in step 11 as the donor strain.

    "Follow step 10f to analyze the colonies by colony-PCR. Make sure that controls do not generate any colonies.\nNote: The observation of PCR bands from both WT chromosome and the KO chromosome indicates that the colony is heterogeneous.\nIf the chromosomal KO is confirmed, streak the colony on an LB + Amp100 + Kan50 + Ara0.2 plate and grow it at 30°C for 14–18 h. Pick up and grow a single colony in LB + Amp100 + Kan50 + Ara0.2 at 30°C.\nValidate growth by following step 12 but replacing Cm34 with Amp100 for the pKD46-Ec trmD maintenance plasmid. Maintain all cultures at 30°C.\nNote: Make a freezer stock of this purified KO clone and use it for suppressor screen.\nNote: The growth rate at 30°C is generally slow, indicating that depletion of the maintenance protein would be slow. Thus, it may take a longer time to observe a reduced growth phenotype. In this case, the growth test can be done at 43°C, omitting Amp, to accelerate loss of the maintenance plasmid. This is essentially the procedure of isolation of suppressors as shown in step 15 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2565-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Phenotype analysis of the E. coli trmD-KO strain expressing Ec trmD from the ts pKD46-Ec trmD maintenance plasmid\n(A) Comparing growth of trmD-WT and trmD-KO strains. Each harboring plasmid pKD46-Ec trmD was grown in LB without Ara, in cycles of growth and dilution as in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, at non-permissive temperature 43°C. The trmD-KO strain exhibited reduced growth in the third cycle. Dilutions are indicated by a ∗.",
    "(B) Cell viability of trmD-WT and trmD-KO strains. Both strains were diluted to the same OD600 and 3 μL of serial 10-fold dilutions were spotted on an LB plate and incubated at the indicated condition. Whereas the two strains showed similar CFU counts when there was no pre-depletion, the trmD-KO strain showed a significantly lower CFU count compared to the trmD-WT strains when cells were pre-depleted at 43°C as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A. This result indicates that the depletion has progressively reduced the protein level of TrmD, resulting in loss of viability.\nRemoval of the plasmid-borne Ec trmD from the trmD-KO strain to screen for suppressors\nTiming: 1 week\nWe describe steps for generation of TrmD-depleted cells by removing the ts maintenance plasmid from the trmD-KO clone through cycles of cell growth and dilution at the non-permissive temperature. We also describe steps for suppressor screen.\nNote: Repeated cycles of growth and dilution at the non-permissive temperature will deplete the ts maintenance plasmid and pre-existing protein and associated products (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCycling between growth and dilution at 43°C. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nGrow a single colony of the trmD-KO strain containing the ts maintenance plasmid in an LB + Kan50 + Amp100 + Ara0.2 liquid culture at 30°C for 14–18 h.\nNote: As a control, inoculate the WT counterpart strain with trmD (trmD-WT) on the chromosome, but containing the pKD46-Ec trmD maintenance plasmid in the same condition. No Kan is needed for the WT strain.\nOptional: Omitting Ara in this preculture will promote the KO phenotype.\nInoculate both precultures at 1:100 to a fresh 10 mL LB medium without Ara. Kan50 is added only to the trmD-KO culture. Grow both cultures at 43°C and monitor growth by measuring OD600.",
    "Note: While the trmD-WT culture should grow fast, the trmD-KO culture should show growth reduction.\nAt OD600 ∼1.0, dilute 1:50 and repeat another cycle of growth and dilution, until there is no visible growth of the trmD-KO strain, indicating loss of viability for the majority of the cells.\nKeep growing the trmD-KO culture until OD600 = 0.1–0.15 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nOptional: To confirm the loss of viability, spot dilutions of the trmD-KO culture to determine the CFU counts (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). The trmD-WT and trmD-KO cell cultures are diluted to the same OD600 and spot 3 μL of serial 10-fold dilutions on an LB plate. Without any pre-depletion, similar CFU counts are observed between trmD-WT and trmD-KO strains, although the count should decrease for the trmD-KO strain at 43°C or in Ara− condition (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Indeed, after a 9-h depletion in liquid culture over three cycles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A), the CFU counts of the trmD-KO strain are decreased by > 106-fold relative to the trmD-WT strain (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), regardless of the growth condition. This significant loss of the CFU counts indicates that the trmD-KO strain is approaching the non-viable state.\nScreen for suppressors of Ec trmD-KO. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Because suppressors may show differential growth in response to the KO, spread different amounts of cells on the screening plates.\nSpread 10 and 100 μL of the cell culture from step 15d on an LB + Kan50 plate.\nSpin down cells in the remaining cell culture (∼9.9 mL) at 7,000 × g for 5 min, 20°C–22°C, resuspend in 100–200 μL LB.\nDivide into 1:9 and spread one portion on one LB + Kan50 plate and the other half on another LB + Kan50 plate.",
    "Incubate plates at 43°C until distinct colonies are observed. To prevent dry-out of plates, wrap each with double layers of parafilm.\nCritical: If there are no colonies after >36 h incubations, leave the plates at 20°C–22°C to avoid getting dried.\nIf a distinct colony is isolated, streak it on an LB + Kan50 plate, and incubate it at 43°C for purification.\nNote: False-positive clones will not grow on this streaked plate.\nConfirm growth of the suppressor cells in a liquid culture. Suppressor cells should show a robust growth in the Ara− condition.\nCritical: Confirm suppressor clone by PCR of the trmD locus and the pKD46 maintenance plasmid, using primers Ec trmD check F and R, and pKD46 check F and R, respectively. Also test the Amp sensitivity of the ts strain for loss of the Amp-carrying maintenance plasmid.\nCritical: In step 15d, avoid over-growing the cell culture, which will generate sibling colonies of each suppressor on the screening plates.\nCritical: To avoid genomic bias of a host, use several different host strains and construct the KO derivative of each with the same ts strategy. For examples, consider using different host strains such as MG1655, XAC-1, and BW25113. Then perform the same suppressor screen in parallel. Additionally, to strengthen conclusions, perform the suppressor screen of each strain at least twice to minimize isolation of sibling clones. Validate phenotypes associated with the gene of interest.\nWhole-genome sequencing of suppressors\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nWe describe steps for library preparation and sequencing of the genomes of the suppressor cells.

Follow the manufacturer’s instruction.\nPerform whole-genome sequencing of the constructed DNA library in an appropriate setting.\nNote: In the cited work,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] a 2 × 150 bp paired-end sequencing was performed using the MiSeq platform (Illumina).

Mutations that do not restore cell viability in the WT background will be removed.
