Cloning the gene of interest into the yeast toxicity plasmid pYesNTA-Kan\nNOTE: Currently, there are a variety yeast toxicity vectors available both commercially and academically. The yeast suppressor screen can be used in conjunction with many of these vectors provided the plasmid expressing the effector protein of interest uses a dropout selection other than uracil and an antibiotic marker other than BlaR.
