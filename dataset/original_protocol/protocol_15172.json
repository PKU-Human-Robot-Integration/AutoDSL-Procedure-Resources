  "procedures": [
    "The SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities Ethics Committee assessed the protocol described here. A written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from every participant.\n1. Participants recruitment\nRecruit at least 36 volunteers for each training group. This number was evidenced to be enough to observe between-groups effects by authors' previous research and also in the literature on the subject. Typical effect sizes in working memory trainings studies range between d=0.6 to 0.8 depending on the training type or targeted group. Based on these values and aiming at a decent statistical power of 0.8 with alpha at 0.05, a minimum sample size in this type of research (calculated according to a formula proposed by Soper45) is 36 (preferably more).\n\t\nUse the following inclusion criteria: over 55 years old, with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, with preserved motor skills of the upper limbs, without blindness or hearing loss, who are not presently involved in any other cognitive (especially memory) training.\nRecruit participants using various methods: online advertisements posted on social media profiles, research and work platforms or discussion groups, as well as in-person announcements at Universities of a Third Age or during events involving older audience such as picnics for seniors (also with usage of posters and leaflets) to get certainty that the people who are recruited are not only internet users.\nRemember to adequately describe in the advertisement what type of participants you are looking for.\n2. The evaluation of the Ethics Committee",
    "Before starting the study, obtain the evaluation form your local Ethics Committee, including permission to: a) Interactions consisting of active intervention in human behavior, aimed at changing this behavior, without directly interfering with the brain, e.g. cognitive training, psychotherapy, etc. (this also applies to intervention intended to benefit the respondent, e.g. improving his memory), b) collect and process participants' personal data, in particular data that allows to identify the subjects.\n3. Initial screening\nBegin with a short interview informing the participant in detail about the project's aim, the possibility of withdrawal, and personal data protection.\nBe sure that participant does not take drugs or has never suffered from any disease that may affect central nervous system functioning. Likewise, control intake of medications not related to neurological diseases that affect cognitive functioning. If the screening revealed any unwanted information, exclude the volunteer from the study.\nAfter successful screening, present the written informed consent form to the participant and ask them to read it. The written informed consent should involve information as follows: a) the legal bases for data gathering and processing specific for a given country, b) information about rights of the data owner (e.g., accessing the personal data, possibility to supplement incomplete personal data, deleting data or processing restrictions).\n\t\nAsk the participant to sign the informed consent.\nCarry out the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)32 to ensure that participant shows no signs of mild cognitive impairment - at least 27 points are needed to enter next stages of a study.\n\t\nRead the MMSE's Introductory Script to the participant and then ask questions in accordance with the examination script.",
    "Begin with an assessment of orientation to place and time by asking series of questions: What is today's full date? What day of week is today? Where are we (what city, name the building, which floor)?\nFollow with memory test: ask participant to memorize three objects that was read at loud by you; go through the series of seven tasks assessing attention, concentration, and calculation, and at the end ask participant to recall the three objects previously learned.\nFinally, test naming, repetition, and understanding according to examination script.\nScore responses as follows: 0 = incorrect or lack of an answer, 1 = correct answer.\nDo not take longer than 10 min for the administration of the MMSE test.\nIf a person does not reach the required threshold (27 points), inform them of the result. If there is any suspicion of a clinically lowered level of cognitive functioning, refer such a person to a specialist unit (e.g., a certified psychologist at a neurological center).\nStore documentation in a manner that complies with the law and/or The General Data Protection Regulation of the local country.\n4. Training group assignment\nRandomly assign participants to an experimental or control group ( Figure 1). To ensure the randomness of the process, generate a list of 50 codenames ( Figure 2) assigned to ones and twos (training groups) and connect each participant in recruiting order with those codes (saved in separate file). From now on, replace participant data with codenames.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60804/60804fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Study design with examples of a training tasks.

    "Make sure that the group assignment is not biased in terms of age, gender or the level of education. Pre-assign age, gender and education group to the list of code-names for each training group (1 and 2), as presented in Figure 2. Fit each volunteer in the table based on their characteristics.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60804/60804fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The example of suggested coding form for group assignment.Â \n5. Initial assessment of cognitive functioning\nPut an emphasis on giving very clear and detailed instruction to the participants about how to go through each task at the beginning of each procedure. Run the \"training block\" before each task (that is identical to the training task) and observe the participant if their answers indicate that they understand the instructions.\n\tNOTE: The inclusion of such blocks is described at the beginning of description of each task below.\nAfter presenting the instruction and practice part of each task and before starting the main part of the procedure, once again ask if the participant understands the procedure's requirements.\nBe sure that each participant will accomplish the full set of the following tasks.\nThe operation span task (OSPAN)\n\t\nRun a training block to estimate the individual time needed for each participant to calculate a simple mathematical equation (adding, subtraction, dividing and multiplication of single digits - not higher numbers).\nIn the middle of the white screen display the equation to the participant. Instruct the participant to think of the result and then press an arrow leading to the next screen, where the outcome of equation is presented. Let the participant give an answer by pressing either the True or False button.",
    "Count the time needed for resolving the equation. Use mean time needed in a final block as a time of displaying the equation in the main part of the task. Have a fixed time limit imposed for estimating the correctness of the equation result: 5 s.\nIn the next training block display letters on the screen - one by one, for 500 ms each, and instruct the participant to remember them. After a full set (3 to 9 letters), present the matrix of 12 letters to participant and ask to mark memorized letters in a correct order. Do not give a time limit for the answer. Record the correctness.\nRun a main part of the task. In the final block, mix two abovementioned training blocks: after each part with equation (remember about time limits!) present one letter to remember. Display 2 to 5 pairs of 'equation + letter' and then, after presenting the whole sequence of 'equation + letter' pairs, show the matrix of letters for participant to mark memorized letters in a correct order. Record the correctness of mathematical and memory part.\n\t\tNOTE: With this test the operational span of Working Memory (processing the one kind of information while remembering the other) is assessed.\nThe Sternberg task\n\t\nPresent a random sequence of digits (2 to 5 in a one set) in white font on black screen, for 500 ms each, with the interval ranging from 2500 to 3000 ms.\nDisplay a fixation cross for 2500 ms.\nAt the end of presented sequence, display a target digit in a yellow font for 500 ms.",
    "Let the participant decide if the yellow digit appeared among the presented earlier set of white digits by pressing Yes/No buttons. If the participant does not give an answer within 3000 ms, go to the screen with fixation point and start the next trial. Count this attempt as a wrong answer.\nRepeat steps 5.5.1 to 5.5.4 120 times (trials) with 50% of probes containing target digit in the sequence and 50% do not (randomly).\nRecord the correctness and the reaction time for each trial.\n\t\tNOTE: This task tests the speed of searching the information in memory. The increase of reaction time accompanies the enlargement of the set, which is explained as the process of a serial search of the memory content.\nThe running memory span task\n\t\nOn the screen, present information about the number of letters to remember (3, 4, 5 or 6 letters depending on the difficulty level of a block) and ask the participant to go to the next screen by pressing a key.\nPresent a sequence of letters, one by one, in black font in the center of a white screen, for 0.25 s each.\nAsk the participant to reproduce a fixed number of the last letters from the sequence: fixed no: 4; sequence; K U J D S T W A; letters to memorize: S T W A.\nTo receive the participant's answer, display on the screen a matrix of 9 letters (3x3) and ask the participant to mark appropriate letters (in order the letters appeared) with the mouse. Do not give a time limit for the answer.\nRecord correctness (mind the sequence errors).",
    "NOTE: This test measures the capacity of the working memory with the use of the additional distraction in the form of the inability to predict which letters from the list would be the portion to remember.\nTest Go-No Go\n\t\nOn the white screen display trials composed of: a) 250 ms - a fixation point (white cross), b) 1250 ms - the stimuli (a letter), c) 2000 ms - a fixed inter-stimulus interval.\nHave the participant react by pressing a key as quickly as possible, when a target stimulus - letter X - appears on the screen.\nRecord the reaction time and correctness of answers.\n\t\tNOTE: The test measures the efficiency of inhibition in two conditions: in easier condition the letter X is presented in the 50/50 proportion to other letters and in the more difficult condition the target stimulus is displayed in 70/30 proportion to other letters.\nThe switching task\n\t\nDivide the screen into two parts using a horizontal line. Present red squares or rectangles composed of smaller squares or rectangles above or below this line.\nApply two different rules for the participant to react, depending on where figures will appear - \"pay attention to the small figures\" (local) for an upper part of the screen and \"pay attention to the whole figure composed from smaller figures\" (global) for a lower part of the screen. Have the participant react according to the part of the screen where the stimuli appeared.",
    "Add a cue indicating to which dimension (global or local) the participants should respond. Cues related to the local dimension should consists of a small red square, presented at one side of the target stimulus, and a small red rectangle, displayed at the other side of the target stimulus. Accordingly, cues related to the global dimension should consist of a big red square, presented at one side of the target stimulus, and a big red rectangle, displayed at the other side of the target stimulus.\nDisplay the figures above or below the middle line in random order.\nHave the participant react according to the previously presented rules: answering \"rectangle\" by using the left button and answering \"square\" by pressing the right one.\nRecord reaction times and correctness of the answers.\n\t\tNOTE: Time for the response have to be fixed at 3500 ms. The time interval between the cue and the target stimulus should be 500 ms. The interval between the response and the presentation of the cue should be 1000 ms. Each figure and each cue should be presented for all the time needed for the participant to react by pressing one of the keys. The Switching Task measures the cognitive fluency, as it requires quick attention switching between the respective elements.\nThe linear syllogism task\nDisplay on the screen a set of three 'premises' that together constitute logical chain of relations: pairs of letters with an information about a relation between them: A > B, B > C and C > D. Each premise should be visible on the screen for 1500 ms and interval between them should last 3000, 3500 or 4000 ms (randomly). An integrated mental model representation32 of such set of pairs will always be in the linear order \"A > B > C > D\".",
    "Include three pairs of possible relations between premises in separate trials: 1) A > B, B > C, C > D (adjacent pairs, exactly the same as those that had been seen in the learning phase), 2) A > C, B > D (two-step relations, not seen before and requiring integration of information), 3) A > D (end point relation, not seen before and requiring integration of information).\nConstruct the task so that it contains two conditions: an easy condition, where the premises should be displayed one after the other in the order in which they form a logical string (e.g. string: Q>W>E>R>T, premises order: Q>W, W>E, E>R, R>T ); a difficult condition, the order of the premises should be altered (e.g. premises order: W>E, Q>W, R>T, E>R).\nTest the participant immediately after the presentation of premises by displaying statements (for 1500 ms each) that participant needs to assess as true (answer: right button) or false (answer: left button), as fast as possible. Set time limit for the answer - 6000 ms, and after each answer given wait an additional 1000 ms before displaying the next question. Each statement should consist of only one pair of letters and relation between them ('<' or '>') in either a correct (e.g., \"W > E ?\") or false setup (e.g., \"E > W ?\").\nRandomize the arrangement of the letters in order to minimize possible interference induced by implied alphabetical order of letters.\nUse capital letters as stimuli instead of whole sentences in order to avoid linguistic connotations, and the symbol \">\"to indicate the relation between elements.\nGather the data about the accuracy and reaction time of the response for each question.",
    "NOTE: Questions about adjacent pairs are used to estimate memory, and questions about premises presented in a mixed order, and those asking about the relationship between the far elements of logical sequences are asked to measure the ability to information integration.\n6. Training protocols\nFor both experimental (n-back) and control (Quiz) trainings provide participants with the access to the Internet platform (logins and passwords) - which allowed them to enter the site every 24 hours, to avoid situations in which the participant trains more than once a day.\nMake sure that participant understands the task as well as the training regimen.\nInstruct participant to train in similar conditions every time, in calm and quiet place with possibly low level of external distractors.\nExperimental training: working memory paradigm\n\tNOTE: An adaptive dual n-back task served as a working memory training program. This task was introduced by Jaeggi et al.33 and simultaneously recruits auditory and visual attention, maintenance, and updating processes.\n\t\nInstruct participant on the task at level N=2 (see Figure 1B).\nUse alphabet letters as auditory stimuli and green squares, presented in one of nine locations in a 3x3 matrix, as visual stimuli.\nPresent a single item for 500 ms followed by 2500 ms interval, during which the participants are supposed to respond. The current stimuli can match the target visual (response with left hand) or auditory stimulus (response with right hand) or both (response with both hands simultaneously).\nSingle session of the n-back training",
    "Set level of N to 2, in the first block of the task. After each block, evaluate the correctness of the answers and, on this basis, adjust the level N in the next block. If the accuracy surpassed 85%, the difficulty level should be increased (by 1 point), if the accuracy drops below 60%, lower the difficulty level. In other cases the N remains unchanged.\nFor the first block, fix the n-back task level at N=2. Later, determine the N level for the current block based on the correctness of answers in the previous block. If the accuracy exceeds 85%, increase difficulty level. If the accuracy is below 60%, the level of difficulty should be lowered. In other cases, the N level should remain unchanged.\nSet a single dual n-back session for 15 rounds (15 blocks of tasks), each with 20 + N trials and the whole training set for 25 sessions.\nRecord reaction times (RTs) and accuracy (ACC) measures for each trial.\nControl training: episodic memory paradigm\n\t\nCollect material from the Internet in order to construct the Quiz Task which engages semantic memory (e.g., what is the capital city of Hungary?).\nPresent 15 questions in each training session of Quiz Task (starting from the second session 5 questions come from the previous session and 10 should be new) with no time limit for reading it. Instruct participant that after selecting the 'answer' button they have to choose one of the four given possibilities within 40 seconds. Provide the feedback for correctness of the answers.\nSet the whole training for 25 sessions.\n7. Training supervision\nDuring the course of the training verify the training progress of each participant. Assign an experimenter who is responsible for checking (online) the progress of the training, to each participant.",
    "If a break between sessions is longer than two days, have the experimenter contact the participant via text message and encourage him or her to resume the training.\n8. Post-training assessment of cognitive functions\nProceed with post-training session in the exact way as the pre-training meeting.\nCompensate each participant, who completed the whole protocol for the time dedicated to the research, with 150 PLN (~$40).\nSubscription Required.
