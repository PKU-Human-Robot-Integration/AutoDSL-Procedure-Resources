    "Pulverizing articular cartilage in a cryogenic mill has been suggested to provide the most adequate homogenization method to minimize RNA degradation, yield a fairly high RNA concentration, and maintain physiological transcriptomic composition of chondrocytes for downstream analyses including real-time qPCR, microarray analysis, and RNA-Seq (Le Bleu et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0014]). In this protocol, articular cartilage shavings harvested from 5-week-old broiler knee joints (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0003]) are cryo-pulverized and then processed in 0.1-g portions through a modified TRIzol-based protocol to produce high-quality total RNA. The grinding process using an SPEX SamplePrep 6775 Freezer/Mill is illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/82035346-116a-42d8-aaf2-bda13d2f892e/cpz1692-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nProcedure for pulverizing chicken articular cartilage shavings using a cryogenic mill (SPEX SamplePrep 6775 Freezer/Mill). (A) Fill the tank of the mill to the fill line with liquid nitrogen. (B) Load cartilage shavings (snap-frozen directly after dissection) in the pre-chilled vial of the instrument. (C) Drop in the chilled impactor. (D) Insert the vial into the chamber. Check the liquid nitrogen level and top it off, if necessary. (E) Run the program as set on the control panel touchscreen display. (F) Remove the vial, open the end plug using the Extractor/Vial Opener, and extract the impactor using the Magnetic Extractor as shown. Immediately proceed to a measuring scale and weigh 100-mg portions of pulverized cartilage into microcentrifuge tubes.\nNOTE: All materials, equipment, and solutions coming into contact with cartilage shavings must be sterile and RNase-free. If not sterilized by the manufacturer, materials can be sterilized by autoclaving or in a hot air oven or (in the case of liquids and solutions) by passing through a 0.22-μm filter unit.\nMaterials\nLiquid nitrogen\nArticular cartilage shavings from chicken (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0003])\nTRIzol reagent (TRIzolate, UD Genomed, cat. no. URN0103, or equivalent)\nRNase decontamination solution (RNaseZap or RNase AWAY)",
    "Chloroform (Merck, cat. no. 288306, or equivalent)\nNaCl/NaOAc mixture: 2.4 M sodium chloride and 1.6 M sodium acetate\nIsopropanol (Merck, cat. no. 278475, or equivalent)\nEthanol (Merck, cat. no. 32221-M, or equivalent)\nNuclease-free water (Promega, cat. no. P119E, or equivalent)\nCryogenic mill (SPEX SamplePrep 6775 Freezer/Mill or equivalent)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf or equivalent)\nFume hood\nVariable-speed mixer (Thermolyne Maxi Mix III 6580 or equivalent)\nPCR UV cabinet (Biosan UVT-S-AR or equivalent)\nGrind tissue\n1. Fill the liquid nitrogen container from the cryogenic mill up to the fill line. Set the grinding program to the following parameters (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-fig-0001]):\n         \n1 min pre-cool\nthree cycles of 15-s grinding at 8 cycles per second (cps)\n1 min cool down time\nRefer to the manufacturer's instruction manual for specific operational guidelines and details. The manual for the SPEX mill is available at https://pim-resources.coleparmer.com/instruction-manual/6775-freezermill-manual.pdf[href=https://pim-resources.coleparmer.com/instruction-manual/6775-freezermill-manual.pdf].\nThe required grinding parameters may vary significantly depending on the species and age (and probably also fitness level) of the animal as well as the specifications of the cryogenic grinder used. This protocol was developed using 5-week-old broilers. The general principle is to allow enough cool down time between cycles and try to keep the frequency to a minimum to ensure optimal brittleness of the samples throughout the protocol.\nCAUTION: Liquid nitrogen is an extremely cold material with risks including cold burns, frostbite, permanent eye damage, asphyxiation, and explosion caused by pressure buildup. To minimize risk, always implement prudent safety practices, including handling in well-ventilated areas and handling slowly to minimize splashing. Always wear appropriate PPE, including eye/face and skin protection.\n2. Transfer the first batch of articular cartilage shavings (flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen) to the chilled small grinding vial of the mill (the SPEX vial has a sample capacity of 0.1-5.0 g). Run the grinding protocol.",
    "Typically, 0.3-0.5 g of shavings can be obtained from a single knee joint from a broiler of the size used here. Thus, a single batch corresponds to the sample from one joint. All other samples should be kept in liquid nitrogen for this duration until processing to minimize the possibility of RNA degradation.\n3. Transfer pulverizes tissue in 0.1-g portions (or slightly less, but not more) to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, place in a fume hood, and proceed immediately to the next step.\nTo increase time efficiency and prevent pulverized tissue from warming to room temperature, it is advisable to carry out measurements on an analytical scale with a tube already placed on the tray and set the weight display to zero (tare).\nExtract RNA\n4. Immediately add 1 ml chilled TRIzol to each tube and incubate 15 min at room temperature in a variable-speed mixer.\nCAUTION: Safety precautions are necessary with TRIzol as it contains phenol (toxic and corrosive) and guanidine isothiocyanate (an irritant) and may be a health hazard if not handled properly. Avoid direct contact with skin, eyes, or respiratory tract, which may cause chemical burns. Always work in a fume hood and wear appropriate PPE.\n5. Centrifuge 5 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C, to pellet tissue debris.\n6. Transfer tubes to a PCR UV cabinet that has been thoroughly decontaminated with an RNase decontamination solution.\n7. Pipette supernatant to new 1.5-ml tubes and add 200 μl chloroform. Shake well for 30 s and leave at room temperature for 3 min.\n8. Centrifuge 5 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C, until three phases separate. Transfer the top (aqueous) layer to a new 1.5-ml tube.\nOptional: Repeat extraction with TRIzol and chloroform to obtain high-quality RNA.",
    "9. Use a 1000-μl pipette to estimate the sample volumes and then add 1 volume of NaCl/NaOAc mixture to each tube (final 1.2 M and 0.8 M of each salt, respectively).\nUsing a high salt concentration at this step is necessary to purify RNA samples from proteoglycans.\n10. Add 0.3 volume of 100% isopropanol and incubate 10 min at room temperature to precipitate the RNA.\n11. Pellet RNA by centrifuging 10 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C.\n12. Wash pellet twice with 1 ml of 75% (v/v) ethanol, centrifuging 10 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C, after each wash.\nEthanol washes remove residual salt from the RNA pellet. This concentration of ethanol will solubilize salts but not RNA.\nOptional: Collect the remaining ethanol at the bottom of the tube by centrifuging once more for 2 min (12,000 × g, 4°C). If the RNA pellet is clearly visible, the ethanol can be removed by careful pipetting with a 100-μl tip.\n13. Dry samples for up to 15 min at room temperature.\nDo not over-dry the pellet. The less dry the pellet, the easier it is to solubilize. It is not recommended to dry by vacuum centrifuge (SpeedVac).\n14. Resuspend each pellet in 50 μl nuclease-free water. To fully resuspend, vortex for 10 s, then centrifuge 10 s at 2500 × g, room temperature. Repeat for a total of three times.\n15. Measure RNA concentration and purity using a suitable spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop ND-1000). Store purified RNA up to several weeks at −80°C.\nOn average, 200 µg of RNA is obtained per gram of starting material.",
    "If a cryogenic mill is not available, an alternate method is to mince the cartilage shavings and then digest them to release chondrocytes from the ECM for RNA extraction. Minced shavings are digested with collagenase type II overnight in a CO2 incubator. The chondrocytes are pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in TRIzol reagent, and then total RNA is extracted. As an alternative, we also describe how to use the collagenase-digested sample to set up primary chondrocyte cultures.\nNOTE: All materials, equipment, and solutions coming into contact with cartilage shavings must be sterile and RNase-free. If not sterilized by the manufacturer, materials can be sterilized by autoclaving or in a hot air oven or (in the case of liquids and solutions) by passing through a 0.22-μm filter unit. The entire protocol, including filtration of the collagenase solution, should be performed in a laminar flow hood suitable for cell culture.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0001])\nCollagenase type II (Merck, cat. no.

Dissolve 100 mg collagenase type II in 8.3 ml complete DMEM (final 1.2% w/v) and pass through a 0.22-μm syringe filter into a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\nSterile filtering and a sterile environment is important to prevent bacterial/fungal infection of the medium during the overnight incubation period.\nFBS is used in the collagenase solution to maintain cell viability as digestion proceeds. If digestion of cartilage chips is not complete following overnight incubation, then try lowering the FBS concentration to 2.5%.",
    "2. Mince cartilage shavings into small chips (i.e., 1-2 mm) using sterile stainless steel disposable scalpels (no. 15) and a pair of sterile forceps. Transfer to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-fig-0002]).\nCartilage shavings must be minced to increase their surface area and speed up the process of digestion. Handling time is more important here than the size of the pellets. Keep mincing time to a minimum rather than being too meticulous in mincing the cartilage into equal pieces.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bbeb4cb7-508c-4409-a89c-f849226fd8c1/cpz1692-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMincing of articular cartilage shavings from the knee joint. (A) Harvested articular cartilage slices in 1× PBS. (B) Cartilage chips minced to ∼1-mm3 with a scalpel. (C) Cartilage chips soaking in DMEM before transfer to collagenase type II solution.\n3. Weigh cartilage chips and transfer ∼0.1-g portions into sterile 15-ml centrifuge tubes.\n4. Add 3 ml filtered collagenase solution to each centrifuge tube, fasten the caps securely, and incubate overnight (∼16 hr) in a 37°C incubator with an orbital shaker at 150 cycles/min.\nFollowing incubation, the solution should be a lighter shade of pink and turbid. If it is turbid but bright yellow, a bacterial or fungal infection has occurred and the digest should be immediately discarded.\nProcess for RNA extraction\n5a. Centrifuge digested tissue for 10 min at 5000 × g, 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nThis relatively high speed is necessary to pellet small fragments of digested cartilage chips along with cells.\n6a. Add 1 ml TRIzol reagent to each pellet and incubate 15 min at room temperature on a rotator.\n7a. Proceed with RNA extraction as described (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0001], step 5).\nProcess for primary chondrocyte culture\n5b. Decant the digested tissue through a 40-μm cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension.",
    "6b. Pellet cells by centrifuging 5 min at 300 × g. Carefully remove the supernatant and pool pellets originating from the same joint surface.\n7b. Wash pellet twice with high-glucose DMEM without FBS (10 ml).\n8b. Resuspend cells in high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS (∼2 ml per joint).\n9b. Add trypan blue and count cells to determine concentration and viability.\nFor additional details, refer to protocols in Liebman & Goldberg (2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0016]).",
    "The following steps describe how to obtain articular cartilage shavings from fresh broiler knee joints. With minor modifications, the method can be applied to other medium-sized animals such as rabbit, dog, or cat. The resulting cartilage shavings can be used for total RNA extraction or primary chondrocyte cultures.\nMaterials\nThree broilers, 35-38 days old (∼5 weeks) (sourced from local poultry farm)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\n3% (v/v) H2O2\nLiquid nitrogen (∼200 ml) in an uncovered container\n1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, cat. no. 18912014, or equivalent)\nA few squares of absorbent paper (blue roll paper)\nSterile disposable scalpels or scalpel blades (no. 10 or 15)\nStrong bristled brush\nLaminar flow hood (suitable for sterile cell culture work)\nBiological safety cabinet (BSL-1)\nSterile metal tray\n2-ml cryogenic vials (Corning, with orange caps, or equivalent)\n150-mm glass Petri culture dishes\n1. Obtain at least three broilers, ∼5 weeks of age, from a local poultry farm.\nBroilers should be housed according to local standard practices and raised with free access to both feed and water. To reduce environmental effects, broilers should be sampled from the same flock in a dark house system managed by a high-standard producer.\n2. Sacrifice one animal according to local standard ethical practices.\nIt is important to handle one animal at a time, as processing time may have a significant effect on RNA quality.\nThe chicken knee joint is high on the leg, covered by the feathers. The knee joint is not readily visible when the animal is walking. The joint that points posteriorly is the ankle joint (referred to as the hock joint). Broiler joints yield more cartilage than joints from adult chickens.",
    "3. Isolate the lower limbs, starting with incisions in the feathery skin made using a disposable scalpel. Remove the lower limb at the hip joint, and then remove the distal part of the limb at the joint between the tibiotarsus and the tarsometatarsus (the intertarsal joint).\n4. Clean the legs by rinsing well with warm tap water.\nBroiler feet are usually covered in mud and farm detritus.\n5. Use a strong bristled brush to remove loosely attached material, then wash the legs with cold tap water to thoroughly remove all remaining traces of dirt from the skin.\nTake extra care to remove all traces of dirt from the skin, as this can be a significant source of RNases that detrimentally affect the quality of extracted RNA.\n6. Disinfect the isolated limbs by spraying liberally with 70% ethanol, then wipe limbs with paper towels moistened with 70% ethanol.\n7. Lay limbs in a supine position, i.e., with the anterior aspect of the joint facing upwards. Using a disposable scalpel, make a lengthwise incision starting from the top and dissect away the skin by making a circumferential incision around the area of the limb where the feathers and scales meet. Take care not to pierce the joint capsule of the knee joint.\nThe skin is loosely attached to underlying structures through a superficial fascia with strands of connective tissue that can be easily cut away with the blade. Pulling back the skin while cutting ensures that the joint capsule (the enclosure around the joint) maintains its integrity and sterility. When removing the skin, try to prevent the feathery external surface from directly contacting the underlying tissues.",
    "CAUTION: When handling the scalpel, always cut away from you and always place your fingers and hands away from the plane of dissection. It is advisable to wear a chainmail glove on the non-blade-holding hand if you are inexperienced in dissection.\n8. Rinse the skinned limb with water, then with 3% H2O2.\n9. Place the skinned limb anterior-side-upward on a clean and sterile metal tray inside a sterile biological safety cabinet (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-fig-0003]). Flex the limb at the joint.\nIdeally, the biological safety cabinet should be one that is not used for routine cell culture work. If such a cabinet is not available, a clear benchtop surface is also suitable in a wet laboratory (thoroughly wiped with 70% ethanol). From this point, use sterile materials only.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6bc9cf22-f425-46b1-b673-13266321b961/cpz1692-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nDissection of chicken thigh for harvesting of articular cartilage shavings from the knee joint. (A) The isolated chicken thigh after a thorough cleaning. This photo shows the thigh after the feathery skin has been dissected away and being rinsed in 3% H2O2. (B) The knee joint has been opened with a scalpel from the ventral side following skin dissection. Shavings can be cut from articular surfaces of the femur (arrow) and tibia.\n10. Make a longitudinal incision along the anterior or lateral side of the joint capsule, taking care not to cut into the cartilage (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-fig-0003]). Continue the incision laterally until the joint is exposed on three sides. Carefully open the joint fully by flexing the limb.\n11. Obtain thin cartilage shavings from the articular surface of the femur and tibia using a new sterile disposable scalpel. Follow the curved shape of the articular surfaces as closely as possible to obtain shavings of roughly uniform shape and depth (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-fig-0002]).",
    "If blood oozes from the shavings, this indicates that the incision was deep and included bone, which (unlike cartilage) is vascularized. In this case, make fewer deep incisions as you remove the articular cartilage as you gauge the depth and softness of the joint tissues.\nFrom this point on, use RNase-free materials and equipment only. Processing time should be kept to a minimum to reduce exposure of cells to RNases.\n12. For pulverization in a cryogenic mill (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0001]), place shavings directly into a cryogenic vial immersed in liquid nitrogen. For enzymatic digestion of cartilage (see Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0002]), transfer shavings to a 150-mm glass Petri dish containing 30 ml 1× PBS.\nShavings from each knee joint should be placed in a separate vial/Petri dish to minimize the possibility of cross-contamination. In the case of pulverization, this will also decrease the time each sample spends outside the liquid nitrogen.",
    "RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is powerful method to obtain global gene expression data of experimental samples using isolated total RNA. RNA-Seq analysis is suitable to determine the number of expressed genes and level of expression and to identify a list of differentially expressed genes between various experimental conditions. This methodology has been widely applied in cartilage research (Hu et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0007]; Huang et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0008]; Huynh, Zhang, & Guilak, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0010]; Sunkara et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0023]; Wu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-bib-0025]). There are three major steps in an RNA-Seq experiment: (1) quality checking of RNA samples, (2) library preparation and sequencing, and (3) analysis and interpretation of sequencing data. Given that detailed protocols are available online as indicated for each kit below, we only very briefly describe the main points for each step, highlighting critical points and giving specific suggestions.\nMaterials\nTotal RNA samples (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.692#cpz1692-prot-0002])\nRNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5067-1511)\nNEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

RNA integrity correlates with sample degradation and is calculated based on fragment size distribution. Fluorescent labeling of the RNA sample combined with capillary gel electrophoresis is a sensitive method for this purpose. The 2100 Bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit is a suitable platform that requires only 1 μl input RNA as the sample. The qualitative range of this platform is 5-500 ng/μl and the quantitative range is 25-500 ng/μl. The instrument is controlled by 2100 Expert software. An electropherogram is generated showing the fragments in the RNA sample. Based on the fragment distribution, the software calculates an RNA integrity number (RIN) that ranges from 1 to 10, with the highest value meaning the best quality RNA. The RIN determines the most optimal protocol for library preparation (see step 2 below). The software also calculates a concentration value of the samples using the fluorescent signal intensity levels.\n1. Set up the assay equipment and the 2100 Bioanalyzer, decontaminate the electrodes, and prepare the gel and gel-dye mix. Load the gel-dye mix, RNA 6000 Nano Marker, ladder (1 μl), and samples (1 μl) the onto the chip.\nA detailed, step-by-step protocol for setting up the bioanalyzer can be found at https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/G2938-90034_RNA6000Nano_KG.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/G2938-90034_RNA6000Nano_KG.pdf]. Carefully follow this protocol, taking all details into account.",
    "2. Insert the chip into the bioanalyzer and start the chip run from the 2100 Expert software screen.\n3. Immediately after the run is finished, remove the chip from the bioanalyzer and dispose of it according to good laboratory practices.\n4. Analyze the sample well results.\nRNA samples with RIN > 6 are acceptable for library preparation.\nAlternative options for QC\nIf only a small amount of input RNA is available, the more sensitive RNA 6000 Pico Kit can be used (qualitative range 50-5000 pg/μl). Other types of instruments that can be used to determine fragment size distribution include TapeStation Instruments and the Agilent Fragment Analyzer System.\nLibrary preparation\nThere are several protocols for library preparation based on input RNA sample quality and the aim of the study. The first crucial step is to remove rRNA. rRNA comprises ∼80%-90% of total RNA and its expression levels are not usually of interest. If the input RNA is of good quality (RIN > 6), a poly(A) RNA selection protocol should be used. This employs oligo(dT)-conjugated magnetic beads that bind the poly(A) tail of mature mRNA, effectively removing other RNA species (rRNA, pre-mRNA, and non-coding RNA) from the total RNA sample. The NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module should be used to enrich the full-length mature mRNA population. Library preparation is then performed using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit with Sample Purification Beads. In general, the manufacturer's protocol should be followed (https://international.neb.com/protocols/2017/02/05/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-poly-a-mrna-magnetic-isolation-module-e7490-and-nebnext-ultra-ii-di[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2017/02/05/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-poly-a-mrna-magnetic-isolation-module-e7490-and-nebnext-ultra-ii-di]). We provide some specifications and modifications below.\n1. Start the mRNA isolation, fragmentation, and priming from total RNA.\nThe required total RNA input amount is 10 ng to 1 µg, as quantified by Qubit fluorometer and quality checked by bioanalyzer.",
    "2. During poly(A) RNA selection, transfer the mixture of RNA sample and oligo(dT)-conjugated magnetic beads to a 96-well U-bottom plate and place on a Magnetic Stand-96 to capture the beads.\nFor subsequent PCR steps, use a PCR strip of 8 tubes (200 µl each).\n3. During library preparation for magnetic separation, use NEBNext Sample Purification Beads (part of the kit) and perform separation in a 96-well U-bottom plate and a Magnetic Stand-96.\n4. Before adaptor ligation, make a 25-fold dilution of NEBNext Adaptor in Adaptor Dilution Buffer (both parts of the kit).\nThe dilution required is based on the total RNA input. A 25-fold dilution is recommended if the input RNA is between 100 and 249 ng.\n5. Use 10 PCR cycles in the step for PCR enrichment of adaptor-ligated DNA.\nThe number of PCR cycles should be adjusted based on RNA input. It is important to limit the number of PCR cycles to avoid overamplification, which will cause a second peak of ∼1000 bp to appear on the bioanalyzer trace.\n6. Run 1 μl library on the 2100 Bioanalyzer using a DNA 1000 Kit to determine fragment size distribution, average fragment size, and concentration of the library.\nIf the library yield is too low to quantify on this chip, samples can be run on a DNA High Sensitivity chip.\n7. Measure concentration on a Qubit fluorometer using the Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit HS kit.\nAlternative options for library preparation",
    "Poly(A) selection cannot be used for partially or highly degraded RNA samples, as the degradation causes fragmentation of mRNA, which will disconnect some fragments from their poly(A) tail and lead to overrepresentation of the 3′ ends of transcripts in the sequencing results. For such samples, an rRNA depletion protocol is one option. In the first step, use the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat, cat. no. E7405) to remove rRNA species. Using this method, pre-mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be examined in addition to mature poly(A) mRNAs. The efficiency of rRNA depletion is not always 100%, however, so some rRNA contamination can still be detected during sequencing. Furthermore, intronic sequence reads can be present because of the pre-mRNA content. 3′ end sequencing is also an option for generating a library from highly degraded RNA samples. In this case, only the 3′ ends will be represented in the sequencing and not the full-length transcripts.\nThe protocol for the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit v2 is available at https://international.neb.com/products/e7405-nebnext-rrna-depletion-kit-v2-human-mouse-rat-with-rna-sample-purification-beads#Product%20Information[href=https://international.neb.com/products/e7405-nebnext-rrna-depletion-kit-v2-human-mouse-rat-with-rna-sample-purification-beads#Product%20Information]).\nSequencing\nSequencing is performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using single read with a 75-bp read length. The preparation steps for sequencing are as follows:\nLibrary normalization and pooling\n1. Use the following equation to calculate the nanomolar concentration of the libraries based on the average fragment size (determined by the bioanalyzer) and the concentration in ng/μl (measured by Qubit fluorometer):\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\frac{{\\left( {\\rm concentration{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm in{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm ng/\\rm \\umu l} \\right){\\rm{\\ }}}}{{\\left( {\\rm 660{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm g/\\rm mol{\\rm{\\ }} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}\\rm average{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm library{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm size} \\right)}}{\\rm{\\ }} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}{10}^6 = \\rm concentration{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm in{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm nM \\end{equation*}$$\nAlternatively, use the pooling calculator provided by Illumina: https://support.illumina.com/help/pooling-calculator/pooling-calculator.htm[href=https://support.illumina.com/help/pooling-calculator/pooling-calculator.htm].\n2. Dilute each library to 4 nM and pool equal volumes of the normalized libraries together in a microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Library denaturation and loading\n3. Follow the Illumina NextSeq 500 denaturation protocol. Briefly, denature 5 μl of 4 nM library pool with 5 μl freshly prepared 0.2 N NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. Stop denaturation by adding 5 μl of 200 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7, and mixing thoroughly. Add 985 μl of HT1 buffer (resulting in 1 ml of 20 pM denatured library). For loading, add 1180 μl of HT1 buffer to 117 μl of 20 pM denatured library (yielding 1.3 ml of 1.8 pM library) and pipette this solution into the sequencing cartridge.\nThe NextSeq 500 denaturation protocol is available at https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/system_documentation/nextseq/nextseq-denature-dilute-libraries-guide-15048776-09.pdf[href=https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/system_documentation/nextseq/nextseq-denature-dilute-libraries-guide-15048776-09.pdf].\n4. Define sequencing parameters with sample name and indexed barcode information at BaseSpace (https://basespace.illumina.com/dashboard[href=https://basespace.illumina.com/dashboard]), the cloud-based bioinformatics solution of the Illumina platform. Connect the instrument to BaseSpace and start the sequence run.\nBasecalling, fastq generation, and demultiplexing are done automatically by BaseSpace.\nAnalysis and interpretation of sequencing data\nPrimary data analysis\nDownload fastq files from BaseSpace and transfer to the local computer cluster.
