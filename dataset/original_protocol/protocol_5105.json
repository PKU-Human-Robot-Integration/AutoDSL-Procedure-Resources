    "Preparation of F. graminearum macroconidia suspensionStore macroconidia suspension at -80 °C in sterile, double-distilled water as stock solution.To prepare macroconidia suspension for inoculation, transfer 15 µl of stock solution on a synthetic nutrient deficient agar (SNA) and culture at 20 °C under cool-white and near-UV light illumination. Use Parafilm to seal the agar plates. Please also take into consideration Note 1 on fungal aggressiveness given at the end of protocol. The 9-day-old fungal colony is ready for harvest of macroconidia. SNA is a weak nutrient agar. Hence, colonies grow slow and produce relatively low amounts of (fluffy) mycelia, which at harvest time vary from white to light pink in colour (Figure 1). Details on the macroconidia morphology are given by Leslie and Summerell (2006). Wash the SNA agar medium with 4 ml 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20 solution (diluted in sterile, double-distilled water) and then pass through four layers of sterile cheese cloth. Determine the concentration of macroconidia suspension by using a haemocytometer and adjust the concentration to 5 x 104 macroconidia/ml with 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170316/20170316110438_6979.jpgFigure 1. Fusarium graminearum colony on SNA plate at day of harvestRoot-dip inoculation [at seedling stages]Keep seedlings free from contamination. Clean the chamber prior to cultivation and inoculation by using an antimicrobial disinfecting agent, according to the manufacturer’s specifications [in this case with MENNO Florades]. Sterilize seeds in sodium hypochlorite (6%) for 40 min on a magnetic stirrer; then wash 10 times with sterile double-distilled water. Sow seeds in autoclaved sand and cultivate plants in a climate chamber with a 16 h photoperiod of 22 °C/18 °C day/night and 60% humidity until the first leaf is unfolded [Zadoks (Z) 11; Zadoks et al., 1974]. Prior to inoculation, remove plants carefully from the sand.Pool every five seedlings by wrapping their hypocotyls and stems with aluminium foil.",
    "This will ensure that only roots come in contact with the fungal suspension and allows fixation of seedlings as shown in Figure 2. In addition, seedlings can be held in place by using a slot in a polystyrene plug. Plugs are cut out from a polystyrene disk (thickness 10 mm) to the size of flat tray. For each chamber a hole is punched (a conical point chisel is useful), large enough to let pass seedling roots.For inoculation, place pooled seedlings into a flat tray (divided into chambers) by submerging their roots in 5 ml of macroconidia suspension (Figure 2); then shake gently for 2 h on a rotary shaker (Figure 2). For non-inoculated control plants, perform mock inoculation with 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20 (diluted in sterile, double-distilled water). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170316/20170316110550_5222.jpgFigure 2. Root-dip inoculation of wheat seedlings with F. graminearum. Seedlings are placed into a small flat tray with 12 chambers each filled with 5 ml of macroconidia suspension. Hypocotyls and stems above the roots are wrapped in aluminium foil to avoid contact with the fungal suspension.After inoculation, transplant a single or at maximum five seedlings (not closely packed together) in a single pot (7.5 x 7.5 x 8.0 cm) with autoclaved sand. Cultivate seedlings in a climate chamber set at 20 °C under a 22 °C/18 °C day/night rhythm with approximately 60% relative humidity. Microscopic examinations have shown that F. graminearum actively penetrates the epidermal layer of roots by forming different specialised infection structures. To avoid disruption of the infection process, transplant the seedlings immediately after removal from fungal solution. No further treatment is needed. Add 100 ml of water after planting. The water should be poured slowly and carefully. During cultivation the watering (250 ml per pot) regime dependents on the present growth chamber (greenhouse) conditions.",
    "General rule: Sand has a limited water holding capacity. Hence, we suggest to water as soon as the sand surface is dry [in this case every 4 to 6 days]. Please also take into consideration the Notes 2 and 3 on plant cultivation and experimental setup given at the end of protocol.Note: The root-dip inoculation was likewise applied to adult plants at the early stem elongation stage (Z32-33). In contrast to seedling root inoculation, use a 1:2 (v/v) mixture of autoclaved sand and potting soil for cultivation before and after root-dip inoculation to ensure normal plant growth. After root inoculation, cultivate each a single plant per pot (11.5 x 11.5 x 12 cm); water as mentioned above for seedlings. Support the growth of adult plant with fertilizer to avoid undesirable additional stress. Fertilisation is carried out once every two weeks with 250 ml Wuxal Super according to the manufacturer’s specifications, or an equivalent fertiliser. Disease severity assessmentTissue sampling Collect (e.g., each 10) plants per sampling timepoint, treatment and genotype. Wash the roots under running water or immersed in water to avoid root injury. Roots should be washed until sand grains are removed from root surface. The parenchyma tissue of leaf sheath (wrapped around the young stem) is used by the pathogen to colonise lower stem. Hence, caution should be taken with washing, because diseased leaf sheath occasionally becomes very soft and drop gently.Disease impacts on plant development Measure the root and shoot length of inoculated and non-inoculated control plants. Calculate the relative reduction (percentage change) as the ratio between trait expression of diseased plants and trait expression of control plants: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170316/20170316113039_5363.jpgVisible disease symptoms Rate the symptoms on root and stem base by applying each browning and symptom extension scales (0 to 4) to single plants (Figure 3).",
    "The browning scale ranges from 0, symptomless; 1, slightly necrotic; 2, moderately necrotic; 3, severely necrotic; 4, completely necrotic; and the extension scale ranges from: 0, no lesions; 1, 1-24%; 2, 24-49%; 3, 50-75%; 4, > 75% discoloration of root or stem base. Calculate a genotype-timepoint-specific root and stem base symptom index (RSI and SbSI) by using the equation: RSI or SbSI = (E1 + E2 + … + En/n) + (B1 + B2 + … + Bn/n)Where, B and E each represent the parameter browning and extension scale, n represents the number of assessed individuals per genotype and treatment. Stem base is referred to the transition area between the root and the shoot system, located between sub-crown and first stem internode (Figure 3A). An overview on different degrees of diseased root phenotypes and necrosis symptoms is given by Wang et al. (2015). In this publication, Supplementary Figure S1 shows root phenotypes of four wheat genotypes, representing resistant and moderate to high susceptible responses. On the roots and stem bases of susceptible genotypes symptoms typically show a transition from initially local, light (amber) brown discolorations to more distributed dark brown lesions at later timepoints. Stem base necrosis typically covers about half of the stem base of initially few individuals and continued until nearly the entire stem base was affected for more or less all individual plants. Please also take into consideration the Note 4 on symptom assessment given at the end of protocol. Note: Create top view photos showing inoculated and non-inoculated plants side by side (Figure 3A). Such photos can, for example, be used for accurate measurement of browning extension by image analysis.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170316/20170316110856_8093.jpgFigure 3.

    "Seedlings at 14 days after root inoculation with Tween-20 (left) and F. graminearum (right). Inoculated seedlings show root and stem base necrosis as well as lowered root development. B. Close up of root and stem base symptoms visualised 21 days after root inoculation.DNA preparation for reference-gene-based qPCR quantificationSelect and pool root tissues of five seedlings per genotype/treatment/timepoint to be used for fungal and root biomass quantification. Freeze root samples in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C until further use. Extract gDNA from root tissues according to the protocol given by Doyle and Doyle (1990). Dilute gDNA of all samples to 50 ng/μl as work solution.Preparation of gDNA as a plant standard in the qPCR quantification of root biomass. Collect leave samples from non-inoculated seedlings or young plants. Dilute gDNA serially with sterile double-distilled water (100, 50, 25, 6.25, 1.5625, 0.39 ng wheat DNA/μl) and keep DNA at -20 °C until use. For the isolation of gDNA from F. graminearum mycelium, inoculate 100 ml potato dextrose broth (PDB) with 2 ml of 2 x 105 macroconidia suspension and incubate on a rotary shaker at 28 °C for 3 to 5 days (depending on the mycelium growth). Harvest the mycelium by filtration: pass the PDB through four layers of sterile cheese cloth. Collect the mycelium, grind in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C by using a mortar and pestle. Isolate the gDNA by applying the CTAB-based method described by Brandfass and Karlovsky (2008). Preparation of gDNA as a Fusarium standard in the qPCR quantification of fungal biomass. Dilute gDNA serially with sterile double-distilled water (50, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1 ng F. graminearum DNA/µl) and keep the DNA at -20 °C until use.",
    "Note: Pooling of root tissues is used due to the inability to obtain enough root material from a single seedling, especially at early timepoints after root infection and/or in the case of high susceptibility to FRR. To ensure consistency, pooling should be generally applied to all sampling timepoints (if several exist). In case adult plants are tested, pooling might be applied as a method of biological averaging. Reference-gene-based qPCR measurement of root and fungal biomassTo amplify a F. graminearum specific fragment (Nicholson et al., 1998), use the primers Fg16N-F (ACAGATGACAAGATTCAGGCACA) and Fg16N-R (TTCTTTGACATCTGTTCAACCCA). To amplify wheat DNA (Ubiquitin gene, DQ086482) use the primers Ubi-F (CCCTGGAGGTGGAGTCATCTGA) and Ubi-R (GCGGCCATCCTCAAGCTGCTTA). Split PCR plate into two parts, each containing the wheat or fungal dilution series and eight root samples in three technical replicates. The amplification mix consists of 1 μl template DNA, 5 μl Roche FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master, 2 μl double-distilled water, and each 1 µl of forward and reverse primer (10 pmol/μl). Perform PCR with initial denaturation for 1.5 min at 95 °C; followed by 35 cycles with 30 sec at 94 °C, 45 sec at 64 °C, and 45 sec at 72 °C; and final elongation for 5 min at 72 °C. Analyse melting curves to ensure that only a single product was amplified. After amplifications, acquire the melting curves by heating the samples to 95 °C for 1 min, cooling to 55 °C for 1 min and then slowly increasing the temperature from 65 °C to 95 °C at the rate of 0.5 °C 10 sec-1, with continuous measurement of the fluorescence. Plot the CT values of each standard dilution series against the natural logarithm of the DNA concentration.",
    "Calculate the total amount of wheat DNA and fungal DNA with the gradient equation (f(x) = ax + b), according to the following formula (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001): imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171025/20171025224802_7194.jpgCalculate the average amount of F. graminearum in wheat roots and the infection percentage of root samples (relative fungal biomass) by using the reference gene-based DNA quantification method and formula published by Brunner et al. (2009). Finally, calculate the relative fungal biomass as the ratio between fungal and wheat root DNA quantity:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170316/20170316113128_5605.jpgWhere, total DNA is the sum of F. graminearum and wheat root DNA. Note: Calculate the average infection percentage as the average of the assayed technical and biological replicates. Fusarium root rot disease index (FDI)  The FDI incorporates all (or selected) severity parameter: relative fungal biomass; percentage change in root biomass, root length and shoot length; root and stem base symptom rating. Analogous to the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC; Buerstmayr et al., 2000), the FDI can be used to rank genotypes for their overall performance under disease conditions (Wang et al., 2015) or as phenotypic parameter in genetic studies (Rutkoski et al., 2012).Transfer the measured values of each severity parameter into dimensionless susceptibility index (SI) values to allow normalisation and direct comparison between different types of value. Calculate SI values using the equation: SI = (XTx)/(Y) Where, X represents the measured value for each genotype and timepoint (Tx), Y the corresponding overall mean calculated over all assayed genotypes and timepoints. Calculate the respective FDI values for each genotype and timepoint as the sum of SI values. Note: In time-course studies FDI values can be calculated for each sampling timepoint."
