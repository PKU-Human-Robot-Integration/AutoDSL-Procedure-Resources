    "Cultivate L. acidophilus cells in SDM broth containing 2% (w/v) carbohydrate substrate (we supplemented with carbohydrate substrate that is known to induce glycogen biosynthesis) at 37 °C to desired growth phase and harvest by centrifugation (1,717 x g, 10 min, room temperature). Cell pellets can be processed right after centrifugation or stored at -80 °C.Notes: In general, for early log (OD～0.3 to 0.4), mid-log (OD～0.6), stationary (OD～1.0 to 1.6) and late stationary phase cultures (OD～ ≥ 2.0), we harvest aliquots of ca. 50 ml, 30 ml, 20 ml and 15 ml, respectively, in disposable conical centrifuge tubes, to yield ca. 0.04 to 0.06 g of cell wet weight.  We prepare cultures and cell pellets representing at least two biological replicates in order to demonstrate reproducibility of the experimental results. Pre-label, pre-weigh (with cap on), and designate each 1.5-ml screw-capped tube for each sample.Resuspend each cell pellet in 1 ml of PBS and transfer to designated pre-weighed 1.5 ml screw-capped tube.Centrifuge (14,549 x g, 1 min, room temperature) and remove all supernatant with a pipettor.Repeat step 4 centrifugation for at least twice to remove all the supernatant in order to obtain an accurate cell wet weight.Weigh the tubes (with caps on) with the cell pellets. Subtract the previous weights of the empty tubes (with cap; from step 2 above) from the weight values to obtain net cell wet weight. Add 0.25 ml of 0.25 M Na2CO3 solution to the cell pellet. Resuspend by gentle vortexing.Note: Do not resuspend the cell pellet with a pipettor since any amount of cells adhering to the pipet tip will change the net cell wet weight.For controls: Include 2 additional tubes (no pre-weighing necessary). In each tube, add ～400 µg (e. g. 20 µl of 20 mg/ml) of glycogen to 0.25 ml of 0.",
    "25 M Na2CO3 solution. Follow steps 8-12.Incubate the cell suspensions at 95 to 98 °C for 4 h (We place the tubes securely in a microcentrifuge tube floating rack and incubate in a large beaker of water heated on a hot plate.).  Gently vortex to mix the cell suspension 1 to 2 times during the 4-h incubation.Add 0.15 ml of 1 M acetic acid and 0.6 ml of 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to the cell suspension to bring the pH to ～5.2 and the final volume to 1 ml.Add 10 µl of amyloglucosidase (0.14 U/µl) to the cell suspension (1.4 U/ml final concentration of amyloglucosidase).For controls: Into the two control tubes containing 400 µg of glycogen (see step 7), add 10 µl of amyloglucosidase to one tube (labeled as positive control) and 10 µl of sterile distilled water to the remaining tube (labeled as negative control).Incubate the tubes at 57 °C overnight with constant agitation (We seal the tubes with parafilm and incubate the tubes in a hybridization oven.).The next day, centrifuge the cell suspensions (5,000 x g, 3 min, room temperature) to pellet the cell debris.Measure the glucose released from the intracellular glycogen using a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-based glucose assay kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.  The resulting glucose concentration (mg of glucose in 1 ml of the sample from step 9) is used to calculate the intracellular glycogen content per g of cell wet weight (expressed as mg of glucose per g of cell wet weight)."
