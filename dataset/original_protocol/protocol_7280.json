    "Part I: Microbial gDNA isolation from mouse cecal content Collection of cecal content Dissect the mouse aseptically and carefully remove the cecum.Collect the cecal content in a sterile 2 mL microcentrifuge inside the laminar airflow to avoid any kind of environmental contamination. Label the sample properly. Immediately snap freeze the cecal content and store it at -80 °C for further use (Graphical abstract step 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212339_9747.pngGraphical abstract step 1. Collection of cecal content. Cecal DNA extraction Take the cecal sample from the -80 °C freezer and keep it on ice. Aseptically transfer 180–220 mg of cecal content into a sterile 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.Add 1 mL 1× sterile ice-cold PBS to the sample and homogenize it properly by vigorous vortexing and pipetting.Centrifuge the suspension at 1,500 × g for 5 min at room temperature (Graphical abstract step 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212620_4599.jpg Graphical abstract step 2. Centrifugation of the cecal sample. Carefully remove the supernatant. Add 600 μL of lysis buffer to the pellet and mix it properly by pipetting (Graphical abstract step 3).Note: Do not use vortex for mixing. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212453_8877.jpgGraphical abstract step 3. Lysis buffer addition. Keep the mixture at 70 °C for 30 min with intermittent mixing by inverting the microcentrifuge tube several times (Graphical abstract step 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212510_1869.jpg Graphical abstract step 4. Heating at 70 °C. Centrifuge the lysate at 15,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant in a sterile 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.Add 1 mL of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1) to the lysate and mix it properly for 2–3 min by inverting the tube approximately 12–15 times.Centrifuge the mixture at 15,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.Collect the upper aqueous phase in a new sterile 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat steps 7–9 at least twice, until the lysate is colorless.",
    "Add three volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol to the colorless lysate and gently mix by simultaneously inverting and rotating in a rotospin instrument for 5–10 min.Freeze the solution at -80 °C for at least 1 h. For better precipitation of DNA, keep it in the freezer for 4–5 h (Graphical abstract step 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212645_2368.jpg Graphical abstract step 5. Precipitation at -80 °C. Separate the precipitate by centrifugation at 15,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.Wash the pellet once with 700 μL of 70% ethanol and centrifuge at 15,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (Graphical abstract step 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212714_4788.jpg Graphical abstract step 6. Ethanol wash. Dry the pellet at room temperature for 20–30 min.Add 50–100 μL nuclease-free water to the pellet and mix it with gentle tapping.Add 5 μL of RNase A and keep at room temperature for 15 min.Repeat steps 10–15 to remove the RNase A and recover the pure microbial gDNA (Graphical abstract step 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212740_9478.jpg Graphical abstract step 7. Microbial gDNA. Immediately check the quality and quantity of the RNA, and store it in a -80 °C freezer.Part II: RNA extraction from mouse colonic tissue Collection of the colon tissue sample Dissect the mouse aseptically and cut the colon portion from the entire gut.Remove the colonic content by flushing with cold 1× sterile PBS.Cut the tissue (80–120 mg) into small pieces and store it in RNALater (1,800 μL) at a -20 °C freezer for further use.RNA extraction For RNA isolation of the colonic tissue, we use the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit with an additional step of churning the tissue with liquid nitrogen for better yield.Weight 20–30 mg (not more than 30 mg) of colonic tissue. Remove the remaining RNALater from the tissue sample using Kimwipes.Place the tissue sample in a mortar.",
    "Add ample liquid nitrogen and immediately churn the tissue with the pestle. Ensure that all liquid nitrogen evaporates before grinding (Graphical abstract step 8).Note: After step 2, follow the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit protocol. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212821_1357.jpg Graphical abstract step 8. Tissue grinding. Add 700 μL of RLT buffer to the mortar and mix the churned tissue with the buffer by pipetting.Transfer the lysate into a 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature.Carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting and add 1 volume of 70% ethanol to the lysate. Mix well by pipetting and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature.Carefully remove the supernatant and transfer up to 700 μL of the sample to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube.Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s at room temperature. After centrifugation, discard the flowthrough.Add 350 μL of Buffer RW1 to the RNeasy column, close lid, and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s at room temperature. After centrifugation, discard the flowthrough.Add 10 μL of DNase I stock solution to 70 μL of Buffer RDD and mix by gently inverting the tube. Give a brief spin.Add 80 μL of DNase I incubation mix directly to the RNeasy column membrane, and keep it at room temperature for 15 min (Graphical abstract step 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212854_5445.jpg Graphical abstract step 9. Column purification. Add 350 μL of Buffer RW1 to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s at room temperature. Discard the flowthrough.Add 500 μL of Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 s at room temperature. Discard the flowthrough.",
    "Add 500 μL of Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature. Discard the flowthrough.Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge at full speed for 1 min to dry the membrane.Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube.Add 30–50 μL of nuclease-free water directly to the spin column membrane. Wait for 2 min.Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature to elute the RNA.Immediately check the quality and quantity, and store the RNA in a -80 °C freezer (Graphical abstract step 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220802/20220802212912_8375.jpg Graphical abstract step 10.
