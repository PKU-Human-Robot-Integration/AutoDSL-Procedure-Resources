    "The corals used for the present study were Seriatopora caliendrum, which are cultured in our lab. All the corals were kindly provided by the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n1. Inspection and startup\nNOTE: Each module must be tested for tightness and function individually before assembling the system. Deionized water should be used to test the module's tightness. Commercial details of all the module components are provided in the Table of Materials.\nTightness test of the inter-module connection\n\t\nConnect all the modules and the pumps (Figure 1), and ensure the water flows circularly over the system for at least 30 min.\nCheck all the seams for possible leakage issues. If any leaking occurs in any of the bonding seams, apply bonding glue from the outside. If any leaking occurs in any of the connection seams, tighten the connection again, and check whether the sealing gasket needs to be changed.\nLoading\n\t\nAfter the tightness test, evacuate and dry the water inside.\nLoad the appropriate contents.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, the bacterial culture substrate is loaded into the microbial purification module, and the Chaetomorpha Algae is loaded into the algae purification module.\nAssembling and testing the whole system\n\t\nAfter loading, fix the modules onto the baseboard using the screws.\nConnect the inner circulation modules with the outer circulation ones (without the coral culture module).\nFor the seawater perfusion, inject the seawater through the water inlet in the seawater store module. When the water level is 3 cm higher than the water inlets of the pumps, switch on the pumps, and continue the injection of the seawater until the inner circulation modules are full of the seawater, with room for air (3 cm high) in the seawater store module.",
    "NOTE: The seawater is prepared using pure water and sea salt (see the Table of Materials).\nSystem test\n\t\nTurn on all the switches and set both the seawater pump voltages to 9 V. Set the water temperature to 25 °C.\nSet the cycle timer to \"1 minute on and 1 minute off\". Set all three channels of the three-channel timer to \"9:00 am on\" and \"5:00 pm off\".\nMonitor the system for at least 24 h for any malfunction. If no problem is found, then the system is ready for the next step of the operation.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to clear all the bubbles in all the modules except for the seawater store module. The whole system can be slightly lifted and shaken to move the bubbles from the module inlet to the outlet.\n2. Establishment of the microbial environment\nNOTE: Establishing a coral-friendly microbial environment is necessary before coral transplantation. In order to culture microorganisms in the system, especially in the microbial purification module, the diluted probiotic solution should be added as the microbial source for the nitrification system.\nAdding the microbiome source\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of the commercial microbiome source solution (see the Table of Materials) into 500 mL of seawater with stirring.\nInject 50 mL of the above diluted solution and 10 µL of the commercial coral nutrition solution (see the Table of Materials) into the circulation system.\nMicrobiome culture\n\t\nSwitch on the inner circulation pump and an air pump to culture the microbiome for 21 days. The microbiome oxygen content requirements determine the on-time and off-time proportions of the air pump.",
    "​NOTE: This step aims to culture the seawater purification microbiome and promote coral-beneficial microbiome growth in the system. In this process, the seawater starts to become muddy from the second day to the fourth day after the microbiome injection. After this microbiome culture process, the nutrient degradation capacity in the system should be established. It should be noted that to meet different experimental requirements, different microbiome sources can be used to establish the microbiome environment.\n3. Coral transplantation and growth\nCoral transplantation\n\t\nCut the raw coral branches with length scales of 3-5 cm, and then adhere these coral branches onto 3D-printed coral support bases (Supplementary Coding File 1).\nPut these coral branch samples back into the original seawater tank for at least 7 days for recovery.\nFix the coral support base onto the rotation unit with glue. Assemble the coral culture module, and connect it to the outer circulation loop.\nImaging the coral growth\n\tNOTE: The coral images over time need to be acquired to evaluate the coral growth. Using a demountable connection makes it convenient to remove the coral culture module from the whole system for imaging. To this end, a mini-photo studio with appropriate illuminating conditions is built. A camera with a macro lens (see the Table of Materials) is used to capture the coral surface morphologies in different periods. The coral rotation unit in the culture module can be operated outside the module using non-contact mode. By rotating the magnetic handle adjacent to the module, full-angle coral images can be captured.\n\t\nPlace the camera on the top of the studio, and capture the images from a vertical view.\nPlace the coral culture module in the mini-photo studio with the coral positioned in the center and at the bottom.\nCapture the coral images by rotating the outside handle.",
    "​NOTE: For coral survival reasons, the time period of imaging should be limited to 15 min.\n4. System routine maintenance\nNOTE: The routine maintenance includes leakage inspection, malfunction inspection, additive addition, and seawater exchange.\nLeakage inspection\n\t\nInspect the baseboard for water stains or droplets. As the system's cover shell is transparent, visually inspecting the water leakage is easy and convenient. This inspection must be performed every day.\nMalfunction inspection\n\t\nEnsure that this step includes the inspection of the water temperature, pumps, light voltages, air pump status, and timer status, including visually checking and recording the set water temperature, real-time temperature, transformer output voltages, UV lamp settings, and timer working status. This inspection should be performed every day.\n\t\tNOTE: Certain system malfunctions can be diagnosed based on abnormal sounds or unusual temperatures.\nAdditive addition\n\tNOTE: Additive addition is the process of adding nutrients and other reagents into the system.\n\t\nFor example, extract 10 mL of the seawater using a syringe from the three-way valve between the activated charcoal module and seawater module.\nDissolve the additives in the extracted seawater.\nInject the solution back into the system through the three-way valve. In real cases, the types, amounts, and addition frequencies of the additives are decided by the system seawater quality, considering the experimental requirements.\nWater exchange\n\tNOTE: Routine water exchange can reduce toxic concentration and eutrophication in the culture system. If the experimental conditions allow, exchanging the seawater can be a routine operation.\n\t\nSwitch off the power for the whole system, and unplug the power cable for safety reasons.\nRemove the coral culture module.\nConnect the outside wastewater pipeline to the outlet in the seawater store module.\nRotate the system, and place the system front-side down.\nSwitch on the outlet. Let the inside seawater flow out of the system.",
    "NOTE: Do not use any pump to draw the water out since the inside negative pressure may damage the system.\nDischarge an appropriate amount of seawater, and switch off the outlet. The amount of discharged seawater is decided by the physiological state of the corals.\nReset the system, and inject the newly prepared seawater into the system through the water inlet.\nInstall the coral culture module back into the system.\nSwitch on the system power, and wait until the whole system goes back to normal.\n5. Module replacement\nNOTE: If any module needs to be replaced due to malfunction or according to the experimental arrangement, it is important to change the module without suspending or negatively affecting the culture experiment.\nFor the seawater store module, algae purification module, microbial purification module, or activated charcoal purification module, switch off the inner circulation pump, and loosen the fixing screws for the module.\nDisconnect the pipelines between the two joined modules, and disassemble the module to be replaced from the system. The final step is to assemble the new module into the system by connecting the pipelines and retightening the fixing screws.\n\tNOTE: The replacement of the temperature control module is somehow different. First, all the wires need to be disconnected from the module. The fixing bolts are then unscrewed, and the pipelines are disconnected. Afterward, the heating panel is dismounted, and the module is disassembled from the system. The installation process for the temperature control module is the reverse process.\n6. Shutting down the system and restoring the system to its initial state\nNOTE: The system will eventually be shut down after the necessary coral culture experiment. The system needs to be restored to its original state.\nShutting down the system\n\t\nSwitch off the system power, and unplug the power cable.",
    "Evacuate the seawater inside the system.\nDisassemble the modules in the following order: the coral culture module, the activated charcoal purification module, the seawater store module, the algae purification module, the microbial purification module, the UV lamp, the two circulation pumps, and the temperature control module.\nSystem restoration\n\t\nClean all the modules with pure water and surface active agents (see the Table of Materials).\nSterilize the modules with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not use any organic solvent to wash the modules.\nDry the modules at 40 °C for 12 h. Ensure that all the water inside the system is evaporated.\nClean all the pipelines and valves using the same surface active agents.\n7. Modification for the controlled microorganism environment\nNOTE: Aside from the coral culture experiment, for certain special experiments, such as acquiring a controlled microorganism environment in the system, the microbiome species and abundance must be strictly controlled. The most innovative feature of our coral culture system is that the coral's physiological activity can be explored in a specific microbial environment in a relatively closed micro-ecosystem. Performing this function requires a different operating procedure.\nPre-sterilization\n\t\nSterilize all the modules, pipelines, and valves using 3% hydrogen peroxide solution before assembling the system.\nSterilize the bacterial culture substrate via autoclaving.\nSterilize Chaetomorpha algae with 75% ethanol solution, and dry it using sterile paper.\nSystem modification and sterilization\n\t\nIn assembling the system, add an air sterilizing filter (see the Table of Materials) between the air pump and the seawater store module.\nAdd a water sterilizing filter between the inlet and the three-way valve. This step ensures the air and water injected into the system are sterilized.\nIntroduce ozone into the system to eliminate the remaining microbiome.",
    "Wash off the remaining disinfectant agents with sterile seawater three times, and inject the sterile seawater into the system.\nFor only the establishment of the microbial environment, inject the microbiome source solution through the water outlet.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use the water inlet to inject the microbiome source. Other reagents and seawater are still injected through the water inlet.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
