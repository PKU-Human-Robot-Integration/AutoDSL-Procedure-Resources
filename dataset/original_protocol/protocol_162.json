    "Cell culture for obtaining extracellular amastigotes:\nCAUTION\\! Trypanosoma cruzi is a highly infectious protozoan parasite, classified as a biosafety-level \\(BSL) 2 organism, thus a proper training is required before starting any of the experiments described here. All the experiments have to be done inside of a Class II biological safety cabinet and using adequate personal protection equipment \\(PPE).\n1. Seed 5x10<sup>6</sup> LLC-MK2 cells in sterile 150 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks with 20 mL of complete DMEM. \n  2. Grow the cells for 3-4 days in the BOD incubator \\(37C, 5% CO2). At this point the culture should reach confluency of about 2x10<sup>7</sup> cells per flask.\n  3. Change the medium with 20 mL of fresh complete DMEM and then infect the LLC-MK2 cells with 1x10<sup>8</sup> trypomastigotes/flask\n  4. Grow the cells for four more days in the BOD incubator and harvest the supernatant, containing a mixture of trypomastigotes \\(about 72%) and amastigotes \\(about 28%), into a conical 50-ml centrifuge tube.\n  5. Centrifuge the cells at 4,000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C.  \n  6. Discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet at 1x10<sup>8</sup> parasites/mL with fresh DMEM medium.\n  7. Incubate the parasite mixture in the BOD incubator for 2 days. At this point, up to 94% parasites have been transformed into amastigotes. \n  8. Centrifuge the cells at 4,000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C.  \n  9. Incubate the cells again for 3 more hours at BOD incubator. This process helps to remove some remaining trypomastigotes, since they swim into the supernatant and the amastigotes stay in the bottom of the centrifuge tube.\n  10.  Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in PSG at 1x10<sup>8</sup> parasites/mL. At this point, cells are ready to be purified by anion-exchange chromatography.\n  \nCell culture for obtaining intracellular amastigotes:",
    "1. Seed 5x10<sup>6</sup> LLC-MK2 cells in sterile plastic tissue 150 cm2 culture flasks with 20 mL of complete DMEM.\n  2. Grow the cells for 3-4 days in the BOD incubator until they become confluent. \n  3. Change the medium with 20 mL fresh complete DMEM and then infect the LLC-MK2 cells with 1x108 trypomastigotes/flask.\n  4. Grow the cells for 3 more days in the BOD incubator. \n  5. Detach the cells by gently scraping them in 5 mL PBS. \n  6. Disrupted the host cells by using gentle MACS Dissociator with M tubes \\(Miltenyi Biotec, USA), or by passing the cells once through a 27-gauge needle connected to a 30-mL syringe.\n  7. Centrifuge for 800 xg for 10 min at 4°C to remove the large host-cell debris.  \n  8. Collect the supernatant, centrifuge for 4,000 xg for 5 min at 4°C, and resuspend the cells in PBS/BSA 10%.\n  9. Incubate in the BOD incubator for 2 hours.\n  10. Centrifuge the cells at 4,000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C.  \n  11. Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL PBS, remove 20 µL and dilute 1:10 in PBS/paraformaldehyde 10%. Count the cells in a hemocytometer.\n  \nPurification of amastigotes by anion-exchange chromatography:\nRationale: \nAmastigotes suspension is passed through the anion-exchange column to separate them from host-cell debris and trypomastigotes. In this experiment, negative charges of the parasite surface, mainly due to the sialic acid content, interact or bind to positively charged DE52 medium. Since the content of sialic acid of trypomastigotes is higher, this parasite form strongly binds to the resin, whereas the amastigotes, which have no \\(intracellular forms) or less \\(extracellular forms) sialic acid content, bind only weakly to the positively charged column.\n1. Prepared the column support with a 30 ml-syringe and a small piece of glass wool in the bottom.",
    "2. Add 10 mL of pre-swollen resin microgranular anion-exchange resin DE52 diethylaminoethyl cellulose. \n  3. Equilibrate the column twice with 50 ml PSG, by passing the buffer by gravity.\n  4. Load the parasites with 20 mL PSG, by gravity.\n  5. Wash the column with 20 mL PSG to remove host-cell debris.\n  6.  Elute and collect the amastigotes with 20 mL PSG.\n  7.  Centrifuge the cells at 4,000 xg for 10 min at 4°C.  \n  8. Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL PBS, remove 20 µL and dilute 1:10 in PBS/paraformaldehyde 10%. Count the cells in a hemocytometer."
