    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The following steps describe how to isolate neutrophils from fresh human\n      blood.\n    \nNeutrophil isolation\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\n      This step describes the isolation of the neutrophils from human blood\n      using a double-gradient Percoll separation starting from 10 mL of\n      blood.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] The blood was drawn in 10 mL Sodium\n      Heparin vacutainer tubes. Volumes can be adjusted depending on sample\n      availability.\n    \nNote: All reagents should be brought at\n      room temperature (20–25°C). All procedures should be performed in a\n      biosafety cabinet.\n    \n        Add 10 mL 75% Percoll into a 50 mL Conical tube using sterile\n        serological pipette.\n      \n        Carefully overlay 10 mL 62% Percoll on top of 75% Percoll using sterile\n        serological pipette.\n      \n        Dilute 10 mL fresh blood 1:1 in 10 mL of serum-free RPMI 1640 without\n        antibiotics.\n      \n        Carefully overlay 20 mL of diluted blood on top of the 62% Percoll using\n        a sterile serological pipette in a dropwise manner (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), thus bringing to a total volume of 40 mL.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2931-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Neutrophils separation from human blood following\n              overlay on Percoll gradient and centrifugation\n            \n              (A) Drawing and pictures of double layer Percoll gradient before\n              (left) and after (right) centrifugation.\n            \n              (B) After Percoll gradient, neutrophils are identified in\n              neutrophils layer between the two Percoll layers. (i.) Few\n              low-density granulocytes can be found in the layer between serum\n              and Percoll (ii.) Granulocytes (neutrophils + eosinophils) can be\n              found between the Percoll layers.\n            \nNote: Volumes can be adjusted depending on\n      the amount of blood drawn per donor. We recommend that the amount of\n      diluted blood overlaid is not greater than 1.5 times the volume of the\n      Percoll gradient. For instance, 15 mL of drawn blood (i.e. 30 mL of RPMI\n      1640 diluted blood) can be overlaid on a gradient of 10 mL of 75% Percoll",
    "and 10 mL of 62% Percoll. This protocol can be adapted also to a 15 mL\n      conical tube.\n    \n        Centrifuge the 50 mL conical tubes at 200 × g for 25 min and\n        400 × g for 15 min.\n      \nNote: Perform above step with acceleration\n      and deceleration set to zero on the centrifuge.\n    \n        Carefully remove tubes following centrifugation so not to disrupt the\n        gradient. The separation of cells and respective bands are shown in\n        Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\n        \n            Use sterile transfer pipettes or micropipettes to first collect\n            peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on top of the 62% Percoll\n            layers.\n          \n            Then use sterile transfer pipettes or micropipettes to collect\n            neutrophils positioned between the 75% and 62% Percoll layers and\n            transfer the cells to a new 50 mL Conical tube.\n          \nNote: PBMCs population is positioned on\n      top of the 62% Percoll layer. If appropriately performed, red blood cells\n      (RBCs) should form a pellet underneath the 75% Percoll layer. Ensure\n      careful collection of neutrophils without disrupting the RBC layer.\n    \n        Add RPMI 1640 to the tube up to a volume of 50 mL. Wash the neutrophils\n        by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min.\n      \n        Remove the supernatant completely and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL\n        of neutrophil buffer.\n      \n        Add 10 μL of cell suspension to a disposable hemocytometer and count the\n        cell number under the microscope.\n      \nNote: This protocol typically yields an\n      average (± SD) of 2.15 × 10+6 (± 0.54 × 10+6)\n      neutrophils/mL blood. Neutrophils can be resuspended at 1.0 × 10+6\n      cells/mL in neutrophil buffer. In the case that the yield is lesser than\n      above mentioned, adjust volume of resuspension in neutrophil buffer\n      accordingly, to obtain desired cell concentrations. Cells can be further\n      diluted with neutrophil buffer prior to counting.\n    \nCritical: In order to obtain good",
    "separation, ensure careful overlay of the 62% Percoll on top of the 75%\n      Percoll layer, and subsequent careful overlay of diluted blood on top of\n      the 62% Percoll layer.\n    \nCytospin and staining\nTiming: 1–2 h\n      This part of the protocol describes the steps involved in cytospin. These\n      steps allow us to examine the morphology of the neutrophils after Percoll\n      gradient-based isolation.\n    \n        Place cytospin filter paper on top of the microscope slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Place the cytofunnel on top of the filter paper, making sure the\n        holes are aligned.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2931-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2.

Representative image (scale bar: 25 μm) is shown.\n            \n        Place the slide, filter paper and cytofunnel into the cytoclip with the\n        cardboard filters facing the center of the cytospin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n      \n        Aliquot 1.0–2.0 × 10+5 neutrophils in a volume of 100 μL into\n        the well of the cytofunnel and slide set (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \n        Carefully place the cytoclip into the cytocentrifuge and spin at\n        800 × g for 5 min at 20–25°C.\n      \nNote: Ensure proper balance of the\n      cytofunnel slide set on the cytocentrifuge.\n    \n        Following centrifugation, carefully open the cytoclip set and remove the\n        filters from their slides.\n      \nNote: Ensure minimal physical contact with\n      cell smears on the slides. Examine each slide under the microscope to\n      ensure cells have attached well to the slide.\n    \nAir dry the slide at 20–25°C for 20 min.\n        Stain the slide with May Grünwald stain solution for 5 min at 20–25°C\n        and transfer the slide to 1× PBS for 1.5 min.",
    "Stain the slide with diluted Giemsa stain solution (1:20 with Ultrapure\n        H2O) for 20 min at 20–25°C.\n      \n        Wash the slide under running Ultrapure H2O until clean.\n      \n        Air dry the stained slide at 20–25°C. Mount the slide by adding 1 drop\n        of VectaMount mounting medium to the center of the cells and then put\n        the coverslip on top (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\n      \n        Cells can now be imaged using a light microscope with recommended\n        magnifications of 40×/100× magnification, and their morphological\n        characteristics can be evaluated (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\n        Note: Neutrophils stained with May Grünwald stain and Giemsa\n        stain appear with light purple/pink cytoplasmic granules with violet\n        color of multi-lobed nuclei respectively.\n      \nAntibody titration\nTiming: 1–2 h\n      This step describes the titration of antibodies for flow cytometry. These\n      steps will enable identification of optimal concentrations of antibodies\n      for use in flow cytometry assays.\n    \nNote: This section of the protocol\n      describes steps involved in optimizing the neutrophil-related flow\n      cytometry panel and is recommended to be performed beforehand. Titrations\n      and dilutions recommended in this protocol are manufacturer specific and\n      could potentially vary between different lot numbers.\n    \n        Add 0.5–1 × 10+6 neutrophils in 100 μL neutrophil buffer per\n        well in a 96-well U-bottom plate or per tube in round-bottom polystyrene\n        tubes.\n      \nNote: These titrations are valid for a\n      total of 0.5–1 × 10+6 neutrophils per sample.\n    \n        Centrifuge the plate (with lid on) or tubes at 300 × g for 5 min\n        at 4°C.\n      \n        Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL FACS buffer + Fc Block\n        (diluted 1:100 in FACS buffer) for 20 min on ice or at 4°C.\n      \n        Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.
