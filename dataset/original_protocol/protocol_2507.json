Depending on the frozen stock this may require 1–2 weeks. For simplicity here we assume they require 1 week. Once they reach mid log phase, bacteria are exposed as live, highly viable bacteria to a monolayer of HMEC-1, or are first heat-inactivated and then added onto the HMEC-1.\nAdd 9 mL of complete BSK-H medium on a 15 mL falcon tube.\nFurther add 1.5 mL of frozen with glycerol Bb stock culture.\nPlace the tube at 33°C until the concentration of Bb reaches 2–5 × 106 bacteria/mL (mid log phase).\nNote: Typically, this will take approximately one to two weeks, but precise timing depends on the freezing method and the specific Bb strain used. For counting bacteria either use darkfield microscopy or (epi)fluorescence microscopy if Bb constitutively expresses GFP. To precisely count their number, use a hemocytometer or another type of counting chamber.\nOnce you reach that number, dilute the Bb solution to 1 × 103 bacteria/mL.\nGrow Bb in fresh complete BSK-H at 33°C until a density of approximately 5 × 107 Bb/mL is reached, in which case highly viable Bb can be exposed to host cells.",
    "Note: How many Bb you need will ultimately depend on your desired multiplicity of infection (MOI). Herein we seed ECs on glass coverslips (or hydrogels built on them) of 24-well plates. To achieve a confluent monolayer, we aim for 4 × 105 cells the day of infection. Thus, to achieve an MOI of 10 Bb/cell in each well one needs to add 4 × 106 Bb. After counting, spirochetes should be added to ECs as quick as possible to avoid aggregation or clumping of Bb.\nTo prepare heat-inactivated Bb, incubate the desired amount of bacteria from step 5 at 56°C for 30 min.\nSubsequently, store heat-inactivated Bb at 4°C.\nCritical: This step is critical to avoid drastic damage of the Bb membrane or morphology that can occur at lower temperatures (e.g., −20°C).\nManufacturing of 3 kPa polyacrylamide hydrogels for EC seeding—Days 7–8\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThe protocol below describes how to activate glass coverslips of 24-well glass bottom plates to then build 3 kPa double-layered polyacrylamide hydrogels with embedded tracer beads to conduct traction force microscopy (TFM) as well as how to sterilize them, coat them with collagen I, and equilibrate them prior to EC seeding (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2140-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of the specific steps for building polyacrylamide hydrogels to perform TFM on ECs exposed to Bb\n(A) Glass coverslips are chemically treated to allow subsequent polyacrylamide hydrogel attachment.\n(B) 3.6 μL of polyacrylamide Solution 1 is placed on each glass coverslip of the multi-well plate.\n(C) Solution 1 is sandwiched with a 12-mm circular glass coverslip.\n(D) Coverslip is removed with a hooked needle syringe until polymerization occurs.\n(E) 2.4 μL of polyacrylamide Solution 2 with tracer beads is added on top of the bottom layer.\n(F) Solution 2 is sandwiched with a 12-mm circular glass coverslip.",
    "(G) Water is added, and the coverslip is removed.\n(H) UV exposure for 1 h ensures sterilization.\n(I) Sulfo-SANPAH solution is added on the hydrogels and irradiation under UV for 10 min is followed.\n(J) Hydrogels are washed with HEPES and incubated for 16–18 h with collagen I.\n(K) Hydrogel is equilibrated with cell culture medium.\n(L) HMEC-1 are seeded and allowed to form a monolayer for 24 h.\nActivation of glass coverslips of 24-well glass bottom plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAdd 500 μL of 1 M NaOH on glass coverslips of 24-well glass bottom plates (13 mm-diameter wells) and incubate at 21°C–24°C for 30 min.\nRinse the wells once with ultrapure water.\nAdd 500 μL of 2% (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane in 95% ethanol to each well and incubate at 21°C–24°C for 5 min.\nRinse the wells once with ultrapure water.\nAdd 500 μL of 0.5% glutaraldehyde in water to each well and incubate at 21°C–24°C for 30 min to 2 h.\nRinse the wells once with ultrapure water.\nDry the coverslips by placing the multi-well plate on a 60°C warm metal plate with the lid of the plate slightly off, or at 21°C–24°C until dry.\nCritical: Make sure that the temperature is not higher than 60°C, otherwise the plastic of the multi-well plate will melt.\nPause point: You can store the activated glass coverslips and build the hydrogels at a later point. In that case you do not need to dry them, water will evaporate over time.\nFabrication of two-layered 3 kPa polyacrylamide hydrogels and hydrogel sterilization (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2H).\nIn 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes prepare two aqueous solutions (thereon referred as Solution 1) that contain 5% acrylamide and 0.1% bisacrylamide, by adding in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube 152.6 μL water, 23.125 μL of 40% acrylamide, and 9.25 μL of 2% bisacrylamide.",
    "Note: You can make hydrogels of different stiffnesses by adjusting the concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide accordingly.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCritical: The solvent can impact the final stiffness of the hydrogel as pH can impact the polymerization reaction. We used water as the solvent as in other studies8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and previously performed atomic force microscopy measurements to confirm that the expected and resulting stiffness of the hydrogels is similar.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nIn 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes prepare two more aqueous solutions (thereon referred as Solution 2) that contain 5% acrylamide, 0.1% bisacrylamide and 0.04% of 0.2 μm tracer fluorescent beads, by adding in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube 149.6 μL water, 23.125 μL of 40% acrylamide, 9.25 μL of 2% bisacrylamide and 3 μL of 0.2 μm tracer fluorescent beads.\nOptional: Degas all four solutions using vacuum for 15 min to eliminate oxygen that inhibits polymerization.\nPipet 1.2 μL of 10% APS stock and 0.8 μL of TEMED to Solution 1 to initiate polymerization and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nImmediately after add 3.6 μL of Solution 1 to the center of each glass coverslip of the 24-well dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAct fast and using your forceps cover/sandwich the polyacrylamide droplets with a 12 mm untreated circular coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nLet Solution 1 sit for 20 min or until it fully polymerizes.\nCritical: If the solution in the tube polymerizes before you manage to cover all wells of the 24-well plate, then you can activate Solution 1 in the second “backup” tube you previously prepared and repeat the above steps so that all wells of the 24-well plate are processed. I.e., you can add polyacrylamide Solution 1 from the first tube to the number of wells you can manage (e.g., 6 wells), and the \"backup\" tube can be used for the remaining wells.",
    "Gently tap a syringe needle to a surface to create a small hook at its tip to facilitate the removal of the coverslips.\nLift all the coverslips using the syringe needle and your forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: Do not add water to facilitate the removal of the coverslip as you will build an additional polyacrylamide layer with tracer beads on top. To our hands the coverslip can be easily removed using the “hooked” syringe (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Note that others pre-treat the coverslip with Sigmacote to render it hydrophobic and thus more easily be able to remove it.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nPipet 1.2 μL of 10% APS stock and 0.8 μL of TEMED to Solution 2 (with the tracer beads) to initiate polymerization and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nImmediately after add 2.4 μL of Solution 2 to the center of each hydrogel built on the well of the 24-well dish but without touching the gels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCover Solution 2 with 12-mm circular glass coverslips and gently press downwards using a pair of forceps to ensure the thickness of the second layer is minimal (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: You can measure the thickness of the hydrogels experimentally through phase contrast microscopy by focusing on the upper surface of the glass coverslip and on the surface of the hydrogel. On our hands thickness is 30 +/- 5 μm and is mostly attributed to the first layer since tracer beads are all focused on one focal plane at the uppermost surface of the hydrogel.\nLet Solution 2 polymerize for 20 min.\nCritical: If the solution polymerizes before you cover all wells of the multi-well plate, then use the second tube you prepared of Solution 2 and repeat previous steps.",
    "Add 200 μL of water to each of the wells to facilitate subsequent removal of the glass coverslips using your hooked syringe needle and forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nAdd 1 mL of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 to each of the wells to keep the hydrogels hydrated.\nUV-expose the hydrogels for 1 h in the tissue culture hood to allow sterilization making sure the lid of the multi-well plate is inverted too (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nPause point: You can store the plate with the hydrogels at 4°C indefinitely. However, it is advisable to place parafilm around the plate to avoid evaporation of the buffer and subsequent dehydration of the hydrogels.\nActivation, protein coating and equilibration of hydrogels (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I–2K).\nWeigh 10 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4′-azido-2′-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (Sulfo-SANPAH) and place it in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nNote: Sulfo-SANPAH powder should be stored at −20°C and solution should be made fresh.\nAdd 100 μL DMSO and mix well so the Sulfo-SANPAH powder is dissolved.\nAdd 10 mL 50 mM HEPES pH = 7.5 and mix well.\nRemove the HEPES buffer from the hydrogels and add 200 μL of the Sulfo-SANPAH solution on the hydrogels.\nImmediately expose them to UV (302 nm) for 10 min to activate them (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nNote: The lamp we used supplies a power of 8 Watts while the distance to the drawer where the plate with the hydrogels was placed is 5 cm. However, note that lamps “age” which leads to a reduction in resulting power.\nCritical: Doublecheck that UV wavelength is 302 nm. After UV exposure the solution should turn dark brown (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nWhile UV-exposing the hydrogels, prepare 5 mL of 0.25 mg/mL solution of rat tail collagen I in 50 mM of HEPES pH=7.5.",
    "Wash the hydrogels twice with 1 mL of 50 mM HEPES pH = 7.5.\nNote: Repeat if needed to ensure that any excess crosslinker is removed.\nAdd 200 μL of the 0.25 mg/mL rat tail collagen I in 50 mM of HEPES on each hydrogel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nIncubate the hydrogels, with the collagen solution on top for 16–18 h at 21°C–24°C.\nNote: To prevent dehydration/evaporation, place the multi-well plates in a secondary containment and add laboratory cleaning tissues soaked in water in the inner periphery of the containment.\nNext day wash once with PBS buffer to remove excess collagen.\nEquilibrate hydrogels with cell culture media at 37°C for 30 min to 1 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nNote: You can use an epifluorescence or confocal microscope to measure the thickness of the hydrogels which you might need if you wish to perform TFM. To do so locate the z positions of the bottom (where the glass surface is) and top planes of the hydrogel (where the fluorescent beads' intensity is maximum). Then, subtract the z positions to determine the height. Also measure the depth of the tracer beads in reference to the upper surface of the gels, as this will affect the displacement of the beads and needs to be taken into account when performing TFM. On our hands the resulting thickness of the hydrogels is 30 μm +/- 5 μm and mainly results from the bottom layer without tracer beads. Even if a slightly higher volume of Solution I is added, the resulting thickness will be similar with this probably due to surface energy and adhesive forces between the glass and liquid solution. The second layer with the tracer beads should be thin enough so that beads are confined into a single focal plane as noted above.",
    "Note: You can also perform atomic force microscopy (AFM) to confirm the exact stiffness of the hydrogels.\nEC seeding on hydrogels, time-lapse microscopy and exposure to Bb—Days 8–9\nTiming: 2–4 h\nOnce hydrogels are equilibrated, ECs are seeded on them and incubated for 24 h to form a confluent cell monolayer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L). The multi-well plate is then transferred into the insert stage of an epifluorescence microscope and time-lapse imaging recordings are conducted. Around 5 h post-initiation of the recordings live or heat inactivated Bb spirochetes are added and the recording continues for 24 h post-exposure. If TFM is performed, at the end of the recording sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is added to acquire a reference image of the tracer beads in undeformed hydrogels where cells have been removed from the hydrogel surface.\nSeeding of ECs on the hydrogels and staining of EC nuclei with Hoechst to characterize cell kinematics (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2140-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Times pre- and post-exposure (h post-exposure, hpe) are indicated. MOI is 67 bacteria/cell.\n(B) Columns show: phase contrast image of HMEC-1, fluorescence of 0.2 μm red fluorescent tracer beads and Bb-GFP fluorescence before (upper row) and after (bottom row) Bb-GFP exposure. Times pre- and post-exposure (hpe) are indicated. MOI is 22 bacteria/cell.\nDetach the cells from their culture vessel using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and seed them on the hydrogels.\nFirst wash the cells and their culture flask once with sterile PBS.\nAdd the appropriate amount of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (2 mL on a 75-cm flask).\nIncubate the flask at 37°C for 5–10 min to allow the detachment of the cells from their substrate.",
    "Neutralize the trypsin by adding 10 mL of cell culture medium containing FBS.\nPipet gently to break up the clumps of cells, and then place the solution into a conical centrifuge tube.\nTake out 10 μL of the solution and very gently fill out the chamber underneath the coverslip of a glass hemocytometer to count cells.\nPellet down the solution of cells contained in the conical centrifuge tube using centrifugation for 5 min at 200 × g.\nDuring the 5 min waiting period, count the cells using the hemocytometer.\nAlternatives: Use an automatic cell counter.\nRemove the liquid out of the conical centrifuge tube while ensuring that the cell pellet is not disrupted.\nResuspend the cells in the MCDB-131 full medium at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/mL.\nSeed the cells in suspension on the hydrogels by first removing the medium with which the hydrogels were incubated and then adding 1 mL of cell suspension on each hydrogel.\nNote: If you do not plan to do TFM and just want to characterize changes in EC motility, you can place ECs on glass coverslips coated with collagen I. Just mix 1:100 collagen I solution (stock concentration is 3.1 mg/mL) in PBS and add 500 μL of the solution in each well of the multi-well plate. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C. After one wash with PBS, you can seed the glass coverslip with ECs as you would on hydrogels.\nLet cells reside on the hydrogels for 24 h so they form a confluent monolayer.\nStain the EC nuclei with Hoechst and place live-microscopy medium on the wells.\nPrior to the initiation of the microscopy recording prepare a solution of 1 μg/mL Hoechst in cell culture media.\nRemove the media from the cells and add 1 mL of Hoechst containing media.",
    "Place the multi-well plate in the incubator for 10 min.\nCritical: Depending on your EC type you might need to adjust the concentration of Hoechst or reduce the incubation time or both. For example, for staining the nuclei of primary HUVECs we determined that a 100-fold lower concentration of Hoechst followed by a 5 min incubation are optimal for this cell type (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nAspirate out the Hoechst containing medium and wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL warm live-microscopy medium by supplementing Leibovitz’s L-15 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/mL of EGF, and 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone as indicated above.\nInitiation of acquisition of time-lapse images of cells and tracer beads.\nTurn on your epifluorescence (or confocal microscope) and make sure the microscope incubator’s temperature is set at 37°C for at least 30 min prior to the start of the microscopy recording.\nPlace the multi-well plate on the appropriate insert on the stage of your microscope.\nFind the focal plane where the tracer beads are located in each well and make sure they look evenly dispersed in the field of view to be imaged (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nNote: Especially if you are beginner in TFM, you might want to consider inspecting the hydrogels immediately after they are built and prior to activation with Sulfo-SANPAH. Hydrogels where beads’ are not evenly distributed can be excluded from further processing.\nEnsure the cells form a confluent monolayer and mark the specific position.\nDepending on how many replicate wells you want to track and how many conditions you desire to test mark different positions across the 24-well plate.\nNote: We typically mark two positions per well so that a total of 48 positions are marked but that also depends on the conditions tested.",
    "Critical: Make sure your microscope’s autofocus system is on to avoid potential drift in the normal (z-direction) over time. If drift occurs in the x-y direction it can be corrected, but there is no way to correct for drift in the z-direction.\nIn the acquisition settings select the time interval to be 10 min (images acquired every 10 min).\nSelect multi-channel acquisition and use a DAPI filter cube to image the cell nuclei, a GFP cube to image the GFP-expressing bacteria which will be added and an mCherry filter cube to image the tracer beads (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nNote: The filter cubes you will use depend on the color of the tracer beads you will choose and on the type of fluorescent protein your bacteria express. In our case power was set to 10% and the exposure time to 100 ms, when using a 40 × 0.60 NA Plan Fluor air objective. The microscope filters excitation/emission) used for DAPI, mCherry and GFP are 350/460, 470/525 nm and 530/645 nm, respectively. Note that we performed separate recordings to follow the nuclei of ECs and different ones to follow the tracer beads (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). However, one could also simultaneously follow the tracer beads and EC nuclei. However, it might be pertinent to acquire two z-stacks at each instance of time one at the place where the tracer beads’ intensity is maximum and one where the nuclei intensity is maximum.\nInitiate the time-lapse image acquisition.\nExposure of ECs to Bb-GFP during microscopy recording.\nApproximately 5 h post-initiation of video-microscopy, spin down (5 min at 2,000 × g) the desired volume of live or heat-inactivated Bb-GFP depending on the MOI you want to achieve.",
    "Note: If you want to achieve an MOI of 10 Bb/cell in each well and assuming your ECs have doubled in each well (i.e., you have 8 × 105 cells per well), one needs to add 8 × 106 Bb.\nWash the pellet once with PBS to remove the BSK culture media and spin down the bacteria for 5 min at 2,000 × g.\nResuspend the bacteria in such a volume of PBS so that in each well of your 24-well plate you only add 10 μL of bacterial suspension.\nNote: For a MOI of 10 Bb/cell resuspend 8 × 106 Bb in 10 μL PBS.\nWhen image acquisition stops and while you still have 10 min until next time point, carefully remove the lid of the multi-well plate.\nAdd 10 μL of bacterial suspension in PBS aiming to release the droplet at the center of the well without disturbing the plate.\nNote: We did this because we wanted to record cells several hours prior to exposure and continue recording after exposure to pathogens too. Therefore, we wanted to avoid manipulation and displacement of the plate sitting in the microscope insert stage.\nAdd 10 μL of PBS alone on the control wells (no bacteria, vehicle control).\nPlace the lid back and allow the time-lapse imaging to continue for approximately 24 h.\nNote: Be careful when removing/returning the lid, as this can disturb the focal plane along the z-axis which cannot be corrected for.\nAcquisition of reference image of tracer beads.\nOnce you end the microscopy recording, carefully remove the lid of your multi-well plate.\nAdd 500 μL of 10% SDS in water in each of the wells.",
    "Through the phase contrast image make sure that the cells have detached from the surface of the hydrogel and thus, the elastic hydrogel has returned to its initial undeformed state.\nTake a fluorescence image of the tracer beads using the same power and exposure time as during time-lapse imaging. This will serve as the reference image of the beads in the undeformed hydrogel.\nCharacterization of EC kinematics and hydrogel displacements using particle image velocimetry—Days 9–10\nTiming: 2–10 h\nThe steps herein describe how to characterize EC displacements based on the images of the host EC nuclei and the displacements of the tracer beads within the hydrogel to calculate cell traction and monolayer stresses. In both cases we use a particle image velocimetry (PIV)-like technique to find EC and extracellular matrix (ECM) displacements.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] The codes with example data can be found at https://github.com/ebastoun[href=https://github.com/ebastoun]. All scripts and functions are written in MATLAB (MathWorks).\nFirst, use the images of the EC nuclei to characterize changes in EC kinematics before and after exposure to Bb (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2140-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Use the appropriate window size and overlap depending on the objective you used and the size of your nuclei.\nNote: We followed HMEC-1 nuclei that are ∼10 μm diameter, used a 40× objective and the resulting calibration factor of the images was fcal=0.18 μm/pixel. We thus used windows of 48 pixels with an overlap of 24 pixels for running the urapiv.m function.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] The size of the windows/overlap depends on the size of the moving objects, the texture within the image and the magnitude of displacements the objects are undergoing from frame to frame. Too small windows will improve the resolution of the PIV but might introduce noise while too big windows might smoothen the resulting motions and will reduce resolution.\nFor each experiment run the run_PIV.m script which calls the urapiv.m function to calculate the displacement vectors and store them as .txt files.\nAfter generating and storing the .txt files you can inspect the vector displacements (ux and uy) by running the script Correlation_WT.m to overlay the vector displacements with the image of cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nWhile running the Correlation_WT.m script you can also calculate the average magnitude of the displacements as a function of time.\nNote: If you divide by the time interval between frames you can calculate the mean speed of cells.\nWhile running the Correlation_WT.m script you can calculate the correlation length of the movement of neighboring cells.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nSave the output EC kinematical analysis as a .mat file and input various parameters (e.g., speed over time, correlation length) to Prism (GraphPad) if you wish to do statistical analysis of various independent experiments (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: You can also do the statistical analysis in MATLAB.\nMeasure the ECM displacements to perform TFM and monolayer stress microscopy (MSM).",

Note that in order to physically interpret the stresses that cells are exposed to, we make use of the principal directions where the magnitude of stresses does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system, and there is no shear stress component.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] The principal stress I (σΙ) is related to the maximum tensile stresses in each point of the monolayer, whereas the principal stress II (σΙI) is related to the maximum compressive stresses in each point of the monolayer. An extended explanation of these mechanical variables can be found elsewhere.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]"
