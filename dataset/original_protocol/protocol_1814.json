    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section provides detailed instructions for injecting an implant by using air-pressure based microinjector (part 2a) and injecting an implant by using a plunger (part 2b). Based on the physical properties of the implants (size, weight, density, and surface property), either an air-pressure based microinjector or a plunger can be used. The air-pressure based microinjector method (part 2a) is easier to use than the plunger-based method, but smaller, lighter, and/or less surface-resistant implants are preferred. The plunger-based method (part 2b) is less restricted by the physical properties of the implants. For experienced users, we recommend testing the air-pressure based microinjector method (part 2a) first due to the simple surgical setup and straightforward procedure.\nPart 1. Rodent handling\nTiming: 30 min\nThe mouse was anesthetized using ketamine and xylazine based on its body weight according to the Administrative Panel of Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols at Stanford University.\nWeigh the animal and calculate the correct dosage of the ketamine and xylazine injection mixture.\nNote: 0.08 mg ketamine/g and 0.01 mg xylazine/g\nUsing one hand, restrain the mouse with the abdomen facing up.\nPerform the intraperitoneal injection with the ketamine and xylazine mixture using a 20 G needle.\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad.\nApply 1% tropicamide to dilate the pupil.\nTrim the whiskers to prevent microscope examination disruption (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]; left panel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1406-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Mouse preparation for the implant surgery\nThe whiskers and the hairs may interfere with the implant injection procedure by blocking the eye. Mouse whiskers are trimmed using scissors (left panel).

    "Wet around the eye with clean 1X PBS (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]; middle panel).\nWait for 5 min for the mouse to become anesthetized (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]; right panel).\nApply lubricant eye drops to the eye to prevent the cornea surface from drying out.\nNote: Apply one drop per eye every 5 min.\nPart 2a. Implant injection by air-pressure\nTiming: 10 min for each surgery\nTo inject an implant by air-pressure, an electronic microinjector commonly used for intravitreal injection of fluids was utilized. The following is the step-by-step procedure for the electronic microinjector setup, the surgery bed setup, and the surgical process for an implant injection by air-pressure:\nThe electronic microinjector setup.\nTurn on the electronic microinjector and run a self-test.\nAssemble the needle with the capillary holder and positioning aids (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1406-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Implant injection by plunger\nTiming: 50 min for surgery tool production/10 min for each surgery\nTo inject an implant by plunger, a micromanipulator and a syringe-cleaning wire were utilized. The following is the step-by-step procedure to make the plunger, assemble the injection module, and set up the micromanipulator and the surgery bed. The surgical process for an implant injection by plunger is also detailed:",
    "Implant plunger making. To generate an implant plunger, a syringe cleaning wire was used. To adjust the thickness of the implant plunger to fit into the needle, one end of the syringe cleaning wire was ground using a Black Arkansas stone until the diameter of the wire was 50 μm. The following is the step-by-step procedure for making the implant plunger:\nApply a syringe-cleaning wire on the Black Arkansas stone.\nUsing your pointer finger, press and move one end of the cleaning wire back and forth.\nAfter 10 repetitions, check the width under a dissecting microscope.\nRepeat step c. until the diameter of the wire reaches 50 μm (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1406-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

A mouse and heating pad are set under the dissecting microscope, and the micromanipulator is placed nearby to be seen under the microscope.\n(E) Overview of the plunger-based method surgery platform. A mouse and heating pad are set under the dissecting microscope, and the micromanipulator with assembled plunger-module placed near the microscope.\nOptional: By banding the non-ground end of the cleaning wire, make a handle-like structure that can be used to easily manipulate the plunger during surgery.\nInjection module assembly. An injection module was assembled to mount the implant loaded needle to the micromanipulator (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). The following is the step-by-step procedure for the injection module assembly:\nSterilize the needle and capillary holder with 70% ethanol.",
    "Assemble the implant loaded needle to a capillary holder.\nNote: This step should be done with care so that the implant does not fall out of the needle.\nNote: Parafilm the needle and the capillary holder together to provide a more stable assembly.\nInsert the plunger into the hole at the opposite end of the needle tip.\nKeep the plunger at the halfway point of the implant loaded needle.\nNote: The plunger should not be touching the implant.\nMicromanipulator and surgery bed setup. For the intravitreal injection, stability of the microcapillary during the surgery is very important. Since the mouse eye is small and fragile, any unnecessary movement or vibration from the surgical hand may damage or tear the eyeball during injection. There are several commercially available micromanipulators with angle specific adjustable arms. In our MI3 method, utilizing a micromanipulator provides a precise and stable position to fine-tune the needle holder angle. Also, it secures the needle position and supports a smooth injection when using the plunger. The following is the recommended setup for the micromanipulator and the surgical platform for the intravitreal injection of ODIs:\nInstall the micromanipulator right next to the animal surgical platform.\nSet the angle of the needle holder on the micromanipulator to 30°.\nRaise the surgical bed to meet the height limitation of the micromanipulator.\nPlace the heating pad on top of the surgical bed.\nSet the heat to maintain the body temperature of the mouse.\nNote: The preset of the heating pad used was 37°C.\nPlace the implant and plunger loaded needle on the micromanipulator (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C and 7D).\nAdjust the micromanipulator location, making the needle and eye visible under the dissecting microscope’s examination stage (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E).\nImplant injection (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).",
    "Using the micromanipulator’s x-axis adjustment knob, move the needle closer to the injection site.\nApply lubricant eye drops to the eye to prevent the eye from drying.\nSlowly adjust the x-axis adjustment knob until the needle is inserted into the eye.\nNote: The recommended needle entry-position is 2 mm posterior to the limbus (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nInsert the needle until the tip of the needle can be seen in the eye under the dissecting microscope.\nNote: The recommended depth of the needle head is 2–3 mm.\nMove the plunger from the bottom of the microcapillary until its end touches the implant (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nGently push the implant into the eye.\nWhen the implant is fully inserted, slowly remove the needle by adjusting the x-axis adjustment knob.\nApply an antibiotic ophthalmic solution to the eye to prevent potential infections.\nPlace the post-surgical mouse on a heating pad until it wakes up.\nNote: Throughout the procedure, keep applying one lubricant eye drop every 5 min to prevent the cornea surface from drying out."
