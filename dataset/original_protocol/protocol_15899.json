    "This protocol uses replica molding techniques to fabricate PDMS micropost arrays with magnetic Ni nanowires embedded in individual microposts. These nanowires have diameters of 350 nm, lengths of 5 μm, and average low-field magnetic moments μ = 0.15 pA m2, aligned along their long axes (Hultgren et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0015]; Hultgren, Tanase, Chen, & Reich, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0014]). This protocol assumes the user can follow published protocols to make, or has access to, “master” versions of the arrays, which are typically made on silicon wafers by photolithographic techniques (Fu et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0009]; Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039]), and has followed published methods to cast “negative” PDMS molds of the desired micropost arrays (Tan et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0033]; Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039]). To make magnetic micropost arrays, magnetic Ni nanowires are positioned in the post forms (holes) in the negative molds. PDMS is then cast around them, embedding the nanowires in the posts. The nanowires must be shorter than the length of the microposts, or the magnetic microposts may be too stiff to bend in response to magnetic torques applied to the nanowires. The procedures described will yield approximately 1% of the posts containing magnetic nanowires for post arrays with 1.8 μm post diameters and 4 μm center-to-center post spacing (Shi et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0028]). Note that the magnetic microposts will be randomly distributed within the arrays. After the arrays are fabricated, they are removed from the molds in ethanol and dried using a critical point dryer to avoid collapsing the posts (Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039]). The tips of the posts are functionalized with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin via microcontact printing to promote cell adhesion to the micropost tips (Tan et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0033]; Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039]). Fibronectin works well for various cell types, but other ECM proteins can be used if needed.",
    "The sides of the posts and the regions in between are then blocked from cell adhesion by coating with Pluronics F-127. This is important as the conversion of micropost deflection to force depends on the cells’ forces being restricted to the posts’ tips (Fu et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0009]; Tan et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0033]). We note that non-magnetic micropost arrays, produced via published protocols (Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039]), are also used for some of the measurements described below.",

Treat the molds with an oxygen plasma under a pressure of 450 mTorr at 100 W power for 90 s.\nThis is to enable the functionalization of the mold surfaces in step 2. It must be done before a mold is used for the first time and should be repeated every 3-5 times a mold is used.\n2. Transfer the molds to a vacuum desiccator with a few drops of tridecafluoroctyltrichlorosilane on a glass coverslip. Pump to a rough vacuum and let stand overnight.\nThis enables the separation of the PDMS micropost arrays from the molds. This only needs to be done every 3-5 times a mold is used.",
    "3. Select a pre-prepared solution of nanowires of the desired dimensions at a concentration of 106 /ml in ethanol.\nThe nanowires must be shorter than the length of the microposts, or the magnetic microposts may be too stiff to bend in response to magnetic torques applied to the nanowires.\n4. Sonicate the nanowire solution for 5 min.\n5. Agitate the nanowire suspension in a vortex shaker for a few seconds.\nThe goal of these two steps is to break up any clumps of nanowires that may have formed due to magnetic attraction between the nanowires.\n6. Arrange PDMS molds in a plastic Petri dish (one mold per array desired).\n7. Place rectangular rare-earth magnets under the Petri dish, one under each mold.\nThe magnets should be placed flat with their North or South poles pointing up. These magnets should remain under the molds until the molds have been filled with PDMS and are placed in the oven to be cured to keep the nanowires aligned vertically.\n8. Pipette 30 μl of nanowire solution onto each mold.\nThe magnets underneath the molds will align the nanowires vertically in suspension and pull them into the holes in the mold that will form the microposts. If the nanowires are not aligned in this manner, they will not go into the post holes but will lie horizontally on the tops of the molds.\n9. Wait for the solution to evaporate (20-30 min).\nThis prevents nanowires from flowing off the molds when the next drop is added.\n10. Pipette another 30 μl of nanowire solution onto each mold and wait for it to evaporate.\n11. Repeat until 180 μl of nanowire solution has been pipetted onto each mold.\nThis should yield arrays with ∼1% of the microposts containing nanowires.",
    "12. Mix PDMS and curing agent in a 10:1 ratio in a Styrofoam cup.\nSteps 12-15 can be done while waiting for the nanowire solution to evaporate from the molds (steps 9-11). Prepare about 20 g of the PDMS mixture (e.g., use 20 g of PDMS and 2 g of curing agent.)\n13. Stir the mixture with a spatula for about 3-4 min.\nStir until the bubbles disappear.\n14. Pour the mixture into a 50-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 104 m/s2 (5k rpm on the above system).\nThis is to degas the PDMS to eliminate bubble formation that can lead to defects in the micropost structures.\n15. Arrange cover glasses (one for each micropost array desired) on a plastic Petri dish and treat with ultraviolet (UV)/ozone for 7 min.\nThis oxidizes the surface of the glass to promote the bonding of PDMS.\n16. Add a drop of PDMS to each mold from step 11.\nThe magnets should still be under the dish containing the molds.\n17. Press a UV-treated cover glass onto each of the molds.\n18. Degas the molds in a vacuum desiccator for 5 min.\n19. Bake the molds at 65°C on a hot plate for 1 hr.\nThis hardens the PDMS microposts sufficiently so that the nanowires do not move during subsequent processing.\n20. Remove the magnets.\nDo not put the magnets in the curing oven.\n21. Flip the molds over so the cover glasses are on the bottom.\n22. Bake the dish with the cover glasses in a curing oven set to 70°C overnight.\nThis cures the PDMS. Keep the Petri dish level so the molds do not slide off the PDMS before it cures.",
    "23. Remove the Petri dish and devices from the oven, allow to cool, and add 100% ethanol to the dish until the cover glasses are completely immersed.\nThe molds do not need to be completely immersed.\n24. Use tweezers to twist the molds off the cover glasses.\nKeep the cover glasses with the MPAD arrays immersed in ethanol during this process.\nAt this stage, the physical fabrication of the magnetic MPADs is complete. In subsequent handling, care must be taken not to damage the micropost arrays. In particular, arrays that are wet (e.g., in ethanol, water, or PBS) must not be allowed to dry out as the surface tension of the drying front can knock down the microposts. A critical point dryer must be used to dry the arrays.\n25. Dry the arrays in a critical point dryer\nThis procedure is described in (Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039]).\n26. Stamp fibronectin on the post tips via micro-contact printing and coat the non-stamped regions of the arrays with F127 Pluronic.\nThis will promote cell adhesion to the post tips rather than the sides of the posts and other surfaces of the arrays. This is important as the conversion of post deflections to force depends on the assumption that cells are adherent only to the post tips. Procedures for these steps are described in Yang et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0039].\n27. Store fibronectin and Pluronic coated arrays in PBS until used.\nArrays should be used within 24 hr after coating to avoid deterioration of the fibronectin coatings.",
    "This protocol describes the fabrication of the nickel nanowires used to make the microposts magnetic. The nanowires are made by electrodeposition in nanoporous templates (Felton, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0007]; Hultgren et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0015]; Kramer, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0017]; Rovner, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0026]). The templates are commercial 60-µm thick alumina filter membranes. These membranes have nominal pore diameters of 100 nm but only have this diameter in a small region 3-5 µm thick near the bottom of the membrane. For most of their length, their diameter is 350 nm, which sets the diameter of the nanowires. The length of the nanowires is controlled by how much Ni is deposited into the pores. For the microposts described in this protocol, the desired nanowire length is 5 µm. (The deposition procedure typically allows the length to be controlled to ±10%.) A copper film is sputter-deposited onto the bottom of the filter membranes to seal the ends of the pores in the template and serve as a working electrode for the electrodeposition. Note that thermal evaporation of Cu has been found inadequate to seal the pores. A thin layer of Cu is electrodeposited first to fill the narrow (100 nm diameter) end sections of the pores, and then Ni is deposited to produce the desired magnetic nanowires. The Cu is removed using a copper etchant, and the template is dissolved in KOH to release the nanowires. The wires may be stored for extended periods in ethanol or isopropanol before use.\nMaterials\nAlumina filter membranes, nominal pore size 100 nm, 60 µm thickness (Anodisc 47, Whatman)\nCopper sputter target\nArgon gas\nAcetone\nIsopropanol\nCu plate, 0.25″ thick, approx. 2.5″ square\nDI water\nCopper electrodeposition solution: 125 g/L CuSO4 •5H2O, 30 g/L H3BO3, 20 g/L NaCl in DI water.\nNickel electrodeposition solution: 514 g/L Ni(SO3NH2)2•4H2O, 20 g/L NiCl2•6H2O, 20 g/L H3BO3 in DI water.",

Clean alumina templates by rinsing in acetone and isopropanol.\n2. Sputter deposit a layer of Cu 500 nm thick on the side of the alumina templates with the nominal pore diameter (the back side).\nThe exact procedures will depend on the details of the sputtering system used but will typically be done in 5 mTorr of argon gas. A sputtering current of 50 mA and a deposition time of 25 min yielded the desired layer thickness in our system. This layer should not be too thick to facilitate its removal at the end of the nanowire fabrication procedure. If this layer is too thick, Cu will adhere to the tips of the nanowires, or the alumina will not be completely dissolved.\n3. Rub one side of the Cu plate thoroughly with sandpaper to remove its surface oxide.\nThis provides a clean surface to make good electrical contact with the Cu film on the template.\n4. Rinse the Cu plate with DI water.\n5. Place the filter template Cu-side down on the Cu plate.\n6. Rinse a rubber o-ring with DI water and place it on the top of the filter template.\nThe o-ring should be sized to the diameter of the deposition chamber.\n7. Place the Teflon electrodeposition chamber on the o-ring and clamp it to the Cu plate with a spring clamp.",
    "The electrodeposition chamber should have the form of a hollow cylinder, as the bottom is formed by the filter template and the Cu plate, which together serve as the working electrode. A good seal must be formed by the o-ring so that with the filter template/Cu plate forming the bottom of the electrodeposition chamber, no liquid can leak out. A flange on the bottom end of the Teflon tube to allow mating to the spring clamp is helpful.\n8. Rinse the chamber with DI water.\n9. Fill the chamber with Cu electrodeposition solution.\n10. Preclean the Pt counter electrode by placing it briefly in the flame of a blow torch and then washing it in DI water.\n11. Insert an Ag/AgCl electrode in the deposition solution to serve as a reference electrode.\n12. Connect the Pt electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and the Cu plate to the potentiostat.\n13. Deposit Cu to fill the bottom 3-5 µm of the pores, using a reference potential of −0.2 V.\nFor the diameter of our deposition chamber, approximately 1 Coulomb of copper deposits 1 µm in the pores. The goal is to fill the bottom, thinner section of the pores.\n14. Pour off the spent Cu deposition solution and rinse the deposition chamber and electrodes in DI water to remove any remaining electrolytes.\n15. Fill the chamber with the Ni deposition solution.\n16. Deposit Ni into the pores to the desired length of the nanowires, using a reference potential of -1 V.\nFor the microposts we typically use, the desired length is 5 µm. In our deposition system, we find deposition rates of 2-3 C/µm of Ni in the pores.\n17. Pour off the spent Ni deposition solution and rinse the deposition chamber and electrodes in DI water.",
    "18. Remove the filter membrane from the apparatus.\n19. Cut away the sections of the filter template that were not electrodeposited with a razor blade.\n20. Place the section of the filter membrane containing the nanowires in a Petri dish, Cu side up.\n21. Rub the filter membrane with a Q-tip soaked in a Cu etching solution to remove the Cu. Repeat until all traces of the Cu are gone.\nThis process can take 20-30 min and will require multiple Q-tips. The template should turn completely black when all the Cu is removed.\n22. Place the template with the nanowires in a glass vial or test tube.\n23. Fill the vial (or test tube) with 0.5 M KOH in water.\nKOH will dissolve the alumina of the filter membranes but will not affect the Ni nanowires.\n24. Seal the vial with parafilm and place the vial in a water bath at 60°C for 4-6 hr or overnight.\n25. Sonicate the vial and nanowire suspension for 10 min.\nThis will help break up clumps of filter material and nanowires.\n26. Place one or more rare earth magnets against the side of the vial for ∼5 min.\nThis will collect the nanowires by attracting them to the magnet. The magnet should immobilize the nanowires against the inside wall of the vial.\n27. Decant the KOH solution and replace it with a fresh KOH solution while keeping the magnet against the side of the vial.\nThe magnet must not move from its position on the side of the vial during these steps, or nanowires may be lost when the solution is decanted. The magnet may be taped to the vial, or a collar that holds the magnet and fits tightly around the vial may be constructed.",
    "28. Reseal the vial with parafilm and place the vial in a water bath at 60°C for another 4-6 hr.\n29. Sonicate the vial for 10 min and shake gently by hand.\n30. Collect and immobilize the nanowires again by placing one or more rare earth magnets against the side of the vial for ∼5 min.\n31. Decant the solution and replace it with DI water to wash the nanowires.\n32. Repeat steps 29-31 five times.\n33. Collect and immobilize the nanowires again.\n34. Decant the DI water and rinse the nanowires once in acetone.\n35. Repeat step 30 and replace the acetone with ethanol.\nThe nanowires may be stored in ethanol for extended periods, up to several years, while still retaining their magnetic properties.\n36. Inspect the nanowires with an SEM or an optical microscope after fabrication.\nNanowires can be prepared on a microscope slide for optical imaging by allowing a drop of ethanol-containing nanowires to evaporate. The diameter of the nanowires cannot be resolved by standard optical microscopy, but the lengths of the wires can be assessed. For SEM imaging, evaporate a drop of ethanol containing nanowires on a conducting substrate. The nanowires should form rods of uniform diameter. We analyzed SEM images and found that the average diameter of nanowires produced in these templates is 350 ± 4 nm (Tanase et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0034]).",
    "This protocol describes how to use video microscopy to measure the time-dependent displacements of microposts in contact with cells. The resulting data are of sufficient quality that the positions of the microposts can be measured with nanometer accuracy at up to 100 video frames per second, using the image analysis procedures described in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0006]. This protocol is used for data acquisition for cellular force fluctuations on non-magnetic micropost arrays. Many of the steps described here are also needed for local cell rheology measurements with magnetic micropost arrays (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0004].) This protocol includes instructions for seeding and culturing cells on the micropost arrays before the measurements. These are, of necessity, somewhat generic and may have to be modified depending on the specific cell type used. When imaging a cell, it is important to have it sufficiently centered in the field of view to have a border of at least 3-4 rows and columns of microposts that are not engaged with the surrounding cell. Data from these “background” microposts are used in the data reduction (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0006]) to compensate for any overall drift in the array's position and to determine the undeflected positions of the posts in contact with the cell. The data from the background posts also provide a measure of imaging noise in the system. Note that in this protocol, there will be a free liquid-air interface from the cell culture medium to the optical path. This has not proven to be a problem for experiments such as those described in (Shi et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0028]; Shi et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0029]). However, if needed, it is possible to eliminate this potential source of noise in the post tracking by using a dish such as that described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0004] that eliminates the liquid-air interface.\nMaterials",

Transfer an MPAD array from PBS to the P35 dish with tweezers.\n4. Pipette 200 μl of cells in suspension at the desired concentration into the dish.",
    "The above steps are the same as routine passaging, but with cells transferred to the MPADs instead of a new culture dish. The goal is to have a sufficiently sparse population of cells on the MPAD array to measure individual, isolated cells. This step will have to be calibrated for each cell type to account for its propensity to adhere to the microposts.\n5. Inspect the culture dish with a microscope.\nWhen using a 10× objective focused on the top of the microposts, between 10 and 30 floating cells should be visible and sparsely distributed across the field of view.\n6. Incubate MPADs overnight in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and the CO2 level appropriate for the cells in use.\nCheck that the cells are well-spread and adhered to the arrays before proceeding.\n7.

Position the microscope's green interference filter (GIF) in the light path.",
    "This confines the illumination to visible wavelengths and allows high illumination intensities while avoiding cell damage through prolonged exposure.

Adjust the microscope for Kohler illumination.\n16. Using a 10× objective, center the field of view on a cell.\n17. Rotate the sample dish so that rows of posts (in the hexagonal grid) are aligned with the horizontal (x translation axis) of the microscope stage (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0003]).\nThis is most easily done with a 10× objective.

    "If needed, rotate the camera so that the horizontal rows of posts are aligned with the x-axis of the camera's image. The circular outlines of the post tips should be sharp. This imaging mode is optimized to observe the post tips and not the cells, so it can be somewhat difficult to see the precise outline of a cell. However, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0003], the approximate outline can be discerned, and highly deflected posts near the cell's edges can sometimes be seen.\n21. Optimize the image quality using the objective's correction collar.\nThis adjustment may be needed to compensate for aberration as one is imaging through both the glass bottom of the culture dish and the coverslip on which the MPAD array is mounted.\n22. Set the gain to 1 in Norpix to avoid amplifying camera noise, and set the exposure time [Live Adjustments > Grabber Properties > Exposure (μs)]. Increase the illuminator intensity to maximize image intensity without saturating the image.\nExamine the histogram of the current frame, load Norpix's “histogram” module, and adjust the illuminator intensity until the high-intensity tail of the histogram just reaches the camera's maximum pixel intensity (e.g., 255 for an 8-bit image) (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0004]). This should correspond to the bright spots at the centers of the posts. For our system, we use an exposure time of 4.5 ms for recordings at 100 fps.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/747726b4-4e92-4df8-be19-1196578e67da/cpz1433-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nSample histogram of image intensity after setting halogen illuminator lamp intensity in Streampix prior to data acquisition.\n23. Record the cell at 100 fps for the desired time. In Norpix, these images are saved as lossless AVI files.",
    "We typically image the cells for 30 min each since the phenomena we are interested in occur on that timescale. If the size of the resultant movies becomes a problem, the frame rate can be reduced but at the cost of a loss of time resolution and a more limited ability to account for background noise.\n24. Change the field of view to center on another cell and repeat for as many cells as needed.",
    "This protocol describes measurements of the local rheology of a cell by actuating a magnetic micropost with an AC magnetic field and recording the resulting motion of the post. For the Ni nanowires described here, this requires the ability to apply an AC magnetic field in the range of 10 mT to ensure a linear response. The system described operates from 0.1 Hz to over 100 Hz to enable robust measurement of the frequency-dependent rheology. It employs a dual magnetic tweezer (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0005]) to ensure that only one cell is exposed to the magnetic field at a time, but if this is not a consideration, then alternative approaches may be employed to generate the needed field. Detailed information on the construction of a magnetic tweezer system is provided in several publications (Bose, Huang, Eyckmans, Chen, & Reich, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0002]; Kramer, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0017]; Lin, Kramer, Chen, & Reich, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0020]; Zhao, Boudou, Wang, Chen, & Reich, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0041]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/81f1d362-b3de-4272-acbf-bb4c0242b478/cpz1433-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

A PC running the Streampix (Norpix, version 5.16) video acquisition software is equipped with a National Instruments (NI) DAQ card. To produce the AC magnetic field, sinusoidal voltage waves from the NI card provide programming voltages to a Kepco BOP AC power supply operating in current-control mode, which provides current to drive a dual magnetic tweezer system mounted on an inverted microscope (green arrows). Hall sensors at the back end of the tweezers’ cores monitor their magnetic field, and the Hall voltages are read by the DAQ card and recorded by the PC (red arrow). The PC also controls a CCD camera on the microscope, recording the microposts’ motion (black arrow). To ensure the Hall voltages are measured simultaneously with the video frames, digital pulses from the camera when each frame is captured are used to trigger the measurements of the Hall sensors by the NI card (yellow arrow).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c31c9a30-5eec-4d29-8bc2-786f3a5d050a/cpz1433-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nBlock diagram of the measurement system for AC cellular rheology measurements with magnetic microposts.

    "Further information on the sample dish used for cell rheology measurements: as shown in Figures 5D and 7, a 50-mm culture dish is fabricated out of acetal plastic. A standard square coverslip (22 mm width × 0.17 mm thick) (shown edge-on in Fig. 5D) is glued with PDMS into a cutout in the dish to allow optical access. A micropost substrate with adhered cells mounted on a similar coverslip fits into the cutout on top of the first coverslip. An acetal lid (green in Fig. 5D) with a beveled top allows the magnetic tweezer tips (gray) to be brought within 1 mm of the cells without contacting the culture media (pink in Fig. 5D). The lid has a coverslip glued into it to allow illumination, and the culture media should fill the volume between the dish and the lid. The lid has four 2-mm posts in a square pattern that fit into corresponding indentions in the dish to prevent motion of the lid. A PDMS ring (orange in Fig. 5D) covers the open area between the edge of the lid and the dish to reduce media evaporation. The PDMS ring may be cast in a suitably sized Petri dish with a cylindrical insert (metal or plastic) to define the inner radius of the ring. The dish, lid, and PDMS ring are shown in Figure 7.\n1. Configure the microscope for white light imaging of the magnetic microposts as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0003], steps 8-15.\n2. Mount the dual magnetic tweezers onto the microscope. (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0005])\nIf the magnetic tweezer tips are rusty, use a grinding wheel or sandpaper to clean them. Then add a drop of PDMS and bake at 70°C overnight. This will protect the tips from oxidation.\n3. Pre-heat the system with the stage incubator to 37°C.",
    "This will take approximately 4 hr.\n4. Set up the Streampix software as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0005].\nThis includes special-purpose modules to drive the magnetic tweezers.\n5. Use a tweezer to add a drop of autoclaved vacuum grease at each corner of the custom glass-bottom dish. Place a magnetic AMPAD sample seeded with cells onto the glass bottom of the custom-built sample dish (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0007]) and ensure firm contact between the glass bottom of the sample dish and AMPAD.\nThe grease prevents the AMPAD sample from moving during measurements.\n6. Immediately add 1 ml of CO2 -independent culture media into the dish and place the custom culture dish lid (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0007]) over the sample.\nThis must be done quickly to ensure that the cells do not dry out. Make sure that the four posts on the bottom of the lid fit into the holes in the dish.\n7. Seal the sample dish with a PDMS ring.\n8. Raise the tips of the magnetic tweezers and slide the sample dish under the tweezer tips.\n9. Using the 40× objective, adjust the focus of the microscope until the tops of the posts are in focus, rotate the sample dish so that rows of posts (in the hexagonal grid) are aligned horizontally (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0003], Section 2.2, step 10), and then raise the focal plane of the microscope by 1 mm above the tops of the posts.\n10. Switch to the 4× objective and lower the tweezer tips until they are in focus.\n11. Switch to the 10× objective. Adjust the lateral position of the tweezer tips until they are in the middle of the field of view and 500 µm apart.\n12. Lower the tweezer tips by 200 µm.",
    "This can be done by lowering the focal plane by 200 µm and adjusting the tweezer position until the tips are in focus. The goal is to have the tweezer tips just above the top of the indented section of the sample dish.\n13. Switch back to the 40× objective.\n14. Switch on the camera in the Norpix software.\n15. Find a cell with one or more magnetic microposts underneath it.\nTypically, magnetic microposts look like regular microposts, except they are darker. Normally there will be defects in the MPADs, such as collapsed posts, and they can be used as landmarks to mark the cell's position. If the MPAD arrays do not have fiducial marks, it is best to look for cells near the edges of the arrays. This facilitates finding the cells’ locations again in later stages of the protocol when the magnetic posts are re-measured after the cells have been removed.\n16. Optimize the image quality and set the Norpix gain as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0003], steps 18-22.\n17. Start the Kepco power supply and click on the Record button in Streampix. The software will drive the magnetic tweezer automatically and carry out measurements at a set of frequencies between 0.1 and 135 Hz (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 35, 55, 80, 95, 115, and 135 Hz). The movie taken at each frequency will be saved in a separate AVI file.",
    "In our system, an AC current of 100 mA peak-to-peak from the Kepco power supply produces a magnetic field of 10 mT, which yields a torque of 1.5 nN∙μm on a 5-µm magnetic nanowire and hence a ∼250 pN effective force on the cell adherent to the magnetic post. This low force range minimizes the mechanical stimulation applied to the cells to remain in the regime of linear response. It is important to note that the driving current should not exceed the safe operating limits of the solenoids in the magnetic tweezers to avoid any risk of burning them out. Therefore, the hard current limits on the Kepco BOP should be preset manually following the manufacturer's manual. As the BOP should be operated in current-programming mode, ensure that the inductive voltage across the tweezers does not exceed the voltage compliance of the BOP at the highest frequencies studied.\n18. After finishing recording, shut down the Kepco power supply, move the file(s) with the readout from the Hall sensors into the same folder with the AVI files, and repeat steps 15-17 for additional cells as desired.\n19. When finished with data acquisition, raise the tweezer tips and take out the sample dish.\n20. Open the lid of the sample dish and rinse the MPAD array with 1 ml of PBS.\n21. Add 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA preheated to 37°C into the dish and leave for 5 min to allow the cells to be removed from the microposts. Then pipette out the remaining solution inside the dish and refill with DI water at 37°C.\n22. Put the lid back on to the sample dish.\n23. Repeat steps 7 to 19 to measure all the fields of view where cells were measured.",
    "This is intended to measure the magnetic microposts’ rheology after removing the cells. In Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0007], this will be subtracted from the overall modulus (cell plus post) measured in steps 7-19 to obtain the cell's modulus.\n24. Clean the customized dish with ethanol, then put it in the UV cabinet for 30 min.\nThis is to sterilize it for the next use.",
    "This support protocol describes the procedures for setting up Streampix to load modules that drive the dual magnetic tweezers with varying frequency magnetic fields, measure Hall voltages from the tweezers, and perform image acquisition simultaneously. It assumes one uses Streampix 5.16 to drive the camera on the microscope and that the user has access to our custom software modules. Once a video file is created, the driving module will run its “Start” command and generate a sinusoidal wave composed of a signal frequency ranging from 0.1 to 135 Hz and a reference frequency at 7 Hz in the output channel of a NI DAQ card. Then, whenever an image frame gets recorded, the module will run its “Increment command,” which will read the magnetic field from the Hall sensor. Finally, when the recording stops, the driving module will run its “Stop” command, which shuts down the NI card's input and output channels. These 3 steps continue iteratively until all frequencies to be measured are covered.\n1. Open Streampix (the camera driving software), load the module “VoltageoutNin_sync_DF” (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0008]), then under the Tools panel in Streampix, click “reload saved script”.",

Under the event “On recording stopped,” insert the command “Stop” to close the two channels mentioned above (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0010]).

    "The data acquisition of either non-magnetic or magnetic measurements results in videos of the microposts’ motion at up to 100 fps for each cell measured. This protocol describes a procedure to reduce these raw data to obtain the position of the center of each micropost in each video frame to allow the construction of position versus time traces for each post. This protocol uses a centroid-based particle tracking algorithm (Crocker & Grier, 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0003]) widely used in the microrheology literature. The custom version used, written in Igor Pro, takes advantage of the known underlying lattice of the posts. One begins by using a visual inspection of the first frame of the movie to define an initial mask that classifies the posts as either “cell posts” that are in contact with the cell, “background” posts that are not in contact with the cell, or “ignored” posts. The ignored posts are not analyzed and should include broken or bent posts and posts that may be under cells in the field of view other than the one to be analyzed. The distinction between cell posts and background posts is initially provisional and will be refined in subsequent stages of the analysis. Frame-to-frame drift is accounted for by measuring the average displacement in each frame relative to the first frame for all the background posts and subtracting this from each post's trajectory. To avoid including cell posts in the dedrifting calculation, it is thus better to err initially on the side of classifying posts near the cell as cell posts rather than as background. The undeflected positions of the cell posts are then determined by interpolation based on the positions of the background posts in corresponding rows and columns of the post lattice.",
    "The undeflected positions are subtracted from the raw positions to yield the posts’ deflections versus time for subsequent analysis. Note that long movies at high frame rates can be time-consuming to process.",

After rotating the image so the rows of posts are horizontal, the drawing tools (upper left) are used to define a rectangular ROI. (B) After clicking “Done Drawing,” the positions of the four corners are updated in the GUI and are marked by the red crosses in the image.",
    "9. Define the region of interest (ROI) around the target cell to be analyzed. This is a two-step process. First, draw a rectangle to roughly define your ROI. Click Draw Rectangular ROI. Click Draw Mode in the upper left of the image frame, select the Rectangle tool and draw a rectangle to define the ROI containing the cell you wish to analyze. Center the upper left corner of this rectangle on a micropost.\nThis is an initial step, and the ROI bounds will be refined further in step 11. It is best to get the rectangle's upper left corner close to the center of a post. Get the upper right corner close to a post as well (it may not be exactly on a post if your rotation correction is not perfect), and position the lower-left corner close to the row of posts that you want to be the bottom of your ROI. If it is necessary to adjust the position and shape of the rectangle after it is drawn, click on the Arrow (selector tool) in the Igor drawing menu, click on the rectangle and adjust as needed.\nImportant: Do not try to analyze posts right up to the boundary of the image. Leave at least a one-post gap between the ROI and the edge of the frame. Reducing the ROI size to avoid analyzing too many background posts can speed up the analysis. However, it is very important to leave a border 2-3 posts wide at a minimum around the cell in all directions. This border of background posts will be used to define a grid to determine the undeflected positions of the posts in contact with the cell. This is needed to measure the absolute post deflections and hence the absolute values of the cellular traction forces.",
    "10. Click Done Drawing in the GUI. The positions of the corners of the rectangle you drew should appear in the boxes labeled XT and YT, and the red crosses in the image will move to the corners of the rectangle in the image (Fig. 17B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0017]).\nThe positions of red crosses are what the program uses to define the post lattice and ROI, so these now need to be refined.\n11. Adjust the positions of the red crosses using the up- and down-arrows by the x- and y-position values in the GUI to center them on posts. All the crosses should end up within 2 pixels of a post center. First, if necessary, adjust the upper left red cross.\n12. Next, adjust the position of the upper right red cross to center it on a post in the same row as the upper left cross. Count the number of posts between the two upper crosses, including the posts under both crosses, and enter this number in the “# posts in horizontal dimension” box.\nEach corner of this rectangle must be closely centered on a micropost (within 2 pixels). If it is necessary to adjust the position and shape of the rectangle after it is drawn, click on the Arrow (selector tool) in the Igor drawing menu, click on the rectangle and adjust as needed.\n13. Now position the lower-left cross. Count from row to row down the image from the upper left cross following a zig-zag path like the one shown in green in Figure 18[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0018]. Enter the number of rows in the “# posts in vertical dimension” box. Again, include both the starting and ending rows in your count.",
    "Your counting path may deviate from the boundary of the rectangle drawn in step 9 if the rotational alignment is not perfect or if the array (or the image) is in some way distorted. If you have an odd number of posts in the vertical dimension, the lower-left red cross should be directly under the upper left cross if the post lattice is perfectly aligned. If you have an even number of posts in the vertical direction, the lower-left cross will be one-half of a lattice constant to the right of the upper-left cross.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c4fe3772-89fc-4b3a-a25a-9907b5ba4a44/cpz1433-fig-0018-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 18\nIllustration of adjustment of the two crosses at the bottom of the ROI to move them on top of the microposts. The green line indicates the path along which to count the posts in the vertical direction.\n14. Finally, position the lower-right cross. This can be done either by counting horizontally from the lower-left cross or vertically from the upper-right cross.\nFigure 18[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0018] provides an example of the results of this procedure.\n15.

Enter 0 in the popup window (not shown) to use the first frame in the movie to set the mask.\nIt can occasionally be useful to use a different frame if one wants to start analysis at some later point in the movie.",
    "17. Click Continue. In the first frame image, a red cross should appear over each post in your RO (Fig. 19[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0019]). This is the default identifier for a background post. The locations of these crosses will be used as the initial guesses for the positions of the centroids of the posts when fitting the first frame. If the crosses are not well reasonably lined up with the posts, you will have to go back to Step 6 and re-define the ROI and numbers of posts.\nCheck that you counted the right number of posts in each direction. If you have miscounted, the crosses in the middle of the image will be systematically out of registry with the posts.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/37604212-977d-4140-96b5-a10355b7219a/cpz1433-fig-0019-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 19\nGUI for SetMaskPanel to create the initial identification of cell-associated and background posts, and defective or other posts to be ignored in the analysis.

    "19. Click “Add Ignored Posts”, then click on any posts in the image frame that you do not want to analyze. This should include any posts that are missing or collapsed, plus any posts that are under cells other than the cell to be analyzed. When finished, click on the “Done Adding” button.\nAll ignored posts will be marked with purple hour-glass symbols (Fig. 21[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0021]).\n20. Adjust the mask further as needed using the “Add Cell Posts”, “Add Empty Posts”, and “Add Ignored Posts” buttons, followed by clicking on the image frame to change posts to cell, background (empty), and ignored respectively. Click “Done Adding” after working with each post type.\nAs noted in the introduction to this protocol, since the background posts are used to do the frame-to-frame dedrifting correction, to avoid including cell posts in this calculation, it is better to err initially on the side of classifying posts near the cell as cell posts, rather than as background.\nNote that there are other buttons in this GUI that can be helpful here and at various stages in the analysis. “Hide Mask”, “Replot”, and “Reset Mask” carry out the corresponding operations on the mask. “Show Index” replaces the mask symbols with the index of each post in the various data storage arrays.\n21. Click “Done” in the “SetMaskPanel” GUI (Fig. 21[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0021]) and in the “DefArr” GUI (Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0015]) to finish defining the mask.\nThe locations of the points in the mask will be used as initial guesses for the post positions in the analysis of the post trajectories.",

You can choose whether to have an image of each frame shown as it is analyzed. (Use this for diagnostic purposes only, as this will be slower). You can also have the current frame number printed periodically to track progress as the analysis runs. The fit post centers will be stored in units of pixels in the 3D wave FitRes_XXX, where “XXX” is the string entered in the Working Name field. The Layer dimension is the frame number.\nWhen running this initially, it can be useful to analyze only the first few frames of a video to verify that the process is working and to estimate the run time before attempting to analyze a long movie.\nFor a 10-fps video of 30 min duration (18,000 frames), this step will take approximately 30 min on a Dell Precision Tower 5810 PC.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/72389b13-c7e5-4434-a992-00c27266c1cb/cpz1433-fig-0022-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 22\nPop-up window for “Fit All Posts” button.\n23.

For the initial analysis, choose “manual” in the pop-up window.",
    "“Manual” will use the post identification mask defined in steps 16-21. If desired, this can be refined after MSD analysis using “automatic” mode, which uses the more accurate MSD-based identification of cell and background posts. This can be used to correct issues that may arise with the dedrifting computation if cell posts are erroneously identified as background posts in the manually created mask. The automatic mode can only be run after the Make Cell Mask and Force Bifurcation operations are run, as it uses the mask wave generated in the latter procedure (See Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0008].).

Then digital lock-in analysis is applied to extract the response of each post at the (variable) drive frequency f and the reference frequency fR. Magnetic posts are identified by their large response compared to non-magnetic background posts. To account for time-dependence in the amplitude of the response at the drive frequency, the signals are broken up into 10 s intervals, and the average of the ratios of the displacements x(f)/x(fR) are computed (see Commentary). The driving force is deduced from the magnitude of the magnetic fields and used to calculate the modulus k(ω). As this is the combined response of the cell plus the post itself, k(ω) is also computed for data obtained after removing the cells (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0004]), and then the two results are subtracted to obtain k(ω) for the cell alone.\nMaterials\nPC or Macintosh computer (e.g., Dell Precision Tower 5810).\nIgor Pro Software (Wavemetrics, version 8 or higher)\nCustom Igor Procedure Files (See Internet Resources)\n1.

    "Measurements with non-magnetic microposts result in time traces that record the mechanical fluctuations of the cell. These are conveniently characterized using the mean squared displacement (MSD) <Δr2(τ)> = <(r(t+τ) - r(t))2> (Equation 2), where τ is the lag time. The MSD typically shows a power-law dependence MSD ∼ τα over a range of lag times from roughly 1 to 100 s. A procedure is described to extract the MSD exponent α by first subtracting the background noise floor and then fitting the logarithmic time derivative of the resultant subtracted MSD. The MSD exponent can then be used for multiple forms of analysis. Background posts that are not connected to a cell typically show much smaller MSD exponents α than do posts that are connected to a cell, and so the criterion α < 0.2 provides a means to identify the background posts. For long measurement times (e.g., up to half an hour), cell motility can lead to microposts near the edge of the cell being connected to the cell only over a part of the measurement interval as the cell moves. To identify such posts, the MSD may be calculated for the first and last thirds of each time trace, and the requirement that the corresponding exponents α1 and α3 both be > 0.5 can be used to identify posts that are connected to the cell throughout the measurement interval. Only these posts are used in subsequent analysis (unless one is interested in tracking motility). Procedures are described to bifurcate the population of cell posts into subpopulations associated with stress fibers and those associated with the cortex based on the average traction force produced on the posts.\nMaterials\nIgor Pro Software (Wavemetrics, Inc, version 8 or higher)\nPC or Macintosh computer (e.g., Dell Precision Tower 5810)",

    "Sample micropost deflection fluctuations for a cardiac myofibroblast (Shi et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-bib-0029]). (A) Deflection trace of one Cartesian component of the motion of a cell-associated micropost (red) and a background micropost (blue) over 30 min (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0006]). (B) MSDs versus lag time τ determined from traces such as those in (A) for the posts indicated by red circles in C. The traces’ color shows the MSD power law exponent α over the range 5 s ≤ τ ≤ 10 s as given by the scale in panel C. The black trace is for the background post shown in A. (C and D) Heat maps of (C) distribution the exponent α over 5 s ≤ τ ≤ 10 s, and (D) the MSD magnitude at τ = 10 s Each hexagon represents a post. Gray hexagons indicate posts that were not coupled with the cell over the full measurement interval. Gray circles show background posts. (E) Distribution of cortical and stress fiber posts across the cell, as determined by the classification procedure based on average traction force magnitude described in Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-prot-0008], and the corresponding traction force vectors (red arrows). (F) Scatter plot of MSD magnitude at τ = 10 s versus average traction force. (G) MSD magnitude at τ = 10 s versus MSD exponent α for cortical and stress fiber posts.\n6. Click the “MSD Scatter Plot” button; this will generate panels F and G in Figure 30[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.433#cpz1433-fig-0030], which show the scatter plot of the MSD magnitude at τ = 10 s against MSD exponent and traction force magnitude, respectively."
