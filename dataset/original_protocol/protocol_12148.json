    "1. Collation of Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitor Libraries\nCollate inhibitor libraries from publicly accessible kinase inhibitor collections, e.g. Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) from Harvard Medical School, a targeted collection of 228 potent and selective kinase inhibitors (http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu), and the Protein Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS), a 376 compound collection assembled by industrial researchers (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/extra/PKIS)13. Alternatively, assemble a bespoke kinase inhibitor collection from commercially available compounds.\n\tNOTE: In our laboratory, we have assembled a collection of 72 potent and selective tool kinase inhibitors covering 51 primary target kinases, all of which are available from commercial sources.\nAssemble kinase inhibitors into 96-well plates for optimal high-throughput processing at multiple concentrations (use 1, 0.1 and 0.01 mM). Include in each plate control wells containing DMSO only and reference control inhibitors PD173074 (FGFRi) and Ruxolitinib (JAKi), which are known to promote naïve and primed pluripotent states respectively. Annotate in a spreadsheet or similar software.\n2. mESC Culture Conditions and Procedures for Screen Preparation\nPrepare 0.1% gelatin-coated 10 cm dishes by adding 5 mL of 0.1% (w/v) gelatin to 10 cm plates and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Aspirate gelatin and let plate dry for 2 min.\nCulture any standard mESC line at 37 °C 5% CO2 on 0.1% gelatin-coated 10 cm dishes in standard mESC media (see Materials Table) containing 100 ng/mL GST-LIF, 10% Fetal Calf Serum and 5% Knockout Serum Replacement. Replace media every day and passage mESCs at around 80% confluency every second day at a dilution of 1:5-1:10.\nTo passage mESCs, aspirate media and wash with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per plate.\nAdd 1 mL trypsin-EDTA (0.05% Trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) per plate of mESCs and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.",
    "Resuspend trypsinized cells in 4 mL of mESC media and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 5 min.\nThoroughly resuspend cell pellet in 5 mL of mESC media, pipetting up and down to generate a single cell suspension.\nCount cells by combining a 10 µL cell suspension and 10 µL of Trypan Blue (0.4%). Place into a cell counting chamber or use a hemocytometer and light microscope.\nSeed 3 x 103 mESCs into 0.1% gelatin coated 96 well plates, final volume 100 µL of media, using a multichannel pipette.\nApply kinase inhibitors at 1:100 dilution (1 µL inhibitor added to 100 µL media) using a multi-channel pipette. Gently pipette media to mix inhibitor and cell suspension, then allow cells to settle in a tissue culture hood for 1 h to ensure equal distribution across the plating surface. Culture cells for 48 h without changing the media.\n\tNOTE: Stock plates of 1/0.1/0.01 mM will give a final inhibitor concentration of 10/1/0.1 µM respectively. we recommend starting the screen at a final concentration of 1 µM to ensure effective inhibition of primary target kinases whilst minimizing off-target effects.\n3. Kinase Inhibitor Screening Analysis\nWash 96 well mESC plates in 200 µL PBS using multi-channel aspirator and pipettes.\nMake cell extracts in 150 µL of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 (v/v), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets).\nClarify extracts by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 30 min in V-bottomed 96-well plates.\nImmobilize 100 µL of supernatants onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a 96-well vacuum dot blot manifold.\nDry the membrane, and stain with 40 mL of Ponceau S to ensure consistent transfer.",
    "Wash membrane with TBST and block in TBST/3% (w/v) milk.\nIncubate in Nanog and Dnmt3b antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000 (v/v) in TBST/3% (w/v) milk powder overnight.\nWash membranes in 3 x 10 min in TBST and incubate in 30 mL of secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:10,000 (v/v) in TBST/3% (w/v) milk.\nDevelop using a digital immunoblotting imaging system.\n\tNOTE: If possible, use quantitative fluorescence immunoblotting to detect Nanog and Dnmt3b. However, the background signal for Dnmt3b by fluorescence immunoblotting is too high. Therefore, 800 nm fluorescence anti-rabbit (Nanog) and anti-mouse-HRP (Dnmt3b) secondary antibodies are used.\n4. Analysis of Screen Data and Validation of Inhibitors as Bona Fide Pluripotency Regulators\nNOTE: This is a critical step to ensure that only bona fide pluripotency modulators are identified. It is essential to triage inhibitors based on both Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio and overall signal, to ensure that kinase inhibitors which adversely affect mESC survival are not selected for further analysis.\nQuantify Nanog and Dnmt3b signal using immunoblotting analysis software, and import values into a spreadsheet or similar software. Calculate Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio for all samples compared to DMSO control. Also, determine total Nanog and Dnmt3b signal to ensure that kinase inhibitors do not affect Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio by altering mESC viability.\nUse ranked Nanog:Dnmt3b ratios to identify inhibitors which promote naïve pluripotency (Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio higher than control) and primed pluripotency (Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio lower than control). Set cut-off at 2x deviation from control values, and filter out kinase inhibitors which produce a total Nanog+Dnmt3b signal of less that 50% of the DMSO control value to generate a high confidence list of kinase inhibitors which stabilise naïve (high Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio) and primed (low Nanog:Dnmt3b ratio) pluripotent states.",
    "Validate kinase inhibitors by seeding mESCs at 2 x 105 cells per 6 well in 2 mL media, and add kinase inhibitors at 1 µM for 48 h, without changing media.\nLyse mESCs in lysis buffer and analyze Nanog and Dnmt3b expression by conventional SDS-PAGE immunoblotting.\nFurther validate hits by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting for naïve pluripotency markers Klf2 and Klf4, and Oct4 to ensure that pluripotency is maintained following 48 h inhibitor treatment."
