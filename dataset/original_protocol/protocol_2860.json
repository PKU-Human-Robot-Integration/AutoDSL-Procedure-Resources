    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAccessing PAD2 and select TFs for colocalization analysis\nTiming: <5 min\nHere we describe the steps to begin the analysis from PAD2, starting with selecting a set of signal files from the database. The selected proteins will be used in targeted colocalization analysis within 12 functional genomic regions identified by ChromHMM.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nOpen PAD2, from http://pad2.maths.usyd.edu.au/[href=http://pad2.maths.usyd.edu.au/].\nClick the “Select signals from the database” button on the side panel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) to open a modal page with an interactive data table of files in the database (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2568-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Screenshots of PAD2\n(A) The landing page of PAD2 when you access the website.\n(B) An example page showing a table of files in the database when you click the “Select signals from the database” button.\nSelect the signals of TFs and/or histone marks of interest from the database.\nYou can sort the table by clicking the column names and search for a file using the search bar on the top right corner of the modal page.\nClick anywhere on the row of the table to select. The selected rows will be highlighted.\nOnce all the files of interest are selected, click the “Save” button.\nUser’s signal file upload (optional).\nClick the “Browse…” button on the side panel.\nBrowse your local computer directory to select all the files you wish to upload.\nClick the submit button.\nNote: The user’s own signal data submission is optional. If the user only wishes to analyze the files in our database, action 4 can be skipped.\nCritical: Access to the website may not be successful in the event of server maintenance or power outages. Please send an email to the administrator for assistance. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Critical: The user’s input file must be aligned to mm9 assembly to be compatible with those in the database and in the required format shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] above (See ChIP-seq data preparation from before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nSelecting genomic region of interest and submitting the input form\nTiming: minutes to hours\nThis section describes steps to specify a functional genomic region to analyze the colocalization from the selected set of proteins at the region of interest. The colocalization is assessed by clustering Pearson’s correlation from the user specified ChIP-seq profiles.\nSelect the functional genomic region of interest from the dropdown menu on the side panel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2568-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sidebar options for PAD2\n(A) List of functional genomic regions defined by Kim et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] using chromHMM.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Each functional genomic region and their coverage on the chromatin are shown in the squared brackets.\n(B) An optional input form to plot ranked correlation plot.\n[Optional] To visualize the ranked correlation of protein of interest by its similar groups, check the “Plot ranked correlation” checkbox and select a signal of your interest from the “Anchor” dropdown menu (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCheck all the input details from the side panel and click the “Submit” button.\nNote: The run time of the application will depend on the number of files to be analyzed. Processing each of the user’s uploaded signal files may take a few minutes. In our testing with 10 files from the database and 1 user uploaded signal file, it takes 1.5 min to process.\nInvestigating the correlation of signals at the selected genomic regions\nTiming: minutes to hours",
    "Different genomic regions can show different colocalization of the same set of proteins depending on their functional roles. This section describes steps to select different functional regions of the same or different sets of proteins from the database.\nAssess the correlation heatmap.\nHover the cursor across the heatmap for exact values of the correlation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2568-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The labels in both axes are colored by file categories.\n(B) Ranked correlation of all the similar groups of proteins to the selected anchor protein.\nHover over the plot and click the disk-shaped icon at the top right corner to download a correlation matrix as CSV file.\nZoom or pan across the heatmap to investigate specific regions of the cluster.\nTo investigate other genomic regions, select different regions from the dropdown menu in the sidebar panel.\nTo investigate a different set of signals, repeat from the second step of major step 1 from the result page.\nUse the side panel to add any additional files or changes to your parameters to re-analyze.\nSelect different genomic regions.\nIf “Plot ranked correlation” was checked from major step 2, scroll down to investigate the ranked correlation plot (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) of all the similar groups of proteins including the user’s uploaded data.\nOptional: Additional user’s input data can be uploaded by clicking the Browse button similarly to point 5 of step 2.\nNote: Similar to step 2, one additional signal file upload takes 1.5 min to process.\nDownloading your analysis plots\nTiming: <1 min\nThis section describes steps to save your analysis into a vector image.\nDownload your heatmap plot.",
