    "1. Utricle Dissection and Culture\nEuthanize an adult (4  weeks of age or older) mouse using an approved protocol and decapitate.\nSnip the external  auditory canal on both sides of the head and pull the skin forward towards the  nose. Bisect the head from back to front  and remove the brain from both sides to reveal the bony labyrinth.\nTrim the skull away  from the bony cochlea and transfer the bony labyrinth (including the bulla) to a  tissue culture hood equipped with a dissecting microscope (Note: Adenovirus work should be performed in a  Class II biological safety cabinet).\nIn the hood, transfer  each cochlea to a 35mm tissue culture dish containing sterile dissecting media  (M199, Gibco/Invitrogen #12350) (Figure 1A).\nIf the auditory bulla  is still intact (it is possible to remove the bulla during the gross dissection  by inserting your thumbnail between the bulla and the apex of the cochlea), use  two forceps (one #3 and one #5) to break the bulla (Figure 1B).\nIdentify the  landmarks of the bony cochlea preparation:  apex, base, ossicles, oval and round windows, VIIIth nerve root,  semicircular canals   (Figure 1 C, D).\nPlace the inner ear  in the dish with the medial side facing up, such that the oval and round  windows and apex are on the bottom of the dish and the VIIIth nerve root is  facing up. Hold the preparation using a  #3 forceps in the region of the semicircular canals (Figure 1D).\nUsing a scalpel  equipped with a #11 blade, cut off the apex of the cochlea just apical to the  nerve root (Figure 1D).\nTurn the preparation  so that the cut portion is facing up.  Use the anterior semicircular canal as a handle to stabilize the  preparation (Figure 1E).",
    "Using #5 forceps,  remove the cochlea at the modiolus down to the base. At the point where the hook region of the  cochlea turns downward, use a fine probe (half of a broken #55 forceps) to lift  the last bony shelf of the osseous spiral lamina (Figure 1F), revealing the  saccule. Just beneath the saccule is the  stapes footplate, which is an important landmark. The utricle is immediately adjacent to the  stapes footplate (Figure 1G), and it is surrounded by bone. Use the probe to chip the bone away enough to  reveal about 1/3 of the utricle. Carefully  remove the utricle using #55 forceps (Figure 1H). This procedure will usually result in removal  of the pigmented roof epithelium as the utricle is pulled from the bony  preparation. However, if the utricle is  removed with the roof epithelium intact, the roof can be removed using #55  forceps.\nUtricles for  adenovirus infection (or live imaging experiments) must have the otoconia  removed during the dissection (prior to infection). In this case, use a luer-lock syringe that is  filled with dissecting media and fitted with a small-bore needle (usually 26-28  gauge). Hold the utricle at the edge  using #55 forceps (Figure 1I). Bring the  needle tip close to the utricle with the bevel of the needle pointing  down. Use a stream of dissecting media  to blow off the otoconia (Figure 1J). Alternatively,  otoconia can be removed by brushing them off using an eyelash tool (Ted Pella,  Inc. #113). Utricles that are not going  to undergo adenoviral infection are normally cultured free-floating in 24-well  tissue culture plates with the otoconia intact (see below for post-fix otoconia  removal, which is easier).",
    "Once all utricles are  dissected, change the dissecting media to sterile culture media: DMEM F12 (Gibco #11320) supplemented with 5%  FBS and 50 U/ml penicillin G (Sigma). \nUtricles are cultured  at 37 °C and 5% CO2. If cultures are to be maintained for more than 48 hours, half of the culture media  should be changed every other day.  Cultures can be maintained for a week or longer.\n2.  Adenovirus Infection of Supporting Cells\nImportant: Working with adenovirus requires Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) procedures and certification.  Check with your Institutional Biosafety Officer for guidance and training on BSL2 procedures.\nDissect utricles as  above in dissection media (no serum).  Remove otoconia as above.\nWhen ready to infect,  transfer 1 utricle (hair cells up) into each well of a Nunc mini-tray (Fisher  #12-565-68) containing 15 μL serum-free DMEM F12 (this is important  because serum can inactivate the virus). This transfer is easier with a 1.5 mm  microcurette (#10082-15 from Fine Science Tools).\nOur Ad-GFP is  serotype 5 with the viral E1 and E3 genes deleted and the human CMV promoter  driving the transgene (GFP). This virus  was obtained from Vector BioLabs (Philadelphia, PA vectorbiolabs.com[href=http://www.vectorbiolabs.com/]). Stock viruses are provided at titers of  1.0-4.0×1010 PFU/ml. Add  0.5-2 μl of stock virus to each well containing a utricle (Figure 1L). The actual amount used varies depending on  the virus and stock titer. We usually infect  each utricle with 1.0-4.0×107 PFU. \nCulture the utricles in  virus-containing media at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 2 hours. After 2 hours, transfer the utricles back to  the 24-well tissue culture plate containing culture media with serum. Culture  the utricles overnight at 37 °C/5% CO2.",
    "Utricles can be used  the next day for live imaging experiments, or they can be fixed for hair cell  immunochemistry (see below). Viral  transgene expression increases over time, so if transgene expression is low at  24 hours post-infection it may beneficial to culture cells an additional 24  hours in serum-containing media. If you  see hair cell toxicity, reduce the amount of virus used.  \n3. Utricle Fixation, Otoconia Removal, and Immunochemistry\n   At  the end of the culture period, fix utricles in 4% paraformaldehyde for either 3  hours at room temp (on a rocking platform) or overnight at 4 °C. Wash utricles (3 times, 15 min each) in 0.1 M  (1X) Sorensen's phosphate buffer pH 7.4.  These steps are performed in a 24-well tissue culture plate. \nOtoconia  removal: Note: Otoconia must be removed  prior to adenovirus infection (see step 1.11 above). However, utricles that are not to be infected  can be cultured and fixed with the otoconia still intact. In this case, use the steps described here to  remove the otoconia after fixation. Inspect  utricles for any remaining pigmented roof epithelium. Carefully remove any remaining roof  epithelium using two #55 forceps. To  remove the otoconia, replace Sorensen's phosphate buffer with 750-1000 μl Cal-Ex  decalcifier (Fisher #CS510-1D). Leave  Cal-Ex on utricles for 1 minute and 40 seconds (do not exceed 2 minutes). Replace Cal-Ex with 0.1 M Sorensen's  phosphate buffer and wash (5 times, 5 min each).\nIncubate utricles in sodium  borohydride (Sigma #452882, 1% in deionized water) for 10 mins. Wash utricles in 0.1 M Sorensen's phosphate  buffer (5 times, 5 min each).\nPlace  utricles in Blocking Solution (PBS + 2% bovine serum albumin + 0.8% normal goat  serum + 0.4% Triton X-100) for 3 hours at room temperature on a rocking  platform.",
    "Add primary  antibodies and incubate overnight at 4 °C.  Anti-Myosin 7a (either Proteus Biosciences #25-6790 or #MYO7A 138-1 from  the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1:100 in blocking solution labels  all hair cells. To separately label  striolar and non-striolar hair cells, we have used a double-label protocol with  monoclonal anti-calmodulin (Sigma #C 3545; 1:150) and polyclonal anti-calbindin  (Chemicon #AB1778, Temecula, CA, USA; 1:200).  Secondary antibodies (usually Alexa fluor conjugated secondary  antibodies from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) are diluted 1:500 in blocking  solution and incubated for 4 hours in the dark at room temperature on a rocking  platform.\nMount utricles on  glass slides using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). \n4. Representative Results\nUtricles cultured using this method retain full complements of both hair cells and supporting cells (Figure 2).  Hair cells in healthy cultures show round nuclear profiles surrounded by thin cytoplasmic regions that are myosin 7a-positive (Figure 2, top panel).  Supporting cells (labeled with anti-Sox2) are smaller and more densely packed than hair cells (Figure 2, lower panel).  Adenovirus infects 25-50% of the supporting cells in the utricle, and no hair cells are infected (Figure 2, Ad-GFP panels).  It should be noted that the optimal working titer of each adenovirus must be determined empirically, since hair cell death is possible if the viral titer is too high.  In addition, regions of mechanical damage (caused during the dissection) will take up large amounts of virus.  These regions of mechanical damage are easily distinguishable by a continuous line of cells with very high levels of GFP expression and missing hair cells.  This is in contrast to the scattered GFP expression in supporting cells of an undamaged culture (Figure 2). \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3734/3734fig1.jpg",

    "Figure 2.  Adenovirus-mediated infection of supporting cells.  Utricles were infected with adenovirus driving expression of green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP).  Shown are confocal images of  the hair cell layer and the supporting cell layer in the same area of one utricle.  Hair cells are labeled with an antibody against  Myosin 7a (magenta).  Supporting cells  are labeled with an antibody against Sox2 (red).  Schematic shows the structure of the utricle sensory epithelium and the locations of the hair cells (HC) and supporting cells (SC).  Locations of confocal (optical) sections shown in the upper (U) and lower (L) panels are indicated by  dashed lines in the schematic.  Upper panels: In confocal images taken at the level of the  hair cell nuclei, Ad-GFP signal appears in the spaces between hair cells and  does not overlap with the hair cell marker Myosin 7a.  Lower panels: In confocal sections at the level of the supporting cell nuclei, Ad-GFP  signal colocalizes with the supporting cell marker Sox-2. Ad-GFP infection results in GFP expression in  supporting cells only, and no hair cells are infected.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3734/3734fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.  Adenoviral infection does not result in death of hair cells or supporting cells.   Utricles were infected with Ad-GFP at 4×108 PFU/ml.  Utricles were labeled with antibodies against Myosin 7a (hair cell marker) and Sox2 (supporting cell marker).  Hair cell and supporting cell counts were equal for control utricles and Ad-GFP infected utricles.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
