    "SCV analysisFirst, in the flow chamber, separate the embryogenic suspension cultures from the medium using the cell dissociation sieve (150 mesh screens) (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129174516_0425.jpgFigure 2.

Details of SCV measurement using the ruler.Then, place 200 mg of culture (fresh weight) consisting of separated cells in an adapted Erlenmeyer flask (Figure 1) containing 10 ml of the culture medium containing the required testing treatments (Figures 2B and 2C). To measure the initial SCV, transfer the entire contents of the flask (culture medium and cells) to the adapted tube outside of the Erlenmeyer flask (Figure 2D). Keep upright in a Falcon tube rack (Figure 2E) for 15 min.After this time, measure the initial SCV using a ruler (Figures 2F and 2G). Later, return the entire contents (culture medium + cells) into the Erlenmeyer flask by carefully inverting to make sure to return most of the cells into the Erlenmeyer flask (Figure 2C). Keep the adapted Erlenmeyer flasks on a horizontal shaker (100 rpm in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C). To determine PEM growth, repeat the measurement procedures every three days until the PEMs reach the decline phase. Notes: A cellular growth curve (Figure 3) is performed to identify the phases of cellular growth of the embryogenic cultures in suspension. This identification can be used to establish the sampling points for the assessment of morphology and for biochemical studies.",
    "If an Erlenmeyer flask of 100 ml capacity is used, we suggest the following proportion: 25 ml of culture medium used for every 500 mg of fresh cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129174736_1307.jpgFigure 3. Graphic representation of the cellular growth by SCV. A cellular growth curve by SCV analysis from embryogenic suspension cultures of A. angustifolia in MSG culture medium showing the different phases during incubation.Fresh and dry weight measurementUse 12-well cell culture plates for this analysis. In a flow chamber, separate the cells from the suspension cultures using a sieve to collect only the cells; discard the culture medium (Figure 2A).Next, use the analytical balance (Figure 2B) to weigh the cells and place 60 mg fresh cells into each well of the cell culture plate, which should contain 2 ml of culture medium per well (Figure 4A).Close the cell culture plates and keep on a horizontal shaker for incubation (100 rpm in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C). To measure the fresh weight on specific days (established by the growth curve, for example), take the cell culture plate and carefully remove the liquid culture medium using a pipette (Figure 4B). Repeat this procedure for each individual well.Use a spatula to collect all the solid contents of the cell culture from each well (Figure 4C), separately, on a piece of pre-weighed aluminum foil.Measure the fresh weight of cells using an analytical balance (Figure 4D). Dry the samples at 70 °C for 48 h. Then, measure the samples plus aluminum foil again on the analytical balance. It is necessary to subtract the weight of the aluminum foil (pre-weighed) to obtain the dry weight. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129175013_9718.jpgFigure 4.

Measurement of the fresh weight with an analytical balance using pre-weighed aluminum foil.Slide preparation for PEM morphology studiesFirst, in the flow chamber, separate the embryogenic suspension cultures from the medium using the cell dissociation sieve (150 mesh screens) (Figure 2A). Then, 1,200 mg of separated cells, fresh weight (Figure 2B), should be placed into an Erlenmeyer flask (250 ml capacity) containing 60 ml of the culture medium containing the required testing treatments. Three flasks for each treatment should be maintained for three biological replicates.Place the flasks on a horizontal shaker during incubation (100 rpm in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C).For analyzing the incubation results on specific days, in a flow chamber, take a sample of PEMs from the liquid culture medium using the modified pipette tip. It is necessary to remove the end of the pipette tip (Figures 5A and 5B) to prevent the disruption of PEMs. The pipette tips must be sterilized before use. Put a drop of the PEM culture on a glass slide (Figure 5C), and cover with a cover slip. Observe under an optical microscope.Notes: The remaining cells in the flask could be returned to the horizontal shaker for use on the next day of analysis. If you do not continue the incubation, and the cells will be discarded, it is not necessary to use a sterilized pipette tip for sampling.The PEMs can alternatively be incubated in an Erlenmeyer flask with a smaller volume (keeping the ratio of 20 mg fresh cells for 1 ml of culture medium).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129175230_1600.jpgFigure 5.

    "Plating with a drop of PEMs in suspension culture.Slide preparation for isolated embryogenic and suspensor-type cellsFirst, dissociate the PEMs to obtain embryogenic and suspensor-type cells by incubating the PEM suspension culture in culture medium with 0.1% (w/v) cellulase (Sigma-Aldrich).Keep the samples incubating in cellulase for 3 h on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C.After incubation, transfer the cells to a Falcon tube and wash with a new culture medium that is cellulose free. Remove the culture medium carefully with a pipette and repeat this procedure three times. To visualize the cells with an optical microscope, follow the procedure described in Procedure C used to prepare slides using a modified pipette tip.Image captureTo capture images for morphological analysis, we use AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software according to the following procedures (other comparable image analysis software should suffice):Open the software AxioVision Rel. 4.8, and in the Tool Bar, select: View>Toolbars>Standard.To view the image on the screen: click the ‘Live’ option.Set in the software the specifications of the objective and ocular you are using to capture the image using the ‘Snap’ option.When saving the image, choose the .zvi format.Procedure for morphological measurement and analysisArea measurementOpen the image in the microscope software.Choose the options: View>Toolbars>Measure.To measure the area, use the tool options, ‘outline’ or ‘outline spline’. Then, draw a closed shape around the embryonal head (Figures 6A and 7). When the form is closed, the area appears on the figure in µm2. This value is used for area analyses.Repeat this operation with several samples of embryonal head and suspensor-type cell images.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129175746_7792.jpgFigure 6.

Arrows (red) indicate the tool options used.Diameter, width and length measurementOpen the image in the microscope software.Choose the options: View>Toolbars>MeasureTo measure the area, use the tool option ‘length’.Then, using the ‘length’ tool, measure the embryogenic-type cells to obtain the diameter data (see red line in Figure 6B and black line in Figure 8).  Using the ‘length’ tool, measure the length and width in suspensor-type cells, as shown by a black line in Figure 8.Repeat this operation with several samples of dissociated embryogenic and suspensor cells.Notes: In Araucaria, as embryogenic-type cells are isodiametric, the size was measured based on the diameter, and as suspensor-type cells are elliptic and elongated, the size was measured using the length and width (at the middle of the cell) (Figure 8). If the suspensor-type cells are curved, the ‘curve spline’ tool can be used as shown in Figure 9.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129180643_2329.jpgFigure 8.
