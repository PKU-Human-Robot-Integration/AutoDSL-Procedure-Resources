    "NOTE: Figure 2 shows the main steps of the ITC experiment for determining the thermodynamic and kinetic association of a DNA aptamer and tetracycline.\n1. Preparation of samples\nNOTE: Samples for ITC need to be prepared in the same buffer for both the aptamer and ligand to avoid heat release caused by mixing different buffers from the sample cell and syringe. This is typically achieved through dialysis of all materials into the same buffer. The buffer is exchanged using a protocol adapted from the protocol of a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWC) concentrator with some modifications, as below:\nActivate the membrane of the dialysis column (3 kDa MWC) with 1x PBS, pH 7.4, purchased from the manufacturer, using the following steps: fill with 1x buffer (PBS), equilibrate for 10 min at RT, and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 15 min.\nRemove the buffer and load 500 µL of aptamer samples into the column, centrifuge at 5,000 x g, and repeat it 4x to exchange the original buffer for 1x PBS. When the buffer goes through the membrane, all molecules with a mass less than 3 kDa will go through the membrane, and the aptamer will remain on the upper side of the membrane.\nCollect the dialyzed DNA aptamer using a pipet and transfer it to the new 1.5 mL tube(s).\nCollect the last flowthrough buffer to dissolve tetracycline. Tetracycline powder is pure and small, so dialysis is not needed. However, use the previous dialyzed buffer for DNA for the target to ensure that the buffer for the experiment in the syringe matches the buffer in the reference cell.\nDetermine the aptamer concentration again using a UV-visible spectrometer. Use the last exchange buffer to adjust the concentration to 40 µM tetracycline and 2 µM aptamer.",
    "Fold the DNA aptamer by heating at 90 °C for 10 min, cooling at 4 °C for 10 min, and then returning to RT for 20 min.\nDegas the folded aptamer and dialyzed tetracycline using a degassing station or vacuum pump set to 600 mmHg at 25 °C for 25 min to eliminate dissolved gases.\n2. Washing the instrument and running the test kit\nClean the solvent ports to ensure the entire sample path is clear. Clean by discarding the waste solution and loading them with pure methanol, water, and buffer. Each port contains more than 250 mL to ensure enough solution for cleaning.\n\tNOTE: The cleaning process is automatically completed by user-programmable ITC control software.\nTest the cleanliness of the machine by running ITC using buffer into a buffer (i.e., 1x PBS into 1x PBS).\n\tNOTE: A normal noise baseline is visible between the tiny buffer into buffer injection peaks. When the titration syringe and cannulas are adequately cleaned and completely dry, the baseline will be stable; an increase or decrease in the baseline reflects dirty instrumentation or bubbles inside the instrument, which need to be corrected before running actual samples.\nTest the accuracy of the machine with a standard kit that includes EDTA and CaCl2 (Figure 3), using the default program and following the instructions from the manufacturer.\n3. Running the sample to determine the binding between aptamer and tetracycline\nSet up the running parameters: a stirring rate of 200 rpm, running at 25 °C, 2 µM aptamer and 40 µM tetracycline, 30 injections with 2.0 µL each, a delaying time of 180 s.",
    "Check the required volumes using a running program calculator. With this running parameter, perform ITC measurement with 230 µL of 40 µM tetracycline in the ITC syringe and 485 µL of 2 µM aptamer in the ITC sample cell using the ITC.\nLoad the dialyzed tetracycline syringe plates and the folded aptamer into the sample cell, avoiding bubbles, using a pipette.\nStart running the ITC instrument by clicking on the start button on the software.\n\t​NOTE: The ITC instrument running process is fully automated after manually filling the reference cell and titrant sample plates.\n4. Analyzing data using software\nOpen the data analysis software by double clicking to start analyzing the data.\nOpen the path of the saved raw data to know the tendency of binding.\nOpen the modeling tab and use different binding models to find the best fit for the data curve. Then, the software automatically calculates the ITC thermogram and various thermodynamic parameters, including enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), free energy (ΔG), equilibrium binding constant (Ka), and stoichiometry.\nCollect the thermodynamic parameters determined from the data and fitting model information.\nCreate a report, including pictures of the ITC thermogram and various thermodynamic parameters, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 1.\nSubscription Required.
