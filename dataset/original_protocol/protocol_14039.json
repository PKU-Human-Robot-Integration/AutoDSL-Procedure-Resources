    "Approval for skin biopsy procurement for research purposes was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, Australia. Consent for animal experiments was obtained from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, which were performed in accordance with local animal welfare regulations (GZ: 66.009/0218-II/3b/2015).\nNOTE: The principle of the ECLIA system is depicted in Figure 1.\n1. Antibody selection\nEvaluate the signal-to-noise ratio for a range of various MeCP2 antibodies and identify the best signal strength and highest specificity within the combination of a primary mouse monoclonal MeCP2 antibody (clone Mec-168) and rabbit polyclonal MeCP2 detection antibody (custom made). For the secondary antibody, use a system-specific antibody (Table of Materials), which was also experimentally verified.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 gives an overview of all verified antibodies during MeCP2-ECLIA development and their tested dilution ranges.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nFunction,Name,Clone,Dilution\nPrimary,\"Mouse, anti-MeCP2\",Mec-168,\"1:500−1:10,000\"\nPrimary,\"Mouse, anti-MeCP2\",4B6,\"1:250−1:4,000\"\nPrimary,\"Mouse, anti-MeCP2\",Men-8,\"1:500−1:4,000\"\nPrimary,\"Mouse, anti-MeCP2\",1B11,\"1:500−1:4,000\"\nPrimary,\"Rabbit, anti-MeCP2\",D4F3,\"1:500−1:4,000\"\nSecondary,\"Rabbit, anti-MeCP2\",polyclonal,\"1:2,000−1:20,000\"\nSecondary,\"Rabbit, anti-MeCP2\",polyclonal,\"1:2,000−1:20,000\"\nDetection,SULFO-TAG labeled anti-rabbit,polyclonal,\"1:500−1:1,000\"\nTable 1: List of antibodies and used working dilutions.\nAlternatively, use each pair of MeCP2-antibodies that works well with conventional ELISA.\n2. Treatment of HDFs with TAT-MeCP2 fusion protein\nNOTE: TAT-MeCP2 was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using standard chromatographic techniques as previously described8 and stored at -80 °C.\nPlate 1 x 106 human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells in 100 mm dishes and grow the cells overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until they reach about 90% confluency.\nTake out one vial of TAT-MeCP2 fusion protein. Thaw on ice and mix gently.\nDilute TAT-MeCP2 to a final concentration of 500 nM in 50 mL of HDF culture media.\nRemove the media from 100 mm dishes and incubate the cells with 500 nM TAT-MeCP2 at 37 °C for various incubation periods up to 24 h.",
    "Remove the TAT-MeCP2 solution from the cells. Wash the cells 2x with pre-warmed Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS).\nTreat the cells with 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C10.\nAdd 6 mL of HDF culture media to inactivate the trypsin and collect the cells in 15 mL tubes.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cells 2x with ice-cold DPBS. Store the pellet on ice and proceed with sample preparation.\n3. Sample preparation\nHDF lysates\n\t\nDetermine the highest protein levels of MeCP2 using the REAP method for subcellular fractionation into the cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular compartments according to Suzuki et al.11. Limit fractionation to no more than six samples per experiment.\nMouse brain lysates\n\t\nPrepare 100 mL of each hypotonic lysis reagent and extraction buffer.\n\t\t\nFor the hypotonic lysis reagent, mix well 10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride and 10 mM potassium chloride.\nFor the extraction buffer, mix well 20 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 0.42 M sodium chloride, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 25% (v/v) glycerol.\nAdjust the pH of both buffers to 7.9.\nAdd 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail to both buffers freshly. Chill on ice before use.\nSuspend 100 mg of total mouse brain (strain: C57BL/6J, wildtype male and female and B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2tm1.1Bird/J, hemizygous male and heterozygous female; age: 4−8 weeks old) in 1 mL of ice-cold hypotonic lysis reagent.\nHomogenize the brain with a pre-chilled Dounce all-glass tissue homogenizer by 15 strokes of homogenizer A (loose, for large clearance) and B (tight, for small clearance), respectively.",
    "Transfer the homogenized cells to a clean tube and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant (or keep it as cytoplasmatic fraction for further use).\nResuspend the pellet in 140 µL of extraction buffer per 100 mg of starting material. Place the tube in a pre-cooled thermoblock and mix gently for 30 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the tube at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant (i.e., the nuclear fraction) to a new pre-chilled tube and store at -80 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The protein concentration of lysates derived from mouse brain and HDFs can be assessed by the BCA protein assay.\n4. MeCP2-ECLIA protocol\nPreparation of washing solution, blocking buffer and assay diluent solution (day 1)\n\t\nAdd 500 µL of Tween 20 to 1 L of PBS to prepare a 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS solution, mix vigorously and label as “washing solution”.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that only freshly prepared washing buffer is used.\nPrepare a blocking solution of 3% blocker A (Table of Materials) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mix by gentle stirring, filter sterilize and keep them in the fridge until use for a maximum of two weeks.\nAdd 5 mL of blocking solution to 10 mL of PBS to prepare assay diluent solution (1% blocker A in PBS).\nCoating of high bind plates\n\t\nTake out a 96-well multi-array single spot high bind plate.\n\t\tNOTE: High bind plates have a greater binding capacity and therefore a larger dynamic range than standard plates with hydrophobic surfaces.\nThaw the monoclonal mouse anti-MeCP2 antibody on ice and mix 0.67 µL of the antibody with 4 mL of PBS (1:6,000 antibody dilution in PBS). Vortex the antibody solution to mix well and label the tube as “coating solution”.",
    "Carefully dispense 25 µL of coating solution in the bottom corner of each well using a multichannel pipettor; this is called the solution coating method. Tap the 96-well plate gently on each side to ensure that the coating solution covers the bottom of each well.\nSeal the plate with an adhesive foil and incubate the plate in the fridge at 4 °C overnight (12−16 h).\nBlocking (day 2)\n\t\nTake out the plate from the fridge and remove the foil.\nRemove the antibody coating solution by flicking it into the waste basket and tap the plate on a paper towel to remove all the coating solution from the wells.\nAdd 125 µL of blocking solution per well. Seal the plate again and place it on an orbital microplate shaker.\nIncubate the plate for 90 min at room temperature with constant shaking at 800 rpm.\nPreparations of standards and samples\n\t\nDuring the incubation time, prepare the MeCP2 and/or TAT-MeCP2 protein standards and various samples.\n\t\tNOTE: Lysis buffer used for standard dilution must be the same as that used in the analyzed samples.\nTake out one vial of MePC2 and/or TAT-MeCP2 protein stock solution (250 µg/mL), mouse brain lysates and HDF lysates from -80 °C. Thaw them on ice.\nDilute the standard stock solution (MeCP2 and/or TAT-MeCP2) in clean tubes according to Table 2.\nDilute the samples in lysis buffer as follows: 1−20 µg of mouse brain lysate per 25 µL of lysis buffer, and 0.25−1 µg of HDF lysate per 25 µL of lysis buffer. Prepare enough volume of each sample to carry out analysis in triplicate.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nStandard,Concentration,Dilution\nStandard 1,\"1,800 ng/mL\",1.08 µL Standard stock solution + 148.92 µL Lysis buffer\nStandard 2,600 ng/mL,50 µL Standard 1 + 100 µL Lysis buffer",

Avoid any air bubbles by using reverse pipetting techniques.\nPlace the plate on the microplate detection platform (Table of Materials) and start the measurement immediately. Use the settings for 96-well plate acquisition.\nCapture the electrochemiluminescence signals by a built-in CCD camera in an electrochemiluminescence detection system (Table of Materials) and record the signal counts, which correspond to relative light units (RLU) and are directly proportional to the intensity of light.\n\t\tNOTE: Upon electrochemical stimulation, the ruthenium label bound to the carbon electrode emits luminescence light at 620 nm.
