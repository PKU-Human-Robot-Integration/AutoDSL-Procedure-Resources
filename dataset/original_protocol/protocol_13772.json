    "NOTE: The experiment was approved by the Local Committee for Animal Care of the Canton Bern, Switzerland (Application Number BE108/16), and all animal care and procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and 3R principles15,16. Data are reported according the ARRIVE guidelines. Peri-operative management was conducted by a board-certified veterinarian anesthesiologist. For the study, female New Zealand white rabbits, with a mean weight of 4.0 (± 0.3) kg and mean age of 25 (±5) weeks, were housed at a room temperature of 22-24 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water, pellets, and hay.\n1. Pre-surgical phase and anesthesia\nPerform a clinical examination as recommended by the Association of veterinary Anesthetists and the European and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and analgesia to confirm that the rabbits are healthy by weighing each animal, evaluating the mucous membrane, documenting the capillary refill time and pulse quality, and performing a pulmonary and cardiac auscultation as well as an abdominal palpation.\nBased on the clinical finding, attribute an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification to each rabbit17. Perform surgery only on animals with an ASA I score.\nShave both outer ears, and apply prilocaine-lidocaine cream on auricular arteries and veins. Achieve deep sedation with a combination of ketamine 20 mg/kg, dexmedetomidine 0.1 mg/kg, and methadone 0.3 mg/kg injected subcutaneously (SC). Leave the animals undisturbed for 15 min. Give supplementary oxygenation (3 L/min) through a loosened face mask, and monitor with a pulse oximeter.\nPlace a 22 G cannula in the left auricular central artery as well as in an auricular vein. Induce general anesthesia with propofol 1-2 mg/kg intravenous (IV) until effect (loss of swallowing reflex). Proceed with endo-tracheal intubation via a silicone tube (3 mm internal diameter).",
    "Shave the forehead to place the pediatric electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors. Shave the surgical field, and inject ropivacaine hydrochloride 0.75 % intradermally.\nPlace the rabbit on the operation table in dorsal recumbency, install full monitoring, and connect the endo-tracheal tube to a low-resistance pediatric circle system. Maintain anesthesia with administration of isoflurane in oxygen, targeting a maximal end tidal (Et) concentration of 1.3 %.\nProvide a continuous infusion of ringer lactate 5 mL/kg/h through the venous access. Ensure clinical and instrumental monitoring until extubation by means of pulse oximetry, doppler and invasive blood pressure, 3-lead electrocardiogram, EEG, rectal temperature, and inhaled and exhaled gases.\nDisinfect the surgical field with povidone iodine from the manubrium sterni to jaw angles, and apply the sterile draping. During surgery, provide analgesia with lidocaine (constant rate infusion (CRI) of 50 μg/kg/min) and fentanyl (CRI of 3-10 μg/kg/h). Perform spontaneous or assisted ventilation. Allow permissive hypercapnia.\nPerform at least one arterial blood gas analysis during surgery. In case of hypotension (mean arterial pressure below 60 mmHg), treat it with noradrenaline, titrated until effect. Use a heating pad or a heating forced-air warming system to prevent hypothermia (aim: rectal temperature 37.5-38.5 °C).\n\t​NOTE: As the invasive arterial blood pressure is measured at the left ear artery, the clipping of the left CCA will stop the blood flow and suppress the curve. The blood pressure has then to be measured with Doppler technique until reopening of the vessel.\n2. Surgery\nApproach\n\t\nMake a median skin incision from the hyoid bone until a point 1.5 cm caudal to the manubrium sterni with a scalpel. Prepare the subcutaneous and fat tissue from the medial incision while performing meticulous hemostasis.",
    "Free the sternocephalicus muscle from the adherent connective tissue, and apply lidocaine topically (2-4 mg/kg, prefer lidocaine 1%) to avoid myoclonus. Expose the right CCA medially of the sternocephalicus muscle and keep it wet with wet swabs.\nNow prepare the lateral and proximal parts of the sternocephalicus muscle and retract it medially with a vessel loop to expose the CCA. Identify the external jugular vein and protect it with a wet micro swab.\nDissect the connective tissue carefully along the proximal CCA until the bifurcation of the brachiocephalic trunk to expose the artery. In the presence of small branches coming from the artery, coagulate them with the cauterizer.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to avoid any nerve damage.\nStump aneurysm creation and tissue harvesting for the bifurcation aneurysm\n\t\nBefore clipping the right CCA, measure the anti-clotting time (ACT), and give natrium heparin (80 EI/kg) systemically via the ear vein (performed by the anesthesia team) to avoid thromboembolic events.\nNow apply 2 temporary clips: the first one at the origin of the CCA and the second one 2 cm distal from it (Figure 1A). Place a rubber pad under the vessel and rinse with papaverine HCL (40 mg/ mL; 1:1 dissolved in 0.9% saline) for vasodilatation.\nRemove the adventitia carefully using microscissors. Perform an arteriotomy below the distal clip with a 22 G IV-catheter, and insert the catheter caudally up to the proximal clip (Figure 1A,B).\nFlush the segment intraluminally with heparinized NaCl (500 U/100 mL in 0.9% saline) until there is no blood visible, and finally fix the catheter with a ligature (4-0). Now, through the catheter, inject 0.1-0.2 mL of elastase (100 IU previously dissolved in 5 mL of Tris-Buffer) into the artery segment and incubate for 20 min (Figure 1B).",
    "Start with the dissection on the left side to expose the left CCA (see section 2.3). After 20 min of incubation time with elastase, clear the elastase solution, and change the syringe to rinse the artery segment about 10 times with 0.9% NaCl.\nApply 2 ligatures (6-0): the first one 5 mm distal of proximal clip and the second just proximally, under the arteriotomy (Figure 1C). Cut the vessel ~3 mm above the first ligature and one more time between the second ligature and the distal clip. Keep this autologous graft in a heparinized solution (500 U/100 mL in 0.9% saline) until the creation of the bifurcation aneurysm (Figure 1D). Finally, carefully open the first proximal clip, and measure the aneurysm (length, width, and depth).\nBifurcation aneurysm creation\n\t\nPrepare the left side by dissecting the sternocephalicus muscle medially to expose ~2 cm of the left CCA. Apply lidocaine topically on the muscle to avoid myoclonus.\nUnderlay the carotid artery with a gauze ball and a small swab with a piece of glove. Apply some papaverine.HCl topically (40 mg/mL; 1:1 dissolved in 0.9% saline). Continue to work under microscopic view: prepare the aneurysm pouch and remove the adventitia. Measure the aneurysm pouch (length, width, depth).\nFlush the open part of the right CCA with heparinized NaCl and if needed, replace the clip to have ~1 cm to allow free manipulations for the suture. Remove the adventitia carefully, and make a ~2 mm longitudinal incision laterally in the stump of the right CCA.",
    "Now apply two temporary clips on the left CCA to delimit a segment of ~1 cm and remove the adventitia in between. Perform an arteriotomy with a 23 G needle. Flush the segment with heparinized NaCl (500 U/100 mL in 0.9% saline). Enlarge the arteriotomy using microscissors to ~4-5 mm to allow the suturing of the right CCA and the aneurysm pouch (Figure 1E). Irrigate the vessels during the whole suturing procedure and protect them with wet micro swaps.\nPerform the anastomosis with 9-0 non resorbable suture.\n\t\t\nSuture the proximal back wall of the right carotid blunt with 5 stitches, starting at the proximal edge of the arteriotomy on the left CCA. Then, suture the backside of the aneurysm pouch with 4-5 stitches, starting at the distal edge of the arteriotomy on the left CCA.\nContinue with the distal backside at the level of the fish mouth incision to suture with the vertical backside of the aneurysm graft with 3 stitches. Suture the front side of the fish mouth incision with 3 stitches, starting upwards and moving downwards.\nFinish with the front suture between the left CCA and front side of the aneurysm graft and right CCA with ~6 stitches. Before finishing the anastomosis, rinse the vessels with heparinized 0.9% saline solution intraluminally.\nBefore removing the clamp, measure the anti-clotting time (ACT) one more time, and administer an adapted dose of heparin systemically (target: 2-3 times baseline ACT).",
    "Remove the clip on the right CCA while putting some pressure on the anastomosis with micro swabs for hemostasis. Then, continue by removing the distal clip from the left CCA. If there is no major bleeding, continue with taking out the proximal clip on the left CCA, to allow blood flow. If there is some bleeding from the anastomose, apply some pressure with the gauze ball and swab; wait for a couple of minutes. If it persists, replace the clips and perform re-stitches.\n\t\tNOTE: A blood loss of more than 20-30 mL can endanger the recovery phase.\nPatency control and documentation\n\t\nAfter opening all the vessels, document the results photographically and measure them (Figure 1F and Figure 2A,B).\nConfirm the restoration of the flow in the distal CCA through the invasive arterial blood pressure curve (measured at the ear artery, a direct branch of the external carotid), which should also return to normal.\nPerform fluorescence angiography by administering 1 mL of fluorescein IV, using 2 bandpass filters, a video camera, and a bicycle spotlight. See previous publications for the description of the whole procedure18,19.\nClosure\n\t\nReadapt the fat pad on the anastomosis and suture it with a 4-0 resorbable suture. Finally suture subcutis and skin with single stitches using 4-0 resorbable suture.\n3. Postsurgical phase\nAt the end of the surgery, discontinue isoflurane and systemic analgesia without reversion in order to maintain the analgesic effect. Ensure that control of the swallowing reflex has returned before performing tracheal extubation.\nAdminister meloxicam 0.5 mg/kg IV to ensure analgesia, aspirin (ASS) 10 mg/kg IV to prevent immediate thrombotic events, vitamin B12 100 μg SC and clamoxyl 20 mg/kg IV as antibiotic prophylaxis.",
    "Provide supplementary oxygenation and warming until the rabbit spontaneously regains the sternal recumbency. Perform rescue analgesia with methadone if any sign of pain is observed. Perform postoperative follow-up and care 4 times a day for the first 3 preoperative days, in accordance with the guidelines for the assessment and management of pain in rodents and rabbits23,24.\nEnsure postoperative analgesia with fentanyl patch (12 μg/h) applied on the outer ear, meloxicam 1x/ SC for 3 days, and methadone as rescue therapy, along with a score sheet for pain evaluation (Supplementary File).\nSubscription Required.
