    "Preparation of the urine prior to dialysis Centrifuge 10 mL of urine in a rounded bottom tube at 1,342 × g for 10 min. Identify the tube.Label the Eppendorf tubes. Transfer and aliquot supernatants obtained in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with a Pasteur pipette. Aliquot a minimum of 4 mL, at 1 mL per Eppendorf. Freeze samples at -20 °C until dialysis.Note: As many supernatants as possible should be frozen, in case the dialysis process needs to be repeated. Additionally, 8 mL would be ideal, in case electrophoresis needs to be repeated. Dialysis and concentration of the samples prior to capillary electrophoresis Note: Urine is dialyzed and concentrated using 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off ultrafiltration columns, which are double membranous. This step is necessary not only to concentrate proteins, but also to avoid artifacts from contaminants (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4466/bioprotoc-12-15-4466-g001.jpgFigure 1. Different parts of an ultrafiltration colums tube 4 mL capacity. The concentration membrane where proteins are retained, and waste deposit where disposals are collected.Thaw 4 mL of urine supernatant from each individual to study at room temperature, and centrifuge the Eppendorf tubes at 1,609 × g for 10 min.Transfer this sample to a 4-mL ultrafiltration column. Identify the ultrafiltration columns.Note: Columns with 15 mL of capacity are available. In this work, due to the difficulty obtaining a large amount of urine, 4-mL columns are preferred. Centrifuge the ultrafiltration column with the urine at 1,878 × g for 25 min, or until a maximum volume of 500 μL is left in the column.Simultaneously, prepare a solution containing 50% distilled water and 50% dialysis buffer (see table of materials) in a sterile container. Use two 10-mL syringes to prepare the solution. Mix this solution prior to its use.",
    "Discard the urine that emerges at the bottom of the column (waste deposit, Figure 1). With a Pasteur pipette, add the washing solution prepared in point 4 to the ultrafiltration column (concentration membrane, Figure 1) with the urine, up to the 4 mL mark.Centrifuge the column with the urine and the buffer solution at 1,878 × g for 20 min, or until a maximum of 400–500 μL are left in the column.Homogenize the dialyzed urine with a fine tip micropipette (maximum capacity: 200 mL), and transfer the dialyzed urine to an Eppendorf.Note: The capillary electrophoresis equipment (see table of materials) requires a minimum of 100 μL.Capillary electrophoresis of dialyzed samples Start the electrophoretic computer program provided by the equipment manufacturer (Phoresis software version 8.6.3). Make sure that the analytical equipment is on too. Enter the program password: a pop-up window will appear and ask to continue with the current technique (protein) or change it to urine. You must change the work mode to urine. Make sure to check reagents and waste deposit before running the samples. A notification will appear on screen when the equipment is ready to process the samples.Note: This can be done during the dialysis and concentration of the samples, since the start-up process of the analytical equipment takes 15 min. Once the equipment is ready, insert the Eppendorf tubes with the dialyzed and concentrated urine into the electrophoresis instrument. Insert samples in pairs to reduce reagent wastage. As soon as the samples are inside, the electrophoretic instrument starts automatically. Do not open the instrument’s door until the CE process is finished.Note: The analytical instrument can process 26 samples at the same time, and takes 10 min per sample. Fraction separation Phoretograms appear on the screen once the CE process is complete.",
    "Identify each phoretogram in the program with the patient’s number. Manually divide the phoretogram into five fractions—although the program establishes predetermined divisions, they are not designed for dog urine (Figure 2).Note: The computer program allows manipulations of the profile, such as changing the size or superposition of curves, to be done manually on the phoretograms obtained (Video 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4466/bioprotoc-12-15-4466-g002.jpgFigure 2.
