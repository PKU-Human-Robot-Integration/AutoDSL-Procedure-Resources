    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConduction of transmigration experiment\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes the actual transmigration experiment. Trypanosomes are incubated on HIBCPP filter inserts. After a defined time period, filter inserts are removed, and the genomic DNA of transmigrated parasites is isolated for quantification.\nSetting up the transmigration experiment.\nDetermine cell density of trypanosome culture with a counting chamber (Neubauer improved 0.01 mm).\nHarvest trypanosomes by centrifugation (10 min at 1,500 × g and 4°C) and resuspend cells in pre-warmed HMI-9 medium to a final concentration of 1e7 cells / mL.\nNote: Keep 2.5e6 trypanosomes to isolate genomic DNA (gDNA) as qPCR standard (step 3).\nIdentify filters that have reached a TEER of > 600 Ω (200 Ω⋅cm2), empty the inserts and place them into 1 mL pre-warmed HMI-9 medium in a new 24 well plate.\nCritical: High TEER values (> 1200 Ω) indicate that HIBCPP cells have formed a multilayer, which does not represent the correct anatomical structure of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (where the choroid plexus epithelium is single-layered).\nAdd 500 μL trypanosome suspension (i.e., 5e6 trypanosomes / filter) into the HIBCPP filter inserts. Set up all experiments in biological duplicates.\nCritical: Do not add more than 500 μL medium to the upper reservoir in order to prevent spilling. If desired, apply only 450 μL to ensure that no medium passes along the outside of the filter into the lower chamber due to capillary action.\nIf desired, add chemical substances whose influence on transmigration is to be tested to the upper reservoir.\nFor single time point measurements: Incubate filter inserts at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere and 5% (v/v) CO2 for 2 h.",
    "For kinetic experiments: Prepare additional wells containing 1 mL HMI-9 in which the filters can be transferred after each time interval. Incubate filter inserts at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere and 5% (v/v) CO2.\nCollection of samples.\nFor single time point measurements: Carefully remove and discard the filter inserts.\nFor kinetic experiments: After each time interval, transfer the HIBCPP filter insert into the next well of the 24 well plate (as previously prepared; see 1g).\nCritical: Handle the plates with HIBCPP filter inserts with care to prevent spilling.\nResuspend transmigrated trypanosomes and transfer 500 μL of each well into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nFor kinetic experiments: Repeat steps 2b–d for each time interval.\nCritical: Try to keep plates always at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere and 5% (v/v) CO2.\nPerform gDNA isolation immediately or flash-freeze samples at −80°C.\nIsolation of gDNA.\nIsolate gDNA both from transmigration samples (see step 2c) and from standard concentrations. To prepare standard concentrations, you will need around 2.5e6 trypanosomes:\nDilute trypanosomes from steps 1b to 1e6, 1e5 and 1e4 cells / mL (2 mL each).\nUse 500 μL of the trypanosome standards for gDNA isolation.\nProduce standards at least as duplicates.\nIn general, gDNA is isolated as described in the QIAamp manual (version 05/2016, page 26, DNA Purification from Blood or Body Fluids – spin protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/ch/resources/download.aspx?id=62a200d6-faf4-469b-b50f-2b59cf738962&lang=en]). As we start with a higher sample volume than stated in the manual, the protocol has to be slightly modified. Changes from the manufacturer’s protocol are highlighted in bold:\nPipet 50 μL proteinase K into the bottom of a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 500 μL sample to the microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 500 μL Buffer AL to the sample and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s.\nIncubate at 56°C for 10 min.",
    "Briefly centrifuge the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid.\nAdd 500 μL ethanol (96%–100%) to the sample and mix again by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. After mixing, briefly centrifuge to remove drops from the inside of the lid.\nCarefully apply half of the lysate to the spin column (in a 2 mL collection tube) without wetting the rim. Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the filtrate and repeat the step with the remaining lysate. Place the spin column in a clean 2 mL collection tube.\nCarefully open the spin column and add 500 μL Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 × g for 1 min. Place the spin column in a clean 2 mL collection tube and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate.\nCarefully open the spin column and add 500 μL Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 3 min.\nPlace the spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old collection tube with the filtrate. Centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 1 min.\nPlace the spin column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate. Carefully open the spin column and add 200 μL Buffer AE or distilled water. Incubate at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 1 min, and then centrifuge at 6,000 × g for 1 min.\nQuantification of transmigrated trypanosomes\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThe number of transmigrated trypanosomes is analyzed by real-time PCR in relation to gDNA standards.\nSetting up qPCR.\nCalculate the number of samples to be analyzed.\nNote: Perform 2–3 technical replicates for each sample, standards, and negative probes.",
    "Prepare qPCR master mix for all samples, standards, and negative probes. The master mix will contain all PCR ingredients except DNA templates.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1994_5.csv\nDispense 18 μL of the master mix in each well of a 96 well qPCR plate.\nAdd 2 μL template DNA per well.\nCritical: Avoid cross-contamination by aerosol formation during tip shedding. We recommend working in a sterile bench and changing pipette tips outside the hood.\nSeal the plate and remove air bubbles by centrifugation.\nSet up qPCR cycler (also see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: We used the QuantStudio™ 3 Real-Time PCR System together with QuantStudio™ Design & Analysis software v1.4.3. The experiment type was set to “standard curve”.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1994_6.csv\nAlternatives: For quantification of transmigrated trypanosomes, cells collected from the lower well (see step 2) can be directly counted with a Neubauer improved (0.01 mm) counting chamber if the cell density is higher than 5e4 cells / mL. For lower concentrations, cells can be centrifuged and resuspended in a lower volume before counting. Quantification can also be performed by flow cytometry, either with fluorescent parasites, or parasites stained with a nuclear or membrane dye. This method is sensitive enough to detect 50 parasites in 100 μL using an Accuri™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1994-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
