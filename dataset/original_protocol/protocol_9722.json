    "The protocol was conducted in accordance with the animal experimental protocol (AC-AABD1552) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University.\n1. Preparation of Raman-dye-conjugated antibodies\nPrepare the conjugation buffer as ~0.1 M NaHCO3 in PBS buffer, pH = 8.3, store at 4 °C.\nPrepare N-hydroxysuccinimidy (NHS) ester-functionated MARS probe (Supplementary Material) solution as 3 mM in anhydrous DMSO. Synthesis of MARS probes can be referred to prior reports13,17,18.\n\tNOTE: For storage purposes, the dye NHS ester solution must be protected from light and kept at -20 °C.\nDissolve antibody solids in the conjugation buffer to a concentration of 2 mg/mL. For antibodies that are dissolved in other buffers, exchange them into the conjugation buffer to a concentration of 1-2 mg/mL with centrifugal filters.\n\tNOTE: Highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies are preferred for multiplex staining to minimize cross-species reactivity. The secondary antibodies used are listed in Table 1 and Table of Materials.\nPerform the conjugation reaction.\n\t\nFor secondary antibodies, add 15-fold molar excess of dye solution to the antibody solution in a glass vial slowly with stirring. For example, in 0.5 mL 2 mg/mL antibody solution, add 35 µL 3 mM dye solution.\nIncubate the reaction mixture at room temperature (RT) with stirring for 1 h. Protect the reaction from light.\nPurification.\n\t\nPrepare the slurry of gel filtration resin (Table of Materials) in PBS buffer, following steps 1.5.2-1.5.4.\nAdd 10 mL of gel filtration resin powder into 40 mL of PBS buffer inside a 50-mL tube.\nKeep the solution in a 90 °C water bath for 1 h.\nDecant the supernatant and re-add PBS to 40 mL. Store the slurry at 4 °C.\nPack the size exclusion column (1-cm diameter, gravity-flow columns) with the slurry solution to the height of 10-15 cm.",
    "Rinse and wash the column with ~10 mL of PBS buffer to further pack the resin.\nPipet the conjugation reaction mixture (~0.5 mL) to the column. Immediately add 1 mL of PBS buffer as the elution buffer when all reaction mixture is loaded. Constantly refill the elution buffer (PBS) to the column.\nCollect the eluate of the conjugate solution by looking at the color on the column (MARS dyes have light green to blue colors) or measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (A280).\nConcentrate the collected solution to 1-2 mg/mL with a centrifugal filter.\nDetermine the concentration and the average degree of labeling (DOL, dye-to-protein ratio) by measuring the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum of the conjugate solution with a Nano plate reader.\n\t​NOTE: Supplementary Material provides properties of MARS-dye NHS-esters for calculation. The normal DOL for the secondary antibody is around 3.\n2. Tissue sample preparation\nParaformaldehyde fixed mouse brain tissues.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mice (C57BL/6J, Female, 25 d postnatal) with isoflurane. Assess the proper anesthetization with a toe pinch test.\nKill the mice by cervical displacement. Perfuse the mice immediately with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS transcardially.\nCollect the mouse brain, following steps 2.1.4-2.1.5\nCut upward from the brain stem along the sagittal suture. Peel the two halves of the skull away to the side and scoop out the brain with a tweezer.\nFix the collected brain in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C for 24 h. Then, wash the brain in PBS buffer at 4 °C for 24 h to remove excess PFA.\nPlace solid agarose into water to a final concentration of 7% (w/v) in a beaker, with a loose lid. Stir the solution with a glass stirring rod. Heat the slurry in microwave until the solution is clear.\nAllow the agarose to cool to 45-55 °C.",
    "Pour the liquid agarose into a small chamber, then transfer the brain from PBS to liquid agarose and orient it with a spatula to embed the brain. Wait for the tissue-agarose block to harden.\nSection the tissue-agrose into 40-µm-thick coronal slices using a vibratome.\nTransfer the tissue to a 4-well plate for the following staining. Remove the agarose with a tweezer. Wash the tissue with 1 mL of PBS, three times.\nFixed frozen mouse pancreas tissues.\n\t\nFix the mouse pancreata in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C with rocking for 16-20 h.\nWash the sample in 1 mL of PBS (4 °C) three times to remove PFA.\nEmbed the sample (~0.3-0.5 cm in size) in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound blocks. Put 2 drops of OCT into a plastic cryomold. Place the tissue in correct orientation and pour OCT on top of tissues until none of the tissue remains exposed.\nSection the pancreata to 8-µm-thick slices and immobilize them onto a tissue binding glass slide, store them in -80 °C.\nBefore staining, equilibrate the specimen to RT. Wash the tissue with PBS to remove OCT blocks.\nFFPE samples.\n\t\nBake the FFPE tissue slide at 60 °C for 10 min.\nDeparaffinization and rehydration: Place samples sequentially in the following solutions in a 50-mL tube at RT for 3 min each time with mild shaking:\n\t\txylene two times,\n\t\tethanol two times,\n\t\t95% (vol/vol) ethanol in deionized water two times,\n\t\t70% (vol/vol) ethanol in deionized water two times,\n\t\t50% (vol/vol) ethanol in deionized water one time,\n\t\tdeionized water one time.\nTransfer the sample into 20 mM sodium citrate (pH 8.0) at 100 °C in a glass jar. Make sure the tissues are immersed in the solution.\nPut the jar in a 60 °C water bath for 45 min.",
    "Wash the sample with deionized water at RT for 5 min.\n3. Tissue immuno-eprSRS staining\nUse a hydrophobic pen to draw a boundary around the tissue sections on the slide.\n\tNOTE: A slide staining jar is used for following incubation steps of tissue on the slide. Floating tissues (40-µm-thick mouse brain sections) are stained in well plates.\nIncubate the tissues with 0.3-0.5% PBST (Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min.\nIncubate the tissues with blocking buffer (5% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min.\nPrepare the primary staining solution: add all primary antibodies to 200-500 µL of staining buffer (2% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) at desired concentrations. Centrifuge the primary staining solution at 13,000 x g for 5 min. Only use the supernatant if precipitates form.\nIncubate the tissue in the primary antibody solution at 4 °C for 1-2 days.\n\tNOTE: For staining tissue sections on the slide, put the sample in a staining box with a wet wipe to maintain humidity.\nWash the slides three times with 0.3-0.5% PBST at RT for 5 min each. Use 1 mL PBST for floating tissues. For tissues on the slide, wash the slides in a slide staining jar and make sure tissues are all immersed in the solution.\nIncubate the tissue in 200-500 µL of blocking buffer for 30 min.\nPrepare the secondary staining solution: add all secondary antibodies (and lectins if required) to 200-500 µL of staining buffer with desired concentrations (normally 10 µg/mL). Centrifuge the secondary staining solution at 13,000 x g for 5 min. Only use the supernatant if precipitates form.\nIncubate the tissues in 200-500 µL of secondary antibody solution at 4 °C for 1-2 days.\nWash the slides twice with 0.3-0.5% PBST at RT for 5 min each.",
    "Incubate with 200-500 µL of DAPI solution for 30 min.\nWash the slides three times with PBS at RT for 5 min each.\nFor floating tissue sections, transfer them to glass slides with a glass-dropping pipette. Spread the tissue with a tissue brush and clean the surrounding with wipes if needed.\nMount the tissue in a drop of antifade reagents with a glass coverslip and secure it with nail polish.\n4. SRS microscope assembly\nNOTE: A commercial confocal fluorescence system is used in tandem SRS-fluorescence imaging. More descriptions can be found in a prior report17. This protocol will focus on the SRS imaging side using narrowband excitation.\nPrepare a vibration-isolated optical table in a room with temperature control.\nPlace a synchronized dual-laser system (pump and Stokes) on the optical table (Figure 2A) with a chiller connected.\n\tNOTE: The fundamental laser in the dual-laser system provides an output pulse train at 1064 nm with 6-ps pulse width and 80-MHz repetition rate. The Stokes beam is from the fundamental laser. The intensity of the Stokes beam was modulated sinusoidally by a built-in electro-optic amplitude modulator (EOM) at 8 MHz with a modulation depth of more than 90%. The other portion of the fundamental laser is frequency-doubled to 532 nm, which is further used to synchronously seed a picosecond optical parametric oscillator (OPO) to produce a mode-locked pulse train with 5-6 ps pulse width (the idler beam of the OPO is blocked with an interferometric filter). The output wavelength of the OPO is tunable from 720-950 nm, which serves as the pump beam.\nMount the mirrors (wavelength range: 750-1100 nm), dichroic beam splitters (DBS, 980 nm long-pass filter, rectangular), and lens (achromatic, AR coating for 650-1050 nm) to their respective mounts. Use very stablekinematic mirror mounts for the mirrors and dichroic beam splitters.",
    "Measure the height of the laser output and the beam sizes of the pump and the Stokes beams. Adjust the height of mirrors and lenses to ensure the light will hit the center of all the optical elements.\nPlace mirror M1 on the optical table and make it ~45° to the laser output (Figure 2B). Use the knobs on the kinematic mount to make tip and tilt adjustments. Ensure the light travels at the same height along the length of the table and a straight line with respect to the table.\nPlace and align the dichroic beam splitters (980 nm long-pass filters) and mirrors to split the pump and Stokes beams (Figure 2A-B).\nPlace and align lens pairs (L1, L2, and L3, L4) on each of the beam paths to collimate the beams and expand the beam diameters to match the back pupil of the objective (Figure 2A-B).\nUse M7 and M8 mirrors to align combined laser beams into the microscope (Figure 2C). Align one beam into the microscope first and use the mirror pairs on the other beam to ensure the spatial overlap of the two beams.\nSet up the detection part.\n\t\nPut on an infrared-coated oil condenser (1.4-NA) to collect the forward-going pump and Stokes beams after passing through the specimens (Figure 2C).\nMount a large-area Si photodiode onto a shielded box with BNC connectors (Figure 2E). Add a 64-V DC power supply to the mounted photodiode to increase its saturation threshold and response bandwidth.\nReflect the forward-going light with a 2-inch mirror. Refocus the light onto the photodiode after an optical filter to block the modulating Stokes beam (Figure 2D).",
    "Send the output current of the photodiode to a fast lock-in amplifier terminated with 50 for signal demodulation. Send an 8-MHz trigger to the lock-in amplifier as the reference signal.\nSend the in-phase X-component of the lock-in amplifier into the analog interface box of the microscope.\nOptimize the temporal overlap with the built-in motorized delay stage by measuring the SRS signal of pure D2O liquid at the microscope.\n5. Image acquisition and analysis\nPerform multi-channel epr-SRS imaging with sequential pump wavelength tuning.\n\t\nSet laser power to Ppump = 10-40 mW and PStokes = 40-80 mW on the laser control panel.\nSet pixel dwell time to 2-4 µs and use multiple frames averaging typically 10-20 frames on the microscopy software.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid a combinatorial use of high laser power (Ppump> 40 mW, PStokes> 80 mW) and small pixel size (<0.2 µm), which likely cause 'bleaching effect' of Raman dyes due to multiphoton excitation.\nSet the time constants of the lock-in amplifier to half of the pixel dwell time.\nLinear spectral unmixing.\n\tNOTE: epr-SRS follows a strict linear signal-to-concentration dependence over the entire concentration range; thus, linear spectral unmixing is effective to remove any potential cross-talks between channels. For N-channel epr-SRS measurement with N MARS probes, measured signals (S) can be expressed as S = MC, where C is the MARS probe concentrations, and M is an N x N matrix determined by Raman cross-sections of MARS probes.\n\t\nMeasure matrix M on single-color immuno-eprSRS samples labeled with different MARS probes.\nUse equation C = M−1·S to determine the concentration matrix of the MARS probe with multiplex sample signal measurement S.\nSubscription Required.
