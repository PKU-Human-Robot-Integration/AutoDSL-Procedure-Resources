  "procedures": [
    "Clone the gene encoding the GRAS domain Os-SCL7 from rice (NM_001057650, residues 201-578) into the modified pET32a vector (pET32aM) (Figure 1).Transform the recombinant plasmid (OsSCL7201-578-pET32aM), which was verified by DNA sequencing, into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) by heat shock method (Hanahan, 1983) and plate on LB-agar plates containing 100 mg/L ampicillin for 12 h at 37 °C.Pick a single colony and culture the E. coli in 10 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C for 5 h. Then transfer 10 ml culture to 1 L fresh LB medium containing 100 mg/L ampicillin (in a 2 L flask) and culture at 37 °C until OD600 nm reaches 0.4-0.6. Cool the cultures to about 16 °C and then induce protein expression with 0.3 mM IPTG for 12-14 h at 16 °C, 180 rpm.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 8,800 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant, then suspend the cells in 50 ml lysis buffer by vortexing. Sonicate the resuspended cells on ice with the power of 380 W for 30 min (ultrasonication is set to 2 sec ‘on’ and 6 sec ‘off’, and repeat this cycle). Note: The proteins should always be kept on ice and avoided of high energy produced during the ultrasonicaton process. Having an interval time should be better in this process (here the ultrasonication process is set as three times with 10 min for each time and 2 min interval between every two times).After sonication, centrifuge the sample at 18,000 x g for 30 min. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube, add imidazole into the supernatant to a final concentration of 20 mM and mix it thoroughly. Keep the pellet (containing the cell debris and protein aggregates) on ice before being subjected to SDS-PAGE (step 11).",
    "Note: Adding a final concentration of 20 mM imidazole into the supernatant can effectively reduce non-specific proteins binding.Load the sample onto a nickel-sepharose affinity resin (Chelating sepharose Fast FLow) which was pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Elute the bound protein with lysis buffers containing a gradient of imidazole (10 mM, 20 mM, 50 mM and 500 mM).Subject the eluted protein mixed with loading buffer to SDS-PAGE (Figure 2a). The protein of interest should be between 45 kDa and 66.2 kDa, according to the molecular weight 59 kDa of OsSCL7 GRAS domain fused with TRX and 6His-tag.Note: In order to get high purity proteins, it’s better to use a series concentration of imidazole to wash the nonspecific binding proteins and make sure each concentration of imidazole could not nearly elute any protein (see Notes). The target proteins are in the 500 mM imidazole eluent. Add TEV protease to the eluted proteins of interest (mTEV:mprotein = 1:10) to remove the TRX and 6His-tag from OsSCL7 GRAS domain. Then transfer the mixture to a dialysis membrane and dialyze it in lysis buffer on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. Note: In this step, the lysis buffer is used to dialyze imidazole to a low concentration. Generally it is lower than 5 mM. Load the cleaved protein onto the nickel-sepharose affinity resin again. The target proteins are in the flow through and subsequent 20 mM imidazole eluent. The band of the target protein is between 35 and 45 kDa, according to the molecular weight 42 kDa of the OsSCL7 GRAS domain (Figure 2b). Then load the sample into a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with 1.2 column volume of chromatography buffer (Figure 3a). The samples of OsSCL7 monomer and dimer were assessed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 3b).",
    "Pool the fractions containing target protein and concentrate the sample to 5 to 8 mg/ml, measured by Bradford method on spectrophotometer device (Bradford, 1976), with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters for subsequent crystallization experiment."
