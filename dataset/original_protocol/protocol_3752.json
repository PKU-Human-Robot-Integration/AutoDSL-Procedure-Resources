    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe main steps are presented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], right column, in purple.\nInjection of synthetic mRNA encoding RNA-binding proteins of interest into embryos\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPreparation of microinjection mixture. We used a concentration of 70 ng/μL myc-ybx1 RNA mixed with vital FLD dye (the vital fluorescein lysine dextran dye is used to control the microinjected material in the embryos. It does not affect the development of the embryos or the translation of the injected RNA (Sive et al.,2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])).\nTypically, the total volume of the microinjection mixture is 10 μL. RNA is diluted on the basis of its concentration after purification, and 0.5 μl of FLD per mixture is added from a standard 50 μg/μL solution (see Solutions used for injection of synthetic mRNA).\nRNA and FLD is mixed immediately before injections, and all manipulations are performed on ice. The resulting mixtures must be centrifuged for 5 min at 13400 g at 4°C to prevent capillary clogging.\nNote: Tracer FLD is distributed more evenly in relation to mRNA. mRNA diffuses slowly from the injection site, and during cell division, the distribution can be uneven. To track the postinjection mRNA pathway more accurately, clone indicators such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA can be introduced together with the tested mRNA. Although the injection of indicator mRNA is useful, it is known to compete for translation with coinjected test RNA (K. Kintner, personal communication). In studies using mRNA microinjections of fluorescent proteins, we observed a visually uniform and extensive distribution of fluorescent protein products in embryos at late stages (Matz et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])\nFill the capillary with 10 μL of the mRNA-FLD mixture using the drawn-out tips.\nThe capillary is placed into the microinjector and broken off with a light touch (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/676-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. The main steps of capillary preparation (step 2, step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details])\n(A) Initial capillary\n(B) The capillary is broken off with a light touch.\n(C). Prepared capillary after tip break\nThe injection volume is calibrated by allowing the drop to hang at the end of the needle, where its diameter can be measured using an eyepiece micrometer and calculate the injected volume (v = 4/3 π r3, where v is the volume and r is the radius of the drop, or Table 8.1 in Sive et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] can be used).\nThe prepared embryos are injected into any area of both blastomeres (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The translation efficiency of the synthetic mRNA in embryos is highly variable between RNAs. Usually, mRNAs obtained as a result of transcription of the linearized pCS2MT vector provide a high level of protein expression in embryonic cells — up to 100 ng of protein per embryo (Martynova et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). After RNA purification with a CleanRNA Standard kit, a concentration of approximately 400 ng/μL is usually obtained. This concentration of the obtained RNA does not require additional concentration.\nIn the case of an insufficient concentration, precipitation of the RNA with a 70% ethanol solution containing 150 mM NaCl (incubated 2–24 h at −20°C) can be used, followed by washing with 96% ethanol, drying the resulting RNA precipitate and dissolving in it a small volume of RNAse-free water. The resulting RNA can be stored at −70°C for several months.\nCritical: Diluted RNA may degrade rapidly; therefore, it is best to reprecipitate it for long-term storage. In addition, to avoid the effects of thawing-freezing cycles, it is advisable to store it in small aliquots (10 μL) at −70°C.",
    "When working with RNA, separate pipettes, tips, and RNA-free water are used. To avoid the ingress of RNA-destroying enzymes during handling, rubber gloves are worn, preferably in a workplace specially designated for RNA extraction.\nIncubate the embryos in 4% Ficoll for 1–2 h and then place them in Petri dishes with 0.1× MMR (Solutions used for obtaining embryos) and incubate until the desired stage.\nNote: Working with X. Laevis. embryos is convenient because their development can be controlled by temperature. Using the development table (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), the incubation time can be adjusted by changing the temperature. Usually, at room temperature (18°C–20°C), embryos injected during the day reach the gastrula stage by the morning of the next day.\nPreparation of lysate from embryonic cells\nTiming: 45 min\nCollect embryos at the research stage (we work at the stage of middle gastrula, stage 11 according to the development table, Nieuwkoop table, see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E and Martynova et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], STAR Protocols: “The protocol for separation of the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fractions of Xenopus laevis embryonic cells for studying protein shuttling”). Place the embryos in Eppendorf tubes on ice, carefully remove the water, and add polysome lysis buffer (Buffers used for Immunoprecipitation of Ribonucleoprotein Complexes) with protease and RNase inhibitors at a rate of 10 μl of buffer per 1 embryo. We use 30 embryos at each point of the experiment (for each injection mixture). Embryos should be broken up by pipetting up and down several times. The mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein) lysate is allowed to incubate on ice for 5 min and is centrifuged for 30 min at 18000 g. Collect the supernatant carefully. (The bold layer on top can be collected if it is mixed with the supernatant; its inclusion will not affect the following steps.)",
    "We use 300 μl of mRNP lysate for each injection mixture. The lysates can be frozen (flash-freeze) and stored at −70°C, but freezing can affect the protein conformation and reduce the stability of the RNP complexes. Therefore, we use only fresh lysates for RNA precipitation. Five to ten microliters of lysate is added to an equal volume of 4× Laemmli buffer (Sample buffer for Western blot) for use in the Western blot analysis of tagged protein expression. The samples are boiled for 10 min at 80°C and stored at −20°C until use. Samples in Laemmli buffer can be stored for several months.\nCritical: It is important to collect live embryos containing the microinjected material. These can be detected by FLD fluorescence under a fluorescent microscope with a GFP filter. Dead embryos (easily visible as white spheres without dividing cells) non-FLD embryos are discarded (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and Martynova et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], STAR Protocols: “The protocol for separation of the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fractions of Xenopus laevis embryonic cells for studying protein shuttling”).\nPreparation of Myc-resin\nTiming: 30–45 min\nWe use a commercial agarose-based carrier with immobilized antibodies (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], Sigma, E6654 EZview Red Anti-c-Myc Affinity Gel). Each point of the experiment requires 50 μL of affinity gel.\nFor affinity gel blocking, add 250 μl of EZview Red Anti-c-Myc Affinity beads (used at 5 points in the experiment) to 1.5 mL of NT2 buffer that contains 5% BSA (in a 2-mL Eppendorf tube) and incubate for 10–30 min on a rotator at 20°C–22°C .\nTo wash the affinity gel, add 1.5 mL of NT2 buffer, mix it by inversion and centrifuge it at 2500 g.\nWash the gel 2–3 times.",
    "After washing, equilibrate the resin with 0.5 mL of the NT2 buffer with protease and RNase inhibitors (Buffers used for Immunoprecipitation of Ribonucleoprotein Complexes).\nCritical: To determine the amount of RNA nonspecifically bound to the affinity gel, we use a commercial FLAG gel — EZview Red ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], F 2426, Sigma) with antibodies against the FLAG peptide, which is not used as a tag in our experiments. The amount of gel used and the method of its preparation do not differ by experiment.\nNote: A major disadvantage of affinity-based molecular pull-down and immunoprecipitation procedures is that the affinity matrix is difficult to see in the microcentrifuge tube following centrifugation steps.\nWe used EZview ™ Red Affinity dye conjugated agarose (Sigma). The vivid red color of the affinity beads provides high visibility that allows easy differentiation of the pellet from the supernatant, therefore reducing the risk of accidental aspiration of the pellet and allowing for less tedious manipulations.\nImmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged ribonucleoprotein complexes\nTiming: 6 h\nDivide the washed and buffered resin by the number of samples into equal volumes. Centrifuge for 3 min at 2500 g, remove the supernatant.\nCritical: Do not centrifuge the Affinity Gel at high speed (not higher than 3 000 g), it may break down.\nDilute lysate and mixing with affinity gel\nResuspend Anti-c-Myc Affinity beads in 850 μL of ice-cold NT2 buffer. Add 200 units of an RNase inhibitor (5 μL RNase Out), 2 μL (to final concentration of 400 μM) Vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes, 10 μL of 100 mM DTT and EDTA to 20 mM and 2 μL Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Solutions used for Immunoprecipitation of Ribonucleoprotein Complexes).",
    "Thaw mRNP lysate on ice and centrifuge at 15 000 g for 15 min to clear lysate of large particles. Transfer cleared supernatant to microfuge tube and store on ice.\nAdd 100 μL of cleared lysate to bead mixture prepared in step 8a.\nCritical: This dilution of lysate is important to reduce unspecific binding (dilution of lysate performed according to Keene et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nImmediately flick tube several times with a finger to mix, and centrifuge briefly (within 15 s) at 3000 g to pellet beads.\nTo represent total cellular mRNA, remove 100 μL of supernatant, and add 1 mL of ExtractRNA to the sample, mix well by vortexing. Maintain at −20°C until use in step 16.\nNote: Since the amount of mRNA coprecipitated with the antibody is calculated as a percentage of the total input, this volume (approximately 11% of the total volume) is required to determine the total amount of mRNA at each point in the experiment and is taken directly from the tube where binding will take place before incubation.\nIncubate the mixture for 4 h at 4°C while tumbling end over end on a rotator at low speed.\nPellet beads by centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min and save supernatant for later analysis if desired. Supernatant may be stored at –20°C for several months.\nWash beads 4–5 times with 1 mL of ice-cold NT2 buffer by centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min and removing supernatant with a hand pipettor or an aspirator.\nCritical: Thorough washing is critical for reducing background. All tubes should be kept on ice as much as possible while working quickly during the washing process to reduce degradation.\nProteolysis and RNA isolation\nTiming: 40 min",
    "After the final wash, resuspend the beads in 100 μL of NT2 buffer. Proteinase K (30 μg per 100 μL of NT2 buffer) is added to release the RNP components. The mixture is incubated for 30 min at 55°C, the tube flicked occasionally with a finger.\nNote: To validate the immunoprecipitation results by Western blotting, 10 μL of the immune-bound complexes are mixed with 10 μL of 4× Laemmli buffer (Sample buffer for Western blot) and boiled for 10 min at 80°C. These complexes are stored at −20°C until use.\nRelease the RNP components and isolate the RNA from the immunoprecipitated pellet by adding 1 mL of ExtractRNA to the remaining 100 μL of the beads containing the protein-RNA immunocomplexes. The beads in solution are mixed well by vortexing 15 s to allow the elution of the RNA from the protein-antibody-bead complexes.\nNote: The sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of the ExtractRNA used for lysis.\nExtraction of mRNA\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIsolate RNA using ExtractRNA:\nIncubate samples at room temperature (22°C–24°C) for about 15 min.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed (12 000–15 000 g) at room temperature for 10 min.\nTake the supernatant into a new tube and add 0.2 mL of chloroform to it. Mix vigorously by inverting for 15 s.\nIncubate at room temperature for 2–3 min.\nCentrifuge samples at 12 000 g at + 4°C for 15 min.\nDuring centrifugation, the liquid is separated into three phases, take the upper aqueous phase containing RNA into a new tube and add 500 μl of isopropanol to it. Mix well by vortexing.\nIncubate the mixture for 10 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge samples at 12000 g for 10 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant carefully.",
    "Add 1 mL of 75% ethyl alcohol to the sediment along the wall of the test tube.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed (12 000–15 000 g) for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove supernatant\nAir dry the RNA precipitate.\nCritical: The RNA precipitate is allowed to dry for no more than 10 min. When working with RNA, it is important to prevent the precipitate from air-drying for a long time period, as this can negatively impact RNA solubilization.\nAdd 100 μl of RNase-free water to the dried RNA precipitate\nPurify RNA using CleanRNA Standard kit:\nAdd 350 μL of RNA Binding Solution (a part of the kit) to the sample. Vortex.\nAdd 250 μl 96% ethanol. Mix by inverting the tube.\nTransfer the sample to the spin column.\nCentrifuge for 30 s at maximum speed (12 000–15 000 g) to adsorb RNA on the column filter.\nWash RNA with RNA Wash Solution (a part of the kit) twice. Centrifuge the empty column for 5 min to completely dry the column filter.\nWash off RNA with 10–15 μl of RNase-free water heated to + 50°C (for better separation of RNA from the column).\nNote: Since there is little RNA, it is better to elute with the minimum possible volume of RNase-free water (10–15 μl)\nRNA concentration and quality can be assessed by an Implen NanoPhotometer. Usually, the concentration to use is approximately 100 ng/μl.\nRNA detection by RT-qPCR\nTiming: 4.5 h\nPrepare cDNA from the coIPed RNA sample and quantify the specific transcript abundance by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\nРerform the reverse transcription reaction with the MMLV RT kit. For the reverse transcription reaction, use 200 ng RNA template. Prepare mixture I in a sterile tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_676_18.csv",
    "Warm up the mixture for 2 min at 70°C and transfer the samples to ice. Add 10 μl of the premixed mixture II.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_676_19.csv\nAdd 1 μl of MMLV reverse transcriptase to the test tubes. Incubate the mixture for 45 min at 37°C. To inactivate the enzyme, heat the mixture for 10 min at 70°C.\nPause Point: cDNA can be stored at −20°C until use.\nTo carry out the PCR reaction, use the ready-made qPCRmix mixture in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_676_20.csv\nIntroduce the plate in the Thermal Cycler and set а program (an example is shown in Table PCR reaction protocol).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_676_21.csv\nNote: RNA target enrichment among the RBP-interactome can be calculated from RT-qPCR data following the pipeline explained in Quantification and Statistical Analysis section."
