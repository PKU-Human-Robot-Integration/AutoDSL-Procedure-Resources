    "All experiments strictly followed the animal welfare regulation, in agreement with German legislation, local stipulations, and in accordance with recommendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA). The application for approval of animal experiments has been approved by the responsible animal welfare authority, and all experiments were reported to our animal welfare representatives.\n1. Experiment preparation and materials\nOptical mapping setup\n\tNOTE: The optical setup, as well as the electrical setup, are shown in Figure 1. All components used in the optical and electrical setup are listed in detail in the Table of Materials.\n\t\nUse LED 1 and LED 2 for induction of arrhythmia and backup defibrillation. Choose high power LEDs with a wavelength λblue near 475 nm, which is the peak of the excitation wavelength of ChR26. To further narrow the optical spectrum, use a 470 ± 20 nm bandpass filter.\n\t\tNOTE: In this work, LED 1 and LED 2 have a typical radiant flux of 3.9 to 5.3 W, according to the datasheet20.\nIlluminate the epicardium for optical mapping with a high-power red LED (LED 3 in Figure 1), which emits light with a center wavelength of λred = 625 nm and a radiant flux of 700 mW21. The red light is filtered with a 628 ± 20 nm bandpass filter and reflected by a long pass dichroic mirror (DM) with a cutoff wavelength of λDM = 685 nm.\nUse an emission filter with λfilter-cam = 775 ± 70 nm in front of the camera objective to only record the fluorescence emission of the cardiac activity. Use a fast objective that is well suited for low light applications.",
    "NOTE: The frequency of fibrillation of a mouse heart ranges from 20 to 35 Hz; therefore, use a fast enough camera to record with a frequency of 1 to 2 kHz, or even higher.\nMicro-LED array\n\tNOTE: The micro-LED arrays applied here are realized using microsystems processing as further detailed elsewhere16,17.\n\t\nSpin coat a 5 µm-thick polyimide (PI) layer onto 4-inch silicon substrates (single-side polished, 525-µm thick).\nCure this PI layer at a maximum temperature of 450 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Keep the maximum temperature constant for 10 min.\nDeposit and pattern an image reversal photoresist (PR) using ultraviolet (UV) lithography and sputter deposit a 250-nm thin platinum layer (Pt).\nThicken this Pt-based metallization by electroplating a 1 µm-thick gold (Au) layer with the patterned PR serving as a masking layer.\nBefore spin-coating a second PI layer, expose the wafer with its first PI layer and the Au-electroplated metallization to an oxygen plasma that chemically activates the surface of the PI layer.\nCure the second PI layer again at 450 °C, apply UV lithography to pattern a PR layer and open the contact pads of the array for the micro-LED chips and the interfacing printed circuit board (PCB) by reactive ion etching (RIE) using the patterned PR as a masking layer.\n\t\tNOTE: In this RIE process steps, it is recommended to apply 200 W and 100 W for 10 and 30 min, respectively, to define the contact pad openings as well as the outer shape of the two-dimensional (2D) micro-LED array.\nStrip the PR using solvents and plasma etching. Further thicken the contact pads by electroplating an additional 6 µm-thick gold layer.\nAttach the micro-LED chips to the contact pads using a flip-chip bonder.",
    "Activate the PI surface in an oxygen plasma and underfill the micro-LED chips with a solvent-free adhesive. Cure then the adhesive for 12 h at 120 °C.\nTo encapsulate the micro-LED chips, perform another plasma treatment with Argon and apply a thin fluoropolymer layer manually. Pre-cure this layer at 80 °C for 1 h.\nManually apply silicone as the final encapsulation layer after exposing the micro-LED array to an oxygen plasma, used to improve the silicon adhesion to the underlying fluoropolymer layer. Cure the silicone layer at 80 °C and 180 °C for 1 h each. These final curing steps also cure the fluoropolymer layer completely.\nSolder the contact pads of the PI substrate to a printed circuit board which carries strip connectors for interconnection of the array to an external instrumentation. Cover the solder pads on the PCB using an adhesive.\nElectrical setup\n\t\nUse electrodes suited for recording an electrocardiogram (ECG), e.g., silver/silver-chloride electrodes or Monophasic Action Potential (MAP) electrodes and an ECG amplifier to monitor the electrical activity of the heart continuously. Furthermore, use an appropriate acquisition device (AD) to record all electrical signals obtained.\nChoose a well-suited driver for the high-power LEDs (LED 1, LED 2, and LED 3), which can manage the maximum current applied to each device. Use an arbitrary function generator (AFG) to control the output of the LED drivers accurately.\nUse a multi-channel LED driver to control the current flowing through the micro-LED array. An AFG with multiple outputs is as well suitable for this task.",
    "NOTE: It is advisable to choose LED drivers limiting the current to the maximum current of the micro-LED, otherwise the diodes might get damaged. One example of a multi-channel micro-LED driver is described in another work18. If necessary, the AFG or any other LED driver might be connected to a computer to remotely control the micro-LED settings. If this is the case connect the LED driver to the computer with the communication protocol of your choice, e.g., General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) or a serial connection.\n   \n2. Experimental procedures\nSolution preparation\n\t\nPrepare Tyrode's solution: 130 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 24 mM NaHCO3, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM Glucose, 0.1% BSA/Albumin.\nPrepare Low-K+ Tyrode's solution: Low-K+ Tyrode's is made in the same way as regular Tyrode's solution except that only half the amount of KCl is added (2 mM instead of 4 mM KCl).\n\t\t​NOTE: For an experiment lasting 3 h usually 2-3 L of Low-K+ Tyrode's (additionally mixed with Blebbistatin (Step 2.1.5) if optical mapping is performed) and 1-2 L of regular Tyrode's are sufficient.\nAdd Pinacidil to the Low-K+ Tyrode's solution to ease the process of arrhythmia induction, as described in22, to obtain a 100 mM concentration. Wear protective laboratory gloves when handling Pinacidil.\nPrepare 1 mL of 50 µM DI-4-ANBDQPQ with regular Tyrode's solution. Protect the dye from light to prevent photobleaching.\nMake a 10 mM stock solution of Blebbistatin. For optical mapping, mix Blebbistatin with the 100 mM Pinacidil-Tyrode's-solution (Step 2.1.3) to obtain a 5 µM solution. Wear protective laboratory gloves when handling Blebbistatin.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep both the dye and the Blebbistatin solution aside until optical mapping begins.\nLangendorff perfusion",
    "NOTE: The setup consists of two reservoirs for the two Tyrode's solutions. They are connected to a bubble trap via tubes with three-way cocks. The heart is later attached to the bubble trap by a Luer lock connector, and it is then suspended in a hexagonal water bath. The water bath is, in turn, connected to a waste container to collect the used Tyrode's solution.\n\t\nClean all tubes before every experiment with fully demineralized water.\nAerate both Tyrode's solutions with Carbogen (5% CO2 and 95% O2) for 30 min at room temperature before beginning of the experiment. Adjust the pH value of the Tyrode's solutions to 7.4 with NaOH.\nFill 500 mL of each Tyrode's solution in the corresponding reservoir and de-aerate the tubes as well as the bubble trap by running Tyrode's solution through the perfusion system until no more trapped air bubbles are seen in the tubes or in the bubble trap.\nContinue aerating the Tyrode's solutions during the whole experiment in the reservoirs with Carbogen to ensure that the pH of the perfusate remains stable later during perfusion.\nHeat the perfusion system to 37 °C with a water heat pump. Keep the perfusate temperature constant within the water bath by using an additional heating element such as a waterproof heating cable.\n\t\tNOTE: During the experiment, it is crucial to refill the Tyrode's reservoirs before they run empty. Otherwise, air bubbles can enter the heart, which can clog the vessels and lead to ischemia.\nMouse Preparation\n\t\nInject subcutaneously 0.1 mL of 500 I.E. Heparin 30 min before heart isolation procedure.\nFill a 6 cm Petri dish and a 2 mL syringe with ice-cold Tyrode's solution. Place under the stereoscopic microscope.",
    "Perform short time anesthesia of mice by a saturated Isoflurane environment for 2 min and immediate cervical dislocation afterwards.\n\t\t​NOTE: In order to verify sufficient anesthesia a check for the negative inter-toe reflex is absolutely necessary.\nOpen the chest, remove the heart, as described elsewhere23, and place it into the 6 cm Petri dish with ice-cold Tyrode's solution. Cardiac beating will be diminished due to temperature drop.\nDo the fine preparation under a stereoscopic microscope, as detailed elsewhere23. Attach the aorta onto the blunt needle and fix the vessel with suture material.\nAs a control, inject ice-cold Tyrode's solution through the needle into the heart and check that the heart is tightly mounted. This step also rinses the remaining blood out of the heart.\nTransfer the mounted heart to the perfusion system. Ensure that the perfusate is flowing to prevent air from entering the heart while connecting the needle with the bubble trap. Check that the heart is covered with Tyrode's solution in the water bath. Steps 2.3.4, 2.3.5, and 2.3.7 are illustrated in Figure 2.\nEnsure that the heart starts beating within a few minutes. Let the heart adapt to the perfusion setup for 15 to 20 min, then switch to low-K+ Tyrode's solution with Pinacidil (Step 2.1.3) respectively low-K+ Tyrode's solution with Pinacidil and Blebbistatin (Step 2.1.5) if optical mapping is to be performed.\nArrhythmia induction and optical defibrillation\n\t\nPlace one of the ECG electrodes as close as possible to the heart surface to ensure good signal quality. Suspend the second ECG electrode in the Tyrode's solution. Make sure that the ECG acquired is being recorded by the AD of choice.\nPlace the micro-LED array on the area of interest of the study, for example, onto the left ventricle.",
    "Change the perfusion to low-K+ Tyrode's with Pinacidil and perfuse the heart for 15 to 30 min.\nTo induce arrhythmia, illuminate the heart with LED 1 and LED 2 with a train of 20 to 50 light pulses with a frequency find of 25 to 35 Hz, pulse duration Wind of 2 to 15 ms, and light intensity LIopt_ind of 2.8 mW mm-2.\nRepeat the process until arrhythmia is induced.\n\t\tNOTE: Arrhythmias are easy to identify in the ECG signal because the frequency and morphology of the signal differ from normal sinus rhythm. Should the arrhythmia terminate within the next 5 s, classify it as self-terminated, and start a new induction attempt.\nOnce a sustained arrhythmia is visually detected, apply a burst of pulses with different widths Wdef and frequencies fdef, using three, six, or nine micro-LEDs of the array at a pulsing current Ipulse of 15 mA yielding to a light intensity LIµLED = 33.31 ± 2.05 mW mm-2.\nShould the arrhythmia keep ongoing after five micro-LED array-based defibrillation trials, classify the attempt as unsuccessful and start backup defibrillation.\nFor backup defibrillation, use LED 1 and LED 2 using the same timing parameters as set for the micro-LED array.\n\t\t​NOTE: Because the heart is exposed to ischemic and metabolic stress over the whole experimental period, it is possible that termination attempts of arrhythmia are unsuccessful even with backup defibrillation. Whenever this happens, change the perfusion solution to the regular Tyrode's and let the heart recover for 5 to 10 min. When the ECG returns to sinus rhythm, repeat the protocol from Step 2.4.3 again.\nOptical Mapping\n\t\nPerfuse the heart with the Blebbistatin solution prepared in Step 2.1.5 and wait until mechanical uncoupling occurs. This is accomplished when the heart stops beating, but an ECG signal is still measurable.",
    "NOTE: Mixing the Blebbistatin solution to the mentioned concentration and keeping the heart perfused with this solution maintains the cardiac mechanical activity uncoupled from the electrical activity during the whole experiment.\nGive the 1 mL voltage dye DI-4-ANBDQPQ (prepared in Step 2.1.4) as a bolus in the bubble trap of the Langendorff perfusion. Wait for 5 to 10 min to allow the dye to perfuse the heart uniformly.\n\t\t​NOTE: Avoid photobleaching of the dye by turning off the red light whenever no recording is being made. If the signal-to-noise ratio of the recording becomes too small (acquired signal is too noisy), repeat steps 2.1.4 and 2.5.2.\nFocus the camera onto the heart surface, turn on LED 3, and apply 1.27 mW mm-2 optical power.\nTurn off the laboratory lights and start recording. Ensure that an optical signal is being acquired by comparing the frequency of the obtained signal to the frequency of the recorded ECG. This ensures that the obtained optical signal is purely related to the electrical activity of the heart.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the fluorescence light emitted by the dye is very week, optical mapping is done in a dark room. This avoids signal interference from any other light sources.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
