    "Protein ExpressionTransformation: Transform the construct DNA pET-22b(+)-ALDHTt (Hayes et al., 2018) into E. coli BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells, via a standard heat shock in a water bath at 42°C for 30 s. Plate the resultant transformation on an agar plate supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and grow at 37°C overnight.Preculture: Innoculate 10 mL of LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin with one colony from the transformation plate, and incubate with agitation at 250 rpm and 37°C for 16 h.Main culture: Innoculate 1 L of ZYP-5052 auto-induction media (see Recipes below) supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin with 10 mL of preculture (1% v/v), and incubate with agitation at 200 rpm and 25°C for 48 h.Note: The main culture for expression is split, so as to have no more than 500 mL in a 2- L shake flask, for aeration purposes. Protein PurificationTransfer E. coli cells to 1 L centrifuge bottles, and harvest the cells via centrifugation at 6,000 × g and 4°C for 15 min.Note: Prior to cell collection, weigh the empty centrifuge bottles, to allow for determination of the cell mass after centrifuging. Discard the supernatant, and autoclave the waste.Weigh the cell pellet (typically ~35 g/L culture).Supplement the lysis buffer with 0.25 mg/mL lysozyme, 20 μg/mL DNase I, and 200 mM MgCl2. Resuspend the pellet in lysis buffer (see Recipes below), adding 5 mL of lysis buffer for every 1 g of cells present.Note: Resuspension of cells is carried out on ice using a 10-mL serological pipette for drawing the buffer-cell suspension up and down. If carried out at room temperature, this should be performed in a timely manner, as native cell proteases may degrade the desired protein. Store the cell lysate in aliquots of 50 mL in Falcon tubes at -80°C overnight.",
    "Note: Storage of cell lysate at -80°C overnight can be extended for up to 1 week. Thaw the cell lysate in a water bath at 37°C.Sonicate the cells using a probe sonicator with the power set between 60–70% (ultrasonic nominal output maximum of 200 W). Sonicate for 30 s, rest for 30 s, and repeat this process three times.Note: Sonication was carried out in a cold room at 4°C, with the cell lysate solution surrounded by ice. Heat the cell lysate in a water bath to 65°C for 15 min. Omission of this step results in an approximate 40% decrease in protein yield.Collect the cell debris via centrifugation at 34,000 × g and 4°C for 30 min. Remove the supernatant that contains the ALDHTt, and store on ice. Autoclave the collected cells prior to disposal.Note: Following the 30-min centrifugation for collection of the soluble fraction containing ALDHTt, the sample should be collected immediately after the centrifuge stops, to ensure the cells don’t re-enter solution. Filter the collected soluble fraction through a 0.45 μm nylon syringe filter, and store in a 50 mL Falcon tube on ice. Keep 1 mL of sample for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Pack an XK 16/20 column with approximately 10 mL of chelating Sepharose fast flow resin, and pre-equilibrate as follows. Using a peristaltic pump, deliver the following quantities of buffer to the column, at a rate of 1–3 mL/min: 0.5 column volume (CV) of 0.2 M EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7, 2 CV of 0.5 M NaCl, 2 CV of MilliQ water, 0.2 CV of 0.2 M NiSO4, 5 CV of MilliQ water, 5 CV of 20 mM sodium acetate, 0.5 M NaCl pH 4, and finally 2 CV of buffer A (see Recipes below).",
    "Load the entire filtered soluble fraction (approximately 80–100 mL from 1 L culture) onto the Ni-affinity column. Keep the solution on ice during loading. Collect the flow through for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Connect the column to the Akta Prime system, and start the IMAC purification.Wash the column with buffer A at 3 mL/min, until a stable (close to zero) Abs280nm is achieved.Elute proteins at 3 mL/min, via an imidazole step gradient of 50, 100, 200, and 500 mM (Figure 1), using a combination of buffer A and buffer B (see Recipes below). Only increase the concentration of buffer B, and thus imidazole, when the Abs280nm obtained from the previous concentration is stable. Collect a fraction from each elution for SDS-PAGE and Western blot.Note: ALDHTt should elute from Ni-affinity chromatography in the 200 mM imidazole fraction. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4401/bioprotoc-12-09-4401-g001.jpgFigure 1. Elution profile of ALDHTt via Ni-affinity chromatography. Chromatogram displaying purification of ALDHTt via Ni-affinity chromatography using a step gradient of imidazole from 50–500 mM. E. coli host proteins are eluted from 10–50 mM imidazole in the first two peaks, while ALDHTt is eluted at 200 mM imidazole in the third peak.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4401/bioprotoc-12-09-4401-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Dialyse with gentle magnetic stirring at 4°C overnight.",
    "Concentrate the protein sample using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters, 50 kDa MWCO (Merck Millipore), at 3,500 × g using 5 min spins, until a volume of approximately 1 mL (containing approximately 15–20 mg/mL) is obtained.Gel filtration chromatography: Pre-equilibrate the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column with 2 CV (240 mL) of gel filtration buffer (see Recipes below) at 1 mL/min. Load approximately 1 mL of concentrated ALDHTt protein sample onto the column using the injection loop on the Akta Prime system, and run at 1 mL/min for 120 min, with collection of the protein peak.Note: ALDHTt should begin to elute from gel filtration chromatography at approximately 65 mL. There should only be one peak on the gel filtration chromatogram. A slight shoulder at the start of the peak (on the left) can occur, but should not be collected. Pool the fractions from gel filtration chromatography (approximately 20 mL), and concentrate to 25–30 mg/mL (or as desired) using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters, 50 kDa MWCO (Merck Millipore), at 3,500 × g using 5 min spins, until the desired concentration is obtained.Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDropTM 1000 spectrophotometer, using a sequence-derived extinction coefficient of 1671 M-1 cm-1. Use gel filtration buffer as the blank.Prepare 30-μL aliquots, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen (LN2), and store at -80°C until further use. If the protein is to be used immediately, aliquot as desired, and store on ice until further use.ALDHTt Enzyme AssayAssay the ALDHTt, using hexanal as the substrate (2 mM) and NAD+ as the cofactor (2 mM), in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 8.Note: Hexanal is only slightly soluble in water, so stock solutions at low concentrations should be prepared. Solubility in water is ~6 g/L (60 mM).",
    "Shelf life of the hexanal solution prepared in buffer is one week. Program the spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller to analyse at 340 nm and 50°C for 2 min. Add a pre-equilibration step of 1 min, to ensure all solutions are kept at 50°C. A short analysis time of 2 min is utilised to avoid loss of volatile aldehyde substrates due to evaporation.Heat solutions of 5 mM hexanal, 10 mM NAD+, and 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 8 to 50°C, in a water bath.Note: The enzyme activity of ALDHTt can be analysed at 20–50°C. However, with decreased temperature a decrease in enzymatic activity is observed. Thaw a 30-μL aliquot of ALDHTt on ice.Dilute the ALDHTt to obtain a concentration of 0.38 mg/mL using gel filtration buffer, and centrifuge at 4,050 × g for 5 min.Note: Diluting the ALDHTt to a concentration of 0.38 mg/mL for the enzyme assay should be carried out using gel filtration buffer. For example, a 1:70 dilution of ALDHTt at a stock concentration of 26.65 mg/mL can be performed, by adding 10 μL of ALDHTt to 690 μL of gel filtration buffer. To a plastic cuvette, add 360 μL of 10 mM NAD+, 680 μL of 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 8, and 40 μL of ALDHTt at 0.38 mg/mL. Insert the cuvette into the spectrophotometer, to undergo equilibration at 50°C for 1 min.Add 720 μL of 5 mM hexanal to the cuvette and mix gently. Monitor the absorbance at 340 nm for 2 min, for the production of NADH.Note: Enzymatic assaying of ALDHTt should result in an increase in absorbance at 340 nm (a positive slope) when monitored at 50°C (Figure 3). Calculate enzyme activity employing Beer-Lambert’s Law, using the 6,220 M-1 cm-1 extinction coefficient of NADH at 340 nm (Equation 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220425/20220425200736_1825.",
    "jpg Note: One enzyme unit is equal to the production of 1 µmol/min NADH. l is equal to the path length of the cuvette, in this case l = 1 cm. Vol is equal to the volume of the cuvette, in this case vol = 1.8 mL. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4401/bioprotoc-12-09-4401-g003.jpgFigure 3.
