If working with cryopreserved CBMCs, start with preparation step 9.\nNote: The number of CBMCs harvested from cord blood varies between 3–10 × 106 CMBCs/mL. The minimal number of cells for a typical genotoxin assay, containing five genotoxin concentrations and one control condition is 6 × 107 CBMCs, requiring the input of 6–20 mL cord blood.\nNote: Make sure the umbilical cord blood is not harvested 48 h or more in the past – and is preferentially less than 24 h old to ensure a maximum output of viable CD34+ cells.\nNote: If not directly using all isolated CMBC cells, cells may be frozen, described after preparatory step 4, and can later be thawed using steps 8–18.\nDilute umbilical cord blood 1:1 with an equal volume of Wash medium.\nIsolate the mononuclear fraction from the sample using a density gradient separation medium such as Ficoll or Lymphoprep.\nFor the gradient separation add 15 mL of Lymphoprep to a 50 mL tube or use a pre-filled density gradient separation tube.\nTilt the tube at 45 degrees and layer the diluted cord blood dropwise on top of the Lymphoprep layer such that the density gradient separation medium and diluted cord blood are not mixed. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1627-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. CMBC isolation by density gradient separation\n(A) 50 mL tubes with the 1:1 Cord blood and wash medium mixture layered on top of the density gradient separation medium. Several minutes after layering, some blood clumps can sink into the density gradient separation medium (left 50 mL tube). This will not affect CMBC yield or quality.",
    "(B) Example of successful density gradient separation. Different fractions of cord blood are indicated in the figure, with the CMBCs layer located between the plasma and density gradient separation medium. Note: In this example, a 50 mL tube with porous membrane was used.\nNote: For easy layering of diluted cord blood pre-filled density gradient separation tubes with insert can be used, such as LeucoSep or SepMate.\nSeparate blood fractions by centrifuging the tubes and spin at 400 × g for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: To keep separation layers intact, set acceleration at a low setting, and decelerate without brakes.\nUse a pasteur pipette or 5 mL pipette to carefully pipette the CBMC layer on top of the ficoll layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: As density gradient separation medium is toxic to cells, avoid pipetting the density gradient separation medium during this step.\nWash the CBMC suspension twice by adding two times 20 mL wash medium and spin down the cell suspension at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nResuspend cells in 10 mL wash medium and count cells using trypan blue and a hemacytometer.\nAdd 10 μL resuspended cells and 10 μL 0.4 trypan blue and mix well by pipetting.\nDetermine the average number of live cells in each of the four corner squares (4 × 4 smaller squares each). Live cells do not take up dye, in comparison to dead cells which are stained by the trypan blue.\nMultiply by 1 × 104 to obtain the number of live cells/mL.\nNote: The recommended number of CD34+ cells for each exposure condition is 1 × 105, for which a starting number of approximately 1 × 107 CBMCs is required.\nOptional: The surplus of CBMCs may be viably frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen:",
    "Resuspend CBMCs with cold FBS at 108 cells/mL by gentle pipetting.\nAdd an equal volume of cold freezing medium dropwise to the cell suspension while gently shaking the tube to obtain a final solution of 10% DMSO in FBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to 1 mL cryogenic vials (maximum final concentration: 5 × 107 cells/mL) and freeze cells immediately in a controlled-rate cell freezing (−1°C/min) container at –80°C. After 24 h, store cryogenic vials in a liquid nitrogen tank.\nCritical: Exposure to 10% DMSO is toxic for cells. To obtain a maximum number of viable cells after thawing, minimize the time between DMSO addition and freezing.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant and continue with step 19: “Isolating CD34+ cells from CBMCs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].\nIf starting from cryopreserved CBMCs\nNote: Prewarm the Wash medium at 37°C before starting.\nTake the cryogenic vial containing the CBMCs from the liquid nitrogen tank and thaw rapidly in a 37°C water bath.\nTransfer cells immediately to a 50 mL conical tube. Rinse vial with 1 mL prewarmed Wash medium and add this to the cells in the 50 mL tube drop by drop.\nNote: You may pool multiple vials from the same biological sample.\nSlowly add 20 mL warm Wash medium in a dropwise manner.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant, leave 2–3 mL to resuspend pellet.\nGently add 15 mL of Wash medium to the cells while shaking the tube.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in the remaining volume of medium. Add up to 10 mL with medium and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Count cells using 0.4% trypan blue and a hemacytometer. The recommended number of CD34+ cells for each treatment is 1 × 105, for which a starting number of approximately 1 × 107 CBMCs is required.\nNote: As cell numbers decrease upon thawing, recovery of 20%–50% of the original frozen cells is expected, with a cell viability ranging between 75% and 95%.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant and continue with step 19: “Isolating CD34+ cells from CBMCs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].\nIsolating CD34+ cells from CBMCs\nTiming: 2 h\nCD34 is a well-established marker of human HSPCs (Stella et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). In this step, HSPCs are enriched using magnetic-activated cell sorting with anti-CD34 magnetic beads using the MACS system from Miltenyi Biotec. Alternatively, other magnetically based separation systems, such as the EasySep system from STEMCELL Technologies may be used. A yield of approximately 0.1%–0.5% CD34+ CB-HSPCs can be expected.\nPrepare 25 mL HSPC Complete medium using the recipe provided in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nPerform magnetic isolation of CD34+ cells using MACS system from Miltenyi Biotec (optimized protocol). The buffer volumes indicated in the steps are for up to 108 CMBC cells as input, and using at least 5 × 107 cells is recommended. The number of input cells can be increased above 108 to up to 2 × 109 cells, by increasing all volumes accordingly (e.g., 600 μL MACS buffer in step 20d for 2 × 108 CMBCs as input source).\nSpin down the cells at 350 × g for 5 min, 20°C–25°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 10 mL of MACS buffer and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nSpin down the cells at 350 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Aspirate supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 300 μL MACS buffer.\nAdd 100 μL of FcR blocking reagent. Vortex the reagent bottle before using.\nAdd 100 μL of CD34+ beads and mix well. Incubate for 30 min on ice. In case of a high number of cells ( > 108 cells), mix the vial again after 15 min and place it back on ice.\nWash cells by adding 5 mL MACS buffer, centrifuge 350 × g for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nAssemble the magnet on the holder and position the separation column correctly (the wings on the bottom of the separation column must be visible, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B of (Rodríguez et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])). Also, place a collection tube under the column for the liquid collection.\nPrepare the MACS column for the separation by adding 3 mL MACS buffer.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL MACS buffer and add the suspension onto the column. Discard flow-through.\nWash the MACS column 3 times with 3 mL of MACS buffer, discard flow through.\nRemove column from the magnet and place it on top of new 15 mL tube.\nAdd 5 mL MACS buffer on top of column and gently plunge the MACS column dropwise. The flow-through is the cell suspension enriched for CD34+ cells.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 350 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of HSPC Complete medium.\nCount cells twice using 0.4% trypan blue and a hemacytometer.\nSeed isolated CD34+ cells at a density of 2.5 × 104 to 3 × 104 cells/mL in a 6- or 12-well plate filled with 3 or 2 mL HSPC Complete medium, respectively. Total cell counts for 6 and 12-well plates are 7.5–9 × 104 and 2.5–3 × 104 cells respectively.",
    "Critical: To enable accurate cell counts after exposure, seeding the same number of cells in each well is crucial.\nPlace the plate in a humidified, 37°C, hypoxic (5% O2) incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nExposure of CD34+ cells to genotoxic compound(s)\nTiming: 3–8 days\nAfter 24 h of recovery, CD34+ CB-HSPCs are treated with the compound/exposure of choice. To both ensure clonal outgrowth and ensure sufficient exposure, the compound/exposure is titrated to a level resulting in 40%–60% lower cell expansion (approximating IC50) after 3–4 days compared to cells treated with the appropriate solvent control. The compound/exposure is incubated with the cells for 72 h to allow replication and incorporation of DNA mutations.\nNote: In addition to chemical compounds, such as genotoxic drugs, the assay can easily be modified to study the mutagenic effects of other external exposures, such as radiation. This exposure needs to be administered after 24 h of recovery at step 1. This time point is chosen to ensure cells have been recovered and can undergo division cycles in the next 72 h, to fix the mutation in the genome. In the example X-ray data indicated by Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] we used a Precision CellRad benchtop irradiator, exposing for 1 hit, 2 Gy at maximum voltage (130 kV) and intensity (5 mA).\nAfter 24 h of incubation, add the compound to the cells in the same solution volume. For the control condition, add the same volume of the dissolvent (PBS/DMSO).\nPlace the plate back in the incubator for 72 h.\nAfter 72 h, transfer cell suspension to a conical 15 mL tube and pellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate supernatant, resuspend in 1 mL FACS buffer and transfer to a 1.5 mL microtube.",
    "Count cells using 0.4% trypan blue and a hemacytometer and use the resulting cell counts from the unexposed control to count relative survival for all exposure concentrations.\nUse these relative survival values to calculate a dose-response curve using the R package ‘drc’, and extract IC40 and IC60 concentrations. Format the input data, named in this example surv_table, using the following structure:\n> surv_table\n    Concentration_nM  Relative_survival\n1  0                    1\n2  10                  0.448\n3  33                  0.344\n> Dr.m = drm(formula = Relative_survival ∼ Concentration_nM,\n            data = d_r, fct = LL.4(names = c(\"Hill slope\",\"Min\", \"Max\", \"EC50\")))\nExtract from the Dr.m object the IC40 and IC60 values.\n> drc::maED(object = DR.m, fctList = list(LL.4()),c(40,60))\nCritical: If already one exposure concentration is within the IC40-IC60 interval, this sample can be used to proceed with for single cell CB-HSPC sorting in steps 30–38. In case none of the exposed conditions falls within the IC40-IC60 interval, repeat the exposure experiment with a higher/lower dose of treatment/exposure.\nHSPC sort and clonal expansion\nTiming: 1 day of preparatory work / 4–5 weeks culture time\nAfter 72 h of incubation in the presence of an exposure concentration, exposed and control cells are stained using a combination of surface markers to define the CB-HSPC population. These CB-HSPCs are sorted as single cells using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). For a representative example of the gating strategy employed see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1627-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Sorting strategy of CD34+ HSPCs\n(A) Gate selecting cells based on side-scatter area and forward scatter area.\n(B) Gate selecting single cells based on forward scatter height and forward scatter area.\n(C) Lineage-negative cells selection based on lineage-FITC markers (Lin-CD16-CD11c-).\n(D) Gating of Lin-CD34+ cells. Threshold for CD90+ is for information only, this threshold is not used to gate and sort cells.",
    "(E) Further gate Lin-CD34+ for CD45RA- and CD38- status to select for CB-HSPCs. This gate is the gate that is used to single cell sort CB-HSPCs.\nPrepare FACS buffer and keep on ice.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPrepare 50 μL 2× HSPC staining mixture according to the recipe provided.\nNote: The total volume is distributed between the conditions to take along for HSPC sorting. As a rule of thumb, for approximately 1 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells, 10–20 μL 2× HSPC staining mixture is needed.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in an equal volume of FACS buffer and 2× HSPC mixture.\nIncubate for 1 h on ice in the dark.\nPrepare a 384-well-plate with 75 μL HSPC Complete medium per well, except the outer wells. One half of a 384-well plate is required for one condition (genotoxin concentration). This should result in at least 8 clonal expansions, which is sufficient for downstream sequencing analyses (see introductory note step 6, Variant calling and filtering).\nNote: Fill all outer wells with 75 μL PBS or MilliQ water to prevent evaporation of the HSPC Complete medium in the inner wells.\nSort single cell HSPCs with the gates set for single cells Lin-CD34+CD38-CD45RA- according to the following steps:\nNote: Sorting equipment may vary on facility availability. In all our experiments, we have made use of a Sony SH800S cell sorter using a 100 μM filter chip, sorting at a maximal speed of 2,000 events/second.\nFirst, exclude non-cell events by setting a ‘cells’ gate including all larger elements (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSecond, sort only single cells by removing all cells with a larger forward-scatter-area (FSC-A) compared to forward-scatter-height (FSC-H) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Set a gate for all FITC unmarked Lin- cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) to exclude differentiated cell types.\nSet a gate for CD34+ cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, vertical bar).\nOptional: A distinction can be made between CD90+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and CD90- multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which is indicated by the upper and lower gates.\nGate for CB-HSPCs by setting a gate for CD38- CD45RA- cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) and sort these cells in a 384-well plate.\nWrap the 384 well culture plate (with lid) in transparent polyethylene wrap and directly transfer to a humidified, 37°C, hypoxic (5% O2) incubator with 5% CO2.\nAllow single cells to expand clonally for 4–5 weeks.\nPause point: Clonal expansion till confluency typically takes 4–5 weeks. During this time, plates can be inspected (once/twice a week) to keep track of the clonal outgrowth using a light microscope.\nHarvesting HSPC clones, DNA extraction and WGS\nTiming: 1 day of preparatory work; 1 week sequencing\nIn this step, expanded HSPC clones are harvested, and sequenced, which have expanded sufficiently during 4–5 to allow for enough DNA to perform WGS. Clones to be harvested should cover at least 50%, see example of a fully confluent HPSC clonal expansion in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1627-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. CB-HSPC clonal outgrowth\nCenter of a single well from a 384 well-plate containing a 100% confluent clonal expansion after 4 weeks. Scale bar indicates 100 μm.\nNote: To enable filtering for patient-specific germline mutations, sequencing DNA from at least three CB-HSPC clones from the same donor is required.\nTo prevent cells sticking to the pipette tip, which reduces DNA yield, coat the tip of the pipet with cold HSPC harvesting buffer by pipetting HSPC harvesting buffer up and down.",
    "Fiercely pipet up and down the medium in the well with a pipet set at 75 μL and collect the cell suspension in a labeled 1.5 mL DNA LoBind microtube.\nRinse the well with 75 μL of cold HSPC harvesting buffer.\nNote: Make sure to scratch the bottom surface of the well, including the corners. As cells may stick to the bottom of the well, check under the microscope to make sure you have collected all cells present in the well.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350 × g for 5 min at 8°C and remove the supernatant.\nPause point: The pellet can be stored frozen at −20°C for at least 6 months. Freeze cells within 1 h after harvesting.\nIsolate DNA using the Qiagen QIAmp DNA Micro kit following the “Purification of genomic DNA from cultured cells using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit” User-developed protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-dna-kits/?catno=56304[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-dna-kits/?catno=56304]) using the following adjustments:\nAdd 2 μL of RNase A after addition of buffer AL, incubate for 2 min before adding proteinase K.\nIncubate for 30 min at 56°C instead of 10 min.\nElute the DNA by loading the column with 50 μL of Low TE buffer, reload the eluate on the column and spin again for optimal yield.\nDetermine the DNA concentration using Qubit using 1 μL eluted DNA for each clone. The expected yield varies between 0.5 to 3 ng/μL. The minimal recommended DNA yield to proceed for whole genome sequencing is 1 ng/μL.\nUse at least 25 ng (50 ng recommended when available) of genomic DNA and construct whole genome libraries using a Truseq Nano kit, using a 500 bp insert size. For full instructions, see the TruSeq® Nano DNA Library Prep Reference Guide by Illumina.",
    "Sequence each library on an Illumina Nextseq or Novaseq 2 × 150 bp to an average coverage depth of 15×.\nVariant calling and variant filtration\nTiming: 1 week\nFor reliable downstream mutation analyses, a true positive rate for somatic variants of > 90% is required. Our approach implements the GATK best practices for data pre-processing and genotyping using the GATK HaplotypeCaller (NF-IAP), after which variants are extensively filtered using a python-based filtering scripts (SMuRF). Alternative somatic variant calling pipelines and filtering strategies may be used when yielding a sufficient fraction (> 90%) of true somatic variants.\nCritical: The number of germline variants present in the genome of a typical CB-HSPC far exceeds the number of somatic mutations, even after genotoxic exposure. To ensure filtering of all germline variants, WGS data from the same cord blood donor must be used within each NF-IAP and SMuRF run.\nPerform BWA read mapping, quality control, GATK variant calling, variant filtering and variant annotation using the NF-IAP pipeline.\nFirst, configure the run.config file, provided as a template template_run.config. setting the folder containing all FASTQ files at ‘fastq_path’.\nFrom /path/to/output/donorX/NF_IAP/, run:\n$ nextflow run /path/to/scripts/NF-IAP/nf-iap.nf \\\n    $  -c {run.config} \\\n    $  --out_dir $PWD -profile slurm\nNext, perform further variant filtering and annotation using SMuRF to obtain high-quality somatic mutations.

Due to the relatively low sequencing depth, false positive allelic imbalances can be detected, which can be removed from each linx.vis_sv_data.tsv, here loaded as SV_table:\n> SV_table = read.delim(“/GRIDSS_PURPLE_LINX_output/donorX_treatment1_clone1.txt”)\n> SV_table = SV_table[!grepl(\"LOW_VAF|INF|Inf|SGL\", SV_table$Type),]\n> SV_table = SV_table [!grepl(\"LOW_VAF|INF\", SV_table$ResolvedType),]\nOptional: To validate the true positive rate of structural variants, it is advised to check the SV positions in the original BAM files using the (IGV).\nUse the plot_circos function, provided in the supplementary code to generate a circos plot, to plot all true-positive structural variants from a list of sv_tables (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F):\n> plot_control = plot_circos(list(SV_table_control1,\n                                  SV_table_control2))\n> plot_treatment = plot_circos(list(SV_table_treatment1,\n                                      SV_table_treatment2))"
