    "When using other liposomal reconstitution procedures not based on preformed liposomes as described here, skip sections A and B and start at section C.Liposome preparationSince lipids stick to plasticware, glassware has to be used until liposomes are formed. Furthermore, chloroform can extract components from plasticware, reinforcing the need to use glassware. Glass tubes as well as Hamilton syringes are used for the lipid film preparation. To reduce unwanted evaporation of chloroform during pipetting, lipid stocks are handled on ice.Note: Chloroform is a hazardous solvent. Conduct all work in a fume hood while wearing proper protective clothing. Lipids are received in chloroform packaged in sealed glass ampoules; store at -20 °C until use.Note: For long-term storage, evaporate the solvent and store the lipids at -80 °C to avoid oxidation of unsaturated lipids. To prepare lipid stocks, transfer 10 mg aliquots from the Avanti glass ampoule into glass screw neck vials. Evaporate the solvent from the glass vials in a desiccator at 250 mbar for 3 h with an additional incubation for 1 h at 30 mbar. Close the vials with screw caps and store at -80 °C until further use.Remove desired lipid stocks from freezer, place on ice, and dissolve in methanol:chloroform (1:1, v/v) to a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/mL.Note: Lipids other than POPC and POPG may have limited or very poor solubility in chloroform:methanol and require a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water. For a ratio of 9:1, transfer 450 µL of 10 mg/mL POPC and 50 µL of 10 mg/mL POPG into a grounded round bottom glass tube for a final lipid film of 5 mg.Dry lipid film in a rotary evaporator at 150 mbar until no residual solvent is visible.Go down to the lowest possible pressure (here 30 mbar) and dry lipid film for an additional 1 h.",
    "Rehydrate the lipid film (5 mg, greasy film in the bottom of the tube, appearance ranges from clear to whitish depending on lipid composition) with 334 μL of reconstitution buffer (see Recipe 1) to yield a final lipid concentration of 15 mg/mL (approximately 20 mM total phospholipid). Complete rehydration is achieved by addition of a glass bead and vortexing until no lipid film is visible on the tube bottom anymore, but for a minimum of 5 min.Note: The mixing of the lipid film with aqueous solution results in spontaneous formation of liposomes.Subject the lipid solution to five freeze-thawing cycles by placing the tube alternating into liquid nitrogen for 30 s for freezing and in a water bath at 50 °C for 90 s for thawing.Note: Wear face shield and insulating gloves when handling liquid nitrogen. Use glass tubes with high thermal shock resistance. Assemble the Avanti mini extruder according to the manual with two filter supporters on each side and two 200 nm pore sized polycarbonate membranes in between.Check tightness by flushing with 1 mL of reconstitution buffer (see Recipe 1), i.e., pass back and forth between syringes three to four times. Only continue if the buffer volume stays the same for each passing.Note: In the first passage, buffer volume can be reduced due to the void volume of the extruder. Fill one Hamilton glass syringe with approximately 334 µL of liposome solution and place the filled syringe into one end of the mini extruder.Carefully place an empty syringe into the opposite end of the mini extruder. The plunger of theempty syringe should be moved completely into the syringe barrel.Perform manual extrusion through assembled Avanti mini extruder with 21 passages.",
    "Note: Number of passages needs to be uneven to finish in the other syringe, as residual suspension in the starting syringe might have never passed the extruder. Final liposomes can be stored in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes in the fridge for up to two weeks.ReconstitutionNote: Reconstitution is performed here by using detergent-mediated vesicle destabilization (Rigaud et al., 1988). The method was optimized for the needs of the used protein. For detailed reviews on this topic see Amati et al. (2020). Dilute 66 μL liposome suspension (4–5 mM lipid concentration) with 124 μL of reconstitution buffer (see Recipe 1) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Destabilize liposomes with 9 μL of detergent (45 mM final concentration, OG stock, see Recipe 2) with 5 min head-over-head rotation.Note: Addition of the appropriate amount of detergent can be monitored by measuring light scattering of the liposome-containing solution at 600 nm using a spectrofluorometer. With increasing concentrations of detergent added to the vesicles, the absorbance starts to decrease (point of detergent saturation) until complete solubilization of the vesicles. The best stage for protein insertion for AHA2 was on the turning point between detergent saturation and total solubilization of the liposomes. Add 25 μg of purified AHA2 (in storage buffer, see Recipe 3) to the liposome–detergent mixture and incubate with head-over-head rotation for another 5 min.Meanwhile, prepare the G50 filtration column: cut two filter supporters from the side to the middle and place in a disposable 2 mL syringe without the plunger to create a stopper. Place syringe into a disposable 15 mL reaction tube, add 3 mL Sephadex G50 fine slurry (see Recipe 5), centrifuge at 180 × g for 5 min, and transfer column to a new 15 mL reaction tube (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4542/bioprotoc-12-21-4542-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of G50 column.",
    "(1) Two filter papers are cut from the side up to the middle. (2) After wetting the papers with the reconstitution buffer, they are inserted into a plastic syringe without the plunger. (3) The pre-soaked G50 slurry is applied to the syringe, which is placed in a 15 mL tube. (4) After centrifugation (180 × g for 5 min) the G50 column is transferred to a fresh 15 mL tube and is ready to use.Add lipid–protein–detergent suspension on top of the column and incubate for 5 min.Centrifuge at 180 × g for 8 min.Note: This size-exclusion column is trapping free detergent, i.e., OG. Transfer the flow-through to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.Note: The wider bottom of the 2 mL compared to the 1.5 mL tube is important for better rotation and mixing of the liquid in the next step. Add 50 mg of pre-washed BioBeads (see Recipe 6) to the sample and incubate for 60 min, with head-over-head rotation.Note: BioBeads are hydrophobic and extract the leftover detergent from the liposomes by adsorption. Punch a small hole in the bottom of the 2 mL microcentrifuge tube with a 26-gauge needle and place it in a 15 mL reaction tube.Note: The plastic is thickest at the center of the bottom; punch next to this for easier handling. Punch a hole in the lid of the 2 mL microcentrifuge tube for pressure equilibrium and centrifuge at 180 × g for 30 s to separate liposome sample from pre-washed BioBeads.Move the flow-through to a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Store in the fridge for up to four days, use as soon as possible.Asymmetric protein labeling and analysisLiposomes containing the reconstituted SNAP-tagged membrane protein are labeled separately or sequentially with membrane-impermeable and permeable SNAP dyes as outlined in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4542/bioprotoc-12-21-4542-g003.jpgFigure 3. Double labeling assay workflow.",
    "The proteoliposome sample is split into conditions I, II, and III. Sample I is only labeled with the membrane-impermeable SNAP-Alexa488 and serves later as bleed-through correction. Sample II is labeled with the membrane-permeable SNAP-647-SIR for the 100% labeling signal. Sample III is labeled with the membrane-impermeable SNAP-Alexa488 first, to block all the outward-facing proteins, and in a second step with the cell-permeable SNAP-647-SIR to obtain a signal corresponding to the inward-facing proteins. Samples are prepared in duplicates and loaded on an SDS-PAGE. Gel is sequentially imaged for in-gel fluorescence in green and red channels and subsequently stained for total protein amount via colloidal Coomassie staining.Dilute SNAP dye stock 1:100 with reconstitution buffer supplemented with 1 mM DTT (added from a 0.5 M DTT stock, see Recipe 4) to yield a 10 µM diluted stock.Pipette 10 µL of liposome suspension (approximately 62.5–125 µg protein, 5–10 pmol) in six 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. This corresponds to the three different sample types (I, II, III) in duplicates.Add the impermeable SNAP-dye in a 1:2 (mol protein:mol dye) excess (1–2 µL from 10 µM SNAP-Surface Alexa488 diluted stock) to sample I and II.Incubate for 2 h at 25 °C.Note: To achieve maximum labeling of the protein, use an excess of the dyes (at least 1:2, mol protein:mol dye) and test different incubation times until the labeling intensity does not further increase. We have experienced slower labeling with the red SNAP-Cell 647-SIR compared to the green dye SNAP-Surface Alexa488. Add membrane-permeable dye (1–2 µL from 10 µM SNAP-Cell 647-SiR diluted stock) to sample II and III.Incubate for 2 h at 25 °C.Note: Consider testing different times to reach maximum labeling. Stop reaction by adding 5 µL of Laemmli buffer (see Recipe 7).Load samples directly on 10% 1.5 mm SDS gel (see Recipe 10).",
    "Note: Membrane protein samples are not boiled before loading to prevent aggregation. Use marker for the molecular weight (e.g., 3 µL of PageRulerTM Plus Prestained Protein Ladder, 10–250 kDa).Run SDS-PAGE for approximately 2 h at 100 V, until running front is 0.25 cm from the end of the gel.Take the gel out of the cassette and image with Chemidoc imager with pre-programmed option for Alexa488 (460–490 nm, 530/28 nm filter) and Alexa647 (625–675 nm, 695/50 nm filter).Note: Adjust exposure times so that the signal is not saturated, since we want to quantify it. Due to the weak signal of some SNAP dyes exposure, times up to 10 s might be used. First, take an image of the entire gel to see the free dye; most of the actual protein–dye conjugate is not yet visible. Afterwards, cut the lower part containing the free dye. Take a second image with higher exposure time to properly visualize the protein-dye bands. Save the images as ImageLab inbuilt data format “.scn.” Exemplary results from dual color labeling experiment are shown in Figure 5.Colloidal Coomassie staining, according to Dyballa and Metzger (2009)Transfer the gel into a bowl with ddH2O and shake twice for 10 min to get rid of residual SDS.Stain shaking in Colloidal Coomassie solution (see Recipe 13) for up to 4 h.Destain for several hours with destaining solution (see Recipe 14).Use pre-programmed option for Coomassie stained gels (white trans illumination) in Chemidoc.Save the images as ImageLab inbuilt data format “.scn.”"
