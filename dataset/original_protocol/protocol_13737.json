    "All procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of California, San Diego.\n1. Making the drug-peanut butter pellet\nCalculate the amount of drug needed to make the desired dose of drug in a pellet of peanut butter and scale to the size of the batch required for an experiment. Importantly, pellets can be kept at -80 °C, depending on drug stability.\nPulverize the drug tablets using a mortar and pestle.\nWeigh the calculated amount peanut butter required by placing it in a weigh boat on a tared scale.\nPlace the peanut butter over a beaker of warm water until melted.\nAdd the required amount of pulverized drug into the melted peanut and mix thoroughly.\nAllow the drug-peanut butter mixture to cool so that it can be easily placed into the rubber molds.\nPlace the peanut butter-drug mix into a mold. The one used here is a rubber corticosterone pellet mold and creates approximately ~100 mg peanut butter pellets. Adjustment of the ratio of drug to peanut butter may be necessary to ensure palatability.\nRepeat these steps with peanut butter alone to make placebo pellets.\nFreeze the mold at -20 °C or -80 °C (depending on drug stability) to allow the peanut butter to harden until use.\n2. Mouse setup\nSingly house mice in standard mouse cages. Line with highly absorbent paper bedding and enrichment, including paper towels and housing dome. This paper bedding facilitates accurate food intake measurements by allowing quantification of spilled food from feces and bedding.\n\tNOTE: ENsure IACUC approval for singly housing mice has been obtained.\nProvide ad libitum food and water and allow the mice to acclimate to the housing for approximately 3 days.\n3. Training to self-dosing of drug-peanut butter",
    "Plan and select the optimum time of the day for the drug administration.\nFast the mice for 24 hours and ensure that IACUC approval has been received for the chosen fasting duration.\nTake the mold out the freezer, let the rubber mold soften so that the pellets can be easily extruded out of the mold. All training can be completed using placebo control pellets.\nPlace a placebo control peanut butter pellet on the wall of the cage approximately 1.5 inches from the base. On the first day, it may take approximately 1 hour for the mouse to consume the peanut butter pellet due to novelty.\nAfter the training session provide ad libitum access to food and water.\nOn the following day, place the peanut butter pellet on the wall of the cage in the same location for further training on non-fasted mice.\nRepeat the training in fed mice for approximately 3 days. The time taken to consume the peanut butter will be less than 30 minutes by the third day of training.\n4. Experiment\nRandomize mice to treatment groups based on body weight so the groups have the same average body weight before treatment.\nPlan to administer the peanut butter pills (treatment or placebo) to the mice at the same time they were trained to receive the peanut butter pellets.\nWeigh the food and mouse and record the values.\nEnsure that the peanut butter pills (treatment or placebo) are placed at the same location in the cage as established during training.\nContinue the dosing procedure daily for the duration of the experiment.\nSubscription Required.
