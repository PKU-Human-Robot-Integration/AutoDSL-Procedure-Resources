    "Ethics statement: The animal protocol for this project obtained the approval from the Animal Care Committee of the Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal in compliance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n1. Catheter Preparation before Stereotaxic Surgery\nCut PE50 catheters (6 cm in length) that will be used to connect cannula with osmotic pumps (see Figure 1A). Fill PE50 catheters with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and seal both ends of the catheters. Keep the catheter at 4 °C until used.\n2. Cannula Implantation by Stereotaxy\nPerform the surgery in sterile conditions. Sterilize all the surgical instruments and materials by autoclaving. Clean the stereotaxic apparatus and the working area thoroughly, and disinfected with a 70% ethanol solution. Wear a surgical mask, hair bonnet and sterile gloves.\nAnesthetize rats by injecting intraperitoneally (i.p.) a solution of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Confirm anesthesia by checking movement after a gentle toe pinch.\nInject a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Meloxicam; 1 mg/kg) subcutaneously (s.c.) to the anesthetized-animal at least 30 min prior to surgery.\nShave the head of the animal using clippers and disinfect the skin with a solution of chlorhexidine gluconate 2% and isopropyl alcohol 2% three times. Apply veterinary ophthalmic ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nPlace the animal on a stereotaxic frame with the ear bars. Fix one cannula on the holder arm of the stereotaxic frame. Inject (s.c.) a local anesthetic agent (bupivacaine (1.5 mg/kg) and lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) on the top of the head. Anesthesia is maintains during the whole procedure by placing a nose cone delivering 3% isoflurane. The entire surgical field should be draped off, but it was not done here to better demonstrate the technique.",
    "Make an incision of 3 cm on the top of the head with a scalpel. Install 4 clamps around the incision to leave the skull clear. Using a round-tip scissor, make a pocket (2 x 2 cm2) under the skin between shoulder blades of the animal.\nScrape the periosteum of the skull with a blade. Apply a gauze pad on the skull if bleeding.\nVerify that the skull is flat and well aligned on the stereotaxic frame. To make sure that the skull is flat, check the height coordinates at the bregma and at the lambda. Take the coordinates of the bregma that will be used as the reference point.\nStarting from the bregma, calculate the coordinates of the two guide cannula that will be implanted bilaterally in the hippocampus (anteroposterior: - 0.42 cm; mediolateral: ± 0.30 cm; dorsoventral: - 0.28 cm according to the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas)29. Indicate the position of the cannula with a marker.\nDrill a hole (0.5 mm) in the skull at the implantation point of both cannula. Drill two other holes approximately 5 mm above and below those points to insert screws that will solidify cannula when applying dental cement.\nCut one end of the catheter previously filled with aCSF with a scalpel, and insert it in the angle arm of the cannula. Fix the first cannula with dental cement. Avoid putting dental cement around the position on the second cannula.\nLet the dental cement dry for 2 - 3 min, then remove the holder arm from the first cannula, and fix the second cannula in it. Repeat steps 2.11 and 2.12. Put dummy cannula on both guide cannula. Ensure that the dummy and guide cannula are of the same length to prevent tissue infiltration and blocking the cannula.",
    "Insert the free end of both catheters in the pocket previously made between shoulder blades of the animal. Remove the clamps and stitch the skin with a suture thread 4-0.\n\tNOTE: The top guide cannula needs to be accessible for upcoming Aβo infusions.\nRemove the animal from the stereotaxic frame and put it back in its cage. During post-surgical recovery, place the cage on a heating water blanket until the animal wakes up. The cage should be partially on the pad so the rat can move away from the heat if needed.  Monitor the animal constantly until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nReturn rats to the animal facility to recover from the surgery for 10 days under close monitoring.\n\tNOTE: Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Meloxicam (1 mg/kg) is given once per day during two days following surgery to treat pain.\n3. Osmotic Pump Installation\nOne day before installation, fill osmotic pumps with 6E10 antibody (1 mg/ml; 100 µl) and control IgG1 antibody (1 mg/ml; 100 µl) according to the manufacturer's instructions under sterile condition. Keep the pumps in sterile distilled water at 37 °C overnight to activate pumps.\nAnesthetize rats with isoflurane 3% to install osmotic pumps (0.5 µl/hr for 7 days). Shave between shoulder blades and disinfect the skin with a solution of chlorhexidine gluconate 2% and isopropyl alcohol 2%. Make an incision of 2 cm with a scalpel between shoulder blades to locate the PE50 catheters connected to the guide cannula.\nCut the end of the PE50 catheters containing dental cement with a scalpel. Connect the osmotic pumps to the PE50 catheters, and add some dental cement at the pump and catheter junction to secure the connection.",
    "Stitch the skin tightly with a suture thread 4-0. Put the animal back in its cage on a heating water pad. Observe the animal wake up rapidly from an isoflurane anesthesia (about 5 min).\n\tNOTE: The surgery takes approximately 5 to 10 min.\n4. Aβo Infusions in Awake and Freely Moving Rats\nPrepare the Aβo solution (0.2 µg/µl) as previously reported.28,30 Allow Aβo to aggregate dynamically and spontaneously for 1 hr at room temperature before infusion.\nInstall two 10 µl syringes on an infusion pump. Fill the syringes with 5 µl of sterile distilled water. Cut two PE50 catheters to about 60 cm in length with a scalpel. Fill both catheters with sterile distilled water using 1 ml syringes and 21G needles.\nKeep the 1 ml syringes at one end of the catheter and connect the other end to the Hamilton syringes. Remove the 1 ml syringes and check that there is no air bubbles within the catheters.\nInsert internal cannula at the end of PE50 catheters. Using sterile distilled water, fill the internal cannula connected to PE50 catheters up to1 µl on Hamilton syringes. Make an air bubble by pulling back the pistons up to 2 µl.\nMix the Aβo solution by pipetting up and down using a tip of minimum of adherence. Avoid forming bubbles during mixing. Fill both internal cannula with 1.5 µl of Aβo solution by pulling back the pistons up to 3.5 µl.\nMake lines with a marker before and after the air bubble done in both catheters. This serves as a check point of ongoing infusion. For infusion, bring the cage near the infusion pump and remove its cover.",
    "Place the rat in a snuggle and tightly scrape the arm of the snuggle around its neck to immobilize the head of the rat. Remove dummy cannula from the two guide cannula. Insert the internal cannula previously prepared in the guide cannula. Verify that they are fully inserted and well-fixed to the base of the guide cannula.\nRelease rat from the snuggle and put it back in its cage to limit contention stress. Monitor closely to ensure that the catheters do not twist together and the infusion is done properly.\nTurn on the infusion pump. Inject 1 µl of Aβo solution at a rate of 0.1 µl/min (10 min). During infusion, check that the syringe piston moves from 3.5 µl to 2.5 µl, and that the air bubble in both PE50 catheters move continuously.\nLeave the internal cannula in place for another 5 min after infusion to allow efficient diffusion of Aβo solution. Bring the rat back in the snuggle to remove internal cannula and capped guide cannula to prevent reflux of the injected solution. Use dummy cannula that stop just before the angle arm of the cannula. Return the animal in its cage.\nRepeat Aβo infusion once per day over 6 consecutive days. Euthanize the animal by decapitation."
