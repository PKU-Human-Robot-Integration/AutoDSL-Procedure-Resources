    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of stromal cells from murine lymph nodes\nTiming: 30–60 min for step 1\nTiming: 60 min for step 2\nTiming: 60 min for step 3\nStromal cells and especially the endothelial subsets are rare populations with regard to all lymph node cells (approximately 0.1%). Obtain and pool as many lymph nodes as possible from several mice of the same condition. However, consider if there might be reasons for obtaining only certain lymph node stations (e.g., tumor draining lymph nodes) as to avoid dilution of your expected effects by including lymph nodes not exposed to your tested “condition”, e.g., lymph nodes distant to tumor, or lymph nodes that only drain certain tissues not affected by your treatment. In order to generate high quality flow cytometry data, for optimal sorting yield and purity, leukocytes and erythrocytes are depleted before flow cytometry analysis or cell sorting. Lymph node stromal cell isolation has been established and validated previously (Fletcher et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nDissection and collection of lymph nodes.\nMice should be bred and maintained in a pathogen-free controlled environment (12 h light cycles, 22°C, 55% humidity) with food and water ad libitum.\nSacrifice mice using an authorized method.\nDissect axillary, brachial, cervical and inguinal lymph nodes.\nCollect all lymph nodes in 5 mL ice cold RPMI-1640.\nEnzymatic Digestion of the lymph nodes.\nAfter lymph nodes are settled at the bottom of the tube, remove RPMI-1640 with a pipette and add 5 mL of enzyme-solution.\nPlace tubes in 37°C water bath to start enzymatic digestion and incubate for 15 min.\nAspirate and pipette out the solution 10 times using a 5 mL serological pipette to apply gentle mechanical force to the lymph node. This results in disruption of the capsule and will release most of the lymphocytes.",
    "Allow large fragments to settle down, carefully harvest the supernatant and collect in 20 mL of ice-cold MACS buffer.\nAdd 5 mL fresh enzymatic digestion solution to the partially digested lymph node fragments and continue digestion in the 37°C water bath for 15 min.\nAspirate and pipette out the solution 10 times using a 5 mL serological pipette and obtain supernatant, pool in the MACS buffer collection tube and add new enzymatic digestion solution to the remaining node fragments every 15 min.\nOnce the lymph nodes are fully digested, centrifuge the pooled supernatants from all digestion steps at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cells in MACS buffer.\nEnrichment of stromal cells by depletion of CD45+ leukocytes.\nCount cells and label leukocytes with anti-CD45 magnetic beads as stated below and according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/DE-en/products/cd45-microbeads-mouse.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/DE-en/products/cd45-microbeads-mouse.html]).\nUse 10 μL of bead solution in 90 μL MACS buffer per 107 cells.\nMix and incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nAdd 20 mL of MACS buffer per tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in 500 μL MACS buffer.\nApply cell suspension onto MACS buffer-equilibrated MACS LS columns.\nCollect stromal cells in the flow through, leukocytes remain trapped on the column.\nOptional: Although the GentleMACS™ dissociator (Miltenyi) does not provide a dissociation program for lymph nodes, pilot experiments with lymph node dissociation by using the spleen dissociation kit (Miltenyi) and the m_spleen_02 program yielded similar numbers of viable BECs as our manual protocol and might be used for the dissociation, if such an automatic device is available.\nNote: Lymph nodes are usually fully digested (no large fragments visible) after 45 min (2–3 cycles of digestion buffer renewal). Make sure that all samples/conditions are treated equally.",
    "Critical: Do not exceed the binding capacity of the LS columns. Over 99% of the cells are CD45+ and remain bound to the resin. Consider the number of columns that can be handled simultaneously. In our hands, handling of up to 4 columns in parallel works without problems.\nCritical: In order to perform flow cytometry analysis of BEC subsets, a pool of 10 lymph nodes from a single mouse usually yields a sufficient amount of cells for a proper analysis (BEC count >10.000). However, it might be necessary to pool lymph nodes of several animals depending on the sex, age and condition of mice. Young mice and females tend to have smaller lymph nodes and yield a lower amount of isolated BECs. Disease models of infection or lymphoma can influence the amount of BECs (Mondor et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Gloger et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and cause changes of BEC subsets (Menzel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCritical: In order to perform single cell sequencing, a pool of 10 lymph nodes per mouse and from 10 mice per group/condition are required to obtain a sufficient number of cells. Such quantities are necessary to compensate for possible cell loss during the various centrifugation steps and cell sorting procedure, and for determination of the cell count and viability.\nAntibody staining of lymph node endothelial cells\nTiming: 30 min for step 4\nTiming: 60 min for step 5\nThe stromal cell-enriched suspension may still contain remaining erythrocytes and leukocytes, which are dump-gated based on TER119 and CD45 expression. Further surface markers distinguish fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and different subsets of blood endothelial cells (BECs), including tip cells, stalk cells, quiescent/phalanx cells and cells from high endothelial venules (HEVs) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1541-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Gates depict events in a hierarchical order, FSC-A/SSC-A (P1: cell size and granularity), FSC-A/FSC-H (P2: singlets), FSC-A/7-AAD (P3: live cells), FSC-A/CD45-Ter119 (P4: stromal cells) and CD31/PDPN (P5: BECs), PNAd/CD36 (P6: PNAd-/CD36+ quiescent cells, P7: PNAd+/CD36- HEV cells, P8: PNAd-/CD36-), JAG-1/CXCR4 (P9: JAG-1-/CXCR4+ tip cells, P10: JAG-1+/CXCR4- stalk cells).\nPrepare reference samples for spectral unmixing.\nRetain unstained stromal cells as autofluorescence reference controls.\nStaining of UltraComp eBeads with the exact antibodies applied in the assay are used as reference controls. If you employ models with fluorescent reporters or dyes that are not antibody dependent (e.g., 7-AAD, other viability dyes or cell tracers) you need to include cells that were stained with these fluorophores separately.\nIncubate UltraComp eBeads with antibodies for 10 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAntibody staining of lymph node cell populations.\nTransfer all cells in 200 μL FACS buffer to a 96 well plate (U-bottom).\nCentrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nOptional: Lysis of erythrocytes with lysis buffer (can cause loss of sensitive endothelial cells).\nPerform Fc-receptor block for prevention of unspecific binding of staining antibodies by incubation with 50 μL of an CD16/CD32 antibody solution (1:100 in FACS buffer) for 10 min at 4°C in the dark.\nPrepare an antibody staining master mix in FACS buffer as follows and add 50 μL of the mix to each sample:\nTER119-AlexaFluor 700 (Erythrocytes) 1:200 in FACS buffer.\nCD45-AlexaFluor 700 (Leukocytes) 1:200 in FACS buffer.\nCD31-BrilliantViolet 785 (Endothelial cells) 1:200 in FACS buffer.\nPDPN-PE/Cy7 (FRCs, LECs) 1:200 in FACS buffer.\nPNAd-AlexaFluor 647 (HEVs) 1:200 in FACS buffer.\nCD36-PerCP/Cy5.5 (quiescent BECs) 1:100 in FACS buffer.\nCXCR4-AlexaFluor 488 (tip BECs) 1:200 in FACS buffer.\nJAG1- APC (stalk BECs) 1:50 in FACS buffer.",
    "Mix cells and antibodies using a plate shaker at 1,500 rpm for 2 min.\nIncubate antibodies with cells for 20 min at 4°C, in the dark.\nWash cells twice with FACS buffer by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL FACS buffer and transfer cells into FACS tubes.\nFor dead-cell exclusion, add 7-AAD (1:100) solution immediately before analysis.\nPause point: If cells are meant to be analyzed by flow cytometry only, without further downstream analysis, you can consider fixation of your cells post surface antibody staining. For this purpose, perform surface staining as usual and incubate cells in 2% PFA in PBS for 10 min on ice. Wash twice with PBS and store at 4°C until analysis. Data should be recorded as soon as possible thereafter, but at the latest within 2–3 days post fixation. Since 7-AAD is a non-fixable dye, consider using fixable viability dyes (e.g., Zombie dyes from BioLegend) to exclude dead cells.\nCritical: Fixation of the cells might affect some of the used dyes. Extended PFA fixation might influence the integrity and signal intensity of fluorescent proteins like PE and APC and the Cy7 moiety in tandem dyes.\nCritical: Fixation might affect the spectrum of the autofluorescence of these cells. The unstained reference control should be treated exactly in the same way as the fixated and stained cells.\nNote: Consider that the CD45 expression might be low or absent in a fraction of plasma cells or in cells of hematopoietic cancer. Other or additional markers like CD90 or leukocyte subset-specific markers might be necessary.",
    "Note: Fluorescent tandem dyes like PE-Cy7 and PerCP-Cy5.5 are not stable over long periods of time, which can cause changes of the spectral fingerprint of these dyes. The antibody mastermix should therefore be generated immediately before use to avoid issues with the spectral unmixing or signal loss. Tandem dyes also require reference controls stained and recorded at the day of experiment and should not be used from the reference library.\nFlow cytometry detection and analysis of lymph node endothelial cells\nTiming: 60 min for step 6\nTiming: 60 min for step 7\nSince flow cytometry methods and devices are usually optimized for the analysis of leukocytes, endothelial cell analysis requires extended preparation procedures, cell-specific detection adjustments and thorough sample-by-sample, gate-by-gate analysis.\nRecord reference samples for spectral unmixing.\nUnstained stromal cells are used as unstained controls.\nMake sure all reference control spectra are accurate and of high quality, unmix the experiment and use live unmixing during the recordings. You can always re-unmix recorded samples later during the analysis in case you are not satisfied with your reference controls.\nCritical: Spectral unmixing crucially relies on the good quality and choice of your reference samples. Your unstained control represents the “baseline” for autofluorescence subtraction. Since different cell types can exhibit distinct spectral features, it is vital to use the cell type you will be analyzing later on (e.g., stromal cells) as your unstained control for optimal unmixing performance.",
    "Perform Quality Check runs with SpectroFlo QC beads on your device on a regular basis, as this ensures reliability and reproducibility of your experiments. Check your staining panel beforehand using the similarity matrix option in the SpectroFlo software. In this protocol they are providing you with a full flow cytometry panel that works well with spectral unmixing using the 5 laser Aurora device (Cytek). However, should you decide to use alternative fluorophores or include additional dyes, check the compatibility of your fluorophores using either the similarity index in SpectroFlo or use full spectrum viewer (https://spectrum.cytekbio.com[href=https://spectrum.cytekbio.com/]). Do not refer to conventional spectrum viewers since they are usually optimized for conventional filter-based flow cytometry displaying only the most pronounced emission peak with single laser excitation. The analysis method introduced in this protocol requires a full spectral signature of fluorophores during simultaneous multi-laser excitation.\nNote: As spectral flow cytometry gets increasingly recognized and appreciated, most antibody manufacturers offer many antibodies with an increasing number of coupled fluorophores. A suggestion of other fluorophores suited to be used for the acquisition with the 5 laser Aurora device (Cytek) is listed in the following table. Find further information in the fluorochrome selection guides of Cytek. Consider that polymer dyes such as Brilliant Violet can interact with each other and cause artifacts that can be avoided by using commercially available staining buffers such as Brilliant Stain buffer by BD.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1541_6.csv\nNote: The Cytek Aurora flow cytometer is susceptible to a clogged or partly blocked sample line if the device is not rinsed properly on a regular basis. Pay attention to stable flow rates during acquisition and consider activation clog and bubble detection.",
    "Note: Once the antibody staining and the reference controls are established, it is also appropriate to use the reference sample library. However, please note that not all fluorescent conjugates are stable over time. Especially tandem dyes (e.g., Pe-Cy7, APC-Cy7) differ between aliquots, tend to change their emission spectrum over time, and should be included to the reference controls on a regular basis.\nRecording of spectral flow cytometry data with a Cytek Aurora device.\nGating (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\nFSC-A/SSC-A:                P1 typical cell size and granularity →\nFSC-A/FSC-H:                P2 single cells →\nFSC-A/7-AAD:              P3 live cells →\nFSC-A/Ter119, CD45:        P4 stromal cells →\nCD31/PDPN:                P5 BECs →\nPNAd/CD36:                P6 HEV cells/quiescent cells →\nJAG-1/CXCR4                P7 stalk cells/tip cells.\nRecording of at least 10.000 BECs per sample is recommended. If the amount of cells allows to increase the amount of recorded cells, we recommend to record as much cells as possible, since a higher number of cells improves the further gating and analysis of the hierarchical BEC subsets over several levels (see note below).\nNote: When the expression level of surface molecules in terms of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) per cell is a desired readout, consider adjusting the recording of BECs to a specific amount of BECs in all samples. Larger variances of the cell count between samples/groups can influence the MFI and might distort comparisons of expression levels.\nNote: Consider adding isotype controls for targets known to not have a clear positive population but rather an intensity shift (e.g., JAG-1, CXCR4).",
    "Optional: In order to avoid computer performance issues when applying FlowJo analysis on an extended data size per sample, consider using the stromal gate as storage gate to exclude events from cell debris and the TER119/CD45 dump-gate. Depending on the depletion of leukocytes, storing stromal cells only can result in a remarkable reduction of file sizes, facilitates fluent data analysis, and avoids computer crash.\nFlow cytometry sorting of BECs for scRNA-seq processing\nTiming: 30 min for step 8\nTiming: 30 min for step 9\nTiming: ∼30 min per sample for step 10\nTiming: 8 h for step 11\nTiming: variable for step 12\nConsider that the quantity of BECs isolated from murine lymph nodes is very low (10%–20% of all CD45- stromal cells), and cell sorting and processing for scRNA-seq is often prone to a loss of cells. In our experience, if a total number of approximately 1 × 104 cells to be analyzed is desired, pooled LNs of at least five mice per group are necessary. Use fluorescence coupled antibodies according to the configuration of the cell-sorting device available (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1541-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

When sorting endothelial cells, we recommend configuring your sorter to a larger inner nozzle diameter (e.g., 100 μm). The standard 70 μm nozzle can cause shear stress on endothelial cells and decreases cell viability.\nCritical: Once disintegrated from the vessel structure, endothelial cells are very sensitive and prone for apoptosis and cell death. Additionally, mRNAs are relatively unstable and rapidly degraded molecules. Following the cell sorting procedure, avoid delays of the procedure and process cells as quickly as possible to preserve cell viability and mRNA integrity. Prolonged cell storage or cryopreservation is not recommended.\nCritical: Consider that 10× reagent kits and protocols are not cross-compatible between versions. Take care that you use the suitable protocol for the type and version of your 10× chemistry.",
    "Note: Given antibody dilutions are suggestions and might be changed or titrated to avoid adverse signal spread and compensation requirements.\nNote: Non-viable cells (7-AAD+) are removed during the cell sorting process. However, endothelial cells are sensitive and the viability can decline between cell sorting and the preparation of the single cell libraries. We recommend to determine the cell viability immediately before single cell capture and proceed only with samples with a cell viability above 80%.\nNote: In contrast to many other applications of flow cytometry sorted cells, we highly recommend to not set the gates of BECs determined for scRNA-seq in a very strict fashion. An enrichment of BECs with more generous/relaxed gates ensures that all BEC subsets and BECs with different differentiation grades are covered by the data set. All events contributed by non-BECs can be excluded during the computational pre-processing and analysis of the scRNA-seq data.\nNote: It is usually recommended to sort into FCS-containing medium or directly into FCS in order to preserve cell viability. However, the performance of the downstream 10× genomics single cell protocols might be hampered by ingredients of the serum. In our experience, using HBSS with 0.04% BSA resulted in good cell viability, low cell aggregates and a sufficient cell recovery rate.\nAnalysis of scRNA-seq data from murine lymph node BECs\nTiming: undefined\nThe Seurat package for R provides all basic tools and functions for quality control, analysis and illustration of scRNA-seq data (Satija et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Butler et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Stuart et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Hao et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",

    "Note: It is recommended to perform a quality control analysis and exclude low quality cells from further analysis. Quality control metrics commonly include the number of unique genes detected in each cell (excludes empty droplets and multiplets) and the percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome (low quality cells with low viability). The appropriate threshold should be determined individually according to the respective samples or runs. We included cells with 100–5,000 unique genes (nFeature_RNA) and a percentage of mitochondrial genes below 5%.\nNote: Check the expression of typical non-BEC and BEC marker after removal of non-BECs from the scRNA-seq data set. The filtered subset should not include cells expressing non-BEC marker but just cells expressing the pan-endothelial markers Cdh5 and Pecam1.
