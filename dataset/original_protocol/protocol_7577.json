    "Recombinant protein expression Clone the coding sequences of GFP and GFP fused with HRLP into the pGEX-6p-2 vector to generate GST-GFP and GST-GFP-HRLP constructs, respectively.Transform the constructs of GST-GFP and GST-GFP-HRLP into DE3 competent cells.Spread the transformed competent cells onto LB plates containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and incubate overnight at 37 °C to form colonies.Inoculate one single colony into 2 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with ampicillin at the final concentration of 100 mg/L and incubate at 37 °C overnight with vigorous shaking at 220 rpm.Transfer the overnight cell culture to 200 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with 100 mg/L ampicillin and grow at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm until the OD600 value reaches 0.6–1.0.Add IPTG at the final concentration of 0.2 mM to the cultured cells to induce proteins of interest at 16 °C overnight (Note 1).Test the solubility of GST-GFP and GST-GFP-HRLP fusion proteins by running a protein gel followed by Coomassie blue staining through the following steps:Transfer 2 mL of induced and non-induced cell cultures to Eppendorf tubes, followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 1 min to pellet the cells. Meanwhile, keep the rest of the cell cultures at 4 °C.Add 1 mL of lysis buffer (Note 2) to resuspend the cells and further break cells by sonication (output watt at 6, 30 s on/30 s off) until the solution becomes clear.Centrifuge the lysed cells at maximum speed at 4 °C for 10 min and transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube as the soluble proteins.Add 6× SDS loading dye to the supernatant and denature the proteins at 100 °C for 10 min.Run an SDS-PAGE gel. After running is completed, stain the gel with Coomassie blue staining buffer for at least 1 h at room temperature.",
    "Destain the gel by soaking the gel in destaining solution. Induced recombinant protein bands should appear after IPTG induction (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4813/bioprotoc-13-17-4813-g001.jpgFigure 1. Protein staining with Coomassie blue. (A) GST-GFP and GST-GFP-HRLP expression after IPTG induction. Red asterisks indicate the protein bands of GST-GFP and GST-GFP-HRLP. (B) GFP and GFP-HRLP proteins after cleavage. The red asterisks indicate the protein bands of GFP and GFP-HRLP.Recombinant protein purification After confirming the solubility of proteins, harvest the induced cells containing GST-GFP and GST-GFP-HRLP by centrifugation at 2,400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by sonication (output watt at 6, 30 s on/ 30 s off) until the cell suspension becomes clear.Centrifuge the suspension at 10,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant containing induced proteins into new 15 mL Falcon tubes.Equilibrate the Glutathione Sepharose beads by washing the beads with 1 mL of lysis buffer.Transfer 150 μL of equilibrated beads to each supernatant, followed by an incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation.Centrifuge at 200× g for 1 min at 4 °C to pellet the beads.Discard the supernatants and wash beads with 5 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer for 5 min.Repeat the washing step twice.To test the protein quality and size, boil 2 μL of washed beads in 10 μL of lysis buffer supplemented with 6× SDS loading dye at 100 °C for 10 min and run in an SDS-PAGE gel.After running is completed, stain the gel with Coomassie blue buffer for 1 h at room temperature.Destain the gel with destaining solution; the target protein bands should appear after IPTG induction. For the rest of the beads, keep at 4 °C until the cleavage step.",
    "Cleavage of recombinant protein Add 5 μL of PreScission Protease and 200 μL of cleavage buffer to the washed beads.Incubate the beads on a nutating mixer at 4 °C for 4 h (Note 3).Centrifuge the beads at 600× g for 1 min at 4 °C.Transfer the green supernatants to new 1.5 mL tubes to store GFP and GFP-HRLP proteins (Figure 2). The proteins can be stored in cleavage buffer in small aliquots at -80 °C for several months (Note 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4813/bioprotoc-13-17-4813-g002.jpgFigure 2. GFP (left) and GFP-HRLP (right) proteins after cleavage Measure the protein concentration with Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate (BSA protein could be used to generate the standard curve).Run 2 μL of GFP and GFP-HRLP proteins on a protein gel followed by Coomassie blue staining to check the protein quality and size (Figure 1B) (Note 5).In vitro phase separation Dilute the generated GFP and GFP-HRLP proteins at the final concentration of 10 μM (Note 6) with the cleavage buffer on ice.Add 2 μL of PEG-8000 (Note 7) at the final concentration of 10% to the 18 μL of diluted proteins in a PCR tube on ice. Mix the samples by pipetting up and down.Transfer the 20 μL mixture to a Hole microscope slide immediately to avoid protein degradation or fluorescence decay.Carefully cover the slide with a cover glass.Observe the fluorescence with 40× microscope objective under an FV3000 Olympus confocal microscope. GFP protein exhibits uniform signals under the microscope, whereas GFP-HRLP forms droplets (Figure 3) (Notes 8–10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4813/bioprotoc-13-17-4813-g003.jpgFigure 3.
