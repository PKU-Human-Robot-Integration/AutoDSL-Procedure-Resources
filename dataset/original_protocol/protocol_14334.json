    "1) Preparation of CaspaseTracker Biosensor Flies\nAnesthetize flies with CO2, and use a paintbrush to transfer 7 to 10 caspase-sensitive Gal4 (DQVD)19 virgin females and 7 to 10 G-Trace53 Gal4 reporter young male flies (or vice versa) in the same vial with fly food and fresh yeast paste.\nNOTE: Cross of Caspase-sensitive (DQVD) Gal4 and G-Trace flies will produce CaspaseTracker progeny flies. Cross of Caspase-insensitive (DQVA)19 Gal4 and G-Trace flies will provide negative control flies (see discussion). Fresh yeast paste serves as protein source to enhance egg production, so that increases number of progeny. Select virgin females and young male flies according to their phenotypes54.\nIncubate the flies at 18 degrees Celsius (oC) during the cross for 3 to 7 days, and then transfer the flies to a new vial to set up a new cross at 18 °C. Continue to incubate the original vial at 18 °C until progeny flies eclose.\nNOTE: Transfer the parent flies to new vials to avoid overcrowding of progeny at the original vial. Parent flies can produce progeny with fresh food and yeast paste at the first 2 to 3 switches, and then the productivity will significantly decrease with time. Raising flies 18 °C can reduce non-specific signal of CaspaseTracker biosensor (see discussion).\nSelect progeny flies with correct phenotypes54 for following experiments.\nNOTE: The transgenes of both caspase-sensitive Gal4 and G-Trace here are located at the second chromosome, balanced with CyO balancer. Select the non-curly wing progeny (without CyO), which has both transgenes of caspase-sensitive Gal4 and G-Trace.\n2) Application of Transient Cell Death Induction to CaspaseTracker Biosensor Flies\nTransfer 10 to 20 newly eclosed female flies to a new vial with fresh fly food and fresh yeast paste for 1 day at 18 °C to allow egg chamber production by oogenesis.",
    "NOTE: Keeping the female with male flies might enhance egg chamber production.\nTo induce egg chambers to undergo apoptosis by cold shock, transfer the female flies to new empty vial, which is then placed at -7 °C for 1 h.\nNOTE: Cold shock injures cells by inducing plasma membrane rupture55,56.\nTo induce egg chambers to undergo apoptosis by protein starvation, transfer the female flies to a new vial with 8% sucrose and 1% agar food at 18 °C for 3 days.\nNOTE: Protein starvation (non-protein food) can trigger egg chambers to undergo apoptosis57,58,59 and autophagy60,61. Switch flies to a new vial with 8% sucrose and 1% agar food every day to keep optimal condition of the sucrose fly food.\nTransfer the stressed flies back to a new vial with fresh fly food and fresh yeast paste for 3 days at 18 °C to allow them to recover. Dissect the starved and the starved-recovered flies to obtain egg chambers at ovaries as described62.\nNOTE: To dissect Drosophila to obtain ovaries, anesthetize flies with CO2, and use 2 pairs of forceps to remove fly head, and use the forceps to pull the base of the abdomen to remove the ovaries of the flies.\n3) Fixation and Staining of Dissected Egg Chambers for Imaging\nTransfer the dissected egg chambers together with around 0.5 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to 1 mL centrifuge tubes. Allow the eggs to settle down.\nNOTE: Coat the plastic pipette tips with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in water or PBS to prevent the egg chambers to stick on the plastic surface of the tips. Perform the following procedures in dark to avoid photobleaching of red fluorescent protein (RFP, also known as DsRed) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the egg chambers.",
    "Remove the PBS by pipetting, and then apply 0.5 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS to fix the egg chambers at room temperature in dark for 20 to 30 min.\nNOTE: Apply gentle rotation in this and the following incubation steps.\nRemove the paraformaldehyde by pipetting, and then washed the egg chamber with 0.5 mL PBST (PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100) for 3 times.\nNOTE: Prolonged fixation could reduce the RFP and GFP signals.\nIncubate the egg chambers with PBST for 1 to 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation to permeabilize the egg chambers.\nNOTE: PBST can also avoid egg chambers to stick to the non-BSA coated plastic surface.\nRemove the PBST by pipetting, and then apply 0.5 mL of 10 μg/mL of blue nuclear Hoechst dye in PBST to egg chambers for 1 to 2 h at room temperature to stain for nucleus.\nNOTE1: Avoid prolonged incubation with nuclear dye as this will increase non-specific signal.\nNOTE2: Alternative approach to stain nucleus without Hoechst is to add 200 μL anti-bleaching mounting agent with DAPI (see materials) and incubate overnight63, before mounting the tissues on glass cover slip as described at protocol 3.8.\nNOTE3: Perform the staining and the following procedures in dark to avoid photobleaching.\nRemove the nuclear dye by pipetting, and then apply 0.5 mL PBST to wash the egg chambers in the 1 mL centrifuge tubes for 3 times, with 10 to 20 min incubation with gentle rotation between each washing step.\nRemove all PBST with fine pipette, and then apply 200 μL anti-bleaching mounting agent (see materials) to incubate the egg chambers at room temperature for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C until the egg chambers sink to the bottom of the tube.",
    "NOTE: Tissues that have fully absorbed the mounting agent sink to the bottom of the tube.\nMount the stained egg chambers by transferring them with 200 μL anti-bleaching mounting agent on a pre-cleaned glass slide for imaging by pipetting, cover the egg chambers with a 20 x 20 mm pre-cleaned glass cover slip, and seal the cover slip on glass slide by putting nail polish at the edge of the cover slip.\nNOTE1: Pre-clean the glass slide and cover slip with water or 70% ethanol.\nNOTE2: Apply petroleum jelly between the glass slide and the cover slip to avoid destroying the egg chambers by overcompression.\nImage the egg chambers using fluorescence or confocal microscope, using a 20x, NA 0.8 Plan-Apochromat objective, with excitation light wavelength 405 nm for nuclear staining (detect emission ~461 nm), 561 nm for RFP (ongoing or recent caspase activity) signal (detect emission ~590 nm), and 488 nm for GFP (past caspase activity) signal (detect emission ~518nm).\nNote: See our published protocols for microscopy20,64.\nSubscription Required.
