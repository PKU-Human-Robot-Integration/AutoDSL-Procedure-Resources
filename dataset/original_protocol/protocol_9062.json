    "1. Volatile Follection\nIn  this example, we use volatile samples from M.  lewisii flowers - an alpine wildflower native to California. Volatiles are collected using dynamic sorption  methods according to Riffell et al.14.  Briefly, this method employs a closed  loop trapping system where flowers are enclosed in a Teflon bag. Using an inert vacuum pump, the air around the  flowers is sucked through a \"trap\" comprised of a Pasteur pipette filled with Porapak  Q matrix. The return air from the pump  is filtered by activated charcoal. After  a prescribed time period, in our case 24 h, the Porapak Q matrix is eluted with  a non-polar solvent, typically hexane, to collect the concentrated extract. The extract is then stored in -80 °C until  analysis. If necessary, samples can be concentrated  prior to analysis under a stream of nitrogen gas. Unless the sample is already  well-characterized, run an aliquot of it through a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer  (GC-MS) to identify volatile components prior to using the sample.\n2. Electrophysiological Preparation\nCut  approximately 1 cm from the end of a 1,000 μl pipette tip. Place a bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) into the base of the pipette tip and gently push  towards the opposite end of the tip until only the head is exposed.\nMelt  dental wax and mold it around the exposed head, making sure that the wax  adheres onto the compound eyes for security and to make the bee's head  completely immobile. Be sure not to get  any wax onto the antenna of the bee.",
    "Once  the head is secure, make a square, window-like, incision into the head capsule using  a razor blade-breaker or the appropriate sized scalpel to cut the cuticle. Using the blade-breaker, start from the dorsal  side of the head capsule, immediately behind the antenna and adjacent to one of  the compound eyes. Cut a straight line,  from one compound eye to the contralateral compound eye. After cutting a straight line to the opposite  compound eye, begin making an incision dorsally until the head capsule curves  and ends near its thorax. At this point,  begin to cut towards the opposite end of the head capsule. Finally, once a line has been cut to the  opposite end, cut a line back up to the starting position of the initial  incision. It is important to remove the  cuticle that is adjacent to the antenna, as this will impede the insertion of  the electrode.\nOnce  the cuticle is cut, use a pair of forceps to remove the bee cuticle, which  should then expose the bee's brain and, more importantly, the antennal lobes. Immediately begin superfusing the brain with  insect saline, so that the brain does not become dessicated. After the brain is exposed, carefully use a  pair of very fine forceps to remove the perineural sheath immediately above the  antennal lobes. Be very careful not to  puncture the bee's brain with the forceps.\n3. Gas Chromatography with Multi-channel Recording\nThe  bee \"preparation\" - fixed in a tube with its brain exposed - is now ready for  electrophysiological recording. Place the bee in a clamp, fixed to a magnetic  base that is located on an air table.\nArrange  an IV bag, flow controller, and tubing (filled with insect saline) so that the  saline continuously superfuses the brain.",
    "Using  a micromanipulator, insertareference electrode, made of tungsten  wire, into the bee's eye.\nUsing  a separate micromanipulator, insert the multi-channel electrode, such as a  coiled wire tetrode, or silicon multi-channel electrode (Neuronexus  Technologies), into the antennal  lobes of the bee. This electrode is  connected to a pre-amplifier such as the TDT system's S-3 Z series to the Z-bus  bioamp processor of the TDT system.  Output from the Gas Chromatogram's detector via a shielded BNC cable can  be interfaced with the amplifier and data acquisition system such that both the  neural and GC signal is synchronized.\nWait  approximately 30-60 minutes for the neural recordings to stabilize. Once the spontaneous activity and waveform shape  of units in the recording channels have become consistent, use an odor syringe  to stimulate the bee and observe the response of the recording channels to the  odor.\nRecord  extracellular spikes from neurons by auto-thresholding the recording channels  by 3.5 to 5 sigma of the signal on the individual recording channels. Manual thresholding may be required for some  channels to avoid contamination from electrical noise. The action potentials from neurons will appear  as voltage spikes in the recording channel. When the channel's voltage exceeds the  threshold, the system buffers and saves the few milliseconds before and after  the crossing of the threshold, thereby taking a snap-shot of the waveform, or  spike.",
    "Immediately  next to the air table is the GC. Before  injecting the floral extract into the GC, make sure that the method for the  temperature ramp of the GC run is correct. In our example, we use a temperature method  starting at 50  °C for 4 min followed by an increase of temperature at a rate  of 10 °C/min. to 220 °C, at which time we hold the GC for an additional 6  min. We use a DB-5 GC column (J&W  Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA), with helium as the carrier gas. The inlet is splitless, with a temperature set  to 200 °C. The flame ionization detector  temperature is set to 230  °C.\nInject  the extract sample of the floral headspace into the heated injection port of  the GC to release the adsorbed volatiles into the GC column. The effluent from the column is split 1:1 between  the Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and the bee antenna using a glass \"Y\"  connector (J&W Scientific). Begin  recording from the electrode as you inject a sample into the GC.\nAfter  the GC run has finished, let the preparation rest for 5 to 15 min. Then either inject another sample into the GC  or stimulate the preparation using single volatile compounds or mixtures of  compounds. In this latter method of  stimulating the preparation, pulses of air from a constant air stream are  diverted through a glass syringe containing a piece of filter paper on which  the compounds have been deposited. The  odor stimulus was pulsed by means of a solenoid-activated valve controlled by  the software.",
    "If unit activity suddenly stops or changes, check the saline drip and let the  preparation rest for 15 min. If the  spontaneous activity does not regain its previous level then the preparation  should be discarded and another bee used if available.\nAfter  the experiment, fix the brain with 5% formalin for 20 min with the probe  still in the tissue. Next, excise the  brain and place it in 2% glutaraldehyde for 4 hr, and subsequently do a graded  ethanol dehydration series and clear the brain with methyl salicylate. Based on the fixing and clearing of the  tissue, the locations in the AL where the electrodes punctured the tissue  should be clearly discernible by confocal microscopy.\n4. Data Analysis\nAnalyze  collected data after the experiment to separate and identify the recorded  neural units. Use typical software  programs (Offline Sorter, MClust, and SClust) to separate waveforms, or  \"spikes\", based on spike shapes, such as peak or valley amplitude, peak  half-width, etc., or reduced measures (principal components)17,18 (Figure 2). Use only those clusters  of spikes that separated in three-dimensional space (PC1-PC3) and are statistically  different from one another (multivariate ANOVA; p < 0.05) (Figure 2) for further analysis. Please refer to citation #s 17-19 for full  description of tetrode recording and spike-sorting methodologies.\nTime-stamp  spikes in each cluster, and export these data for analysis using MATLAB or  Neuroexplorer (Nex Technologies, Winston-Salem, NC) to create raster plots and  firing rate responses (Figures 2, 3A).\nIdentify  the retention times of volatiles using the simultaneously recorded GC data. Use the retention times of the volatiles,  determined by the apex of the peak from the chromatogram, to examine unit  responses at those time points.",
    "To  examine individual unit responses through the GC run, bin the number of spikes  in 100 msec intervals and examine the time-course of firing rate responses with  reference to the retention time of eluting volatiles. The binning of spikes in 100 msec intervals  provides enough detail, or signal, about the time-course of the neuronal  response to an eluting odorant from the GC.\nTo  examine the population responses to the different eluting volatiles, integrate  the firing rate responses of individual units over a 3 sec sampling window, 1.5  sec before, and 1.5 sec after, the retention time of the volatile (Figure 3). This time period is typical of the duration  of an eluting volatile from the GC. We  show firing rate responses of the units by color-coding them (red is a high  firing rate response; blue is a low response) and arranging them as an activity  matrix with each row representing the ensemble response to the GC effluent  (columns) (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
