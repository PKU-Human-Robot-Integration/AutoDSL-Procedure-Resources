The inclusion of a core bead made of iron oxide improves visibility and facilitates manipulation because the position of the beads can be controlled using a magnet. However, if users are familiar with the REpi-seq experiments, use of the core magnetic polyacrylamide beads can be skipped.\nTransfer the nanobead suspension into 2 tubes (1.5 mL), centrifuge at 21,300 × g for 1 h (use an angled rotor) at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant.\nSuspend the bottom slurry with 1 mL of 40% Acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide (19:1, see the Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Bis-acrylamide is a neurotoxin.
