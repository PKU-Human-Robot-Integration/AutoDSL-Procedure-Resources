This is important for use of\n      the fluorescent protein–negative population as an appropriate internal\n      control (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/663-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1. Gating strategies for isolation of CD133high\n          neural progenitors from the embryonic neocortex after in utero\n          electroporation with a plasmid encoding GFP\n        \n          Plasmids encoding GFP and either control (shLuc) or\n          Hmga2 (shHmga2) shRNAs were introduced into neural progenitors\n          of mouse embryos at E11 by in utero electroporation as described\n          previously (Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Neocortical\n          cells were dissociated at E13, stained with APC-conjugated antibodies\n          to CD133, and subjected to FACS.\n        \n          (A) Debris and doublets were removed as described in steps 24a and\n          24b.\n        \n          (B and C) GFP and CD133 profiles of negative control (B) and\n          electroporated and stained (C) samples. For electroporated samples,\n          the CD133high population (top 20% of CD133-expressing\n          cells) was defined with the use of the GFPneg fraction, and\n          the gating was then applied to the GFPpos fraction, as\n          described in steps 24c to 24e. This approach allows appropriate",

Higher cell densities increase the speed of cell collection\n      but result in a greater loss of marker-positive cells.\n    \nCell sorting\nTiming: 20–60 min\n    \n        Run control samples, including non-stained and single-stained samples,\n        in order to check for potential spectral overlap.

Given that the\n        sheath solution—in this case, FACS Flow (BD)—may contain a detergent,\n        its dilution by mixing with the cushion solution helps to preserve cell\n        viability.\n      \nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\n        For reverse transcription (RT) and qPCR and RNA-seq analyses, freeze the",
    "cell pellet with liquid N2 and store at −80°C. 10,000 cells\n        are enough for RT-qPCR and usual RNA-seq analyses, and 1,000 cells are\n        used for Quartz-seq analysis (Eto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3];\n        Kuwayama et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7];\n        Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\n        \nPause Point: Store the cell\n          pellets at −80°C for more than 1 year.\n        \nNote: For other types of biochemical\n          analysis, proceed to the appropriate treatment as follows.\n        \n            For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, crosslink the cell\n            pellet using 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room\n            temperature. After centrifugation, washing the cell pellets with\n            PBS, store at −80°C. We used 100,000 cells for H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (Kuwayama et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\n          \n            For assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq, proceed\n            to the ATAC reaction without freezing cells (Yamanaka et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). For freezing before ATAC reaction, cryopreservation can provide\n            data with better quality (Milani et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\n            We used 20,000 cells for ATAC-seq (Yamanaka et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\n          \n            For cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag),\n            cryopreserve the cell pellet using cell stock solution, such as\n            CELLBANKER (Takara). We can also directly sort the cells into the\n            1.5 mL tube, including cell stock solution in step 26.
