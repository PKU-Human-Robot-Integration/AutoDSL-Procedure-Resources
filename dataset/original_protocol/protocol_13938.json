    "All animal activities described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The Ohio State University and were conducted in AAALAC-accredited facilities.\n1. Procedure Preparation\nConstruct the intubation platform. To achieve the appropriate platform slope, use a three-inch (7.6 cm) 3-ring binder. Fold a 15−20 cm length of 3-0 silk or other thread material in half and adhere the ends of the thread to the top of the inclined platform with tape to create a suspension loop (Figure 1).\nSelect a cannula of the appropriate size and length.\nNOTE: For a 20−30 g mouse, a 1−1.5 inch (2.5−3.8 cm) long catheter up to 18 G can be used. For this study, 18 week-old female BALB/c and 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice (n = 3 of each strain) were used. An opaque white catheter sheath provides the best transcutaneous visualization.\nCut a bevel at the distal tip of the catheter and smooth the cut surface with abrasive paper to create a rounded bevel tip. Gently create a slight bend in the cannula approximately 1 cm from the bevel (Figure 2).\nNOTE: A new catheter should be used for each mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine (5.4 mg/g body weight) and xylazine (16 µg/g body weight) administered intraperitoneally.  Apply sterile ophthalimic ointment to the eyes.\nNOTE: Proper anesthetic depth is achieved by lack of response of the mouse to a firm toe pinch.",
    "Suspend the mouse in a supine position on the intubation platform by hooking the upper incisors around the silk thread at the top of the angled surface (Figure 3). Once the mouse is squarely positioned in dorsal recumbency, gently grasp the base of the tail and retract the tail towards the table. Place a piece of tape over the base of tail to secure the mouse.\nApply depilatory cream (Table of Materials) to the ventral cervical region for 30−45 s then remove all depilatory cream from the cervical region using a dry gauze. Repeat application process if needed. Thoroughly rinse the skin with saline or distilled water to remove any residue then wipe dry.\n2. Intubation Procedure\nUse straight, flat forceps in the nondominant hand to gently retract the tongue in a manner that sufficiently opens the mouth for introduction of the cannula.\nNOTE: Rat tooth forceps should not be used as this will damage the tongue.\nWith the dominant hand, advance the cannula into the mouth such that the end that is distal to the slight bend is against the roof of the subject’s mouth.\nRelease the tongue and slide the flat edge of the closed forceps caudally along the ventral neck until the manubrium is reached. This motion laterally displaces the salivary glands and flattens the muscle covering the trachea. The trachea appears transcutaneously as a white line (Figure 3A). If necessary, rotate the forceps in a craniodorsal direction while maintaining tension on the skin in a caudal direction to cause the laterally displaced salivary glands to peak. This maneuver creates more contrast around the trachea (Figure 3B).\nNOTE: Avoid excessive force on the ventral neck as it can collapse the trachea and impair breathing.",
    "Advance the cannula while simultaneously angling the distal tip of the cannula ventrally by supination of the dominant hand with simultaneous flexion of the wrist.\nThe proper placement of the cannula is indicated by visualization of the opaque cannula in the trachea (Figure 4B,D). If the cannula has been advanced past the level of the origin of the masseter muscle and visualization of the cannula in the trachea has not been confirmed, retract the cannula and reattempt the maneuver.\nConfirm proper cannula placement by connecting a lung inflation bulb to the cannula and observing thoracic expansion with concurrent depression of the device.\nWithout displacing the cannula, carefully unhook the incisors of the mouse from the intubation platform. Move the mouse to a horizontal platform (Table of Materials) and insert the cannula to the adaptor on the ventilator. Following the deep inflation, ventilate the mouse for 60 s then measure respiratory resistance.\n3. Recovery\nOnce the procedure is complete, move the mouse to a warmed platform. Provide constant stimulation via light toe or tail pinches to encourage spontaneous respiration.\nExtubation can occur when the mouse just begins to chew. Grasp the cannula at the level of the hub and gently pull the tube cranially and away from the mouse until the cannula is completely removed from the subject’s mouth.\nNOTE: It is preferable to provide airway support with the rigid cannula for as long as possible during the recovery process.\nOnce extubated, transfer the mouse to a clean recovery cage with heat support. Continuously monitor the mouse until it is fully ambulatory, and recovery is complete.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
