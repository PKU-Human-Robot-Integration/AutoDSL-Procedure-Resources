    "1. In Vitro Transcription\nLinearize pCS2-H2A.F/Z-EGFP and/or pCS2-mCherry-CAAX vectors by NotI restriction enzyme digest31. Using an RNA in vitro transcription kit, generate 5' capped mRNA products from each template, according to manufacturer's protocol.\nPurify the capped mRNA using a purification kit. Follow manufacturer's instructions. Elute with RNase-free H2O.\nDetermine the concentration of RNA by absorbance at 260 nm using a spectrophotometer. (OD260 x dilution x 40 µg/ml).\nDilute the RNA to 100 ng/µl for each H2A.F/Z-EGFP and mCherry-CAAX with RNase-free H2O. If the RNA concentration is too low, the fluorescence will be diminished or absent. Brighter samples will diminish the concerns over phototoxicity and photobleaching. On the other hand, too much RNA can be toxic and/or cause off target effects.\n\tNote: Store the remaining purified mRNA in -80 °C freezer.\n2. Zebrafish Breeding, Embryo Collection, and mRNA Injection 36-38\nAssemble breeding tanks with a barrier to separate the tank into two regions and fill each breeding tank with aquaculture system water used in the zebrafish facility.\nIn order to prevent untimely breeding, place two male fish on one side of the barrier and two female fish on the other side the night before breeding.\nThe next day, thaw the previously prepared mRNA mixture on ice. Replace the water in breeding tanks with fresh aquaculture system water and remove the barriers. Immediately after the barriers are pulled, warm an injection mold to 28.5 °C and set up the equipment for microinjection.\n\tNote: For information on injection molds, please refer to Gerlach36.",
    "Collect eggs every 10 - 15 min using a tea strainer and rinse the eggs into a clean 100 x 15 mm Petri dish with E3 Blue (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, 10-5% Methylene blue). E3 Blue is used to prevent fungal growth and ensure proper development of larval fish. For more information on mating and embryo collection, refer to Gerlach36 and Porazinkski37.\nEmbed one-cell staged embryos in a warmed injection mold and inject the RNA into the yolk in the desired amount of embryos (Figure 1A). Account for natural embryonic death and unfertilized embryos by performing embryonic injections on 15% more embryos than needed for the experiment. For additional details on microinjection of zebrafish embryos, please refer to Gerlach36 and Porazinkski37.\n\tNOTE: For first time use of mRNA, perform a dose-curve analysis to determine the optimal dose for fluorescence and viability (defined as no gross developmental defects up to 5 dpf) prior to performing 5D imaging. 150 - 200 ng/µl injected into embryos is often the optimal concentration, therefore it is a good starting point for the final concentration.\nCarefully extract the injected embryos from the mold using a modified 9\" glass Pasteur pipette. To modify the pipette, melt the end using a Bunsen burner until it forms a ball.\nPlace injected embryos in a 100 x 15 mm Petri dish in E3 Blue and house in a 28.5 °C incubator.\nSix hr post-injection, remove any dead or unfertilized embryos from the plates and add clean E3 Blue. House the embryos at 28.5 °C.\n3. Preparation and Embedding of Live Zebrafish Embryos for Imaging (Figure 1B)",
    "Two hr before imaging, screen the injected embryos for GFP using a fluorescent dissecting microscope. Place bright green GFP-expressing embryos in a new 100 x 15 mm Petri dish with E3 Blue.\nBoil a stock solution of 1% low melt agarose by adding 1 g of low melt agarose to 100 ml of E3 Blue. After using the agarose, cover the flask with aluminum foil. The stock solution remains useful for up to one month.\nAliquot 3 ml of the melted agar into a 17 x 100 mm culture tube. Keep the agarose warm by placing the culture tube in a 42 °C water bath until ready for use. Prepare a 15 mM Tricaine solution in deionized water to anesthetize the zebrafish embryos36.\n\tNOTE: If imaging at earlier time points is desired, the concentration of agar can be decreased as low as 0.3%39.\nBring the 15 mM Tricaine, screened embryos, low melt agarose, E3 Blue, and a 35 mm glass coverslip bottom culture dish to a dissection light microscope. Carefully remove the embryo's chorion with #5 tweezers. Do this for three embryos.\nPlace the dechorionated embryos in a separate container to be anesthetized. The lid of the coverslip bottom dish is often used for this purpose. Using a transfer pipette, add three drops (approximately 150 µl) of 15 mM Tricaine to the dish of 5 ml E3 blue (if using the lid of the coverslip bottom dish) or until embryos have been sufficiently anesthetized. In addition, add 3-4 drops (approximately 150 - 200 µl) of 15 mM Tricaine solution to the 1% melted agarose tube.\nUsing a p200 pipette with 1 cm of the pipette tip cut off; transfer the anesthetized embryos to the coverslip-bottomed dish. Remove any excess E3 Blue:Tricaine solution.",
    "Slowly add 5 - 10 µl of low-melt agarose:Tricaine solution over the embryos, keeping each drop separate to ensure the embryos do not accidentally drift close to one another.\n\tWarning: If the agarose is too warm, it will damage the embryo. A good temperature to maintain the agar at is 42 °C.\nUsing a 21 G 1 ½ needle, gently orient the embryo in the agarose to the desired position. When using an inverted microscope for time-lapse imaging, orient the region of interest (ROI) as close to the coverslip as possible.\n\tNote: For general purposes, the tail region offers ease of orientation and clarity due to the relatively thin tissue (Figure 1A). Other tissues, such as the epithelial layer surrounding the yolk and fin folds, can be used28,29. These tissues offer great clarity, however these regions are only a few cell layers thick. For the purpose of this protocol, it is beneficial to image the tail region to acquire as many cell divisions as possible.\nAllow a few min for partial solidification of the agar. Use the needle to break apart a small piece of agar to test its solidification. When a piece of agar can be pulled away from the drop, proceed to the next step.\nCover the entire coverslip with low melt agar forming a dome over the embedded embryos. Allow the agar to solidify before moving the dish for confocal imaging (Figure 1A).\nDuring the agar solidification process (takes approximately 10 min), prepare 3 ml of E3 Blue solution with five drops of (approximately 250 µl) 15 mM Tricaine to be placed over the embedded embryos during imaging.\n4. 5D Confocal Imaging of Live Zebrafish Embryos40,41",
    "NOTE: See Ariga40 and O'Brien41 for details on how to perform 5D imaging using other confocal systems. For Z-interval, Z-stack, Z-depth, time interval, and 5D definitions see Figure 1C.\nOpen the imaging software and set the microscope to 60X NA 1.4 objective lens. Apply immersion oil to the objective lens and place the culture dish in the slide holder on the microscope stage. Using the axis controller, center the embryo of interest above the objective lens and bring the objective lens upward to meet the culture dish.\nClick on the eye piece icon and switch to the GFP filter on the microscope. Focus on the ROI. Focusing on the tissue closest to the coverslip will offer the best imaging results.\nRemove the interlock. Select the GFP and mCherry channels (pre-set wavelengths in software) and set the line averaging option to normal.\nUse \"View/Acquisition Controls/A1 Scan Area\" command to open the A1 Scan Area tool.\nBegin scanning. Using the axis-controller, position the embryo so that the scan area is filled with as much of the zebrafish as possible. The laser power does not need to be optimal at this point. Lower the laser power to avoid unnecessary photobleaching.\nUse the \"View/Acquisition Controls/ND acquisition\" command to open the ND acquisition control panel.\nBegin scanning to set the Z-stack parameters. Set the Z-stack upper limit to where the cells are not in focus and lower limit to where cells are no longer visible. Allow for a 3 µm space above the sample for growth and cell movement, which may expand into the imaging field. The Z-stack for the figures shown in this protocol covered a Z-depth of 40 µm in the embryo tail.",
    "Set the Z-interval step size to 2 µm. On average, a cell is 10 µm in diameter; therefore 2 µm will produce five intervals of imaging data to be analyzed for each cell.\n\tNOTE: The depth of the image that can be acquired depends on the Z interval. Z resolution is sacrificed to gain overall depth in the Z dimension in order to image as many cells undergoing mitosis as possible (large Z-depth). The inverse is true, in that, by decreasing the step size, Z resolution is gained, while Z depth is sacrificed (small Z-depth).\nAdjust the image laser power, HV, and offset levels. For the experiments demonstrated in this protocol, use the following laser power, HV, and offset levels set at the corresponding levels, respectively, for the GFP channel; 2 - 5, 120 - 140, and -9 to -11. For the mCherry channel, use the following laser power, HV, and offset levels, respectively; 3 - 6, 120 - 140, and -3 to -8. Once the parameters are set, shut off the scan to prevent unnecessary laser exposure that may cause phototoxicity and photobleaching of the sample.\nSelect the 2x line averaging icon. \"No averaging\" produces a grainy image while \"4x line averaging\" drastically increases the scan time. Use of 2x line averaging provides the best image quality and fastest scan time.\nSelect the appropriate time interval and time duration necessary for the experiment. For wild-type divisions, two-minute time intervals for 2 hr is best for determining mitotic duration (used in Figures 1, 2, 3A, and 3B). Divisions that activate the spindle assembly checkpoint for longer than 30 min are more suitable for five minute intervals for four hr in order to preserve fluorescence as demonstrated in Figure 3C.",
    "Check the \"save to file\" box and name the file to automatically save the file as it is being acquired. Double check all parameters are set correctly and hit \"start run\".\nAfter acquisition is complete, to view the file in a three dimensional format, click on the volume threshold icon.\nSubscription Required.
