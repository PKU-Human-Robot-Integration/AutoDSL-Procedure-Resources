    "1. Washing the coverslips\nNOTE: Wash (24 mm x 60 mm, #1.5) coverslips according to Smith et al., 201328.\nArrange coverslips in a plastic slide mailer container.\nSubmerge coverslips sequentially in the following solutions and sonicate for 30-60 min, rinsing with ddH2O 10 times in between each solution: ddH2O with one drop of dish soap; 0.1 M KOH. Store coverslips in 100% ethanol for up to 6 months.\n\tNOTE: Do not touch glass surfaces with ungloved fingers. Use forceps instead.\n2. Coating cleaned (24 mm x 60 mm, #1.5) coverslips with mPEG- and biotin-PEG-silane\nNOTE: This protocol specifically uses a biotin-streptavidin system to position actin and microtubules within the TIRF imaging plane. Other coatings and systems may be used (e.g., antibodies, poly-L-lysine, NEM myosin, etc.).\nThaw aliquots of PEG-silane and biotin-PEG-silane powders.\nDissolve PEG powders in 80% ethanol (pH 2.0) to generate coating stock solutions of 10 mg/mL mPEG-silane and 2-4 mg/mL biotin-PEG-silane, just before the use.\n\tNOTE: PEG powders often appear dissolved but may not be at the microscopic level. Proper resuspension takes ~1-2 min with constant pipetting. Users are encouraged to pipette an additional 10 times following the appearance of powder dissolution.\n\tCAUTION: Wear gloves to protect skin from concentrated HCl when making 80% ethanol (pH 2.0).\nRemove the clean (24 mm x 60 mm, #1.5) coverslip from ethanol storage using forceps. Dry with nitrogen gas and store in a clean Petri dish.\nCoat coverslips with 100 µL of coating solution: a mixture of 2 mg/mL mPEG-silane (MW 2,000) and 0.04 mg/mL biotin-PEG-silane (MW 3,400) in 80% ethanol (pH 2.0).\n\tNOTE: For sparse coating (recommended) use 2 mg/mL mPEG-silane and 0.04 mg/mL biotin-PEG-silane. For dense coating use 2 mg/mL mPEG-silane, 4 mg/mL biotin-PEG-silane.\nIncubate coverslips at 70 °C for at least 18 h or until use.",
    "NOTE: Coated coverslips degrade if stored at 70 °C for more than 2 weeks.\n3. Assembling imaging flow chambers\nCut 12 strips of double-backed double-sided tape to a length of 24 mm. Remove one side of the tape backing and fix pieces of tape adjacent to the six grooves present on a clean imaging chamber.\n\tNOTE: Tape must be flat for proper assembly, otherwise imaging chambers will leak. Carefully remove the tape backing to avoid bumps. Sliding taped chambers on a clean surface to smooth tape-chamber contacts is recommended.\nRemove the second piece of tape backing to expose the sticky side of the tape along each chamber groove. Place chamber tape side up on a clean surface.\nMix epoxy resin and hardener solutions 1:1 (or according to manufacturer's instructions) in a small weigh boat.\nUse a P1000 tip to place a drop of mixed epoxy between the tape strips at the end of each imaging chamber groove (red arrow; Figure 1A). Place chamber tape/epoxy side up on a clean surface.\nRemove a coated coverslip from 70 °C incubator. Rinse coated and uncoated surfaces of coverslips with ddH2O six times, dry with filtered nitrogen gas, and then affix to the imaging chamber with the coverslip coating side toward the tape.\nUse a P200 or P1000 pipette tip to apply pressure on the tape-glass interface to ensure a good seal between the tape and the coverslip.\n\tNOTE: With a proper seal, double-sided tape becomes translucent. Imaging chambers lacking sufficient tape-chamber contacts will leak.\nIncubate assembled chambers at room temperature for at least 5-10 min to allow the epoxy to fully seal chamber wells before use. Perfusion chambers expire within 12-18 h of assembly.",
    "NOTE: Depending on tape placement and the thickness of double-sided tape used, the assembled chamber will have a final volume of 20-50 µL.\n4. Conditioning of perfusion chambers\nUse a perfusion pump (rate set to 500 µL/min) to sequentially exchange conditioning solutions in perfusion chamber as follows:\n\t\nFlow 50 µL of 1% BSA to prime the imaging chamber. Remove excess buffer from Luer lock fitting reservoir.\nFlow 50 µL of 0.005 mg/mL streptavidin. Incubate for 1-2 min at room temperature. Remove excess buffer from reservoir.\nFlow 50 µL of 1% BSA to block nonspecific binding. Incubate for 10-30 s. Remove excess buffer from reservoir.\nFlow 50 µL of warm (37 °C) 1x TIRF buffer (1x BRB80, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 40 mM glucose, 0.25% (v/v) methylcellulose (4,000 cp)).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not remove excess buffer from the reservoir. This prevents the chamber from drying out, which can introduce air bubbles into the system.\nOptional: Flow 50 µL of stabilized29 and 50% biotinylated microtubule seeds diluted in 1x TIRF buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The proper dilution must be empirically determined and contain batch to batch variability. Protocols from27,29 are recommended as starting points. A dilution yielding 10-30 seeds per field of view works well with this setup.\n5. Microscope preparation\nNOTE: Biochemical reactions containing dynamic actin filaments and microtubules are visualized/performed using an inverted Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscope equipped with 120-150 mW solid-state lasers, a temperature corrected 63x oil immersion TIRF objective, and an EMCCD camera. Proteins in this example are visualized at the following wavelengths: 488 nm (microtubules) and 647 nm (actin).\nSet the stage/objective heater device to maintain 35-37 °C at least 30 min prior to imaging the first biochemical reaction.\nSet the image acquisition parameters as follows:\n\t\nSet acquisition interval to every 5 s for 15-20 min.",
    "Set 488 and 647 laser exposures to 50-100 ms at 5%-10% power. Set appropriate TIRF angle for microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Regardless of microscope setup, the simplest way to set the laser power, exposure, and TIRF angle is to make adjustments on images of either polymer alone (see 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2, below). Users are strongly encouraged to use the lowest laser power and exposure settings that still permit detection.\n\t\t\nAdjust the polymerization reaction (Figure 1C) to initiate actin filament assembly and acquire images at 647 nm. Make appropriate adjustments.\nAdjust the polymerization reaction in a second conditioned perfusion well to initiate microtubule assembly (Figure 1C) and visualize at 488 nm. Make appropriate adjustments.\n6.

    "Calculate the concentration of lysine labeled Alexa-647-actin using the extinction coefficient of unlabeled actin, the fluor correction factor of 0.03, and the following formula:\n\t\t\t[Alexa-647 actin], µM = (Abs290 - imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64074/64074eq03.jpg\nCalculate the percent label of Alexa-647-actin using the determined ε for Alexa-647 of 239,000 M-1 cm-1, as follows:\n\t\t\t% label of Alexa-647-actin = (Abs290 - (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64074/64074eq04.jpg\nThaw one 2 µL aliquot of 3 µM 100% labeled biotin-actin (labeled on lysine residues). Dilute 10-fold by adding 18 µL of G-buffer.\nCombine 3 µL of diluted biotinylated actin, appropriate volumes of unlabeled and labeled actin (above) such that the final mix will be 12.5 µM total actin with 10%-30% fluorescent label.\n\t\tNOTE: Greater than 30% percent fluorescent actin monomers (final) can compromise imaging resolution as filaments become difficult to discern from the background.\nPrepare reaction mixes (Figure 1C).\n\t\nPrepare cytoskeleton mix (Tube A) by combining 2 µL of the 12.5 µM actin mix stock (6.2.3) with the tubulin stock mix (6.1.4), no more than 15 min prior to imaging. Store on ice until use.\nPrepare protein reaction mix (Tube B) by combining all other experimental components and proteins, including: 2x TIRF buffer, anti-bleach, nucleotides, buffers, and accessory proteins. An example is shown in Figure 1C.\n\t\tNOTE: The final dilution results in a 1x TIRF buffer that contains ATP, GTP, and ionic strength within the estimated physiological range.\nIncubate Tube A and Tube B separately at 37 °C for 30-60 s. To initiate reaction, mix and add the contents of Tube B to Tube A (below).\n7. Image actin and microtubule dynamics\nCondition perfusion well (Figure 1B; step 4, above).\nInitiate actin and microtubule assembly simultaneously by adding the contents of Tube B (reaction mix) to Tube A (cytoskeleton mix) (Figure 1C).",
    "Flow 50 µL of reaction containing 1x TIRF buffer supplemented with 15 µM free tubulin, 1 mM GTP, and 0.5 µM actin monomers and appropriate volumes of buffer controls.\nRecord time-lapse movie using microscope software to acquire every 5 s for 15-20 min.\n\tNOTE: Initiation of actin and microtubule dynamics occurs within 2-5 min (Figure 2). Longer delays indicate problems with temperature control or concentration-related problems of proteins in the reaction mix.\nCondition a new perfusion well (step 4) and replace buffer volume with regulatory protein(s) of interest (i.e., Tau) and buffer controls (Figure 1C). Acquire as outlined in step 7 (above) to assess regulatory proteins for emergent actin-microtubule functions.\n8. Process and analyze images using FIJI software31\nOpen saved TIRF movies and view as a composite.\nAnalyze microtubule dynamics (Figure 3A), as follows:\n\t\nGenerate a time-based maximum Z-projection from the image stacks menu.\nSynchronize Z-projection window with the original TIRF movie from the Analyze> Tools> Synchronize Windows menu.\nDraw a line using the straight-line tool along a microtubule of interest on the time projected image.\n\t\t\nOpen the region of interest (ROI) manager from the analyze menu (Analyze> Tools> ROI Manager).\nSave individual microtubule locations by pressing \"t\".

In such a case, measurements can be made at regular intervals over non-consecutive frames, (e.g., every five frames).\nPlot measured length values over elapsed time. The slope of the generated line is the actin elongation rate in microns/s.\nConvey final calculated rates as subunits s-1 µM-1 using a correction factor of 370 subunits to account for the number of actin monomers in a micron of filament32.\nPerform correlative analysis for regions of parallel actin-microtubule association (Figure 3C), as follows:\n\t\nDraw a line along a microtubule of interest at a specific time point (i.e., 300 s after reaction initiation), using the straight-line tool.\n\t\t\nAdd line to ROI manager as in step 8.2.3.1, above.\nPlot the fluorescence intensity along the line in each channel.\n\t\t\nSelect each channel with the image slider and plot the intensities along the line using \"command k\".\nSave or export values by clicking the \"list\" button in the output window.\nExpress actin-microtubule coupling events as a ratio (actin overlapping with microtubules) from individual events or as a count of events in a given field of view at a consistent timepoint (Figure 3C).",
