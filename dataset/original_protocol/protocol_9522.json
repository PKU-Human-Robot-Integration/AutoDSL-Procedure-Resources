    "NOTE: EMSAs using fluorescently labeled DNA probes or other forms of labeled DNA share the same protocols for protein or cell extract preparation, protein-DNA binding reaction, and PAGE gel preparation and running (Figure 1A). The key differences are DNA labeling procedures, post-run gel processing steps, and detection methods.\n1. Gel Preparation\nPrepare 5% native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5x TBE (45 mM Tris-Borate, 1 mM EDTA) and 2.5% glycerol, using a mini protein gel system (8.3 cm width x 7.3 cm length x 0.75 mm thickness).\n\t\nTo prepare 30 mL of gel solution for 4 gels, mix 5 mL of 30% Acrylamide/Bis (37.5:1), 3 mL of 5x TBE (0.45 M Tris-Borate, 10 mM EDTA), 1.5 mL of 50% Glycerol, 300 µL of 10% Ammonium Persulfate, 15 µL of TEMED, and 20.2 mL of ddH2O thoroughly.\n\t\tNOTE: Acrylamide is harmful and toxic, handle with appropriate personal protective equipment.\nCast the gel solution immediately. After polymerization, wrap the gels in clear plastic wrap pre-wetted with 0.5x TBE and store them at 4 °C.\n2. Preparation of Infrared Fluorescent Dye-labeled Probes\nNOTE: Keep the infrared fluorescent dye-labeled oligonucleotides away from light as much as possible during preparation, storage, and experiments.\nDesign and order oligonucleotides.\n\t\nDesign long oligonucleotide for ~51-mers.\n\t\tNOTE: The long oligonucleotide sequence of the LIM-4/SOX-2 probe is TATCATATCTATTCTATGATTAAATACCTATTCATTTCAAAATCTTCTCCC. Long oligonucleotides do not require PAGE or HPLC purification.\nDesign complementary short oligonucleotides for ~14-mers with infrared fluorescent dye modification at the 5' terminus (5'Dye) and a melting temperature above 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The short oligonucleotide sequence of the LIM-4/SOX-2 probe is 5'Dye-GGGAGAAGATTTTG. The minimum synthesis scale of 5'Dye-labeled short oligonucleotides is 100 nM. Therefore, the oligonucleotides require HPLC purification.\nResuspend oligonucleotides in 1x Tris-EDTA buffer (TE: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA) to final concentration of 100 µM.",
    "Anneal Short (5'Dye) and Long oligonucleotides.\n\t\nMix 0.6 µL of 5'Dye-Short oligo (100 µM), 1.2 µL of Long oligo (100 µM), and 28.2 µL of sodium chloride-Tris-EDTA buffer (STE: 100 mM NaCl; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA) in a 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace the tube in boiling water for 5 min. Turn off the heat source and let the water with the annealed oligos cool O/N in the dark.\nFill in the 5' overhangs of annealed 5'Dye-Short/Long oligos with Klenow DNA polymerase to make double stranded DNA probes.\n\t\nPrepare the reaction by mixing 30 µL of annealed short/long oligos with 5'Dye tag, 8.5 µL of 10x Klenow buffer, 1.7 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1.7 µL of Klenow (3'->5' exo-) (5 u/µL), and 43.1 µL of ddH2O in a 0.2 mL PCR tube.\nIncubate 60 min at 37 °C in a PCR machine.\nAdd 3.4 µL 0.5 M EDTA to stop the reaction and heat inactivate at 75 °C for 20 min in a PCR machine.\nDilute filled-in probes (0.7 µM) in STE for final concentration of 0.1 µM.\nStore oligos at -20 °C in the dark until ready to use. Oligos may be stored for up to a year in this condition.\n\tNOTE: To generate DNA probes with mutant binding sites, mutant versions of long oligonucleotides are annealed with 5'Dye-labeled short oligonucleotides, followed by fill-in of 5' overhangs with Klenow. It has been shown that the probe with one strand labeled with an infrared fluorescent dye has only 30% intensity of the probe with both strands labeled with the dye. If signal intensity needs to be strengthened, long oligos of both strands are labeled with infrared fluorescent dyes at 5' termini and annealed to make infrared fluorescent dye-labeled probes.\n3. Preparation of Unlabeled/Cold Probes (Competitors)",
    "Note: Long oligonucleotides of complementary sequences (Long and LongR) were annealed to make unlabeled probes for competition analysis with infrared fluorescent dye-labeled probes.\nMix 20 µL of 100 µM Long, 20 µL of 100 µM LongR oligonucleotides, and 60 µL of STE in a 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace the tube in boiling water for 5 min, turn off the heat source and let the water with the annealed oligos cool overnight.\n4. Binding Reaction and Electrophoresis\nPrepare 1 mL of 5x binding buffer by mixing 50 µL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 µL of 5 M NaCl; 200 µL of 1 M KCl, 5 µL of 1 M MgCl2, 10 µL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0; 5 µL of 1 M DTT; 25 µL of 10 mg/mL BSA, and 695 µL of ddH2O.\n\tNOTE: The 5x Binding Buffer can be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. Another point to consider is that different transcription factors will have different modifications to the binding buffer.\nRight before setting up binding reactions, pre-run the 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5x TBE + 2.5% glycerol to remove all traces of ammonium persulfate at 80 V for 30 - 60 min, or until the current no longer varies with time.\nSet up the binding reaction in final volume of 20 µL.\n\t\nMix 4 µL of 5x binding buffer, 80 - 200 ng purified protein A (in 50% glycerol, i.e., SOX-2), 1 µL of 0.1 µM Dye-conjugated probe (final concentration: 5 nM), and ddH2O.\nOptional: When cold probe competitors are required, add various concentrations (2x, 10x, 25x, 50x, 100x, etc.) of cold probes.\nOptional: When the interaction between proteins A and B (i.e., SOX-2 and LIM-4) is tested, add 80 - 200 ng purified protein B (in 50% glycerol, i.e., LIM-4).",
    "Optional: When nuclear extract preparation is used and specific binding of protein A is to be validated, add antibody specific to protein A (i.e., anti-6xHis, anti-FLAG, etc.).\nIncubate at R/T in dark for 15 min.\nLoad all of the binding reaction onto the gel and run the gel at 10 V/cm to desired distance.\n5. Imaging\nNOTE: The gel was scanned directly in the glass plates with an advanced infrared imaging system. Therefore, the gel can be resolved further and scanned repeatedly (Figures 1C and 2). A near-infrared fluorescent imaging system primarily for Western blots was also tested to scan the gel, but only the advanced infrared imaging system was able to scan the gel with good resolution. The methodology described is specific to a particular infrared imaging software, although other software packages may be used.\nClean the bed of the scanner with ddH2O and dry well before scanning. Wipe dry the glass plates of the gel and place the plates containing the gel on the scanner bed.\nOpen the infrared imaging software and go to the 'Acquire' tab. When the thinner plate (1 mm) is placed on the scanner bed, use the settings of Channel: 700, Intensity: Auto, Resolution: 169 µm, Quality: medium, and Focus offset: 1.5 mm. When the thicker plate (3 mm) is placed on the scanner bed, use the settings of Channel: 700, Intensity: Auto, Resolution: 84 µm, Quality: medium, and Focus offset: 3.5 mm. Focus offset depends on the thickness of the glass plate.\nSelect the area that the gel occupies on the scanner. Click 'Start' to begin the scan.\nRepeat electrophoresis and scan additionally as necessary.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
