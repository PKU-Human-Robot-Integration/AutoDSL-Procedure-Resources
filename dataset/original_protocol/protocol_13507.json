    "The teeth used in this study were part of a project approved by the local Ethics Committee (EKNZ UBE-15/111). The participants provided written informed consent, and all data were de-identified to protect patient confidentiality.\n1. Detection of tooth colored composite resin material using FIT\nDarken the room (natural and artificial light).\nWear clear or yellow-tinted safety glasses with UV protection.\nUse a fluorescence-inducing light source to illuminate the tooth substance and tooth-colored composite resin restoration (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The composite resin material will appear brighter than the tooth substance (Figure 2). Any device with a wavelength of 398 ± 5 nm might be used as a fluorescence-inducing light source. Headlamp systems appear to be particularly suitable since the light spot illuminates the entire oral cavity and enables simultaneous tactile examination. Obstructive factors such as saliva and plaque do not interfere with the FIT method; therefore, previous cleaning and repeated drying of the teeth is not necessary.\n2. Removal of composite resin-bonded trauma splints using FIT\nPreoperative scan with an intraoral scanning device and appropriate software for experimental evaluation purposes\n\t\nStart the intraoral scanning device and open the software (see the Table of Materials).\nPress Add New Patient to register your patient, fill in the gaps Last Name, First Name, Date of Birth, and Patient ID, and press Add Case.\nChoose Jaw Scan and Impressions under the section Indications. Then, press Next.\nDarken the room (natural and artificial light) and dry the field of operation to ease the scanning procedure.\nStart the intraoral scanner and perform a digital surface scan of the field of operation (Figure 3A).\nVisualization of the composite resin material\n\t\nRepeat steps 1.1-1.3.\nRemove the composite resin material using the common methods (e.g., a high-speed contra-angle handpiece with diamond burs and polishing devices) (Figure 4).",
    "NOTE: Remove the composite resin remnants close to the enamel with a carbide bur designed for debonding.\nPostoperative scan for experimental volumetric assessment\n\t\nRepeat steps 2.1.1-2.1.5.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nExperimental volumetric assessment\n\t\nPress Export to export the pre- and postoperative scans as surface tessellation language (STL) in highest resolution.\nOpen suitable software and press recombine.\nUpload the pre- and postoperative scans to the software by pressing Import.\nPress Arrangement to superimpose the pre- and postoperative scans by the best fit method.\nPress Analysis to visualize the volumetric changes from pre- to postoperative scans. Select the tooth sites where volumetric changes presumably occurred by choosing Region under the section Tools. Analyze volumetric changes by using the linear and volumetric measurement software tools, Distances tool and Volume Analysis tool, respectively.\n\t\t\nPress Distances under the section Tools for linear quantification of tooth substance loss and composite resin remnants in color (e.g., unchanged areas: green, substance loss: blue and violet, excess material: yellow and red, Figure 3B). Use the color bar on the left to quantify linear volumetric changes. Additionally, locate the cursor on the relevant tooth sites; look for the exact cursor distance in the box on the left.\nPress Volume Analysis under the section Tools for volumetric quantification of tooth substance loss and composite resin remnants . Look for the volumetric change in the box on the left.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
