    "This protocol describes the generation of a human neuron/astrocyte co-culture to model seeded and spontaneous intraneuronal tau aggregation. A visual representation of the co-culture protocol is shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-fig-0001]. Before the experiment, human iPSCs with a stably integrated, doxycycline-inducible neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) transgene are cultured as described in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0002], and human primary astrocytes are cultured as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0003]. At day –2, human iPSCs are plated in TesR-E8 medium in the presence of a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (RI). After 1 day, the medium is switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), and iPSC-derived neural progenitors are virally transduced for FTDtau variants. At day 0, human primary astrocytes are plated on top of iPSC-derived neural progenitors in neurobasal medium with neurotrophic factors. Arabinosylcytosine (AraC) treatment at day 1 inhibits cell proliferation. Doxycycline supplementation until day 2 drives Ngn2 transgene expression, and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supplementation supports neuronal differentiation. From week 1, medium is refreshed weekly and supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to support astrocyte viability until fixation and analysis at week 4.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/028873e5-4b72-41c2-be93-4d6853793c54/cpz1900-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Schematic representation of the protocol to introduce intraneuronal tau pathology in a human neuron/astrocyte co-culture. At experimental day –2, neurogenin 2 (Ngn2)-human iPSCs are plated in TesR-E8 in the presence of Rho kinase inhibitor (RI). At day –1, medium is switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), and Ngn2-human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) neural progenitors are virally transduced for FTDtau variants. Astrocytes are plated on top of Ngn2 neural progenitors (day 0 of co-culture) in neurobasal medium (NB + B27) with supplements. Arabinosylcytosine (AraC) treatment at day 1 inhibits cell proliferation. Doxycycline supplementation until day 2 drives Ngn2 transgene expression, and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supplementation supports neuronal differentiation. From week 1, medium is refreshed weekly and supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to support astrocyte viability until fixation and analysis at week 4.\nMaterials\nGeltrex (see recipe)\nDMEM/F12 (e.g., Life Technologies, cat. no. 11320033)\nTesR-E8 medium (see recipe)\n10 μg/ml NT3 (see recipe)\n20 μg/ml BDNF (see recipe)\n40 mg/ml doxycycline (see recipe)\nRI (see recipe)\nNear-confluent plate of human iPSCs with stably integrated doxycycline-inducible reverse tetracycline (rtTA)/Ngn2 (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0002]; generated as described in Frega et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0007]) or EBiSC line BIOni010-C-13 (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0002] and Schmid et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0027]; e.g., European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, cat. no. 66540561)\nGentle cell dissociation reagent (e.g., StemCell Technologies, cat. no. 07174)\nTrypan blue (e.g., Life Technologies, cat. no. 15250061)\nDMEM (see recipes)\nViral particles encoding fluorescently tagged 2N4R human tau (microtubule-associated protein tau [MAPT]) containing the P301L (FTDtau1) or P301L+S320F (FTDtau1+2) mutations (prepared as described in Moro et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0019]; Naldini et al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0021])\nAccutase (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "We observed that Geltrex greatly prevented cell clustering and culture detachment, which may complicate the culture of human iPSC-derived neurons on surfaces coated with poly-L-ornithine and mouse laminin (Kuijlaars et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0016]; Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3e493997-83e0-425c-9bce-8cada655f21e/cpz1900-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nGeltrex-coating increases culture integrity compared with coating with poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and laminin.

Immunostaining was performed for neurons (microtubule-associated protein-2 [MAP2]), and cell nuclei were visualized using DAPI. Merged fluorescence channels are shown for MAP2 (grayscale) and DAPI (blue).\n1. Thaw Geltrex aliquot at 4°C, and dilute 1:50 with cold DMEM/F12.\nThe final dilution of Geltrex is thus 1:100.\n2. Add 100 μl diluted Geltrex per well to the inner 32 wells of a 96-well plate.\nThe outer 64 wells will be filled with sterile PBS to prevent evaporation of medium.\n3. Incubate for 4 hr at 37°C.\n4. Use immediately (continue to step 5), or seal with parafilm and incubate 1 to 3 days at 4°C.\nStart neuronal induction of Ngn2-iPSCs (day –2)\nHuman iPSCs should lack obvious signs of differentiation. See Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-fig-0003], left panel, for a representative image of a human iPSC colony before detachment.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bb5bbecb-5158-4d8d-b388-bc5c6cf2ffc3/cpz1900-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal progenitors form neurite-like protrusions after 24 hr of doxycycline (dox)-induced neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) expression.

The formation of neurite-like protrusions, as shown in the zoomed area indicated in the right, should be confirmed before proceeding to viral transduction.",
    "Human iPSCs should harbor a stably integrated doxycycline-inducible rtTA/Ngn2 transgene cassette. We used a previously generated clonal human iPSC line stably expressing rtTA/Ngn2 (Frega et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0007]) that was maintained as previously described (Batenburg et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0001], 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0002]). For culture procedures for human iPSCs, see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0002].\nHuman iPSCs are cultured in a 6-well plate. One near-confluent well of iPSCs in a 6-well plate gives rise to ∼4–7 × 105 cells. For co-culture, 1.3 × 105 iPSCs are needed for 32 wells in a 96-well plate. Therefore, to generate three to five co-culture plates you need one near-confluent well of iPSCs.\n5. Let 96-well plate come to room temperature (RT). In the meantime, proceed to step 6.\n6. Prepare TesR-E8 medium containing 10 ng/ml NT3, 10 ng/ml BDNF, 2 µg/ml doxycycline, and 10 µM RI. Prepare a total of 5 ml for dissociation of one well of iPSCs (prewarmed), 1 ml for resuspension of one well of iPSCs (prewarmed), and 7 ml for plating 32 wells in a 96-well plate (RT). Also prepare a sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with 10 μl trypan blue.\n7. Aspirate spent medium of human iPSCs with a suction needle or 5-ml serological pipette.\n8. Gently add 1000 μl gentle cell dissociation reagent per well of a 6-well plate. Return plate to 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2. Incubate for 7 to 9 min until gaps appear between cells at the border and center of the colonies.\n9. Gently aspirate gentle cell dissociation reagent with a 1000-μl pipette.\n10. Detach colonies by flushing with 1 ml prewarmed TesR-E8 medium (prepared in step 6). Gently make single cells by pipetting up and down with a 1000-μl pipette against the border of the well. Avoid bubble formation.",
    "11. Collect cell suspension into a 15-ml tube containing the remaining 4 ml prewarmed TesR-E8 medium. Centrifuge 7 min at 340 × g, RT.\n12. Aspirate supernatant with a suction needle or 10-ml serological pipette. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml prewarmed TesR-E8 medium.\n13. Mix 10 μl cell suspension in 10 μl trypan blue, and count viable human iPSCs in a hemocytometer following the manufacturer's instruction. Dilute human iPSCs in TesR-E8 medium at RT to a density of 4000 iPSCs per 200 μl medium.\n14. Remove Geltrex solution from the 96-well plate, and add 200 μl cell suspension per well using a multichannel pipette.\nAfter removing the Geltrex solution from the plate, take care to not let the wells dry out at any time.\n15. Cover 96-well plate with aluminum foil, and incubate for 15 min on a bench at RT.\nWe observed that cell attachment at RT results in a more homogeneous distribution of cells within the well, in line with previous observations (Lundholt et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0018]).\n16. Incubate plate overnight in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nTransduce neural progenitors with FTDtau variants (day –1)",
    "Compare different batches of viral vectors in order to ensure consistent transduction efficiencies across independent experiments. Since all viral vectors used in this study contain an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tag, we recommend comparing the fluorescence intensity of different concentrations (2, 4, 6, and 8 μl/ml recommended) of newly prepared viral vector with previous viral vectors or a reference vector of known titer. This can be performed in cell culture systems of reduced complexity (e.g., rodent primary neurons or neuronal cell lines). Typical viral titers obtained with the method described in Moro et al. (2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0019]) and Naldini et al. (1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0021]) range from 5 × 108 to 1 × 109 infectious units/ml.\nBefore proceeding, confirm the formation of neurite-like cellular protrusions after 24 hr of doxycycline-induced Ngn2 expression (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-fig-0003], right panel). If absent, start a new experiment, and make sure that doxycycline is present from day –2.\n17. For 32 wells of a 96-well plate, prepare 8 ml DMEM containing 10 ng/ml NT3, 10 ng/ml BDNF, and 2 µg/ml doxycycline. Prewarm in water bath. With this medium, prepare viral dilutions (200 μl per well).\nIn this protocol, lentiviral particles encoding 2N4R tau containing the P301L (FTDtau1) or P301L+S320F (FTDtau1+2) mutations were used. Both constructs contain a C-terminal eGFP tag and were cloned in a second-generation lentiviral backbone under a cytomegalovirus promoter. Lentiviral particle production was according to Naldini et al. (1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0021]), and the step-by-step procedure has been described in Moro et al. (2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0019]).\nFor a viral vector prepared as described in Moro et al. (2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0019]) and Naldini et al. (1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0021]), we recommend using a 4 μl/ml dilution for 30% to 40% transduction efficiency. It is important to note, however, that efficiencies may vary due to differences in viral titer (see above).",
    "18. Remove spent medium using a multichannel pipette, and add 200 μl of each viral preparation per well.\n19. Incubate plate for 24 hr in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nWash viral particles, plate primary human astrocytes on top of iPSC-derived neuronal progenitors (day 0)\nHuman primary astrocytes should not be overconfluent, grown under nutrition-limited conditions (yellowish medium), or lack obvious signs of cell death. We used primary human fetal astrocytes that were cultured according to distributor's instructions and as previously described (Batenburg et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0001], 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0002]). For the culture procedures of human primary astrocytes, see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0003].\nHuman astrocytes are cultured in a 6-well plate. One confluent well of astrocytes in a 6-well plate gives rise to ∼0.8–1 × 106 cells. For co-culture, 1.3 × 105 astrocytes are needed for 32 wells in a 96-well plate. Therefore, to generate six to eight co-culture plates, you need one confluent well of astrocytes.\n20. Let Accutase come to RT.\n21. Prepare neurobasal medium containing 10 ng/ml NT3, 10 ng/ml BDNF, and 2 µg/ml doxycycline. Prepare a total of 7 ml for washing Ngn2 precursors (prewarmed), 5 min for dissociating astrocytes (prewarmed), 1 ml for resuspending astrocytes (prewarmed), and 7 ml for plating astrocytes in 32 wells of a 96-well plate (RT). Prepare 1 ml PBS for washing one well of astrocytes in a 6-well plate (prewarmed) and 13 ml PBS for filling outer wells of the 96-well plate (RT). Also prepare a sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with 10 μl trypan blue.\n22. Aspirate all medium containing viral particles from the 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.",
    "23. Add 200 μl freshly prepared neurobasal medium per well. Incubate for 1 hr in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2. In the meantime, proceed to step 24.\n24. Aspirate all spent medium from human primary astrocytes using a suction needle or 5-ml serological pipette. Wash once with 1 ml prewarmed, sterile PBS.\n25. Gently add 1000 μl RT Accutase per well of a 6-well plate. Return plate to a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nBy gently tapping the plate, astrocytes will visibly come off. Proceed to the next step once roughly two-thirds of the cells are detached and the rest start to round up, which usually takes 7 min.\n26. Detach astrocytes by flushing with Accutase. Gently make single cells by pipetting up and down with a 1000-μl pipette against the border of the well. Avoid bubble formation.\n27. Collect cell suspension into a 15-ml tube with 5 ml prewarmed neurobasal medium to neutralize the Accutase. Centrifuge 7 min at 340 × g, RT. In the meantime, proceed to step 28.\n28. Using a multichannel pipette, add 200 μl sterile PBS at RT to the surrounding 64 wells in the 96-well plate to prevent evaporation of medium. Cover plate with aluminum foil, and carefully place plate on a bench to come to RT. In the meantime, proceed to step 29.\nThe temperature within the plate should be in equilibrium with the temperature of the co-culture medium containing the astrocytes to prevent the edge effect.\n29. After centrifugation, aspirate supernatant with a suction needle or 10-ml serological pipette. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml prewarmed neurobasal medium.",
    "30. Mix 10 μl cell suspension in 10 μl trypan blue, and count viable astrocytes in a hemocytometer following the manufacturer's instruction. Dilute astrocytes in neurobasal medium at RT to a density of 4000 astrocytes per 200 μl.\n31. Aspirate medium from the 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette. Add 200 μl cell suspension per well using a multichannel pipette.\n32. Cover 96-well plate with aluminum foil, and incubate for 15 min on bench at RT.\nWe observed that cell attachment at RT results in a more homogeneous distribution of astrocytes within the well (also see note at step 15).\n33. Incubate plate overnight in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nInhibit cell proliferation by AraC treatment (day 1)\n34. For 32 wells of a 96-well plate, freshly prepare 3.5 ml neurobasal medium containing 10 ng/ml NT3, 10 ng/ml BDNF, 2 µg/ml doxycycline, and 4 µM AraC. Prewarm in water bath.\n35. Using a multichannel pipette, remove 100 μl medium per well from all wells without touching the culture surface, and add 100 μl freshly prepared neurobasal medium per well.\nSince half of the medium is replaced, the final concentration of AraC is 2 µM.\n36. Incubate plate overnight in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nRefresh medium 2 days after co-culture (day 2)\n37. For 32 wells of a 96-well plate, freshly prepare 3.5 ml neurobasal medium containing 10 ng/ml NT3 and 10 ng/ml BDNF. Prewarm in water bath.\n38. Using a multichannel pipette, remove 100 μl medium per well from all wells without touching the culture surface, and add 100 μl freshly prepared neurobasal medium per well.\n39. Incubate plate overnight in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nRefresh medium on a weekly basis (week 1 until week 4)",
    "Optional seeding of FTDtau1 is performed at day 14 (week 2; see step 43).\n40. Starting from week 1 of co-culture, refresh half the medium once a week (i.e., at days 7, 14, and 21 of co-culture). To do so, freshly prepare and prewarm 3.5 ml neurobasal medium containing FBS, 10 ng/ml NT3, and 10 ng/ml BDNF per 32 wells of a 96-well plate.\nThis medium is supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS to support astrocyte viability.\n41. Remove 90 μl spent medium, and add 100 μl neurobasal medium per well using a multichannel pipette.\nA larger volume is replaced to account for evaporation of medium.\n42. Incubate plate in a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2, until next medium refreshment.\nOptional: add preformed fibrils at week 2 for seeded aggregation of FTDtau1\nThis step is optional, and PFFs are only added to induce seeded aggregation of FTDtau1. For spontaneous aggregation of FTDtau1+2, continue with medium refreshment until week 4.\nIn this section, human K18-truncated FTDtau1 PFFs that were previously generated using heparin and diluted in sodium acetate were used (Wiersma et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0037]).\nIn a similar system, it was previously demonstrated that seeding is optimal after 2 weeks culture compared with seeding at week 1 or 3 (Verheyen et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0036]).\nLipofectamine-3000 (e.g., Invitrogen, cat. no. L3000001) may be used to enhance seeding capacity of PFFs.\nCAUTION: PFFs are hazardous and may thus require special decontamination and disposal procedures that are subject to local guidelines. We recommend handling PFFs in a laminar flow hood, discarding all PFF-exposed consumables in a biohazard waste bin, and cleaning PFF-exposed surfaces with 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in MilliQ water (see also Fenyi et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-bib-0006]).",
    "43. Freshly prepare 3.5 ml neurobasal medium containing FBS, 10 ng/ml NT3, and 10 ng/ml BDNF per 32 wells of a 96-well plate. Prewarm in water bath.

Mix 10 μl cell suspension in 10 μl trypan blue, and count viable astrocytes in a hemocytometer following the manufacturer's instruction.\n27. Calculate volume needed to reach 1–2.5 × 105 cells per well. Add this volume of cell suspension to one Geltrex-coated well of a 6-well plate containing astrocyte medium.\nAstrocytes usually reach confluence after 4 or 7 days by plating 2.5 × 105 or 1 × 105 cells per well, respectively. We recommend plating 1 × 105 astrocytes per well to limit passaging.\n28. Transfer plate to a 37°C humidified incubator, 5% O2 and 5% CO2. In the incubator, move plate in several back-and-forth and side-to-side motions to evenly distribute cells across the surface of the wells. Do not disturb plate for 24 hr.",
    "29. After 2 days, refresh two-thirds of the medium twice a week by removing 2 ml spent medium and adding 2 ml freshly prepared astrocyte medium (total volume 3 ml). Passage astrocytes or proceed to co-culture (Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0001]) once astrocyte cultures reach confluence.\nOne confluent well of astrocytes in a 6-well plate gives rise to ∼0.8–1 × 106 cells. For co-culture (Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.900#cpz1900-prot-0001]), 1.3 × 105 astrocytes are needed for 32 wells in a 96-well plate. Therefore, to generate six to eight co-culture plates, you need one confluent well of astrocytes.\nWe recommend thawing a new vial of cryopreserved astrocytes once cells reach passage number seven.\nCryopreserve astrocytes\nWe recommend cryopreserving astrocytes at or below passage number five for stock-keeping.\n30. Let Accutase come to RT, and cool freezing container to 4°C.\n31. Per confluent well of a 6-well plate, prepare 2 ml astrocyte medium containing 10% (v/v) DMSO. Cool to 4°C. Also prepare 5 ml DMEM/F12 for centrifugation (prewarmed).\n32. Aspirate spent medium of human astrocytes with a suction needle or 5-ml serological pipette.\n33. Gently add 1 ml Accutase per well of a 6-well plate. Return plate to a 37°C humidified incubator, 20% O2 and 5% CO2.\nBy gently tapping the plate, astrocytes will visibly come off. Proceed to the next step once roughly two-third of the cells are detached and the rest start to round up, which usually takes 7 min.\n34. Detach astrocytes by flushing with Accutase. Gently make single cells by pipetting up and down using a 1000-μl pipette against the border of the well. Avoid bubble formation.\n35. Collect cell suspension into a 15-ml tube with 5 ml prewarmed DMEM/F12 to neutralize the Accutase. Centrifuge 7 min at 340 × g, RT.",
    "36. After centrifugation, aspirate supernatant with a suction needle or 10-ml serological pipette. Resuspend pellet in 2 ml prechilled astrocyte medium with 10% (v/v) DMSO.\n37. Split 2 ml astrocyte suspension into two appropriately labelled cryovials using a 1000-μl pipette.\nBy splitting astrocytes from one confluent well (0.8–1 × 106 cells) into two cryovials, one cryovial contains ∼4–5 × 105 cells.\n38. Immediately place cryovials into a prechilled freezing container, and transfer freezing container to a –80°C freezer.\n39. The next day, transfer cryovials to a liquid nitrogen cell storage container or −150°C deep freezer."
