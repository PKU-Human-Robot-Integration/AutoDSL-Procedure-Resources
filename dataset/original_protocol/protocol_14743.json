    "All manipulations follow the guidelines issued by the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (ETS 123 and and 2010/63/EU).\n1. Preparation of Work Area\nProvide a dedicated preparation area, a surgical area and a recovery area.\nConduct the entire surgical procedure in a laminar flow cabinet to minimize environmental contaminants.\nAssemble the supplies (as listed in Materials and Methods) needed on the preparation, surgical and recovery area, using proper aseptic technique.\nEnsure that surgical tools are autoclaved prior to surgery.\nProvide a recirculating water heating pad at a temperature of 38 °C for temperature stabilization during surgery. Cover the heating pad with a sterile waterproof pad.\nProvide an operating microscope with a magnification of at least 6.3X.\nUse an instrument sterilizer, such as a hot bead sterilizer, to sterilize instruments in between surgical procedures.\nPrepare a recovery area consisting of a large cage, lined by flat paper bedding\n2. Preparing the Animals for Surgery\nFor PDL and sham surgery, use 8 week old male mice, housed in standard cages and maintained on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle and fed a standard rodent diet ad libitum.\n\tNote: Here, we use BALB/cJrJ mice but we have also successfully used other strains and various transgenic strains.\nUse Buprenophine as preemptive analgesia (0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg) 30 min prior to surgery.\nAnesthetize the mice by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 5 - 10 mg/kg of xylazine.\nAssess proper anesthetization by observing gradual loss of voluntary movement and muscle relaxation. Test the loss of reflexes by toe pinching.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to prevent dryness of the eyes while under anesthesia.\n3. Surgical Site Preparation\nDisinfect thorax and abdomen with antiseptic chlorhexidine solution.",
    "Shave an area of 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm of the abdomen.\nDisinfect the shaven area using gauze soaked with chlorhexidine solution, then alcohol solution and a final application of chlorhexidine solution.\nPosition the animal in the surgical area so that the prepared surgical site is upwards facing the surgeon.\nDrape the mouse using a waterproof surgical drape with an opening that leaves the disinfected abdominal region exposed while covering the rest of the body to create a sterile working field. Monitor the mouse prior to the procedure for depth of anesthesia.\n4. Pancreatic Duct Ligation\nLaparotomy\n\t\nMake an upper midline incision in the skin extending from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus using a sterile surgical blade. Separate the underlying linea alba and the peritoneum using sterile scissors in order to expose the upper abdominal quadrant.\nPrevent drying-out of the internal organs by regular sprinkling with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride.\nUsing sterile tweezers or swab, retract the stomach superiorly, exposing the spleen and the splenic lobe (the tail region) of the pancreas.\nGently retract the duodenum and part of the upper jejunum to the right upper abdominal quadrant to expose the head, neck and body region of the pancreas covered by the visceral peritoneum.\nLigation\n\t\nLocate the anatomical position of the pancreatic main duct in the neck region of the pancreas.\nIncise the visceral peritoneum and the gastrocolic ligament, granting access to the retroperitoneum, exposing the body and tail region of the pancreas. In order to expose the neck region, perform a Kocher maneuver. Lift the duodenum and head of the pancreas off the retroperitoneum elevating them from the inferior vena cava and aorta below.",
    "Carefully place the spatula underneath the neck region. Ligate the pancreatic duct with 6-0 Prolene thread at the left side of the portal vein that separates the gastro-duodenal and splenic lobes.\nPerform a second ligation in close proximity to the first ligation to ensure that the lobes are adequately separated.\nLigate very carefully in order not to damage the underlying blood vessels, namely the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and the pancreatic part of the splenic artery.\nPlace the organs back into the abdominal cavity.\nClose the incision using 4-0 polyglycol filamentous thread in a continuous suture pattern for the muscle/peritoneal layer and in a discontinuous suture pattern for the skin.\n5. Sham Surgery\nPerform all steps as described in steps 1 through 4.1.4. While the pancreas is exposed, do not perform ligation of the pancreatic duct.\nAt the end of step 4.1.4, place internal organs back into the abdominal cavity.\nClose the incision as described in 4.2.7.\n6. Post-operational Care and Monitoring\nAfter the surgical procedure is complete, place the mouse in the recovery area. This consists of a cage placed on a heating pad and lined with flat paper bedding in order to maintain normal body temperature.\nProvide nutritional support to avoid post-operative hypoglycemia by moistened food placed on the cage bottom. For this purpose, use standard rodent diet pellets soaked in water until they soften.\nProvide fluid support by the moistened food and provide water ad libitum.\nUse Buprenophine as analgesia (0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 days post-surgery. During the entire experimental, follow up, observe the mice for occurrence of possible signs of infection, including secretion of liquid or pus from the wound, or for physical deterioration characterized by reduction in grooming behavior and activity level, lower appetite and bodyweight loss.",
    "7. Evaluation of Successful PDL and Harvest of PDL Tail and Sham Tail Pancreas\nEuthanize mice by cervical dislocation.\nRe-shave the abdominal region to avoid carry-over of fur.\nOpen the abdominal skin and muscle layer and remove a large area of skin and muscle to obtain good access to the pancreas.\nUsing sterile tweezers or swab, the stomach is retracted superiorly, exposing the spleen and the splenic lobe (the tail region) of the pancreas.\nGently pull out the duodenum and part of the upper jejunum to expose the gastro-duodenal lobe (head region) of the pancreas.\n\tNote: The ligated portion of the PDL pancreas has now reduced in size and has become almost translucent so that islets are visible as small white dots. The head portion of the pancreas is opaque pink and distinct exocrine lobuli can be observed.\nUsing sterile scissors, separate the ligated tail part of the pancreas from the spleen, by cutting along the spleen. Cut loose the connective tissue connecting the tail region of the pancreas to the internal organs.\nCut the PDL tail region right in front of the ligation, excluding the ligature and the tissue immediately adjacent to it from the harvested tissue.\nTo isolate sham tail tissue, follow steps 7.1 through 7.5. Using sterile scissors separate the tail region of the sham pancreas from the spleen by cutting along the spleen. Isolate the tail region by cutting into the neck region of the pancreas and cutting loose the connective tissue connecting the tail pancreas to the internal organs\n\tNote: Both the tail and head region of the sham pancreas are opaque pink, to isolate both parts separately, cut the pancreas in the neck region.\nSubscription Required.
