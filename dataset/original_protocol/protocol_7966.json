  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The following procedure was performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University in St. Louis. See the Table of Materials for details about the reagents, equipment, and animals used in this study.\n1. Adeno-associated virus injection\nNOTE: Labeling of specific cells in the retina can be accomplished in Cre transgenic mouse lines with restricted patterns of expression. This section describes intravitreal delivery of AAV-vectors that encode Cre-dependent expression of a fluorescent protein, thus labeling specific retinal cells. Inject mice (male and female), starting at 4 weeks of age.\nPreparing the micropipette needle\n\t\nUse a micropipette puller to create a borosilicate glass capillary needle. Load a glass capillary in the micropipette puller and perform the Ramp Test, recording the resulting value. Discard the glass capillary used for the Ramp Test.\nPull micropipettes with the following settings: heat: Ramp Test value minus 10; pull: 55; velocity: 65; time: 120; air pressure: 500; air time at start of pull: 20.\n\t\t​NOTE Settings may need to be adjusted for different pullers.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, use a razor blade to cut the tip of the pulled micropipette at the location where the glass tip deflects slightly under force, ~10 mm from the end of the tapered section. Cut at a sharp angle such that the cut produces a beveled tip. Discard blunt tips.\nPreparing injection syringe\n\t\nFit a cut glass micropipette into a 2 cm segment of ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) plastic tubing (0.05\" inner diameter, 0.09\" outer diameter). Connect the other end of this tubing segment to a 20 cm length of EVA tubing (0.02\" inner diameter, 0.06\" outer diameter).",
    "Connect the tubing to a 50 μL glass syringe with a 22 G cemented needle. Remove the plunger from the glass syringe and backfill the syringe and connected tubing with mineral oil using a 25 G syringe needle. Leave 4 mm air space at the tip of the micropipette.\nIntravitreal injection of AAV\n\t\nPerform intravitreal injection with standard aseptic technique, using sterile surgical gloves, clean lab coat, mask, sterile field, and autoclaved instruments according to institutional protocols for survival surgery.\nRemove an aliquot of AAV vector from storage at -80 °C and thaw on ice. After thawing, centrifuge for 10 s at 2,000 × g to remove any air bubbles.\nFollow the anesthesia and controlled substances guidelines of the institutional Animal Studies Committee. Using a 30 G hypodermic needle, perform a 0.1 mL/10 g body weight intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (10 mg/mL ketamine, 1 mg/mL xylazine in saline, effective dose to mouse: 100 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine). Return the mouse to its cage and allow 5 min for anesthesia to take effect.\nUsing a 30 G hypodermic needle, perform a 0.1 mL/10 g body weight subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (0.5 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride).\nTest the depth of anesthesia by confirming loss of corneal reflex and withdrawal reflex to tail and toe pinch. If corneal reflex persists after loss of tail and toe withdrawal reflex, apply a drop of 0.5% proparacaine solution to each eye and wait for 10 s.\nPlace the mouse on its side under the stereomicroscope. Use a mini bulldog hemostatic clamp to grab the skin superior and inferior to the orbit, and secure the clamp at the medial canthus to partially displace the globe up out of the orbit.",
    "Puncture the lateral sclera with the cut micropipette connected to the glass syringe, ~1-2 mm posterior to the limbus. Avoid disturbing the vasculature that runs circumferentially immediately posterior to the limbus. Perform the puncture at an angle perpendicular to the sclera, and slightly retract the micropipette immediately after piercing the sclera to avoid damaging the lens.\nUse the plunger of the glass syringe to withdraw 1-2 μL of vitreous humor, corresponding roughly to the fluid volume intended for injection. Withdraw the micropipette from the eye, and eject the removed vitreous humor.\nFill the tip of the micropipette with 1-2 μL of AAV, leaving ~4 mm of air space between the viral vector and the mineral oil to avoid mixing. Insert the micropipette in the hole in the sclera created by the first puncture, and slowly press the plunger of the glass syringe to inject the viral vector over the course of 20-30 s. Visualize the fluid level of the viral vector in the tip of the micropipette, and be careful to stop injecting before any air enters the eye.\nHold the micropipette in the same position for 10 s, then retract the micropipette. Remove the bulldog hemostatic clamp.\nApply oxytetracycline/polymyxin B antibiotic ophthalmic ointment to the injected eye. Place the mouse on a heating pad, and monitor its recovery from anesthesia (see 3.4.3).\nReturn the mouse to its housing, and perform postoperative care per institutional guidelines. Allow 2-3 weeks for viral-mediated expression of fluorophores before imaging.\n2. Microscope setup\nNOTE: A schematic of the microscope light path is shown in Figure 1.",
    "\"Always-On\" equipment: These instruments should always remain on unless undergoing adjustment or maintenance. Set the high temperature of the laser cooling system to 20.0 °C. Turn on the main power to the ultrafast Ti:Sapphire laser, allow time for completion of system startup processes, and turn the \"Laser Enable\" key to the \"On\" position.\nEmission light path configuration\n\t\nConfigure the fluorescence emission collection path to sample wavelengths using appropriate dichroic and band pass filter sets for the fluorophores of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: In this manuscript, Twitch2b imaging used a filter cube consisting of a 505 long pass dichroic and 480/40 and 535/30 band pass filter pairs. GFP was imaged using a red/green filter cube consisting of a 560 long pass filter with 525/50 and 605/70 band pass filters. Evans Blue was imaged using a 560 short pass filter. Changing emission filters exposes the emission light path to stray room light that could damage photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Ensure PMTs are turned off, and turn off room lights prior to modifying the collection light path as light exposure can adversely affect PMT function.\nStarting up image acquisition\n\tNOTE: Direct exposure to the two-photon laser is hazardous, especially to the eye as far-red light will not induce a blink response. Proper care should be taken to ensure that the laser is closed along the light path, and fail-safes are in place to protect the user from exposure via the eye pieces or emissions from the microscope objective. Users should understand under which conditions the laser will emit from the objective, and take proper precautions not to expose themselves to such hazards.",
    "Turn on the data acquisition device, computer, Pockels cell, microscope and stage controller, mechanical shutter controller, and PMT main power. Keep PMTs in the \"Disabled\" state until ready for image acquisition and shielded from stray light. Open the laser control interface on the computer and image acquisition software. Turn on the laser from the computer interface and ensure mode-locking.\nSet the desired laser wavelength. Ensure that laser light is entering the Pockels Cell by opening the laser shutter, and allow 30 min for laser power to stabilize.\nMeasuring laser power at the objective and setting maximum laser percentage\n\tNOTE: Laser radiation emits from the objective lens during power measurement. Close the microscope enclosure curtain, and wear appropriate eye protection prior to enabling the imaging shutter. Measure laser power at the time of initial system installation to establish the power output curve for each wavelength of interest and monthly thereafter to verify the stability of excitation power.\n\t\nTurn on the optical power meter, and select the measurement wavelength corresponding to the laser wavelength. Place the optical power meter detector on the microscope stage and maneuver it directly under the objective lens in the X-Y dimensions. Using the Z-dimension motorized focus drive, lower the objective lens until the power meter detector is ~1 mm below the objective lens.\nSwitch from epifluorescence illumination to the laser as the microscope excitation light path. Enable the mechanical shutter.\nIn the image acquisition software, start a point scan to open the imaging shutter, and send the laser to the optical power meter. Set the laser power to 100% in the scanning software. Optimize the X-Y and Z positions of the power meter detector until the highest laser power measurement is achieved.",
    "Measure laser power at the objective from 0.1% to 100% on the Pockels Cell, taking measurements at 10% intervals. Record the Pockels Cell percentage corresponding to 45 mW of power at the objective. Set this percentage as the maximum laser power in the image acquisition software.\n\t\t​NOTE: The highest power observed for in vivo mouse retinal imaging without visible damage to the target tissue was 45 mW, as assayed by histological staining two weeks after imaging. Obvious retinal damage is evident after imaging with 55 mW at the objective.\nDisable the imaging shutter and return the excitation light path to epifluorescence.\n3. Preparation of mouse for image acquisition\nAnesthetizing mouse for imaging\n\tNOTE: Ensure proper waste gas scavenging to mitigate exposure to isoflurane. Make sure the exhaust port of the anesthesia induction chamber is connected to a passive scavenging gas filter cannister, and the outlet of the mouse anesthesia nosepiece is connected to an active scavenging gas filter cannister with vacuum provided by a gas evacuation apparatus. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for monitoring the filter canister weight for replacement.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse using the ketamine/xylazine cocktail as described above in step 1.3.3. Alternatively, induce anesthesia via isoflurane inhalation if also using isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia (imaging session > 30 min). Set the small animal anesthesia device to fill the induction chamber with 5% isoflurane mixed with room air at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min. Place the mouse in the induction chamber, and allow 15 s for the mouse to become anesthetized.\nSwitch the isoflurane vaporizer to 0%, and direct the anesthesia flow to the nosepiece. Perform a 5-seconds \"O2 flush\" of the induction chamber. Take the mouse out of the induction chamber, and secure it in the head holder (see section 3.3), attaching the nosepiece.",
    "Use a mixture of 1% isoflurane with room air at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min for maintenance of anesthesia. Monitor respiratory rate at 5-minute intervals throughout anesthesia, adjusting the isoflurane percentage to maintain a respiratory rate of ~60 breaths/min.\n\t\t​NOTE: These settings (% isoflurane, flow rate) can also be used for maintenance of anesthesia induced by the ketamine/xylazine cocktail.\nPupil dilation\n\t\nPrepare a solution of 1% w/v atropine and 2.5% w/v phenylephrine hydrochloride in water. Store the dilator solution at room temperature protected from light.\nUsing a disposable pipette eye dropper, apply a drop of the dilator solution to each eye that will be imaged. Turn off the room lights, and wait 5 min for the pupil to dilate. When the pupil is dilated, blot away the dilator solution with lint-free tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure dilator solution does not enter the nostrils.\nApply a large drop of lubricant eye gel to each eye that will be imaged. If both eyes are to be imaged, apply a small piece of plastic cling film over the eye gel on the non-imaging eye to prevent dehydration. If only imaging one eye, apply lubricant eye ointment to the eye that will not be imaged.\nPositioning mouse for imaging\n\t\nTo secure the mouse in the imaging head holder, rotate the main arm of the head holder until the earpiece bar is tilted at an angle of 60° or more below horizontal. Secure the lower ear canal pin in the inward extended position and the upper ear canal pin in the withdrawn position.",
    "With the mouse facing the bite bar, mount one ear onto the extended lower pin, inserting the pin into the ear canal. Loosen the screw securing the upper ear canal pin, and extend the pin into the other ear canal. Tighten the screw to secure the head.\nSlide the bite bar toward the head of the mouse. Gently elevate the head of the mouse, then lower the maxillary incisors of the mouse into the hole of the bite bar. Retract the bite bar with gentle force to secure the head of the mouse, and secure the bite bar position by tightening the screw.\nIf using isoflurane, slide the nosepiece through its slot onto the bite bar prior to securing the incisors of the mouse. Secure and tighten the bite bar position as in step 3.3.3. Tighten the nosepiece using the two screws on its upper face until it fits snugly on the nose of the mouse, but does not constrict the snout.\nTransfer the mouse, in the head holder, to the microscope stage beneath the objective. Rotate the main arm of the head holder until the pupil of the eye is oriented straight up, in line with the light path (Figure 2).\nPlace a #1.5 coverslip in the compact filter holder, and attach the holder to the microscope stage. Lower the coverslip toward the eye, contacting the lubricant eye gel, such that the coverslip lies horizontally immediately above the cornea (Figure 2). Ensure that the coverslip does not touch the cornea.\n\t\tNOTE: On the microscope, ensure the excitation light path is set to epifluorescence and emission light path is set to eyepiece. Turn on the epifluorescence illuminator at its lowest power and open the illuminator shutter. Choose the epifluorescence illuminator wavelength and fluorescence filter corresponding to the fluorophore being imaged.",
    "Maneuver the stage in the X-Y dimensions and objective in the Z-position using the stage control and motorized focus drive until the widefield excitation light fully covers the cornea. Looking through the eyepiece, continue to adjust the Z-position of the stage until the fluorescent cells or structures in the retina come into focus. Increase epifluorescence illuminator power if the sample signal is insufficiently bright to resolve individual cells or structures of interest through the eyepiece.\n\t\tNOTE: If having trouble locating the retina, the iris is a high contrast landmark to anchor on and then focus down toward the retina. This step will also allow verification that the pupil is maximally dilated.\nObtain an imaging area on axis with the mouse lens. Adjust the angle of the mouse using the various degrees of freedom on the head holder until only expansion or contraction of out-of-focus light occurs when adjusting the focal plane. Turn off the epifluorescence illuminator and close the illuminator shutter.\n\t\tNOTE: Significant X-Y parallax of out-of-focus light while scrolling through the Z-direction focal planes indicates that the retina is not on axis with respect to the imaging light path.\n4. Two-photon image acquisition\nImage setup and acquisition parameters\n\t​NOTE: Turn off room lights, and cover stray light sources in the room. Ensure the epifluorescence illuminator is off, and the illuminator shutter is closed.\n\t\nSwitch the excitation light path to the laser and emission light path to the PMTs.\nIn the image acquisition software, set a frame size of 512 x 512 and frame average of 3. Set the steps per slice to -8 µm. Designate z-stepping to start at the top of the stack and progress downward, minimizing two-photon laser activation of photoreceptors.",
    "​NOTE: The step size can be reduced to increase Z-resolution at a cost of increased imaging time, but 8 µm steps are sufficient to resolve cell somata in this imaging configuration.\nTurn on and enable the PMTs. Adjust the PMT voltage to 680 V. Enable the excitation shutter.\n\t\t​NOTE: Powered PMTs are susceptible to light damage. Ensure that the epifluorescence illuminator is off, the microscope enclosure curtain is drawn, and room lights are off.\nBegin a live image preview of the target tissue, starting with 1% laser power. Auto adjust the display brightness to visualize the cells or structures of interest. Auto adjust the scan phase. If the target tissue is dim or unclear, increase the laser power percentage until structures become visible without surpassing the limit set in step 2.4.4 corresponding to 45 mW.\n\t\t​NOTE: For a 16-bit image, a display value of ~1000 when auto adjusting brightness in a Z-plane containing structures of interest indicates sufficient brightness of the sample.\nManeuver the microscope stage in the X-Y direction to center on a desired imaging area, then navigate to the Z-plane with the structures of interest in focus.\n\t\t​NOTE: Imaging adjacent to the optic nerve head allows it to serve as an unambiguous landmark for chronic imaging experiments.\nIf this is a chronic time-lapse experiment, have a previous image open on the acquisition computer, and use it as a reference to find the same area of interest. Ensure that the angle of imaging is similar to that of previous images to acquire the same set of cells with minimal parallax.\n\t\tNOTE: Further adjustment of the mouse head position is likely required to image the same cells as in previous time points (Figure 3).",
    "Set the Z-limits of the imaging stack by navigating to the uppermost and lowermost Z-planes of interest, and acquire the image. Upon completion of image acquisition, disable the PMTs and the emission shutter. Switch the emission light path back to the eyepiece, and the excitation light path to epifluorescence illumination. Remove the mouse from the microscope stage.\nSystem software and hardware shutdown\n\t\nExit the image acquisition software. Turn off the laser in the computer interface. Shut down hardware in reverse startup order, with the exception of the \"Always-On\" Equipment.\nMouse recovery\n\t\nRemove the head holder and mouse from the microscope stage. If applicable, set the isoflurane vaporizer to 0%. Remove the mouse from the head holder.\nGently wipe off lubricant eye gel with a lint-free tissue, and apply white petrolatum-mineral oil lubricant eye ointment to both eyes. Place the mouse on the warm water circulating heating pad (set at 37 °C), continue attending to the mouse and monitoring its respiratory rate until the mouse wakes up and regains ambulatory capacity. Return the mouse to its housing.\nIf applicable, assess animal activity and morbidity at 24 h post intravitreal injection. Upon completion of the study, euthanize the mouse with an overdose of tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg) and perform transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde to preserve retinal tissue.\n5. Image processing and analysis\nDeinterleave and merge multichannel data\n\t\nAs certain image acquisition software programs store multichannel images in an interleaved format, open the .tif image file using software, such as Fiji (https://imagej.net/Fiji), to separate the channels.\nIn the Image menu of Fiji, select Stacks | Tools | Deinterleave. Input the number of channels composing the image and click OK.",
    "To merge the separated channels into a single file, go to Image | Color | Merge Channels. Place the deinterleaved image channels into separate color channels, and click OK to create the multichannel composite image. Save this composite image as a new .tif file.\nQuantification of fluorescence intensity in multichannel images\n\t​NOTE: Fluorescence intensity within designated regions of interest (ROIs) can be quantified in single-image planes using Fiji. Quantification of ratiometric readouts can be achieved by measuring the fluorescence intensity in different channels of a composite image within the same ROI. For chronic imaging experiments, it is best to use biosensors based on excitation or emission ratiometric outputs.\n\t\nIn Fiji, go to Analyze | Tools | ROI Manager. Open the composite image in Fiji. Scroll to the z-slice corresponding to the structure of interest, and use the Selection tools (such as Rectangle selection, Oval selection, Polygon selection) to outline the ROIs.\nPress T on the keyboard to add each selection to the ROI Manager. Upon completion of ROI selection, click on Measure in the ROI Manager to record various data from the ROIs such as Area and Mean Intensity value.\nCopy the measurements for the currently selected channel recorded in the Results window to a spreadsheet. Switch to the next Channel in the Composite image window and click on Measure to obtain measurements for that channel within the same set of ROIs. Within the ROI Manager, go to More | Save, and save the ROIs as a .zip file.\nMaximum intensity projections for display\n\t\nTo create displays of the image data, use the Z-project function in Fiji. In the Image menu, select Stack | Z project. Choose only the frames within which areas of interest are present to reduce the background.",
    "If removal of PMT shot noise is desired, use the Median filter function. In the Process menu, select Process | Filters | Median. Choose a value of 1.0 to maintain spatial details.\nTo create maximum-intensity projections focused on single cells, repeat this process choosing only the image frames that correspond to the cell of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: This can greatly improve the ability to resolve cellular arbors (Figure 4). Measurements of fluorescence intensity should be performed in single-image planes and not on maximum intensity projections."
