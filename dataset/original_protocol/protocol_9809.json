    "NOTE: Perform all biological reactions in a biosafety cabinet.\n1. Magnetic platform fabrication\nLithography\n\t\nCut glass slides into 2 x 2 cm2 using a scriber pen. Clean the glass slides in acetone and then isopropanol for 5 min each in an ultra-sonication bath. Dry with ultra-high purity (UHP) nitrogen.\nCoat the glass with photoresist using spin-coating at 6,000 rpm for 60 s, to attain 1.5 µm thickness, and bake at 100 °C for 60 s. Expose the sample to a light source, using an appropriate wavelength for photoresist, with a desired pattern, using a photomask or mask-less lithography.\nDevelop for 40 s in a developer, diluted in distilled water (DW) according to the manufacturer's instructions; wash in DW for 45 s, and dry with UHP nitrogen gas. Inspect the pattern under an optical microscope.\nSputter deposition\n\t\nInsert the sample into the main chamber of the deposition system and wait for base pressure (~5 × 10-8 Torr). Open the gas flow; set the argon flow for standard sputtering (28 sccm [standard cubic cm per min) herein. Ignite the sputter targets, then set the sputter pressure to 3 mTorr.\nIncrease the power on each target until the desired rate is achieved.\n\t\t​NOTE: Pd Rate: 0.62 A/s = 1.0 nm in 16 s; Co80Fe20 Rate: 0.32 A/s, 0.2 nm in 6.25 s.\nTurn on rotation. Deposit the FM multilayer, alternating between the Co80Fe20 and Pd targets, by opening and closing the target shutters, respectively. Deposit 14 bilayers of Co80Fe20 (0.2 nm)/Pd (1.0 nm), and finish with an additional 2 nm Pd capping layer.\nLift-off: Soak the sample in acetone for 30 min, and rinse with isopropanol. Then, dry with UHP nitrogen, and keep the sample in a clean and dry environment until use.\n2. Characterization of magnetic device via transport measurements",
    "Use a Si substrate or glass slide with a cross-shaped magnetic bar of 100 µm width, deposited with FM multilayers (see Figure 1C inset). Attach the sample to the holder using double-sided tape.\nUsing a wire bonder, bond 4 wires to the sample, one on each leg of the cross electrode. Set the sample-holder and sample inside the transport measurement system with a magnetic field so that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the sample. Perform measurements at room temperature.\nPerform transverse voltage (VT) measurement of the device; follow the markings in Figure 1C (inset): apply a current of 1 mA between contacts 1 and 3; measure the VT between contacts 2 and 4; then, apply a current between 2 and 4, and measure the voltage between 1 and 3. Finally, calculate the difference between the voltages of both the measurements and divide by 2 to obtain VT. Use a switching system to automatically change between the two measurement configurations.\nSweep the magnetic field between 0.4 T to -0.4 T in steps of 5 mT and measure the VT as a function of the field. Plot the transverse resistance (VT/I) vs. the magnetic field to determine the anomalous Hall signal, which is proportional to the perpendicular magnetization in the film.\n3. Characterization of MNPs and magnetic multilayers by magnetometry measurements\nMagnetometric measurement for FM multilayers\n\t\nDeposit the FM multilayer on the Si substrate (see section 1.2). Cut the sample into 6 squares of 4 x 4 mm2 size. Stack the samples one on top of the other and arrange them in the capsule perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field (see Figure 1D inset).\nInsert the capsule into the magnetometer and measure the magnetization at room temperature. Sweep the magnetic field between -0.4 T and 0.4 T.",
    "Calculate the total volume of the magnetic material, considering the thickness of the magnetic layer, the size of the samples, and the number of substrates. Divide the magnetization by the total volume of the magnetic material.\nPlot the magnetization (per unit volume) vs. the magnetic field. Subtract the diamagnetic background of the substrate from the high magnetic field response and extrapolate the saturation magnetization of the FM from the graph.\nMagnetometric measurement for MNPs\n\t\nInsert a designated mass of MNPs into a synthetic polymer capsule. Consider a larger volume if measuring small magnetization saturation values.\nIf the MNPs are suspended in a solvent, dry the MNPs by leaving the capsule open overnight. Insert the capsule into the magnetometer and measure the magnetization at room temperature. Sweep the magnetic field between -0.2 T and 0.2 T.\nCalculate the total mass of the MNPs by multiplying the designated volume by the particle concentration. Normalize the results to 1 g.\nPlot the normalized magnetization (per gram) vs. the magnetic field. Extrapolate the magnetization saturation of the MNPs from the graph.\n4.

Place 1.5 mL of the diluted solution in a 35 mm culture dish. Leave the dish in the hood for 1 h, covered.\nRemove the solution, and wash 3x in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The dish is ready for cell seeding.\nCoating glass slides",
    "Dilute collagen type 1 (solution from rat tail) 1:50 in 30% v/v ethanol.
