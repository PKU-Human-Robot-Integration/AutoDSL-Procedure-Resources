    "For the results presented here, venous human blood was drawn to form clots after approval from the local internal review board (IRB #19-1300) and written informed consent provided by volunteer donors24. This section outlines a design protocol to assess lysotripsy efficacy. The protocol is based on a previous work by Bollen et al.24.\n1. Clot modeling\nNOTE: Prepare the clots within 2 weeks but more than 3 days prior to the day of the experiment to ensure clot stability and maximize retraction28. Prepare the clot following the approval from local institutional review board.\nPrepare borosilicate Pasteur pipette for storing the blood (see Table of Materials for specifications of the pipette). Borosilicate tubes are used because of the hydrophilic nature of the material which promotes platelet activation and clot retraction29. Seal the tip of the pipette via heating over a Bunsen burner.\nDraw fresh human venous blood. Aliquot the total blood drawn in 2 mL increments per desired clot. Transfer each 2 mL aliquot to one Pasteur pipette.\n\tNOTE: Execute step 1.2 within approximately 3 min of blood draw so that blood does not clot before transferring to pipettes. Also, ensure the volunteer donor is not on any medications that may alter the clotting cascade (e.g. blood thinners or platelet inhibitors).\nIncubate the blood aliquots within the pipettes (equal to the number of clots required) in a water bath for 3 h at 37 °C.\nStore the pipettes for a minimum of 3 days at 4 °C to allow for retraction of clots28. As the clots retract, serum will be observed to accumulate at the top of the clot within the pipette. The rt-PA response of clots remains stable for 2 weeks following retraction28.\n2. Water tank preparation",
    "Fill the water tank with reverse osmosis water. Line the bottom surface of the tank with an acoustic absorbing material to reduce reflection of the therapy or imaging ultrasound pulses. Use a water handling system to degas and filter the water to minimize bubble nuclei.\n\tNOTE: One way to filter the water is using an inline filter. The specifications of the bag used for generating the representative results is given in the Table of Materials.\nPlace two heating elements at the bottom surface of the tank. Heat the water to 37.3 ˚C to achieve the maximum lytic enzymatic activity30.\nSetup a flow channel as shown in Figure 1A. The flow channel consists of tubing, a model vessel with material and geometric properties representative of an iliofemoral vein, a reservoir for plasma, and a syringe on the distal most end of the reservoir (Table of Materials). The syringe is connected to a pump to regulate a flow through the channel during the experiment.\nManually submerge the flow channel in the water tank to bring the channel to physiologic temperature during the degassing/filtering/heating stage (steps 2.1 and 2.2).\n3. Preparation of plasma and rt-PA mixture\nPrior to experiment day\n\t​NOTE: When stored at -80 °C, plasma is stable for at least 2.5 years31 and rt-PA is stable for at least 7 years32. Therefore, execute step 3.1 anytime within these periods to ensure stability of the two components.\n\t\nDilute the rt-PA obtained from a manufacturer in powdered form to 1 mg/mL in sterile water.\nAliquot 100 µL of diluted rt-PA into 0.5 mL centrifuge tubes and store them at -80 °C.\nAliquot 35 mL of human fresh-frozen type O plasma in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Store the tubes at -80 °C.\nOn the experiment day",
    "Retrieve plasma aliquots from the freezer. Retrieve as many aliquots as the number of clots to be tested that day. Immerse the frozen aliquots in a water bath at 37 °C to thaw (~10 min).\nOnce plasma has thawed, pour it into a beaker that is triply rinsed with ultrapure water. Lightly cover the mouth of the beaker with aluminum foil to prevent contamination and place the beaker in the water bath. Allow the foil to be loose enough to allow air to contact the plasma.\nLet plasma equilibrate at 37 °C to atmospheric pressure for at least 2 h.\nTake out the frozen rt-PA vials and place on ice until needed, with one vial for each experiment run.\nMake low gelling agarose (2%) in a 50 mL flask, by dissolving agarose in ultrapure water. Choose the total amount of agarose solution such that approximately 2 mL is available for each specimen to be analyzed. Heat the solution in flask in a microwave until bubbly. Secure the flask with a waterproof screw lid on it. Submerge the flask in the water bath alongside the plasma.\n\t\t​NOTE: This step ensures agarose is available to secure exposed clot segments for histology analysis following histotripsy insonation.\n4. Setting up histotripsy source and imaging array\nEnsure the motorized positioners can be controlled from the runtime environment of a programming platform, using directions and commands provided by the manufacturer. Check that the motors of the system are connected to the appropriate port of the computer with the runtime environment.\nMount the histotripsy source on the motorized positioning system as shown in Figure 1B.\nConnect the histotripsy source to its driving electronics (e.g., power amplifier and function generator) via the appropriate connectors (e.g., BNC cables) as specified by the manufacturer.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the driving electronics of the histotripsy source can be controlled via the runtime environment used in step 4.1.\nCover the imaging array with a probe cover and affix the array coaxially in the aperture of the histotripsy source as shown in Figure 2. Be sure to understand the orientation of the imaging plane relative to the orientation of the histotripsy source.\nConnect the imaging array to an ultrasound scanning system. Ensure that this system can control the operation and triggering of the imaging array, and collect imaging data, as per the commands provided by the manufacturer of the scanner.\nSubmerge the histotripsy source/imaging array into the tank while degassing as shown in Figure 1A. Gently remove any air bubbles using a syringe from the surface of the histotripsy source or imaging array.\n\tNOTE: Immerse the histotripsy source and imaging array completely in water before operation. Avoid touching the surface of the histotripsy source.\nAcquire B-mode images at a rate of 20 frames per second using the imaging array and the built-in commands of the scanner. Adjust the imaging window to ensure visualization of the focus of the histotripsy source in these real-time images.\n\tNOTE: It is assumed that the dimensions of the focal region of the therapeutic source are known.\nSet the operating parameters of the histotripsy source, including fundamental frequency (e.g., 1.5 MHz), pulse repetition frequency (e.g., 20-100 Hz), pulse duration (e.g., 1-20 cycles per pulse), and total number of pulses per location (e.g., 100-2,000)18,23,24,33. Modify these parameters if sufficient clot lysis is not achieved or if the bubble activity extends beyond the lumen of the model vessel. To set these parameters, use the protocol provided by the manufacturer of the source or use a programming platform that can communicate with the source (Step 4.3).",
    "Using the manufacturer's protocol or programming platform used in step 4.8, run the histotripsy source at the set parameters in degassed water only, without any obstruction in the surrounding environment. Increase the voltage applied to the histotripsy source until a bubble cloud is formed.\nUsing the real-time imaging of step 4.7, adjust the position of the imaging array inside the confocal transducer opening until the bubble cloud is located approximately at the center of the image window. The bubble cloud is the region of hyperechoic pixels in the imaging plane (Figure 3). Tighten the screws to hold the imaging array firmly in the transducer opening.\n\tNOTE: If the array is aligned properly, the azimuthal position of the bubble cloud should be approximately at 0 mm in the imaging plane. The imaging array may project slightly from the inner surface of the therapy source, and therefore the range position of the bubble cloud may differ from the focal length of the source.\nIdentify the bubble cloud location in the imaging plane. Assign the focus of the histotripsy source as the center of the bubble cloud (Figure 3).\nRecord the detected focal location (step 4.11) in the imaging window (Figure 3). A possible way to mark the focal position is placing a cursor to note the location in the imaging window, if available with the imaging platform.\nDiscontinue insonation and set the voltage applied to the histotripsy source to 0 V.\n5. Clot preparation\nRemove the clot from the pipette by cutting the sealed end with pliers. Let the clot slide into a Petri dish along with the serum. If the clot does not dislodge, gently apply pressure from the other end of the pipette via saline flush to remove the clot.",
    "Cut the clot to 1 cm length using a scalpel, aiming for a uniform piece from the center (i.e., away from sections of the clot formed at the top or bottom of the pipette).\nUse a cleaning wipe to blot the cut section of the clot gently to remove excess fluid.\nUsing tweezers, place the clot section gently on a weighing scale and record the weight.\nManually raise the flow channel out of the water tank and remove the model vessel from the flow channel.\nPlace the clot in the model vessel using tweezers and attach the model vessel again to the flow channel.\n\tNOTE: A nylon rod can be placed within the model vessel to prevent the clot from moving downstream due to the flow.\nLower the flow channel into the tank in such a way that the proximal end of the stage relative to the reservoir is low compared to the distal side. The angling of the stage in this manner prevents trapping of bubbles in the model vessel when plasma is drawn through the flow channel in step 6.1.\nAdd 30 mL of plasma to the reservoir using a pipette and monitor the temperature until it reaches at least 36 °C.\nUse a pipette to dispense the rt-PA (80.4 µg in 30 mL of plasma, 2.68 µg/mL) into the plasma reservoir. Stir the plasma with the pipette to ensure a uniform rt-PA distribution within the reservoir.\n6. Priming the flow channel\nDraw plasma into the flow channel from the reservoir via the syringe pump until the plasma fills the model vessel.",
    "NOTE: If the clot is not flush with the nylon rod, use short pump draws at 60 mL/min to try to force the plasma downstream the clot or manually draw through the syringe. Limit the amount of plasma drawn in this process or refill the reservoir using additional plasma/rt-PA to ensure 30 mL of solution in the flow channel.\nUsing the motorized positioners, align the imaging array parallel to the length of the clot using the imaging script (step 4.7). The parallel alignment enables the user to visually ensure proper placement of the clot and absence of bubbles inside the model vessel.\nLevel the model vessel manually and visually ensure that no air bubbles are present using the imaging window (step 4.7).\n7. Experiment procedure\nPre-treatment\n\t​NOTE: This step is to plan a path for the histotripsy source/imaging array for uniform histotripsy exposure along clot length.\n\t\nAlign the imaging array using the motorized positioners such that the imaging plane is parallel to the cross-section of the clot (i.e., perpendicular to the orientation described in step 6.2).\nUnder guidance via the imaging window (step 4.7), move the histotripsy source to the proximal end of the clot relative to the reservoir using the motorized positioners. At this point, adjust the histotripsy source position such that the marked focal point in step 4.12 aligns with the center of the clot.",
    "Determine the insonation path along the clot length. To define this path, set three waypoints along the length of the clot (i.e., positions of the motors where histotripsy bubble activity is contained within the clot) in 5 mm increments. Align the waypoints such that the overall motion of the histotripsy source along the path is antegrade with flow in the system (i.e., the first waypoint is at the most proximal end of the clot relative to the reservoir, and the third waypoint is in the distal position relative to the reservoir).\nPrior to finalizing each waypoint, fire test pulses from the histotripsy source with the same insonation parameters as step 4.8 but reduce the overall exposure to 10 total pulses. Adjust the position of the histotripsy source using the motorized positioners if necessary, to contain bubble activity within the clot.\nAt each waypoint, save the motor positions using the commands provided by the manufacturer, similar to the step 4.1.\nTreatment\n\t​NOTE: This step defines the procedure to treat the clot along its length according to the path defined in the pre-treatment step.\n\t\nRun the syringe pump at 0.65 mL/min and wait for meniscus of the plasma to move. This flow rate mimics a near total occlusion of the iliofemoral vasculature24,34.\nInterpolate the path created in step 7.1.3 with intermediate steps between the established waypoints with a fixed step size (e.g., 0.5 mm). The step size is chosen to be smaller than half the width of the focal region as measured along the clot length (elevational direction of the imaging array). Move the histotripsy source using motorized positioners at each path location with insonation parameters defined in step 4.8.",
    "Monitor/image bubble activity during application of the histotripsy pulse at each path location using the imaging window (step 4.7). Center the image on the histotripsy focus with the image dimensions covering 15 mm in the azimuth and range. Prior to the application of histotripsy pulse at each location, acquire a B-mode image to provide visualization of the clot and model vessel, by creating a script in a programming platform. Ensure the script establishes communication with the scanner using the manufacturer's commands.\nDuring the application of the histotripsy pulse, implement the acquisition of acoustic emissions in the script in step 7.2.3 to form passive cavitation images post hoc35. Acquire one passive cavitation image after every 10 treatment pulses. Apply a flat time gain compensation of 50 at 8 incremental depths till the end of the imaging depth. Choose an appropriate acquisition window size such that the entire signal from the clot is captured with minimum loss of energy due to windowing35.\nIf off-target bubble clouds are present, adjust the transducer position in situ with the motorized positioners.\n\t\t​NOTE: Monitor for missed triggers of the imaging array. Adjust the number of acquired imaging data sets to ensure the storage of data is completed before subsequent triggering.\n8. Post experiment procedure\nManually raise the model vessel out of the water tank to drain the perfusate via gravity. Be sure to keep the flow channel levelled to prevent the clot from moving downstream and out of the model vessel during draining.\nCollect the entire perfusate for further analysis in a small beaker (Figure 4A) by drawing plasma solution from the flow channel through the syringe pump at a very low flow rate.",
    "Disconnect the model vessel and remove the clot. If necessary, inject a small amount of saline into the model vessel to gently dislodge the clot.\nWipe the clot similar to step 1.2.3. Weigh the clot on the weighing scale for assessing the clot mass loss.\nTo analyze the D-dimer content, add 100 mg of aminocaproic acid to a microcentrifuge tube followed by 1 mL of perfusate, and mix well using a pipette. Perform a latex immune-turbidimetric assay to quantify the D-dimer within the sample36.\nTo assess hemolysis, add 1 mL of perfusate to centrifuge tubes and spin at 610 x g (3,500 rpm) for 10 min. Combine 0.5 mL of supernatant (concentrate) with 0.5 mL of Drabkins solution and let the mixture rest at room temperature for 15 min. Transfer 200 µL to well plates, as shown in Figure 4B. Use a plate reader to read absorbance at 540 nm, Figure 4C (Drabkins assay37).\nHistology assessment\n\t\nCut a section from the center of the clot of about 2-3 mm in length with a scalpel.\nAdd the section to a cassette. Maintain orientation of the section relative to the direction of histotripsy pulse propagation.\nAdd 2 mL of low gelling agarose solution prepared in step 3.2.5 into the cassette to fix the clot in place.\nFix the sample in 10% formalin for 24 h. Place the sample in 70% alcohol after 24 h and perform standard hemotoxylin-eosin staining38.\n9. Passive cavitation image analysis\nProcess the signals acquired from the imaging array during the histotripsy excitation (step 7.2.4) using an algorithm based on the robust Capon beamformer39 to create an image of acoustic emissions generated by the bubble cloud at each treatment location.",
    "NOTE: To generate quantitative images, follow the steps described in Haworth et al.35. Otherwise, each pixel value in the image should represent the relative bubble cloud acoustic energy (units of V2) at each corresponding location.\nSegment the B-mode image aquired in steps 7.2.3 to distinguish between the pixels representing clot and the model vessel.\nCo-register the passive cavitation image with the B-mode image as shown in Figure 5B. Sum up the acoustic energy within the clot over the exposure period35.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
