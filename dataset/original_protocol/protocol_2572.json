The nuclei isolation protocol is adapted from a previous study9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and optimized specifically for the purpose of extracting a large number of high-quality nuclei in a single preparation to satisfy the requirement of sci-RNA-seq3.\nPrepare materials and equipment for nuclei extraction.\nPrepare NLB1 buffer with recipe provided below. Place the buffer on ice.\nAdd one tablet of cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (EDTA-free) to 10 mL Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer.\nEnsure the tablet is completely dissolved by gentle vortex at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10–15 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_6.csv\nNote: Extra protease inhibitor-supplemented Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer can be saved at −20°C for future use.\nPrepare NLB2 buffer with recipe provided below. Place the buffer on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_7.csv\nClean the dounce tissue grinder, as well as the large and small grinder pestles, with RNaseZap Decontamination Solution and wash the grinder with RNase-free water.\nPrepare Nuclei Isolation Buffer (NIB) with recipe provided below. Place the buffer on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_8.csv\nNote: We recommend NIB to be freshly prepared at each time of use, though Nuclei Buffer can be prepared ahead.\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and place it on ice.\nPFA should be diluted with Nuclei Buffer if the stock concentration is over 4%.\nCritical: PFA reacts violently with strong oxidizers. Avoid inhalation and skin contact. Dispose unused PFA following proper hazardous waste procedures.",
    "Precool a 6-cm dish, a razor blade, a 200-μm cell strainer, a 40-μm cell strainer and several 15-mL and 50-mL centrifuge tubes in the 4°C cold room.\nCritical: Kidney is a RNase-rich tissue and reduced library quality can be observed if RNA degradation occurs. Thus, the nuclei isolation experiment should be conducted in a 4°C cold room and it is important to ensure all reagents and equipment are pre-prepared to reduce the amount of time needed for tissue homogenization after the tissue is thawed. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A presents reagents and equipment that should be cleaned, pre-prepared and precooled in the 4°C cold room.\nTissue homogenization and cell lysis (all procedures at 4°C).\nThaw the kidney tissue (> 100 mg) stored at −80°C and immediately transfer the tissue onto the 6-cm dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd 2 mL NLB1 to the dish and keep the tissue exposed to NLB1.\nMince the tissue thoroughly with a razor blade and avoid big chunks of tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nThis step can take 2–5 min.\nTransfer 1–1.5 mL tissue suspension into the dounce grinder.\nMove the small grinder pestle (loose pestle) up and down for 15 times to induce cell dissociation.\nTransfer homogenates in the dounce grinder onto a 200-μm cell strainer which is laid on a 50-mL centrifuge tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nFibrotic kidney tissues, such as tissues harvested from the unilateral ureteral obstruction model, can require more times of grinding (20–25 times).\nRepeat this step until all tissue suspension in the 6-cm dish generated in step 2.c is processed for the dounce grinder.\nTransfer 1–1.5 mL filtered homogenates in the 50-mL tube (obtained in step 2.e) back into the dounce grinder.\nSlowly press the large grinder pestle (tight pestle) up and down for 5 times to induce further nuclear dissociation.",
    "Transfer the nuclei suspension to a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd another 1 mL NLB1. Incubate for 5 min.\nRepeat this step until all homogenates generated in step 2.e are processed for the dounce grinder.\nFilter the nuclei suspension with the 40-μm cell strainer.\nTransfer the filtered nuclei suspension into a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nSpin down the nuclei by centrifugation at 500 g for 4 min at 4°C. A representative picture of the nuclei pellet is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C.\nNote: A refrigerated centrifuge with a swinging bucket should be used to increase the nuclei yield.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the nuclei pellet with 1.5 mL NLB2 by pipetting 10 times.\nMix the nuclei suspension with the rest of NLB2 and incubate for 5 min.\nSpin down the nuclei by centrifugation at 500 g for 4 min at 4°C. A representative picture of the nuclei pellet is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C.\nThen, remove supernatant thoroughly and resuspend the nuclei with 2 mL NIB.\nNote: The number of fresh nuclei can be counted at this point. At least 15 million nuclei can be extracted from a kidney tissue of 100 mg.\nNote: Count the number of nuclei with either an automated cell counter or a hemacytometer. We usually use an automated cell counter (e.g., Countess II Automated Cell Counter) because it is more efficient in processing multiple samples. A representative snapshot of nuclei counting with the Countess Cell Counter at this step is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D, where nuclei are stained with Trypan Blue following the manufacture’s instruction[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/BID/manuals/MAN0014293_Countess_II_Automated_Cell_Counter_UG.pdf] and the majority of nuclei are marked as “Dead” cells with this instrument.\nNuclei fixation and preservation.\nAdd 3 mL ice-cold 4% PFA to the 2 mL nuclei suspension for a final concentration of 2.4%.\nMix thoroughly by inverting the tube for 3 times.",
    "Fix the nuclei on ice for 10 min.\nSpin down the fixed nuclei by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nWe may observe the nuclei pellet with a larger size (compared with the nuclei pellet obtained in previous steps) due to reduced nuclei density after fixation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRemove supernatant and wash with 2 mL NIB.\nResuspend the nuclei pellet with 300 μL NIB.\nCount the number of nuclei.\nNote: PFA fixation in step 3.b and buffer washes in step 3.c can cause 10%–20% nuclei loss at each step. Thus, we may observe over 40% of cell loss at step 3.e compared to the fresh nuclei obtained at step 2.l. With a kidney tissue over 100 mg, we typically obtain at least 8 million fixed nuclei at this point.\nDilute the nuclei with NIB to a final concentration of 5–10 million/mL.\nAliquot the nuclei suspension to several cryogenic tubes with 300 μL materials per tube.\nPause point: Flash freeze the nuclei suspension with liquid nitrogen. Store the sample in a liquid nitrogen tank for future sci-RNA-seq3 processing.\nCritical: A pause point is needed to collect samples from multiple mouse kidneys and process them together in sci-RNA-seq3 of the next section. This is the only pause point (i.e., after fixation and before permeabilization in step 5) we can include before starting the sci-RNA-seq3 experiment. Compared to processing fresh and unfixed nuclei, freezing nuclei after PFA fixation can offer comparable library quality. On the other hand, we found that freezing nuclei after permeabilization caused significant ribosomal RNA contamination and reduced library quality, as presented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2205-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of mouse kidney nuclei isolation and fixation procedures",
    "(A) Before performing nuclei isolation on the mouse kidney tissue, all reagents and equipment should be prepared ahead and precooled in a 4°C cold room. This includes: (1) a 6-cm dish, (2) buffers of NLB1, NLB2, NIB and 4% PFA, (3) a 200-μm cell strainer and a 40-μm cell strainer, assembled on 50-mL tubes, (4) a tissue dounce homogenizer and the large and small pestles, and (5) supplies such as a razor blade, a timer and a marker pen. We also assume that common laboratory supplies, including a P1000 pipette, 1,250-μL pipet tips and tube racks, are available at the 4°C cold room.\n(B) A frozen mouse kidney tissue is transferred onto a 6-cm dish (left panel) and minced with a razor blade in the NLB1 buffer.\n(C) Representative pictures of nuclei pellets at specific steps, in the same experiment processing the tissue presented in (B). At step 2.h, the supernatant contains tissue lysates. At step 2.k, the supernatant becomes clear. Fixation can reduce the density of nuclei, and therefore, a large size of nuclei pellet may be observed at step 3.c.\n(D) A representative Countess II Automated Cell Counter profile which counts the concentration of fresh nuclei obtained the end of step 2, in the same experiment processing the tissue presented in (B). In this case, we obtained 2 mL fresh nuclei suspension with concentration over 15 million/mL, and therefore, over 30 million nuclei were isolated.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2205-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Quality of sci-RNA-seq3 libraries with different pause point settings",
    "The proportion of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads of three sci-RNA-seq3 libraries. In the first library, nuclei were not fixed and processed directly for subsequent reactions (steps 4–14). In the second library, nuclei were fixed and then frozen in liquid nitrogen following procedures of step 3. In the third library, nuclei were fixed and permeabilized right after fixation (steps 3 and 5) and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The three libraries were generated from pilot experiments as proposed in step 15.\nReverse transcription and hairpin ligation of sci-RNA-seq3\nTiming: 1 day\nHere we will process the fixed and permeabilized nuclei from multiple mouse kidney samples for reverse transcription and hairpin ligation of sci-RNA-seq3. This protocol is adapted from the original sci-RNA-seq publication2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and includes modifications in nuclei permeabilization and sonication and described in more detail.\nNote: Before you start this section, make sure you have prepared the oligo plates as mentioned in ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ and obtained fixed nuclei from all samples in your study cohort following steps 1–3 in ‘nuclei extraction from mouse kidneys and fixation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]’.\nNote: A large number of samples may be processed simultaneously in this section, and therefore, previewing this protocol and labeling tubes with sample identifications ahead of the experiment are recommended.\nBuffer preparation.\nPrepare 35 mL NIB with recipe provided below.

    "For each sample, transfer the nuclei suspension into a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nSpin down the nuclei of all samples by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend the nuclei thoroughly with 100 μL NIB and add 400 μL permeabilization buffer to each sample.\nIncubate the mix on ice for 5 min.\nSpin down the nuclei by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 250 μL NIB and transfer the nuclei suspension to a 1.5 mL tube for each sample.\nPlace the 1.5 mL tubes in a Bioruptor Pico Sonication device and perform sonication for 10 s.\nFor each sample, filter the nuclei suspension through a 40-μm Flowmi cell strainer and place the sample on ice. Please refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use of a Flowmi cell strainer: https://www.belart.com/media/catalogstudio/Instructions/913680015.pdf[href=https://www.belart.com/media/catalogstudio/Instructions/913680015.pdf]\nCritical: Permeabilization of fixed nuclei can cause significant nuclei clumping. Performing light sonication at step 5.h is critical to break up these nuclei aggregates and reduce nuclei loss in the subsequent filtration step 5.i.\nMeasure and record the concentration of nuclei of each sample. Dilute each sample to around 3.6 × 106 nuclei/mL with NIB.\nNote: This will help us to aliquot 80,000 nuclei (in 22 μL suspension) in the next step.\n384-well reverse transcription.\nThaw the four 96-well plates (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) for reverse transcription prepared ahead of time.\nEach well contains 2 μL uniquely indexed RT oligos (100 μM).

    "Critical: The well positions where nuclei from each sample are deposited must be recorded since nuclei from different samples will be indexed with different sets of RT oligos for the purpose of sample hashing. Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] presents an example of depositing nuclei from a total of 16 samples into each of the 384 wells (24 wells per sample). Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] can be combined with Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] to create a “Sample-RT oligo” look-up table for downstream sample demultiplexing in data analysis.\nNote: Add the 80,000 nuclei to the bottom of each well since the plates may not be further centrifuged.\nIncubate the four plates at 55°C for 5 min and immediately place them on ice after incubation.\nPrepare reverse transcription reaction mix with recipe provided below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_12.csv\nDistribute 14 μL reaction mix into each well with a multichannel pipette.\nThe final volume per well is 40 μL.\nStart the reverse transcription reaction with the following program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_13.csv\nPlace the plates on ice and add 60 μL NBB into each well with a multichannel pipette to dilute the nuclei suspension.\nPool the nuclei suspension from all 384 wells together into a reservoir.\nSplit the nuclei suspension into two 50-mL tubes.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C and remove supernatant carefully.\n384-well hairpin ligation.\nThaw the four 96-well plates for hairpin ligation prepared ahead of time.

    "In the above section, two levels of combinatorial indexing have been introduced through reverse transcription (384 barcodes) and hairpin ligation (384 barcodes). A third-level combinatorial indexing will be introduced by indexed PCR in this sub-library generation step. In this section, each sub-library is generated by processing one 96-well plate obtained in step 7.r and introduces 96 unique PCR primer combinations. Therefore, if a number of N sub-libraries are generated in this experiment, the total number of barcode combinations will be: 384×384×96×N.\nThe sub-library generation protocol includes second-strand synthesis, transposase Tn5-based tagmentation, USER (Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent) reaction, indexed PCR and library purification (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2205-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Scheme of sci-RNA-seq3 sub-library generation workflow\nA workflow of sci-RNA-seq3 sub-library generation. All experiments are performed on a 96-well plate before library purification and quantification. The volume per well at each step is labeled.\nIn the tagmentation step, the Tn5 must be pre-loaded with specific oligonucleotides to make functional transposase. To the best of our knowledge, the Tn5 transposome specifically used in the original sci-RNA-seq3 paper is not commercially available, and therefore, we will present a protocol for generating this construct with commercially available naked Tn5 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2205-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

We have validated this protocol on two different sources of naked Tn5 (Diagenode C01070002 and Lucigen TNP92110).\nResuspend lyophilized ME_REV and ME_A oligos with Annealing Buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to a stock concentration of 100 μM.",
    "Critical: Using HPLC-purified oligos for transposome assembly is highly recommended.\nMix 5 μL ME_REV (100 μM) and 10 μL ME_A (100 μM) in a PCR tube.\nBriefly spin down and start the oligo annealing reaction with the following program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_16.csv\nAdd 10 μL naked Tn5 transposase to 12.5 μL annealed oligos generated above.\nMix well and briefly centrifuge the tube.\nIncubate the Tn5-oligo mix at 23°C for 30–40 min.\nOptional: Performing the reaction with gentle shaking (50–300 rpm) on a thermomixer may moderately improve the efficiency of transposome assembly.\nAfter the reaction, supplement the suspension with 12.5 μL glycerol and mix well.\nNote: The loaded transposome can be stored at −20°C for at least a month.\nAlternatives: The Tn5 transposase can also be produced in-house with a published protocol for recombinant protein preparation10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] but it may require a modified protocol for transposome assembly.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] We did not pursue this approach.\nSecond-strand synthesis.\nThaw one 96-well plate generated in step 7.s at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nEach well contains 5 μL nuclei suspension.

    "Critical: The baseline activity of Tn5 varies substantially across different manufacturers or even across different batches from the same manufacturer, and different amounts of DNA inputs may also require different Tn5 doses for tagmentation. Therefore, it is critical to determine the optimal Tn5 concentration of use (working concentration) when generating the first sci-RNA-seq3 sub-library with an activity titration test. An example of implementing the titration test is presented in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].

The final volume for PCR is 40 μL per well, so the final concentration of P5/P7 primers is 0.5 μM.\nCritical: The combination of indexed P5 and P7 primers in a well must be different from the combination of any other wells, including wells of the other plates for generation of the other sub-libraries. For example, if the combination of P5_#1 and P7_#1 is used in generating the first sub-library, this combination cannot not be used for downstream steps when generating the other sub-libraries. A feasible example is to add the 96 uniquely indexed P7 primers into the 96-well plate when generating all sub-libraries, but choose different P5 primers for different sub-libraries, as presented in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].",
    "Optional: Primers with a working concentration (10 μM) can be pre-prepared from stock primers (100 μM).\nAdd 20 μL NEBNext High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix into each well. The recipe of indexed PCR reaction mix is presented below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_20.csv\nBriefly centrifuge the plate and start the PCR reaction with the following program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_21.csv\nNote: A 14-cycle PCR reaction can be used in the Tn5 activity titration test when generating the first sub-library.

In the example of Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], a total of 900–960 μL PCR products can be obtained in each condition. For subsequent sub-library generation, a total of 3,600–3,840 μL PCR products can be obtained.\nLibrary purification and quantification.\nThaw pooled PCR products generated in step 12 and transfer 900 μL to a 2-mL tube.\nNote: The remaining PCR products can be stored at −20°C for troubleshooting.\nPerform library purification with 0.8× Select-a-Size MagBeads.\nAdd 720 μL beads and mix thoroughly.

Add 100 μL Elution buffer and mix with the beads thoroughly.\nIncubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 3–5 min.",
    "Separate the beads by placing the tube on the magnet for 3 min.\nTransfer all supernatant carefully to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nPerform a second-round 0.7× Select-a-Size MagBead purification by adding 70 μL beads and repeat procedures of step 13.b.\nElute the sub-library with 20 μL Elution buffer.\nPause point: The sub-library can be stored at −20°C for several months.\nVisualize the sub-library on a Bioanalyzer or Tapestation instrument (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]). Determine the concentration of the sub-library. The library typically has an average insert at 300–600 bp, with concentration varied between 5–50 nM.\nNext-generation sequencing.\nBalance all sub-libraries to the same molarity to ensure that sequencing power is distributed evenly to each sub-library.\nPool all sub-libraries together and sequence on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Read1-Index1-Index2-Read2: 34-10-10-100 bp). Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] presents an example of pooling 8 sub-libraries with different concentrations.\nNote: A higher number of sub-libraries pooled will result in higher number of cells and will require a higher sequencing power. We typically sequence at least 8 sub-libraries on one flow cell of NovaSeq S4 to increase data throughput.\nOptional: One sub-library can be sequenced on a NextSeq platform (Read1-Index1-Read2: 34-10-46 bp) if we want to briefly check the quality of library before proceeding to a full sequencing depth. Such data can usually be used for standard downstream analysis such as cell clustering. An even lower sequencing depth (e.g., sequencing a sub-library on a MiSeq platform) may also be used if we just want to check the quality of captured reads and whether oligo barcodes are successfully incorporated.\nNote: Please contact the sequencing service center for a recommended final volume and concentration of the pooled library.\nRaw undemultiplexed fastq files should be expected.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2205-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "When processing the first 96-well plate for sci-RNA-seq sub-library generation, four different concentrations of Tn5 transposome are tested, with 24 wells per condition. The working concentration of Tn5 transposome usually varies between 1–50 nM. After steps 10–12, PCR products from 24 wells are pooled together and processed for sub-library generation in step 13. The four sub-libraries are visualized and quantified. The sub-library with highest concentration is chosen and the working concentration of Tn5 transposome is determined and can be used for generation of the other sub-libraries.

However, generating such a large-scale library requires preparation of large amount of experimental materials (e.g., mouse kidney tissues and oligonucleotides) and is not financially efficient for pilot tests. Therefore, in this section, we describe how to generate a small-scale sci-RNA-seq3 library with a total of 10×10×20 barcode combinations to help researchers to reproduce this protocol.\nNuclei isolation from one mouse kidney and sci-RNA-seq3 with reduced scale.\nPerform nuclei isolation and fixation from one mouse kidney tissue following steps 1–3.\nPrepare 4 mL NIB, 4 mL NBB and 400 μL permeabilization buffer at step 4.\nPerform nuclei permeabilization on fixed nuclei generated from the tissue of use following step 5. At least 800,000 nuclei should be retained at the end of this step.\nDistribute the nuclei suspension into 10 wells of a 96-well plate for reverse transcription. Add a uniquely indexed RT oligo into each of the 10 wells. Prepare 154 μL reverse transcription reaction mix and follow the other procedures of step 6 accordingly.",
    "Distribute the nuclei suspension into 10 wells of a 96-well plate for hairpin ligation.\nAdd a uniquely ligation oligo into each of the 10 wells.\nPrepare 231 μL ligation reaction mix and follow the other procedures of step 7 accordingly.\nThe nuclei suspension can be distributed to at least 20 wells of a 96-well plate (3,000–4,000 nuclei in 5 μL per well) at the end of this step.\nFollow procedures mentioned in steps 8–11 accordingly. The Tn5 activity titration test can be omitted since the aim of this pilot experiment is to reproduce its chemistry instead of achieving optimal library complexity. The Tn5 transposome can be used as a final concentration of 10 nM for tagmentation.\nPerform indexed PCR by adding 20 different P5/P7 primer combinations to the 20 wells. The PCR cycling number can be set as 16 to ensure that the library is concentrated enough for next-generation sequencing. Follow the other procedures of step 12 accordingly.\nProcess approximately 800 μL PCR products and follow the other procedures of step 13 accordingly.\nWe can sequence the library on a MiSeq platform or with a spike-in approach (Read1-Index1-Index2-Read2: 34-10-10-100 bp) to obtain a relatively small number of reads for quality check.\nNote: The sequencing result (fastq files) can be analyzed to examine whether all 10×10×20 barcode combinations have been successfully incorporated, whether reads can be mapped to the reference genome and read quality, etc., but may not be used for downstream analysis such as cell clustering.\nAs a summary, we present the major optimizations made in this protocol in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2205_24.csv"
