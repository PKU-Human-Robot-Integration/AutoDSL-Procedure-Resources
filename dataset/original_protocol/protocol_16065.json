    "This protocol is adapted from a classical protocol of primary hippocampal neuron culture (Kaech & Banker, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-bib-0010]; see Current Protocols article: Mendes et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-bib-0013]). The aim of HCS is to study the effect of a large number of compounds or genes in a limited time. To increase experimental efficiency, the cell culture needs to be miniaturized. Cells are grown in 384-well plates with a surface area of 8 mm² per well. To enable individual cells to be imaged and analyzed, cell density must be relatively low, cell culture must be homogeneous throughout the well, and cells must not form aggregates. A frequent problem with HCS is the edge effect, i.e., a phenotypic difference between cells seeded in the center of the plate and those seeded at the edge, which can lead to high inter-well variability. To avoid this problem, we chose not to seed cells in the wells at the edge of the plate, but to fill these wells with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). These cultures are maintained for up to 21 days in vitro to ensure sufficient maturation for the formation of a dense neuronal network and functional synapses. The screening of up to 107 lentiviral shRNAs, at two different multiplicity of infection (MOI) values, with each shRNA present in technical quadruplicate, requires the preparation of four 384-well plates with primary hippocampal neurons plated in 308 wells (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/de370916-f6e4-4c2c-ae09-fa72d75dac8f/cpz1904-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nHigh-content screening (HCS) plate map. Non-transduced wells (NT), non-targeting shRNA (shNT), and shRNA targeting Synaptophysin (shSyp) are used as technical controls for transduction.

One day before primary culture, coat 384-well cell culture microplates (excluding edge wells: rows A and P, columns 1 and 24) with 15 μl PDL per well and incubate overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Fill edge wells with 100 μl of 1× DPBS.\nCoated plates can be stored ≤1 week at 37°C.\n2. On the day of primary culture, wash the plates twice with 40 µl of 1× DPBS per well using a 16-channel pipet and then keep them with 1× DPBS in the incubator.\nDissect hippocampi\n3. Put the P0 Wistar rat pups on ice. Decapitate the pups with surgical scissors and keep the heads in a 50-ml tube containing ice-cold dissection buffer.",
    "On average, one pup yields 1 million hippocampal cells. For four PNC plates, 6 to 8 brains are needed.\nAll the dissection steps should be performed on ice.\n4. Transfer a head into a Petri dish filled with ice-cold dissection buffer. With a pair of forceps, pinch the skin at the front of the head and pull it to the back of the head. Open the skull from the back to the front of the head with a pair of forceps and carefully lift the brain with another pair of forceps to transfer it into a second Petri dish filled with ice-cold dissection buffer.\n5. Repeat with each of the heads, dispatching the brains into different dishes.\n6. Put one of the dishes under an inverted binocular microscope at 10× magnification and separate the two hemispheres of the brain. Lay each hemisphere with its ventral side up and pinch the olfactory bulb backward to pull out the meninges. Flip the hemisphere with its ventral side down and carefully peel the meninges off.\n7. Dissect the hippocampus from each cortex and transfer to a 15-ml tube fully filled with ice-cold dissection buffer.\n8.

During the incubation, add 12.5 µl of 5 mg/ml DNase I in 10 ml pre-warmed dissociation medium per brain.",
    "12. Remove as much trypsin as possible using a 1000-µl pipet tip and then add the 10 ml of dissociation medium with DNase. Invert each tube three times, letting the hippocampi sediment between inversions.\n13. Wash the hippocampi three times with 10 ml pre-warmed dissociation medium.\n14. Remove all the dissociation medium and add 2 ml pre-warmed culture medium. Mechanically dissociate the tissue using a 1000-µl pipet tip by gently pipetting up and down 30 times.\nAll pieces of tissue should be dissociated, and the suspension should be turbid but homogeneous. Try to avoid generating bubbles and do not dissociate the tissue more than 40 times to avoid damaging the cells.\n15. Centrifuge 8 min at 200 × g at room temperature.\n16. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 2 ml pre-warmed culture medium.\n17. Dilute 10 μl cell suspension in 40 μl pre-warmed culture medium and 50 μl trypan blue.\n18. Count the cells using a counting chamber.\nEach brain is expected to provide 1 × 106 cells. Cell death should not exceed 10%.\n19. Dilute the cell suspension in pre-warmed culture medium to 100,000 cells/ml.\nFor four PNC plates, dilute 5.6 × 106 cells in 56 ml culture medium.\n20. Pour the cell suspension into a 50-ml sterile reservoir and add 40 µl to each well within rows B to O and columns 2 to 23 using a 16-channel pipet.\nResuspend the cell suspension in the reservoir by pipetting up and down every 5 to 8 columns using the 16-channel pipet.\n21. Incubate the screening plates overnight in the tissue culture incubator and proceed directly to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-prot-0002].",
    "The choice of experimental controls is crucial in HCS, as controls help to ensure data quality and reliability. Controls should be chosen to produce an easily detectable and reproducible response. As a positive control, we choose to use an shRNA targeting Synaptophysin (shSyp), resulting in a decrease in the expression of the corresponding protein. The negative control used is a non-targeting shRNA (shNT). The transduction is performed at 1 day in vitro (DIV1) according to the plate map (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-fig-0001]). Each shRNA is present in technical duplicates in each plate, and two plates are transduced for each MOI, namely MOI2 and MOI4. These numbers are arbitrary and can be adapted to other HCS applications. Our plate map allows for testing the impact of the under-expression of a maximum of 107 genes of interest in technical quadruplicates at two different MOIs.\nMaterials\n1000× polybrene (Hexadimethrine bromide 4 mg/ml; Sigma, cat. no. 107689-10G)\nCulture medium (see recipe)\nFour screening plates, containing rat postnatal hippocampal cultures at DIV1 (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-prot-0001])\nLentiviral shRNA bank source plate, containing lentiviral shRNAs targeting genes of interest and lentiviral control shRNAs shNT (Merck, MISSION® shC002V) and shSyp (Merck, MISSION® NM_009305 TRCN0000379864)\n384-well plates (for intermediate dilutions; Brand, cat. no. 701355)\n16-channel pipet (Finnpipette F1; Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 4661090N)\nNOTE: Use sterile pipet tips with filters (Finntip 50; Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 94052060).\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator unless otherwise specified.\nChange medium in the screening plates\n1. Dilute 6.7 µl of 1000× polybrene in 10 ml culture medium (0.67× polybrene) and warm it to 37°C.\n2. Warm culture medium to 37°C.\n3. Allocate two screening plates each for transduction at MOI2 and MOI4 (four plates total).",
    "4. For each MOI4 screening plate, remove 40 µl medium from each well and add 10 µl fresh pre-warmed culture medium from step 2.\nExecute this step column by column to avoid drying of the cells.\n5. For each MOI2 screening plate, remove 40 µl medium from each well and add 15 µl fresh pre-warmed culture medium containing 0.67× polybrene from step 1.\nExecute this step column by column to avoid drying of the cells.\n6. Store the screening plates in the incubator until the intermediate plates are ready (see steps 7 to 11).\nPrepare intermediate plates\n7. To dilute the lentiviruses from the source plate into the intermediate plate to reach a transduction unit of 1.6 × 106 viral particles per milliliter (VP/ml), calculate the volume of the medium required separately for each shRNA in the bank (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-fig-0002]).\nThe volume in the intermediate plate should be between 70 µl and 280 µl per well.\nThere is inherent variation in the virus titer received from the producer. For screening, the virus titer needs to be uniform throughout the plate (for a given MOI). The intermediate plate is where the lentiviruses are diluted to a common transduction unit before they are added to the screening plates. A minimum 70 µl lentivirus suspension is needed to screen an shRNA in quadruplicate (two plates per MOI and two wells per plate) at MOI2 and MOI4. Here, a total of 10 µl × 4 = 40 µl is needed for MOI4 plates and a total of 5 µl × 4 = 20 µl is needed for MOI2 plates, plus 10 µl dead volume, resulting in 70 µl. One well of a 384-well plate can safely receive a maximum of 280 μl, considering the tip volume.",
    "For example, for a lentivirus bank where the titer varies between 1.3 × 107 VP/ml and 4.3 × 107 VP/ml, one can dilute 9 µl shRNA into a total volume varying from [9 µl × (1.3 × 107/1.6 × 106) =] 73 µl to [9 µl × (4.3 × 107/1.6 × 106 =] 242 µl. Similarly, one can dilute 10 µl shRNA into a total volume varying from [10 µl × (1.3 × 107/1.6 × 106) =] 81 µl to [10 µl × (4.3 × 107/1.6 × 106) =] 268 µl. Diluting 8 µl of the shRNA with the lowest titer would result in a final volume of [8 µl × (1.3 × 107/1.6 × 106) =] 65 µl, which is not desirable because it is <70 µl. On the other hand, diluting 11 µl of the shRNA with the highest titer would result in a final volume of [11 µl × (4.3 × 107/1.6 × 106) =] 295 µl, which is beyond the 280-µl safe well capacity.\nThese calculations will have to be repeated for each lentivirus bank and for the number of technical replications and MOI(s) chosen by the user.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2477c84e-58fb-46d8-8423-aeb67ef956df/cpz1904-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nWorkflow for lentiviral transduction of primary neuronal cells with the shRNA bank in the screening plates. Lentiviral shRNAs from the source plate are diluted in the intermediate plate to reach a transduction unit of 1.6. 106 VP/ml and used for transducing cells cultured in two screening plates at MOI4 and two screening plates at MOI2. All these steps are performed using a 16-channel pipet. shNT: non-targeting shRNA; shSyp: shRNA targeting Synaptophysin; PNC: primary neuronal culture; PB: polybrene; NBA: Neurobasal-A Medium; DPBS: Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline.",
    "8. For each shRNA, round the volume of medium required to dilute the lentivirus suspension (equal to the final volume calculated in step 7 minus the volume of the lentiviral suspension) to the nearest 10 µl.\nFollowing one of the examples in step 7, if one decided to dilute 10 µl shRNA at a titer of 1.3 × 107 VP/ml, the rounded volume for this shRNA would be 81 µl – 10 µl = 71 µl ≈ 70 µl.\n9. Thaw the lentiviral shRNA bank source plate.\nThe source plate is ideally packaged in the 384-well plate format with a minimum volume of 15 µl and a minimum transduction unit of 107 VP/ml.\n10. Dilute 40 µl of 1000× polybrene in 20 ml pre-warmed culture medium to obtain 2× polybrene. Using a single-channel pipet, fill the wells of a 384-well plate (the intermediate plate) with the different volumes of medium calculated in step 7 for each shRNA. Fill the non-transduced wells with 100 µl pre-warmed culture medium.\n11. Using a 16-channel pipet, transfer the volume of shRNAs from the source plate to the corresponding wells of the intermediate plate.\nIt is important for the quality of the shRNA bank that a multichannel pipet is used to minimize the time required for dilution after thawing. This can only be assured by fixing a set volume of lentivirus suspension, regardless of the titer. This, however, requires that the medium volume for each shRNA should be calculated and added to the wells in advance (see step 10).\nTransduce cells with lentiviruses\n12. Transfer 10 µl lentivirus suspension at 1.6 × 106 VP/ml from each well of the intermediate plate to the corresponding well and its duplicate in the two MOI4 screening plates (see step 6).",
    "13. Transfer 5 µl lentivirus suspension at 1.6 × 106 VP/ml from each well of the intermediate plate to the corresponding well and its duplicate in the two MOI2 screening plates (see step 6).\n14. Incubate screening plates for 6 hr in the tissue culture incubator.\n15. Add 20 µl fresh pre-warmed NBA medium to each transduction well (40 ml in total).\n16. Incubate the screening plates in the tissue culture incubator until DIV21 and then proceed directly to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-prot-0003].",
    "This HCS approach is based on the immunolabeling of a presynaptic protein (Synaptophysin) and a postsynaptic protein (Homer1) and the quantitative analysis of their relative positions. This strategy has recently been shown to have sufficient sensitivity to detect the changes in synaptic connectivity induced by exposing neurons to cell-secreted Aβ oligomers at physiologically relevant concentrations (Kilinc et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-bib-0011]). To ensure an efficient and reproducible immunolabeling process in 384-well plates, washing steps are automated using a robotic platform. To reduce the damage to fixed cells, the position of the distribution/aspiration heads is optimized and the flow rate is reduced. Automated steps of the protocol need to be adapted to the material available to the user. Addition of primary and secondary antibody mixes, however, is done manually to avoid waste due to the relatively large dead volume.\nMaterials\nFour screening plates, containing transduced rat hippocampal cultures at DIV21 (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-prot-0002])\n4% (v/v) formaldehyde in DPBS\n0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DPBS\n2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DPBS with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100\nPrimary antibodies:\n               \nChicken anti-Homer1 (Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 160006)\nGuinea pig anti-Synaptophysin (Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 101004)\nMouse anti-MAP2 (Synaptic Systems, cat. no. 188011)\n1× DPBS\nSecondary antibodies:\n               \nDonkey anti-chicken Alexa 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 703-545-155)\nGoat anti-guinea pig Alexa 555 (Life Technologies, cat. no.

    "Columbus generates tabulated data that contains information for each detected synaptic spot, for each field in each well in each plate. To analyze this massive amount of tabulated data, we have generated a custom Matlab algorithm that extracts data from .txt files in stored specific folders into matrices that contain network area and network staining intensity per field, as well as xy-position and staining intensity for all Synaptophysin and Homer1 spots. The algorithm first excludes fields with no presynaptic or postsynaptic spots detected. It then identifies outlier fields within a well in terms of network area or network staining intensity. After excluding the outlier fields, the algorithm runs a subroutine to calculate, for each Homer1 spot, its Euclidian distance to all Synaptophysin spots in the same field. Each Homer1 spot is then assigned to the nearest Synaptophysin spot with a pre-determined cut-off distance. In control cultures, the fraction of Synaptophysin spots with at least one Homer1 spot assigned linearly increases with increasing cut-off distance, until it starts to reach a plateau. We thus select a cut-off distance in the linear portion of the curve and apply it to all images in the screen. The ultimate read-out of the screen, synapse density, is then defined as the area density of Synaptophysin spots with at least one Homer1 spot assigned.\nMaterials\nColumbus results (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#cpz1904-prot-0005])\nMatlab, version R2017b or above (Mathworks; or similar numerical analysis software)\nMatlab code HCS_CPCB_annotated.m[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.904#support-information-section] (see Supporting Information)\nMicrosoft Excel (or similar spreadsheet software)\nCopy Columbus results to a local folder and run Matlab code\n1.

    "Columbus results will be stored in three text files per well: one each for MAP2 network, Synaptophysin spots, and Homer1 spots.\n2. Set the initial parameters in the Matlab code: “cutoffs” stands for the different cut-off distances in micrometers; “fieldnum” stands for the number of fields acquired per well; and “resolution” stands for the pixel resolution of images in µm/px.\nThe length of the cut-off distances vector is arbitrary and can be 1. The code acquires well names from .txt file names using the following command:\nwellnames(k) = strrep(strrep(eraseBetween(eraseBetween(MyFolderInfo(k*3+2).name,'Syn','.'), '[','txt'), 'Syn.result.', ''), '[txt', '');\nIf the output file name format of Columbus changes, adapt the Matlab command to the new name needed.\nThe code will exclude fields with no Homer1 spots or Synaptophysin spots by looking at the corresponding network file.\nFor each well, the code will exclude fields with network area outside median ± 2 median absolute differences (MADs), as wells as fields with mean network intensity outside median ± 2 MADs.\n3.
