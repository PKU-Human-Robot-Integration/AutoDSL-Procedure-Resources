    "All procedures listed immediately below in the Protocol section were conducted as described in protocols approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Anesthetic Induction and Monitoring of Vital Signs\nNOTE: This study used pigmented NIH-strain guinea pigs obtained from an in-house breeding colony.\nUse guinea pigs of either sex, weighing at least 350 g.\nPlace the guinea pig in a neonatal warming isolette and give a ketamine/xylazine mixture intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine) for induction anesthesia. Observe the guinea pig until it loses the toe-pinch reflex.\nOnce loss of toe-pinch reflexes occurs, shave the posterior neck and head of the guinea pig with a hair trimmer typically advertised for human use.\nInject a subcutaneous bolus of 12 mL of lactated Ringer's solution into the back of the animal.\nPlace the guinea pig supine on a warming pad with legs raised and place 27.5 G butterfly needle intraperitoneally. Verify that the butterfly needle is in the correct position in the intraperitoneal space by ensuring only air is aspirated. If blood or fluid is aspirated, there is concern for delivery into the vascular or bowel system. The butterfly needle is used for repeated administration of anesthesia.\nFlip the guinea pig over to the prone position and secure the head to a stereotactic holder.\nSecure a pulse oximeter to the foot. If using pigmented guinea pigs, pigmented paws can prevent reading oxygen saturation. Therefore, place the pulse oximeter on any paw that is not pigmented.",
    "Insert a rectal temperature probe to monitor body temperature. The rectal probe is part of a warming blanket system that maintains body temperature at 38 °C. Do not turn on the warming blanket until the rectal probe is in place to avoid overheating the warming blanket. If having difficulty placing the rectal probe, it can be laid alongside the guinea pig's body.\nApply lubricant to both eyes of the guinea pig to prevent corneal abrasions.\nAdminister supplemental oxygen as needed via a rubber tubing positioned near the nose to maintain oxygen saturation levels above 90%.\nGive enrofloxacin 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously as an antibiotic prophylaxis.\nGive 0.25 mg/kg bupivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine subcutaneously at the anticipated incision site for local anesthesia and vasoconstrictive effects.\nProvide maintenance anesthesia every 20 min for 4 cycles and then only as needed based on vital signs. Routinely monitor the depth of anesthesia by body temperature, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and heart rate.\nMonitor vital signs every 15 minutes (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation).\n2. Surgical Preparation\nOnce the head of the guinea pig is positioned securely in a stereotactic holder, place a piece of masking tape over the back to provide adequate tension along the skin overlying the occiput. Secure the ends of the tape to the stereotactic holder.\nLiberally prep the skin overlying the occiput and posterior neck with iodine solution and 70% ethanol in a sterile fashion three times.\nAt this point, use sterile precautions and autoclaved instruments. Place sterile drapes over the guinea pig.\n3. Surgical Procedure",
    "Using a 15 blade, make a small, midline incision along the posterior occiput extending down into the posterior neck. Once under the skin, use iris scissors to detach the right posterior cervical muscles from the occipital bone. If any bleeding occurs while cutting the muscles, control by applying pressure with a sterile cotton ball.\nUsing a combination of a #3 mm, #2 mm, and #1 mm diamond burr with a 5-0 suction and sterile irrigation, perform a craniotomy that is bounded by the external occipital crest, lamboidal ridge, the occipitomastoid suture line, and the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum.\nGently place a small piece of saline-moistened cotton ball under the bone while separating the occipital bone from the dura.\nSkeletonize the sigmoid sinus with a #0.5 mm diamond burr and carefully remove the bone overlying it.\nOnce the sigmoid sinus is exposed, gently retract the sigmoid sinus medially using a cotton ball and switch to using a 3-0 suction.\nIdentify the operculum as a slit like structure that is located within the petrous temporal bone. The subarcuate fossa will be situated superiorly and the sigmoid sinus will be medial to it. The extra-osseous portion of the endolymphatic sac is then visualized as a clear sac entering the operculum and attached to the dura overlying the sigmoid sinus. The operculum is oval shaped, approximately 3 to 4 mm by 1.5 to 2 mm. However, as seen from the surgical view, the operculum appears as an approximate 1 mm slit. The visible portion of the sac from the surgical view is approximately the same size as the visible portion of the operculum, if not smaller.",
    "Apply gentle retraction to the sigmoid sinus medially in order to clearly visualize the extra-osseous portion of the endolymphatic sac and increase the tension between the extraosseous and intraosseous portions of the endolymphatic sac.\nUse a fine angled pick to gently expunge the intermediate portion of the endolymphatic sac. It is critical that the expungement process leave no visible connection between the dura and the operculum; then place a fine pick inside the operculum to broadly scrape along the inside of the bone to injure it.\nTurn the fine pick in the direction of the endolymphatic duct and blindly disrupt the lining. At this point some bleeding may occur from a vessel within the operculum. It can be controlled with a small piece of cotton.\nDry the empty operculum with a small piece of cotton. Using the 3-0 suction as needed to keep the cotton dry.\nObtain bone dust by using a small curette to scrape along the squamosal portion of the temporal bone. Generously pack the operculum with bone dust. Use a cotton ball and suction to keep the area dry while packing it with bone dust.\nApply bone wax to the operculum to seal it. Ensure that there is no excess bone wax dislodged into the skull.\nUse bone wax to cover the skull defect.\nApproximate the posterior cervical muscles with 4-0 braided, absorbable suture in an interrupted fashion.\nPerform a subcuticular closure using a 4-0 braided, absorbable suture.\n4. Post-procedure Care\nRemove the guinea pig from the custom stereotactic holder and transfer to a warming isolette.\nGive 2 mg/kg Atipamezole and 24 mL of lactated Ringer's solution (subcutaneously away from the incision). Give lactated Ringer's solution due to the diuretic effects of xylazine. Administer 0.2 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously for post-operative analgesic coverage.",
    "Obtain vital signs every 15 minutes until the guinea pig fully emerges from anesthesia.\nGive an additional 12 mL fluid bolus of lactated Ringer's solution about 2 hours from end of surgery during the recovery period.\nOnce the guinea pig is alert, ambulating, voiding, and having bowel movements, return the guinea pig to the animal facility. Approximately 2 to 4 hours are needed for the guinea pig to emerge completely from anesthesia.\nMonitor guinea pigs twice daily for the first three post-operative days. If signs of discomfort are observed, administer 0.2 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously every 24 hours as needed. Alternatively, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) may be administered subcutaneously if symptoms are not sufficiently managed by meloxicam. \nGive a 12 mL fluid bolus of lactated Ringer's solution subcutaneously twice a day for up to three days until the guinea pig reaches the pre-operative weight. If the guinea pig reaches its pre-operative weight prior to the third post-operative day, then stop fluid boluses. If the guinea pig continues to lose weight after the first three days, use a supplement nutrition shake typically advertised for human consumption mixed with crushed guinea pig food pellets.\nMonitor guinea pigs weekly until their end point.\nSubscription Required.
