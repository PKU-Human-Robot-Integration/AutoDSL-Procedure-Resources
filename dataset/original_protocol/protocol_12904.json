    "1. Assess SNFr in the Progeny of the ME49-FUDRr  x VAND-SNFr Cross\nNOTE: T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and the tachyzoite stage readily grows in tissue culture.\nTo grow the T. gondii parasite, maintain them in confluent Human Foreskin Fibroblast (HFF) monolayer culture seeded to T25 flasks with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (D10 media) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: See Protocol 1.1 Note in Supplementary File 1.\nTo test individual progeny clones for sinefungin resistance, grow each clone to high parasite density in a T25 HFF culture flask for 2-3 d, until majority of the parasites begin to lyse the host cells.\nScrape the monolayer with a cell scraper and pass the parasite solution through a 10 mL syringe/22 G blunt needle 2-3x to lyse the host cells releasing parasites. The solution can be pulled back up into the syringe for multiple needle passages.\nFilter the parasite solution into a new conical tube through a membrane with the pore size of 3 µm to remove HFF cells and cellular debris.\nCount the parasites on a hemocytometer and determine the number of parasites per mL.\nUsing a pipettor, pass 2.5 x 105 parasites to a new T25 HFF culture flask containing D10 media with 0.3 µM working concentration of the sinefungin drug.\nGrow the parasites at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7-10 d.\nScore the progeny for the growth phenotype in sinefungin drug. Observe the monolayer under an inverted phase-contrast microscope and score 0 for no growth (sinefungin sensitive), score 1 for growth and lysis of monolayer (sinefungin resistant).\n\tNOTE: See Protocol 1.8 Note in Supplementary File 1.\n2.

    "Use the MUMmer nucmer program to align the ME49 genome (available for download from ToxoDB.org 32) and the VAND reference genome file (output goes to the out.delta file):\n\t\t>nucmer ToxoDB-28_TgondiiME49_Genome.fasta GCA_000224845.2_TGVAND_v2_genomic.fna\nUse the MUMmer show-coords program to obtain the coordinates of the two genome alignments, output to a file named ME49vsVAND-coords.txt:\n\t\t>show-coords out.delta > ME49vsVAND-coords.txt\n\t\tNOTE: The ME49vsVAND-coords.txt file can be used to find the VAND contigs and positions that correspond to the QTL locus; markers MV359 to MV366 located on ME49 chromosome IX between 3,187,537 to 4,202,258 bp. There are two VAND contigs that span the corresponding QTL locus; KN044604.1:657,441-1 bp and KN042501.1:430,910-41,870 bp (both contigs align reverse to the ME49 chromosome).\nAssess progeny SNPs located within the QTL locus for SNPs inherited only in the SNFr progeny\n\tNOTE: See Protocol 3.4 Note in Supplementary File 1.\n\t\nReview Data File 3 to identify the causal mutation located within the QTL locus. Scan the data for a pattern where the SNFr progeny have a SNP and the SNFs do not (feasible because progeny SNPs were obtained by comparison to the VAND-SNFs reference genome). This should only result in one position with this pattern, position 348130 on VAND contig KN042501.1.\nSee row 6604 in Data File 3 (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: See Protocol 3.4.2 Note in Supplementary File 1.\n4. Verification of Identified Hits by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Gene Inactivation.",
    "NOTE: To confirm the causal SNP identified by QTL mapping and WGS SNP analysis, the corresponding genetic changes need to be made in a WT SNFs background and the resulting phenotype examined. In the case of sinefungin resistance, the responsible mutation results in inactivation of the SNR1 gene by early termination 2. Therefore, disruption of SNR1 can be used for confirmation. Here a detailed protocol is provided for using CRISPR/Cas9 induced indel mutations to disrupt SNR1, to demonstrate its involvement in sinefungin resistance (Figure 4).\nSNR1 specific CRISPR plasmid construction\n\tNOTE: See Protocol 4.1 Note in Supplementary File 1 to obtain plasmids and maps.\n\t\nObtain the genomic sequence for the target gene (SNR1, TGME49_290860) from ToxoDB 32.\nUse online tools such as E-CRISP 33 to design target specific gRNAs. Do not include the PAM sequence (NGG) in the gRNA.\n\t\tNOTE: See Protocol 4.1.2 Note in Supplementary File 1.\nSynthesize primers to construct the target specific CRISPR plasmid.\n\t\t\nAccording to the design from step 4.1.2, synthesize two primers to change the UPRT targeting gRNA in the original CRISPR plasmid to the selected gRNA sequence by site-directed mutagenesis.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The sequences of these two primers are as follow: gRNA-Fw: NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGC (N20 is the target specific gRNA sequence) and gRNA-Rv: AACTTGACATCCCCATTTAC 2.\nPerform the site-directed mutagenesis reactions.\n\t\t\nUsing the UPRT targeting CRISPR plasmid (pSAG1::CAS9-U6::sgUPRT) as template and the two primers listed above, perform site-directed mutagenesis reactions according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use the following cycling conditions for PCR: 98 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min, followed by final extension for 2 min at 72 °C.",
    "Transform the mutagenesis products containing the GOI-specific CRISPR plasmids to E. coli competent cells by chemical transformation according to the supplier's protocol (see Tables of Materials). Grow the transformants on lysogeny broth (LB) plates containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL) at 37 °C. Subsequently, pick 2-4 clones and individually grow them in 5 mL LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin for 12-16 h.\n\t\t\nExtract plasmids from the cultures using a DNA isolation kit and analyze them by DNA gel electrophoresis to check the size of the plasmids (expected plasmid size is 9674 bp, use the original CRISPR plasmid as control). Use the M13-Rev primer (5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) to sequence the plasmids to confirm the target specific gRNA sequence.\n\t\t\t\nOnce positive clones are identified, store both plasmid DNA at -20 °C and corresponding bacterial culture at -80 °C for future use.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The CRISPR plasmid to be used for transfection should be dissolved in deionized water and the concentration determined by spectrophotometry or an alternative method.\nParasite transfection.\n\tNOTE: General methods for culturing T. gondii in HFF cells in D10 medium have been described previously 34.\n\t\nTwo to three days before transfection, add enough parasites to a T25 flask containing a confluent HFF cell monolayer (0.5-1 x 106 for type 1 strains, 1-2 x 106 for other strains) to achieve 70 - 80% HFF cell lysis within 2-3 d.\nExamine the culture under an inverted phase contrast microscope, when the HFF monolayer is 70-80% lysed by the parasites. Gently remove the medium with a pipette and wash the cells off the flask surface with 5 mL cytomix buffer (120 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 pH = 7.6, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, pH = 7.6). Subsequently, transfer the parasite solution to a 15-mL conical tube.",
    "NOTE: See Protocol 4.2.2 Note in Supplementary File 1.\nPass the parasite solution through a 10 mL syringe/22 G blunt needle 2-3x.\nFilter the parasite solution into a new conical tube through a membrane with the pore size of 3 µm to remove HFF cells and cellular debris.\nPellet the filtered parasites by centrifugation at 400 x g for 10 min.\nPour off the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted parasites with 10 mL cytomix buffer, take a 10 µL aliquot to determine the parasite concentration with a hemocytometer and pellet the rest by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in cytomix buffer to obtain a density of 4 x 107 parasites/mL.\nIn a 4 mm gap cuvette, mix 250-300 µL parasite solution (1-1.3 x 107 parasites) with 7.5 µg CRISPR plasmid, 6 µL ATP (100mM), and 6 µL glutathione (GSH) (250 mM).\nElectroporate the parasites 35. Include a separate electroporation as a negative control in which a CRISPR plasmid targets elsewhere, such as the UPRT targeting CRIPSR plasmid.\n\t\tNOTE: The electroporation settings depend on the device. For the electroporator listed in the Materials use the 4 mm gap cuvettes. The following protocol is recommended: 1,700 V, 176 µs of pulse length, 2 pulses with 100 ms interval.\nDetermine the frequency of sinefungin resistance after CRISPR targeting.\nSeed HFF cells to coverslips placed in 24-well plates 3-4 d before electroporation so that they are confluent by the time to perform transfection in 4.2.\n\t\t\nTrypsinize the HFF cells from one confluent T25 flask and subsequently add 12 mL D10 medium and mix well.",
    "Add a coverslip to each well of a 24-well plate and aliquot 500 µL HFF cell solution to each well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 3  4 d to let the cells grow until confluent.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Cells from one T25 flask are enough to seed one 24-well plate.\nAdd 50 µL of electroporated parasite solution from step 4.2.9 into one well of 24-well plate containing a coverslip seeded with confluent HFF cells. Transfer the rest of electroporated parasite solution into a T25 flask seeded with confluent HFF cells.\nAssess the efficiency of transfection.\n\t\t\nGrow the cells in the 24-well plate for 24 h and subsequently fix the cells (host cells and parasites) with 500 µl 4% formaldehyde to check the expression of Cas9-GFP by immunofluorescent assay (IFA).\nProbe the cells with an anti-GFP antibody and a Toxoplasma specific antibody (such as anti-TgALD) to label total parasites. See the antibody product sheet for the recommended dilution (usually, 1:1,000 is sufficient for IFAs). If the antibodies are unconjugated, use two different secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes to label the primary antibodies.\nObserve the labeled cells on a fluorescent microscope with filters appropriate for the secondary fluorescent dyes. Obtain transfection efficiency by dividing the number of GFP positive parasites by the number of total parasites.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The two antibodies used for IFA should come from two different host species, for example using the combination of mouse anti-GFP and rabbit anti-TgALD.\nDetermine the frequency of sinefungin resistance in transfected parasites.",
    "For the transfected parasites cultured in T25 flasks, grow them for 2-3 d until natural egress. Then collect the parasites, blunt needle lyse host cells to release intracellular parasites, and purify them by filtration through membranes with pore size of 3 µm. Count the parasites with a hemocytometer to estimate the density.\nAdd purified parasites into 6-well plates seeded with confluent HFF cells: for the first row (3 wells), add 200 parasites/well and grow them in regular D10 medium (2 mL/well); for the second row, add 5000 parasites/well and grow them in D10 medium containing 0.3 µM sinefungin.\nPut the plates in a 5% CO2 incubator and grow the parasites for at 37 °C 8-10 d without disturbance to allow plaques to form. Fix the samples with 70% ethanol (2 mL/well) and stain the monolayer with 0.1% crystal violet (2 mL/well). Wash the wells with water to visualize the plaques (clear zones) formed by parasite growth.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The negative control should be processed the same way side by side.\nCalculate the rate of CRISPR induced sinefungin resistance.\n\t\t\nObtain the average number (X) of plaques from wells containing no drug and calculate the parasite viability as X/200. Obtain the average number (Y) of plaques from wells containing sinefungin to calculate the rate of CRISPR induced sinefungin resistance as follow:\n\t\t\tRate of CRISPR induced resistance = 200×Y/ (5000 × X × transfection efficiency)\n\t\t\tNOTE: Transfection efficiency is obtained from 4.3.2.\nExamine the indel mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9\nGrow the electroporated parasites from section 4.2.9 in a T25 flask seeded with HFF cells for 2 d at 37 °C. Then, replace the medium with 5 mL D10 medium containing 0.3 µM sinefungin (selection medium).",
    "Keep the parasites in selection medium for at least 3 passages until the resistant pool becomes stable (indicated by the absence of parasite growth in the negative control group but robust parasite growth in the experimental group).\nSubclone the sinefungin resistant pool to obtain clonal strains.\n\t\t\nCollect freshly egressed parasites, purify by 3 µm membrane filtration and subclone into 96-well plates seeded with confluent HFF cells in 150 µL D10 medium. Grow the subcloning cultures in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 7 - 10 d without disturbing the plates.\n\t\t\tNOTE: See Protocol 4.4.2.1 Note in Supplementary File 1.\nCheck the 96-well plates under an inverted phase-contrast microscope to look for wells that contain only one plaque. Mark such wells and subsequently transfer the cells from each well to 24-well plates seeded with HFF cells using a pipette.\nWhen 80-90% of the HFF cells in a well are lysed, harvest the parasites (about 500 µL) and pass 50 µL parasite solution to a new well to maintain the strain. Use the rest (≈450 µL) to extract genomic DNA for PCR amplification.\n\t\t\nFor genomic DNA isolation from the SNFr clone, pellet the parasites (small amounts of HFF cell contamination is tolerable) at 1,000 x g for 10 min. Wash the pelleted parasites with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and pellet them again. Isolate genomic DNA from pelleted cells using a commercial kit or by boiling. Resuspend parasites in 50-100 µL PBS.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Perform PCR to obtain a fragment of the SNR1 gene for sequencing. Use the following primers to amplify the SNR1 locus2: SNR1-Amp-Fw: 5' CCGACCACAA CAATTTTC and SNR1-Amp-Rv: 5'GACGTGATTCACTTTTTTACAGACAGAC. Use high fidelity DNA polymerases. Amplify the WT locus for control purposes.",
