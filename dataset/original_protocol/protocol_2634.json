    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of the animal\nTiming: 45 min\nThis part involves preparing the animal for in vivo whole-cell recordings. The mouse is anesthetized, a head bar is secured on the skull and a craniotomy is then performed.\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane (C57BL/6J, male/female, 4–8 weeks). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nWeigh the animal and determine the urethane-CPX mixture injection volume.\nInjection volume = weight of mouse in grams × 0.01 mL of urethane-CPX mixture. For a 20 g mouse, 0.2 mL urethane-CPX mixture should be injected IP. Final dosage: 1 g/kg urethane and 5 mg/kg CPX.\nDetermine the bupivacaine injection volume.\nInjection volume = weight of mouse in grams × 1.4 μL bupivacaine hydrochloride (5 mg/mL). For a 20 g mouse, 0.028 mL should be injected subcutaneously. Final dosage: 6–8 mg/kg.\nPlace the mouse cage on a separate, constant voltage heating platform.\nPrefill a gas anesthesia induction chamber with isoflurane (4%–5% in 0.3 L/min O2).\nPlace a C57Bl/6J mouse in the induction chamber and monitor its breathing.\nRemove the mouse from the induction chamber once breathing has slowed down.\nAssess the depth of anesthesia using the paw withdrawal reflex.\nPlace the mouse on a tissue on the surgery table.\nCarefully pinch one of the back paws with a forceps (Dumont type #3).\nIf the mouse is not sufficiently anesthetized, it will show a withdrawal reflex. In that case, place the mouse back in the induction box.\nAdminister urethane-CPX mixture for long-term anesthesia.\nAssess the depth of anesthesia using the paw withdrawal reflex.\nIf no withdrawal reflex is detected, inject the mouse IP with the predetermined volume of urethane-CPX mixture.\nPlace the mouse back in its pre-heated cage and wait for the anesthesia to take effect.",
    "After 15 min, assess the animal’s depth of anesthesia using the paw withdrawal reflex (step 1g).\nAdminister one dose of additional urethane-CPX mixture if necessary (max 10% of initial dose).\nNote: Reassess the paw withdrawal reflex every 15 min during the preparation of the animal to make sure that sufficiently deep anesthesia is maintained. Administer additional urethane-CPX mixture if necessary (max 10% of initial dose).\nPrepare the mouse for head bar placement. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on the heating pad, with the head facing the researcher (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2292-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Head bar placement and craniotomy\nSchematic representation of steps taken for head bar placement and the craniotomy surgery.\n(A) Anesthetized mice are shaved and (B) skin is removed, exposing the skull where Bregma (‘B’) and Lambda (‘L’) landmarks can be identified.\n(C) Two layers of primer are applied on the dry skull and hardened with UV light.\n(D and E) (D) A layer of UV-curing composite is used to attach the head bar to the skull, (E) which is secured with a second layer of composite.\n(F) The position of the craniotomy is determined based on coordinates relative to Lambda (‘L’).\nLevel the head by putting an object under the snout of the mouse (e.g., an absorbent triangle), so that Bregma and Lambda are approximately at equal height.\nCover the temperature sensor with Vaseline and place the probe in the rectum. Secure the sensor to the table using tape. Make sure that the temperature of the mouse is kept at 37°C.\nApply a drop of silicon oil on both eyes to prevent the eyes from drying out.",
    "Note: Take care not to damage the eyes, since they are critical to the experiment. The short time between induction of anesthesia and covering the eye with silicon oil would normally not lead to drying out of the eyes. If signs of drying of the eyes emerge (e.g., white cornea), immediately apply silicon oil on the eyes.\nTrim the whiskers on both sides.\nNote: If using the LEDs for visual stimulation, trimming the whiskers ensures that the LED goggles can be placed more tightly on the eyes. If using the haploscope and monitors for visual stimulation, this ensures that the whiskers do not interfere with visual stimulation. Furthermore, as the intermediate and deeper layers of SC also process somatosensory information,7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] trimming the whiskers reduces the potential effect this has on visually-evoked SC neuronal activity.\nRemove the hair on top of the head using the scalpel dipped in soapy water.\nRemove the loose hairs with a tissue.\nNote: Keep the scalpel and hairs wet, as this makes the shaving easier. Softly press on the skin to aid the shaving. Work from the neck forward to the snout, hold the scalpel in a 30° angle to the head surface and make small shaving movements.\nAlternatives: An electric hair trimmer or hair removal cream can also be used.\nDry the shaved area with an absorbent triangle.\nInject bupivacaine subcutaneously under the skin on top of the head for local anesthesia.\nWait >5 min to allow the anesthesia to take effect.\nOpen the head skin and clean the skull.\nRemove the skin covering the top of the skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Using forceps (Dumont type #3) and dissecting scissors, cut the skin from the front to the back of the head, starting from the skin between the eyes to the back of the skull at the level of the ears. The skin covering the Lambda skull landmark should be removed.\nRemove the remaining tissue from the skull bone using a surgical curette.\nClean the bone with absorbent triangles and a drop of aCSF if necessary.\nCritical: Wait until any bleeding from the bone has stopped and the bone is fully dry before proceeding to the next step.\nAttach the head bar.\nApply a layer of Optibond primer on the skull bone, covering the skull between the eyes up until the Bregma landmark (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nLet the primer etch the bone for 10 s.\nHarden using UV light for 20 s.\nApply a second layer of primer by repeating above steps one more time.\nSecure the head bar to the skull (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nApply a layer of UV-curing Kulzer Venus Flow composite on top of the primer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPlace the head bar on top of the dental composite and harden using UV light for 20 s.\nNote: Make sure the head bar does not occlude the area where the craniotomy is located. The head should be level and the head bar should be parallel to the eyes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nApply dental composite around and on top of the head bar to increase contact with the skull. Harden using UV light for 20 s.\nPlace the mouse in the electrophysiology rig.\nRemove the rectal probe.\nPosition the mouse on a heating pad in the recording rig and secure the head bar to the vertical posts using plastic screws.",
    "Insert the new rectal probe and turn on the heating pad control unit. Maintain the animal temperature at 37°C.\nPause point: After placing the mouse in the electrophysiology rig and making sure that the body temperature of the mouse is stable, one can take a short break. Regularly check the depth of anesthesia (every 15 min) and administer additional urethane-CPX mixture if necessary (max 10% of initial dose).\nPerforming the craniotomy surgery\nTiming: 20 min\nAt this point a craniotomy will be made so that the superior colliculus (SC) can be accessed with recording electrodes. The dura mater covering the brain surface will also be removed. This is done with the mouse secured in the rig, in order to minimize movements of the mouse after the craniotomy is performed and to be able to use the stereoscope.\nDetermine the coordinates of the center of the craniotomy and indicate the location on the skull.\nAttach a glass electrode to the pipette holder, which is positioned perpendicular to the horizontal plane.\nLower the tip of the electrode to right above the Lambda landmark and set the micromanipulator coordinates to ‘0’ (see red asterisk in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nUsing the appropriate stereotaxic coordinates, position the tip of the electrode above the SC (see the note below).\nMake a scratch in the skull at the position of the electrode tip using a fine needle to mark the site of the craniotomy.\nNote: A glass electrodes from a previous recording session can be used to determine the site of the craniotomy to preserve newly made electrodes.",
    "Note: The SC can be targeted between -1.1 mm and +0.5 mm in the anteroposterior axis relative to Lambda. If using Bregma as a landmark, the SC can be targeted between -3.1 mm and -4.7 mm in the anteroposterior axis relative to Bregma. These distances assume an adult mouse with a typical Bregma-Lambda distance of 4.21 mm. In the mediolateral axis, the SC can be targeted between 0 and 1.75 mm relative to the midline, depending on the anteroposterior position. For recordings of binocular visual neurons, targeting the anteromedial part of SC is recommended (0.8 mm–1.0 mm anterior to Lambda, 0.1 mm–0.8 mm lateral to midline).\nPerform the craniotomy.\nMake four superficial drill tracks around the determined coordinates.\nFrequently apply aCSF kept at room temperature (20°C–22°C) to prevent the heat produced by the drill to reach the brain tissue.\nDry using absorbent triangles before drilling again.\nStop the drilling process once the skull under the four drill tracks is equally thin.\nNote: Ideally the skull in the drill track should start to show small cracks and one can see through the drilled zone. Softly touching the piece of skull covering the craniotomy should easily cause the piece to move.\nCritical: Make sure to apply very light pressure on the drill and to not touch the underlying brain tissue with the drill head. A craniotomy of optimal quality without damage or bleeding in the underlying brain tissue is crucial for the success of the experiment. Putting in enough time and effort to create an optimal craniotomy will pay off in the form of good quality recordings.\nWith forceps (Dumont type #5/45 bended tip) carefully grab one corner of the piece of skull to be removed and pull it off slowly.",
    "Critical: Keep the brain tissue moist with aCSF at all times after removing the skull bone.\nNote: Use a dental drill with a small bit size (<0.5 mm Ø) to create a 1 × 1 mm craniotomy. We perform a square craniotomy, since it is easier to drill four straight tracks than to drill in a circular motion. It is also easier to monitor the thickness of the skull of a straight drill track. Together this improves the quality of the craniotomy.\nNote: Occasionally the piece of skull and dura mater do not easily separate. Do not pull off the skull piece if this happens, as this could damage the dura mater and underlying brain tissue. In this case applying a drop of aCSF may help.\nRemove the dura.\nRemove any remaining pieces of skull from the craniotomy with the forceps, while avoiding touching the brain surface. Make sure that the edges of the craniotomy are smooth without sharp skull pieces.\nUse aCSF to keep the dura mater moist and use absorbent triangles to clean the skull around the craniotomy.\nUse a 30G needle mounted on a cotton swab to make a shallow cut in the dura.\nNote: We recommend mounting the needle on a cotton swab as this allows for the needle to approach the dura from a near-horizontal angle. The needle can also be mounted on a 1 mL syringe.\nMake a cut in the dura on the far-right (or far-left) side of the craniotomy.\nNote: Before proceeding make sure that there is no bleeding from ruptured veins in the dura or in the brain. Use repeated application of aCSF and removal of the fluid using absorbent triangles to stop bleedings and keep the brain/dura clean.",
    "Position one tip of a fine curved forceps (Dumont type #7-curved) under the dura, avoiding any nearby blood vessels, and carefully remove the dura in one fluent motion.\nNote: The dura mater may be attached to the underlying brain tissue, which could cause damage when the dura is removed too quickly. In such cases, keep the dura well hydrated with aCSF and advance removal of the dura in small steps.\nOptional: Create a well using UV-curing Optibond primer and dental composite around the craniotomy and fill with aCSF to prevent dehydration of the brain tissue.\nPause point: After exposing the brain tissue a break can be taken, as long as the brain tissue stays moist. However, because of the reduction in brain tissue temperature and the slow reduction in health of the brain following a craniotomy it is recommended to directly continue with whole-cell recordings. The success rate of establishing whole-cell recordings has been shown to decrease over time.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] To stabilize brain temperature one could consider to use constant perfusion of the craniotomy with 37°C aCSF9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] as this may prolong the time the brain tissue stays healthy. This is especially recommended when recording from superficial brain areas.\nWhole-cell recordings with visual stimulation\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIn this section whole-cell recordings will be performed targeting neurons in the SC. Visual responses will be measured in current-clamp mode, which allows for characterization of visually-evoked excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs or IPSPs). While the coordinates indicated in this protocol are aimed at the SC, it is recommended to establish that recordings are indeed made from SC neurons. Inspecting the location of biocytin-filled neurons post-hoc will indicate where the targeted neurons are located.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2292-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Methods for visual stimulation in head-fixed, anesthetized mice",
    "(A) Full-field light flashes are delivered to the eyes using LEDs. LEDs of the same color (green) are placed on top of the eyes and enable stimulation of each eye individually.\n(B) Visual stimulation using a haploscope and monitors on each side enables more complex visual stimuli to be presented to the eyes independently.\nNote: There are different visual stimulation techniques available to measure visual processing in SC cells. Most studies use a monitor positioned in front of a mouse to present visual stimuli. For binocular stimulation experiments we use two methods. Firstly, calibrated brief full-field LED flashes can be used to activate retinal ganglion cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The LEDs are of the same color and we use green, since this color maximally activates the M-opsin-expressing cones in the mouse retina.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Secondly, more complex visual stimuli can be projected on the eyes via monitors placed on either side of the mouse (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). This latter method enables a vast range of visual stimulus protocols, including full-screen flashes, moving gratings, moving stimuli. Importantly, stimuli can be presented directly in the receptive field of the cell.\nPrepare the recording and visual stimulation equipment.\nPosition a chloride-coated reference electrode with thick Ag/AgCl pellet under the neck skin at the back of the incision.\nPrepare the visual stimuli (choose one):\nApply continuous voltages to the LEDs so that they emit dim light. Place the LEDs on top of the eyes, making sure that the light illumination is restricted to the eyes only. Remove continuous voltage to the LEDs after they have been correctly positioned.\nPlace the haploscope mirrors in front of the mouse with the snout lightly touching the edge.",
    "Note: A laser pointer can be used to check whether the position of the mirrors correctly reflects the visual images on the screens to the eyes.\nPrepare the recording electrode.\nBack-fill an electrode with ICS and attach the electrode to the pipette holder.\nEstablish high positive pressure (>200 mbar), measured by a barometric pressure meter connected to the air tubing system. We establish this by depressing the plunger of a 10 mL syringe connected to the tubing system.\nPosition the recording electrode above the SC.\nWith the patch-clamp amplifier in ‘Voltage Clamp’ (command voltage disabled or set to 0 mV), run a continuous ‘test-pulse’ protocol (e.g., 50 ms ON/OFF, 10 mV step).\nNote: We use an Axon MultiClamp 700A patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) connected to an ITC-18 digitizer (Instrutech), but newer versions of hardware are also available (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Current and voltage signals are recorded on a Macintosh computer running Axograph at 20 kHz. A MP-285 micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument) is used to control the electrode position.\nRemove the aCSF from the brain tissue using absorbent triangles.\nWith the micromanipulator set to the coarse speed setting, position the electrode to ∼300 μm above the brain surface.\nAdjust the micromanipulator to the fine speed setting and advance the electrode vertically downward until the tip reaches the surface.\nNote: Contact between the electrode and the brain surface can be detected as a sudden increase in resistance as visualized by the data acquisition software. Right before the electrode tip touches the surface, monitor the computer screen to determine when contact is made.\nSet the micromanipulator coordinates to ‘0’.\nAdvance the electrode vertically (∼25 μm/s speed) through the tissue until a depth of 200 μm.",
    "Rehydrate the brain tissue by placing a drop of aCSF on the brain surface. Evaluate the quality of the electrode. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nMeasure the electrode resistance and replace the electrode if the resistance is lower than 4 MΩ or higher than 7 MΩ.\nNote: We have observed that electrodes with resistances between 5.5 and 7 MΩ are most effective for in vivo recordings from neurons in the SC.\nAdvance the electrode to a depth of ∼1,000 μm (∼25 μm/s speed) and adjust the pressure to ∼20 mbar using the mouth.\nNote: The exact depth of the dorsal surface of the SC is dependent on the anteroposterior and mediolateral position of the electrode, and the degree to which the brain tissue is displaced by the advancing electrode. We have observed that at recording coordinates of 0.8 mm anterior to Lambda and 0.7 mm lateral to midline, the dorsal surface of SC is located at a depth of ∼1,000 μm.\nSearch for neurons (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2292-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Current and voltage responses during different stages of whole-cell recording\n(A) Searching for neurons is done in voltage-clamp mode, while monitoring the current during a test pulse. Proximity of a neuron is evident by an increase in resistance at the electrode tip, visible as a reduction of test pulse current. Removal of pressure and applying a holding voltage (Vholding) of -70 mV leads to gigaseal formation. Brief suction pulses (combined if necessary with a short zap) break the neuronal membrane at the electrode tip, after which the whole-cell configuration is reached.\n(B) Negative current pulses in current-clamp mode are used to determine the compensation for the voltage drop due to series resistance (arrows) using bridge balance (BB) control.",
    "(C) Active current is injected to compensate for the capacitance in the input circuit and electrode using capacitance compensation (Cap. comp.). Small transients will become visible in the trace at the start of the negative current injection. Great care should be taken to avoid overcompensation of capacitance, which will induce oscillation and can lead to losing the recording.\nAdvance the electrode in steps of 2 μm (2–4 μm/s) while monitoring changes in current. Frequently adjust the pipette offset to zero and keep the pressure at ∼20 mbar.\nNote: The proximity of a neuron is typically indicated by a sharp and sudden >50% drop in the test pulse current amplitude, reflecting a sudden increase in resistance. The experimenter also often observes a certain ‘vertical wobble’ in the test pulse current amplitude.\nEstablish a gigaseal connection.\nAs soon as above indications are observed, advance another 2–4 μm and quickly release positive pressure and apply mild negative pressure (less than -15 mbar).\nSet the command voltage to -70 mV early on, as this helps to establish the gigaseal, and gradually release the negative pressure as the resistance approaches 1 GΩ.\nCritical: An ideal gigaseal should form within a few seconds after releasing pressure and starting suction. The time it takes to form the gigaseal is an indication of the strength of suction needed to go whole-cell in the subsequent steps. Fast gigaseal formations generally open at lower suction strengths than those that take >10 s. Discard neurons that do not reach a gigaseal or the gigaseal takes a very long to form (>30 s) as this may indicate debris between the cell membrane and the pipette tip and these recordings will typically have a high access resistance.",
    "Note: If no gigaseal is formed replace the patch electrode and repeat steps 10–13. Do not attempt to record from other neurons with the same electrode, as once the positive pressure is released the electrode tip will become contaminated.\nIf a gigaseal forms, compensate for the fast and slow capacitance transients in the cell-attached configuration.\nGo into the whole-cell configuration. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nApply short pulses of negative suction of increasing magnitude either by mouth or using a syringe to rupture the cell membrane.\nNote: The strength/duration of suction needed to rupture the membrane varies, but the time it takes for a gigaseal to form provides a clue. Fast gigaseals (i.e., good seal/no contamination) generally require less suction than slow gigaseals (i.e., sub-optimal seal/possible contamination). Practice and repetition will let the experimenter develop an instinct for how much suction to use. Generally suction is between -20 and -150 mbar in magnitude and applied in short pulses (∼1 s duration).\nA successful ‘break-in’ can be witnessed by the occurrence of large capacitance transients (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, bottom). Start with gentle suction pulses and increase as required.\nOptional: If it is not possible to break in using suction alone, suction pulses can be combined with use of the ‘Zap’ function (1 V DC current for 100 μs) to rupture the membrane.\nOptional: Record a voltage step protocol (e.g., 100 ms ON/OFF, 10 mV step) to determine the access resistance, input resistance and cell membrane capacitance values. We generally find access resistance values of 104.7 ± 78.3 MΩ (mean ± SD; range 18.2–503.8 MΩ), input resistance values of 207.4 ± 130.9 MΩ (range 14.8–602.7 MΩ) and membrane capacitance values of 34.8 ± 27.3 pF (range 8.9–124.7 pF; n = 40 neurons).\nOptimize amplifier settings and characterize the neuron in current clamp mode. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].",
    "Set the patch-clamp amplifier to ‘Current Clamp’ and run a negative current step protocol (e.g., 10 ms ON/OFF, -100 pA) or use the ‘Tuning’ controls.\nCompensate for the voltage drop due to series resistance by adjusting the ‘Bridge Balance’ controls (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCompensate for the capacitance of the amplifier and electrode by applying ‘Capacitance Neutralisation/Compensation’. Increase until an overshoot at the onset of the voltage change to a current pulse becomes visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Avoid overcompensating which will lead to oscillations and potentially the loss of the recording.\nCharacterize the voltage response of the cell using a current step protocol comprising of both negative and positive current injections (e.g., 500 ms ON/OFF, -200 pA to +600 pA with 50 pA steps).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2292-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example of in vivo whole-cell recordings during LED stimulation of the eyes\n(A) Schematic overview of the experimental setup for making recordings from superior colliculus neurons.\n(B–E) Electrophysiological properties can be determined from a neuron’s response to negative and positive current steps. This may aid in determining the cell type of the recorded neurons. Examples of responses to a current step-protocol are shown for the four major cell types in the superficial SC.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\n(F) Example of a biocytin-filled neuron in the superficial gray layer (SuG) of SC visualized using DAB staining.

The timing of 20 ms LED flashes is indicated in green. Ten raw traces are plotted (gray) with the average superimposed. Spikes are trimmed and no holding current was injected.\nNote: This will allow cell type classification based electrophysiological parameters, such as input resistance and action potential shape, which differ between cell types (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B–5E).11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nRecord responses to visual stimulation.",
    "Record neuronal responses during alternating visual stimulation of the left, right or both eyes to study visually evoked synaptic inputs.\nFor LED stimulation we use 20 ms flashes with a 2,980 ms inter-trial interval (ITI) with 50 repetitions per stimulus condition.\nFor visual stimulation using the haploscope and monitors we use 1.5 s stimulation with a 2.5 s ITI for 50 repetitions per stimulus condition.\nCritical: Allow for sufficient time between stimuli to avoid responses being influenced by preceding stimuli.\nRetract the electrode.\nSwitch to voltage clamp mode at -70 mV and release any (positive or negative) air pressure from the system.\nRun a continuous ‘test-pulse’ protocol to monitor the access to the neuron (e.g., 50 ms ON/OFF, 10 mV step).\nSlowly retract the pipette to preserve the health of the neuron.\nRetract the pipette in the vertical direction only. Initially retract 4–6 μm and wait for 5 s to allow the neuron to recover.\nRetract slowly (2 μm per 3 s) while monitoring the current trace.\nNote: During a successful retraction after a few steps the neuron should close, coinciding with the formation of an outside-out patch at the tip of the pipette. This is reflected in the trace similar to the formation of a gigaseal (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nContinue retracting the pipette (∼10 μm per second) until the tip of the pipette is > 200 μm away from the neuron, then retract as per usual speed.\nCritical: The mouse should be kept alive for at least 30 min after the recording to allow sufficient diffusion of biocytin through all parts of the neuron.",
    "Note: Passive diffusion of biocytin during recordings allows for visualization of neuronal morphology after the experiment. Multiple neurons can be recorded in the same hemisphere/animal, but this may complicate correct identification after post-hoc labeling of biocytin. If recording from multiple neurons in the same hemisphere, we recommend leaving sufficient distance in the mediolateral axis between recording sites (>200 μm).\nTranscardial perfusion and removing the brain\nTiming: 30 min\nAt the end of the experiment the mouse is transcardially perfused with fixative and the brain is extracted. The fixed tissue is then sliced and processed to allow visualization of the morphology of biocytin-filled cells.\nPrepare the perfusion setup.\nFill one 50 mL syringe with 30 mL 1× PBS.\nFill one 50 mL syringe with 30 mL 4% PFA solution.\nPlace the following tools and consumables by the perfusion area:\nSurgical scissors, iris scissors, spatula, forceps (Dumont type #3), Graefe forceps, hemostat, Castroviejo scissors, drip tray with dissecting board, four 25G needles, tissues and a butterfly needle.\nFill a 15 mL Falcon tube with 4% PFA solution in which to put the brain for post-fixation.\nConnect the butterfly needle and the syringe with PBS.\nRinse the tubing with PBS and make sure no air bubbles are present.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an overdose of pentobarbitone solution.\nInject pentobarbitone solution (150 mg/kg) IP.\nVolume to inject (diluted pentobarbitone solution; 60 mg/mL) = weight of mouse in grams × 0.0025 mL. Inject 0.05 mL of pentobarbitone solution in a 20 g mouse.\nAssess the depth of anesthesia using the paw withdrawal reflex after 3 min. Inject additional pentobarbitone solution if the withdrawal reflex persists.",
    "Note: In case the mouse stops breathing, immediately perform the paw withdrawal reflex and proceed with the perfusion. The perfusion is preferably carried out while the heart is still beating as this aids the distribution of fixative through the body.\nPerform transcardial perfusion.\nPlace the mouse on its back and secure the limbs in an extended position by pinning to a dissecting board with 25-gauge needle tips.\nOpen the abdominal wall below the rib cage using forceps and iris scissors.\nCarefully cut open the diaphragm in a lateral direction and cut upward through the ribs on both sides. Be careful not to rupture/damage the heart.\nAttach the hemostat to the skin flap and place above the mouse to keep the rib cage open.\nExpose the heart and insert the butterfly needle into the left ventricle and make a cut in the right atrium with the Castroviejo scissors.\nExert moderate pressure on the plunger to rinse the heart and blood vessels with PBS.\nCritical: A quick color change of the liver from red to gray indicates successful perfusion. If the lungs fill up and fluid comes out of the snout, the needle has penetrated the right ventricle or the cut in the right atrium is too small. In this case reinsert the needle into the left ventricle or make a new cut in the right atrium.\nAfter the syringe with PBS is empty connect the syringe with 4% PFA and continue the perfusion.\nNote: Effective perfusion with fresh 4% PFA solution will lead to general muscle contractions.\nAssess the stiffness of the tail and front paws after the perfusion has been completed. Successful perfusion results in stiff limbs.\nCritical: PFA is toxic. Work in a laboratory safety cabinet and wear appropriate PPE.",
    "Alternatives: A peristaltic perfusion pump (e.g., MINIPULS 3, F155006, Gilson) can be used instead of 50 mL syringes to deliver a more consistent and controlled flow.\nExtract the brain.

Cut through the skull via the left lateral side of the head in an anterior to posterior direction, while maintaining a dorsal position to avoid damaging the brain.\nUse the Graefe forceps to remove the skull by inserting the forceps under the left side of the skull and pulling the entire bone in one motion over to the right side of the head. Remove remaining pieces of skull and loose pieces of dura mater.\nCarefully position a spatula under the brain and lift the brain out of the skull base while inverting the skull.\nCut through the optic nerves using the iris scissors and place the brain in a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 4% PFA.\nPause point: Post-fix the brain between 2 and 24 h at 4°C. It is recommended that brains are post-fixed for 24 h if the perfusion was not optimally performed, often visible as filled blood vessels in the brain tissue.\nPrepare the brain for sectioning.\nPlace the brain in a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 30% sucrose (w/v) in 1× PBS solution and store at 4°C.",
    "Wait until the brain fully sinks (usually after 24 h) in sucrose solution.\nPause point: Brains that fully sink in 30% sucrose can be stored long-term in −20°C.\nPreparing coronal sections and peroxidase histochemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nFixed brains are processed with a cryostat to create sections. All sections around the recording coordinates will undergo peroxidase histochemistry and the recorded neuron will be visualized using light microscopy.\nPrepare the cryostat (chamber temperature of −20°C) and prepare the brain.\nSecure a cutting blade in the cryostat blade holder. We use an angle of 10°–15° to cut coronal SC slices. Set the slice thickness to 100 μm.\nFill a 12-well plate with 1× PBS using a Pasteur pipette.\nFill a petri dish with a layer of 1× PBS.\nPrepare and freeze the brain.\nTake the brain out of the 30% sucrose solution using Graefe forceps and place it on a filter paper in a petri dish.\nUse a razor blade to make a cut perpendicular to the horizontal plane to remove the anterior part of the brain. To cut the entire SC, make the cut around -2 mm from Bregma.\nCut off the cerebellum and brainstem at -5 to -6 mm from Bregma.\nOptional: Flip the brain forward and make a small cut in the ventral corner on the left or right side to distinguish the left and right hemispheres in the resulting sections.\nPlace the brain in a cryomold and immerse in Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound. Place the cryomold on the rapid freezing platform in the cutting chamber (if available) and wait until frozen.\nMount and slice the brain.\nRemove the frozen brain from the cryomold.\nApply a layer of OCT on the cryostat chuck and place the frozen brain on the chuck.",
    "Apply a layer of OCT around the edges of the brain. Place the chuck in the cryostat chamber and wait until frozen.\nPosition the chuck firmly onto the moving platform in the cryostat chamber.\nPosition the cutting blade close to the brain and start slicing from the posterior end of the brain forward, until the posterior end of SC is reached around -4.8 mm from Bregma.\nCut 100 μm coronal brain sections and transport the slices from the cryostat chamber to a 12-well plate using a fine brush. Slice until the anterior end of SC is reached -3 mm to Bregma. Place the slices in order of sectioning.\nPause point: Brain slices can be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C for one week.\nAlternatives: Brains can also be processed using a vibratome or (freezing) microtome to obtain coronal sections of 100 μm. Other approaches may have advantages over a cryostat, such as lower costs and greater ease of use. When cutting at room temperature (20°C–22°C) with a vibratome or microtome, brains are also not required to have undergone pre-treatment with 30% sucrose. The choice of technique depends on equipment availability and the requirements of the study.\nPerform day 1 of the peroxidase histochemistry (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nWash sections 5 × 5 min in 1 mL 1× PBS per well in a 12-well plate placed on an orbital shaker.\nPlace sections in 1% H2O2 in 1× PBS for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity.\nWash sections 3 × 10 min in 1× PBS.\nPlace sections in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate sections overnight (16–24 h) in ABC solution on an orbital shaker at room temperature (20°C–22°C).",
    "Note: This protocol is a modification of the staining procedure listed in the manufacturer’s instructions for the Vectastain Elite ABC-HRP kit (Vector Laboratories).\nPause point: Incubate sections overnight (16–24 h) in ABC solution on an orbital shaker at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nPerform day 2 of the histochemistry.\nWash sections 3 × 5 min in 1 mL 1× PBS per well. Meanwhile, prepare the 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution as per kit instructions[href=https://vectorlabs.com/media/folio3/productattachments/protocol/VL_SK-4100_UserGuide_LBL02267.pdf] (DAB Substrate Kit, Vector Laboratories), with the exception of PBS instead of Millipore water.\nIncubate the sections in the DAB solution for 5–10 min on an orbital shaker at room temperature (20°C–22°C) while monitoring the slices.\nNote: Keep the slices longer in the DAB solution for darker labeling.\nWash the slices 3 × 5 min in 1× PBS.\nMount the slices on microscope slides and cover using curing mounting medium (VectaMount) and a coverslip.\nCritical: DAB is toxic and a known mutagenic. Work in a laboratory safety cabinet and wear appropriate PPE. Discard the used DAB solution in a bottle containing 5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach), but be aware that this does not remove its mutagenic properties. Further discard DAB according to laboratory procedures for hazardous chemicals.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nInspect the slices under a bright-field microscope.
