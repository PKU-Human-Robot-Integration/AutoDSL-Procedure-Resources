    "Procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at RWTH Aachen University, AZ 84-02.04.2012.A234.\nNOTE: The procedure is demonstrated using adult male wild type mice with CD1 background. Keep the mice in a specialized laboratory unit before and after the surgery, assuring proper access to food, specialized veterinary control, and treatment. If the animals are purchased from outside, allow one-week acclimatization before performing surgery.\n1. Preparation of the Donor\nUse sterile materials and instruments to maintain sterile conditions during surgery to avoid infections.\nAnesthetize each mouse with a mixture of 1.5% by volume isoflurane and 100% oxygen through a face mask. Lay the mouse on a platform in the supine position and tape all its legs to the operating table. Check its reflexes by pinching the hind feet to be sure that the mouse is sufficiently anesthetized. Place ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent drying during the procedure.\nRemove all hair from the abdomen using a depilatory gel or use a shaver. Perform the operation under sterile conditions. Disinfect the abdomen with alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine and sterile water.\nRemove the donor aorta via a midline abdominal incision with scissors or scalpel. Retract the bowel manually to the right. Gently manually reflect the intestines over to the side using powder free gloves.\nPlace the bowel on a piece of gauze wetted with saline to keep it moist.\nDissect away the abdominal aorta very carefully from the surrounding tissue using a blunt dissection with tweezers.\nSeparate the segment of the aorta between the renal arteries and its bifurcation from the vena cava with tweezers.\nSecure all the small branches of this segment very carefully using 11-0 monofilament single suture.",
    "Before removing the aorta, inject 0.5 milliliters (mL) of saline solution containing 50 U of heparin into the inferior vena cava.\nLet the donor animal exsanguinate after the segment of the aorta is removed.\nRinse the graft fully with saline and then transfer it immediately to a container of ice-cold saline.\n2. Preparation of the Recipient\nAnesthetize the recipient animal with a mixture of 1.5% by volume isoflurane and 100% oxygen through a face mask, then remove the hair and disinfect (Section 1). Make a mid-line incision from the xiphoid to the pelvis with a scalpel and retract the abdominal walls. Place ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during the procedure.\nWrap the bowel in saline solution moistened gauze and displace very gently to the animal's right.\nDissect the infrarenal aorta free between the renal arteries proximally and the bifurcation distally with tweezers.\nSecure all the small branches of this segment very carefully using 11-0 monofilament single suture.\nClamp the proximal and distal portions of the aorta with a 6-0 single silk suture.\nDivide the aorta in the middle between the clamps and irrigate the cut ends with heparinized saline to flush the lumen open.\nPlace the graft in the orthotopic position with the feeding vessel end inserted into the receiving vessel followed by suturing with 11-0 monofilament taking care to avoid any torsion of the aorta by properly aligning the donor and recipient (Figure 1)10.\nCarefully release the ligatures after conducting an inspection of the anastomosis. Release the distal clamp first. This results in low pressure holding the walls together prior to releasing the proximal high-pressure side.\nPerfuse the graft immediately and check for a visible pulse. Gently remove the remnants of the silk. The optimal overlap length between donor and recipient aorta is 1-2 mm.",
    "Return the abdominal contents to the abdominal cavity and close the whole wound with a running 3-0 polyglycolic acid suture.\nGive the mouse buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously (SC)) before terminating anesthesia.\nDo not leave an animal unattended until it is fully conscious. Manage pain therapy with buprenophine 0.05 mg/kg body weight administered SC three times a day for three days after the operation as approved by the institutional oversight body.\nFor tissue harvesting, anesthetize the recipient mice as described above and flush the vessels with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% formaldehyde/PBS, (pH = 7.4) by cardiac puncture. Remove the grafts gently. After overnight fixation in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, process specimens further and embed in paraffin."
