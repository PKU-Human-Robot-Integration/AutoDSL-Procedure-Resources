    "1. Induction of Apoptosis\nCentrifuge cell sample at 300 x g for 5 min and discard supernatant to remove any pre-existing cell debris.\n\tNOTE: When using adherent cells, seed cells in advance and wash with 1x phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) prior to apoptosis induction.\nDetermine cell number and collect cells.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the assay post-isolation, we recommend a starting cell number of at least 1 x 107 cells.\nResuspend in complete media (respective medium containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin mixture) for a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nAliquot ~2 x 106 cells per well of a 6 well plate.\nTo induce apoptosis, remove the plate lid and irradiate cells at 150 mJ/cm2 using a UV irradiator. This should take approximately 30-60 s.\n\tNOTE: Prior to irradiation, ensure that ~0.5 x 106 cells are retained for the 'Untreated' cell control.\n\tNOTE: Apoptosis can also be induced via other methods such as anti-Fas or serum starvation6.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2-8 hours, depending on the cell line.\nUsing a bench top light microscope, visualize cells to confirm the presence of apoptotic morphologies, such as blebbing, apoptopodia formation, and ApoBD formation.\n\tNOTE: 40X magnification is sufficient\nUsing a P1000 pipette, pipette and collect apoptotic samples.\nWash the plate with 1x PBS and combine with remaining sample to ensure maximum yield.\nCollect ~1/10th for the 'Whole Apoptotic Sample' (WAS) control.\nCollect the 'Untreated' sample.\nCentrifuge both the WAS and Untreated samples at 3,000 x g for 6 min.\nResuspend in 1 mL of 1x PBS and set aside on ice.\nFor ApoBD isolation, continue to either step 2 or 3 with the remaining apoptotic sample.\n2. ApoBD Isolation via FACS\nCentrifuge the entire sample at 3,000 x g for 6 min.",
    "Remove the majority of the supernatant without disrupting the pellet.\nResuspend in a staining solution containing 1 mL of 1x A5 binding buffer, 75 µL of A5-FITC, and 2 µL of TO-PRO-3 per 1x107 cells.\nIncubate sample in the dark at room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd 1-2 mL of 1x A5 binding buffer and centrifuge sample at 3,000 x g for 6 min to remove excess stain.\n\tNOTE: For mixed cell populations or tissue samples, perform an antibody staining step using a combination of cell type-specific markers in 1x A5 binding buffer and incubate on ice for 20 min (or as per manufacturer's protocol) before centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 6 min.\nResuspend sample pellet in 3 mL of FACS buffer (1x PBS, 1x A5 binding buffer, 10% FSC, 2 mM EDTA) per 1x107 cells.\nFilter through a 70 µm cell strainer into a round-bottom, polypropylene (flow cytometry) tube and keep samples on ice and in the dark.\nTurn on the FACS machine and perform standard set up using a 100 µm nozzle, perform the drop delay, and ensure a stable stream.\nLoad the sample and set acquisition speed to ~1000 events/s.\nAdjust FSC, SSC, APC (TO-PRO-3) and FITC (A5) voltages and position events within the FACS plots to ensure populations can be clearly separated.\nRecord 20,000 events.\nSet up a gating strategy as in part 4.\nIn the sort layout, add the final ApoBD gate as the desired sorting population.\nBegin acquiring the sample and perform a test sort by collecting 5,000-10,000 ApoBDs into a new tube containing ~250 µL FACS buffer.\nPerform a system back flush and load sorted ApoBDs.\nAcquire and record test-sort ApoBDs.\nCheck that the ApoBD purity is ~99% by comparing FSC (y-axis) vs A5 (x-axis events).",
    "NOTE: A5 staining may reduce slightly when re-analyzing samples due to laser bleaching.\nOnce high purity is achieved, load original sample and continue sorting until the desired number of ApoBDs has been obtained.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, dual sorting can be performed to simultaneously isolate ApoCells and ApoBDs.\n\tNOTE: When sorting over a long period of time, we recommend incubating the collection tube at 4 °C.\nOnce sorting is complete, collect a small portion of post-sort ApoBDs, post-sort ApoCells, Untreated, and WAS to validate apoptosis and confirm post-sort purity.\n\tNOTE: Although the test-sort and post-sort purity should not differ significantly, this is based on the stream settings and stability.\n3. ApoBD Isolation via Differential Centrifugation\nCentrifuge the remaining apoptotic sample at 300 x g for 10 min.\nCollect the supernatant, leaving ~500 µL to avoid disrupting the cell pellet, and add into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nRemove the remaining 500 µL and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of 1x PBS (this represents the 'ApoCell-enriched fraction'.\nCentrifuge the collected supernatant for 20 min at 3,000 g.\nCheck for a pellet and carefully remove the supernatant (the supernatant may contain small extracellular vesicles including microvesicles and exosomes).\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS (this represents the 'ApoBD-enriched' fraction)\nCollect 100 µL of each Viable, WAS, ApoCell-enriched, and ApoBD-enriched samples in a new round-bottom, polystyrene (flow cytometry) tube.\nAdd 100 µL of stain containing 2x A5 binding buffer, 1:100 A5-FITC, and 1:1,000 TO-PRO-3\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 min in the dark.\nAnalyze samples by flow cytometry, using the gating strategy as described above to validate the successful induction of apoptosis and purity of the ApoBD-enriched fraction.\n4. Flow Cytometry Gating Strategy",
    "Plot TO-PRO-3 (y-axis) against FSC (x-axis) to separate necrotic cells (TO-PRO-3high) from all other non-permeabilized events (TO-PRO-3low/intermediate).\nSelect all non-permeabilized events and plot SSC against A5. Gate two populations including population 1 (P1), SSCintermediate/high, A5low/intermediate cells and population 2 (P2), all other events.\nFrom P2, plot TO-PRO-3 against A5 and select A5intermediate/high events to exclude all cell debris.\nSelect all A5 positive events and plot FSC against A5. Separate ApoBDs (FSClow) from ApoCells (FSCintermediate/high).\n\tNOTE: When gating ApoBDs for ApoBD isolation via the FACS-based approach, we recommend a final step by selecting ApoBDs and comparing TO-PRO-3 to A5 and selecting all events. This ensures that the final sorting gate uses fluorescence rather than FSC/SSC parameters.\nFor viable cell analysis, select P1 and perform one of two gating strategies. For general viable cell analysis, plot FSC against A5 and select all FSCintermediate/high cells, therefore removing remaining cell debris. Alternatively, for in-depth analysis, viable cells can be separated from A5- early ApoCells by plotting TO-PRO-3 against FSC. Select TO-PRO-3low, FSCintermediate/high viable cells and TO-PRO-3intermediate, FSCintermediate/high A5- early ApoCells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
