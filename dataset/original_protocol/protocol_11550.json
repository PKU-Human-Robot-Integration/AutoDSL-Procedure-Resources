  "title": "A Within-subjects Experimental Protocol to Assess the Effects of Social Input on Infant EEG",
  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the Boston University Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n1. Recruitment\nIdentify potential participants through participant databases (if available), through publicly available state birth records, through online advertising, and through face-to-face recruitment events.\nCall potential participants and invite them to participate in the study.\n\t\nExplain that the study is looking at social experiences and how they relate to brain development.\nExplain that a visit would involve using EEG to get a measure of the infant's brain activity using a stretchy cap made of soft sponges. Explain that the infant would sit on the parent's lap while looking at pictures on a computer monitor and playing peekaboo with an experimenter, and that this allows to see brain activity.\nExplain how long the visit lasts and that a visit can be scheduled whenever is most convenient for the parent, based on the infant's schedule. Provide information about transportation options (e.g., whether there is free parking or reimbursement for public transportation) and about compensation (if any is provided).\n2. Running a Visit\nNOTE: Schedule the visit for a time when the infant will be alert and well rested. Have two experimenters available. The lead experimenter will do the net application and administer the conditions during EEG recording. The second experimenter will help with net application, control the EEG recording and stimulus presentation computers, and monitor the raw EEG as it is recorded.\nLaboratory set up\n\t\nRecord the EEG in an electrically shielded booth if possible to prevent interference with the EEG signal.",
    "In the booth, place two adjacent computer monitors (measuring 14.5 x 12 inches) on a table. Place the monitors 18 inches apart. Place a chair (where the parent and infant will sit) 24 inches from the table and facing the computer monitors. Leave at least 24 inches between the table and the back wall of the booth (so the experimenter can stand behind the table facing the infant). Ensure that the chair and table are at a height such that the computer monitors are at the infant's eye level.\nPosition two speakers on the ground on either side of the table, directed towards the chair where the parent and infant will sit.\nPosition a tripod video camera under the table and facing up so that the infant's face is in clear view.\nHang an opaque curtain immediately behind the table for the experimenter to stand behind to be hidden from the infant's view during the nonsocial and language-only conditions.\nPlace a rattle, a small stuffed animal, and cereal in the booth. Use the same rattle and animal for all participants.\nWelcoming the family\n\t\nOn arrival, offer the parent an opportunity to feed and change the infant before beginning.\nObtain informed parental consent.\nExplain the EEG and paradigm.\n\t\t\nExplain that EEG involves a net made of soft sponges that are soaked in warm water, which measures brain activity. Explain that the EEG net does not emit anything, but just measures electrical activity released from the neurons in the brain communicating with each other.\nTell the parent that the infant will look at pictures on a screen and interact with the experimenter.",
    "Explain that sometimes the experimenter will be behind the curtain, hidden from view. Emphasize that it is important for the parent not to be social with the infant, such as talking to the infant or making face-to-face contact.\nExplain that 20 min can be a long time and that if the infant gets bored or fussy, the parent can give him a toy (e.g., the rattle or stuffed animal) or cereal.\nExplain the net application procedure to the parent.\n\t\t\nInform the parent that the EEG net is like a swim cap and that infants typically do not like hats.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When the experimenter puts the net on, most infants will fuss and try to pull the net off. Tell the parent not to worry and emphasize that this is normal and infants typically get used to the net, stop crying and calm down quickly.\nExplain to the parent that their help is important to make sure the infant does not pull on the net and if the infant moves their arms up towards their head, to gently push their arms down and away from the net.\nExplain that the experimenter is very practiced at putting the net on quickly. Explain that the second experimenter will distract the infant during net application using the rattle and stuffed animal.\nAsk the parent if they would like a picture taken of their infant wearing the EEG net to take home.\nInform the parent that there may be faint pressure marks that look like little circles on the infant's head when the net is removed, but that they will fade quickly. Also, mention that the infant's hair will be slightly damp.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For this study, parents were compensated $40.\nNet application",
    "Measure the infant's head in cm at the widest point using a soft tape measure. Choose the appropriate sized EEG net.\nMicrowave an electrolyte solution (6 cc potassium chloride (KCl)/L distilled water) for 3 min. Add a teaspoon of baby shampoo.\nSoak the correct-sized high-density net (this study used a 128-lead net; a 64-lead net is also suitable) for 10 min in the heated electrolyte solution. This will facilitate electrical contact between the scalp and electrodes.\nFill pipettes with the electrolyte solution and put in the booth.\nUse a towel to pat off excess water from the net to prevent bridging. Carry the net on the towel and show the parent the net. Have the parent touch the net (if interested).\nHave the parent sit on the chair in the booth with the infant on their lap.\n\t\t\nRemind the parent that the infant may become upset and that this is normal. Remind the parent that the second experimenter will distract the infant with the rattle and stuffed animal. Remind the parent to keep the infant from touching or pulling on the net. Remind the parent not to engage in social interaction with the infant during EEG recording.\nPlace both hands inside the net, gently stretch the net and lower it so that it fits over the infant's head. Place the Cz electrode on the vertex of the head. Keep both hands inside the net during positioning.\nWhen the net is positioned on the infant's head, remove hands from inside the net and tighten the chinstrap so that the net is secure. Inspect the net for correct positioning and make adjustments as necessary.",
    "Measure electrode impedance using the EEG recording software (each electrode should be below 50 kÎ©, if using a high impedance system). Administer the electrolyte solution using the pipettes by squeezing a few drops on to the electrodes with poor contact. If necessary, gently move the infant's hair so that the electrodes are in better contact with the scalp.\nOnce impedance is at an acceptable level, save the impedance information.\nEEG Recording\n\t\nRecording Parameters\n\t\t\nRecord data according to manufacturer specifications. Represented data were sampled from all channels at 500 Hz.\nStimuli presentation\n\t\t\nPresent a series of 10 color photographs of objects on the computer monitors for 13.0 - 14.5 s, at variable interstimulus intervals (0.5 - 2.0 s). Display the same photograph on both screens. Present the photographs as similar sizes in middle of the screens (see supplementary materials for list of stimuli in each block and stimuli files).\n\t\t\tNOTE: A subtle and brief clicking sound alerts the experimenter to stimuli onset. The photographs are of common nonsocial objects (e.g., flower, glove) and the same 10 categories of objects are repeated across blocks. The individual objects within a category vary in terms of color. Their distribution across the blocks is counterbalanced and the same colors are represented in each block to maintain consistency in the infant's viewing experience (see Figure 1 for example).\nConditions\n\t\t\nGo into the booth behind the computer screens and table and face the infant.\nOpen the curtain during the joint attention and social engagement conditions so that the infant can see the experimenter. Close the curtain so the experimenter is hidden from the infant's view during the nonsocial and language-only conditions.",
    "Administer four conditions: nonsocial, joint attention, social engagement, and language-only. Present each condition twice for a total of eight blocks. Administer each block for 2.5 min to maintain infant attention.\n\t\t\nAdminister the blocks in the following sequence: social engagement, nonsocial, joint attention, language-only, joint attention, nonsocial, social engagement, and language-only. Present a white screen on the computers and use a bell sound to alert the experimenter to start the next block.\n\t\t\t\nFor social engagement, lean on the table between the computer monitors. Be face-to-face with the infant. Maintain the infant's attention so that the infant does not focus on the screens (as identical objects continue to appear). Look only at the infant throughout the condition. Do not look or point at the screens.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: If the infant points at the pictures, try to pull the infant's attention back, but do not follow the infant's gaze. Ensure that joint attention is not present. Have a positive affect and respond contingently. In each block, sing children's songs with hand motions, (e.g., Itsy Bitsy Spider, The Wheels on the Bus) and play peek-a-boo. Adapt as necessary to maintain the infant's interest. Maintain positive affect throughout the block.\nFor the nonsocial condition, go behind the curtain (to be hidden from infant view). Stay silent throughout the condition.\nFor the joint attention condition, lean on the table between the computer monitors and be face-to-face with the infant. Direct the infant's attention to the pictures on the monitors and comment on the pictures. Follow the specified script of utterances and pointing directions for each trial as described in Table 1. See Table 1 for list of blocks and specific utterances for each trial.",
    "At the start of each trial, make eye contact with the infant and continue bids for the infant's attention until the infant looks. Turn in a pre-specified direction (left or right), look at the appropriate screen, and point to the picture while simultaneously saying the specific utterance for each trial.\nLook back at the infant and continue to alternate gaze between the picture and the infant's face until the trial is over.\nFor the language-only condition, go behind the curtain and comment on the pictures on the computer screens. Follow the specified utterances listed in Table 1 for each trial (Table 1; language-only). Use the same tone of voice as in the joint attention condition.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55596/55596fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Example of a Nonsocial Object.

    "Save the EEG recording file. In this paradigm, the EEG recording file is automatically saved when the program automatically closes at the end of the paradigm.\nEEG Data Processing15,16\nNotch filter the raw EEG data at 60 Hz and then apply a highpass filter of 0.1 Hz.\nSegment the raw data into shorter length epochs.\n\t\tNOTE: This paradigm segmented the data into 30 s epochs, as the goal was to assess infant EEG power during different states of engagement. If too much data loss is a concern, shorter epochs such as 1 - 3 s could be used.\nPerform artifact rejection on each epoch. Exclude electrodes from each epoch if the root mean square of the EEG voltage data exceeded 175 ÂµV or if the amplifier is saturated at any time within the epoch. Reject epochs with >20 excluded electrodes from further analyses. Re-reference the EEG to the average reference of the remaining electrodes.\nUse a Fourier transformation to compute EEG power for each electrode in each epoch for the chosen frequency bands. Compute EEG power averages for regions of interest. Average good epochs to yield average power values for each condition, region, and frequency band. Log transform power values using the natural log.\n\t\tNOTE: For infants to have useable EEG data in a given condition, they must have at least one useable 30 s epoch of data in that condition. This protocol was developed using a high-density EEG system with liquid-saline based electrodes (see the Materials Table). Other EEG systems are appropriate, but specific steps may vary.\nCoding of Infant Looking Behavior16",
    "Use behavioral coding software with the ability to code videos frame-by-frame (every 30th of a second). Add codes to the video file of each infant to mark when each block starts (e.g., use the bell sound that indicates block transitions in the paradigm).\n\t\tNOTE: For the joint attention blocks, mark the beginning of each trial (use the trial onset sound that is in the paradigm) and the direction that the experimenter points (left or right; use the script which outlines which direction the experimenter points on each trial).\nCode where infants look during the social engagement and joint attention conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, in this study some of the codes (or events) included: \"infant looking at the left screen\", \"infant looking at the right screen\", \"infant looking at the experimenter\", \"infant looking at parent's face\", \"infant looking elsewhere\" (e.g., when infant is looking anywhere other than the screens, experimenter, or parent), and \"missing\" (when the infant was out of camera view). Train coders to a reliability threshold of 0.80 kappa and double code 20% of videos to assess inter-rater reliability. Use coding software to assess the extent to which the two coders code the same looking behaviors with the same durations. Use a tolerance window of one second so that onset or offset of looking behaviors within one second of each other will be scored as an agreement.\nQuantify infant looking behavior in the social engagement condition.\n\t\t\nOut of total time of the social engagement blocks, compute the percentage of time the infant looked at the experimenter (time looking at the experimenter/total time of the social engagement blocks x 100). This variable indexes the extent to which the infant attended to the experimenter, thus engaging in the social engagement condition as intended.",
    "Quantify infant looking behavior in the joint attention condition.\n\t\t\nAssess the percentage of time the infant followed the experimenter's point and gaze.\n\t\t\t\nSelect the time in seconds of the video when the experimenter pointed left. Within that time window, compute the time the infant looked at the left screen and the right screen. Next, select the time when the experimenter pointed right and compute the time the infant looked at the left screen and the right screen.\nSum the time the infant looked at the correct screen (i.e. the time when the experimenter pointed left and the infant looked at the left screen and the time when the experimenter pointed right and the infant looked at the right screen).\nSum the time the infant looked at the incorrect screen (i.e. the time when the experimenter pointed left and the infant looked at the right screen and the time when the experimenter pointed right and the infant looked at the left screen).\nCompute the percentage of time that the infant looked at the correct screen and the incorrect screen, out of the total looking time for the joint attention blocks. This variable indexes the extent to which the infant accurately followed the experimenter's bids for joint attention.\nCompute the percentage of time out of the joint attention blocks that the infant looked at the experimenter.\nSum the percentage of time the infant spent looking at the correct screen and the experimenter. This variable indexes the extent to which the infant engaged in joint attention.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
