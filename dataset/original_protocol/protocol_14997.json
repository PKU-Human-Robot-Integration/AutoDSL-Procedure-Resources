    "1. Mice and Preconditioning\nNote: All mice were maintained in pathogen-free conditions and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Massachusetts General Hospital. All surgery should be performed under sterile condition using autoclaved sterile equipment. Mx1-Cre15, Rosa26-loxP-stop-loxP-EYFP (Rosa-YFP), and Rosa26-loxP-stop-loxP-tdTomato (Rosa-Tomato), were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Osteocalcin-GFP mice were provided by Dr. Henry Kronenberg. For the quantitative analysis of OSPC migration and proliferation in vivo, Mx1-Cre+Rosa-YFP+ (single color-reporter) mice were used. For more detailed tracking of their differentiation into Osteocalcin+ mature osteoblasts, we used trigenic Mx1-Cre+Rosa-Tomato+Ocn-GFP+ mice.\nTo label Mx1+ cells in vivo, prepare polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pIpC, 2.5 mg/ml) in sterile PBS solution and inject 200 μl for 20 g of Mx1-Cre+ reporter mouse intraperitoneally once every other day for 10 days.\nTo eliminate resident Mx1+ hematopoietic cells, irradiate mice with a single dose of 9.5 Gy. After 24 hr of irradiation, transplant wild type bone marrow cells (1x106 cells/mouse) intravenously16. Note: Since Mx1-inducible cells include hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic-derived osteoclasts, the elimination of Mx1+ hematopoietic cells improves the imaging quality and quantitation of Mx1+ osteogenic cells.\nAfter bone marrow transplantation, monitor animals for four to six weeks in order to achieve a successful repopulation of donor marrow cells.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 50 μl of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg, xylazine 12 mg/kg body weight) using an IACUC-approved procedure. Note: Duration of the effect may be extended by an additional dose of ketamine/xylazine.\nDetermine if the mouse is fully anesthetized by the lack of response to toe and/or tail pinches. (Optional) When the mouse is anesthetized, secure an isoflurane gas mask over the nose by taping. Adjust the level of isoflurane to ensure the animal is fully sedated.",
    "Clip the scalp hair using an electric trimmer or small scissors. Remove the hair fragments and sterilize the exposed skin with 70% alcohol swab. Apply tear gel to prevent corneal dehydration.\n3. Microfracture Injury\nAfter ensuring the animal is fully sedated, make a single reverse L-shaped incision to open the scalp skin. Briefly, make a first transverse incision (less than 1 cm) starting from one ear to another ear. Turn ~60° and continue to incise toward the nose until ~2-3 mm away from nose. Note: This incision minimizes the formation of scar tissues above the area to be imaged.\nSeparate the skin flaps by pulling toward the sides with forceps. Both frontal bones and the intersection of sagittal and coronal sutures should be clearly exposed.\nClean the open surface by flushing with sterile PBS and gentle wiping with sterile gauze or cotton swabs until all the residual hairs are eliminated.\nTo generate microfractures on the calvarium, hold the mouse head with one hand and a 30 G needle with another hand. Make a micro-puncture (~0.2 mm diameter wound with < 1 mm depth) on the left frontal bone near the intersection of the sagittal and coronal sutures by inserting the tip of a 30 G needle with gentle pressure and twisting motion. Caution: It is critical to avoid the needle from penetrating into the brain, thereby minimizing bleeding and tissue damage.\nSwitch to a bigger needle (20 or 25 G) and widen the puncture hole by twisting the needle (~0.5 mm diameter).\nRepeat step 3.3-3.5 to generate second puncture on the contralateral frontal bone.\nWipe out the injured spots by continuous dropping of PBS until the bleeding stops.\n\tNote: Bleeding on fracture sites will interfere with appropriate imaging and induce scar formation.",
    "Apply a drop of sterile physiological saline solution or 2% Methocel on the skull to avoid drying. Note:  Do not allow the skull surface to dry, which will reduce image clarity. It is important to use a sufficient amount of gel or saline to cover the area.\n4. Intravital Imaging\n(Optional) Before imaging, some mice are injected with a vascular dye to visualize the blood vessels. Inject retro-orbitally with 20 μl of non-targeted Qtracker 705 (2 μM solution in 50 mM borate buffer) diluted in 80 ml of PBS. Use an insulin syringe to minimize reagent waste. If the signal is not sufficiently bright, additional amounts might be required.\nTurn on the scanner. Note: A polygon-based laser scanner allows simultaneous multi-channel image acquisition at video rate (30 frames per sec). Video rate scanning is very important for live animal imaging.\nTurn on the multi-photon laser (femto-second titanium:sapphire laser). Set the wavelength to 880 nm and adjust the power for second harmonic generation imaging (440 nm) of the bone. For GFP and tdTomato excitation, turn on the 491 nm and 561 nm solid-state lasers.\nTurn on the PMT (photomultiplier tube) detectors for each signal (a 435 ± 20 nm band-pass filter for second harmonic generation, a 528 ± 19 nm band-pass filter for GFP, and 590 ± 20 for tdTomato.) (Optional) Use a 638 nm helium–neon laser and a PMT with a 695 ± 27.5 nm band-pass filter to detect Qtracker 705 signal.\nPlace the animal on a XYZ-axis motorized microscope stage. Keep the mouse in the most comfortable position with an electric heating pad to help maintain body temperature (this reduces the risk of animal loss). Use tape to hold the mouse to minimize movement during imaging and to keep the imaged area as horizontal as possible.",
    "Apply a drop of warm 2% methylcellulose gel or physiological saline solution on the skull to avoid drying. Put a cover glass on the imaging area. Use a low magnification lens (30x water-immersion objective with 0.9 NA) to scan the calvaria.\nUsing the XYZ-axis controller, find the surface of calvaria by detecting the SHG signal from bones  and identify a crucial landmark location, such as the intersection between the sagittal sutures and coronal sutures. Acquire an image and record the XYZ coordinates.\nContinue to search for the location of the injury by observing SHG and fluorescence signals.\nWhen injury sites or the region of interest are found, acquire an image of the best focal plane containing SHG and fluorescence signals from the cells of interest. Save XYZ coordinates and the distance to the intersection of the sagittal and coronal sutures to define their precise location for the next rounds of imaging.\nTo collect 3D cellular and bone structures of fracture injury, record images by Z-stacks (2 - 5 μm interval) with ~100 μm depth from endosteal bone surface. After the completion of imaging of one side of injury, repeat imaging process for next injury sites.\n5. Post Operation Procedures\nAfter imaging, rinse imaging site with sterile saline solution to remove the methylcellulose gel from the skull. Using a sterile cotton swab, apply a small amount of triple antibiotic ointment on the surface. Cover the skin flaps and re-close the scalp by surgical suturing. This can be done with a hypoallergenic suturing thread (absorbable polyglactin suture) and 5-0 size suture needle. Caution: Good suturing technique minimizes scar formation.",
    "Treat all animals with IP injection of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine every 12 hr for 48 hr following surgery. Keep animals in a warm recovery chamber until they regain sufficient consciousness. After 3 to 5 days, reopen the suture and repeat intravital imaging steps to track the cellular change during fracture healing.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
