Overview of the genotype-phenotype screening procedure and hit validation steps\n(A) Generation of inducible immortalized dendritic cells (iniDC) that stably express the CRISPR-CAS9 nuclease.\n(B) CRISPR RNA (crRNA) library screening for the identification of genes involved in the iniDC functions.\n(C) Generation of gene-edited iniDC clones and validation of DC function alteration.\n(D) Principle of DC immunotherapy based on in vitro differentiated iniDC (de-iniDC).\nTransduction of iniDCs with CRISPR CAS9 lentiviral particles\nCollect 70–80% confluent cultured iniDCs by trypsinizing with TrypLE™ Express for 5 min at 37°C. Collect cell suspension and centrifugate at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) and resuspend the cell pellet with freshly prepared TT medium for cell counting.\nAdjust the cell density to 2×105 viable cells/mL, seed 1 mL cell suspension in TT medium (equal to 2×105 cells) into a 12-well plate and let the cells adapt overnight (>12 h) in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nThe next day, remove the medium and replace with 0.5 mL RPMI 1640. Calculate the volume of lentiviral particles to be used for transduction at a MOI of 0.3 as detailed below: Volume = 0.3 MOI × cell number (2×105)/lentiviral titer (107TU/mL) = 0.006 mL",
    "Thaw the lentiviral particles on ice, gently mix the solution by pipetting up and down several times, and drop 6 μL into the 0.5 mL iniDC culture. Gently shake the plate to homogenize lentiviral particles in the iniDC culture, and put the plate back to the cell culture incubator.\nSix hours after adding the lentiviral particles, complement the medium with additional 1.5 mL TT medium, gently shake to mix, and put the plate back to the CO2 incubator.\nNote: It is recommended to stain the cells with trypan blue before cell counting, which is helpful to obtain a precise number of viable cells. Once the lentiviral particles are thawed and mixed, aliquot the solution into single use quantities and store them at −80°C. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. For all transduction and transfection procedures, it is recommended to use medium without Pen/Strep or blasticidin which potentially affects cellular viability and transduction efficacy according to the manufactures’ instructions.\nAntibiotic selection of transfected cells and single cell sorting for cloning\nAt 48 h post transduction, replace the medium with fresh CG medium containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin and maintain the selection. Once the blasticidin resistant cells recover to normal proliferation (in about 3 days) and reach confluency in the 12-well plate (in 5–7 days, yield 2–5 × 105 cells), aspirate old media and add 500 μL prewarmed TrypLE™ Express reagent for 5 min to trypsinize the cells. Gently flush the cell layer with a P1000 pipette to confirm detachment, stop the trypsinization with 500 μL prewarmed CG medium and transfer all content into a T25 tissue culture flask containing 10 mL complete DC growth medium (supplemented with 10 μg/mL blasticidin) and keep the cells in the cell culture incubator.",
    "When blasticidin resistant cells reach 70%–80% confluency in the T25 flask, aspirate used media and add 3 mL prewarmed TrypLE™ Express reagent for 5 min to detach adherent cells. Gently agitate the T25 flask to confirm cellular detachment, stop the trypsinization with 5 mL of prewarmed CG medium and transfer all content into a 15 mL falcon tube. Spin at 500 g at room temperature, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet with 5 mL CG medium. To sort single cell clones:\nPass the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer to make a single cell suspension, count cellular density and adjust it to 1×106 cells/mL with CG medium containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin.\nPrepare 96-well flat bottom tissue culture-treated microplates by adding 150 μL/well of the CG medium containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin.\nTransfer 1 mL single cell suspension to a FACS tube, add 1 μL DAPI solution (1 mg/mL) as a viability dye, and immediately proceed to flowcytometric sorting.\nSingle cell sorting can be performed with a BD FACSAria™ Fusion Cell Sorter with the help of an experienced operator. Debris and dead cells are excluded based on forward / side scatter characteristics and DAPI staining, while healthy cells are seeded in 96-well flat-bottom tissue-culture plates prepared in step (ii) at one cell/well. Keep the cells in a cell culture incubator and observe plates regularly until visible clones arise.",
    "Once clones have grown in the 96-well plates, discard the culture supernatant and add 50 μL/well TrypLE™ Express and incubate for 5 min at 37°C. Gently flush the cell layer with a P200 pipette to confirm cellular detachment, stop the trypsinization by adding 100 μL CG medium containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin, resuspend cells by pipetting up-and-down several times, transfer clones to a new 96-well plate and incubate further in a cell culture incubator until cells reach confluency. This step allows transfering clones to a single 96 well plate which facilitates the handling in subsequent steps.\nWhen cells reach confluency, trypsinize them as described in step (c), and stop with 150 μL CG medium containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin. Resuspend cells by pipetting up-and-down several times, transfer 180 μL cell suspension into a new 96-well plate that will be used as the assay plate; transfer the remaining cellular suspension into another 96-well plate and supply 180 μL/well CG medium (containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin) to obtain the seed plate for preserving clones. The assay plate is cultured overnight (>12 h) before protein extraction and WB detection of CAS9 nuclease expression.\nNote: The procedure in step 1 will likely yield 30%–50% transduction efficiency, which means more than 50% of cell death is expected at day 3 after blasticidin treatment, and resistant cells will recover normal proliferation.\nCritical: It is important to maintain blasticidin throughout the selection of single clones to minimize the number of CAS9 nuclease-negative clones in further verification steps. Due to the risk of contamination during the sorting process, it is recommended to use double amount of Pen/Strep in the CG medium for this step. Visually detectable clones form 2–3 weeks after sorting. Evaporation should be controlled and supplementation of fresh CG medium might be necessary.",
    "Pause point: If the western blotting verification will take longer, the seed plates can be frozen at −80°C. Collect clones as described above and transfer cell suspensions into 96-well V-shape plate. Centrifuge the V-shape plates, discard supernatant, then resuspend the cell pellets with 100 μL FBS containing 10% DMSO and immediately put them into −80°C.\nDetection of CAS9 expression levels in different clones.\nCentrifugate the assay plate at 500 g for 5 min at RT, discard the supernatant and invert the plate on a paper tissue to remove remaining liquid. Add 100 μL rapid WB protein preparation buffer per well, shake the plate on a plate shaker at maximum speed (approximately 1300 rpm, on a Heidolph TITRAMAX 100R shaker) for 5 min, transfer the solution into a 96-well PCR plate, and heat the samples to 100°C for 5 min.\nSubject the denatured proteins to standard western blotting for the detection of CAS9 nuclease expression level. A loading control such as β-actin should be detected on the same blot.\nClones that express a high level of CAS9 can be selected for further testing.\nNote: All western blotting data exemplified here was obtained by using the Invitrogen NuPAGE® electrophoresis system, including all equipment and reagents as listed in the NuPAGE® technical guidelines (Manual part no. IM-1001/MAN0003188). Alternative products might be used, but methodology might need to be adjusted. Representative data provided in this protocol was obtained using a mouse monoclonal antibody to CAS9 (dilution 1:2,000, incubation overnight (>12 h) at 4°C) and an HRP mouse monoclonal antibody to β-actin (dilution 1:20,000, incubation for 2 h at room temperature).\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nValidation of gene editing efficacy of selected CAS9-expressing iniDC clones",
    "Based on CAS9-expression detected by WB, label selected clones that express high level of CAS9 in the seed plates. Trypsinize those clones as described in step 2c and stop trypsin with 150 μL CG medium, transfer all content to one well of a 6-well plate, supply 2 mL of CG medium (containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin), and maintain in an incubator until cells reach 50%–70% confluency.\nTrypsinize the clones in 6-well plates with 0.5 mL/well prewarmed TrypLE™ Express for 5 min at room temperature. Gently flush the cell layer with a P1000 pipette to confirm cellular detachment, and stop trypsin with 1.5 mL TT-DF medium. For each clone, transfer 0.4 mL/well of cell suspension into a new 6-well plate, supply 1.6 mL/well CG medium (containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin) to obtain the seed plate for clone preservation. The remaining cell suspension is transferred to another 6-well plate (assay plate), supplied with 1 mL TT-DF medium, and let adapt in the incubator overnight (>12 h) for crRNA transfection.\nThe next day, remove used medium and replace with 2 mL fresh TT-DF medium.\nPrepare the transfection mixture:\nadd 5.5 μL of previously prepared 10 μM crRNA targeting the murine high mobility group box 1 (Hmgb1) gene or the same quantity of non-targeting control gRNA #1, plus 5.5 μL of 10 μM tracrRNA to 100 μL of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, mix by pipetting up-and-down to get the guidance RNA transfection complex;\nadd 10 μL of DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent to 100 μL of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, mix gently by slowly pipetting up-and-down;\n5 min later, gently mix the solutions i and ii and incubate for another 20 min at room temperature to obtain transfection complexes.",
    "Add 200 μL of transfection mix dropwise into 2 mL CAS9-expressing iniDC culture, and gently agitate the plate. Incubate transfected cells in a cell culture incubator for 72 h to achieve gene editing.\nAs described in step 3, prepare homogenate from post-transfected cells with 250 μL/well of the rapid WB protein preparation buffer. Subject the denatured proteins to WB detection of HMGB1 expression with β-actin as a loading control. Clones that show the highest Hmgb1 knockout efficiency should be selected and expanded for the following screening campaign while maintaining blasticidin (10 μg/mL) selection pressure.\nCritical: Make sure that all plasticware is RNase-free verified, and treat the bench as well as instruments with the RNase away spray or other surface RNase decontaminants before handling RNA to avoid degradation of crRNA and tracrRNA oligos.\nNote: This is a general description for the preparation of a transfection mixture, which is designed for the transfection of one single well of a 6-well plate. The conditions (final concentration of crRNA and tracrRNA are 25 nM used with 10 μL of DharmaFECT 1 per well) are optimized for an efficient transfection of 1×106 iniDC CAS9 in 2 mL of TT-DF medium. For the test of gene-editing efficacy in iniDC CAS9 clones, we suggest using gRNA targeting the murine Hmgb1 gene (positive control) together with non-targeting control gRNA #1 as a negative control (please see Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/921-Mmc1.extension] for details). For the detection of HMGB1 expression, the rabbit polyclonal antibody to HMGB1 can be diluted at 1:2,000 for an overnight (>12 h) incubation at 4°C.",
    "Note: CRISPR crRNA transfection can also be performed with freshly prepared CAS9-expressing iniDCs (iniDC CAS9). In such case, collect cultured iniDC CAS9 by trypsinization and adjust cell suspension to a concentration of 5×105/mL with TT-DF medium. Seed 2 mL of the suspension to 6-well tissue culture plates (equal to 1×106 cells/well) and proceed to the described transfection steps. We recommend to use the TT-DF medium for transfection which allows for simultaneous differentiation and facilitates downstream functional assays with the gene-modified de-iniDCs. However, transfection can be performed with TT medium if clones need to be sorted.\nThe protocol established for HMGB1 (positive control) and non-targeting control crRNAs (negative controls) can be applied for the genetic screening of genes of interest using the clone that we selected based on the high CAS9 activity, as detailed below.\nNote: The knockout of genes of interest needs to be confirmed by western blot or sequencing of crRNA-targeted region in the genomic DNA when cell lines are being established for further evaluation.\nGenetic screening with non-pooled guidance RNAs by means of an in vitro antigen cross-presentation assay\nTiming: 7 days.\nThis major step describes a typical small to medium-scale genetic screening based on the iniDC CAS9 cells, with non-pooled synthetic crRNA + tracrRNA transfection to obtain specific gene knockout (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The exemplified screening uses the OVA antigen cross-presentation assay as functional readouts.\nAlternatives: This step focuses on identifying genes that are involved in the antigen cross presentation ability of DCs, but it can be adapted to other DC phenotypical or functional assays as described below, after the ini-DC CAS9 cells are transfected with the crRNA library.",
    "Prepare the verified iniDC CAS9 clones and expand cells according to the number of gRNAs that need to be transfected. For example, a 96-well crRNA library plate typically holds 80 distinct crRNAs which together with 8 non-targeting controls (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) results in 88 transfections. Considering the dead volume, a total number of iniDC CAS9 cells for seeding >90 wells should be prepared, i.e., a minimum of 90 × 5×105/mL × 2 mL = 9 ×107 viable iniDC CAS9 cells for each crRNA plate. Seed 1×106 de-iniDC CAS9 cells/well in 2 mL DF medium into 6-well tissue-culture plates. Label plates and wells according to the gRNA to be transfected and incubate the cells in a cell culture incubator\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/921-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Scheme of synthetic CRISPR RNA (crRNA) transfection in 96-well plate format\nA typical gRNA library plate containing 80 synthetic crRNAs of interest (as described in Steps 5 to 9) is employed for screening. It is suggested to use 8 wells of non-targeting control gRNA #1 for screening one plate to obtain a sufficient number of unmodified cells as controls. Key steps include 1) preparation of the trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) and distribution into a 96-well plate at 100 μL/well to be complemented with equal quantities of specific gRNAs or non-targeting control gRNA; 2) preparation of DharmaFECT #1 transfection reagent; 3) addition of 100 μL/well transfection reagent to the tracrRNA/gRNA complexes, followed by incubation to obtain transfection-ready solutions; 4) transfer of 200 μL transfection mix to 1×106 iniDC CSA9 cells.\nPrepare the crRNA-tracrRNA mixture:",
    "Calculate the total number of crRNAs to be transfected, and prepare a pool of 10 μM tracrRNA (100 μL/well) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium to cover all the crRNA to be transfected. For example, to transfect a crRNA library from one 96-well plate, which usually covers 80 genes (columns 1 and 12 are commonly reserved for controls, please refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for a typical plate layout), tracrRNA sufficient for 90 transfections should be prepared. Dilute 495 μL of tracrRNA working stock in 9 mL serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in a RNase-free falcon tube, mix by pipetting up-and-down, and distribute 100 μL/well to the corresponding 80 wells in a new 96-well plate. Additional tracrRNA solution will be loaded to the rest wells for the non-targeting control gRNA. Then add 5.5 μL of each specific crRNAs (from library plates) or the non-targeting control crRNA to their corresponding wells in the tracrRNA plate, mix by pipetting up-and-down with a multichannel, and incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nPrepare DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent in equal amounts i.e., 900 μL of DharmaFECT 1 in 9 mL serum-free RPMI1640 medium. Incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 100 μL of DharmaFECT 1 solution to each well contains 100 μL of the crRNA-tracrRNA mixture, mix by pipetting up-and-down and incubate 20 min at room temperature to obtain transfection complexes.\nDirectly drop the 200 μL transfection mix to the designated 6-well plates. Gently shake the plates to homogenize transfection efficacy across the well and incubate the plates in a cell culture incubator for 3 days.\nRemove supernatant and replace with 2 mL of fresh DF medium, incubate at 37°C for 24 h to let the transfected cells recover from transfection.",
    "On the 4th day post transfection, remove 1 mL of the medium from each well, detach cells by scraping with dispensable cell lifters and transfer the cellular suspension to a 96-deep-well plate. Centrifuge the plate at 500 g for 5 min, remove supernatant and resuspended cell pellets with 500 μL fresh DF medium for cell counting. There is a typical yield of 5–7 ×105 cells from each well, which is sufficient for functional assays and/or frozen stocks.\nFor genetic screening the concentration of viable cells (with the average of non-target crRNA transfected wells as a reference) is adjusted to 5×105/mL, and cells are seeded in 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plates in 100 μL/well, equals to 5×104 cells/well, in replicate wells. The in vitro antigen cross-presentation assay can be proceeded as detailed from step 19 to 24. The ELISA quantification of IL-2 in the supernatant of B3Z-DC coculture can be performed as detailed in step 16 and IL-2 concentration will be used as a proxy of DC antigen cross-presentation capability.\nFor data analysis, IL-2 values from crRNA transfected samples are normalized to the average of non-target control crRNA-transfected cells.\nWhen performing transfection in 6 well plates, it is likely to obtain more than enough cells for functional assays. The rest of the cells can be frozen in a 96-well V-shape plate at −80°C, which can be used for further functional screening, or for sorting to select clones that are KO of the gene of interest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). To freeze cells, centrifuge plates for 5 min at 500 g, remove supernatant and rapidly resuspend cell pellets with FBS containing 10% DMSO (100 μL/well), seal the plates and directly transfer to −80°C where the cells can be kept for a maximum of 12 months.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/921-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The analyzed cytokine panel includes pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, IL-12, TNFα, and IL-6 (Cavaillon, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Scheller et al.,2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]) as well as latent TGFβ, that is linked with immunosuppressive functions (Ghiringhelli et al.,2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), which are inhibited in the presence of DEX (Jones et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) yet are released by de-iniDC in response to stimulation with LPS (Richter et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). DC maturation and activation gain of function or loss of function phenotypes are indicated in gene edited de-iniDC by changes in the abundance of the tested cytokines in the cell culture supernatant or the expression of surface co-stimulatory and maturation markers such as CD69, CD80, CD86 as well as CD83 and MHCII, respectively.\nDe-immortalization and stimulation of DC maturation and activation.\nCollect iniDC CAS9 cells and dilute to 5×105 cells/mL with DF medium. Seed 1 mL of cell suspension/well in 12-well tissue culture plates (equal to 5×105 cells/well) and incubate at 37°C for 3 days to obtain differentiated de-iniDC CAS9. Determine the necessary well number needed according to the experimental design including all controls and treatment conditions. A typical experiment includes triplicates for each condition.",
    "Prepare a working solution of LPS by diluting the 1 mg/mL stock at a factor of 1/500 (final concentration 2 μg/mL), recombinant murine TNFα by diluting the 50 μg/mL stock at a factor of 1/1,000 (final concentration 50 ng/mL), and MCA205 lysate to a concentration equal to 5×105 cells/mL, all with the DF medium. Remove used medium and replace with 1 mL of fresh DF medium, working solution of LPS, recombinant TNFα, or the MAC205 lysate as stimuli for DC maturation and activation. Incubate the plates for 16 h at 37°C\nCollect all content of each well by scrapping cells from the well bottom using a plastic cell lifter, transfer the suspension into a 96-deep well round-bottom plate (which holds a maximum of 1.2 mL liquid in each well). Spin the plate at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully aspirate 500 μL of supernatant for the quantification of cytokines by means of ELISA or directly store samples at −20°C for a short period (<1 month) or −80°C for longer period (up to 12 month). Remove the remaining supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet with 200 μL cold PBS, mix thoroughly by pipetting and transfer the cell solution to a 96-well V-shape plate for surface staining with the fluorescently-labeled antibody panel (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), followed by flow cytometric analysis.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_921_11.csv\nThe gating strategy is exemplified in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/921-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Formation of crystals after adding the stop solution indicates over-colorization, which will interfere the interpretation of the results.\nTroubleshooting 2–5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nEvaluation of DC phagocytosis of dying cancer cells\nTiming: 3 days cell differentiation + 6 h handling time.\nThe uptake of (parts of the) dying cancer cells by phagocytic DC provides the basis for tumor-associated antigen transfer from malignant cells to the immune system, thus constitutes an essential step in the generation of anticancer immunity (Galluzzi et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). This major step describes the protocol for the quantification of de-iniDC mediated phagocytosis of dying cancer cells by regular flowcytometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), which allows for the identification of essential genes implicated in the generation of anticancer immunity.\nPrepare de-iniDC and MCA205 cells for co-culture",
    "Collect cultured iniDC cells and dilute to 5×105 cells/mL with DF medium. Seed 1 mL cell suspension/well in 12-well tissue culture plates (equal to 1×105 cells/well) and incubate at 37°C for 3 days to obtain differentiated de-iniDC CAS9. A typical experiment includes triplicates of each condition, determine well numbers according to the experimental design including controls and treatments.\nPrepare MCA205 cells in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks at 1×107 cells/20 mL D-BC medium for crizotinib treatment, and 0.5×107 cells/20 mL D-BC medium for the DMSO control (untreated cells), let adapt overnight (>12 h).\nStain the MCA205 cells with CellTracker blue dye (10 μM diluted in 20 mL serum-free DMEM) for 60 min, then replace with 20 mL D-BC containing 15 μM crizotinib or 0.15% DMSO. Treatment of 18–24 h should yield > 50% apoptotic cells.\nCollect de-iniDCs and MCA205 cells for coculture.\nFor de-iniDCs, remove the culture supernatant by aspirating with a vacuum pump, replace with 1 mL fresh BC medium, and detach adherent cells with a cell lifter. Flush the well bottom with a P1000 pipette, transfer all content into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes (or 96-deep well round-bottom plates), and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant, resuspended each cell pellet with 0.5 mL DF medium for cell counting, and adjust the de-iniDC density to 1×106 viable cells/mL.\nFor MCA205 cells, do not change medium, but directly lift the cell culture layer with a cell scrapper (Corning). Flush the flask bottom with a 10 mL serological pipet, transfer all content into 50 mL falcon tubes, and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant, resuspended each cell pellet with 5 mL DF medium for cell counting, and adjust the MCA205 density to 1×106 total cells/mL.",
    "Note: In these steps we recommend to detach cells by scrapping instead of trypsinization for two reasons: 1) this allows to maintain the phenotypes of differentiated de-iniDCs which will be used immediately for co-incubation with tumor cells; 2) MCA205 cells are treated with crizotinib to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) (Liu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) which promotes their uptake by de-iniDCs, this allows to collect all viable, dying, and dead cells without affecting the exposed ICD hallmarks; this note also explains the reason for reconstituting densities of de-iniDCs based on viable cells and MCA205 on total cells.\nMix 0.2 mL of de-iniDCs and 0.8 mL of MCA205 cells (1 to 4 ratio of DC to MCA205) in tissue culture-treated 12-well plates and co-culture for 2 h in a cell culture incubator. Detach adherent cells with a cell lifter. Flush the well bottom with a P1000 pipette, transfer all content into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube (or 96-deep well round-bottom plate), and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C to collect the cells and proceed to surface staining with fluorescently labeled anti-mouse CD11c antibody:\nCentrifuge cells at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant by vacuum aspiration or by inverting and gently flicking down the plate and remove residual liquid by touching a paper tissue.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 200 μL FACS buffer containing 1/1000 diluted Fc block antibody (anti-CD16/CD32), transfer the cell suspension to a 96-well V-shape plate, and incubate for 10 min at 4°C in the dark.\nSpin the plate at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant by inverting and gently flicking down the plate and remove residual liquid by touching a paper tissue.",
    "Resuspend the pellet with 50 μL of APC-conjugated anti-CD11c antibody (1/100 diluted in FACS buffer), mix by pipetting up-and-down several times and incubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 150 μL of FACS buffer per well and repeat step iii), then resuspend the pellet with 50 μL FACS buffer containing 10% PFA, mix by pipetting up-and-down several times and incubate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 200 μL FACS buffer per well and repeat step iii). Repeat this step twice more to wash out residential PFA.\nResuspend with 100 μL FACS buffer and assess the sample by flow cytometry to quantify the proportion of CD11c and CellTracker double positive events as a proxy for DC mediated phagocytosis.\nNote: It is important to mix and resuspend the cell pellet immediately upon addition of PFA.\nCritical: All steps involving the manipulation of PFA (from sub steps v to vii) should be handled in a chemical foam hood.\nPause point: Fixed samples can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks for flowcytometric analysis.\nEvaluation of DC antigen-cross presentation capability in vitro\nTiming: 3 days cell differentiation + 48 h handling time.\nStrong evidence suggest that DC-mediated antigen cross-presentation is paramount for induction of anticancer immunity (Galluzzi et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). This major step describes the protocol for the evaluation of antigen cross-presentation in vitro using soluble ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Cross-presentation efficiency is measured by the readout of B3Z hybridoma T cell line in terms of interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, which allows for the quantitative comparisons between de-iniDCs with different genotypes",
    "Collect well-differentiated de-iniDCs and dilute to 5×105 cells/mL with DF medium. Seed 100 μL cell suspension/well in 96-well tissue culture U-bottom plates (equal to 5×104 cells/well) and let adapt in the 37°C incubator. A typical experiment includes triplicate wells for each condition, determine well numbers according to designed control or treatments.\nPrepare the 2×OVA working solution by adding 1 mL of the 100 mg/mL stock solution to 50 mL DF medium, and prepare the 2×OVA peptide SIINFEKL working solution by serially diluting the stock solution to 4 ng/mL. Add 100 μL of 2× OVA, 2× SIINFEKL, or non-antigen supplemented DF medium to each well containing the de-iniDCs, gently shake the plate to mix and then incubate the cells for 4 h in the cell culture incubator.

Typical plate design for the in vitro antigen cross-presentation assay including necessary control wells\nDe-iniDCs are seeded in 96-well plates at 5×104 cells/well in 100 μL DF medium, while ovalbumin (OVA) and OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL, SL8) peptide are prepared at 2× concentration for the exemplified plate layout (as described in Step 19). Wells for the ELISA standard curve should be reserved.\nSpin the plate at 500 g for 5 min, discard the supernatant containing OVA, and add 200 μL/well RPMI 1640 medium (without any additives). NO NEED TO MIX at this stage. Spin the plate again at 500 g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat this procedure once, i.e., 2 washes in total.\nPrepare B3Z cells in DF medium at 5×105 cells/mL.\nAfter the last centrifugation, discard the DC supernatant and add 200 μL B3Z cell suspension (in total 1×105 cells) to the DCs. NO NEED TO MIX at this stage.",
    "Incubate for 18 h at 37°C. Spin the plates at 500 g for 5 min and gently aspirate 100 μL supernatant for the quantification of IL-2 secretion as described in step 16, or with a selected commercial ELISA assay.\nTroubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]\nDC in vivo administration for tumor growth control\nTiming: 30 days.\nThis major step describes the establishment of the MCA205 subcutaneous tumors in C57BL/6J mice and the adaptive transfer of ex vivo primed de-iniDCs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). This allows for the evaluation of antitumor efficacy of intratumorally delivered gene-edited de-iniDCs, thus establish a direct link between a genotype and the corresponding antitumor phenotype of DCs.\nBrief technical procedures for the establishment of MCA205 fibrosarcoma are:\nPrepare MCA205 cells in T175 tissue culture flasks at a confluency of 50%–75%, (approximately 3-5×107/flask). Detach cells as described in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]-culture of cells” section, and pass the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL falcon tube to obtain single cell suspension. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature, discard supernatant and resuspend with 10 mL cold PBS, mix well to obtain a homogenous cell suspension for counting, and fill the falcon tube with cold PBS to 50 mL. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature, discard supernatant, and resuspend the pellet with an appropriate volume of cold PBS to adjust the cell concentration to 5×106 cells/mL\nShave the right flank of C57Bl/6 mice (preferably six- to ten-week-old female animals) and subcutaneously inject 100 μL cell suspension under isoflurane anesthesia (day 0). Generally palpable tumors form around day 7.",
    "Prepare de-iniDCs for intratumoral injection. At day 3, collect iniDC CAS9 cells or any gene-modified iniDC CAS9 cells as described in the previous sections, adjust cell density to 1×106/mL in DF medium, put 40 mL cell suspension/150 mm tissue-culture dishes, which equals to 4×107 cells/dish. At day 7, remove used medium and replace with 40 mL of fresh DF medium contains lysate yield from 4×107 MCA205 cells, and incubate for 2 h. Collected de-iniDCs by scrapping the cell culture layer with a plastic cell lifter. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min, resuspend with 10 mL cold PBS, mix to homogeneous suspension and pass through a 70 μm for cell counting, and fill the falcon tube with PBS to 50 mL. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min and resuspend pellet with appropriate volume of cold PBS to adjust cell concentration to 2×107 cells/mL. Keep the cells on ice until injection.\nMeasure the longest dimension and perpendicular dimension of established tumors with a digital caliper, calculate the tumor surface following the formula: longest dimension (mm) × perpendicular dimension (mm) × π/4.",
    "Randomize mice according to their tumor sizes and distribute into groups, containing a vehicle control group (injection of PBS), a parental DC groups (injection of CAS9-expressing de-iniDCs), and other groups for injection of iniDCs with different genotypes. For intratumoral injection, the mouse is subjected to isoflurane anesthesia (2.5% with a flow rate of 1.5 L/min) in an anesthesia box, and is then maintained in an anesthesia mask with the same flow rate of isoflurane, on a heating pad warmed at 37°C. Disinfect the tumor area with 70% ethanol followed by iodine to maintain sterility, and inject 50 μL of de-iniDC suspension or cold PBS (as vehicle control) into the tumor bed. Repeat the de-iniDC administration every 4 days until day 19 (i.e., 4 intratumoral injections per animal in total), and measure the tumor size regularly to generate the growth curve. Mice with tumors exceeding 250 mm2 or with apparent necrotic malignancies need to be euthanized.\nCritical: Mycoplasma contamination will negatively affect tumor formation in immunocompetent mice and need to be avoided. The number of animals in each group and experimental endpoints need to be defined according to the advice and regulations of the local ethics committee."
