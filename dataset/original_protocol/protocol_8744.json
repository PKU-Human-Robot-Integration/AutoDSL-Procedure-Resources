    "The experimental procedures outlined received Institutional ethical approval and are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data were collected from a representative participant who was aware of the procedures and gave his written informed consent.\n1. Instrument Preparation\nClean the skin at the electrode location by shaving, and remove the dirt with alcohol to obtain low impedance (<5 kΩ).\nPlace two AgCl surface electrodes (recording diameter of 10 mm) at 2/3 of the line between the medial condylis of the femur to the medial malleolus for the soleus muscle; on the most prominent bulge of the muscle for the medial gastrocnemius; at 1/3 of the distance along a line between the head of the fibula and the heel for the lateral gastrocnemius; and at 1/3 of the distance along a line between the tip of the fibula and the tip of the medial malleolus for the tibialis anterior muscle, with an interelectrode distance (center-to-center) of 2 cm, according to the SENIAM recommendations30.\n\tNote: The soleus muscle electrodes have to be positioned under the distal insertion of gastrocnemii muscles to ensure that they are not recording activity from the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles (cross-talk).\nPlace a reference electrode in a central position on the same leg (between stimulation and recording sites).\nAdjust the height and the depth of the chair to obtain an ankle angle of 90° (0° = full plantar flexion), so that the soleus and gastrocnemii muscles are not stretched and the H-reflex is not altered11,12.",
    "Set the knee angle at 90° (0° = full knee extension) due to the biarticular nature of the gastrocnemii muscles. However, the optimal ankle angle to perform a maximal voluntary torque of the plantar flexors is 70-80° (0° = full plantar flexion)26. Thus, ankle angle will depend on the parameter of interest (electrophysiological versus mechanical recordings).\n\t\tNote: Regardless of the chosen initial angle, it must remain constant throughout the experiment to standardize neuromuscular excitability11,12,27,28.\nPay particular attention when monitoring the subjects’ posture during the test to maintain constant cortico-vestibular influences on the excitability of the motor pool29.\nFirmly strap the ankle to an ergometer, with the anatomical axis of the joint (external malleolus) aligned with the axis of rotation of the ergometer25.\n\t\nHave the subject exert pressure on a footplate attached to the ergometer to record plantar flexor torque. Keep the foot immobile throughout the experiment so that small changes in torque can be detected.\nNote: Under certain circumstances, the heel may lift slightly off the force plate if the foot and ankle are not secured, which may lead to an incomplete transmission of the torque against the plate. Figure 3 presents a description of the experimental setup.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52974/52974fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Experimental setup. Classical experimental setup to record electromyographic (EMG) and torque signals.\nConnect the electrodes to the amplifier with cables.",
    "Set the sampling rate for torque and EMG measurements to 2-5 kHz. Record the EMG signal using an Analog-to-Digital (AD) conversion system. The signal is displayed on a monitor with a data acquisition system, which instantaneously gives values of several parameters (e.g. maximal value, peak-to-peak amplitude, duration). The spectrum of the EMG signal can range between 5 Hz and 2 kHz frequencies, but is mainly contained between 10 Hz and 1 kHz31. Thus, sampling frequency must be high enough to preserve signal shape during EMG recording. Amplify and filter EMG signals (gain = 500-100) using a bandwidth frequency between 10 Hz and 1 kHz8,21,32.\nPlace the anode for the electrical stimulation over the patellar tendon.\nDetermine the best stimulation site of the posterior tibial nerve to obtain an optimal soleus H reflex for a given intensity, using a hand-held cathode ball electrode in the popliteal fossa. Test several stimulation sites with the cathode ball electrode until a maximal value of the H reflex is reached.\n\t\nRecord tibialis anterior EMG activity to ensure that the common peroneal nerve is not activated to avoid influence from antagonist Ia afferents12. Set the pulse width at 1 msec to provide an optimal activation of the nervous fibers, especially afferent fibers10.\nPlace a self-adhesive AgCl cathode at the location of the stimulation site to ensure constant stimulus condition (e.g. pressure, orientation).\n\tNote: All of these parameters (subject position, electrode location and stimulation site) do not change for the assessment of the different electrophysiological measurements. Only the intensity of the stimulation and the condition (rest versus contraction) vary.\n2. Testing Procedures at Rest\nInstruct the subject to remain relaxed and to keep his/her muscles at rest.",
    "Adjust the stimulation intensity to obtain maximal soleus H-reflex amplitude (Hmax; usual range: 20-50 mA). An M-wave of the soleus muscle can be observed at Hmax intensity.\n\tNote: For repeated measurements (e.g. before and after a fatiguing protocol), the optimal intensity to obtain a Hmax response may vary during the session. As keeping a constant intensity can lead to an underestimation of Hmax amplitude, it is recommended that the experimenter regularly reevaluates Hmax intensity33.\nRecord a minimum of 3 soleus H-reflex responses at this intensity with a minimum interval of 3 sec to avoid post-activation depression34.\n\tNote: Although recording several responses is more suitable due to the particular sensitivity of the H-reflex, a single stimulation may be enough under some circumstances, for example when trying to avoid the effects of rapid recovery (e.g. during a fatiguing protocol).\nIncrease the stimulation intensity to obtain maximal soleus M-wave amplitude (Mmax; usual range: 40-100 mA). Usually, set the increment in stimulation intensity at 2-4 mA, with an interval of 8-10 sec between two stimuli12,35. The desired intensity is reached when Mmax is obtained, and no H-reflex response can be observed.\nSet the final intensity to 120-150% of Mmax stimulus intensity to ensure that the M-wave attains a plateau of its maximal value. This intensity is called supramaximal intensity in the instructions below.\nKeep constant stimulation intensity for soleus M-wave recordings throughout the session.\nRecord 3 soleus M-waves and 3 associated twitch torques at this intensity.\n3. Testing Procedures During Voluntary Contraction\nAs a warm-up, ask the subject to perform 10 brief and non-fatiguing submaximal contractions of the plantar flexor muscles, with a few seconds rest between each of the contractions. At the end of the warm-up, take a minimum 1 min rest to avoid any fatiguing effects11.",
    "Continuously record triceps surae EMG activity. Recording soleus and gastrocnemii muscles allows the analysis of the behavior of different muscle typologies for a single stimulation site24.\nInstruct the subject to perform an isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the plantar flexors. The subject has to push as hard as possible against the ergometer by contracting his plantar flexor muscles. Give visual feedback to the subject during the effort, and standardized verbal encouragement19. The MVC is reached when a plateau is observed.\nDeliver a paired stimulation (100 Hz frequency) at supramaximal intensity during the plateau of the MVC (superimposed doublet), and another paired stimulation when the muscle is fully relaxed immediately after the contraction (potentiated doublet) to evaluate the voluntary activation level. Deliver this paired stimulation through a specific device (e.g. Digitimer D185 MultiPulse Stimulator) or through a stimulation program associated with a single pulse stimulator.\nInstruct the subject to perform a second MVC of the plantar flexor with at least 1 min rest between each trial11. If the peak torque from the second trial is not within 5% of the first, additional trials must be performed36. The greatest torque achieved by the subject is taken as the MVC torque.\n4. Data Analysis\nData Analysis at Rest\n\t\nSelect a time window including the EMG response associated with the twitch at rest (H-wave or M-wave).\nMeasure the peak-to-peak amplitude, peak-to-peak duration, and/or the area of the waves (Figure 4A). If the amplitude is not directly provided by the software, subtract the minimum to the maximum values.\n\t\t\nFor the duration, measure the time frame starting from the maximal peak and ending to the minimal peak. For the area, calculate the integral of EMG signal starting from the beginning of the wave and ending to the end of the wave.",
    "Note: Peak-to-peak amplitude can reflect: 1) neuromuscular transmission, 2) motor unit action potential amplitude and/or 3) temporal dispersion of motor unit action potential37. M-wave duration reflects neuromuscular propagation37.\nFor multiple trials, calculate the average of the waves. If the average cannot be directly provided by the software, use spreadsheet software (e.g. the formula function in a spreadsheet program) to calculate this value from several trials (at least 3).\nSelect the resting twitch.\nMeasure the peak torque associated with the resting twitch (Figure 4B).\nFor multiple trials, calculate the average peak torque of the resting twitches. If the average cannot be directly provided by the software, use spreadsheet software (e.g. the formula function in a spreadsheet program) to calculate this value from the several trials (at least 3).\nRepeat these procedures described in point 4.1.2 for the other desired parameters (contraction time or half-relaxation time). The analysis of twitch parameters provides indications as to the excitation-contraction coupling efficiency17. In particular, contraction time provides an index of contraction kinetics8, which can depend upon the chosen muscle group38.\nCalculate the ratio between the peak torque and the sum of M-waves using spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel), to quantify the electromechanical efficiency (Pt/M). As the mechanical responses evoked by posterior tibial nerve stimulation correspond to the activation of the triceps surae as a whole, amplitudes of soleus and gastrocnemii M-waves must be summed39.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52974/52974fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Explanation of electrophysiological and mechanical responses.

    "Select a 500 msec time window of soleus EMG activity during the plateau of MVC torque including the peak torque but excluding the time between the stimulation artefact and the end of the silent period of EMG. The silent period corresponds to the suppression of the ongoing voluntary EMG activity following stimulation.\nIf the root mean square (RMS) is not directly provided by the software, calculate the RMS to quantify EMG activity using the following formula40: RMSEMG\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52974/52974eq1.jpg\nMeasure or calculate the RMS of Mmax at rest over the duration of the wave.\nCalculate the RMSEMG/RMSMmax ratio using spreadsheet software. RMSEMG value and RMSMmax value have to be selected from the same muscle.\nMeasure the maximal peak torque of the MVC from the baseline of torque at rest to the maximal value of MVC excluding the superimposed torque induced by the doublet stimulation (Figure 5).\nMeasure the superimposed torque induced by the doublet stimulation during the MVC, from the voluntary torque value at the onset of the stimulation to the peak of the evoked response (Figure 5).\nSelect the potentiated doublet.\nMeasure the peak torque associated with the potentiated doublet.\nCalculate the voluntary activation level (VAL) using the following formula40:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52974/52974eq2.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52974/52974fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Measurement of superimposed and potentiated doublet on mechanical signal. To record the superimposed peak torque (Pts), stimulation doublet is evoked during the plateau of isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). To record potentiated peak torque (PtP), stimulation doublet is evoked at rest after the offset of MVC.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
