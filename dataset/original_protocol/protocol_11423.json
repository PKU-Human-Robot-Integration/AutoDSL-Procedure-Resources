    "This method was performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations of the Research Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. Corresponding standard safety measures were followed in each step. For a schematic presentation, please refer to Figure 1.\n1. Cell Culture and Plasmid Construct\nRoutinely maintain the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 unit/mL of penicillin, and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nDigest PLKO.1 plasmid with ApaI and EcoRI for the synthesis of shRNA fragment. Ensure that the oligonucleotide sequence of VHL shRNA vector is CCGGGATCTGGAAGACCACCCAAATCTCGAGA TTTGGGTGGTCTTCCAGATCTTTTTG14.\nThen, mix 20 µΜ system with forward 5 µL of oligo, 5 µL of reverse oligo, 5 µL of 10x NEB buffer and 35 µL of ddH2O together (The total volume is 50 µL). Heat the mixture at 98 °C for 4 min, and slowly cool down to room temperature in a few hours.\nLigate the annealed oligos and PLKO.1 plasmid together with T4 ligase at 4 °C for overnight. 16 h later, add 5 µL of ligation mix into 25 µL competent DH5α cells. Then, screen the successfully ligated plasmids, and verify the inserted fragment by sequencing.\n2. Lentivirus Package and Infection\nIn total, mix 10 µg of the PLKO.1-shVHL or PLKO.1-shScramble vector, 7.5 µg of packing plasmid psPAX2, and 2.5 µg of envelope plasmid pMD2.G in 500 µL of the DMEM media without fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 25 min.\nAdd 7 mLDMEM without FBS to the solution prepared above.\nCulture 293FT cells in the DMEM without FBS in a 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes. Ensure that the number of 293FT cells is 1 x 107 using a cell counter.",
    "Add 1 mL of the solution prepared above to the medium of 293FT cells for transfection.\nNote: The 293FT cell line is derived from the 293F cell line and stably express the SV40 large T antigen. Therefore, it is a suitable host for lentiviral production.\nReplace the culture medium with the DMEM containing 10% FBS after 6 h.\nCollect the media using a pipette at 48 h after transfection.\nNote: The virus exists in the DMEM containing 10% FBS. The dead cells float on the medium. Use 0.45 µm sterile membrane to filter the dead cells and impurities. Generally, there is no need to check multiplicity of infection (MOI). This is to establish a stable cells line. At the last step, all living cells without successful infection will die by puromycin. The shScramble group and HUVEC cells are the control group. Ensure that all the HUVEC cells die with the used puromycin concentration by 72 h. Every well has the same number of cells.\nCulture the HUVEC cells in the lentiviral media for 72 h. Then, add puromycin to the media of the HUVEC cells at a concentration of 2 µg/mL for 24 h. Use HUVEC cells without any treatment as the control group. Ensure that all control cells die by this time.\nNote: The living cells represent a stable cell line of VHL knockdown cells and shSramble cells. The plating density is 5,000/well in 96-well plates.\n3. Generation of Endothelial Cell Spheroids\nTrypsinize the HUVECs cells and resuspend in the DMEM medium with 10% FBS. With a moderate number of cells in a 10-cm culture dish, add 1 mL of typsin-EDTA.",
    "Seed the cells in a 3D round-bottom 96-well plate, at a cell density of 1 × 103 cells/well. Use a well that can accommodate a spheroid of 0.50 µL to suspend the spheroid. Count cells using a cell counter system following the manufacturer's instructions.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 continuously for 72 h. Under these conditions, ensure that the suspended cells form the cell spheroids automatically. Replace half of the culture medium after 36 h.\n4. In vitro Angiogenesis Assay\nThaw the gel solution at 4 °C and dilute it with the reduced serum medium at a dilution ratio of 1:5.\nSuck the spheroids from the DMEM culture medium with a micropipette. After washing the spheroids with 5 mL of the reduced serum medium, suspend the spheroids gently and cautiously in the diluted gel. Ensure that there are no air bubbles.\nEmbed 300 µL of mixed liquid in a 15-well plate. After incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h, add 400 µL the reduced serum medium to each well. Fill sterile water around the wells to generate a humidified environment to hinder evaporation.\nThereafter, culture the plate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 100% humidity for 1 h.\nCarefully aspirate the old medium and replace it by 600 µL of reduced serum medium with 1% endothelial cell growth supplements in each well.\nAfter 12 h or 24 h, take images under an inverted light microscope (40*).\n5. Data Analysis\nUpload the images to an online image analysis platform to obtain sprout length data (Table of Materials).\nOn the webpage, create an account by email.\nThen upload the images by clicking the upload button.\nDownload the result by clicking the download button.",
    "Note: The software will generate the processed image and the data. The data contain five parts: cumulative sprout length, mean sprout length, the standard deviation of sprout length, sprout area and spheroid area. In the processed image, each parameter is outlined in a different color to ease identification in the processed image: Red represents sprouts skeleton, yellow the number of sprouts, blue the sprout structure, white sprout end, and orange spheroid.\nSubscription Required.
