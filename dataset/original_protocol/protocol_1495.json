This method consists of the following steps: (1) thawing, (2) passaging, and (3) cryo-freezing for preservation.\nThawing\nTiming: 10–20 min\nTransfer quickly cryo-frozen vails to a 37°C water bath and thaw cryo-frozen cells in a 37°C water bath until the freezing medium is approximately 70% thawed.\nTransfer the contents of the cryovial into a sterile 15 mL conical tube containing 9 mL of culture media.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 3 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C).\nAspirate and remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of culture medium.\nCritical: Excessive pipetting can damage cells. Gently pipette the cells up and down in the tube a few times.\nAdd the cells to a T-75 flask containing 15 mL of culture media.\nGently move the flask back and forth and side to side to evenly distribute the cells and place the T flask in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nAdd 5 mL of culture media every 3–4 days until the GBM cells are ready for passaging.\nNote: Patient-derived GBM cells (559T, 592T, and 626T) grow in suspension. Over time, the GBM cells aggregate and grow into a spherical shape.\nNote: The first passaging can be performed approximately 10–14 days after thawing. However, the length of time may vary depending on the condition of the cells or the number of frozen cells. The proper passaging time should be checked by continuous microscopic observations. It is recommended that cells be passaged when they reach a sphere size of about 200 μm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images of GBM cells",
    "559T and 592T cell images captured using 4× objective. Scale bars, 200 μm.\nPassaging\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTransfer the entire culture medium from a T-75 flask containing the suspended cells to a 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the conical tube at 200 × g for 3 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C).\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the cells in 500 μL of accumax.\nAlternatives: Accutase (Invitrogen, Cat# 00-4555-56) can be used instead of accumax.\nIncubate for 3 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C).\nFor single cell dissociation, dissociate spheres by gentle pipetting up and down about 20 times.\nAdd 5 mL of media and centrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C).\nAspirate and resuspend cells in 3–5 mL of culture media and add the cell suspension to a T-75 flask containing 20–25 mL media in a 1:5- 1:15 ratio.\nCritical: If there are too many cells, they can stick to the bottom and differentiate. It is important to maintain adequate confluence to avoid losing the original GBM characteristics of the cells. For us, the split ratio was variable. Occasionally, cells grow at different rates, and the split ratio will need to be adjusted.\nGBM cells are ready for the next passaging after 7–14 days.\nNote: Patient-derived GBM cells (559T, 592T, and 626T) grow at different rates. 592T cells grew the fastest and 626T cells grew the slowest. The proper passaging time was confirmed through continuous microscopic observations. It is recommended to passage the cells when they reach a sphere size of approximately 200 μm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAdd 5 mL of culture media every 3–4 days until the GBM cells are ready for passaging.\nCryo-freezing\nTiming: 30–45 min",
    "Prepare the GBM cells dissociated into single cells by accumax using the same method as mentioned above (step 8–13).\nAdd freezing media instead of the culture media depending on the amount of the cells, and gently pipette to evenly mix the suspension.\nNote: Freezing media are prepared by mixing GBM culture media with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The entire culture and storage protocol for GBM does not contain fetal bovine serum (FBS), as this may cause the loss of GBM stemness.\nAliquot 1 mL of cell suspension into each cryovial and place into an isopropanol-containing freezing container.\nPlace the freezing container in a −80°C deep freezer for 24 h.\nTransfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen tank (−135°C) for long-term storage.\nHTS using patient-derived GBM cells\nA fully automated HTS system was used to quickly and efficiently measure the viability of GBM cells against drug treatment. The entire experiment took a total of 5 days. It is possible to implement a fully automated connection from day 1 to day 5 of the test, but this has the disadvantage that the system cannot be used for other purposes during the long-term incubation time. Therefore, to increase system usability, suitable protocols were prepared and operated every day. One test set contains different types of cells with various concentrations of test compound libraries. It is important to determine the reproducibility of the test by repeating 2–3 test sets on different days.\nTotal experimental timing: 5 days\nThe main process and/or brief purpose of the entire HTS assay divided by date are listed below.\nDay 0 (Day before the experiment): Plate coating\nDay 1: Cell seeding\nDay 2: Compound dilution and treatment\nDays 3–4: Incubation\nDay 5: Read out\nDay 0 (the day before the experiment): Plate coating\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "The day before the experiment, Multiflo FX drop-dispenser and EL405 plate washer were used to coat plates. The plate coating protocol was created and scheduled with SAMI EX 4.1 software and performed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The summary of each step is as follows.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plate coating protocol for automated HTS systems\nThe plate coating protocol was created and scheduled using the SAMI EX 4.1 software. The entire process of coating on 30 plates, including the 2 h incubation, takes 3 h and 8 min.\nPrepare a coating solution according to the number of plates to be used.\nLoad 20 μL/well of coating solution into 384-well plates.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for 2 h.\nFollowing incubation, remove the coating solution by aspiration, and wash the wells three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nNote: The MultiFlow FX drop-dispenser has various types of cassettes that can be used (e.g., 1, 5, and 10 μL). The 10 μL cassette was most suitable for dispensing 20 μL of the coating solution. The coating solution was removed with aspiration pins during the EL405 plate washing step. The aspiration pins should be adjusted to an appropriate height so as not to scratch the bottom of the plates. After the washing step is completed, the plates are kept at room temperature (15°C–25°C) and used the following day.\nDay 1: Cell seeding\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "A sufficient amount of cells should be prepared by predicting the number of cells required for the experiment in advance. Cells were maintained and cultured as mentioned above (step 8–16). A Multiflo FX drop-dispenser was used to seed cells into 384-well-plates. The seeding protocol was created and scheduled using the SAMI EX software and was performed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Two different 10 μL cassettes were used to simultaneously separate and dispense wells with and without cells. After dispensing one type of cells into plates, the cassettes were replaced to prevent intercellular contamination. Each step is summarized as follows.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell seeding protocol for automated HTS systems\nThe seeding protocol was created and scheduled using SAMI EX software. It took 1 h and 4 min to seed the three types of cells into 30 plates. When replacing the tip cassette for new cell seeding, the entire system is temporarily paused. The process resumes after the tip cassette is changed.\nNote: All cassettes must be autoclaved prior to use.\nNote: The standard treatment for GBM patients involves surgical removal of the tumor, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). 559T and 592T GBM cells are resistant to TMZ, whereas 626T cells are sensitive. As we aimed to find effective drugs against TMZ resistance, 559T and 592T cells were used for HTS.\nSeed GBM cells in 384-well laminin-fibronectin-coated plates at the following density in 50 μL media/well. A549 cells were seeded into 384-well tissue culture plates. The A549 cell line was used to determine the specificity of the drug to GBM cells. To measure absorption value of the blank solution, cells were not seeded in the first column of each plate.\n559T: 4.5 × 103 cells/well\n592T: 4 × 103 cells/well\nA549: 1.5 × 103 cells/well",
    "Note: Each cells proliferate at different growth rate. The optimal seeding number of each cells was determined based on absorbance value (0.5–1) by Cyto X treatment after 3 days of culture.\nNote: A549 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nUse the plates on which cells are seeded as the assay plates.\nDay 2: Compound dilution and treatment\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe main process for compound dilution and treatment on the second day of the experiment is divided into three steps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A): (Step A) compound aspiration, (Step B) two-step dilution, and (Step C) treatment. Before starting the dilution process, four 384-well plates were prepared: ① compound plate, ② control plate, ③ dilution plate-1, and ④ dilution plate-2. 384-well, PP, and v-bottom plates were used for the compound and control plates, and compounds were prepared at 10 μL/well. It is recommended to use v-bottom plates for compound dilutions because small amounts of chemicals can be accurately aspirated during the dilution step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Compound dilution and treatment\n(A) Step A: Double aspiration of compounds and control compounds. Step B: Two-step dilution. Step C: Treatment of assay plate. All procedures were carried out automatically.\n(B) Final map of the assay plates. The first column of each assay plate was left blank, with wells containing vehicles (0.1% DMSO in cell-free culture media). The second column of the assay plates contained a lethal dose of doxorubicin and was used as a negative control. The 3rd and 4th columns were used for vehicle/positive controls (0.1% DMSO) and the reference compound (4 wells in bottom, approximately 50% viable by 40 nM doxorubicin), respectively. Therefore, only the remaining 360 wells of each plates were used for compound test.",
    "Note: Control plate contains DMSO, and doxorubicin (reference compound). Since DMSO and doxorubicin are treated at the same location on all assay plates, preparing a control plate separately from the compound plate makes repeat process easier. The control plate is used repeatedly until the end of the entire dilution process. See step A in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A for detail.\nNote: For dilution, fill the Plate ③ with 32.3 μL of culture medium and fill the Plate ④ with 81 μL of culture medium as the diluent. MultiFlow FX dispenser is used to fill the diluent. See step B in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A for detail.\nStep A: Aspirate 1 μL from Plates ① and ②.\nStep B: Two-step dilution\nTransfer the aspirated chemicals into Plate ③ and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times at a 20 μL volume setting (33.3-fold dilution).\nTransfer 9 μL from Plate ③ to Plate ④ and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times at a 50 μL volume setting (333-fold dilution).\nNote: Beckman Coulter's Biomek NX 384 liquid handler and 30 μL 384 tips were used for aspiration and two-step dilution procedures. Replace the tips before the Step B-b (step 30) to improve the accuracy of the results.\nStep C: Compound treatment.\nBefore treatment, remove 40 μL of the media from 50 μL of the assay plate using an EL405 plate washer.\nCritical: In the media removal process, it is important to retain 10 μL of media in the assay plate to prevent cell loss or damage.\nRe-add 40 μL of fresh media to the assay plate using a MultiFlo dispenser.",
    "Aspirate diluted chemicals from Plate ④ and sequentially dispense 25 μL to the assay plates seeded with three different cell types. Beckman Coulter's Biomek NX 384 liquid handler and 30 μL 384 tips were used.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 72 h.\nAfter all dilution and treatment processes, each assay plate has a map and concentration, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B. In addition, the reference compound, doxorubicin, is added to four wells at a final concentration of 40 nM in all assay plates and used to observe the accuracy of the experiment. It is recommended to treat all assay plates with a reference compound that can determine the accuracy of the experiment.\nDescription of fully automated HTS system operation for day 2 of the experiment\nThe entire process was divided each day, and the experiment was conducted automatically. A more detailed process of the second-day course is as follows:\nConfiguration of HTS system components\nThe fully automated HTS system is customized with a structure in which various kinds of devices are arranged around the Scara Robot, and two plate shuttles connect the Scara Robot and liquid handlers. The components and arrangements of the HTS system are shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Configuration of HTS system devices\nThe fully automated HTS system is customized with a structure in which various types of devices are arranged around the Scara Robot, and two plate shuttles connect the Scara Robot and liquid handlers.\nConfiguration of the system software\nThe following software was used to operate each of the devices.\nBiomek FX & NX 384 Liquid handler - Biomek software Version: 4.1.(Build: 31.0), Beckman Coulter®\nEL405 plate washer & MultiFlo FX drop dispenser – LHC software Version: 2.18 (build 1), BioTek®",
    "Full system control & schedule – SAMI Workstation EX Version 4.1 (Build 11), Beckman Coulter®\nIn addition to the devices listed above, Scara Robot, Cytomat 2C, Delidder, Hotel Carosel, Plate shaker, Barcode reader, etc., are controlled by the SAMI EX 4.1 software.\nFully automated assay protocol\nThe day 2 protocol was edited using Beckman coulter's SAMI EX version 4.1 schedule software for a fully automated assay process (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Fully automated assay protocol for experimentation on day 2\n(A) Whole step schedule. One family described here is scheduled to run automatically without human intervention. One family represents the automatically diluted compounds and treatments in assay plates seeded with three types of cells. If 10 families are repeated, the process takes about 2 h and 40 min, indicating that a total of 30 assay plates can be tested at once.\n(B) Protocols for the compound dilution and treatment process. The protocol was edited using Beckman coulter's SAMI EX version 4.1 schedule software for fully automated assay process.\nDay 5: End of incubation, read out, finish assay\nTiming: 7–8 h\nAfter incubation on the last day of the assay, the following process was performed to detect the experimental results.\nAdd 5 μL/well of Cyto X using MultiFlo FX dispenser to all plates.\nNote: Cyto X is a product that measures the amount of viable cells using WST-1. WST-1 is reduced by dehydrogenase activity in living cells to give an orange-colored formazan dye, which is soluble in culture media or water. The amount of the formazan dye is directly proportional to the number of living cells. In the case of MTT, it forms crystalline formazan that is not soluble in water. A complicated process of dissolving it using an organic solvent such as DMSO is required for colorimetric detection.",
    "Alternatives: Cell Counting Kit-8 (WST-8 based, Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Cat. No. CK04-01) can be used instead of Cyto X.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 6 h.\nCentrifuge at 130 × g for 1 min.\nMeasure the absorbance at 450 nm using a PerkinElmer Envision plate reader\nNote: Because Cyto X is light sensitive, it is recommended to block it from light to prevent data fluctuations between plates.\nCritical: Before measuring optical density (OD), be sure to centrifuge to remove bubbles.\nCytotoxicity data analysis\nUsing Cyto X data (absorbance value at 450 nm), cytotoxicity (%) was calculated as follows:\n  Cytotoxicity  ( % )  =    (   Abs control  −  Abs blank   )  −  (   Abs sample  −  Abs blank   )     Abs control  −  Abs blank    × 100  \nFor dose-dependent assay, compounds were serially diluted on a semi-logarithmic scale. Experiment was performed independently at least three times. In order to calculate IC50 values, dose-response curve fit was analyzed using Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The input data (concentration vs. triplicates of percentage cytotoxicity) were analyzed by nonlinear regression options with log [inhibitor] vs normalized response – variable slope (four parameters). Differences with P values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.\nHit identification\nThrough three independent HTS and dose-dependent assays, azathioprine was selected as a hit compound to induce GBM cell death (Nam et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). A549 lung cancer cells were used as a comparative group to identify drugs that have a specific effect on GBM. As an effective drug against GBM was found through phenotypic screening, various experiments were conducted to identify the mechanism of action of the selected drug. In the next section of this protocol, we describe how to detect and analyze proteomes that are globally altered by azathioprine.\nSample preparation for proteomic analysis",
    "Timing: 3 days for steps 36–43\nTiming: 2–3 days for steps 44–69\nIn this section, we describe the sample preparation method for quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis of GBM cells, which is generally applicable to other cell types. This method consists of the following steps: (1) protein extraction, (2) tryptic digestion of proteins, (3) cleanup of peptides, and (4) iTRAQ labeling of peptides.\nCoat 100 mm TC-treated dishes with laminin-fibronectin for at least 2 h.\nNote: As the coating process is carried out manually, there is no need to prepare coated dishes the day before cell seeding.\nSeed GBM cells at 2×106 cells/dish, and place in a CO2 incubator for 24 h to ensure stable attachment and cell stabilization.\nNote: Multiple cell dishes may be needed to obtain sufficient protein for proteomic analysis. We prepared 2–3 dishes for each experimental group.\nTreat with appropriately concentrated drug or vehicle control. For azathioprine, we treated cells with 10 μM azathioprine for 48 h in 37°C CO2 incubator.\nWash the vehicle- or drug-treated cells with cold PBS.\nNote: Carefully add 3–6 mL of PBS to the cell culture dish to avoid detaching the cells and aspirate the PBS.\nCritical: Ice-cold PBS should be used. Warm PBS may cause protein degradation. In addition, sterile-filtered PBS should be used for subsequent mass analysis.\nAdd 1 mL of cold PBS, manually dissociate cells from dish by scraping, while keeping dish on ice.\nTransfer to a 1.5 mL tube\nCentrifuge at 3000 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and save the cell pellet.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of cell lysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).",
    "Note: Cell lysis methods based on common detergents (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, or Nonidet P-40) should be avoided, because these detergents interfere with subsequent MS analysis.\nAlternatives: If the use of detergents is required, an alternative sample preparation method to remove detergents should be performed (e.g., filter-aided sample preparation) (Wiśniewski et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Otherwise, some MS-compatible detergents such as acid-labile detergents (e.g., RapiGest SF or PPS Silent Surfactant) and a subset of non-ionic detergents (e.g., n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside) can be applied.\nSonicate the cell suspension at an amplitude of 25% on ice (Program: Time- 2 min, Pulser- 20%).\nCentrifuge the lysate at 14000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatants into a 1.5 mL tube.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the supernatants using the BCA Protein Assay Kit.\nTransfer 100 μg of proteins into a 1.5 mL tube.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nAdd 10 μL of 100 mM DTT in 500 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate to the protein sample to reduce disulfide bonds between the thiol groups of cysteine residues in proteins and adjust the total reaction volume to 100 μL by adding HPLC-grade water. Incubate the mixture at 37°C and 850 rpm for 2 h in a thermomixer.\nAdd 8 μL of 270 mM IAA in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate to alkylate the free thiol groups of cysteine residues. Incubate the mixture at 25°C and 850 rpm for 30 min in a thermomixer under dark conditions.\nQuench the remaining IAA by adding 12 μL of 400 mM L-cysteine in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate to the protein mixture. Incubate the mixture at 25°C and 850 rpm for 30 min in a thermomixer.\nDilute the protein samples with 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate to reduce the final urea concentration to less than 2 M.",
    "Add 4 μL of 0.25 μg/μL trypsin and incubate at 37°C, 850 rpm for 18 h in a thermomixer.\nNote: Trypsin is the most commonly used protease in bottom-up proteomics that cleaves peptide bonds at the C-terminal of lysine or arginine residues, except for lysine-proline and arginine-proline bonds. Lys-C, which cleaves lysine-proline bonds, is often used with trypsin to reduce missed cleavages.\nAdd formic acid to stop tryptic digestion to a final concentration of 1% (v/v).\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nFor the cleanup of peptides, condition the Oasis HLB cartridge with 1 mL of 100% acetonitrile to wet the Oasis HLB sorbents.\nEquilibrate with 2 mL of 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water.\nLoad the peptide mixtures onto the cartridge.\nWash with 2 mL of 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water.\nElute with 0.5 mL of 70% acetonitrile/30% HPLC-grade water\nDry eluted peptide mixtures using a SpeedVac concentrator.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nFor iTRAQ labeling, dissolve each dried peptide in 30 μL of 500 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min.\nNote: iTRAQ reagents react with amine groups of the N-terminus and lysine on peptides. iTRAQ quantification is based on specific reporter ions produced upon MS/MS fragmentation, which allows multiplex analysis of up to 4plex or 8plex.\nAlternatives: TMT kits (6, 10, 11, or 16plex) are also available for isobaric labeling.\nEquilibrate the iTRAQ reagents to room temperature (15°C–25°C) and briefly spin down iTRAQ reagent vials.\nAdd ethanol (70 μL) to each iTRAQ reagent vial.

    "Multidimensional LC coupled with tandem MS/MS is a powerful tool for large-scale proteomic analysis. Two-dimensional (2D) LC combined with SCX and RP is the most commonly used approach. In this protocol, a 2D LC system was employed automatically (online) using a C18/SCX biphasic trap column.\nResuspend the sample in 50 μL of 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min.\nInject the sample (10 μL) from the autosampler onto the C18/SCX trap column (valve position A in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) at a flow rate of 4 μL/min for 10 min. The peptides bind to the SCX part of the trap column.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1038-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Instrumental setup of online 2D nanoLC system\nSwitch the 6-prot valve to position B (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) and perform a breakthrough run on the RP analytical column at a column flow rate of 200 nL/min for 50 min. The LC gradient should be as follows: 0–1 min (2%–8% mobile phase B), 1–10 min (8%–15% mobile phase B), 10–20 min (15%–30% mobile phase B), 20–23 min (30%–90% mobile phase B), 23–30 min (90% mobile phase B), 30–32 min (90%–2% mobile phase B), and 32–60 min (2% mobile phase B).\nInject 10 μL of SCX elution buffer from the autosampler onto the C18/SCX trap column (valve position A in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) at a flow rate of 4 μL/min for 10 min. The peptides were eluted from the SCX and re-bound to the C18 part on the trap column.\nNote: SCX elution buffers were prepared as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section. In the initial experimental setup of 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis, we checked the distribution of unique peptides identified in each fraction. If necessary, optimize the elution conditions of SCX (e.g., salt concentration or pH).",
