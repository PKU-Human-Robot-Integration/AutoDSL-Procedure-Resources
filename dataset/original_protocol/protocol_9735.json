    "The ASCs used in this study were previously isolated from healthy human donors and cryopreserved as described14 according to the Research Ethics Committee of Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (25818719.4.0000.5257). See Table of Materials for details regarding all the materials and equipment used in this study.\n1. Trypsinization of ASC monolayer at passage three\nOpen the tissue culture 175 cm2 flask containing the monolayer of ASCs at 80% confluence and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 7 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M) and wash the monolayer twice. Next, discard the liquid.\nAdd 5 mL of 0.125% trypsin with 0.78 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Next, incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of low-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM LOW) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the tissue culture 175 cm2 flask and mix the cell suspension well with a 10 mL sorologic pipette.\nHarvest the cell suspension with a 10 mL serological pipette and transfer it to a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Next, centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min to obtain the pellet of ASCs. Resuspend the cell pellet using DMEM LOW containing 10% FBS.\nPerform a cell count by trypan exclusion.\nAfter counting, take a total of 1 × 106 ASCs in a separate 15 mL centrifuge tube to seed the 81 recessions micromolded with non-adherent hydrogel (a total of 10,000 cells/mL seeded here). To seed 256 recessions of micromolded non-adherent hydrogel, take a total of 5 × 105 ASCs into a centrifuge tube (a total of 2,500 cells/mL seeded here).\n2. Micromolded non-adherent agarose hydrogel fabrication\nPrepare 50 mL of a sterile solution of 2% ultrapure agarose in 0.9% NaCl in ultrapure water. Autoclave the solution for 30 min at 121 °C.",
    "Add 500 µL of sterile 2% ultrapure agarose solution in the center of a silicone mold containing 81 or 256 circular recesses.\nAfter 40 min, unmold the ultrapure agarose from the silicone mold and place it in a well of a 12-well plastic plate.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM LOW in the well with the micromolded agarose and incubate in an incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for at least 12 h before seeding the ASCs.\n3. Biofabrication of ASC spheroids using the automated pipetting system\nCheck the following:\n\t\nCheck whether laminar flow is on, and the airflow of the cabinet is working properly.\nCheck whether the equipment is connected to the correct voltage.\nCheck whether the tablet is connected to the equipment.\nCheck whether the height of the cabinet protection glass is at the same height as the sensor marking of the equipment.\nPress the On/Off button on the left side of the equipment and wait for the tablet and the equipment to start.\nPosition the tip boxes, the rack for centrifuge tubes, and the plate containing the micromolded agarose hydrogel in the workspace of the equipment.\nAt the tablet with the software open, first click on Labware Editor.\nSet up a virtual worktable and choose the positions of the pipettes, tip boxes, the rack for the plastic tubes, and the plates.\n\tNOTE: The virtual worktable must represent the physical positions of the accessories in the equipment.\nClick on the Switch to Produce button to include the parameters (see step 3.10) and commands that the equipment will carry out throughout the experiment. Wait for a toolbar and a Produce List to open in the software.\nInitially, to indicate the commands, include the number of samples to be pipetted and drag it to the Produce List.",
    "NOTE: The number of samples are the number of plastic centrifuge tubes containing the ASC suspension to be seeded in the center of the micromolds.\nAfter entering the number of samples, click on the Sample Transfer command button on the software to transfer the ASC suspension to the wells of the 12-well plate, containing the micromolds, and drag it to the Produce List.\nClick on Properties to set up the start and end positions for the equipment to transfer the sample.\nWait for the software to return to the Work Table page. Click on the Options button to set up the parameters for automated seeding of the ASCs: i) Aspiration Speed of 15.4 s-1; ii) Dispense Speed of 1 s-1; iii) Blow Delay of 0 ms; iv) Blow Speed of 15.4 s-1; v) Initial Stroke of 100%. Select Water as the Standard Liquid Type.\nSet up the parameters to mix the ASCs to obtain a homogeneous suspension: i) Number of Cycles of 5; ii) Speed of 6.5 s-1; iii) Volume of 300 µL.\nAfter setting up the parameters, add the Time of 40 min to the Produce List.\n\tNOTE: This time is needed to wait for the ASC suspension to decant at the bottom of the micromold.\nIn the Produce List, include the Reagent Transfer option to transfer the spheroid culture medium to the corresponding wells of the plate.\nRepeat steps 3.9-3.11 to set up the position and parameter configurations to transfer the spheroid culture medium.\nClick on the button with a check symbol on the top bar of the software to ensure there is no programming error.\nClick on the Play button (with a triangle symbol) on the top bar of the software to start the program.",
    "Let the equipment start, as programmed, and wait for it to make a sound, indicating it has finished.\nCollect the 12-well plate and incubate it in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for at least 18 h for the spheroids to be completely formed and compact.\nManually harvest the spheroids after 1, 3, and 7 days of culture for analysis. Manually flush the medium with a micropipette to liberate the spheroids from the micromolded non-adherent agarose hydrogel.\nAfter 5 min, check under the microscope to determine whether the spheroids are completely released from the micromolded non-adherent agarose hydrogel.\nCollect the spheroids manually using a micropipette and transfer them to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nWash the spheroids at least two times with 0.01 M PBS. Assess the viability and perform biomechanical analyses on the fresh spheroid samples. For morphology analysis (histology), incubate the spheroid samples in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for at least 18 h at 2-8 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
