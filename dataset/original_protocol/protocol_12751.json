    "1. Preparation and Plating out of DNA\nAccurately quantify the gDNA concentration using a spectrophotometric or fluorometric instrument.\nDilute DNA to 4 ng/µL on a 96-well deep-well plate. Include at least one control gDNA sample with a known copy number and one non-template control.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plates at 450 x g for 2 min.\nUsing a liquid handling instrument, dispense each sample in quadruplicate onto 384-well qPCR plates so that every well has 10 ng of DNA (2.5 µL/well). Prepare at least ten 384-well plates, one for each qKAT reaction.\nIf gDNA is being dispensed from more than one 96-well plate, perform a full-volume wash with 2% bleach and ultrapure water to clean the needles of the liquid handling system between each 96-well plate of gDNA samples.\nAir-dry the DNA by incubating the 384-well plates in a clean area at room temperature for at least 24 h.\n2. Preparation of the Primers and Probes\nNOTE: qKAT consists of ten multiplex reactions. Each reaction includes three primer pairs and three fluorescence-labeled probes that specifically amplify two KIR genes and one reference gene. The probes that were published in Jiang et al.27 were modified so that the oligonucleotides are now labeled with ATTO dyes since they offer improved photostability and long signal lifetimes. Pre-aliquoted primer combinations are commercially available (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare primer combinations for each reaction as per the dilutions given in Table 1.\nPrepare probe combinations for each reaction as per Table 1. Test each individual probe prior to making the combination.\n3. Preparation of the Master Mix\nNOTE The volumes mentioned below are for performing one qKAT reaction on a set of 10x 384-well plates.",
    "Ensure that the gDNA samples plated on the 384-well plates are completely dry. Conduct all steps on ice and keep the reagents covered from exposure to light as much as possible since the fluorescence-labeled probes are photo- and thermo-sensitive.\nDefrost the qPCR buffer, primer, and probe aliquots at 4 °C.\nOn ice, prepare a master mix for 10x 384-well plates by adding 18.86 mL of ultrapure water, 20 mL of qPCR buffer, 1,000 µL of preprepared primer combination, and 180 µL of preprepared probe combination (Table 2).\nDistribute the master mix evenly across a 96-deep well plate using a multi-channel pipette, pipetting 415 µL into each well. Keep this plate in an ice box covered from light.\nUsing a liquid handling instrument, dispense 9.5 µL of the master mix into each well of the 384-well plate with dried gDNA. Seal the plate with a foil and immediately place it at 4 °C. Repeat this process for the remaining plates, ensuring that the needles of the liquid handling system are washed with water between each plate.\nCentrifuge the 384-well plates at 450 x g for 3 min and incubate them at 4 °C overnight or between 6 - 12 h to resuspend the DNA and to dissipate any air bubbles.\n4. qPCR Assay\nFollowing the overnight incubation, centrifuge at 450 x g for 3 min to dissipate any remaining air bubbles.\nFor purposes of automation, connect the qPCR machine (e.g., LightCycler 480) to a microplate handler (see Table of Materials). Program the microplate handler to place the plates into the qPCR machine from a cooled storage dock that is protected from light.\nNOTE The assays should, in theory, work on other qPCR machines with compatible optic settings.",
    "Use the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 66 °C for 50 s, with data collection at 66 °C.\nOnce the run is complete, have the robot collect the plate from the qPCR machine and place it in the discard dock.\n5. Post-run Analysis\nAfter amplification, calculate the quantification cycle (Cq) values using either the second derivative maximum method or the Fit Points method with the software of the qPCR machine (see Table of Materials), following the steps below.\nOpen the qPCR software and, in the Navigator tab, open the saved reaction experiment file for one plate.\nFor the analysis using the second derivative maximum method, select the Analysis tab, and create a new analysis using Abs Quant/Second Derivative Max method.\nIn the Create new analysis window, select analysis type: Abs Quant/Second Derivative Max method, subset: All Samples, program: Amplification, name: Rx-DFO (where x is the reaction number).\nSelect Filter Comb and choose VIC/HEX/Yellow555 (533-580). This ensures that the data collected for STAT6 is selected.\nSelect Colour Compensation for VIC/HEX/Yellow555(533-580). Click Calculate. Repeat this for Fam (465-510) and Cy5/Cy5.5(618-660). Click Save file.\nFor the analysis using the Fit Points method, select Abs Quant/Fit Points in the Analysis tab.\nIn the Create new analysis window, select analysis type: Abs Quant/Fit Points method, subset: All Samples, program: Amplification, name: RxF-DFO (where x is the reaction number).\nSelect the correct filters and color compensations for STAT6 and each of the KIR genes (Fam/Cy5). In the Noiseband tab, set the noise band to exclude the background noise.\nIn the Analysis tab, set the fit points to 3 and select Show fit points. Click Calculate. Click Save file.\n6. Export of the Results",
    "In the qPCR software, open the Navigator tab. Select Results Batch Export.\nOpen the folder in which the experiment files are saved and transfer the files into the right-hand side section of the window. Click Next. Select the name and the location of the export file.\nSelect Analysis type Abs Quant/Second Derivative Max method or Abs Quant/Fit Points. Click Next. Check that the name of the file, the export folder, and the analysis type are correct and click Next to start the export process.\nWait until the Export Status is Ok. The screen will automatically move to the next step. Check that all selected files have been exported successfully so that the number of files failed = 0. Click Done.\nUse scripts split_file.pl and roche2sds.pl to split the exported plates into individual reactions for each plate.\nNOTE The scripts are provided on request/GitHub.\n7. Copy Number Calculations\nOpen the copy number analysis software (e.g., CopyCaller). Select Import real-time PCR results file and load text files created by roche2sds.pl.\nSelect Analyze and conduct the analysis by either selecting calibrator sample with known copy number or by selecting most frequent copy number. See Table 5 for the most frequent copy number of KIR genes typically observed in European-origin populations.\n8. Data-quality Checks\nUse R script KIR_CNVdata_analysis_for_Excel_ver020215.R to combine copy number data from all the plates into a spreadsheet.\nNOTE The scripts are provided on request/GitHub.\nRecheck the raw data on the copy number analysis software for samples that do not conform to the known linkage disequilibrium (LD) for KIR genes (Table 6)."
