    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: 2 months\nThis Protocol consists of 4 steps:\nFungal culture: Culture media for Alternaria Alternata and Malassezia globosa. Requirement: Incubator, and BSL2 laminar air flow cabinet.\nFungal ablation in mice with Amphotericin B treatment.\nFungal re-population: Transplantation of Alternaria alternata and Malassezia globosa via oral gavage.\nOrthotopic PDAC tumor model in C57BL/6J background.\nRequirement: It requires a surgical suite and supportive surgical instruments.\nSection 1: Fungal culture\nTiming: 3 days\nObtain the fungal species Alternaria alternata and Malassezia globosa from ATCC.\nCritical: Institutional biosafety clearance is required for acquiring the fungal species. All the precautions must be taken while handling and storing the fungal samples received from ATCC.\nPrepare V8 broth media and V8 agar plate for culturing Alternaria alternata, one day before starting the experiment.\nPrepare mDixon broth media and mDixon agar plates for culturing Malassezia globosa, one day before starting the experiment.\nRevive and culture Alternaria alternata (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1932-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic showing the revival of Alternaria alternata fungal spores and plating on V8 agar media plate\nOpen an ampoule of Alternaria alternata by snipping the top half and cracking the glass.\nCritical: This procedure needs to be done in a laminar airflow cabinet.\nAdd 1 mL of sterile water to the ampoule and pipette up and down until the fungal pellet is dissolved into a suspension.\nTransfer the fungal suspension into a 15 mL falcon tube filled with 5 mL of autoclaved DI water.\nKeep the fungal suspension for 12–16 h at 22°C to restore the fungal growth.\nAfter 12–16 h of incubation at 22°C spread the fungal spore to V8 agar plates and incubate for 48–72 h at 26°C in a humidified aerobic condition.\nRevive and culture Malassezia globosa (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1932-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Schematic showing the revival of Malassezia globosa fungal spores and plating on mDixon agar media plate\nThaw the frozen Malassezia globosa ampoule at 25°C in a dry bath for 5 min.\nBreak open the ampoule and spread plate 100 μL of the fungal suspension into mDixon agar plates.\nIncubate the fungal spread plate at 30°C for 48–72 h.\nNote: Keep observing the plates every 24 h for fungal growth. Also, make sure there is no fungal overgrowth as shown in (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCritical: Fungal species can cause allergy and dermatitis; direct skin contact must be avoided. Also, avoid using a bacterial incubator to prevent any cross-contamination.\nSection 2: Fungal ablation with amphotericin B treatment\nTiming: 26 days\nPrepare Amphotericin B stock and working solution:\nPrepare Amphotericin B stock solution: Dissolve Amphotericin B powder in DMSO at a concentration of 30 mg/mL and store at –20°C.\nPrepare Amphotericin B working solution: Make 1 mg/mL working solution by diluting 1 mL Amphotericin B stock solution in 29 mL of PBS and store at -20°C.\nPurchase mice and keep under normal conditions.\nNote: For this protocol, mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (C57BL/6J, Stock #000664) and kept under normal conditions (22°C, fed with a 5% chow diet, and allowed to acclimate to day/night cycle for 7 days).\nAutoclave oral gavage syringe for 15 min at 121°C a day before Amphotericin B treatment.\nObtain the special cages and water bottles before starting the experiment.\nNote: For this protocol specialized water restriction cages are used to restrict the automated water supply to the cages; water bottles are used to supply Amphotericin B treated water.\nCritical: Sterile water is required for the preparation of Amphotericin B in drinking water.",
    "After the initial 7 days of acclimatization, treat the mice with Amphotericin B for 26 days (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1932-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic showing fungal ablation strategy with the treatment of Amphotericin B\nAlternatives: Alternatively, other antifungal drug such as fluconazole can also be used for fungal ablation.\nDivide the Amphotericin B treatment regimen into two courses.\nFor The first course treat with 200 μg amphotericin/mice for 5 consecutive days through oral gavage\nFollow with a second course of 0.5 μg/mL of Amphotericin B, ad libitum for 21 days.\nCritical: The Amphotericin B needs to be freshly prepared and replaced every 3 days.\nCritical: Amphotericin B is weakly soluble in water; stock should be prepared in DMSO. The working stock should be prepared fresh in PBS before administering to mice.\nSection 3: Fungal re-population\nTiming: 7 days\nAutoclave the oral gavage syringe a day before Amphotericin B treatment.\nGrow Alternaria alternata and Malassezia globosa as described in section 1: Fungal culture[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1].\nCritical: Do not allow the fungal culture plates to become over confluent.\nAutoclave a fine mesh sieve strainer (Fisher Scientific, NC1033784) for filtration of fungal spores.\nTake out the Alternaria alternata and Malassezia globosa culture plates after 72 h of incubation from the incubator and determine the growth.\nNote: Avoid Alternaria alternata culture plates having a fungal overgrowth (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1932-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Malassezia globosa and Alternaria alternata culture plates showing fungal overgrowth\nAdd 5 mL of PBS to fungal culture plates containing Alternaria alternata and Malassezia globosa respectively.\nIncubate at 22°C for 15 min to make sure the fungus loosens from the plates.\nUsing a cell scraper (Corning, CLS3008) gently scrap the fungal culture from the plates.\nTransfer the fungal suspension to a 50 mL falcon tube and add 10 mL of PBS to the tube.",
    "Pipet the fungus solution up and down 15–20 times with 10 mL serological pipet to break the clumps.\nCritical: Note that Alternaria alternata is a filamentous fungus and forms a clump while grown in culture dishes. To make single-cell suspension, a two-step procedure is required:\nThe fungal suspension is passed through a sterile fine-mesh sieve strainer with gentle pressure using a 20 mL syringe plunger.\nNext, pass the fungal filtrate through a 70 μm cell strainer with gentle pressure using a 10 mL syringe plunger to get a single cell suspension.\nCritical: Malassezia globosa is a unicellular organism belonging to the yeast family and usually does not form clumps. Passing through a 70 μm cell strainer is enough to get a single cell suspension.\nDetermine colony formation unit/mL using a Thermo Fisher Countess II Cell Counter using the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/cell-analysis-instruments/automated-cell-counters/resources/resources-countess-ii.html].\nCentrifuge the fungal spore at 400 g at 4°C for 5 min, resuspended in 1 mL PBS.\nBriefly, mix the fungi with trypan blue in 1:1 ratio and load 10 μL of the mix into the counting slide.\nMeasure 3 replicates and then average the values to get a fungal count.\nAlternatives: Measurement can be done using a manual counting method using a hemocytometer.\nAfter Counting the fungal spore, adjust the volume of fungal suspension to produce a 1 x 108 spore/mL suspension for oral gavage.\nTransfer 200 μL of either Alternaria alternata or Malassezia globosa of fungal suspension at a concentration of 1 x 108 colony formation units (CFU)/mL, via oral gavage to mice (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1932-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic of major steps of fungal repopulation followed by orthotopic transplantation of PDAC cell lines into mouse pancreas\nPost fungal transplantation, switch the mice cages back to normal drinking water.",
    "Critical: Monitor mice for 7 days for any allergic symptoms or illness such as runny nose, cough, and red watery eye.\nSection 4: Orthotopic PDAC tumor model\nTiming: 26 days\nCulture the mouse PDAC cell lines in PDAC cell culture media at 37°C. and 5% CO2 in humidified incubator.\nOn the day of surgery harvest the cells; count and make a single-cell suspension for orthotopic transplantation.\nA week before the surgery thaw a vial of mPDAC cell lines and seed in a T-25 flask.\nSplit and feed the cells using standard techniques to expand the cells.\nDetermine the cell number based on the number of mice to be transplanted with mPDAC cells.\nNote: Each mouse receives 0.5 × 106 cells per injection.\nContinue to grow the cells in a T-175. A day before the surgery split the cells to ensure the cells are in log phase of growth on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of surgery trypsinize the T-175 flask with 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin. Add 10 mL RPMI media and then centrifuge the mix at 300 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL of PBS and centrifuge again the mix at 300 g for 5 min.\nRepeat step f.\nCount and resuspend the cells at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 per 10 μL of PBS. The cells are ready for transfer to mouse.\nThaw the Matrigel for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nNote: Matrigel takes at least 4–5 h to thaw, keeping it at 4°C for 12–16h is a preferred method to save some critical time on the day of surgery. Matrigel should always be kept on ice until used for injection.\nMix the cells and Matrigel at 1:1 ratio (50 μL cells and 50 μL Matrigel).",
    "Note: Keep the Hamilton syringe on ice before drawing the Matrigel and cell mix. Mix the cells and Matrigel just before the surgery to avoid solidification of Matrigel in the syringe.\nSet up the surgical table inside a biobubble or in a sterile location.\nCritical: Make sure the surgical instruments are sterilized, and the heating pad is turned on.\nNote: After 26 days of Amphotericin B treatment and 7 days of fungal repopulation period, the mPDAC cell line is orthotopically transplanted to pancreas (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1932-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Schematic of the major steps of orthotopic transplantation of PDAC cell lines into mouse pancreas\nFor orthotopic transplantation, anesthetize mice by placing them in the induction chamber of isoflurane system and turning the gas on at 2–3% with a flow rate of 0.8–1.0 liter/min.\nShave a 2 × 2 mm portion of the left abdomen at the splenic silhouette, located just below the rib cage, to facilitate transplantation.\nMake an incision of 1 cm in the left abdomen such that the pancreas is gently exposed along with the spleen.\nInject mouse PDAC cells mixed with Matrigel (20 μL of cells (5 × 105)) mixed with Matrigel), slowly into the tail of the pancreas using a Hamilton syringe.\nPut the pancreas back into the abdomen using a surgical probe.\nSuture the peritoneal membrane using sterile 6-0 (polyglactin 910) absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nClip the outer skin with 2–3 surgical clips.\nFor the orthotopic model, image animals (IVIS Spectrum, PerkinElmer) 2 days after surgery to assess the successful implantation of the tumors.\nNote: For IVIS imaging we inject the D-luciferin 150 mg Luciferin/kg body weight.",
    "For a 10 g mouse, inject 100 μL to deliver 1.5 mg of Luciferin via IP, wait for 5 min and then image the mice with 1 min exposure and 5 min lag time.\nCritical: Only orthotopic tumors of similar luciferase intensity are used for further study.\nMonitor mice for tumor burden through MRI and/or bioluminescence imaging every week until euthanized.\nOn day 26 or earlier, if the mice are moribund, euthanize the mice, and harvest the tumor.\nWeigh, measure and image the tumor for analysis.\nCritical: Prevent leakage during surgery by injecting a smaller volume of mPDAC cells and Matrigel mixture. Injection into the pancreas should form a small bubble; wait for 30–60 sec to let the Matrigel solidify and gently push the pancreas with the help of a blunt probe.\nCritical: During the oral gavage of fungi, injury to the trachea or GI tract must be avoided. If the fluid gets into the lung and there is a sign of asphyxiation the mouse needs to be euthanized immediately. Post fungal administration, Amphotericin B must not be used until the completion of the experiment."
