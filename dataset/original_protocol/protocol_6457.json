    "The surgery is performed on an alcohol cleaned flat surface beneath a dissection scope with an apparatus mounted with stabilization restraints to hold the mouth open. Recommendation is to use an S&T Ball Chain Retraction System Base Plate. Two lengths of 5-0 surgical silk (or embroidery thread, soft string, to avoid damage to the mouse’s tongue) with rubber bands knotted at the strings’ ends can be hooked to the plate’s ribbed edges. The surgical silk is drawn tight across the mouse’s mouth for restraint of the mouth in an open position for anesthesia and surgery (Figure 2). Place the heating pad recovery station on a table adjacent to the surgery setup so that mice can be quickly transferred to the station upon completion of surgery. The station should be set to 41 degrees Celsius. We place an empty housing cage on top of the heating pad about an hour prior to the surgeries to allow the cage to heat up to a comfortable temperature; half on the pad, half off.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152302_0079.jpgFigure 2. Mouse anesthesia setupSince this is an oral surgery, a setup is needed that will reliably deliver isoflurane to the mouse while still leaving the mouth free for the operation. Recommendation is to use a two-tube system: a 0.2 cm diameter tube to deliver the anesthesia, slid inside a larger 1 cm diameter Tygon tube. The outer tube will connect to the scavenger filter of the anesthesia unit (Figure 2). Figure 3 provides further clarification of the orientation to accommodate the mouse’s nose. There should be an 8 mm gap between the tip of the inner tube and the tip of the outer tube. The mouse’s nose can be slid into the outer tube to allow anesthesia delivery, while still allowing the mouth to be opened and manipulated during surgery.",
    "The procedure is done under a dissection scope at a magnification of 10x, though higher magnifications might be beneficial when first learning the procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152317_8062.jpgFigure 3. Mouse restraintSterilize surgery tools (scalpel handle, forceps) in a bead sterilizer, autoclave, or spray them with 70% ethanol and air dry.Set up the anesthesia machine with a splitter to provide dual tubing approach of the mixed oxygen/isoflurane to both the induction chamber and the surgical setup. Optimal settings will depend on the isoflurane delivery vaporizer cannister, but current recommendation is an oxygen level of 1.5 and an isoflurane level of 3%.Place the mouse into the induction chamber for initial anesthesia induction; the typical rapid breathing will begin to slow down to deeper breaths, moving from the upper chest to the lower chest. This will take about one to two minutes, depending on the mouse and the chamber size.Switch anesthetic flow to the surgical area tubing.Move the anesthetized mouse quickly to the surgical area beneath the dissection scope placing its nose into the Tygon tubing to maintain anesthesia depth and to avoid having to replace the mouse back into the induction chamber to repeat the anesthesia process. Should any movement occur, place the mouse back into the induction chamber and repeat this process. Movement of any kind by the mouse indicates the tubing is not providing adequate isoflurane flow.Restrain the mouse for surgery. Hook one restraint under the upper two front teeth, and the other restraint underneath the lower two front teeth (Figure 4), gently pulling the mouth as wide open as possible while still keeping the mouse’s nose inside the anesthesia tubing. If necessary, use tape across the tail to help hold the mouse steady.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152352_9169.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Top-down view of open-mouth positioningAdjust the microscope and lighting as needed in order to have a clear visual into the mouse’s mouth (Figure 5). From here, begin the procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152409_1584.jpgFigure 5. Broad view of the surgery and restraint set-upUsing a scalpel blade (#11) mounted on a surgical scalpel handle (#3), make a small incision into the mouse’s lip inner bucchal margin crease a little below the roof of the mouth (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152427_7872.jpgFigure 6. Highlighted surgical site provides illustration of the 2 mm incision (15x). The diagram reveals the underlying trigeminal nerve branches.Gently cut away the soft tissue using the tip of the scalpel blade. You will eventually create a hole to reveal the trigeminal maxillary infraorbital nerve branches that innervate the teeth and whiskerpad coming together posteriorly at the bony foramen rotundum to enter the skull (Figure 7). Initially opening this site a little wider in a cadaver or practice mouse will allow visualization of the infraorbital nerve innervation and the foramen rotundum where the chromic gut will be inserted (Figures 8 and 9). The surgical site ordinarily should be quite small; no more than a couple of millimeters, and no suturing of the wound should be needed if an experienced experimenter did the surgery. Please note that the dissection and surgery have been exaggerated in all of the descriptive images provided. It is unlikely, but there would be excessive bleeding from the wound if the cut is deeper than intended, then stop the procedure and do not use the mouse for further experimentation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152445_4097.jpgFigure 7.

    "Insertion of chromic gut suture into the foramen rotundum alongside the ION nerve (15x)Using small forceps (recommended: Dumont #5), grip 3 mm suture by the end and angle it into the hole you have just cut in the crease of the mouse’s cheek (Figure 8). Then slide the suture into the foramen, alongside the ION. The suture should go in with very little resistance; if you feel resistance, it means that you do not have the right angle and are not guiding the suture into the foramen. The nerve should never be touched with the metal surgical instruments.Push the suture into the foramen as far as possible with the forceps (Figures 8 and 9). Then, gently let go, and use the closed tips of your forceps to push the end of the suture further through the foramen. You should just barely be able to see the end of the suture if you have pushed it in correctly.The incision used in this model is small enough that no sutures are required to close the wound. In both shams and the FRICT-ION model, the wound begins to close within the first twenty-four hours (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413152537_7559.jpgFigure 10. Sham Surgery at 0, 24, and 48 h post surgery. Wound is mostly closed within 24 h and is completely closed by 48 h. Only slight vascularity can be seen at 24 h.Place the mouse into the heat recovery station until it awakes from the anesthesia and is mobile before returning to the home cage. Mice should be checked an hour after surgery to ensure all normal motor function has returned. (This is a precaution, as typically mice are fully functional within minutes of removal from anesthesia.",
    ") Mice should then be checked daily for the week following surgery, including assessing weights and surface glances into the mouth to ensure no exacerbation of the wound or infection has occurred. It is likely that mice will not gain weight the day following the surgery, but by day two should be back to the typical gradual weight gain.  There should be no noticeable change in behavior; FRICT-ION mice should appear similar to naïve mice to the naked eye. If there is a change in behavior, such as weight loss, lethargy, etc., do not use the mouse for further experimentation. If the weight falls below eighty percent of the mouse’s weight prior to surgery, the mouse should be checked by veterinary staff and, if applicable, humanely euthanized."
