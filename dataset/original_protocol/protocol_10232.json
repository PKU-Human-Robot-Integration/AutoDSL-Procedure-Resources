    "1. Preparation of n HTs\nNOTE: Here, n denotes the number of different single DNA strands involved in the formation of the helix tubes of a certain size. For n=8, eight different single DNA strands make up a unit ring.\nPurchase DNA sequences (HPLC purity grade or higher) from a suitable DNA synthesis service or perform high-quality synthesis and purification (exemplary sequences given in Table 1).\nResuspend lyophilized oligonucleotides in purified water and follow the further resuspension steps given in the corresponding manual from the company. Adjust the amount of water to obtain a final concentration of 200 µM.\nDetermine concentrations of the single DNA strands to verify the values given by the distributor (e.g., via UV-Vis spectroscopy at 260 nm) since the exact stoichiometry is crucial for the assembly process. Calculate the concentration of the oligonucleotides, taking into account the specific molar weight and the extinction coefficient for each single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide.\n\tNOTE: The extinction coefficient values inherently vary for the different sequences and are stated in the documentation of commercially purchased DNA. They can also be calculated according to the nearest-neighbor model using a number of freely available online tools. To comply with the linear range of the spectrometer, consider diluting the sample used for concentration determination.\nUsing a micropipette, mix the DNA strands-each at the same concentration-in a container suitable for the thermocycler (e.g., a 200 µL PCR tube) to form the desired nHTs (final buffer conditions: 1xTE (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and 12.5 mM MgCl2).",
    "NOTE: Final DNA nHT samples consist of n- 1 strands, U1− Un−1, and one Tn strand. The concentration per strand can vary from sub-micromolar to more than 10 µM, depending on the needs of the user (e.g., <1 µm per strand for the subsequent dilution to observe single filaments or higher concentrations for the examination of dense network mechanics).\nHybridize the nHTs in a thermocycler (denaturation for 10 min at 90 °C, with a subsequent quick drop to 65 °C; slow temperature decrease from 65 °C to 55 °C, with complementary base pairing in 20 temperature steps of -0.5 K for 30 min each; and a quick drop from 55 °C to 20 °C); see Figure 2A.\n\tNOTE: The slow decrease steps from 65 °C can be lengthened to increase the average tube length; however, the subsequent quick drop to 20 °C is crucial to avoid the aggregation of polymerized tubes.\nStore the hybridized nHTs for up to 3 weeks at 4 °C without detectable degradation.\n\tNOTE: For fluorescence microscopy, labeled nHTs are hybridized by (partly) substituting U1 with the modified U1-Cy3 (Table 1). For longer observation times, the addition of established anti-bleaching agents is advisable.\nCarefully dilute the sample to the desired final concentration (e.g., 4 µM for networks or 20 nM for single-filament observations) using the sample buffer, if necessary. To minimize possible error sources, assemble samples at the desired final concentration.\n2. Shear Rheology\nChoose an appropriate geometry (plate-plate or cone-plate) for the dynamic shear rheometer. For small volumes (i.e., below 200 µL), use the cone-plate geometry.\nLoad the sample on the dynamic shear rheometer.\nPassivate the air-water interface of the sample and environment using the following steps to prevent potential evaporation effects.\nSurround the sample with 2.5 mL of the sample buffer bath.",
    "Add a surfactant just below the micelle concentration.\nUse a Hamilton syringe to surround the sample with a lipid to avoid direct contact of the sample with air.\nSeal the sample chamber with a cap equipped with wet sponges and, if possible, with an additional water bath (not in contact with the sample) to further suppress evaporation.\nStart the measurement using the rheometer-specific software at room temperature; alternatively, perform the measurement at different temperatures, such as 37 °C (if physiological conditions are needed).\n\tNOTE: Cooling the sample is often accompanied by the condensation of water vapor from the surrounding air, while heating leads to enhanced evaporation. Both effects can uncontrollably change the concentration of the sample, so all measurements in a series should be performed at a constant temperature.\nAllow the sample to equilibrate for 2 h at room temperature. The time evolution may be monitored with a time sweep (one data point per minute; strain γ = 5%; frequency f = 1 Hz).\nMeasure the mechanical properties with the desired test protocols. Start with a series of frequency sweeps (f-sweeps) because they leave the sample intact and allow for more measurements.\n\tNOTE: Additionally, short f-sweeps should be carried out before and after longer measurements (such as long f-sweeps with a much higher resolution) to verify that the sample remained unchanged throughout the full measurement protocol.\n\t\nPerform a short f-sweep (e.g., γ = 5%; f = 0.01 Hz to 30 Hz; 5 data points per decade).\nPerform a long f-sweep (e.g., γ = 5%; f = 0.001 Hz to 30 Hz; 21 data points per decade); the low-frequency regime can be omitted if not necessary to reduce measurement time.\nPerform a short f-sweep.",
    "Perform a γ-sweep (e.g., f = 1 Hz; γ = 0.0125% to 100%; 20 data points per decade).\n\t\tNOTE: Use the short f-sweep first, as it is usually inconsistent with previous f-sweeps because networks usually rupture during γ-sweep or detach from the plates. Alternatively, use γ-ramp (e.g., = 0.025 s-1, t = 60 s); however, the ramps usually require changing the motor mode, so subsequent short f-sweeps would be falsified.\nBin and/or smooth the raw data with a Gaussian kernel.\n3. Fluorescence-assisted Analysis of DNA Annealing\nPrepare 8 aliquots of 12 µL for each sample using 1-4 µM DNA per strand, 12.5 mM MgCl2 in 1x TE buffer, and 1x nucleic acid gel stain from a 10,000x DMSO stock. Make a negative control with no DNA, but include nucleic acid gel stain.\nTransfer the aliquots to a real-time PCR plate and seal with adhesive film (e.g., a 96-well reaction plate).\n\tNOTE: The high temperatures used in the thermal annealing protocols will evaporate samples. Thus, make sure that the wells are tightly sealed with adhesive film to prevent water evaporation and concentration increase, particularly during long-term experiments.\nCentrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 1 min at room temperature to remove the gas bubbles; if the gas bubbles expand, the wells cannot be analyzed.\nLoad the sealed plate into a real-time quantitative PCR system.\nRun an annealing program. Denature the DNA at 90 °C for 10 min. Drop the temperature quickly to 72 °C. Then, decrease the temperature slowly by 0.5 °C every 30 min. After the signal has decayed, accelerate the temperature ramp.\n\tNOTE: 72 °C is sufficiently above the real hybridization temperature; thus, the signal is recorded over a broad temperature range suitable for determining the necessary temperature range.",
    "Make sure that the lid of the cycler heats to at least 100 °C to prevent the condensation of evaporated sample on the adhesive film.\nDuring assembly, excite the samples with an argon-ion laser at 488 nm and detect the fluorescence at 550 nm when using a nucleic acid gel stain (or spectrally similar). For other dyes, choose an appropriate excitation/emission combination. Measure the fluorescence signal as often as possible to increase the overall signal quality using the built-in camera.\n\tNOTE: Here, measurements were taken every 9 s.\nIf preset melting and annealing programs are applied, use the provided software to analyze the data. If not, subtract the previous mean value from the mean value for each temperature step to obtain the relative change of the fluorescent signal.\n4. AFM Imaging\nCleave mica (e.g., mica \"V1\") by attaching commercially available adhesive tape and ripping it off; the uppermost layer of the mica should be removed.\nUsing a micropipette, deposit pre-formed nHT in Mg2+ containing folding buffer on the freshly cleaved mica and let it settle for 10 min.\nSpin the samples in short 3-s intervals at 2,000 x g on a small table centrifuge to remove the remaining liquid. Several nHTs should still be attached to the mica surface.\nUse a cantilever tip with a high stiffness (e.g., 54 Nm-1) and determine its resonance frequency with the internal AFM software.\nRecord the height profile with the AFM in air in tapping mode at low scan rates (e.g., 1 line/s) to avoid damaging or displacing the nHTs.\nSubscription Required.
