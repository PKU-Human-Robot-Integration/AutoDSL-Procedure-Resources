    "Ethics Statement: This protocol has been approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and follows all the guidelines for the ethical use of animals.\n1. Preparation of Equipment\nAutoclave the surgical tools prior to surgery.\nDisinfect the stereotactic apparatus with 70% ethanol.\nTurn on water bath and keep water temperature at 42 °C.\nDissolve Type IV-S clostridial collagenase in normal saline at a concentration of 0.075 U per 0.4 µl.\n2. Collagenase Injection Model\nWeigh the mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane in 30% O2/70% N2. Adequate anesthesia is signaled after approximately 2 min when mouse respirations have slowed to 1 per second.\nIntubate the trachea with a 30 mm 20 G intravenous catheter.\nConnect the catheter to a rodent ventilator and mechanically ventilate the lungs with 1.6% isoflurane in 30% O2/70% N2 at a rate of 105 breaths per minute with a delivered tidal volume of 0.75 ml..\nShave the scalp with an electronic shaver. Once the mouse is anesthetized and intubated, move it to a different work station for shaving and then returned to the surgical bench.\nSecure the head in a stereotactic frame, and level the head with both coronal and sagittal suture as reference points.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to eyes.\nInsert a rectal temperature probe. Maintain rectal temperature at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C using an underbody circulating waterbed.\nWipe the surgical area with betadine followed with 70% ethanol and repeat 3 times.\nMake a 1 cm midline scalp incision and wipe periosteum laterally with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator to expose bregma.\nDrill 1 mm diameter burr hole 2.2 mm left lateral to bregma with a water-cooled drill.",
    "Rotate collagenase vial 5 times, then wash a 0.5 μl syringe with 25 G needle (attached to stereotactic frame) with 0.5 µl collagenase solution 5 times (Leave 0.5 µl of collagenase solution in syringe after last wash).\nAlign needle tip with burr hole then expel 0.1 µl from syringe and wipe needle bevel with razor to discard.\nUsing a micromanipulator, advance the needle 3 mm deep to cortex and leave motionless for 30 sec.\nInject 0.4 µl over 90 sec.\nDecrease isoflurane to 1% and leave needle motionless for 5 min.\nWithdraw needle slowly.\nApply 1 - 2 drops of 0.25% bupivacaine subcutaneously and suture the skin.\nTurn off isoflurane vaporizer and remove mouse from the stereotactic frame.\nAllow mouse to recover spontaneous ventilation with subsequent tracheal extubation.\nReturn mouse to a clean cage and allow free access to food and water.\n3. Autologous Blood Injection Model\nFollow the steps 2.1 - 2.11 for the collagenase injection model.\nDraw 50 µl of sterile normal saline into a 30 G 50 µl syringe.\nConnect the microliter syringe with a 70 cm PE10 tube.\nExpel all the normal saline from microliter syringe into PE10 tube to completely de-air tubing.\nPull the microliter syringe piston out 1 mm to make an air bubble at the distal opening of the PE10 tube-microliter syringe apparatus to avoid mixture of saline and blood during later procedures.\nWipe the distal central tail artery region of the mouse with 70% ethanol, and cut the artery with a razor at 0.5 to 1 cm to the tail tip.\nCollect 40 µl of blood from the tail cut into the PE10 tube-microliter syringe apparatus. Note: that heparin is not used in the needle, tubing, or mouse.\nAttach the microliter syringe onto the injection pump.",
    "Connect the metal cannula portion of a 27 G needle to the end of the PE10 tube, and secure the needle to a micromanipulator on the stereotactic frame.\nExpel 2 µl of blood out of 27 G needle and wipe needle bevel with razor to discard.\nAlign needle tip with burr hole and insert needle 3 mm deep to cortex.\nInject 35 µl of autologous blood at a rate of 2 µl per min.\nDecrease isoflurane to 1% and leave needle motionless for 10 min.\nWithdraw needle over 30 sec.\nApply 1 - 2 drops of 0.25% bupivacaine subcutaneously and suture the skin.\nTurn off isoflurane vaporizer and remove mouse from the stereotactic frame.\nAllow mouse to recover spontaneous ventilation with subsequent extubation.\nReturn mouse to a clean cage and allow free access to food and water.\n4. Sham Operation\nFollow the same procedures for collagenase injection model, except without injection after needle insertion.\n5. Post-surgery Care\nInject 0.5 ml of normal saline subcutaneously in the evening of the surgical procedure at the back of the animal’s neck.\nProvide softened food with water and gel food in small plastic cups placed on the floor of the cage. Replace the food daily for 7 days.\nCheck for weight loss, wound healing, and signs of discomfort daily for 7 days.\nIf recovery intervals of greater than 7 days are required, suture removal may be performed under light inhaled anesthesia (approximately 1% isoflurane in 30% O2/70% N2), if necessary.\nSubscription Required.
