    "Preparation of a tumor single cell suspension    Sacrifice the mouse when the tumor has reached the desired diameter (as from the moment a tumor becomes palpable, it can be analyzed. The maximal tumor diameter depends on the limits set by the ethical commission and may vary in different countries) and restrain it by pinning its paws into a foam surface using syringe needles. Make a parallel incision from the base of the tail up to the neck along the mouse’s abdomen and to the paws without puncturing the peritoneum. Gently pull back the skin and pin it to the foam surface to reveal the tumor. Here, LLC lung carcinoma was used as an example, however the protocol is applicable for all solid tumors (Figure 1A).    Cut the tumor free from the skin and the body. Try to remove as much excess tissue surrounding the tumor as possible and take care to exclude the draining lymph node (Figure 1A).   Store the harvested tumors in 2 ml RMPI medium in a 6-well plate on ice until the digestion procedure (Figure 1B).    Cut the tumors in small pieces (1-1.5 mm) using scissors or a scalpel, subsequently add 1 ml digestion medium in the same well and incubate subsequently at 37 °C for 25 min (Figure 1C).   Crush the tumors with the plunger of 10 ml syringe, add 5 ml RPMI medium and homogenize by thoroughly pipetting with a 10 ml pipet.    Filter the tumor suspensions through a 70 µm sterile nylon gauze into a sterile 50 ml conical tube and wash the gauze with 10 ml RPMI medium.   Centrifuge the 50 ml tubes at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.",
    "Remove the red blood cells by resuspending the pellet in 4 ml erythrocyte lysis buffer and leave at room temperature for 2 min.    Neutralize by adding 12 ml RPMI medium, and transfer the suspension to a new 50 ml tube through a 70 µm sterile nylon gauze.    Centrifuge the 50 ml tubes at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.   Count the living cells using trypan bleu and resuspend the cell pellet in Lymphoprep at a concentration of approximately 1-2 x 107 cells/ml and transfer the suspension to sterile 15 ml tube(s) (6 ml/tube). Cover this cell suspension slowly and cautiously with 6 ml RPMI to obtain a two-phase gradient (Figure 1D).   Centrifuge the gradients at 800 x g for 30 min at room temperature without acceleration or break.   Carefully collect the interphase and the upper phase containing the RPMI medium and as less Lymphoprep contamination as possible (Figure 1E). The interphase contains the living cells and is enriched in myeloid cells, and transfer to a new sterile 15 ml tube. Wash by filling the 15 ml tube unto the top with MACS buffer, centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.   Resuspend the cells in MACS buffer at a concentration of 108 cells/ml.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141119/20141119175736_4508.jpg Figure 1. Tumor single-cell preparation.

    "Purification of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)   Add a 5 µl aliquot of anti-CD11b magnetic microbeads per 107 cells and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.   Wash by adding 10 ml MACS buffer, centrifuge at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.   Place an LS column in a MidiMACS Separator attached to a magnetic MultiStand and wash it by putting 3 ml MACS buffer on the top. The liquid passes the column by gravity.   Resuspend the pelleted cells in 1 ml MACS buffer and pipette the labeled cell suspension on top of the LS separation column. Wash the column by adding 3 x 3 ml MACS buffer.   Remove the LS column from the separator and wash the magnetically labeled cells out with 5 ml MACS buffer using a plunger in a sterile 15 ml tube.   Incubate the CD11b+ cell suspension with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (10 µg per 107 cells) on ice water for 20 min, in order to block the Fc receptors present on the cells’ surface.   Incubate the cell suspension with fluorescently labeled antibodies (1 µg per 107 cells) for another 20 min on ice water, protected from exposure to light. TAM can be sorted on a BD FACS Aria as CD11bpos Ly6Gneg SiglecFneg Ly6Clow cells and can be separated into MHC-IIhigh and MHC-IIlow TAM subsets (Laoui et al., 2014) (Figure 2A).   Wash by adding 10 ml MACS buffer, centrifuge at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.   Meanwhile precoat 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tubes and 15 ml tubes with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, add respectively 1 ml or 2 ml heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.",
    "Shake the tubes gently by hand so that the heat-inactivated fetal calf serum covers the whole surface of the tube, and discard the excess of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. This will prevent the cells to stick to the tubes and hence enhance the recovery of cells.   Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml sorting buffer per 107 cells and transfer into a sterile 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tube precoated with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.   Collect the sorted TAM in 15 ml tubes precoated with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum containing 3 ml complete medium.      Purification tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADC)   Add a 5 µl aliquot of anti-CD11c microbeads per 107 cells and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.   Wash by adding 10 ml MACS buffer, centrifuge at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.   Place an LS column in a MidiMACS Separator attached to a magnetic MultiStand and wash it by putting 3 ml MACS buffer on the top. The liquid passes the column by gravity.   Resuspend the pelleted cells in 1 ml MACS buffer and pipette the labeled cell suspension on top of the LS separation column. Wash the column by adding 3 x 3 ml MACS buffer.   Remove the LS column from the separator and wash the magnetically labeled cells out with 5 ml MACS buffer using a plunger in a sterile 15 ml tube.   Incubate the CD11c+ cell suspension with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (10 µg per 107 cells) on ice water for 20 min, in order to block the Fc receptors present on the cells’ surface.   Incubate the cell suspension with fluorescently labeled antibodies (1 µg per 107 cells) for another 20 min on ice water, protected from exposure to light.",
    "TADC can be sorted on a BD FACS Aria as Ly6Gneg SiglecFneg CD11cpos MHC-IIpos cells. Take care to gate only on the MHC-IIhighest cells and to exclude the MHC-IIhigh TAM, which also express CD11c, albeit at a lower level than TADC (Figure 2B).   Wash by adding 10 ml MACS buffer, centrifuge at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatants.    Meanwhile precoat 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tubes and 15 ml tubes with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, add respectively 1 ml or 2 ml heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Shake the tubes gently by hand so that the heat-inactivated fetal calf serum covers the whole surface of the tube, and discard the excess of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. This will prevent the cells to stick to the tubes and hence enhance the recovery of cells.   Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml sorting buffer per 107 cells and transfer into a sterile 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tube precoated with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.    Collect the sorted TADC in 15 ml tubes precoated with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum containing 3 ml complete medium.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141119/20141119175836_5109.jpg Figure 2.
