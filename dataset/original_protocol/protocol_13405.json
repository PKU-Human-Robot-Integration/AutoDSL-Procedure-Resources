The operator should understand the anatomy of the rectum before administering the enema and look at the anatomical annotations (see Figure 3).\n1.

Pre-therapy preparation of the patients\nHave the patient eliminate both stool and urine before the operation.\nInform the patients that is it normal to experience localized sensations such as swelling, fullness, and mild pain.\nHave patients promptly notify if defecation occurs or if there is discomfort.\n\t​NOTE: The enema solution should be retained for more than 1 h, as the long retention time facilitates drug absorption26.\n3. Preparation of the decocted medicinal liquid\nNOTE: The Hospital of Chengdu University of TCM supplied the raw rhubarb27 (Rheum officinale Baill. DaHuang) (Figure 1).\nAdd 30 g of raw rhubarb and 200 mL of water to the automatic decoction and packaging machine.\nBoil, and then simmer for 5 min.",
    "Filter with a non-woven filter package (24 mm x 30 mm).\nRemove residue with the non-woven filter package and cool down the remaining liquid to 37-39 °C.\n4. Operational procedure\nCheck the patient's basic information (name, age, hospital number), verify the patient's condition, and re-evaluate them. Explain the process and advantages of an enema to the patient, making sure that they can fully understand and relax during it.\nRegulate the room temperature (18-28 °C).\nPrepare all necessary items (Figure 2 and Table of Materials). Check the expiration dates and bring them to the bedside.\nClose all doors and windows. Ensure that the patients are not unnecessarily exposed and are kept warm.\nWash and dry hands, put on disposable gloves, and measure the temperature of the enema liquid using a thermometer beside the bed.\nAssist the patient in assuming the left lateral decubitus position (if necessary, choose the right lateral decubitus position based on the condition). Fully expose the anus, place the center of the treatment sheet under the buttocks, and use a pillow to elevate the buttocks by 10 cm (Figure 3).\nLubricate the front end of the anal canal with paraffin oil, drain the paraffin oil from the anus, and expose the anus.\nAdjust the temperature of the liquid medication to be equivalent to the patient's body temperature (37-39 °C) at a drip rate of 60-80 drops per minute, ensuring that the liquid level does not exceed 35 cm from the anus.\nClose the stopper clip (part of the disposable enema kit) and pour the liquid into the hanging bag (part of the disposable enema kit).\nInstruct the patient to open their mouth to breathe when inserting the anal canal, to relax the anus and facilitate the smooth insertion of the anal canal.",
    "Insert the anus canal 30-35 cm28 with the plastic hose (part of the disposable enema kit), open the stopper clip, and slowly drip the liquid (the dripping rate depends on the patient's condition) for 15 to 20 min.\n\tNOTE: If the plastic hose is blocked, close the stopper clip immediately and squeeze the pressurized bladder (part of the disposable enema kit) to unblock it.\nDuring the infusion, constantly monitor and inquire about the patient's tolerance. Adjust the infusion rate in the event of discomfort or convenience and discontinue the infusion if necessary.\nPerform general Tui na (place fingertips on the perianal skin to gently knead back and forth in a circular motion) to relax the muscles around the anus, before extubation of the plastic hose (Figure 2A)29.\nAfter administering the medication, clamp and remove the plastic hose from the anal canal.\n\tNOTE: The dosage for Chinese herbal enema should not exceed 200 mL.\nAssist the patient in drying the perianal skin by gently rubbing the anus with gauze. Help the patient assume a comfortable lying position and elevate the buttocks.\n\t​NOTE: If the patient has a sluggish pulse, a pale face, cold perspiration, severe abdominal pain, and palpitation, stop the operation immediately and contact a doctor.\n5. Post-operation care\nHave the patient lay in the left lateral position if they are still comfortable.\nHave the patient rest. Advise them to use clean bedsheets, keep the anus dry and clean, and change the bedsheets promptly after fluid flows.\nObserve fluid flow from the anus after the enema. Observethe shape, color, volume, and smell of the stool, to determine the success of the enema.\nAdvise the patient not to use excessive force to relieve stools, and inform healthcare staff promptly of any constipation.",
