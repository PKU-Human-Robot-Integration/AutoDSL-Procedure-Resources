    "The institutional animal care and use committee of the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM) approved all experimental protocols, and animals were treated in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. For this protocol, 3-4-month-old Large White male or female pigs weighing 50-60 kg was used. Animal size can vary according to the investigators' experimental goals.\n1. Animal preparation and anesthetic induction\nPremedicate the animal using an intramuscular injection of atropine (0.04 mg/kg), midazolam (0.3 mg/kg), and ketamine (20 mg/kg). Administer isoflurane at an end tidal concentration of 1%-3% in 3 L/min O2, using a face mask for anesthesia induction and maintenance.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by testing for a relaxed jaw tone, and absence of pain using toe pinch response. Ensure that the animal is placed in dorsal decubitus position and maintained in normothermia using a warming blanket.\nAfter confirming anesthetic adequacy, perform an orotracheal intubation using a 6.5-8 mm endotracheal tube as described in 10.\nPlace the oxygen saturation monitor on the ear or bottom lip of the animal for continuous monitoring. Adjust ventilation to a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cm H2O, a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 0.5, and a respiratory rate (RR) of 15 respirations/min reaching a tidal volume (TV) of 6-8 mL/kg, and normal partial pressure of O2 and CO2. Adjust the RR to maintain an end-tidal CO2 level of 35-45 mmHg.\nGain a peripheral intravenous access via the ear vein using a 20 G catheter. Start a maintenance infusion of normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and administer 2 g of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as an intravenous bolus to prevent arrhythmias.",
    "Prepare the surgical sites by adequately shaving and scrubbing the thorax and groins. Disinfect groins and neck using chlorhexidine and drape appropriately while providing venous and arterial access.\nPlace the cautery electrode pad on the animal's back. Place the animal in Trendelenburg position to facilitate central venous access.\nLocate the right jugular vein using an ultrasound. Once located, using a needle, enter the skin at a 45° angle until blood is seen and the needle is seen in the vein on the ultrasound.\nPlace the guidewire in the needle and then insert a 7 Fr percutaneous central venous sheath introducer over the guidewire.\nRemove the guidewire while keeping the sheath introducer in place, then insert a Swans-Ganz catheter to ensure cardiac output measurements and right-heart catheterization.\n\tNOTE: The left jugular vein can be used instead of the right one. If access is not possible, insert the sheath directly in the internal jugular vein (left or right) after midline sternotomy. In that case, make sure to dissect the vein.\nUsing the same technique, insert a central venous catheter (e.g., double lumen) into the left jugular vein.\nInsert another 7 Fr percutaneous central venous sheath introducer into the right femoral vein using the Seldinger technique as described in steps 1.7. to 1.10., for the introduction of a conductance catheter into the right ventricle (RV). This can be done percutaneously with echo-guidance, or after midline sternotomy.\nAllow a period of stability for 10 min post-intubation and manipulation, then measure baseline hemodynamic and cardiac function parameters including pulmonary and systemic pressures, cardiac output, RV and LV pressure-volume loops, and transthoracic echocardiography.\n2. Establishing surgical access",
    "Using a cautery pen, perform a midline incision from the mid-cervical region to the xiphoid. After that, divide the subcutaneous fat, layer by layer, along the midline using the electrocautery to reach the peri-sternum.\nCut around the sternal notch and use a finger to retract and sweep soft tissues from under the sternum. Open the sternum with a bone saw and ensure the sternum is completely divided while being careful with the vein beneath the upper part of the sternal bone. Cauterize the sternum and/or apply bone wax to ensure adequate hemostasis.\nUsing the electrocautery, dissect and remove the thymus by lifting it from the pericardium. Cauterize the vessels that supply the thymus from the aorta and the superior vena cava (SVC) to prevent bleeding.\nCarefully cut the pericardium open with the cautery. Insert fingers under the pericardium while cutting to avoid injury to the heart.\nAdminister 300 units/kg of heparin IV to achieve systemic anticoagulation. If the test is available, ensure activated clotting time (ACT) ˃ 300 s.\n3. Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies and declaration of death\nAdminister a bolus of 3 mg/kg propofol IV, and then stop mechanical ventilation and disconnect the endotracheal tube.\n\tNOTE: This step corresponds to \"Withdrawal of Life Support\" to launch the Normothermic Regional Perfusion. For euthanasia conditions, refer to section 8.\nMonitor arterial pressure and peripheral O2 saturation. Start functional warm ischemia time when systolic pressure < 50 mmHg.\nEstablish circulatory arrest when there is asystole (or ventricular fibrillation) and an absence of arterial pulsatility. Initiate a minimum observation phase of 5 min after circulatory arrest is established (stand-off period) and subsequently declare animal death.\n4. Placement of thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion",
    "Using the cautery, carefully dissect the aortopulmonary space. Retract the RV outflow tract inferiorly, the pulmonary artery to the left, and the aorta to the right to avoid direct lesions to the latter. Take an assistants help if needed during this step.\nDissect and ligate the supra-aortic vessels to avoid and exclude cerebral perfusion. Alternatively, apply a large cross-clamp over the vessels.\nInsert two 18 G catheters in the carotids bilaterally distally to the occlusion to evaluate potential blood flow to the brain. Collect and measure blood throughout the experiment and reinfuse via the NRP circuit.\nUsing the metzenbaum and right-angle forceps, dissect delicately between the SVC and the innominate artery, and between the IVC and pericardium. Encircle the SVC and IVC using an umbilical tape or a simple 0-silk suture and secure them with a tourniquet.\nUsing a 3-0 suture, place two concentric purse-string sutures on the distal ascending aorta adventitia; avoid full thickness sutures. Place a purse-string suture on the right atrium (RA). Secure all sutures with a tourniquet.\nSetup and prime the NRP system according to the investigators' and experimental needs. For this protocol, use an ECMO circuit with a centrifugal pump, primed with 2 L of crystalloid solution containing 500 mg of Solumedrol, 200 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (NaOH), 300 units/kg of heparin, and 2 g of MgSO4.\n\tNOTE: The setup used here is similar to the one used by the institution's perfusionists at the division of cardiac surgery.\nUsing a 17 to 21 F arterial cannula, cannulate the aorta, then tighten the tourniquet holding the purse-string suture to secure the cannula in place.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, insert an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) cannula using the Seldinger technique to minimize blood loss. Another method consists of using a standard bypass arterial cannula. The aortic cannula is then connected to the arterial line of the NRP circuit using a 3/8-3/8 connector; ensure complete deairing to avoid air embolism.\nCreate a 5 mm incision at the center of the purse-string on the RA, and then dilate it using a small-angled instrument like a right-angle or snap. Cover the incision with a finger to avoid excessive bleeding.\nUse a double-stage venous cannula to cannulate the RA then tighten the purse-string sutures using a tourniquet to secure the cannula in place.\nConnect the cannulas to the venous line of the NRP circuit using a 1/2-3/8 connector and ensure complete deairing to avoid an airlock in the system.\nEnsure that a minimum of 15 min has passed between the declaration of death and the initiation of NRP to encompass for the time needed in clinical practice preparation, draping, and having access to the heart.\nInitiate NRP 15 min after the start of functional warm ischemia time. Maintain normothermia throughout the procedure. Adjust flowrates progressively to reach a perfusion index of 2.5 L/min/m2. Restart mechanical ventilation with an FIO2 of 50% and a TV of 6 mL/kg.\n\tNOTE: Modify these settings according to the experimental design.\nContinuously infuse 10 µg/kg/min of dopamine and 4 units/min of vasopressin IV. Use epinephrine and norepinephrine during initial perfusion and then titrate them as needed to aid in pressure regulation while maintaining arterial pressure above 50 mmHg.\n5. Maintenance of reperfusion and targets for weaning off",
    "Reperfuse the heart for 30 min before attempting to wean for NRP. If weaning is unsuccessful, perform an additional 15 min of reperfusion to support with NRP before attempting to wean again for a total maximum reperfusion time of 180 min.\nProceed to cardiac assessment after successful weaning. If weaning is not achieved after this time, stop the experiment, and report the issue.\n\tNOTE: This should be adapted to each investigator's objectives.\nEvaluate NRP weaning off criteria and ensure that all criteria are met as detailed in Table 1.\n6. Cardiac recovery assessment\nGenerate pressure-volume (PV) loop analyses to measure cardiac contractility. The conductance catheter allows for continuous measurements of LV-PV relations.\n\t\nObtain steady-state recordings to generate volume-dependent parameters, stroke work, and developed pressure, and occlude the IVC with an umbilical tape to generate volume-independent parameters through occlusion, namely preload recruitable stroke work.\nMeasure central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, RV pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure using the Swans-Ganz catheter introduced in the beginning of the experiment.\nAnalyze cardiac function through echocardiography using a standard transesophageal probe and a transthoracic probe placed directly on the heart.\nPerform metabolic assessments by collecting arterial and venous blood samples for analyses. Draw blood directly from the coronary sinus to assess heart metabolic function specifically. Analyze blood gases and lactate levels.\nAdditionally, collect myocardial biopsies from the RV and LV if needed. Obtain samples from other transplantable organs of interest (e.g., lungs, liver, kidneys), depending on the investigator's objectives.\n7. NRP removal and cardiac evaluation\nWhen weaning off criteria are met, stop NRP. Remove the cannula from the RA and quickly tighten the purse-string suture to minimize blood loss. Secure the suture with knots and follow the same procedure to remove the aortic cannula.",
    "Evaluate cardiac function every 30 min for 2 h after NRP has stopped as described in steps 6.1. to 6.4.\n8. Experiment termination\nAfter 2 h, place a 16 G or 18 G cardioplegia catheter in the ascending aorta. Connect the cannula to the NRP circuit.\nAfter that, decompress the right cardiac cavities by incising the IVC and the left cavities by incising the left atrium using the cautery.\nClamp the ascending aorta after the insertion of the cannula and administer 1.5 L of Del Nido cardioplegia solution at 4 °C to the heart. Ensure that the perfusion pressure is 50 mmHg.\nStop the mechanical ventilation and place ice slush (0.9% NaCl) in the thoracic cavity after the initiation of cardioplegia for cooling. Proceed with cardiectomy in a traditional manner once the cardioplegia infusion is complete.\nUse the collected heart to obtain extensive myocardial biopsies for assessment and evaluation. Perform other biopsies from other organs (e.g., lungs, liver, kidneys) depending on the experimental design and objective of the investigators\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 provides a summary of the protocol steps shown and Table 1 provides definition of the parameters and criteria used in this study.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64009/64009fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic summary of the experimental protocol.
