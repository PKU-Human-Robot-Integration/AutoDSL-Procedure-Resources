    "An overview of the whole protocol, divided in four steps, is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315075428_2220.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the complete procedure described in the protocol Cultivation of SynechocystisGrow Synechocystis cells photoautotrophically at 30 °C in BG11 medium (Rippka et al., 1979) supplemented with 1 g L-1 of NaHCO3 (BG11C) under continuous illumination (50 µmol of photons m-2 sec-1, white light from fluorescent lamps). Usually cultivation begins with a pre-inoculum (50 ml) growing in Erlenmeyer flasks covered with cotton and placed on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) located in an illuminated room. These cells are then used to inoculate around 750 ml of BG11C medium in a Roux flask. Finally the culture is scaled to a 5 L bottle (without the cap and covered with cotton). Note: To achieve optimal growth, the cultures in Roux flasks and in 5 L bottles are bubbled with CO2-enriched air (1% v/v), using a rigid polypropylene tube, silicone tubing and metal connectors. A compressed air stream drives bubbling and the air-CO2 mixture is established using flow meters.Estimation of growth phaseA volume of 3-5 L of cells, in exponential or stationary growth phase depending on the purpose of each experiment, is used. Growth phase is estimated by measuring total chlorophyll content in methanolic extracts of cells (McKinney, 1941). Centrifuge 1 ml of culture in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at 12,000 x g. Discard 950 µl of the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the remaining 50 µl. Add 950 µl of methanol and vortex vigorously for 1 min. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min. Chlorophyll concentration is calculated by measuring absorbance at 665 nm in the supernatant (E = 74.46 ng-1 ml cm-1).",
    "Cultures with 2-4 µg/ml of total chlorophyll are considered to be in exponential phase and cultures with more than 5 µg/ml are considered stationary.Harvest cellsCentrifuge at 9,605 x g in a JLA-16.250 Beckman rotor, for 10 min at 4 °C. Combine the cells in a single bottle and estimate fresh weight. 2-5 g of cells are enough for the procedure.Breakage and fractionation of Synechocystis cellsPre-treatmentAll glass materials, porcelain mortar and pestle were heated in a sterilization oven at 200 °C for 3 h and all plastic materials were autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. Note: RNase-free water was used to prepare all buffers.Breakage of Synechocystis cellsPlace in a pre-chilled porcelain mortar the same weight of cells and alumina. Put the mortar on top of an ice bucket with ice. Mix with the pestle and once the cells and the alumina are well mixed continue grinding for 2 min. Add around 20 ml extraction buffer (1 or 10 mM Mg-acetate) with β-mercaptoethanol added immediately before use.Fractionation of Synechocystis cellsRecover as much material as possible in two polypropylene tubes of 15 ml. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min in a JA-25.15 rotor at 4 °C to eliminate the alumina, the cell debris and the unbroken cells. Transfer the supernatant into new 15 ml tubes and centrifuge at 30,000 x g for 30 min in the same rotor at 4 °C. This centrifugation is required to completely eliminate membranes. Freezing reserveDispense aliquots from the supernatant of this centrifugation step (S30 fraction) in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with 5% (v/v) glycerol. For this process, place the 1.5 ml tubes on ice and add 40 µl of 80% (v/v) glycerol and 600 µl of the S30 fraction to each tube.",
    "Mix gently, using a micropipette, and rapidly freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen. Before freezing reserve an aliquot to determine the total protein amount of this S30 fraction by the standard method of Bradford, using albumin bovine as reference (Bradford et al., 1976). Usually 10-15 µg/µl of total protein concentration is obtained in S30 fraction. Notes: When extraction buffer and gradient solutions contain 1 mM Mg-acetate (low Mg2+), most bacterial ribosomes are dissociated into 30S and 50S subunits but when using 10 mM Mg-acetate (high Mg2+), in the buffers and solutions, the 70S vacant ribosome peak is mainly observed.It is worth noting that in cyanobacteria, phycobiliproteins represent around 30% of total protein concentration. This fact must be taken into account when considering the amount of the S30 fraction needed for the next step of this procedure.The S30 fraction can be stored as different aliquots at -80 °C to load separate gradients on different days. This is a backup in case there is any problem in later steps of the protocol, especially in the centrifugation, fractionation or generation of the gradient profiles. Preparation of sucrose gradients and ultracentrifugationPreparation of sucrose gradientsPrepare a 10-30% sucrose gradient using a linear gradient maker connected to a peristaltic pump (P1) working at 120 ml/h. Use sucrose buffer 1 and 2 solutions (either with 1 or 10 mM Mg-acetate), with β-mercaptoethanol added immediately before use, and 13.2 ml ultracentrifuge thin-wall polyallomer tubes. Place the gradient maker on top of a magnetic stirrer plate. Introduce a small magnetic stir bar in the gradient maker compartment connected to the pump. Pour 5.6 ml of sucrose buffer 1 in this compartment and 5.6 ml of sucrose buffer 2 in the other compartment of the gradient maker.",
    "The outlet of the peristaltic pump is connected to a glass capillary that is introduced into the gradient tube. Connect the two compartments of the gradient maker and simultaneously turn on pump P1. Stop the pump when the solutions introduced in the gradient maker are exhausted, before air bubbles enter the gradient. Then remove the capillary from the gradient tube slowly so as not to disturb it. Tubes are stored at 4 °C for about 8 h before use to allow equilibration of the linear sucrose gradients. Before loading, filter the S30 fraction through a 0.45 µm filter unit.UltracentrifugationGently layer the S30 fraction (100-300 µl) on top of the 10-30% sucrose gradient using a micropipette and via single drops close to the surface of the sucrose gradient. Centrifuge at 77,175 x g, for 8 h at 2 °C in a pre-cooled Beckman ultracentrifuge in the  SW 41 Ti  rotor.Isolation of ribosomal particlesCarefully remove the gradient tubes from the centrifuge and completely fill each tube with Milli-Q water before placing it in the ISCO fractionation system. Fractionate the gradient from the top using 60% (w/v) sucrose to push the content of the tube toward the UV detector (A254), with the TRISTM pump (flow rate 1 ml/min). Turn on the recorder (1 cm/min, sensitivity 1) to obtain the sucrose gradient profile while the fractions (0.5 ml) are manually collected. Place the fractions in a container with liquid nitrogen, as they are collected, to freeze them quickly and then store at -80 °C until use.Representative examples of the expected profiles are shown in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170316/20170316024907_4445.jpgFigure 2. Sedimentation profiles showing the free subunits and 70S vacant ribosomes. The Synechocystis S30 supernatant was fractionated on a 10-30% sucrose density gradient in the presence of 1 mM (A) or 10 mM (B) Mg2+.",
    "Small numbers refer to collected fractions. Adapted from (Galmozzi et al., 2016).The treatment of the fractions from this point depends on the use that will be given to them. In the case of analysis by Western blot, precipitate the total protein with 100% (w/v) TCA (see Recipes).Add 55 µl of this solution to each fraction (10% TCA final concentration), incubate on ice for 30 min and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 5415 R) at maximal speed and 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and add 1 ml of -20 °C chilled acetone to each fraction pellet to eliminate residual TCA. Remove the acetone carefully as not to affect the integrity of the pellet. Dry the pellets through evaporation of acetone by incubating the tubes at 60 °C in a thermoblock. Resuspend the pellets in RNase-free Milli-Q water and add loading buffer for standard electrophoresis protocols."
