    "Day 1: Seeding cells (see Note 1)Seed 0.5 x 106 NIH3T3 cells into 1.5 ml media per well of a 6-well cell culture dish. Use one well per experimental condition. If not performing transfection, begin at Step C1.Note: All steps dealing with cells should be performed within a biological safety cabinet until ready to begin immunocytochemistry. Day 2: Transfections (see Note 2)Adherent cells should be at a confluence of 50-80% prior to transfection. Remove media and replace with 1 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) serum and antibiotic-free growth media to maximize transfection efficiency.Transfect each well with a total of 2 μg plasmid DNA encoding protein of interest according to transfection reagent protocol (we use Lipofectamine 3000 with P3000).Aspirate the media of transfected well(s) 6 h post transfection, and replace with 1.5 ml complete media.Day 3: Re-seeding cells (see Note 3)In the biological safety cabinet clean 12 mm cover slips in 70% ethanol. Place the clean coverslips in individual wells of a 24-well cell culture plate. Apply UV light to coverslips in the open 24-well plate for 15 min to sterilize prior to re-seeding cells (see Note 4).Aspirate the media from well(s) of 6-well plate and wash NIH3T3 cells with pre-warmed (37 °C) DPBS. Aspirate DPBS from well(s).Add 500 μl of pre-warmed 37 °C trypsin to each well, and place in an incubator for 3-5 min until cells detach. Add 2 ml media to neutralize trypsin, and count cells in counting chamber.Transfer cell suspension to a 15 ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at ~200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.While cells are in the centrifuge, add 500 μl media to each coverslip-containing well of the 24-well plate.Aspirate the cell supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml pre-warmed media.",
    "Add an appropriate volume of cell suspension so that each well with a coverslip contains 0.1 x 106 cells.Allow 6-8 h for cells to fully attach to the coverslip and allow for cytoneme regrowth, or optimally wait overnight (> 10 h) for full attachment and outgrowth (see Note 5).Day 4: ImmunocytochemistryCrucial: From this point on, do not aspirate. Gently pipette when adding or removing any solution. Attempt to move the plate as little as possible, do not agitate plate during washes. This may fragment or break cytonemes. During incubations and washes, let solutions sit on cells without agitation. Pipette off media and wash cells quickly 3 times with room temperature DPBS.Remove DPBS and add 400 μl of MEM-fix to cells, then incubate for 7 min at room temperature.Pipette off the MEM-fix and wash the cells three times in DPBS at room temperature, for 5 min per wash.While cells are being washed in DPBS, prepare permeabilization buffer. See Recipes for instructions.Remove last DPBS wash, and add 400 μl of permeabilization buffer to each well and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.While cells are permeabilizing/blocking, prepare primary antibody dilutions in PBGT. See recipes for instructions.Remove permeabilization buffer, and add 300 μl of primary antibody dilution to each well. Incubate the plate overnight at 4 °C.Day 5: Secondary antibodies and cover slip mountingPrepare 50 ml of PBGT. See Recipes for instructions.Remove primary antibody dilution, and wash the cells three times in 400 μl of PBGT at room temperature for 5 min per wash.While the cells are being washed, dilute secondary antibodies, phalloidin and DAPI in PBGT. See Recipes for instructions.Remove PBGT, and add 300 μl of secondary antibody dilutions to each well. Incubate plate at room temperature for 1 h in the dark or wrapped in aluminum foil (see Note 6).",
    "Remove secondary antibody dilution, and wash the cells three times in 400 μl of PBGT at room temperature for 5 min per wash. Keep the plate in the dark during washes.Remove final PBGT wash, and add 500 μl distilled water to each well to allow easier removal of coverslips and dilute salt content. Use forceps to gently remove coverslip from well. Remove any excess liquid from the edge of the coverslip by dabbing on a Kimwipe. Mount coverslips by gently placing them on a single drop of ProLong diamond applied to the slide. Avoid applying pressure or disturbing coverslip until ProLong diamond has cured.Let slide cure overnight in the dark at room temperature, and image on inverted confocal microscope within 2 weeks (see Notes 7 and 8)."
