    "The animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of SingHealth, Singapore and are in accordance to the guidelines of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.\n1. Labeling of Erythrocytes and Leukocytes with Fluorescent Dyes\nPreparation of reagents\nPrepare ICG (1.5 mg/mL) by dissolving 3 mg of ICG in 1800 µL of sterilized distilled water. Add 200 µL of 10x phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nPrepare 40% 1x PBS by adding 4 mL of 1x PBS to 6 mL of sterilized distilled water. Prepare 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS by adding 100 mg of BSA to 10 mL of 1x PBS. Mix well until the BSA is dissolved.\nIsolation of erythrocytes and leukocytes using density gradient centrifugation\nAnesthetize the mice (wild type C57BL/6) using a combination of ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) (according to schedule 1, under ARVO guidelines). Confirm anesthesia by pedal withdrawal reflex (i.e., toe pinch).\nSlowly insert the 29 gauge needle (attached to a 1 mL syringe) at a costal angle directed towards the heart. To confirm that the needle is inside the heart, withdraw the plunger slightly and check if blood is withdrawn into the syringe. Exsanguinate 0.8 - 1 mL of blood directly from the heart.\nImmediately transfer the blood into an ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) (1.8 mg/mL of blood) containing blood collection tube and mix gently to prevent coagulation of the blood.\nEuthanize the mice by administering pentobarbital (80 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.",
    "Layer the whole blood on top of a polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate solution (1:1 ratio; density 1.077 g/mL) in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge (450 x g, 30 min) to allow the separation of the leukocytes and erythrocytes from the plasma.\nRemove and discard the supernatant (plasma) using a pipette. Carefully transfer the buffy coat (leukocytes) and erythrocytes (red blood cell layer) into new and separate tubes using pipettes.\nICG (1.5%) labeling of erythrocytes\nWash the erythrocytes with 1x PBS to remove any contaminants. Resuspend the erythrocytes in 1x PBS (1:1) to make 50% hematocrit. Aliquot 0.5 mL of 50% hematocrit (~ 250 µL packed erythrocytes) into microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the erythrocytes (750 x g, 5 min) and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL of 40% 1x PBS to the pelleted erythrocytes, mix well and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Add 100 µL of ICG (1.5 mg/mL) to the erythrocyte suspension, mix gently by inverting the tube, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Add 300 µL of 1x PBS and incubate at 37 °C in a shaker incubator for 60 min.\nCentrifuge the carrier erythrocytes (750 x g, 3 min) and resuspend in 1 mL 1x PBS.\nWash the cells ~ 3 - 5 times with 1x PBS until the supernatant is clear (step 1.3.3). After the last wash, decant the supernatant and add 1% BSA PBS (1:1) to the labeled pre-swelled erythrocytes to achieve a 50% hematocrit (1.25 x 108 cells/mL) of ICG labeled erythrocytes.\nSodium fluorescein (1%) labeling of leukocytes",
    "After separating the buffy coat from the blood using density gradient centrifugation (from step 1.2.6), wash the cells once with 10 mL of 1x PBS by centrifuging at 450 x g for 10 min to remove any contaminants. Resuspend the pellet in 900 µL of 1x PBS.\nAdd 100 µL of 10% sodium fluorescein to 900 µL of the leukocyte suspension and incubate at room temperature for 2 min. Wash the labeled cells three times with 10 mL 1X PBS by centrifuging (450 x g, 10 min). Resuspend the cells into 100 µL 1x PBS.\n2. Live Imaging of Fluorescently Labeled Cells\nLive-cell imaging of ICG labeled erythrocytes\nTo prepare cells for injection via tail vein or retro-orbital route, dilute the 50% hematocrit of ICG labeled erythrocytes by 10-fold and 50-fold with 1x PBS to make 5% and 1% hematocrit cells, respectively.\nPlace the mouse under the infrared light (250W intensity) for 5 min to let the tail vein dilate. Anesthetize the mouse with ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal injection (here, according to schedule 1, under ARVO guidelines).\nDilate each pupil of the eyes with a drop of 0.5% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride.\nPlace the contact lens over one eye for imaging. Use ophthalmic gel as a medium for imaging and to prevent dryness of the cornea. Fix the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy (SLO) camera with +25 diopter lens to compensate for the refraction of the mouse eye.\nPlace the mouse onto the SLO imaging platform. Ensure that the cornea of the mouse is facing straight towards the optical head of the SLO machine.",
    "Switch on the imaging module. Using the associated imaging module software, click on the \"New Patient\" button and add animal identification details such as mouse ear tag number, date of birth, percentage of fluorescent dye and labeled cell type.\n\t\t\nPosition the optic nerve of the animal at the center of the imaging screen by maneuvering the imaging module. Using the associated imaging module software, click on the \"Acquire\" button to take the infrared (IR) fundus images with the 30° or 15° angle view setting. Ensure that the center of the retina, the pupil and the optical path of the laser are aligned to achieve a best quality image.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The optical path is aligned by maneuvering the joystick to obtain the sharpest image and best lighting exposure.\nTake the ICG fundus video.\n\t\t\nTurn on the ICG filter (790 nm), set the camera to high speed mode with the 30° or 15° angle view and set the ICG intensity at 85 for all readings for standardization. On the control panel, click on the \"Acquire\" button to take the video (baseline control) at 8.8/15 frames/s for 1 min.\nLoad 100 µL of ICG labeled erythrocytes into an insulin syringe attached to a 30 gauge needle.\n\t\t\nFor the injection via the tail vein route, insert the needle bevel up into the tail vein. Confirm the intravenous access by checking the backflow of the blood into the syringe and inject the labeled cells into the circulation.\nFor the injection via the retro-orbital route, insert the needle adjacent to the eye into the retro-orbital space. Confirm the retro-orbital access by checking the backflow of the blood into the syringe and inject the labeled cells into the circulation.",
    "After the injection, reposition the mouse and take the IR fundus images (see step 2.1.6.1) and video using the ICG filter (see step 2.1.7.1). The labeled cells in the retinal circulation can be visualized immediately after the injection of the cells.\nAfter acquiring the video frames, extract .tiff images of the video sequences by choosing the .tiff format when exporting the video using the SLO viewing module software. Save the files in a desired folder.\nRemove the contact lens, place it over the other eye, and complete the imaging as described in steps 2.1.4 - 2.1.7.\nAfter imaging, place the anesthetized animal under the infrared light (250W) to maintain the body temperature until it recovers from anesthesia. When the animal is fully recovered, place the mouse back into the holding cage.\nLive-cell imaging of 1% sodium fluorescein labeled leukocytes\nPrepare the mouse and set-up the instrument as described in section 2.1.\nPosition the mouse and take the IR fundus images as described in steps 2.1.4 - 2.1.6.\n\t\t\nObtain the fluorescein angiogram of the mouse using the fluorescein filter (488 nm) with the high-speed camera mode with the 30° or 15° angle view and fluorescein intensity at 85 for all readings for standardization. Record the video (baseline control) at 8.8/15 frames/s (see step 2.1.7.1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Here, multiple tracks of videos (1 min videos) were acquired at different time intervals.\nInject 100 µL labeled leukocytes into the mouse through the tail vein or retro-orbital injection as described in section 2.1.8.\nImmediately after the injection, position the mouse and take the IR fundus images (see steps 2.1.5 and 2.1.6) and the fluorescein angiogram of the mouse (see section 2.2.2).",
    "Observe the labeled cells in the retina or choroidal blood vessels by adjusting the focal point of the scanning laser by turning the focusing knob on the imaging module.\nAcquire the video frames and images using SLO viewing module software (see step 2.1.10) and save it in a desired folder.\nAfter the procedure, follow step 2.1.12 for care of animals.\nImage analysis by MtrackJ software\nOpen the image sequence in ImageJ by clicking on \"File\". Select \"Import\" and choose \"Image sequence\", select the desired image folder, and click \"Open\". A pop up window called \"Sequence options\" will appear on the screen. Click \"Ok\"; the image sequence will open.\nSet the frame interval of the image video by clicking on \"Image\" and select \"Properties\" for velocity measurements. Here, it is 8.8 frames/s.\nOpen the MTrackJ plugin by selecting \"Plugins\". Select \"Tracking\" and then select \"MtrackJ\". A menu should appear.\nTo adjust the tracking settings, select \"Tracking\" (under menu) and check the box \"Move to next time frame index after adding point\".\nTrack the first cell.\n\t\t\nLocate one cell and track the same cell in subsequent frames. On the menu click \"Add\" to add a new track.\nHover the cursor over the image (+ sign) and click on the appropriate cell.\n\t\t\tNOTE: MTrackJ will automatically jump to the next time frame and add a small circle, marking the position of the first point in the trajectory.\nContinue clicking on the current position of the cell while moving through the frames of the image sequence.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Occasionally, the circles marking the previous points in the trajectory interfere with the ability to view the current location. If this occurs, proceed to step 2.3.5.3.1.",
    "Change the display option for the trajectory by clicking on \"Displaying\" in the menu and selecting the option \"display only track points at current time\". To see all the trajectories, de-select this option.\nContinue clicking until the trajectory of the first cell is seen. Then save the track by clicking \"Save\".\nTrack the second cell.\n\t\t\nIn the menu, click \"Add\" to start a new track. Repeat steps 2.3.5.1 - 2.3.5.4 for tracking the new cell. Click on \"Save\" to save the second track.\nContinue these steps for all trackable cells observed. After tracking the cells, click on \"Measure\" and \"OK\" in the menu tab to get the results.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A results window opens up automatically, which can be saved and opened in a spreadsheet for further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
