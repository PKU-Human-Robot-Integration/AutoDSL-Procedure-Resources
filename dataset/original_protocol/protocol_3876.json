    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nPreparative Cardiomyocyte Monolayer Culture\nTiming: 5–7 days\nWe recommend this step for optimal standardization of cardiomyocyte cultures before EHM generation: in particular, if cryo-preserved cardiomyocytes are used or cardiomyocytes that have been enzymatically dispersed (steps 5–13 or alternative digestion protocols). Cardiomyocytes should be cultured in monolayer for 5–7 days before proceeding to EHM generation. If cardiomyocytes are differentiated in monolayer you may directly proceed to step 5.\nNote: Volumes are given for a T75 cell culture flask. For different culture formats (e.g., 6-well plates), volumes need to be adjusted according to surface area.\nAliquot Matrigel for coating\nThaw Matrigel (7–10 mg/mL) for 16–24 hrs on ice at 4°C.\nMix Matrigel well by several slow inversions of the bottle, leave on ice.\nDistribute Matrigel in 250 μL aliquots into 50 mL centrifuge tubes on ice using ice-cold pipette tips.\nFreeze aliquots at -20°C and store for up to 12 months.\nMatrigel coating\nResuspend a frozen Matrigel aliquot in 29.75 mL ice cold PBS to obtain the working dilution of 1:120.\nAdd 6 mL to a T75 flask and ensure uniform distribution.\nCoat flask for a minimum of 60 min at 20–25°C or store at 4°C for up to 14 days.\nPause Point: Matrigel-coated flasks can be stored for 14 days at 4°C. Drying of the coated surface should be prevented.\nCardiomyocyte seeding after enzymatic dispersion\nWarm Matrigel-coated flask to 20–25°C, warm Cardio Culture Medium to 37°C.\nCentrifuge cardiomyocytes in Cardio Recovery Medium (200 x g for 7 min at 4°C).\nAspirate Matrigel from pre-coated flask and add 5 mL of Cardio Culture Medium to flask\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and flick the tube to dislodge the pellet. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of Cardio Culture Medium",
    "Seed into the flask with a density of 0.1–0.2x10E6/cm2.\nReplace 15 mL Cardio Culture Medium every other day.\nThawing of cryo-preserved cardiomyocytes\nWarm Cardio Recovery Medium and a Matrigel-coated flask to 20–25°C, warm Cardio Culture Medium to 37°C.\nRemove cryo-vials containing cardiomyocytes from liquid nitrogen and thaw at 37°C for 3 min.\nDesinfect cryo-vials with 70% EtOH\nRemove cell suspension from cryo-vial with a 2 mL serological pipette and transfer to a centrifuge tube. Wash cryo-vial with 1 mL of Cardio Recovery Medium and add dropwise to the cells.\nSlowly add another 8 mL of Cardio Recovery Medium.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 7 min at 4°C.\nCritical: At this stage, the cells are very sensitive; handle them carefully and avoid extensive pipetting. Use a serological pipette with a wide tip to minimize mechanical disruption of cells.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and flick the tube to dislodge the pellet. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of Cardio Culture Medium.\nStrain the suspension through a 70 μm mesh cell strainer.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nAspirate Matrigel from pre-coated flask and add 5 mL of Cardio Culture Medium to flask\nSeed the cardiomyocyte suspension into the flask with a density of 0.1–0.2x10E6/cm2.\nReplace 15 mL Cardio Culture Medium every other day.\nEnzymatic Dispersion of Human PSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 30–45 min\nThis step establishes a single cell suspension of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes for EHM generation.",
    "Critical: This protocol has been optimized for cardiomyocyte monolayer cultures. We typically use cardiomyocytes between days 18–25 of differentiation. For other cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols, e.g. 3D embryoid bodies, alternative digestion protocols have been published (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Kattman et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Tiburcy et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). For optimal standardization we recommend to plate cardiomyocytes in monolayer culture first (steps 1–3) and then use this digestion protocol when making EHM.\nNote: Volumes are given for a T75 cell culture flask. For different culture formats (e.g., 6-well plates), volumes need to be adjusted according to culture plate surface area.\nWarm Cardio Recovery Medium, PBS, and Accutase to 20–25°C. Warm Versene to 37°C.\nAspirate medium from flask with human PSC-derived cardiomyocytes.\nAdd 6 mL of Accutase to the cells and incubate for 15–45 min at 20–25°C until cells start to visibly detach (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/79-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Enzymatic Dispersion of Monolayer Cardiomyocytes\nBrightfield images of monolayer cardiomyocytes (cultured according to steps 19–23) at indicated stages of enzymatic dispersion. Note, that Versene should be added once larger aggregates of cardiomyocytes lift off the culture plate surface. Bar graph: 50 μm.\nNote: Depending on cell density, culture conditions, and time point of differentiation, this may occur after 15 min, but may take up to 45 min. Check detachment repeatedly under the microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: During this incubation time, preparation of fibroblasts (see steps 22–26) can be commenced.\nAdd 6 mL of Versene to the Accutase and incubate at 20–25°C for a further 5 min.\nStop the digestion by adding 12 mL of Cardio Recovery Medium to the Accutase/Versene mix. Pipette up and down gently with a 10 mL serological pipette to ensure a single cell suspension, and transfer cells to a fresh collection tube.",
    "Wash flask once more with 6 mL of Cardio Recovery Medium and add to the collection tube. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 7 min at 4°C.\nCritical: At this stage, the cells are very sensitive; handle them carefully and avoid extensive pipetting. Use a serological pipette with a wide tip to minimize mechanical disruption of cells.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and flick the tube to dislodge the pellet. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of Cardio Recovery Medium.\nStrain the suspension through a 70 μm mesh cell strainer.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Leave the cells on ice.\nEnzymatic Dispersion of Human Fibroblasts\nTiming: 20 min\nThe culture of human foreskin fibroblasts has been described in detail (Schlick et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). This step establishes a single cell suspension of fibroblasts for EHM generation.\nAlternatives: Fibroblasts from other sources including PSC-derived fibroblasts can be used.\nNote: Volumes are given for a T75 cell culture flask. For different culture formats (e.g., 6-well plates), volumes need to be adjusted by scaling to surface area.\nWarm Cardio Culture Medium and TrypLE Express to 37°C.\nWash cells with 6 mL TrypLE Express, aspirate and add 6 mL of TrypLE Express again. Incubate at 37°C for 5–10 min.\nStop the digestion by adding 12 mL of Cardio Culture Medium.\nPipette up and down, and pass the cell suspension through a 70 μm mesh cell strainer into a fresh 50 mL centrifuge tube to remove excess extracellular matrix.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Leave the cells on ice.\nCryo-Preserved Human Fibroblasts (Alternative)\nTiming: 15 min",
    "EHM can be made directly from cryo-preserved fibroblasts. The advantage of this approach is that fibroblast properties are very standardized over experimental series if the same pool of fibroblasts is used. The following steps describe the preparation of cryo-preserved fibroblasts for EHM generation.\nWarm Cardio Culture Medium to 15–25°C.\nRemove cryo-vials containing fibroblasts from liquid nitrogen and thaw at 37°C for 3 min.\nDisinfect cryo-vial with 70% EtOH.\nRemove cell suspension from cryo-vial with a 2 mL serological pipette and transfer to a tube. Wash cryo-vial with 1 mL of Cardio Culture Medium, add dropwise to the cells.\nSlowly add another 8 mL of Cardio Culture Medium.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of Cardio Culture Medium.\nStrain the suspension through a 70 μm mesh cell strainer.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Leave the cells on ice.\nGeneration of EHM\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIn this step cardiomyocytes (from step 13) and fibroblasts (from step 18 or 27) are combined into a cell mix and then reconstituted in a collagen hydrogel. The cell-hydrogel mixture is cast into molds and left to solidify (condense) for 1 hr in an incubator. This step is completed by adding medium to the condensed EHM hydrogels.\nDetermine the number of EHM to be prepared based on the number of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts prepared on ice (live cells):\nMix the appropriate number of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts into a new tube according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and centrifuge tube at 200 x g for 7 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell mix in 4°C cold EHMM+T (volume according to cell mix in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). Leave the cell mix on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_79_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_79_7.csv",
    "Note: A collagen concentration of 0.3 mg/EHM is recommended. A collagen stock solution containing 6-7 mg/mL is recommended. Volumes of the other EHM components have to be adapted according to the volume of the collagen stock solution needed to obtain on optimal EHM collagen content. The NaOH amount may have to be adapted individually for optimal pH neutralization (see Critical point below).\nPrepare the EHM hydrogel on ice in the exact order listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. To a 50 mL centrifuge tube on ice:\nAdd the acid soluble collagen.\nAdd the 2x RPMI and mix by swirling the tube.\nAdd 0.1 N NaOH and mix by swirling the tube.\nAdd the cell mix.\nMix the entire suspension well by triturating >10 times with a serological pipette.\nCritical: pH neutralization of the acid soluble collagen must be confirmed by inspection of the phenol red indicator transition from yellow to pink. At this point, the condensation (solidification) of collagen will commence and must not be disrupted so the following steps should be performed swiftly.\nNote: As collagen is very viscous, pipette slowly to avoid air bubble formation.\nDistribute 180 μl of EHM hydrogel with a 1 mL pipette tip evenly into each well of a 48-well EHM plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Ensure an even distribution of hydrogel in each well by lightly tapping the plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/79-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation and Parallel Culture of 48 EHM in a Multi-well Format\n(A) 48-well EHM plate used for the construction of EHM.\n(B) EHM forming between two poles over time. The prepared hydrogel becomes opaque after 1 h (dashed boxes indicate inner and outer boundary of the hydrogel) and compacts notably by 24 h. After four weeks in culture, EHM are typically analyzed.",
    "(C) Breaks in the hydrogel (arrow) will prevent correct EHM formation. Bar graph: 5 mm.\nNote: If breaks in the hydrogel occur (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C arrow), an intact EHM loop will not form.\nCarefully transfer the 48-well plate to the incubator. Let the reconstitution mix settle for 1 h, after which it will appear opaque (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCarefully add 600 μl of 37°C EHMM+T per well and incubate for 24 h.\nExchange 500 μl of EHMM+T per well daily for the first three days of EHM formation. Afterwards, feed with EHMM (without TGF-β1) until analysis.\nNote: After the initial phase of cell independent hydrogel condensation, fibroblasts will start to compact the cell-hydrogel mixture. Within 24 h, EHM should have almost completely formed a loop structure (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Spontaneous contractions of the EHM loops can typically be observed after 3 days of EHM formation and will noticeably increase over time in culture.\nMonitoring of Contractile Function in Culture\nTiming: 5 min\nEHM culture is typically performed for 28 days, but can be further extended. We have tested EHM cultures in a multi-well format for up to 12 months without an apparent loss of function. Functional assessment of EHM can be performed by video-optic analyses or in a standard organ bath set-up under isometric conditions after removal of EHM from the multi-well plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) at any day during culture.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/79-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Removal of EHM from Multi-well Plate for Individual Culture and Analyses\nEHM can be easily removed from multi-well plate with sterile forceps for continuous individual culture or analysis. In this example the transfer to a metal hook for a contractile force measurement under isometric conditions and electrical field stimulation (note electrodes on left and right of the isometrically suspended EHM) is shown. Bar graph: 1 cm.",
    "Exchange 500 μl of EHMM per well (without TGF-β1) daily.\nNote: An “every-other-day” feeding interval may be applied once or twice a week."
