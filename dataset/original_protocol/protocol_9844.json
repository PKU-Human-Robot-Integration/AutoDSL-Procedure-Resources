    "1. Colony-level rearing of P. maidis adults\nPlant a minimum of four pots of corn per week per rearing cage, with 3-4 seeds per pot. Grow in an insect-free environment.\nWhen plants are ~5 weeks old, place inside a 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm cage.\nObtain a sufficient quantity of P. maidis adults (~500) from a research laboratory or the wild, and place into an insect-proof cage with 9-12 corn plants (3-4 pots).\nMaintain the colony in an insect-rearing incubator at 25 °C (± 1 °C), with at least 70% humidity and a 14:10 light cycle.\nTo generate an age-calibrated colony, remove all initial adults after four days of egg laying, and allow the embryos laid in the cage to hatch and age naturally.\nMove 5-week-old P. maidis insects (adults) to fresh corn plants for weekly subculture by collecting with an aspirator (Figure 1). Then, release the adults into a clean cage with fresh corn plants. To maintain a steady supply of young adults for experimental purposes, prepare fresh age-calibrated cages every week.\nWater the pots in the cages twice daily. Periodically clip stalks, remove decaying plant material, and replace with fresh corn pots as needed.\n\t​NOTE: With proper maintenance, a colony can last ~5 weeks (i.e., long enough for embryos laid in the cage to become adults).\n2. Agarose-based egg-laying chamber\nMake egg collection dishes (oviposition medium) by pouring 1% w/v agarose in water into clean 100 mm x 15 mm Petri dishes. Store the oviposition medium at 4 °C after it solidifies.\nPrepare 10% w/v sucrose solution for feeding the adults. Store the sucrose solution at -20 °C for up to a month.",
    "Make a chamber to hold the adults by cutting a hole in the bottom of a 1 oz cup (see the Table of Materials) and gluing a screen over the hole for air exchange (Figure 2).\nCut plastic paraffin wax film into 5 cm x 5 cm squares; set aside 2 squares for each cup.\nCollect ~15 1-week-old adult females from an age-calibrated P. maidis colony. To select females, examine the ventral side of the abdomen, and look for the ovipositor, which is typically darker than the rest of the abdomen (Figure 3). Hold adults for up to one hour in a 15 mL conical vial if setting up multiple egg-laying chambers. Chill the insects briefly on ice prior to sexing and transfer to the adult container.\n\tNOTE: This examination can be done without a microscope. Adult females that have had time to feed and mate also typically have larger abdomens than adult males and are more docile; hence, they can more easily be selected from a cage population.\nTransfer the females into an adult container, and seal the cup with 1 layer of plastic paraffin wax film by evenly stretching it 3-4 times its original size (Figure 4A,B).\nApply 400 µL of 10% w/v sucrose solution to the top of the plastic paraffin wax film seal, and add a second layer of plastic paraffin wax film, stretching the plastic paraffin wax film exactly as above (Figure 4C,D).\n\t​NOTE: The sandwich of stretched plastic paraffin wax film pressurizes the sucrose solution, which is very important for adult feeding, but will not prevent females from piercing their ovipositors all the way through into the oviposition medium.",
    "Place the adult chamber on an egg collection dish with the plastic paraffin wax film side directly on the oviposition medium, and wrap the entire egg-laying chamber with plastic wrap without covering the air holes, as these are required for air exchange (Figure 5).\nIncubate each egg-laying chamber at 25 °C with 70% humidity and a 14:10 light cycle.\nChange the sandwich of plastic paraffin wax film and 10% w/v sucrose solution daily, and remove any water that accumulates inside the cup.\n3. Embryo collection and alignment in a high-humidity environment\nSet up a stereomicroscope-based microinjection system in a humidified space or hood (humidified hood; Figure 6) to ensure the working environment achieves at least 70% humidity throughout the microinjection process.\nCheck the oviposition medium for eggs after the desired egg-lay period. Do this in a humidified hood or another humid environment.\n\tNOTE: The egg-lay period typically used was overnight, from 6 PM to 10 AM, lasting ~16 h.\nIf any eggs are laid in the agarose, use fine forceps to carefully dig them out, and place them on the surface of the agarose to keep them moist (Figure 7A).\nApply a strip of 1 mm x 15 mm double-sided tape on a 22 mm x 30 mm coverslip (Figure 7B). Place the coverslip tape-side up on the oviposition medium (Figure 7C).\nPick up each individual egg from the agar surface, and move to the double-sided tape using a fine brush. Remove any eggs that are completely white or have black coloration on them. Healthy eggs will be the semi-transparent.\nPlace the banana-shaped eggs on their side, with the larger end stuck on the double-sided tape (Figure 7D).",
    "​NOTE: Always keep the eggs in a high-humidity environment, such as a Petri dish cast with a layer of 1% agar on the bottom.\n4. Preparation of CRISPR reagents and injection needles\nPull quartz needles using a Flaming/Brown type micropipette puller.\nBevel the quartz needles using a micropipette beveler.\nUse double-sided sticky tape to secure pulled needles in a clear container, such as a Petri dish, until ready to use.\nPrepare the injection solution by combining 0.5 µL of Cas9 protein (5 µg/µL stock solution) and 0.5 µL of sgRNA (4 µg/µL stock solution; see the Table of Materials) with 1 µL of phenol red buffer in a final volume of 5 µL. To precipitate particles that could clog the needle, vortex the solution briefly, and centrifuge for 3 min at maximum speed.\nBackfill the injection needle, taking care to leave the injection mix near the tapered end of the needle. Remove bubbles, if any, from the tip of the needle.\nCarefully place the backfilled needle into the needle holder, and tighten the stainless steel collar to hold the needle securely in place during microinjection.\nGenerate a reliable flow of injection solution from the needle by gently stroking the beveled tip with a fine, dampened paintbrush, while delivering bursts of air pressure to the needle with the injection system.\n\t​NOTE: The needle is ready for injection when the injection mix can leave the tip in small amounts.\n5. Microinjection and post-injection care\nPrepare a microinjection platform by filling a clean 100 mm x 15 mm Petri dish with 1% agar to form a level layer of agar that is flush with the top of the dish.\nPlace a previously prepared coverslip with ~25 embryos upon the agar platform (Figure 8A).",
    "NOTE: All injection steps must be performed inside a humidified hood (~70% humidity).\nCheck the injection pressure by placing the needle tip in a drop of water and initiating the injection cycle.\n\tNOTE: A small amount of injection solution should disperse into the water if the pressure setting is correct (Figure 8B).\nInsert the needle into the larger end of the embryo, approaching from the left side of the coverslip (Figure 8C). Deliver the injection solution into the egg, and pull out the needle quickly.\nAfter all eggs are injected, place the coverslip on the surface of a new 1% agar dish, and transfer the dish to a humidity chamber (Figure 9).\n6. Incubating and hatching of embryos\nPut the hatching chamber in a 25 °C incubator for 6 days.\nTransfer any surviving embryos, using clean water and a fine brush, to a 35 mm x 10 mm Petri dish with water-moistened filter paper covering the bottom of the dish. Seal the Petri dish with plastic paraffin wax film, and hold at 25 °C to allow the embryos to hatch. Start checking the embryos 6 days post-injection for survival.\n\tNOTE: First instar nymphs will start hatching around day 8.\nTransfer nymphs, using a fine brush, to a Petri dish containing leaf clippings. Cover the dish, and seal with plastic paraffin wax film.\nIncubate the sealed dish of hatchlings on leaf cuttings for 48 h at 25 °C.\nTransfer all 2-day-old nymphs from a round of injections to a rearing cage with corn plants using a fine brush. If injectees with visible phenotype are recovered in sufficient numbers, rear them separately to maximize the recovery of the target trait in the next generation. Otherwise, perform mass-mating of all the injectees.",
    "NOTE: Place hatchlings gently in the whorl of the corn plant to provide refuge and ensure proper humidity of their immediate environment.\nRear the insects in the conditions described above, ensuring proper temperature, humidity, and regular transfers to fresh corn plants.\nScreen progeny for expected phenotypes. Place individuals exhibiting the desired phenotype into their own cage to establish homozygous lines."
