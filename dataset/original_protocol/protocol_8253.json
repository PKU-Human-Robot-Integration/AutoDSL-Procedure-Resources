    "All experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Harvard Standing Committee on Animal Care following guidelines described in the US NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Adult C57BL/6 mice of either sex (6-15 weeks of age) were used for all experiments.\n1. Obtain Aqueous Silk Fibroin\nPrepare or purchase aqueous silk fibroin (5-7.5% w/v).\n2. Mix Aqueous Silk with AAV Expression Vectors\nChoose an AAV expression vector to drive the optogenetic protein or fluorescent indicator of choice.\n\tNote: To minimize the volume of silk/AAV that must be applied to implants while still driving robust expression, stock-titer AAV (stock titers typically obtained from vector cores are around ~1013 gc/mL) is recommended.\nImmediately prior to coating implants, thaw an aliquot of AAV and combine with 5-7.5% aqueous silk fibroin (this mixture will be referred to as silk/AAV). In a 200 µL PCR tube, mix aqueous fibroin and AAV in a 1:1 ratio (for cranial windows use 1:4) immediately prior to the application. Gently pipette the solution in and out several times to thoroughly mix the fibroin and AAV.\nKeep silk/AAV mixture on ice prior to use.\n3. Prepare Equipment for Fabrication and Storage of Silk/AAV-Coated Devices\nProcure equipment for coating optical fibers and Gradient-Index (GRIN) lenses (Figures 1, 2).\n\t\nConstruct a stable ferrule holder. To hold ceramic ferrules, drill 1.25 mm holes in a block of ¼” sheet acrylic. Tap holes to insert set screws from the side to hold ferrules in place.\n\t\t​Note: Any clamp can be used for this purpose.\nPosition a manipulator with sub-millimeter precision to move the optical fibers (stereotaxic apparatus or other precision micromanipulator).\nAssemble a stable holder to position the microinjector.\nUse a stereoscope to visualize optical fibers and silk droplet.",
    "Position a light source to illuminate the optical fibers.\nPrepare equipment for coating cranial windows (Figure 3).\n\t\nChoose any P10 pipettor.\nObtain a container with lid.\n\t\tNote: Any container with a silicone bottom is suggested—the soft bottom facilitates lifting up cranial windows.\nPrepare equipment to store finished implants (Figure 4).\n\t\nObtain a small (1-5 L) vacuum chamber.\nMake sure that there is space to store implants in a 4 °C refrigerator.\n4. Apply Silk/AAV Film to Devices\nCoating optical fibers to drive focal expression at the fiber tip\nPrepare chronic fiber implants as previously described4.\nPrior to use, rinse implants with ethanol, then with ultrapure water to ensure that the optical fibers are clean.\n\t\tNote: Silk films adhere more reliably to clean glass surfaces.\nPrepare a device to hold fiber ferrules. For typical 1.25 mm diameter ferrules, use a block ¼ inch clear acrylic, with ~1.3 mm holes, and tapped set screws entering from the side to hole implants firmly in place (Figure 1A).\nMount the ferrule holder into a stereotaxic apparatus (or any manipulation solution with submillimeter precision) equipped with a microinjector. Place the ferrule holder above the microinjector and apply the silk/AAV mixture from below.\n\t\tNote: This is because applications of large volumes from above resulted in silk/AAV that was not restricted to the tip. However, the application of many small sequential volumes from above or below can produce AAV/silk deposits that are confined to the tip (although we prefer to apply from below).\nPull a standard intracranial injection pipette from borosilicate glass capillary.\n\t\t\nTo make it easier to",
    "To produce an injection tip with a clean flat tip of the desired diameter, hold one pipette in each hand and use the thicker part of the taper on one pipette to score the other pipette at the desired break location.\nGently rub back and forth in a sawing motion (the glass-on-glass scoring method).\nAfter scoring the pipette, apply gentle pressure to the tip of the scored pipette with the body of the other pipette to achieve a clean break.\nPosition a stereoscope to give a clear view of the optical fiber faces.\n\t\tNote: Magnification should be sufficient to accurately position the injection pipette above the face of optical fibers.\nInsert fiber implants into holder with the brain-side of the optical fiber facing downward.\nLoad the injection pipette with silk/AAV solution, as for any standard intracranial injection5. Load the amount required for the number of implants being made, plus ~30% extra to accommodate losses due to pipettes clogging. For example, if 10 implants are being made, then load with 100 nL deposits and withdraw ~1.3 µL.\n\t\tNote: Silk/AAV may dry at the pipette tip in between ejections, which can clog the pipette. Large diameter pipettes (50-100 µm) are less likely to clog. Clogs can be dislodged by gentle brushing down the tip of the pipette with a wet paper wipe or alcohol swab.\nManeuver the injection pipette until it is touching or nearly touching the center of the optical fiber surface. Eject 10-20 nL of silk/AAV solution. Withdraw the pipette.\n\t\tNote: The rate of delivery is not critical, but typical rates are 5-20 nL/s.\nObserve the bolus of silk/AAV on the flat surface which appears as a liquid dome that dries to a flat film within ~1 min (Figure 1B).",
    "Repeat steps 4.1.9-4.1.10 until the desired amount of silk/AAV is deposited (a total of 20-200 nL for most applications). When preparing multiple implants, apply silk/AAV to one implant and then move on to coat other implants before returning to the first.\nAllow 1 h for drying before moving implants.\nVacuum desiccate overnight at ~125 Torr (-25 in. Hg), 4 °C. Do this by placing the entire ferrule holder into a vacuum chamber.\nEvaluate the shape and position of the resulting silk film under a high-power microscope. Ensure that films are confined to the tip of the optical fiber surface, be relatively thin (>100 µm), and symmetrical (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNote: Large or asymmetrical silk/AAV films may dislodge from the fiber during implantation (Figure 1D). The most common cause of problems arises from the application of single large volumes rather than the sequential application of many small volumes.\nCoating tapered optical fibers to drive expression along the fiber axis\nObtain tapered optical fiber implants and perform steps 4.1.2-4.1.8, except that the tapered fiber is positioned laterally such that it is perpendicular to the injector (Figure 2A). Position the injector above the tapered fiber.\n\t\tNote: Loading liquid droplets onto tapered fibers poses added challenges, because surface tension tends to cause droplets to jump back onto the injection pipette or migrate up the tapered fiber. Smaller injection pipettes (30-50 µm diameter) help to overcome this problem but increase the risk that the injection pipette will clog. Due to surface tension, droplets tend to adhere to the area of largest surface area, so the optimal injection pipette size is dependent on the size of the tapered fiber and one’s tolerance for the occasional clog.",
    "Position the silk/AAV injection pipette against the side of the optical fiber at the beginning of the taper. Make sure the injection pipette is touching the optical fiber.\nEject 20 nL of silk/AAV to start the coating process. Ensure that the droplet adheres to the optical fiber and remains at the interface of the fiber/pipette. Gently wick the droplet towards the end of the fiber tip as the silk/AAV dries (~45 s). Keep the injecting pipette in contact with the drying droplet to avoid clogging the pipette tip.\n\t\tNote: Each deposit should coat approximately 400 µm of the tapered fiber (Figure 2B).\nWhen the first bolus has dried almost completely, eject another 20 nL and continue wicking the droplet along the taper.\n\t\tNote: The liquid silk will adhere to the dried silk, anchoring one end of the droplet as the pipette moves along the taper.\nRepeat step 4.2.4 by ejecting small amounts of silk/AAV, and gradually drawing the solution up the side of the taper. 5-6 ejections are sufficient to traverse the surface of a 2.5 mm taper.\nTo drive more uniform expression around all sides of the fiber, rotate the fiber and repeat steps 4.2.2-4.2.5 until the desired amount of silk/AAV has been deposited.\nIf a hanging strand of dried silk/AAV extends beyond the fiber tip, carefully cut the strand with scissors, or use the ejection pipette to bend the strand back and adhere it to the taper of the fiber.\nAllow 1 h for drying before moving implants.\nVacuum desiccate overnight in 4 °C. The entire ferrule holder can be placed into a vacuum chamber.\nEvaluate the shape and position of the resulting silk film under a high-power microscope.",
    "Note: Films need not be entirely uniform but should not have bumps that extend more than 100 µm beyond the surface of the fiber to minimize damage to surrounding tissue during implantation (Figure 3C). To minimize film size, it is critical that each droplet is completely dry before subsequent deposits are made.\nCoating GRIN lens implants\nObtain GRIN lenses6,7 and repeat steps 4.1.2-4.1.8. The injector can be mounted above.\nDeposit silk/AAV in a single ejection (1 µL for a 1.0 mm diameter lens).\n\t\tNote: This will yield a dome of liquid that adheres to the face of the lens, and dries to produce a uniform film (100-200 µm thick). However, in the event that a single large ejection dries unevenly and produces a film that is thicker near the edges of the GRIN lens, try depositing multiple smaller droplets (100-200 nL) in the center of the lens surface (allowing each droplet to dry before depositing the next) to ensure that the film will drive expression at the center of the field of view.\nAllow 1 h for drying before moving implants.\nEvaluate the shape and position of the resulting silk film under a high-power microscope to ensure that the film covers the surface of the lens.\nCoating glass cranial windows\nPrepare glass cranial windows by adhering two 3 mm diameter round coverslips (no. 1 thickness) to one 5 mm diameter window with optical adhesive (for details, see Goldey et al. 20148).\nMix silk:virus in a ratio of 1:4 to reduce the total amount of silk in the film. Excessive quantities of silk do not dissolve beneath cranial windows after implantation. Titration experiments may be required to determine the ratio and volume that gives the desired expression profile.",
    "Hand pipette a 5 µL droplet onto the surface of the 3 mm (brain facing) coverslip. The droplet should spread out to cover the entire glass surface (Figure 3).\nAllow 2-3 h for drying before moving windows.\n5. Storing silk/AAV-coated implants\nStore silk/AAV-coated optical fibers in a cooled vacuum desiccator (~125 Torr, 4 °C) prior to use (Figure 4A).\nDo not store cranial windows and GRIN lenses under vacuum, as large silk films stored under vacuum fail to fully dissolve after implantation. Implant cranial windows and GRIN lenses immediately after drying, or within a day of manufacture if stored at atmospheric pressure and 4 °C.\n6. Implanting the Devices\nPrepare animals for implant surgery as previously described4.\n\t\nBriefly, anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) and check the depth of anesthesia using a gentle toe-pinch. Shave the skull in the area of the implant and clean the scalp with iodine and alcohol.\nMount animals in a stereotaxic device and supplement anesthesia using a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane (1-2%). Make an incision in the scalp over the area of interest, and perform a craniotomy large enough to accommodate the implant.\nImplant optical fibers9 and microendoscope lenses10 according to previously published procedures. Handle implants with care, as the silk/AAV deposit can be knocked off by an imperfect craniotomy, or by the implant catching on the edge of the skull. Lower the implant into the brain slowly (~2 mm/min).\nImplant cranial windows as describe previously8. Do not touch the coated side of the window and avoid rinsing the window with fluid if performing gavage, as this may wash away the virus. To achieve maximal expression, perform a durotomy.\n7. Evaluating the Expression and Troubleshooting",
    "To evaluate expression of virally-expressed proteins, allow ~2-3 weeks for the virus to drive expression, then perform intracardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline solution11 and process brain tissue for fluorescent microscopy12.\nEvaluate the expression by using fluorescent microscopy to image the expression pattern of fluorophore-tagged optogenetic proteins.\nIf the level of expression is insufficient, increase the amount of virus in coatings by either increasing the total volume of the silk/AAV coating, or preferably by using a higher titer virus.\nSubscription Required.
