    "Generation of stable reporter cell lines using the Flp-In NIH/3T3 cell lineCell plating for transfectionSeed cells at 1.62 M cells/plate in a 10-cm plate in 10 ml of growth media. Culture the cells at 37 °C until they reach 80% confluency (about 18-24 h, Figure 1).Note: Prepare 1 plate of cells for each reporter construct, plus 1 additional plate for the pCAG-GFP, which serves as both a negative control for the Flp-In and a reference for transfection efficiency.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313200011_1171.jpgFigure 1. Confluency (80%) at the time of transfection. Phase contrast, 10x magnification. Scale bar represents 400 μm. TransfectionOne hour before transfection, remove media from cells and replace with 6 ml fresh growth media.Dilute DNA: In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 1.35 μg pEF5-FRT-GFP-Kif26b and 12.15 μg pOG44 to 675 μl of serum-free media (plain DMEM). In parallel, for the GFP control plate, prepare a tube of 675 μl serum-free media with 13.5 μg of pCAG-GFP but no pOG44. Mix well by pipetting. Note: Total mass of transfected DNA is 13.5 μg. Transfect with a 1:10 molar ratio of reporter plasmid to flp recombinase; adjust masses according to the size of the plasmid.Dilute the GenJet transfection reagent: for each plate, prepare a separate 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube of 40.5 μl GenJet transfection reagent in 675 μl of serum-free media (plain DMEM). Mix well by pipetting.Add each tube of diluted GenJet solution all at once to each respective DNA solution. Note: The GenJet solution must be added to the DNA solution, not the reverse. Vortex gently for 4 sec to mix. Incubate the transfection mixes for 15 min at room temperature. Do not let the incubation proceed for more than 20 min. Add the transfection mixes drop-wise to their respective plates of cells.",
    "Gently rock the plates to mix well and return the plates to the incubator.After 12-18 h, check transfection efficiency by visualizing the GFP control plate under a fluorescent microscope (Figure 2). Remove transfection media and replace with 10 ml of growth media.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313200150_4814.jpgFigure 2.

Antibiotic selectionTwo days after transfection, split each 10-cm plate into 4 x 10-cm plates in growth media to avoid overcrowding cells during selection (do not use selection antibiotics during the split).After cells adhere to the plate, remove media and replace with fresh growth media containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Replace with fresh hygromycin media every 3-4 days. Selection should take about 7-10 days. Between 6-20 colonies per plate is typically expected (Figure 3). Note: A kill curve was conducted to determine that 200 μg/ml hygromycin B is optimal for NIH/3T3 Flp-In cells. The optimal selection concentration may vary slightly depending on the source of hygromycin B and cell lines. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313200247_8757.jpgFigure 3. A representative colony at 7 days post-hygromycin B selection. Phase contrast, 4x magnification. Scale bar represents 1,000 μm. Cells may be pooled from 1 or 2 10-cm plates into a single well of a 6-well plate and passaged in growth media without selection antibiotics. Note: This step is only performed for the reporter constructs. The GFP control plate, which should yield no colonies, is discarded. Wnt5a stimulation assayExperimental design: For a basic Wnt5a stimulation, include one condition for stimulation (+Wnt5a, where Wnt5a-containing media is added) and one condition for control (-Wnt5a, where control buffer-containing media is added) for each reporter cell line.",
    "The experiment setup will vary depending on your application of the assay; see Data analysis section for details on other types of stimulations.Seed reporter cells at 0.09 million/well in the poly-D-lysine-coated 48-well plate in 400 μl growth media per well. Cells should be about 90% confluent. Notes:  Plate coating is done by adding 200 μl of a poly-D-lysine solution (0.1 mg/ml in water; sterile filtered) to each well of a 48-well plate, incubating at room temperature for 15 min, removing the poly-D-lysine solution, and washing the wells with 400 μl of water three times. Air dry the plate completely (with the lid removed) before plating cells. Coated plates can also be stored at room temperature for future use. For quantification, we typically plate cells in triplicate wells for each experimental condition.The next day, gently remove media and replace with 400 μl growth media containing 10 nM Wnt-C59. Wnt-C59 inhibits the processing and secretion of endogenous Wnts. Allow cells to reach 100% confluency in Wnt-C59-containing media (generally one day). Cells should be as confluent as possible on the day of Wnt5a stimulation. Note: If the monolayer of cells retract or peel off, repeat cell plating. Retracted cells do not signal well.To stimulate cells with Wnt5a, gently remove media and replace with media containing 10 nM Wnt-C59 and the respective concentration of Wnt5a. For mock stimulation, use media containing Wnt-C59 and Wnt control buffer. If other drugs are used in conjunction with Wnt5a, pretreatment of the drug (typically for 1 h) may be necessary before addition of Wnt5a- and drug-containing media. Avoid disturbing the cell monolayer during media change.Incubate cells with Wnt5a at 37 °C for 6 h. To harvest cells for flow cytometry analysis, dissociate the cells with 100 μl trypsin per well at 37 °C for 3-5 min.",
    "Neutralize the trypsin with 500 μl of growth media and transfer the cell suspensions to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge cells at 12,000 x g at 4 °C for 3 min to pellet the cells.Remove the supernatant from each sample. Avoid disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the pellets at room temperature in 100-150 μl flow cytometer buffer. Mix by pipetting until the sample is homogenously resuspended and strain the cell suspension into a round-bottom tube through the strainer cap.Analyze the cells using a flow cytometer. We routinely use the Becton Dickinson FACScan and analyze 30,000 cells per sample.Analyze data files in software (e.g., FlowJo). See next section for details."
