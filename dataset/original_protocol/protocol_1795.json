    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPolymerization of the ACA-modified acrylamide gel\nTiming: 3 h (Polymerizing the gel: 1 h, Peeling and washing the gel: 2 h)\nThe stiffness of the myocardium is approximately 10 kPa. In this step, we explain the preparation of polyacrylamide gels that resemble myocardial stiffness.\nNote: The following steps should be performed in a safety cabinet under sterile conditions. In addition, replace gloves before 2handling the gel with your fingers.\nAssemble slide glasses and silicone membranes as spacers as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1384-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Polymerization of the ACA-modified acrylamide gel\n(A and B) Assemble slide glasses and spacers as shown in the illustration (A). Gently pour the polymerizing solution (1 mL) into the gap of slide glasses (B).\nTo later allow conjugation with Matrigel components, mix the ACA into a polyacrylamide gel. Mixed reagents are shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Be careful not to generate air bubbles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1384_12.csv\nGently pour 1 mL polymerizing solution into the gap of the glass slide, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. Be careful not to generate air bubbles.\nCritical: Polymerization starts immediately after the addition of TEMED and APS. Therefore, TEMED and APS should be added separately after preparing the other mixtures. TEMED is flammable, corrosive, and hazardous; wear impermeable gloves and a lab coat, avoid direct contact and inhalation of fumes, and do not work in a poorly ventilated space.",
    "Note: The healthy myocardium has a stiffness of approximately 10 kPa. The stiffness of the gel made with the reagents in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] is about 7.5 kPa, which is equivalent to that of healthy myocardium (Kurotsu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Yip et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The stiffness of the gel can be varied by adjusting the composition of BIS. For details on the hydrogel composition of the other stiffness, please refer to Kurotsu et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nAllow the solution to polymerize completely at room temperature.\nCritical: When making soft gels at a low room temperature, polymerization takes longer. The approximate time required for polymerization is 30 min at 25°C to generate a 7.5 kPa gel.\nAfter polymerization, remove the slide glass. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nPeel off the gel from the glass slide. See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].

Removing assembled slide glasses, related to step 5\nCritical: Since the hydrogel (polyacrylamide gel) is easy to tear, soak it in MES buffer, and gently peel it off from the perimeter.\nNote: For clean operation, change gloves at this step.\nSoak the gel in a 10 mL MES buffer in a 100-mm cell culture dish for 30 min. Change the buffer solution three times.\nSoak the gel in a fresh 10 mL MES buffer and incubate overnight (12–16 h) in a refrigerator at 4°C to hydrate completely.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Removing gel from the slide glass, related to step 6\nPreparation of culture plates with Matrigel-based hydrogels for cardiac reprogramming\nTiming: 2 days (Cutting the gel: 1 h, Activating carboxyl group: 2.5 h, Transferring the gels: variable (typically 20–30 min per 12-well plate), PBS replacement: variable (approximately 40 min incubation plus 10–15 min per 12-well plate)",
    "Since cells do not adhere to polyacrylamide gel, it is necessary to modify the polyacrylamide gel to be coated with an extracellular matrix (ECM), such as Matrigel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). In addition, a strong bond between the ECM and polyacrylamide gel is necessary because ECM detaches from the gel after long-term culture. This step covalently bonds the Matrigel to the modified polyacrylamide gel so that the ECM does not peel off. Plates with Matrigel-based hydrogels can be stored for more than four weeks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1384-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation of 12-well culture plates containing Matrigel-based hydrogels\n(A) Workflow of generating a Matrigel-based hydrogel culture system from (1) to (7). The incubation time is shown for each step.\n(B) Process the outer cylinder of a syringe to make a “gel cutter”. Because hydrogel still swells slightly after Matrigel conjugation, it is better to use a syringe with a diameter slightly smaller than the bottom of the well. See also Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\n(C) ACA (co-polymerized in the hydrogel) reacts with NHS/EDAC to form active ester bonds. If the reaction proceeds successfully, bubbles are generated. These bubbles interfere with further reaction between the hydrogel and NHS/EDAC, which should be removed by shaking the dish every 15 min. See also Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\n(D) Active ester forms on the surface of the hydrogel and reacts with Matrigel components. In this process, the gel repels water and may float. Tap the gel to submerge it in the solution. Continue this process until the gel becomes familiar with the solution and does not float. Some gels may curl, but this can be reversed by performing the same operation. If the gels curl or overlap, separate them as soon as possible. See also Methods videos S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5] and S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6].\nScale bar represents 1 cm.",
    "Note: In this step, Matrigel components covalently bind to a modified polyacrylamide gel in a 12-well plate.\nNote: The following steps should be performed in a safety cabinet under sterile conditions. In addition, replace gloves before handling the gel with your fingers.\nMix the reagents as shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1384_13.csv\nPrepare at the time of use\nCritical: NHS and EDAC are hazardous. Avoid contact and inhalation. Wear impermeable gloves and a lab coat.\nOn a sheet of plastic wrap, cut the hydrogel to the same size as the well of a 12-well plate. Immerse the cut-out round gel in the MES buffer immediately to prevent the hydrogel from drying out. See Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-(1) and (2).\nNote: The hydrophilic gel expands beyond its original size. 8–10 wells of a 12-well plate can be cut out from a 7.5 kPa gel.\nNote: The hydrogels further swell slightly after Matrigel conjugation; therefore, it is best to cut the gel slightly smaller than the bottom of the cell culture plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Because the diameter of the outer cylinder of a syringe matches the diameter of the well of a 12-well plate, the outer cylinder can be processed to be used as a “gel cutter.” The 20 mL and 5 mL syringes are suitable for a 12-well and 24-well plate gel cutters, respectively. Soak gel cutters in 70% ethanol after use, and store.\nNote: For clean operation, change gloves at each subsequent step.\nTransfer the cut-out hydrogels to a 100-mm cell culture dish containing 10 mL of 0.5 M NHS/0.2 M EDAC solution. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-(3).",
    "Incubate samples for 30 min at room temperature to activate the carboxyl group in the polyacrylamide gel. The reaction between the gel and the solution produces gas. Shake the container to remove bubbles on the surface of the hydrogel.

Cutting out the gel, related to step 10\nCritical: Bubbles interfere with the chemical reaction between the hydrogel and the NHS/EDAC solution and should be removed every 15 min.\nTransfer the hydrogel to a 100-mm cell culture dish containing 10 mL of 60% methanol/PBS pre-cooled at 4°C. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-(4).\nIncubate for 2 h in a refrigerator at 4°C.\nNote: After incubation, the gel shrinks a little due to dehydration.\nTransfer the hydrogel to a 100-mm cell culture dish on ice containing 10 mL of 0.05 mg/mL Matrigel/PBS solution. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-(5).\nCritical: This operation should be performed on ice to prevent the hydrogels from adhering to each other due to accelerated Matrigel conjugation.\nCritical: At this time, the gel repels water and floats. Tap the gel to submerge it in the solution. Continue this process until the gel remains submerged in the solution. Some gels may continue to float and roll, but this can be addressed by gently fixing the gels using a finger (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).

Carbon dioxide bubbles generated in NHS/EDAC solution, related to step 12\nNote: Alternatively, the gel can be handled with clean forceps for aseptic manipulation in this step. However, if manipulation with these instruments would damage the gel, it is recommended to change into clean gloves and work with your fingers.",
    "After transferring the gels from the 100-mm culture dish to each well, add 500 μL of 0.05 mg/mL Matrigel/PBS to each well of the 12-well plate on ice. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-(6).\nIncubate for 16–18 h in the refrigerator set at 4°C for Matrigel conjugation.\nReplace one-third of the Matrigel/PBS solution with PBS and incubate for 10 min in the refrigerator set at 4°C. Repeat this process three times. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-(7).\nCompletely replace the Matrigel/PBS solution with PBS and incubate overnight (12–16 h) in the refrigerator set at 4°C.\nNote: Make sure that the hydrogel adheres to the cell culture plate. If the hydrogel floats up, it is difficult to reattach it to the culture plate.\nPause point: This culture plate can be stored in the refrigerator set at 4°C for up to 1 month. We recommend starting the subsequent cardiac reprogramming process after preparing multiple culture plates.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S5.

The following is a summary of this protocol. For more details, please refer to previous studies (Ieda et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Muraoka et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Qian et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "On day 0 for cardiac reprogramming, coat five 100-mm cell culture dishes with 0.1% gelatin/PBS.\nPlate Plat-E cells at a density of 3.6 × 106 cells/dish in Plat-E transfection medium.\nNote: We recommend that Plat-E cells culture should be limited to 30 passages.\nCritical: Do not use the Plat-E maintenance medium.\nIncubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nOn day 1 for cardiac reprogramming, add 300 μL of OptiMEM to five 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, mixed with 27 μL of Fugene6 in each tube, and tap well with fingers. Prepare five tubes in total.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nMix 9 μg of each retroviral DNA into this mixture by finger tapping and incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Add the transfection mixture containing each retroviral DNA and Fugene6 to the culture medium and mix well by shaking the culture dish.\nIncubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nOn day 2 for cardiac reprogramming, replace the medium containing the transfection mix with 10 mL of fresh Plat-E transfection medium.\nIncubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nOn day 3 for cardiac reprogramming, collect each retroviral medium and filter through a 0.45-mm pore filter using a 10 mL sterile disposable syringe.\nMix 4 μL of polybrene with each retroviral medium to a final concentration of 4 μg/mL.\nPrepare a cardiac reprogramming cocktail by mixing equal amounts of the retroviral medium of Gata4, Hand2, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GHMT). The retroviral mixture is now ready for use.\nNote: GFP retrovirus vectors can be used to monitor transduction efficiency. A transduction efficiency of 95%–100% is required for successful reprogramming.\nCulture of MEFs on Matrigel-based hydrogels and retrovirus infection",
    "Timing: 2 h on day 2, 1 h on day 3, 1h on day 4 and 30 min every 2–3 days\nCritical: Be careful not to aspirate the hydrogel when changing the medium. We use a 200 μL or 1,000 μL pipette to slowly change the medium.\nOn day 2 for cardiac reprogramming (the same day as step 27), remove PBS from the Matrigel-based hydrogel plate.\nCritical: Tilt the plate to completely remove PBS between the plate and hydrogel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1384-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
