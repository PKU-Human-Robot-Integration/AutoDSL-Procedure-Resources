    "1.  \tStent Preparing and Implantation\nThe stent-struts (Fort  Wayne Metals, Castlebar, Ireland) were braided and then cut to the desired size  at the Institute for Textile  Technology and Mechanical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University in Germany (Figure 1A).\nBefore implantation,  the stents must be transferred into a 2 cm silicon tube, using forceps, and placed  2 mm at one terminal end, referred front end (Figure 1A).\nThe front end should  be cut obliquely, to ensure a sharp tip for implantation.\nBefore implantation,  the stent should be abundantly watered, to ensure slippage.\n2.  \tStent Implantation\n10-12 weeks old male C57Bl/6  wild type mice, 25-27 g are anesthetized using intraperitoneal injection of 100  mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Proper anesthetization is confirmed prior  to surgery by the lack of reflexes and beard movement. To prevent dryness while  under anesthesia, the mouse eyes are covered by a film of bepanthene cream.\nAfter shaving and  proper disinfection of the ventral neck area, a small median incision of 1 cm is  performed under a stereomicroscope, using scissors. After separating the 2 fatty  bodies with sterile curved forceps, the left common carotid artery can be seen  pulsing along with the trachea.\n1 cm of the left  common carotid artery and the bifurcation should be free prepared. 1 knot using  a 5/0 silk thread will be bound around the left common carotid artery, 2 knots using  7/0 silk threads will be bound around the left external carotid artery, and 1  knot using a 7/0 silk thread will be bound around the internal carotid artery  (Figure 1B).",
    "The blood flow is then  interrupted by binding the knots on the internal carotid artery and the proximal  external carotid artery firmly, as well as by pulling the knot surrounding the common  carotid artery. The vessel should be fixed in a way that the common and  external carotid artery are in a straight line.\nA small incision at  the external carotid artery is performed, near the proximal knot, using a  Vannas scissor. The silicon tube containing the stent is introduced into the  external carotid artery, with the sharp end in front, using a guide-wire. After  the stent reaches the desired position, the silicon tube is pulled back over  the guide-wire and allows the shape-memory expansion of the stent (Figure 1B).\nThe distal knot on the  external carotid artery is bind tightly to close the site of incision and the  knots at the internal and common carotid artery are removed, thereby restoring the  blood flow.\nThe skin incision is  closed using 3-4 Michel suture clips and a Michel forcep. The mouse is placed  under the red light until full recovery. An analgesic treatment is not  necessary.\nThe plaque can be  analyzed after 1-3 weeks. To study the re-endothelialization, an earlier  end-time point is necessary (3-4 days). We observed in our model of stent  implantation that 4 weeks after this surgical intervention, especially by the  use of specific coatings to biofunctionalize the miniaturized stents,  neoangiogenesis occurs in approximately 30% of specimen. This is a hind for remodeling  and regenerative processes, with different mechanisms and representing another  pathological problem. To concentrate on neointima formation, in-stent stenosis  and/or analysis of mechanisms underlying these side-effects after stent  implantation an end-time point of 3 weeks would be beneficial not to mix up  with the regenerative effects induced by the onset of neoangiogenesis.",
    "3.  \tAnalysis of Plaque Formation \nAt the end-time  point, the animals are anesthetized  using intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine.  Proper anesthetization is confirmed prior to surgery by the lack of reflexes  and beard movement.\nThe  animals are killed by intracardial exsanguination. The serum blood is collected  for further analysis.\nAfter  opening the thoracic cavity and PBS washing via intracardial punction, a body-perfusion  with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution is performed for 5 min. The left  carotid artery containing the stent is dissected, directly placed in a 4% PFA solution  and at least 16 hr later embbeded in plastic.\n50 Î¼m  thick sections are performed from plastic-embedded samples using a diamond band  saw.\nTo  measure the plaque size, Giemsa staining is performed.\nTo  analyze the rate of re-endothelialization within the stented area of the vessel,  immunohistochemistry for von Willebrand factor (vWF) is performed."
