    "This protocol was carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Stanford University School of Medicine. The described protocol is scaled for islet isolation from six 250 - 300 g (8 - 9 weeks old) male Sprague Dawley rats, which is sufficient to generate 228 wells of a 384-well plate for islet-cell replication assessment.\n1. Material Preparation\nPrepare coating media prior to initiating islet isolation by collecting the conditioned media of 804G rat bladder carcinoma cells maintained at confluence for 3 days (20 ml of RPMI1640) in a 15 cm tissue culture dish 28. Sterile filter and store (-20 °C) the conditioned media for later use.\nSterilize surgical tools (one 12 cm toothed tissue forceps, one 11.5 cm fine scissors, one 14.5 cm surgical scissors, two 16 cm curved forceps, one 12 cm curved hemostat, one 12 cm scalpel handle) and one 30 mesh tissue sieve prior to initiating islet isolation.\nPrepare pancreatic digestion solution by dissolving a 60%:40% mixture of purified class I:class II collagenases (total collagenase activity of 300,000 - 400,000 units) in 60 ml of 1x Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with calcium and magnesium. Load 10 ml of pancreatic digestion buffer into 10 ml syringes (six) with a 1\" 22 G needle and place on ice.\n\tNote: 10 ml of digestion solution is injected per rat. Scale accordingly.\nPrepare 4.5 ml of anesthetic cocktail in a ventilated hood by mixing 1.3 ml of ketamine (100 mg/ml), 0.2 ml of xylazine (100 mg/ml) and 3 ml of PBS. Prepare the anesthetic cocktail within 1 hr of initiating islet isolation.\nPrepare wash buffer by adding 25 ml of newborn calf serum to 500 ml of HBSS. Place wash buffer on ice for later use.",
    "Prepare 1 bottle of islet medium which is 500 ml of low glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 50 ml fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5,000 units/ml of penicillin and 5,000 µg/ml of streptomycin.\nPrepare islet function medium from functionality/viability solution (500 ml) with 2% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 5 mM glucose, 5,000 units/ml of penicillin and 5,000 µg/ml of streptomycin. Store the islet function media (4 °C) for later use.\nPrepare 40 ml blocking buffer by adding 2.5 ml donkey serum and 0.12 ml triton X-100 to 37.38 ml of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Store blocking buffer (4 °C) for later use.\nObtain the required antibodies prior to initiating the protocol.\n\tNote: PDX-1 (TRITC) and Ki-67 (FITC) co-staining is used for primary β-cell replication screening. For lineage-specific replication analysis, perform immunofluorescence staining for additional cell identity markers (insulin, glucagon, vimentin or somatostatin; TRITC) along with nuclear (DAPI), PDX (Cy5) and Ki-67 (FITC) staining. Alternative replication markers, e.g., PCNA, may also be used.\nPrepare a 228-well treatment plan with each treatment condition performed in quadruplicate. Include positive- (5-Iodotubercidin [1 µM] or dipyridamole [15 µM]) and vehicle-control (DMSO 1:666 dilution) wells.\n2. Perfusion of the Pancreas\nAnesthetize rats by i.p. injection of diluted anesthetic cocktail solution (0.30 ml/100 g body weight). Once the rat is fully anesthetized and unresponsive to noxious stimuli, perform cervical dislocation.\nPlace the euthanized rat in supine position (cranial-caudal orientation) on a stack of paper towel and spray the abdominal area with 70% ethanol.\nOpen the abdominal cavity with a U-incision (base at pubic region) and retract skin in the rostral direction over chest to expose the abdominal cavity.",
    "Carefully grab the duodenum using two pairs of curved forceps, locate the duodenal entry of the common bile duct (sphincter of Oddi) and clamp the duodenal opening at the papilla with a curved hemostat.\nLift the curved hemostat used to clamp the common bile duct papilla and grab the bile duct close to liver using a curved forceps. Use blunt dissection with the curved forceps to isolate and expose the bile duct.\nReposition the rat with the head proximal and the feet distal.\nCannulate the common bile duct (CBD) at or just distal to the junction of the cystic and common hepatic ducts with a pancreatic digestion solution-loaded 10 ml syringe and slowly inject 10 ml of the pancreatic digestion solution. While injecting, support the CBD with a scalpel handle. Reposition the needle if the duct and pancreas fail to inflate.\nRemove the inflated pancreas using the curved forceps and fine scissors to separate it from the descending colon, intestines, stomach and spleen. Place the inflated pancreas on ice in a 50 ml tube containing 5 ml of pancreatic digestion solution.\n\tNote: For maximum islet yield, collect all pancreata within 30 min and place only 1 or 2 pancreata in each 50 ml digestion tube.\n3. Dissociation of the Pancreas\nOnce all pancreata are collected, place the digestion tubes into a 37 °C water bath for 15 min. Gently swirl the tubes every 3 min.\nAfter 15 min, vigorously shake (vertically) the tubes 10 times and add 10 ml of cold wash buffer. Vigorously shake the tubes an additional 5 times and place on ice.\nFill the digestion tubes to 50 ml with cold wash buffer and mix by inverting tubes 5 times.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 97 x g at 4 °C for 1 min and pour off the supernatant. Be careful not to dislodge the pelleted tissue.\nAdd 25 ml wash buffer and re-suspend the tissue by gently vortexing. Repeat steps 3.4 and 3.5 twice more.\nPlace a 30 mesh tissue sieve over a sterile 250 ml beaker and pour the tissue suspension onto the sieve. Rinse the digestion tube with an additional 20 ml of wash buffer and pour onto the mesh. The undigested pancreatic and fat tissues are removed at this step.\nPour the filtered material into two fresh 50 ml tubes and pellet the tissue by spinning at 97 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Decant supernatant and invert tubes to drain excess buffer.\n4. Purification of Islets\nAdd 20 ml of cold polysucrose/sodium diatrizoate solution (1.119 g/ml density) to the pelleted pancreatic tissue. Homogenously re-suspend the contents of each tube by gently pipetting up and down five times.\nGently overlay the polysucrose/sodium diatrizoate solution with 10 ml HBSS. Maintain a sharp liquid interface by slowly adding the HBSS along the tube wall.\nCentrifuge the digested pancreata at 560 x g for 15 min (4 °C) with slow acceleration and no brake.\nCollect the islet layer from the interface using a 10 ml pipette and place islets in fresh 50 ml tubes. Do not pool islets at this stage.\nAdd 40 ml of wash buffer to each 50 ml tube and spin for 1 min at 140 x g at 4 °C.\nPour off the supernatant and re-suspend pooled islets in 50 ml of wash buffer by inverting the tubes several times. Centrifuge the tubes for 1 min at 97 x g at 4 °C to collect islets in a pellet.",
    "Pour off the wash buffer and repeat the wash. Bring islets into the tissue culture hood and aspirate the supernatant.\nRe-suspend each tube of islets in 6 ml of islet medium.\nTransfer the islets from each 50 ml tube into a well of six-well tissue culture dish. Swirl the 6-well dish to collect islets into the middle of the well and observe islet quality and purity under a microscope.\nManually collect islets using a 1 ml pipette and transfer the picked islets into the adjacent well containing 6 ml of islet media. Repeat islet swirling and picking until > 90% purity is achieved.\nTransfer the purified islets to a 10 cm tissue culture dish containing 20 ml of islet medium.\nPlace islets in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) overnight (Figure 1A).\nIn preparation of plating islet cells, coat the wells of a 384-well plate with 40 µl of 804G conditioned media per well. Incubate overnight in a tissue culture incubator.\n5. Dispersion and Plating of Islet Cells\nThe following day, gently detach islets from the 10 cm dish with a cell scraper and transfer the islets into a 50 ml tube.\nPellet the islets by centrifugation for 1 min at 22 x g at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\nWash the islets with 20 ml of warm PBS and decant as above.\nRe-suspend islets in 0.25 % trypsin (150 µl per rat pancreas) and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Pipette islets up and down 10 times using 1 ml pipette after 5 and 10 min of incubation.",
    "After 10 min, evaluate a 20 µl sample of the trypsinized islets under the microscope to ensure complete digestion and to count the islet cells using a hemocytometer. If undigested islets remain, continue incubation for an additional 3 - 5 min and pipette up and down 10 more times. Repeat as necessary.\n\tNote: The typical yield is ~ 125,000 - 150,000 islet-cells per rat.\nRemove 804G conditioned media-coated 384-well plate from the incubator and remove media using a 12-well manifold aspirator.\nSuspend islet cells at a density of 45,000 cells per ml in Islet function medium and plate 70 µl (3,150 cells) per well with a multichannel pipette (Figure 1B).\n\tNote: Because β-cells located in the outer wells tend to migrate towards the perimeter of the plate use rows C to N and columns 4 to 21 to plate 228 wells with the islet-cells isolated from 6 rats.\nPlace the plate in the tissue culture incubator for 48 hr to allow cell adhesion.\n6. Islet-cell Culture Treatment, Fixation and Staining\nPrepare 200 µl of vehicle and compounds (treatment conditions are performed in quadruplicate) at a 2x concentration in Islet function medium. Arrange compounds in a sterile 96-well plate to facilitate multi-well pipetting.\nCarefully remove islet medium with a 12-well manifold aspirator and replace with islet function medium (35 µl/well) using a 12-well pipette. Remove and replace media from one row at a time to limit risk of drying (Figure 1C).\nInitiate treatment by transferring 35 µl/well of the 2x compound solutions. Return plate to the incubator for the 48 hr treatment duration.\nAfter 48 hr of treatment, decant the treatment media by inverting the plate.\nGently wash the islet cells with 50 µl per well of 1x PBS (1 min). Add the PBS using a multi-channel pipette.",
    "Decant the PBS and fix the cells by adding 50 µl per well of cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in 1x PBS. Incubate cells for 15 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cells three times (5 min each) by inverting the plate to remove the PFA and gently adding 60 µl of PBS per well as above.\nPrepare 15 ml antigen retrieval solution by mixing 14.25 ml formamide and 0.75 ml 0.15 M sodium citrate (pH 6). Make the antigen retrieval solution immediately before use.\nRemove PBS from wells by inverting the plate and add 60 µl antigen retrieval solution to each well. Heat the plate in 70 °C water bath for 45 min. Place a heating block on top of the plate during this incubation to prevent warping of the multi-well plate.\n\tNote: The water should be half-way up the plate skirt; the plate should not be submerged.\nRemove the plate from water bath and allow it to cool for 20 min at room temperature. Ensure that the plate is not warped by visual inspection.\nWash the cells with 60 µl per well of 1x PBS three times (5 min each). Add PBS with a multi-channel pipette and decant PBS by inverting the plate.\nUse a multi-channel pipette to add 40 µl per well of blocking buffer and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Remove the blocking buffer by inverting the plate and decanting.\nAdd 40 µl of mouse anti-human Ki-67 (1:200) and goat anti-human PDX-1 (1:100) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer to each well and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nThe next day, decant the anti-body solution and wash the cells with 1x PBS three times (5 min each) as described above. Decant the PBS.",
    "Add 40 µl per well of diluted (1:200) biotinylated donkey anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG in blocking buffer. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\nWash the cells with 1x PBS three times, 5 min each. Add 40 µl of diluted (1:400 in blocking buffer) fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin to each well. Incubate 30 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells with 1x PBS three times, 5 min each. Add 40 µl per well of DAPI (300 nM in blocking buffer) and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nWash cells with 1x PBS two times and leave cells in 40 µl 1x PBS. The plate is now ready to be analyzed.\n7. β-Cell Replication Analysis\nNote: An assay protocol must be established for the high content screening microscope used to measure β-cell replication. In its simplest composition, this protocol is a two-color assay where an identity marker is used to define β-cells (PDX-1+-cells) and a replication marker (Ki-67) is used to define cell division events.\nIdentify objects (β-cells) based upon the average fluorescence intensity of PDX-1 staining (549 nm filter) within an approximate circle (length:width < 1.6) within the expected pixel area of a β-cell nucleus (Figure 2A).\nNext, establish settings to identify replication events (Ki-67-positivity) based upon the average fluorescence intensity (485 nm filter) within the PDX-1+ area (Figure 2B).\n\tNote: Exposure times must be fixed to allow pixel intensity comparisons across images. Assay protocol parameters are adjusted such that machine calls consistently exclude nonspecific staining, debris and cell aggregates that could adversely affect data quality.\nAnalyze a minimum of 500 β-cells per well to maximize accuracy and limit variability.",
    "Note: The basal β-cell replication index in rat islet cultures is expected to be 0.5 - 3%. Typically, 40 images per well is more than sufficient to identify 500 β-cells.\nPrior to analyzing the entire plate, analyze selected negative- (DMSO-treated) and positive-control (5-iodotubercidin [1 µM] or dipyridamole [15 µM]) -treated wells to assess the validity of the assay protocol. When the assay is established correctly, positive control compounds induce at least a two-fold increase in the percentage of replicating β-cells.\nRead the entire plate once the assay protocol is validated.\nSubscription Required.
