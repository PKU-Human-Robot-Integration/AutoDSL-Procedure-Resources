    "The following method was devised to minimize sample manipulation and maximize recovery for all white blood cell populations while providing low fluorescence background and preserving the spectral characteristics of tandem fluorochromes. The addition of a low concentration of fixative to the lysing solution allows for the simultaneous lysing and fixing of the sample and preservation of the light scatter properties of the sample, and provides improved separation of compromised from viable cells. Addition of a subsequent wash step reduces background fluorescence due to unbound fluorochrome and provides more controlled timing of fixation, which enhances the stability of certain tandem fluorochromes. The procedure outlined is generic and can be used for any surface immunophenotyping assay.",
    "The analysis of data produced by this assay is complex and requires an experienced interpreter familiar with normal immunophenotypic patterns of hematopoietic maturation as well as common immunophenotypic abnormalities seen in AML. A complete discussion of both topics is beyond the scope of this article, and the reader is referred to published literature (Cherian & Wood, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0001]; Cherian, Wood, & Borowitz, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0002]; Wood, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0005], 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0008]). However, there are a few common analytical tasks that can be performed on any sample to provide an improved starting point for interpretation (Wood, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0006]). Assessment of the quality of the acquisition and preparation of the sample are important initial tasks.\nAcquisition stability\nThe data from each tube should be displayed versus time or event number to confirm stability of the acquisition. A parameter should be chosen that is sensitive to alterations in fluidic stability, typically a parameter that has a signal of moderate to high intensity and that is on a laser different from that used to trigger data acquisition, e.g., not the 488-nm blue laser. In this assay CD45 APC-H7 is a good choice; see Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9cfb2b1c-aa02-481a-bc4f-6690f57abbd4/cpcy73-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nAcquisition stability. Stable sample acquisition will show consistent parameter intensities for each population over time, as pictured for CD45 APC-H7 versus event number. Fluidic instability or sample exhaustion during acquisition will show intensity changes that can be excluded by appropriate gating.\nDoublet discrimination\nDoublet discrimination should then be performed to exclude coincident events or aggregates of cells and ensure as much as possible that events interpreted are individual cells or singlets. This is typically achieved by plotting forward scatter in a two-parameter dot plot as a combination of area, height, and/or width, followed by gating of the singlet population; see Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a31406c-9178-485c-93f6-31487784b2ad/cpcy73-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Doublet discrimination. Single cells have a defined relationship between area, height, and width, while cell aggregates or doublets deviate from this relationship. Gating on single cells or singlets, pictured using area versus height, allows for minimization of artifactual doublets that may result in composite immunophenotypes and can confuse residual disease assessment.\nViability",
    "Viability and overall quality of the sample are assessed by examining the light scatter properties of the sample, generally by plotting forward scatter (FS) versus side scatter (SS); see Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0003]. Apoptotic cells will show an initial loss of FS and gain of SS, followed by loss of both FS and SS as the cells further degenerate. The ability to see these changes is highly dependent on the way in which the sample is processed; the method of choice must be optimized to provide consistent light-scatter properties that reflect cell viability. Of note, nucleated erythroid cells show a loss of FS using this method due to the lysing reagent, but are retained, and the FS instrument settings (threshold and FS PMT voltage) must be properly set to ensure inclusion of this population during acquisition. A viability gate is used to reduce background nonspecific antibody binding to compromised cells and stromal material, the intention being to include viable white cells without regard to nucleated erythroid cells. While the viability gate improves the quality and interpretability of the data, it assumes proportional loss of white cells with reduced cell viability, which is generally but not always correct. Relaxation of the gate to include lower-FS events is possible and perhaps desirable under some circumstances, provided that data quality is not significantly impaired. In principle, a viability dye that emits at a long wavelength following excitation from the violet laser could be incorporated, provided that the instrument configuration is suitable, but this would require independent validation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c41a2978-0fbb-4992-8e17-fbe83b7b219b/cpcy73-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Viability gating. Light scatter properties alone can be used to assess sample quality and exclude non-viable cells and debris, pictured here using a forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) gate, the latter displayed on a log scale so populations have more similar distribution regardless of SSC intensity.\nProgenitor population identification\nThe initial identification of progenitors is readily accomplished using CD45 and SS gating in the progenitor or “blast” area; see Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0004]. Mature lymphocytes are always present in marrow and blood samples, and serve as a reference point for identification of progenitors, having uniform bright CD45 and low SS. The progenitor gate should include all events having CD45 less intense than the mature lymphocyte population. Due to the large number of maturing neutrophilic progenitors usually present, the progenitor gate should exclude as much as possible the high-SS maturing myeloid populations. However, some samples may show variable hypogranularity of the maturing myeloid cells, recognized by a level of SS similar to that of monocytes and approaching that of lymphocytes, in which case it is more important to include all CD34+ progenitors in the progenitor gate at the expense of contamination by maturing myeloid cells. This recognition is facilitated by gating and coloring the CD34+ progenitors so they can be directly visualized on CD45 versus SS plots. CD45 very low to negative events largely consist of nucleated erythroid cells, plasma cells, aggregated platelets, and debris, and thus can be safely excluded, as AML only very rarely shows loss of CD45 expression to that degree.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5d576703-73db-4406-87a4-a84036a98065/cpcy73-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "Progenitor gating. Hematopoietic progenitors may be identified and gated using CD45 and side scatter (SSC) as the populations having CD45 slightly lower than that of mature lymphocytes (blue) and SSC lower than maturing neutrophils (green). Normal CD34+ progenitors (red) and B cell progenitors (cyan) are included in the progenitor gate, and mature lymphocytes (blue), monocytes (magenta), and maturing neutrophils (green) are excluded.\nLeukemic population identification\nThe identification of residual leukemia requires a detailed knowledge of normal maturational patterns of antigen expression that is beyond the scope of this procedure, and also requires an experienced interpreter. The general strategy is to identify a subset of events that is different from any normal stage of hematopoietic maturation, with a distribution of events distinct from artifact and discrete enough to allow sequential gating of the population in multidimensional space in a manner that excludes artifactual events and normal hematopoiesis and includes all leukemic events. See Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a9b9eb45-aa8b-4f89-8815-d3c24276d9eb/cpcy73-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nSequential gating. Progenitors (blasts) are gated using CD45 versus SSC, and residual leukemia identified using CD34 versus CD117 (top left). The gated leukemic population (MRD1) is then further gated (MRD2) to exclude early promyelocytes having increased CD13 (top right), then B cells (CD19+) and erythroid cells (CD71bright) are excluded (MRD3; bottom left), and finally outliers for CD45 and CD33 are excluded, resulting in a relatively homogeneous population that includes all leukemic cells and excludes normal cells to the extent possible with this reagent combination.",
    "Recognition of normal populations can be facilitated by coloring the progenitors (CD34+ and/or CD117+) and each of the major cell lineages a different color. The interpreter should review all combinations of dot plots that are likely to be informative for this purpose, which need not be all possible dot plots but will generally be a major subset of these. The subset of dot plots that we have found to be most informative with this reagent panel is illustrated in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0006]. Of particular importance is evaluation of the hematopoietic stem cell population (CD34++/CD38low), which is readily performed by displaying CD34+ events in a series of two-parameter dot plots containing CD38 versus each of the other parameters in the reagent combinations. It is also important to review the full range of maturing monocyte and myeloid populations in order to recognize abnormal immature populations of these lineages—as may be seen in AML having monocytic or myeloid differentiation—as well as to recognize potential aberrant maturational changes in these lineages that might suggest a preexisting myeloid stem cell disorder.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7c62b681-a3c7-4dc8-85c7-fdb732a203dd/cpcy73-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nDot plots to review. Progenitors gated using CD45 versus SSC are displayed for reagent combinations M1 and M2 as an example of the number of dot plots that are advisable to review when making an assessment for MRD. Note that the gated CD34+ progenitors are specifically displayed (bottom right) as CD38 versus each of the other parameters to assess for immunophenotypic abnormalities on the hematopoietic stem cells. Populations are colored as follows: CD34+ progenitors (red), monocytes (magenta), myeloid (green), plasma cells (yellow), basophils (purple), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cyan), MRD (blue).\nImmunophenotypic abnormalities in AML can be grouped into classes having recurring features that often reflect the predominant maturational stage of the leukemia.",
    "Abnormalities in subsets of leukemic cells having immunophenotypes similar to those of normal hematopoietic stem cells are common in AML and may be associated with properties such as self-renewal and resistance to chemotherapy, and thus are important to evaluate (van Rhenen et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0004]; Zeijlemaker et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0009]). It is important to keep in mind that while this component of the leukemia may be relatively easy to recognize, there may be more mature components (CD34+ or CD117+) derived from these more primitive cells that are more challenging or perhaps impossible to define with a particular reagent combination. A judgment must then be made about the remaining CD34+ progenitors as to whether they are of sufficient concern, by also being potentially aberrant, to be included in the MRD enumeration, or whether only the stem cells that can be cleanly gated as aberrant should enumerated. An example of MRD having an immunophenotype similar to hematopoietic stem cells is provided in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0007].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d41190f-0810-4798-8e2c-133b0c5d29b0/cpcy73-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nAML MRD, hematopoietic stem cell abnormalities. Progenitors gated using CD45 versus SSC identify an expanded hematopoietic stem cell population (blue) that differs from normal CD34+ progenitors (red) by having abnormal expression of CD38 (decreased), CD34 (slightly decreased), CD123 (increased), CD56 (increased), and CD7 (variably increased). Note the variability in expression of some antigens that may be seen, CD7 in this example.",
    "A subset of AML expresses CD34 without a well-defined hematopoietic stem cell−like subpopulation. In these cases, knowledge of normal patterns of early antigen expression with commitment to each of the major lineages (B cell, monocytic, neutrophilic, erythroid, basophilic, plasmacytoid dendritic cell) is critical for MRD recognition. A relatively clear example of this principle is seen in t(8;21) AML due to a characteristic immunophenotype that includes varied aberrant expression of increased CD34, B cell antigens such as CD19, and CD56 (Khoury et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0003]). An example of MRD having an immunophenotype similar to CD34+ myeloid committed progenitors is provided in Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0008].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/19d74c3a-8422-4067-be21-f62f2fed2391/cpcy73-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nAML MRD, t(8;21). Progenitors gated using CD45 versus SSC identify an abnormal population of CD34+ progenitors (orange) that differs from normal CD34+ progenitors (red) by having abnormal CD34 (increased), CD19 (bright), CD15 (variable with uniform CD34 intensity), and CD56 (subset). Note the absence of a clear hematopoietic stem cell subpopulation.\nRoughly one-third of normal-karyotype AML contain a mutation in the NPM1 gene, and these cases have a relatively distinctive immunophenotype that is important to recognize for MRD detection (Zhou et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-bib-0010]). Characteristic of this type of AML is a more mature immunophenotype with little to no expression of CD34, decreased to absent HLA-DR, and increased CD33, often at a level higher that monocytes, monocytes being the normal population with the highest level of CD33 expression and thus a useful reference point. As a result, a dot plot of CD33 versus HLA-DR gated on progenitors by CD45 versus SS is a useful starting point for evaluation. An example of NPM1+ AML MRD is provided in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0009]. A similar gating strategy can be used for acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f03268c1-3efe-4034-bac5-45233de7bc75/cpcy73-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9",
    "AML MRD, NPM1-mutated. Progenitors gated using CD45 versus SSC identify an abnormal population of progenitors (blue) that differs from normal CD34+ progenitors (red) and monocytes (magenta) by having abnormal HLA-DR (variably decreased), CD33 (brighter than monocytes), CD13 (increased), CD34 (mostly negative), CD38 (slightly decreased), and CD71 (increased). Note the absence of a clear hematopoietic stem cell subpopulation.\nAML with monocytic differentiation can be a particularly difficult subset of AML on which to perform MRD detection using this and other reagent panels. Often the key is to identify a population of immature monocytes (usually CD14 low to negative) having immunophenotypic abnormalities in the expression of CD4, CD14, CD15, CD64, and/or HLA-DR with aberrant CD56 expression at a moderate to high level seen in a significant subset of cases. Relying on expression of high CD64 or HLA-DR to identify monocytes is risky, as these antigens are fairly commonly decreased in this subtype of AML. Rather, a comprehensive evaluation of antigen expression with cross-correlation between reagent combinations is required for confident identification. An example of monocytic AML MRD is provided in Figure 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcy.73#cpcy73-fig-0010].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e1ffd94-e21e-417c-96e5-c8937ee50615/cpcy73-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10",
    "AML MRD, monocytic. Progenitors and monocytes gated using CD45 versus SSC identify an abnormal population of immature monocytes (orange) that differs from normal CD34+ progenitors (red), monocytes (magenta), maturing neutrophils (green), and B cells (cyan) by having abnormal CD34 (absent) with CD117, HLA-DR (variably decreased), CD33 (dimmer than monocytes, but brighter than neutrophils), CD15 (increased), CD13 (absent), CD64 (more variable than normal), CD14 (absent), and CD56 (increased). Note that the absence of CD14 and presence of bright CD64 is normal for immature monocytes, but HLA-DR should also be uniformly and brightly positive on immature monocytes but instead shows an aberrant, dramatic decrease in expression. Normal monocytic maturation with CD14 and HLA-DR is well demonstrated in this sample (bottom center).\nEnumeration\nRelatively commonly, the leukemic population is best recognized in one of the three reagent combinations acquired. Every effort should be made to identify a corresponding population in each of the two other reagent combinations, relying on the common reagents to extrapolate between tubes. Finding a similar population at a similar frequency in more than one combination provides assurance that the finding is real and less likely to be due to a technical artifact. Rarely, significant differences in enumeration may be seen between combinations, in which case the interpreter must make a judgement as to which combination is likely most informative and most complete for identifying the leukemic population. That combination should be used for enumeration, and is not always the one with the highest enumeration, due to specificity issues with a particular combination. The denominator for enumeration historically is total CD45+ events, although total nucleated cells may ultimately be preferable, but would require use of a nucleic acid−binding dye and CD45 in a fourth reagent combination."
