    "Animal studies are carried out following procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Utah.\n1. Fixing Larvae\nAt 3–7 days post fertilization (dpf), euthanize larvae with tricaine methanesulfonate (0.03%) and collect up to 15 larvae in a 2 mL tube using a glass pipette and pipette pump.\nWash larvae twice with 1 mL of cold (4 °C) 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice. For each wash, remove as much liquid as possible from the tube with a glass pipette and pipette pump, and then add 1 mL of cold PBS to tube.\nRemove as much PBS as possible using a glass pipette and pipette pump, and add 1 mL of cold (4 °C) 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is an irritant and suspected carcinogen. Gloves should be worn when handling PFA, and concentrated solutions should be handled in a chemical fume hood.\nIncubate at 4 °C at least overnight (but up to several months) with gentle rocking.\n2. Dissecting Tissues Surrounding Liver\nRemove larvae from PFA by rinsing 3x with 1 mL of cold (4 °C) PBS and rocking for 5 min in between rinses.\n\tNOTE: It is okay to keep the rinsed larvae in PBS for a day or two at 4 °C.\nPipette several larvae in PBS into one well of a 9-well round-bottom glass dish.\nRemove skin surrounding liver.\n\t\nUse fine forceps to hold larva on its back (belly up), gripping on either side of the head as gently as possible. Then use very fine forceps in your other hand to grab the skin just overlying the heart.",
    "Pull skin down diagonally towards the tail of the fish and the bottom of the dish on the left or right side of the fish. Repeat for other side (right or left side).\nContinue grabbing flaps of skin and pulling down/back until all of the skin and melanophores overlying or near the liver have been removed.\nRemove yolk, if present.\n\t\nFor 5–6 dpf larvae, lift yolk off in one piece by holding the fish with fine forceps on its back and using the very fine forceps to prod the yolk gently.\nFor 3–4 dpf larvae, scrape the yolk off in pieces. Hold the fish with fine forceps on its back and use the very fine forceps to stroke the yolk, starting from the ventral side.\nPlace dissected larvae into fresh cold PBS using a glass pipette and pipette pump.\n3. Imaging\nTo mount larvae, pour a few mL of 3% methyl cellulose onto the lid of a clean plastic Petri dish.\nUse a glass pipette and pipette pump to add larvae to the methyl cellulose, adding as little PBS with the larvae as possible.\nUnder a dissecting microscope at low magnification, use fine forceps to orient the fish so they are laying on their right side, facing left.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the fish are oriented perfectly on their side or the liver measurements may not be accurate.\nTake a picture of each fish.\n\t\nConfirm that the fish to be photographed is aligned perfectly, with one eye directly on top of the other eye. If necessary, use fine forceps to tap lightly on head or tail of fish to adjust orientation. If fish's tail is bent, remove the tail by pinching it forcefully with forceps to remove it so the fish lays flat.",
    "Zoom in to high magnification and focus on the liver, making sure that the liver's outline is clearly visible.\nSnap a picture and save the file.\nRepeat for all fish, making sure the magnification is the same for each picture.\nTake a picture of a micrometer using the same magnification (see Figure 2H).\n4. Image Analysis\nMeasure the area of each fish's liver using image processing software.\n\t\nBlind all liver pictures to avoid potential investigator bias and promote scientific rigor15. This step can be done manually by another lab member or using a computer program (Supplementary Material). Rename files randomly and create a \"randomization file\" containing a list of the original file names and corresponding blinded file names.\nOpen randomized files in order, starting with file 1.\nChoose the freehand selections tool and outline each liver.\nPress Ctrl-M to measure the area of each liver.\nFor any livers that cannot be accurately measured, insert a placeholder measurement (very small or very large, so it can be easily excluded later on).\nSave the measurements in a text file (\"measurements file\").\nUn-blind and analyze data\n\t\nOpen \"measurements file\" and \"randomization file\" in a spreadsheet program.\nInsert a new column in the \"measurements file\" and add the original file names for the blinded files, using the \"randomization file\". Save this file as \"unblinded measurements file\".\nSort data by original file name.\nBe sure to exclude any liver measurements for which pictures were inadequate (see Figure 2A–G).\nIf necessary, convert measurement values into desired scale (mm2, for example).\n\t\t\nOpen the scale bar in the image processing software.\nUse the straight line tool to measure 1 mm on the scale bar. The image processing software will measure in the same units as the livers (pixels), giving a conversion factor.",
    "Use the conversion factor to convert measurements in the \"unblinded measurements file\".\nUsing the spreadsheet program or pasting data into a scientific graphing and statistics software, determine mean and standard deviation and calculate p value(s).\nSubscription Required.
