    "NOTE: Animal use statement: All procedures in this study were conducted with approval and following the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Eight week-old C57BL/6J male mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and allowed to acclimate for one week prior to use. Up until surgery, animals were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility and provided autoclaved chow and filtered water ad libdium. Each mouse cage was supplied with a dedicated air and water, and rooms were maintained on a 12 hr day-night cycle. Following recovery from surgery, mice were maintained in cages with filtered tops, provided autoclaved chow ad libidum, and provided filtered water from a water bottle.\n1. Preparation of Instruments\nMake 6 skin retractors using paper clips and pins. Twist straightened paper clips on the shanks of paper pins, leave a 5 cm straight steel wire on one end and make a single 0.5 cm “U” shaped hook at the end of the wire.\nMake some 15 x 15 cm square surgical drapes using plastic wrap. Prepare one dressing per mouse. Put a paper tower in between each wrap.\nSterilize all surgical tools along with a stack of 12 x 12 inch cork tiles, gauze, and cotton-tipped swabs.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nInduce anesthesia with 2% isoflurane. Weigh animal.\nIn a dedicated surgical preparation area shave left thorax and neck area with electrical shaver.\nApply a drop of the artificial tear ointment to the mouse’s eyes.\nDecontaminate neck and left thorax with chlorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol. Repeat twice more.\n3. Mouse Oro-tracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation\nHave a non-sterile surgical technician place the mouse supine in the pre-warmed surgical area.\nConfirm depth of anesthesia by documenting lack of a response to paw pinch.",
    "After washing hands and donning surgical attire, mask, and hat, don sterile surgical gloves.\nAfter draping and using aseptic technique, make a 1 cm vertical incision over the anterior mid-neck to expose the larynx. Lightly retract the strap muscles with curved, serrated 10 cm forceps and expose the larynx and trachea by spreading the strap muscles with the tip of a straight scissors.\nOrally insert a 22 G blunt-tip angiocatheter into the mid-trachea (Figure 1A) and visually confirm placement (Figure 1B). Maintain anesthesia and ventilate using 1-3% isoflurane through rodent ventilator (225 µl per stroke; 200 stokes per min). Employ a pressure limit of 15 cm H2O.\n4. Mouse Pneumonectomy\nLay the mouse in the right lateral decubitus position with the mouse’s back facing the operator (left side up). Use a self-sealing plastic wrap as a sterile drape. Cutting through the drape, use blunt tipped curved scissors to make a 2 cm long cut parallel to the ribs at the 4th and 5th intercostal space. Insert the blunt tip curved scissors and dissect the skin away from the underlying ribs and intercostal muscles.\nRetract the skin with four retractors to expose a square 1.5 x 1.5 cm surgical window (Figure 2A). Secure the retractors to the cork board.\nDissect down to ribs using curved forceps, and use one tip of the curved forceps to enter the thoracic cavity.\nUsing the blunt tip micro-scissors, use the lower blade to enter the thoracic cavity. Make a 0.5 cm incision between the ribs and repeat in the opposite direction.\nUsing the two remaining retractors, open the thorax in the anterior-posterior axis and the secure the retractors to the cork board (Figure 2B).",
    "Using curved blunt-tipped forceps in the left hand, grasp the left lung and displace the upper portion of the left lung laterally and inferiorly through the thoracotomy until the left pulmonary artery and bronchus are exposed (Figure 3A,B).\nHolding the loaded titanium vascular microclip applicator in the right hand with the body of the applicator in the palm and curved tip pointing away from the palm (Figure 3C), slide the applicator tip into the thorax along the curvature of the posterior aspect of the left lung and clip the left bronchus and pulmonary artery (Figure 3D).\nRemove the applicator but keep the left lung retracted. Grasp the blunt tip micro-scissors with the right hand and cut the bronchus and pulmonary artery distal to the clip and remove left lung (Figure 3E).\nRemove the rib retractors.\nUse the curved blunt forceps to pinch up 1 cm of skin inferior to the incision but above the level of the diaphragm and insert a 24 G angiocatheter through the skin and into the left thoracic cavity (Figure 4A,B).\nUse 5-0 prolene suture to place two interrupted sutures around the 4th and 5th ribs to close the thoracic cavity.\nRemove the skin retractors. Use two sets of forceps to approximate the skin along the length of the incision and glue the skin closed.\nConnect a 3 ml luer-lock syringe to the angiocatheter and remove residual air by applying gentle suction and withdrawing the angiocatheter.\nGlue the neck incision closed using two sets of forceps as before.\n5. Mouse Sham Pneumonectomy\nExpose the left lung as noted in “Mouse Pneumonectomy” protocol. Lift the rib cage with curved blunt forceps to allow air into the left chest cavity (Figure 5A,B).",
    "Place a 24 G angiocatheter into the left thoracic cavity as above being careful not to injure the left lung.\nUsing 5-0 prolene suture and being careful not to puncture the lung (Figure 5C), place two lengths of suture material into the 3rd/4th and 5th/6th rib interspaces (Figure 5D). Place both lengths of suture material before tying to lessen the risks of left lung herniation. Tie the suture material to make two interrupted stitches (Figure 5E).\nGlue the skin over the thoracic incision, remove residual air with the angiocatheter, and glue the neck incision as above.\n6. Resuscitation, Analgesia, and Recovery\nTurn off the isoflurane, and administer 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine and 0.5 ml of normal saline subcutaneously.\nWhen spontaneous respirations resume, remove the endotracheal tube.\nObserve mouse until it is again ambulatory. Walking typically resumes several minutes after removal of the endotracheal tube.\nPlace the mouse in a 27 °C incubator (humidified, 25% oxygen) to recover O/N.\n\tNOTE: We place several pellets of chow wetted with water on the cage floor for the first 24 hr after surgery.\nAdminister 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine by intraperitoneal injection twice daily for three days after surgery. Take care not to open the surgical site when handling animals.\n7. Mouse Monitoring\nWeigh mice at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after surgery.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
