    "Collection of primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissueA glioblastoma multiforme sample was obtained from a patient with glioblastoma who underwent surgical treatment.This study was approved by the Ethical Commission of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Before operation, a signed written consent was given by the patient. After coordination with the neurosurgery team, the neurosurgeon placed the resected glioblastoma sample in a 15 ml Falcon tube containing 5 ml cold HBSS with 10% antibiotics (antibiotic-antimycotic).The glioblastoma sample was delivered to the lab on dry ice.Dissociation of GBM sample into single primary astrocytesUnder biology’s hood, remove excess of the HBSS in the Falcon tube containing glioblastoma tissue. Wash the tissue 3 times with 5 ml cold PBS to remove the blood. Place the glioblastoma tissue in a Petri dish filled with 1 ml cold PBS. Shred and mince the tissue with a scalpel blade for 5 min until the sample is converted to a milky suspension. Mincing can help to speed up the trypsinization process through increasing the efficacy of tissue dissociation. Add 3 ml of warm (37 °C) 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to minced tissue. Then, transfer the suspension with trypsin into a new 15 ml Falcon tube.Incubate the produced suspension for 10 min at a 37 °C water bath for digestion of the minced tissue. Add 3 ml of DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic to inhibit the activity of trypsin.Pipette the suspension 10 times with a 5 ml pipette and centrifuge at 180 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Remove the upper liquid and resuspend the resulting pellet slowly into 5 ml DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic by pipetting 10 times with a 5 ml pipette.",
    "Filter the cell suspension through a 40 micron cell strainer into a 50 ml tube to remove un-dissociated pieces and debris.Centrifuge the filtered suspension at 180 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Resuspend the pelleted cells into 1 ml DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414005956_3576.jpgFigure 1. Procedure to isolate primary astrocyte for culture from human glioblastoma sample. A. A human glioblastoma sample after surgery; B. Glioblastoma sample was washed using cold PBS; C. Glioblastoma sample was transferred to Petri dish; D. Glioblastoma sample was shred and minced with scalpel blade; E. After enzymatic digestion, cell suspension was plated in a T25 flask.Cell counting and platingAdd 10 μl of the cell suspension to a 1 ml tube containing 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue in PBS. Transfer 10 μl of the cell-trypan blue mixture to a hemocytometer chamber. Count the number of the cells in each individual square (total, 4 squares) under an inverted microscope. Determine the average number of the cells per square and calculate the total cell number by multiplying the cell quantity per square by 2 x 104. Seed 1 x 105 cells in 5 ml DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic into T25 flasks. Place the flasks into an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.Astrocytes usually attach to the bottom of flask after the first 24 h. Astrocytes neurites extend gradually after 3-4 days. Astrocytes start to grow and proliferate after the complete extension of their neurites at day 7 of culture. Replace half of the cell medium with fresh medium every 2 days. FBS concentration is gradually increased after each change of the culture medium, from 2% to 10% in 2 weeks (Table 1).",
    "10% FBS amount in culture medium is preserved in the following primary astrocyte culture. Table 1. FBS concentration in culture medium at different days after seedingtable:",

    "Gradual increase of FBS amount might avoid fibroblast contamination of the cell culture (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414010352_9505.jpgFigure 2. Phase contrast images of primary astrocytes of glioblastoma multiforme in the different days of cell culture. A. 2 days after cell culture; B. 4 days after cell culture; C. 9 days after cell culture; D. 14 days after cell culture. Scale bars = 100 µm.Sub-culture of primary astrocytes of GBMCheck the level of cell confluency using an inverted microscope. Subculture the cells when they reach 80% of confluence 3 weeks after seeding.Remove the medium from each T25 flask under a biological hood with a 5 ml sterile pipette.Wash the cells with 3 ml of warm (37 °C) PBS and then remove PBS. Detach the cells with 1 ml of warm (37 °C) 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 1 min in an incubator.Inhibit trypsin-EDTA reaction by adding 4 ml of DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic into each T25 flask and then transfer the cell suspension from each flask to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge the cell suspensions at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the medium from each tube with a 5 ml sterile pipette.Resuspend the pellet in each tube with 1 ml of fresh medium containing DMEM/F12, 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic.After re-suspend and counting, plate the cells in 24-well dishes (at a density of 5 x 103 cells per well) for immunocytochemistry analysis and also T25 flasks for sub-culture.S100-beta stainingSeed 5 x 103 cells into each well of a 24-well culture dish.Wash each well three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after 24 h at room temperature.Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Permeate cell membranes with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min.",
    "Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Block cells with 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h.Dilute the primary antibody of rabbit anti-S100-beta 1:100 with PBS containing 1% BSA.Incubate cells with primary antibody of rabbit anti-S100-beta or primary antibody of rabbit anti-fibronectin overnight at 4 °C.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Dilute the secondary antibody of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 1:500 with PBS containing 1% BSA.Incubate cells with secondary antibody of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit for 2 h at room temperature in the dark.Wash cells three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.Image cells by an inverted fluorescence microscopy (Figures 3 and 4).Note: Only the secondary antibody was added as a negative control.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414011017_7177.jpgFigure 3.
