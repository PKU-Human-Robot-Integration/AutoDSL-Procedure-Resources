    "All methods involving live animals were performed in accordance with the animal care and use guidelines of Southeast University, China.\n1. Preparation of PEI-SPIONs\nPreparation of oleic acid-modified SPIONs\nDissolve FeCl3•6H2O and FeSO4•7H2O in water under the protection of N2.\n\t\t\nAdd 28 g of FeCl3•6H2O and 20 g of FeSO4•7H2O into 80 mL of deionized water in a beaker. Introduce N2 into the water through a glass conduit and stir until the solid matter has dissolved.\nHeat the reaction mixture to 72 °C at a stirring rate of 800 rpm, followed by addition of 40 mL of ammonia water (28%). Stir for 5 min.\nAdd 9 mL of oleic acid dropwise into the above-mentioned solution and stir it at 72 °C for 3 h.\nCool the resulting solution to room temperature (RT). Precipitate the solution via magnetic separation.\nWash the precipitate containing SPIONs 3x with absolute ethyl alcohol and, then, disperse the precipitate in 100 mL of N-hexane.\nPreparation of dimercaptosuccinic acid-modified SPIONs\nAdd 800 mg of oleic acid (OA)-modified SPIONs dispersed in 200 mL of N-hexane, and 400 mg of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) dispersed in 200 mL of acetone, into a three-neck flask in a water bath at 60 °C.\n\t\tNote: To determine the concentration of OA-modified SPION obtained from the previous step, take a small volume (e.g. 1 mL) of the SPION dispersion, volatilize the N-hexane and weigh the resulting powder.\nAdd 200 µL of triethylamine dropwise into the above-mentioned solution with stirring at 1,000 rpm and refluxing.\nAfter 5 h of stirring and refluxing, obtain a black precipitate by magnetic separation.\nDisperse the hydrophilic SPIONs in deionized water homogeneously by adjusting the pH of the solution using tetramethylammonium hydroxide.\nPreparation of PEI-SPIONs",
    "Add DMSA-modified SPION colloidal solution dropwise into PEI solution (10 kDa) in a 500-mL three-neck flask under mechanical stirring at 1,000 rpm for 2 h (WFe:WPEI = 1:3).\n\t\tNote: The charge and size of PEI-SPIONs vary depending on the ratio of WFe to WPEI. The WFe:WPEI ratio of 1:3 can be a good starting point for synthesizing PEI-SPIONs suitable for siRNA delivery.\nAdd the resultant solution into an ultrafiltration tube having a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kDa and a content of 15 mL; then, centrifuge at 5,400 x g for 10 min until the remaining solution is 1 mL. Add deionized water to the solution to make the volume 15 mL again and repeat the above process 10x to obtain the final product. Then, filter the solution through a 0.22-μm filter and store the final product at 4 °C.\nDetermine the Fe concentration of PEI-SPIONs by the colorimetric method using phenanthroline17. Dilute PEI-SPIONs with deionized sterile water to a concentration of 1 mg Fe/mL and store it at 4 °C.\nDilute 10 μL of the PEI-SPION solution (1 mg Fe/mL) to 1 mL with deionized water; then, test its hydrodynamic size and zeta potential by a dynamic light-scattering device.\n\t\tNote: Prepare PEI-SPIONs in the range of about 30 - 50 nm. In this size range, the effect of the NP size on siRNA binding and cellular uptake does not appear to be significant. PEI-SPIONs bearing an average zeta potential over +37 mV can be toxic in the dose range for transfection, and a cytotoxicity assay should be performed to ensure safety. The surface charge and hydrodynamic size of the nanoparticles can be controlled within a desired range by adjusting the PEI content.\n2. Preparation and Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of PEI-SPION/siRNA NPs",
    "Dilute siRNA with RNase-free water to yield a final concentration of 20 μM (0.26 μg/μL).\nPrepare five RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes labeled 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8. The labels represent different Fe:siRNA weight ratios. Pipet 3 μL of siRNA solution to all tubes (~0.8 μg of siRNA/tube).\nAdd 0, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 μg of Fe in the form of PEI-SPIONs to the tubes labeled 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively. Keep the total sample volume of each tube less than 20 μL. Mix by gently pipetting up and down.\nIncubate the mixtures at RT for 30 min to allow PEI-SPION/siRNA complex formation. During this period, make a 3% agarose gel with high-purity agarose.\n\tNote: Additional PEI-SPION/siRNA complexes with other Fe:siRNA ratios (e.g., 5 or 6) can be prepared and tested.\nAdd 1 μL of 6x DNA-loading buffer per 5-μL sample and mix cautiously. Load all samples and run electrophoresis at 5 V/cm until the bromophenol blue migrates as far as two-thirds of the length of the gel. Stain the gel with ethidium bromide (EB) for 15 - 20 min.\n\tNote: Freshly prepared electrophoresis buffer and EB solution should be used.\nVisualize siRNA bands under a UV imaging system. Check the Fe:siRNA ratios at which siRNA forms complexes with PEI-SPIONs and, as a result, the bands representing free siRNA are retarded or not detectable.\n3. Transfection of RAW264.7 Macrophages In Vitro\nCulture mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells in a 10-cm dish using DMEM complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) per 100 U/mL penicillin per 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "One day prior to the transfection, aspirate medium from the cells and rinse them with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin to the 10-cm dish. Trypsinize RAW264.7 cells for about 5 - 10 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nWhen the majority of the cells have detached (after 5 - 10 min), add 5 mL of DMEM complete medium to the dish to inactivate the trypsin. Pipet up and down to disperse cell clusters into single cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a sterile 15-mL conical tube. Centrifuge it at 300 x g for 3 min at RT. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 5 mL of fresh DMEM complete medium and count the cells.\nPlate 9 x 104 cells per well in a 6-well plate with 2 mL of complete DMEM medium and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for about 24 h.\n\tNote: If using a plate of a different size, adjust the plated cell density in proportion to the relative surface area so that the cells reach 80% confluency at the time of transfection.\nWhen cell confluency is 80%, remove the medium from the cells and replace it with 1 mL of DMEM complete medium per well. Return the plate to the incubator until PEI-SPION/siRNA complexes have been prepared and are ready for use (about 30 min).",
    "Prepare PEI-SPION/siRNA complexes: calculate the amount of PEI-SPION/siRNA complexes needed for a transfection experiment. In a 1.5-mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube, mix an appropriate amount of PEI-SPIONs with siRNA at a given Fe:siRNA ratio. For instance, to prepare PEI-SPION/siRNA NPs containing 100 µg of Fe at a Fe:siRNA ratio of 4, add 100 µL (1 mg Fe/mL) of PEI-SPIONs to 96 μL of siRNA (0.26 μg/μL), followed by mixing it gently with a micropipette. Incubate for 30 min at RT.\n\tNote: Prepare a volume of PEI-SPION/siRNA complex that is 10% in excess of the total final mass to account for any incidental losses. Make PEI-SPION/siRNA complexes at low Fe:siRNA ratios, under which siRNA molecules are completely loaded onto PEI-SPIONs and, hence, small amounts of PEI-SPIONs can be used to minimize potential cytotoxicity. Pilot experiments (gel retardation assay) for the optimization of the Fe:siRNA ratio are necessary.\nTake out the 6-well plate from the incubator (step 3.7). Add a required volume of PEI-SPION/siRNA complex dropwise to each well and swirl the plate cautiously to ensure an even distribution. Return the plate to the incubator until the assessment of the cellular uptake or gene knockdown efficiency (1 - 3 d).\n\tNote: Transfecting macrophages with PEI-SPION/siRNA at a concentration of ~15 μg Fe/mL may maximize transfection efficiency while minimizing potential cytotoxicity.\n4. Systemic Delivery of siRNA to Macrophages in Rats with Experimental Arthritis\nObtain specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats that are 7 weeks old. Habituate the rats for 7 d prior to use and provide them with adequate food and water. Induce adjuvant arthritis (AA) in the rats as previously described18.\nPrepare PEI-SPION/siRNA complexes as described in step 3.8.",
    "Inject the PEI-SPION/siRNA NPs (0.3 mg of siRNA/kg) into the AA rats via the tail vein. Assess the cellular uptake via, for instance, flow cytometry, tissue biodistribution via, for instance, a real-time fluorescence imaging system, or therapeutic effects based on, for instance, clinical, histologic, and radiographic analyses at desired time points18.\n\tNote: For cellular and tissue biodistribution studies, treat the rats with a single injection of the desired NPs; for therapeutic studies, inject the rats with the NPs to be tested 1x a week for three consecutive weeks.\nSubscription Required.
