    "The animal care and surgical procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Ewha Womans University (no. 20-029).\n1. Preparation of an optrode array (Figure 1 and Figure 2)\nAttach optical fibers with the microlens array.\n\t\nRemove the passivation coating of the optical fiber and cut it into 5 mm-long pieces using a precision optical fiber cleaver.\nDip the optical fiber in the clear UV resin and place the optical fibers on the microlens array.\nCure the resin using a UV lamp.\nAttach the microlens array to the 3D printed housing using epoxy.\nAlign perfluoroalkoxy (PFA)-coated tungsten wires.\n\t\nSolder the 4 pieces of 30 mm-long PFA tungsten wires and 1 silver wire to the 5-pin, 1.27 mm pitch female connector. Use silver wire as a reference electrode.\nConnect the 1.27 mm pitch female connector to the headstage preamplifier.\nCarefully put tungsten wires through the silicon via the holes (Figure 1B) to help the fine alignment of the tungsten electrodes.\nCut the aligned tungsten wires 1 mm shorter than the optical fiber length.\nAttach the connector to the 3D printed housing using epoxy.\nLED placement\n\t\nPlace the LED in the 3D printed housing.\nConnect the LED to the driving circuit that generates pulse width modulation (PWM).\n\t\tNOTE: The PWM pulse is generated by the microcontroller.\nGiven the noise induced by the LED driving circuit, ensure the recording electrodes are 50 mm apart from the LED driving circuit.\nMeasure the light intensity at the end of the optical fiber tip using a photodiode.\nImmerse the tungsten electrodes and optical fibers in alcohol for 15 min. Then immerse the system in sterile D.I water and sterilize with ethylene oxide gas.\n2. Implantation surgery (Figure 3 and Figure 4)\nNOTE: Sterile technique must be followed during surgery.",
    "Prepare the transgenic animals, which are genetically modified to express light-sensitive opsin proteins in the specific type of neuronal cells.\n\tNOTE: A male, 2 months old, transgenic mouse expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-positive neurons (CaMKIIα::ChR2 mouse) was used in this study41.\nAnesthetize the mouse with a ketamine-xylazine cocktail-a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)-by intraperitoneal administration.\n\t\nCheck the anesthetized animal every 30 min by monitoring whisker movement and reaction to paw pinch.\nInject the ketamine-xylazine cocktail at half of the initial dose if additional anesthesia is needed.\nShave the head skin and place the anesthetized mouse in the stereotactic frame.\n\tNOTE: Perform surgical skin prep and drape animal. Skin preparation involves hair removal followed by cleaning of the skin with antimicrobial agents.\n\t\nPosition the head within the stereotactic frame and insert ear bars into the meatus.\nCenter the mouse head in the stereotactic frame by repeatedly loosening and tightening the ear bars for exact positioning.\nPlace the incisor bar so that the upper incisors hook over the front inside edge.\nAdjust the incisor bar for setting the height of the incisor bar, and tighten the nose clamp against the snout.\nTurn on the thermal heating pad embedded in the stereotactic frame in advance to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C throughout the surgical procedures.\nPut the thermal probe into the mouse's rectum for homeothermic regulation.\n\t\tNOTE: Ear bar placement must be checked by gently grasping and swaying the snout. The ear bar must be readjusted if the snout can be moved more than ~4 mm laterally.\nCover the eyes with petroleum jelly (see the Table of Materials) to prevent dryness.",
    "Inject 1% lidocaine into the scalp. Lift the skin of the head with forceps, secure an injection space, and inject the lidocaine under the scalp.\nPerform a sagittal incision using a scalpel and fine scissors. Hold the incised skin with a microclamp to broaden the visibility of the surgical area.\n\tNOTE: The incision length is <1 cm above the bregma and caudal edge of the interparietal bone.\nRemove the periosteum using cotton swabs. If there is bleeding, cauterize the skull using a bovie to seal the blood vessels.\nClean the skull with saline and mark the craniotomy sites using a manipulator arm: hippocampus Anterior-Posterior (AP) −1.8 to −2.8 mm, Medial-Lateral (ML) 0.5-2.5 mm, and Dorsal-Ventral (DV) −1 to −2 mm.\n\tNOTE: Considering the thickness of the mouse skull, insert the optrode array -1.2 to -2.2 mm from the exposed brain area. Given the hippocampal pathway, pyramidal cells of CA3 send their axons to CA1. Therefore, optical fibers are 1 mm longer than recording electrodes, so that the optical fibers are placed in CA3 and the recording electrodes in CA1.\nDrill a hole above the cerebellum and insert a screw for ground. Put the ground screw 0.5 mm deep with a precision screw until it reaches the top of the cerebellum.\n\tNOTE: Ensure tight insertion of the screw, which will be used as a ground electrode and a supporting structure to maximize the long-term stability of implantation, as it increases the three-dimensional surface for adherence of the dental cement.\nDrill the marked area and remove a piece of the skull with forceps.\nBend a 26 G needle tip to clockwise 120°, and expose the brain area by inserting the bevel side of the needle faced upward. Be careful not to damage the brain and blood vessels.",
    "Clean the exposed brain with saline to wash out bone dust and extraneous matter.\nFix the optrode array in the manipulator arm and move close to the exposed area.\n\tNOTE: When placing the device, recalculating the target area again from the bregma can increase the accuracy of the placement.\nSlowly insert the optrode array and connect the ground screw to the silver wire attached to the system42.\n\tNOTE: In this process, the array must be tightly fixed to the manipulator arm to minimize wobbling to prevent brain damage from micromotion during insertion. Insertion must be performed slowly, with rest for 10 min to account for swelling of the brain that may have been pressed after insertion. Insertion speed under 1 µm/s into the brain tissue is recommended for the high quality of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of separable single units42.\nIf there is bleeding, apply direct pressure to bleeders with a dry cotton swab or use cautery. Do not move on to the next steps until bleeding is completely stopped.\nInsert gel foam between the exposed brain and the device to protect chemicals from direct contact with the brain.\n\tNOTE: Gel foam also helps hemostasis and keeps the brain moist.\nWipe the skull with cotton swabs to remove moisture as much as possible, and proceed to the next fixation step.\nCarefully apply dental cement to the skull to fix the device and cover the gel foam. Before the dental cement is completely hardened, separate the scalp if attached to dental cement. Pull the incised skin with forceps to cover the hardened dental cement and suture the scalp. Then, release the device from the manipulator arm.",
    "​NOTE: Ensure that the dental cement does not stick to the skin and only covers the skull region. When the skin grows, it can push the cement away and, eventually, the device will fall off. This will cause a critical problem for long-term in vivo experiments.\n3. Recovery and implant care\nTake the mouse out of the stereotactic frame.\nAdminister Carprofen solution using a 26 G needle. Inject once before surgery and 12 h (next morning in case of afternoon surgery) and 24 h after surgery to reduce pain.\n\tNOTE: The drug concentration in the bottle is 50 mg/mL, and it is stored at 4 °C. Carprofen is viscous and needs to be diluted in sterile water 1:10. If sterility is maintained, the solution can be stored for up to 4 weeks. To maintain the effective duration of the drug, inject the Carprofen solution at 12 h intervals.\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad and check if it recovers well from the anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The animal is not left unattended until it regains sufficient consciousness.\nRemove the suture threads 7 - 10 days after surgery.\nAllow the animal to recover for 1 week. Monitor food and water intake during recovery time. Administer the analgesic and check for the signs of discomfort or pain.\n\tNOTE: The animals that have undergone surgery cannot stay with the other animals until they fully recover.\n\t\nDuring the recovery period, weigh the mouse every day to check for weight changes. Sacrifice the mouse (see section 6) if there is 20% weight loss compared to age and sex matched control animals.\n4. Optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological recording\nAnesthetize the mouse and place the anesthetized mouse in the stereotactic frame.\nSet up the stimulation parameters.",
    "Set the light pulse recipe to 4% duty cycle and 10 Hz frequency43. Set up the light stimulation for 2 s (20 pulses) during neural recording.\nUse a 50 mA current to drive 3 mW/mm2 light intensity at the optical fiber tip. Measure the light power using a photodiode and power meter and divide the light power by the optical fiber facet area.\nTake off the plastic cover and attach the upper part containing the light delivery system with the reusable LED and circuits.\nConnect the headstage preamplifier to the implanted 5 pin connector.\nOpen the software to record neural signals.\nSet up the software filters. Use a bandpass filter at 0.1-20 kHz and a notch filter at 60 Hz. Set the amplifier sampling rate to 20 kHz.\nBefore the recording, check if the neural spike signals are detected.\n\tNOTE: Noise cancellation is important because neural signals are too small. If the noise level is too high, neural signals may be obscured by noise and become invisible. Use appropriate grounding and electromagnetic wave shielding to reduce noise.\nAfter the signal check, record neural signals without light stimulation for baseline recording.\nDeliver LED light and simultaneously record neuronal responses (Figure 5 and Figure 6).\n\t​NOTE: Once stimulated, the next stimulation experiment must be performed after an interval of at least 5 min so that the neuronal activity evoked by the previous stimulation does not affect the next experiment.\n5. Data analysis\nLoad the acquired data using MATLAB program.\nObtain single neural activities using a spike sorting algorithm \"Wave-Clus\"44,45. Detect the spikes in each channel by an amplitude threshold as in Eq (1)45.\n\tThreshold = 5 × median imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63460/63460eq01.jpg (1)\n\t​Where x is the bandpass-filtered signal.\n\t\nTo install \"Wave-Clus,\" refer to the download link in the Table of Materials.",
    "To open the graphical user interface (GUI), type wave_clus in the command prompt of MATLAB.\nType Get_spikes('filename.ext') function for file extension prepared to spike detection. Then, run Do_clustering('filename_spikes.mat') for spike sorting.\nCount the sorted spikes before, during, and after light stimulation with specific time bins. Use 0.2 s and 2 s time bins for analysis.\nPlot the number of spikes from each recording channel.\n\t​NOTE: Mean with standard error of the means (SEM) of the data from the results of 8 repeated experiments was calculated and plotted.\n6. Euthanasia\nAfter all the experiments, sacrifice the mouse by carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation.\nWithout precharging the chamber, place the mouse in the transparent euthanasia chamber, without CO2 supply and/or leaks.\nTurn on the CO2 gas, and displace the air at a rate of 30 - 50% of the volume of euthanasia chamber air per min.\n\tNOTE: A flowmeter must be connected to the CO2 gas cylinder to ensure that the air displacement rate is 30-50% of the volume of the euthanasia chamber per min.\nMonitor the sacrificed mouse for lack of respiration and changed eye color.\n\tNOTE: The expected time for euthanasia is usually within 10 to 15 min.\nAfter observing the death signs, remove the mouse from the euthanasia chamber.\nTo complete the euthanasia procedure, verify death by confirming respiratory and cardiac arrest.\nSubscription Required.
