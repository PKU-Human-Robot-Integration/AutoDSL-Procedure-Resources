  "procedures": [
    "1. Tissue collection\nAfter surgery, transfer freshly resected human tumor specimens into a tube containing 25 mL of fresh culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose and L-glutamine + 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum + 1% penicillin–streptomycin) and stored on ice. Process the explant within 2 h of surgery in a sterile class II hood.\n2. Explant preparation\nClean all surgical equipment (graft blades/dental wax surface/tweezers) with 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS) solution.\nFill a 10 cm culture dish (see the Table of Materials) with ~25 mL of fresh medium, and place it on top of a bed of ice.\nUsing tweezers, transfer the specimen onto a dental wax surface (see the Table of Materials), and slice the tissue into fragments of approximately 2–3 mm3 using two skin graft blades.\n\tNOTE: For best performance, start slicing the tissue to obtain an individual strip of 2–3 mm of thickness, and then cut the strip along the length to obtain the final explants. Repeat the process until the whole specimen is chopped.\nTransfer the explants promptly into the ice-cold culture medium in the 10 cm dish. Take a proportion of the explants (6–9 pieces), place them in a 1 mL tube containing 10% of non-buffered formalin solution, and leave at room temperature (RT) for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: These fragments will represent the control explants for the “uncultured” condition.\nFill the desired number of wells of 6-well plates with 1.5 mL of fresh medium per well, and place an organotypic culture insert disc (see the Table of Materials) in each well so that it floats on top of the medium, carefully avoiding air bubbles at the media-insert interface.",
    "Select explants randomly, and place them one at a time on top of the insert disc. To be consistent with the “uncultured” condition, use 6–9 explants per well. Place the multiwell plate in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and allow the explants to recover for 16 h.\n\tNOTE: To avoid crushing the tissue, gentle handling of the tweezers is highly recommended.\n3. Drug treatment\nAfter 16 h, take new 6-well plates, add 1.5 mL of fresh medium to each well, add the relevant drugs at the desired concentrations, and include a well for the vehicle control. Using the tweezers, move each insert containing the explants to the newly prepared 6-well plates containing the drugs. Place the plates in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24–48 h.\nTransfer the uncultured explants previously fixed in formalin into a histology cassette (see section 4 below), and store in 70% IMS until the end of the experiment.\n4. Histological processing\nTissue fixation\n\t\nAfter drug treatment, transfer the insert discs containing the explants into new 6-well plates containing 10% formalin, and add a few drops of 10% formalin onto the top of the explants to ensure complete coverage with the fixative.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formalin is hazardous. Avoid any contact with skin, and handle it inside a fume food to prevent inhalation.\nAllow the explants to remain overnight (20–24 h) in the 10% formalin.",
    "On the next day, soak the relevant number of small histology sponges in 70% IMS, and place them inside histology cassettes. Gently transfer all the explants from a given drug treatment condition onto a single sponge (maintain the orientation of the explants so that the sides of the explants in contact with the insert discs, and therefore the drug-treated areas, are placed in contact with the sponge). Place another presoaked sponge on top of the explants, and secure within a histology cassette (one cassette per well/treatment).\nSubmerge the cassettes in 70% IMS, and leave at RT for 24 h.\nParaffin embedding and tissue sectioning\n\t\nOn the following day, transfer the histology cassettes containing the explants into the sample basket of the tissue processor (see the Table of Materials), and secure the lid. Place the basket in the retort and close gently. Select the desired program, and start the processor. Drain the retort, open it to remove the basket, and transfer the basket into the embedding center wax bath.\nAfter embedding, transfer the metal cassette lids into the basket, and return to the retort of the tissue processor for the cleaning program. Wipe the sensor with a dry tissue, remove any excess wax from the retort lid, and proceed with the cleaning program.\nPosition a paraffin block in the rotary microtome, cut a few sections at 4 µm, and return the block to ice. Reposition the block, and cut more 4 µm sections. Transfer the sections with a small paint brush and forceps onto a water bath to remove creases and bubbles.",
    "Position the sections centrally onto microscope slides, drain the slides for few minutes, and place them into a slide rack to dry overnight in an incubator at 37 °C. When the sections are dry, store them at RT in a slide folder or box to protect from dust.\n5. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nFill the stainer (see the Table of Materials) with reagents, and set the required program for H&E staining: hematoxylin incubation time: 5 min; eosin incubation time: 3 min.\nAttach the slide rack to the carrier, place it into the first container with xylene, and start the program. Remove the slide carrier from the rack, and take the container with the slide rack to the mounting area.\nMount the slides with dibutyl phthalate xylene (DPX) under the extraction hood. Place DPX onto each coverslip, and lower the slide onto the coverslip with the section downwards, allowing the DPX to spread out.\n\tNOTE: DPX is hazardous. Avoid any contact with skin and use in a designated fume hood.\n6. Immunostaining\nNOTE: The following steps should be carried out at RT unless stated otherwise.\nDeparaffinization and rehydration\n\t\nPlace the slides in a slide rack, and heat at 65 °C for 10 min before deparaffinizing the sections in xylene for 3 min (2x). Minimize the amount of carry-over solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Xylene is flammable, hazardous, and irritant. Handle inside the fume hood whilst using double-layered gloves. Avoid skin and eye contact. Dispose of waste within a sealed container.\nRehydrate the slides in an alcohol gradient as follows: 99% IMS for 1 min (2x) and 95% IMS for 1 min. Minimize the amount of carry-over solution.\n\t\tNOTE: IMS is highly flammable, volatile, and irritant. Handle inside the fume hood, and avoid skin and eye contact.",
    "Completely submerge the slide rack in ultrapure (UP) water for 5 min.\nAntigen retrieval\n\t\nPrepare antigen retrieval buffer according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for the particular antibody used.\n\t\tNOTE: Citrate buffer 0.2 M, pH 6, or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) 0.1 M, pH 9, are the common buffers used for acidic or alkaline conditions, respectively. Citric acid monohydrate and Tris are irritant agents. Prepare all stock solutions in the fume hood. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.\nSubmerge the rack containing the slides into antigen retrieval buffer, and microwave (see the Table of Materials) at full power (800 W) for 20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the slides fully submerged in the buffer during the entire process. To avoid excessive reduction of the buffer volume, place a lid on top of the container used.\nMultiplex immunofluorescence (mIF)\n\tNOTE: This process takes 1–2 days.\n\t\nFill a clean container with 250 mL of UP water, and completely submerge the slide rack for 2 min (2x). Proceed with assembling each slide into a slide coverplate (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nTo assemble a slide onto a coverplate, prepare a glass trough with water. Submerge both the coverplate and slide in the water, placing the tissue section side facing the coverplate.\nPosition the bottom edge of the slide on top of the protuberances at the bottom of the coverplate, and finally align the slide to the coverplate, allowing the water to fill the gap in between with no air trapped. Hold the coverplate and slide together, and place them in a coverplate rack.\nFill the coverplate with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and wait for the buffer to wash the slides, flowing out by gravity (2x). Pipet 110 μL of blocking buffer (see the Table of Materials) onto each coverplate and incubate for 10 min.",
    "Prepare the desired primary antibody dilution in PBS or blocking buffer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Incubate the slides with primary antibody (110 μL each slide) for 30 min. Wash the slides with 5 mL of PBS (2x), as described in 6.3.2.\nIncubate the slides with 110 μL of horseradish peroxidase polymer for 30 min. Wash the slides with 5 mL of PBS (2x), as described in 6.3.2.\nPrepare fluorophore dilution in amplification diluent 1:100 (v/v), and incubate the slides with fluorophore (110 μL each slide) for 10 min. Wash the slides with 5 mL of PBS (2x), as described in 6.3.2.\n\t\tNOTE: For the use of fluorophore 780, follow the manufacturer’s guidelines. The experiment may be paused here if the slides are incubated in the final wash of PBS and stored at 4 °C overnight.\nUnclip the slides from the coverplates, and go back to the antigen retrieval step to start the staining with a different antibody. Repeat the staining for the desired number of antibodies to be tested.\nFollowing step 6.3.5 for the last fluorophore in use, keep the slides on the coverplates, prepare 6 μM solution of 4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dilactate with UP water, and counterstain the slides for 5 min (110 μL each slide). Wash the slides with UP water (2x), and remove excess water by drying the edges of the slides. Assemble the coverslips on the slides using mounting medium, and store at RT in the dark.\n7. Scanning\nNOTE: Slide scanning was performed using a multispectral automated imaging system (see the Table of Materials).\nAssemble the slides into the carrier, and load them into the scanner in the desired order.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended that a control slide be included in which no fluorophore or DAPI is used during immunohistochemical staining. This slide will be used as the control for intrinsic florescence (autofluorescence (AF)) of the tissue.\nAfter launching the slide scanner software, select Edit Protocol from the Home page. Create a new protocol addressing the name, imaging mode, the type of multispectral scan to be performed (4–7 channels), and study (directory).\n\tNOTE: To modify the default settings of bands analyzed, select/deselect the desired filters using the function Select Scan Bands\nProceed with Scan Exposure and Load carrier, and finally select the carrier for the protocol setup. Select Take Overview to detect the tissue on the slide. Choose a slide displayed on the carrier, and select a specific area of the tissue with the red cursor to bring it into live view on the left window of the screen.\nSelect the DAPI filter, and click on Autofocus or manually adjust the Stage Height slider to focus the field of interest. Click on Autoexpose to allow the system to find the best exposure for that filter/band.\n\tNOTE: The exposure time for each filter is set at 12 ms. After autoexposing the system, refine the exposure time to a better estimate. It is also possible to override the autoexposure value by typing a value manually into the highlighted cell.\nRepeat the above steps for all filters in the protocol. If necessary, change the locations and/or slides to find the best signals for setting the exposures.\n\tNOTE: If the tissue is highlighted in red in live view, the fluorescent signal of the filter analyzed is saturated, and autoexposure must be repeated.",
    "Once the exposure settings have been established, click on the Back button, and Save the protocol. From the software home page (see the Table of Materials), select Scan Slides.\nStack all the carriers to be scanned into the Slide Carrier Hotel, and take note of the order of the slides to assign their ID into the system.\n\tNOTE: On the software screen, each carrier will be related to a slot containing 4 slides.\nTo configure multiple slides with the same parameters, click on Configure Tasks, and select one or more Slots with the option Using the same rules for the same slides. Once the Edit Slides opens, configure: Tasks, Study, and Protocol, and click on OK.\nLabel each slide by clicking on the Slot icon, and type a name in the Slide ID cell. Click on Scan to start scanning.\n\tNOTE: Once the Slot icon turns blue and the slides are marked with a blue arrow, the carrier has all the rules and is ready to be scanned. It is possible to save the slide IDs, studies, protocols, and tasks by clicking on the Save Setup button.\n8. Analysis\nNOTE: The protocol below illustrates the method for phenotype analysis.\nImage preparation\n\t\nTo prepare the images for analysis, open the viewer software (see the Table of Materials), and select Load slides. Select the desired scans for the training project on the right-hand side of the screen.\nFor each scan, click on Stamp, and choose Project in the box Select for: Define a stamp with size 1 x 1 in the image field to be used later as a template for the training analysis. Observe that this stamp will be marked as a red square.",
    "NOTE: The number of stamp annotations for the Project is arbitrary. It is recommended to generate one for the intrinsic fluorescence scan and a few more that are generally representative of the signal distribution within the tissue.\nFinally, open all the scans of the experiment. For each one, click on Stamp, and this time, choose the option Batch in the box Select for: Place a stamp circumscribing each explant.\n\t\tNOTE: This time, the stamps will be marked as green squares and will be required once the batch analysis is launched. Choose the appropriate size for the stamps (1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3) and avoid overlapping of the stamps, which would generate duplicated data in the exported file.\nTraining analysis\nLaunch the software for analysis (see the Table of Materials), and create a new project: Select File | New | Project.\nType a name in the Project Name box, and configure the type of project.\n\tNOTE: The experiments were performed using the following specifications: trainable tissue segmentation; adaptive cell segmentation; phenotyping.\nLoad the scans containing the stamps for training: File | Open | Image. In single mode view, navigate through the images and select the scans with intrinsic fluorescence.\nClick on the Autofluorescence (AF) button, and with the Autofluorescence picker, draw on an unstained portion of tissue. Click on Prepare images to allow the software to subtract the intensity of intrinsic fluorescence from all the images uploaded for training.\nClick on the Edit Markers and Colors button, and enter the marker names in the box associated with their fluorophore. Click on the Segment Tissue step on top of the screen to open the Tissue Segmentation Training window.",
    "In the Tissue Categories window, type in the name of the tissue categories to segment the images into (e.g., Tumor, Stroma, Background, Necrosis).\nIn the Tissue Segmentation Training window, click on the Draw button and draw regions around groups of cells to define a tissue category of interest. For example, to define a Tumor area, draw a region around a group of tumor cells. Switch to the next category and repeat the drawing process.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to draw regions in most of the images uploaded for training. It is also possible to refine the training by editing the Pattern Scale and the Segmentation Resolution whose details are better described in the user manual.\nHaving defined the training regions, proceed with Train the Tissue Segmenter.\n\tNOTE: During the process of training, the software displays the percentage of accuracy of tissue segmentation. For optimal results, it is recommended that tissue segmentation be at least 90% accurate. Once the Segmenter has stabilized, click on the Done button.\nTo see the Tissue Category mask on all images, click on the Segment All button.\nAfter verifying the quality of tissue segmentation, re-draw the training regions around the areas that were incorrectly classified, and re-train the Tissue Segmenter until the process is successful.\nClick on the Cell Segmentation step in the Step Bar at the top of the window to proceed with the analysis.\nChoose the cellular compartments to segment: Nuclei, Cytoplasm, and/or Membrane.\n\tNOTE: As adaptive cell segmentation can only detect cells with nuclear signal, do not de-select Nuclei. Although it is also possible to segment cytoplasm and/or membrane, it is recommended to choose the strongest, most abundant nuclear component first (e.g., DAPI).",
    "Configure the nuclear component using the Typical Intensity slider to adjust the threshold used to detect nuclear pixels. Take note of the preview window that opens and provides live feedback as the threshold is adjusted.\n\tNOTE: This threshold is adaptive and is measured relative to the surrounding background. Increase this value if too much background is detected as nuclear. Lower this value if faint nuclei are being missed. Use the Show/Hide Regions button to blink the segmentation masks on and off, and check whether the correct pixels are being detected as nuclear.\nTo split clusters of nuclear pixels, use the Nuclear Component Splitting panel. Choose the button that best describes the staining quality of the nuclei. Then, use the slider bar to adjust the Splitting Sensitivity, keeping in mind that lower values will result in more splitting.\nClick on the Segment All button to segment all the images. If the result is not accurate, modify the settings and re-train the software until a satisfying segmentation is achieved.\nProceed to the last step of the analysis: Phenotyping. In the Phenotypes panel, add the list of phenotypes to be detected, and type the name in the corresponding text box. Click on the Edit Phenotypes button, select a particular cell to bring up a dropdown menu, and choose the corresponding phenotype.\n\tNOTE: At least five cells for each phenotype are necessary to train the classifier. Turning off the visualization of the nuclei allows better visualization of the cell phenotype that needs to be assigned.\nOnce the selection for training is complete, click on the Train Classifier button.",
    "NOTE: The software will classify every single cell in the image, and whenever errors in classification occur, it is possible to edit the phenotype of the cells and repeat the training of the classifier. Save the project before proceeding to batch analysis, and click on the Export in the tool bar on the top of the screen.\nSelect the Bath Analysis tab on the left menu, and load the project in the Batch Algorithm or Project box.\nClick on Export Options to create separate directories for each image, and with the Browse button, navigate to find the location to export the data. Click on all the options of the Images and Tables to export.\nOn the right side of the screen, click on Add Slides and load all the images containing stamps for previously prepared batches (step 7.3). Click on the Run button to start the batch analysis and process one stamp at a time, exporting the corresponding data.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
