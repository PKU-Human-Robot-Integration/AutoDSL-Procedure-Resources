    "The animal procedure referred to in this protocol was performed according to protocols 323 and 556 and specifically approved by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of solutions\nNOTE: Use ultrapure water for all solutions and when stated in procedures.\nPrepare 1 mM potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water.\nPrepare 0.25 M KOH in water.\nPrepare 1 M Trizma-HCl in water and adjust to pH 8.0.\nPrepare 100 mM monobromobimane (mBBr) in acetonitrile (Optima Grade). Stock solutions of mBBr are stable at -20 °C for many months provided they are kept in the dark as exposure to light can photolyze the monobromobimane to bimane26.\nPrepare Wash Buffer for solid phase extraction (SPE) column: 50% methanol (Optima Grade) + 2% acetic acid.\nPrepare Elution Buffer for SPE column: 95% ethanol (HPLC Grade) containing 50 mM ammonium formate.\n2. Preparation of CoA-bimane standard\nPurchase a high-quality CoA standard from a reputable source (e.g., Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.).\nPrepare a high concentration stock solution of CoA in 20 mM Tris, pH 8. The amount of CoA in the high concentration stock is determined or confirmed by spectrophotometric absorbance at λ260 nm (Ɛ = 16,800 M-1∙cm-1). Add 4-fold molar excess of mBBr; vortex on high for 10 s. For example, for 10 mM CoA in buffer, add 40 mM mBBr. The mBBr is added in excess to ensure that all the CoA is derivatized.\nIncubate at room temperature for 4 h in the dark without shaking to derivatize the CoA with mBBr. mBBr reacts with the thiol group of the CoA, and it is pH and temperature dependent27. Addition of the mBBr converts CoA to a water-soluble fluorescent (or ultraviolet absorbant) CoA-bimane (CoA-bimane; Figure 2).",
    "Add 100 μL acetic acid and vortex on high for 10 s to stop the reaction.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 x g for 15 minutes to remove any precipitant.\nClean-up the supernatant using an SPE-column to remove the unreacted mBBr (described below). Filtration and centrifugation of the eluate is not necessary after the SPE column clean-up (Section 5.8).\nCollect the eluate from the SPE column containing the CoA-bimane in a pre-weighed tube, dry under nitrogen gas, weigh and construct a standard calibration curve with known quantities of CoA-bimane.\n\t\nCheck the CoA-bimane standard for purity by HPLC (see below) with absorbance detection at both λ260 (adenine moiety) and λ393 (bimane moiety) and coincidence of both peaks in the chromatogram.\nConfirm the quantity of the CoA-bimane standard in the high concentration stock using λ260 nm (Ɛ = 16,800 M-1∙cm-1).\nRegister the HPLC retention time for identification of CoA-bimane in experimental samples using the CoA-bimane standard.\nStore aliquots of the high concentration stock of the CoA-bimane standard protected from light and stored at -20 °C for up to 2 years. Avoid repeated thawing and re-freezing.\n3. Extraction and derivatization of CoA in cultured cells\nHarvest adherent cells in culture when approaching late subconfluent densities. For example, human HepG2/C3A cells are grown to a density of 6-8 x 106, or HEK 293T cells are grown to a density of ~1.3 x 107 per 100 mm dish.\n\t\nUse duplicate or triplicate cultures routinely for CoA determinations. Incubate separate culture dishes in parallel with the sample cell cultures to determine viable cell number. Calculate the amount of CoA per 106-107 cells after HPLC purification.",
    "Aspirate culture medium off the dish. Quickly wash cells on the dish with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any residual medium and aspirate the PBS off the dish. Quickly wash cells with ice-cold water to remove residual PBS and aspirate the water off the dish quickly. Avoid disturbing the adherent cells when adding the PBS or water.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold water to the culture dish. Scrape cells into the cold water in the dish and transfer the cell suspension to a glass test tube containing 400 μL of 0.25 M KOH and 1.5 mL of water.\n\t\nMix the suspension vigorously by vortex on high for 10 s. Then cover tightly with paraffin film and incubate at 55 °C for 1 h without shaking in a water bath. The pH of the sample should be ≥ 12. The high pH is important to hydrolyze the CoA thioesters and can be adjusted with additional aliquots of KOH if necessary.\nHarvest cultured cells growing in suspension by centrifugation at low speed: 136 x g for 6 min at 4 °C. Wash once with ice-cold PBS, then briefly wash again with cold water, and finally resuspend in 2.5 mL of cold water plus 400 µL 0.25 M KOH. Mix vigorously and incubate at 55 °C as described above.\nAdd 160 μL of 1 M Trizma-HCl and 10 μL of 100 mM mBBr and mix by vortex on high for 10 s. This brings the pH to approximately 8 to support the mBBr reaction with free CoA. Cover and incubate samples at room temperature for 2 h in the dark for the mBBr to react with the thiol of CoA.\nAdd 100 μL of acetic acid and mix by vortex on high for 10 s to stop the reaction",
    "Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 15 min to remove precipitated cell debris.\nRemove and save supernatant in a glass test tube for the SPE column clean-up that is described below.\n4. Extraction and derivatization of CoA in tissues\nDissect animal tissue pieces, about 0.5 cm diameter or smaller, and blot briefly (1-2 s) on absorbent paper and then flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until processing. CoA in tissues is hydrolyzed or converted to a thioester if not flash frozen. This step is important to obtain the maximum yield of CoA in tissues.\nWeigh frozen tissue pieces (5 – 60 mg) quickly prior to starting the analysis, and record the weight for each sample. This wet weight determination is used for calculation of the CoA content following HPLC purification. Avoid complete thaw of the tissue pieces.\nAdd 2 mL of 1 mM KOH to a glass test tube (e.g., 13 mm x 100 mm disposable) destined for insertion of a probe and tissue disruption with a rotor-stator homogenizer. Keep the tube on ice until use. This is done to ensure that the samples are homogenized at a cold temperature and CoA is not destroyed due to the heat generated during homogenization.\nTransfer and homogenize tissue (30 – 40 mg) in the glass test tube (containing cold 1 mM KOH) for 30 s. Avoid complete thawing of the tissue.\nAdd 500 μL of 0.25 M KOH; vortex on high for 10 s and keep on ice until all samples are homogenized. This will bring the pH of the sample above 12 to hydrolyze the CoA thioesters to yield total CoA (free CoA + hydrolyzed CoA thioesters).\nIncubate samples at 55 °C for 2 h in a water bath without shaking to support hydrolysis.",
    "Add 150 μL of 1 M Trizma-HCl and 10 μL of 100 mM mBBr; vortex on high for 10 seconds. This brings the pH to about 8 to support the mBBr reaction with free CoA.\nIncubate samples at room temperature for 2 h in the dark to ensure all the CoA is derivatized with mBBr.\nAdd 100 μL of acetic acid and vortex on high for 10 s to stop the reaction.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 x g for 15 min to pellet precipitated cell debris.\nRemove and save supernatant in a glass test tube for the SPE column clean-up (described below).\n5. Sample clean-up with solid phase extraction (SPE) column\nAt room temperature, equilibrate each disposable 2-(2-pyridyl)-ethyl silica gel column (1 mL size) with 1 mL of Wash Buffer to ensure that the pyridyl functional group is protonated and will function as an anion-exchanger. 2-(2-pyridyl)-ethyl silica gel is a weak anion exchanger which is ideal for CoA-bimane at a basic pH. 2-(2-pyridyl)-ethyl silica gel has a pKa of 6 and the elution is done pH ≥ 7.\nAdd sample supernatant (step 4.11) to column and collect eluate.\nWash column twice with 1 mL of Wash Buffer to remove any unretained species.\nWash column once with 1 mL of water.\nWash column twice with 1 mL of Elution Buffer into a separate glass test tube (12 mm x 75 mm) to collect the CoA-bimane.\nDry CoA-bimane sample in tube under nitrogen gas to dryness. The dried sample is stable at room temperature until further use. Seal and completely cover the tube and store.\nWhen ready for HPLC analysis, resuspend sample in 300 μL of water and mix vigorously by vortex on high for 10 s.",
    "Transfer resuspended sample to a centrifuge tube filter (0.22 µm cellulose acetate, 2 mL size) and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 10 min to remove any precipitant.\nTransfer filtered sample to a glass vial suitable for HPLC injection.\n6. HPLC purification and measurement of CoA-bimane\nPrepare buffers. Buffer A: 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 4.6; Buffer B: Acetonitrile (Optima Grade).\nPower up the HPLC system.\n\tNOTE: The HPLC system in our laboratory is a Waters e2695 Separations Module equipped with a 2489 Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorbance detector and a 2475 fluorescence detector controlled with Empower 3 software. The system also has an automated sample injector.\nInject each sample (e.g., 20 μL) for separation on a Gemini C18, 3 μm 100 Å, 4.6 mm x 150 mm column using the program in Table 1 with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column temperature is 25 °C. Measure the UV/Visible detector absorbance at λ393 nm, and fluorescent detection at λex = 393 nm, λem = 470 nm. The retention time is determined by running a CoA-bimane standard curve before each set of samples.\nRecord the area under the CoA-bimane peak for each sample and compare with the standard curve to calculate pmol of CoA-bimane injected onto the HPLC column. The CoA-bimane absorbance standard curve is used for tissue samples, and the CoA-bimane fluorescence standard curve is used for tissue culture samples.\nAs the CoA-bimane values represent total CoA for each sample, normalize to the number of viable cells for culture samples, or mg wet weight for tissue samples (Figure 6). Alternately, calculate the total CoA values following normalization to DNA or protein content for each sample. DNA or protein content can be determined separately using sample aliquots that are removed during sample preparation prior to KOH addition.",
