    "All procedures involving animals have been reviewed and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical University of South Carolina.  The protocol was approved under USDA category D for pain. \n1. Cell Implantation\nTwo days before performing the procedure, plate 1 x 106 MB49 cells into T-25 flasks. Use high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (and antibiotics, if desired). One flask is sufficient for each group of up to five mice that will be anesthetized and implanted in parallel.\nOn the day of the procedure, prepare trypsin for instillation by diluting sterile 0.25% tissue culture grade trypsin to 0.125% with sterile DMEM base medium (1:2 dilution). 1.2 ml is sufficient for 10 mice. Place in a 37 °C waterbath to equilibrate.\nPrewarm a heating pad and position it under the nosecones of the anesthesia system that will be used to deliver isoflurane. Place a clean absorbent pad over the heating pad.\nPlace mice into the induction chamber of the anesthesia system and induce anesthesia with 3% isoflurane. When mice have lost consciousness, which is verified by loss of the toe-pinch reflex, transfer them to the nosecones. Make sure each animal is in a supine position and properly placed on the heating pad to maintain body temperature.\nReduce the isoflurane concentration to 2% to maintain anesthesia.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent drying.\nOptional step: Remove abdominal hair. Hair on the lower abdomen must be removed if in vivo bioluminescent imaging will be performed.\n\t\nApply a generous layer of depilatory cream, such as Veet, to the lowest 1 in square of fur on the abdomen, taking care not to contact the external genitalia. Wait 3 min.",
    "Remove hair by rubbing the area with a dry sponge, and then use a damp sponge to cleanse the skin. Repeat once, if needed.\nCatheterize the bladder\n\t\nLubricate a new, sterile 24 G pediatric venous catheter with a nonirritating lubricating gel such as K-Y. Remove and discard the needle. If leaking of fluid around the catheter is a common problem, i.e. it occurs more frequently than in one of ten mice, larger bore catheters (20 G) can be used. This may be an important consideration in mice older than 8 weeks.\nHolding the hub of the catheter, use the thumb and index finger of your opposite hand to spread the hind legs of the mouse and expose the urethral meatus. Gently insert the catheter into the urethra at a 45° angle, changing the angle to one parallel with the bench to insert it fully.\nAfter full insertion, lift the catheter gently, keeping it parallel to the bench, and visually confirm that it is placed in the urethra and not the vagina, which is below it. If correctly placed, the catheter will be able to be inserted fully since the vagina is shorter than the urethra.\nReduce the isoflurane concentration to 1%.\nAttach a tip to a P200 pipettor and remove urine from the bladder by applying suction to the external end of the catheter. Remove any remaining urine from the hub of the catheter. Discard urine and leave catheter in place.\nCarefully pipette 80 μl 0.125% trypsin solution into the hub of the catheter, avoiding air bubbles. Attach a 1 ml air-filled syringe to the catheter hub and slowly depress the plunger 0.1-0.2 ml to deliver the trypsin into the bladder.",
    "Leave the syringe and catheter assembly in place for 15 min. Repeat steps 1.8-1.11 for any of the remaining anesthetized mice (up to 4). Proceed to the next step during the waiting period. HINT: Initially it may be helpful to have someone else prepare the cells (step 1.12).\nPrepare MB49 cells for implantation. Cells were plated at 1 x 106 per T-25 flask 48 hr before implantation (step 1.1).\n\t\nRemove media and add 500 µl of 0.25% trypsin to the flask. When cells detach add 5 ml of complete DMEM to resuspend cells. Remove a 50 μl aliquot to count, and centrifuge the remainder at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. During the centrifugation step continue to steps 1.12.2 and 1.12.3.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer. Calculate the cells/ml. Then calculate the volume needed to bring the cell pellet to 4 x 106 cells/ml (2 x 105 cells per 50 μl).\nPour off supernatant from centrifuged cells and resuspend the pellet in DMEM base medium using the volume required to suspend cells to 4 x 106 cells/ml (as calculated in step 1.12.2). Keep cells at room temperature.\nWhen the 15 min time point for trypsin treatment of bladders is reached, detach the air-filled syringe from the catheter leaving the catheter in place. Spent trypsin will normally flow back out through the catheter. Remove any remaining trypsin from the bladder by suction with the P200 pipettor as in step 1.9 above and discard.\nImmediately pipette 50 μl of MB49 cell suspension into the hub of the catheter. Attach the 1 ml air-filled syringe to the hub of the catheter and deliver the cells to the bladder by slowly depressing the plunger 0.1-0.2 ml. Repeat this step up to four additional times to implant all five mice. Discard any unused cells.",
    "Leaving the catheter-syringe assembly in place, allow the cells to dwell in the bladder for 50 min.\nGently withdraw the catheter-syringe assembly from the urethra. Turn the isoflurane concentration to zero and move each mouse an inch or two away from the nosecone to recover on the heating pad.\nWhen a mouse has regained its righting reflex, return it to its cage.\n2. Intravesical Delivery of Adenovirus (8 Days after Implantation of Cells)\nCAUTION: This part of the protocol uses adenovirus, which is an infectious agent and should be handled under strict BSL2 guidelines (http://oma.od.nih.gov/manualchapters/intramural/3035/).\nAll procedures performed with infectious agents were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the Medical University of South Carolina.\nEight days after implanting mice with MB49 cells, check for hematuria. Pick up individual animals over a white piece of absorbent paper and gently press on the abdomen to blot drops of urine onto the paper. Urine that is pink to red indicates hematuria and is a sign that tumors have established. Tumor take rate is at least 80% and with excellent technique can be as high as 100%.\nThaw adenoviral stock on ice and dilute to 109 PFU/50 μl (2 x 1010 PFU/ml) in sterile, room temperature PBS.\nAnesthetize mice as described in steps 1.3-1.6 above.\nCatheterize mice as described in steps 1.8 and remove urine as in step 1.9\nAfter urine is removed, immediately pipette 50 μl of virus suspension into the hub of the catheter. Attach the 1 ml air-filled syringe to the hub of the catheter and deliver the virus to the bladder by slowly depressing the plunger 0.1-0.2 ml.\nLeaving the catheter-syringe assembly in place, allow the virus to dwell in the bladder for 40 min.",
    "Gently withdraw the catheter-syringe assembly from the urethra, and discard into 10% bleach solution to inactivate any remaining virus.\nTurn the isoflurane concentration to zero and move each mouse an inch or two away from the nosecone to recover on the heating pad.\nWhen a mouse has regained its righting reflex, return it to its cage.\nMark cages to indicate that mice have been instilled with adenovirus. Virus will be shed into the cage bedding for several days and all cages and bedding must be handled and disinfected appropriately.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
