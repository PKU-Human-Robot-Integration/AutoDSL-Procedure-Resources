These peptides do not represent the active translation machinery and will be discarded in downstream analysis. All media has a base of DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. U87MG cells are cultured and expanded in 15-cm2 plates in light (R0K0) media for 7 d prior to the start of drug treatment. Two 15-cm2 plates each containing approximately 10 million cells (roughly 85% confluent) are used for each condition/replicate. Cells are treated for a total of 24 h with either 6.25 nM silvestrol or 1:1000 DMSO (vehicle). Our analysis was optimized for the conditions described. Shorter treatment durations and other experimental design changes would require optimization of SILAC conditions.\nTreat cells with drug or vehicle resuspended in light (R0K0) SILAC media for 20 h.\nNote: We used the SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit (Trypsin), DMEM from Thermo Scientific. See manufacturer’s manual (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0016245_2161996_PierceSILAC_Pr..._Kits_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0016245_2161996_PierceSILAC_Pr..._Kits_UG.pdf]) for more information about the SILAC media.\nNote: Resuspend silvestrol or vehicle, same concentrations as above, in heavy (R10K8) media for step 3 and warm to 37°C just prior to the media exchange.\nWash cells once with warm (37°C) PBS.\nPulse cells with heavy (R10K8) SILAC media containing drug for last 4 h.\nAspirate PBS, add prewarmed drug-containing (or vehicle) heavy (R10K8) SILAC media to corresponding plates.\nIncubate at 37°C for remaining 4 h.\nCritical: Due to physiologic responses to changes in temperature, it is imperative that media and PBS is prewarmed and that steps 2 and 3 are performed quickly to minimize temperature disturbances.\nRibosome density profiling (fractionation) – Day 0\nTiming: 5–6 h",
    "Ribosome density fractionation enables the separation of mRNAs based on the number of ribosomes bound to a transcript. A transcript with no ribosomes or subunits bound will shift to the top of the sucrose gradient upon centrifugation, while a transcript undergoing active translation, with multiple ribosomes bound, will shift to the bottom of the gradient. The following procedure is necessary to differentiate proteins in the sample lysate based on their engagement with translation.\nNote: Prepare polysome lysis buffer fresh the day of harvest. Samples should be kept at 4°C throughout.\nTreat cells with CHX and harvest.\nTreat cells with 100 μg/mL CHX for 10 min at 37°C.\nWash cells two times with cold PBS containing CHX (100 μg/mL) and aspirate.\nAdd 5 mL cold PBS containing CHX to each 15-cm plate. Harvest cells by scraping and combine the two 15-cm2 plates into a single 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge cells 100 × g for 5 min.\nLyse cell pellets.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 500 μL polysome lysis buffer and transfer to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRotate tubes at 4°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge tubes at 10,000 × g for 10 min, 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant to a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min, 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant to a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and label. Keep samples on ice.\nCritical: Lysates should be centrifuged twice as described above. Membranous debris is inevitably included in the lysate after only one centrifugation.\nQuantify estimated RNA and calculate volumes for equal RNA across samples.\nApproximate RNA concentration of sample lysates by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.\nCalculate volumes needed for equal amounts of RNA amongst samples. See note below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2255_5.csv",
    "Note: A260 measurement in these lysates represents RNA in addition to free ATP, GTP, dNTPs, and DNA. Because these non-RNA components will be discarded through downstream processing, we use A260 as an approximate measurement of RNA concentration in these samples.\nNote: Lysate RNA concentrations for two 15-cm2 plates normally range from 1–2 μg/μL. We calculate total RNA for 500 μL of the sample with lowest RNA concentration. Divide this total RNA value by other sample concentrations to obtain the loading volume of lysate needed for that sample. An example is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] below. Sample A has the lowest RNA concentration. We calculate the total RNA in 500 μL of sample A (555,000 μg). This sets the upper limit of loading volume to 500 μL. We then determine the loading volumes for samples B, C, and D by dividing the calculated total RNA by their RNA concentrations.\nLoad sucrose gradients and balance rotor buckets.\nPlace a rotor bucket into a rack and place on a scale. Include the cap, unattached.\nCarefully place the sucrose gradient centrifuge tube into the rotor bucket.\nLoad each gradient with sample lysate by placing pipette tip on inside wall of tube and gently dispensing.\nBalance corresponding rotor buckets by adding polysome lysis buffer as needed.\nScrew on bucket cap and keep buckets on ice.\nCritical: Corresponding rotor buckets should be balanced within 100 mg (total weight of rotor bucket, sucrose gradient and sample) of each other prior to ultracentrifugation to avoid machine errors.\nOptional: Pre-chill ultracentrifuge to 4°C.\nUltracentrifuge gradients.\nFor an SW-41 Ti rotor and Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge: centrifuge at 39,000 rpm (187,813 × g) for 1.5 h at 4°C.\nSet max acceleration and slow deceleration.\nCarefully transfer rotor buckets with sample from centrifuge and keep on ice.",
    "Critical: Slow deceleration is necessary to avoid disrupting polysome sedimentation.\nCritical: Keep centrifuge tubes in rotor buckets and store on ice until they are fractionated. Avoid disturbing the samples.\nNote: We use the Brandel BR-188 Density Gradient Fractionation System integrated with Peak Chart software (v 2.08, Brandel, see http://www.brandel.com/fractgradient.html[href=http://www.brandel.com/fractgradient.html] for more details). This system enables us to analyze the sample from top to bottom as sample is passed through an absorbance detector with 254 nm filters generating a continuous profile. We use a chase solution of 60% sucrose (w/v) containing bromophenol blue. A solution with a density greater than 50% sucrose is needed to push the sample from the bottom upward. Bromophenol blue is used to distinguish chase solution from the sample. The Brandel system includes an integrated syringe pump that provides a constant flow rate. Fractionation occurred at a rate of 1.5 mL/min with each fraction containing 1 mL sample.\nUsing a density gradient fractionation system, fractionate and collect the samples into 1 mL fractions in 2-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nLoad syringe pump with chase solution and connect tubing.\nConnect syringe pump tubing to needle.\nRemove all air bubbles in tubing by running syringe pump forward.\nLoad the sample centrifuge tube into place.\nCarefully transfer sample tubes from centrifuge buckets and load into place.\nPuncture bottom of tube with needle.\nSet syringe pump to ‘computer control’ and set rate to 1.5 mL/min.\nClick ‘run’ in the software and collect 11 sample fractions.\nCombine fractions into 4 pooled groups based on the absorbance profile: free, monosome, oligosome, and polysome, and label tubes. Downstream sample processing occurs on the set of combined fractions.\nNote: We used PEAKS software (Brandel) to record polysome profiles at absorbance 254 nm.",
    "Note: A small volume of fractions (approx. 200 μL) can be stored separately and used for downstream confirmation. Protein can be extracted from these samples and run-on western blot to confirm results of mass spectrometry.\nPause point: Ribosome fractions can be stored at −80°C.\nProtein isolation and preparation for MS – Day 1\nTiming: 48 h\nIn this step, proteins that have been separated into pooled fractions are isolated from the rest of the lysate/sucrose sample using TCA precipitation. Sample preparation for mass spectrometry includes reduction, alkylation, digestion, TMT-labeling, and fractionation of the isolated protein. TMT-labeling enables multiplexing of all sample fractions (DMSO and Silvestrol: ribosome-free, monosome, oligosome, polysome) into a single experimental run and facilitates peptide quantification.\nIsolate total protein using TCA precipitation.\nTo each 1 mL fraction add 250 μL TCA (20% final TCA concentration). Vortex and keep at 4°C for 1 h. Centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min, 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant.\nWash protein precipitate with ice-cold acetone two times and aspirate.\nCritical: TCA is corrosive and should be handled with caution including the use of personal protective equipment. Additionally, acetone is flammable and toxic and should be used cautiously.\nNote: We normally obtain roughly 10 mg of total protein (across all fractions) per sample.\nResuspend samples in 100 μL of reduction buffer and incubate at 65°C for 20 min.\nNote: Allow samples to return to 22°C–25°C before proceeding to the next step.\nTo each sample, add 11 μL of 200 mM iodoacetamide (final concentration of 20 mM).\nIncubate samples in the dark at 20°C–22°C for 20 min.\nAdd 450 μL acetone to each sample, vortex, and precipitate proteins at −20°C for 16 h.\nCentrifuge samples at 23,000 × g for 15 min.\nCritical: Acetone is flammable and toxic and should be used cautiously.",
    "Pause point: Protein precipitates can be stored at −80°C.\nResuspend protein precipitates in 50 μL of NH4HCO3 (pH 8.3). Add 1 μL of MS grade Trypsin/LysC (final protease:protein ratio 1:50). Digest for 3 h at 37°C.\nDry samples using a vacuum concentrator. We use the Savant SPD2010 SpeedVac concentrator (more information can be found on the manufacturer’s website: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/SPD2030-220?SID=srch-srp-SPD2030-220[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/SPD2030-220?SID=srch-srp-SPD2030-220]).\nSpeedvac samples under ‘manual run’ and check on samples every half hour (may take 1–2 h).\nResuspend peptides in 0.1% TFA and desalt using standard C18/Ziptip cleanup.\nDry samples using a vacuum concentrator and perform TMT labeling. We use the TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set (Thermo Fisher) and follow the protocol according to the manufacturer’s instruction: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0016969_2162457_TMT10plex_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0016969_2162457_TMT10plex_UG.pdf].\nCombine labeled peptides from all samples and dry using a vacuum concentrator.\nResuspend combined peptides in 20 μL ddH2O.\nFractionate combined peptides using high pH reversed phase chromatography.\nLoad samples on a C18 column (XBridge Peptide BEH C18 column, 300 Å, 5 μM, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) and elute with a 65 min gradient at a rate of 500 μL/min using Buffers A and B as following:\n0–46 min, 4%-33 B.\n46–55 min, 70% B.\n55–55.1 min, 98% B.\n55.1–50 min, 98 B.\n60–60.1 min, 3% B.\n60.1–65 min, 4% B.\nBegin fractionation after 2 min.\nCollect each fraction for 1.3 min (78 s) and collect a total of 44 fractions.\nDry fractions with a vacuum concentrator.\nNote: Fractionation begins after 2 min to avoid salt plug.\nPause point: Fractions can be stored at −20°C.\nLC–MS/MS analysis– day 3+\nTiming: 10–12 h\nIn this step, the combined and fractionated peptides are identified and quantified using LC–MS/MS. TMT-labeling enables peptide quantification and original sample identification (drug treatment, ribosome fraction).\nSample mass spectrometry",
    "Resuspend sample peptide fractions in 0.1% formic acid, and load onto a 96-well plate for injection into the mass spectrometer (see note).\nLoad peptide mixtures into trap column at a constant flow rate of 30 μL/min.\nElute peptides over the course of a 60 min gradient (see note).\nNote: Instrument used in our study: Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion-Lumos Tribid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) outfitted with a nanospray source and Dionix Ultimate 1000 nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA).\nAlternatives: This can work with any LC/MS setup and would work well any modern mass spectrometer such as the Orbitrap or the timsTOF series of instruments. If using other instruments, parameters simply need to be changed to tailor that instrument.\nNote: Peptide mixtures were loaded into a PEPMAP100 C18 5 μM trap column (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA). Peptides were eluted and focused using a PEPMAP C18 2 μM 15 cm column (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA).\nNote: 60 min gradient. 0–48 min :4%–35% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid; 48–55 min of 90% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid for column cleaning, 55–60 min of 4% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid for column equilibration. Peptides were introduced by nano-electrospray into the mass spectrometer.\nData acquisition.\nAcquire data using the MultiNotch MS3 acquisition with synchronous precursor selection (SPS) with a cycle time of 2 s.\nPerform MS1 acquisition (scan range of 550 m/z - 1,800 m/z with resolution set to 120 000, maximum injection time of 50 ms, and AGC target set to 4e5).\nPerform isolation for MS2 scans in the quadrupole, with an isolation window of 0.7 (conduct MS2 scans in the linear ion trap with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and a normalized collision energy of 35%).",
    "For MS3 scans, use higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 65% and measure scans in the orbitrap with a resolution of 50 000, a scan range of 100 m/z - 300 m/z, an AGC Target of 1e5, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was applied using an exclusion list of one repeat count with an exclusion duration of 30 s.\nSample mass spectrometry data analysis\nProcess MS raw files using PEAKS X+ (v10.5, Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.).\nAlternatives: Any MS search software that allows for quantification should be able to search the dataset – including but not limited to PEAKS, MS Fragger,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] MaxQuant,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher), and Comet Search.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nNote: The data was searched against the Human Uniprot database consisting of reviewed canonical and isoform sequences (total entry 42339). Parent mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm, with fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Semi-specific tryptic cleavage was selected with allows for a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Fixed modifications of TMT (229.162932 Da) on lysine and peptide N-terminal cysteine residues were specified. Carbidomethylation of cysteine (+57.02 Da) residues was selected as a fixed modification, while variable modifications included 13C6-15N2 SILAC on K (8.014199 Da), 13C6-15N4 SILAC on R (10.008269 Da), Oxidation of M (15.99 Da), and modifications of deamidation (0.98 Da) on asparagine and glutamine. TMT quantification was also performed using the PEAKS X+ quantification module, allowing a mass tolerance of 20 ppm and quantifying all peptides that pass a 1% FDR threshold."
