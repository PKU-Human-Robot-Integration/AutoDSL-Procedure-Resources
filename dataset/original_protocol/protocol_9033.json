  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation of the Injection Mixture\nUse vivo morpholinos as cells internalize them more efficiently than normal morpholino molecules. See the manufacturer's information for details (Table 1: Reagents and Materials).\nUse a fluorescent tracking dye (e.g. CellTracker Red CMTPX, Invitrogen) to visualize the accuracy of the injection. This dye is metabolized in the cell and becomes fluorescent only in the cell after the uptake. Therefore, this step is crucial to determine the cells that are efficiently targeted by the cerebroventricular microinjection.\nPrepare phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH: 7.4) for diluting morpholino solution. If a dilution of the morpholino solution is required, always use PBS.\nPrepare 10 μl of the injection mix by adding 9 μl of the morpholino solution and 1 μl of the cell tracker dye (diluted or undiluted. The stock concentration of the morpholino solution is 500 μM. Our previous results 22 indicate that several different doses of the morpholino - ranging from 50 μM to 500 μM - result in different levels of knockdown from an efficient knockdown to hypomorphic phenotypes). 1 μl of solution is enough for injection into one zebrafish brain.\nMix well and store at room temperature until the injection.\n2. Preparation of the Injection Apparatus\nPrepare the glass injection capillaries using a needle puller. Use the following parameters: Heating cycle value: 463, pulling cycle value: 230, velocity: 1.5 sec, time: 75 msec.\nTurn on the pressure source and adjust the pressure settings to 50 psi or 3.5 bars.\nAdjust the microinjector settings as follows: hold pressure 20 psi, eject pressure 10 psi, period value of 2.5 and 100 msec range of gating.\nTurn on the ring illuminator and locate the ring over the microscope stage.",
    "Place the capillary holder to an appropriate position next to the microscope.\nInsert the glass capillary into the holder. Adjust the injection angle to 45 degrees.\nSnap off the tip of the glass capillary using a fine-end forceps and calibrate the pressure output from the orifice. This must be tested by immersing the tip of the needle into the fish water and giving a continuous pressure pulse. The air bubbles arising should be only one row, which is an indication of optimum pressure/orifice size. Please see the video for demonstration of this calibration.\nLoad the glass capillary with the injection solution without trapping air bubbles.\nApply pressure to remove the air between the tip of the glass capillary and the loaded injection solution.\n3. Anesthesia\nPrepare the stock solution of the anesthetics (0.1% MESAB - ethyl-m-aminobenzoate methanesulphonate).\nRemove desired number of fish from their tanks into plastic mouse cages or other transport container with enough amount of water.\nPrepare the anaesthetization solution in a small plastic box by mixing 200 ml of fish water with 5 ml of anesthetics stock solution. Final concentration of the anesthetics: 0.0025% (v/v).\nHalf-fill a plastic Petri dish with anesthetics. Use this dish for injections.\nIncubate the fish in the anesthetics until the fish subdues.\n4. Incision and Cerebroventricular Microinjection\nRemove the fish from the box using a fish net and place it into the Petri dish.\nGently hold the fish with the forceps and orient the head in a way that it tilts slightly downwards. This will facilitate the incision.\nGenerate a small slit on the skull using a 30 gauge barbed-end needle. Use only the tip of the needle and do not penetrate more than enough into the brain as this will cause damage to the brain tissue and will manifest as bleeding.",
    "Keep holding the fish and insert the tip of the glass capillary through the incision site.\nOrient the tip of the glass capillary towards the telencephalon. Avoid touching the brain tissue as this creates tissue damage and also prevents dispersion of the injected solution.\nInject the solution. The liquid disperses immediately after injection.\n5. Recovery and Analyzing the Injection Accuracy\nRemove the fish from the injection setup and place into a plastic box with fresh fish water.\nAllow recovery.\nRe-anaesthetize the fish with 0.0025% MESAB briefly and check the fish under the fluorescence microscope. A thorough dispersion of red fluorescence is an indication of widespread distribution of the injected liquid.\nPut the fish back to the plastic box.\nConnect the plastic box to the circulation system to oxygenate the fish and maintain for longer periods of time.\nUse the fish for desired purposes such as behavioral analyses or sacrifice the animals at desired time points after the injection to prepare tissue specimens for further analyses (histological stainings, immunohistochemistry, etc.). The following references give examples of how to analyze the adult zebrafish brain: 9,11,17-20,24-27. The quickest time to observe an efficient knockdown (more than 50% knockdown) was 12 hr in our studies 22.\n6. Suggested Scientific Controls\nUse a mismatch morpholino molecule that is not supposed to cause any phenotype as a negative control. Use either a standard morpholino molecule or specifically design morpholino controls for every gene of interest. Additionally, use the solvent (in this case PBS) as a further negative control to assess the non-specific effects or toxicity of the mismatch/control morpholino injections.\nUse PCNA morpholinos described previously 22 as positive controls. This morpholino causes efficient knockdown in the adult zebrafish brain (75-95% knockdown efficiency within 1 day of injection) 22."
