    "1. Analysis of TGF-β-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation using Western blotting\nNOTE: Premalignant human breast MCF10A-Ras cells were used as an example to investigate TGF-β signaling responses33. In principle, the methods described below are also applicable to other TGF-β-responsive cell lines.\nCulture the breast epithelial cell line MCF10A-Ras at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 containing L-glutamine with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 mg/mL insulin, 100 ng/mL cholera enterotoxin, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, and 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep).\nTrypsinize MCF10A-Ras cells with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 1 minute and count viable cells using a cell counter.\nSeed cells into 6-well plates at a density of 5×105 cells/well.\nAfter overnight growth, treat cells with either TGF-β (5 ng/mL) or ligand buffer (4 mM HCl, 0.1% fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 hour, and then remove culture medium and gently wash the cells twice with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCool cells in 6-well plates on ice and add 150 µL of precooled radio immune precipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and freshly added mini protease inhibitor cocktail). Allow the lysis to proceed on ice for 10 minutes.\nScrape adherent cells off the dish using a plastic cell scraper, then gently transfer the cell suspension into a precooled microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate for 10 minutes at 150 centrifugal force (x g) at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nMeasure the protein concentration using a detergent compatible (DC) protein assay kit.\nLoad 30 µg of protein from each sample onto a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and run the gel at a voltage of 100 V for 1.5-2 hours.",
    "Transfer the proteins from the gel to a 45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at a voltage of 110 V for 1-1.5 hours.\nTransfer the PVDF membrane into an appropriate container with the protein side (the side that was facing the gel) up, and briefly rinse the membrane in distilled water.\nDiscard the water, add Ponceau S solution, and put the membrane on a rocking platform for 1-2 minutes.\nDe-stain the membrane with distilled water by quickly rinsing it and then washing it for 1 minute.\nThen, put the PVDF membrane on a light box, and take a picture to check for equal total protein loadings.\nWash the membrane with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) until there is no visible staining.\nPut the membrane in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBST solution) and incubate it for 1 hour at room temperature.\nWash the membrane twice with TBST.\nIncubate the membrane with primary antibodies against phospho-SMAD2 (p-SMAD2; 1:1000, home-made 34), total SMAD2/3 1:1000 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:1000), overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the membrane twice with TBST and incubate the membrane with a secondary antibody against rabbit or mouse (1:5000) for 2 hours.\nIncubate the PVDF membrane with Western ECL substrate for 30 seconds, and detect the signal using an imaging system.\nRepeat the experiments at least three times to obtain biological triplicates.\n2. Analysis of TGF-β-induced SMAD3-dependent transcriptional responses\nPerform the SMAD3/SMAD4-dependent CAGA12-luciferase transcriptional reporter assay.\n\t\nCulture and trypsinize MCF10A-Ras cells as described in Step 1. Seed cells into 24-well plates at 5×104 cells/well and allow the cells to adhere overnight.",
    "The day after seeding, cotransfect the cells in each well with 100 ng of the TGF-β/SMAD3-inducible (CAGA)12 luciferase transcriptional reporter construct35 and 80 ng of the β-galactosidase expression construct using polyethylenimine (PEI). The transfection of β-galactosidase is used to normalize differences in transfection efficiency between different wells. Set up every experimental group in triplicate.\nAfter 24 hours of incubation, starve cells with serum-free DMEM-high glucose and, 6 hours later, add TGF-β (5 ng/mL) or ligand buffer (4 mM HCl, 0.1% BSA) as a vehicle control to the cells.\nAfter another 24 hours of incubation, wash cells twice with prewarmed PBS.\nAdd 120 µL/well 1× lysis buffer and gently shake the plate at 4 °C for 20 minutes.\nTransfer 30 µL of lysate to each well of a 96-well white assay microplate to measure luciferase activity using a luminometer.\nTransfer 50 µL of lysate to each well of a 96-well transparent plate to measure β-galactosidase activity.\nNormalize the luciferase activity to the β-galactosidase activity and repeat the experiments at least three times to obtain biological triplicates.\nAnalyze the expression of TGF-β target genes using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\n\t\nCulture and trypsinize MCF10A-Ras cells as described in Step 1. Seed cells into 6-well plates at 5×105 cells/well and allow the cells to adhere overnight.\nTreat cells with TGF-β (5 ng/mL) or ligand buffer (4 mM HCl, 0.1% BSA) for 6 hours, and then wash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nIsolate total RNA using an RNA isolation kit.\nDetermine the RNA concentration with a NanoDrop and perform cDNA synthesis with 1 µg of RNA using a first strand cDNA synthesis Kit.",
    "Use a real-time-PCR detection system to perform quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) with ten-fold diluted cDNA in a 10 µL reaction mixture that includes specific human forward and reverse primers for GAPDH (for normalization), SERPINE1 (encoding the PAI-1 protein, a TGF-β/SMAD target gene), SMAD7 (TGF-β/SMAD target gene) and qPCR Master Mix. Set up every experimental group in triplicate.\n\t\tNOTE: The primer sequences used to detect target human genes in qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1.\nUse the following qPCR reaction conditions: initialization, 95 °C for 3 minutes; denaturation, 95 °C for 10 seconds; annealing, 60 °C for 30 seconds; and extension, 80 °C for 10 seconds; denaturation, annealing and extension are repeated 40 times.\nRepeat the experiments at least three times to obtain biological triplicates.\n3. Analysis of TGF-β-induced EMT\nAnalyze the expression of EMT markers at the protein level using Western blotting.\n\tNOTE: The analysis of TGF-β-induced EMT is shown using mouse NMuMG epithelial cells as an example36,37.\n\t\nCulture NMuMG cells at 37 °C in DMEM-high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1:100 Pen-Strep. Use methods described in Step 1 for protein isolation and detection.\n\t\tNOTE: The following antibodies are used in this experiment: E-cadherin, 1:1000; N-cadherin, 1:1000; Snail, 1:1000; Slug, 1:1000; Tubulin, 1:1000 (Figure 3).\nAnalyze the expression of EMT markers at the mRNA level using quantitative real-time-PCR as described in Step 2.2.\n\tNOTE: All mouse primers used for qRT-PCR, including CDH1 (encoding the E-cadherin protein), SNAIL, and ZEB2 (Figure 3) are listed in Table 1.\nAnalyze the EMT process using indirect immunofluorescence and direct fluorescence staining.\n\t\nIndirect immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin\n\t\t\nPlace sterile 18 mm-side square glass coverslips in 6-well plates (one coverslip per well).\nSeed 1×105 NMuMG cells with 2 mL of complete DMEM per 6-well plate and allow the cells to adhere overnight.",
    "Gently move the coverslips with adherent cells to a new 6-well plate and add 2 mL of culture medium to the wells.\nTreat the cells with TGF-β (5 ng/mL) or ligand buffer (4 mM HCl, 0.1% BSA) for 2 days.\nRemove the culture medium and gently wash the cells twice with 1 mL of prewarmed PBS.\nFix the cells by adding 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde and incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, gently wash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nPermeabilize the fixed cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature and wash the cells twice with PBS.\nBlock the cells with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature and wash the cells twice with PBS.\nAdd the primary antibody against E-cadherin (diluted 1:1000 in PBS) to the top of each coverslip and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.\nRemove the primary antibody and wash the coverslip with PBS three times.\nAdd the Alexa Fluor 555 secondary antibody (diluted 1:500 in PBS) to the top of each coverslip and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature while covering with aluminum foil to protect from light.\nRemove the secondary antibody and wash the coverslip with PBS three times.\nMount the coverslip (cells facing downward) onto glass slides using mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and store the mounted slides in a box at 4 °C, protected from light.\nObserve staining with SP8 confocal microscopy.\nDirect fluorescence staining of filamentous (F)-actin.\n\t\t\nPrepare samples following steps 3.3.1.1. to 3.3.1.9.\nStain the cells by adding Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (1:1000) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin).\nWash cells three times with PBS.",
