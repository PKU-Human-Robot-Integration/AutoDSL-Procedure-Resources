    "Prepare a working cell stock Yeast cells taken from a freshly steaked MP+ growth plate (see Recipes) are grown in a culture tube (see Materials and Reagents) containing 5 ml MP+ broth (see Recipes) at 30 °C overnight in a rotator at 100 rpm until a turbid culture is obtained. The minimal medium described in this protocol is designed for the W303 strain. Proline is added as a poor N source in order to induce the synthesis of the peptide uptake system of S. cerevisiae. Other minimal media can be used for strains of S. cerevisiae with different auxotrophic requirements.The overnight culture is harvested by low-speed centrifugation in the table top centrifuge (1,000 x g) for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times with 5.0 ml of sterile, distilled water under the same centrifugation conditions to remove the culture medium. Adjusting the cell number The cell pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml of water, and the suspended cells are counted on a hemocytometer. Based on the hemocytometer results a cell suspension is prepared at a final concentration of 5 x 106 cells/ml in water. 1 ml of cells will be needed for each test plate.Pouring the top agar 1 ml of the 5 x 106 cells/ml suspension is added to a tube of molten top agar (3.0 ml Noble agar blank) previously equilibrated to 55 °C, for a top-agar overlay. After briefly mixing with a vortex, the cell/top agar mixture is immediately poured onto a Petri plate containing 25 ml of MP+ growth plate (see Recipes). The top agar is poured quickly and the plate is gently swirled to ensure that the top agar mixture is evenly spread across the surface of the plate.Notes: 1.1% Noble agar will solidify quickly at room temperature.",
    "The culture tubes holding the Noble agar need to be placed in a boiling water bath to melt the agar, then placed in a 55 °C water bath or dry block to maintain in the liquid state.Pouring top agar onto the MP+ growth plate should be done as quickly as possible to prevent the Noble agar mixture from solidifying before spreading. Pre-warming the MP+ growth plate in a 30 °C incubator is helpful while developing the skills for a successful pour. It is very important to spread the top agar evenly on the surface of the MP+ growth plate to generate a uniform lawn. If a bubble forms after pouring, it can be popped by touching it with a sterile pipette tip. No Bunsen burner or hood is needed if poured carefully.Loading toxic peptidesSterile paper disks are placed into a clean, sterile Petri plate. Serial dilutions of the peptide to be tested are prepared and 10 µl of each solution is placed onto a sterile paper disk. For statistical accuracy, this should be done in triplicate. Once the peptide solution has been absorbed into the disk, sterile filter forceps are used to transfer the disk onto the top agar lawn; one disk should be placed in the center of the plate, with the others spaced evenly around the edge (Figure 1A). Different amounts of the toxic peptide will result in a zone of growth arrest or ‘halo’ around the disk. The diameter of the halo is proportional to the amount of toxic compound added. Notes: Since the surface of the plate is moist, gently placing the disk with forceps onto the surface of the top agar is sufficient for it to adhere to the plate.",
    "Pressing the disk onto the top agar should be avoided as it may deform the surface of the top agar.The toxic peptide on the disk will diffuse from the disk through the top agar lawn of cells. The development of the halo is dependent on the concentration of the toxic peptide surrounding the disk. It is essential that the toxic peptide is absorbed uniformly into the disk to ensure that the resulting halo is symmetric. To ensure this, slowly add the solution of the toxic peptide to the center of the paper disk. Different toxic substrates may diffuse to different extents in the agar. The amount of toxic substrate added to a disk must be adjusted for that specific substrate.IncubationOnce the disks have been placed on the top agar lawn, place the plate upside down in a 30 °C incubator for 1-2 days. Plates are incubated in this inverted position to prevent condensation onto the lawn and disks, which will disrupt the halo assay."
