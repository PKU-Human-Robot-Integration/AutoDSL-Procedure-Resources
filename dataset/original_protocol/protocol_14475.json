    "Experimental procedures were approved by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in compliance with the NIH Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n1. Preparing for Telemetry Device Implant Surgery\nPut on personal protective equipment (i.e., scrubs, shoe covers, gown, hair net, mask, and surgical gloves).\n\tNOTE: This surgery requires a sterile field.\nTurn on the incubator (servo-controlled humidifier/infant incubator set to 29 ​°C) and line it with dry, white towels to allow proper warming for recovery.\nPrior to surgery, sterilize all surgical instruments with ethylene oxide and sterilize the transmitter with an enzymatic detergent and chemical sterilant (or as specified by the manufacturer) before use.\n\tNOTE: Surgical instruments should include #2 laminectomy forceps (standard tips/straight/12 cm) (x4), narrow pattern forceps (serrated/curved/12 cm), tissue-separating scissors (straight/blunt-blunt/11.5 cm), and a scalpel holder and blade. It is recommended to have a separate set of sterilized instruments (two #2 forceps and scissors) reserved exclusively for handling the wires of the transmitter to keep the surgical tools in good condition.\nSterilize all surfaces within the surgical field with an acceptable disinfectant. Position a stereo dissection microscope, isoflurane anesthetic machine, surgical tools, and clippers in the surgical field (see the Table of Materials).\nTo maintain the mouse body temperature while under anesthesia, place a heating pad or water blanket under the sterile towel in front of the stereo dissection microscope.\nEnsure that the transmitter is fully functional prior to use.",
    "NOTE: A small magnet placed within 2 in of the transmitter will turn the device on and off. When the transmitter is on and held close to a radio set at 500 Hz AM frequency, it will emit a continuous, high-pitched buzzing noise. To save battery life, turn the battery off before implanting it in the animal.\nPrepare the electrode leads prior to surgery by trimming the distal leads with the scissors reserved for handling wires so that there is approximately 3 cm of lead (enough to reach the target muscle) (Figure 1A). Alternatively, coil the wires proximal to the device and tie them together with sutures so that there is approximately 3 cm of uncoiled lead.\n\tNOTE: Save the trimmed-off portion of the electrode leads in order to prepare \"lead caps\" (plastic insulated casing), as described in step 1.9. In step 3, the transmitter leads will be inserted through the muscle, so and the distal, exposed part of the wires must be held in place and insulated using lead caps.\nUse a scalpel to trim off 0.5 cm of the plastic covering without cutting the wire itself. Use the tools reserved for wire handling to stretch the ends of the leads 4 - 5x their original length so that they fit easily inside a 25-gauge needle (Figure 1B-B''). Trim the exposed wire of the leads so that they are 0.5 cm in length.\nPrepare lead caps (plastic tubes to cover the wire ends) prior to surgery. Use a scalpel to trim off 0.25 cm-long tubes from the plastic casing surrounding the segments of electrode leads saved from step 1.7.",
    "NOTE: Four lead caps are required for each mouse that will undergo implantation, but it is best to prepare twice the required amount of caps. Having additional sterile prepared lead caps is helpful in case securing a lead cap is unsuccessful on the first attempt.\nRecord the serial number of the inserted transmitter and save the original packaging with the calibrated information. Each transmitter has different frequency calibrations for the EMG recording; enter these into the acquisition software to obtain acceptable EMG recordings.\n2. Preparing the Mouse for Surgery\nChoose the desired mouse for implantation (i.e., SOD1(G93A) or control) and weigh the animal.\n\tNOTE: The recommended age and weight for a mouse (male or female) undergoing this surgery is P56 - P120 and ≥ 24 g, respectively.\nAnesthetize the mouse under 3.5% isoflurane with a 2 L/min oxygen flow rate. Perform a toe pinch and a tail pinch to make sure that the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nOnce anesthetized, remove the mouse from the drop box and maintain anesthesia via a nose cone by setting the isoflurane level to 1.5% and the oxygen flow rate to 1 L/min. Perform a toe pinch and/or tail pinch to make sure that the anesthesia is maintained.\nApply lubricant ophthalmic ointment to prevent the eyes from drying out during surgery.\nShave the mouse to expose a surgical site between the ear and shoulder (Figure 1C).\nClip the toenails ipsilateral to the surgical site to reduce the chance of the mouse pulling out the leads or causing wounds by scratching during the healing process.\nAlternate swabbing the surgical site, first with disinfectant and then with isopropanol. Repeat 2 more times.\n3. Implanting the Telemetry Device to Record Scalene and Trapezius EMG Activity",
    "Place the animal underneath a dissection microscope, on its side on top of a sterile pad covering a heating pad, and secure the nose cone in place with tape. Note that it is best to implant the right side to reduce ECG signal originating from the heart.\n\tNOTE: Monitor breathing and adjust the isoflurane levels, if necessary, to maintain a regular respiration rate and appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia.\nPull the forelimb toward the ipsilateral foot along the torso.\n\tNOTE: This position displaces the scapula caudally, providing surgical access to the scalene and trapezius muscles.\n\t\nTake the blunt curved forceps, hold back the front paw ipsilateral to the surgical site, and tape the paw in place (Figure 1C). Use strong adhesive surgical tape to make sure that the paw is secure for the duration of the procedure.\nPut on a fresh pair of surgical gloves. Use the scalpel to make an oblique incision, approximately 2 cm-long, between the shoulder and the ear (red line in Figure 1C).\nUsing two #2 laminectomy forceps, one in each hand, pull back the fat pad and spread apart the trapezius and platysma muscles to expose the fascia covering the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles (Figure 1D and E).\nUse the pale sternocleidomastoid muscle and phrenic nerve as landmarks to identify the scalene muscles. Note that the phrenic nerve runs parallel to the scalene muscles, while the sternocleidomastoid lies inferior. The scalene muscles run obliquely from the cervical vertebrae to the ribs under the trapezius muscle. Biopotential leads will be inserted into the anterior scalene muscle, which can be identified as the muscle that runs adjacent to the phrenic nerve (Figure 1F and G).",
    "NOTE: Caution. This area is highly vascularized, and care must be taken to avoid cutting the subclavian artery. Avoid damaging the phrenic nerve and brachial plexus.\nOnce the scalene and trapezius muscles have been identified (Figure 1G), make a subcutaneous pocket for the transmitter on the back of the animal, between the scapulas.\n\t\nUse the tissue-separating scissors, insert the blunt tips of the scissors just beneath the skin and spread them until a pocket opening that is about 1.25x the width of the transmitter is formed (Figure 1H).\n\t\tNOTE: The transmitter should be inserted with minimal resistance, but the pocket should not be so big that the transmitter can move on its own. If the pocket is too small, the transmitter could rub against the skin, causing irritation that may prompt the animal to scratch the skin and/or pull the leads out. If the pocket is too large, seromas could form, or the transmitter could migrate to an unfavorable position.\nFlush with warm, sterile saline and insert the transmitter with the flatter side against the muscle. Position the transmitter so that it lies flat and the wires emerge from the pocket, parallel to each other rather than twisted (Figure 1I). Curl any excess length of wire under the device and lay it flat.\nRun the leads from the transmitter to the scalene and trapezius muscles so that the two sets of bipotential leads lie flat and parallel to each other.\nUse the laminectomy forceps to separate the anterior scalene from the surrounding muscles and insert a 25-gauge needle through the scalene muscle, perpendicular to the muscle fibers.",
    "Insert one lead into the tip of the needle and then pull the needle out of the muscle, leaving behind the lead inserted into the muscle up to the insulation of the wire (Figure 1J and K). Record which colored leads are inserted into which muscle.\nPlace a small drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive onto the exposed end of the wire, close to the muscle where the lead is inserted, and quickly slide the lead cap over the wire so that no wire is exposed between the lead cap and the muscle (Figure 2A and B).\n\tNOTE: Although it is an accepted practice to secure EMG leads with cyanoacrylate17,18, an alternative method is to secure the lead cap in place by tying a silk suture knot around it.\nTrim the excess wire distal to the cap and apply a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive to the end of the lead cap/wire. Give the glue time to polymerize before releasing (Figure 2C and D).\nFollow the same steps (steps 3.10-3.12) to insert the opposite polarity lead parallel to the first in the same muscle, 1 - 2 mm away from the first lead.\nRepeat steps 3.10 - 3.12 to insert leads into the trapezius muscle, located just anterior to the scalene muscle (Figure 1L and M).\nEnsure that the wire leads are fixed in place and that there is just enough slack in the leads for the animal to perform body movements without pulling on the leads. Ensure that any excess length of lead does not push against the skin, as this could cause irritation that may prompt the animal to scratch or pull the leads out. Reposition the leads, if necessary, to prevent any potential discomfort.",
    "Gently remove the tape holding down the forelimb. Pull the fat pad back over the muscle and use it to cover the inserted leads. Close the incision with cyanoacrylate adhesive by teasing the skin flaps back together so that the incision lines up. Pinch a portion of the skin flaps together with the curved forceps and apply a small line of cyanoacrylate adhesive along this line.\nInject 0.1 mL of carprofen subcutaneously to alleviate post-operative pain while the animal is still under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Continue to administer 0.1 mL of carprofen once a day for 1 - 2 days post-surgery, and then as needed after that.\nRemove the animal from the nosecone and place it in a clean cage in the pre-warmed incubator until the animal is awake and moving around the cage voluntarily. Keep the animal in the incubator for at least 15 min afterward, monitoring its movements and alertness.\n4. Postoperative Care\nHouse animals separately following surgery. Provide healing animals with diet gel and a water bottle.\nMonitor the animal for the first 30 min after surgery. Check on the animal at least every hour for 5 h post-surgery. In the days following surgery, check at least twice daily.\nWatch for necrosis, infection along the incision and within the body cavity containing the implant (i.e., heat, swelling, and redness), and seroma formation.\n\tNOTE: These signs occur within the first week after surgery. A healthy healed animal one month after surgery is shown in Figure 1N. Although EMG recordings can be made immediately after implantation, the animals are given at least one week to heal before recording EMG and plethysmography, as ECG signals can be high immediately after implantation.\n5. Acquiring Simultaneous Electromyography and Plethysmography Signals\nTurn on all acquisition equipment, including bias flow.",
    "NOTE: The flow rate for mice is typically set at 1.0 L/min.\nCalibrate the plethysmography chamber(s) using a flow meter.\n\tNOTE: Periodically check the plethysmography chambers to ensure that the seals are not cracked or broken. Coat the rubber seals with a lubricant such as vacuum grease once a week to maintain their good condition.\nInput transmitter calibration as specified by the manufacturer.\nPlace the mouse in the plethysmography chamber for at least 1 h to acclimate it prior to recording EMG and plethysmography. Using multiple chambers, it is possible to record from one mouse while the next mouse is acclimating in a second chamber. Do not turn on the transmitter during the acclimation period in order to conserve battery power (Figure 1O).\nPrior to recording (but after calibration), turn on the transmitter by placing a strong magnet within 1 in of the implanted animal; a red light on the front of the receiver will indicate when the transmitter is on.\nBegin acquisition using the pulldown menu labeled \"Acquisition\" and choose \"Start Acquisition.\" Although the recording duration may vary by experiment, a typical plethysmography and EMG recording lasts 1 - 3 h.\n\tNOTE: The transmitter has an intrinsic sampling rate of 240 Hz. A faster rate of 500 Hz is set in the software to interpolate between points and to provide a smoother waveform. The low pass filter (that serves as an anti-alias filter) and the high pass filter in the implant specify the 1- to 50-Hz bandwidth for this telemetry device. 60-Hz A/C interference does not contribute to excess noise in the EMG signal because the implants are battery powered and the animal shields the implant and leads from electric fields. Plethysmography, EMG, and video are automatically synchronized in real time via acquisition software.",
    "When acquisition is finished, turn off the transmitter with a magnet and remove the animal from the chamber.\nIf starting another recording, clean the chamber, enter in the new transmitter calibrations from the next animal, and begin the second recording. If finished with acquisition for the day, turn off the transmitter, clean the plethysmography chamber, and turn off all acquisition equipment and the bias flow.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55599/55599fig1.jpg",

Analysis of ARM EMG and Plethysmography\nOpen the analysis software and review the file of interest (go to \"File\" and choose \"Open review file\"). Filter the EMG signals using a 30-Hz high pass filter by right-clicking on the EMG trace, choosing \"Analyze Attributes,\" highlighting the \"Advanced Attributes 1\" tab, and changing the high pass filter to 30 Hz.\n\tNOTE: This filtering step removes non-discriminate, low-frequency information.\nLocate areas of mouse inactivity by visual inspection based on the lack of movement in the synchronized video file and the lack of large, irregular pressure changes due to movement in the plethysmography trace (red box in Figure 3A); inactivity occurs when the mouse is asleep or awake but still.\nIdentify EMG bouts independently for each muscle.\n\t\nRectify and integrate the filtered EMG signal over 30 ms (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: Because mice breathe at a rate of 3 Hz, each breath is represented by approximately 11 integrated values.",
    "Determine the baseline EMG amplitude by averaging the rectified and integrated values associated with the EMG signal for a period of 3 s when the mouse is inactive and the plethysmography trace shows eupnea (normal breathing) (Figure 4).\nIdentify \"bouts\" of activity defined by at least 3 consecutive rectified and integrated values that are at least a 50% increase above the baseline EMG signal (determined in step 6.3.2).\n\t\tNOTE: Three consecutive values represent a 90-ms window, but some bouts will contain more than 3 values above the threshold and will last longer than 90 ms.\nUse the synchronized video and plethysmography trace to exclude bouts that occur during sighs (Figure 3B); sniffing (Figure 3C); or volitional mouse movements, such as head turning or grooming.\nRepeat steps 6.3.1 - 6.3.4 for the second muscle.\nCalculate the bout frequency for each muscle. Record a) the beginning time and end time of each inactive period and b) the time each bout occurred using the above criteria. Sum the total inactive time. Divide the total number of bouts by the total min of inactive time over the course of the recording session to calculate the bout frequency.\nDetermine if changes in ventilation are associated with the activation of the recorded muscles.\n\t\nSelect the respiration parameters to be measured (e.g., peak inspiratory flow, tidal volume, minute volume, and breaths per min).\n\t\tNOTE: All possible selections can be found in the P3 Setup pulldown menu under \"Derived Parameters.\"\nIdentify the breaths that occur during EMG bout activity and the breaths that occur during EMG baseline activity (Figure 4).\nCreate parser segments spanning plethysmography breaths that are associated with EMG bout activity and create independent parser segments that are associated with baseline EMG activity. Make sure to set the type of analysis to \"Parser Seg.\"",
    "NOTE: This selection is found in the P3 Setup pulldown menu under \"Data Reduction Setup.\"\nMark the beginning of each parser segment with an event by right-clicking on the plethysmography trace. Specify a bout containing parser segments as \"Event 1\" in the dropdown menu and specify the baseline parser segments as \"Event 2\" to distinguish the two classes of segments.\nUnder the \"Functions\" menu, save the \"Marks Section\" and \"Marks Derived Data.\" Under the Data Parser menu, save the \"Parsed Review File\" and \"Parsed Derived Data.\"\n\t\tNOTE: The selected respiration parameters for each individual breath are found in the Marks Derived Data sheet in the tab labeled \"Derivations.\"\nCompare the respiratory parameters for breaths that occur during ARM bouts (marked as Event 1) versus breaths that occur during baseline activity (marked as Event 2) to determine if muscle activity is associated with changes in ventilation.\nSubscription Required.
