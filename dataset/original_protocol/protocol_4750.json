    "Single house mice in proper mouse caging (see Equipment) under controlled conditions (see Materials and Reagents). Conditions should comply with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th ed. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guide-for-the-Care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf[href=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guide-for-the-Care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf]). Allow mice to acclimate for 7 d under these conditions.Setup 2-bottle choice test for baseline conditions (Figure 1). Fill 50 ml centrifuge tubes to ~40 ml with RO water and apply sipper cap. Invert tubes and allow air bubble in sipper tube to rise. Make sure the water line is below the conical tapered end when inverted. Label each tube (e.g., “A” & “B” in permanent marker) and mark location of water line using a permanent marker. Alternatively, the initial bottle weight can be recorded. Place the 2 inverted tubes into wire lid, with minimal shaking to avoid dripping. Both bottles should be placed on one side of the divided wire rack, leaving the other side for food. Make sure that the rubber stopper is flushed with caging and that steel sipper tubes extend below wire cage lid (Figure 1). Avoid water leakage from sipper tubes when replacing cage on rack. Put food chow on the other side of the wire lid. Note: Ensure that bedding is not in excess. Mice can pile the bedding when nesting or if stressed, and bedding touching the sipper tube can cause the contents of the tube to empty. Alternatively, you may also add a “drip cage” to use as a control [for an example of this method see (Hwa et al., 2011)]. The drip cage is an empty cage that gets the same cage change and bottles daily. This sample drip loss can be subtracted from final calculations as an estimate of typical leakage. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602181939_9173.jpgFigure 1.

    "Sipper bottles separated out into its components consisting of metal sipper tube, rubber stopper (which the sipper tube is placed into via a hole in the center), and 50 ml conical centrifuge tube. B. Picture of 2-bottle setup in a home cage. The bottles are filled with solutions and place atop the wire mesh cage lid, with the metal sippers facing into the cage.Assess baseline water consumption daily for 4 d. To assess consumption, weigh bottle or mark volume level. If conducting weight measurements, record pre- and post-consumption weights of the tube (1 g = 1 ml of water). For volume measurements, record volume levels on tube using a permanent marker. Different colored markers for each day are recommended. Do not invert tubes (where sipper cap is upright) when marking volume, as this allows air into the sipper and can cause dripping. Monitor for any problems with liquid flow and observe for signs of spillage, e.g., wet bedding, below the sipper tube. Switch positions (left vs right) of tubes daily.Setup 2-bottle choice test for sucrose preference. Dissolve sucrose in RO water. Determination of sucrose concentration (% w/v; Figure 2) will require preliminary experiments using an initial dose-response curve (0.25-2%) to ascertain optimal sucrose preference necessary based on any a priori hypothesis.  For example, if your hypothesized outcome indicates a likely reduction in preference, a greater concentration is recommended. However, if you are expecting an increase in preference, lesser concentrations may be more appropriate. Fill one tube (e.g., one marked “A”) with fresh RO water and the other (“B”) with the sucrose solution. Place tubes on wire lid as previously described.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602182108_6190.jpgFigure 2.

    "Assess water and sucrose solution consumption daily for 4 d. Record weights and/or volume of each tube. Monitor for any problems with liquid flow or spillage, e.g., wet bedding, below the sipper tube. Switch positions (left vs right) of tubes daily.Apply volume formula (see Notes) to determine consumption. Assess raw weight and/or volume consumed, and % preference for the sucrose-containing solution."
