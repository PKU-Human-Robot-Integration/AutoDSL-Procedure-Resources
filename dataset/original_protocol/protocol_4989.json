    "Isolation of gametesOverlay the siliconized coverslip with 0.3 ml mineral oil and make several 1-2 μl mannitol droplets (370 mosmol/kg H2O) inside the mineral oil on the coverslip (Figure 1C) using a glass capillary connected to a handling injector. Take care that the droplets have no access to the air (Figure 1D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161213/20161213002752_1631.jpgFigure 1.

A photo (C) and an image (D) of mannitol droplets inside the mineral oil over the siliconized coverslip. Bars = 1 cm in A and C, 200 μm in B.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Making glass capillary  Collect panicles in which some flowers have already opened and others remain unflowered. Pick up the unflowered ones from the panicles and dissect them under a stereo microscope. Isolate ovaries, and transfer them into 3.5 cm plastic dishes filled with 3 ml of mannitol solution (370 mosmol/kg H2O) (Figure 2A).For egg cell isolation, remove the stigmas from ovaries and transfer them into new 3.5 cm plastic dishes filled with 3 ml of the mannitol solution (see Note 5). Allow the ovaries to sink to the bottom of the dishes and cut them transversely with a razor blade at the middle (Figures 2A and 2B). Under an inverted microscope, identify the egg cells which are released from the lower parts of the cut ovaries (Figure 2C; see Note 6). By using a glass capillary connected to a handling injector, collect egg cells and transfer them into mannitol droplets prepared in step A1 (Figure 4A; see Note 7). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161213/20161213002935_2325.jpgFigure 2.

For sperm cell isolation, dissect an unopened flower under a stereo microscope to obtain anthers, and transfer anthers into a 3.5 cm plastic dish filled with 3 ml of mannitol solution (370 mosmol/kg H2O). Break anthers in mannitol solution with forceps to free pollen grains (Figure 3A). Pollen grains burst due to the osmotic shock and release sperm cells. Identify the sperm cells under an inverted microscope (Figure 3B). By using a glass capillary connected to a handling injector, collect sperm cells and transfer into mannitol droplets prepared in step A1. (Figure 4B; see Note 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161213/20161213003027_9918.jpgFigure 3. Isolation of rice sperm cells from pollen grains. A. A broken anther (arrow) and released pollen grains (arrowheads) in mannitol solution. B. A pollen grain (arrow) released its content in mannitol solution. Two sperm cells were enclosed with the square. Bars = 500 µm in A and 20 μm in B.Electro-fusion of isolated gametesSet up fusion apparatus and adjust the position of electrodes (Figures 4C and 5).Transfer one egg cell to each of the six mannitol droplets (Figure 4C), then transfer 1 or 2 sperm cells to each droplet.Lower the position of electrodes into a fusion droplet using manipulator (Videos 2 and 3), and align and fix the two gametes at one electrode under an alternating current (AC) field (1 MHz, 5 V rms). Under the AC field, gametes move toward electrode. By moving the electrode connected with manipulator, first fix an egg cell to the electrode. Using the same procedure, fix a sperm cell to the female gamete (Figure 4D).",
    "Adjust the final distance of the electrodes to approximately twice the sum of the diameters of the cells.Add 0.5-1.0 μl of mannitol solution (520 mosmol/kg H2O) gently to the fusion droplet using a thin glass capillary (Figure 4E, see Note 9).Induce cell fusion by applying a single negative direct current (DC) pulse (50 μsec, 12-15 V) (Figures 4F and 4G, Video 4, see Note 10).Remove the fusion products from the electrode by gently moving the electrode. Move the electrodes out of the droplet with manipulator and conduct the next gamete fusion at step B3 (see Notes 11 and 12).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161213/20161213003248_7040.jpgFigure 4.

    "2 ml zygote culture medium in a Millicell-CM insert and put it into a 3.5 cm plastic dish containing 2 ml of the medium. Add 40-60 µl of a rice suspension cell culture into the dish as feeder cells.After sterilization of the microcapillary by washing with absolute ethanol and sterilized water, transfer IVF-produced zygotes into fresh mannitol droplets (450 mosmol/kg H2O) twice and then transfer them onto the membranes of a Millicell-CM insert (Figure 5A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161213/20161213003459_4947.jpgFigure 6.

    "After overnight culture of zygotes at 26 °C in the dark without shaking, continue culture with gentle shaking (40 rpm) (Figures 6B-6F; see Notes 13 and 14).Five days after fusion, remove feeder cells by transferring the Millicell dishes containing the embryos into new 35-mm diameter dishes filled with 2 ml of fresh zygote culture medium (Figure 6G; see Note 15). Continue culturing as above.After 18 days in culture, subculture cell colonies developed from the IVF-produced zygotes in Millicell-CM inserts onto a regeneration medium in plastic dishes by use of a sterilized Pasteur pipette (Note 16). Incubate under continuous light at 30 °C for 12-30 days (Figure 6H; see Note 17).Transfer the differentiated shoots into a rooting medium in plastic dishes and culture them under a 13/11 h light/dark cycle at 28 °C for 11-13 days (Figures 6I and 6J).Transfer the resulting plantlets to soil pods (diameter 20-28 cm, depth 30-35 cm) and grow in environmental chambers as described in Note 1 (Figure 6K). If needed, harvest seeds from the regenerated plants and germinate them (Figure 6L)."
