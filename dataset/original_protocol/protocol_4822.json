    "Purification of flagellar filaments from Acidovorax avenae For pre-culture of Acidovorax avenae, add 2 µl of A. avenae skimmed milk stock solution to 2 ml of LB liquid medium, and shake (200 rpm) for overnight at 30 °C.Add 100 µl of pre-cultured suspension to one liter fresh LB medium, and shake (200 rpm) for 24 h at 30 °C.Harvest A. avenae cells by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature.Add 300 ml of 25 mM TBS buffer to the pellet and re-suspend. After centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant.Re-suspend the pellet with 90 ml of TBS buffer, and transfer to fiber blender.To take off flagellum from bacterial cells, shear with fiber blender for 1 min at 4 °C, and incubate for 5 min on ice. Repeat this step 7 times.To remove intact bacterial cells, centrifuge the bacterial suspension at 6,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and save the supernatant.To remove bacterial cellular debris, centrifuge the supernatant at 16,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C and save the supernatant.Ultracentrifuge the supernatant at 200,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.  Add 1.5 ml of ice-cold distilled water to the pellet and re-suspend.Centrifuge the re-suspended pellet at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, and discard the supernatant. The pellet contains the monomer and polymer flagellins.Re-suspend the pellet with 0.5 ml of ice-cold distilled water and store at -80 °C. Observation of purified flagellar filaments using transmission electron microscopy50 µl droplet of the purified flagellar filaments (pellet of 20,000 x g) are used.Absorb the purified flagellum onto collodion-coated grids, which are supported with carbon and rendered the carbon surface hydrophilic, for 1 min.",
    "Stain the grids with 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.9) for 1 min and wash with two drops of distilled water.Images are taken as digitized pictures with transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Purity check of flagellin in the purified flagellar filaments by Western blottingFlagellar filaments of A. avenae consists of only flagellin protein. Purity of flagellin in the flagellar filaments is analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Add half volume of 2x sample buffer to 100 ng of purified flagellum suspension.Heat the sample at 95 °C for 5 min, and cool on ice.Load 20 ng of sample and 2 µl of Prestained XL-Ladder Low marker of low range onto SDS-PAGE gel.Electrophoresis at constant 100 Volts until the dye reaches the bottom of the gel.Electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane using transfer buffer (constant 10 Volts for 3 h).Incubate membrane in 25 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature.Wash three times for 5 min each with 25 ml of TBST.Incubate membrane with primary Anti-flagellin rabbit antibody (1:2,500) in 10 ml of TBST for 1 h at room temperature.Wash five times for 5 min each with 25 ml of TBST.Incubate membrane with secondary goat HRP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2,000) in 10 ml of TBST for 30 min room temperature.Wash three times for 5 min each with 25 ml of TBST.Incubate membrane with 1 ml of ECL plus Western blotting detection reagent for 3 min at room temperature, and then wrap in Hybri-Bag.Measure the intensity of each band with LAS-4000.H2O2 detection and quantificationSuspension cultures of rice cells (line OC) were grown at 30 °C under white fluorescent light irradiation in a plant growth chamber. The cells were diluted in fresh medium every week, and experiment for H2O2 detection was performed 4 days after transfer.",
    "Place the cultured rice cells onto filter paper to remove the culture medium. Add 10 mg culture cells into 0.5 ml of fresh medium, and culture the cells in a plant growth chamber for 2 h at 30 °C.Add the flagellin (100 nM) to the cultured cells, and incubate in a plant growth chamber at 30 °C. Less than 100 µl of the flagellin suspension is desirable for addition to a culture medium. After incubation, add 10 µl of culture medium to chemiluminescence reaction buffer containing 160 µl of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9), 10 µl of 1.1 mM luminol and 20 µl of 14 mM potassium ferricyanide. Quantify H2O2 using a lumi-counter."
