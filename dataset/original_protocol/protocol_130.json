    "Competitive inhibition of CXCL8 binding to CXCR2 receptor by CXCR2 agonist\n1. Cultivate cells endogenously expressing or stably overexpressing CXCR2 \\(i.e. HEK293-CXCR2 cells) \\(10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL) in a 24-well plate in DMEM medium plus 10% FCS overnight.\n  2. Remove the medium and add binding buffer \\(medium without FCS).\n  3. Put the plate on ice for 10 min.\n  4. Add cold agonist, i.e. rMIF or cold CXCL8 \\(0 &#x2013; 1 &#xB5;M) together with the tracer \\(40 pM of 125I -labeled recombinant CXCL8).\n  5. Perform equilibrium receptor binding for 90 min at 4 &#xB0;C.\n  6. Remove the medium and wash the cells twice with cold medium.\n  7. Harvest the cells by adding 0.5 M NaOH.\n  8. Transfer the lysate to a liquid scintillation tube.\n  9. Add Aquasafe 500 plus LSC cocktail and mix well.\n  10. Determine the cell-bound radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.\n  11. For most agonist-receptor interactions, assume that receptor binding inhibition by agonist \\(i.e. rMIF or cold CXCL8) follows a one-site model.\n  12. Calculate the EC<sub>50</sub>, K<sub>i</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> values by using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff for heterologous competition experiments, applying the GraphPad software."
