  "procedures": [
    "This research received approval from the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Kunming Medical University (kmmu20220945). All experiments adhered to established animal care guidelines. Leptomeningeal lymphatic endothelial cells (LLECs) were harvested from male C57Bl/6J mice aged 6-8 weeks and weighing between 20-25 g. These mice were procured from Kunming Medical University in Kunming, China. The entire experimental procedure was conducted under strict sterile conditions. All the centrifugation steps are performed at room temperature unless otherwise specified.\n1. Preparation of reagents and instruments\nNOTE: All steps involving solutions must be conducted within a class II biohazard cabinet.\nPrepare the washing buffer by mixing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with calcium and magnesium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) (see Table of Materials). Keep this buffer cold at 4 °C. It is essential to prepare it fresh on the day of use and degas the buffer.\nPrepare the digestive enzymes by combining 10 mL of PBS (without calcium and magnesium) with 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin, 1 mL of 20 mg/mL papain, and 200 µL of 1 mg/mL collagenase I (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Ensure the use of aliquots of appropriate volumes to prevent repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Store these aliquots at -20 °C.\nPrepare the culture medium by utilizing the commercially available endothelial cell growth medium kit, which includes VEGF-C (100 ng/mL) and 1% P/S (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare the stopping buffer by supplementing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS to stop the digestion process.\nPrepare sterile surgical instruments: these instruments should include scissors, serrated-tip tweezers, and fine-point tweezers.\n2. Flask coating\nCoat the T25 flask with a 100 µg/mL fibronectin solution (see Table of Materials) and incubate overnight at 37 °C. Prior to use, remove the coating solution using a pipette.",
    "Wash the flask three times with PBS, subsequently aspirate the PBS, and allow the T25 flask to air dry.\n3. Leptomeninges dissociation\nNOTE: Always use pre-cooled buffers and solutions at 4 °C.\nAnesthetize the mice with excess inhalation of 4% isoflurane and then sacrifice them by swift decapitation using scissors that have been previously cleaned with 70% ethanol.\nCarefully incise the skin along the midline, starting from the opening at the back of the skull and extending toward the frontal area.\nDelicately remove the skull, lifting it gently with the scissors to avoid damaging the leptomeninges, ensuring the entire brain, including the leptomeninges, is obtained.\nSubmerge the whole brain in a washing buffer and gently flush it to remove surface blood.\nTransfer the brain into a sterile Petri dish without chopping, and extract the leptomeninges from the brain's surface using fine-point tweezers under a microscope.\nCut the leptomeninges tissue into fragments using sterile micro-scissors.\n4. Leptomeninges enzymatic digestion\nAdd 10 mL of the enzyme mix (step 1.2) to the fragments and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Gently agitate to ensure the fragments detach from the bottom of the tube. Afterward, add 10 mL of stopping buffer (step 1.4) to halt the digestion.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and carefully remove the supernatant using a pipette.\nAdd 10 mL of cold PBS, and pass the mixture through a 70 µm strainer into a sterile 50 mL tube to filter out any clumps.\n5. Cell expansion\nPlate 1 x 105 cells per cm2 into a fibronectin-coated T25 flask (step 2) with 5 mL of culture medium.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Afterward, remove the medium to eliminate non-attached cells.",
    "Sustain the culture by replacing 50% of the medium every two days. Repeat this process two or three times.\n6. Magnetic cell selection\nNOTE: Work swiftly, maintain cell coldness, and utilize pre-cooled solutions to prevent non-specific cell labeling.\nPreparation of instruments and reagents: attach a magnetic separator to a magnetic separator stand (see Table of Materials). Connect a selection column to the magnetic separator, and position a 70 µm cell strainer atop the selection column. Place a 50 mL tube beneath the selection column to collect the flow.\nEnzymatic digestion: once the cells reach 80% confluence, aspirate the medium and rinse the cells with PBS. Add 0.25% trypsin to detach adherent cells and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Stop the digestion by adding the stopping buffer. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant.\nAntibody incubation: resuspend 1 x 107 total cells in 100 µL of PBS and add 10 µL of LYVE-1 antibody (see Table of Materials). Mix thoroughly and incubate for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C.\n\t\nSpin the cells at 300 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Rinse the cells by introducing 1 mL of PBS and centrifuging at 300 x g for 5 min. Completely remove the supernatant.\nMicrobeads labeling: resuspend the cells in 100 µL of PBS and add 20 µL of Microbeads (see Table of Materials). Mix well and incubate for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C.\n\t\nSpin the cells at 300 x g for 5 min and decant the supernatant. Subsequently, cleanse the cells with 1 mL of PBS through centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min. Finally, completely remove the supernatant.",
    "Magnetic negative exclusion: resuspend the cells in 4 mL of PBS. Pass the cells through a 70 µm cell strainer to eliminate clumps. Prepare the selection column (see Table of Materials) by rinsing it with 3 mL of PBS, then apply the cell suspension into the selection column.\n\t\nPerform washing steps with 3 mL of PBS and collect LYVE-1-negative cells into a 50 mL tube positioned below the selection column to allow them to pass through.\nMagnetic positive selection: pipette 6 mL of PBS into the selection column. Instantly flush out the magnetically labeled cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the selection column to obtain LYVE-1-positive LLECs.\n\t​NOTE: Always wait until the selection column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\n7. LLECs culture\nCentrifuge the LYVE-1-positive LLECs at 300 x g for 5 min, and then carefully remove the supernatant.\nPlate 1 x 105 cells per cm2 into a fibronectin-coated T25 flask with 5 mL of culture medium.\nMaintain the culture by replacing 50% of the medium every other day. When the cells reach 80% confluence, detach the cells with 0.25% trypsin and perform cell passage. Utilize the cells for subsequent experiments after 2-3 passages.\n8. Flow cytometric analysis\nNOTE: The Flow cytometric analysis was conducted following the previously described procedure15.\nAdd 0.25% trypsin to detach adherent cells and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Then, add the stopping buffer to halt the digestion.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min and completely aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend 1 x 106 cells in 100 µL of PBS.\nAdd 1 µL of LYVE-1 antibody. Mix thoroughly and incubate for 10 min in the dark at room temperature.",
    "Resuspend the cells in an appropriate amount of PBS buffer for analysis using flow cytometry and FlowJo software (see Table of Materials).\n9. Immunofluorescent staining\nNOTE: The immunofluorescent staining was conducted following the procedure described previously16.\nWash the cells with PBS three times. Fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the PFA and wash the cells with PBS three times.\nApply the block buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Remove the block buffer from the coverslips.\nAdd the LYVE-1 antibody in the staining buffer to the cells and incubate in the dark. Wash the cells three times with PBS.\nAdd an appropriate secondary antibody (see Table of Materials) in the staining buffer to the cells and incubate in the dark. Wash the cells three times with PBS.\nCounterstain with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The cells are now ready for immunofluorescence microscopy.\nSubscription Required.
