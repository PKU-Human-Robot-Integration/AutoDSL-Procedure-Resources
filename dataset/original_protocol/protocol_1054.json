    "Cell Crosslinking\n1. Pellet detached adherent or suspension cells and resuspend in freshly made 1% glutaraldehyde at a volume of 1 mL of glutaraldehyde for every one million cells.\n  2. Incubate cells at room temperature for 10 minutes with rotation.\n  3. Add glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM to quench the glutaraldehyde, and then incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with rotation.\n  4. Pellet cells, wash in PBS, pellet again, and then store at -80 or proceed into the HiChIRP protocol.\n  \nModified 3C protocol\nThis modified protocol can replace the 3C protocol used in HiChIP to obtain improved signal to background. It also can be used in Hi-C or other 3C-based protocols, likely also with improved signal to background.\n1. Resuspend up to 15 million crosslinked cells in 500 μL of ice-cold Hi-C Lysis Buffer and rotate at 4 for 15 minutes.\n  2. Spin down at 2500 rcf for 5 minutes and discard the supernatant.\n  3. Wash pelleted nuclei once with 500 μL of ice-cold Hi-C Lysis Buffer.\n  4. Remove the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100 μL of 0.5% SDS.\n  5.

Rather than heat inactivating the MboI, immediately spin down at 4 and remove supernatant, wash nuclei twice with 1X NEB Buffer 2.\n  9. Resuspend nuclei in 536 μL of 1X NEB Buffer 2.",
    "10.

For each wash, add 500 μL of Wash Buffer to beads and then incubate at 37 rotating for 5 minutes.\n  11. Perform a final wash on the beads with 200 μL ChIRP DNA Elution Buffer \\(prepare fresh) by swishing back and forth on the magnet.\n  \nChIRP DNA Elution\n1.

Incubate at 37 for 30 minutes with shaking.\n  4. Place samples on magnet and remove supernatant to a fresh tube. Add another 200 μL of ChIRP DNA Elution Buffer with RNases and incubate again at 37 for 30 minutes with shaking.\n  5. Remove supernatant again to the new tube. There should now be 400 μL of ChIRP sample.\n  6.

Wash the beads twice by adding 500 μL of Tween Wash Buffer and incubating at 55 for 2 minutes shaking.\n  5. Wash the beads in 100 μL of 1X \\(from 2X) TD Buffer",
    "6. Resuspend beads in 25 μL of 2X TD Buffer, the appropriate amount of Tn5 for your material amount \\(2.5 μL for 50 ng of post-ChIRP DNA), and water to 50 μL. Adjust Tn5 amount linearly for different amounts of post-ChIRP DNA, with a maximum amount of 4 μL of Tn5. For example for 25 ng of DNA transpose using 1.25 μL of Tn5, while for 125 ng of DNA transpose with 4 μL of Tn5. Using the correct amount of Tn5 is critical to the HiChIRP protocol to achieve an ideal size distribution. An overtransposed sample will have shorter fragments and will exhibit lower alignment rates \\(when the junction is close to a fragment end). An undertransposed sample will have fragments that are too large to cluster properly on an Illumina sequencer. A maximum amount of Tn5 is used in order to save on Tn5 costs, and considering that a library with this much material will be amplified in 5 cycles and have enough complexity to be sequenced deeply regardless of how fully transposed the library is to achieve an ideal size distribution.\n  7. Incubate at 55 with interval shaking for 10 minutes.\n  8. Place samples on magnet and remove supernatant.\n  9. Add 50 mM EDTA to samples and incubate at 50 for 30 minutes, then quickly place on magnet and remove supernatant.\n  10. Wash samples twice with 50 mM EDTA at 50 for 3 minutes, removing quickly on magnet.\n  11. Wash samples twice in Tween Wash Buffer at 55 for 2 minutes, removing quickly on magnet.\n  12. Wash samples in 10 mM Tris.\n  \nPCR and Post-PCR Size Selection\n1. Resuspend beads in 50 μL of PCR master mix: 25 uL Phusion HF 2X, 1 uL Nextera Ad1.x 12.5 uM, 1 uL Nextera Ad2.x 12.5 uM, 23 uL water.",
    "2. Run the following PCR program: 5 minutes at 72C, 1 minute at 98C, then cycle 15 seconds at 98C, 30 seconds at 63C, and 1 minute at 72C. Cycle number can be estimated using one of two different methods: \\(1) First run 5 cycles on a regular PCR and then remove from beads. Add 0.25X SYBR green and then run on a qPCR and pull out samples at the beginning of exponential amplification. \\(2) Run reactions on a PCR and estimate cycle number based on the amount of material from the post-ChIRP Qubit \\(greater than 50 ng was ran in five cycles, while approximately 50 ng was ran in six, 25 ng was ran in seven, 12.5 ng was ran in eight, etc.).\n  3. Place libraries on a magnet and elute into new tubes. Zymo purify and elute in the same 10 μL of water. PAGE purify libraries \\(we use 6%) from a size range of 300 – 700. Note that if the bulk of the material is smaller those sizes can be included but the paired-end libraries will have a lower alignment rate. In the future Tn5 amount should be adjusted accordingly.\n  4. Instead of PAGE, a two-sided size selection with Ampure XP beads can be performed. After PCR place libraries on a magnet and elute into new tubes. Then add 25 μL of Ampure XP beads and keep the supernatant to capture fragments less than 700 bp. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and add 15 μL of fresh beads to capture fragments greater than 300 bp. \n  5. Final elution \\(from either PAGE purification or Ampure XP) is in 10 μL of water. Quantify libraries with qPCR against Illumina primers and/or Bioanalyzer."
