    "This protocol outlines the method for thawing Bd from frozen stocks to have cultures in the lab.

Rinse cryotube with an additional 1 ml 1% tryptone to gather any remaining cells, adding this to the volume from step 2.",
    "5. Spin cells down at 2,500 × g for 5 min to separate DMSO-containing medium from cells.\n6. Pour off supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml 1% tryptone.\n7. Prepare a 1:10 dilution (10 μl cells, 90 μl medium) of zoospores from the resuspended Bd into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube.\n8. Count the number of cells in the diluted aliquot using a hemocytometer and determine the density of resuspended cells in the conical tube.\n9.

Check under microscope daily to assess activity level.\nCells may take up to 1 week to become active enough to begin regular subculturing. Typically, multiple swimming zoospores per fields of view is sufficient.",
    "It is often advantageous to synchronize cultures to ensure that cells harvested for experiments are at a similar stage of development. This helps to minimize variability within a sample. This protocol outlines how to obtain a synchronized culture of Bd in liquid medium. All steps except for centrifugation should be performed in a biosafety cabinet to both contain and maintain the sterility of the culture.

    "3. Add appropriate volumes of filtered cells and new medium into a 25-cm2 TC-treated culture flask at a final concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 10 ml.\nIf necessary, use centrifugation to concentrate filtered cells, resuspend, recount, and then recalculate the necessary volume needed to reach 2 × 105 cells/ml.\n4. Incubate flask at 24˚C, subculturing to a new flask every 3 days (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0003]).",
    "This protocol outlines how to maintain a synchronized culture of Bd in liquid medium. It is essential to seed Bd at the appropriate density: If the culture is too sparse, sporangia may fail to release zoospores; if it is too dense, cells will fail to develop (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-fig-0002]). We usually seed cells in flasks at ∼2 × 105 cells/ml with a final volume of 10 ml for a 25-cm2 flask; 25 ml for a 75-cm2 flask; and 60 ml for a 175-cm2 flask. Note that because Bd is a deadly pathogen to amphibians we typically treat it as a BSL-II organism and conduct cell culture in a laminar flow biosafety cabinet. We also autoclave or treat with freshly diluted 10% bleach all items that come in contact with cultures, including tissue culture plastics.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e2e1fcd9-77f5-4e2a-a157-8945cf21390d/cpz1309-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis zoospore densities over time in liquid culture.

Insets show cartoon side views of a hypothetical flask (top) and top-view phase contrast images (bottom) of a flask seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml at the given time points. Hemocytometer counts are not always reliable when counting Bd zoospores but due to the size of the cells, it is the best option we have. A number of factors could explain unexpected cell counts, such as too few or too many cells per hemocytometer grid (most manufacturers recommend counting 20-200 cells total per grid) or sporangia actively releasing zoospores into the aliquot used for counting. It is typical to see varied curves as shown here.\nMaterials\nActive, synchronous culture of Bd JEL423 in liquid medium (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0001] and Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0002])\nTryptone liquid medium, sterile (1%, w/v, MilliporeSigma, T7293; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-rec-0004])",

After thawing Bd (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0001]) and synchronizing the culture (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0002]), transfer (or “subculture”) the cells to new medium every 3 days as follows.\nSee Supporting Information Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#support-information-section] for a calendar layout of subculturing timeline.\n2. Prepare a 1:10 dilution of zoospores in suspension from a 3-day-old flask of Bd into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube by removing 10 μl medium from the mature culture flask and adding to 90 μl medium in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. Gently flick tube to mix.\n3. Count cell density in the diluted aliquot using a hemocytometer; determine the density of cells in the flask using the appropriate formula.\n4. Add appropriate volumes of cells from the 3-day-old flask and new medium to subculture into a new flask at a final concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml.",
    "For example: If the 3-day-old flask has a zoospore density of 4 × 106 cells/ml, put 0.5 ml (2 × 106 cells) of mature culture into 9.5 ml of 1% tryptone medium for a 25-cm2 TC-treated flask. The final concentration of cells in the flask is now 2 × 105 cells/ml.\n5. Close the cap of the flask, gently lay it on its flat side, and grow at 24˚C for 3 days.",
    "Bd can be cultured asynchronously, though the culture will be less predictable. Maintaining an asynchronous culture requires daily observation of flasks and is difficult to determine cell density. Subculturing would take place as needed or when the flask becomes too dense by eye.\nAdditional Materials (see also Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0001])\nNon-TC-treated culture flasks with vent cap, sterile (Cell Treat, 229500, 229510, or 229520)\n1. After thawing Bd into a non-TC-treated flask (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-prot-0001]), transfer (or “subculture”) the cells to new medium as needed, as follows.\n2. Prepare a 1:10 and 1:20 dilution of the mature cells into new medium in a non-TC-treated flask.\nFor example, add 1 ml of cell culture into 9 ml of 1% tryptone medium for a 25-cm2 non-TC-treated flask for the 1:10 dilution.\n3. Close the cap of the flasks, gently lay on their flat sides, and grow at 24˚C until culture becomes too dense and needs to be sub-cultured again.\nCheck on flasks daily. The appropriate density for maintenance depends on the age of individual cells and is best empirically determined for each laboratory by splitting at regular intervals at different densities and identifying the parameters that give predictable and robust growth. We recommend starting with passaging at 1:10 and 1:20 every 3 days and, depending on cell growth, adjust concentrations and/or passaging frequency as needed. If the culture remains sparse, try subculturing at higher cell density and/or less frequently. If cells are too dense and stop growing, try subculturing at lower cell density and/or more frequently. Cultures may appear similar to those shown in Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-fig-0001].",

(2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.309#cpz1309-bib-0002]), which involves slow freezing of ampules of cells resuspended in a cryopreservant and long-term storage in liquid nitrogen or at -80°C. All steps except for centrifugation should be performed in a biosafety cabinet to both contain and maintain the sterility of the culture.

    "The use of the Mr. Frosty container is key to maintaining the viability of cultures through the cryopreservation process. Stocks may be kept at -80°C for short-term storage (up to 6 months), but if you plan on storing your stocks long term (longer than 6 months), transfer tubes from the -80°C to liquid nitrogen after 24-48 hr to ensure stable temperatures and prevent thawing."
