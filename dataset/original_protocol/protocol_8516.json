    "The following fMRI NFT protocol complies with the guidelines provided by the Wright State University Institutional Review Board.\n1. Control Groups\nCarefully consider and determine control groups a priori. Design control group(s) to allow the hypothesis(es) to be evaluated and to account for effects from additional factors such as practice or expectations created by the feedback displays44.\n2. Hardware Setup\nPrepare all hardware before the participant enters the MRI room using the same procedures as traditional fMRI.\nConnect the MR-compatible display and response device system to the stimulus computer (PC).\nRoute cabling for the MR-compatible response devices and headphones through or around the MRI bore.\nConnect the TR-trigger output from the MRI to stimulus PC.\n\tNOTE: In some setups, this may be connected to the MR-compatible response device hardware, which then connects to the stimulus computer. This is imperative for the synchronization stimuli and data acquisition.\nPosition the MR-compatible display so that it will be visible to the participant via the mirror (to be) affixed to the head coil.\n3. Participant Positioning\nNOTE: The participant should be positioned on the scanner table in a similar manner to a typical brain MRI, and in the same manner as traditional fMRI.\nHave the participant lie down in a supine position on the scanner table. Ask them to maintain their head inside the head coil.\nPlace the headphones on the participant's head, and ensure the ears are covered. If additional hearing protection is required, insert ear plugs prior to positioning the head phones.\nPlace a pad under the participant's knees for added comfort.\nLock the upper body of the head coil into place.\nAffix the mirror to the head coil.\nPosition the response devices in the participant's hands.\nLandmark the location of the participant's nasion relative to the scanner.",
    "Move the landmarked location to the center of the MRI bore.\nConfirm that the participant can view the entire display using the mirror. Ask the participant to adjust the mirror as necessary.\n4. Localizing the Target Region\nPerform a \"functional\" localizer. Use the brain activity from the functional localizer to define the target Region of Interest (ROI)11.\n\tNOTE: This run is executed in a similar manner to traditional fMRI. However, the target ROI can also be defined using individual anatomy or standardized atlases removing the need to perform a functional localizer.\n\t\nProvide scripted and/or visual task instructions to the participant.\n\t\tNOTE: These instructions should be concise but contain adequate information to allow the participant to successfully perform the task executed during the functional localizer.Here, the instructions inform the participant a dot will be on the screen and they may hear sounds in the headphones. Their goal is to relax and focus on the dot.\nBegin synchronized administration of audible stimuli (e.g., bilateral continuous white noise29) and data acquisition by pushing the \"Scan\" button on the MR scanner.\n\t\tNOTE: This is performed by programming the presentation of the stimuli using the TR trigger from the fMRI acquisition. The TR trigger is controlled via the fMRI protocol however this may be affected by the manufacturer of the MRI and the installed packages. Any visual, haptic, and/or auditory stimuli can be supplied to perform other tasks and/or target other regions.\n\t\t\nAlternate the delivery of task stimuli (white noise) with matched control stimuli (no noise) in a blocked pattern. Use control stimuli to activate undesired networks/systems activated in the task stimuli.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This alternation occurs by synchronizing stimuli to the fMRI acquisition and monitoring TR pulses.",
    "Collect whole-brain echo planar images using a gradient-recalled-echo MRI pulse sequence; example parameters for the pulse sequence include an acquisition matrix of 64 x 64 elements in the phase and frequency directions, 41 slices aligned parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane, 3.75 x 3.75 x 3 mm3 voxel size, 0.5 mm slice gap, fat suppression enabled, TR/TE = 2,000/20 ms, and a flip angle = 90°.\nCompute an activation map from the fMRI data collected during the functional localizer using multivariate statistics.\n\tNOTE: The following steps are a variant of processing performed for traditional fMRI. Some steps have been removed or simplified to decrease processing time.\n\t\nPreprocess the data during data acquisition using custom software created from standard pre-processing techniques12,45.\n\t\t\nPerform 3D spatial filtering using a Gaussian low-pass kernel (full-width half-maximum of 4.5 mm).\nCorrect for translational motion by aligning the center of mass for each volume to the first volume of the functional localizer using tri-linear interpolation.\nPerform temporal filtering using a Gaussian low-pass kernel with σ = 3 s.\nCreate a model to predict the neurophysiological response to the task; this is performed in the same manner as traditional fMRI.\n\t\t\nCreate a psychological model which describes the active and rest states for each time point46. This models the time points during the task with a value of '1' and control with a '0'.\nConvolve the psychological model with a predefined Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF)46 to predict the fMRI (neurophysiological) response to the task.\nFit the fMRI data at each voxel as a function of time to the neurophysiological model using a General Linear Model (GLM). This results in a β parameter map, which is converted to t- or z-statistic maps (activation maps) using standard statistical transforms.",
    "Use the activation map overlaid on a mean fMRI image to determine the region in which the feedback signal for the subsequent neurofeedback will be derived.\n\tNOTE: This is performed using custom software. To remove global and unspecific changes, a second ROI may also be defined.\n\t\nNavigate through the slices using the mouse slider wheel or the slice slider bar to find anatomical markers visible in the fMRI data such as the inferior surface of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricles12.\nThreshold the activation map using the threshold slider bar to reveal the voxels most robustly activated during the functional localizer in the target region.\n\t\t\nPerform this by selecting a threshold a priori or by manually adjusting the threshold.\nUse the left mouse button to select individual voxels with activation above the selected threshold and within the target region to add to the ROI.\n\t\tNOTE: Voxels may be selected from one or more slices.\n5. fMRI NFT\nConduct neurofeedback runs using a boxcar model with alternating task and control conditions.\n\t\nImplement a task condition where participants raise or lower the activity of the target region, with the direction of control being critical to achieving the desired results.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, many regions of the brain are hyperactive in patients with tinnitus and, therefore, decreasing activity may encourage normal neural patterns.\nAlternate the task condition with a control condition where participants return activity to rest by relaxing and clearing their mind.\nProvide the participant with a scripted example of mindfulness tasks to be used during both conditions as starting aids for modulating brain activity towards the desired states. Instruct the participant to perform mindfulness tasks that drive brain activity towards the desired states.",
    "In the tinnitus example, instruct the participants to divert attention away from the auditory system to other sensory systems to reduce auditory activity.\nBaseline computation\n\t\tNOTE: Due to tuning of the MRI hardware components prior to each run, baselines are used to normalize data prior to presenting feedback to the participant. The baseline average is determined for the target region using an average of one or more volumes acquired at the beginning of each fMRI NFT run12,47.\n\t\t\nInstruct the participant to relax during a countdown presented at the beginning of the scan. \nBegin synchronized stimuli presentation and data acquisition by pressing the \"scan\" button on the MRI scanner. Collect echo planar images using a gradient-recalled-echo MRI pulse sequence in the same manner as prescribed for the functional localizer in step 4.1.2.\nAcquire baseline volumes.\n\t\nVisually present a countdown timer and blank feedback display.\nProcess the data during acquisition using custom software.\n\t\t\nPerform 3D spatial filtering using a Gaussian low-pass kernel (full-width half-maximum of 4.5 mm).\nCorrect for translational motion using the center of mass for each volume; each volume is registered to the first volume of the functional localizer using tri-linear interpolation.\nCompute average signal from target ROI across both time and space.\nSum the signals from all voxels within the target ROI in each volume.\nCreate ROI average for each volume by dividing the sum by the number of voxels in the ROI.\nAverage the sums from the baseline volumes.\nAcquire neurofeedback volumes\n\t\nPreprocess the data during acquisition using custom software.\n\t\t\nPerform 3D spatial filtering using a Gaussian low-pass kernel (full-width half-maximum of 4.5 mm).\nCorrect for translational motion by aligning the center of mass for each volume to the first volume of the functional localizer using tri-linear interpolation.",
    "Compute the feedback signal. A feedback signal is derived from each acquired volume during fMRI NFT. This is the information that is presented to the participant to aid learning volitional control.\n\t\t\nAverage the fMRI signal from all voxels within the target ROI to create a single value.\nCalculate the percent change between the current ROI average and the ROI baseline average. Optionally, this signal may be scaled by a factor dependent on the participant's performance.\nCompute the feedback signal by temporally filtering (Gaussian low-pass kernel with a sigma of 3 s consisting of only past components) the current percent change with the feedback signals from previous neurofeedback volumes.\nDisplay the feedback signal.\n\t\t\nDisplay the current feedback signal through a thermometer-style bar plot, where the height of the bar is proportional to the feedback value18,19,21,34.\nOverlay instructions for the participant on the feedback display.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These instructions are simple, and should direct the participant to relax, or raise or lower activity (i.e. the thermometer bar).\nOptionally provide additional stimulation. Additional visual, auditory, or haptic stimulation may be presented concurrently with feedback.\n6. Assess the Ability to Self-regulate the Target ROI.\nNOTE: After neurofeedback is completed, the ability to self-regulate the target region for each run of training needs to be quantified.\nAnalyze intra-subject changes in the feedback signals12.\n\t\nCreate a psychological model representing the rest and task conditions of neurofeedback.\n\t\tNOTE: This model is convolved with a predefined HRF to produce a neurophysiological model. The process is the same as that described for the functional localizer.\nFit the feedback signal time series to the neurophysiological model using a GLM. This results in a β parameter, which is converted to t- or z-statistic representative of the ability to self-regulate.\nPerform inter-subject comparisons.",
    "NOTE: Statistics representative of self-regulation performance can be compared across runs and groups using appropriate statistical analyses (e.g., paired t-tests or ANOVAs). These tests evaluate changes in the ability to self-regulate the target region across training and groups, and can be used to evaluate the study's hypothesis(es)."
