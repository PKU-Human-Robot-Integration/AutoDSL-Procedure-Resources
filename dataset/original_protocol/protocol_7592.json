    "Corneal epithelial cell isolation and culture All materials used in this procedure must be sterile or autoclaved to prevent contamination (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4829/bioprotoc-13-19-4829-g002.jpgFigure 2. Surgery tools used in the procedure must be autoclaved Euthanize mice by carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation to confirm death.Enucleate both eyeballs using tweezers and place them in 1% penicillin-streptomycin PBS (Figure 3A).Carefully trim off the cornea of full thickness from the eyeball with a pair of surgery scissors under a microscope (Figure 3B).Thereafter, cut the entire cornea with the limbus quarterly into a butterfly tie-like shape using scissors (Figure 3C) and place it in 1% penicillin-streptomycin PBS.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4829/bioprotoc-13-19-4829-g003.jpgFigure 3. The procedure of mouse corneal isolation. (A) The eyeball is enucleated and placed in PBS buffer. (B) The entire cornea with the limbus is cut off, and (C) quarterly divided into a butterfly tie-like shape.To coat a 12-well culture plate, prepare 0.1% gelatin solution (Recipe 3) and sterilize it through filtration. Add 100 μL of this coating solution to each well and leave at room temperature for 10 min.Aspirate the coating solution from the plate and place 2–4 corneas with the epithelium side down on each well in order to have enough epithelial cells moving out of the tissues.Gently press the tissue piece with tweezers to make the tissue fully contact the surface of the plate; add 100 μL of corneal epithelial culture medium (Recipe 1) to cover the entire corneal tissue.Incubate the plate with cultured corneas at 37 °C under 100% humidity and 5% CO2.On the second day, very slowly add 500 μL of the corneal epithelial culture medium along the well wall to prevent the tissue from floating.",
    "When most epithelial cells move out of the epithelial tissue onto the plate, approximately at day 7 after seeding (Figure 4A–4D), remove the corneal tissue with tweezers and add 1 mL of fresh corneal epithelial culture medium.Replace the old medium with 1.5 mL of new medium every 3–4 days until cell confluence. Reuse the ex vivo corneal tissue at least five times.After removing the culture medium, detach the confluent murine corneal epithelial cells from the plate and from each other by incubating them with 0.3 mL of 0.15% trypsin EDTA solution at 37 °C for 3 min.Split the cells once at 1:2 ratio into two separate wells with 3 mL of the corneal stromal fibroblast culture medium (Recipe 2) overnight to inactivate the trypsin and help cells adhere to the plate.On the next day, replace the corneal stromal fibroblast culture medium with 1.5 mL of corneal epithelial culture medium.The corneal epithelial cells are confirmed by their small, compact, round, or elliptical morphology (Figure 4E) and immunostaining (Figure 4F–4G) with the corneal epithelial marker keratin 12 (Krt12) and the common epithelial marker E-cadherin (Cdh1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4829/bioprotoc-13-19-4829-g004.jpgFigure 4. Mouse corneal epithelial cell isolation and culture. The isolated mouse cornea is placed upside down on a cell culture plate coated with 0.1% gelatin for (A) 0, (B) 1, (C) 3, and (D) 7 days. (E) The monolayer-cultured corneal epithelial cells and their immunofluorescence with (F) the corneal epithelial marker keratin 12 (Krt12) and (G) the common epithelial maker E-cadherin (Cdh1).Corneal stroma cell isolation and culture Euthanize mice by carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation to confirm death.",
    "Remove the epithelial layer down to the basement membrane by mechanical scraping using an Algerbrush II and a cotton swab (Video 1 shows the head tip of Algerbrush II scrapping corneal epithelial cells into a cell debris mass; after the entire epithelium area is debrided, the cell debris mass is cleaned by a cotton swab).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Debridement of the corneal epithelium using Algerbrush II Enucleate both eyeballs and place them in 1% penicillin-streptomycin PBS.Carefully trim off the cornea of full thickness from the eyeball with a pair of surgery scissors under a microscope (Figure 3B).Thereafter, cut the entire cornea with the limbus quarterly into a butterfly tie-like shape (Figure 3C) and place it in 1% penicillin-streptomycin PBS.Remove the endothelial layer using Martinez double ended corneal dissector (Video 2 shows that the stroma of cornea noticeably becomes clearer after the removal of the endothelium) and cut the remainder of the stromal tissue into small pieces using a pair of surgery scissors and a razor blade.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Removal of the corneal endothelium using Martinez dissector Further digest each minced corneal tissue in 0.5 mL of 0.1 mg/mL collagenase A in an Eppendorf tube at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Vortex the tube every 10 min until the digestion solution appears cloudy, a sign of thorough tissue digestion.Filtrate the digested corneal tissue with a 40 μm nylon net filter to remove bigger debris and to collect the flowthrough stromal cells in a 15 mL tube.Add the corneal stromal fibroblast culture medium to the flowthrough solution and centrifuge at 1,000× g for 5 min.Decant the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of the corneal stromal fibroblast culture medium (Recipe 2), and place it in one well of a 6-well culture plate.Refresh the medium every 3–4 days until cell confluence.",
    "After removal of the culture medium, detach the confluent murine corneal stromal fibroblast cells from the plate and from each other by incubating with 0.3 mL of 0.15% trypsin solution at room temperature for 3 min.Split the cells once at 1:2 ratio into two separate wells with 3 mL of the corneal stromal fibroblast culture medium to inactivate the trypsin and help cells adhere to the plate.The corneal fibroblasts (keratocytes) are confirmed by their morphology (Figure 5A–5C) and immunostaining (Figure 5D) with the fibroblast marker vimentin.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4829/bioprotoc-13-19-4829-g005.jpgFigure 5. Mouse corneal stromal fibroblast cell isolation and culture. The epithelium and the endothelium are first removed mechanically from the isolated mouse cornea; the remaining stroma is minced and then further digested with collagenase type A. Upon a passage through a nylon net filter, the isolated cells are cultured in a plate coated with 0.1% gelatin for (A) 1, (B) 3, and (C) 7 days.
