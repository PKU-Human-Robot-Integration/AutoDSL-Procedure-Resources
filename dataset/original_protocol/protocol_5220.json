    "Protospacer selectionSearch for the genomic DNA sequence of the T. cruzi gene of interest on TriTrypDB database (http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/[href=http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/]) and download that sequence plus 200 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon using the sequence retrieval tool.Select the protospacer region targeting the 3’end of the gene, to induce a double strand break by Cas9 nuclease in a site close to the stop codon (from 20 nt upstream of the stop codon to 50 nt downstream of the stop codon). The protospacer region is the 20-nt base-pairing sequence on the sgRNA. To target the template DNA strand, search in the transcribed gene sequence for 5’-N(20)-NGG-3’. The N(20) corresponds to the protospacer. NGG is the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence that is recognized by the Cas9 endonuclease. Alternatively, to target the non-template DNA strand, search in the transcribed gene sequence for 5’-CCN-N(20)-3’. The reverse complementary sequence of the N(20) will be used as the protospacer. Select the closest protospacer to the stop codon (preferably downstream of the open reading frame of the target gene) and verify that it does not generate Cas9 off-targeting on the T. cruzi genome. This can be done using online resources like EuPaGDT (Eukaryotic Pathogen CRISPR guide RNA Design Tool, http://grna.ctegd.uga.edu/[href=http://grna.ctegd.uga.edu/]) or specific scripts designed for this purpose (Sidik et al., 2014). Figure 1 shows an example of protospacer selection for gene tagging of TcVP1 (T. cruzi vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase coding sequence).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170512/20170512025846_8870.jpgFigure 1.

    "The schematic representation shows the genomic DNA sequence of TcVP1, including the start codon (ATG, bold sequence), the stop codon (TGA, red sequence), the chosen protospacer underlined in black, the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, blue sequence) and the homology regions 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) underlined in orange and green, respectively, that were included in the DNA donor molecule to induce DNA repair by homologous recombination. Scissors indicate the Cas9 cut site.sgRNA amplificationDesign a specific forward primer for each sgRNA to be amplified, inserting the protospacer sequence N(20) into the following primer backbone: 5’-GATCGGATCC-N(20)-GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGC-3’.

Determine cell density of T. cruzi cultures by counting cells in a Neubauer chamber. T. cruzi epimastigotes should be manipulated in biological safety cabinets.Cell transfectionsCo-transfect T. cruzi epimastigotes with sgRNA/Cas9/pTREX-n plasmid and DNA donor cassette for gene tagging. Perform transfections in triplicates. Grow T. cruzi epimastigotes to a density of 1-2 x 107 cells/ml. Wash cells once in PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature.

    "4 ml of cell suspension with 25 μg sgRNA/Cas9/pTREX-n plasmid and 25 μg DNA donor (each DNA in a maximum volume of 20 μl) in ice-cold 0.4 cm electroporation cuvettes. As controls for the electroporation, add 10 μl of ultra-pure water to one cuvette of cells, and add nothing to another cuvette of cells. Keep cells in cuvette on ice for 10 min and then electroporate using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser XcellTM system set at 1.5 kV and 25 μF with 3 pulses, leaving cuvettes for 1 min on ice between pulses. Video 1 shows the standard electroporation procedure described in this protocol.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Electroporation of T. cruzi epimastigotes Let cells recover in cuvette at room temperature for 15 min. Transfer cells to 5 ml LIT media supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubate at 28 °C. After 24 h, add antibiotics for selection. Antibiotics concentration should be previously optimized for each particular T. cruzi strain. For Y strain, cell lines should be maintained in medium containing 250 μg/ml G418 and 5 μg/ml puromycin (3xc-Myc tagged) or 250 μg/ml G418 and 350 μg/ml hygromycin (3xHA tagged).Maintain parasites in LIT medium supplemented with 20% FBS during the selection of resistant cells (usually 4-5 weeks). During this period, replace medium once a week by centrifuging parasites, removing supernatant and adding fresh medium with 20% FBS and antibiotics. In this way parasites are not diluted until reaching a cell density around 1-2 x 107 cells/ml. At this point, FBS concentration can be reduced to 10% in the culture medium and cells can be normally diluted for maintenance."
