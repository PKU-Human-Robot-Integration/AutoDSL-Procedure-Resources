    "1.  Collection of Whole Blood\nObtain a minimum of 10 mL of peripheral blood from affected individuals as well as age and gender matched healthy controls. Venous blood should be collected into sodium heparin vacutainer blood collection tubes, rather than using other anticoagulants such as EDTA, and inverted several times to ensure proper mixture with the sodium heparin. Note that 10 mL is the minimum volume of whole blood required for plating samples in duplicate for this particular assay.\nSamples should be processed as soon as possible after collection for best results. However, heparinized blood can be stored at room temperature under dim lighting for up to 24 hours until ready to be processed (2).\n2.  Preparation of Whole Blood\nCentrifuge all blood samples at 3000 rpm (with brake turned off) for ten minutes at room temperature. Without disturbing the buffy coat, the plasma can be collected from the top and stored for other experimental purposes. Plasma samples can be temporarily stored at -20°C or -80°C for long term storage\nOnce plasma is collected, wash samples by resuspending the red blood cell (RBC) pellet and buffy coat with serum free (incomplete) RPMI 1640 media (at ambient temperature). Gently pipette the mixture in the collection tubes and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube.\nVolume up to 50 mL with incomplete RPMI 1640 culture media and gently invert the tubes to create a homogenous mixture. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm (with brake turned off) for ten minutes. Making sure there is clear separation, aspirate the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the buffy coat. Repeat this procedure 2-4 times to ensure that all contaminants and bound cytokines are removed prior to stimulation.",
    "After the last wash, resuspend the RBC pellet and buffy coat so that the total volume is 20 mL (for 10 mL of whole blood initially drawn) with incomplete RPMI 1640 media. The total volume can be adjusted based on the volume of blood initially drawn.\nUsing the Cellometer Vision, diluted blood can be counted without lysing RBCs by choosing the white blood cell count option using acridine orange (AO). Add one part diluted blood with one part AO and load 20  μL of the 1:1 mixture into a disposable counting chamber. The final concentration of AO after dilution should be 1μg/mL.\nAdjust accordingly with incomplete RPMI 1640 media to a final cell concentration of 2.0 x 106 cells/mL.\n3.  Stimulation of Whole Blood\nThe assay requires a minimum of four conditions (each done in duplicate): unstimulated, addition of LPS alone, addition of ATP alone, and finally LPS plus ATP added together. Add 1 mL of the prepared 2.0 x 106 cells/mL diluted whole blood into the appropriate well of a 24-well tissue culture plate.\nThe stimulants should be reconstituted and brought up to room temperature before beginning the stimulation assay. Lyophilized LPS and ATP should be reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following reconstitution, LPS and ATP can be further diluted to a proper stock concentration using incomplete RPMI 1640 media.\nAdd LPS to the LPS only as well as to the LPS plus ATP well so that the final working concentration of LPS is 1 μg/mL. The total stimulation time is 3 hours. However, whole blood is stimulated with LPS for 2 hours and 40 minutes. Samples should be placed in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "ATP is added during the remaining 20 minutes of the 3 hours stimulation period. Add ATP to the ATP alone and the LPS and ATP well and place samples in incubator. The final working concentration of ATP is 2mM.\nAfter the 3 hours incubation period, collect supernatants by aliquoting each sample into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and subsequently centrifuging samples at 10000 rpm for 2 minutes at room temperature. Transfer the supernatants to another set of 1.5 microcentrifuge tubes.\nSamples can be immediately assayed or stored temporarily at -20°C or -80°C for long-term storage.\n4.  Cytokine Assay\nSamples that are frozen need to equilibrate to room temperature before analysis. Cytokine concentrations for IL-1βcan be assessed using a variety of methods. We utilize the Bio-plex Pro human cytokine x-plex assay with the Bio-Plex 200 system, per manufacturer's instructions. In this protocol we are specifically measuring IL-1β; however, we utilize this multiplex cytokine assay in order to simultaneously measure multiple cytokines in one assay with the benefit of using a small sample volume.\n5.  Representative Results\nAnalysis of IL-1β production upon successful stimulation with LPS and ATP shows a dose response dependent on the number of cells being stimulated. We have found that 2.0 x 106 cells/mL is a sufficient concentration to produce an optimal and measurable concentration of IL-1β as well as other cytokines (Figure 2).\nWhole blood assays are useful in studying patients that present with autoinflammatory manifestations. These patients may show a defect in the innate immune system, which can be characterized by overproduction of IL-1β (when compared to controls) upon stimulation with LPS alone (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2662/2662fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
