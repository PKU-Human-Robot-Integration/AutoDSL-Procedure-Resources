    "This research scheme was approved by the local and institutional ethics committee and complies with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before participating. The participants had normal vision or normal correction and no psychiatric or neurological disorders. The participants did not have drug or psychotropic medication using experience and no perm or hair dyeing history within six months. If subjects had excessive artifacts in the EEG data, they were not included in the subsequent data analysis.\n1. Experimental stimuli\nStimuli of the Delay Discounting Task (DDT) task\n\t\nIn the DDT task, divide 34 paper cards into an immediate reward card group and a delayed reward card group.\n\t\tNOTE: There are two cards printed: '10 CNY now' and '20 CNY now,' respectively, in the immediate reward card group. These cards represent that participants will gain the amount of the reward shown on the card immediately. In the delayed reward card group, the remaining 32 cards are printed with 'X CNY 1 month later,' meaning the participant will receive X CNY one month later. There is a group of 16 cards incrementing from 10 to 25 CNY at 1 CNY intervals, each paired with a '10 CNY now' immediate reward card. Another 16-card group ranges from 20 to 35 CNY, increased by 1 CNY, and paired with a '20 CNY now' immediate reward card. In each trial, an immediate reward card and a delayed reward card, e.g., the '10 CNY now' card and the '11 CNY 1 month later' card, will be presented to the subject at the same time to choose. If an immediate card is chosen, the existing delayed reward card will be replaced by a larger amount delayed one to set a new pair of two cards in the next trial.",
    "Stimuli of the gambling task\n\t\nIn the cue phase, ensure that the name of the other participant (in Chinese), Song style, 72 pounds, is displayed in the center of the screen.\nIn the gambling decision-making phase, ensure that two cards are presented symmetrically on the left and right sides of the fixation in the center of the screen. The card (4.76° × 4.76°) has a blue diamond pattern on the back.\nIn the feedback phase, ensure that the outcome of the gambling task (in Chinese), Song style, 72 pounds, black, is shown in the center of the screen. Check that the player's outcome is displayed in an upper position while the other's outcome is in a lower position (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: For the present study, a 2 (time delay: now vs. 1 month) × 4 (social comparison: small fair, large fair, negative unfair, positive unfair) set of gamble results was designed. The gain conditions are analyzed simply to establish a comparative effect because of the existence of the sign effect in intertemporal choices27,28. When presented with an immediate reward, the amount of a small outcome is 10 CNY, and a large one is 20 CNY. When shown a delayed reward, the delayed amount is set according to the indifference points of the previous DDT task. The amount of a small outcome is X1 CNY, and a large one is X2 CNY (see step 2.1 for more details). For example, the negative unfair condition in the immediate reward situation means one gets 10 CNY now, while the other participant gets 20 CNY now. The negative unfair condition in the delayed reward situation means one gets a smaller X1 CNY after 1 month, while the other participant gets a larger X2 CNY after 1 month. The other three conditions are the small fair condition, the large fair condition, and the positive unfair condition. The total of 8 outcomes is provided in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\n,Small Fair condition,Negative Unfair condition,Positive Unfair condition,Large Fair Condition\nNow,10 Vs 10,10 Vs 20,20 Vs 10,20 Vs 20\n1 month,X1 Vs X1,X1 Vs X2,X2 Vs X1,X2 Vs X2\nTable 1: The collection of gambling results.

Experimental procedure\nPerform the first stage task, a DDT task (Figure 2), to measure the participants' indifference points29, before participants perform Electroencephalogram(EEG) recordings.",
    "Give the participant two cards to choose, one of which is a fixed amount of 10 CNY (or 20 CNY) that they could get immediately, and the other card is a variable amount of money which means the participant could obtain after 1 month, and the variable amount is gradually increased 1 CNY for each trial from 10 CNY to 25 CNY (or 20 CNY to 35 CNY). If the participant chooses the card with the immediate reward, he/she continues to the next trial.\nChange the variable amount card to set a new pair of two cards and ask the participant to make a new choice.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment is stopped when the participant chooses the delayed reward card. Then, the amount of the delayed reward card X1 (or X2) is regarded as the indifference point for 1 month later of this participant.\nPerform the second stage task, a gambling ERPs task (Figure 3), to explore the joint effect of social comparison and social distance on evaluating intertemporal choice outcomes.\n\t\nDisplay the fixation in the center of the screen, with a random duration from 400-600 ms.\nDisplay the opponent's name in the cue interface for 1000 ms, to inform the player who will complete the forthcoming gambling task.\nPresent two cards symmetrically on the left and right sides of the fixation in the center of the screen. Ask the player to choose a card with an external numeric keypad. Press 1 on the keypad to choose the left card, and press 3 to choose the right card.\nHighlight the selected card with a red rim for 1000 ms after the participant makes the decision.\nDisplay the outcomes of both the participant and the opponent for 1000 ms.\nDisplay a blank screen for 500 ms.",
    "NOTE: Participants were instructed to engage in a gambling game with either a friend or a stranger. At the start of the game, the participants were presented with the opponent's name to play with. Subsequently, two poker cards appeared on the screen, each capable of winning a certain amount of money, with the value varying over time. The participants were then asked to press a specific button on an external keyboard to select either the left or right card. Once chosen, the selected card would be circled with a red border. Finally, the gambling results of both the participants and their respective matchmakers were presented.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64936/64936fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: The process of the Delay Discounting Task (DDT).

Experimental preparation and electrophysiological recording\nRecruit a pair of participants who are friends and gender-matched. Recruit an extra participant who is completely unfamiliar with either of the other two and gender-matched.Ask only one of the pair of friends to make a response to the task and wear the electrode cap (see Table of Materials); the rest of the two other participants are not required to make any reactions and just observe the screen.\n\tNOTE: 10 pairs of subjects (19 males and 1 female) were recruited from the undergraduate and graduate students of Harbin Engineering University to participate in the experiment, ranging in age from 18 to 28 years old (M = 22.35, SD = ±3.21). Due to excessive artifacts, the data of 2 subjects (1 female) were discarded.",
    "Introduce the equipment and materials required for the experiment and the relevant procedures (including the experimental task and required time) to the participants after arriving at the lab. Help participants understand the basic situation of the experimental process and remove their worries.\nAsk participants to read and sign the informed consent form before the experiment.\nGuide participants to clean their hair with neutral shampoo and dry it completely.\nInstruct participants to enter the experimental room and sit in a comfortable chair ~1 m far from the screen.\nStart the DDT task (step 2.1) to record the indifference points (X1 and X2) of the participant.\nAfter the DDT task, use the alcohol and facial scrub, respectively, to scrub the participant's skin gently for corresponding electrodes on the tip of the nose, as reference electrodes, on the above and below of the left eye about 10 mm, near the outer canthus of both sides and on the left and right mastoids.\nPut the electrode caps with 64 Ag/AgCl electrodes (see Table of Materials) on the participant's head. Ensure that the midline electrodes of the electrode cap coincide with the extension line of the subject's nasal tip.\n\t\nPosition the CZ electrode at the top of the head. Confirm the position of the cap. FP1 and FP2 position is located 2 cm above the root of the participant's nose, and T3, T4 electrodes are placed 2 cm above the ear tip.\nFill the conductive gel and tighten the external electrodes with an adhesive bandage, i.e., the vertical electrooculography electrodes, the horizontal electrooculography electrodes, the mastoid electrodes of M1 and M2, and the reference electrode.\nTighten the strap of the electrode cap on the chin to prevent the electrodes from shifting during the experiment with moderate tightness.",
    "Reduce all electrodes' impedances to below 10 kΩ (the commonly used impedance threshold is 5 kΩ or 10 kΩ). Follow the mentioned procedure:\n\t\nSwitch the recording software (see Table of Materials) to the impedance monitoring interface.\nFill the internal cylindrical space of all electrodes in the cap with conductive gel with a blunt-tipped syringe to ensure that the scalp is properly connected to the electrode.\nObserve the real-time impedance value on the display until the impedance falls below the threshold.\nInform the participants that the experiment will be conducted in a closed and quiet environment, make the participants relax, and avoid excessive blinking and body movement during the experiment.\nDisplay a guide on the screen prior to the beginning of the experiment to keep the participants aware of experimental procedures and appropriate responses.\nStart the gambling task (step 2.2) in the E-prime software (see Table of Materials). Execute 10 practice trials to help the participants understand the experimental procedures.\nImplement the formal experiment session, including 480 trials, and record the EEG signals. Divide all trials into 6 blocks, allowing the participants to take a break of 2 min at the end of each block.\nSave the recorded EEG data and assist the participants in removing the electrode cap. Help the participants wash the conductive gel residue from hair or skin.\nUse the IOS scale30 to measure each participant's degree of self-inclusion in friends or strangers and test the social distance manipulation.\nThank the participants for participating in the experiment and pay them a reward.\n\tNOTE: Each participant was paid 40 Chinese yuan (CNY) for this experiment.\nSubscription Required.
