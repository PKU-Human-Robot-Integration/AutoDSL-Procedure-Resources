    "For this study, ethical committee approval (Comitè Ètic d'Investigació Clínica, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona; approval number HCB/2014/0756) and written, informed consent from all subjects were obtained.\n1. NBD-cholesterol Preparation\nDissolve the NBD-cholesterol (MW 494.63; see Table of Materials) in pure ethanol to obtain the stock (2 mM). For a 10 mg vial, dissolve the entire vial contents in a 10.1 mL volume of ethanol to obtain a 2 mM stock.\nDilute the NBD-cholesterol from the stock in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (R10 medium) to reach a final concentration of 5 μM (e.g., obtain 10 mL of NBD-cholesterol at 5 μM final concentration) by diluting 25 μL of NBD-cholesterol stock (2 mM) in R10 medium. This volume is sufficient for a 96-well plate.\n2. Cell Culture and Seeding (Day-2)\nCulture THP-1 cells in R10 medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Adjust to 0.3 x 106 cells/mL every 3 days.\nSeed the cells in a white 96-well plate with a flat, clear bottom at 0.2 x 106 cells/well in R10 medium (100 μL per well).\nTreat the cells with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; from a 10 μM stock) for 48–72 h, incubating at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to differentiate THP-1 cells into dmTHP-1.\nNOTE: It is recommended to use 5 μL of PMA stock (10 μM) in 500 μL of R10 medium. Prior to this, prepare a 10 μM PMA stock by dissolving a lyophilized 1 g vial in 10 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aliquot, and stock at -20 °C.",
    "Alternatively (suggestion) combine steps 2.2 and 2.3 for better homogenization. Prepare 10 mL of THP-1 cells in a 15 mL tube, add 200 μL of PMA stock (10 μM), mix gently, and immediately seed 100 μL per well onto the plate. Incubate the cells as described in step 2.3.\n3. Apolipoprotein B Depleted Serum (ABDS) Preparation (Day 2 or 3)\nTo prepare a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, dilute glycine in 10% PBS (with sterile H2O) to a concentration of 200 mM at pH 7.4. Add 40 mL of 200 mM glycine to 10 g of PEG 8000 to obtain PEG 20% (w/v). Mix the solution vigorously to homogenize.\nApply 4 parts of 20% PEG per 10 parts of serum/plasma on each serum/plasma sample in a 1.5 mL tube and leave the mixture on ice for 25 min17 (e.g., for 100 μL of plasma or serum, add 40 μL of 20% PEG solution).\nCentrifuge the PEG-apolipoprotein B precipitate at 13,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the precipitate. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\nNOTE: We suggest preparing the ABDS on day 3 (fresh). If it is not possible, prepare the ABDS on day 2 and keep it at 4 °C overnight.\n4. NBD-cholesterol Cell Loading (Day 2)\nDiscard the culture medium of the dmTHP-1 and wash the cells twice with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nLoad the cells with 5 μM NBD-cholesterol (100 μL per well) in R10 medium and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n5. Incubation with Cholesterol Acceptors (Day 3)\nDiscard the medium and wash the cells twice with PBS.",
    "Incubate the cells with 2–5% ABDS or the desired concentration of purified lipid acceptor (HDL, ApoA, ApoE, etc.) diluted in colorless RPMI 1640 medium (100 μL per well) for 4–6 h at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Include a negative control (C-) consisting of colorless RPMI 1640 medium without acceptors and a positive control (C+) (e.g., ABDS from a pool of healthy donors or purified HDLs). Note that the positive control applies particularly when patient samples (disease conditions) are analyzed (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPrepare a 200 mL stock of the cell lysis solution 1 (50 mM Tris buffer, 150 mM NaCl, H2O). Mix the cell lysis solution 1 at 1:1 (v:v) ratio with pure ethanol to obtain the lysis solution 2.\n6. Fluorescent Signal Capture (Day 3)\nMedia NBD-cholesterol detection\nRemove the cell medium from the plates and collect it in a new white 96-well plate with an opaque flat bottom.\nFor an optimal fluorescence signal detection in the media samples, add 100 μL of pure ethanol to 100 μL of each medium sample to obtain a 1:1 ratio in the 96-well white plate.\nKeep the plate with the treated media to further measure the fluorescence intensity (FI) at a 463⁄536 nm (excitation/emission) wavelength in the luminometer.\nIntracellular NBD-cholesterol detection\nWash the cells twice with PBS.\nTo obtain the intracellular cholesterol, lyse the cells by incubating them with 100 μL of lysis solution 2 per well and shake the plate at room temperature (RT) for 25 min.\nFor an optimal fluorescence signal detection in the cell lysate samples, capture the fluorescence intensity of the cell lysates in the same white 96-well plate with clear flat bottom (the same plate in which cells were seeded in step 2.2).",
    "6.3 Measure the fluorescence intensity (FI) in the luminometer while adjusting the sensitivity parameter to 50 in the software (see Table of Materials).\n7. Results Analysis\nExpress the cholesterol efflux rate of a sample as a percentage calculated by the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58891/58891eq1.jpg\nObtain the final measure of cholesterol efflux (CE) by subtracting the CE of the negative control (sample loaded with NBD-cholesterol but incubated with colorless RPMI 1640 medium, without cholesterol acceptors) from the CE of a given samples:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58891/58891eq2.jpg\nSubscription Required.
