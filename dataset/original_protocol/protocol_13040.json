  "procedures": [
    "All the steps of the protocol are described for the 200 kV Glacios TEM system (referred hereafter as 200 kV TEM) equipped with the Selectris-X energy filter (referred hereafter as energy filter) and the Falcon 4 detector (referred hereafter as direct electron detector). The protocol steps are specific for the EPU application, which is the default SPA-data collection software pre-installed on each Glacios system. The protocol steps below correspond to the EPU version 2.14 and small modifications are expected when using a different EPU version. Prerequisites for this protocol are: i) the gun and column alignments are well aligned, ii) the EM calibrations are correct and iii) the EPU auto-functions are correctly calibrated.\n1. Loading grids into the microscope\nNOTE: The 200 kV TEM used in this experiment can hold up to 12 autogrids (i.e., conventional TEM grids clipped into a special cartridge) within a cassette that is loaded inside the Autoloader of the microscope and constantly kept at temperatures below -170 °C to prevent sample devitrification.\nInsert autogrids into the Autoloader cassette under liquid nitrogen conditions.\nInsert the cassette with autogrids into a liquid-nitrogen-cooled transfer capsule.\nInsert the capsule into the microscope and click on the Dock button in the microscope UI to load the cassette from the capsule into the Autoloader of the microscope.\nClick on the Inventory button to check the presence of autogrids in the loaded cassette.\nClick on the Load and Unload buttons to insert autogrids into the column for TEM imaging.\n2. Setting a project in a data management platform (Optional)",
    "NOTE: Sample information and collected data can be organized in the provided data management platform that allows storage of structured data for all connected instruments. A project can be created for which any workflow steps can be defined to capture the images and metadata in an organized way for review and export.\nStart the data management portal application and login with a username and password.\nIn the left panel of the portal UI, click on the Add Project button to create a new project or click on a button of an existing project in the list below to open a project.\nClick on the Add Experiment button to create a new experiment within the opened project.\nFill description in the Metadata panel of the new experiment and click on the Add Workflow button to create a new workflow within the experiment (e.g., Single Particle Analysis).\nOptionally, click on the Add Step button in the middle panel to create a custom-made Workflow or add additional steps to the predefined SPA Workflow (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The steps may represent sample preparation, sample characterization by biochemistry techniques, sample vitrification, screening of cryo-EM grids, data collection sessions, and data analysis.\nOptionally, fill descriptions in the Notes of each step, which may include images and photos.\nCreate a dataset step in the Workflow and select the dataset type as EPU.\n\tNOTE: This will allow the analysis software to place all results data/metadata in the correct place in the data management portal automatically during data acquisition and export the data automatically to the preferred destination while maintaining a complete record of all steps and data transfer.",
    "Fill templates about the Sample and EM grids in the Biochemistry step and associate each grid with a sample (note that one sample can be associated with multiple grids).\nAssociate sample-grids combinations in the metadata section of the Dataset step.\n3. Set up imaging presets and image shift calibrations in the analysis software\nSet imaging parameters for individual imaging modes as shown in Table 1. Considerations for the selection of specific settings are described in detail in the Discussion section.\nSet parallel illumination for the chosen magnification in the Data Acquisition preset of the analysis software\n\tNOTE: There is only one setting of the C2 lens for parallel illumination of the sample at the given SPOT size (i.e., preset strengths of the C1 lens) on 2-condenser TEM systems, such as the 200 kV TEM used in this study. The electron dose rate per unit area (e-/Å2/s) can therefore be adjusted only by changing the SPOT size settings and readjusting the C2-strength (beam intensity) according to the steps below.\n\t\nMove to an area with support carbon foil and thin or no ice.\nSelect the 100 µm or 70 µm objective aperture in the Aperture menu of the TEM UI.\nPress the Diffraction button on the control panels to switch to the diffraction mode.\nInsert the fluorescent screen and change the FluCam mode to High Resolution.\nMove the central diffraction spot to an edge of the aperture. If the aperture edge is not visible, increase the camera length (using the Magnification knob).\nCarefully turn the Focus knob on the control panel to bring the back-focal plane into focus. The back-focal plane is focused when the aperture edge is visibly sharp.\nReduce sensitivity of the FluCam to the lowest level and move the central diffraction spot to the center of the FluCam.",
    "Minimize the size of the central spot using the Intensity knob on the control panel.\nRetract the objective aperture in TEM UI and switch back to the imaging mode.\nClick on the Get button in analysis software to save the settings to the Data Acquisition preset.\nAdjust electron dose rate in the Data Acquisition preset that is optimal for used detector:\n\t\nMove to an empty area on the grid (e.g. a grid square with broken carbon foil)\nClick on the Measure Dose button in analysis software to measure the electron dose rate.\nChange the SPOT size to achieve the optimal dose rate. In the case of the direct electron detector used in this protocol, a dose rate of 4-5 e-/pixel/s is typically used for high-resolution data acquisition. This typically corresponds to the SPOT size 4-6.\nCheck and adjust parallel illumination at the new SPOT size setting as described above.\nSelect EER option under Fractions to use the EER mode on the direct electron detector33.\nClick on the Get button in the analysis software to save the settings to the Data Acquisition preset.\nSwitch to the Autofocus preset and press the Get button to save the illumination settings for focusing. Manually change exposure time to 1 s and binning mode 2.\nSwitch to the Thon Rings preset and press the Get button to save the illumination settings for this preset. Manually change exposure time to 1-2 s and binning mode 2.\nSwitch to the Zero Loss preset and press the Get button to save the illumination settings for this preset. Manually change exposure time to 0.5 s and binning mode 4.\nCalibrate image shifts between the set optical settings as is described in the analysis software manual using the Image Shift Calibration task in the Preparation tab (Supplementary Figure 1).",

Grid mapping and selection of best cryo-EM grids for data collection\nSelect the Atlas tab and click on the New Session button to open a new session.\nFill in details such as session name and data storage location and click on the Apply button to open a new Screening task window, which shows a list of all grids in the Autoloader inventory. Optionally, edit the Names of the grids.\nSelect the grids of interest by selecting a checkbox next to the corresponding grid number.\nClick the Start button to start a fully automated collection of atlases of all selected grids.\nWhen the collection is completed, click on grid labels to review the acquired atlases.",
    "NOTE: Individual grid squares are classified according to their relative ice thickness, which is based on relative greyscale value assessment in each atlas. The classified grid squares are depicted in different color schemes that can be used for guiding the selection of data acquisition areas. A grid produced with a Vitrobot Mk IV will typically display an ice thickness gradient over the whole grid, which might help to identify the ideal ice thickness for data collection. An optimal grid should contain as little transfer ice contamination as possible and exhibit enough unbroken and crack-free grid squares (Figure 3). Grids with suitable ice distribution can be further investigated to assess the distribution of particles in ice at high magnification (i.e., density and orientations of individual particles).\nClick on the Load Sample button in the top menu to insert a chosen grid with suitable ice distribution into the microscope column.\nSelect the Atlas tab, right-click on a suitable grid square in the atlas image and select the option Move stage Here from the dropdown menu to move the stage to the grid square.\nSelect the Auto Functions tab to set the grid square to the Eucentric height. Switch to the Eucentric Height preset, click on the Auto-Eucentric by Beam Tilt auto-function in the middle of the chosen grid square and click on the Start button.\nSwitch to the Grid Square preset and acquire an image. Move the stage to a hole with ice and no or minimal contamination by a right-click and the Move Stage Here option.\nSwitch to the Hole/Eucentric Height preset and acquire an image. Move the stage to a carbon area next to the hole of interest by a right-click and the Move Stage Here option.",
    "Click on the AutoFocus auto-function and set values for the Desired defocus to 0 µm and Iterate to -2 µm. Switch to the Autofocus preset and click on the Start button.\nSelect the Preparation tab again and switch to the Hole/Eucentric Height preset. On the previously acquired hole image, select an area of interest within the hole and move the stage to this position by right-clicking and selecting the Move Stage Here option.\nSwitch to the Data Acquisition preset and set the waiting time after beam shift to 0.5 s and the waiting time after stage move to 20 s. Acquire an image using defocus between -3 µm and -5 µm to boost low-resolution contrast for better visualization of individual particles.\nOptionally, repeat steps 4.7-4.13 to image particles in different holes and different grid squares with different ice thicknesses as needed.\nOnce the most suitable grid for high-resolution data collection is identified and selected, click the Load Sample button in the top menu to load the selected grid into the TEM.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, if more information is needed and/or automation of this screening process is desired, perform section 5.\n5. Setting up a data collection session in the single particle analysis software\nNOTE: If using the gold foil grids, refinement of objective astigmatism and coma alignments (section 6) may not work reliably. It is advised to load a carbon foil grid or cross-grating EM grid and perform these final alignments before setting up data collection.\nSelect the EPU tab and click on the Session Creation button to create a new session in the left panel. Select the New Session option to use current optical presets or the New from Preferences option to load previously exported session set-up.\nFill in session name and data storage location.",
    "NOTE: This location will be used for saving integrated images and metadata from the data collection session in a subfolder with the session name. Although these data will not take up a significant amount of storage space, it is recommended to save these data on the Falcon offload data storage of the DMP server as the EER camera frames are always stored in the root directory of this data storage in a directory with the session name.\nSelect the Manual type of the session to have control over the selection of individual holes in grid squares selected for data collection later in the protocol.\nSelect the Faster acquisition mode to use aberration-free image shifting (AFIS) for data collection to reduce stage movements between individual holes, reduce overall sample drift and increase the throughput of data collection without deterioration of image quality.\nSelect the default mrc format of saved integrated images.\nSpecify the used grid and its type. This protocol used the R-1.2/1.3 UltraAufoil for apo-ferritin and the R-2/1 Quantifoil grid for the 20S proteasome. Select Quantifoil under Specimen carrier and R1.2/1.3 or 2/1 under Quantifoil Type.\nOPTIONAL: Click on the Athena Login button in the bottom right corner to utilize EPU Quality Monitor (EQM).\n\t\nEnter login details in the browser pop-up window to activate the settings section in the Session Setup overview.\nClick on the Select button in the settings section and browse for the previously created dataset (Protocol section 2) to associate it with the current data collection. Toggle the Enable Quality Monitor check box on.\nClick on the Apply button to create a new session.",
    "NOTE: This action will open new tasks in the left column menu. At any point during the session, if some details are incorrect, it is possible to return to the Session Setup task, change/update the details and click on Apply again to update the session.\nSelect the Square Selection task in the left panel to show the collected atlas of the grid.\nOptionally, double click on any tile of the atlas to see a higher quality image to better judge ice quality in the grid squares. Double click again on the image to return to the grid atlas.\nIdentify grid squares with the following characteristics (Figure 4): (i) The support foil in the grid square is intact without damage, (ii) Vitreous thin ice in foil-holes (the holes appear brighter than the support carbon foil), (iii) As little crystalline ice contamination (black speckles) in the grid square as possible, (iv) Minimal brightness gradient across the grid square and within individual foil-holes.\n\tNOTE: With the presets chosen and with a good grid, the 200 kV cryo TEM used in this study can image at a rate of ~200-300 movies/h. With that in mind, select as many squares as needed, or add more later by returning to the square selection task according to the amount of microscope time is available. For reference, 3000 movies were collected for achieving 1.6 Å resolution of apo-ferritin.\nSelect grid squares for data collection either in the full atlas or high-quality tile images\n\t\nRight-click on a grid square of interest and choose the Select option in the context menu\nAlternatively, hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and left-click on the desired grid squares\nConversely, right-click and Unselect or hold the Shift key and left-click to remove squares",
    "NOTE: The next steps are critical for ensuring that data collection results in a high-resolution reconstruction. Start selection of holes in the grid square with a thin ice layer. Right-click on this grid square and select the option Select Holes to begin the Hole Selection task.\nSelect the Hole Selection task in the left panel to select holes in the selected grid squares.\nClick on the Auto-Eucentric button to automatically move to the first selected grid square, adjust the Eucentric height and acquire a grid square image for finding foil-holes.\nClick on the Find Holes button to find foil-holes in the image.\n\tNOTE: If hole-finding did not work well (i.e., there are either skipped holes or incorrectly sized holes in the image), check that correct values were input in the Quantifoil Type entry of the Session Setup task and find holes again. If holes are still not found correctly, click on the Measure Hole Size button to set the hole diameter and distance manually and find holes again.\nClick on the Remove Holes button close to the grid bar button to deselect holes near grid bars.\nAdjust limits in the brightness histogram of the Ice filter (at the bottom right of the software window) to remove all holes with too thick ice (using the left limit line) as well as all empty holes (using the right limit line) as shown in Figure 4.\n\tNOTE: For refinement, specific intensity values can be also entered in the corresponding text boxes next to the Apply button.",
    "Optionally, use the Selection Brush to refine the selection of holes manually: Left click and drag the brush to deselect unwanted holes. Hold the Ctrl key and left-click to can reselect foil holes. Hold the Shift key and scroll with the mouse wheel to adjust the brush size.\nSelect a hole for setting and testing a data acquisition template that will be used repeatedly throughout data collection: Right-click on a hole in the grid square image and select the option Move Stage to Location.\nSelect the Template Definition task in the left panel.\nSelect the Hole/Eucentric preset and click on the Acquire button to acquire an image.\nClick on the Find and Center Hole button to center a hole in the image.\nSet values for Delay After Image Shift to 0.5 s (default) and Delay After Stage Shift to 20 s.\n\tNOTE: As the parallel beam diameter is fixed on the 200 kV cryo-TEM system used in this study and typically corresponds to 1.6-1.7 µm with a 50-µm aperture, only 1 image can be acquired per hole using the R-1.2/1.3 grids and 2 images per hole (near opposite edges) using the R-2/1 or R-2/2 grids. Please note that the size of the set acquisition areas on the screen does not correspond to the actual beam diameter. The image scale bar can be utilized to estimate an appropriate placement distance.\nSelect the Add Acquisition Area button and click on the image to select the location in the centered hole where high-magnification image acquisition will be taken from.\nSelect the Add Autofocus Area button and click on the image to select the location on the support foil next to the centered hole where image autofocus will be performed.",
    "NOTE: The beam size for focusing is 1.6-1.7 µm and should be placed equidistantly from neighboring holes on carbon.\nClick on the green acquisition area to set a sequence of defocus values in the Defocus List in the top section of the software window. Enter the highest defocus as first to enhance visualization of particles in a test run of the following Template Execution task.\nClick on the blue autofocus area to set the autofocus-specific settings in the same area:\n\t\nChoose the option After Centering to autofocus at the start of each AFIS cluster.\nChoose the option Objective Lens for faster autofocusing and reduced stage drift.\nSelect the Template Execution task and click on the button Execute.\n\t\nObserve individual steps of the data acquisition procedure (center the hole, autofocus in the area selected, and image acquisition in the set areas) and check the quality of imaged particles in the final high-magnification image.\nClick the FFT button in the bottom right of the high magnification image window to check the FFT image and visually assess whether Thon rings show multiple oscillations and extend to high resolution in the FFT image.\nIf the template execution is completed successfully, click on the Prepare All Squares button in the Hole Selection task to have data collection set automatically in all other selected grid squares according to the used settings in this first grid square.\n6. Final microscope alignments before starting data collection",
    "NOTE: To achieve the best high-resolution results, the most sensitive alignments should be done exactly at the same settings as the Data Acquisition mode in the data collection software and just before starting the actual data acquisition. These alignments should be done at a position with thin support carbon of the grid, sufficiently distant from any grid bars, and aligned at the Eucentric height.\nSelect the Template Execution task, acquire a new image and move with the stage to a clean area on carbon foil by a right-click and select the menu option Move Stage Here.\nSelect the Auto Functions tab and set the Desired defocus to 0 µm and Iterate to -2 µm. Switch to the Autofocus preset and click on the Start button to run the Autofocus function.\nPut the fluorescent screen down and open the menu of Direct Alignments in the TEM UI.\nFor best results, experienced users may verify pivot point alignments: Choose the nP Beam Tilt pp X task in the Direct Alignments menu and maximally overlap the bouncing beams using the Multifunction knobs on the control panels. Repeat for the np Beam Tilt pp Y task.\nClick on the EF button in the fluorescent screen camera menu to show a green circle that indicates the energy-filter entrance aperture and center the beam over the green circle.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the Turbo pump is stopped before continuing; vibrations from it reduce the number of visible thon rings and frequently cause the auto functions to fail.\nGo back to the software window and select the Auto Functions tab in the menu bar.",
    "Select the Autostigmate task, switch to the Thon Ring preset, and press the Start button. Observe the process to make sure that (i) the images taken are on carbon, (ii) the Thon-rings are clearly visible, and (iii) the calculated CTF fit (dotted lines) are well placed at the Thon-ring minima (Supplementary Figure 2).\nSelect the Autocoma task and press the Start button. Observe the process to make sure that the images taken are on carbon and that the Thon rings are clearly visible and that the calculated fits (dotted lines) are well placed at the Thon-ring minima. Zoom into each Thon-ring image using the mouse scroll wheel (Supplementary Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: If the microscope is equipped with an energy filter, energy filter tuning should be done as part of the alignment sequence to center the filter slit to the zero-loss peak and to correct any distortions in the prism of the energy filter (steps 6.9-6.14). These alignments should be done at an empty area of the grid, such as inside a broken grid square.\nOpen Sherpa UI and select the Energy Filter application (Supplementary Figure 4).\nSet the camera to EF-Falcon, bin 4x, exposure time 0.2 s in the Settings window.\nClick on the Center button in the Zero Loss option to center the zero-loss energy filter slit.\nClick on the Tune button in the Isochromaticity option (Supplementary Figure 4).\nClick on the Tune Magnification and Tune Distortions in the option of Geometric and Chromatic Distortions (Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 6)\nIf results are not within indicated specifications and shown in red color in the output report, iterate the alignments from step 6.11 again.",
    "NOTE: Although the direct electron detector gain reference can be stable over months, a new gain reference should be taken using the Falcon 4 Reference Image Manager if images of empty areas do not show uniform intensity but exhibit stripes or other distinct features. Alternatively, calculate a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of such an image and ensure that no lines are visible.\nIn the software window, select the Preparation tab and switch to the Data Acquisition preset.\nSet the dose setting to 40 e-/Å2 and click on the Measure the Dose Rate button.\nGo to the EPU tab, select the Automated Acquisition task, and optionally check the Auto Zero Loss function; click on the Start Run button to begin fully automated data collection.\n7. Monitoring and optimization of data quality during data collection\nNOTE: While data collection is ongoing, collected data can be monitored using the EQM through the data management portal. EQM performs motion correction and CTF determination on-the fly and displays the results in the portal. The user is then able to judge the quality of individual acquisitions, see graphs on various quality indicators, filter out unwanted acquisitions and export the data to their final storage either on the fly or as a batch job.\nNavigate to the dataset that analysis software places the data to using a web browser.\nIn the dataset overview, acquisition cards display the information about motion correction and CTF determination in a graphic format. Click on individual cards to get more information.\nEnable the DataViz panel to show aggregated graphs from the full dataset that show the defocus, astigmatism, and CTF confidence range per acquisition (Supplementary Figure 7).",
    "Use the filters on top of the panel to select only the data that are within the requested defocus range, have astigmatism close to zero, and the CTF can be determined up to the specified (target) resolution. Once the filters are set up, press the Apply button to display only the chosen data in the dataset overview window.\nWhen most of the acquired images are within the set criteria, let the data collection session continue to completion. If only a very small fraction of the acquired images fulfill the set criteria, either re-configure the analysis software settings, move to another area on the sample (press the Next Grid Square button in analysis software), or stop the data collection."
