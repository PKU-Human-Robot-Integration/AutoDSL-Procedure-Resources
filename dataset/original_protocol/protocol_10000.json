    "1. Sample Preparation\nNOTE: Steps 1.1-1.8 are performed just once\nPrepare 1 mL of stock 13C-enriched pyruvic acid solution, widely used for in vivo research1,2,5,6, consisting of 15-mmol/L of triarylmethyl radical dissolved in [1-13C]pyruvic acid (see Table of Materials). Aliquots from this stock solution will be used for the samples that will be individually polarized and subsequently undergo relaxometry at different magnetic fields. A representation of the [1-13C]pyruvic acid molecule is shown in Figure 1.\nOn the dynamic nuclear polarizer software interface (see Table of Materials), click on the Cooldown button to lower the temperature of the variable temperature insert (VTI) to 1.4 K.\nOnce the DNP has reached the desired temperature, load 10 µL of the stock solution in a sample cup, open the turret doors and insert the cup into the VTI using an insertion wand specifically designed for this task.\nAfter that, quickly extract the wand and make sure the cup is released. Then close the turret doors and continue with the following steps while the temperature of the VTI goes back to 1.4 K.\nPrepare the DNP to run a microwave sweep in order to find the optimal RF frequency for hyperpolarization of the stock solution.\n\t\nOn the computer controlling the spectrometer (part of the DNP system), establish the communication between the spectrometer and the DNP control software by double-clicking on HyperTerminal icon, previously configured with the appropriate serial communication parameters.\nOnce the communication is established, launch the RINMR software, type in its command line .HYPERSENSENMR, and then press enter.\nAfter that, a new window will be shown on the screen and on it type the number one (1) in the Configuration Number field. Then, click on the Select Configuration button.",
    "Click on the button Do microwave sweep. A small window with a descending counter of seconds will be launched indicating that the spectrometer is ready and it will be waiting for periodic trigger signals, coming from the DNP control software, to sample the polarization.\nOn the DNP control software, select the Calibrate tab and click on the Generate button.\nUsing the calibration setup window, enter the following information: Start Frequency = 94.117 GHz, End Frequency = 94.137 GHz, Step Size = 1 MHz, Step Duration = 300 s, Power = 50 mW, Liquid Helium Level = 65%, and Temperature = 1.4 K.\nClick on the button Generate, which will close the setup window and return to the Calibrate tab that will display the number of steps and the time required to perform the desired microwave sweep.\nOnce the desired VTI temperature is achieved, click the Enable button and then Start to initialize the microwave sweep process.     \nAt the end of the microwave sweep, recover the sample and record the optimal frequency where the maximum polarization is achieved. This optimal frequency is defined as the polarization frequency that provides the maximum polarization as shown in Figure 2. This frequency will be used for hyperpolarizing all the aliquots obtained from that specific stock solution of pyruvic acid.\nPrepare 250 mL of stock dissolution medium using a solution of 40-mmol/L Tris base, 50 mmol/L of sodium chloride, and 80-mmol/L sodium hydroxide in de-ionized water. Add ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at a concentration of 100 mg/L to sequester any metal ion contamination. Similarly to the pyruvic acid stock solution, this dissolution medium will be used for all the different samples that will be polarized. Refer to the Table of Materials for more specific details regarding the chemicals used.",
    "Also, prepare 500 mL of stock cleaning solution consisting of 100 mg/L EDTA dissolved in deionized water. Approximately 10 mL of this cleaning solution is used after each polarization to clean the dissolution path of the DNP.\n\tNOTE: Steps 1.9-1.27 are performed for each individual sample.\nCool the DNP apparatus to 1.4 K in preparation of hyperpolarizing a [1-13C]pyruvic acid sample by pressing the Cooldown button in the DNP main window.\nIf the software used for the spectrometer is already active with configuration 1 selected, proceed with the following steps. Otherwise, perform steps 1.5.1 to 1.5.3 and then continue with the following steps.\nAfter verifying that configuration 1 is selected in the window controlling the DNP's spectrometer, click on the Solid Build Up button.\nEnter the file name SSBuilupXXX, where \"XXX\" is a number in the sequence of files stored with build-up data. This number is automatically incremented by the software. Then click OK. Similarly to the microwave sweep case, a small window with a descending counter of seconds will be launched indicating that the spectrometer is ready and it will be waiting for periodic trigger signals, coming from the DNP control software, to sample the polarization.\nUsing the pyruvic acid - OX063 stock solution prepared in step 1.1, weigh out 30 mg in a sample cup.\nWhen the desired VTI temperature is achieved (1.4 K) click on Insert Sample, then select Normal Sample and then click on Next. Following the safety precautions displayed on the screen, insert the cup in the cold DNP apparatus, using a long wand specifically designed for this task.",
    "Once the cup is inserted, the wand removed, and the DNP doors closed, click Next and then Finish. At that point the hyperpolarizer system lowers the sample cup to the irradiation chamber partially filled (65%) with liquid helium.\nWait until the temperature has returned to 1.4K and then click on the Polarize Sample button.\nIn the new pop up window, set the frequency value to that obtained from the microwave sweep in step 1.6. In the same window, also set the power to 50 mW and the sampling time to 300 s. Click on Next, check the Enable Build-up Monitoring box, and then click on Finish.\n\tNOTE: Once the polarization is started, the DNP control software generates trigger signals every 300 s to instruct the spectrometer to sample the polarization using a small tip angle. That way, the spectrometer software adds a sample point to a solid-state magnetization curve, now displayed in both the spectrometer software and in the DNP control software under the tab Polarization Build-Up. After the 4th sample and every sample after that, the spectrometer software fits the curve to an exponential growth function of the form:\n\tS = A *exp(-t/Tp) + y0\n\twhere A is the polarization amplitude, in arbitrary units, t is the sampling time, Tp is the polarization time constant (both in seconds), and y0 is an offset. Based on the fitted parameters, the software also calculates the percentage polarization achieved up to that point in time, which is also displayed in the DNP's Polarization Status tab.\nPolarize until the build-up of the solid-state magnetization reaches at least 95% of maximum (approximately one hour).\nWhile the sample is polarizing, prepare the Fast-Field-Cycling Relaxometer as explained in Section 2 below.",
    "When the desired polarization is achieved, click on Run Dissolution and under Method, select Pyruvic Acid Test. Then, click on Next.\nFollowing the instructions on the screen, open the DNP turret doors and load the heating and pressurizing chamber at the top of the apparatus with ~ 4.55 mL of the dissolution medium prepared in section 1.5 to produce a concentration of 80-mmol/L pyruvate upon dissolution at a pH of ~7.75 and temperature of ~37 °C.\nPosition the recovering wand in the right position, close the turret doors, and at the computer click on Next and then on Finish. At that point the dissolution media will be superheated until the pressure reaches 10 bar.\nOnce the 10 bar pressure is attained, the frozen and hyperpolarized pyruvate is automatically lifted from the liquid helium bath, quickly mixed, and thawed with the superheated dissolution media and ejected through a capillary tubing into a pear-shaped flask. While the hyperpolarized pyruvate/dissolution media mixture is ejected, constantly swirl the flask to ensure a homogeneous mixture.\nWhen all the mixture has been ejected, quickly draw 1.1 mL of the liquid into a syringe, transfer to a pre-warmed (37 °C) 10-mm-diameter NMR tube, and rapidly transport to the field-cycling relaxometer (See step 2.2.12).\nDispense the remaining aliquot of every pyruvate dissolution into a 0.55-T benchtop NMR spectrometer (see Table of Materials) to check for possible systematic experimental effects.\nImmediately clean DNP fluid path using clean dissolution medium followed by ethanol. Blow helium gas through fluid path to remove remaining cleaning fluids and purge path of oxygen. Clean all glassware.\nAfter each measurement, record the pH of samples from both the bench top spectrometer and the field-cycling relaxometer.",
    "NOTE: Each T1 measurement is a separate hyperpolarized dissolution from the DNP apparatus, so care is required to assure measurement-to-measurement reproducibility of the sample composition. This is accomplished by weighing all agents and solvents with a precision of 0.1 mg to assure accurate and reproducible preparation of the final hyperpolarized solutions.\n2. Relaxometry\nNOTE Please refer to Table 1 for a better understanding of the selection and use of the different parameters described in the following steps. Prior to dissolution, the relaxometer flip angle must be calculate and the relaxometer must be setup and ready for measurement of the hyperpolarized solution (see below).\nFlip-angle calibration \nPrepare 1 mL of neat [1-13C]pyruvic acid in an NMR tube and add a gadolinium contrast agent to reduce the T1 of the 13C nuclei to a value of less than 200 ms but more than 50 ms.\nSeal the NMR tube so it can be used multiple times as a calibration standard.\nUsing the depth gauge of the relaxometer, set the depth of insertion of the NMR tube to the proper height to ensure the sample will be located at the center of the relaxometer RF coil.\nMark the insertion depth of the 13C pyruvate calibration standard with adhesive tape to ensure repeatability.\nPlace the depth stopper on the NMR tube to the position indicated by the tape and insert this calibration standard into the bore of the field-cycling relaxometer. Use a weight to keep the NMR tube in position.\nOpen the instrument air valve and from the relaxometer front panel set the temperature controller to 37 °C. That will maintain the temperature of the sample at 37°C (± 0.5°C) using heated air during the experiment.",
    "Setup the field-cycling relaxometer hardware to acquire 13C nuclei signals. That includes installing and energizing the external shim coil (see Table of Materials), tuning and matching the RF coil to 8 MHz (~0.75 T for 13C nuclei), and using the appropriate λ/4 cable.\nIn the instrument software, perform the following steps:\n\t\t\nSelect the Main par tab\nClick on the cell next to the label Experiment and scroll down in the pop-up window to select the pulse sequence \"13CANGLE.FFC \".\nSet the following acquisition parameters: RFA = 5; SWT = 0.005, RD = 0.5, BPOL = 30 MHz, TPOL = 0.5.\nSelect the Acq. par tab and then select the Basic sub-tab.\nClick on the cell next to the label Nucleus and scroll down in the pop-up window to select 13C.\nThen, set the following parameters: SF = 8 MHz, SW = 1000000, BS = 652, FLTR = 100000, MS = 32.\nSelect the Conf sub-tab.\nSet the following parameters: RINH = 25, ACQD = 25.\nSelect the nDim sub-tab\nSet NBLK = 32, BINI = 2, BEND = 62.\nSelect the Evaluation tab and then the Parameters sub-tab.\nSet the following parameters: EWIP = 10, EWEP = 128, EWIB = 1, EWEB = 32.\nThen, click the Start Acquisition icon to run the pulse sequence.\nOnce the acquisition is finished, save the data, select the Evaluation dialog icon and from the analysis menu select WAM Window: Absolute Magnitude. Then select Report Sheet, Graphs and Export File and finally click on Execute.",
    "In the Report window find the RF pulse width that provides the maximum amplitude and fine-tune the value with the help of the cursor in the displayed graph, which is similar to the plots shown at the bottom row of Figure 3. This pulse width will be used for the parameter PW90 of the following experiments.\nClick the F1 icon to adjust the frequency shift of the relaxometer.\n\t\tNOTE: WAM Window: Absolute Magnitude is a procedure to integrate the magnitude of a single or a sequence of free-induction decay acquisitions (FIDs) from the point defined by EWIP to the point specified by EWEP and from the block defined by EWIB to the block specified by EWEB.\nT1-Measurements \nMake sure the external shim coil is installed and energized.\nIn the instrument software perform the following steps:\n\t\t\nSelect the Main par tab\nClick on the cell next to the label Experiment and scroll down in the pop-up window to select the pulse sequence HPUB/S, which is shown in Figure 4.\nSet the following acquisition parameters: RFA = 25, T1MX = values between 3 and 5; SWT = 0.2, RD = 0, BRLX = Desired relaxation field in MHz (proton Larmor frequency).\nSelect the Acq. par tab and then select the Basic sub-tab.\nClick on the cell next to the label Nucleus and scroll down in the pop-up window to select 13C.\nThen, set the following parameters: SF = 8 MHz, SW = 1000000, BS = 652, FLTR = 50000.\nSelect the Conf sub-tab.\nSet the following parameters: PW90 equal to the value found in step 2.1.10, RINH = 25, ACQD = 25.\nSelect the Puls sub-tab and set PW = 5.\nSelect the nDim sub-tab and set NBLK = 100.",
    "Wait and get ready to receive the hyperpolarized solution to initiate the data acquisition.\nImmediately before inserting the sample into the relaxometer, manually start the pulse sequence from the console, to avoid inserting the sample into a null magnetic field. For this reason, it is important to ignore the first Free Induction Decay (FID) during the data analysis.\nOnce the acquisition is done, save the data by clicking the Save button.\nUsing the analysis software, integrate the magnitude of each FID signal to produce a data series comprised of sample magnetization as a function of time.\nExtract the spin-lattice relaxation time from a three-parameter exponential model using a standard non-linear least-squares fitting algorithm implemented in a commercial analytical software (see Table of Materials) assuming even weighting for all data:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59399/59399eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere A is the initial signal amplitude (y-intercept), T1 is the spin-lattice relaxation time, TR is the repetition time, which is a known value, y0 is the signal offset, and cos(n-1)(α) is a correction for loss of longitudinal magnetization at the nth measurement for a flip angle, α.\nSubscription Required.
