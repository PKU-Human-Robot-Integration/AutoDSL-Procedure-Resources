    "The following protocol follows the animal care guidelines of the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of Specimens Using a Porcine Stomach\nNOTE: The first step is to prepare specimens to be used in the ex vivo model (Figure 1). The thickness of the porcine gastric wall varies in different areas of the stomach. Use the upper third of the porcine stomach, which is relatively similar to the human stomach. Exclude inappropriate specimens where submucosal elevation is not found due to fibrosis.\nCut gastric specimens into squares with approximate dimensions of 6 × 6 cm.\nStore the gastric specimens immediately at a temperature of -30 °C.\nThaw frozen gastric specimens right before the measurement procedure to ensure uniform measurement conditions.\n2. Detailed Setup Methodology of a New Ex Vivo Model\nNOTE: Stretch out the thawed specimen on a board in two different ways. In the conventional ex vivo model, fix the specimen with pins (Figure 1A)19,20,21,22. On the other hand, in the new ex vivo model, fix or stretch both ends of the specimen with clips to produce a constant tension (Figure 1B, C). All parts of the new model are easy to obtain, and the setup of the new model can be completed quickly (Figure 2). The procedure of the new model is as follows (Figure 3):\nConnect the stainless-steel clip and the key wire and the S shaped hook (Figure 3A).\nConnect the wire and the S shaped hook and the weight (Figure 3A).\nConnect the hook to the other end of the wire. A traction device is completed in the above process (Figure 3B).\nFix the pulleys (Figure 2b) at both ends of the base (Figure 3C).\nPlace the rubber plate (6 x 6 cm) on the center of the base (Figure 3C).",
    "Place the gastric specimen on the rubber plate and pinch the specimen ends with the clip of the traction device.\nHang the weight through the pulley (both side). Thereby, constant tension can be applied to the specimen (Figure 4).\nStart the measurement of SEH, because after the setup of the new model is completely finished (See Step 3 below).\n3. Evaluation of SIM Performance\nNOTE: In this study, we used normal saline (NS) and 0.4% sodium hyaluronate (HA) as SIMs to be tested, and measure SEH of the two SIMs. Three independent measurements are performed. The obtained data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (S.D.). Statistical analysis was performed by using the statistical analysis software (GraphPad Prism 7). We analyzed continuous variables (SEH) with the Student's t-test, and the magnitudes with P < 0.05 were considered significant. The measurement of SEH is as follows (Figure 5).\nPerform zero-point adjustment of the height gauge, based on the height of mucosa before a submucosal elevation procedure. In detail, perform zero-point adjustment by pushing the PRESET button after fixing the scriber at the height of the mucosal surface.\nInject 2.0 mL of each solution horizontally into the submucosa from the specimen margins using a 2.5-mL syringe and 23-gauge needle, to perform a submucosal elevation procedure (Figure 5A-C).\nMeasure SEH promptly using a digital height gage at 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min after the injection (Figure 5D). In detail, record the height displayed on the height gauge when fixing the scriber to the top of the submucosal elevation.\nPerform three independent measurements, and express the obtained results as the mean and standard deviation.",
    "Analyze the obtained data using appropriate statistical software and evaluate the performance of SIMs (The performance can be compared between each SIM.)\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
