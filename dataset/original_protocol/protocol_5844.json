    "TimelineTimepoint: 0 hNkx2-1-GFP mouse ESCs or iPSCs are cultured in 2i_LIF (serum-free, feeder-free) conditions. For each experiment, a new vial of passage 23 is thawed and cells are used after two passages.Seed 500,000 Nkx2-1-GFP mouse ESCs or iPSCs (in suspension) per P100 Petri dish with 12.5 ml/dish cSFDM.During this period of time ESCs or iPSCs will form embryoid bodies (EBs) between 100-300 μm that will remain in suspension.Timepoint: 60 hCollect EBs from one dish in a 50-ml conical, let EBs settle for 1-2 min and carefully remove most of the supernatant containing dead cells and debris.Spin 5 min, 300 x g, 4 °C.Aspirate off supernatant.Add 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA per tube, incubate at 37 °C water bath for 1 minute while swirling the tube.Disaggregate EBs to form single cell suspension by gentle trituration.Add 1 ml serum to block the trypsin.Add 4 ml IMDM.Spin 5 min, 300 x g, 4°C.Resuspend the cells in 5 ml cSFDM.Count cells.Plate 0.5-1 x 106 cells (in suspension) per P100 or P150 Petri dish in 25 ml cSFDM supplemented with 50 ng/ml Activin A for definitive endoderm induction and EB formation.Timepoint: 120 h (Day 5)Perform staining for surrogate definitive endoderm markers (Cxcr4/cKit, see FACS protocol) to confirm efficient definitive endoderm induction (more than 40-50% of cells should be Cxcr4+/cKit+).Collect EBs and wash in IMDM.Spin 5 min, 300 x g, 4 °C.Resuspend in 10-15 ml of Anteriorization media and plate in suspension in new P100 Petri dish.Timepoint: 144 h (Day 6)Collect EBs.Wash in IMDM.Spin 5 min, 300 x g, 4 °C.Get cell count by trypsinizing a 1 ml aliquot of EBs to get single cells and calculating total cell number equivalent.Resuspend in ventralization media.Plate the EB equivalent of 50,000 cells/cm2 on gelatin--coated plates or dishes (e.g. 100,000/well of a 24--well plate).",
    "For coating procedure see step 2 below.Change media every other day.GFP+ will start emerging by Days 8-9.Timepoint: Day 15Remove ventralization media and add appropriate volume of trypsin (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate or 3-4 ml per P100 dish).Transfer cells from several wells in a 50-ml conical, create a single cell suspension by gentle trituration and inactivate with an equal volume of FBS.Resuspend in PBS+ (PBS+2% FBS).Sort GFP+ cells.Spin 7 min, 500 x g, 4 °C (note the change in centrifuge settings).Replate 25,000 cells/cm2 (e.g. 50,000 cells/well of a 24-well plate) in cSFDM supplemented with FGF2 (250 ng/ml), FGF10 (100 ng/ml) and heparin salt (100 ng/ml).Change media every other day for 7 days.Timepoint: Day 22Remove media and rinse with PBS.Switch to DCI+K media.Harvest cells on Day 25 (procedure same as on Day 15).Gelatin coatingApply 0.1% gelatin (dissolved in ultrapure water) for 25-30 min at room temperature (e.g. 1 ml in a well of a 6-well plate). Aspirate gelatin, rinse with PBS and aspirate again. The plate is now ready to use.FACS for Cxcr4/cKitCell countRemove 1 ml of EBs, spin down and trypsinize (0.5 ml trypsin), count cells.Based on previous cell count, remove a culture volume that corresponds to 2‐2.5 x 106 cells.Repeat procedure for undifferentiated ES cells.Preparation of cells for staining (all steps on ice)Spin down EBs, resuspend in 1 ml trypsin (60 sec at 37 °C), monodisperse with a P1000 pipette.Inactivate with 1 ml serum, spin down (5 min, 300 x g, 4 °C) and wash once with 5 ml IMDM.Resuspend in 500 μl PBS+ (PBS+2% FBS), cell concentration should be 0.4 - 0.5 x 106 cells/100 μl.",
    "Prepare 2 x 5 Eppendorf tubes (unstained, isotypes, Cxcr4, cKit, Cxcr4/cKit (double)), mark each tube series (D5 endoderm or undifferentiated ES cells) and transfer 100 μl of each culture to each tube.Cell stainingAdd the appropriate antibodies per tube (e.g. no antibodies in the “unstained” tube, both antibodies in the “double” tube). Antibodies used for this protocol as of 08/15/12:Isotype: APC Rat IgG2b, κIsotype: PE Rat IgC2b, κCxcr4: APC Rat α-mouse CD184cKit: PE Rat α-mouse CD117 Vortex briefly and transfer on ice for 30 min (cover with aluminum foil, vortex once again at 15 min).Add 1 ml PBS+ per tube, spin at 300 x g for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge, carefully aspirate supernatant.Resuspend pellet in 500 μl PBS+.Transfer to FACS polystyrene tubes with the cell strainer cap.Take cells to LSRII for analysis."
