Because of this complementarity, SRv.1 and SRv.1.2 are similar in overall molecular weight. The overall molecular weight of labeled mRNA complexes for SRv.1.1 is approximately 35% smaller than for SRv.1 and SRv.1.2, as described in (Guo and Lee, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). For all SunRISER variants, the mRNA:protein composition of the labeled mRNA is balanced for optimal signal-to-background. The user can therefore select a SunRISER variant that works best with their application. For example, extending shorter mRNAs with a smaller stem-loop array reduces sequence perturbations, which may be favorable, but may not necessarily lead to the best mRNA detection. The choice of SunRISER variant should ultimately weigh the particular application and experimental goals against empirical imaging results.\nBased on the stem-loop lengths, choose the corresponding SunTag array lengths. (SRv.1: 24×PP7-5×SunTag; SRv.1.1: 8×PP7-10×SunTag; SR.v1.2: 10×PP7-12×SunTag).\nChoose the plasmid version suitable for your system.",
    "Note: In SunRISER, we provide both a single plasmid encoding both scFv-GFP and pcp-nxSunTag and a version where the two constructs are on separate plasmids (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Separate plasmids can be useful in determining proper expression ratios are achieved as well as to alleviate any unexpected complications that could arise from a double-expression plasmid.\nCalculate the amount of each component based on the selected version of SunRISER.\nCritical: For three-plasmids, equal molar amounts of each plasmid (1:1:1) is optimal. Since the three plasmids as supplied have comparable size, this also works out to a 1:1:1 weight ratio. Similarly, a 1:1 molar ratio is optimal for the two-plasmid version. For the 2-plasmid version as supplied, note that a 1:1 molar ratio equates to a 1.5:1 weight ratio because the double expression plasmid as supplied is approximately 1.5× the size of the detection plasmid. This ratio may change depending on the size of the GOI.\nSeed HeLa cells in 96-well imaging plates.\nSeed 1 × 104 HeLa cells per well of 96-well glass bottom imaging plates (Matriplate; .17 mm Flat Clear Glass Bottom) in 300 μL of DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, and 1% L-glutamine).\nNote: While culture conditions for HeLa cells as described in this protocol do not require coating (fibronectin, collagen, etc.), other cell lines may. We do not expect any compatibility issues in imaging SunRISER with cell lines using fibronectin, poly-L and poly-D lysine. Other coatings such as collagen should be tested to ensure they do not have autofluorescence properties that interfere with fluorescence imaging.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator overnight (18–24 h) to allow cells to recover and adhere to the plate at approximately 70% confluency.\nTransfect cells with SunRISER plasmids using FuGENE® HD following manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.promega.com/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/101/fugene-hd-transfection-reagent-protocol/].",
    "Warm FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent to 22°C.\nMix DNA and FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. For this protocol, we mixed 150 ng total plasmid with 0.45 μL FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent in 10 μL Opti-MEM™ for each well. [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1]\nIncubate the mixture for 10–15 min at 22°C.\nAdd mixture into each well and mix by pipetting.\nReturn cells to incubators for 24–48 h. Post-transfection media is supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, and 1% L-glutamine. The cells should be approximately 85% confluent post-transfection.\nNote: Each step can be optimized with the instructions[href=https://www.promega.com/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/101/fugene-hd-transfection-reagent-protocol/] from the FuGENE® HD transfection protocol. Although we have only used FuGENE® HD for our SunRISER-labeling experiments, we expect other transfection reagents and techniques (such as electroporation) will lead to equivalent results.\nImaging of SunRISER-labeled mRNAs\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step allows imaging of SunRISER-labeled mRNAs for up to 24 h. For time-lapse live cell imaging we used a DeltaVision Elite microscope (GE Healthcare) equipped with a 60× NA1.42 oil-immersion objective, sCMOS camera, solid-state illumination module, and an environmental controlled chamber (37°C, 5% CO2). A minimum of 60× magnification is required to resolve single mRNA puncta as diffraction-limited objects (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], see also (Guo and Lee, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1908-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. SunRISER-labeled mRNAs appear as diffraction-limited spots\n(A) Image of theoretical point spread functions (PSFs) for diffraction limited signals. The simulated image was generated as described previously (see (Kowalczyk et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])).",
    "(B and C) Representative maximum intensity projections of HeLa cells transfected with SunRISER SRv.1-2P and detection plasmid CFP-24×PP7 (top images). Bottom images represent detail of fluorescence images as indicated, with blue circles representing spots detected by dNEMO analysis. In good labeling conditions, (B) mRNA molecules labeled with SunRISER appear as diffraction-limited spots comparable to those generated in the simulated image. In poor labeling (C) fluorescent structures are larger than diffraction-limited objects and do not represent single mRNA molecules. Large objects also show evidence of oversegmentation where a single fluorescent structure is detected as multiple spots. Scale bars: 10 μm.\nNote: We expect any epifluorescence microscope equipped with an environment control chamber can be used for imaging SunRISER-labeled mRNAs. Other more advanced microscopes (e.g., confocal, light sheet, and many others) are likely to produce SunRISER images with even greater signal-to-background. We have successfully imaged SunRISER in 24-hour experiments and expect that longer duration experiments may also be possible.\nBefore beginning, replace complete growth medium with FluoroBrite medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, and 1% L-glutamine).\nNote: FluoroBrite or any phenol-red free cell culture medium is recommended to increase the signal-to-background of fluorescence images.\nPlace the imaging plate in the microscope incubation chamber to allow the whole system to equilibrate for at least 30 min before the experiment starts.\nSet up appropriate imaging conditions for live cell imaging. For 24-h imaging, we select FITC as Ex and Em filters and set the exposure time to 0.005 s and ND filter to 10%. Images were taken as Z-stacks with 1 μm slices spacing and total thickness 5 μm every 10 min for 24 h. Data acquisition was performed in 1024 × 1024-pixel format.",
    "Note: Multi-channel imaging using spectrally compatible filter sets can be used to select for successfully transfected cells based on expression of mCherry or CFP if these are the GOIs expressed from the detection plasmid.\nNote: For a typical widefield microscope equipped with a NA1.4 60× oil objective, 0.3 μm z-spacing will be approximately the ideal Nyquist sampling, where each diffraction-limited object will appear in at least two to three consecutive z-slices. Although the z-spacings between 0.5 and 1 μm will not oversample as effectively as Nyquist conditions, it allows coverage over wider axial range with fewer exposures at each time point. In our experience these settings lead to quantitatively similar results for mRNA numbers, while reducing the effects of photobleaching and phototoxicity in long-term experiments. For particular applications, ideal combinations of z-spacing and z-slice numbers can be chosen to favor oversampling for increased spatial resolution in the z-axis, or increased depth, or reduced molecular and cellular strain as appropriate to the usage case. Experiments demonstrating resistance to photobleaching with these settings can be found in (Guo and Lee, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nSelect cells expressing SunRISER-labeled mRNA as diffraction-limited spots and mark the region of interest for live-cell imaging experiments.\nNote: Imaging conditions are considerably variable between different microscope setups. SunRISER-labeled mRNAs appear as diffraction-limited spots (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B), and the raw pixel intensity range for the spots detected under the imaging conditions described in this protocol have an average intensity of 673 +/- 189 units from a 16-bit sCMOS detector when pixel values are examined in image analysis software like ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). For cells expressing lower scFv-GFP abundance, mRNA spots can be difficult to distinguish with a poor signal-to-background ratio and can suffer from rapid photobleaching if the excitation illumination is too intense. [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2]",
    "Critical: Transient transfection can lead to subpopulations of cells with GFP expression that is significantly higher than average. We typically avoid imaging and analysis of cells expressing too much GFP that show very bright background fluorescent intensity, and cells with spots that are larger than the diffraction limit Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3]\nWhen possible, use Ultimate Focus or a related auto-focusing mechanism to prevent the loss of the imaging planes during long-term imaging experiments. [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 4]\nBegin time-lapse imaging experiment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1908-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Quantification of SunRISER-labeled mRNAs in time-lapse live-cell images with dNEMO\n(A) Maximum intensity projection of HeLa cells transfected with SunRISER SRv.1-2P and detection plasmid CFP-24×PP7. Cells were imaged every 10 min for 24 h. Scale bar: 10 μm.\n(B) SunRISER-labeled mRNAs detected by dNEMO (blue or orange circles) and associated with cells segmented using Cellpose.\n(C) Time-courses for the number of mRNA molecules identified within the 2 cells shown in (A).\n(D) Example results file generated by dNEMO and output to excel. Features are collected for every spot, and spots within each single cell are separated by tabs.\nNote: The resulting movie file can be opened with ImageJ and quantified with dNEMO as described below. The included file ‘SunRISER_SAMPLE_MOV.tif’ (https://doi.org/10.17632/8j4x6dj2f7.1; see also, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) is representative of a typical imaging experiment result using HeLa cells transfected with stock 24×PP7 and SRv.1-2P plasmids as described here.\nImage analysis with dNEMO and Cellpose\nTiming: ∼20 min (for sample SunRISER movie with 145 time points each with 4 z-slices)",
    "Note: The timing for this step can increase depending on the number of timepoints in a given time-lapse series, the number of cells in the given image, and the hardware running both dNEMO and Cellpose. The reported time is given for the sample SunRISER image provided alongside the software on a 2015 MacBook Pro laptop (16 GB RAM, 2.5 GHz processor).\nThis section describes the semi-automated image analysis which identifies individual mRNA transcripts, extracts the fluorescence intensity from each transcript, and assigns mRNAs to individual cells to create single-molecule single-cell datasets over time-lapse images (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We use the spot detection and quantification tool dNEMO (detecting-NEMO) which is optimized for rapid and accurate detection of punctate structures (spots) in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images. While dNEMO contains dedicated tools for the manual segmentation of individual cells, the most recent version of the software interfaces with Cellpose (Stringer et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), a generalist algorithm for automated cell and nucleus segmentation. Cellpose automatically segments multiple cells in each input image and typically performs better when cells are sub-confluent. With Hela cells, we typically have less than 5 cells per 60× image with a 1024 × 1024 sCMOS detector. Individual cells are reconstituted as single-cell trajectories when input into dNEMO. In this protocol, the combination of dNEMO and Cellpose is used for automated spot detection, cell segmentation, and cell tracking. Sample images acquired using SunRISER and the corresponding results files from both dNEMO and Cellpose are provided with this protocol (https://doi.org/10.17632/8j4x6dj2f7.1). Also included for users is an additional sample image of cells labeled with smFISH probes and corresponding dNEMO/Cellpose results files.",
    "Note: There are standalone executables of the dNEMO software available with this protocol (https://doi.org/10.17632/8j4x6dj2f7.1) which do not require MATLAB to be installed. Use of Cellpose and dNEMO outside of the standalone executables requires installation of Python 3, MATLAB, and the OME bioformats package. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the dNEMO documentation on Database: https://github.com/recleelab[href=https://github.com/recleelab], https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6841307.\nOptional: If Cellpose is not installed, dNEMO implements a manual cell segmentation tool which can be used to segment cells within the dNEMO interface.\nOpen the time-lapse image in dNEMO.\nTo open the standalone dNEMO executable, navigate to the dNEMO application within the executable folder and double-click the application icon.\nAlternatives: If using the MATLAB script package, type the following into MATLAB’s command window:\n>addpath(fullfile(cd, dNEMO_MATLAB_scripts))\n>RUN_ME\nWith the interface open, navigate to File > Load Images. Select the image to be analyzed in the subsequent file selection pop-up window. The image ‘SunRISER_SAMPLE_MOV.tif’ is provided with the software for this protocol (https://doi.org/10.17632/8j4x6dj2f7.1) and can be opened and analyzed using the settings and steps described here. This image (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) is also depicted in subsequent figures as an example for detection of SunRISER-labeled mRNAs within the dNEMO interface.\nNote: Image formats supported by BioFormats (Linkert et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) can be opened by dNEMO. Upper limit on image size may vary with available system memory.\nRun spot detection on the currently displayed image.\nSelect ‘Test Detect (Full)’ in the upper right ‘Spot Filter’ panel. This will run the spot detection algorithm over the currently displayed image (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nConfirm visually that all spots are being detected by toggling the ‘Display All Signals in Current Frame’ toggle in the ‘Display’ panel.",
    "Adjust the value in the ‘Wavelet Threshold’ box (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and click ‘Test Detect (Full)’ (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), both in the ‘Spot Filter’ panel, to re-run spot detection with an updated threshold value. The higher this value is, the fewer objects will be considered above the watershed threshold and thus detected. For images shown detecting SunRISER-labeled mRNAs in this protocol, the ‘Wavelet Threshold’ value was set to 2.25.\nCritical: Properly detecting spots in an image requires examining the detected spots and adjusting the parameters as needed. Two additional parameters for spot detection that affect the generation of the wavelet map and cross-referencing the resulting wavelet maps of a 3D image stack can be found in Settings > Signal Parameters (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The ‘Frame Limit’ parameter indicates the number of consecutive slices in a 3D stack a spot must be detected in to be considered valid. In order to detect spots which only appear in one slice, for example, this value would need to be set to 1. The ‘Wavelet Level’ parameter dictates the level of the wavelet transform to use when generating the wavelet map to detect spots. The higher this value is, the larger the objects detected will be in the resulting wavelet map. In detecting the SunRISER-labeled mRNAs for this protocol, the ‘Wavelet Level’ was set to 2 and the ‘Frame Limit’ was set to 1. All other settings were kept at the default values. For complete details on the implementation of the wavelet transform and watershed segmentation operations in dNEMO, see (Kowalczyk et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 5]",
    "Once satisfied that the spots are being accurately detected, run spot detection with the current detection parameters over all images in the time-series by clicking ‘Create Keyframe’ in the upper right ‘Spot Filter’ panel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The Keyframes box (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) will update with information for detected spots and the associated parameters.\nRun Cellpose to segment single cells over the time-lapse image sequence.\nInitiate Cellpose from dNEMO by navigating to Cell Masks > Run Cellpose (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). This will startup Cellpose and run on the movie currently loaded into dNEMO. [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 6]\nUpon completion, dNEMO will display a prompt for confirming the imported mask. Click ‘Ok’ to confirm the mask import.\nNote: Cellpose does not provide any tracking of the segmented cells. Cells are tracked over time using several parameters found in dNEMO by navigating to Cell Masks > Adjust Import Settings. For more information on how these parameters function see documentation of dNEMO at Database: https://github.com/recleelab[href=https://github.com/recleelab], https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6841307.",
    "Alternatives: If Cellpose is not installed on your system, manual segmentation is an option implemented in dNEMO. Similarly, cell masks generated in other applications can be imported using the ‘Cell Masks’ dropdown menu provided the masks are in a compatible matrix format (TIFF or excel/csv spreadsheet). Manual segmentation uses a process called keyframing where user-defined cell boundaries are propagated across frames of a time-lapse image. Briefly, the ‘Add Cell’ button of the ‘Cells’ panel will create an interactive polygon drawing tool over the current image (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Clicking on the image will begin the manual segmentation process and completing the polygon will create a new cell. The polygon for each cell can be left alone or modified as needed to create subsequent keyframes to refine changes to cell morphology or position at later time points. See (Kowalczyk et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) for full description of keyframing for cell segmentation and additional spot detection parameters.\nCells can be adjusted using both the ‘Cells’ and ‘Keyframes’ panels in dNEMO.\nThe slider along the bottom of the image can be used to navigate through the frames of a time-lapse image.\nSelect a cell using the ‘Cell Selection’ dropdown menu in the ‘Cells’ panel or clicking on a cell in the ‘Keyframes’ panel (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nSegmentations can be adjusted for the current frame by clicking the ‘Modify Cell’ button in the ‘Cells’ panel.\nMultiple operations to adjust segmentations over time and deleting a cell can be accessed by right-clicking on a cell in the ‘Keyframes’ panel and selecting an option from the pop-up menu (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). In conjunction these can be used to modify segmentations or delete inaccurate segmentations. For complete details on dNEMO’s keyframing functions, see (Kowalczyk et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) and Database: https://github.com/recleelab[href=https://github.com/recleelab], https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6841307. [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 7]",
    "Further curate data using keyframing tools and manual exclusion tools.\nSpots can be curated in an automated fashion by assigning keyframes for detected spots’ physical features. For example, using the histogram display axis in the ‘Spot Filter’, detected transcripts can be limited to those which have maximum intensities greater than or equal to 0.0075 by selecting ‘Max’ from the dropdown menu below the axis and typing 0.0075 into the ‘Min’ value to the right of the axis (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nClick ‘Create Keyframe’ in the spot filter panel to create a new keyframe for this feature.\nNote: This creates a parameter for the upper and lower bounds of fluorescence intensity for spots deemed as acceptable. These bounds are propagated over the entire movie and can be adjusted by creating additional keyframes at different time-points. The bounds can also be deleted by selecting and right-clicking a given parameter in the ‘Manual Curation’ section of the ‘Keyframes’ panel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nDetected spots which are determined erroneous (e.g., lysosomal accumulation of fluorescent molecules) or oversegmented (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) can be curated manually using the manual removal tool. [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 8]\nNavigate to the ‘Manual Removal’ panel and click ‘Remove Signals’ (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nA crosshair will replace the mouse pointer icon when hovering over the main image axis in dNEMO. Clicking on detected spots in the image will remove them. Clicking on them again will undo the removal. Clicking and dragging the cursor will create a box allowing removal of numerous detected spots.\nClick ‘Update Removal Keyframe’ to save the manual exclusions performed.\nClick ‘Stop Removing Signals’ in the Manual Removal Panel to terminate the manual exclusion process.\nSave data collected in dNEMO to mat-file and excel spreadsheet.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1908-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
