    "All research using the transgenic fluorescent zebrafish Tg (fli:EGFP) strain, which has enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled vasculature20, including housing and experiments, was carried out according to the international guidelines and was approved by the local Institutional Committee for Animal Welfare (Dier Ethische Commissie (DEC) of the Leiden University Medical Center.\nNOTE: As summarized in Figure 1, the protocol is roughly broken down into four steps: embryo collection (Figure 1A), microinjection (Figure 1B), screening (Figure 1C), and analysis (Figure 1D).\n1. Prepare the Injection Needles\nPrepare injection needles with borosilicate glass microcapillaries. Put a microcapillary into a micropipette puller device with the following settings: air pressure, 500; heat, 650; pull, 100; velocity, 200; time, 40. Keep the injection needles in a needle holder plate until they are used for injection.\n2. Prepare the Fluorescent, Genetically Labeled Breast Cancer Cells for Injection\nCulture human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells at 37 °C in DMEM-high glucose medium containing L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (pen-strep).\nCulture the breast epithelial cell lines, MCF10A (M1) and MCF10A-Ras (M2), at 37 °C in DMEM/F12 media containing L-glutamine with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 10 mg/mL insulin, 100 ng/mL cholera enterotoxin, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, and 1:100 pen-strep.\nProduce mCherry lentivirus by co-transfecting PLV-mCherry, pCMV-VSVG21, pMDLg-RRE (gag/pol)22, and pRSV-REV22 plasmid into HEK293T cells. Harvest cell supernatants 48 h after transfection and store at -80 °C.\nInfect MDA-MB-231, M1, and M2 cells at 30% confluence for 24 h with lentiviral supernatants diluted 1:1 with normal culture medium in the presence of 5 ng/mL polybrene.\nSelect single-cell clones by diluting cells in a 96-well plate, which allows the outgrowth of isolated cell clones, until obtaining the stable mCherry-expressing cell lines.",
    "Culture one T75 flask of cells for injection. Harvest the cells at 80% confluence with a 0.5% trypsin-EDTA treatment. Wash the cells with 1x PBS 2-3 times.\nRe-suspend the cells in about 200 µL of PBS. Store at them 4 °C for less than 5 h before injection.\n3. Prepare Zebrafish Embryos for Injection\nSet up zebrafish breeding pairs and collect embryos, as shown in a previous JoVE article by Rosen et al.23.\nSelect the embryos that are at 0-4 hpf by removing the unfertilized and abnormal embryos. Keep the embryos in a Petri dish full of egg water (60 µg/mL sea salts; ~60 embryos/dish) and incubate at 28 °C.\nDechorionate the embryos with fine tweezers at 48 hpf.\nAnesthetize the embryos by transferring them to 40 µg/mL tricaine (3-aminobenzoic acid) containing egg water approximately 2 min prior to injection, but no longer than 2 h prior to injection.\n\tNOTE: Tricaine stock solution (4 mg/mL, 100x) is prepared as 400 mg of tricaine powder in 97.9 mL of double-distilled water and 2.1 mL of 1 M Tris-base (pH 9), with the pH adjusted to 7.4. Store in the -20 °C freezer.\n4. Inject Human Breast Cancer Cells into the Perivitelline Space\nLoad 15 µL of the cell suspension into an injection needle. Mount the needle onto the micromanipulator and break off the needle tip with fine tweezers to obtain a tip opening diameter of 5-10 µm.\nUse a pneumatic picopump and a manipulator to perform the microinjection. Adjust the picopump to inject 400 cells each time. Prior to injection, count the cell numbers manually by injecting the cells on the top of a Petri dish containing 1% agarose.\nLine up anesthetized embryos (2-3 days post fertilization (dpf)) on a flat, 1% agarose injecting plate, around 10 embryos each time.",
    "Orient the injection plate by hand during the injections to place the embryos in the preferred position for inserting the needle (i.e., diagonally).\nPoint the needle tip at the injection site and gently insert the needle tip into the perivitelline space between the yolk sac and the periderm of the zebrafish embryo (Figure 2A).\nInject approximately 400 mCherry-labeled tumor cells. Make sure that the yolk sac is not ruptured to avoid implantation into the yolk sac.\n5. Inject Human Breast Cancer Cells into the Doc\nPrepare the injection needle and zebrafish embryos as described in protocol steps 1, 2, and 3.\nUse a 45° needle angle so that the Doc can be approached from the dorsal side of the embryo.\nInsert the needle into the starting point of the Doc (Figure 3A), just dorsal to where the duct starts broadening over the yolk sac, and inject approximately 400 cells; the injection is correct if the volume within the duct expands directly after the pulse and the yolk sac.\n\tNOTE: Several consecutive injections can be performed without extracting the needle.\nTransfer the injected zebrafish embryos to egg water.\n\t​NOTE: As considerable variation exists among individual zebrafish embryos, and as the death of embryos after injection can occur, a relatively large number of zebrafish embryos (around 100) should be injected with cancer cells.\nMaintain the zebrafish embryos at 33 °C to accommodate the optimal temperature requirements for fish and mammalian cells.\n6. Screen the Injected Embryos",
    "Screen each fish under a fluorescence stereomicroscope at 2 h post-injection (hpi) for the perivitelline space injection (Figure 2) or at 2-24 hpi for the Doc injection (Figure 2) to ensure that all of the embryos are injected with a similar number of tumor cells. Remove the embryos with injection errors, such as ruptures (Figure 2B) or injections (Figure 3B) of the yolk sac, and pick out embryos with injected cells below (Figures 2C and 3B) or above (Figures 2D and 3B) threshold. Keep only the embryos with approximately 400 cells in culture.\nRule out the possibility that the cells are introduced directly into circulation during the injection process by removing the embryos with cells already in circulation. Also, remove any embryo with a cell mass close to the Doc (Figure 2D).\n7. Image and Analyze the Metastatic Process\nCollect several anesthetized embryos with a wide-tip Pasteur pipette and transfer them to the glass bottom of a polystyrene dish.\nRemove excess water and keep a limited amount of egg water. Manipulate the embryo into position with a hair loop tool and place a cover on top of the glass.\nUse an inverted confocal microscope in combination with water-immersion or long-distance dry objectives. Position the embryo such that the region of interest is as close to the objective as possible.\nPerform imaging immediately after anesthesia to reduce the risk of death due to liquid evaporation.\n\t\nCapture signals from EGFP-labeled vasculature and mCherry-labeled tumor cells at the same position on the embryos to co-register injected cells with blood vessels by merging the two imaging channels.\nFor each zebrafish embryo, collect two different sets of images from the head region and tail region.\nQuantify the number of disseminated cells.",
    "For perivitelline space injections, count the number of cells in each fish that have disseminated from the cell mass towards the embryonic fish body within the head and tail regions4,15; the regions are beyond the boundaries of the heart cavity frontally, on top of the swim bladder dorsally, and beyond the urogenital opening caudally.\nFor the Doc injection, count the number of individual cells that have invaded the collagen fibers of the tailfin from circulation (MDA-MB-231) or the number of clusters formed by cells collectively (M2) in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of each zebrafish19.\nStudy invasion and metastasis in more detail by using confocal microscopy (highly recommended).\n\t\nUse low magnification (4X objective) to image the whole body and to obtain an overview of the tumor cell dissemination pattern.\n\t\t​NOTE: Higher magnification (20X and 40X objectives) is suitable for studying intra- and peri-tumoral angiogenesis and the precise localization of disseminated cells in the embryo body.\nUse a 488 nm laser to scan the zebrafish embryo vasculature and a 543 nm laser to scan implanted tumor cells labeled with red fluorescence. Obtain a high-quality image by scanning each embryo in eight to ten steps. Scan and average each step six times.\nCarefully place the embryo back into the egg water if it is required for further experiments.\n8.
