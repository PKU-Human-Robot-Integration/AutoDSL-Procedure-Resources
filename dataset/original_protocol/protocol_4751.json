    "Mice are euthanized by cervical dislocation under deep CO2 (100%) anesthesia (Figure 1A-B).Obtain the tongue from animals and place in Tyrode’s buffer.Pin tongue on a Sylgard dish so that vallate papillae are easily accessible (Figure 1C).Inject ~0.3 ml of enzyme mixture in the regions near the vallate papillae (on each side) subepithelially. The needle should be visibly beneath the epithelium. Note: Delivering enzyme mixture by inserting the needle too deep will result in the digestion of the muscle tissue. If the location of needle is too shallow, the epithelium will be pierced, the enzyme mixture may leak through the holes on the lingual epithelium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602183249_4814.jpgFigure 1. Euthanization of mice, and excision of tongues. The photograph shows (A) the animal, C57BL/6J mouse, (B) the apparatus for euthanizing animals, (C) the tongue pinned on a Sylgard dish under the stereo dissecting microscope, and (D) the suction apparatus for collecting taste buds.Incubate the tongue in 5~10 ml of Tyrode’s buffer with aeration for 30 min.Re-pin the tongue so that vallate papillae are readily accessible (Figure 1C).Cut the epithelium surrounding vallate papillae with microsurgical scissors.Peel the epithelium away from the tongue using a sharp set of tweezers.Pin the pieces of epithelium, serous side up, onto a Sylgard dish. Stretch the epithelium so that each papilla is exposed and easily accessible (Figure 2A). Exchange the solution for Ca2+/Mg2+-free Tyrode’s buffer. Incubate the epithelium in the buffer for 20 min for collecting individual taste buds or 30 min for single taste cells.Replace Ca2+/Mg2+-free Tyrode’s buffer in the Sylgard dish with regular Tyrode’s buffer.Using a fire-polished glass micropipette (60~80 μm) (Figure 1D), sweep each papilla several times while applying suction. Periodically stop and discharge the solution onto a Cell-TAK treated coverslip.Critical: There are, typically, sufficient number of taste buds on the vallate papillae to make 2~4 coverslips.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602183312_7255.",
    "jpgFigure 2. Suction apparatus setup to collect taste buds from mouse vallate papillae. A. The photo shows the peeled lingual epithelium, serous side up, pinned on a Sylgard dish. B. Isolation of taste buds is performed in the Sylgard dish, and then taste buds are delivered via a glass micropipette to a recording chamber assembled on the platform. C. A Nomarski optics micrographic image of isolated taste buds in a living preparation when viewed under the Olympus IX73 microscope.For collecting single cells, gentle trituration (suck Tyrode’s containing taste buds into the glass pipette and discharge it immediately for repeating 5-6 times) is required via 20~30 μm fire-polished glass pipettes.Note: Validating the intact membranes can be a criterion for healthy-looking taste buds/cells. Taste cells may be not healthy if the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is over 200 nM at their resting stage (Critical!).Allow 20 min for taste buds and/or taste cells to settle, and to attach to the bottom of the chamber, which is made by glass coverslips (Figure 2B-C)."
