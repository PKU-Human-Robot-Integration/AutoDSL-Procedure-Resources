    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nThis section lists the major steps and provides step-by-step details and timing for each major step. Please use continuous number for this section.\nYour Major Step One\nTiming: [s, min, h, days, or weeks]\n[Include a brief description about what this major step accomplishes; this will help other researchers repeat and troubleshoot the protocol.]\n[First step of major step one. Use numbers to order steps.]\n[Sub-steps under first step. Use letters for ordering of sub-steps. Align the sub-steps slightly to the right to be better differentiated from steps.]\n[Sub-step two, as needed.]\n[Third-level sub-steps under second-level sub-steps. Use Roman numerals for ordering. Align the third-level sub-steps slightly to the right to be better differentiated from second-level sub-steps.]\n[Third-level sub-step two, where needed.]\n[Second step of major step one]\nCritical: [Particularly important instructions or factors should be called out in this format. Please provide figures or videos for guiding critical steps.
