    "Mouse Anesthesia Protocol Obtain Institute approval before working with mice.Use a reliable gas scavenging system to collect, remove, and dispose of waste anesthetic gases (fume hood, vacuum waste gas line, etc.) for the researcher's safety.Place mouse into an inhalation chamber. Introduce 5% isoflurane in 1.0 L/min oxygen into the chamber, and observe the animal until it has lost its righting reflex.Remove the mouse from the inhalation chamber, and attach a nose cone to continue to provide 5% isoflurane in 1.0 L/min oxygen. Place mouse on top of insulating material, such as a layer of paper towels, so that the mouse does not lose body heat as quickly, which happens faster if the work surface is made of metal.Apply a corneal lubricant on a q-tip to the mouse’s eyes, to protect them.Once the breathing rate of the mouse is less than 60 breaths per minute, check for a toe pinch response. When there is no response, carry out the waxing procedure.When finished waxing, remove the nose cone. Place the mouse into a prepared recovery cage. This is a clean cage lined with a clean absorbable substrate (e.g., paper towel). The recovery cage should be placed on the heat pad set to low.Note: Rodents who are recovering from anesthesia should not be placed directly onto normal cage bedding material. Placing unconscious mice onto bedding poses several risks, including asphyxiation due to inhalation of bedding pieces, and damage to the corneas until the return of the blink response. Monitor the mouse as it recovers from anesthesia, in a quiet area. Once it is fully recovered, the mouse can be returned to its home cage.Waxing one day before cell collection Turn the heatpad on at the lowest setting to warm up.",
    "Cut four small rectangular pieces of Nair® wax strips (40 mm × 5 mm), leaving a wax-free border on one narrow end of each strip, in order to hold on to the strip without touching the wax.Place mice under anesthesia for tail hair removal. We use a nose cone isoflurane inhalant system. For reference, our protocol for recovery anesthesia is included above. However, the exact method of anesthesia is not likely to affect the success of the experiment, and the procedure should be carried out according to the Animal Care Ethics board regulations that govern the institute where the research is being conducted.Warm two wax strips slightly by placing the strips on the heat pad for 20 s. This should warm the strips to body temperature (37°C).Gently remove clear plastic from the strips and place one strip on the top of the tail and one on the underside of the tail. The wax free area of the strip should be oriented so that it is placed towards the tip of the tail.Smooth each strip gently downwards with your ﬁngers to make sure that it is properly adhered.Wait 20–25 s and then remove the wax strips with a quick gesture, in the direction that is towards the head of the mouse.Repeat steps A4–A7, but this time place the remaining two wax strips on the lateral sides of the tail.Note: The skin should be light pink, clean and without any injury. If some traces of wax remain on the skin, mouse self-grooming will remove it overnight. Cell collection procedure Sterilize forceps before use.Make the dispase solution following the instructions located in the Recipes section.Euthanize the mouse according to the Animal Care ethics regulations that govern the institute where the research is being conducted.",
    "At the University of BC, this is isoflurane anesthesia, followed by CO2, then cervical dislocation. Using an alternative method of euthanasia is not likely to affect the success of the experiment. Process the skin as soon as possible after euthanasia.Place the mouse on its back and, holding the tail base with forceps, use a scalpel to cut along the ventral midline from the tail base to the tail tip (Figure 2A) (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Tail skin incision technique.  This video was made at the University of British Columbia, according to guidelines from the University of British Columbia on Animal Care, and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia, under protocol #A19-0148.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220414/20220414175749_1762.jpgFigure 2. Isolating mouse tail skin from bone. (A) Forceps and a scalpel are used to cut the mouse tail skin along the ventral midline. (B–C) A razor blade is used to remove the tail and cut it into smaller segments about 0.5 cm in length. Ruler shown in mm. (D) Tail skin is peeled off of the bone and briefly set on glove, to reduce curling.Cut tail off and divide it into four segments (about 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm each) with a razor blade (Figure 2B–C). Discard the tip of the tail, where it becomes narrow.Using the skin incision made in step B3, peel the skin from the tail bones.After being removed from the bone, tail skin tends to roll in on itself. In order to flatten it, it is recommended that the skin be placed flat for about 30 s (e.g., on the back of a gloved hand) (Figure 2D).Place flattened tail skins in the \"dispase\" Petri dish. Ensure the epidermis side of the skin is facing up, and the skin is floating and not submerged (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220414/20220414175037_6609.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Tail skin floating in dispase solution. (A) Birds eye and (B) horizontal view of tail skin floating in dispase solution.Incubate the Petri dish with the tail skins in the dispase solution in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C (5% CO2) for 35 min.Meanwhile:Remove Fixable Viability Dye from -80°C and thaw it on ice.Add 2 mL of MEM to a Petri dish and label it “for trypsin”.Make the trypsin solution using the instructions located in the Recipes section.Make the MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution using the instructions located in the Recipes section, and keep on ice until use.Transfer 2 mL of the MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution to a 50-mL Falcon tube labeled “cells 1”, and place the tube on ice.Chill an empty 15-mL conical tube labeled \"cells 3\" on ice.Remove the Petri dish with skin pieces in dispase solution from the incubator.Using a 5-mL serological pipette, remove the dispase solution and discard.Add, and then remove, 1 mL of MEM twice, to wash the skin pieces. They will float.Add 1 mL of MEM to the dish.Using a pair of fine forceps, split the epidermis from the dermis (Figure 4) as follows:Remove one piece of skin and place it in a new empty Petri dish. Use one pair of forceps to clamp onto the epidermis while the other forceps peels the white dermis layer away. Starting in a corner works best for peeling the entire segment in one motion.A stereomicroscope will aid in discerning epidermis from dermis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220414/20220414175251_7568.jpgFigure 4. Splitting dermis from epidermis. (A) A pair of fine forceps is used to split the dermis from epidermis starting in one corner and (B) following through in a single motion. (C) The end result, with dermis in the left Petri dish and epidermis on the right.",
    "Immediately after the dermis has been removed, transfer the epidermal layer to the Petri dish labelled “for trypsin,” currently holding 2 mL of MEM. The epidermis should be floating, with the underside of the epidermis in contact with the solution. Discard the dermis.Repeat steps B14 and B15, until the dermis from all skin pieces has been removed and the epidermis placed in the \"for trypsin\" dish.Using two 5-mL serological pipettes, remove the MEM from the Petri dish holding the epidermis and replace it with 3 mL of the trypsin solution, making sure the pieces of epidermis are still floating.Incubate the Petri dish with the pieces of epidermis in the trypsin solution in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C (5% CO2) for 5 min.Remove the Petri dish containing the epidermal pieces in trypsin solution from the incubator.Inhibit trypsin activity by adding 3 mL of cold MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution to the dish, with a 5-mL serological pipette. Swirl to mix.Then, use the same serological pipette to collect 4 mL of the solution from the dish and add it to the chilled conical tube labeled “cells 1” from step B9.Use the following steps to release and collect cells from the epidermis:Pick up one piece of epidermis using a fine forceps #55 and scratch the underside of the scales once or twice using a pair of curved forceps #7. This will release some cells into the 2 mL of solution in the Petri dish. Epidermal cells at this stage appear white. Use a stereomicroscope to better visualize the process (Video 2, before & after epidermal scratching).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Scale scratching techniqueUse the 1,000 μL micropipette to transfer 1 mL of the solution in the Petri dish, including the released cells, to the Falcon tube labeled “cells 1”.",
    "Immediately add 1 mL of fresh, cold MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution to the Petri dish.Repeat this process: Scratch and transfer cells from each piece of epidermis three times. The final volume transferred into \"cells 1\" will be 14 mL (which will be added to the 4 mL already in the tube). If less volume is used, cell viability will suffer.Using a 10-mL syringe and a 16 G needle, pipette the \"cells 1\" solution up and down 10 times, slowly, to limit the formation of air bubbles in the syringe. This process disrupts the cell clumps and separates the cells.Pass the cell solution through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new 50-mL Falcon tube labeled \"cells 2\", to remove any clumps of cells that did not dissociate in step B23.Using a 10-mL serological pipette, rinse the cell strainer mesh with 6 mL of cold MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution into the \"cells 2\" tube.Centrifuge the \"cells 2\" tube at 300 rcf (× g) and 18°C for 3 min. A pellet should form.Lower the temperature of the centrifuge to 4°C.Gently remove as much supernatant as possible from \"cells 2\" without disturbing the pellet, using a 25-mL serological pipette. Discard the supernatant.Add 1 mL of fresh cold MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution, and gently resuspend the cells.Transfer cells to the pre-chilled 15-mL conical tube labeled \"cells 3\" from step B9.Add 1 µL of Fixable Viability Dye to \"cells 3\" and gently mix.Incubate \"cells 3\" on ice for 15 min.Use a 10-mL serological pipette to add 7 mL of fresh, cold MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS to \"cells 3\".Centrifuge \"cells 3\" at 300 rcf (× g) and 4°C for 3 min.Using a 10-mL serological pipette, remove supernatant from \"cells 3,\" leaving about 0.",
    "2 mL of liquid above the pellet.Gently resuspend the pellet in the remaining 0.2 mL of liquid, and then transfer cells to an Eppendorf tube. Keep the Eppendorf tube with cells on ice until FACS sorting, which should be done as soon as possible.Add 20 µL of fresh, cold MEM + EDTA + 10% FBS solution to a 15-mL round bottom polystyrene test tube, which will be used to collect the tdTomato-positive cells during FACS.If RNA sequencing is the final goal, also add 1 µL of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor.FACS sort for tdTomato positive cells at 581 nm, while excluding Fixable Viability Dye (pacific blue) positive dead cells, which are fluorescent at 405 nm."
