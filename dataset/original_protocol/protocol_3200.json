After confirming contaminant-free growth of the desired\n      microbe, a second overnight culture is performed in liquid rich medium\n      culture by removing a single colony and dispersing it into a 5 mL volume\n      of the rich growth medium.\n    \n        Create an agar plate with single isolates of\n        Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4796 on a sterile MRS agar plate.\n        \n            Remove a frozen L. acidophilus glycerol stock from the −80°C\n            freezer and transfer the vial on dry ice to a sterile biosafety\n            cabinet or lab bench with a Bunsen burner.\n          \n            Keep the stock on dry ice throughout the inoculation. Do not allow\n            the stock to thaw.\n          \n            Using the pointed end of a sterile loop, collect a small amount of\n            bacteria (around the size of a sunflower seed) from the frozen stock\n            and streak bacteria on the MRS agar plate using a four-quadrant\n            method.\n          \nIncubate the plate at 37°C aerobically.\n        Create an agar plate with single isolates of\n        Lactococcus lactis CB and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212\n        on a sterile BHI agar plate.\n        \n            Remove frozen L. lactis and E. faecalis glycerol stock\n            from the −80°C freezer and transfer the vial on ice to a sterile\n            biosafety cabinet or lab bench with a Bunsen burner.\n          \nKeep the stock on ice throughout the inoculation.\n            Using the pointed end of a sterile loop, collect a small amount of\n            bacteria (around the size of a sunflower seed) from the frozen stock\n            and streak bacteria on the BHI agar plate using a four-quadrant\n            method.",
    "Incubate the plate at 37°C aerobically.\n        The next morning, inspect the MRS and BHI agar plates to confirm growth,\n        and assess the culture for the existence of microbial contaminants.\n      \n        Grow an overnight culture of bacteria in rich medium.\n        \n            Using a sterile loop, select a single L. acidophilus colony\n            from the MRS agar plate and add the loop to 5 mL volume of MRS\n            growth medium in a 14 mL culture tube.\n          \n            Using a sterile loop, select a single L. lactis or\n            E. faecalis colony from the BHI agar plates and add the loop\n            to 5 mL volume of BHI growth medium in individual 14 mL culture\n            tubes.\n          \n            Loosely cap the inoculated medium culture and incubate aerobically\n            overnight at 37°C.\n          \n            The next morning, examine the culture under a light microscope at\n            40× to ensure there are no contaminants.\n          \n            Measure the growth of the bacteria by examining the optical density\n            as follows:\n            \n                Vortex-mix the culture vigorously to ensure a homogenous\n                microbial suspension.\n              \n                Transfer a 100 μL volume of the bacterial culture into an\n                optical cuvette that contains a 900 μL volume of\n                phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to create a 1:10 dilution.\n              \n                Add 100 μL volume of uninoculated MRS medium or BHI medium into\n                an optical cuvette that contains a 900 μL volume of\n                phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to serve as a blank for the\n                spectrophotometer.\n              \n                The microbial density is determined by measuring the optical\n                density at 600 nm (OD600nm) against a blank\n                consisting of a 100 μL volume of MRS with a 900 μL volume of PBS\n                using a SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer, or equivalent\n                instrument.\n              \nCritical: Bacterial medium selection\n      depends on the microbe used in the analysis. As an example, we have\n      selected L. acidophilus, L. lactis, and E. faecalis because\n      these are all lactic acid bacteria that can significantly lower the pH of",
    "a solution. However, other bacteria and their agar and preferred rich\n      medium can be used. If strict anaerobic organisms are selected, an\n      anaerobic workstation is required for cultivating those microbes.\n      Facultative anaerobes and strict aerobes can be grown in traditional\n      incubators. The examples used in this protocol are facultative anaerobes\n      and can be grown aerobically.\n    \n      Grow bacteria in a chemically defined bacterial medium ZMB1\n    \nTiming: 1 day\n      The chemically defined bacterial growth medium ZMB1 is used for this work\n      because this growth medium can be used to grow multiple organisms (i.e.,\n      Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacteria,\n        Escherichia, Klebsiella, Blautia,\n      etc) and is amiable to downstream analysis such as liquid\n      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based bioanalysis and\n      pH assessment.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\n        Sub-culture bacteria from the rich culture into the chemically defined\n        growth medium ZMB1 and aliquot the solution into a 96-well DeepWell\n        polypropylene microplate.\n        \n            Using the OD600nm measurement as a reference, inoculate\n            an appropriate volume the cultures into the appropriate volume of\n            ZMB1 to final create a solution with an OD600nm = 0.1.\n          \n            Vortex mix vigorously the inoculated ZMB1 medium to ensure a\n            homogenous microbial suspension.\n          \n            Aliquot 2 mL volume of the inoculated ZMB1 medium into individual\n            wells in a 96-well DeepWell polypropylene microplate. Chemicals or\n            nutrient sources can be added to this solution for testing.\n          \n            Cover the 96-well DeepWell polypropylene microplate with a silicon\n            mat, and culture the bacteria aerobically with rotational mixing for\n            20 h at 37°C.\n          \nCritical: The ZMB1 medium can be made\n      with or without glucose. If you want to compare bacterial growth on\n      different substrates (like galactose, mannose, arabinose, fructose, etc),\n      do not add glucose to the ZMB1 stock solution. We recommend adding 100 mM\n      of carbohydrate to test different nutrient sources. If growing anaerobic\n      bacteria, DeepWell microplate plate can be grown anaerobically for 20 h at\n      37°C.",
    "Assess bacterial growth by measuring optical density on a plate reader\n    \nTiming: 10 min\n      The Optical Density at 600 nm (OD600nm) is obtained to\n      determine the degree of bacterial growth during the overnight culture.\n    \n        After the incubation is complete, examine the bacterial growth by\n        measuring the optical density:\n        \n            Using a multi-channel pipette, mix the wells of the DeepWell\n            polypropylene microplate containing\n            L. acidophilus, L. lactis and E. faecalis cultures and\n            transfer a 100 μL volume from each into a 96-well flat bottom\n            polystyrene (PS) microplate\n          \n            Measure the OD600nm using a Synergy H1 plate reader\n            employing path correction, or an equivalent instrument\n          \nCritical: If no bacterial growth is\n      observed, there may be components missing from the ZMB1 that are required\n      for the growth of the selected organism. These components can be added to\n      the ZMB1 for optimal growth.\n    \nGenerate a calibration curve\nTiming: 10 min\n      A 12-point calibration curve can be prepared for day-to-day UV-Vis\n      spectrophotometer calibrations for routine microbiology work. The 31-point\n      calibration curve described below was prepared specifically to determine\n      the quality of the sigmoidal fitting algorithm, and to assess the accuracy\n      of pH measurements across the entire dynamic range of litmus dye. Further,\n      we used this experimental accuracy data to define a dynamic pH range limit\n      (pH range of 4.4–8.8) for Litmus dye that is accurate and useful for\n      microbiological applications.\n    \n        To create a ZMB1 solution at a basic pH, add 10 M NaOH stepwise to a\n        40 mL volume of uninoculated ZMB1 medium until the pH is ∼10. This\n        solution is the basic ZMB1 media stock solution for bulk Calibration\n        Standard preparations.\n      \n        To create a ZMB1 solution at an acidic pH, add 10 M HCl stepwise to a\n        40 mL volume of uninoculated ZMB1 medium until the pH is ∼2.

    "dilutions in triplicate to confirm the accuracy of the method and ensure\n      the fit of the curve (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). For daily\n      experiments, we recommend a 12-point curve in duplicate to ensure an\n      optimal calibration curve. Alternatively, individuals can simply use the\n      31-point calibration curve available online (Lukmen-lab/pHSigma: Fitting UV-VIS pH indicator litmus absorbance\n        spectrum ratio calibration | Zenodo[href=https://zenodo.org/record/8206410]) to back-calculate the pH of their bacterial cultures (See\n      Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). To identify the isosbestic point and λmax\n      for litmus, we examined the UV-Vis absorption spectra over an optical\n      wavelength range of 350–750 nm (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). This\n      method identified that the isosbestic point occurred at 520 nm and λmax\n      occurred at 590 nm. For individuals using this protocol, it is not\n      necessary to examine a range of spectra; measuring 520 nm and 590 nm is\n      sufficient to calculate pH.\n    \n      Assess pH from cell-free supernatant using the low-volume format using\n      96-well plates\n    \nTiming: 30 min\n      The low-volume format is amiable for use in 96-well plate formats that can\n      be used in high-throughput microbiology applications that use micro-scale\n      organism cultures.\n    \n        To calculate the pH, transfer 200 μL volume from each DeepWell\n        polypropylene microplate well into a 96-well round bottom polystyrene\n        (PS) microplate.\n      \n        Centrifuge the plate at 2,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the\n        bacteria.\n      \n        Without disrupting the pellet, transfer a 120 μL volume to a Corning 96\n        well filter plate containing a 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)\n        filter.\n      \n        Place a new 96-well flat bottom PS microplate to the bottom of a vacuum\n        apparatus and place the 96-well filter plate containing the cell-free\n        supernatant on the top.\n      \n        Use the vacuum to sterile filter the media into the new 96-well plate.\n      \n        Transfer a 90 μL volume of the sterile cell-free supernatant to another\n        96-well plate using a multiple-channel pipette.",
