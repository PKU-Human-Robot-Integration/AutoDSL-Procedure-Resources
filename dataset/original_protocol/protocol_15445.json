    "1.    Animal Injections\nPrior to intravenous tail vein injection, the tail skin should be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol scrubs for sterilization purposes. Mice should  then be injected with 0.2 mL/20 g of a 20-mg iodine/mL iodinated bloodpool contrast agent (eXIA 160XL; Binito Biomedical, Inc. Ottawa, ON, Canada) via the distal tail vein using low dead space ½ CC U-100 28G½ Insulin Syringes (Product #329461, Becton Dickinson and company, NJ, USA).\n2.    Animal Preparation \nAfter 10 minutes of injection, the animals should be prepared for microCT imaging. First, the animal should be anesthetized in a box using 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at rate of  2.5 liters per minute. An ocular lubricating ointment should be applied to prevent desiccation of the corneas during anesthesia. Body temperature should be maintained at 37°C by a heat pads.\n3.    MicroCT Imaging\nMice then should be scanned on a microCT unit capable to perform live animal scans. To minimize movement artifacts and stability, mice can be placed in a commercially available multi-modality chamber (Numira Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT) with provision for air and exhaust. To avoid a hypothermic episode on the animal during microCT scans, Gel Pads (Hot Cold Therapy Brace, CVS Pharmacy Woonsocket, RI), Toe Warmer (Heat Factory, Vista, CA) or Thermipaq Clay Pads (Thermionics, Springfield, IL) can be used. Place these heating pads under the foam bed to maintain the mouse at 37°C while avoiding direct contact with the animal. Vital signs of animal such as body temperature, respiration and heart rate should be monitored using the Small Animal Monitoring and Gating Systems such as SA Instruments (Stony Brook, NY).",
    "The following imaging protocol can be used as a guideline to help determine the appropriate scan parameters for any microCT units. The animals used in this experiment were scanned at 93 μm resolution on a volumetric CT scanner GE eXplore Locus (GE Healthcare, London, Ontario). This volumetric scanner uses a 3500 x 1750 CCD detector for Feldkamp cone-beam reconstruction. The platform independent parameters of current, voltage and exposure time were kept constant at 450 μA, 80 kVP and 100 ms, respectively. The standard parameters of exposure time, frames per view and number of views can be varied and could be 100 ms, 5-8, and 360-720, respectively with total scan time of approximately 20 minutes. Images were reconstructed with the manufacturer's proprietary EVSBeam software.\n4.    Image Rendering\nThe reconstructed microCT data can be used for advanced isosurface, one-dimensional, or two-dimensional transfer function rendering Images using Seg3D image processing software (Seg3D, http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc/software[href=http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc/software]).\n5.
