    "Embryo brain dissectionBreed female and male mice in a 2:1 or 1:1 ratio.Check females for the presence of a vaginal plug every day within the first hour of the light cycle.Separate females with a plug to avoid re-plugging and register that morning as embryonic day (E) 0.5.On day E15.5, euthanize females following institutional guidelines. We use a combination of CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. See Note 1.Remove the uteri, place them in PBS 1×, and separate each implantation site. Care should be taken to maintain the yolk sac intact to minimize tissue damage.Under a dissection microscope, dissect the embryo free of extraembryonic tissues. If genotyping is required, cut the tip of the tail or a paw and place it in a tube. See Note 2.Cut the embryo head and peel the skin and meningeal membranes covering the brain using Dumont #5 fine forceps. See Note 3 and Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4058/bioprotoc-11-12-4058-g001.jpgFigure 1. Dissection of a mouse embryo brain. The head skin is peeled away along the dotted line using Dumont #5 forceps (Left). The meningeal layers covering the brain are removed carefully to expose the brain (Center, dotted line). Pushing the brain gently from the side releases the whole organ from the head (Right).Remove the brain from the head by cutting the rhombencephalon at the base of the skull and gently pushing the forebrain from the side.Place the brain in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS in a 1.5 ml polypropylene tube.Vascular fragment isolation (all steps should be performed on ice)Disrupt brains with five strokes using a sterile 1.5 ml tube pestle.Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 4°C.During centrifugation, prepare enough 18% dextran solution in PBS to individually process each of the brains collected.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 μl of 18% dextran. See Note 4.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 4°C.Transfer the supernatant to another tube. See Note 5.Resuspend the pellet in 500 μl of 18% dextran.Centrifuge both fractions at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Pellets are the vascular fragments.Transfer the supernatant to a different tube and add 1 ml of PBS.Centrifuge the diluted supernatants at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant. The pellets are the parenchymal fractions.Store vascular and parenchymal fractions at < -70°C until use.Western blotting for the evaluation of enrichment of fractionsAdd 100 μl of lysis buffer directly to the pellet on ice. Care should be taken to maintain the pellet frozen until the lysis buffer is added by keeping the tubes on dry ice or liquid nitrogen.Lyse the sample by pipetting up and down until the lysate looks homogeneous. See Note 6.Pool pellets corresponding to the same fractions of the same sample by transferring all the lysate from the first tube to the second. Lyse the second pellet by pipetting. See Note 7.Transfer 10 μl of lysate to a different 1.5 ml tube for protein quantification. Keep at < -70°C.Repeat Steps C1-C4 for each sample to be analyzed in parallel. Always process controls alongside experimental samples.Add 2-mercaptoethanol to loading buffer to a concentration of 5%.Mix an aliquot of 15 μg of protein with 1/3 volume of loading buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and heat at 98°C for 5 min.Load into a 10% polyacrylamide gel and run for the appropriate time to resolve proteins in the range of 30 kDa and 150 kDa in Running buffer.Incubate a PVDF membrane in methanol for 5 min for activation.Transfer proteins into the activated PVDF membrane at 300 mA for 1 h in Transfer buffer.",
    "Block the membrane by incubating 2 h in 5% skim milk, 0.01% Tween 20 in TBS 1×.Incubate the membrane with the primary antibody diluted 1:2,000 in blocking buffer.Wash the membrane three times for 10 min in 0.01% Tween 20 in TBS 1×.Incubate with the secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer.Wash the membrane three times for 10 min in 0.01% Tween 20 in TBS 1×.Mix the solutions from the chemiluminescence kit and cover the membrane for 1 min.Blot excess solution and image in a gel documentation system.A representative blot demonstrating the enrichment of endothelial markers in the vascular fraction and of a neuronal progenitor marker in the parenchymal fraction is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4058/bioprotoc-11-12-4058-g002.jpgFigure 2. Enrichment of vascular and parenchymal fractions. Western blot analysis of endothelial (PECAM1, ERG) and neuronal progenitor (PAX6, TBR1) markers in the vascular (V) and parenchymal (P) fractions. Note that the PAX6 signal is detected in vascular fragments, representing PAX6 expression in brain endothelial cells (Vasudevan et al., 2008) and/or vascular adherent neuro/glial progenitors (Tan et al., 2016).Lipid extractionAdd 100 μl of lysis buffer directly to the pellet on ice. Care should be taken to maintain the pellet frozen until lysis buffer is added by keeping the tubes on dry ice or liquid nitrogen.Lyse the sample by pipetting up and down until the lysate looks homogeneous. See Note 6.Pool pellets corresponding to the same fractions of the same sample by transferring all the lysate from the first tube to the second. Lyse the second pellet by pipetting. See Note 7.Transfer 10 μl of lysate to a different 1.5 ml tube for protein quantification. Keep at < -70°C.Repeat Steps D1-D4 for each sample to be analyzed in parallel. Always process controls alongside experimental samples.",
    "In a fume hood, add 400 μl of methanol to the 90 μl of lysate, followed by 800 μl of chloroform. See Note 8.Seal tubes with DuraSeal laboratory film. See Note 9.Vortex each tube for 1 min to mix both phases well.Heat at 60°C for 30 min using a heating block or bath.Vortex for 1 min.Incubate overnight at 4°C to allow phases to separate.Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 4°C.Transfer 400 μl of the hydrophobic (lower) phase into a new tube. To avoid contaminating the organic phase with the aqueous one, push some air into the pipette tip before introducing it into the solution, and release it in the upper part of the lower phase.Transfer 50 μl of organic phase into a new tube and evaporate under an inert atmosphere. After evaporation, no crystallization should be visible. Two tubes should be prepared in this manner for each sample to measure cholesterol in duplicate.Cholesterol measurementPrepare all reagents in the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.Add 50 μl of Reaction buffer 1× to the tubes containing the evaporated organic phase.Vortex for 1 min. See Note 10.Transfer to a black 96-well plate.Construct a cholesterol standard curve following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer 50 μl to the black 96-well plate.Set up the reaction mixture as described by the manufacturer and add 50 μl to each well containing the samples and the curve.Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.Measure the fluorescence with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm.Protein measurementThaw sample aliquots on ice and prepare 100 μl of a 10-fold dilution by adding 90 μl of MilliQ water to each tube.Construct a BSA curve by diluting the BSA standard as instructed by the manufacturer.Transfer 25 μl of each sample and curve point to a clear 96-well plate.",
    "Prepare enough reaction mixture for all samples and the curve by mixing Buffer A and Buffer B in a 50:1 ratio.Add 200 μl of reaction mixture to each well.Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.Measure the absorbance at 562 nm."
