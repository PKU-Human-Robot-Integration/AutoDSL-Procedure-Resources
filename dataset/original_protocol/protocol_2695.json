The muscle tissue has been minced using sterile surgical scissors\nCritical: It is important remove all visible connective tissue and fat by using sterile forceps and scissors to be able to mince the tissue well. This leaves a greater surface area for the enzymes to digest. Although the gentleMACS also mince the tissue, the initial manual mincing increases the effectiveness of the digestion and ultimately the cell yield. Optimal enzymatic digestion is of key importance for great yield of cells.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Please see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for example of minced muscle tissue with all connective tissue removed.\nWeigh the muscle tissue if evaluation of cells/mg of tissue is of relevance.\nTransfer the minced muscle tissue to the C-tube(s). One C-tube holds up to 1 g of muscle tissue with the present set-up.\nPlace the C-tube(s) on the gentleMACS dissociator.\nAdd heaters.\nChoose a muscle digestion program.",
    "Note: We use the program 37_mr_SMDK1 (1 h 1 min), which provides sufficient time for effective dissociation.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPause Point: 61 min.\nMake sure to check on the gentleMACS dissociator every 15 min to ensure no clogging of the rotating blades has occurred (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2350-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Digested human skeletal muscle\nThe muscle tissue has been digested on the GentleMacs dissociator and 8 mL of HAMS F10+ wash media has been added. The digested muscle tissue is now a liquid substance ready to filter.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlease see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem one below on actions to perform if clogging occurs.\nAdd 8 mL of 4°C HAMS F10+ wash media to each C-tube to stop the enzymatic digestion by dilution.\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 mL falcon tube.\nWash the filter using 2 mL of HAMS F10+ wash media to remove the surface tension.\nAspirate the digested muscle suspension in and out of a 20 mL syringe using a 18 G needle.\nMake sure to eject to the wall of the tube to be gentle on the cells and avoid foaming.\nRepeat five times to ensure single cell suspension.\nCritical: in order to obtain single cell suspension, it is important to aspirate all of the muscle suspension five times.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlease see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem two below on actions to perform if clogging of the needle occurs.\nAspirate the entire suspension into the syringe and remove the needle.\nEject the suspension onto the 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 mL falcon tube to remove debris by gravity.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlease see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem three below on actions to perform if clogging of the filter occurs.",
    "Note: If the muscle biopsy is large and divided into several C-tubes the same syringe and falcon tube can be used for those C-tubes. Remember to change the needle and the cell strainer as these may clog. One 50 mL falcon tube holds ∼2 C-tubes.\nWash the empty C-tube(s) twice using 5–10 mL of HAMS F10+ wash media.\nTransfer the wash media to the 70 μm cell strainer(s) to ensure that all cells are collected from the C-tube(s) and the cell strainer(s).\nMake sure to collect any remaining liquid hanging underneath the cell strainer by using a pipette in order to maximize cell yield.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nNote: Be careful not to disturb the pellet as this will loosen. The pellet loosens with time and thus it is important to do the aspiration immediately after centrifugation.\nIf Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) is performed immediately, move to step 21 from here. If the cells need to be stored before FACS continue with step 18.\nAdd 1 mL of StemMACS cryopreservation buffer (or similar freezing buffer) to the pellet(s).\nResuspend the cells by gently pipetting up and down 2–4 times.\nNote: We recommend resuspending the pellet(s) by using a 1,000 μL pipette or larger.\nTransfer the solution to cryotube(s) using a pipette.\nPlace the cryotube(s) in a freezing container and store at −80°C until further use.",
    "Note: Once freezing has occurred (∼ 12–24 h) the cells can be moved from the freezing container to storage in freezing boxes made of e.g., cardboard or plastic. However, we recommend moving the cells to a −150°C freezer after 24 h for preservation of cells. The cells can be stored at −80°C if -150 freezer is not available. If the cells are to be used for cell culture we have experienced the highest viability and best overall cell performance if the cells are sorted within 2–4 weeks after freezing.\nPreparation of the sample(s) for sorting and samples to set up the sorter\nThis section includes:\nAntibody incubation of the sample(s) to be sorted using FACS (steps 21–52).\nFluorescence minus one (FMO) controls (steps 52–60).\nCompensation samples – propidium iodide compensation sample (steps 61–64).\nCompensation samples – single-colored beads for FACS (steps 65–73).\nAn unstained control sample (step 32).\nThe section of antibody incubation of the sample(s) to be sorted using FACS[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] is for preparation of the sample(s) to be sorted. The sections of FMO controls, compensation samples and the unstained control are for preparation of samples to be used for setting up the sorter.",
    "Note: Antibody incubation can be performed on freshly digested single cell solutions or on single cell solutions, which has previously been digested and stored at −80°C or −150°C. As antibody incubation of the sample(s) to be sorted is the most time-consuming step, we recommend starting with this preparation, which is why we describe these preparation steps first. We recommend that the FMO controls (steps 52–60) are prepared alongside the sample(s) to be sorted using FACS, alternatively at the pause point in this section (step 41). Compensation samples (step 65-73) can be prepared at the pause point of the antibody incubation of the sample(s) to be sorted using FACS (step 41). When moving to the sorter, the FMO controls, the compensation samples and the unstained control sample must be analyzed on the cell sorter before running the full samples to be sorted using FACS, as described under the section: Setting up the cell sorter and sorting of samples (steps 74–89).\nNote: In this protocol we have not included the utilization of isotype controls. This decision is based on 1) that this protocol is only intended to sort positive from negative (bimodal) cell populations; 2) that we have not included sorting of cells expressing Fc-reptors (e.g., myeloid cells) and; 3) the difficulty in obtaining isotype controls for all antibodies fulfilling the criteria needed to serve as a usefull control.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] To confirm specificity of the sorted cells, we highly recommend to perform control stainings of freshly sorted cells to confirm uniform expression of specific cell markers (e.g. Pax7 for MuSCs and PDGFRα for FAPs).\nAntibody incubation of the sample(s) to be sorted using FACS\nTiming: 1 h 30 min (for step 21)",
    "These steps allows for antibodies to react with cell surface proteins for the FACS to distinguish and sort the cells. This is to be performed on single cell solutions from digested muscle tissue.\nAdd 10 mL of HAMS F10+ wash media (stored at 4°C) to a 15 mL falcon tube. Prepare one 15 mL falcon tube per sample being sorted.\nNote: If antibody incubation is performed on single cell solutions from freshly digested muscle tissue which has not been frozen, move directly to step 28.\nThaw the digested muscle sample(s) quickly in 37°C water bath until only a small amount of ice is left in the tube.\nWipe down the tube(s) using 70% ethanol and place it at the sterile tissue culture hood.\nTransfer the thawed or fresh sample(s) to the 15 mL falcon tube(s) containing 10 mL of HAMS F10+ wash media.\nWash the tube(s) which contained the cells using 1 mL of HAMS F10+ wash media from the 15 mL falcon tube(s) to collect all the cells.\nTransfer the wash media to the 15 mL falcon tube(s).\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant to remove the StemMACS cryopreservation buffer (or chosen alternative freezing buffer).\nNote: Be careful not to disturb the pellet as this will loosen. The pellet loosens with time and thus it is important to do the aspiration immediately after centrifugation. While it is important to remove the HAMS F10+ containing the cryopreservation buffer the dilution with HAMS F10+ will also ensure this.\nAdd 200–400 μL of HAMS F10+ wash media to the 15 mL falcon tube(s) to reach a final volume of approximately 500 μL.\nResuspend the pellet(s) by gently pipetting up and down 2–4 times.",
    "Note: The steps below (steps 30–38) are for saving small samples from the sample in the 15 mL falcon tube(s) before the antibodies are added (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). These are to be used later for making FMO controls, compensation sample-propidium iodide compensation sample and unstained control (point 52–73).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2350-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: MuSC and FAP engage in the cell cycle within 24–48 h and 48–72 h following sorting, respectively. This will lead to exponential growth in cell numbers within 5–10 days. If the cells grow slowly FGF 1:5000 can be added to the growth media. As the FGF-growth media should not be older than one week we recommend making small stocks e.g., by adding 2 μL FGF to 10 mL growth media. Always warm the media or PBS in 37°C water bath before adding it to the cell culture. When changing media make sure to eject to the wall of the well to avoid disturbing the interception of the cells. Store the media at 4°C for up one month when it is not being used.\nPlating cells for detection of cell proliferation using EdU\nTiming: 24–48 h for MuSCs, 48–72 h for FAPs\nFor experiments of cell proliferation, we recommend using the Click-iTTM EdU cell proliferation kit for imaging (Thermo Fischer Scientific). For full protocol please see link[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp10338.pdf].\nPlate the cells at density of approximately 1 × 104/cm2.\nAdd HAMS F10+ wash media at an appropriate amount for the well size choosen.\nAdd EdU from the Click-iTTM EdU cell proliferation kit in HAMS F10+ wash media at concentration of 10 μM upon plating of the cells. Store the media at 4°C for up one month when it is not being used.\nPause point: 24–48 h for MuSCs, 48–72 h for FAPs.\nIn our hands it is not necessary to refresh the EdU medium unless cells are grown for longer time periods. However, for prolonged experiments, fresh EdU can be added.\nAspirate the media.\nFix the cells using 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min.",

If the fixed cells are stored for multiple weeks remember to add PBS to the cells regularly as this will evaporate over time. We have experienced successful staining on fixed cells after one year of storage. However we have not tested the durability of the fixed cells.\nDifferentiation of MuSCs\nTiming: 5–8 days (for step 103)\nThese steps allows the cells to differentiate to form myotubes.\nAllow the cells to grow to approximately 95% confluence.\nWash the cells once using warm sterile 1×PBS.\nAdd myogenic differentiation media. Add media in a volume appropriate for the well size chosen.\nReplace the media with fresh media every 2 days. Store the media at 4°C for up one month when it is not being used.\nObserve the differentiation of the cells on a regular basis using a light microscope.\nNote: Time for full differentiation is expected to be 5–8 days. Upon differentiation the MuSCs will elongate and fuse into multinucleated myotubes.\nFix the cells using 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min once the cells are fully differentiated.\nCritical: HAZARD SYMBOL!
