When all the required wells have been transfected, gently rock the plate to evenly distribute the liposome complexes.\nMorning of the following day: remove medium and add 750 μL fresh MDM medium (DMEM0xx + 10% (v/v) human serum + 15 ng/ mL M-CSF) (this step is roughly done at 14 h post siRNA transfection)\nEarly morning of three days post transfection, remove medium from cultured macrophages and add 500 μL fresh DMEMxxx\nRepeat point 2.\nIncubate cells for 1 week at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nCritical: always consider doing siRNA transfection in technical duplicates. siRNA master mixes have to be prepared under the flow hood. Disinfect the working area with 70% isopropanol and inactivate any residual nucleases with RNase away.\nValidation of knockdown efficiency\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step illustrates processing of cells for western blot analysis\nAt 1 week post transfection, harvest and lyse cells for western blot\nRemove supernatants.\nAdd 500 μL PBS.",

    "Prepare 12 well plate with 1.5 mL of RPMI 20% (v/v) FCS, IL-2 (10 ng/mL) and L-glutamine (2 mM) without antibiotics (RPMIxx)/well. Place it into the cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nPre-warm Human T cell nucleofector solution with added supplement (delivered together with the kit).\nPrepare cuvettes.\nTake 6 million CD4+ T lymphocytes per sample.\nCentrifuge cells at 393 rcf for 3 min at 22°C–23°C and remove the supernatant as much as possible.\nAdd 100 μL of T cell nucleofector solution, add 1.5 μg of IFI16 shRNA, gently mix, and transfer into the cuvette.\nPlace the cuvette into the Amaxa device and pulse the sample with U15 program.\nImmediately transfer the sample into the medium in the 12 well plate (one sample/well).\nCritical: For primary CD4+ T lymphocytes transfection, it is important to use high purity DNA.\nValidation of knockdown efficiency\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes how to determine the knockdown efficiency via western blot analysis.\nHarvest and lyse cells\n72 h after transfection, harvest one million cells and centrifuge them at 393 rcf for 5 min at 22°C–23°C.\nRemove the medium and add 500 μL of PBS.\nCentrifuge at 393 rcf for 5 min at 22°C–23°C.\nRemove the supernatant and add 100 μL of western blot lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) NP40, 500 μM Na3VO4, 500 μM NaF, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitor.\nVortex and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge for 20 min at 20,817 rcf at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant in a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nMeasure protein concentration using the Nanodrop. Normalize protein concentration for each donor with CoIP lysis buffer.",
    "Transfer 30 μL of supernatants in a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and add 10 μL of loading dye (90% (v/v) 4× loading dye + 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol).\nHeat at 95°C for 10 min.\nFreeze at −20°C.\nPerform western blot analysis as described in the siRNA section (points 8 and 9).\ngRNA/Cas9 nucleofection of CD4+ T lymphocytes\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step accomplishes the gRNA/Cas9 nucleofection\nMix 80 pmol Cas9 and 240 pmol sgRNA in a final volume of 5 μL.\nIncubate the complex for 20 min at 22°C–23°C.\nPrior to nucleofection, prepare the nucleofector master mix.\nFor the mix use 82% (v/v) of the Lonza P3 Primary Cell Solution and 18% (v/v) of the supplement 1 for a total volume of 20 μL for one nucleofection.\nIn the meantime, remove the anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads from the CD4+ T lymphocyte culture and transfer 1 million cells in a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (use one tube per reaction).\nSpin down the cells and carefully remove the medium.\nAdd 20 μL of nucleofector master mix and straight afterward the gRNA/Cas9 complex to the cells, mix gently, and transfer it in the nucleofection strip. Avoid making the bubbles.\nInsert the strip in the 4D Nucleofector Core Unit and chose the pulse code EO115.\nAdd 80 μL warm RPMIxx supplemented with 20% (v/v) FCS and IL-2 (10 ng/mL) to the strip and incubate in cell culture incubator for 10 min.\nAdd 200 μL warm RPMIxx with 20% (v/v) FCS and IL-2 (10 ng/mL) in a 48 well plate, transfer the electroporated cells in the plate and culture for 14 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nOn the following day, add 300 μL of warm RPMIxx with 20% (v/v) FCS and IL-2 (10 ng/mL).
