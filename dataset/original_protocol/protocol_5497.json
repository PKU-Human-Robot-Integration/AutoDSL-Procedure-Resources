    "Immunogold labeling of microtubules and microtubule organizing center proteins (Vaughn and Bowling, 2008; Vaughn, 2013) Note: For each solution change described below, completely saturate samples by adding solution until it covers over the material in the vial/tube.    Fix small pieces of several antheridia or whole gametophyte plants (if small, like those of ferns) in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M Sorenson’s phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at room temperature. Scintillation vials with aluminum-covered caps are ideal for this process (alternatively, you can also use 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes). If parts of plants are used, do all cutting of samples in a drop of the glutaraldehyde solution.    Wash in the same 0.05 M Sorenson’s buffer, 2-3 exchanges, 15 min each at 4 °C. To facilitate exchanging solutions without losing the small samples, the tip of the Pasteur pipette is heated over a Bunsen burner so that the tip aperture is down to about 1/3 of its original size. In this way, clean exchanges may be made so that the tiny samples are not sucked up into the pipette and lost during the exchanges.   Post-fix tissue for 10 min in 2% (v/v) osmium.   Serial dehydration: Remove the PIPES buffer and add 25% ethanol (in 0.05 M PIPES buffer) to the vial, increasing the percentage of ethanol by 25% increments until 75% ethanol is reached.   Exchange the solution with 100% ethanol several times. These steps should be at 4 °C, and the vials transferred to a -20 °C freezer after the second 100% ethanol transfer.   Add LR White resin (London Resin Company) to reach 25% plastic (in ethanol). Shake vial to mix plastic into the solvent and maintain at -20 °C for one day. Repeat this procedure by adding plastic to 50% for one day and then add plastic to 75% for another day.",
    "Exchange the solutions, putting 100% resin in the vial. Shake the vial and make sure the samples have sunk in the resin. Allow them to spend 24 h in 100% resin.   Allow the vials to warm to room temperature and shake on a rocking platform for 24 h. This will allow for infiltration of the resin throughout the sample.   Transfer the samples to gelatin capsules and fill the capsule with 100% resin forming a meniscus. Rotate the cap as it is inserted to create an oxygen-excluding shield. Place in a 50 °C oven and remove in ~2 d.   Trim the samples and cut 100 nm sections (pale gold reflectance colors) with a diamond knife and fume the sections with ethylene dichloride to stretch the sections. Pick up the sections by touching the dull side of 300 mesh gold grids or 200 mesh nickel grids.   Place mounted grids in a closed CLEAN Petri dish and dry for 1-2 h at room temperature or place the Petri dish on a slide warmer (45-50 °C) for 30 min.   Float the grids, section-side down on 10 µl drops of the following solutions (all of which are filtered through 250 nm filters) and times:    2% BSA in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (PBS/BSA; pH 7.2), 30 min (BLOCKING).   On drops of primary antibodies or monoclonal antibodies diluted from 1:20 in 2% PBS/BSA for 3-4 h at room temperature.     Rinse grids by placing them on drops of 2% BSA/PBS 4 x 3 min.   Place grids on 5-15 µl drops of secondary gold-labeled antibody or Protein A/gold diluted 1/20-in 2% BSA/PBS in ‘humid chamber’ 1-3 h.   Move grids to 5-10 µl drops of 0.02 M PBS for rinsing 4 x 3-5 min (FILTER and CENTRIFUGE).",
    "Rinse each grid with a jet of double distilled autoclaved water that has been filtered (0.2 µm) and let it dry.   Post-stain the grids for 2 min in 2% uranyl acetate, wash in double distilled autoclaved water and post-stain in Reynold’s lead citrate. Wash in double distilled autoclaved water, dry and examine under transmission electron microscope.      Immunogold labeling of spermatozoid matrix and cell wall constituents (Lopez and Renzaglia, 2014)   Fix small pieces of antheridial tissue or whole gametophyte plants (if small, like those of ferns) in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M Sorenson’s phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at room temperature.

In this way, clean exchanges may be made so that the tiny samples are not sucked up into the pipette during the exchanges.   Post-fix tissue for 10 min in 1% (v/v) osmium tetroxide (OsO4).   Rinse tissue 3 x in distilled water (10 min each).   Serial dehydration: Remove the water and add 25% ethanol (in water) to the vial, increasing the percentage of ethanol by 25% increments until 75% ethanol is reached.

Trim the samples and cut 90-100 nm sections (pale gold reflectance colors) with a diamond knife and fume the sections with ethylene dichloride to stretch the sections. Pick up the sections by touching the dull side of 300 mesh gold grids or 200 mesh nickel grids.   Place mounted grids on a clean piece of filter paper in a closed CLEAN Petri dish and dry for 1-2 h at room temperature or place the Petri dish on a slide warmer (45-50 °C) for 30 min.   Using a humid chamber (see Note 2) place a piece of dental wax on completely wet filter paper, float the grids, section-side down on 10 µl drops in the following solutions (all of which are centrifuged and filtered through 250 nm filters) and times:   2% BSA in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (BSA/PBS; pH 7.2), overnight (BLOCKING).
