    "Hysterectomy specimens used in this manuscript were collected in concordance with a University IRB-approved ethics protocol numbered IRB-HSR #14424.\n1. Sample Acquisition from Clinical Source\nObtain government and institution-based ethical guidelines and approval documentation before beginning.\nConduct all steps in sterile conditions.\nPreserve patient-derived tissue in media (RPMI or DMEM/High Glucose) in a 50 ml tube at 4 °C if the sample cannot be processed in culture immediately. Samples can be stored in this state for a maximum of 24 hr.\nWash tissue sample three times with 1X sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and discard the solution between washes.\n2. Preparation of Primary Cell Lines using the Scraping Method\nAdd 4-10 ml of growth media (RPMI or DMEM/High Glucose supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin) to tissue and add Fungizone (0.25 µg/ml final concentration) for 30 min.\nDiscard the growth media.\nWash tissue twice with 1X PBS.\nPlace the tissue on a 6 cm cell culture plate to distinguish between myometrium and endometrium layers (refer to Figures 2A-2C for further description). Separate the endometrium.\nUsing a scalpel or razor blade, transect the tissue into small pieces while scratching onto the 6 cm cell culture dish. These scratches facilitate the attachment of the emerging primary endometrial cells. Compared to the trypsin method, more tissue is needed (see Figure 2D for an approximation).\nGently, add 2 ml of growth media to scratched dish (tissue fragments will be visible and ideally immobilized from the scratching motion).\nTransfer the plate(s) to a designated cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2). Designate a place for primary cell lines, away from other cell culture dishes. Primary cultures are more sensitive to infection and contamination.",
    "Examine the cells under a light microscope daily. Small populations of cells should emerge by day two or three from around the sliced tissues (see Figure 3B).\nTo maintain cultures, wash gently with 1X PBS and add fresh growth media (2ml) every three days. When proliferation rate increases, additional growth media (3-4 ml) can be added to the 6 cm culture plate(s).\n\tNote: During washing and media changes, pieces of tissue will likely be aspirated. This will not affect growth of adherent cells. Pieces of tissue should be aspirated by the subsequent step (2.10) as new colonies are unlikely to emerge after one week.\nWhen the 6 cm plate is approximately 75 - 80% confluent (see Figure 3B), passage using 0.05% trypsin. Primary cells cannot be passaged indefinitely - freeze down one plate of cells as soon as two or three plates are maintained. If more passages are required, follow an immortalization protocol (reviewed in Ref 3).\n3. Preparation of Primary Cell Lines using the Trypsin Method\nPlace a small piece of endometrial tissue (see Figure 2D for an approximation) in 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin supplemented with Kanamycin (0.03 mg/ml final concentration).\nIncubate tissue at 37 °C on rotating platform for 30 min.\nBriefly vortex the tissue.\nCentrifuge the sample at 200-400 x g for 2 min and discard the supernatant.\nAdd fresh trypsin and Kanamycin.\nIncubate the tissue at 37 °C while rotating for an hr.\nVortex the tissue for 5-10 sec.\nAdd 2ml of growth media (supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin) to deactivate the trypsin.\nCentrifuge cells at 200-400 x g for 2-3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 2 ml of growth media to the pelleted cells.",
    "Plate onto a 6 cm cell culture dish. Scraping the plate as in Step 2.5 of Preparing Primary Cell Lines using the Scraping Method is not necessary, but enhances the attachment and outgrowth of primary cultures.\nMonitor cells under a light microscope daily. Cells are usually visible under a light microscope after 24-48 hr (see Figure 3C).\nTo maintain the cultures, monitor the cells and change media every 2-3 days as in Step 2.9.\nTo passage the cells, use 0.05% or 0.25% Trypsin when cells reach 75-80% confluency (see Figure 3C).\n4. Saving Extra Tissue for Analysis (Snap Freezing and Formalin Fixation)\nWash sample twice with 1X PBS.\nAspirate as much liquid as possible.\nFor Snap Freezing, place endometrial tissue sample in a 1.7 centrifuge tube (see Figures 2F and 2G). Place the 1.7 centrifuge tube in liquid nitrogen for 10 sec or until it can be seen that the tissue has frozen down.\n\tNote: Take care not to directly touch liquid nitrogen when preparing samples. Samples can be stored at -80 °C until further processing or analysis.\nFor formalin fixation, cut a small piece of endometrial tissue (see Figure 2H), and submerge in 10% buffered zinc formalin. After 24 hr, discard formalin and add 70% ethanol to tissue samples until further processing.\n5. Immunofluorescence (IF)\nCell fixation\n\t\nPrepare cells on a culture slide or plate.\nGently, wash cells with 1X PBS.\nAdd pre-chilled (4 °C) Methanol and Acetone (mixed at a 1:1 ratio) for 5 min.\nAir dry the slide before proceeding. Slide can be stored at 4 °C for 1-2 weeks if needed.\nProcessing IF\n\t\nRehydrate cells with 1X PBS for 10 min. For the following Steps 1-6, conduct all washes and incubations on a rotating platform.",
    "Block using 1X PBS supplemented with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 1% species specific serum (source of 2nd antibody) for 30 min at room temperature (RT).\nIncubate in primary antibody (see manufacturers recommendations for antibody dilutions). Refer to Materials for specific antibodies. Dilute the primary antibody in fresh blocking buffer as in Step 5.2.2. This incubation can be conducted for at least 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash 3 times with 1X PBS for 5 min each.\nIncubate in secondary antibody (see manufacturers recommendations for antibody dilutions). Dilute the secondary antibody in fresh blocking buffer as in Step 5.2.2. To prevent photo-bleaching, it is important to conduct this and subsequent steps in the absence of light.\nWash 3 times with 1X PBS for 5 min each.\nThoroughly dry the slides.\nAdd mounting media and DAPI counterstaining solution.\nApply coverslip and seal the edges using sealant(s). Slides can be stored at 4 °C in the dark for up to 2 weeks.\n6. RNA Extraction\nPellet 1 x 107 cells by centrifugation. All materials and reagents in this protocol should be RNAse free.\nLyse cells in 1 ml TRIZOL reagent, and incubate the homogenized samples for 10 min at room temperature to complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes.\nAdd 200 µl of chloroform per 1 ml of TRIZOL. Shake vigorously by hand for 15 sec and incubate for 2-3 min at RT.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed (15,000 x g) for 15 min at 4 °C. Three layers will result.\nTransfer the top aqueous phase into a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 µl glycogen to increase the RNA yield; however, this step is only necessary when a small amount of RNA is anticipated.",
    "Add 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol to the aqueous layer, and invert the samples 3-5 times. Incubate samples at RT for 10 min. To increase yield, samples can be placed in -20 °C or -80 °C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C.\nAt this point, a small pellet of RNA should be visible. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the RNA with 1 ml of 75% ethanol.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Samples can be washed once more to rid inorganic contaminants, but this step is not necessary.\nBriefly, dry the RNA pellet until RNA pellet is dry (usually takes 7-10 min).\n\tNote: One additional step can be used to decrease inorganic matter and decrease drying time. After discarding the supernatant from the ethanol wash, spin samples at maximum speed for an additional minute and aspirate residual liquid. Take care not to aspirate pellet.\nDissolve RNA in RNase-free water, depending on the size of the RNA pellet. Volumes typically range from 10-50 µl.\nIncubate samples at 55 °C for 10 min, and measure the concentration of RNA.\nStore samples at -20 °C until further processing.\n7. Reverse Transcription\nBring the sample RNA (1-3 µg) to a volume of 9 µl with H2O.\nHeat RNA to 70 °C for 10 min.\nTo generate an AMV master mix, combine the following reagents: 5 µl of dNTP (working concentration of 50 µM), 5 µl of N6 DNA oligos (working concentration of 80 µM), 5 µl of 5X AMV buffer, and 1 µl of AMV. This master mix solution is designed per one sample.\nAdd 16 µl of the master mix to the heated RNA. The final reaction volume will be 25 µl reaction.",
    "Use the following PCR conditions for reverse transcription: (Stage 1) 42 °C for 90 min, (Stage 2) 95 °C for 5 min, and (Stage 3) 4 °C until further processing.\n8. Real Time PCR\nConduct PCR reactions using the primers, annealing temperatures, cycle numbers, and reagents found in Table 1.\n\tNote: It is ideal to follow manufacturer instructions when using PCR reagents (refer to company and catalog numbers in Materials).\n9. In vitro Decidualization Protocol (Derived from Ref 4 and 5)\nPlate endometrial cells.\nGrow to a confluency of 75-85%.\nAfter cells become confluent, wash once with 1X PBS.\nQuickly, add hormone-free media (Phenol free RPMI supplemented with 5% charcoal strip FBS and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin).\nAfter 24 hr, add hormone free media supplemented with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) at a final concentration of 1 µM and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM.\nAfter at least 48 hr, stop the reaction and save the plate(s) for further processing.\nSubscription Required.
