    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerform ethical review\nTiming: Development of protocol will likely take 2–4 h. However, review and revision may take 1–6 weeks.\nSubmit the study protocol to the institutional review board (IRB) or ethics panel for comment, revision, and approval prior to starting the study.\nAssess EHR dataset to formulate the research question.\nTiming: Varying amounts of time will be required for reviewing EHR, however, likely 1–2 h will be required.\nFormulate the research question:\nIn multi-disciplinary teams of clinicians (domain experts), data scientists, and biostatisticians, researchers must formulate the research question with an appraisal of the available data and its architecture.\nSelect the method of data entry:\nSelect manual, electronic query or a combination of both. Decide on protocols to ensure the accuracy of data, such random spot checks of data.\nPre-process the clinical dataset:\nEMR data are of varying granularity and frequency and must be inspected and prepared in a pre-processing step before the case report forms can be completed. Pre-processing may require data modifications for missingness and outliers. Data-scientists and clinicians must work together to provide appropriate representation of the data forms.\nPerform an exploratory data analysis to refine the initial research question:\nAssess cohort demographics and the suitability of the dataset for the research question.\nDevelop patient cohorts that discriminate progressive respiratory failure\nTiming: Less than one hour.\nSecure the availability of domain experts to adjudicate clinical questions on study design, patient inclusion and exclusion, and data:\nFor studies of respiratory failure, domain experts include physicians that are board-certified sub-specialists in Pulmonary Medicine, Critical Care Medicine, or Infectious Disease.\nReview potential clinical questions regarding respiratory failure that affect study design and patient inclusion and exclusion criteria:",
    "A key question is whether to identify, segregate, or exclude types of respiratory failure that cause critical respiratory illness but may not reflect ARDS pathophysiology. For example, an infection with SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an exacerbation of underlying asthma or COPD that leads to NIPPV or intubation without severe hypoxemia.\nNote: By the definition of ARDS, respiratory failure primarily driven by heart failure is excluded in studies on ARDS.\nAssess subjects for inclusion and exclusion; confirm each subject’s diagnosis with criteria relevant to the research question:\nFor example, a study of COVID-19 pneumonia should exclude a patient who is hospitalized for appendicitis and only incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR and lacks respiratory symptoms.\nDivide subjects in “mild,” “progressive,” or “severe” respiratory failure to distinguish patients with stable from progressive respiratory failure:\n“Mild”: Patients who initially present to the hospital with non-critical illness and remain non-critical throughout their hospital admission. That is, the patients only require room air, low flow nasal cannula, or face mask (excluding non-rebreathing mask [NRB]) during their hospitalization.\n“Progressive”: These patients have the same initial clinical presentation as the “mild” group—non-critical illness. However, “progressive” patients develop worsening respiratory failure during their hospital course and later require NRB, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).\n“Severe”: These patients arrive at the hospital with critical illness and require NRB, HFNC, NIPPV or IMV within 12 h of presentation to the hospital (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_670_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_670_4.csv",
    "Note: Some studies of inpatient acute respiratory failure divides patients into cohorts of “ICU” or “non-ICU”, “severe or not severe disease” or focus on an association with mortality (Cummings et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Petrilli et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]; Haljasmagi et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). However, this two-cohort model or the binary outcome of mortality may not elucidate the determinants of progressive respiratory failure. Predicting which patients with milder illness will remain stable and which patients will worsen to critical illness is a key clinical need to guide triage, intervention, and clinical studies. The three group model in this proposal is suited to capture the dynamic process of progressive respiratory failure.\nNote: These categories are not to be confused with other classification schemes that use the term “severe,” such as “severe ARDS” (i.e., P/F ratio < 100) or “severe COVID-19 pneumonia” defined in the ACTT clinical trials (Beigel et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nConsider sub-dividing the “progressive” and “severe” groups of subjects by their use of NRB, HFNC, NIPPV or IMV: To capture progression within critical illness, the study can sub-divide the “progressive” and “severe” cohorts further into these patient sub-cohorts, listed in typical order of escalation of intensity of respiratory support:\n“HFNC”: These patients required HFNC but did not require NIPPV or IMV at any point during their hospitalization.\n“NIPPV”: These patients required NIPPV but did not require IMV at any point during their hospitalization. They may have required HFNC.\n“IMV”: These patients required intubation for IMV at any point. They may have required HFNC or NIPPV.",
    "Note: Grouping together patients that utilize any one of NRB, HFNC, NIPPV or IMV under a single definition, as in step 9, is reasonable. Any of these modalities of respiratory support are a clear escalation from milder respiratory failure that only requires nasal cannula or simple face mask. However, patients with ARDS can have progression of their respiratory deterioration within this larger definition of critical respiratory failure. For example, some patients will remain on HFNC, while other patients will worsen and require IMV after HFNC due to worsening hypoxemia or work of breathing. Sub-cohorts within the “progressive” and “severe” categories would capture these clinical changes. Creating sub-divisions within critical illness quickly raises additional questions since patients can move between HFNC, NIPPV and IMV. For example, in a retrospective cohort study, the use of HFNC or NIPPV for a particular patient may be based on clinical characteristics, and the modes themselves may affect outcomes, as in a systematic review of HFNC and NIPPV in preventing IMV (Zhao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Should patients that are initially on HFNC or NIPPV but then intubated be distinguished from patients that go directly to IMV without HFNC or NIPPV? It can be hypothesized for a given study that extended periods of HFNC or NIPPV in a deteriorating patient risks greater patient-induced lung injury compared to earlier initiation of low tidal volume IMV; alternatively, delaying IMV, with its risks of complication such as sedation-induced delirium, could be beneficial. Thus, unless a study is well-powered to accommodate sub-divisions of critical illness, we recommend limiting the cohorts to “mild”, “progressive” and “severe” as described in step 9 as a simpler yet powerful approach to study the determinants of respiratory deterioration.\nDevelop a case report form (CRF)\nTiming: 1–10 h depending on length of CRF and number of variables.",
    "Develop a case report form to ensure standardized data collection across sites and staff:\nAn example of a case report form for a study of respiratory failure is in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/670-Mmc1.pdf].\nNote: In steps 2–5, a multi-disciplinary team should have already considered the quality and availability of data before formulating the research question that drives the design of the CRF.\nPerform a pilot test of the CRF on a subset of patients:\nIf a systematic barrier to completing the data fields in the CRF is found, revise the research question and/or CRF. See section troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for approaches to common issues in data acquisition, such as erroneous or missing clinical data.\nUse physiological measures of respiratory failure\nTiming: Roughly, 5 min per patient.\nCalculate the P/F ratio:\nP/F = PaO2 / FiO2\nCalculate the ROX index for each subject and time point:\nROX index = (SpO2 / FiO2) / Respiratory Rate\nNote: Lower P/F ratio or lower ROX index correlates to worse hypoxemic respiratory failure.\nUse inflammatory biomarker trends to predict respiratory decline\nTiming: 1–4 h.\nPre-specify a statistical analysis of inflammatory and other biomarkers over time, instead of static values at a single time point, and their association to the primary and secondary end points that have clinical and/or pathophysiological significance.\nChallenge any associations with sensitivity analyses to test the risks of confounding bias.\nNote: This protocol instructs the comparison of “mild” versus “progressive” respiratory failure patient groups. This protocol's model excels at discriminating factors associated with progression of respiratory failure—a dynamic process. Consequently, the utility of this model is maximized by examining the dynamics of biomarker trends over time rather than as static values at single time points."
