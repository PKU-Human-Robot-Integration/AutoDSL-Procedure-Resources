    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      Although six discrete mitochondrial compartments can be recognized in some\n      articles,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] to simplify the structure, we\n      roughly divide a mitochondrion into four compartments: outer mitochondrial\n      membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and matrix.\n      Mitochondrial proteins can be categorized into soluble and membrane\n      proteins (MPs). Soluble proteins are localized in intermembrane space and\n      mitochondrial matrix, whereas membrane proteins are associated with inner\n      or outer mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, membrane proteins can be\n      either peripheral or integral. Peripheral MPs crowd the surface of the\n      membrane through electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, or hydrophobic\n      interactions with lipid head groups or other integral MPs and can be\n      detached from the membrane by relatively mild treatments such as changing\n      the ionic strength or pH in the buffer. Integral MPs are firmly embedded\n      in the lipid bilayer by hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon\n      chains of lipids and the hydrophobic domains of proteins and can only be\n      removed by detergent solubilization.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] In addition, isotopes are\n      also used in localization by labeling proteins in mitochondria.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\n      The three methods to extract and localize proteins from mitochondria are\n      discussed subsequently.\n    \n      Localization of membrane-associated proteins by sonication\n    \nTiming: between 90 and 120 min\n    \n      Sonication can break mitochondrial through high frequency ultrasonic\n      vibration energy generated by ultrasonic generator. Thus, sonication can\n      distinguish between the membrane proteins (integral and peripheral) in the\n      pellet (P) and soluble proteins in the supernatant (S) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2454-Fig3.jpg\n          Figure 3.

    "to perform sonication.\n    \n        Resuspend the crude mitochondria fraction obtained in step 1 in 150 μL\n        of 1 × TD and collect in a 1.5 mL precooled tube. Clean the ultrasonic\n        homogenizer and set the power to 150 W and amplitude to 30% before\n        homogenizing the samples on ice for 1 min with a pause of 1 s every 1.5\n        s.\n      \nNote: Typically, before drying the probe\n      of the ultrasonic homogenizer, wash the probe with 15 mL of 75% ethanol\n      and subsequently with water at high pressure. Do not forget to keep a\n      portion as the control group.\n    \n        Allow the 1.5 mL tube containing mitochondrial suspension collected in\n        step 2 to stand on the ice and turn on the ultrasonic homogenizer to\n        sonicate the suspension (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2454-Fig4.jpg\n              Figure 4. Sonication of the sample on ice\n            \nCritical: The probe is close to the\n      bottom of the liquid and don’t touch the tube wall to avoid foam in the\n      process of ultrasound. This entire step is performed on ice to prevent\n      overheating caused by sonication. Be cautious during the procedure to\n      avoid splashes or extremely high temperatures.\n    \n        After sonication, transfer the suspension to the special centrifuge tube\n        of the ultra-speed Type 42.2 Ti Rotor and centrifuge for 40 min at\n        75,000 × g in Beckman Coulter Optima XPN-100 ultracentrifuge at\n        4°C (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).
