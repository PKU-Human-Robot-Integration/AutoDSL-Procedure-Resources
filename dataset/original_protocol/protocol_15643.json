    "All procedures described here were approved by the institutional review board of the Stratton VA Medical Center (approval number 1584762-9). The participant in the video gave informed consent for the use of their image and EMG signals in this publication.\nNOTE: The terms in bold indicate labels that should be visible on the hardware and/or in the software graphical user interface.\n1. Software setup\nGo to https://neurotechcenter.org/epocs for instructions on obtaining the latest software installer. Install the software using the downloaded installer.\nEnsure that the necessary drivers and manufacturer's software are installed for the digitizer. In particular, ensure that the NI-DAQmx installation includes 64-bit support.\nLaunch the NI-MAX application, select the device to be used under Devices and Interfaces, and ensure that its name is Dev1. Then, under Configure > Power-up States, ensure that the Line State checkbox for port 0 line 7 is unchecked (zeroed). Also, zero the corresponding Tristate checkbox, if there is one.\nUsing the Add or Remove Programs tool, remove any unnecessary software that might intermittently consume processor resources in the background, as this can lead to glitches in real-time signal processing. Make sure to remove any software update/troubleshooter suites provided by the computer's manufacturer, as these have been known to cause serious performance problems.\n\t​NOTE: The software setup steps above only need to be performed once for a given hardware configuration.\n2. Hardware setup\nSet up the digitizer to coordinate input and output as described below.\n\t\nUsing a short piece of solid-core insulated wire, patch the spring terminal for digital output port 0 line 7 (marked P0.7-or possibly DIO7 on older equipment) to the spring terminal for USER output.\nAttach a female/male/female BNC tee connector to the USER output. Connect the USER output to the external trigger input port of the stimulator.",
    "Connect the first and second amplified EMG signal cables to the first and second analog input channels of the data acquisition card, respectively. These are marked AI0 and AI1-or possibly ACH0 and ACH1 on older equipment. Make an additional connection from the USER output back into the third analog input channel (marked AI2 or ACH2).\nSet up the constant-current stimulator as described below.\n\tNOTE: To make the protocol generalizable to a variety of stimulator brands and models, this article describes manual stimulus intensity control rather than taking advantage of the option for automatic control of the particular stimulator models.\n\t\nTurn on the stimulator and configure it to deliver 1 ms monophasic pulses. For the DS8R model, ensure that stimulus intensity is controlled by the front panel or USB interface, not via the rear analog input. Plug in the long output cable and connect it to the snap leads that will attach to the stimulating electrode pads.\nSet up the analog amplifier to deliver at least two EMG channels as described below.\n\t\nTurn on the amplifier. Ensure all channel GAIN values are at their default value of 500 and the corresponding VARIABLE knobs are turned to their minimum value of 1.\nConnect the portable unit to the amplifier using the long cable. Insert two square 9 V batteries into the portable unit's battery pack. Strap the portable unit and battery pack around the participant's waist.\n3. Preparing stimulation and recording electrodes\nUse any previously noted landmarks or measurements to recreate previous participant-specific electrode positions as closely as possible. Prepare the skin where the electrodes will be attached by wiping with alcohol pads to remove excess oil, then wipe with a paper towel to remove dead skin.",
    "Attach the stimulation electrodes in position to stimulate the tibial nerve precisely, with minimal effect on the common peroneal nerve. Use the larger (22 mm x 35 mm) electrode as the anode and place it at the apex of the popliteal fossa where the sciatic nerve branches into tibial and common peroneal nerves. Place the cathode (22 mm x 22 mm) at the crease of the knee, directly below the anode, with a 3-4 cm separation between electrode centers.\nAttach the EMG recording electrodes in a bipolar montage at the target muscle (soleus) as follows.\n\t\nTo determine the correct location, first find the gastrocnemius muscle by palpating while the participant alternates between standing on their toes and standing naturally.\nPlace the first electrode directly below the distal border of the gastrocnemius muscle belly. Place the second electrode below the first, with a 5 cm spacing between electrode centers. Keep both electrodes in line with the Achilles tendon.\nAttach the EMG recording electrodes in a bipolar montage at the antagonist muscle (tibialis anterior). To do this, identify the muscle by palpating while the participant lifts (dorsiflexes) their toes. Place the electrodes on the muscle belly, about 1/3 of the way down from the fibular head to the ankle, with a 5 cm vertical separation between electrode centers.\nAttach a ground electrode at the patella.\nConnect the EMG amplifier leads as follows. Plug the green-taped active electrode into channel 1 on the portable unit and connect the red clips to the target-muscle electrodes (soleus) and the green clip to the ground electrode. Plug the black-taped active electrode into channel 2 on the portable unit and connect the clips to the antagonist-muscle electrodes (tibialis anterior).\nConnect the battery pack to the portable unit.\nConnect the stimulation snap leads to the stimulation electrodes.",
    "4. Using the EPOCS software\nPosition the monitor such that both the investigator and subject (or the therapist and patient) can see it clearly.\nLaunch an EPOCS session.\n\tNOTE: A session is defined as one visit to the laboratory or clinic, typically lasting 60-90 min.\n\t\nDouble-click the EPOCS icon to launch the application. Enter the participant ID code (or choose from the list of previously used IDs).\nIf this is a continuation of an existing session, e.g., if the software had to be re-launched following an interruption, press Continue Session. This will only be available if a session for the specified participant has been started in the last 3 h.\nOtherwise, press Start New Session. This will create a new data folder, date- and time-stamped and marked with the participant ID.\nVerify the electrode location and contact quality and adjust as necessary.\n\t\nEnsure that the Stimulus Test tab is displayed.\nIn Settings > Stimulation, configure the Min. Interval for Stimulus Test to 3 s. Note that this is configured separately from the Min. Interval for Normal Usage, which will typically be longer, around 5 s. Leave the Digitimer Link setting disabled.\n\t\tNOTE: When enabled, the Digitimer Link option would allow software control of the stimulation intensity when using certain stimulator models. The current protocol instead demonstrates manual control of stimulus intensity, which is applicable across multiple stimulator makes and models.\nOn the stimulator control panel, set the stimulus intensity to 5 mA and enable stimulation.\nAsk the participant to stand, with their hands partially supporting their weight on a walker if necessary.\nWarn the participant to expect stimulation, then press Start to start a new run (i.e., to start recording signals continuously to a new file). Runs will be numbered sequentially, and their files will never overwrite each other.",
    "Each repetition of stimulation is called a trial. The EMG responses elicited in each trial are shown immediately. Assess the M-wave and H-reflex elicited in the target muscle (the upper, blue trace) and antagonist muscle (the lower, red trace). If necessary, increase the current gradually to 10 mA or more, until the responses appear clearly.\nTo find the optimal location for stimulating (i.e., the location that yields the largest H-reflex), compare the evoked potentials after moving the cathode a full electrode-width medially and then laterally, followed by a half electrode-width medially and then laterally, and finally by a full electrode-width up and then down.\nMark, note, and photograph the position of the electrodes to aid repositioning in future sessions. If possible, make a plaster cast of the calf and the back of the knee and make holes in the cast that allow the marks to be re-applied precisely.\nOnce the optimal positions for the electrodes have been found, replace the repositioned electrodes with fresh electrodes.\nFor soleus conditioning, skip the Voluntary Contraction tab.\nMeasure the maximum M-wave and H-reflex sizes (Mmax and Hmax) by charting the recruitment curve, i.e., the relationship between stimulus intensity and response. Measure the recruitment curve as follows, before and after the control or training trials in each session. In the first session, use the recruitment curve to guide the selection of an appropriate stimulation intensity for use throughout the conditioning process.\n\t\nSwitch to the Recruitment Curve tab.",
    "In Settings > EMG, configure the ranges that the target and antagonist background EMG values must stay within to enable stimulation. For the soleus, assuming the maximum voluntary contraction has not been measured, simply ensure that the ranges encompass the EMG levels generated by natural weight-bearing during standing. Set the Background Hold Duration to 2 s to dictate how long the participant must continuously keep the EMG in range to trigger each stimulus.\n\t\tNOTE: The upper or lower limits may be left blank if no corresponding restriction is to be imposed.\nEnable the stimulator and set the intensity to the minimum value to be used in recruitment curve measurement: 5 mA. (This value is an example and should be chosen on a case-by-case basis-see discussion.)\nIf this is the participant's first session, allow them to practice keeping the EMG in the correct range for the required duration as described below.\n\t\t\nWith the participant standing, press Start. Demonstrate to the participant how the background EMG level in the target muscle is shown in real-time as the height of the bar against a shaded region that shows the target range.\nExplain to the participant that the activity from both muscles (target and antagonist) must be within their required ranges to turn the bar from a bright red to a darker green (although the antagonist activity level is not shown directly).\nTo adjust the background ranges, press Stop followed by Settings; then, enter the new numbers, press OK, then Start again. Press Stop when the practice run is finished.\nTo measure the recruitment curve, with the participant standing, press Start. If the H-reflex is already visible at the chosen starting intensity, gradually decrease the current until the H-reflex is no longer seen. Then, press Stop and again press Start to begin the run.",
    "Pay close attention to the Trials Completed counter. After every four trials, manually increase the stimulation intensity by 2 mA. (This value is an example and should be chosen on a case-by-case basis-see discussion.) Continue until M-wave size reaches a plateau, provided the participant does not report discomfort. Press Stop when done and invite the participant to sit down to rest.\nMake a note of the stimulus intensity values used for each trial. Associate any written records with the run number shown in the top right of the window. At the end of any run, enter this information manually into the session log, along with any other notes, via the Log tab.\n\t\tNOTE: If stimulation intensity is being controlled manually, this information will not be recorded by the software.\nPress the Analysis button to open the analysis window and allow definition of the M- and H-waves as follows. In the upper pane of the analysis window, examine the stimulus-locked overlay of the target-muscle signals from each trial in the last run.\nUse the mouse to adjust the beginning and end of the brown reference and green target intervals (in the H-reflex operant conditioning protocol, these correspond to M-wave and H-reflex, respectively). When the intervals are correct, press the red Use Marked Timings buttons to save these personalized interval settings for future analyses.\nIn the Sequence pane in the lower half of the analysis window, assess the resulting recruitment curve. Adjust the settings to view either peak-to-peak or mean-rectified amplitude and to pool results from consecutive trials. Since the stimulus current was increased every four trials, specify Trials to Pool: 4. Record the resulting Mmax and Hmax.\nIf this is the participant's first session, optimize the target-muscle EMG recording locations as follows.",
    "Move the soleus electrodes medially by a half electrode-width (or a full electrode-width if the muscle is wide enough). Then, repeat the steps above to gather a full recruitment curve and record the resulting Mmax and Hmax.\nMove the soleus electrodes the same distance laterally from their original position, and again perform a recruitment curve measurement to estimate Mmax and Hmax. Adopt the electrode positioning that maximizes Hmax and mark, note, and photograph their positions as in step 4.3.8.\nChoose a stimulus intensity that elicits a close-to-maximal H-reflex—ideally on the ascending (left-hand) slope of the H-reflex recruitment curve—but with the constraint that there must be a visible M-wave. Set this stimulus intensity value on the stimulator and note it for future sessions. Also, note the corresponding M-wave size (see discussion).\nMeasure the distribution of H-reflex sizes without giving response feedback as follows.\n\t\nSwitch to the Control Trials tab.\nWith the participant standing, press Start. As before, instruct the participant to use the feedback provided by the rising and falling bar to maintain the level of background muscle activity within the required range.\nIf this is a baseline or follow-up session, perform 75 trials in succession at the chosen stimulus intensity. If this is a conditioning session, perform just 20 trials. After the prescribed number of trials, press Stop to end the run.\nPress Analysis. As before, assess the overlay of trial-by-trial response waveforms in the upper panel and the Sequence of response sizes below. A new tab called Distribution is also activated by default, on top of Sequence. It shows the distribution of H-reflex sizes, with summary statistics on the right.\nPress Log Results to append the summary statistics to the session log.",
    "If this is a baseline session, repeat the above steps for a total of 3 runs of 75 trials each. Then, skip to the closing recruitment curve measurement in step 4.8.\nIf this is a conditioning session, set the Target Percentile to 66. The up- and down-conditioning criterion levels, along with the median, are shown by the vertical red lines. Select a criterion for conditioning by pressing the Up-Condition or Down-Condition button. For this protocol, press Down-Condition. This action will be logged automatically, and the analysis window will close.\n\t\tNOTE: In a down-conditioning protocol, a Target Percentile value of 66 means that a successful trial is defined as one in which the response size is in the bottom 66% of the previously measured distribution; conversely, in up-conditioning, success means producing a response size in the top 66% of the distribution.\nPerform operant conditioning as described below.\n\t\nSwitch to the Training Trials tab.\nWith the participant standing, press Start.\nIf the participant has not seen it before, draw their attention to the new feedback bar in the middle of the screen. Explain that it shows the most recent H-reflex size relative to the hatched target range. If the response falls within the target range, the trial will be counted as successful, and the bar will be dark green. If it falls outside the range, the trial will be counted as unsuccessful, and the bar will be a brighter red.\nThroughout the run, motivate the participant to perform as many successful trials as possible. The number of trials performed and the proportion of trials that were successful in the run so far are shown on the right of the screen. After 75 trials, press Stop to end the run.",
    "Press the Analysis button. The analysis window looks the same as it did for control trials. Again, use the Sequence tab to verify that the M-waves remained constant at the desired size.\nAs before, with the Distribution tab selected, use the Down-Condition button to update the operant conditioning criterion for the next run. Repeat the operant conditioning procedure 2x more, for a total of 3 runs of 75 trials each.\nAt the end of the session, perform another recruitment curve measurement as in steps 4.5.1.-4.5.6.\nFinish the session as described below.\n\t\nType up any additional session notes in the Log tab. The log is saved automatically as it is filled in in a date-stamped plain-text file in the session-specific data directory. Close the window. Data and logs will already have been saved.\nTo revisit the analysis window for previously recorded data, double-click the EPOCS Offline Analysis icon, and select the data file for the run to be analyzed. Wait for the raw signals to be processed (this may take 1 min or more).\n\t\t​NOTE: Data are saved as .dat files in BCI2000 format. The file name indicates the date and time of the session, the participant ID, the mode (ST for stimulus test, VC for voluntary contraction, RC for recruitment curve, CT for control trials, and TT for training trials), and the sequential run number.\n5. Performing multiple repeat sessions\nSchedule a total of 6 baseline sessions, 24 conditioning sessions (or 30, for people with neurological impairment), and 4 follow-up sessions. Schedule the baseline and conditioning sessions at a rate of 3 sessions/week, each session lasting no longer than 90 min. Arrange for all sessions to be conducted at the same time of day to minimize the effects of diurnal variation.",
    "In each of the 6 baseline sessions, conduct an initial Recruitment Curve run, 3 runs of 75 Control Trials, and a final Recruitment Curve run.\nIn each of the 24 (or 30) conditioning sessions, conduct an initial Recruitment Curve run, 1 run of 20 Control Trials, 3 runs of 75 Training Trials, and a final Recruitment Curve run.\nConduct 4 follow-up sessions at 10-14 days, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after the last conditioning session. Depending on the goals of the study, these may be identical to baseline sessions, or to conditioning sessions."
