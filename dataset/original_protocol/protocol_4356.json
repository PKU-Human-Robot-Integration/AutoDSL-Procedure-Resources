    "Healthy trichome-bearing leaves of B. villosa, soybean, and tomato were selected after growth in a greenhouse.Note: For B. villosa, up to 2 year old plant leaves can be used.Harvested leaves were cut into different sizes based on the size of the vessel used for the isolation of trichome (see Video 1 below). Note: One 3 cm x 3 cm leaf piece if using a 50 ml tube and two 10 cm x 4 cm strips if using 250 ml centrifuge bottles. The choice of tube and tissue size is dependent on the amount of trichome tissue needed for subsequent analyses (see recommendations below). For any leaf size used, the maximum purity trichome preparation achieved is ~20% of the total trichomes present on the leaf piece.Maximum 30% of the tube or bottle was filled with liquid N2 and capped (loosely screwed on) to prevent overflow during mixing (without tube breakage from N2 vapour pressure). Using gloves, tubes were mixed for 1 min in liquid N2 using a Genie 2 vortex mixer at maximum speed (level 8). One min vortexing maximizes the recovery of detached trichomes while minimizing the disruption of leaf tissue into small contaminating fragments that are difficult to remove later.The tubes were then kept fully open on ice to maximize liquid N2 evaporation.Large leaf pieces were manually removed from the tubes using forceps and retained as a trichome-stripped leaf control sample. Released trichomes adhering to the inside walls of the tube were gently suspended by swirling in 2 ml of sterile Millipore purified water. Water initially frozen in the tube (because of liquid N2) was kept on ice for 3-4 min to thaw.",
    "Thawed water from the tubes having trichomes (and also minute pieces of leaves) was sieved through a BD-Falcon nylon mesh cell strainer into a fresh 50 ml tubes. Minute pieces of leaves on the cell strainer netting were again manually removed using forceps. The strainer was then inverted over the same fresh tube.Trichomes were dislodged into the tube by gently sweeping them (i.e. rinsing the strainer with a pipette) using an additional 1-2 ml of Millipore water (see Video 1 below). Note: Cell strainers could be used up to 8-10 times before the pores became clogged. Intensive careful cleaning will help lengthen strainer use for additional 2-3 times, but new ones are preferred after pore clogging, and further cleaning will result in a hole in the strainer. Freshly prepared trichome batches (in water) and trichome-dislodged leaves (control) were immediately stored at 4 °C separately until all tissue sections were processed.1 ml of water containing trichomes was stained fresh by adding 0.5 ml of 0.4 % trypan blue. Contents were incubated for 3-4 h at room temperature (in the light or dark) without shaking in a petri-dish in preparation for microscopy.An Axiovert 100 microscope (10x magnification) was used to confirm the proportion of un-ruptured trichome cells and the quality of the preparation. Notes:The trichome isolation protocol has no washing step, but to obtain the image of trichomes (Figure 1) we conducted a washing step using water for improving the appearance of the trichomes.Intact cells are unstained; disrupted cells are stained blue; a poor quality preparation would contain more disrupted trichomes and/or a greater proportion of contaminating leaf tissue fragments compared with Figure 1. The samples were then flash frozen in liquid N2, stored at -80 °C for 4-5 h, and freeze dried overnight in a FlexidryTM unit.",
    "The method can be used for purifying non-glandular trichomes from other plant species (Figure 1).Suggested leaf sample size for isolating B. villosa trichomes for various purposes (leaves with 300-500 µm trichome length, ~4,000 trichomes/cm2 and 1 mg of dried trichomes isolation from 100 g of fresh leaf tissue [FL]): (a) for electron microscopic structural analysis (100/cm2); (b) for RNA isolation (300 g FL); (c) for biochemical extraction (500 g FL); for HPLC-UV analysis (500 g FL); for NMR structural analysis (800-1,000 g FL); for metal content analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (500 g FL).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141222/20141222003356_6533.jpgFigure 1.
