    "Prepare a 100 mM stock solution of E2 by dissolving 2.72 mg of 17β-estradiol in 100 µl ethanol or DMSO in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and mix contents gently. Spin briefly and make serial dilutions (1:10) to yield 10 mM, 1 mM, and 0.1 mM stock concentrations using the solvent. Store all E2 stock solutions at -20 °C.\nPrepare a 100 mM stock solution of ICI by dissolving 6.07 mg of ICI 182,780 in 100 µl EtOH or DMSO in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and mix contents gently. Spin briefly and make serial dilutions (1:10) to yield 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM stock concentrations using the solvent. Store all ICI stock solutions at -20 °C.\nThe vehicle is the solvent (ethanol or DMSO). Place 0.5-1 ml of 100% ethanol or DMSO in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and store at -20 °C.\n2. Cell Culture and Treatment\nPerform each treatment in double or triplicate plates for technical replicates. Repeat cell culture procedure and treatment using a different passage of the same cell line, which would serve as a biological replicate of this cell line. Repeat the procedure with a different cell line to replicate findings in more than one cell line. All cell culture techniques should be performed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.\nCell culture startup\n\t\t\nWarm the media to 37 °C in a sterile warm water bath.\nThaw a frozen vial of T47D or MCF7 cells.\nClean the outside of vial and media bottle with 70% ethanol, and then place both vial and bottle in sterile laminar flow hood.\nLabel a sterile T-75 flask accordingly (in the hood).\nAdd 12-15 ml of appropriate media into the flask using a sterile serological pipette (ensure that surface is completely covered with media).",
    "Transfer the cells from the vial to the flask, and mix gently.\nPlace flask in a 37 °C incubator, supplied with 5% CO2.\nPreparation of cells for treatment\n\t\t\nTake cells out of the incubator and observe under a microscope to ensure that the cells are at least 80% confluent. This is to ensure that there are enough cells for experiment. Transfer flask to sterile hood.\nRemove media from flask using a sterile Pasteur pipette connected to a vacuum. Gently wash attached cells twice with PBS.\nAdd 1 ml of warm trypsin-EDTA to the flask, and put flask in the incubator for 2 min. This is to make the cells detach from the flask.\nAdd about 3-4 ml of appropriate warm media to the flask and triturate the detached cells using a 5 ml serological pipette. Triturate by taking up the cells in the serological pipette and releasing the cells with the tip of the pipette placed against the bottom of the flask to increase pressure. This is to break the cells apart into single cells.\nCount the cells, e.g. using a cell counter, according to manufacturer's protocol.\nLabel 100 mm plates (as needed) and add about 10 ml media to the plates. Plate about 2.0 x 106 cells/plate. Distribute cells by gentle swirling the plates.\nIncubate cells for 24-48 hr, until approximately 80% confluent.\nAt 80% confluency, wash cells twice with PBS, and add the appropriate 5% DCC-FBS media. Then, incubate cells for 24 hr.\nAfter 24 hr, wash cells twice with PBS, and add the appropriate 0.5% DCC-FBS media. Then, incubate cells for additional 48 hr.\nCell treatment\n\t\t\nAfter 48 hr, wash cells twice with PBS. Be sure to remove as much of the PBS as possible.",
    "In a 15 ml conical tube, add 10 ml of the appropriate 0.5% DCC-FBS media. Then, add 1 µl of the 0.1 mM ligand stock (E2 or ICI) for a final concentration of 10 nM. Also, add 1 µl of vehicle to 10 ml media in a separate tube for the control experiment.\nMix contents in tube gently and add to cells in the plate. This should be one ligand per plate.\nIncubate cells for the chosen time point (0-72 hr).\n3. RNA Extraction and Quality Control\nRNA extraction\n\t\t\nAfter treatment is finished for the desired period of time, wash cells twice with PBS, then add about 1-2 ml Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol solution to the cells in the plate. CAUTION: Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol solution is toxic by contact with skin or eyes, by inhalation, or if swallowed. Wear suitable protective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection, and use fume hood.\nEnsure that the volume of cells is no more than 10% of the volume of Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol solution, and that the plate is covered with the solution and allow to sit for 1 min. Then, scrape cells using a rubber scraper and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube. Cells can be stored in this solution at -80 °C for weeks.\nExtract and purify total RNA from each treatment using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method followed by spin column purification and DNase I DNA degradation method for animal cells.\nAfter extraction, cells are eluted in 60 µl RNase-free water. Aliquot 1-2 µl RNA for quantification analysis and store RNA at -80 °C.",
    "Measure the RNA concentrations using 1 µl of RNA and aspectrophotometer. Ensure that there is a blank taken before any measurement is done. Also, completely wipe the spectrophotometer reach time a measurement is taken. Concentrations are usually shown in ng/µl. Save results showing RNA concentrations.\nRNA quality control\n\t\t\nTake about 100 ng RNA of each sample and place in a microcentrifuge tube.\nMeasure RNA integrity using a bioanalyzer. Usually 12 samples can be run at one time in a bioanalyzer. Run usually takes about 25 min.\nCompare results with the RNA ladder to ensure that the RNA is good for experiment. Save and print results.\n4. Confirmation of Treatment: qPCR of Protein-coding Genes\ncDNA synthesis\n\t\t\nTake 500 ng or 1 µg of the total RNA (of each sample) and put in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Bring the volume of each tube up to 10 µl using RNAse-free water.\nAdd 2 µl of 50 µM random hexamer primers and heat tubes to 70 °C for 10 min.\nTransfer tubes to ice for 5min.\nFor each sample, add 4 µl of 5x first strand buffer, 1 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µl of superscript III, and 1.5 µl RNase-free water.\nPlace tubes in a 25 °C heat block or water bath for 10 min.\nTransfer tubes to a 46 °C heat block for 1 hr. Then, transfer tubes to a 70 °C heat block for 15 min to stop the reaction.\nDilute the cDNA to a 5 ng/µl stock (calculated using total RNA input) using RNase-free water for dilutions and store at -20 °C.\nqPCR",
    "Obtain primers for genes of interest and reference genes. Primers can easily be designed using the primer designing tool on NCBI's Primer-BLAST program12. This usually generates a forward and reverse primer for each gene of interest. Primers should be 18-22 bp in length, have a melting temperature of 52-58 °C, have a GC content of 40-60%, and an amplicon length of 100-180 bp.\nFor each qPCR reaction well, add 10 ng cDNA (2 µl from stock concentration from step 4.1.7), 1 pmol of each of the forward and reverse primers of the gene of interest (from step 4.2.1), and 5 µl of 2x Cyanine dye PCR master mix. The reaction for each well should have a 10 µl final reaction volume.\nEnsure that there are triplicate wells for each sample for each gene (for technical replicates). A 96-well reaction plate can be used.\nOn the qRT-PCR system software, assign the reporter and target, enter reaction volume, select the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt) method, and define sample wells.\nMake sure to perform melting curve analysis for all Cyanine dye runs to confirm the amplification of one specific fragment. Run plates using the default settings for the run.\nSave results after run, and export data (especially the CT values to MS Excel).\nqPCR data analysis using the ΔΔCT formula\n\t\tThe change in relative mRNA expression can be calculated as fold change relative to control on Excel for each sample using the following steps:\n\t\t\nAll exported results from the qPCR above should have the Ct values included. Calculate the ΔCT value using the formula below:\n\t\t\t\t\nΔCT = CT (target gene) - CT (reference gene)\n\t\t\t\tThis should be done for each sample. The target is the gene or miRNA of interest.",
    "Next, calculate the total standard deviation (SD) for each sample. First calculate the SD for the reference gene and then calculate the SD for the target gene (this can be done on excel using the STD DEV function on the CT values). Then calculate the total SD for each sample using this formula:\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal SD = (SD2 (target) + SD2(reference))1/2\nCalculate the ΔΔCT of each sample within a gene (target) by:\n\t\t\t\t\nΔΔCT = ΔΔCT (treated/test sample) - ΔΔCT(control/calibrator sample)\n\t\t\t\tThe calibrator sample is the untreated sample.\nFinally, calculate the fold-change (FC) values of each sample using the formula:\n\t\t\t\t\nFC = 2-ΔΔCT\n\t\t\t\tThe fold-change value of each sample gives the relative expression of the gene/miRNA which has been normalized to the reference gene and the control sample.\nStudent's t-test can be used for statistical analysis by using two-tailed distribution and two-sample unequal variance parameters: (P<0.001 (***), P<0.01 (**), and P<0.05 (*)). This can be achieved on Excel. Confirm that the treatment resulted in regulation of known targets before proceeding with miRNA profiling.\n5. miRNA Profiling Analysis\nmiRNA microarray\n\t\t\nTake 5 µg of isolated RNA from cells treated with either vehicle or ligand, and place in a microcentrifuge tube. Adjust volume in tube to 20 µl. Each comparison should be performed in duplicates or triplicates.\nPerform the miRNA microarray using the RNA samples above. miRNA microarray expression profiles should be determined using human miRNA microarray dual-color sample array by µParaflo Microfluidic Biochip Technology (Sanger miRBase Release 14.0)13.\nResults should show differentially expressed miRNAs. Consider significant miRNA expressions when p<0.05.p-value <0.10 can also be considered for further confirmatory analysis using qPCR. Save this miRNA list for further validation with qPCR.\nmiRNA profiling: DLP-LDA",
    "Each sample should be analysed in duplicates or triplicates. Take 700 ng of total RNA from cells treated with either vehicle or ligand, and place in a microcentrifuge tube. Adjust volume in tube to 3 µl.\nPerform the cDNA synthesis using the Dual Labeled Probes miRNA assay method and the 10x RT primers. Total volume for each reaction should be 7.5 µl.\nPlace reaction tube in the PCR system Thermocycler, and set to recommended parameters as indicated in Dual Labeled Probes miRNA assay method. Start the run. This will generate cDNA. Note that the cDNA can be stored at -20 °C for at least 1 week.\nWhile RT reaction is running, take out the DLP-LDA plates and allow to sit at room temperature. Each array plate contains 384 wells that contain unique miRNA primers and control primers.\nTake 6 µl of the cDNA (from 5.2.3 ) and place in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 450 µl of the Dual Labeled Probes 2x Universal PCR Master mix and add 444 µl RNase-free water.\nInvert tube about six times to mix contents, and centrifuge briefly.\nWhen the DLP-LDA plate has reached room temperature, load 100 µl into each of the eight 'Fill port' of the plate. Then, centrifuge the array plate.\nOpen the qRT-PCR system and check that the block is that for the 384-well plate. Set up run using the SDS software. Select relative quantification (Ct), select the well number and array type, and enter sample description to define wells.\nRun array using the default thermal cycling conditions. When run is finished, save results and export to MS Excel and save for further analysis using the ΔΔCT formula (step 4.3).\n6. Confirmation of miRNA Regulations using Separate qPCR Analysis\nCyanine dye qPCR analysis",
    "Design primers for desired miRNA analysis. Sequence of the mature miRNA, which equals the forward primer, can be obtained from mirbase.org14. Convert all 'U' to 'T'.\nPrepare cDNA: Take 1 µg of total RNA and place in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Follow the instructions for polyA tailing and first-strand cDNA synthesis of miRNA from a miRNA first-strand cDNA Synthesis and qRT-PCR protocol. Dilute the resulting cDNA (1:10) and store at -20 °C.\nObtain one 96-well reaction plate.\nFor each miRNA qPCR reaction well, add 16 ng of polyA cDNA (from step 6.1.2), 2 pmol of each of the specific forward primer (from step 6.1.1) and the universal primer (from the kit from step 6.1.2), and 5 µl of 2x qPCR master mix. Final reaction volume is 10 µl/well.\nEnsure that there are triplicate wells for each sample for each miRNA (for technical replicates). Also, make sure that a reference gene (usually U6 snRNA) is included.\nOn the qRT-PCR system software, assign the reporter and target, enter reaction volume, select the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT) method, and define sample wells.\nRun plates using the default settings for the run. Make sure to perform melting curve analysis for all Cyanine dye runs. Each melting curve should show only one specific peak to confirm the amplification of one specific fragment. If more than one peak or no clear peak is observed, the primers are not specific and the data cannot be used.\nSave results after run, and export data (especially the CT values to MS Excel).\nDual Labeled Probes qPCR analysis\n\t\t\nTake 10 ng of each total RNA, each in a 5 µl volume and place in 0.2 ml microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Follow instructions from the protocol on performing the reverse transcription (RT) using the Dual Labeled Probes MicroRNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit15. Each total reaction volume should be 15 µl. Note that for the Dual Labeled Probes RT reactions, there are specific primers for each miRNA to be studied.\nPlace reaction tube in the PCR system thermocycler, and set parameters according to the protocol indicated in step 6.2.2 above. Start the run. It should take about 70-80 min.\nAfter the RT reaction, dilute the sample cDNA in a 1:5 ratio, and store all cDNA in the dark at -20 °C.\nObtain one 96-well reaction plate.\nFor each miRNA qPCR reaction well, add the following: 10 µl of Dual Labeled Probes 2x Universal PCR Master Mix (same reagent as step 5.2.5), 7.67 µl of RNase-free water, 1 µl of 20× real-time assay primer (specific for each miRNA), and 1.33 µl of the cDNA from step 6.2.4 above. This should be a 20 µl final reaction volume. Mix contents gently, and centrifuge briefly.\nEnsure that there are triplicate wells for each sample for each miRNA (for technical replicates). Also, make sure that a reference gene (usually U6 snRNA) is included.\nOn the qRT-PCR system software, assign the reporter (FAM) and quencher (NFQ-MGB) for each miRNA (target) of interest, enter reaction volume, select the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt) method, and define sample wells.\nFollow the instructions for setting up the parameters for the qPCR run from the Dual Labeled Probes microRNA assay protocol.
