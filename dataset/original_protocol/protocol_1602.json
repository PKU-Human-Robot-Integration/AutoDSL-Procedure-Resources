    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of pure Hpb eggs & E. coli HA107 monoculture\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, egg-laying adult Hpb worms are isolated from the duodenum of infected mice, washed, and incubated overnight in antibiotic-containing media. The following day, the eggs produced by these worms are isolated, washed, and incubated at a higher concentration of antibiotics overnight. During this second overnight incubation, a pure monoculture of E. coli HA107 is grown – this will serve as the food source for Hpb hatched from these sterilized eggs.\nCritical: All steps in this protocol, where possible, should be performed under a biological safety cabinet. All utensils and media should be autoclaved, and all non-autoclavable liquids should be filter-sterilized.\nExtract adult worms\nFill a sterile 100 × 15 mm Petri dish with 20 mL of Low Antibiotic Media (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nExcise duodenums from C57BL/6J mice infected 2–4 weeks with Hpb.\nUsing sterile scissors and forceps, open the infected duodenum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), and carefully pick out adult Hpb worms, placing them into the 20 mL of prepared media. Worms can be extracted in clumps, and do not need to be picked individually.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1166-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Depiction of adult Hpb worm isolation steps\n(A) The duodenum of a mouse infected 2–4 weeks with fecal-grown Hpb, cut open longitudinally to reveal clumps of egg-producing adult worms in red, which can be removed with sterile forceps.\n(B) Between crude washes of isolated adult Hpb worms, allow the worms to sediment to the bottom of the tube (as shown) by gravity. Photo demonstrates the approximate clarity of media before and after all washes.\n(C) Depiction of overnight adult Hpb incubation setup, where isolated and washed adult worms are incubated in ∼30 mL of antibiotic-containing RPMI (Low Antibiotic Media) and left overnight.",
    "(D) Example of adult Hpb worm cultures after 18 h of incubation, photographed through a Brightfield microscope at 10× resolution. Hpb eggs can be seen surrounding adult worms in the dish.\nCritical: Avoid transferring large quantities of mucus or luminal debris. Additionally, take care to preserve worm viability during extraction by not crushing adult worms with the forceps during extraction.\nWash and incubate adult worms\nPipette the worms and media into a sterile 50 mL tube, then complete the volume of the tube to 50 mL using sterile room temperature (20°C–25°C) PBS.\nCap and invert the tube several times, then allow the worms to sediment by gravity for roughly 30 s, or until most worms have collected at the bottom of the tube.\nUse a sterile pipette to aspirate off the supernatant above the worms, then complete the volume of the tube to 50 mL with sterile PBS once again. Perform this wash step a minimum of 8 times. The PBS should become increasingly clear as crude luminal debris is washed away (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAfter the final wash, pipette off all but 5 mL of media.\nPrepare a new sterile 100 × 15 mm Petri Dish with 25 mL of Low Antibiotic Media (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nPipette the worms into the dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), and incubate overnight at 37°C , 5% CO2 for 18 h.\nIsolation and Incubation of Hpb Eggs\nAfter overnight incubation, eggs should be visible alongside adult Hpb worms (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Filter the contents of the Petri dish through a 70μm strainer into a sterile 50 mL tube. Adult Hpb worms should be removed from the egg-containing flow-through by size filtration.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 1000g for 4 min at 4°C, discard supernatant. Pellet will contain Hpb eggs.",
    "Resuspend the eggs in 5 mL of sterile 4°C de-ionized water and transfer to a sterile 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge eggs at 700g for 2 min at 4°C. Wash with de-ionized water 2 additional times.\nAfter the final wash, resuspend the egg pellet in 14 mL of High Antibiotic Media (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Incubate the eggs for 24 h at 4°C. To ensure even antibiotic treatment, place the eggs on an orbital shaker, or orient the 15 mL tube horizontally to prevent the eggs from pooling at the bottom due to gravity.\nOvernight culture of E. coli HA107\nUnder a biological safety cabinet, fill 1 sterile Erlenmeyer flask with 100 mL of LB Media, and two sterile Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 mL each of LB Supp Media (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nFrom a pre-streaked plate of E. coli HA107, split a single colony, inoculating one half in 100 mL of LB Media, and the other half in 100 mL of LB Supp Media. This can be done using a sterile pipette tip to scrape the half-colony and dropping it into the media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Use the third flask of LB Supp Media as a negative control, containing a pipette tip (with no bacteria).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1166-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Depiction of E. coli HA107 steps\n(A) When E. coli is streaked onto LB and LB Supp Agar media from a glycerol stock and incubated overnight at 37°C, bacteria should grow only on the latter media, as depicted. As is demonstrated in the right picture, E. coli HA107 can be inoculated by picking a single colony with an autoclaved pipette tip (handled with sterile forceps) and dropped into liquid media.\n(B) HA107 should only grow in the appropriate overnight cultures.",
    "Seal the Erlenmeyer flasks with autoclaved aluminum foil, and shake overnight (14–18 h) in a bacterial incubator at 250rpm, 37°C.\nSet aside two separate 10 mL aliquots of sterile LB Supp Media in 50 mL tubes, and leave at room temperature (20°C–25°C) overnight. These will be needed for the dilution of the overnight culture when measuring the optical density at 600nm (OD600) (done at a benchside spectrophotometer – will become non-sterile). The other will be used for the final dilution of overnight cultures.\nAlternative: Use any sterile means to appropriately inoculate the E. coli HA107 (e.g.: inoculating loop).\nNote: If using autoclaved pipette tips for colony inoculation, handle the tips with a pair of autoclaved forceps, not gloves.\nPreparation and growth of gnotobiotic Hpb larvae\nTiming: approximately 6 days\nIn this step, antibiotic-treated Hpb eggs are washed and incubated with pure E. coli HA107 overnight culture. After hatching, Hpb will utilize this restricted food source for growth and develop into the infective L3 stage of larvae.\nWashing and Enumeration of Hpb eggs\nCentrifuge the 15 mL tube containing Hpb eggs at 1000g for 4 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and wash the eggs with a full 14 mL of sterile 4°C de-ionized water.\nCentrifuge the eggs at 700g for 2 min and repeat the wash with sterile 4°C de-ionized water a minimum of 7 more times.\nAfter the final wash, resuspend the eggs in 10 mL of sterile 4°C de-ionized water. Using a sterile pipette tip, pipette a minimum of five 10μL aliquots onto a microscope slide, and count the number of eggs per aliquot under a microscope. Calculate the total number of eggs present in the 10 mL.",
    "Centrifuge the eggs once more at 700g for 2 min and resuspend them to a concentration of 20 eggs/μL in sterile 4°C de-ionized water. Place at 4°C while performing step 6.\nNote: Though numbers may vary, the worms from one Hpb-infected mouse yields roughly 5,000–8,000 Hpb eggs.\nCritical: Keeping Hpb eggs at 4°C delays hatching, but not indefinitely. Use the Hpb eggs the day of to ensure the proper timing of larval growth in this protocol.\nOptional: Plate some eggs onto LB and YPD agar and incubate at least 24 hours at 37°C to validate the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment.\nPreparation of E. coli HA107\nObtain the overnight cultures of E. coli HA107. Growth should only have occurred in the flask containing LB Supp Media inoculated with E. coli HA107 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUsing a spectrophotometer, measure the OD600 of E. coli HA107 grown in LB Supp Media.\nKeep the flask under a biological safety cabinet and bring a small (∼1 mL) aliquot of bacterial culture to the benchside spectrophotometer to preserve the purity of the flask bacteria.\nMeasure and record the dilution required to achieve an OD600 between 0.7 and 0.8. To perform these bench-side dilutions, use one of the two aliquots of LB Supp Media saved from the previous day.\nCritical: Ensure you have 2 aliquots of LB Supp Media set aside as mentioned in step 4c, and only use one of these for the spectrophotometer-related dilutions in step 6b. This aliquot will become un-sterile once opened at the bench-side spectrophotometer and is to be discarded after OD600 values are recorded. Do NOT bring this aliquot back under the hood and use it to dilute the HA107 bacteria that will go into the gnotobiotic larvae cultures (use the second un-opened aliquot of LB Supp media for this).",
    "Dilution of E. coli HA107 and preparation of gnotobiotic Hpb growth plates\nUsing the other sterile aliquot of LB Supp Media saved from the previous day (step 4c), dilute pure E. coli HA107 down to an OD600 of 0.7–0.8.\nCritical: Dilutions must be done with LB Supp Media (not regular LB Media).\nIn a sterile Eppendorf tube, combine 100μL of E. coli HA107 (OD600 = 0.7–0.8) with 5000 Hpb eggs. Refer to the dilutions tabulated at the spectrophotometer to calculate how to achieve this (e.g.,: if a D4 of the bacterial culture gave an OD600 of 0.740, then the 100μL should comprise 25μL of pure bacterial culture, and 75μL of LB Supp Media.\nPipette these egg-bacterial mixture onto nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Gently rotate the plates in an orbital manner to spread the mixture in a circle, leaving a gap between the liquid and edge of the dish.\nPlace the seeded plates into sterile plastic bags and seal shut (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Cover these plates with aluminum foil and leave them in the dark at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 2 days\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1166-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Depiction of setup for the growth of gnotobiotic larvae\nAfter combining 5000 Hpb eggs with 100μL of E. coli HA107 (OD600 0.7-0.8), pipette the mixture onto an NGM agar plate, and spread into a rough circle and seal individually in sterile plastic bags as shown. Keep in the dark for 2 days, water, and then harvest after a total of 5 days.\nAfter 2 days, carefully open the bags and add 1–2 mL of sterile room temperature (20°C–25°C) de-ionized water on top of the bacteria and larvae (plates will have dried noticeably).\nRe-bag the plates and leave in the dark for another 3 days.",
    "Harvest and washing of E. coli HA107-grown larvae\nHarvest Hpb larvae by gently pipetting sterile 4°C de-ionized water across the surface of the NGM culture plates. Collect the larvae into a sterile 15 mL tube.\nCritical: The water used to harvest HA107-grown Hpb must be cold (as well as sterile). Larvae must be kept on ice during harvest.\nComplete the tube to 14 mL with cold sterile de-ionized water, and centrifuge at 700g for 2 min at 4°C.\nRepeat this wash a minimum of 3 more times.\nCritical: Larval washes must be performed immediately upon harvest to preserve larval viability.\nCalculate the number of viable L3 Hpb larvae by manual counting of 10μL aliquots under a microscope. Dead larvae do not move and adopt an erect shape. L3 Hpb are distinguishable from other larval stages by long, slender morphology, the presence of a sheath/cuticle, size, as well as a distinct rapid movement pattern (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1166-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of gnotobiotic larval growth culture results\nAfter 4–5 days of growth, gnotobiotic larval cultures can be harvested and washed before counting and observation. Shown is a photograph of gnotobiotic larvae at 10× magnification on a brightfield microscope. Minimal visible contamination or bacteria is present around the larvae. L3 larvae can be distinguished from non-infectious L1/2 larvae by their distinct long and slender morphology, size, and rapid movement pattern. Dead L3 Hpb are non-moving and erect.\nTest the sterility of the larvae by plating 200 L3 (standard infectious dose) each on LB and YPD agar plates, and incubating these plates at least 24 h at 37°C.\nStore HA107-grown Hpb larvae at 4°C and use within 1 week of harvest.",
    "Prior to use, add 50μM of EDTA to larval suspensions to prevent sticking to the interior of the tube, and recount as in (a). Keep the larvae on ice during infection.\nNote: Though numbers may vary, one Hpb-infected mouse yields roughly 1,000 infective L3 larvae."
