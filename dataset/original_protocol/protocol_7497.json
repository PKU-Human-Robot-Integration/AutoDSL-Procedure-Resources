    "Cell culture HEK293T cultureGrow HEK293T cells (2 × 106) in a 6-well plate and culture in normal growth media (see Recipe 2) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Use 293T cells to prepare lentivirus.FIB cultureGrow FIB cells (1 × 107) in a 100 mm plate and culture in normal growth media (see Recipe 2) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Use FIB cells as control cells of iPSC.iPSC cultureNote: Feeder cells can enhance the growth and reproduction of iPSCs, maintain pluripotency, and inhibit differentiation. In this assay, the feeding layer is made with FIB cells. After being treated with mitomycin, FIBs lose their mitotic ability and will die during digestion and inoculation, which has no impact on subsequent experiments. Coat a 100 mm plate with 2 mL of 0.1% gelatin and place in an incubator at 37 °C for 2 h.Wash the plate twice with PBS and discard PBS before use.Seed FIB cells (served as feeder layer) on the gelatin-coated plate and grow to ~70% confluency.Add mitomycin C (final concentration of 10 μg/mL) and incubate for 2 h to block mitosis.Wash the plate twice with PBS.Grow iPSCs (1 × 106) on feeder layer and culture in knockout growth media (see Recipe 1) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Lenti-dCas9 construction (Figure 1A) Design gRNAs using Broad Institute website (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public]).Synthesize pU6-gRNA1-pH1-gRNA2 cassette using JH3915-JH3986, JH3987-JH3988, and JH3989-J441 primers (1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 32 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min).Use Age I and Not I restriction enzymes (37 for 30 min) and T4 DNA ligase (22 for 10 min) to insert Sox2 gRNAs or gCTs downstream from U6 promotor in the lenti-dCas9 vector.",
    "Use DH5α competent cells for transformation.Confirm the correct cloning by sequencing and extract the plasmid with GeneAll Hybrid-Q Plasmid Rapidprep.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4718/bioprotoc-13-14-4718-g001.jpgFigure 1. Plasmid maps and sample preliminary detection. (A) Map of lenti-dCas9 plasmid. Sox2-gRNA1 and Sox2-gRNA2 were inserted into the vector using Age I and Not I. (B) Preliminary detection of gRNA specific binding sites in chromatin-RNA in situ reverse transcription (CRIST) samples by PCR (using pSox2-F and pSox2-R primers). The sequence of gRNA specific binding sites cannot be detected in anti-IgG sample but can be detected in anti-Flag sample and input control, which demonstrates the specificity of the method. The anti-IgG here served as background control. (C) Sample specific testing was performed by real-time PCR using specific primers derived from the pSox2 targeting site, 5′-Ct control site, and off-target site. pSox2: targeting site in the Sox2 promoter where the Cas9 gRNAs are designed; 5′-Ct: fragment that is 14.6 kb away from the pSox2 target site and is used as the control site. Cas9 vector: cells that were treated with the Cas9 control vector that lacks the gRNAs; Cas9-gRNA: cells that were targeted by both Cas9 and Sox2 gRNAs; Cas9-gCT: cells that were treated with the random control gRNA vector. Off-target: CRIST control site that is 33.8 kb upstream of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. All data shown are mean ± SEM from three independent experiments by normalization over the IgG control. (∗∗) P < 0.01 as compared with the Cas9 Vector and Cas9-gCT controls.Lentiviral packaging and transfection Grow 293T cells to ~70% confluency for lentiviral packaging.Change the normal growth media to Opti-MEM 1h before packaging.Put 5 μg of PEI and 100 μL of Opti-MEM into a tube. Add 0.8 μg of psPAX2, 0.4 μg of PMD2.G, and 0.8 μg of lenti-dCas9 (carrying pSox2-gRNAs or gCTs).",
    "Mix and let stand for 20 min; then, add them to the culture media of 293T cells.Change to normal growth media (see Recipe 2) 6 h later.Collect virus supernatants at 24, 48, and 72 h, add PEG-it to the collected medium, incubate overnight at 4 °C, and spin at 1,500× g for 30 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend viral particles in 100 μL of PBS.Grow iPSCs and fibroblasts (FIB) in 100 mm plates to ~50% confluency.Mix 20 μL of lentivirus solution with polybrene (final concentration of 5–10 ng/μL) and add it to culture medium.Change medium after 24 h and use puromycin (0.5–2 μg/mL) to select puromycin-resistant cells.Intranuclear RNA reverse transcription Note: In order to protect unstable RNAs, we performed intranuclear in situ reverse transcription prior to the subsequent steps and labeled RNAs with biotin-dCTP during reverse transcription. Collect iPSCs and fibroblasts (~1 × 107), resuspend with 1 mL of PBS, and add 54 μL of 37% formaldehyde (final concentration of 2%) for 10 min at room temperature. Quench the formaldehyde with 60 μL of 2 M glycine (with a final concentration of 0.125 M) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Wash both iPSCs and fibroblasts with PBS twice, resuspend with 800 μL of hypotonic buffer (see Recipe 3), and incubate for 5 min on ice to lyse the cell membranes.Centrifuge samples for 10 min at 1,500× g and wash twice with hypotonic buffer (without NP-40).Conduct intranuclear RNA reverse transcription at 65 °C for 30 min in a 20 μL reaction with biotin-dCTP (1 μL of 50 μM random hexamer, 1 μL of 10 mM dNTP, 1 μL of 0.4 mM biotin-dCTP, 1 μL of Maxima reverse transcriptase, 0.5 μL of RNase inhibitors, 1 μL of 0.",
    "1 M DTT, 4 μL of 5× cDNA synthesis buffer, and RNase-free water to 20 μL). Use 4 μL of 0.5 M EDTA to stop the reaction.Centrifuge samples at 1,600× g for 10 min at 4 °C. Wash twice with ice-cold PBS.Ultrasonic disintegration Resuspend cell pellets with 300 μL of sonication buffer (see Recipe 4).Note: Using too much liquid may lead to splashing, and using too little liquid may produce foam. Clamp the sample tubes and the ultrasonic probe together and place them on ice.Put the 2 mm ultrasonic probe 1 cm below the liquid level.Note: In order to avoid foaming, the probe should always be kept below the liquid level Shear DNAs into segments of 200–1,000 base pairs for 15 min (10 s on and 20 s off) at an amplitude of 40%.Divide 300 μL of sonicated DNAs into three portions (149, 149, and 2 μL). Use the two equal portions for immunoprecipitation (using anti-Flag and anti-IgG antibody respectively) and the 2 μL portion for input control.Immunoprecipitation of biotin-cDNA and dCas9 To reduce non-specific background, use Protein A/G mix magnetic beads (5 μL/ChIP) to pre-clear the sonicated samples.Put 5 μL of protein A/G beads in a new tube and wash twice with beads binding & washing buffer (see Recipe 6).Dilute sonicated samples (10-fold) with ChIP dilution buffer (see Recipe 5), mix with 5 μL of washed protein A/G beads, and incubate at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min.Discard protein A/G magnetic bead pellet in a magnetic rack and transfer sonicated samples to new tubes.Add anti-Flag and anti-IgG antibodies (2–5 μg/ChIP) to experimental and control groups, respectively, and incubate overnight at 4 °C with rotation.",
    "To enrich the immunoprecipitation samples, add 10 μL of pre-cleared protein A/G magnetic beads to samples and incubate at room temperature with rotation for 30 min. Wash the beads three times with Protein A/G Beads binding & washing buffer.Discard the supernatant and elute the immunoprecipitation samples twice with 100 μL of elution buffer (see Recipe 7).Streptavidin-biotin capture Put M-280 streptavidin beads in a new tube and wash twice with beads binding & washing buffer (see Recipe 8).Transfer 200 μL of eluent samples to the washed beads, add 50 μL of 5 M NaCl (final concentration of 1 M), and incubate for 30 min with rotation at room temperature.Discard the supernatant, elute the samples with 100 μL of elution buffer (see Recipe 9) twice, and collect 200 μL of eluate.De-crosslink chromatin complex Transfer 200 μL of eluate into a new tube.Neutralize the elution buffer with 20 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).Incubate samples and the input at 70 °C for 60 min with 20 μL of 5 M NaCl, 10 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, 20 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 μL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K, 2 μL of RNase inhibitor, and 226 μL of RNase-free water using an Eppendorf thermomixer.Note: This step can also be used to extract proteins for identification and analysis. This is an extended use of this method. Purify cDNAs: Mix samples with equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and stand for 30 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge at 1,600× g for 10 min at 4 °C, collect supernatant, mix with equal volume of chloroform, add 2 μL glycogen, and stand for 30 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge at 1,600× g for 10 min at 4 °C, precipitate DNAs with 0.",
    "6× volumes of isopropanol for 30 min at 4 °C, and wash with 70% (v/v) ethanol.Preliminary detection of CRIST samples Note: In order to identify ncRNAs binding to the Sox2 gene promoter, we selected two sites from the Sox2 gene promoter to design gRNAs. Therefore, the ds-cDNAs obtained by the above method must contain the binding site of gRNAs on the Sox2 gene promoter, so that the ncRNA combined with it can be precipitated together, and the sample quality can be preliminarily determined as qualified and used for subsequent experiments. Resuspend purified samples in 30 μL of ultrapure water and use pSox2 primers (Table 1) to detect the promotor binding site in anti-Flag and anti-IgG samples by PCR (1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 28 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min), and use input DNA as positive control (Figure 1B). Cas9 enrichment signals were quantitated by real-time PCR using specific primers derived from the pSox2 targeting site, 5′-Ct control site, and off-target site (Figure 1C). After confirming the specificity of the Cas9 gRNA, the Cas9 Sox2-gRNA iPSCs were then used for CRIST-seq assay.Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA For long-term stability, the single-strand cDNAs should be converted into double-stranded cDNAs.Synthesize ds-cDNAs at 16 °C for 2.5 h with 20 μL of purified samples, 2 μL of synthesis enzyme mix, 4 μL of 10× reaction buffer, and 14 μL of RNase-free water. Use NEBNext mRNA Second Strand Synthesis Module.Purify DNAs again use phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) as previously described.",
    "Construction of CRIST-seq library To facilitate sequencing, use DpnI to cut cDNAs into fragments of approximately 300 bps: add 1 μL of Fastdigest DpnI and 3 μL of 10× FastDigest Buffer to 26 μL of purified cDNAs and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.Purify DNAs with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and resuspend in 22 μL of ultrapure water.Follow the protocol of NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina to prepare samples for next-generation sequencing.Note: Follow the protocol step by step from 1.1-1.8A. Use Index primers in NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Index Primers Set 1 & Set 2 to amplify samples and get the cDNA libraries (1 cycle at 98 °C for 30 min, 15 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s and 65 °C for 75 s, and 1 cycle at 65 °C for 5 min, then hold at 4 °C).Sequence the cDNA library and use index primers as sequencing tags.CRIST-seq data analyses (Figure 2) Filter raw data and the low-quality data using FASTX software (v0.0.13) (Du et al., 2018).Use TopHat software (version 2.0.9) to map clean reads to the mouse mm10 genome (Trapnell et al., 2009).Quantitate the mapped reads as “fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped” (FPKM) using Cufflinks (version 2.1.1) (Trapnell et al., 2010).Call and annotate the peak using RIPSeeker software (Li et al., 2013) and adjust over the peaks overlapping with the IgG control enriched regions.Normalize the CRIST-seq signal intensities over the nontargeting Cas9 gCT control using the DiffBind package (Ross-Innes, Stark et al. 2012) [fold change difference ≥ 2 and p-value < 0.05, with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1].imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4718/bioprotoc-13-14-4718-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Preliminary screening for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are highly expressed in iPSC and much less expressed in FIB, which are related to pluripotency maintenance. Data regarding the RNAs that were changed greater than two-fold were combined with the CRIST-seq data using a VENN program. A cut-off threshold of peak enrichment FPKM > 50 was arbitrarily set to select CRIST-seq RNAs for VENN analysis. (B) Cross matching sequencing results with RNA-seq. (C) CRIST-seq identifies the top 42 Sox2 promoter-interacting RNAs. The Sox2 interacting RNAs are listed in order of the enrichment fold of the top 42 CRIST-seq data."
