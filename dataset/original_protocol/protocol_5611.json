    "Cell preparationStreak cells from a frozen stock, using a sterile pipette tip on a freshly-prepared YPD agar plate (see Recipes), and incubate at 30 °C for at least 24 h.Set an overnight culture in a 14 ml tube by inoculating 3 ml of YPD with cells grown on a YPD plate. Single colonies are not needed for genomically integrated strains. Incubate at 30 °C, 180 rpm.In the morning exchange the YPD medium (see Recipes) to YNB medium (see Recipes) supplemented with 4% glucose:Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 3 min, remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 3 ml of YNB medium without any carbon source.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 3 min, remove the supernatant.Suspend the cells in 3 ml of YNB supplemented with 4% glucose and incubate at 30 °C, 180 rpm, for ~4 h.Wash the culture by centrifugation (1,000 x g, 3 min) and re-suspend in 2 ml of YNB with 4% glucose. Incubate at 30 °C, 180 rpm, for about 10 min.Add 2 μl of 100 mg/ml cycloheximide solution (see Recipes) to the final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature, without shaking, protect from light.Place 5 μl of the culture on a microscope slide and cover with a 22 x 22 mm coverslip. Avoid any air under the coverslip.Data acquisitionPlace the sample under the microscope, coverslip on the objective and find a region of interest containing 5-10 cells (100x magnification) which appear stationary and firmly anchored to the glass surface.Optimize exposure times for in vivo imaging of both GFP and mCherry fluorescent proteins to be able to detect a clear signal without saturating the detector. Under our microscope: GFP exposure time–22 sec, mCherry–7 sec.",
    "Find another region with 5-10 cells positioned far away from the previous one to avoid any potential bleaching from previous illumination exposure.Take a brightfield and a fluorescence image, by pressing the ‘snap’ button, with both channels using chosen exposure times, opening the mercury lamp shutter for only the length of exposure.Photobleach GFP or mCherry by continuous illumination of the appropriate wavelength until the region appears completely dark. Continue for 1 min longer. With our settings the total exposure time is: 3 min 40 sec for GFP and 4 min for mCherry. Immediately after, begin timing and acquire a picture of the bleached fluorescent protein with an appropriate channel and a brightfield image. This is denoted time point 0 min.Continue acquiring both fluorescent and brightfield pictures at the following time points after bleaching: 7.5, 15, 25, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 min.As simultaneous photobleaching of GFP and mCherry is not possible under this microscope, the time points were staggered for GFP and mCherry as listed in Table 1.Table 1. Order of photobleaching and data acquisition using two channelsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117232452_7940.jpgData analysisImages are converted into open standard tiff files from zvi by AxioVision software.Further analysis is performed using ImageJ.Open the first unbleached brightfield image. By choosing an ‘oval’ selection tool, define a region of interest (ROI), an area around a cell as shown in Figure 1. It does not matter how much of non-cell area is included as every cell will be background-correct during the analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233204_9640.jpgFigure 1. Selection of the region of interest for cell measurements. Scale bar = 20 µm.Open a fluorescence image of the same set, and define the same area of the same cell by simultaneously choosing ‘Shift’ and ‘E’ keys on the keyboard (Selection → Restore).From the menu bar select: Analyze → set measurements.",
    "Pick ‘area’ (represents a number of pixels, N) and ‘integrated density’ (sum intensity for the cell, Scell). Press ‘OK’.To obtain numeric values press ‘Ctrl’ + ‘M’ (Analyse → Measure). Record the result in Excel.Repeat throughout the entire data set for both channels keeping the same ROI.Repeat the entire procedure for all cells.Background correction: Choose random background areas around cells (Figure 2) and obtain numerical results for sum intensity (Sbg). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233133_5557.jpgFigure 2. Selection of the region of interest for the background measurements. Scale bar = 20 µm.Find the average (SAbg) and multiply by the number of pixels from cell (N) measurements. This is the intensity of the background represented within the cell area (Ibg).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233251_0852.jpgSubtraction of the average background sum intensity (Ibg) from the total intensity of the cell (Scell) represents Icell, the cellular fluorescence intensity with background correction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233350_6856.jpgThe average of fluorescence intensity of all cells analysed within the data set gives the final value of the fluorescence intensity (Ifinal) with appropriate estimation of SD and/or SE.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233436_3087.jpgPlot the final fluorescence intensity (Ifinal) vs. experimental time (Figures 3A and 3B) for fluorescently labelled cells and wild type autofluorescent cells. Any signal above autofluorescence is due to fluorescent protein maturation. For GFP (Figure 3A), no maturation was detected so it can be assumed that all of the fluorescent protein was mature in the cells and there is no ‘dark’ fraction. For mCherry (Figure 3B), some fluorescence recovery was measured. The following steps outline quantification of the maturation time and dark fraction.Subtract the autofluorescence from the mean fluorescent protein intensity at each time point (Figure 3C).Export the intensity and time values after the bleach by copying and pasting into two new variables in MATLAB, called x (for the time values ) and y (intensity values):Right click on the Workspace → New.",
    "Name it x or y. Press ‘Enter’ on the keyboard.Double click on this new variable opens a table in the Editor where values of time (for x) or intensity (for y) can be pasted.Open the curve fitting toolbox from the Apps menu.Select x for ‘X data’ and y for ‘Y data’.Choose custom equation and type:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233544_0978.jpgwhere, Ibleach is the remaining intensity after the bleach, Irec is the recovered intensity above Ibleach and tmat is the maturation time.If ‘Auto fit’ is ticked, fitting will be automatic. If the fit has not converged correctly, adjust the ‘Start point’ parameters in ‘Fit Options’ to reasonable estimates from the data i.e., y at x = 0 for Ibleach and y at x = end minus Ibleach for Irec.If the fit has converged record the fit and goodness of fit parameters from the ‘Results’ panel. For Figure 3C, Irec = 4.3 x 104 ± 3 x 104 counts, Ibleach = 5.2 x 104 ± 2.5 x 104 counts, tmat =17 ± 10 min with R2 = 0.7.To calculate the proportion dark, immature protein; divide Irec by the initial, autofluorescence corrected pre-bleach intensity. Here give ~5%.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117233904_6788.jpgFigure 3. Characterisation of GFP and mCherry maturation times in vivo.
