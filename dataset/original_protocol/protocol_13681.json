    "This study was approved by the Bavarian Animal Care and Use Committee (approved by ethical code: ROB-55.2Vet-2532.Vet_02-17-99); these experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the German animal legislation guidelines.\n1. Animals and femoral artery ligation (FAL)\nNOTE: To induce sterile inflammation and arteriogenesis, 8-10 weeks old male C57BL/6J mice were used. None of the mice died or suffered from wound infection or wound healing disturbance during or post-FAL or sham surgery, respectively.\nAnesthesia\n\tNOTE: Before injection of the MMF-mix anesthesia, it is recommended to first anesthetize with 5% isoflurane until the mouse is sleeping.\n\t\nWeigh the mouse and prepare MMF mix with a dose of midazolam 5.0 mg/kg, medetomidine 0.5 mg/kg, and fentanyl 0.05 mg/kg.\nFill a 1 mL syringe with MMF-mix and inject a final volume of 100 µL s.c. using a 30 G needle (after anesthesia with 5% isoflurane).\nPlace the mouse on a warm pad and wait until the mouse is completely anesthetized. Set the timer to 35 min. After this time, inject s.c. half of the dose (50 µL) of the MMF-mix.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by testing the pedal and interdigital reflexes (by firm toe pinch) of the mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: An absence of response indicates an adequate depth of analgesia.\nFemoral artery ligation (FAL)\n\tNOTE: Use sterile surgical instruments and sutures. Disinfect the skin with disinfectant before opening and after closing.\n\t\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on a heating plate (35-37 °C) to maintain physiological body temperature. Apply eye cream (dexpanthenol) to each eye to prevent drying of the eyes under anesthesia.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse to a Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) chamber before and after FAL to check blood flow and perfusion (Figure 1A-C).",
    "Remove hair, disinfect the skin, and make a cut to access the femoral artery. Under a surgical microscope, ligate the right femoral artery of the mouse hind limb using a braided silk suture (7-0) and perform a sham operation on the left femoral artery to serve as an internal control as previously described6 (Figure 1D-K).\n\t\tNOTE: The incision in the skin was made with small scissors to avoid direct injury to the blood vessels close to the skin.\nClose the skin using a braided silk suture (6-0). Administer buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) s.c. every 12 h, starting 10 min before antagonizing the anesthesia for pain relief. Observe the animal for signals of pain, i.e., reduced grooming activity, reluctance to move, or hunched posture for 24 h post-surgery.\nInject (s.c.) a combination of naloxone (1.2 mg/kg), flumazenile (0.5 mg/kg), and atipamezole (2.5 mg/kg) to antagonize the anesthesia after finishing the FAL and closing the skin.\nAfter surgery, keep the mouse on the warm pad and continuously monitor the animal until it can maintain an upright posture and start walking normally around the cage.\nWhen the mouse is fully awake, place it back in the cage together with the other mice and return the cage to the animal housing room.\n2. Tissue preparation for multiphoton intravital imaging\nTail vein injection\n\tNOTE: The animal needs to be under anesthesia before starting the preparation for intravital imaging. Before introducing the needle of the vein catheter, it is recommended to apply a skin disinfectant on the tail. This will also help to visualize the vessels.",
    "Prepare a tail vein injection catheter using a 2 x 30 G needle, 10 cm of a fine bore polythene tubing (0.28 mm internal diameter and 0.61 mm outer diameter), a 1 mL syringe, and a histoacryl glue to fix the catheter on the mouse tail for further i.v. injections during imaging (Figure 2A,B and Figure 2F).\nPrepare the antibody solution for i.v. injection: CD45-PE and CD41-FITC (20 µg/mouse) at a final volume of 100 µL.\nCheck the tail for the laterally located tail veins and dam the vein to identify the tail vein. Disinfect the tail, insert the vein catheter, and fix it using tissue histoacryl glue (Figure 2B).\nInject the antibodies prior to imaging (at least 15 min before) and after finishing the tissue preparation.\nTissue preparation\n\tNOTE: Always use a warm pad and administer a drop of eye cream (dexpanthenol) in each eye before tissue preparation. Use sterile surgical instruments and sutures. Disinfect the skin with disinfectant before open and after closing.\n\t\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on a stable and portable pad. Fix the mouse in a supine position with a 4 point fixation on the pad using adhesive tape (Figure 2B).\nMold two pieces of modeling clay and place the pieces under the upper hind limb of the mouse to ensure a plane position of the adductor muscle (Figure 2B, indicated by red arrows).\nTo ensure a stable body temperature of 37 °C of the mouse, place the pad with the mouse on a heating plate under a surgical microscope with a 0.64-4.0-fold zoom (Figure 1L).\nRemove the hair from both legs, disinfect the skin, and cut the skin in a circle around the scar of the earlier femoral artery ligation of the right hind limb (Figure 1M).",
    "Remove the skin and fat layer from the top of the leg (Figure 1N,O), and pull aside the remaining skin using sutures to create a pocket around the adductor muscle (Figure 1P,Q).\nRemove subcutaneous fat to get a clear vision of the adductor muscle and the profound artery/vein as well as the collateral vessels (Figure 1Q,R).\nCarefully start removing the superficial muscle layer on top of the collateral vessels by carefully dissecting it out with fine forceps (Figure 1R).\n\t\tNOTE: The collateral artery and the collateral vein are clearly visible and ready for imaging (Figure 1S).\nFill the prepared pocket with saline to avoid drying of the tissue and continue with the same procedure for the sham-operated left hind limb. Before imaging, add ultrasonic gel in both pockets, which prevents drying and serves as an immersion medium for optical coupling with the objective (Figure 2C and Figure 2F).\n3. Intravital multiphoton microscopy\nPreparation\n\tNOTE: Keep a syringe with ultrasonic gel inside the incubator chamber of the microscope to maintain a warm temperature for refilling the pockets during long-term imaging.\n\t\nRemove the saline from the two prepared pockets and replace it with ultrasonic gel to cover the collateral vessels (Figure 2C).\nInject the antibody solution through the tail vein catheter. 15 min after antibody injection, transfer the pad with the fixed mouse into the warmed multiphoton imaging chamber (Figure 2F).\nAfter completion of the image acquisition, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation under deep narcosis.\nMultiphoton microscopy image acquisition\n\tNOTE: Turn on the microscope 30 min before imaging to allow for laser stabilization. For the best optical stability of the microscope, it is recommended to keep the microscope chamber permanently heated.",
    "Turn on the key of the Ti:Sapphire laser box, the electronic interfaces boxes, the heating unit of the incubation chamber, the fluorescent lamp, and the computer (Figure 2D,E).\nLaunch the acquisition software (Inspector software). Set the wavelength to 800 nm and open the microscope shutter (Figure 3A ii).\nIn the Measurement Wizard dialog, choose the Instrument Mode (Single beam) and in Measurement Mode (3D-scan Time lapse) (Figure 3A i).\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse into the pre-warmed incubation chamber of the microscope. Position the area with the ultrasonic gel (step 2.2.8) directly in contact with the objective front lens (Figure 2F).\nOpen the epifluorescence microscope shutter, choose an adequate filter/dichroic setting for FITC visualization (4) to find the area of interest by following the blood flow under epifluorescence illumination. After bringing the area of interest into the center field of view, close the epifluorescence microscope shutter.\nIn the xy-Scanner dialog, set the following parameters: Image size (554x554), Pixel (512x512), Frequency (400), Line average (1) (Figure 3A iii). Adjust the laser power (5%) (Figure 3A iv), and set the photomultiplier (PMT) gain for the channels green (66), red (66), and blue (63) (Figure 3A v).\nSelect anadequate objective for intravital imaging and drift correction settings (see details in 3.2.11).\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the selected objective was the Nikon LWD 16x (Figure 3A vi).\nDefine the image stack range by starting the preview acquisition mode by pressing the red button on the top right corner of the Measurement Wizard dialog window (Figure 3A i).",
    "Define the area and structure of interest by focusing to obtain a good image. Then, while observing the screen, change focus by moving the objective up until the image disappears, and set it as zero (first= 0). Change focus in the opposite direction by moving the objective down until the image disappears from the screen again, and set it as the last (end= 40 µm) position in the axial direction (Figure 3A vii).\nSet the step size to 2 µm. Click the red button on the top right corner of the Measurement Wizard dialog to stop the preview scanning.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of images will be calculated and set automatically (21 images), as indicated in Figure 3A vii.\nIf the microscope is equipped with live-drift correction9, start the drift correction software (e.g., VivoFollow) and follow the steps described below.\n\t\t\nIn the Measurement Wizard dialog, choose the Python axis (Python Ax) (Figure 3A viii) as the first axis device; DO NOT activate the auto save mode. Check the auto save (AS) box only on the time axis (Time Time). Press the Python icon on the Available Devices window (Figure 3A ix) to open the Python dialog window.\nIn the Python dialog Axis settings, enter in From (0 zero) and To (-40). Enter Number of steps (21) as indicated in Figure 3A x.\nGo to the xyz Stage Z dialog window and enlarge the Scan Range by 200 µm on both ends: in Start, enter (200 µm) and in End, enter (-240 µm), the range will automatically be set (-440 µm). Keep the step size (2 µm) as shown in Figure 3A xi.\nOpen the VivoFollow Frontend dialog and click the Motion Profile box (Figure 3A xii).",
    "Start image acquisition by pressing the green arrowhead in the top left corner of the Measurement Wizard dialog of the Inspector Software (Figure 3A i).\nIf live-drift correction is used, look for a dialog for the drift correction configuration to appear as shown in Figure 3A xiii. Set the acquisition channel that will be used as an immobile landmark reference (for this protocol, choose channel 2, where the vascular tracer signal is to be recorded). Enter the maximal correction offset in µm that was added to the first and last z positions (here, 200 µm) and click OK.\nMonitor the current drift offset in x, y, and z in real time during the image acquisition in the VivoFollow fronted dialog window Figure 3A xiv.\nStop imaging acquisition after ~35 min when another cycle of anesthesia re-injection is required. Inject half a dose of the MMF-mix (50 µl s.c) and re-start imaging acquisition by pressing the green arrowhead again (step 3.2.11.5).\nRepeat this procedure until the experiment is finished.\nSubscription Required.
