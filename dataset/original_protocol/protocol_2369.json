This step should be performed inside a biosafety cabinet.\nTransfer the LNs to 2 mL of enzyme dissociation mix (refer to materials and equipment for detailed recipe).\nRemove the fat tissue.\nCut the whole LN with surgical scissors into pieces.\nTransfer into a gentleMACS C tube.\nPlace the tubes in the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator, proceed two times with the spleen program: [59 s, rpm: 1260].\nAdd 13 mL of enzyme dissociation mix. Place the tubes in the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator, proceed to the 37C_m_LDK_1 program: [31 min:13 s, temp: ON, rpm: 2844].\nNote: Alternatively, the cell suspension can be obtained by mincing the tissue with surgical scissors prior enzymatic dissociation. However, this approach is significantly less efficient and more harmful for the cells compared to the use of an automated tissue dissociator.\nNote: The Dulbecco's PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA in the subsequent steps contains no calcium, no magnesium.\nPass the suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer, placed in a 50 mL conical bottom tube, with light pressure using the rubber end of a syringe plunger.\nNote: Leave to stand for 30 s and remove the small clumps which settle to the bottom of the tube.\nRinse cell strainer with some Dulbecco’s PBS. Fill the tube up to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension 10 min at 350 g, 4°C. Resuspend the pellet in 1–2 mL cold (4°C) Dulbecco’s PBS. Then, once the cells are resuspended homogeneously, make up to 20 mL per pellet with cold (4°C) Dulbecco’s PBS.\nPass through a 70 μm cell strainer, placed in another 50 mL conical bottom tube.",

This step should be performed inside a biosafety cabinet.\nNote: One specimen per lung region (cranial, middle, and caudal) were pooled and processed (typically, one piece of lung tissue weighs 4–6 g).\nRinse tissue in a Petri dish containing cold Dulbecco’s PBS to remove erythrocytes.\nReplace the Dulbecco’s PBS with 2 mL of enzyme mix (refer to materials and equipment for detailed recipe). Cut the lung tissue with scissors into pieces and transfer into a gentleMACS tube.\nPlace the tubes in the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator, proceed two times with the Spleen program: [59 s, rpm: 1260].\nAdd 8 mL of enzyme mix. Place the tubes in the gentleMACsTM Octo Dissociator, proceed with the 37C_m_LDK_1 program: [31 min:13 s, temp: ON, rpm: 2844].\nNote: The Dulbecco's PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA in the subsequent steps contains no calcium, no magnesium.\nPass through a sieve and collect into a beaker.\nPass the preparation through a 100 μm cell strainer, placed in a 50 mL conical bottom tube, with light pressure using the rubber end of a syringe plunger.\nNote: Leave to stand for 30 s and remove the small clumps which settle to the bottom.",
    "Rinse cell strainer with some Dulbecco’s PBS. Fill the tube up to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension 10 min at 350 g, 4°C. Resuspend the pellet in 1–2 mL cold (4°C) Dulbecco’s PBS and make up to 20 mL per pellet with cold (4°C) Dulbecco’s PBS.\nPass through a 70 μm cell strainer, placed in another 50 mL conical bottom tube.

    "This step describes how to prepare a single-cell suspension from immune cells isolated from the bronchoalveolar space through bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) of sheep lung as illustrated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. This step is performed just after euthanasia of the animal. The staff present is equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment, including a Tyvek coverall and hood (both 3 M), and a Jupiter air respirator equipped with an HEPA filter system (3 M). Once the BALs are isolated, this step should be performed inside a biosafety cabinet.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2003-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Bronchoalveolar lavage procedures\n(A) Material required for the isolation of BAL: metal stand (1), funnel holder (2), Dulbecco’s PBS solution (no calcium, no magnesium) containing EDTA and antibiotics (3), plastic tray (4), funnel (5), surgical clamp (6), Sterile glass bottle (7) and one sterile beaker (8). The volume of Dulbecco’s PBS solution is for the respective number of lungs processed at this specific necropsy day.\n(B) The trachea is clamped with a surgical clamp and the lungs are hanged using the funnel holder.\n(C) Dulbecco’s PBS at room temperature is poured through the trachea using a sterile funnel. Once the lungs are full of PBS, gently massage the lungs for 20–30 s and pour the BAL inside a sterile beaker. Transfer the BAL from the beaker into the sterile glass bottle for safe transportation to the laboratory equipped with biological safety cabinet.",
    "Critical: The lungs are isolated with the trachea, which is clamped before cutting, to prevent blood from entering the lungs. Then, Dulbecco's PBS solution (no calcium, no magnesium) containing EDTA and antibiotics is poured through the trachea using a sterile funnel. Depending on the BAL volume, single-cell suspensions are distributed in the appropriate number of 50 mL conical bottom tubes (total volumes collected typically: 150–200 mL for neonatal lambs; 2–3 L for ewes).\nPour the required volume of Dulbecco’s PBS in the lungs through a sterile funnel. Gently massage the lungs for 20–30 s. Pour the lungs content inside a sterile beaker Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nCritical: Use Dulbecco's PBS at room temperature rather than cold Dulbecco's PBS to avoid any undesired lung tissue constriction. The Dulbecco's PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA in the subsequent steps contains no calcium, no magnesium.\nNote: At this step, to avoid damage to the lung tissue, invert the clamped lung a few times rather than rigorous kneading (repeat lavage with 100 mL as many times as required).\nDistribute the cells in suspension in 50 mL conical bottom tubes. Centrifuge 10 min at 350 g, at 4°C. Resuspend the pellet in 1–2 mL cold (4°C) Dulbecco’s PBS.\nCombine 4 tubes into a new 50 mL conical tube (to get rid of any fat, contaminant, or mucus). Centrifuge 10 min at 350 g, at 4°C.\nNote: For adult animals, larger volumes of Dulbecco's PBS are required. Repeat step 3 as many times as needed.\nResuspend the cell pellets, pass through a 100 μm cell strainer and centrifuge at 350 g for 10 min, 4°C.\nResuspend The pellets are, pass through a 70 μm cell strainer and centrifuge at 350 g for 10 min, 4°C.",
    "Note: If needed, erythrocytes can be lysed by resuspending the pellet with 1–2 mL of H2O (up and down during a few seconds). Then wash immediately with 48 mL of cold (4°C) Dulbecco's PBS and centrifuge 10 min at 350 g, 4°C. Alternatively, an ammonium chloride lysis of erythrocytes can be performed.\nResuspend the pellet in 15 mL cold (4°C) DMEM containing 10% FBS.\nCount using a Neubauer chamber or an automated cell counter.\nFlow cytometry acquisition\nTiming: 6–7 h for staining\nTiming: 4–5 h for acquisition\nThis step describes how the different T cell subsets were identified by FCM using an eight-step, seven-color assay (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). This procedure should be performed inside a biosafety cabinet until step “Fixation and Permeabilization”. The experimental timeline of a typical necropsy day is summarized in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2003_10.csv\naThis sample compensation matrix applies to all series of tubes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2003-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Flow chart depicting the experimental timeline from euthanasia to sample acquisition by FCM\nLN = lymph nodes; BAL = Bronchoalveolar lavage. Illustration created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: As this protocol implies the handling of a large number of samples, we recommend having enough people in the team. The necropsy and organ collection requires at least 5–6 people. Also, a minimum of 4 people are required for organ dissociation, preparation of cell suspensions and cell counting. Finally, the multiparameter FCM procedure can be performed by a single researcher. Notably, upon storage of the stained cells at 4°C, the FCM acquisition can be performed the following day.\nCritical: We strongly recommend performing the assay on freshly isolated cells. Indeed, cryopreservation induces significant cell death, renders the cells quiescent rather than cytokine producing cells, as well as modulates the expression levels of cell surface canonical markers.",
    "Once all the samples have been processed to single cell suspension and are stored on ice:\nCount the cells and resuspend all samples in DMEM, 10% FBS supplemented with Brefeldin A (10 μg/mL), at a density of 2 × 106 cells/mL.\nIncubate 5 mL of cell suspension (10 × 106 cells) per well in 6-well plates for 5 h.\nThen, transfer 1 mL (2 × 106 cells) per staining condition into microtiter tubes.\nCentrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nIncubate the cell pellets with 100 μL LIVE/Dead Aqua, 20 min on ice (step “Live/Dead Aqua”, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL cold Dulbecco’s PBS without calcium and magnesium, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nIncubate the cell pellets with 50 μL unconjugated primary antibodies, 15 min on ice (step “Surface 1″, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL Cell Wash, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nIncubate the cell pellets with 50 μL conjugated secondary antibodies, 15 min on ice (step “Surface 2″, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL Cell Wash, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nPerform an Ig blocking using 25 μL ChromPure mouse IgG, 5 min on ice (step “IgG block\").\nProceed directly by adding 25 μL conjugated antibodies, let the cells incubate 15 min on ice (step “Surface 3″, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL Cell Wash, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nIncubate the cell pellets with 100 μL Fixation/Permeabilization solution, 25 min on ice (step “Fix & Perm”, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL cold BD Perm/Wash™ Buffer, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nNote: The following steps can be performed outside of a biosafety cabinet.",
    "Incubate the cell pellets with 50 μL unconjugated primary antibodies, 15 min on ice (step “Intracellular 1″, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL cold BD Perm/Wash™ Buffer, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nIncubate the cell pellets with 50 μL conjugated secondary antibodies, 15 min on ice (step “Intracellular 2″, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Wash with 800 μL cold BD Perm/Wash™ Buffer, centrifuge 7–8 min at 350 g, 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 70 μL cold BD Perm/Wash Buffer. At this step, you can either proceed to the sample acquisition or either store the tube holder overnight at 4°C.\nNote: When the intracellular staining involves directly labeled antibodies (such as IL-4-IgG2a-FITC and IFN-γ-IgG1-AF647 for “Th2/Tc2″ identification), then skip step 10 to proceed directly to sample resuspension.\nNote: After cell resuspension, the content of 1.2 mL Microtiter tubes must be transferred into 5 mL FCM tube before acquisition on a FACS Canto II (BD Bioscience) or any other 6 colours flow cytometer using the BD FACSDIVA software (or any other proprietary software) and further analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar).\nNote: BD FACSDiva software, used to acquire the samples, can export data files in FCS 3.0 default formats. FCS 3.0 files can be analyzed by other software applications, including FlowJo™."
