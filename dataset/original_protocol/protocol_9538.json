    "1. Expression and Purification of Periplasmic HdeB\nNOTE: HdeB was expressed in E. coli cells harboring the plasmid pTrc-hdeB10, and purified from the periplasm upon polymyxin lysis.\nPrepare an overnight culture of E. coli cells harboring the plasmid pTrc-hdeB 10 in 30 ml LB containing 200 µg/ml ampicillin (LBAmp). Inoculate four 1 L cultures of LBAmp and grow them at 37 °C and 200 rpm until O.D.600nm of 0.7 is reached. Then, add 300 µM IPTG to induce the expression of HdeB and decrease the growth temperature to 30 °C.\nAfter 5 hr of protein expression at 30 °C, harvest the cells by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cell pellet with 100 ml buffer A (50 mM Tris/HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuge the cells again at 8,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nSubsequently, resuspend the cell pellet in 80 ml buffer A, containing 1 mg/ml polymyxin sulfate. For efficient disruption of the outer membrane, gently stir the suspension for 1 hr at 4 °C.\nTo remove the cytoplasmic fraction and cell debris, centrifuge the suspension for 20 min at 15,000 x g at 4 °C. This results in ~60 ml supernatant containing the soluble HdeB.\nDialyze the supernatant containing the periplasmic extract overnight against 150x volume of buffer B (20 mM Tris/HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) using a dialysis membrane with 6 kDa MW cut-off. Concentrate the proteins to 15 ml using centrifugal filter units with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa. Filter the protein solution using a 0.2 µm pore filter.",
    "Apply the protein onto an anion exchange chromatography column (column volume 5 ml) that has been equilibrated with 5 column volumes buffer B with a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Once the protein is loaded onto the column, wash the column with buffer B for 10 min at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Elute HdeB with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in buffer B over a time period of 50 min with a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min 6.\nIdentify fractions containing HdeB using a 15% SDS-PAGE. Mix 20 µl sample with 5 µl 5x reduced SDS loading buffer. Load 10 µl onto the gel and run in Tris-glycine buffer (14.4 g/L glycine, 2.9 g/L Tris, 1 g/L sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 8.3). Run the gel at 150 V until the bromophenol band has migrated close to the bottom of the gel (~45 min).\nPool all HdeB-containing fractions, dialyze at 4 °C overnight against 4 L HdeB storage buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), and concentrate the protein to approximately 300 µM using centrifugal filter units with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa. Determine the concentration of HdeB at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient ε280nm= 15,595 M-1cm-1. Prepare 100 µl aliquots and flash-freeze the aliquots in liquid nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: HdeB can be stored at -70 °C for at least 6 months.\n2. Chaperone Activity Assay Using Thermally Unfolding Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH)\nNOTE: The influence of purified HdeB on the aggregation of thermally unfolding porcine mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) at different pH values was monitored as described below. All listed protein concentrations refer to the monomer concentration.",
    "To prepare MDH, dialyze MDH at 4 °C overnight against 4 L buffer C (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and concentrate the protein to approximately 100 µM using centrifugal filter units with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa.\n\tNOTE: Careful dialysis of MDH is required as MDH is delivered as ammonium sulfate solution.\nTo remove aggregates, centrifuge the protein for 20 min at 20,000 x g at 4 °C. Determine MDH concentration by absorbance at 280 nm (ε280 nm= 7,950 M-1 cm-1). Prepare 50 µl aliquots of MDH and flash-freeze the aliquots for storage.\nPlace 1 ml quartz cuvette into a fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with temperature controlled sample holders and stirrer. Set λex/em to 350 nm.\nAdd appropriate volumes of pre-warmed (43 °C) buffer D (150 mM potassium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl) at the desired pH values (here: pH 2.0, pH 3.0, pH 4.0, and pH 5.0) to the cuvette and set the temperature in the cuvette holder to 43 °C. The total volume is 1,000 µl.\nAdd 12.5 µM HdeB (or alternatively the same volume of HdeB storage buffer for the buffer control) to the buffer, followed by the addition of 0.5 µM MDH. Begin monitoring light scattering. Incubate the reaction for 360 sec to allow sufficient unfolding of MDH.\nRaise the pH to 7 by adding 0.16-0.34 volume of 2 M unbuffered K2HPO4 and continue recording light scattering for another 440 sec.\nSet the extent of MDH aggregation that is recorded in the absence of the chaperone at a defined time point after neutralization (here after 500 sec, when maximal light scattering of MDH was observed) to 100%. Normalize HdeB's activity to the light scattering signal of MDH in the absence of HdeB at each indicated pH value.",
    "3. Detection of HdeB-LDH Complex Formation by Analytical Ultracentrifugation (aUC)\nNOTE: Sedimentation velocity experiments of HdeB alone or in complex with thermally unfolding lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were performed using an analytical ultracentrifuge.\nTo prepare LDH, dialyze LDH at 4 °C overnight against 4 L buffer C (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and concentrate the protein to approximately 200 µM using centrifugal filter units with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa.\n\tNOTE: Careful dialysis of LDH is required as LDH is delivered as ammonium sulfate solution.\nTo remove aggregates, centrifuge LDH for 20 min at 20,000 x g at 4 °C. Determine LDH concentration by absorbance at 280 nm (ε280 nm= 43,680 M-1 cm-1). Prepare 50 µl aliquots of LDH and flash-freeze the aliquots for storage.\nIncubate 3 µM LDH in the presence and absence of 30 µM HdeB in buffer D (pH 4 and 7, respectively) for 15 min at 41 °C.\n\tNOTE: Incubation of LDH at higher temperatures results in its complete aggregation, and no chaperone effect of HdeB can be observed.\nLet the samples cool down to room temperature. Then, load samples into cells containing standard sector shaped 2-channel centerpieces with 1.2 cm path length. Load the cells into the ultracentrifuge and equilibrate to 22 °C for at least 1 hr prior to sedimentation.\nSpin samples at 22 °C and 167,000 x g in the respective rotor for 12 hr, and monitor the sedimentation of the protein continuously at 280 nm. As previously demonstrated, the signal to noise ratio is improved when the transmitted light intensity of each channel is measured rather than absorbance. This also improves the quality of subsequent data fitting.",
    "Conduct data analysis with SEDFIT (version 15.01b, December 2015), using the continuous c(s) distribution model 17. A tutorial describing how to use SEDFIT can be found in reference 18.\n\t\nSet the confidence level for the ME (Maximum Entropy) regularization to 0.7.\nCalculate buffer density as well as viscosity using SEDNTERP 19. To estimate the amount of aggregated client protein, compare the integrals of sedimented LDH in pH 4 to pH 7 as a reference.\n\tNOTE: Integration of the sedimentation distribution plots can be done directly in SEDFIT. Alternative software to analyze sedimentation velocity data can be found in a recent review 20.\n4. Monitoring MDH Inactivation and Reactivation in the Presence of HdeB\nNOTE: The influence of purified HdeB on the refolding of pH-unfolded MDH was determined by monitoring MDH activity upon neutralization.\nIncubate 1 µM MDH in buffer D at the desired pH values (here: pH 2.0, pH 3.0, pH 4.0, and pH 5.0) for 1 hr at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 25 µM HdeB. Then, shift the temperature to 20° C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: No MDH refolding was observed even in the presence of HdeB when MDH was incubated at temperatures higher than 37 °C.\nTo initiate refolding of acid denatured MDH, neutralize the samples to pH 7 by addition of 0.13-0.42 volume of 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0.\nAfter incubation for 2 hr at 20 °C, determine MDH activity by monitoring the decrease of NADH at 340 nm 9.\n\tNOTE: MDH catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of oxaloacetate into L-malate.\n\t\nMix 50 µl of the incubation reaction with 950 µl of assay buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM oxaloacetate, and 150 µM NADH).\n\t\tNOTE: The final concentration of MDH in the assay buffer should be 44 nM.",
    "Monitor the change in absorbance using a spectrophotometer, equipped with a Peltier temperature control block set to 20 °C.\nReport the MDH activity relative to 44 nM native MDH that has been kept at pH 7.0.\n5. Effect of HdeB Overexpression on E. coli Survival under Acid Stress\nNOTE: E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA was isolated using a published protocol 21.\nAmplify hdeB from E. coli MG1655 by PCR using primers hdeB-BamHI-rev GGT GGT CTG GGA TCC TTA ATT CGG CAA GTC ATT and hdeB-EcoRI-fw GGT GCC GAA TTC AGG AGG CGC ATG AAT ATT TCA TCT CTC C.\nSet up the PCR reaction in 50 µl as follows: 10 µl 5x polymerase buffer, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.5 µM primer JUD2, 0.5 µM primer JUD5, 150 ng genomic DNA MG1655, 0.5 µl DNA polymerase, add ddH2O to 50 µl.\nPerform amplification of hdeB as follows: Step 1: 5 min at 95 °C, 1 cycle; step 2: 30 sec at 95 °C, 30 sec at 55 °C, 30 sec at 72 °C, 40 cycles; Step 3: 10 min at 72 °C.\nClone resulting PCR fragment into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of plasmid pBAD18 using standard methods for restriction site cloning. Purify the plasmid using a plasmid purification kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Verify the resulting plasmid by sequencing 10.\nTransform the plasmid expressing HdeB or the empty vector control pBAD18 into strain BB7224 (ΔrpoH) (genotype: F-, λ-, e14-, [araD139]B/r Δ(argF-lac)169 flhD5301 Δ(fruK-yeiR)725(fruA25) relA1 rpsL150(SmR) rbsR22 Δ(fimB-fimE)632(::IS1) ptsF25 zhf::Tn10(TcS) suhX401 deoC1 araD+ rpoH::kan+;16) using chemically competent cells.\n\tNOTE: This strain is temperature-sensitive.",
    "After 45 sec heat-shock at 42 °C and prior to the plating, incubate cells at 30 °C and 200 rpm. Perform single colony streak-outs of the positive clones and incubate overnight at 30 °C. Prepare an overnight culture in 50 ml LBAmp and cultivate the cells at 200 rpm and 30 °C.\nDilute overnight cultures 40-fold into 25 ml LBAmp and grow the bacteria in the presence of 0.5% arabinose (Ara) at 30 °C and 200 rpm to an O.D.600nm = 1.0 to induce HdeB protein expression.\nFor the pH shift experiments, use LBAmp+Ara to dilute the cells to O.D.600nm of 0.5 and adjust to the respective pH values (here: pH 2.0, pH 3.0, and pH 4.0) by adding appropriate volumes of 5 M HCl.\nAfter the indicated time points (pH 2, 1 min; pH 3, 2.5 min; pH 4, 30 min), neutralize the cultures by addition of the appropriate volumes of 5 M NaOH.\nMonitor the growth of the neutralized cultures in liquid culture for 12 hr at 30 °C using O.D. measurements.\nSubscription Required.
