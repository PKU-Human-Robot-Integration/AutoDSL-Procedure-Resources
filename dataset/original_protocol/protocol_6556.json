    "A visual depiction of the protocol steps is pictured in Figure 1 followed by detailed written descriptions of each step. Briefly, steps [A] (preparation of plasmid DNA) and [B]-[D] (design, pooling, and phosphorylation of oligonucleotides) are performed ahead of time and can be done in parallel. Steps [E]-[L] are all performed on a single day. ssDNA is prepared from plasmid dsDNA [E] and the mutagenic strand is synthesized from the ssDNA template [F]. The heteroduplex is column purified [G] and the template strand is specifically degraded [H]. The mutagenic strand is regenerated [I], and the mutagenic DNA is enriched [J], column purified [K], and transformed into E. coli [L]. The next day plasmids containing user-defined mutations are prepped from E. coli transformants [M].imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200724/20200724224231_1194.pngFigure 1. Nicking Mutagenesis Procedure. Steps [A]-[D] shown in green boxes are prepared independently of the rest of the method. [A] Preparation of mutagenesis template plasmid with unique BbvCI restriction site; [B] Automated user-defined design of mutagenic primers; [C] (as needed) Pooling of mutagenic primers; [D] Phosphorylation of oligonucleotides; [E] ssDNA template prep; [F] Mutagenic strand synthesis; [G] Column purification; [H] Bottom template strand degradation; [I] Mutagenic strand regeneration; [J] Removal of input plasmid with DpnI; [K] Column purification; [L] Transformation; [M] Plasmid library preparation.Prepare mutagenesis template plasmidThe template plasmid must contain a BbvCI site (CCTCAGC). It is acceptable for the plasmid to contain multiple BbvCI sites only if all are in the same orientation. If not already present, the site can easily be added using any site-directed mutagenesis procedure (e.g., Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis). If using the nicking enzymes in the order presented here (Nt.BbvCI first, Nb.BbvCI second), the orientation of the nicking site will determine if the mutagenic primers should match the sense or antisense strand of the plasmid.",
    "BbvCI is needed because nickase versions that nick only the top or only the bottom strand are available. In principle other nickases could be used but the buffers may need to be reformulated to allow compatibility with the nucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes.    Nicked plasmid DNA will be degraded during nicking mutagenesis, so plasmid preparations should be freshly prepared, either immediately prior to use, or not more than one month in advance. The plasmid should not be subjected to more than one freeze-thaw cycle to maximize the fraction of covalently closed molecules. Plasmid prepared and frozen for up to one month in a non-defrosting -20 °C freezer can be used (see troubleshooting tips in Table 1).Design mutagenic oligonucleotidesDesign primers encoding the desired mutations. Primers can encode multiple mutations as long as sufficient homology to the template is included upstream and downstream of the first and last mutations respectively. We typically have these homologous regions be at least 24 bp. Using software makes it possible to design thousands of primers quickly and minimizes errors in design even for small numbers of primers. A primer design script written in Python is provided in the supplementary information (see Software above).  Small numbers of primers can be ordered individually in tubes or 96-well plates, but when making thousands of programmed mutations (e.g., a large number of proximal double mutants), oligo pools are significantly more economical. Because nicking mutagenesis uses femtomole amounts of primers (< 0.05 pmol per reaction), commercial oligo pools can be used directly without PCR amplification. Furthermore, non-homologous primers present in an oligo pool will not anneal to templates or interfere with the procedure, making it possible to synthesize mutagenic primer sets for multiple genes in a single pool.",
    "Pool mutagenic oligonucleotidesIf using primers from an oligo pool, resuspend the pool according to the manufacturer’s instructions and compute the fraction of the oligo pool containing relevant primers for this mutagenesis. If pooling individual primers, resuspend each primer and pool all primers so that the final concentration of all primers is 10 μM. For example, if pooling 100 mutagenic primers, the final concentration of each individual primer should be 100 nM, giving a final concentration of 10 μM total primer.Phosphorylate oligonucleotidesAssemble the following two reactions in PCR tubes.Primer pool phosphorylation:table:",

Plate serial dilutions (e.g., 10−4, 10−5, and 10−6 of the full transformation) on appropriate selective medium in order to determine efficiency.Plate the remainder of the transformation on a large square bioassay plate of appropriate selective medium.Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.Plasmid library preparationA successful transformation should yield a lawn of colonies on the large bioassay plate. A large scraper, as can be prepared by bending a heated glass Pasteur pipette, is useful for resuspending colonies for plasmid preparation.Apply 5-7 ml of liquid medium (such as LB) to the bioassay plate and scrape the colonies off of the agar surface using the scraper.Slightly incline the plate so that the cell suspension pools in one corner and transfer the suspension to a sterile 50 ml conical tube with either a 1 ml pipette or a 10 ml serological pipette. Typically, 1-2 ml of the first liquid media dispensed to the plate is absorbed by the agar.",
    "Continue to add medium, scrape colonies, and transfer the suspension until the agar is clear of all bacterial growth.Mix the cell suspension by aggressive vortexing and/or trituration with a serological pipette to completely disperse aggregated biomass. If the biomass is suspended in roughly 10 ml, the culture will be completely opaque and it will be significantly denser than a saturated E. coli liquid culture in LB.Finally, recover plasmid DNA from a small amount of the suspension using of the cell suspension using a miniprep kit (e.g., New England BioLabs Monarch® Plasmid Miniprep Kit  T1010S  ). For a lawn on a bioassay plate resuspended in 10 ml of LB, 300 μl is usually sufficient to obtain 15 μg of high-copy number plasmid DNA."
