    "The protocol outlined below follows the guidelines of the institution (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY).\n1. Initial Preparation\nPerform Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) under moderate sedation, monitored anesthesia care (MAC), or deep sedation and general anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Patient surveys show favorable satisfaction scores with moderate sedation19, but recent data shows higher diagnostic yield using general anesthesia20.\nOptionally, perform the procedure without an airway device under moderate sedation. Use a laryngeal mask airway (LMA; size 4) for procedures involving deep sedation or general anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Use LMA for lesions that are higher in the trachea. Because of the high tracheal location of substernal thyroid gland, endotracheal intubation should not be used in these cases\nDuring the procedure, use the lowest effective dose of 1% or 2% lidocaine (cumulative maximum dose of ≤7 mg/kg; maximum serum level ≤5 mg/L) for topical airway anesthesia through the bronchoscope’s working channel 21.\n2. Pre-procedure Surveillance Bronchoscopy\nIntroduce a conventional flexible bronchoscope into the airway through the oral cavity, or the LMA. Perform a sequential inspection of each sub-segment of both the left and right tracheobronchial tree for obvious endobronchial abnormalities and ensure adequate airway patency. Clean the airway of any secretion or mucus by suctioning. Remove bronchoscope from the airway when done.\n3. Localizing the Lesion of Interest\nIntroduce Convex Probe-Endobronchial Ultrasound (CP-EBUS) bronchoscope with a 35° forward oblique angle view. Observe the anterior airway wall and a small portion of the adjacent lumen while advancing the bronchoscope centrally in the airway. When passing through the vocal cords, ensure that only the anterior angle of the glottic opening is visible. When in trachea, visualize the entire lumen with 35° backward flexion as needed.",
    "Observe the display-screen while using the white-light bronchoscopy. Advance the bronchoscope to the estimated level of the lesion. Always, ensure that the lumen is not fully visible when advancing the bronchoscope. Full view of the lumen indicates that the tip of the CP-EBUS probe is in backward flexion, and poses the risk of traumatic scraping against the posterior airway wall.\nAfter reaching the desired site of interest, inflate the balloon using about 2 ml of normal saline. Flex the tip of the CP-EBUS forward to bring it in contact with the airway.\nTurn on the ultrasound view using the dedicated ultrasound processor. Use the two-screen display (or split-screen display) to see both the endoscopic view of the lumen, and the corresponding ultrasound image together on the screen.\nEnsure that the EBUS bronchoscope is in flexion position. Move the CP-EBUS both clockwise and counterclockwise in small angles at the same level to identify the substernal thyroid gland. Identify the lesion. Adjust the CP-EBUS probe by moving it up-and-down so that the largest diameter of the lesion is seen.\nUsing the Doppler mode, identify the adjacent vascular structures to determine lesion’s accurate station22, and avoid accidental puncture of the blood vessels.\nAt the level of the lesion, flex the tip of the EBUS bronchoscope forward so its ultrasound probe comes in contact with the airway to obtain an ultrasound view of the lesion. When needed, flex the tip backward for full endoscopic view. Repeat the manoeuver and identify a point of entry for the TBNA needle between two tracheal rings.\n4. Obtaining Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Biopsy",
    "With the CP-EBUS tip in neutral (non-flexed) position, introduce the dedicated the 22 or 21 G TBNA needles into the working channel of the EBUS bronchoscope. Fasten the needle assembly onto the working channel using the locking mechanism.\nLoosen the sheath adjuster knob and advance the sheath so that the tip can be barely visualized on the endoscopic image. Fasten the sheath adjuster knob now.\nFlex the CP-EBUS probe forward to bring it in contact with the airway wall. On the ultrasound image, reconfirm that the longest diameter of the lesion is aligned with the projected path of the needle. Ensure that the needle exits the working channel at an angle of 20°.\nLoosen the needle adjuster knob, and puncture through the airway wall into the lesion under real-time ultrasound guidance. With the EBUS needle inside the lesion, shake the internal stylet to clean out the needle tip.\nRemove the internal stylet and attach the 20 ml vacuum-generating syringe to apply negative pressure.\nMove the needle back-and-forth (“passes”) inside the lesion, with – 20 ml negative pressure applied by a special vacuum-generating syringe. A total of 3-7 passes is suggested based on the current literature10,11.\nAfter making sufficient number of passes, negative pressure knob is turned off, and needle is retrieved out of the working channel.\nPush out the histological core using the internal sheath. Obtain both histological core as well as cytological aspirate by this method. Alternatively, use an air-filled 6 or 12 ml syringe to expel the content of the needle onto the slide or in the specimen cup.\nDetermine the adequateness of the specimen using on-site cytology services.\n5. Post-procedure Surveillance Bronchoscopy",
    "Remove the CP-EBUS bronchoscope out after biopsy. Reintroduce a conventional bronchoscope and perform a surveillance bronchoscopy to confirm absence of significant bleeding at the TBNA site. After hemostasis is ensured, remove the bronchoscope out and conclude the procedure.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
