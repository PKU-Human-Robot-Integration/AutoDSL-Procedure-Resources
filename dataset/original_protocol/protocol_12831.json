    "The overall protocol requires 2 days, including the first day of sepsis induction and isolation of BAL fluid from the animal, and the second day for exosomes isolation from the mouse BALF. All procedures have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Atlanta VA medical center.\n1. Mouse Acute Septic Lung Injury Model\nUse 6 - 8 weeks- old male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (weight 20 - 22 g) for the animal model, and perform all procedures using aseptic techniques and instruments. Autoclave all surgical instruments, including forceps and scissors for 20 min at 121 °C.  \nRandomly distribute mice into experimental and control group. Restrain mice on a surgical board. Treat mice with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 15 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal route. According to the individual body weight, dilute appropriate LPS dosages to 0.1 mL PBS per mouse, then inject LPS solution using a 1 mL syringe with 27 G needle and inject an equivalent volume of PBS to control animals.   \nKeep mice in the animal BSL2 facility, which consists of clean cages at appropriate room temperature.\n24 h later, euthanize mice with CO2 inhalation.\nSelect the surgical area in the center of mouse neck. Make a small incision (approximately 5 mm), and gently separate muscles for the access to the trachea using blunt forceps until the trachea is exposed.\nWithdraw mouse BAL fluid with 10 mL sterile syringe with a 27 G needle. First, gently, insert the needle into the trachea and inject 1 mL of sterile PBS slowly into the trachea, then draw BALF into a 3 mL disposable syringe with a 27 G needle. Upon completion of the procedure, dispose of syringes and needles in biohazard sharps container.",
    "Treat surgical instruments with chlorine dioxide, as described previously by Chauret et al.27, and then sterilize all surgical instruments by autoclaving for 20 min at 121 °C.\n2.  Exosomes Isolation-serial Ultra-centrifugation and Characterization\nCollect mouse BAL fluid in 15 mL conical tubes. To harvest alveolar cells, centrifuge samples for 10 min at 1,000 g, at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to new 15 mL conical tubes, then centrifuge samples for 30 min at 4,000 x g at 4 °C to remove cell debris.\nCollect the supernatant in ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuge samples for 60 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C to remove larger cellular particles.\nTransfer the supernatant to new conical tubes, then filter the samples through 0.2 µm syringe-filter to remove remaining larger particles.\nCollect samples in ultracentrifuge tubes, and balance tubes. Centrifuge samples for 2 h at 140,000 x g at 4°C to pellet the exosomes.\n\tNote: The size of exosomes varies 20 - 200 nm. 0.2 µm filter is used for removing larger particles that are more than 200 nm in size.\nDiscard the supernatants gently. Dissolve the pellet with 100 µL PBS or lysis solution, and transfer exosomes samples to 1.5 mL tubes, and store at -80 °C until use.\n\tNote: Transmission electron microscope is recommended to verify isolated exosomes.\nFollow the standard TEM sample processing protocol28. Analyze exosomes samples using transmission electron microscopy, and take images, scale bar 200 nm.\n3. Preparation of miRNA and Performing miRNA- q-RT-PCR\nNote: miRNA-q-RT-PCR is recommended to analyze expression level of miRNAs.\nFollow standard miRNAs isolation protocol and make sure to use an equal amount of purified RNAs in single-strand reverse transcription24.",
    "Follow the standard real-time PCR protocol to detect exosomal microRNA level in BAL fluid. Use specific real-time PCR primers against miR-155, miR-146a, and U6 SnRNA. Run PCR reaction with the quantitative PCR apparatus and normalize the expression values to internal control U6 snRNA.\n\tNote: Each group consists of triplicate samples24.\n4. Exosomes Labeling and Purification\nSuspend exosomes pellet with 100 µL suspension solution in a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube, then add 0.4 µL of the exosomes dye into the other tube with 100 µL of the suspension solution.\nQuickly add exosomes in the solution to the dye solution and mix it thoroughly by pipetting. Keep samples for 5 min at room temperature, protect from light.\nPut one exosome spin column in a 1.5 mL elution tube. Transfer the solution mixture to the center of the exosome spin column.\nSpin the column for 2 min at 800 x g at room temperature.\nDiscard the column and store the eluted sample at -20 °C until use.\n5. Validation of Exosomes Up Taken by Recipient Cells\nSeed 1 x 104 MLE 12 /cell in an 8-well chamber slide, and culture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAdd 10 µL fluorescent-labeled exosomes to the cells. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nRemove culture media and wash cells with PBS, then fix cells with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 mins at room temperature.\nMount the slide in mount medium with DAPI.\nAnalyze samples through a fluorescence microscope and take images, 40X magnification.\n6. Verification of Interaction between Exosomes and Recipient Cells\nSeed 2 x 105 MLE12/well in a 12-well culture plate containing appropriate culture medium, and culture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAdd 20 µg exosomes from mouse BAL fluid to MLE12 cells and set up replicates per experimental group.",
    "24 h later, wash cells with PBS and add 600 µL lysis buffer into well. Gently shake the plate and collect lysis samples in 1.5 mL tube with the pipette.\nFollow the standard total RNA isolation protocol and cDNA reverse transcription protocol, complete the single-strand cDNA reverse transcription29.\nFollow the standard real-time PCR protocol to detect mRNA expression level in recipient cells29. Use specific real-time PCR primers against TNF-α, IL-6, and ZO-1. Run PCR reactions with the quantitative PCR apparatus and normalize the expression values to the internal control GAPDH.\n\tNote: Each group consists of triplicate samples.\nSubscription Required.
