    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFormation of PEGDA micro-enclosures\nTiming: 1–2 h\nA digital micromirror device (DMD) is used to photo-pattern the coverslip using a photo-labile hydrogel.\nNote: The ability to place photomasks in an imaging plane that is conjugate to that of the coverslip is of paramount importance to this protocol. This can be achieved by the physical placement of photomasks into the light path of the microscope (LeValley et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). However, the use of a digital mask affords much more flexibility, is more robust, and is experimentally less cumbersome. We use a digital micromirror device (DMD; Polygon 400, Mightex) coupled with calibrated digital masks produced in Canvas 11 (Canvas).\nNote: The size and feature resolution of digital masks is predominantly limited by the field of view and the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens, respectively. The diffusion of the photo-initiator will also negatively impact feature resolution. Anecdotally, this limited feature size to ∼ 5 um when we used a 20× objective with an NA of 0.75.\nNote: Prior to beginning this step of the protocol, it is suggested that the inverted microscope, syringe pump, and DMD be turned on, with all driving software correctly set up and calibrated.\nRemove device from ddH2O and dab any droplets of water off the device. Clean the coverslip surface gently with a laboratory napkin and 100% ethanol.\nUsing a syringe and a 22 G blunt needle, flush the channel with 30 channel volumes of the PEGDA solution and leave the device full. Dab away excess solution from the outlet. For this step, either inlet can be used.\nImmediately move the filled device onto the stage of an inverted microscope in a room with minimal ambient light.",
    "Select the desired exposure conditions based on the hydrogel-forming solution stoichiometry, as well as the digital mask for photo-patterning the coverslip surface. Begin patterning the coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/319-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Successive steps for the microfluidic encapsulation of cell-free extracts using hydrogels\n(A) Photo-patterning of the coverslip surface in the microfluidic chamber using the DMD. A transmitted-light image of a hydrogel micro-enclosure is shown at the bottom in red boxes.\n(B) Cell-free extract is pumped into the device using the inlet nearest the micro-enclosures. The flow through (large collection of extract on the left side of the device) is wiped away. Red ROI indicates the position of the filled micro-enclosure which is visualized below by a fluorescent image showing the cell-free extract (supplemented with a soluble fluorophore) contained within and surrounding the hydrogel micro-enclosure.\n(C) After filling the micro-enclosures, an oil crossflow from the opposite inlet is used to isolate the micro-enclosure. After encapsulation, the fluorescent signal surrounding the hydrogel micro-enclosure is lost (bottom-right image). Scale bar, 50 μm. (Geisterfer et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCritical: Feature resolution and quality of the PEGDA microstructures is determined in part by the position of the focal plane and by the numerical aperture of the objective. For best results, a high NA objective is recommended, with the focal plane set just above (1–2 μm) the coverslip surface before exposure (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). To help in structure formation, solutions can be supplemented with small inert beads that rest on the coverslip surface as a means of determining focal plane.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/319-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(B) Transmitted-light image showing a hydrogel structure formed while the focal plane was just above the coverslip. The bottom schematic shows the position of the focal plane (in red) relative to the glass coverslip (dark blue).\n(C) Hydrogel structure formed with the focal plane above the cover slip surface (microfluidic chamber bottom). This result is similar for focal planes used below the coverslip surface. Both images were collected at the same axial position for direct comparison. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nNote: Exposure conditions can vary slightly per device, but in general, exposures of 0.8–1.5 mW/cm2 with 405 nm light for 5–10 ms at 17 mM LAP and 0.29 M PEGDA will result in sufficient polymerization and subsequent gelation of the hydrogel solution (Debroy et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Devices are designed for one-time use only, however, PDMS chamber dimensions may allow for the formation of several hydrogel structures within one device.\nNote: Flexible PDMS devices are subject to deformation under pressure-driven flow, so it is advised that top-filling micro-enclosures (such as those featured in Geisterfer et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) be formed nearest to the inlet that will be used to perfuse extract into the chamber. This will ensure that the tops of these PEGDA micro-enclosures are left open for filling with cell-free extract.\nNote: To keep track of the position of micro-enclosures within device chambers, a fiduciary mark can be added to the PDMS side of the coverslip outside the chamber to indicate the location of the micro-enclosures.",
    "After patterning the coverslip with a desired micro-structure, use a syringe pump to flush out unpolymerized PEGDA solution. This is accomplished by carefully inserting microbore tubing into the outlet opposite the PEGDA microstructures. Once the tubing is securely positioned, a flow of ∼5–10 μL/min for a total of 50 channel volumes of CSF-XB buffer can be used to flush the channel of unpolymerized PEGDA solution.\nCritical: To prevent the introduction of bubbles into the device chamber, prime the microbore tubing (0.010-inch ID × 0.030-inch OD) with buffer prior to insertion into the PDMS inlet. This is most easily done by running buffer through the tubing at a high flow rate until a droplet forms at the end of the tubing. Inspect the length of tubing for any bubbles after priming.\nNote: Flow rates used for flushing the device channels following hydrogel structure formation can vary depending on the dimensions of the channel. It is best to establish a mild flow rate that is amenable to the channel dimensions that does not deform the hydrogel structures or wash away any necessary experimental materials such as Aurora-A kinase coated beads. For more information regarding Aurora-A kinase coated beads see (Tsai and Zheng, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nOnce the channel has been flushed with buffer, carefully remove the microbore tubing and store the device at 4°C submerged in CSF-XB buffer until use.\nCritical: Soaking the device in CSF-XB buffer after micro-enclosure formation saturates the PDMS and thus limits liquid permeation through channel walls upon filling the device with extract. In addition, the CSF-XB buffer limits the potential dilution of the extract from water stored in the hydrogel structure.\nPause Point: For best results, use devices within one week of PEG coating the coverslip (see “Acrylation and PEGylation of the microfluidic chamber[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]”).\nEncapsulation of cell-free extract",
    "Timing: 20–30 min\nThe device chamber, and the micro-enclosures inside are filled with cell-free extract. An oil crossflow is then used to isolate the extract in the inner-reservoirs of the micro-enclosures.\nNote: Prior to beginning the encapsulation process, it is important to have the cell-free extract prepared, supplemented with needed fluorophores, and induced into the correct phase of the cell cycle for the experimental question.\nIn a 4°C cold room, remove the PDMS device from the CSF-XB buffer, and place near the syringe pump. Dab any excess buffer from the top of the PDMS device.\nBegin flushing device with cell-free extract. Be sure to insert the microbore tubing in the inlet nearest the hydrogel microstructures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). For those experiments in (Geisterfer et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), 50 channel volumes of extract were pumped through the device at 7 μL/min.\nAfter flushing the channel with extract, dab away fluid from the opposite port, and carefully remove the microbore tubing carrying extract using forceps. Insert the microbore tubing from the syringe containing the encapsulation oil and surfactant into the inlet opposite of your hydrogel structures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: For encapsulation, it is suggested a fluorocarbon oil and PEG-based surfactant be used to minimize interactions at the oil-extract interface. Geisterfer et al. used Pico-Surf 1 (Novec 7500 supplemented with 2% surfactant) to improve the encapsulation efficiency.\nOnce the microbore tubing is securely inserted into the opposite port, begin flushing the channel with the encapsulation oil at a rate of ∼20–25 μL/min for short pulses (around 5 μL increments) separated by 5 s. Pulse the device with oil for a total of three times.",
    "Hydrogel structures should be isolated at this point (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C; bottom image). Using forceps, carefully remove the tubing and dab away any oil and extract from the top of the PDMS device. Inlets can be left open or sealed at this time using small sections of tubing with an overhand knot cinching one end. Salts or compounds dried on the bottom of the coverslip from the buffer soak can be removed with 100% ethanol.\nThe device is now ready to be imaged and can be moved from the 4°C cold room to a temperature controlled room for imaging."
