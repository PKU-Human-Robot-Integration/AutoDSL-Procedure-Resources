The main experimental steps of AAV injection, electrode and fiber optic cannula implantation\n(A) Fix the head of the mouse in the stereotaxic apparatus.\n(B) Determine the coordinate of the piriform cortex (AP: +0.5 mm, ML: -2.8 mm, DV: -5.4 mm) for the AAV injection site and drill a hole with a skull drill.\n(C) Determine the coordinate of the CA3 (AP: -2.9 mm, ML: -3.0 mm, DV: -3.2 mm) for the electrode site and drill a hole with a skull drill; then drill 4 more holes at the anterior bregma, posterior lambda, and the left and right sides of the skull suture separately with a skull drill; finally, screw in skull screws in each hole for dental cement fixation.\n(D) Wrap copper wire around the anterior bregma screw and posterior lambda screw for cortical EEG recording and grounding reference, respectively.\n(E) Slowly insert the electrode into the pre-drilled hole.\n(F) Fix the electrode and screw it with a small amount of dental cement (core fixation).\n(G) Bend the exposed part of the electrode near the cement by 90 degrees.\n(H) Fix the bend with a small amount of dental cement.\n(I) Insert the fiber optic cannula into the AAV injection site, and the implantation depth should be 0.2 mm shallower than the AAV injection depth.\n(J) Unwind the double-stranded spiral electrode and strip the insulation from the tip of the wires (∼1cm).",
    "(K) Connect the electrode and the copper wire at the anterior and posterior screws to electrode pins of the female connector with solder.\n(L) Apply dental cement at the skull openings with electrode wires and the space between the skull and the bottom side of the female connector.\nAnesthetize a 2-month-old C57 wild-type male mouse with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), then mount it in a stereotaxic apparatus (68507, RWD Life Science, China).\nRemove hair from the mouse’s head, disinfect with iodophor, then cut the skin of the mouse’s head and wipe it with sterile cotton dipped in a small amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide to expose the skull suture.\nAdjust the height of the nasal clip to ensure the bregma and lambda are at the same vertical level (error not more than 0.1 mm).\nNote: To reduce hypothermia, do surgery on a heating pad or under a heat lamp.\nAAV injection (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPrepare a viral cocktail containing AAV-ESARE-ERT2CreERT2-PEST and AAV-EF1a-DIO-GCaMP6s at 0.3 μL per mouse.\nLoad the AAV solution into the glass micropipette.\nDetermine the coordinate of the piriform cortex (AP: +0.5 mm, ML: -2.8 mm, DV: -5.4 mm) for the AAV injection site and drill a hole (0.8 mm diameter) with a skull drill.\nMove the glass micropipette to the injection site and lower the micropipette to a depth of 5.4 mm slowly.\nInject the cocktail virus (0.3 μL) at a rate of 50 nL/min, leave the glass micropipette in place for 10 min after injection, and then slowly withdraw it.\nElectrode implantation (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C–5H).\nDetermine the coordinate of the CA3 (AP: -2.9 mm, ML: -3.0 mm, DV: -3.2 mm) for the electrode site and drill a hole (0.8 mm diameter) with a skull drill.",
    "Drill 4 more holes (0.5 mm diameter) at the anterior bregma, posterior lambda, and the left and right sides of the skull suture separately with a skull drill.\nScrew in skull screws in each hole for dental cement fixation. troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: If the dura is still apparent after drilling, it can be removed gently with ophthalmic forceps.\nCritical: Drill slowly by applying only gentle pressure to the skull to avoid causing trauma to the brain. The sound of the drill will increase in pitch as the drill advances through the skull. You may also see a small amount of fluid leak. Stop immediately.\nCritical: The holes for screwing should not be drilled very large (0.5 mm diameter is recommended), otherwise the screw will easily slip into the holes and thus cling to the skull surface, rendering the dental cement fixation ineffective. A proper hole will allow the screw to be screwed in tightly, and the screw should be screwed in at a depth that leaves a gap with the skull surface.\nWrap copper wire around the anterior bregma screw and posterior lambda screw for cortical EEG recording and grounding reference, respectively.\nSlowly insert the electrode into the pre-drilled hole.\nCritical: Note the orientation of the downward-facing u-shaped tip when implanting the electrode to fit the structure of the implanted nucleus. For example, in this study,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] the electrode was implanted in the hippocampus, which is long and narrow from the rostrum to the cauda, so the two ends of the u-shaped tip should be placed anteriorly and posteriorly.\nFix the electrode and screw with a small amount of dental cement (∼2 mm thick layer for core fixation).\nPause point: Wait for 10–20 min for the dental cement to be solidified before removing the holder from the electrode.",
    "Bend the exposed part of the electrode near the cement by 90 degrees and fix it again with a small amount of dental cement.\nPause point: Wait for 10–20 min for the dental cement to be solidified.\nCritical: Bend the fixed electrode 90 degrees and fix it again with dental cement to make it more stable, otherwise, the unwinding action may cause the electrode to wobble in the brain and damage the brain tissue.\nFiber optic cannula implantation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I).\nPrepare a fiber optic cannula with a diameter of 200 μm, a length of 6 mm, and a numerical aperture of 0.5. Clean the exposed part of the optical fiber with 75% alcohol and then remove the residual alcohol with sterile PBS.\nInsert the fiber optic cannula into the AAV injection site, and the implantation depth should be 0.2 mm shallower than the AAV injection depth.\nApply the dental cement (2 mm thick layer) to cover the fiber optic cannula and the adjacent screw.\nNote: The optimal distance between the AAV injection site and the fiber optic cannula is determined by factors such as the desired activation volume of the targeted brain region, wavelength, power density, and opsin sensitivity.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] In practice, we empirically place the fiber optic cannula 0.2 mm dorsal to the AAV injection site.\nPause point: Wait for 10–20 min for the dental cement to be solidified before removing the cannula holder.\nFemale connector welding (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]J–5L). troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nUnwind the double-stranded spiral electrode with tweezers.\nStrip the insulation from the tip of the wires (∼1cm) with tweezers, hold the female header with one hand, and connect the wires to the electrode pins of the female connector with a solder gun held in the other hand. troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Connect the copper wire at the anterior and posterior screws to the female connector with a solder gun.\nApply dental cement at the skull openings with electrode wires and the space between the skull and the bottom side of the female connector.\nNote: Make sure that all of the wires and wire connections on the connector pins are embedded into the cement (∼5 mm thick layer).\nPause point: Wait for 10–20 min for the dental cement to be solidified.\nCritical: Double check whether the solder connection is stable to avoid false soldering leading to a broken circuit in the subsequent kindling procedure.\nCritical: Do not set the soldering temperature too high (200°C is recommended) and complete the soldering step as soon as possible to avoid potential damage caused by the heat of soldering.\nPause point: Wait for viral transformation and recovery from surgery before performing E-SARE induction experiments. The typical waiting time is 3 weeks, but the precise time must be empirically determined based on specific experimental parameters, including viral serotype, promoter, titer, and volume.\nProvide post-operative care.\nDo not leave until the mouse is ambulatory.\nKeep on the heating pad and/or wrapped up for warmth.\nGive analgesia (e.g., meloxicam) for at least 24 h.\nSupplement food and water as necessary.\nHouse mice on soft bedding and make sure they can move freely without their headcaps and implants hitting obstacles.\nE-SARE induction experiments in mouse hippocampal fast kindling model\nTiming: 3 days\nFollowing the completion of the AAV injection, electrode and fiber optic cannula implantation, wait three weeks for virus transformation, and then label activity-dependent neuronal ensembles in mouse hippocampal kindling model under tamoxifen induction.\nPrepare tamoxifen solution. troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCalculate the tamoxifen dose based on the mice’s body weight (80 mg/kg).",
    "Prepare the tamoxifen solution (20 mg/mL) by adding the tamoxifen crystals directly to corn oil in a tube shielded from light with aluminum foil.\nCritical: Tamoxifen needs to be handled carefully because of its toxicity.\nImmerse the tube containing the tamoxifen solution in an ultrasonic water bath at 37°C for 30 min until the tamoxifen is completely dissolved (the solution should be clear with no visible crystals). troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAlternatives: Place the tube containing the tamoxifen solution horizontally on a shaker at 25°C and shake for 24 h to make it dissolve.\nStore at 4°C for use.\nNote: Tamoxifen is quite light-sensitive and therefore needs to be protected from light during preparation and storage.\nNote: The tamoxifen solution should be clear; if the solution becomes cloudy, it should be discarded. Tamoxifen solution can be stored at 4°C for up to four weeks, but we recommend preparing the tamoxifen solution fresh, just prior to use.\nTamoxifen induction in hippocampal kindling model. troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIP-Ens (neuronal ensemble activated in the interictal period) labeling:\nGive electrical stimulation of the hippocampus (400 μA, 20 Hz, 2 s trains, 1 ms monophasic square-wave pulses, 30 min apart, 2 times)8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] with a constant-current stimulator (SEN-7203, SS-202J; Nihon Kohden, Japan) to induce 2 focal seizures on the first day (9:00 a.m.).\nNote: The after-discharge durations (ADDs) induced by these two hippocampal kindling stimulations are typically 10–20 s.\nIntraperitoneally inject (80 mg/kg) tamoxifen solution (20 mg/mL) at the same time (9:00 a.m.) on the second and third days.\nNote: Because of the high viscosity of corn oil, both aspirating and injecting tamoxifen solution need to be done slowly.",
    "Critical: Ensure that tamoxifen is administered at the same time, thus labeling interictal-activated ensemble within the same time interval. (Because it is unclear whether the neuronal ensembles activated during the interictal period in different time intervals have distinct functions).\nPause point: Wait 1 week for viral expression before performing calcium signal recording.\nFS-Ens (neuronal ensemble activated in electrical-induced focal seizures) labeling:\nIntraperitoneally inject (80 mg/kg) tamoxifen solution (20 mg/mL) on the first day (9:00 a.m.).\nGive electrical stimulation of the hippocampus (400 μA, 20 Hz, 2 s trains, 1 ms monophasic square-wave pulses, 30 min apart, 2 times) with a constant-current stimulator (SEN-7203, SS-202J; Nihon Kohden, Japan) to induce 2 focal seizures on the second day (9:00 a.m.).\nRepeat operations a and b above for two consecutive days.\nNote: The time between the administration of tamoxifen and the application of electrical stimulation is 24 h apart.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nCritical: Avoid additional environmental or operational stimulations during tamoxifen induction experiments. For example, before tamoxifen injection, acclimate mice to the stimuli associated with intraperitoneal injection, including grasping and injecting empty needle; when injecting tamoxifen, take care to gently grasp mice as well as gently inject; after tamoxifen injection, keep mice in their previously familiar environment for at least three days, e.g., without changing bedding as well as co-caging mice.\nPause point: Wait 1 week for viral expression before performing calcium signal recording.\nCalcium signal recording of labeled viruses\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes the composition and setup of the fiber photometry system, the recording of EEG and calcium fluorescence signals, and the analysis of the photometry data.\nFiber photometry system settings.",
    "Use the single-channel fiber photometry system (Thinker Tech Nanjing Biotech Co., Ltd.) for calcium fluorescence recordings, consisting of a 488 nm diode laser (OBIS 488LS; Coherent) (light intensity 0.01–0.03 mW), reflected by a dichroic mirror (MD498, Thorlabs), and coupled by an objective lens to an optic fiber (fiber diameter 200 μm, 0.37 NA, Inper Co., Ltd., China).\nTurn on the optic fiber recording instrument and the software.\nEEG and calcium fluorescence signal recordings.\nSelect the storage location for the record file, and click record to start.\nRecord the EEGs with PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Australia) at a sample rate of 1000 Hz (Notch filter: 50 Hz) and calcium fluorescence signals in the basal state for 100 s.\nApply 2 s of electrical stimulation to induce a seizure and observe the animal behavior to determine the seizure stage which is scored by a trained observer according to the Racine scale,12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] while recording the EEGs and calcium fluorescence signals for another 100 s.\nNote: Racine scale: (1) facial movements such as chewing, orofacial twitching, and sluggishness; (2) head nodding; (3) unilateral forelimb clonus; (4) bilateral forelimb clonus and rearing; (5) bilateral forelimb clonus, rearing, and falling. Stages 1–3 are considered focal seizures and stages 4–5 are generalized seizures.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nCritical: Minimize human activities and noise around the instrument during recording.\nPhotometry data analysis.\nExport the photometry data to MATLAB Mat files using the MATLAB plug-in called OpSignal provided by Thinker Tech (Thinker Tech Nanjing Biotech Co., Ltd.).\nTake the average fluorescence value 2 s before the zero point as the control baseline fluorescence intensity (defined as F0).\nCalculate the difference between the current fluorescent intensity F and the baseline fluorescence intensity F0.\nUse the ratio, that is ΔF/F=(F-F0)/F0, to analyze the calcium signal change for each event.",
    "Verification of virus expression, electrode and fiber optic cannula site.\nAnesthetize mice by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg).\nCritical: Confirm that mice are fully anesthetized (e.g., check for the lack of whisker movement) before proceeding to the next step.\nLay the mouse on its back.\nOpen the mouse chest to expose the heart.\nInsert the left ventricle with a needle (25G) for perfusion.\nCut the right atrium.\nPerfuse the mouse with 15 mL of PBS buffer and 15 mL of 4% PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution.\nCarefully pull out the fiber optic cannula, female connector and dental cement on the surface of the mouse skull with hemostatic forceps.\nIsolate the brain.\nPostfix it in 4% PBS-buffered PFA at 4°C for 6–12 h.\nDehydrate it with 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS at 4°C.\nObtain 40 μm frozen coronal slices using a freezing microtome (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nFloat them in a freezing solution (PBS: glycerol: ethylene glycol = 5:2:3).\nStore them in a −20°C freezer.\nWash the brain slices four times with PBS for 10 min each and then seal them with an anti-fluorescence quencher containing DAPI (Yeasen Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).\nImage with laser confocal microscope (TCS SP8, Leica)."
