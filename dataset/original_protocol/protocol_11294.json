  "procedures": [
    "All the procedures including animal subjects have been approved by the regulatory authorities: LANUV (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NRW) and Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, Germany. All manipulations should be performed in sterile conditions (under laminar flow hood) using sterile reagents and instruments (syringes, scissors, forceps, disposable scalpels, Petri dishes).\nNOTE: The overall scheme of the protocol is shown in the Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of B16F10 melanoma cell line\nPrepare mycoplasma-negative cells grown to a 90% confluent monolayer (approximately 10 x 106 cells/T75 flask) in complete Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDMc: IMDM + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) + 1% penicillin-streptomycin).\nRemove the medium, and rinse the cells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Apply 6 mL of a cell detachment solution containing proteolytic and collagenolytic enzymes (see the Table of Materials), and incubate at 37 °C for 2 min.\nKnock the flask gently to mobilize remaining adherent cells from the bottom. Collect the cell suspension in 15 mL tubes and centrifuge at 300 x g for 7 min and 20 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet well in 1 mL of PBS. Add 14 mL of PBS and centrifuge (300 x g and 20 °C for 7 min).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of PBS.\nCount the cells, and resuspend them to the concentration of 3 x 106/mL PBS (for the step 2) or 6 x 106/mL PBS (for the step 6) for injection. Keep cells on ice for a maximum of 30 min.\n2. Allogenic tumor model in mice\nUse 10 female Ifnar1-/- mice 8-12 weeks old that are kept under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions.",
    "NOTE: Female mice are preferable in a subcutaneous model of tumor growth, since males are more aggressive and thus prone to infractions of the tumor site, which influences tumor growth.\nShave the skin of the mouse on the flank with an electrical shaver, and disinfect the skin with tissue wet with 70% ethanol.\nCollect the prepared B16F10 melanoma cells at a concentration of 3 x 106/mL PBS (see the step 1) in a 1 mL syringe and 0.4 x 19 mm needle. Inject 100 μL of the suspension subcutaneously.\n\t\nMix the cells well before every injection. Use needles not less than 0.4 mm in diameter as to not disturb tumor cells.\nPlace up to 5 mice in one cage, and control tumor size (length, width and depth) with a caliper for 14 days.\n\tNOTE: According to the animal regulations, the tumor size should not exceed 15 mm in diameter, mice with bigger or necrotic/open tumors should be sacrificed beforehand.\nAt day 14, sacrifice the mice in the CO2 chamber.\nDisinfect the skin with 70% ethanol and remove tumors with scissors and forceps in a sterile Petri dish. Keep tumors in a 50 mL tube in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEMc: DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin-streptomycin) on ice.\n3. TAN isolation\nPlace tumors into sterile 6-well plates, 5 tumors per well. Cut tumors into 2-3 mm pieces with sterile scissors.\n\t\nDigest with 1 mL of dispase/collagenase D/DNase I solution (0.2 mg/0.2 mg/100 mg in 1 mL of DMEMc) per tumor. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humid incubator, and mix with a 10 mL syringe without a needle every 15 min 3 times.",
    "To remove undigested fibers, mesh cells through 100 µm filters into 15 mL tubes (one well per filter per tube). Add PBS to 15 mL, centrifuge tubes at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant.\nLyse erythrocytes with a lysis buffer (NH4Cl 150 mM, KHCO3 10 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, pH 7.3, 20 °C) by adding 1 mL into each tube. Mix well, and combine the solution from all tubes into one. Stop the reaction after 2 minutes with 11 mL of ice-cold (4 °C) DMEMc.\nCentrifuge at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet with 15 mL of cold PBS. Centrifuge at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of PBS. Add 3 μL of Fc-block antibodies (CD16/CD32, stock 0.5 mg/mL), and incubate on ice for 15 min.\nAdd antibodies: 10 μL of Ly6G-PE (stock 0.2 mg/mL) and 10 μL of CD11b-APC (stock 0.2 mg/mL). Add 20 μL of 6-Diamidin-2-phenylindol viability dye (DAPI, stock 5 mg/mL) and incubate on ice in darkness for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Another combination of viability dyes and fluorescent conjugates of antibodies can be used.\nAdd PBS up to 15 mL, centrifuge at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in DMEMc to the concentration approximately 10 x 106/mL, and keep on ice.\nSort CD11b+ Ly6Ghi alive (DAPI-negative) neutrophils with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (gating strategy see Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Keep the tube with cell suspension and the tube with DMEMc for sorted cells at 4 °C. Use the following optimal sorting settings: a 70 μm nozzle, a threshold rate of maximal 22,000 events/second and a flow rate of 1-3.",
    "Check the purity of the sorted neutrophils using a cytometer for a recommended purity of >95%.\nCentrifuge sorted neutrophils at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the sorted cells in DMEMc to the concentration of 1 x 106/mL.\n\tNOTE: The expected number of neutrophils in one 14-day B16F10 tumor (10 mm diameter) is approximately 3 x 104 cells.\n4. NAMPT inhibition in TANs in vitro\nPrepare FK866 (NAMPT inhibitor) stock in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 100 mM.\nSeed sorted neutrophils (step 3.11) into 2 wells of a 96-well U-bottom plate (1.5 x 105 neutrophils/well). Add FK866 into the intervention well (final concentration of 100 nM), and an equal amount of DMEMc with DMSO into the control well. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humid incubator.\nCentrifuge at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant. Resuspend in 200 μL of PBS in each well. Repeat 2 times.\nCentrifuge at 460 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant. Resuspend in commercial endothelial cell growth medium (supplemented with 4 µL/mL endothelial cell growth supplement, 0.1 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal growth factor, 1 ng/mL recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, 90 µg/mL heparin and 1 µg/mL hydrocortisone) to a final concentration of 0.2 x 106 cells/mL (in 0.75 mL) (for step 5) or in PBS to the final concentration of 0.6 x 106 cells/mL (in 0.25 mL) (for step 6).\n5. Estimation of angiogenic properties of TANs using the aortic ring assay",
    "Dissect the thoracic aorta from a male C57BL/6J (WT) mouse. Clean and cut into 0.5 mm width rings. Place all rings in a well of a 24-well plate with 1 mL of supplemented endothelial cell growth medium. Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humid incubator.\n\tNOTE: The use of young (younger than 8 weeks) male mice for aorta dissection is preferable, since they give a more robust angiogenic response15.\nFill the wells of the 96-well flat-bottom plate with 50 µL of solubilized basement membrane matrix, let the gel set for 30 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humid incubator to allow the matrix to polymerize. Prepare at least 3 wells per condition.\nEmbed the rings in solubilized basement membrane matrix by placing an aortic ring on the top of the solid matrix layer, 1 ring in the center of each well. Add another 50 µL of solubilized basement membrane matrix to cover each ring.\n\t\nPlace the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humid incubator for another 30 min to allow the polymerization of the second matrix layer.\nAdd 150 μL/well of supplemented endothelial cell growth medium and 2x104 Ifnar1-/- TANs (control and FK866-treated) (step 4.4).\nIncubate the plate for 14 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humid incubator.\nImage using a standard phase-contrast microscope and estimate the endothelial branching. Quantitative assessment of vessel morphometric and spatial parameters including branching index can be performed automatically using the image processing program designed for scientific images.\n\tNOTE: Representative results are depicted in the Figure 3.\n6. Adoptive transfer of treated neutrophils in the allogenic tumor model\nPrepare B16F10 melanoma cells (step 1.6) in PBS at a concentration of 6 x 106 cells/mL.",
    "Prepare 2 types of neutrophils: FK866-treated neutrophils and control untreated neutrophils (step 4.4) in PBS at a concentration 6 x 105 cells/mL. Mix neutrophils with B16F10 melanoma cells (the final neutrophil to tumor cells ratio 1:10) to have 2 types of cell mixtures.\nTake 10 female WT mice 8-12 weeks old, 5 in each group. Shave the skin on the flank with an electrical shaver, and disinfect with 70% ethanol.\nInject 100 µL of the cell suspension (step 6.2) subcutaneously with an insulin syringe and a 0.4 mm diameter needle, to both groups of mice. Place 1-5 mice from the same group in one cage.\nAt day 2, prepare 2 types of neutrophils: FK866-treated neutrophils and control untreated neutrophils (step 4.4) in PBS at a concentration 6 x 105 cells/mL. Inject 100 µL of cell suspension (step 6.4) i.v. into the tail vein with an insulin syringe and a 0.4 mm diameter needle, to both groups of mice. Place mice back to the cage.\n7. Tumor growth measurement, histological examination\nMonitor tumor growth every other day. Evaluate the tumor size with calipers and calculate the tumor volume with the formula V=4/3*π*(h*w2)/8 (h=height, w=width, depth= width).\nSacrifice mice at the day 14 in the CO2 chamber. Remove tumors and measure the tumor weights.\nFreeze tumors in optimum cutting temperature compound in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.\nThaw the samples to -20 °C and prepare 5 μm sections using a cryotome. Let the cryocuts dry for 30 min at 20 °C. Fix the sections in -20 °C cold acetone for 2 min and let them dry for 30 min at 20 °C.\nBlock with Fc-block antibodies (CD16/CD32, stock 0.5 mg/mL 1:500) in PBS for 1 h at 20 °C.",
    "Stain with rabbit anti mouse Laminin gamma antibody (1:1500 in PBS, 200 µL) for 1 h at 20 °C. Wash with PBS three times.\nStain with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (stock 0.5 mg/mL, 1:400 in PBS,), anti-mouse αSMA (1:500 in PBS) and 2 µL of DAPI (stock 5 mg/mL, 1:100 in PBS) in a final volume of 200 µL of antibody solution. Incubate for 1 h at 20 °C in darkness. Wash with PBS three times.\nDry slides for 20 minutes at 20 °C in darkness. Mount with anhydrous mounting medium for microscopy and cover with a coverslip. Let it dry 1 h in 37 °C.\nPerform microscopical examination. Quantify the vascularization by counting the total number (optionally area) of Laminin+ vessels and the number (area) of SMA+ developed vessels.\n\tNOTE: To perform image analysis, take all images under the same conditions (light, contrast, magnification). In this case, processing parameters are fixed, and image processing becomes completely automatic. Representative results are depicted in the Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nSubscription Required.
