    "Cell lysisPlate 2.5 x 105 HeLa-cells per well on 6-wells in 2 ml medium (see Materials and Reagents 6) and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Next day control cells, aspirate medium and replace with fresh medium. Stimulate cell with apoptosis inducing agent (here 250 ng/ml CD95L) in a time-dependent manner (here: 20, 40, 60, 90, 120 min). Stimulation dose and time is cell line dependent and have to be tested for each cell line. Stimulation should be performed in a way that one 6-well plate can be harvested at once.Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Add cold PBS to the cells (do not aspirate media), harvest them by scraping and transfer medium including cells into a new tube (everything on ice). Be careful to transfer all the cells into the new tube.Centrifuge at 4 °C, 500 x g for 5 min.Discard supernatant, but not the cell pellet!Add 1 ml of cold PBS.Centrifuge at 4 °C, 500 x g for 5 min.Aspirate and discard supernatant.Store the pellet at -20 °C or continue with cell lysis by resuspending the cell pellet directly in 30 µl ice-cold lysis buffer (see Recipe 3), be careful to resuspend it completely.Incubate on ice for 30 min, vortex 2-3 times.Centrifuge at 4 °C, 16,400 x g for 15 min.Transfer the supernatant (= lysate) into a new tube, discard cell pellet. The supernatant should have a clear, yellowish colour.Measurement of protein concentrationMeasure protein concentration by mixing 2 µl of lysate with 1,000 µl Bio-Rad assay dye reagent (see Recipe 4) in a cuvette.Prepare a BSA-standard with dilutions according to manufacturer’s instructions.Mix 2 µl lysis buffer with 1,000 µl Bio-Rad solution and use it as blank.Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "The blank should have a brown-red colour, while the samples with lysates should turn into blue.Measure protein concentration for samples and BSA-standard at 595 nm with Bio-Rad SmartSpec plus or other spectrophotometer. Follow instructions of spectrophotometer for protein standard. Be careful to measure within the linear range and to dilute samples with too high protein concentrations. The expected protein concentration is between 3 and 5 mg/ml.SDS-PAGE and blot transferPrepare 25 µg of protein lysate with lysis buffer and 4x Laemmli sample buffer (reducing, see Recipe 9) to a final volume of 15 µl (e.g., mix 5 µl of a 5 µg/µl lysate with 6.25 µl lysis buffer and 3.75 µl sample buffer). If the protein concentration is too low you can use gels with higher loading volume or decrease protein amount to 20 µg.Heat the samples at 95 °C for 5 min.Spin down shortly to avoid steam on the lid.Prepare a chamber with gel and 1x Tris/Glycine/SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate) buffer (see Recipe 5).Load samples on 12% Bio-Rad pre-cast stain-free gels. Be careful to load the complete sample into the well without leakage and spillover. Use of 25 µl Hamilton syringe or long pipette tips makes loading on a gel easier. Put the end of the tip or the syringe to the bottom of the well and very slowly push the sample into the well. Then carefully remove the Hamilton syringe or the tip from the well without spillover of the sample. When using Hamilton syringe rinse it three times in-between loading the next sample.Load 2 µl of all blue protein standard.Run the gel with 150 V until the protein dye passes the bottom of the gel. Check the progress from time to time.Place gel in Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer.",
    "If you use Bio-Rad stain-free gels, activate the dye in the gel with one minute UV light, take a picture of the gel and check the separation of the proteins. It is not necessary to use Bio-Rad stain-free gel system. The system is based on the implementation of chemical compounds that react with tryptophan under UV light resulting in fluorescence. The fluorophore is visible on the membrane after blotting.Prepare a sandwich consisting of Whatman paper sheets, a membrane (PVDF or Nitrocellulose) = Blot, the gel and Whatman paper sheets in presence of a transfer buffer. Be careful to place the sandwich in the blotting system oriented to the cathode, so that the proteins will be transferred from the gel to the membrane, not into the Whatman paper. Blot with Transblot Turbo transfer system according to instruction with 2.5 A, 25 V for 9 min. It is possible to use a different system for Western blot as well.Rinse blot with PBS-T (PBS-Tween, see Recipe 6) for a short time.If you are using Bio-Rad stain-free gels, take a picture of the blot and check blotting results for air bubbles and equal transfer.Membrane blocking and detection of caspase-10Incubate in blocking buffer (see Recipe 7) for 1 h shaking at room temperature. The blot should be covered completely with buffer.Rinse 3 x for 5 min with PBS-T, spill buffer into the dish, not directly onto the blot to avoid removing of proteins.Incubate with primary antibody dilution (see Recipe 8) overnight shaking at 4 °C. You can use the antibody solution several times, but store it a 4 °C and check for contamination before using it. When the antibody signal is fading, prepare a new antibody solution.Wash blot 4 x with PBS-T for 5 min, shaking at room temperature.",
    "Prepare a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibody in blocking buffer, approx. 20 ml/blot.Incubate the blot in the secondary antibody dilution for 60 min at room temperature while shaking.Wash blot 3 x with PBS-T for 10 min while shaking at room temperature.Rinse blot with 1 ml Luminata forte solution and wait a few seconds, the complete blot should be covered with the solution.Place blot in the imager machine and scan the blot.Wash blot 3 x in PBS-T for 5 min.Detection of caspase-8 and actinRepeat steps of D3-D10 for caspase-8 and actin antibody detection. The use of isotype specific secondary antibodies allows to detect caspase-8 after caspase-10 on the same membrane. Alternatively it is possible to use two separate blots for detection of caspase-8 and 10 (see Figure 1C)."
