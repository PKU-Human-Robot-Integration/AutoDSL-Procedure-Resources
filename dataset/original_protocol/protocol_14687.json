    "All operative procedures were completed in compliance with Johns Hopkins University and the United States Department of Agriculture and Public Health Service requirements. This protocol follows the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee, institutional review board approved guidelines (protocol number M013M490). Final survival data was recorded for the surgical procedures described below. Both donor and recipient animals receive pre-emptive anesthesia using buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg s.c. one hour prior to surgery and in the recipient animal buprenorphine is re-administered at the same dose after transplant and re-dosed as needed in the first 48 hours after surgery. \n1. Donor Allograft Recovery\nNote: Begin the donor portion of the transplant 40 min earlier than the recipient transplant to minimize recipient anesthesia time and to facilitate a simultaneous end time or slightly earlier end time versus the recipient preparation.\nUse standard sterile microsurgical instruments and sterile gloves for the procedure. Our laboratory uses autoclave sterilization of microsurgical instruments.\nAnesthetize the donor mouse (male) using isoflurane induction vaporizer at 4%. Using atraumatic mechanical clippers remove the hair from the cervical, thoracic, and abdominal region. Place the animal in the supine position and maintain isoflurane on 1-2% through a nose cone. Ensure adequate anesthesia throughout the procedure by periodically evaluating the toe pinch withdrawal reflex.\nPrior to the skin incision, widely prepare the operative by applying povidone iodine antiseptic followed by isopropyl alcohol using a sterile cotton swab.\nBegin with a superficial transverse skin incision with scissors across the cervical and abdominal skin. Connect both incisions bilaterally along the midaxillary lines.",
    "Using microsurgical forceps dissect the cervical region bilaterally to identify, ligate and divide the external jugular veins with 6-0 silk suture and scissors. Then using electrocautery divide the sternocleidomastoid muscles to expose the internal jugular veins and common carotid arteries, bilaterally. Pass a 6-0 silk suture under the left-sided and the right-sided common carotid and internal jugular veins in bulk fashion.\n\tNOTE: They will be tied and divided later in Step 1.9.\nSharply divide the strap muscles and associated loose areolar tissue, located anterior to the trachea, using scissors to free the remaining attachments of the cervical region.\nUsing bipolar electrocautery and sharp dissection, divide the pectoralis major muscles and clavicles to expose the subclavian vessels and ligate (6-0 silk suture) and divide proximally.\nNext, gently, grasp and withdraw the animal’s penis. Along the dorsum of the penis visualize the dorsal vein of the penis, and disinfect the region with isopropyl alcohol. Using a 30 G needle, inject 30,000 units of heparin intravenously through the dorsal vein and allow the penis to recoil back to its original position.  Partial leakage of the heparin solution into the surrounding tissue may occur. \nUsing the previously placed bulk ties around common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, ligate and divide the structures, bilaterally.\nNext use scissors to make a transverse intrabdominal incision. Eviscerate the intestines to expose the infrahepatic inferior vena cava and inject 2 ml of cold Euro-Collins cardioplegia solution into the infrahepatic inferior vena cava. Ensure proper injection by visualizing liver discoloration and cessation of the heartbeat prior to advancing to the following step.\n\tNOTE: Euro-Collins solution is prepared in our laboratory, see table of specific reagents and instruments.",
    "Using scissors access the intrathoracic cavity via a bilateral diaphragmatic incision from the exposed abdomen. Extend the incision cephalad through the intercostals muscles and ribs. Reflect chest wall exposing the heart, thymus, and great vessels while simultaneously ensuring preservation of the internal thoracic vessels along the chest wall.\nInject the suprahepatic inferior vena cava with 4 ml of cold Euro-Collins cardioplegia solution.\nIdentify the root of the aorta and trace distally to the descending aorta. Sharply cut the descending aorta (preserving maximal length).\nIdentify the pulmonary trunk and divide just proximal to its branch point (preserving maximal length). Then using 2 ml of cold Euro-Collins cardioplegia solution, flush the pulmonary trunk and heart by placing a soft plastic tip catheter into the lumen of the pulmonary trunk.\nUsing a 6-0 silk suture, ligate and divide the inferior vena cava, confluence of pulmonary veins, and accessory branches of the bilateral superior vena cava. Then elevate and dissect the heart cephalad from the attachments along the main stem bronchi and trachea with care not to enter the airway. Using sharp and bipolar electrocautery dissect the chest wall, thymus, and heart completely liberating it from the donor mouse.\nFinally, trim the allograft chest wall ex vivo to a smaller size, using scissors, along the sternum and lateral costae, with care not to disrupt the internal thoracic vessels (Figure 1A). To minimize hemorrhage following revascularization, use bipolar electrocauterization along the borders of the osteomusculocutaneous sternum.\nPlace the allograft in 10 ml of cold (4o Celcius) Euro-Collins solution if the recipient is not prepared for inset. However, if the recipient is ready for inset, transfer the allograft straight to the recipient operative field.\n2. Recipient Preparation",
    "Note: To minimize recipient anesthesia time, begin the recipient preparation at a separate operative station approximately 40 min prior to completion of the donor allograft harvest.\nUse a separate set of standard sterile microsurgical instruments and sterile gloves for the procedure.\nAnesthetize the recipient mouse (male or female) using isoflurane induction vaporizer at 4%. Using atraumatic mechanical clippers remove the hair from the right cervical and thoracic region.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position and angle the right upper limb slightly inferiorly forming a 110 degree angle between the head and right upper limb. Maintain anesthesia on 1-2% isoflurane through a nose cone.\nPlace petroleum ophthalmic ointment on the mouse eyes using a cotton tip applicator. Prior to the skin incision, widely prepare the operative site using povidone iodine antiseptic followed by isopropyl alcohol.\nUsing scissors, make a skin incision from the midline along the right inferior border of the mandible and extend the incision infero-laterally to the right thoracic region. Using blunt dissection with microvascular forceps, mobilize the external jugular vein by circumferentially free the vessel from soft tissue and adventitia. Divide all branches using electrocautery, and remove the right lobe of the submandibular gland using sharp dissection and electrocautery to free space for the allograft.\nEnsure enough length of the external jugular vein to evert over a cuff, and ligate the external jugular vein using a 6-0 silk suture. Insert the vein through the lumen of a precut polyimide cuff and use a bulldog microvascular clamp to fix the vessel-cuff complex in place. Then using scissors, proximally divide the external jugular vein, evert over the cuff, and fix in place with a 10-0 nylon suture. (Figure 1B)",
    "Divide the right sternocleidomastoid muscle with bipolar electrocautery to expose the common carotid artery. Circumferentially mobilize the artery cephalad to the distal most point within the cervical region. This is accomplished using blunt dissection of the vessel with forceps to remove soft tissue and surrounding adventitia.\nUsing 6-0 silk suture, ligate and divide the common carotid artery. Pass the artery through the lumen of a precut polyimide cuff and fix it in place with a bulldog microvascular clamp as close to the thoracic inlet as possible. Divide the vessel distally, gently dilate the vessel using a microsurgical dilator, evert over the cuff, and fix in place with a 10-0 nylon suture. (Figure 1B)\n\tNOTE: The specific microsurgical dilator is described in the table of specific reagents and instruments.\n3. Allograft Inset\nMaintain standard sterile instrumentation and sterile gloves to place the allograft within the recipient cervical region in an upside down and oblique position.\nNext, place the donor descending aortic lumen over the arterial cuff construct of the recipient and fix it in place it with a 10-0 nylon suture (Figure 1C and 1D).\nFashion the same anastomosis as in step 3.2 between the donor pulmonary artery and the everted external jugular vein-cuff construct of the recipient mouse (Figure 1C and 1D).\nFirst remove venous microvascular clamp (external jugular vein clamp) and then release the arterial clamp (common carotid artery clamp). During arterial reperfusion, inspect the entirety of the allograft to address any hemorrhage. If hemorrhage is visualized, reapply the arterial clamp to minimize blood loss and mitigate the source of bleeding using bipolar electrocautery.",
    "Inspect the graft and ensure hemostasis. Release and completely remove the arterial microvascular clamp. Observe the heart to show signs of reperfusion, which will be instantaneously apparent with rapid volume expansion of the heart chambers, and wait for beating to begin within 0.5-1 min. Use warm saline (35° Celsius) to moisten the heart.\nDrape the chest wall into an anatomical position so as not to induce any kinking or tensions on the anastomoses. Close the skin of the surgical wound is using 6-0 continuous nylon sutures (Figure 1E).\n4. Postoperative Care\nAdminister a 0.3 ml normal saline intraperitoneal fluid bolus immediately postoperatively for fluid replacement.\nThen subcutaneously inject buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (5mg/kg) for pain and infection prophylaxis, respectively.\nPlace the animal under a heat lamp until awaking from anesthesia and return to sternal recumbency. During recovery, inspect the neck to visualize the fibrillating heartbeat of the allograft ensuring adequate allograft perfusion.\nOnce awake and in the recumbent position, return the mouse to a separate cage (without the company of other mice) where it can receive food and water ad libitum. Due to any temporary minor restrictive motion of the right upper limb, leave a gelatin food source on the floor of the cage.\nObserve the recipient mouse for 1 hr postoperatively and then return it to the cage facility where it can receive food and water ad libitum and is inspected three times a day for the first 24 hr for activity and nutritional intake. Monitor mice for signs of pain and distress and re-dose with buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) subcutaneously twice a day as needed for the first 72 hr. Examine the animals daily thereafter and weigh them every week.",
    "Consult with a veterinary staff member if any mice display signs of pain, distress, or decreased feed intake. Consider early euthanasia (in our protocol the euthanasia technique employs CO2 overdose for 7 min, followed by cervical dislocation).\nCessation of the allograft heart beat is defined as a specific endpoint prompting the mouse to be sacrificed.\nSubscription Required.
