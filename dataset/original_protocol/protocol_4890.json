    "Note: All steps to be carried out under cell culture hood, i.e., sterile conditions. Determination of required volumesDetermine the volume of collagen, neutralizing solution, 10x PBS and growth media needed as follows:Calculate the volume of collagen needed to make a collagen gel of 1.3-3 mg/ml final concentration for 8-chambered slide (0.5 ml/well) or 6-well culture plate (2 ml/well).Note: We typically make extra gel solution (~1 ml extra) to account for the viscosity of collagen, and to ensure we have enough for each gel. The amount of neutralizing solution (freshly made 1 N NaOH) is calculated as 0.023x volume of collagen. 10x PBS is added as 1x (v/v for total volume). The remaining volume is made up with filtered DD water.Note: If not using 10x PBS then replace the final volume with 5% growth media. Preparation of cells Myometrial cells (immortalized cells; see Malik et al., 2008) plated in T75 flask should be 50%-80% confluent before trypsinization.Note: The cells should be actively dividing and not contact inhibited as would be the case if 100% confluent.Completely remove the growth media from the flask before adding 3 ml of trypsin. Make sure whole surface area of the T75 flask is covered by swirling the trypsin solution around. Leave for 3 min, tap the flask and observe under the microscope to see if myometrial cells are detached. Once the cells are observed to have detached from surface of the flask, stop the trypsinization reaction by adding growth media (10%) at 1:1 (v/v) ratio. Pipette the cells in 50 ml conical tube.Note: The growth media 10% DMEM/F12 is at room temperature.Centrifuge the cells at 800 rpm/75 x g for 10 min at 25 °C. Resuspend the pellet in smallest volume of 10% growth medium.",
    "*It is very important at this point to get the myometrial cells into single cell suspension.Note: Resuspension volume depends on how many cells you have, e.g., 1 x 106 cells can be resuspended in 0.75-1 ml growth media. *If unable to get into single cell suspension, more 10% growth media can be added but make a note of total volume. The speed of mixing the cells should be slow and gentle as high speed can lead to shearing of cells.Count cells using automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Plan to use 1-1.5 x 105 cells/ml of 3D collagen gel to give a final cell count of ~5 x 104 cells/well in 8 chambered slide. Note: Number of cells to be added should be optimized based on rate of division of the cells being used. Cancer cells tend to divide faster compared to normal cells.The cells can be kept under the hood (under sterile conditions) for up to 15 min. As the cells tend to settle to the bottom of the tube on long storage, gentle mixing is recommended before addition to the prepared collagen matrix. Culture of myometrium cells in 3D cultureNote: The following steps are critical.Before the start of experiment all solutions (see Materials and Reagents) should be on ice and ready. Metal holder for conical tubes, 50 ml conical tubes and the serological pipettes in -20 °C or 4 °C.As the myometrium cells are being counted, all solutions on ice including the rat tail collagen should be moved under the cell culture hood. Once the cells are counted and ready, the following steps should be accomplished within a 10 min time period to avoid loss of cell viability. Have a 50 ml conical tube in cold metal holder ready in the cell culture hood.",
    "To create the collagen gels, add the appropriate volume of 10x PBS, DD water (or 5% growth media) to the cold 50 ml tube. Next, add the neutralizing solution, and finally add the collagen. Mix all solutions together using cold pipettes.Note: The viscous collagen tends to move smoothly when using cold pipettes as compared to ones at room temperature. Make sure to keep the neutralizing solution and collagen cold (on ice) until you are ready to use them, as higher temperatures increase the rate of collagen polymerization. If 5% media is used, the solution will have yellow/pinkish hue. Add the cells (0.5 ml, equivalent to 5 x 105 cells) using a 1 ml Eppendorf pipette in a swirling motion in the middle of the collagen solution in the cold 50 ml tube. Quickly mix the solution again with a cold pipette.Important note: From this step onward there should be no stopping time. The pipetting steps should be carried out quickly as the cells are in cold solution they can lose viability. Pipette 0.5 ml per well in an 8-chambered slide. Take a sterile Eppendorf pipette tip and run it along the inside wall of the wells. This tends to evenly spread the collagen solution such that the gel does not have a concave structure due to surface tension. Note: The chambered slides are also kept cold. They can be placed on an ice pack inside the culture hood.Place the lid back on the chamber slide and immediately place the covered slides in the incubator, at 37 °C. The collagen gel with cells will polymerize in approximately 30 min.Add 0.35 ml of 5% growth medium gently to the polymerized 3D culture. The volume should cover the gel completely.",
    "Cell cultures are maintained in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. *Fresh media is replaced every day or as required.Note: As the myometrial cells (smooth muscle cells) grow, the collagen matrix tends to contract. Addition of 5% media instead of 10% media slows down this process.*The cell culture media DMEM/F12 contains phenol red which is a pH indicator. When media in 3D myometrium cell culture changes from red to yellow, it indicates to acidic pH of the media. This is indicative of actively dividing cells. To maintain a near neutral pH (7.2-7.3), it is important to replace media of the 3D cultures in the 8-chamber slides every day. Microscope image: When observed under the microscope the morphology of myometrial cells, added into the 3D collagen gel, includes spherical shape and translucent appearance, indicating that the cells are healthy and alive. As the cells from human myometrium are smooth muscle cells, within 8-10 h our cells obtain the long elongated spindle shape characteristic of smooth muscle cells. Within 2 weeks the cells form a network of spindle shaped cells (see Figure 1).Important note: If the myometrium cells have not obtained spindle shape within 48 h of plating in collagen 3D culture it may be assumed that the cells are no longer viable. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161011/20161011032228_6179.jpgFigure 1. 3D myometrial culture whole gel mount exposed to anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (intercellular protein, green); and DAPI (blue) for nuclear identification.

    "Note: A network of cells should have formed by 4 weeks of growth. This is assuming that all cells plated were viable.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161011/20161011032610_2319.jpgFigure 2. 3D myometrial culture whole gel mount exposed to anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (intercellular protein, green); and DAPI (blue) for nuclear identification. A. 10% confluent; B. 30% confluent; C. 50% confluent (2 weeks of growth); D. 80% confluent (4 weeks of growth). Confluence calculation is based on visual approximation. 10x magnification.Fixation: After two 1 min washes with 1x PBS (without Mg2+ or Ca2+) the gels are fixed overnight in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde, at 4 °C with gently shaking. Note: Most washes are done in the chamber itself. Make sure the gels are completely covered. In an 8-chamber slide, 350-400 µl volume is required. The aspiration rate on the vacuum aspirator (same as in the culture hood) is kept to low. We usually attach an unfiltered 1 ml pipette tip with narrow tip to the aspirator tube. The aspiration should be done carefully as the collagen gels, if not firm, can get aspirated.The gels are allowed to stabilize at room temperature (RT, 10 min) before a two 10 min wash with 1x PBS with gentle shaking at RT. The gels are incubated for 10 min in 0.15 M glycine. Followed by a 10 min wash of the gels with 1x PBS with gentle shaking.Note: This step quenches any auto-fluorescence and/or fluorescence due to formaldehyde.Permeabilization: The 3D gels are exposed to 0.05% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT with gentle shaking, allowing permeabilization of the cells. Permeabilization is followed by two 10 min washes with 1x PBS with gentle shaking.Note: The gels should be completely submerged in the solutions. In an 8-chamber slide, 350-400 µl volume is required, or as observed.",
    "Blocking: The cells were blocked for 1 h at RT (or 30 min in 37 °C incubator). 350 μl of blocking buffer (see Recipes) is added to the chamber with 3D gel. If blocking at 37 °C the chamber slide should be kept in a moist chamber. Shaking is optional.Note: For blocking step use normal serum of the animal in which the secondary antibody is made. We use NGS (normal goat serum) as our secondary antibodies are made in goat. Moist chamber: we use wet paper towels in a Petri plate and place the chamber slide on it. If blocking was carried out at 37 °C, let the chamber slide cool down to room temperature (5 min at RT). Blocking buffer should be removed before incubation with primary antibody.Primary antibody: The gels are exposed to smooth muscle specific (SMC) α-actin antibody at 1:100 dilution (final concentration of 0.02 µg/ml). The primary antibody is made in dilution buffer (see Recipes) and gels are incubated for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C in a moist chamber. Gentle shaking is optional.Note: The primary diluting buffer is very similar to blocking buffer hence no wash in between. The gels should be completely submerged in buffer containing primary antibody.Wash: Three washes of 10 min each in 1x PBS with gentle shaking.Note: All steps after this wash are done under low light conditions.Secondary antibody: The gels are incubated in Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody at a concentration of 1 µg/ml dilution buffer, for 40 min at RT. With gentle shaking. Note: The secondary antibody is diluted and added to the chambers under low light conditions. The gels are washed twice in 1x PBS for 10 min each with gentle shaking.Individual gels are removed from the chamber and placed on slides.",
    "Take a fresh slide and use flat tipped forceps to gently remove the gel from the chamber. Use one gel per slide. Discard the chamber slide as it is no longer sterile.Note: As the collagen gels contract due to growth and contractile nature of the myometrium cells (smooth muscle cells), the gel size may reduce from a height of 5 mm to < 2 mm after the end of 4 weeks of growth (Figures 3A and 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161011/20161011033102_9820.jpgFigure 3. Contraction of 3D matrix due to myometrial cell growth. A. Depiction of myometrial cell 3D culture in a single chamber of 8-chamber slide. The area in red represents the collagen gel containing myometrial cells. After 4 weeks of growth the gel contracts to one third or less of original gel. B. Myometrial cell 3D culture grown in 12-well cell culture plate demonstrate a difference in overall size in 1 week old 3D culture compared to 90-100% confluent 5-week old 3D culture on the right. The cultures were transferred to 6-well cell culture plate for better visualization of the difference in size.Extra solution is wicked using lint-free Kimwipes. Note: The gel should not be too wet. If Kimwipe is gently touched to the corner of the gel it tends to soak up and remove all the extra solution. The gel should not be placed on the Kimwipe as it dries up quickly and it becomes difficult to separate the gel from the wipe.Whole gel mount: One to two drops of Prolong Gold mounting media with DAPI is added on the gel. The gels are pressed down gently using a coverslip. Extra gel mount is wiped off and the slide allowed to dry overnight. Images are collected using the laser scanning confocal microscope."
