    "The present protocol was approved by the local ethics committee on animal experiments and by the Institutional Committee on Animal Welfare (APAFIS#30483-2021031811339219 v1, Animals Ethics Committee of the University of Paris Saclay, France). Animals were treated in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals developed by the National Institute of Health and with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care developed by the National Society for Medical Research.\nNOTE: Surgical procedures were performed under strict sterility using the same techniques used for a human being. Experimental procedures included large white piglets (45-60 kg) and were performed under general anesthesia.\n1. Animal conditioning and anesthesia protocol\nAllow the animals to acclimate for 7 days, with congeners and environmental enrichment, to ensure animal welfare.\nDo not feed the animals 12 h before their inclusion in the experimental protocol.\nPerform a premedication 30 min before the procedure with an intramuscular injection of an equimolar mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (10 mg/kg) in the neck muscles.\nOnce the animal is sedated, insert a catheter into the ear vein, and induce general anesthesia with an intravenous bolus of propofol (2 mg/kg) combined with administration of atracurium (2 mg/kg).\nIntubate the animal with a 7.5 mm orotracheal probe.\nMonitor the animal with continuous EKG, expiratory CO2, and oximetry.\nMaintain general anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane (2%) mixed with 40% oxygen supplement.\n2. In situ hemodynamic and echocardiographic assessment of the heart\nNOTE: Hemodynamic assessment is performed with a Swan Ganz Catheter, while baseline functional assessment of the heart is performed by transthoracic echocardiography.\nInsert percutaneously an 8 French (Fr) sheath into the brachiocephalic venous trunk using the Seldinger technique8.",
    "After de-airing the catheter and setting the 0 pressure, insert the Swan Ganz catheter into the 8 Fr sheath until a pulmonary pressure profile is observed on the monitoring screen.\nObtain the pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure by pushing the Sawn-Ganz catheter in the pulmonary circulation while the balloon is inflated.\nAssess the cardiac output using the thermodilution approach by infusion of 10 mL of cold (4 °C) saline solution in the proximal line of the Swan Ganz catheter. Repeat the measurement three times.\nAssess the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) using the biplane Simpson technique9.\nExplore the aortic valve and aortic root to identify any structural disorder or aortic regurgitation above grade 2 that could compromise ex situ perfusion of the heart through the ascending aorta (Figure 1).\n3. Description and priming of the normothermic ex situ perfusion (NESP) machine\nNOTE: A modified NESP module is used to alternatively perform Langendorff perfusion and working mode perfusion. Briefly, connect the aortic line of the circuit to a compliance chamber via a Y-connector. Add a pediatric oxygenator and a cardiotomy reservoir (70-80 cm height above the aortic connector of the module) to provide a left ventricle afterload of approximately 70 mmHg during the working mode. Connect another cardiotomy reservoir (7-10 cm height above the aortic connector of the module) to the main inflow line using a Y-connector to provide a left atrium preload of approximately 10 mmHg during the working mode (Figure 2). Coronary flow is assessed with a flow sensor connected to the pulmonary cannula. A centrifugal pump, a membrane oxygenator, and a heater-cooler machine are connected to the circuit (Figure 2). For solution descriptions, refer to Table 1.\nPrime the perfusion circuit with the priming solution (Table 1).\nSet the pump output at 1500 mL/min.",
    "Add the blood retrieved from the donor pig (1200-1500 mL) in the circuit.\nSet the gas mixer to achieve an oxygen partial pressure >250 mmHg.\nConnect maintenance solution and adrenaline solution (Table 1) to the circuit and set the initial output respectively at 5 mL/h and 0.1 mL/h.\nSet the temperature of the perfusate at room temperature (RT) before placement of the heart in the perfusion module.\nDuring working mode, connect a syringe of dobutamine with a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL (output between 0.04-0.12 mg/h).\n4. Heart procurement and instrumentation for normothermic ex situ heart perfusion\nHeart procurement\n\t\nPlace the animal in the supine position and continue to maintain general anesthesia.\nPerform a median sternotomy and open the pericardium.\nSuspend the pericardium with four stay sutures.\nPlace 4-0 polypropylene sutures on the right atrium and on the ascending aorta to secure cannulations with tourniquets.\nAfter heparin infusion (300 UI/kg) and careful dissection of the aortic root, insert a double-staged venous cannula in the right atrium for blood collection and a single-lumen cannula in the ascending aorta for cardioplegia infusion.\nIsolate the superior and the inferior vena cava with Silastic tourniquets.\nConnect the venous cannula to a blood collecting bag containing 10,000 IU of unfractionated heparin.\nPlace the piglet body in the Trendelenburg position to improve blood drainage into the collecting bag.\nAfter blood collection is completed, cross-clamp the ascending aorta, infuse Del Nido cardioplegia in the aortic root (Table 1), and check that the ascending aorta is under pressure (no aortic regurgitation).\nUnload the right and left atrium by opening the inferior vena cava and right pulmonary vein, respectively, while the superior vena cava is clamped by a tourniquet.\nOnce cardioplegia infusion is completed, ligate the left hemiazygos vein with two stiches of 4-0 polypropylene.",
    "Proceed to heart procurement, keeping 2 cm of the pulmonary trunk along with the left atrium posterior wall.\nVerify that there is no patent foramen ovale by inspecting the atrial septum and close it if necessary using 4-0 polypropylene sutures.\nInstrumentation of the heart before NESP\n\t\nPlace the heart in a 4 °C saline solution and separate the ascending aorta from the pulmonary trunk. Verify that the aortic valve and the coronary ostia are not injured.\nInsert four pledgeted stitches (4-0 polypropylene) 5 mm below the distal section of the ascending aorta and insert the infusion cannula into the aorta. Tight a hose clamp around the aorta to secure the cannula.\nInsert a drainage cannula into the pulmonary trunk and secure with a 3-0 polypropylene running suture.\nClose the inferior and superior vena cava with 5-0 polypropylene running sutures.\nClose the left atrium posterior wall with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture.\nInsert a left vent cannula through the posterior wall of the left atrium wall and snare a tourniquet around.\nInsert a preload cannula into the left atrial appendage and snare a tourniquet around.\n5. Connection to the NESP machine and resuscitation of the heart\nNOTE: Before instrumentation of the heart, ensure that the materials necessary for resuscitation are available next to the perfusion circuit, especially a defibrillator with internal probes and an external pacemaker with epicardial electrodes. Ensure that the pressure line is connected to the aortic line, and that output sensor is placed on the coronary flow line. The afterload line must be clamped, as well as the preload line of the working mode circuit.\nDecrease the pump flow to 200 mL/min.",
    "Connect the heart to the aortic connector after de-airing the connector. Ensure that the heart is appropriately connected to the perfusion module so that the inferior ventricular walls and left and right atrium are in front of the operator. Avoid twisting the ascending aorta to prevent aortic regurgitation.\nAdjust the aortic pressure to 30 mmHg at RT.\nDuring resuscitation, perform a smooth cardiac massage until a sinus rhythm is restored.\nSlowly increase the pump flow within 15-25 min by steps of 50 mL/min to achieve an aortic pressure of 65 mmHg. At the same time, increase the perfusate temperature by steps of 2-4 °C to reach 37 °C.\nOnce the aortic pressure is at 65 mmHg, and perfusate temperature is at 37 °C, deliver an electric shock at 5 J if needed, and repeat until the sinus rhythm is restored.\nSecure an epicardial electrode on the right ventricular posterior wall and connect to an external pacemaker. Pace the heart at 80 BPM to overdrive spontaneous rhythm.\nConnect the pulmonary cannula to the coronary flow line.\nPerform arterial and venous blood samples for gas and biochemical analyses of the perfusate. Record the initial lactate concentration and correct biochemical disorders to achieve the following objectives: glucose >1 g/L, K+ 3.5-5.5 mmol/L, Ca2+ 1.0-1.20 mmol/L, pH 7.35-7.45, Na+ 135-145 mmol/L, and HCO3- 20-24 mmol/L.\nAdjust pump flow to reach a mean aortic pressure of 65-75 mmHg and coronary flow of 650-850 mL/min.",
    "Perform arteriovenous blood gas analysis every 15 min to ensure that myocardial extraction of lactate is effective. If venous lactate is higher than arterial lactate, then increase mean aortic pressure to 80 mmHg by decreasing maintenance solution, and check the lactate concentration 15 min after. If arteriovenous lactate clearance is still impaired, then increase coronary flow to >850 mL and check lactate concentration 15 min later.\n6. Working mode procedure\nNOTE: Efficient arteriovenous clearance of lactate is usually achieved within 30 min after initiation of Langendorff perfusion. Working mode can then be initiated by connecting the preload cannula to the preload reservoir (this line was previously clamped during Langendorff mode). Similarly, the afterload line is connected to the aortic line (Figure 2). Set the flow sensor on the afterload line to measure cardiac output.\nOpen the preload line and adjust the pump flow to ensure stable filling of the preload reservoir. During this period, the left atrium and the left ventricle are progressively filled with blood.\nOpen the aortic afterload line and clamp the main line of the circuit used for Langendorff perfusion. The afterload reservoir is progressively filled-up. Ensure the drainage of the reservoir by an overflow line which brings the perfusate back to the main reservoir of the circuit.\nInitiate the infusion of dobutamine at 0.04 mg/min.\nPerform arterial and venous blood gas sample analysis to ensure that the myocardial extraction of lactate is still effective.\nOnce the cardiac output is stable, perform invasive hemodynamic assessment along with epicardial ultrasound measurements.\n7. Pressure-volume (PV) loop assessment with the conductance method\nNOTE: All calibration steps must be performed in working mode.\nPV catheter placement into the left ventricle\n\t\nClean the 7 Fr pigtail conductance catheter with saline solution and connect it to the hardware interface.",
    "Gently push the catheter into the introducer 8 Fr sheath previously inserted through the left atrium roof to be aligned with the mitral valve.\nAs soon as the catheter crosses the mitral valve, adjust the appropriate position, considering optimal pressure and volume signals. If there is too much noise, gently move the conductance catheter to improve the quality of the loops.\nPV loop catheter calibration\n\t\nPressure calibration\n\t\t\nOnce the conductance catheter is appropriately located in the left ventricle, open the calibration interface on the software and calibrate the pressure value using acquisition software for conductance measurements.\nStart recording, select 0 mmHg pressure and 100 mmHg on the control interface, and record for 5 s each.\nThen, stop recording and open the pressure calibration interface. Match the corresponding signal to the pressure level.\nOnce calibrated, verify that the signal matches the values obtained by invasive blood pressure monitoring.\nVolume calibration\n\t\t\nConductance calibration\n\t\t\t\nOpen the control interface on the software for conductance measurements.\nStart recording, one after the other, select the volumes suggested by the calibration interface.\nLet the interface record for 5 s each, then stop recording.\nUse the data-trace obtained and open the volume calibration interface.\nMatch the corresponding trace to the pressure level.\nParallel volume calibration\n\t\t\t\nSurrounding heart tissue conducts electricity and contributes to the overall volume signal. Remove this parallel volume for accurate volume measurement (post-processing calibration).\nTo assess parallel volume in this setup (myocardial wall), inject 10 cc of hypertonic saline solution (4%) into the left atrium line once.\nDo not repeat the operation to avoid hypernatremia.\nField correction factor calibration\n\t\nEnter the stroke volume value obtained from the ultrasound measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: Factor alpha will be calculated considering the ratio of stroke volumes obtained either by ultrasound measurements or conductance catheterization.\nPV data collection",
    "Stop epicardial pacing of the heart to avoid interference with the conductance signal. Record data in a steady state when the signal is stabilized (Figure 3)\nSelect a series of 10 consecutive loops and open the analysis software. The software will automatically provide stroke work, pre-recruitable stroke work, maximum dP/dt, minimum dP/dt, and tau index.\nTo obtain the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, record the signal during preload occlusion. Gradually clamp the atrial perfusion line until preload reduction is effective (Figure 4). Then slowly release the clamp.\n8. Epicardial echocardiography assessment of the heart in a working state\nAcquisition of ultrasound loops\n\t\nPlace three EKG epicardial electrodes connected to the echocardiogram machine.\nApply a sterile drape around the heart and use a transesophagus probe.\nApply the probe to the upper wall of the left atrium and manually rotate the transducer until a four-chamber view is obtained (Figure 5).\nStart the echocardiographic acquisition software for myocardial performance assessment using the X-plan mode.\nThen, run the ultrasound probe motor to obtain three and two-chamber views. Analysis of these views allows for measurement of left ventricle ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain9.\nAssessment of myocardial work index (MWI)\n\t\nProceed to the acquisition of four-, three-, and two-chamber views and record simultaneous arterial pressure (Figure 6).\nAssess the global longitudinal strain using these views and open MWI software. Use the invasive blood pressure detected by the external sensor on the perfusion circuit during loop acquisition.\nManually notify the software of the exact opening and closing timing of the aortic and mitral valves.\n\t\tNOTE: MWI software will automatically provide global MWI, constructive work, wasted work, and effective work.\nSubscription Required.
