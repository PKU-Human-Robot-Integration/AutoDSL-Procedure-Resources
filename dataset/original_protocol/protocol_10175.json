    "All stem cell and animal procedures were approved by Stanford's Stem Cell Research Oversight committee and by Stanford University's Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (SCRO-616 and APLAC-31909).\n1. Etching of ITO Glass\nPrepare the indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass slide by placing a masking agent over the conductive side of the glass.\n\tNOTE: Most commercial transparent tapes can be used as a masking agent.\n\t\nRemove the excess mask using a blade, leaving only the desired shape of the final ITO design covered on the glass.\nCombine 5% (v/v) of nitric acid and 45% (v/v) of HCl in a glass beaker inside a fume hood to prepare the etching solution.\n\t\nUse a hot plate and a thermometer to ensure that the temperature of etching solution is maintained at 70 °C.\nOnce the etching solution reaches 70 °C, place the masked-ITO glass slide into the solution for 2 minutes to remove the excess ITO layer.\n\tNOTE: Tape masking protects the ITO layer from the exposure to acid solution.\nRemove the slide from the solution and rinse it with deionized (DI) H2O.\nCarefully remove the mask and measure resistance using a multimeter to ensure that the remaining ITO is intact. Readouts of the desired etched area should be approximately 0 Ω.\n2. Preparation of Pyrrole Solution\nIn a 1000 mL glass bottle, dissolve 70 g of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (NaDBS) in 600 mL of DI H2O.\nOnce the NaDBS is dissolved, add 14 mL of 0.2 M pyrrole and 386 mL of DI H2O to the solution.\nCover the solution with aluminum foil and store at 4 °C.\n3. Electroplating of Polypyrrole on ITO glass\nWarm the pyrrole solution to room temperature until NaDBS is fully redissolved.\n\tNOTE: This takes about 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "Pour 25 mL of the pyrrole solution into a beaker.\nConnect the etched ITO glass to a multimeter and submerge the slide into the pyrrole solution.\n\t\nEnsure that the side with 0 Ω resistance is facing towards the platinum mesh reference electrode.\nApply an electrical current to initiate electroplating of PPy on the ITO surface using a multimeter (current controlled at 3 mA/cm2 for 4 hours).\nRemove the ITO glass from the multimeter and wash electroplated-PPy in DI H2O to remove residual surfactant.\nGently detach the electroplated-PPy plate from the ITO glass using a razor blade.\n\t\nStore the PPy plate at room temperature.\n4. Preparation of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)\nUsing a spatula and a weigh dish, mix 18 g of base agent with 2 g of curing agent and pour the mixture into two 10 cm x 8 cm glass molds.\nRemove the bubbles from the molds using a vacuum chamber for 15 - 20 minutes.\nPlace the molds in a 70 °C oven for 3 h.\nOnce cooled, use a flat spatula to remove the PDMS from the molds.\n5. Fabrication of the In Vitro Electrical Stimulation Chamber\nAutoclave the metal plates (WxL, 2.5 cm x 12.5 cm) and flow valves at 120 °C for 1 hour.\nUsing a chamber slide as a template, cut two pieces of PDMS.\n\tNOTE: One piece of PDMS serves as the perimeter of the cell chamber with cutouts of two adjoining squares from within the cell chamber. The other PDMS piece is an outline of the chamber's perimeter.\n\t\nCut out the inside cell chamber so that it is square shaped and matches the shape of the cell chamber. Ensure that the overall shape of both pieces of PDMS is rectangular and matches that of the chamber slide.",
    "Layer the materials as following from bottom to top: (1) Metal plate, (2) PDMS (without cutouts), (3) PPy plate (perpendicular to PDMS), (4) PDMS (with cutouts), and (5) cell chamber.\nClamp the apparatus together once it is fully aligned.\nCut two 60 cm pieces of a metal wire and use silver paste to attach one wire to each end of the PPy plate that protrudes from the outside of the chamber. Ensure that the wires are long enough to extend from the apparatus to the outside of an incubator.\nOnce the silver paste is cured, reinforce and seal the wire connection with epoxy.\n\t\nRecord the resistance using a multimeter to make sure that the applied field is the same in each chamber.\nFor implantation, remove the wires; unclamp the cell chambers and PDMS and then them separate from the conductive scaffold. The dimension of the implanted scaffolds is approximately 1 mm x 3 mm x 0.25 mm.\n6. Plating human Neural Progenitor Cells (hNPCs) on PPy\nSterilize the assembled chambers under UV light for 2 hours.\n\t\nAfter 1 hour, rotate the assembled chambers 90°.\nAfter sterilization, coat the surface of PPy at the bottom of the chamber with 800 µL of a coating substrate and allow the substrate to solidify on the PPy plate in an incubator at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nAfter 1 hour, remove the supernatant from chambers and gently rinse with 1 mL of DPBS +Ca +Mg per well.\n\tNOTE: Avoid washing the surface of PPy forcefully as this will cause the detachment of the coating substrate.\nUsing fresh cell media, mechanically dissociate cultured cells for use with the chambers from a tissue culture plate with gentle pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Cells should be 90 - 100% confluent upon dissociation.",
    "Collect hNPC pellets using centrifugation at 8000 x g for 5 minutes.\nUsing a hemocytometer, count and resuspend the cells at a volume of 100,000 cells/cm2.\nPlate 100,000 cells into each chamber well (100,000 cells/cm2 in 1 mL of media).\nReturn chambers to incubator at 37 °C at 5% CO2.\n7. Electrical Stimulation of hNPCs\nOne day after seeding the cells on the chambers, use a waveform generator to apply electrical stimulation to the cells.\nPrior to stimulation, remove old media from each chamber well and replenish with 800 µL of fresh media.\nAfter the media is changed, place the chambers back into the incubator, extend the wires out of the incubator, and attach them to a waveform generator\nApply the stimulation to the cells with a square wave signal at ±400 mV with 100 Hz for 1 h.\nAfter the stimulation, remove the wires and incubate the chambers for another day in an incubator set at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nPerform subsequent biological analysis including cell viability and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n8. In Vivo PPy Implantation\nPerform distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) occlusion stroke models on T cell-deficient adult male nude rats (NIH-RNU 230 ± 30 g) as described previously2. Perform implantation one week post-dMCA occlusion.\nOne day prior to surgery, give ampicillin (1 mg/mL) to the rats in their cage water.\nAnesthetize the rat in an induction chamber using 0.5 - 3% mg/kg of isoflurane administered via inhalation.\nConfirm anesthetization of the rat by a lack of toe pinch reflex response.\n\t\nWhile the animal is under anesthesia, continue to monitor its membrane color, breathing pattern, and rectal temperature every 15 minutes.\nOnce anesthetization is confirmed, apply artificial tears on eyes of rat to prevent dryness.",
    "Ensure that aseptic technique is maintained during this procedure by using sterile gloves, and a sterile surgical drape13. Keep sterile surgical instruments within a sterile field.\nWhile the rat is under anesthesia, drill a craniectomy above the left cortex. Open the dura.\n\t\nRemove the dura mater from the brain using a micro-thin surgical needle.\nImplant the conductive scaffolds from in vitro system onto the rat cortex.\n\tNOTE: For our experiments, we implanted scaffolds from in vitro day 3 after hNPC plating.\n\t\nPlace the implant primarily on the penumbral cortex medial to the stroke lesion.\nAfter the scaffold is placed, place surgicel over the implant to prevent movement with skin closure.\nSuture the wound shut and subcutaneously inject the rats with buprenorphine SR at a dosage of 1 mg/kg to manage the pain associated with stereotaxic surgery and dMCA occlusion.\nPlace the rat in a recovery cage as it regains consciousness.\n\t\nNever leave the animal unattended while it is unconscious.\nDo not place the animal with others until it has fully gained consciousness.\nMonitor animals daily for signs of pain including body weight loss, decreased food/water intake, reduced grooming/unkempt coat, decreased/increased spontaneous activity, abnormal posture, dehydration/skin tenting, sunken eyes, hiding, self-mutilation, rapid breathing, open mouthed breathing, twitching, trembling, tremor, and vocalization.\n\t\nMonitor the animals daily until it appears that they are eating, drinking, grooming, and gaining weight; and then weekly after weight gain.\nEarly euthanization via CO2 inhalation and a secondary confirmation of euthanization (as to ensure the animal will not revive due to normal oxygen supply post CO2 inhalation) will occur to   any animal that appears to be not eating, drinking and gaining weight after the initial surgical procedure; appears in pain; or appears unable to complete the behavioral tests due to a larger than expected motor cortex deficit.",
