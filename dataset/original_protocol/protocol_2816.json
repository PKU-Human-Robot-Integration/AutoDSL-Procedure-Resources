Unlike adult mice given Tamoxifen for 7 days, we decided to do a single-day administration of Tamoxifen on neonatal mice to minimize maternal cannibalization.\nIntraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of Tamoxifen on adult mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2518-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Administration of Tamoxifen solution to adult and neonatal mice\n(A) Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration on adult mice.\n(B) Per orem (p.o.) administration on neonatal mice.\n(C) Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration on neonatal mice.\nOn day 0, place adult (P42) mouse on metal grid and grab loose skin at the back of the neck between your thumb and forefinger.\nHold tail with little and ring finger.\nPerform injection of a single dose of 1 mg Tamoxifen.\nAim for the lower right abdomen with the needle directed towards the thorax in a 30°–40° angle to minimize risk of puncturing intestinal organs.\nPerforate skin and slowly aspirate.\nIf there is no aspirated liquid (i.e., blood or green liquid), administer Tamoxifen solution.\nNote: Insulin syringe is preferred (e.g., BD Insulin Syringe, NK, USA), as these diameters are less likely to perforate intestinal organs and hurt the mouse, compared to larger needles.\nRepeat steps a.-b. for day 1–7 of Tamoxifen induction on adult mice.\nPer orem (p.o.) administration of Tamoxifen on neonatal mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nOn day 0, collect entire litter of neonatal (P0) mice and place in a separate cage.\nGently grab a neonatal mouse at the back of the neck and visualize the animal’s mouth.\nUsing a pipettor, get 8–10 μL of Tamoxifen equivalent to a single 0.8–1 mg dose.",
    "Position the pipette tip in the animal’s mouth and slowly administer the Tamoxifen solution.\nNote: Give the neonatal mouse time to swallow the solution and hold the animal upright to ensure ingestion of the Tamoxifen.\nPut the neonatal mouse in an extra cage to allow recovery until other neonatal mice are given Tamoxifen.\nRelocate all neonatal mice (i.e., entire litter) to their original cage after induction.\nSubcutaneous (s.c.) administration of Tamoxifen on neonatal mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nOn day 0, collect entire litter of neonatal (P0) mice and place in a separate cage.\nGently put your thumb and forefinger to the middle of the thoracic spine to immobilize the animal.\nPerform injection of a single dose of 1 mg Tamoxifen.\nAim for the skin at the back of the neck with the needle directed towards the tail in a 20°–30° angle.\nPerforate skin and slowly administer Tamoxifen solution.\nPut the neonatal mouse in an extra cage to allow recovery until other neonatal mice are given Tamoxifen.\nRelocate all mice to their original cage after induction.\nECG recording of adult and neonatal mice\nTiming: 10 min/mouse\nIn this step, we show how to perform electrocardiography (ECG) on adult and neonatal mice to check for the effect of AVCS cellular ablation after Tamoxifen induction.\nAnesthetize mice for ECG with 2% isoflurane in 2.0 L/min O2.\nAdult anesthesia:\nPlace adult mouse in anesthesia chamber.\nOnce anesthetized, place the animal at the mouse pad and hook to rodent facemask.\nNeonatal anesthesia:\nPlace neonatal mouse in the mouse pad.\nHook animal directly to rodent facemask.\nNote: Assess depth of anesthesia by checking loss of righting reflex or response to pain stimulation (e.g., toe pinch).\nPlace subcutaneous ECG electrodes in the conventional lead II position (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2518-Fig4.jpg",

Electrocardiography (ECG) conventional lead II placement in neonatal and adult mice\n(A) Schematic of conventional lead II placement of ECG electrodes.\n(B) Actual conventional lead II placement of ECG electrodes in neonatal mouse.\n(C) Actual conventional lead II placement of ECG electrodes in adult mouse.\nPlace positive (red) electrode at the left forelimb.\nPlace negative (black) electrode at the right forelimb.\nPlace reference (green) electrode at the left hindlimb.\nNote: Clean mouse limbs and ECG electrodes with alcohol pads before inserting them into the mouse.\nOnce ECG electrodes are in place, click start at the LabChart 8 program to record the animal’s ECG.\nRecord ECG for at least one to one-and-a-half minutes.\nRemove ECG electrodes once recording is finished and return the animal to its cage.\nRepeat on subsequent days as necessary.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2518_10.csv\nNote: Minimize the influence of isoflurane on the heart rate by doing the following: (1) Minimize isoflurane induction time (neonatal mice induction time is longer compared to adult mice); (2) Calculate ECG measurements (i.e., PR interval, QRS interval, etc.) on the first 30 s of an ECG tracing.\nOptional: Since mice PR interval shortens as they grow, perform ECG on normal mice of different ages (e.g., P7, P14, p21, p28) to determine normal PR interval values for each age group. Normal PR interval range was set as Mean ± 2 Standard Deviation in Wang et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\nPharmacological challenge post-Tamoxifen induction\nTiming: 10 min/mouse\nIn this step, we describe how to perform pharmacological studies using Atropine and Isoproterenol injection to further check the effect of AVCS cellular ablation after Tamoxifen induction.\nFreshly prepare pharmacological agents, i.e., Atropine and Isoproterenol.",
    "After recording ECG for 1 min, perform IP injection of pharmacological agents at a dose of 2 μg/g or 50 ng/g of Atropine or Isoproterenol, respectively.\nContinue recording the animal’s ECG for 5 min following drug administration.\nMice preparation for heart removal\nTiming: 30 min\nIn the following steps, we show how to collect and process mice hearts for immunohistological staining and analysis.\nPlace mice in an empty cage and slowly fill with CO2 at 3L/min.\nWait until euthanasia is complete (i.e., no more breathing can be observed).\nPerform cervical dislocation as secondary method of euthanasia.\nPlace euthanized mice in a clean dissection pad.\nCut the chest open and expose the chest cavity.\nCut the major blood vessels connecting the heart to the cardiac base.\nPlace harvested heart in cold 1× PBS.\nGently pump the harvested heart with forceps to remove excess blood.\nPreparation and X-Gal staining of mouse heart for paraffin block and sliced sections\nTiming: 2–3 days\nFix the harvested heart in 0.2% glutaraldehyde for one (1) hour at 4°C.\nWash with washing buffer for 10 min twice.\nIncubate and shake the harvested heart in X-gal staining buffer at room temperature (20°C–22°C) overnight (12–16 h), covered with foil.\nPost-fix the harvested heart in neutral formalin overnight (12–16 h) for paraffin embedding.\nCritical: (Para-)Formaldehyde solution is a harmful material for humans. Handling (para-)formaldehyde solution should be done inside a chemical fume hood and wearing protective gear such as glasses, lab coat, and gloves.\nPlace the harvested heart in a mold in the appropriate orientation.\nEmbed harvested heart in paraffin.\nPause point: Paraffin blocks can be stored at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for years.\nSection the mouse heart paraffin block in a posterior to anterior (PA) direction.\nCollect sections where mitral valve and tricuspid valve are present.",
