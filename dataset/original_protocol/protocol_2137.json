    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare vector\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis section describes steps to construct the MitoT expression vector. The vector is universal and should be readily transferable between mammalian cell lines.\nDay 1: Cell harvesting, RNA isolation, and cDNA preparation\nTiming: 2 h for step 1\nTiming: 1 h for step 2\nCell harvesting and RNA isolation.\nHarvest 5 million cells/sample as per standard cell harvesting protocol.\nCritical: Prior to starting RNA isolation, clean workbench, pipettes, and vial stands with RNaseZap reagent. Use RNase-free polypropylene tips and vials.\nAdd TRIzol reagent to the cell pellet (1 mL per 5 × 106 cells).\nNote: The volume of TRIzol reagent depends on the cell number. Refer to product manual to determine appropriate TRIzol volume according to cell number.\nHomogenize cells by vigorous pipetting 10 times.\nNote: RNA is stable in TRIzol reagent. Therefore, samples can be stored at this step at −20°C for further use.\nAdd 0.2 mL chloroform to the homogenized cell suspension.\nNote: Handle chloroform under fume hood and use polypropylene tips or glass pipette for aspiration.\nShake tube vigorously or vortex for 15 s and incubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 2–3 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the upper, colorless aqueous phase into a separate vial.\nCritical: Be very careful when removing the upper layer; do not aspirate or disturb the middle white ring-like layer. Approximately 400 μL of aqueous phase can be easily aspirated out. Use a 200-μL pipette instead of a 1-mL pipette to minimize the chances of middle layer aspiration.\nAdd 280 μL (70% volume of the aspirated aqueous phase) of isopropanol, and mix by gently inverting the tube. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.",
    "Carefully remove the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 1 mL of 75% ethanol (room temperature- 20°C–22°C) by centrifuging at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Pellet is usually not readily visible and loosely attached to tube’s wall. About 20–30 μL of supernatant can be left to prevent the loss of RNA pellet during aspiration.\nAfter the final ethanol washing step, remove supernatant completely.\nAir dry the pellet for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nNote: Repeatedly monitor the evaporation of ethanol. As soon as the pellet is dry, proceed to the next step.\nCritical: Over-drying of RNA pellet will reduce RNA solubility and thus the overall yield.\nDissolve RNA in 30 μL of RNase-free water by gentle pipetting and incubate for 5 min at 55°C.\nAlternatives: Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water can be used if commercial RNase-free water is not available.\nDetermine RNA concentration and quality using nanodrop or UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths.\nNote: A good quality RNA prep has a λ260/280 ratio of ∼2.0.\nAlternatives: RNA quality and integrity can be checked by separating the RNA of interest in a denaturing agarose gel.\nCritical: Following resuspension in water, RNA becomes highly prone to degradation by RNase. From this step onwards, keep RNA on ice and avoid multiple freeze-thawing cycles. For long term storage, store the samples at −80°C.\nNote: If possible, try to prepare cDNA on the same day as RNA isolation to minimize freezing and thawing of RNA samples.\ncDNA preparation. Use SuperscriptTM IV (SSIV) first-strand cDNA synthesis system for cDNA synthesis.\nNote: Preset PCR machine at 65°C before starting the experiment.\nNote: Keep all the PCR tubes and reagents on ice.",
    "Prepare RNA-primer mix by adding 100 ng-2 μg RNA, 1 μL of Oligo-DT primer and 1 μL of dNTPs mix.\nAdjust the final volume to 11 μL by adding RNase-free water.\nMix and briefly centrifuge the mixture.\nIncubate for 5 min at 65°C and keep on ice for 1 min immediately after.\nNote: Before proceeding to the next step, vortex and briefly centrifuge 5× SSIV reverse transcriptase buffer and heat PCR machine to 50°C. Also heat a water bath or heat block to 80°C.\nPrepare reverse transcriptase mix by adding 4 μL of 5× SSIV buffer, 1 μL 100 mM DTT, 1 μL of ribonuclease inhibitor, and 1 μL of SSIV reverse transcriptase enzyme.\nCritical: DTT is a toxic chemical and needs to be handled with caution. It gets oxidized easily in the presence of air and is unstable at room temperature (20°C–22°C). It should be stored at −20°C in small aliquots.\nAdd freshly prepared reverse transcriptase mix to RNA-primer mix.\nIncubate combined reaction mixture for 10 min at 50°C.\nHeat-inactive the reverse transcriptase by incubating for 10 min at 80°C.\nAdd 2 units of RNase H and incubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nNote: Produced cDNA is stable and can be stored at −20°C for future use.\nDay 2–3: Amplification and cloning of MitoT fragment into pcDNA3-eGFP vector\nTiming: 1 day for step 3\nTiming: 1 day for step 4\nTiming: 1 day for step 5\nPCR amplification and digestion of MitoT fragment. Take 5 μM of each primer pair, prepare PCR master-mix, and perform overlap extension PCR as follows (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Design and cloning of MitoT construct",
    "(A) Relevant indicated fragments of the IM-resident SCO1 and OM-residing TOMM20 proteins were amplified individually by overlap extension PCR strategy. In the second round of PCR amplifications, the respective amplicons were used to generate a single recombinant DNA fragment (MitoT) containing indicated portions of SCO1, TOMM20, a hexa-histidine tag, an unstructured linker region (E. coli LacI sequence), and BamH1 and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-flanking ends, respectively.\n(B) The MitoT DNA fragment generated by overlap extension PCR and its host pCDNA3-eGFP vector were digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes.

Use protective wear to protect eyes and body. Quickly make cuts around the amplified band and switch off the transilluminator.\nPurify the amplicon by following the gel extraction protocol as per kit manual.\nReaction 2:\nUse 10 ng of cDNA and the primers Fwd LacI-TOMM20 and Rev TOMM20-His-EcoRI.\nFollow the manufacturer’s protocol on using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with 68°C for the annealing temperature.",
    "Following PCR amplification, separate the samples on a 1.5% agarose gel.\nObserve relevant DNA bands under a transilluminator and excise the 115-bp fragment from the gel.\nPurify the amplicon by following the gel extraction protocol as per kit manual.\nReaction 3:\nUse an equal amount of the PCR products from the Reactions 1 and 2 and the primers Fwd BamH1-SCO1 and Rev TOMM20-His-EcoRI.\nNote: We suggest using 1 ng of each product for this reaction.\nFollow the manufacturer’s protocol on using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with 68°C for the annealing temperature.\nFollowing PCR amplification, separate the samples on a 1% agarose gel.\nObserve relevant DNA bands under a transilluminator and cut the 468-bp fragment from the gel. This final amplicon constitutes the complete MitoT DNA fragment.\nPurify the amplicon by following the gel extraction protocol as per kit manual.\nDigest the PCR product from Reaction 3 using BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes.\nPurify the digested fragment using the QIAquick gel extraction kit per manufacturer’s protocol.\nDetermine the purity and concentration of the purified MitoT DNA fragment using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nAmplification and digestion of pcDNA3-eGFP vector (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTransform E. coli DH5α competent cells with the pcDNA3-eGFP plasmid as per standard protocol.\nInoculate a single colony in 5 mL of LB media containing ampicillin and incubate for 8 h at 37°C.\nTake 100 μL of grown starter culture and inoculate in 100 mL of LB media containing ampicillin.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 5,000 g for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nIsolate the plasmid using a plasmid midi prep endotoxin-free kit per manufacturer’s instructions.\nQuantitate plasmid concentration using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nDigest the plasmid using BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes using standard NEB digestion protocol.",
    "Separate the digested plasmid on a 1% agarose gel, cut out the desired band, and purify it using a gel purification kit.\nDetermine the purity and concentration of the purified digested plasmid using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nLigation of the MitoT DNA fragment and digested pcDNA3-eGFP vector.\nSet up ligation reaction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1721_12.csv\nIncubate for 1 h in a thermal cycler at 16°C.\nAlternatives: The reaction can also be done by incubating the reaction mix overnight (∼12–16 h) at 4°C.\nAlternatives: The construct can be synthesized using other molecular biology approaches such as the Gibson assembly approach.\nTransform 5 μL of ligation mix into E. coli DH5α competent cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nSelect single colonies and inoculate in 5 mL LB containing ampicillin in a glass tube.\nFollowing 16 h incubation at 37°C, pellet the cells by centrifuging at 5,000 g for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C) and isolate plasmid for analysis.\nDigest isolated plasmid with EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes and electrophoretically separate the digest on a 1% agarose gel to confirm the presence of the MitoT insert (468-bp band).\nValidate the sequence of the MitoT construct by DNA sequencing (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Mmc1.pdf]; Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Mmc1.pdf]; Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Mmc1.pdf]).\nInoculate 5 mL of LB-Ampicillin medium with an E. coli clone harboring confirmed MitoT plasmid.\nAfter 8 h incubation at 37°C, measure the OD600 of the initial inoculum, and inoculate 100 μL in 100 mL LB medium containing ampicillin antibiotic.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 5,000 g for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nIsolate plasmid using a midiprep endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit per manufacturer’s instructions.\nDetermine the purity and concentration of isolated plasmid using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nCell culture, transfection, and FACS-based selection\nTiming: 9–10 days\nTiming: 9–10 days for step 6\nTiming: 2 h for step 7",
    "The following steps provide details about transfection of the pcDNA-MitoT-eGFP vector in MEF cells followed by antibiotic selection and FACS-based selection of GFP-expressing cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation and isolation of MitoT-expressing cells\nMouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with pCDNA3-MitoT-eGFP vector, cultured and harvested as explained in the text. Antibiotic-resistant cells were then profiled and processed by FACS. Importantly, FACS profiling revealed two distinct cell populations with low (GFPlo) and high (GFPhi) eGFP expression. Cells from the GFPlo group were confirmed to be the desired cell population and collected for further analyses.\nTransfection and selection.\nTwenty-four hours prior to transfection, seed 5 × 105 cells per well into 6-well plate or 35 mm dish.\nTransfect the cells with 1 μg of control vector pcDNA3-eGFP and pcDNA3-MitoT-eGFP plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent.\nChange the media after 16 h of transfection.\nAt 48 h post-transfection, start the selection of G418-resistant clones using 2 mg/mL of G418.\nNote: Before treatment, an individual effective concentration of G418 needs to be determined for every cell line used. It is essential to make a titration curve to identify the lowest concentration of antibiotic that kills 90% of wildtype cells within 3–5 days.\nKeep the cells under antibiotic pressure for at least 7 days, replacing the medium every 2 days.\nConfirm expression and establishment of a MitoT-expressing stable cell line by fluorescence microscopy or by western blotting using anti-GFP antibody.\nFACS sorting.\nHarvest the cells and make a cell suspension with approximately 5 × 106 cells per mL.\nNote: Use Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS to prevent the formation of cell aggregates.\nCritical: To decrease the aggregate formation and maintain cell viability, supplement PBS with 1% FBS, 5 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4.",
    "Sort the MitoT-GFP-positive cells using a 488-nm laser with a 530/30 bandpass filter.\nUse 100 μm nozzle size, 20 psi for fluid sheath pressure, and 6,000 events/sec maximum rate.\nUse non-transfected cells to determine proper threshold gate for eGFP-negative cells.\nSort the cells in 10% FBS-containing DMEM medium containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4.\nCritical: In our experiments using OMA1 knockout MEF cells transfected with pcDNA3-MitoT-eGFP, we observed two populations of GFP-expressing cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The population of brighter cells with eGFP intensity greater than 104 on the histogram (referred to as GFPhi) results from protein localization error. In these cells, most of the eGFP signal was in the cytoplasm. The population of cells with GFP intensity close to 103 (referred to as GFPlo) displayed eGFP co-localization with mitochondria. These values can vary among different cell types and FACS instruments. It is important to carefully analyze isolated cells under a fluorescence microscope to confirm proper subcellular localization of the eGFP signal.\nAfter sorting and validating the cells, centrifuge cells at 300 g for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C), remove the medium, and transfer the cells to the 10% FBS-containing DMEM medium and dish containing 2 mg/mL of G418.\nCritical: The cells must always be kept in G418 to ensure the retention of the MitoT-eGFP construct.\nClone selection\nTiming: 7–10 days\nThis section describes the process of stable clone generation of FACS-sorted GFP positive cells by antibiotic selection. This is a final step of clone selection by antibiotic treatment after FACS-sorting of the GFPlo MEF cell population (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). It is expected that under antibiotic selection pressure the surviving cells should harbor stably integrated MitoT-eGFP expression construct.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Selection of stable MitoT-expressing clones",
    "The selected cells were cultured under antibiotic selective conditions to produce stable clones of the MitoT-eGFP-expressing cells. The surviving clones were preserved and used in subsequent imaging studies.\nCulturing sorted cells.\nRe-seed the FACS-sorted cells in a 6-well plate.\nAdd 10% FBS-containing DMEM medium containing 2 mg/mL of active G418 antibiotic.\nChange the medium every other day with antibiotic selection.\nAfter 7 days culturing under the selective conditions, reconfirm plasmid retention by checking for the presence of eGFP signal under a fluorescence microscope.\nTrypsinize and re-seed surviving cells into a fresh 6-well plate.\nAllow cells to grow to 90% confluency.\nCryofreeze some of the cells for future use.\nSeed the cells into glass-bottom 35-mm dishes.\nLive cell imaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis section describes steps to prepare samples for fluorescence imaging. Set up a confocal fluorescence microscope according to the manufacturer’s instructions prior to sample preparation for imaging.\nLive cell imaging (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1721-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The maximum emission wavelength for Hoechst 33342 dye is 461 nm.\nNote: For live cell imaging, it is beneficial to use stage top CO2 incubator to minimize cell stress and to preserve proper mitochondrial morphology.\nNote: Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain is used here only to focus cells hence it is optional yet highly recommended. Pre-focusing the cells using Hoechst signal minimizes the GFP bleaching due to long exposure of laser. Observe eGFP signal using 488 nm solid state excitation laser and 500–550 nm bandpass emission filter. The maximum emission wavelength for eGFP protein is 509 nm.\nFor MitoTracker DeepRed imaging, use 640 nm solid state excitation laser and 633–673 nm emission filter. The maximum emission wavelength for MitoTracker DeepRed is 665 nm.\nCritical: If a stage-top incubator for CO2 control is not available, the medium must be supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging\nTiming: 4–5 days",
