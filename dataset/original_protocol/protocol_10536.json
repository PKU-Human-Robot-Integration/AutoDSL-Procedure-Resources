  "procedures": [
    "1. Culture of the Organotypic Tissue Bronchial Culture Model\nNote: Reconstituted tissue models were purchased as inserts that are ready to use. Alternatively, the culture could be developed from primary cells as described for example by Karp and colleagues16. Following receipt of tissues in sterile packaging, always handle the human organotypic tissues under sterile conditions.\nAdd 0.7 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) assay medium to each well of a new sterile 24-well plate under the hood.\nRemove the packaging of the tissues under the hood, and transfer the tissue culture inserts to the new prepared 24-well plate (described in step 1.1. above).\nMaintain and culture the tissues in an incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2, 90% humidity).\nReplace the medium every 2 days.\nDuring a medium change, examine the tissues under a light microscope to ensure they they are contamination-free and that there is no leakage of medium.\n2. Cigarette Smoke (CS) Exposure using an In Vitro Exposure System\nThree days prior to exposure experiments, wash the apical side of the tissue culture with 200 µl of culture medium.\nOn the day of exposure, if the measurement of ciliary beating is planned before exposure, handle the tissues for ciliary beating measurement as described in section 3.\nPre-warm the climatic chamber of the in vitro exposure system and the cultivation base module to 37 °C. Fill the cultivation base module with 17.5 ml of medium per row.\nRemove the tissues from the incubator and place them under the hood to transfer the tissue culture inserts from the culture plate to the cultivation base module of the in vitro exposure system. Additionally, cover the cultivation base module with a glass lid.\nTransfer the tissues in the climatic chamber of the in vitro exposure system for exposure to mainstream CS.",
    "If the in vitro exposure system is equipped with a microbalance, set-up the Quartz crystal microbalance before running the exposure to measure the real-time particle deposition of the smoke on a quartz crystal using the microbalance software.\n\t\nReplace the crystals in the microbalance modules connected to each row of the dilution/distribution system.\nConnect the microbalance module to the microbalance software. Set the scale of the measurement to zero in the software.\nExpose the tissues according to the experimental procedure (e.g., as in Figure 1)\n\tNote: Prior exposure, reference cigarettes (3R4F) are conditioned between 7 and 21 days under controlled conditions at 22 ± 1 °C and relative humidity of 60 ± 3% according to ISO standard 3402 17.\n\t\nGenerate cigarette smoke (e.g., from 3R4F cigarettes) using a 30-port carousel smoking machine according to the Health Canada Intense regime: smoke the cigarettes to a standard butt length, i.e., approximately 35 mm at 55 ml puff over 2 sec, twice a minute and 8 sec pump exhaust time.\n\t\tNote: If necessary, dilute the mainstream CS so that the dose is not too toxic. In results reported here, smoke was diluted to 16% (vol/vol).\nUse 60% humidified-air for the control samples (air-exposed).\nExpose the tissues for 6-7 min (i.e., 1 cigarette or air-exposed) in the in vitro exposure system\nPut the tissues back in the incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2, 90% humidity) for 1 hr.\nRepeat steps 2.7.3 and 2.7.4 three more times.\nAt the end of the exposure experiment, stop the microbalance software. The software will generate a file containing all the measurements along with a graphical representation of the particle deposition.",
    "Transfer back the tissues from the cultivation base module to the culture plate. Place the tissues back in the incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2, 90% humidity) until the measurements for the different endpoints at the specific post-exposure time-points.\n3. Measurement of Ciliary Beating\nNote: As per experimental plan (Figure 1), record ciliary beating prior to the exposure and directly after the exposure.\nRemove the tissue culture plates from the incubator and leave them under the hood at RT for 30 min to stabilize the cilia beating.\nPlace the tissues under the light microscope connected to the CiliaMetrix Software.\nRecord the movie and frequency (in Hertz) of the ciliary beating. Measure the frequency every 3 sec for 1 minute.\nReturn the tissues back to the incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2, 90% humidity).\n4. Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) Measurement\nNote: The measurement of TEER is conducted 3 days before and 48 hr after exposure under the hood under sterile condition using Chopstick Electrode (STX-2) connected to a voltohmmeter.\nAdd 200 µl of culture media to the apical surface of the human bronchial tissues.\nTurn on the EVOMX machine; wash the electrode with a 70% ethanol solution.\nWash the electrode with the culture medium.\nMeasure the resistance (Ω) by inserting the electrode into the medium on the apical side of the tissue culture without touching the tissue.\nRepeat step 4.4 five times to obtain quintuplicate measurements.\nAfter the measurements, gently remove the medium from the apical side of the tissue cultures using an aspirator.\nReturn the tissue cultures to the incubator at at 37 °C (5% CO2, 90% humidity) for culturing.\n5. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1/1B1 Activity",
    "Before the start of the study, prepare the luciferin detection reagent by transferring the entire contents of the bottle of the appropriate reconstitution buffer to the amber bottle containing the luciferin detection reagent (according to manufacturer’s instructions). Store aliquots of 2 ml at -20 °C for a maximum of 1 month.\nFor the 48 hr post-exposure time, incubate the tissues for 48 hr following CS exposure at 37 °C.\nWarm the Luciferin detection reagent to RT.\nIncubate tissue inserts for 3 hr or O/N with the Luciferin-CEE substrate (diluted at 1:50) in the basal culture medium.\nTransfer 50 µl of culture medium from each tissue insert to a 96-well opaque white luminometer plate at RT.\nAdd 50 µl of luciferin detection reagent to each well to initiate a luminescent reaction.\nIncubate the plate at RT for 20 min.\nRead the luminescence using a luminometer.\n\tNote: For the luminometer, use an integration time of 0.25–1 sec per well as a guideline.\n6. RNA Extraction.\nBefore collecting 3D organotypic tissue inserts, prepare 1) a box with dry ice, 2) sufficient amount of blades (one per 3D insert), 3) cold PBS without calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, 4) one 25 ml glass pipet, and 5) sterile glass needles for aspiration.\n\t\nLabel tubes filled with ceramic beads for homogenizing solid cellular samples and add 700 µl of Qiazol.\nTurn on aspiration machine.\nCollect the plate of the 3D organotypic tissue inserts from the incubator.\nWash each insert on the plate 3 times with cold PBS. Between the washes, aspirate PBS with the glass needle. After the third wash, aspirate with PBS and cover plate to prevent drying of the insert.",
    "For each insert from the plate, cut out the insert membrane (on which 3D tissue insert resides) until the membrane lies flat down on the blade.\nTransfer the tissue (along with the insert membrane) from the blade to the homogenizing tube appropriately labelled and screw the lid on the tube, shake it and vortex it.\nFreeze the sample in dry ice and store at -80 °C or continue to the extract the RNA.\n\t\tNote: Prior to the extraction of RNA, label all tubes and columns according to the randomization design (if applicable). Prepare all reagents according to manufacturer’s recommendations and take out samples from -80 °C freezer and thaw them on ice until they are completely defrosted.\nHomogenization\n\t\nGrind samples with homogenizing instrument on 6000 Hz for 45 sec. Repeat if the samples are not properly homogenized and leave samples for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 140 µl chloroform to the sample and vortex for 10-15 sec.\nTransfer the supernatant from the homogenizing tube to a Phase lock tube and shake on a thermoshaker for 2 min at 1400 rpm and RT.\nFurther incubate samples for 2 min at RT and centrifuge samples at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nRNA precipitation, wash, suspension and purification in QIAcube.\n\t\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase in a new 2 ml tube.\nLoad all necessary reagents in the extraction robot according to the the manufacturer protocol sheet, select the appropriate protocol, set the elution volume (30 µl) and run the extraction robot.\nWhen the run is finished, remove the rotor adapters and keep elution tubes immediately at 4 °C for further analysis or at -80 °C for long term storage.\nQuality control of the isolated RNA",
    "Determine the quantity of the isolated RNA using an UV reader according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nCheck the quality of RNA and the RNA integrity using microfluidic-gel-based lab-on-a-chip and an UV reader, according to the manufacturer instructions.\n7. Microarray Workflow\nNote: The process described below focuses on the method for Affymetrix GeneChip High throughput 3’IVT Express Kit, which is used for target synthesis for hybridization on Affymetrix 3’ gene expression cartridges starting from the preparation of the RNA to the use of the a complex liquid handling system (e.g., pipetting, diluting, dispensing, or integrating).\nPreparation\n\t\nRandomize samples to avoid batch effects. The number of samples processed by batches is from 1 to 96, including one positive (Commercial Human universal reference RNA) and one negative (RNase free water) control per batch.\nStart the target synthesis using 100 ng of total RNA in 3 µl of RNAse-free water. For 100 ng of total RNA, use a 16 h incubation time.\nRNA Amplification\n\t\nPrepare the Poly-A RNA spike-in control solution by a serial dilution of the Poly-A RNA Stock with Poly-A Control Dilution Buffer:\n\t\t\nFor dilution 1, prepare 2 µl polyA control stock in 36 µl dilution buffer.\nFor dilution 2, prepare 2 µl of dilution 1 in 98 µl of dilution buffer.\nFor dilution 3, prepare 4 µl of dilution 2 in 196 µl of dilution buffer.\nFor dilution 4, prepare 20 µl of dilution 3 in 180 µl of dilution buffer.\nDilute the RNA in RNAse free water to get a concentration of 33.3 ng/µl.\nAdd 2 µl of the polyA control solution to the 3 µl of total RNA sample directly in a 96 well plate. This step is performed by the liquid handling system.",
    "Prepare the liquid handling system and target synthesis. Place the plates on the robot. Place all the required reagents and labware on the deck. The robot will start the procedure by preparing the appropriate mastermixes and incubate the samples in the automated remote controlled PCR block.\nFirst Quality Control Check: Control Of The Amplification Process\n\t\t\nIf the quality of aRNA is acceptable, perform the fragmentation step by adding to each sample 8 µl of fragmentation 5X buffer (This step is performed by the liquid handling system). Otherwise, perform the previous step again starting from the RNA. Use fragmented aRNA immediately or store undiluted and fragmented aRNA at -20 °C (or -70 °C for longer-term storage).\nPerform a second Quality Control analysis by picking up randomly 12 samples in the plate and transfer 1 µl on the microfluidics gel based system to check the efficiency of the fragmentation.\nHybridization procedure\n\t\nScan the chip barcodes and register each sample in the manufacturer’s software according to the instructions.\nPrepare the hybridization mix as follows for a single reaction and add it to 33 µl of the fragmented and labelled aRNA: 4.2 µl of control oligonucleotide B2 (3nM), 12.5 µl of 20x eukaryotic hybridization controls, 25 µl of 100% DMSO, 125 µl of 2x hybridization buffer and 50 µl of H2O for a final volume of 216.7 µl\n\t\tNote: Hybridize, wash and scan positive and negative controls before processing the samples.\nPre-wet the array with 200 µl of pre-hybridization mix contained in the Hybridization Wash and Stain kit.\nPlace the chip in the hybridization oven set at 45 °C and 60 RPM for 10 min.\nIn the meantime, denature the plate (containing the final cocktail hybridization mix) in a PCR block at 99 °C for 5 min and 45 °C for 5 min.",
    "Remove the pre-hybridization mix from the array and replace it with 200 µl of the hybridization cocktail target (one sample per chip).\nPlace the array into the hybridization oven set at 45 °C for 16 hr (O/N) with a rotation speed of 60 RPM.\nWashing and staining\n\t\nRun “Fluidics” from the software menu bar. In the Fluidics dialog box, select the module of interest (1 - 4), then select the Prime_450 program to all modules. Place the tubing for Wash Buffer A in a bottle (400 ml) and for Wash Buffer B in a bottle (200 ml), as well as for milliQ Water in a bottle (500 ml).\nSubsequently, follow the LCD screen instructions. Lift up the needles and place 600 µl stain cocktail 1 (SAPE Solution Mix) and 600 µl stain cocktail 2 (Antibody Solution Mix) containing microcentrifuge tubes at positions #1 and #2, and 900 µl Array Holding buffer solution at position #3.\nAfter the O/N incubation in the oven, aspirate the cocktail from the chip and fill the microarray with 250 µl Wash Buffer A. Assign the right chip to each module, select the FS450-001 protocol and run each module, following instructions on screen. This process lasts 90 min.\nOnce the LCD screen indicates “Eject Cartridge” message, remove the chip and inspect if there are any bubbles. If bubbles are present, fill the array entirely with the Array holding buffer. Apply stickers onto the septa to avoid any leaks in the scanner and clean the microarray window prior to loading in the Scanner.\nScanning.\n\t\nWarm up the scanner. Load the chip into the autoloader of the scanner and start scanning.\n\t\tNote: After ~12 min per chip, a .CEL file per chip is generated.",
    "Check the image and align the grid (if necessary) to the spot to identify the probe cells.\n\t\tNote: The dataset has been submitted to Arrayexpress (Accession code = E-MTAB-1721).\n8. Network-based Systems Biology Analysis for an Impact Assessment\nMicroarray data processing.\n\tNote: Data processing and scoring methods were implemented using the R statistical environment version 2.14.\n\t\nOpen an R 18 session and load the affy 19, gcrma, and affyPLM packages installed by running the commands: library(affy) > library(gcrma) > library(affyPLM)\nRead raw data files running the command: data.affybatch<-ReadAffy(“path to the folder where are stored the CEL files”)\nSubstract the background correction and quantile normale to generate probe set expression values using the gcrma package, by running the command: eset.norm<-gcrma(data.affybatch)\nQuality control.\n\t\nGenerate RNA degradation plots with the command: deg<-AffyRNAdeg(data.affybatch)\nExtract the coefficient of the RNA degradation slope running the command: slope=deg$slope\nPlot the slope coefficient and identify possible outliers.\nGenerate NUSE and RLE plots running the following commands: Pset<-fitPLM(data.affybatch) > RLE(Pset) > NUSE(Pset).\nIdentify if some of the boxplots generated are outliers: an array is considered outlier if at least 2 of the 3 QC metrics defined below deviate from the other arrays:\n\t\t- deg$slope is different from the average deg$slope\n\t\t- NUSE plot: an array is considered outlier if the upper quartile falls below 0.95 or the lower quartile above 1.05, i.e., if the boxplot is entirely above 1.05 or entirely below 0.95.\n\t\t- RLE plot: an array is considered outlier if the median of the RLE distribution is greater than 0.1 or smaller than -0.1.\nIf an array is identified as an outlier, then discard, and start again from step 8.1.2.",
    "Fit an overall linear model to the data for the specific contrasts of interest (i.e., the comparisons of “treated” and “control” conditions) generating raw P values for each probe set on the microarray, which can be further adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure of the Limma package. Select a probeset per gene to keep as representative of the gene for further analyses as described in 20.\n\t\tNote: A blocking factor (the exposure plate) from the experiment design was accounted in the model for data processing.\nNetwork-based analysis.\n\tNote: The method as implemented here is described in detail in Martin et al. (in revision in BMC bioinformatics).\n\t\nFor each pairwise comparison of interest, start from the computed (log2-) fold changes (treatment vs. control) for each gene under the network (from step 8.2).\nCompute the signed Laplacian matrix L of the network defined by L(i,j)=- sign(i~j)w(i,j) if there is an edge of weight w(i,j) between node i and j, L(i,j)=deg(i) is the weighted degree of i and L(i,j)=0 else. The weight w(i,j) are equal to 1 if i and j are in the backbone and w(i,j)=1/n if i is a backbone node and j is one of its n neighbors in the transcript layer.\nCompute scores for the backbone by f=L3-1L2Tx where L3 is the sub-matrix of L to the backbone nodes and L2 is the sub-matrix of L whose rows correspond to the transcriptional layer nodes and column to the backbone nodes\nCompute the signed Laplacian, Q, of the network defined by the backbone network where all the edge signs are reversed.\nCompute the NPA score by NPA=fTQf.\nCompute the confidence interval, the backbone edge permutation p-value and the transcript layer permutation p-value.",
    "Note: In addition to the confidence intervals of the NPA scores, which account for the experimental error (e.g., the biological variation between samples in an experimental group), companion statistics were derived to describe the specificity of the NPA score to the biology described in the network. Because NPA is a quadratic form of the fold changes, its variance can be computed based on the fold-change estimated variances. A confidence interval is subsequently derived using the central limit theorem. Two permutation tests were implemented 21 whereby first, to assesses if the results were specific to the underlying evidence (i.e., gene fold-changes) in the model, leading to a permutation P-value (denoted by *O in the figures when P-value < 0.05). Second, to assess whether the “cause-and-effect” layer of the network significantly contributed to the amplitude of the network perturbation (denoted by K* in the figures when P-value < 0.05).\nConsider the network as impacted by the treatment if the confidence interval does not contain zero AND the two permutation p-values < 0.05.\nCompute the leading nodes which are defined as the key nodes in the backbone contributing up to 80% of the NPA score."
