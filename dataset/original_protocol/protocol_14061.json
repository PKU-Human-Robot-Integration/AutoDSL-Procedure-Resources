    "1. Mechanical probe construction\nCut each nitinol filament (Figure 1B), perpendicular to its long axis, to the specified length (Figure 1M–N) using a small wire cutter (Figure 1C). The filaments come in three different pre-set diameters (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: The lengths specified here are a guide to achieve the approximate pressures indicated, using a similar protocol for construction of the mount. Ultimately, regardless of the length of the filament cut, and the depth of the hole in the mount, the filaments must be measured/calibrated on a balance to obtain the exact force/pressure value.\nExamine the tip of the filament under a stereomicroscope to ensure no sharp or irregular edges remain as these could cause tissue damage to the skin of the larvae and interfere with calibration.\nManually smoothen the sharp edges of the mechanical probe using a sharpening stone until no sharp irregularities persist (Figure 1D).\nMake a hole towards the end of a wooden popsicle stick (Figure 1E) using a hypodermic needle (see Table of Materials). Insert the needle at least halfway through the height of the popsicle stick (Figure 1E). This creates a chamber for insertion of the nitinol filament.\nApply wood glue to a single nitinol filament (Figure 1F) and insert the glue-coated filament into the needle slot in a wooden popsicle stick (Figure 1G). Allow to dry for ~5 h.\nCalibrate each mechanical probe by pressing it against a scale until the mechanical probe bends (Figure 1H–L). This is the point of maximum force that can be recorded in grams. Depending on the filament diameters (pre-set) and lengths (user-determined) a full range of forces and pressures can be generated.",
    "Convert the mass recorded in step 1.6 to force in millinewton (mN) using the formula f = ma (Force is equal to mass multiplied by gravitational acceleration). f: force; m: mass; a: gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s2) (Figure 1M).\nFinally, convert the calculated force to pressure (force/area) in kilopascal (kPa) by dividing the measured force by the surface area of the filament tip (Figure 1M). To calculate the area, convert the diameter of the different nitinol filaments from inches (0.04”, 0.06”, and 0.08”) to centimeters. Then, πr2 (where, r = the nitinol filament radius) determines the area (see Figure 1M). Preparing multiple probes using filaments of different diameters and lengths will generate a full set spanning the responsive range for Drosophila larvae (sample set shown in Figure 1N).\n\tNOTE: Check each mechanical probe at least every 3–4 weeks. When the pressure deviates by more than ± 3% from the original measure, a new mechanical probe must be fabricated.\n2. Preparation of larvae\nRaise control strain (w1118) larval progeny or larvae containing the transgenes ppk-Gal4>UAS-mCD8-GFP (for visualizing damage to sensory neurons) on standard food in a 25 °C incubator. Typically, stocks are routinely maintained at 18 °C but both parents and larval offspring are reared at 25 °C on standard cornmeal food for experiments.\n\tNOTE: Adult flies (five males and ten females, 1:2 ratio) are kept in the fly vials, to allow egg laying, for about 24 h. The time after egg laying (AEL) begins from when the adults are removed.",
    "Collect the third instar larvae, after approximately 96 h of egg laying, by gently squirting tap water into the soft fly food containing the larvae. Wandering larvae that have left the food, or which have everted anterior or posterior spiracles, are too large/old for this assay. Second instar larvae (~ less than 4 mm in length) are too small.\nPour out the contents of the soft fly food into a clean standard size Petri dish (100 mm x 15 mm).\nUsing forceps, sort mid third instar, medium sized, larvae (see Figure 2A) from smaller (second instar and early third instar) or larger (late or wandering third instar) larvae. Gentle manipulation with forceps to avoid any tissue damage to the larvae is recommended.\n\tNOTE: The transfer using forceps is based mostly on water tension and not by applying pressure to the larvae with the blades of the forceps. An alternative to the use of forceps for maneuvering larvae is soft paint brushes. With either tool, the user should practice transferring the animals, so as not to cause unintended tissue damage that could complicate behavioral measurements.\nTransfer the mid third instar larvae, using forceps, into a small Petri dish (30 mm x 15 mm) containing a small plug of fly food moistened with water at room temperature. Keep the larvae in the small Petri dish until the experiments are performed, but not longer than 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Generally, transferring 20–30 larvae to the food plug will give an adequate number for 20 min of behavioral assays.\n3. Mechanical nociception assay",
    "Place a mid-third instar larva (using forceps) onto a thin pad of black or dark vinyl under a bright field stereomicroscope. The dark color provides contrast that improves visualization of the larva. It is preferable to have a freely movable piece of dark vinyl because it allows the user to align the larva without touching or hurting it.\nPut the optical fiber lights between the microscope objective lenses and the black or dark vinyl pad; this will allow adequate high contrast illumination for seeing the larva.\nDiscard larvae that do not exhibit normal locomotion following transfer to the pad. These can interfere with the normal nociceptive behavioral response. For normal locomotion, see Video 1.\nWipe away, using a paper towel, any excess water surrounding the larva that might cause the larva to float on the vinyl pad.\nOrient the larva by moving the dark vinyl pad. The head/mouth of the larva should point to the left if you are right-handed and vice versa if you are left-handed (Figure 2A–B).\nApply the chosen mechanical probe, typically for 1–2 s, onto the posterior dorsal side of the larva at approximately abdominal segment A8 (see Figure 2B), until the probe bends and elicits the previously measured amount of pressure (Figure 2C). It is important that the probe presses against the dorsal surface of the larva and compresses the larvae into the underlying pad at the point of probe contact.",
    "NOTE: At the point of contact between the tip of the nitinol filament and the dorsal cuticle-epidermis, probes lower than 2,300 kPa, mainly bend without penetrating the cuticle and underlying tissues. Such probes seldom affect larval mortality4. At higher pressures (>5,000 kPa) the probes both bend and, occasionally, penetrate the cuticle and underlying tissues. Puncturing of the larvae impairs larval survival4 and, if observed, these larvae are typically discarded from behavioral analysis.\nRecord the behavioral response for each larva. A positive nociceptive response (Video 2) is indicated if the larva shows a complete roll of 360˚ along the axis of its body within 3 s. Other responses (attempting to turn, fast crawling, and wiggling) are considered negative for the purposes of this assay.\n\tNOTE: Larvae stimulated with a subthreshold mechanical stimulus (200 kPa) did not elicit the typical nociceptive or rolling response (Video 3). Some larvae did exhibit fast forward or light touch responses such as changes in the direction of movement.\nDiscard the larva and prepare the next one for assay, repeating steps 3.1 through 3.7.\nRepeat steps 3.1–3.7 until the desired number of larvae is reached (three to six sets of n = 10 larvae were used here for each probe).\n\tNOTE: When using lower pressure mechanical probes (174–462 kPa), the assay will take more time per larva. This is because the tip of longer filaments oscillates more, making it harder to poke the larva in the center of the A8 segment. Practice is necessary with these probes.\n4. Confocal microscopy to assess neuronal morphology",
    "Place a larva (of genotype ppk-Gal4>UAS-mCD8-GFP to label sensory neurons) previously stimulated with a nitinol filament into an etherization chamber inside a Coplin jar containing a 10 mL beaker carrying a cotton ball soaked with ~1 mL of diethyl ether. Let the larva sit in the chamber for ~5 min.\n\tNOTE: A detailed protocol for etherization is provided in a previous study published by our group12.\nRinse the larva gently from the etherization chamber into a small Petri dish.\nHave ready one microscope slide, two small coverslips (22 x 22 mm), and one long coverslip (22 x 54 mm) (see Table of Materials).\nAdd small drops of ether:oil solution (1:5 ratio of ethyl ether to halocarbon oil solution, see Table of Materials) to both ends of the slide, then place the small coverslips on top of the small droplets. This arrangement creates a small space gap where the larva can fit.\n\tNOTE: Press the small coverslips against the microscope slide until it is difficult to slip.\nAdd some drops of ether:oil solution on the middle of the microscope slide and then place the larva, using forceps, onto the center of the microscope slide (between the small coverslips). Make sure that the anteroposterior axis of the larva is parallel to the short side of the slide and that the dorsal side is facing up.\nCover the larvae with the long coverslip placed on top of the larva and the two smaller coverslips.\n\tNOTE: Generously press the long coverslip until the larva is almost flat.\nImage segment A8 of the larva using a confocal microscope (see Table of Materials) using laser wavelength 488 (GFP).\n\tNOTE: Image the larva immediately because the anesthetization via ether will fade quickly (~5–10 min) and the larva will wake up and move, which will complicate further imaging.",
    "Capture Z-stack images at a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels using a 20x numerical aperture (NA) 0.7 dry objective lens at 1x zoom, step size of 1.5 μm.\n5. Quantitation of tissue damage\nCollect and convert the Z-series stack images, from section 4.8, into a single Z projection (a flattening of multiple images taken at different focal planes into a single composite image). This can be performed using commercially available software (e.g., Olympus Fluoview) or any equivalent open source platform, e.g., Fiji/Image J. Save the single Z projection in the TIFF format.\nOpen the image analysis program Fiji/ImageJ.\nClick on File, from the menu bar, and select Open from the window that is displayed.\nSelect the stored single image projection, saved in the TIFF format, to be analyzed.\nClick on Edit, from the menu bar, and select the Invert option from the window that is displayed.\nClick on the Image, from the menu bar, then select Adjust, from the window that is displayed, and finally select the Brightness/Contrast option.\nSelect the Freehand Shape option from the tool bar to measure the area of the gap (if any).\nClick on Analyze, from the menu bar, and select the Measure option. This will display the area of the gap or wound."
