    "SiRNA preparation for RNAi screeningIn this article, we utilize an ER-network RNAi library screening as an example to describe the protocol. The ER network siRNA library contains siRNAs against 631 genes, which were custom-made from QIAGEN (MD, USA). siRNAs against those genes were distributed into 11 x 96-well plates. Two siRNAs were selected for each gene and mixed in one well. Notes: For other siRNA library screening, the total number of plates will be determined based on the number of targeted genes and number of targeting siRNAs per gene as well. In summary, the total number and final layout of wells containing siRNA in an RNAi library will modify the screening protocol. Calculate the amount of various control siRNA (0.24 µM) needed to make 11 plates (100 µl each well):Preparation of negative control siRNA (siNEG)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731025656_2025.jpgAccounting for pipetting error, 18 ml of 0.24 µM siNEG will be prepared as followed: 4.32 ml siNEG (1 µM) + 13.68 ml siRNA suspension buffer.Preparation of DEATH, AP2A1(X) and GRB14(Y) siRNA imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731025736_4279.jpgAccounting for pipetting error, 8 ml of 0.24 µM DEATH, X and Y siRNA will be prepared as followed: 1.92 ml DEATH, X or Y siRNA (1 µM) + 6.08 ml siRNA suspension buffer. Preparation of ER network library siRNAsFor each siRNA mix in one well, prepare 100 µl 0.24 µM siRNA as followed: 24 µl 1 µM stock siRNA + 76 µl siRNA suspension buffer.Estrogen Receptor siRNA Library Screening using RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent in MCF7 cellsDay 1Autoclave 500 ml glass bottles and magnetic stir bars. Day 2 Set up siRNA Library plates (stock concentration: 0.24 µM, in V-bottom 96-well plates). Layouts are shown in the following 96-well plates (Plates #1-10, Figure 5; Plates #11, Figure 6). The total number of siRNA library plates is 11.",
    "Unlabeled wells are for siRNAs against ER network target genes. Labeled wells are for various controls (NEG, DEATH, AP2A1 and GRB14 and MOCK [siRNA suspension buffer]). 100 µl diluted siRNA was dispensed into each well, stock in -20 °C. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731030608_3966.jpgFigure 5.

Layout of ER network siRNA library plate #11 Next, prepare 11 flat-bottom 96-well plates as experimental plates. Barcodes for these 11 plates need to be printed and pasted on plates (front and middle). After labeling, these plates are stored in a cell culture hood overnight. Meanwhile, confirm that all materials, including screening media, transfection reagent, plates, transfer pipette tips, and cell cultures are ready.The Cybio program (Figure 7) will pipette 10 µl from 0.24 µM siRNA ER library plate in V-bottom plate, then mixed into Costar 96-well plate that already has 10.5 µl of diluted RNAimax transfection reagent. The final concentration of siRNA in cells was 20 nM.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731030721_2967.jpgFigure 7. Cybio program to dispense siRNA into RNAi screening experimental plates. A. The first part of program; B. The second part of program.Each experimental plate (Costar 96-well plate) must have 10.5 µl of diluted lipid transfection reagent (0.5 µl RNAimax + 10 µl Opti-MEM medium) added to each well with Combi-nL dispensing machine. 96 wells x 10.5 µl = 1,008 µl, 11 plates 11,088 µl. Accounting for loss from machine priming, make 15 ml for 11 plates. Then load these siRNA and experimental plates on Cybio machine as following:siRNA ER library plates (0.24 µM, 11 plates)–loaded on Left Arm, Stack A, plates ascending from the bottom with lids removed before loading;Experimental plates (11 plates)–loaded on Right Arm, Stack A; plates with ascending from the bottom with lids removed before loading.Procedure and timeline: Thaw siRNA library plates (stock concentration: 0.",
    "24 µM) at room temperature.Clean WellMate microplate dispenser machine with 15 ml of filtered 70% ethanol, then 15 ml of filtered ddH2O, and 15 ml IMEM medium (without serum).Split MCF7 cells and count. Dilute 8,000 cells in 100 µl (80,000 cells/ml). For one plate: 16 ml of diluted cells are needed. Therefore, for 11 plates: 250 ml diluted cells in 500 ml sterile bottle, with magnet stir bar on the magnetic stirrers, low speed. Plate cells in new flasks if necessary. Clean Combi-nL dispensing machine with 7 ml of filtered 70% ethanol, 7 ml filtered ddH2O, and 7 ml Opti-MEM medium. When the siRNA library plates have thawed, centrifuge them at 3,500 rpm (1,935 x g) for 5 min at room temperature. Take plate out immediately to keep condensation from forming.Dispense 15 ml Opti-MEM in a 50 ml conical tube.Dilute transfection reagent: 720 µl RNAimax in 14.3 ml Opti-MEM in a 50 ml conical tube.Dispense 10.5 µl/well of diluted transfection reagent to 11 experimental plates (Costar 96-well plates).Load experimental plates and siRNA plates on designated stacks of Cybio-machine. siRNA plates: Left Arm, Stack A; experimental plates: Right Arm, Stack A. Lids were removed before loading, and plates ascending from the bottom. Start Cybio machine, run program (Figure 7) to distribute 11 plates of library siRNAs as shown in attached plate layout (Figures 5 and 6). Set up a timer, record the time of each plate being processed. Proceed to the next step while completing this step. Note: In this example, the time for running one plate and changing tips was 1 min and 15 sec. The total machine running process will take about 15 min. After the first four experimental plates containing diluted siRNA-lipid mixture are completed, transfer these plates to the cell culture hood.",
    "A second person should continue running the remainder of plates on Cybio machine. After waiting 10-15 min from the time of siRNA-lipid mixture, use the WellMate microplate dispenser machine to dispense 100 µl of cells/well to the first four experimental plates. Wait for another 5 min, then prime the WellMate machine with 5-7 ml cell suspension, dispense cells for the next 4 plates; then wait for another 5 min, prime machine with 5-7 ml cell suspension, dispense cells for the last 3 plates. Document the time each plate received cells. Notes:  Four plates as a group to be added with cells.Put WellMate dispenser probe into diluted cells only before adding cells into experimental plates, not earlier, and then prime machine with 5-7 ml cell suspension for each group.Clean WellMate dispenser with 15 ml filtered ddH2O, then 15 ml filtered 70% ethanol, and switch off the machine. Clean the Combi-nL dispenser with 7 ml distilled water, and 7 ml of filtered (0.45 µm) 70% ethanol, switch off machine.Day 7Add 20 µl of 1:1 mixture of Cell Titer Blue:HBSS to each well and read out every hour up to 4 h (as described above)."
