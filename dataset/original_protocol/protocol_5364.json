    "Preparation of wheat seedlingsSoak the wheat seeds at room temperature in a 500 ml flask, and rinse with running water overnight (Figure 1A).Note: Prepare about 20 seeds for each inoculation treatment to make sure at least 12 germinated seedlings can be used for each inoculation treatment in one experiment. For example, to examine the virulence of two strains of mutant F. graminearum, along with one wild-type strain and mock inoculation, 80 seeds need to be soaked. Place the imbibed seeds in a medical enamel tray containing 2 layers of wet gauze (Figure 1B) and germinate in the dark for 1 day at 25 °C in a growth chamber.Note: Cover the tray with the lid to keep the gauze wet during germination.Put a small piece of paper towel in each well of 24-well cell culture plates and drench with water. Transplant the germinated seeds to 24-well cell culture plates, one seed per well (Figure 1C).Grow the plants in the growth chamber for 1 day under controlled environment conditions at 25 °C with a 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731232210_7847.jpgFigure 1. Germination of wheat seeds. Wheat seeds were rinsed in flask with water (A) for one night and then transferred to an enamel tray with wet gauze (B). The germinated seeds were transplanted to 24-well cell culture plates (C). The ruler has scale in mm.Preparation of F. graminearum conidia suspensionFrom a stock culture, pick a small quantity of F. graminearum mycelia using a sterile toothpick, and transfer to a fresh V8 agar plate. Incubate the culture in 25 °C growth chamber for 3-5 days.Scrape the V8 agar plate, now full of aerial hyphae with a sterilized tweezer, and pick up some pieces.",
    "Transfer these pieces into 100 ml sterilized mung bean liquid medium, then incubate in a constant temperature shaker at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 3-5 days.Filter the mung bean liquid medium culture, then collect the filtered liquid medium into a sterile 250 ml centrifuge bottle. Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the conidia pellet in 1 ml sterile water by pipetting, then transfer the conidia suspension into a 1.5 ml sterile centrifuge tube. Wash the pellet three times using sterile water.Resuspend the conidia pellet in sterile water and adjust the concentration to 106 conidia/ml.Note: The suspension should be used for inoculation within 2 h. Resuspend the conidia just before inoculation.Wheat coleoptile inoculationCut off the top 1-2 mm of coleoptiles of three-day-old wheat seedlings and add 2 μl F. graminearum wild-type or mutant suspension (106 conidia/ml) to the top of remaining seedling (Figure 2B and Video 1). For mock-inoculation controls, add 2 μl sterile water to the wounded sites.Note: Check the status of seedlings before inoculation. The coleoptiles of the seedlings ready for inoculation should have not been ruptured, see Figure 2A.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731232652_1537.jpgFigure 2.

    "The infection progress of fluorescently-tagged F. graminearum strains can be tracked under microscopy (step C4).Note: The lesions caused by F. graminearum are inconspicuous at the early infection stage (e.g., 1 day post inoculation, dpi). At 2-3 dpi, the coleoptiles at the inoculation sites are turning dark brown and there are aerial hyphae (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731232839_0616.jpgFigure 3.

Lesion size caused by F. graminearum strains. Black scale bar represents 1 cm. Measurements of one representative experiment are shown. Data are means ± SD (n = 12), *P < 0.001 (significant), Student’s t-test.Measure the lesion size on coleoptiles of infected wheat seedlings at 7 dpi by photographing them with a ruler as reference (Figure 3C).Note: Repeat the experiment at least three times, each time use at least 12 seedlings per treatment.Microscopic observation of wheat coleoptile infection by fluorescently-tagged F. graminearum strains (optional).The conidia germinated on the coleoptile surface within 10 h-after-inoculation (HAI), and spread quickly inside host tissue from 16 HAI to 64 HAI (Zhang et al., 2012).Harvest wheat seedlings at given time point after inoculation, and cut off the coleoptiles according to the lesion size.Place coleoptiles on a glass slide immersed in sterile water covered by a coverslip.Examine coleoptiles using Olympus BX51 microscope or Olympus Fv10i as described in (Zhang et al., 2012; He et al., 2016).Chemical treatment (Figure 4) (optional).Prepare cotton strips (4 x 2 cm).Wrap the cotton strips around the top of the coleoptiles of 1 dpi wheat seedlings (Video 2).",
    "Add chemical solutions (amino acid solutions, etc.) to the cotton strips. Grow the wheat seedlings in a growth chamber for another 6 days under conditions described in step C2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170731/20170731233154_2848.jpgFigure 4. Process for chemical treatment on wheat coleoptiles after inoculation. One day after inoculation, seedlings ready for chemical treatment are shown in the top panel. Note that new leaves have protruded from the coleoptile. Prepare cotton strips, and wrap the wound sites of the coleoptiles with cotton strips (middle panel). Then pipette chemical solutions (20-40 μl) to the wrapped cotton strips.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Wrapping the wheat seedling with cotton strip"
