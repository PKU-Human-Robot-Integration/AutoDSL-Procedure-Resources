    "NOTE: Approval for all animal procedures presented below was obtained from the University of South Florida’s Animal Care Committee (IACUC) and abide by all requirements of the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Preparation of Silicone Sheets and Surgical Instruments\nPrecut strips (10.5 cm x 3.0 cm) of non-reinforced 0.01 thickness, medical grade silicone sheeting and sterilize using an autoclave.\nClean and sterilize suitable surgical instruments (scissors, forceps and drapes or towels to create a sterile field during surgery).\n2. Experimental Animals\nUse adult male or female rats weighing in range from 250-350 g obtained from a commercial breeder. If aged rats are utilized, they should be ≥350 g in order to ensure better survival post-surgery. Prior to the start of any experiments acclimate all animals for at least 7 days under standard conditions of a 12 hr light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.\n3. Anesthesia, Pre-operative Analgesia and Operative Preparation\nInduce general anesthesia by using isoflurane at 3%-4% via an induction chamber and maintain (via use of a nose cone) at 1%-2% with O2 during skin preparation and surgery. Monitor the depth of anesthesia by observation of the rate and depth of respiration, interdigital pinch or palpebral blink reflex.\n\tNOTE: At this time, a vet ointment can be placed on the eyes to prevent dryness while the animal is under anesthesia.\nIn a location remote from the sterile surgical area, place the rat in the prone position and shave the dorsum with clippers from the base of the neck down approximately 11 cm. Stencil with permanent marker, the outline for the 3.0 cm x 10.5 cm flap (see Figure 1A).",
    "Move the rat to a clean, designated surgical area equipped with an approved heating pad and sterile surgical drapes or towels. Inject 5 mg/kg Ketoprofen subcutaneously prior to the first surgical incisions for pain management. Additional fluids (saline) can be given (up to 5 cc) subcutaneously as needed.\nPrepare the skin further by swabbing first with 70% isopropyl alcohol and second with 0.2% chlorhexidine, then apply sterile drapes to create a sterile field. 10% povidone-iodine (Betadine) can also be used.\n\tNOTE: An antibiotic (ampicillin at 15 mg/kg) can be administered subcutaneously, but if good aseptic techniques are used it is not required.\n4. Creating Excisional Wounds and Bipedicled Flap\nUsing a sterile, disposable 6 mm biopsy punch tool, create two circular “ischemic” wounds in the center of the designated flap area (Figure 1B). The depth of the wound should be down to (not through) the underlying fascia of the panniculus carnosus muscle (Figure 1B inset).\nUsing forceps lift the skin in the middle of the wound outline created by the punch biopsy and then use iris scissors (with curved tips) to excise the circular piece of tissue (including the panniculus carnosus muscle). The result will be a full-thickness wound with the fascia as the base of the wound.\n\tNOTE: The excised tissue (wound plugs) can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 10% buffered-formalin O/N for later processing as control, normal skin.",
    "Create a bipedicled flap by making incisions with a sterile scalpel on each side of the ischemic wounds along the pre-drawn lines (Figure 1C) that are 10.5 cm in length and 3.0 cm apart. The depth of the incisions should be down to the paraspinous muscles. Using iris scissors, separate the panniculus carnosus fascia from the paraspinous muscles, being careful to keep the fascia intact as the “base” of the 6 mm punches (Figure 1D).\nTake 1 sterile pre-cut silicone sheet and place it in between the panniculus carnosus fascia and the paraspinous muscles (Figure 1E) ensuring that the sheet does not buckle or fold. Using black, non-absorbable sutures (size 4.0) close both incisions by anchoring the silicone sheet to the skin with at least 8 interrupted stitches on each side, along the length of the flap (Figure 1F and 1G).\nUsing a sterile, disposable biopsy punch tool, create two internal control “non-ischemic” wounds (down to the anterior fascia of the panniculus carnosus muscle) 1 cm lateral to the ischemic wounds on either side of the flap (Figure 1G).\nPlace a ruler below the wounds and take digital photos for wound measurement purposes (see Figure 3A). At this time, blood flow (perfusion) can be monitored by use of laser Doppler or other manipulations (topical drug placement) performed.\nApply an approved liquid adhesive both cranial and caudal to the wounds and a transparent film dressing to keep the wound environment moist and clean (sterile). An additional dressing may be placed at the caudal end of the flap to prevent the animal from removing the most caudal sutures.\n5. Post-operative Procedures",
    "Place animals in cages (singly housed) equipped with shallow feeders so as to prevent the surgical site from rubbing against the feeder. Animals should not be left unattended or returned to the company of other animals until they regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and exhibit purposeful movement. Heating mats should be placed under half of the cage for up to 2 days during recovery.\nTo manage pain post-operatively, administer Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously to animals the following morning and 1x per day for up to 48 hr post-surgery. Animals should also be monitored daily for prolonged signs of pain, weight loss or surgical site infections.\n6. Subsequent Wound Measurements and Dressing Changes\nMeasure ischemic and non-ischemic wounds frequently under general anesthesia using isoflurane at 3%-4% via an induction chamber and maintained (via a nose cone) at 1%-2% with O2 as in step 3.1.\nRemove the dressing gently as to not pull the adhesive from the skin. At this time additional digital photos are taken for wound measurements, topical treatments re-applied, laser Doppler imaging (LDI) or other manipulations performed to suit the investigator’s needs.\nApply adhesive and a clean dressing and allow the animal to recover as in step 5.1.\n7. Wound Collection and Euthanasia\nHarvest ischemic and non-ischemic wounds (on days the investigator deems appropriate) while the animal is under general anesthesia using isoflurane at 3%-4% via an induction chamber and maintained (via a nose cone) at 1%-2% with O2 as in step 3.1.",
    "Using a scalpel, make a square shaped excision around the wound to include some healthy tissue around the wound. Place the excision into a 1.5 ml snap cap tube and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen (store at -80 °C) for future molecular analysis or incubate in 10% buffered formalin O/N at RT for histological processing.\n\tNOTE: The wound excisions can also be cut in half to provide more samples for analysis.\nAfter wound tissue removal, euthanize the animal using the approved method of CO2 inhalation.\nSubscription Required.
