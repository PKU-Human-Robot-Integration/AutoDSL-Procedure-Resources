    "1. Select Appropriate Materials and Construct a Sampling Plan\nBegin the experiment by developing an appropriate sampling plan. There is no generic and universal approach so evaluate each plan on a case-by-case basis. Ensure that the sampling plan states the sampling places, times and the precise sampling procedure. See Figure 1 for the sampling plan used in this case study.\n\t​NOTE: In this case study, grape berries from a single clone (Vitis vinifera cv. Corvina, clone 48) were collected from seven commercial vineyards in three different macro-zones in the province of Verona (Lake Garda, Valpolicella and Soave). The principal features of each vineyard are summarized in Table 1. Berries were collected during three growing seasons (2006, 2007, and 2008) at three time points, corresponding to veraison (the onset of ripening), mid-ripening and ripe berries.\n\t\nFor each of the accessions (vineyard/year/ripening stage), harvest 30 clusters from different positions along two vine rows, with randomized heights and locations on the plant.\nSelect three berries randomly from each cluster, avoiding those with visible damage and/or signs of infection.\nRepeat steps 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 to obtain three independent pools.\nDeseed the berries and freeze the pericarp immediately in liquid nitrogen.\nCrush 10 frozen berries from each pool with an automatic mill grinder, and divide each powdered sample into two equal parts, one for transcriptomics analysis and one for metabolomics analysis.\nStore the powders at -80 °C.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n,AM,BA,BM,CS,FA,MN,PM\nMacro-zone,Soave,Lake Garda,Valpolicella,Lake Garda,Valpolicella,Valpolicella,Soave\nHeight (m),250,120,450,100,130,250,130\nRootstock,41B,S04,K5BB,420A,420A,K5BB,41B\nRow direction,E-W,N-S,E-W,E-W,E-W,N-S,N-S\nTraining system,Overhead System (Pergola),Overhead System (Pergola),Vertical Shoot Positioning (Guyot),Overhead System (Pergola),Overhead System (Pergola),Vertical Shoot Positioning (Guyot),Vertical Shoot Positioning (Guyot)\nSoil type,Silty clay,Loam,Clay,Loam,Clay Loam,Silt loam,Clay loam\nPlanting layout (m),3.20 x 1.00,4.50 x 0.80,4.00 x 1.25,3.50 x 1.20,3.50 x 0.75,2.80 x 1.00,1.80 x 0.80\nTotal lime %,3.9,19.3,18.3,14.4,31,5.9,27.9\nActive lime %,0.5,2.6,9.4,6.3,11.3,3.1,8.3\nSand %,15,47,66,42,29,13,36\nLoam %,43,36,21,37,39,67,36\nClay %,42,17,13,21,32,20,28\nSoil pH,8.3,7.9,7.8,8.2,8.2,7.8,7.9",

Prepare Berry Powder Extracts, Analyze the Metabolites and Process the Data\nPrepare the Berry Powder Samples for Analysis.\n\t\nPrepare the metabolic extracts of the berry samples at room temperature in three volumes (w/v) of methanol acidified with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in an ultrasonic bath at 40 kHz for 15 min. Use LC-MS-grade water and formic acid, and HPLC-grade methanol.\nCentrifuge the extracts at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDilute the supernatant from step 2.1.2 in two volumes (v/v) of deionized water and pass through a 0.2-µm filter.",
    "Analyze the Berry Extracts by HPLC-ESI-MS.\n\t\nSet up the HPLC-ESI-MS system according to the supplier's recommendations.\n\t\t​NOTE: In this case study, the setup comprised an HPLC system equipped with an autosampler, connected in-line with an ion trap mass spectrometer and electrospray ionization source.\nConnect the HPLC system with a C18 guard column (7.5 x 2.1 mm2) and a Reversed Phase C18 column (150 x 2.1 mm2, particle size 3 µm).\nPrepare the solvents used as the mobile phase. Use 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% (v/v) formic acid in water as Solvent A and 100% acetonitrile as solvent B. Use LC-MS-grade acetonitrile, water and formic acid.\nRun the HPLC separation with a linear gradient of solvents A and B at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml min-1 using a sample injection volume of 30 µl.\n\t\t\nInitially equilibrate the column with 100% solvent A. Following sample injection, establish a gradient from 0% to 10% solvent B in 5 min, from 10% to 20% solvent B in 20 min, from 20% to 25% solvent B in 5 min, and from 25% to 70% solvent B in 15 min.\nAnalyze each sample in duplicate. Randomize sample analysis to avoid instrument-driven effects. Allow 20 min for re-equilibration with 100% solvent A between each analysis.\nAcquire mass spectra in alternate negative and positive ionization modes. For the results described in this case study, set the parameters as in Table 2. The precise machine setting depends on the specific platform.\n\t\t​NOTE: Alternatively, use other suitable methods according to the specific platform.",
    "In all cases, as with any separation platform, make sure to use a suitable re-equilibration time, in order to have retention time reproducibility. When the number of samples is high (above ten samples), analyze them in batches of 9-10 samples, with chromatographic column cleaning programs (slow gradients between the two elution solvents) between each batch. To have enough retention time reproducibility, ensure that the first chromatographic analysis of each batch is a blank analysis (i.e., analysis of the solvent).\nAlso acquire mass spectra in fragmented negative and positive ion modes setting the fragmentation options (two ion precursors, MS3). Annotate the metabolites by fragmentation tree analysis (MS/MS and MS3) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: This is particularly suitable for plant metabolites because they are often glycosylated, therefore the first fragmentation (MS/MS) tends to remove the sugar moieties leaving the free aglycone ion, and subsequent fragmentation (MS3) helps to identify the aglycone against an authentic standards library.\nAcquire MS/MS and MS3 spectra in the m/z range 50-1,500 with a fragmentation amplitude of 1 V. Alternatively, use other suitable methods according to the specific platform.\nFor each m/z signal, compare the MS/MS and MS3 fragmentation patterns and retention times to the authentic standards library according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Many type of platforms include software facilities to build this kind of library through the analysis of authentic standards. This should identify many of the signals but not all signals will be annotated.\nFor the remaining anonymous signals, compare the MS/MS and MS3 fragmentation patterns with those published in the literature, searching for m/z values (i.e., digit \"m/z 353\" to look for publications in which molecules with such m/z are mentioned) with any of the common search engine freely available, or use online databases such as MassBank (www.massbank.jp/en/database.html) and the Human Metabolome Database (www.hmdb.ca/search/spectra?type=ms_search).",

    "Access or download a data processing software package that can extract relevant information from many raw chromatograms and build a data matrix in which each detected metabolite is quantified in each sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol steps below are tailored for the open-source software MZmine v2.14 (http://mzmine.sourceforge.net). It is an open-source software for mass-spectrometry data processing, with the main focus on LC-MS data.27\nTransform the LC-MS chromatogram data into netCDF format using the software provided by the equipment manufacturer. For the results described here, use the Bruker Daltonics Esquire v5.2 and Data Analysis v3.2 softwares and perform steps according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Other converters may be used (various free-ware converters are available).\nImport the .cdf files into the software.\nImplement the peak detection, alignment, gap filling and peak filtering procedures with the parameters reported in Table 3.\n\t\t\nAs first step, select an imported .cdf file, then go to Visualization → TIC/XIC Visualizer. Put the cursor upon the base of the smallest peak in the chromatogram and take note about the minimum intensity signal of the base ion. Then go to Raw Data Methods → Peak Detection.\nSelect Mass Detection and fill the signal level to detect individual ions for each scan and create an ion list.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Check the algorithm prior to performing the mass detection - it depends on the mass spectrometer. In our case, we select Centroid.\nSelect Chromatogram Builder and fill with the signal level to connect data points from the ion list and build a chromatogram for each mass value. See the parameters specified in the mass spectrometer's manual to adjust the Min Time Span and m/z tolerance.",
    "Next, go to Peak List Methods → Peak Detection → Chromatogram Deconvolution. Select the appropriate algorithm (in this case Local Minimum Search) to allow the separation of each chromatogram into individual peaks.\nManually inspect the chromatograms to find out the appropriate values for the following parameters. Set the Chromatographic Threshold to 30% to remove the noise and Search Minimum in RT Range to 2 (min) to identify the presence of minimum locals to discriminate two peaks.\nSet Minimum Relative Height at 2.0. Manually inspect the chromatogram to identify the minimum absolute height of signal that corresponds to a peak and not to the background; set this value as Absolute Height (for instance, 10,000 in the presented experiment).\nSet Min Ratio of Peak Top/Edge to 1.1 to state the minimum ratio between the top and the lowest data point intensities of a peak to be recognized as a true peak.\nManually inspect the chromatograms to see which is the minimum duration of the various peaks in the used chromatographic conditions (for instance, between 0.2 and 2 min, depending on the compound, in the presented experiments), and consequently use these values as Peak Duration Range (min) to set the range of acceptable peak length as duration.\nThen go to Peak List Methods → Isotopes → Isotopic Peaks Grouper to group isotopes in one peak, usually in the most intense. Note: The parameters depend on the resolution of the mass spectrometer and the reproducibility of the retention times.\nFinally, go to Peak List Methods → Alignment → Join Aligner to align peaks depending on their m/z and retention time by using a match score.",
    "After aligning the peaks, fill any data gaps by clicking on Peak List Methods → Gap Filling → Peak Finder. Finally, filter duplicate data points by clicking on Peak List Methods → Filtering → Duplicate Peak Filter.\nExport the resulting dataset as a .csv file.\nManually change the .csv extension to a .txt extension. If no file extensions are visible, change the computer settings to reveal file extensions. Go to File Explorer Options → View → Advanced Settings and uncheck the box 'Hide extensions for known file types'.\nImport the .txt files into a spreadsheet. This produces a data matrix in which all the detected metabolites, recognized by an identification number, m/z value and retention time, are quantified in all samples in terms of their peak area values.\n3. Prepare Berry Powder Extracts for Transcriptome Analysis and Process the Data\nExtract Total RNA from the Berry Samples and Determine the RNA Quality.\n\t\nExtract total RNA from the berry samples.\n\t\tNOTE: In this case study, a proprietary kit and a modified procedure that ensures the complete removal of molecules that interfere with RNA analysis, such as polysaccharides and polyphenols, were used. The instructions below are specific for this kit18.\n\t\t\nWeigh 400 mg of berry powder for each sample, divide it into two portions and place 200 mg each in two microfuge tubes.\nAdd 900 µl of the lysis solution containing β-mercaptoethanol (provided in the kit) to each 200 mg of powder and vortex immediately and vigorously for at least 30 sec.

    "Pipet 700 µl of the supernatant into the filtration column provided in the kit (blue retainer ring) seated in a 2 ml collection tube. Close the cap and centrifuge at maximum speed in a benchtop microfuge for 1 min to remove residual debris. Repeat this step twice using the same filtration column but a fresh collection tube, resulting in three tubes each containing ~700 µl of the clarified lysate.\nPipet 750 µl of binding solution (supplied in the kit) into each tube of clarified lysate and mix immediately by pipetting up and down at least five times. Transfer 700 µl of this mixture to the binding column provided in the kit (red retainer ring) seated in a 2 ml collection tube. Close the cap and centrifuge at maximum speed in a benchtop microfuge for 1 min to bind the RNA.\nDecant the flow-through fraction, invert the collection tube and tap it briefly on a clean pad of absorbent paper to drain the residual liquid.\nReturn the column to the collection tube and pipet the remaining mixture into the same column and repeat the centrifugation and decanting steps. Repeat until the entire mixture has been filtered into the same red binding column.\nNow follow the remaining instructions in the kit and elute the RNA in 50 µl elution buffer (supplied in the kit) and store it at -80 °C ready for the quality control steps.\nDetermine the quantity and purity of the RNA using a spectrophotometer. Record the absorbance ratios which reveal the degree of contamination with proteins (A260/280) and polyphenols/polysaccharides (A260/230).\n\t\tNOTE: RNA suitable for microarray hybridization should score at least 1.8 for both ratios.\nDetermine the integrity of the RNA.",
    "NOTE: Various systems can be used. A digital acquirer that performs a capillary electrophoretic run in combination with a fluorescent dye was used in this case study. RNA suitable for microarray hybridization should have a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of at least 8.\nPrepare Samples and Hybridize the RNA to a Custom Microarray.\n\t\nSet the starting amount of total RNA for microarray analysis to 200 ng by diluting the RNA solution obtained in the step 3.1.1.8 with deionized RNase-free water. Add the appropriate amount of RNA to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube in a final volume of 1.5 µl.\nAdd 2 µl of diluted spike mix to each RNA sample and follow the manufacturer's instructions to synthesize first strand cDNA, transcribe this into cRNA and label the cRNA with cyanine 3CTP.\nPurify the labeled cRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions and elute in 30 µl RNase-free water.\nDetermine the yield and specific activity of each cRNA by recording three values on a spectrophotometer: cyanine 3 dye concentration (pmol µl-1), RNA purity (A260/280) and cRNA concentration (ng µl-1). Use the formulae found in the manufacturer's instruction manual to calculate the cRNA yield (µg) and the specific activity (pmol Cy3 per µg cRNA).\n\t\tNOTE: Recommended yields and specific activities differ on the basis of the specific microarray format.
