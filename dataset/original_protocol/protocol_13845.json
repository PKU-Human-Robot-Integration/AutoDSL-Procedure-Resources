    "All animal research procedures were provided in accordance with the Laboratory Animals Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guidelines and Policies for Rodent Experiments provided by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in the School of Medicine of The Catholic University of Korea.\n1. Preparation of MSCs and injectable gelatin hydrogels\nCulture MSCs in a 100 mm culture dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2. When MSCs growth reaches 80% confluence, wash the dish twice with DPBS and add 1 mL of trypsin-substitute at 37 °C for 3 min.\n\tNOTE: MSCs were isolated from murine bone marrow following conventional procedures16, cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic−antimycotic solution, and used between passage 7‒9 for this study.\nAdd 9 mL of culture medium and centrifuge at 500 x g for 3 min. Next, discard the resulting supernatant, resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS, and maintain the cell suspension on ice.\nDilute 10 µL of cell suspension with 10 µL of Trypan blue and obtain the cell concentration using an automated cell counter.\nResuspend and transfer MSCs to a 1 mL tube at a density of 1 x 107 cells/mL.\nPrepare a 6.25 wt% of GH conjugate solution in PBS and separate into 2 vials. Next, mix the GH solutions with either 6 µg/mL of HRP (GH solution A) or 0.07 wt% of H2O2 (GH solution B).\n\tNOTE: Prepare gelatin-hydroxyphenyl propionic acid (GH) conjugates according to published protocols12,15.\n\t\nKeep a 9:1 volumetric ratio of GH conjugate solution to HRP (GH solution A) and GH conjugate solution to H2O2 (GH solution B), respectively.",
    "Prior to mixing the MSCs with GH solution A, briefly centrifuge the cell suspension at 1,000 x g and carefully aspirate the resulting supernatant. Subsequently, mix the pellet containing MSCs with GH solution A.\n2. In situ MSC-loading and three-dimensional in vitro culture\nLoad GH solution A (containing MSCs) and GH solution B into either side of a dual syringe. Plate 300 µL of the combined GH solutions with MSCs at a final density of 5 x 106 cells/mL onto an eight-well chamber slide.\nAfter in situ hydrogel formation and subsequent MSC encapsulation via enzymatic cross-linking, add 700 µL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic−antimycotic solution.\nIncubate the slide at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and replace the culture medium every 2‒3 days.\n3. Confirmation of in vitro proliferation and survival of MSCs within GH hydrogels\nTo determine the viability of 3D cultured MSCs within GH hydrogels, use a live/dead cell staining assay after the predetermined incubation time.\nFollowing incubation of the encapsulated MSCs in GH hydrogels for 3, 5, 7 or 14 days, aspirate the medium and wash the well twice with PBS.\nPrepare a staining solution containing 5 µL of calcein AM and 20 µL of ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) in 10 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 200 µL of the staining solution to the well and incubate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.\nAspirate the staining solution and wash the well twice with PBS.\nCarefully separate the chamber from the slide and place a full coverslip over the GH hydrogels. Use a confocal microscopy to visualize the degree of proliferation and morphological changes of the encapsulated MSCs.\n\tNOTE: Fluorescent images were acquired under 200x magnification and imaged at the excitation/emission wavelengths of 470/540 nm for calcein and 516/607 nm for EthD-1.",
    "4. Induction of myocardial infarction in mice\nAnesthetize 7-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (20‒22 g) with intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Zoletil (30 mg/kg) and Rompun (10 mg/kg) in saline.\nPrior to surgery, depilate the mouse chest using hair removal cream and sterilize the skin with iodine.\nPlace the mouse on an operating table and intubate by inserting a catheter into the trachea to provide supplemental oxygen via mechanical ventilation.\nGently cut through the skin using surgical scissors and then penetrate the intercostal muscles by micro scissors. Separate the 2nd and 3rd left ribs using a 5-0 silk suture to maintain an open chest cavity.\nCarefully ligate the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery using a needle holder with an 8-0 polypropylene suture and cut the suture using electrocautery.\nObserve an immediate color change in the anterior left ventricular wall.\n5. Intramyocardial transplantation of MSC-loading GH hydrogels\nAfter inducing the myocardial infarction by LAD ligation, inject 10 µL of MSC-loading GH solutions into two different points at the infarct border zone (total: 2 x 105 MSCs/20 µL) using a dual-syringe equipped with a 26G needle.\n\t\nFollowing the same procedure described in Step 1, prepare and transfer MSC-loading GH solutions into a dual syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: To assess the engraftment of MSC-loading GH hydrogels within the infarcted area, MSCs and GH conjugates were pre-labeled with PHK26 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), respectively.\nRestore the opened chest cavity and close the muscles and skin using 5-0 sutures.\n\tNOTE: Prior to chest closure, remove the air using a catheter syringe.\nRemove the tracheal tube and place the mouse in a cage under an infrared lamp during recovery.",
    "For post-operative analgesia, administer subcutaneous Ketoprofen injections (5 mg/kg per day) for a minimum of 72 h. All mice should be closely monitored for an appropriate time to ensure proper recovery after surgical procedures as well as adequate pain treatment.\n6. Echocardiography\nFour weeks following transplantation, initially anesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane and then adjust the isoflurane concentration to 1%.\nDepilate the chest using hair removal cream and place the mouse on a heating pad. Apply ultrasound transducer gel onto the chest.\nAcquire two-dimensional parasternal short axis views and record M-mode tracings at the level of the papillary muscle.\n\tNOTE: Place a linear array transducer (7‒15 MHz) in the left parasternal line and view the anatomical structures.\nMeasure corresponding lines for LVAW, LVID, and LVPW to obtain cardiac wall thickness, chamber dimension, and fractional shortening.\n\tNOTE: Compare cardiac function including the ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and end-systolic volume (ESV) at the level of the papillary muscle to ensure proper assessment at the same anatomic location.\n7. Histological evaluation\nAt the predetermined time after transplantation of MSC-loading GH hydrogels into the infarcted heart, euthanize the mouse in a CO2 chamber and collect the heart for histological analysis15.\nFor hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome (MT) staining, fix the dissected heart tissues in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and embed in paraffin. Next, cut paraffin-embedded heart blocks into 4 µm serial sections using a microtome and stain the sections with MT stain according to standard protocols17.\nAcquire images on a slide scanner at 20x magnification and calculate the infarct size of the treatment groups.\n\tInfarct size (%) = total infarct circumference / total LV circumference x 100",
    "Calculate both circumferences by midline length measurement. For LV midline circumferences, measure the centerline lengths between the endocardial and epicardial surfaces. For midline infarct circumferences, measure the lengths of infarct including more than 50 % of the whole thickness of myocardium18.\n\tNOTE: All image analyses were performed using ImageJ software.\nMeasure the wall thickness of the scar at the papillary muscle levels.\nCalculate the fraction of collagen area.\n\tCollagen area (%) = total area of interstitial fibrosis/myocyte area x 100\nSubscription Required.
