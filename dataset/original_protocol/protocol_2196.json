    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of inner dome and outer collagen matrix\nTiming: 30–45 min\nThis step is for the preparation of both the inner dome and outer matrix with the biochemical stimulant setup (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Each solution is prepared in excess.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1804-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Visual walkthrough of the 3D in vitro invasion assay\n(A) Preparation of the inner dome and outer matrix solutions in separate tubes on ice.\n(B) Plating of inner dome with embedded cancer cells. After plating, chamber slide is incubated for 20 min in a cell culture incubator set to 37°C.\n(C) Chamber slide is placed on ice while pipetting outer matrix solution. After pipetting, keep chamber slide on ice for 3 min. Incubate chamber slide for 45 min in a cell culture incubator set to 37°C.\n(D) Collagen matrices are polymerized, and invasion assay is created. Add growth media to each chamber well.\nFor the 8-well chamber slide, a total volume of 200 μL will be prepped for the inner dome and a total volume of 2 mL will be prepped for outer matrix. See Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for the starting and final concentrations and example volumes needed for inner dome and outer matrix solutions. All collagen matrices should be prepared on ice.\nNote: Initial concentrations of collagen varies based on the extraction batch from the vendor; be mindful to adjust calculations accordingly.\nNote: Matrigel may also be used for the inner dome if it is appropriate for the experimental design.\nNote: The collagen concentration may be varied for the outer matrix to modify the matrix density (See Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\nPre-chill 1.5 mL tubes and 0.1 M NaOH on ice.",
    "No-additive media is used as a diluent for collagen. Determine the volume of no-additive media needed to achieve a final collagen concentration of 1 mg/mL and a total volume to 200 μL and 2 mL for the inner dome and outer matrix, respectively. Mix the no-additive media with the corresponding collagen volumes in prechilled conical tubes.\nMix by slowly pipetting up and down, avoiding the introduction of bubbles.\nAdd PEG to conical tubes for a final concentration of 0.625 mg/mL.\nNote: PEG is a homobifunctional cross-linking reagent that mainly couples to primary amine containing molecules when buffered at pH 7.5. It is soluble in DMSO and can be kept at 20°C–22°C to thaw during collagen preparation. The PEG concentration may be varied for the outer matrix to modify the matrix stiffness (See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nAdd the chemoattractant, such as IGF1, to the outer matrix only, for a final concentration of 20 nM.\nNote: We have optimized IGF1 as effective chemoattractant for MCF7 cells, which express insulin-growth factor receptor (IGFR); other growth factors could be used based on receptor expression.\nUse pH strips to adjust the pH of collagen solutions to approximately 7. For accuracy, start with pH strips ranging 0–14 then for finer tuning use strips ranging from pH 6–8.\nNote: The phenol in phenol-containing media, such as DMEM, could be used as a pH indicator for the ‘coarse’ titration step. Around pH 7, the media will turn salmon-pink in color from a bright yellow corresponding the initial acidic pH.\nDegas the collagen solutions 10–15 min on ice. A 50 mL Steriflip-GP sterile centrifuge tube filter unit could be used to create the needed vacuum. Microfuge tubes are placed with the lid open in the 50 mL conical. Once done, close the lid to the tubes and keep on ice.",
    "Note: Degassing of both the inner dome and outer matrix for at least 10 min is important for reducing bubble formation. Without degassing, microscopic bubbles could expand during polymerization and interfere with the assay.\nNote: Rat tail collagen is optimal for this assay because it has faster gelation time than bovine collagen, which prevents the cells from settling to the bottom of the inner dome during polymerization. Rat tail collagen also polymerizes at 37°C where bovine collagen begins to polymerize at 20°C–22°C, which could lead to a variance in polymerization between chamber wells and experiments. Finally, rat tail collagen has been shown to be more in vivo-like with irregular fibrils (Muller-Rath et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: All steps involving collagen preparation must be done on ice, as the collagen solution can begin to polymerize at ambient temperatures. Furthermore, solutions used in collagen preparation must be prechilled on ice. Micropipettes do not need to be chilled.\nEmbedding cancer cells in inner dome and overlaying outer matrix\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "This section describes the process of embedding cells in the inner dome and onto the chamber slide and overlaying it with the outer matrix (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D). The following calculations are for plating two experimental conditions for MCF7 cells in four chamber wells each. Cells can be cultured in the invasion assay for up to 3–4 days, after which point, the outer matrix may begin to lift off the glass bottom of the chamber. The ideal number of cells to embed in the inner dome will depend on the cell line used, refer to Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for recommendations for optimized cell lines. Too many cells will deplete growth media quickly and may cause the inner dome to contract, resulting in separation from the outer matrix. Too few cells will compromise the quality and accuracy of the quantification of invaded cells due to a small sample size.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1804_4.csv\nTrypsinize and collect cancer cells per routine protocols.\nCalculate the total number of cells per condition to be collected. For example, MCF7 cells need 100,000 cells per inner dome, plus 50,000 for excess to account for pipetting errors.\nPellet 450,000 total cells needed for each condition in a 1.5 mL tube by centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min. Carefully aspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nBe sure to aspirate most of the media to minimize diluting the collagen during embedding.\nNote: When aspirating the media in step 10, remove as much media as possible without disturbing the cell pellet. Excess media will dilute the final concentrations of matrix in inner dome components leading to poor collagen polymerization. Note that the high cell density in itself also alters the biophysical properties of the matrix in the inner dome.",
    "Resuspend each cell pellet with 45 μL of inner dome solution while keeping the tube on ice. Ensure thorough mixing by carefully pipetting until homogeneous with care not to introduce bubbles.\nOnce mixed, plate collagen-embedded cells by pipetting 10 μL of dome solution containing cells in the following manner and as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1804-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustration of correct plating method for the inner dome in the chamber well\n(A) Inner dome with embedded cells should be plated by letting the mixture drip onto the bottom of the well by gravity.\n(B) Incorrect plating of the inner dome. Users should avoid ejecting the collagen matrix forcibly onto the coverglass-bottom the chamber well as this will result in a non-symmetrical shape.\nFully eject the contents of the pipette to form a hanging droplet and allow it to drip and contact the coverglass in the middle of the chamber well.\nAvoid touching the glass bottom with the pipette tip during this process, which might lead to uneven dispensing resulting in an asymmetrical inner dome.\nNote: The shape of the inner dome is critical. We have observed that cell invasion is altered when the inner dome is non-symmetrical (for instance tear shaped), which is consistent with previous research showing that invasion is altered by the geometrical shape of tumors (Nelson and Bissell, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Incorrect plating of inner dome droplet shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nRepeat for all chamber wells.\nCarefully place chamber slide in tissue culture incubator set at 37°C and incubate for 20 min.\nRemove chamber slide from incubator and let it cool on ice for about 5 min.",
    "Once cooled, slowly pipette 125 μL of the outer matrix in diagonally opposed corners of the chamber, to a total volume of 250 μL, then use a 20 μL pipette tip to carefully spread the outer matrix around the chamber by dragging the 20 μL pipette tip against all four chamber walls to evenly distribute the outer matrix around the inner dome.\nOnce the outer matrix has been added, keep chamber slide on ice for additional 2 min. Remove chamber slide from ice and allow to reach 20°C–22°C for about 5 min.\nNote: After overlaying the inner dome with the outer matrix on ice, the gradual transition to 37°C will affect the structure of the collagen fibers. Leaving for a longer time at 20°C–22°C before putting it in the incubator will create longer and thicker fibers.\nTransfer chamber slide to tissue culture incubator set at 37°C for 45 min.\nPipette 350 μL of the full growth media of the investigated cells, into chamber wells.\nMedia changes should be performed daily, aspirating media using a micropipette, not vacuum suction, to avoid disturbing the outer matrix.\nFor researchers performing drug treatments, drug compounds can be added to the growth media when plating.\nLive-cell imaging and analysis\nTiming: Setup 0.5 h, Run-time: 12–20 h\nThis step describes a method for live-cell imaging and analysis of invading cells into the outer matrix (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] & Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Objectives with long working distance are recommended for imaging to capture invasion into the outer matrix deeper into the 3D setup. A microscope equipped with an environmental chamber and automated stage is used for live-cell imaging of this assay. The small volume of an 8-well chamber slide format is susceptible to evaporation; therefore, users should carefully monitor media levels and ensure proper humidification in the chamber.",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1804-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of single cell tracking and invasion front measurement with SUM159 cells\n(A) Single cell tracking can be done to generate data for cell speed, trajectory, and path length.\n(B) Invasion front analysis can be done to measure the distance the dome wall invades outward. Scale bar is 100 μm.\nNote: If live-cell imaging does not apply to the cell type because invasion requires 24–72 h, the user may skip to step 36, “Sample fixation”.\nDefine the range and step size of the z-series to capture the height of the inner dome, based on the objective in use.\nFor example, with the 20× objective, a z-series range of 40–50 μm is typically sufficient to capture the inner dome and a z-step size of 1.5 μm has been used previously (Padilla-Rodriguez et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to image invading cells.\nDetermine a time course acquisition appropriate to capture the migration of cancer cells. For SUM159 cells an acquisition of 1 frame/5 min for 20 h captures the invasion from the inner dome to the outer matrix.\nUsing an image processing software, such as NIS Elements or ImageJ, manually track the invading cells to analyze their speed and directionality (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) or measure the shift of the invasion front from the initial to final time point (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Optional: Remove the chamber slide lid and fill the chamber well with serum containing media so that it contacts the 22 × 50 mm glass coverslip, allowing capillary pressure of the media to secure the coverslip to the chamber slide. This reduces evaporation of the growth media during long-term imaging. Additionally, this minimizes the meniscus of the media by reducing the concavity, thereby preventing the optical distortions that occur during brightfield imaging through an air-water interface in small volumes (Horn and Zantl, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). It is important to note that this method cannot be used with drug treatments because it will cause the drug containing media to infuse into the neighboring well.\nOptional: Stain cells with Hoechst 33342 8–12 h to allow for binary tracking instead of manual.\nNote: Acquisition parameters including exposure time, range of the z-series, z-step size, and the image acquisition interval must all be carefully considered if using fluorescent light. Fluorescent light is toxic to living cells and over exposure will result in phototoxicity.

    "The example shows a time-lapse of SUM159 cells in the in vitro invasion assay. Cells were imaged 16 h after embedding at 1 frame per 5 min for 20 h using DIC microscopy. Images were acquired with a 10× Plan Apo 0.75 NA Nikon objective on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a Photometrics CoolSNAP MYO CCD camera, environmental chamber, and motorized stage. Step 1 shows the file was cropped to 25 min increments for easier analysis. Step 2 shows the identification of ROIs. Step 3 shows the tracking of the individual cells, with an example of the data analysis.\nSee Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for time-lapse of cell tracking analysis for SUM159 cells in the in vitro invasion assay.\nLive-cell quantification using NIS elements\nTiming: Variable\nThis section describes a method to track invading cells into the outer matrix using Nikon’s NIS Element software.

    "This section describes a method to fix the chamber slide for creating a large-stitched image with a z-stack of the entire chamber well.\nPrewarm sterile 1× PBS in 37°C water bath.\nPrepare 4 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1× PBS and warm to 37°C in water bath.\nRemove chamber slide from cell culture incubator and place on a heating block set to 37°C.\nCarefully aspirate growth media from chamber wells using a micropipette and wash each chamber well with 400 μL of warm 1× PBS.\nAspirate PBS and pipette 400 μL of warm 4% PFA into each chamber well. Fix at 37°C for 10 min.\nPrepare 4 mL of a 1 μg/mL solution of DAPI in sterile 1× PBS and keep solution in the dark at 20°C–22°C.\nAspirate PFA solution and wash with 1× PBS.\nAspirate PBS and pipette 400 μL of DAPI solution into each well. Incubate 8–12 h at 4°C, keeping the chamber slide in the dark. To prevent evaporation, secure parafilm around the chamber slide.\nThe following day, aspirate DAPI solution from chamber wells and add 400 μL of 20°C–22°C 1× PBS. Can be kept in 1× PBS until imaged.\nNote: Staining of the actin cytoskeleton using fluorescently labeled Phalloidin may also be performed in parallel with DAPI.\nCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic, corrosive, and carcinogenic. All steps involving PFA should be performed in a fume hood with proper PPE. Discard PFA waste in a manner consistent with regulations.\nFixed invasion assay imaging and quantification\nTiming: Variable\nThis step describes the methodology for imaging chamber wells that have been fixed and stained with DAPI and performing image analysis.",
    "A large-stitched image is required to capture the inner dome and the surrounding outer matrix within 500 μm of the inner dome. Importantly, the z-dimension range is determined visually by moving through z at the intersection of the inner dome and outer matrix until no more cells invading into the outer matrix are visible.\nThis will vary depending on the height of the inner dome and can range from 40–80 μm.\nAcquisition of both brightfield (DIC) and fluorescence (DAPI) will be necessary for the analysis as described below.\nTo process the image stack, first generate a maximum intensity projection image using the z from the large-composite z-series of DAPI. Using the maximum projection image, generate a binary mask by thresholding the DAPI signal.\nAdjust the thresholding histogram of the DAPI channel to delineate individual nuclei of cells that have invaded into the outer matrix (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1804-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Bottom panel shows zoomed in area.\n(C) Subtract the inner dome mask from the DAPI mask to create a layer identifying all cells that have invaded into the outer matrix. Object count can be used to quantify number of invaded cells. Scale bar is 500 μm.",
    "Create a binary ROI of the entire initial inner dome using the DIC channel (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). The boundary of the inner dome can be distinguished in the DIC channel by identifying the boundary where cells transition from a cluster to invasive.\nThe chamber well can also be imaged as mentioned above after initial plating to use as a reference.\nUsing the binary operation tools, subtract the ROI of the cells within the dome from the DAPI binary mask of the invaded cells in the outer matrix (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nAdditional manual refinement of the DAPI binary mask may be necessary to segment single cells.\nQuantify the number of invaded cells by using an object count module in image processing software, such as NIS Elements or ImageJ.\nNote: To minimize XYZ drift during acquisition, acquire the images in this order: 1) acquire lambda, 2) acquire z-series, and 3) acquire large image, thereby ensuring proper alignment of brightfield and fluorescent channels across the entire large-composite z-series.\nFixed-cell analysis using NIS elements\nTiming: Variable\nThis section describes a method to quantify invading cells in the outer matrix using Nikon NIS Element software (20 h file).\nOpen large-stitched image of whole chamber well.\nCreate Maximum Intensity Projection in Z using ND Processing.\nThreshold using the DAPI channel to create a binary layer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nUse the Binary Toolbar to adjust the binary layer to cleanly identify the cells invading into the outer matrix.\nSave the binary layer.\nCreate a “Non-Invaded” binary layer by using the Binary Toolbar to draw a circle around the edge of the inner dome (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Save the “Non-Invaded” binary layer.\nCreate an “Invaded” binary layer by using the Binary Operations to subtract the “Non-invaded” binary layer from the DAPI binary layer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).",
    "Adjust the “Invaded” binary layer using the Binary Toolbar to make sure that the segmentation includes single cells. This is especially relevant for cells that invade as clusters.\nUse the “Object Count” feature to count the number of invaded cells."
