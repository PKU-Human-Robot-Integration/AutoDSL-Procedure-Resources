    "Day 1 Prepare plasmid solutionspDsRedExpress-N1: Adjust concentration to a maximum of 900 ng/µl using EB buffer. Note: The higher the plasmid concentration is, the more likely plasmids lie above each other during irradiation and irradiation becomes less effective. This results in higher DNA repair capacities in the end. Irradiate half of the volume by pipetting droplets of 40 µl into a Petri dish (10 cm diameter). Irradiate with 5 kJ/m2 UVC (254 nm) without lid of the Petri dish using Stratalinker® UV Crosslinker. After irradiation, collect droplets in a 1.5 ml reaction tube. The other half of the plasmid solution remains non-irradiated. pEGFP-N1 needs no further treatment as it serves as transfection control. The concentration of plasmid solution should be > 600 ng/µl in order to avoid too high volumes. The ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm should be ~1.8.For the measurement of DNA repair, mix 10 µg of pEGFP-N1 and 30 µg of irradiated pDsRedExpress-N1. For calculation of the correction factor, mix 10 µg of pEGFP-N1 and 30 µg of non-irradiated pDsRedExpress-N1 for each electroporation. Note that the volumes needed depend on the concentration of the plasmid solutions. Adjust the volume of the mixture to 100 µl using EB buffer. Prepare enough plasmid-DNA mixtures for the entire study planned. Store mixtures at 4 °C for short-term storage or at -80 °C for longer periods.Isolate PBMCs from 12 ml of human blood using LeucosepTM tubes according to the manufacturer’s instructions as follows:Dilute 12 ml anticoagulated blood 1:2 using 0.9% NaCl solution (24 ml final volume) and transfer into LeucosepTM tubes.Centrifugate at 1,000 x g for 10 min in a swinging bucket rotor and switch off brakes. Figure 1A shows the LeucosepTM tube before centrifugation and Figure 1B shows the tube after centrifugation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731013505_6896.jpgFigure 1.",
    "LeucosepTM tube before and after centrifugation. A. LeucosepTM tube filled with anticoagulated blood, which was previously diluted 1:2 with 0.9% NaCl solution. B. LeucosepTM tube after density gradient centrifugation. The different layer can be seen clearly from top to bottom: plasma, enriched cells, separation medium, the porous barrier, again separation medium and finally erythrocytes and granulocytes.Pipet approximately 10 ml of plasma from the top in order to reach the enriched cell fraction more easily.Harvest the enriched cell fraction using a 1,000 µl Eppendorf pipette and transfer cells into a 50 ml centrifuge tube.Wash cells with 10 ml PBS and centrifuge at 250 x g for 10 min.Repeat the washing step two times each with 5 ml PBS. When adding 5 ml for the second time, count cells using a Neubauer counting chamber.For each electroporation, fill 3 ml PBMC medium per well into a 6-well cell culture plate.Centrifuge 2 x 106 cells at 250 x g for 10 min in a 15 ml centrifuge tube for each electroporation. Prepare two tubes in order to be able to calculate DNA repair capacity of one sample properly. One tube will contain the irradiated pDsRedExpress-N1 and pEGFP-N1 and the other one the non-irradiated pDsRedExpress-N1 and pEGFP-N1. Resuspend pellet in 150 µl RPMI media without phenol red.Add 100 µl of the previously prepared plasmid mixture to the cell suspension, so that the suspension contains 10 µg pEGFP-N1 and 30 µg pDsRedExpress-N1 (either irradiated or non-irradiated).Transfer 250 µl of the cell suspension to electroporation cuvettes with 4 mm gap, place it into the shocking chamber of Gene Pulser II and start electroporation at 400 V and 500 µF. Note: Always electroporate one irradiated batch and one non-irradiated batch directly one after the other.",
    "These two will be used to calculate the DNA repair capacity of one sample. Transfer electroporation batches in the order of electroporation into the prepared 6-well cell culture plate containing RPMI medium.Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5 % CO2 and relative humidity of 95%.Day 2 Prepare one 1.5 ml reaction tube for each electroporation approach.Mix cells in the wells of the cell culture plate using a 1,000 µl Eppendorf pipette before transferring 1.5 ml of the cell suspension into the 1.5 ml reaction tubes prepared previously. Centrifuge at 250 x g for 10 min. Remove 1.4 ml of the supernatant, resuspend cells in the remaining 100 µl, and transfer into 0.5 ml FACS tubes.Place the 0.5 ml tube into a 5 ml tube and carry out FACS analysis using 488 nm laser."
