    "The number of different 21-mer siRNNs that can be synthesized from only the published phosphotriester groups outnumbers the number of atoms in the universe by several orders of magnitude (Meade et al., 2014). No single siRNN configuration will be the most effective for all situations. The optimal positioning, type, and number of phosphotriester groups composing a siRNN should be determined for conjugation with a particular delivery or targeting domain and delivery into target cells or tissues. In this protocol, we focus on conjugation, purification, and cellular delivery of duplexed siRNNA4 oligonucleotides with a TAT Delivery Domain (DD) peptide as described in Meade et al. (2014) (Figure 2).siRNN conjugation and purificationSet up the following conjugation reaction in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube in 50% ACN /50% ultrapure water (Note 2):1x siRNN conjugation buffer5.25 M acetic acid50 uM siRNNA4 1 mM DD-Hynic peptide (Note 3)Incubate reaction for 1 h at RT (Note 4).After 1 h, freeze the conjugation solution in crushed dry ice.Lyophilize the frozen conjugation solution until dry (Note 5).Once dry, dissolve the lyophilized pellet in 500 μl of ultrapure water by pipetting.Load 500 μl of crude DD-siRNN conjugate into a Amicon Ultra 0.5 ml centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel-30 membrane.Centrifuge the filled filter unit for 5 min at 14,000 x g.Discard flow-through.Add 450 μl of ultrapure water to the remaining liquid in the filter unit and pipette to mix.Repeat steps A7-9 two more times.Centrifuge the filled filter unit for 10 min at 14,000 x g.Invert the filter unit into a fresh collection tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g to elute purified DD-siRNN conjugate.Measure the absorbance of the purified DD-siRNN conjugate at 260 nm on a UV spectrophotometer.",
    "Determine the concentration of the purified DD-siRNN conjugate using the measured absorbance at 260 nm and the duplexed siRNN molar extinction coefficient (Notes 6 and 7). Dilute the purified DD-siRNN conjugate to the desired concentration with ultrapure water. Store DD-siRNN conjugate at -20 °C (Note 8).Analysis of DD-siRNN conjugationPurchase or cast 1.5 mm 0.4% SDS 10% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gels with 10 or 15-well combs (Note 9).Aliquot 0.1 nmol of purified DD-siRNN conjugates to be analyzed in fresh microcentrifuge tubes (Note 10).Freeze samples on crushed dry ice and lyophilize until dry (Notes 11 and 12).Once dry, dissolve lyophilized samples in 5 μl of 1x 0.4% SDS non-denaturing loading buffer by pipetting (Note 13). Place polymerized gels into the gel running apparatus and fill with 0.4% SDS-PAGE running buffer. Gently remove the combs from the gels and clean out the wells by forcefully pipetting running buffer into the empty wells.Load samples dissolved in loading buffer into wells of the gel and run at 200 V constant for 30 min or until the dye front runs off the gel.Once the gel has finished running, carefully separate the glass cassette and remove the gel. Deposit the gel in a small dish for staining.Rinse the gel several times with deionized water to remove running buffer (Note 14).Add 50-100 ml of deionized water to the staining dish and incubate the gel at room temperature on a rocker for 20 min (Note 15).Discard the wash and rinse the gel with deionized water.Conduct silver stain as described in the SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit protocol under “Basic Staining Protocol” (Notes 16 and 17).Image silver-stained gels on a Gel Doc to determine degree of conjugation and purity of samples (Figure 2B).DD-siRNN cellular transduction and analysisCulture cells in desired media.",
    "For this protocol, H1299 cells stably expressing a destabilized EGFP (H1299-dGFP) were cultured in high glucose DMEM media, supplemented with 5% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Rinse H1299 cells in PBS, trypsinize H1299 cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min, add growth media, and gently pipet up and down to dissociate cells from the culture dish.Centrifuge cells in bench centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g.Discard supernatant, rinse cells in Opti-MEM, and centrifuge cells for 5 min at 200 x g.Resuspend cells in fresh Opti-MEM and dilute cells to 5 x 105 cells/ml with Opti-MEM.For each cell treatment, dilute DD-siRNN conjugates in 150 μl of fresh Opti-MEM (recommended final concentration of 50-500 nM). Transfer 150 μl of DD-siRNN dilution into a fresh well on a 24-well cell culture plate.Add 150 μl of H1299 cells (5 x 105 cells/ml) to wells containing diluted DD-siRNNs for a final concentration of 75,000 cells/well. Mix by carefully pipetting up and down several times.Incubate transductions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h.At the end of the transduction time, aspirate off the treatment media and replace it with culture media (Note 18).After 24 h, trypsinize the transduced cells and split into three equal portions. Use two portions to seed fresh 24-well plates for later analysis of 48 and 72 h time-points.Analyze the final portion of cells on a flow cytometer to measure siRNN-induced knockdown of GFP (Figure 3A-B) (Note 19)."
