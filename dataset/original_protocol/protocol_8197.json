    "All methods described here were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals provided by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.\nAll tools and equipment for the methods are shown in Figure 1 and listed in the Table of Materials.\n1 . Mouse eye enucleation, eye cup dissection, and embedding\nEuthanize mice with carbon dioxide (CO2) followed by either decapitation (postnatal mice P0 - P11) or cervical dislocation (adult >P11 mice). For P0-P14 mice, eyes are covered by skin. Ensure to remove the skin prior to subsequent steps.\nMark the temporal part of the eye (Figure 2A) by slightly burning the cornea using a tail cauterizer. Avoid burning a hole in the cornea by touching the cornea very lightly and for no more than a split second with the cauterizer.\nImmediately enucleate mouse eyes using curved Dumont #5/45 forceps. Incubate for 15 min in a 1.5 mL cryotube tube with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice.\nAfter 15 min in 4% PFA, transfer the fixed eye using the curved forceps Dumont #5/45 to a modified 35 mm dissection dish (see Table of Materials and Figure 1C) filled with PBS and place under dissecting microscope.\nMake a small incision at the burn mark, perpendicular to and just above the limbus (border of the cornea) using the micro knife.\nInsert the curved scissors into the incision and perform a circumferential cut of the cornea following the limbus (Figure 2B).",
    "Remove the cornea and extract the lens with a thin Dumont #5 forceps, (Figure 2B) and lift it delicately away from the posterior portion of the eye. The vitreous body, the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina, will come out with the lens (Figure 2B) and the retina will be visible as a white surface covering the inside of the posterior eye cup. Ensure that there is no visible damage to the retina, such as holes or tears (Figure 2C).\nWash the eye cups twice in 1 mL of PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nCryoprotect the eye cups by equilibrating them in a solution of 15% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C until the eye cup sinks\nTransfer the eye cups to 30% sucrose in PBS for 2-3 h until the eye cup sinks.\nEmbed the eye cups in OCT in 10 x 10 mm cryomolds (Figure 3A). Using a dissecting microscope, orient the eye in the cryomold along its dorsal-ventral axis (Figure 2D, Figure 3A) by rotating the eye until the burn mark is on top, the optic nerve is on the left and the cut-out part of the mold faces the right (Figure 2D). Take care to avoid bubbles near the tissue.\n\tNOTE: To manipulate the eye cup, use a titanium probe made of a titanium wire attached to a pipette tip.\nTo snap-freeze retinal tissue, immerse the cryomold for at least 5 min in a metal beaker containing isopentane and place the beaker in liquid nitrogen or dry ice/100% ethanol bath (up to 1/3 of the height of the metal beaker).\n\tNOTE: The cryomold should be immersed in isopentane to greater than half of its height but does not have to be completely submerged.",
    "Remove the frozen block and wrap it in aluminum foil.\nStore at -80 °C.\nMark the frozen block using a pen or sharpie to record the orientation of the block (Figure 3B).\n2 . Sectioning using a cryostat\nAfter adjusting the cryostat temperature (between -20 and -25 °C), allow the molds containing the embedded eye cups to equilibrate to the cryostat temperature for 1 h.\nInstall the block with dorso-ventral orientation (Figure 3C) and cut 10 µm thick serial sections. Carefully place the retinal sections on annotated and numbered microscope slides.\nStore slides in slide boxes at -20 °C or -80 °C until IHC procedures.\n3 . Fluorescence immunostaining using the Slide Rack\nNOTE: The Slide Rack system (e.g., Sequenza) holds the glass microscope slides with a cover plate, creating a ~100 µL capillary gap between the slide and the plate.\nThaw the cryo-sections at room temperature (RT) for 2 h to 4 h to allow them to dry and attach to microscope slides.\n\tNOTE: It is also possible to dry them at 30-37 °C for 30 min to 1 h.\nPlace slides in Slide Rack and wash the retinal sections twice in 100-200 µL PBS for 2 min.\nPermeabilize the retinal sections by incubating them in 0.25% Triton-X / 0.05% NaN3in PBS for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 100 µL of blocking solution to the slides.\nAdd 100 µL of primary antibody diluted in blocking solution to the slides.\nIncubate retinal sections overnight at 4 ˚C.\n\tNOTE: During this time, cover the Slide Rack to avoid desiccation of the sections.\nWash the retinal sections 3 times, each for 15 min, using 200 µL PBS.\n\tNOTE: The addition of 0.001- 0.002% Triton-X100 to PBS (PBS-T) allow a more stringent wash but can disrupt some membranes and cellular structures.",
    "Incubate retinal sections in fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. From now on protect from light.\nWash the retinal sections 3 times, each for 15 min.\nIncubate the retinal sections at RT for 5 min with a nuclear marker such as Hoechst 33342 or DAPI solution.\nWash the retinal sections 1 time for 15 min.\nPlace a coverslip on top of a paper towel on the lab bench.\nAdd 2 drops of anti-fading mounting media to the center of the coverslip.\nTurn the slide over to have the retinal cryo-section facing down.\nCarefully mount the coverslip slowly, at a ~45˚ angle, tip the slide onto the mounting media.\n\tNOTE: Avoiding forming bubbles as you lower the slide in place.\nApply even pressure, using a heavy book or catalog (see below), to the slide-coverslip combination to eliminate excess mounting media.\n\tNOTE: To ensure consistency in sample preparation, always use the same object, (i.e., the same book or catalog) to apply even pressure to the coverslip during slide mounting.\nKeep flat and allow to harden overnight at RT in the dark. Store slides flat at 4 °C indefinitely.\nImage via wide field or confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
