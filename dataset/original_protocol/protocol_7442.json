    "Purification of Arp2/3 complex Construction of expression vector: Sub-clone the full-length open reading frames of seven subunits of human Arp2/3-ArpC1a-ArpC5 complex into pCAG vectors. To facilitate protein purification, add two strep-tags to the N-termini of ArpC1a (Doolittle et al., 2013a and 2013b).Cell transfection: Grow HEK293F cells in SMM 293-TII expression medium to a density of 1.5–1.8 million cells per milliliter. Transiently transfect the plasmids to HEK293F cells using PEI.

    "To initiate branched actin polymerization, add 1 μM actin (50% Oregon-green labeled), 100 nM Arp2/3 complex, 600 nM CapZ, and 300 nM PWCA to a tube, then add TIRF buffer for a 50 μL mixed solution in total.Carefully transfer 10 μL of mixed solution to the center of a Lab Tek Chambered cover glass.In the focal plane of the chamber, robust branched actin polymerization can be observed by TIRF microscopy.Add 10 μM Myo1D to the solution and continue TIRF imaging.Add 0.5 μM mCherry-p62 and 3 μM Ub8 to the solution and continue TIRF imaging.The reconstituted p62 body can also be examined by scanning electron microscopy. For the conventional fixation procedure, grow p62 bodies on coverslips, fix with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer for 2 h at room temperature, wash three times with PBS buffer, and then post-fix with 1% osmium for 20 min at room temperature.

Coat the dried samples with an approximately 5 nm thick gold film by sputter coating before examination with focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy using a Helios detector at an acceleration voltage of 2.0 kV (Rong et al., 2012).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4656/bioprotoc-13-08-4656-g001.jpgFigure 1.
