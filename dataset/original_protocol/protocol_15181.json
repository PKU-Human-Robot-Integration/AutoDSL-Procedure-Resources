    "The overall scheme of the experiment including the preparation of primary single-cells from tumor tissue, characterization of the primary cell culture, fibroblast depletion and magnetic cell sorting of CD133+ and CD133- melanoma cells is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Sample Acquisition\nCheck for ethical approval before considering the next steps.\nPrepare a 50 ml tube with sterile PBS supplemented with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin final concentration and hand over to surgery OR team.\nOrganize fast transport of tumor tissue from surgery to cell culture lab at 4 °C.\n2. Preparing Primary Melanoma Single-cells from Tumor Tissue\nPerform all steps under sterile conditions.\nBefore resecting the tumor, one needs to prepare the dissociation mix. 10 ml dissociation mix per 2-4 g tissue is required. The mix can be used immediately or stored in 10 ml aliquots at -20 °C for later use.\n\t\nPrepare a solution containing 150 mM sodium chloride. Mix using a vortex until the solution is clear. If necessary sterile-filtrate sodium chloride solution using a 0.22 μm filter.\nWeigh out DNase I and prepare a solution containing 10 mg/ml DNase I in 150mM sodium chloride. Mix by inverting until the solution is clear.\nPrepare a solution containing 100mg/ml Collagenase IV in PBS. Mix by inverting until the solution is clear. Aliquots of collagenase solution can be stored at -20 °C for several months.\nPrepare the dissociation mix with a final concentration of 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 1 mg/ml Collagenase IV and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I in Quantum 263 medium. Mix using a vortex. Optional: when using melanoma tissue derived from skin add Amphotericin B solution to the dissociation mix to a final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml Amphotericin B.\nPre-warm the required amounts of dissociation mix, PBS and Quantum 263 medium to 37 °C.",
    "Place tumor tissue on a sterile Petri dish. Aspirate excessive solution from the tissue and add 500 μl dissociation mix. Mince tumor into small pieces of 2-4 mm using fresh, sterile scalpels.\nTransfer 2-4 g minced tumor tissue into a gentleMACS C Tube containing 5 ml dissociation mix. Rinse Petri dish with additional 4.5 ml dissociation mix and add remaining tissue fragments to the gentleMACS C Tube.\nClose gentleMACS C tube and attach it upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Dissociator. Run the gentleMACS program \"h_tumor_01\".\nDetach the gentleMACS C tube from the dissociator and incubate the sample for 30 min at 37 °C under continuous rotation using the MACSmix Tube Rotator on the highest run speed (12 rpm) or by turning the tube manually every 5 min to resuspend settled tissue fragments.\nAttach gentleMACS C tube upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Dissociator and run the gentleMACS program \"h_tumor_02\".\nDetach the gentleMACS C tube from the dissociator and incubate the sample for 30 min at 37 °C under continuous rotation using the MACSmix Tube Rotator on the highest run speed (12 rpm) or by turning the tube manually every 5 min to resuspend settled tissue fragments.\nAttach gentleMACS C tube upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Dissociator and run the gentleMACS program \"h_tumor_03\".\nDetach the gentleMACS C tube from the dissociator, resuspend sample and apply the cell suspension to a 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 50 ml tube. If clogging of the filter occurs, stir cell suspension with a sterile filter tip until the complete suspension ran through.\nRinse cell strainer with 5 ml Quantum 263 medium.",
    "Optional: if you still have tissue fragments left in the filter, resuspend fragments in Quantum 263 medium and seed them in an appropriate cell culture dish. Incubate fragments at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nDiscard cell strainer and close the 50 ml tube with the digested cell suspension. Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 300 x g and discard supernatant.\nOptional: if cell pellet appears red due to a high amount of erythrocytes prepare 1x Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution by diluting 10x solution 1:10 in double-distilled water, resuspend cell pellet in 500 μl PBS and add 5 ml 1x Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution. Vortex 5 sec and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and discard supernatant.\nResuspend tumor cells with Quantum 263 and seed the cells in appropriate cell culture flask. Culture tumor cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and routinely passage cells when they reach 80% confluence.\n3. Characterization of Primary Cell Culture and Fibroblast Depletion\nAnalyze primary cell culture phenotypically using a microscope.\nHarvest a small amount (0.5x 106 cells) of the primary cell culture and perform RT-PCR with primers for neoplastic-, melanoma-, stem cell- and stroma cell marker genes. The most important genes to analyze are CD90 (fibroblast marker), TYR (melanoma/melanocyte marker), CD133 (cancer stem cell marker), CD83 (marker for mature dendritic cells) and a housekeeping gene (e.g. HPRT or GAPDH).\nIf microscopic analysis and high expression of CD90 during RT-PCR revealed a high contamination of the primary melanoma culture with fibroblasts, you need to deplete fibroblasts using the Anti-Fibroblasts MicroBeads and D Columns from Miltenyi.\n4. Magnetic Cell Sorting of CD133+ and CD133- Melanoma Cells Using LS Columns",
    "Prepare MACS buffer containing 2 mM EDTA and 5% FCS in PBS. Mix by inverting and sterile-filtrate buffer using a 0.22 μm Steritop-GP Filter Unit. Chill buffer to 4-8 °C and degas before use.\nPre-warm Accutase, PBS and Quantum 263 medium to 37 °C.\nWash 80% confluent cells with PBS. Add appropriate amount of Accutase and incubate until cells detach from the culture surface. Collect cells in a 50 ml tube using Quantum 263 medium.\nDetermine the cell number and centrifuge the required number of cells (According to Miltenyi's protocol a maximum number of 2x 109 cells can be loaded per LS Column. Cell line specific optimal numbers should be determined and can be considerably lower.) for 5 min at 300 x g and 4-8 °C. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nResuspend a maximum of 1x 108 cells with 350 μl MACS buffer (for higher cell numbers scale up all following MACS buffer, FcR Blocking Reagent, CD133/1-Biotin and anti-Biotin MicroBeads volumes accordingly).\nAdd 100 μl FcR Blocking Reagent.\nAdd 50 μl CD133/1-Biotin. Mix well using a vortex and incubate at 4-8 °C for 10 min.\nWash cells by adding 10 ml MACS buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and 4-8 °C. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nRepeat washing step (4.8)\nResuspend cell pellet with 400 μl MACS buffer.\nAdd 100 μl anti-Biotin MicroBeads. Mix well using a vortex and incubate at 4-8 °C for 15 min.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the MACS separator for the magnetic separation. Attach QuadroMACS to MACS Separator Multi Stand. Insert the required number of LS columns with the column wings to the front in the magnetic field of the QuadroMACS. Place a Pre-Separation Filter (with 30 μm nylon mesh) into each LS column and an appropriate collection tube (15 ml or 50 ml) under each column. Prepare filter and column by rinsing with 3 ml MACS buffer. Discard flow-through.\nWash cells by adding 10 ml MACS buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and 4-8 °C. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nResuspend cells with 500 μl MACS buffer and apply cell suspension onto the LS column with the Pre-Separation Filter.\nWash three times with 3 ml MACS buffer per column. Only add new buffer when the column reservoir is empty.\nThe collected total effluent contains the unlabelled CD133- cell fraction.\nDiscard the Pre-Separation Filter, remove column from the separator and place it on a suitable collection tube.\nApply 5 ml MACS buffer. Immediately flush out the labelled CD133+ cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the column.\nTo increase the purity of the negative fraction, apply cell suspension onto a new equilibrated LS column inserted in the QuadroMACS. The effluent contains the CD133- fraction.\nDiscard columns.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
