    "1. Setup and Prerequisites\nPerform the multi-color smFRET measurements on a prism-type TIRFM. A description of a two-color setup as a JoVE publication is given in reference12.\n\t\nConstruct a multi-color TIRFM. A general layout is detailed in 9.\nUse switchable, diode pumped solid state continuous wave lasers, which render the use of mechanical shutters in the excitation paths unnecessary.\nEmploy an asymmetric, elongated prism that prevents the back reflection of the excitation beam from the rear side to enter the objective.\nUse 2-inch achromatic aspheric fused silica lenses in the detection paths that collect as much light as possible and prevent auto-fluorescence and aberrations, e.g., distortions in off-center regions of the image.\nFocus each detection path on the chip of the EMCCD with a separate lens. This allows optimal focusing of each detection channel.\nCaution: Class 3B lasers are used in the TIRFM. This means they are hazardous if the eye is exposed directly, but diffuse reflections are not harmful. Ensure compliance with laser safety precautions according to local government regulations before the system is operated.\nDetermine the correction factors for setup and fluorophore properties beforehand using dsDNA samples.\n\t\nUse one high-FRET dsDNA sample for each dye in combination with the acceptor having the longest excitation wavelength (for the presented setup: Atto488-Atto647N, Atto550-Atto647N, Atto594-Atto647N). Make sure that the DNA is additionally modified with a biotin.\nDilute the sample to 5 nM with TNM buffer (5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2) and 2 mM Trolox (use this buffer also for measurement).\nImmobilize the dsDNA as described for Hsp90 in steps 2.5 and 2.7.\nCalculate the correction factors for apparent leakage (lk) and apparent gamma (ag) from single-molecule traces that show an acceptor bleaching event.",
    "Construct a flow chamber that is a sandwich of a PEG/biotin-PEG passivated quartz slide, a thin film that is adhesive on both sides, and a cover slip. For detail protocols for the cleaning of the quartz slides and passivation see reference9.\n\t\nUse thick (3 mm) quartz slides to geometrically prevent the collection of laser light scattered at the quartz-glycerol-quartz interface between the prism and the functionalized quartz slide.\nUse a thin (40 µm) sealing film that is sprayed with adhesive on the non-adhesive side. The thin film reduces the distance between the surface-attached molecules and objective. Heat to 80 °C and press on.\nPlace a cover slip on the top. Heat to 80 °C and press on. Use a drop of glycerol when placing the flow chamber over the prism.\n\t\tNOTE: The materials of the prism and the quartz slides as well as the glycerol are index-matched.\nExpress Hsp90 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the form of two single cysteine point mutants at the positions D61 or Q385. Add a C-terminal coiled-coil motif to prevent dimer dissociation at picomolar concentrations. Label the mutant proteins separately and exchange the monomers to obtain heterodimers labeled with Atto488 at amino acid position 61 and Atto550 at amino acid position 3859.\n2. Measurement\nStart the camera software and set the imaging parameters as specified below:\n\t\nSet the temperature for the sensor cooling as low as possible (-95 °C with external water cooling) to decrease the dark current noise.\nUse camera settings that are optimized for single-molecule recording: 3.3 µs vertical shift speed, normal vertical clock voltage, 17 MHz 16-bit horizontal read out, pre-amplification gain 3, gain of electron multiplier 1,000.\nSet the triggering of the acquisition to \"External\" and the exposure time to 70 ms. Record movies with a length of 750 acquisition cycles.",
    "NOTE: Turn off the room light when the camera is acquiring to prevent saturation of the EMCCD sensor.\nCreate a folder on the local SSD for the measurement. In the software settings go to the <Auto-Save> rider, enable <Auto-save>, and choose file format \"Tiff\" for movie acquisition. Select the folder on the SSD as auto-save location.\nStart the software that controls the acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF), the software that controls the operation of the lasers and the trigger software that synchronizes the lasers, AOTF, shutters in the detection path, and cameras. Adjust the laser power with the AOTF (ca. 3 mW before entering the prism) and load the correct triggering pattern.\nMount the sample holder with the prism and the flow chamber, attach tubing, place the inlet tubing in a microcentrifuge cup, and connect the outlet tubing to a syringe pump. Flush the chamber with approximately 150 µL buffer, align the excitation beam, and focus. Bleach any fluorescent contaminants on the surface by slowly moving along the complete detection range of the slide with a laser power of about 10 mW for all lasers. This takes about 1 h.\n\tNOTE: If not stated otherwise, the used buffer contains 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2.\nFlush approximately 300 µL of a NeutrAvidin solution (0.25 mg/mL in buffer) into the chamber and incubate for 1 min. Flush out unbound NeutrAvidin with buffer and flush approximately 300 µL of a BSA solution (0.5 mg/mL in buffer) through the chamber.\n\tNOTE: This block remaining surface functionalization defects by unspecific adsorption of BSA to the surface.",
    "Immobilize the sample by loading the flow chamber with approximately 150 µL of the biotinylated and labeled Hsp90 at rising concentrations (diluted in buffer + 0.5 mg/mL BSA) until a sufficient surface density is reached, which is usually the case at a concentration of 5 - 10 pM. Wash out unbound protein with approximately 300 µL buffer + 0.5 mg/mL BSA.\nFlush in 150 µL of 25 nM AMP-PNP* in buffer + 0.5 mg/mL BSA. Let it incubate for 5 min and repeat this step once to ensure correct nucleotide concentration.\n\tNOTE: For experiments in the presence of additional, unlabeled AMP-PNP, also add 250 µM AMP-PNP.\nBegin with the data acquisition. For an appropriate amount of data acquire approximately 20 movies which takes about 1.5 h.\n\t\nMove the position of the sample chamber perpendicular to the excitation beam with a piezo stepper to change the field of view.\nAdjust the focus with the z-piezo that controls the height of the objective if needed. This should not be necessary too often when the measurement chamber is mounted without inclination.\nPrepare the recording of the cameras by pressing <Take Signal> in the camera software and start the excitation/acquisition cycles using the <Start> button in the trigger software. This starts the acquisition of the fluorescence intensity.\nPerform a channel registration by first recording a movie with fluorescent beads that show fluorescence emission in the spectral range of all detection channels of the setup. Then, detect bead positions in the calibration movie by searching for the brightest spots and determine the central position from a Gaussian fit to the intensity profile. Save the coordinates of beads that are found in all channels and fit both the mapping offset in x- and in y-direction with a 2D polynomial of degree three9.",
    "3. Selection of Single-molecule Traces\nData analysis is done with in-house scripts using Igor Pro. Load all necessary scripts by opening \"iniTIRF.ipf\" and select the correct type of experiment.\n\tNOTE: In the following, <Button> specifies clickable elements in the menu or the user interface. Function calls are indicated in quotes, e.g., \"Print \"Hello World\"\". These commands can be pasted to the command line of Igor Pro (without the enclosing quotes).\nMake sure the parameters for the detection channel registration are loaded.\nStart the GUI by clicking <smFRET new|Analysis GUI>.\nLoad the movies (i.e., the sequence of frames with 512 x 512 pixels stored as 16 bit TIFF stacks) that hold the intensity in the respective channels. Do this by pressing the <Load Film> button and selecting the files from the so-called \"master\" and \"slave\" cameras one after the other.\nIdentify the positions of potential single molecules by searching for the brightest spots in the sum of the first five frames in a certain detection channel. Calculate the corresponding positions in all other detection channels from the channel mapping. To obtain the fluorescence intensity trace, sum the intensity of a pixel square around the central position for each frame. Do this by pressing the button <Find Traces> in the GUI.\n\tNOTE: The side length of the square (in pixel) is given by: 2 * <Sum Pxs> + 1.\nFor each molecule, calculate a joint raw intensity trace as the sum of all traces of this spot with the same excitation color. Evaluate the intensity profile of the molecule in all channels for the following criteria:",
    "A roughly flat plateau in the joint raw intensity and a single bleaching step for all excitation colors, anticorrelated behavior in the appropriate detection channels, detection of red fluorescence (indicating FRET to a bound AMP-PNP*) at least once within the trace, and no multiple steps in the red fluorescence, which would indicate the presence of two AMP-PNP* bound to one Hsp90 dimer.\nSave the fluorescence traces of the spot for further analysis if these criteria are fulfilled. Do this by selecting the trace with the cursor and then pressing the <Save> button in the \"timelines\" graph. Manually inspect the intensity traces in all three detection channels after blue excitation for about 200 molecules per movie.\n4. Calculation of the Partial Fluorescence Traces\nDisplay all fluorescence intensity traces for one of the saved molecules. Use the cursors in the graph to select time ranges.\nSelect a time interval where all fluorophores are bleached already. The mean background intensity is calculated from this range and subtracted from the intensity trace in each channel. Do this by pressing the <Background> button.\nSelect the FRET efficiency range, where at least both the dyes attached to Hsp90 (Atto488 and Atto550) are present. Make sure to exclude traces that contain a blinking event (see Figure 3B). These events are characterized by a drop-in fluorescence intensity in one channel without an accompanying increase in any other channel.\nCalculate the PF traces. Do this by pressing the <PF Calc> button. The predefined correction factors for apparent leakage (lk) and apparent gamma (ag) are applied to the raw intensity in order to correct for photo-physical and setup properties.\n5. Population Selection and 3D Histogram Fitting",
    "Remove molecules that show a low signal-to-noise ratio in the PF traces. Molecules that exceed the interval [-1;2] in any PF trace for more than 10% of the frames are removed from the data set. Do this by executing \"RemoveTracesLowSNR()\" from the Command Window.\nCalculate binned 2D projections of the PF data. Plot imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56896/56896eq12.jpgover imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56896/56896eq13v2.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56896/56896eq14.jpg over imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56896/56896eq13v2.jpg in the range [-0.5; 1.5] with a resolution of 100 x 100 bins. To do so, execute:\n\t\n\"HistFret2D(\"r_b\", \"r_g\", binHist=100)\"\n\"HistFret2D(\"r_b\", \"g_b\", binHist=100); MoveWindow 553.5, 42.5, 1055.25, 508.25\"\nDetermine the relative population of each distinguishable state in the 2D projections.\n\t\nBring the appropriate graph to the front and execute \"panelHist2DCount()\".\nPress the <Init> button and draw a free-hand polygon around the peak.\nClick the <Count> button. The number of data points in the polygon and the total number of data points in the projection are printed in the Command Window.\nPrepare a 3D histogram of the PF data by executing \"HistFret3D(\"g_b\", \"r_b\", \"r_g\")\".\nNormalize the 3D histogram to an integral of 1. Execute the following:\n\t\n\"NewDataFolder/S fit0\"\n\"Duplicate/O ::FRET:Hist3D, Hist3D\"\n\"Variable /G div = sum(Hist3D)*(DimDelta(Hist3D,0))^3\"\n\"Hist3D /= div; Print div\"\nProvide initial parameters for the 3D Gaussian fit and prepare necessary data structures.\n\t\nExecute \"Gauss3D_initParam(); edit W_coef_old.\"\nAdd the state populations to the end of the parameter vector.\nExecute \"Gauss3D_prepareFit().\"\nNote: W_coef_old is a vector that holds the initial parameters for the fit. Per state this means imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56896/56896eq15.jpg and the state population, which is concatenated at the end of the vector. Make sure that the covariance matrix is symmetric.\nFit the sum of S 3D Gaussian functions to the 3D PF histogram, with S being the number of distinguishable states.",
    "Execute \"do3D().\" This may take an hour or more on a normal office PC, depending on the quality of the initial parameters.\nExecute \"postprocessFitMultiGauss3D(); evalFitMultiGauss3D(); edit W_coef.\"\nDisplay the fit result. For each of the two 2D projections, use the following commands:\n\t\n\"contourPF3D_new(0); contourPF3D_new(1); contourPF3D_new(2); contourPF3D_new(3); contourPF3D_new(4)\"\n\"contourPF3D_colorize()\"        \n6. Kinetic Analysis with 3D Ensemble HMM\nPrepare an ensemble HMM run to extract the kinetic information. One HMM is optimized from all molecules in the data set. Use the information obtained in the previous step to define the position and width of each state in the 3D PF space.\n\t\nInitialize the HMM user interface (<HMM|Init HMM>) and choose the appropriate number of states (in the case of the Hsp90 data this means <NumStates> = 5), number of dimensions of the input signal (<NumDims> = 3), and the type of the input (<Input Type> = \"FRET 3D bgr\").\nOptimize the parameters of the HMM by letting the software converge the likelihood of the HMM (execute \"prepENS_CONVERGE_gB(GetDataFolder(1), -14)\") until the change in the transition matrix compared to the previous iteration falls below a threshold (10-14 for the sum of the absolute change for each transition probability). This yields the MLE for the transition probabilities in about an hour on a normal office PC.\nRepeat the population selection, Gaussian fitting, and the HMM optimization for subsets of the data (e.g., 75% of the full data set). If the full data set was merged from different experiments, repeat the optimization also for each of the single experiments. Analysis of subsets permits to estimate the uncertainty of the manual population selection and the variability within the data set.\nCalculate the CI for the transition probabilities, which report on the data set heterogeneity and the precision of the HMM.",
    "Get a rough estimate of the CI bounds by executing \"cd $(root:path3Dimport + \"HMM\"); loop_getCI_estimate_limits().\"\nCalculate the exact limits of the CI by executing:\n\"loop_getCI_HMM_converge(1)\"\n\"CIresults_conv_new()\"\n\"cd ::HMM_CIresult; reportCI_conv()\"\n\"cd ::cmp_CI_conv; CI_plot2(\"HMM\", doAppend=0)\"\nCondense the available kinetic information to simplify the interpretation.\n\t\nCollect information about the time a labeled nucleotide stays bound to Hsp90. Do this by collapsing the states that are bound to AMP-PNP* (i.e., S1, S2 and S3, see also Figure 2) and compile the dwell time histogram. Execute \"cd $(root:path3Dimport +\"HMM\"); collapse_states_get_DT({0,1,1,1,0})\", which combines dwells of states S0 and S4 as well as S1, S2, and S3.\nExtract the dwell times from the Viterbi path for each state of interest and compare the resulting dwell time histogram for different experimental conditions. Execute \"plot_collapsed_DT_Hist (wDTo_01110_record1).\"\nFor a more detailed picture, collapse states that have distinct PF but are functionally identical to ease the further data analysis, e.g., in the case of a three-color experiment with labeled Hsp90 and nucleotide, states S2 and S3 can be collapsed. Execute \"collapse_states_get_DT({0,1,2,2,4}).\"\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
