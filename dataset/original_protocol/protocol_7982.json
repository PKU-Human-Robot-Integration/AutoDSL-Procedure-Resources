    "All animal studies were approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Gait apparatus\nNOTE: Modeled from the MouseWalker14, the RatWalker was designed with dimensions in proportion to the difference in step length between rats and mice. It consists of a side illumination backlight, walkway enclosure, optical waveguide walkway, mirror, and camera (Figure S1). LED strips, oriented in a staggered position, were used on each side of the walkway and backlight waveguides to accommodate the extra material. The materials needed to build the modified gait apparatus can be found in Table S1.\nUse a backlight (Figure S2) to create a silhouette of the animal which is utilized by the software to assign position, direction of movement, and morphometric qualities. Construction is comprised of a layered panel of an acrylic diffuser, optical waveguide, reflector, and LED light strips assembled within a stock aluminum frame (Table S1).\nUse a walkway enclosure (Figure S3) to guide the animal along the platform and direct the animal to the home-cage. Construction consists of clear acrylic sheets solvent welded with dichloromethane (Table S2).\nUse the walkway (Figure S4) to provide the medium to generate lit footprints. The walkway is constructed from clear acrylic, which is side-lit with strip LEDs and housed in aluminum angle (Table S3).\nPlace a mirror (Figure S5) directly under the walkway at a 45-degree angle to reflect the underside of the walkway for videography. It is constructed from a 1/4\" thick glass mirror supported by acrylic, and angled brackets arranged in a row (Table S4).\nPerform videography using a tripod-mounted, domestic-quality, high-speed action camera.\n2. Equipment Setup",
    "Align the backlight, walkway, and mirror according to Figure S1, on top of a countertop, workbench, or stable cart. Ensure each component is centered with respect to the walkway.\nUsing a level, make certain that the components are horizontally plumb.\nPlace the walkway enclosure on top of the walkway.\nClean all contact surface areas with 70% ethanol. Make sure to use a nonabrasive towel to prevent scratching of the walkway.\nMount the high-speed camera onto a 57-inch tripod and place it mid-line to the mirror, spaced far enough to capture the entire walkway inside of the field of view. From the video settings menu, ensure that the high-speed camera is set to linear acquisition in 1080p mode at 120 frames per second (fps) with any type of auto-adjust or optimizations turned off.\nPlug in and turn on the LED strip lights for the backlight and walkway. It may be necessary to dim the backlight to reduce background capture.\n3. Animal Acclimation\nNOTE: One week prior to the first experiment, run the animals through the modified gait apparatus.\nPosition a home-cage at the terminus of the walkway.\nWith the enclosure installed and the lights off, place the rat at the end of walkway opposite the home-cage and allow it to walk across the walkway in an unforced manner.\nRun each rat through the modified gait apparatus several times, until they can smoothly cross the entire walkway.\nRepeat the process two days before the experiment.\n4. Gait Procedure\nPlace a home-cage at the end of the walkway before the start of each run to serve as a positive cue for the rat to traverse the walkway.\nTurn off the room lights, power on the camera, and start recording several seconds before the rat is placed on the platform.",
    "NOTE: Be certain to use a memory card that is officially recommended by the camera manufacturer. An unlisted memory card may still work but is not guaranteed to capture at the purported frame rate.\nWith the enclosure installed, place the rat at the end of the walkway opposite the home-cage and allow it to walk across the walkway in an unforced manner.\nStop recording once the animal reaches the terminus of the walkway.\nClean the walkway using 70% ethanol and a nonabrasive towel in between runs and after an animal urinates or defecates, then allow ethanol to evaporate before introducing another animal.\nRun the rats through the walkway a total of 7 times during each observation period, taking the first three runs that score as passing for analysis.\nScore a run as passing if the animal makes four or more consecutive steps in the direction of the home-cage without interruption due to grooming, pausing, or errant movements.\n\t​NOTE: It is good practice to record the mass of the animals before each round of measures. For our study, WT (n = 7) and DKO (n = 8) weighed 200.3 ± 21.67 g and 296.6 ± 3.85 g, respectively (p = 0.004, Unpaired t test with Welch's correction). We do not see an issue with rats of any age or size.\n5. Video preprocessing",
    "NOTE: The videos captured by the high-speed camera are rendered in mp4 format at 120 fps and a resolution of 1080p. To ease the burden on the analytical software downstream, first trim unnecessary footage and strip the audio from each video using LosslessCut software (version 3.23.7, https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut), then convert the mp4 video stream into a png image sequence using the open-source software FFmpeg (version 4.2, http://ffmpeg.org/). Note: other Lossless formats such as tiff can be utilized in place of png.\nCreate a directory for the videos on a PC running Windows 7 or higher, then transfer the videos from the high-speed camera's storage device to the newly created directory. In addition, copy ffmpeg.exe to the same location.\nIn LosslessCut, drag the videos to the interface to open. Discard the audio, set the start and end cut points to include only the analytically relevant portion of the video, set the capture frame format to png, and export. Once the video is exported, rename the video file using any naming convention followed by \"_trimmed\".\nTo batch convert the videos to image sequences, open a command prompt, set the working directory to the location of the videos with \"cd [path to directory]\", and run the following commands:\nfor %i in (*) do mkdir \"%~ni_cropped\"\n\tfor %i in (*) do mkdir \"%~ni_trimmed\"\n\tfor /f \"tokens=1 delims=.\" %a in ('dir /B *_trimmed.MP4') do ffmpeg -i \"%a.MP4\" \"%a/%a_%04d.png\"\n After the batch process completes, open each image sequence in ImageJ Fiji23 and crop the sequence to th e region of interest (ROI) encompassing the area of the floor within which the rat is observed.\nTo reduce background from the walkway illumination, increase the color balance minimum of the cyan channel to 76.",
    "Save as image sequence and change the \"_trimmed\" suffix to \"_cropped\", saving the files in their respective \"_cropped\" folder.\n6. Gait Processing\nNOTE: Gait data is processed and quantified using the freely available software, MouseWalker (http://biooptics.markalab.org/MouseWalker/)14.\nUnpack and install the MouseWalker software onto a PC running a 64-bit windows environment with Microsoft Excel installed.\nAfter launching MouseWalker.exe, perform an initial scale calibration for each set of runs. Load an image sequence and using landmarks or a ruler captured in the video, measure two points of known distance. Calculate the number of pixels per centimeter in the video frame and enter this value into the parameters section of the settings form along with the video acquisition frame rate.\nSimilarly, measure the head, tail, and feet of the rat to determine head length, maximum tail width and area, minimum and maximum foot area, and other features necessary to complete the tracking parameters section of the MouseWalker settings form. See http://biooptics.markalab.org/MouseWalker/ for the user manual and other documentation.\nTo obtain the body area values, open the same image sequence in ImageJ, draw a selection outlining the rat, and perform a region of interest (ROI) pixel count.\nParameters and settings used for this publication (Figure S6).\n\t​NOTE: Parameters are provided for illustration and are dependent on the scale of the video, acquisition hardware, and conditions. Software calibration and adjustment is required each time the camera or equipment is re-positioned. Capturing a measuring device within the acquisition improves accuracy and facilitates calibration.\nFollowing calibration, load each image sequence. Selecting auto will start the autonomous assignment of footprints.\nScroll through each frame of the sequence, manually correcting miss-assigned footprints. Save once this step is complete.",
    "Lastly, select evaluate to process the footprint position and pressure data. A series of graphs, images, and a spreadsheet with quantitative gait metrics will export into a results folder.\n7. Data Analysis\nUse the spreadsheet exported at the end of each evaluation that contains quantitative gait data for each run. Concatenate data from each run and average per rat. Plot the mean data and test for significance using GraphPad Prism version 7.0a.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
