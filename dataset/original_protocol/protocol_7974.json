    "All animal work described here is in accordance with legal regulations (EU-Directive 2010/63). Maintenance and handling of fish have been approved by local authorities and by the animal welfare representative of the Technische Universität Braunschweig.\n1. Preparation of artificial cerebro spinal fluid (ACSF), low melting agarose and sharp glass needles\nPrepare the ACSF by dissolving the listed chemicals at following concentrations in distilled water. 134 mM NaCl (58.44 g/mol), 2.9 mM KCl (74.55 g/mol), 2.1 mM CaCl2 (110.99 g/mol), 1.2 mM MgCl2 6x H2O (203.3 g/mol), 10 mM HEPES (238.31 g/mol), and 10 mM d-Glucose (180.16 g/mol).\n\tNOTE: For MgCl2, CaCl2, and KCl, 1 M stock solutions are prepared in desalted sterile water and stored at 4 °C for subsequently preparing fresh ACSF. Glucose, HEPES, and NaCl are dissolved as solid compounds in the fresh ACSF solution. For dissolving chemicals, follow the manufacturer's instructions.\nAdjust the pH of the ACSF to 7.8 with 10 M NaOH. Preparation of ACSF requires precise measurement of chemicals and fine adjustment of pH as it replaces the cerebro spinal fluid and maintains the physiological conditions required for neurons to be fully functional else it might cause brain misfunction and neuronal death.\nStore the freshly prepared ACSF at 4 °C for a maximum of 4 weeks. For working conditions, aliquot the required volume of ACSF for the day/experiment and prewarm at 25-28 °C (and optionally oxygenate it, step 2.5)\n\tNOTE: Freshly prepared ASCF is fine for 1 day. If planning to use it over several days, ACSF needs to be sterile filtered.\nFor later anesthesia of the larvae, prepare a 50 mM stock solution of d-Tubocurarine in distilled water and store the solution at -20 °C as 100 µL aliquots in the freezer until needed.",
    "To embed the fish, prepare 2.5% low melting (LM) agarose by dissolving 1.25 g LM-agarose (Table of Materials) in 50 mL ACSF and boil until the agarose is completely dissolved.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, higher or lower concentrations of LM-agarose can be used depending on the experimental set-up. However, if the agarose is too soft, it will not be able to hold the fish in position when opening the skull.\nStore the agarose at 37 °C waterbath, to avoid solidification and because this temperature will also not harm the larvae when embedding. After the boiled agarose is cooled down to 37 °C in the waterbath, add the necessary amount of d-Tubocurarine to the aliquoted agarose needed for the day to reach a working concentration of 10 µM. For future use, store the left-over agarose at 4 °C to avoid contamination.\nPrepare sharp and thin glass needles from glass capillaries (Supplementary Figure 1) using a micropipette puller with the following settings.\n\t\nPuller I, Capillary type 1: Heat 1: 65.8; Heat 2: 55.1; 2-step pulling\n\t\tPuller II, Capillary type 2: Heat = 700; Fil = 4; Vel = 55; Del = 130; Pul = 55; 1-step pulling.\n\t\tNOTE: The units are specific for each puller and glass capillary used here, respectively (see Table of Materials). Other capillaries and pullers can also be used to prepare the glass needles. But the glass needles should not be too thin as they might break when coming in contact with the skull. Capillary: length: 100 mm (4 inches); OD: 1.5 mm; ID: 0.84 mm; filament: Yes\n2. Anesthesia of larvae and preparations for embedding",
    "When starting the experiment for the day, transfer the animals that are needed with a plastic Pasteur pipette to a 90 mm diameter Petri dish, which is filled with either Danieau (for larvae which are still kept in a Petri dish with Danieau) or water from the fish facility (for larvae which are older than 7 dpf and are kept in the fish facility).\n\t\nWhen pipetting fish older than 2 weeks, make sure the opening of the pipette is large enough to avoid injuring the fish when transferring them. Do not use a net because it will physically damage especially the younger larvae.\nAdd rotifera or artemia nauplii suited for the size of the larvae kept in the Petri dish, to ensure free access to food and maximum health status of the larvae and to reduce stress.\nFor embedding, transfer the selected larvae to a 35 mm diameter Petri dish filled with ACSF. Add the necessary volume of d-Tubocurarine to reach a working concentration/effective dose of 10 µM and wait for a few minutes until the larvae are completely immobilized11.\n\tNOTE: When the fish grow older or if a faster full anesthesia is needed (under 5 min), it is possible to increase the concentration of d-Tubocurarine (LD50 for mice is 0.13 mg/kg intravenously12). It is also possible to use a different anesthetic, such as α-bungarotoxin (working concentration: 1 mg/mL), which has the same effect as curare and also keeps the brain fully active13. If a fully active brain is not necessary for the subject of interest, Tricaine in a non-lethal dose (0.02%) is also an option to fully anesthetize the larvae. However, Tricaine blocks sodium-channels, thereby impairing brain activity14.",
    "Prepare the mounting chamber by taking the lid of the 35 mm diameter Petri dish, flip the lid upside down, and place a square glass coverslip (24 x 24 mm) on the bottom of the lid. See Figure 1 (upper part) for a schematic description of these steps. The smoother surface of the glass prevents slipping away of the agarose block, which contains the larvae during the skull opening procedure.\nAliquot the amount of ACSF needed for the day in an appropriate vial (e.g., 50 mL tube, beaker, Schott bottle, etc.) and oxygenate it with carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O2). If imaging only morphology (e.g., fluorescence patterns) ACSF is still necessary to ensure the integrity of the brain and that cells are not negatively influenced by osmolarity effects but oxygenation of the ACSF is not needed. This step only needs to be performed when full brain activity is necessary for imaging.\n\tNOTE: For optimal oxygen saturation of the medium, add an air stone to the end of the carbogen tube. To guarantee a sufficiently high oxygen level, it is necessary to exchange the ACSF in the imaging chambers with freshly oxygenated ACSF every 20-60 min, depending on the number and age of larvae embedded in the same imaging chamber (e.g., for a single embedded larva ACSF exchange every hour is sufficient. For six larvae older than 14 dpf embedded in parallel, exchanging ACSF every 20 min is necessary) so plan the necessary amount of oxygen saturated ACSF according to the planned experiment.\n3. Embedding of the larvae",
    "Transfer the fully anesthetized larvae with a plastic Pasteur pipette to the (in step 2.4) prepared mounting chamber. Then, carefully remove the excess medium to avoid dilution of the LM-agarose. All the following steps should be performed under a stereo microscope with sufficient magnification.\n\tNOTE: Tilting the mounting chamber can help to fully remove the medium.\nProceed immediately to the next step, by adding a sufficiently large LM-agarose drop on top of the larvae (circa 1 mL, depending on the size of the larvae) to protect the animals from drying out and to reduce unnecessary stress.\nOrient the larvae in position before the agarose solidifies. Ensure that the dorsal part of the larvae is directed upward. Also, make sure to embed the larvae as close to the surface of the agarose as possible.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the size and number of larvae planned to embed at the same time, it is possible to adjust the agarose concentration. For example, for 1-3 larvae that are 30 dpf old, a concentration of 1.8%-2% LM-agarose is recommended. For 1-4 larvae that are 7 dpf old, it is most practicable to use 2.5% LM-agarose, whereas, for 5-8 larvae, 2% is more suited. If a fully active brain is required, it is recommended to only embed three fish at the same time to reduce the time needed to operate the larvae. In general, it is recommended to use lower concentrations (1.8%-2%) the older the larvae get or the more larvae are planned to be embedded at the same time.",
    "If images will be recorded using an inverted microscope, trim the agarose block containing the larvae into a small cuboid shape. This is important for transferring the larvae to the imaging chamber later on. If using an upright microscope, such trimming is not necessary, because the mounting chamber can also be used as the imaging chamber. In Figure 1 (upper part), one can find a schematic description of these steps.\n4. Exposing the brain\nNOTE: All the following steps should be performed with greatest care to not unnecessarily injure the larvae. If a fully active brain is required for the experiment, keep in mind that with every second that passes, while the fish is still fully mounted in agarose and has an open skull without oxygenated ACSF, the brain will suffer from a lack of oxygen and also dry out. The effects of oxygen deficiency will become even more dramatic, the older the embedded larvae are. Therefore, it is important to perform the surgery not only within the shortest time possible, but also with maximum precision to not evoke mechanical brain damage with the needle. When trained, steps 4.2-4.4 should not take more than 30 s per fish.\nBegin the surgery as soon as the agarose has solidified. First, trim away all of the excess agarose above the brain region of interest to obtain free access to the head and a clear working space. If the dorsal part of the head is already sticking out of the agarose, skip this step.\nDepending on the region of interest, pick a spot to begin with the surgery. Take the glass needle and make a small incision through the skin but without penetrating too deep into the tissue. This will be the starting point for peeling away the overlaying skin.",
    "NOTE: For optimal results, never start directly above the region of interest to reduce the risk of damaging important structures. If necessary, it is possible to even start posterior to the hindbrain and from there work forward until the unwanted area of skin is peeled away.\nContinue with very small cuts along the part of skin aiming to remove by barely moving the needle just underneath the surface. Most of the time it is not necessary to move completely around the brain and to cut out a circle-like piece of skin and skull, but rather just make two incisions along the head and then push the skin away to one or the other side. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the optimal cutting strategy to obtain free access to the cerebellum.\n\tNOTE: This micro-surgery is a delicate procedure and it will most likely need some training to perfectly remove the skin without damaging the underlying brain. It is also recommended to find out the optimal cutting strategy for the brain region of interest and stick with it for the period of the experiment.\nImmediately after removing the skin from all embedded larvae, proceed by pouring (oxygenated) ACSF over the agarose to flood away unwanted skin particles and blood and to keep the brain fully active and protect it from drying out.\n\tNOTE: If a healthy brain is needed for the experiment, it is recommended to go for a maximum of three fish at a time.\nIf using an upright microscope, start directly with imaging.\n\t\nWhen using an inverted microscope, slide a small spatula underneath the cuboid agarose block (step 3.4).",
    "Add a small drop of LM-agarose to the bottom of the imaging chamber (e.g., glass-bottom dish) and immediately flip the agarose block containing the larvae with the spatula for 180° and gently push it to the bottom of the imaging chamber, while the liquid agarose drop acts as glue.\nWhen the agarose has solidified, fill up the imaging chamber with (oxygenated) ACSF, then begin imaging. See Figure 1 (lower part) for a schematic description.\nWhen full brain activity is required for the experiment, always make sure that ACSF in the imaging chamber has a sufficiently high oxygen level. To ensure this, exchange the medium carefully with freshly oxygenated ACSF when possible every 20-60 min (depending on the number and size of the fish, size and surface of the imaging chamber, and imaging duration).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62166/62166fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic procedure for the preparation of open skull zebrafish for in vivo imaging in a stepwise manner.

The red circle marks the spot where the first cut needs to be made. The red-dotted line delineates the optimal path to cut along with the needle to obtain free access to the cerebellum without damaging it. The green arrow marks the direction in which the excessive skin and skull pieces can easily be pushed away. Make sure to never penetrate into the brain tissue during the whole procedure. After successfully peeling away the skin, the brain region of interest (here, cerebellum) will be freely accessible for any kind of high-resolution in vivo imaging.
