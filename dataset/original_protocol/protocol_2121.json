For each plate, in the insert at the top right corner white arrowheads indicate two white colonies that could be selected for the next steps. Scale bar, 1 cm.\n(B) Example of plasmid verification via restriction digestion (step 16). The Cas9+sgRNA multi-gene plasmid map created with Benchling and annotated with SnapGene is shown on the left. Red lines mark the two EcoRI restriction sites. The result of DNA gel electrophoresis of the uncut and EcoRI-digested plasmid is shown on the right. The tested plasmid displays the expected restriction digestion pattern (5.4 Kb + 3.8 Kb).\nCritical: The vectors used in all three Golden Gate assembly steps (pYTK050, pYTK095, pYTK-DN4, pYTK-DN5 and pYTK-DN6) contain a GFP gene driven by a promoter for expression in E. coli. This allows visual detection of E. coli colonies transformed with the undigested vector, since these colonies appear green on the plate. Conversely, correct Golden Gate assembly results in loss of the GFP gene, yielding white E. coli colonies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSet up the Golden Gate reaction.",

The fragment carries the desired mutation either inside the target sequence or in the 50 nucleotides upstream or downstream. If needed, extra (synonymous) mutations are introduced to disrupt the sgRNA sequence. In case the sgRNA sequence does not include the desired mutation site, the repair fragment is designed similarly, but it is shifted a few nucleotides upstream or downstream, so that the mutation site and the target sequence are more or less equally distant from the edges of the repair fragment. In both instances, repair fragment is obtained by PCR amplification of partially overlapping primers (“no template PCR”, Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1707-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Design of repair fragment for the introduction of point mutations\n(A) Schematic of the repair fragment design when the desired mutation is located within the sgRNA sequence. The repair fragment is obtained through “no template PCR” amplification of partially overlapping primers containing the mutated target sequence and the homology regions upstream (in black) and downstream (in blue) the target sequence. The mutation is indicated by a yellow star.

    "(B) Schematic of the repair fragment design when the desired mutation is located outside the sgRNA sequence. The repair fragment is obtained through “no template PCR” amplification of partially overlapping primers containing (part of) the target sequence and the homology regions upstream (in black) and downstream (in blue) the target sequence. The desired mutation (indicated by a yellow star) is introduced in the upstream or downstream homology region. Moreover, one or more additional synonymous mutations (indicated by a white star) are introduced in the target sequence. After Cas9-dependent cleavage near the mutation site, repair fragment integration results in the introduction of the desired mutation and the disruption of the target sequence.\n(C) Example of primers design for the introduction of point mutations, when the desired mutation is located within the target sequence (step 28). The sgRNA sequence is highlighted in gray. The mutated bases (ATG>GGT) and the corresponding amino acid change (M>G) are marked in red. The amino acid sequence is displayed using the one-letter code under the DNA sequence. Since the mutated bases are distal to the PAM, it is possible, out of precaution, to introduce an additional synonymous mutation (in magenta) in the target sequence near the PAM to ensure abrogation of Cas9 cleavage after repair. See main text for details.\nIn case the sgRNA sequence spans through the desired mutation site, design partially overlapping primers as follows.\nForward primer: 50 nucleotides upstream target sequence + 20 nucleotides mutated target sequence.\nReverse primer: reverse complement 50 nucleotides downstream target sequence + reverse complement 20 nucleotides mutated target sequence.\nThe mutated sequence contains:\nThe desired point mutation(s).\nIf necessary, one or multiple additional synonymous mutations in order to disrupt the sgRNA sequence, but still preserving the amino acid sequence.",
    "Introduction of additional synonymous mutations that disrupt the sgRNA sequence can be done in two ways:\nMutate one of the “Gs” of the PAM site (NGG) so that the target sequence is no longer recognized (but avoid NAG, because it can still be recognized as a PAM).\nMutate at least 2 bases among the 10 PAM-proximal bases (this is enough to prevent binding of the sgRNA).\nNote: With such a design, the 20 3′-proximal nucleotides of the two primers anneal with each other, and each can provide the template for the extension of the other primer, yielding a complete 120 bp repair fragment.\nIn case the sgRNA sequence does not include the desired mutation site, design partially overlapping primers as follows.\nSelect a 120-nucleotide sequence centered on the target sequence and the desired mutation site.\nObtain the sequence of the repair fragment by adding the desired point mutation(s) and one or multiple additional synonymous mutations in order to disrupt the sgRNA sequence:\nMutate one of the “Gs” of the PAM site (NGG) so that the target sequence is no longer recognized (but avoid NAG, because it can still be recognized as a PAM).\nAlternatively, mutate at least 2 bases among the 10 PAM-proximal bases (this is enough to prevent binding of the sgRNA).\nForward primer: the first 70 nucleotides of the repair fragment.\nReverse primer: reverse complement of the last 70 nucleotides of the repair fragment.\nNote: With such a design, the 20 3′-proximal nucleotides of the two primers anneal with each other, and each can provide the template for the extension of the other primer, yielding a complete 120 bp repair fragment.\nAmplify the repair fragment via “no template PCR”.
