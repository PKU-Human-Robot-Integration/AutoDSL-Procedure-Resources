    "NOTE: All animals were treated in accordance with the ethical guidelines established by the Scripps Research Institute.\n1. Preparation of Materials for the Injection (~20 min)\nPre-warm cell dissociation solution (preferably one that is inactivated through dilution, not with serum), sterile PBS, and culture media (Table 1).\nSterilize the syringe with a blunt needle by disassembling it and boiling the parts in water for 15 min.\n2. Preparation of the RPE Cells for Injection (~30 min to 1 hr)\nDetach the RPE cells using pre-warmed cell dissociation solution for 5-8 min at 37 °C.\nScrape the cells gently to release any that are still attached.\nDilute the cells with a large volume of culture media (fill up a 15 ml tube) to inactivate the dissociation solution and count them.\nCentrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nResuspend the cells at 200,000 cells/µl (to deliver 100,000 cells in a 0.5 µl volume) in sterile pre-warmed PBS and transfer them into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nOptionally, add a live cell transient fluorescent marker and incubate at 37 °C for 30-45 min.\nLoad the syringe with a blunt needle with 0.5 µl of cells. Inject the cells as soon as possible.\n3. Sub-retinal Injection (~5 min per Injection)\nNOTE: If possible, learn the technique with adult albino rats since the limbus vessels are much easier to visualize. Inject Fast Green solution when learning (before trying to inject cells) to more easily facilitate visualization of the injection site.\nAnesthetize the rodent. Use intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/ml ketamine and 10 mg/ml xylazine (20 µl/10 g body weight) over isofluorane inhalation since it is difficult to maneuver the rodent and inject into the eye with the snout in the inhaler.",
    "Ensure that the animal is deeply anesthetized by pinching one of its paws. If it flinches, wait several more minutes and try again before beginning the subretinal injection.\nPosition the rodent onto its side so that the eye that will be injected is facing the ceiling.\nUnder a dissecting microscope gently stretch the skin so the eye pops slightly up out of the socket (temporary proptosis) and becomes more accessible by holding its head with two fingers just above the ear and by its jaw and gently stretch the skin parallel to the eyelids so that the eye pops slightly up out of the socket (See Figure 1C). Do not grasp the rodent too close to the throat.\nWith a 30 G sharp disposable pre-sterilized needle, make a hole immediately below the limbus (if the vessels are hit, bleeding will be significant and it be difficult to find the hole later) and at an angle to avoid touching the lens with the needle (Figure 1D). Avoid touching the lens with the sharp (or blunt) needle or immediate cataract formation will occur.\n\tNOTE: Injections work better with two people. In this way one person can pass the syringe with the blunt needle to the person performing the injection after they have created the first hole with the sharp disposable needle to maintain focus on the where the hole is.\nRetract the disposable sharp needle from the eye while maintaining the grip on the head. Remember exactly where the hole is.",
    "After either mounting the pre-loaded syringe with a blunt needle on a micromanipulator or holding it by hand, insert the tip of the syringe with the blunt needle through the hole, taking care again not to touch the lens and gently push it through the eye very gently until feeling resistance (Figure 1D).\nKeeping all movements to a minimum, carefully inject the RPE cells slowly into the subretinal space.\n\tNOTE: RPE/retina detachment will be induced; this is unavoidable. However, a cleaner injection minimizes the detachment and greatly improves the chances of reattachment (Figure 1E). Any exaggerated movements may move the needle back into the retina, and sideways movements can damage the retina. The use of an injection pump is optional but allows for a very precise delivery.\nRetract the syringe slowly. Apply eye moisturizing drops to keep the eye hydrated.\nContinue to monitor the animal until it regains sternal recumbency. Do not leave animal unattended or return to a cage with other alert animals until it regains sternal recumbency.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
