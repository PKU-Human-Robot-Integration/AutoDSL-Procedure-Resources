    "1. Headspace Sorbent Pen (HSP) and sample analysis considerations\nNOTE: The HSP containing the sorbent Tenax TA was selected to capture a broad range of volatiles. Tenax has a lower affinity for water compared to other sorbents, which enables it to trap more VOCs from higher-moisture samples. Tenax also has a low level of impurities and can be conditioned for re-use. Sorbent selection was also made in consideration with the column installed in the GC-MS (see the Table of Materials).\nGenerate negative controls by extracting media and/or sample blanks with the same conditions used for sample extraction.\nAnalyze a blank HSP (previously confirmed to be clean and free of significant background) on the GC-MS before analyzing extracted samples. Run blanks between sample types (e.g., three replicates of bacteria mono-culture, blank, three replicates of bacteria co-culture, blank, etc.).\nLimit use of fragrant personal care items or consumption of smelly foods prior to sample extraction and analysis. Ideally, prepare samples in a biosafety hood that has not been cleansed by alcohol or other volatile cleaners for at least 30 min. Turn on airflow in the biosafety hood for 30-60 min prior to sample preparation.\nKeep samples on ice to limit volatile release during sample preparation.\n2. Mono- and co-culture preparation\nIn the biosafety hood, inoculate cultures of A. baumannii, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa in Todd Hewitt growth media. Incubate overnight at 37 °C with 200 rpm agitation.\nAfter the overnight incubation, perform culture handling in the biosafety hood. Dilute each culture to optical density 0.05 at 500 nm.\nMix co-cultures in equal parts, and pipette 200 µL of control media, mono-, or co-culture into each well of a 96-well plate, and place in 37 °C incubator for 24 h. Prepare a second plate for a 48-h incubation.",
    "At the end of the incubation period, prepare samples for extraction in section 4. Pipette liquid cultures into microcentrifuge tubes and store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: At this point, samples can be stored at -80 °C to extract later if needed.\n3. Stable isotope probing in biological samples preparation\nNOTE: The feces and saliva samples were donated from anonymous donors with approval from the University of California Irvine Institutional Review Board (HS# 2017-3867). The sewage came from San Diego, CA. The sputum samples were collected from subjects with cystic fibrosis as part of a larger study approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (HUM00037056).\nPerform all biological sample preparations in the biosafety hood.\n\t\nTo prepare fecal samples, add 1 mL of deionized water to 100 mg of feces in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and vortex for 3 min. Place on ice when not in use.\n\t\t\nTo 15 µL of fecal and water mixture, add 485 µL of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium with 20 mM 13C glucose, or BHI with 30% deuterium (D2O). Ensure that the final volume of the sample is 500 µL. Prepare samples in technical triplicates.\nTo prepare sewage samples, add 500 µL of sewage to 500 µL of BHI with 20 mM 13C glucose or BHI with 30% D2O for a total volume of 1 mL. Prepare samples in triplicate. Place on ice when not in use.\nTo prepare saliva samples, add 50 µL of saliva to 500 µL of BHI with 20 mM 13C glucose or BHI with 30% D2O for a total volume of 550 µL. Prepare samples in triplicate. Place on ice when not in use.",
    "To prepare sputum samples to compare the volatiles present in the sample prior to and after culturing, perform a first extraction with 15 µL of sputum. Prepare samples in triplicate. Place on ice when not in use. Proceed to section 4 for sample extraction, and extract for 18 h at 37 °C with 200 rpm agitation.\nAfter the completion of the first extraction of the uncultured sputum samples, save the vials with sputum. Add 500 µL of BHI with 20 mM 13C glucose to the vials with sputum from 3.5.1. Place on ice when not in use.\nProceed to section 4 for sample extraction.\n4. Sample extraction\nPlace empty volatile organic analysis (VOA) vials (20 mL) on the cold plate, and place the cold plate on ice in the biosafety hood.\nTurn on the 5600 sorbent pen extraction unit (SPEU), and adjust to the desired temperature as required for each method.\n\tNOTE: For stable isotope probing experiments at 37 °C, reaching the setpoint can take up to 15 min. For mono- and co-culture experiments at 70 °C, reaching the setpoint can take up to 60 min.\nCollect clean HSPs that are equal to the number of samples prepared, including HSPs for media or sample controls.\nLabel 20 mL VOA vials according to samples, replicates, and HSP IDs as needed. Use a marker that resists water in case condensation forms on the outside of the vial while on ice.\nInside the biosafety hood, unscrew the white cap on the vial, quickly pipet sample into the vial, and assemble the black cap, lid liner, and HSP.\n\tNOTE: Samples should not come into contact with the HSP, and sample volume will depend on sample type.\nPlace the vial containing the sample and HSP back on the cold plate.",
    "Repeat steps 4.5 and 4.6 for each sample. Perform these steps per sample instead of all at once to prevent sample warming and thus, premature volatile release.\nOnce all samples have been prepared in the glass vials, perform the following steps outside the biosafety hood on the bench. Turn on the vacuum pump, place the vials under vacuum to 30 mmHg, and remove the vacuum source.\n\tNOTE: The vials do not need to be on the cold tray after vacuum application has been completed.\nDouble-check the pressure after placing all samples under vacuum using the pressure gauge. If a vial has a leak, ensure that the cap is screwed on tightly, and that the white O-rings of the HSP and lid liners are properly in place.\n\tNOTE: A compromised seal can result in decreased volatile detection compared to a vial under vacuum.\nPlace vials in the SPEU for the optimized time and temperature with agitation at 200 rpm. Extract cultures for 1 h at 70 °C. Extract stable isotope probing experiments with fecal, sewage, saliva, and sputum samples for 18 h at 37 °C.\nPlace the cold plate at -80 °C for use after the extraction period is complete.\nWhen extraction is complete, place samples on the cold plate for 15 min to draw out water vapor from the HSP and vial headspace.\nTransfer the HSPs to their sleeves.\n\t​NOTE: The experiment can be paused here for up to ~1 week at room temperature before losing the more highly volatile compounds from the HSPs.\n5. Analyze samples on the gas chromatography - mass spectrometer (GC-MS)",
    "Use the following GC-MS (see the Table of Materials) settings: 35 °C with a 5 min hold, 10 °C/min ramp to 170 °C, and a 15 °C/min ramp to 230 °C with a 20:1 split ratio and a total runtime of 38 min.\nSet the desorption method as follows: 2 min, 70 °C preheat; 2 min 260 °C desorption; 34 min, 260 °C bakeout; and 2 min, 70 °C post bake.\nSet up the sequence of samples, and start the run according to instrumentation.\n\t\nTo set up a sequence on the Entech Software, open the program. In the options to the right of the instrument dropdown menu, select 5800 | Sequence.\nObserve the sequence table in the Entech software similar to that in the GC-MS software. Name the Sample ID column according to Current date_vial number. Keep in mind that Name is analogous to Name in the GC-MS sequence table, and 5800 Method determines the rate of temperature ramp, holding times, etc. (opens a menu to select the method generated in step 5.2).\nKeep in mind that the Tray and Position columns determine where the Sample Preparation Rail (SPR) will go to pick up the HSPs.\n\t\t\nObserve the two trays with 30 spots each to the immediate left, laid out as six columns with five spots each. The tray position that is left most and closest to the user (front) is position 1, while the rightmost, furthest away is position 30.\nNote that these trays are HSP A or B, where HSP B is the tray closer to the SPR (innermost tray), and directly behind HSP B is HSP Blank. Place the extracted samples into the trays, and select the spot on the sequence accordingly.",
    "Save the sequence table, select Run on the left-hand side, then Start with blank in desorber if the blank HSP is in the desorber (denoted by a HSP marked by yellow label).\nNote that HSPs will be handled by the SPR for each sample in the sequence. Let the SPR warm up, then a message will appear at the top of the screen to confirm if the blank is in the desorber. Click on Skip to confirm that the pen is there. Allow the SPR to run all samples automatically, and the sequence on the GC-MS side will automatically record the data in separate files.\n6. Data analysis\nQuality-filter data on GC-MS software (Table of Materials).\n\t\nReview each peak on the chromatogram, and annotate peaks that match the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) library (or with another available library).\nAdd annotated chromatogram peaks to the processing method. Set the criteria for selecting peaks to include compounds with a greater than 75% probability, and ensure that the alignment of each identifying ion of the compound lies within the center of the peak.\n\t\t\nTo add a peak to the processing method, select Calibrate | Edit Compound | Name | insert compound under External Standard Compound. Add the name of the compound, retention time, Quant Signal Target Ion. Add the three largest peaks. To save, select ok | Method | Save.\nOnce the process method is set up, proceed to Quantitate | Calculate, and View | QEdit Quant Result.\nInspect each compound to ensure that the peaks align with their expected retention times and are above background noise.",
    "Once QEdit has been completed, select Exit | Yes to save the QEdits and return to the main chromatogram. Export the area integrations by opening the file on the left-hand side. Select Quantitate | Generate Report.\nTo export files for use in DExSI, select File | Export Data to AIA format | Create New Directory, and select a location for the file or Use Existing Directory.\nObserve a new window opening up to select files for export. Move the files to the right side of the window and click on Process. Wait for a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the number of files being converted.\nCorrect for isotope abundance in DExSI according to instructions for the DExSI software (https://github.com/DExSI/DExSI), and perform analysis with a favorite software or program (e.g., R). Scripts used to generate the figures are located at https://github.com/joannlp/VOC_SIP[href=https://github.com/joannlp/VOC_SIP].\nSubscription Required.
