    "Notes: The entire protocol is depicted in Figure 1.Samples should be protected from light during the experiment. In all cases, medium is supplemented with appropriate antibiotic to maintain the plasmid coding for GFP.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719185009_6191.jpgFigure 1. Schematic step-by-step protocol for growing B. pertussis biofilms for CLSM evaluationGrowth of B. pertussis strainsFrom frozen stock stored at -78 °C, streak B. pertussis strains harboring a GFP-coding plasmid, pGB5P1-GFP was used in this protocol (Weingart et al., 1999), on Bordet-Gengou agar plates supplemented with 10% defibrinated sheep’s blood and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin. Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 4-5 days. Pick individual colonies (~8-10) and inoculate 2 ml of Stainer-Scholte (SS) liquid medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml of kanamycin. Incubate at 37°C in a roller drum spinning at top speed for 24 h.Inoculate 30 ml of SS medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml of kanamycin (in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask), with the cultures from Step A2 to achieve an OD650 of 0.2. Incubate for 12 h at 37 °C with shaking at 160 rcf.In vitro biofilm formationInsert a sterile coverglass (flame sterilized) at the bottom of sterile 6-well plates. Prepare inoculum by diluting B. pertussis culture (Procedure A, Step 3) to an OD650 of 1.0 in SS medium. Pipet 1.5 ml of inoculum into individual wells of the 6-well plates. Make sure the bacterial suspension is covering the entire surface of the coverslip. In case other substrates are used (i.e., polycarbonate or aluminum coupons), volume should be adjusted according to the thickness of the material.Cover the plate and incubate statically in a humidified chamber for 4 h at 37 °C. Note: This step allows the adhesion of bacteria to the surface.",
    "Remove inocula (to allow removal of unattached planktonic bacteria) carefully without disturbing attached cells and add approximately 800 μl of fresh SS medium, dispensing along the wall of the well to prevent biofilm disruption. Place the plate at an angle of 30°-50° relative to horizontal, forming an air-liquid interface in the coverglass where biofilms will develop. Cover the plate with aluminum foil and incubate in a humidified chamber at 37 °C on a platform shaker at 90 rcf. If the biofilm formation is going to be examined for longer than 24 h, change medium every 24 h as described above. Samples can be processed at 24, 48, and 72 up to 96 h.Visualization of biofilmsAfter each time point, aspirate medium from each well and carefully wash the biofilms twice with sterile PBS.Pick the coverglass up with forceps and place it into a new 6-well plate. A needle can be used to aid in lifting the coverglass followed by use of forceps to pick the coverglass without touching the area where the biofilm developed.Carefully add 50 μl of neutral buffered formalin, or enough to cover the glass surface. Special attention must be taken in order to not disturb the biofilm and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Remove fixative and wash twice with PBS.Pick the coverglass up with forceps and mount onto a glass slide with ProLongTM Gold mounting media. Alternatively, if bacteria are not labeled with a fluorescent protein, cells can be stained at this point with a fluorescent dye and then mounted.Allow the mounting media to harden by incubating at 4 °C for 24 h.Slides can be stored (weeks to months) in the dark at room temperature for later visualization.",
    "Examine the samples with a confocal microscope, taking images in a z-stack configuration, making sure to cover the entire biofilm structure from bottom to top.Analyze the images by using microscopy image visualization software (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719185825_1248.jpgFigure 2. Micrographs of a B. pertussis biofilm. Biofilms were grown from 24 up to 96 h and images were acquired in an inverted confocal microscope in a z-stack setting. Images are presented in xy, xz and yz planes."
