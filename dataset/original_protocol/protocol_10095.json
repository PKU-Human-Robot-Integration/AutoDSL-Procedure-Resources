    "NOTE: A time schedule for the steps in the different sections is given in the supplementary information (section 1).\n1. Chip Fabrication\nNOTE: As substrates, use silicon wafers (100 mm diameter, 0.525 mm thickness) with a 50 nm thick layer of silicon dioxide or glass slides (24 mm x 24 mm, no. 1.5; 22 mm x 50 mm, no. 4). Depending on the application, other sizes and thicknesses may be more suitable.\nCleaning the substrates via an RCA clean procedure (water, ammonia solution NH3(aq) 30% and hydrogen peroxide H2O2 30%, at a ratio 5:1:1)\n\t\nMix water and ammonia solution in a beaker glass and heat the mixture to 70 °C on a hot plate while stirring.\nAdd the hydrogen peroxide and the substrate. For higher throughput, place multiple substrates (especially the small glass slides) in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) holder.\nAfter 30 min, take out the substrate, rinse it thoroughly with water from a wash bottle, and dry it with a nitrogen gun. Immediately proceed with the PEGylation of the substrate.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear skin and eye protection and work in a fume hood. Do not close the waste container tightly in order to allow for gas release from the mixture.\nPEGylation of the substrate\n\tNOTE: Repeated freezing and thawing of the Biotin-PEG-Silane stock reduces the reactivity of the silane due to condensation of air moisture. Therefore, prepare 5 mL-tubes with appropriate amounts of Biotin-PEG-Silane (e.g. 10-20 mg) and fill them with dry argon before freezing them until use.\n\t\nDissolve Biotin-PEG-Silane in dry toluene by vortexing (5 mg/mL).\nPlace the substrate in a glass petri dish (120 cm diameter, 2 cm height) in a fume hood.",
    "Pipette the solution (≈200 µL for a single glass cover slip, a few mL for a large silicon wafer) onto the substrate, covering the whole surface, but avoid the solution flowing over the edge of the substrate.\nClose the petri dish. To reduce drying of the substrate, add an additional cover with a wet paper towel.\nAfter 30 min, add approximately 40 ml of isopropyl alcohol, then take out the substrate, rinse it again thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol and dry it with a nitrogen gun (for glass slides, remember the PEGylated side). Store the substrate in the dark until use.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear skin and eye protection and work in a fume hood.\n2. Preparation of Genes for Immobilization\nNOTE: Primer sequences, DNA modifications and an exemplary PCR protocol are given in the supplementary information (sections 2-4).\nUse modified primers to amplify the gene of interest by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One primer carries a fluorophore for visualization in fluorescence microscopy, and the other primer is separated from the DIS sequence by a triethylene glycol spacer in order to keep the DIS sequence single-stranded throughout the PCR.\nPurify the DNA using a spin column purification kit and measure its concentration using an absorption photometer. The concentration should not be much lower than 100 nM.\nAdjust the concentration of NaCl to 1 M using a concentrated 5 M NaCl solution. The high salt concentration facilitates the DNA brush assembly process22.\n3. Photolithography\nNOTE: The photocleavable DNA (PC) should be handled only in a yellow-light environment. Yellow foil for cleanrooms can be used to filter the light of conventional white light lamps.\nPreparation of the substrate",
    "Prepare the Bephore-mix (1 µM streptavidin, 1.5 µM PC DNA, 7.5 µM PH DNA in 1x PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)) and the passivation mix (10 µM unlabeled DIS DNA, 1 mg/mL BSA (bovine serum albumin), in 1x PBS). Both can be stored in the dark in the fridge for several weeks.\nCut the substrate into smaller pieces (a few cm2) either by using a glass cutter or by breaking a silicon wafer along a crystal line by pressing onto an edge with a scalpel. As a simple alignment mark, create a short scratch from the center towards an edge of the substrate using the glass cutter. Blow small particles off the chip with a nitrogen gun.\nMix two droplets of two-component silicone glue, stirring it e.g. with a pipette tip, and apply the glue to the surface of the chip, leaving the area around the tip of the scratch blank ( Figure 2A). The glue provides a hydrophobic barrier that facilitates washing steps and reduces the amount of DNA required for incubations. In a later step, the glue can be easily peeled off.\nIncubate 10 µL (or as much as necessary to cover the chip) of the Bephore-mix at room temperature (RT) on the chip. During the incubation, place the chip in a box, e.g. a pipette tip box partially filled with water to reduce evaporation.\nAfter 1 h, wash the chip several times (5x with 50 µL) by pipetting with 1x PBS to remove unbound Bephore-mix.\nTake off as much buffer as possible without drying the chip and incubate 10 µL of the passivation-mix on the chip at RT.\nAfter 2 h, wash the chip several times (10x with 50 µL) by pipetting with 1x PBS to remove unbound passivation agents.\nProjection lithography",
    "NOTE: For lithography, an upright microscope with a 60x water immersion objective can be used. Illumination times depend on the objective, the light source, the mask, the substrate (silicon chip or glass slide) and the desired DNA surface density. With a 60x objective, typical exposure times ranged from below one minute for a two-step lithography with overlapping regions (15 s for silicon chips, 45 s for glass slides) to 2-3 min for a full exposure. Do not use a cover slip (except fused quartz) on top of the substrate, since it blocks UV light.\n\t\nCut a printed photomask (see supplementary file with exemplary lithography masks and supplementary section 5) to an appropriate size to fit a suitable mask holder, which can be inserted at the position of the field stop (Figure 2B). For precise multi-step lithography, align the mask with alignment marks on the holder.\nPlace the substrate on a microscopy slide and move it to the microscope stage. For patterning of Bephore glass slides, insert black foil (e.g. spare foil from the printed photomasks) between microscopy slide and Bephore slide to provide a dark background for lithography.\nInsert a red filter into the illumination path, focus onto the substrate surface and navigate to the region of the substrate, which will be exposed, e.g. the region at the tip of the scratch.\nInsert the mask holder, block the illumination and change to the UV filter (Figure 2C). At a low light intensity, open the shutter and use the camera to quickly focus the mask on the substrate.\nBlock the light path to the camera and illuminate the substrate at a high light intensity for the desired exposure time.\nTake the sample from the microscope and carefully remove as much buffer as possible from the substrate without drying it.",
    "Add 10-20 µL of the DNA with DIS-sequence. Place the substrate in a wet box to keep it from drying. Incubate the DNA on the substrate for 2 h (oligonucleotides at a micromolar concentration) or several hours/overnight (kbp-long DNA at approximately 100 nM concentration) at RT.\nRemove the DNA from the chip and wash it several times with 1x PBS. In order to reduce the waste of DNA (especially for longer fragments), store the DNA taken from the substrate and reuse it.\nMulti-step lithography\n\tNOTE: For precise alignment of two or more exposures in a single area, keep the sample on the stage to avoid angular misalignment. Make sure the chip does not dry up. For the positioning of several DNA brushes in different regions on a substrate, use a motorized stage to drive to the designated area or use a substrate with appropriate alignment marks.\n\t\nAfter the first exposure (section 3.2), incubate DNA with DIS-sequence on the substrate. It is important that all binding sites resulting from the first exposure are occupied. Therefore, incubate oligonucleotides (10 µM) for approximately 3 h at RT.\nTo immobilize DIS-labeled genes, place them on the substrate for several hours or overnight at RT, then wash the sample and add the passivation mix for another 2 h at RT. Proceed with the next exposure.\nFor additional exposures, repeat the previous steps (3.2.3 - 3.3.2).\n4. PDMS Devices\nNOTE: Preferably, work in a clean-room. The fabrication of a PDMS device follows a standard protocol such as described by McDonald et al.30\nFabrication of master molds via photolithography",
    "Clean a silicon wafer (76.2 mm diameter, 525 µm thickness) by sonication in acetone for 5 min at high power and rinse with isopropyl alcohol and de-ionized water. Afterwards place the wafer on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min.\nOptionally, in order to improve the adhesion of resist to the wafer, add 2-3 mL adhesion promoter and spin at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Heat the wafer to 120 °C for 2 min.\nAdd about 2-3 mL photoresist (see Table of Materials). Spin the wafer for 15 s at 500 rpm, then at 3000 rpm for 30 s. This should result in a 20 µm thick layer of photoresist. Let the photoresist layer relax at room temperature for 10 min.\nFor the pre-exposure bake, place the wafer on a hot plate at 50 °C for 2 min, then at 85 °C for 5 min.\nPlace the wafer under the photomask with the blueprint of the compartments. Preferably, use a mask-aligner. The photomask should have a resolution of 64,000 dpi (see supplementary file with lithography masks and supplementary section 5).\nExpose the wafer for 1 min with UV-light (I-line 5-10 mW/cm2) through the photomask.\nFor the post-exposure bake, place the wafer at 50 °C for 2 min and then at 85 °C for 5 min. Let the wafer cool down and relax for 1 h at room temperature.\nPlace the wafer in a dish with developer for 3 min while gently agitating the beaker. Rinse the wafer with isopropyl alcohol and dry it with a nitrogen gun. Place the wafer on a hot plate at 130 °C for 45 min.\nPreparation of the PDMS device",
    "Mix PDMS base and PDMS curing agent in a 10:1 ratio and pour it onto the wafer in a closed container until a layer of about 5 mm has formed above the wafer. To obtain a PDMS device of only 1 mm thickness, instead spin coat the wafer with PDMS at 100 rpm for 2 min.\nPlace the container in a desiccator and apply a vacuum (about 85 kPa) for about 30 min. Then, heat the PDMS to about 70°C for 1-2 h in an oven.\nSeparate the PDMS device from the wafer. Cut the PDMS into slabs so that each piece contains one set of compartments. In case the PDMS will be connected to a microfluidic setup, punch holes (1 mm diameter) as an inlet and outlet at the ends of the supply channel.\nClean the PDMS with isopropyl alcohol and de-ionized water and dry it with a nitrogen gun. Store the PDMS dust-free.\n5. Compartmentalized Gene Expression\nNOTE: The following procedure describes the assembly of a sample holder (Figure 3) for the observation of compartmentalized gene expression on an inverted microscope with a cage incubator for temperature control. The holder was built using readily available materials and tools (3.5-5 mm thick polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, screws and nuts, drill) and can be customized to fit different types of microscopes. The steps described in 5.1 and 5.2 should be performed such that both parts of the holder are ready at the same time.\nBottom holder assembly\n\t\nPrepare a Bephore chip with alignment mark (e.g. a scratch) and glue it onto the chip holder using double-sided adhesive tape (Figure 3B). The chip should be larger than the PDMS device which will cover it.\nImmobilize one or multiple genes on the chip (see sections 2 and 3).",
    "Add some vacuum grease around the central hole of the bottom holder, then plug in the chip holder.\n\t\tNOTE: The chip holder now adheres to the bottom holder by means of the grease, while retaining the possibility for re-positioning of the chip in the x-y-plane.\nTop holder assembly\n\t\nPrepare a thin PDMS chip with compartments using the spin coating procedure in step 4.2.1. Cut the PDMS as small as possible, leaving a channel open to one side to allow for the exchange of waste and precursor molecules by diffusion.\nClean a glass cover slip (24 mm x 24 mm, no. 1.5) and the backside of the PDMS chip (side without compartments) with oxygen plasma for 42 s (operated at 200 W and 0.8 mbar with the sample in a Faraday cage).\nPlace the PDMS chip at the center of the glass slide with the compartments pointing upwards. Bake the glass with the PDMS for 1 h at 70 °C.\nAdd some vacuum grease around the large hole of the top holder.\nBefore starting the experiment, clean the glass slide and the PDMS chip with oxygen plasma for 42 s to render the PDMS hydrophilic.\nPlace the glass slide with the PDMS onto the top holder ( Figure 3C) and gently press the glass onto the grease (Figure 3C).\nHolder assembly\n\t\nPrepare 100 µL of a cell-free expression system and keep it on ice.\nCarefully remove the buffer from the chip and wash it once with 10 µL of cell-free expression system. Next, add 60 µL of cell-free expression system onto the chip and remove the two-component silicone glue from the edges of the chip (already removed in Figure 3B).",
    "Add 20 µL of expression system onto the PDMS. After placing the droplet onto the PDMS, quickly check in the stereoscopic microscope that the compartments are well wet and without air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, try to wash them off with the rest of the cell-free expression system.\nTo assemble the two pieces of the holder and to align chambers and DNA brushes, work under a stereoscopic microscope and immobilize the bottom holder with a gripper arm, so the two screws and wingnuts are easily accessible with both hands (Figure 3D-F).\nInsert the top holder into the bottom holder and lower it until the cell-free expression system droplets fuse (Figure 3D). Check through the stereoscopic microscope whether the compartments and the alignment mark are in a similar region in the x-y-plane, otherwise pull up the top holder and re-position the glass slide on the top holder.\nFrom the bottom, screw up the wingnuts until they touch the bottom side of the holder. Carefully tighten the wingnuts, while aligning the compartments and the chip in the x-y-plane via the handle at the bottom of the chip holder (Figure 3E). Once in contact, tighten the wingnuts only very gently (Figure 3F).\n\t\tNOTE: This step requires some experience and depends on the experimental setup. Under the microscope, interference patterns arising from liquid between PDMS and glass can indicate that the applied force is too small, while a lower fluorescence intensity (from a DNA brush or expressed proteins) in the center of a compartment hints at a too high pressure (see also supplementary information, section 6).\nSpray the sponge in the anti-evaporation enclosure with water and insert the holder into the box. Fill a 5 mL syringe with two-component silicone glue and use it to seal the box (Figure 3G).",
    "Transfer the box to a temperature-controlled microscope and image the DNA brush and the reaction in fluorescence microscopy. Even without illumination, the fluorescence of the DNA brush fades in a cell-free expression system. Nevertheless, the brush retains its activity, as can be shown by repeated gene expression from the same brush.\n\t\tNOTE: When using a Bephore glass slide instead of a silicon chip, the position (top/bottom) of PDMS and Bephore chip can be exchanged, allowing for the use of objectives with smaller working distances.\n6. Sustained Expression in Microfluidic Devices\nNOTE: The experimental setup is assembled from the parts shown in Figure 4A. Details on the assembly of the temperature-controlled stage are given in the supplementary information (section 7).\nCell-free expression system and tubing\n\t\nPrepare the cell-free expression system in a sample tube (about 200 µL). Polystyrene beads labeled with fluorescent dyes can be added to later monitor the flow rate through a supply channel.\nConnect the tube to a pressure controller. Place the tube in a large ice reservoir that keeps cold for about 12 hours. Refill ice if necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: As an alternative to a pressure controller, a syringe pump provides a constant flow rate of cell-free expression system even if the flow resistance changes, e.g. due to air bubbles, which might help with long term experiments.\nConnect the tube containing the cell-free expression system to PTFE tubing (inner diameter of 0.8 mm), which reaches to the heated stage. Break a syringe needle (diameter of 0.9 mm) into 1-2 cm pieces with blunt ends and insert one piece into the PTFE tubing. It will later serve as connector to the PDMS. Try to minimize the length of the tubing between the stage and the tube (Figure 4C).",
    "To cool the PTFE tubing, wrap it around larger rubber tubing that is connected to an ice water reservoir and a peristaltic pump. Tape them together with Scotch tape (Figure 4C).\nTop holder assembly\n\t\nClean the flat side of the PDMS chip with oxygen plasma (42 s) and place it on a microscopy slide with holes fitting inlet and outlet of the PDMS (Figure 4B). The holes in the glass can be drilled beforehand with a glass drilling head. Make sure that the micro-chambers are not facing the glass slide.\nApply double-sided adhesive tape to the flat side of the PDMS holder. Stick a piece of black foil (e.g. from a lithography mask) in the region between the two holes of the holder to avoid background fluorescence from the adhesive tape.\nStick the glass slide with the PDMS chip to the holder.\nTreat the PDMS and the PDMS holder with the attached glass slide with oxygen plasma in a plasma cleaner (42 s).\nApply vacuum grease around the large hole in the top holder and insert the PDMS holder (Figure 4B). The PDMS holder now adheres to the top holder, while retaining the possibility for re-positioning in x-y directions.\nConnect the PTFE tubing with the syringe needle connector to the inlet of the PDMS chip. To facilitate access to the PDMS through the top holder, the upper plastic plate can be briefly removed for this and the following step.\nInsert a second piece of PTFE tubing (about 5 cm) with a syringe needle connector at the outlet (Figure 4D).\nPosition the PDMS holder in the top holder so it is free to move in all directions. Place the top holder loosely onto the heated stage like in Figure 4E without tightening any wingnuts.",
    "With the microscope, navigate to the position of the PDMS compartments and center them in the camera's field of view. Do not move the stage from this point on.\nRemove the top holder with the PDMS from the stage.\nHeated stage and Bephore glass slide\n\t\nSet the temperature of the heated stage to 37 °C\nGlue a Bephore glass slide (no. 4) with the gene brushes to the temperature-controlled stage of the inverted fluorescence microscope using double sided adhesive tape, with the alignment mark approximately at the center of the microscope's field of view. This positioning of the alignment mark ensures that the compartments will be lowered roughly to the same region.\nTake an image in the corresponding fluorescence channel of the gene brush and mark its position in the camera image.\nRemove the buffer from the gene brush, but do not let it go dry. Add 20 µL of the cell- free expression system to the gene brush and use tweezers to remove the silicone glue frame.\nAssembly of the microfluidic setup\n\t\nAdd pressure to the sample tube until the cell-free expression system has filled the PTFE tubing and appears at the bottom of the PDMS device. Additionally, pipette 10 µL of cell-free expression system onto the micro-chambers on the PDMS. Make sure the compartments are free of air bubbles.\nCarefully lower the top holder onto the glass slide and align the micro-chambers with the gene brush. Before both PDMS and alignment mark reach the same focal plane, use the small screws at the back of the PDMS holder to precisely align the x-y-position and orientation of the PDMS device with the gene brush (Figure 4E).",
    "Hold the position and press the PDMS onto the glass slide by tightening the wingnuts along the screws that connect the top holder to the microscope stage (Figure 4E).\nIncrease the pressure in the tube containing the cell-free expression system and monitor the flow of the fluorescent beads through the supply channel (flow rates between 0.5 to 5 µl per hour are recommended) (Figure 4F). If necessary, increase the pressure of the PDMS on the glass by tightening the wingnuts.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
