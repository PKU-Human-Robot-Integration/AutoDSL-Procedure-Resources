    "This protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Instituto Nacional de Perinatología in Mexico City (Registry number 212250-21041). All procedures performed in these studies were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Instituto Nacional de Perinatología, the Helsinki Declaration, and the guidelines set forth in the Ministry of Health’s Official Mexican Standard.\n1. Preparation\nPrepare a solution of 1x PBS with EDTA. To do so, add 500 μL of 0.5 M EDTA stock into 500 mL of 1x PBS for a final concentration of 0.5 mM EDTA.\nPrepare the culture medium for HAEC. Take 450 mL of high glucose-DMEM, supplement it with 5 mL of sodium pyruvate (100 mM), 50 mL of heat-inactive fetal bovine serum qualified for stem cells, 5 mL of nonessential amino acids (100x), 5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic (100x), 5 mL of L-glutamine (200 mM), and 500 μL of mercaptoethanol (1,000x).\nSterilize the containers for transporting and processing the tissue: a stainless steel container with a lid to transport the whole placenta from the operating theater to the laboratory, a tray (20 cm x 30 cm x 8 cm) to wash and remove blood from the whole placenta before the dissection of the amniotic membrane, and a plastic cutting board to separate the amniotic membrane into the three regions.\nSterilize the surgical instruments (scalpels, scissors, forceps, and clamps), 500 mL beakers, cotton gauzes, and saline solution.\n2. Obtaining placental tissue\nNOTE: The amniotic membranes were obtained from women at full-term gestation (37−40 weeks), under indication of Cesarean delivery, without any evidence of active labor, and no microbiological characteristics of infection. The complete isolation and culture procedures were carried out within a biosecurity cabinet under sterile conditions.",
    "In the operating room, clamp the umbilical cord to prevent the blood flow to the rest of the tissue. Collect the entire placenta with the umbilical cord clamped in the sterile container.\nAdd 500 mL of saline solution to the container to hydrate the placenta.\nClose the container and transport the tissue to the laboratory at room temperature.\nPut the container with the placenta inside the biosecurity cabinet.\n\tNOTE: In case the dissection is not carried out within 15 min of collecting the placenta, store the container with the placenta on ice until processing. Avoid more than 1 h of elapsed time between obtaining the placenta and the start of the dissection.\n3. Mechanical separation per region of the amniotic membrane\nNOTE: The procedure must be carried out within a biosecurity cabinet under sterile conditions and at room temperature.\nRemove the whole placenta from the container and place it on the tray with the umbilical cord facing upward.\nUsing a sterile cotton gauze, clean the blood clots from the surface of the chorion-amnion that covers the placenta.\nIdentify the three regions of the membrane: the umbilical amnion enveloping the umbilical cord, the placental amnion covering the decidua basalis, and the reflected region, which is the rest of amnion that is not attached to the placenta (Figure 1).\nDissect the umbilical amnion region (Figure 2A).\n\t\nUsing dissecting forceps, hold the portion of amnion membrane that covers the junction of the placenta and umbilical cord.\nWith a scalpel, dissect the region that surrounds the cord while stretching to separate it from the chorion.\nDeposit the separated tissue in a labeled beaker with 100 mL of saline solution.\nDissect the placental amnion region (Figure 2B).",
    "With a sterile cotton gauze, remove the blood clots from the surface of the chorion-amnion that covers the placenta.\nHold the membrane on the border between the placenta and the reflected region with dissecting forceps.\nCut along the circumference of the placenta with the scalpel.\nSeparate the placental amnion from the chorion, being careful not to cut any vessels from the placenta.\nPlace the separated tissue in another labeled beaker with 300 mL of saline solution.\nSeparate the rest of the amniotic membrane that is not attached to the placenta (i.e., the reflected portion) from the chorion (Figure 2C).\n\t\nCollect the reflected region in another labeled beaker with 300 mL of saline solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Add saline solution continually during the dissection to prevent tissue from drying out.\n4. Washing the membranes\nNOTE: The procedure must be carried out within a biosecurity cabinet under sterile conditions at room temperature.\nDiscard the saline solution of each membrane region separately.\nAdd 100 mL of fresh saline solution to the umbilical region.\nAdd 300 mL of fresh saline solution to the placental and reflected regions respectively.\nStir the membranes with the help of dissecting forceps to remove blood residue.\nDiscard the saline solution.\nRepeat the washes and agitation at least 3x until the membranes are translucent.\nPlace and extend the membranes on the board to clean with sterile gauze the blood clots that were not removed with the washes.\n\tNOTE: It is very important to remove as many erythrocytes as possible, as their presence affects the trypsin function and the viability of subsequent cell cultures.\n5. Enzymatic digestion of the membranes from different regions\nNOTE: The procedure must be carried out within a biosecurity cabinet under sterile conditions.\nCut the reflected and placental regions into two or three fragments.",
    "Do not cut the umbilical region.\nPlace the fragments of each region in centrifuge tubes. Add 20 mL of 0.5% trypsin/EDTA to the reflected and placental regions and 5 mL of 0.5% trypsin/EDTA to the umbilical region, respectively.\n\tNOTE: It is important to cut the reflected and placental regions into smaller pieces because they need to be completely immersed in the trypsin solution.\nShake the centrifuge tubes lightly for 30 s. Discard the trypsin.\nAdd 30 mL of new 0.5% trypsin/EDTA to the reflected and placental regions and 15 mL of new 0.5% trypsin/EDTA to the umbilical region, respectively.\nPlace the tubes in a rotator inside the incubator.\nIncubate with rotation (20 rpm) for 40 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: If a tube rotator is not available, shake the tubes lightly manually every 10 min.\nTransfer the trypsin/cell solutions from each region into new centrifuge tubes.\nAdd 2x the volume of HAEC media prewarmed at 37 °C per tube to inactivate the enzyme.\nStore the first digestion on ice.\nRepeat steps 5.6−5.8 for a second digestion period.\nFor each region, hold one end of the amnion portion using dissecting forceps, and with another pair squeeze along the tissue to remove rows of epithelial cells that did not completely peel off during previous incubation periods.\nCollect the second digestion into another set of centrifuge tubes and inactivate with 2x the volume of HAEC media.\nDiscard the digested membranes into a biohazard container.\n6. Isolation of the HAEC\nNOTE: The procedure must be carried out within a biosecurity cabinet under sterile conditions.\nCentrifuge all tubes at 200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 10 mL of prewarmed HAEC media (to 37 °C) per tube and pipet gently to disaggregate each pellet.",
    "Combine the cellular suspensions of the two digestions in an individual tube for each membrane region.\nFilter the cellular suspensions using 100 μm cell strainers to remove the extracellular matrix debris and obtain single cells.\nPrepare three aliquots with 90 µL of trypan blue in a microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 10 μL of each cell suspension per membrane region into the microcentrifuge tubes and mix.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer under a light field microscope.\n7. Culture of HAEC\nSeed the HAEC from the three regions separately at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 with prewarmed HAEC media, supplemented with 10 ng/mL of human epidermal growth factor (EGF).\n\t\nSeed the cells in 100 mm plates to maintain them in vitro or in 24 well plates for immunochemical analysis.\nIncubate the dishes at 37 °C under normoxic conditions (5% CO2) in a humidified incubator.\nAdd EGF daily and change the medium every third day.\n\tNOTE: The cells will become confluent after 4−6 days.\nUse the cells for conventional immunohistochemistry, cell sorting analysis, cryopreserving, RNA and protein extraction, or to continue the passage.\n8. Passage of HAEC\nRemove the HAEC medium and wash 2x with PBS/EDTA 0.01M solution.\nIncubate with a PBS/EDTA 0.01M solution for 15 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the PBS/EDTA and add 1.5 mL of 0.5% trypsin/EDTA.\nIncubate for 5−8 min at 37 °C.\nInactivate the enzyme with two volumes of HAEC media.\nCollect the mixed solution and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g.\nCount the cells and continue with following passages or use the cells for further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
