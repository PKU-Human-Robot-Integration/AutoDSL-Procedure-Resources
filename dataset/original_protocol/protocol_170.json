    "**HeLa Protein Preparation**\n1. Grow HeLa Kyoto cells in DMEM and arrest the growth with nocodazol over night. \n  2. Harvest cells with a scraper and wash three times with PBS. One tray \\(25 cm x 25 cm; 100 mL medium) generates approximately 4 mg of protein.\n  3. Suspend the cell pellet in lysis buffer using twice its volume and disrupt the cell membrane by pulling the suspension through a thin needle \\(first 21 then 27 gauge). Centrifuge the suspension at 500 g in a cooling centrifuge \\(4°C) for 15 min.\n  \n**Acetone precipitation of proteins**\n4. Add 5 times the volume of chilled acetone to the protein solution and incubate the sample at minus 30 °C. \n  5. Centrifuge the suspension at 500 g in a cooling centrifuge \\(4°C) for  30 min. \n  6. Discard the supernatant and carefully suspend the protein pellet with 80% chilled acetone and repeat the centrifugation. \n  7. Air-dry the pellet avoiding complete desiccation and dissolve the protein pellet in the digestion buffer \\(8 M urea, 0.5 M ammoniumbicarbonat) to a protein concentration of 5 µg/µL. The protein solution should have a pH of 8.0. in our laboratory we measure protein concentration using a Bradford assay.\n  \n**Reduction and alkylation of proteins**\n8. Add 1 µg DTT stock solution up to a final concentration of 0.05 µg DTT per µg protein and incubate the sample for 30 min at 56 °C, shaking. \n  9. Next add iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 0.25 µg per µg protein and incubate the sample for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. \n  10. Quench the reaction by adding DTT stock solution up to a final concentration of 0.25 µg DTT per µg protein\n  \n**Digestion with Lys-C**",
    "11. Dilute the sample to 6 M urea with 50 mM ammoniumbicarbonat buffer and add Lys-C to a final concentration of 1 µg per 50 µg protein. \n  12. Incubate the sample at 30 °C for 2 h. Next, digest the predigested protein sample with trypsin starting with diluting the solution to 0.8 M urea with 50mM ammoniumbicarbonat buffer. \n  13. Add 1 µg trypsin per 60 µg protein and incubate the sample for 2 h at 37 °C. \n  14. Add another aliquot of 1 µg trypsin per 60 µg protein and incubate the sample at 37 °C over night. The digest is stopped by acidifying the sample to a pH of 2 by adding TFA.\n  15. Peptide mixtures should and stored in aliquots at minus 80º C."
