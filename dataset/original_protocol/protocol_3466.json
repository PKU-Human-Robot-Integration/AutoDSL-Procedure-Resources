    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLectin staining of fixed-frozen tissue sections\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this section, lectin histochemistry of tissues is performed to investigate specifically the spatial distribution of glycans in the tissue, which can be eventually combined with antibody staining. Tissue-dependent modifications are outlined in the relevant steps.\nNote: This protocol is a combination and optimization of other methods previously published by (Brooks and Hall, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Mohd Isa et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Kilcoyne et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Contessotto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCritical: Once the staining procedure starts (after the first wash and throughout the whole procedure), it is crucial to always keep the tissue wet and not allow it to dry.\nLeave tissue frozen (cryostat) sections on a slide warmer at room temperature (~18°C–23°C) between 30 min to 1 h (depending on the size of the tissue) before starting the staining to enable evaporation of moisture and to improve tissue adhesion to the slide.\nIf the tissue used was not fixed before being frozen, incubate sections with 4% PFA solution on the slide for 2 min (inside fume hood)\nCircle/frame each tissue section with a PAP pen to avoid leakage of the lectin solution away from the tissue section. The PAP pen creates a hydrophobic barrier, allowing the use of less reagents.\nNote: If the hydrophobic barrier vanishes throughout the following steps, carefully dry the borders of the glass close to the tissue section and repeat this step.\nWash sections with TBS-T three times, for 3 min each at RT (~18°C–23°C) in a glass Coplin staining jar placed on a shaking platform at a low speed (60 – 80 rotations per minute (rpm)).\nMonitor the sections to be sure they do not detach from the slide. If this happens, check Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Lay out the slides with the fixed-frozen sections horizontally, with the tissue section facing up, in an opaque (blackout) StainTray slide staining system.\nAlternatives: If a StainTray slide staining system is not available, the slides might be placed on glass rods in an opaque sandwich box lined with damp filter paper or other similar alternatives.\nBlock sections with 3% periodate-treated BSA in TBS, for 1 h at RT (~18°C–23°C).\nNote: Blocking solution should be prepared fresh just before the start of this procedure.\nWash sections with TBS three times, for 3 min each at RT (~18°C–23°C) in a glass Coplin staining jar, with gentle shaking.\nCritical: From this point, do not expose your samples to direct light for an extended period of time. It is suggested to carry out the remaining steps in darkness or under a red light to prevent the quenching of fluorescence.\nIncubate sections with fluorescently labeled lectins diluted in TBS-T for 1 h at RT (~18°C–23°C) in a dark chamber (e.g., StainTray slide staining system or an alternative opaque staining equipment).\nWe recommend performing a titration experiment to identify the optimal concentration of lectin to be used, as mentioned above. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for binding specificity of a selection of relevant lectins and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for suggested experimental design.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/353-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Suggested experimental design to perform at the beginning of the assay to optimize the lectin concentration to use and to confirm its specificity\nCritical: Working solutions of lectins should be prepared fresh 30 min before each staining and discarded at the end of the experiment.",
    "Note: The fluorescent label on the lectins should be selected according to the lasers of fluorescence available in the microscope. However, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) are the most commonly commercially available and used fluorescent tags for lectins.\nIn parallel, perform haptenic sugar inhibition controls by pre- and co-incubating each lectin with 100 mM of the appropriate sugar in TBS-T at RT (~18°C–23°C) (Akimoto and Kawakami, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for list of haptenic sugars to use with a selection of relevant lectins. Lectins should be prepared in the relevant sugar in TBS-T and pre-incubated for at least 30 min before adding to the tissue and continuing the sugar-lectin co-incubation on the tissue. A positive control should also be performed in parallel to ensure successful labeling. This could be done by using a tissue section that has been reported to display the glycan residues the lectin is specific to (Akimoto and Kawakami, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: The specificity of a lectin is characterized by the sugar residue that inhibits the interaction between the lectin-binding site(s) and its respective glycan. This sugar (haptenic sugar) displays a competitive binding to the lectin-binding sites in relation to the carbohydrate motifs present in the tissue sample (Marks and Rodnight, 1978[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Gerlach et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Decreased binding in the presence of the haptenic sugar indicates the specificity of the lectin for the sugar. Complete inhibition (negative labeling) might also occur in some cases; however, this does not always happen and it is more common to expect a marked diminution in labeling intensity. No change in binding intensity indicates that lectin binding to the tissue was non-specific or mediated by a non-carbohydrate binding site on the lectin.",
    "Wash sections with TBS-T twice, for 3 min each, and then once with TBS∗ at RT (~18°C–23°C). We suggest performing drop washes while keeping the sections horizontal in the StainTray slide staining system (or alternative opaque staining equipment). The final wash in TBS without detergent avoids the retention of minimal bubbles on the tissue section.\n∗If staining brain tissue: wash twice with TBS-T for 10 min each and twice with TBS for 10 min each. This is recommended for brain tissue due to its high content in lipids and in auto fluorescent lipofuscin, which increases the background signal. Longer and increased number of washes can help to reduce non-specific signal.\nOptional: Starting from this point, lectin histochemistry can be combined with immunohistochemistry. For more details, see next step “Antibody staining following lectin incubation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].”\nCounterstain either with Hoechst 33342, diluted 1:2,000 (final concentration at 0.01 mM) in TBS for 5 to 10 min, at RT (~18°C–23°C), or with ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (a single drop is sufficient for an approx. 0.5 cm2-sized tissue section).\nIf Hoechst 33342 is used, wash sections with TBS three times, for 3 min each∗ at RT (~18°C–23°C).\n∗If staining brain tissue (or other tissues rich in auto fluorescent lipofuscin): after these washes, incubate with 0.1% Sudan black B solution in 70% ethanol (1 mg/mL) in a glass Coplin staining jar for 5 min at RT (~18°C–23°C). Wash then with TBS twice at RT (~18°C–23°C), for 4 min each.\nNote: Sudan black B solution can be re-used up to three times. Sudan black B binds to lipofuscin (granules rich in lipids, and abundant in the adult brain and other tissues), reducing/eliminating tissue auto fluorescence and background that usually arises from these granules (Oliveira et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).",
    "After washing excess Hoechst 33342, apply one or two drops of Fluoromount™ aqueous mounting media and cover the slide with a glass coverslip (a single drop is sufficient for an approx. 0.5 cm2-sized tissue section). If ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant was used previously, this step would not be necessary.\nLeave slides to cure overnight (~16 h) at RT (~18°C–23°C, in the dark) and seal around the edges of the coverslip with clear nail polish to prevent the coverslip from sliding and the mountant from drying out.\nKeep slides at 4°C until imaging. We recommend imaging within 4 days for best results. For precious samples, stained slides can be stored at −20°C for up to 1 month.\nImage stained slides by using a fluorescence microscope. Confocal microscopy enables the acquisition of images from several planes within the tissue section, in a Z-stack, providing a better resolution.\nCritical: Image stained slides within 4 days. For unexpected outcomes, check Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nAntibody staining following lectin incubation\nTiming: up to 2 days\nIn this step, immunohistochemistry can be carried out after lectin staining to complement the previous analysis. This procedure allows for the co-localization of glycan distribution with certain cell types or specific antigens present in the tissue. A general protocol is given, and tissue-dependent modifications are outlined in the appropriate steps.\nPause Point: Tissue sections already lectin stained can be kept overnight covered with TBS in a humidified chamber before starting the immunostaining procedure if the operator cannot continue immediately after performing the lectin histochemistry.",
    "Critical: The whole immunostaining step should be carried out in darkness or in a red-light room since the tissue was already incubated with fluorescently labeled lectins and it is crucial to prevent the quenching of the fluorescence. Additionally, the whole immunostaining procedure should be done by placing the slides in a humidified chamber to prevent them from drying.\nNote: A prior optimization for the immunostaining should be performed to detect the optimal primary antibody dilution and incubation conditions (time and temperature – usually the primary antibody should be incubated overnight at 4°C or for 2 h at RT). In addition, the usage of either TBS or TBS-T should be tested for the specific antibody to avoid interference with an optimal positive signal intensity (e.g., monoclonal vs polyclonal). The respective negative control should be done in parallel, where sections are incubated with a non-related or isotype control antibody, to assess if there is non-specific binding of the secondary antibody to the tissue. It may be appropriate to block with normal serum to avoid FC-mediated false-positive staining. However, this may affect previous lectin binding as serum contains glycoproteins, so appropriate controls should be employed during staining optimization.\nCritical: The whole immunostaining step should be carried out continuing to use TBS and not switching to PBS.\nKeep slides in the StainTray slide staining system (or alternative opaque staining equipment) and block with 3% periodate-treated BSA in TBS, for 1 h at RT (~18°C–23°C).",
    "Note: This step (2nd blocking) is not crucial and might be skipped. This will depend on antibody staining, as nuclear antibody stains may require serum-based blocking. While this may have an effect on previous lectin staining, this must be optimized by the end-user using appropriate controls to determine suitability of each counterstain, ensuring specificity and minimal off-target binding. Immunohistochemical counterstaining should be reconsidered if interference occurs.\nIncubate sections with primary antibody at the concentration, time and temperature optimized previously (usually the primary antibody should be incubated overnight (~16 h) at 4°C or for 2 h at RT (~18°C–23°C), diluted in either TBS or TBS-T).\nWash sections twice with TBS-T for 10 min each and once with TBS for 10 min, at RT (~18°C–23°C). These should be drop washes while keeping the sections horizontal in the StainTray slide staining system (or alternative opaque staining equipment)∗.\n∗If staining brain tissue (or other tissues with potential auto fluorescence): vertical washes are recommended using a glass Coplin staining jar.\nIncubate sections with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody diluted in TBS (at optimized dilution) for 1 h at RT (~18°C–23°C).\nCritical: The secondary antibody and lectin used must be labeled with fluorophores with a narrow absorption wavelength without spectral overlap with each other. For instance, if the lectin is FITC-labeled (λex = 488 nm, λem = 525 nm), then the secondary antibody cannot be Alexa Fluor 532 (λex = 532 nm, λem = 554 nm) as they would emit at an overlapping wavelength spectrum, causing significant bleed through. A more appropriate combination would be FITC (λex = 488 nm, λem = 525 nm) and Alexa Fluor 647 (λex = 650 nm, λem = 671 nm), for example.",

These should be drop washes while keeping the sections horizontal in the StainTray slide staining system (or alternative opaque staining equipment).\n∗If staining brain/cardiac tissue (or other tissues rich in auto fluorescent lipofuscin): wash once with TBS-T for 10 min each and three times with TBS for 10 min each; vertical washes are recommended using a glass Coplin staining jar.\nCounterstain either with Hoechst 33342, diluted 1:2,000 (final concentration at 0.01 mM) in TBS for 5 to 10 min at RT (~18°C–23°C) or with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (single drop is sufficient for an approx. 0.5 cm2-sized tissue section).\nIf Hoechst 33342 is used, wash sections with TBS three times, for 3 min each∗\n∗If staining brain tissue (or other tissues rich in auto fluorescent lipofuscin): after these washes, incubate with 0.1% Sudan black B solution in 70% ethanol (1 mg/mL) in a glass Coplin staining jar for 5 min at room temperature.
