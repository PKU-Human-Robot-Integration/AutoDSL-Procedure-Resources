Genes encoding prey proteins are cloned into the pEXP5-CT/TOPO vector using the TOPO cloning system. B. Expression of C-terminal His-tagged recombinant proteins by cell-free in vitro transcription/translation. C. Co-immunoprecipitation is performed to analyze interaction between the His-tagged prey and GST-tagged bait using a bait-specific antibody. An anti-His antibody was used for prey detection and an anti-GST antibody for examining bait precipitation.TOPO cloning for His-tagged protein construct (see Figure 1)Primer design: The forward primer of the candidate gene should include “CACC” upstream of the “ATG” start codon at the 5'-end of the primer: e.g., 5'-CACCATG(N)25-3'. The reverse primer is designed without stop codon for the His-tag fusion at the C-terminus of recombinant protein.Amplify the candidate gene. We recommend the use of the ExTaq polymerase, which generates DNA products with an adenine overhang at the 3'-end.Purify the DNA product via 0.8-1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by gel-extraction. The QIAEX® II Gel Extraction Kit was recommended.Clone the extracted DNA product into the pEXP5-CT/TOPO® vector (Table 1). Table 1. Components for the cloning reaction table:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Amount\nPurified DNA (0.05-1 μg),x μl\nSalt solution,0.5 μl\npEXP5-CT/TOPO® vector,0.5 μl\nH2O,To 3 μl",
    "Incubate the reaction for 20 min at room temperature.Transform the plasmid into E. coli strain DH5α at 42 °C for 60 sec. Grow the transformed bacteria on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 16 h.Screen the positive clones by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the T7 forward primer and gene-specific reverse primer.Grow the bacteria in LB liquid culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (220 rpm) for 16 h.Extract plasmid DNA by PrestoTM Mini Plasmid Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Confirm the selected clones by DNA sequencing.Expression of the recombinant protein via single-step in vitro transcription/translation (see Figure 1)Note: The reaction volume is suggested as 100 μl (50 μl initial reaction and 50 μl feed buffer); however, it can be reduced to 25 μl (12.5 μl initial reaction and 12.5 μl feed buffer) for increasing the utility of the protein expression kit by 4 times in our screening protocol.Prepare the initial in vitro transcription/translation reaction in a 1.7-ml tube using the ExpresswayTM Cell-Free E. coli Expression System (Table 2). Each recombinant protein was expressed individually in an independent reaction with its plasmid (1 μg).Table 2. Components for initial in vitro transcription/translation table:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Amount\nE. coli slyD- extract,5 μl\n2.5x IVPS buffer,5 μl\n50 mM amino acids (without met),0.3125 μl\n75 mM methionine,0.25 μl\nT7 enzyme mix,0.25 μl\npEXP5 plasmid DNA,1 μg\nH2O,To 12.5 μl\nIncubate the reaction for 30 min at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (220 rpm).Apply the feed buffer (Table 3) to the initial reaction and gently mix for several times by inverting the tube.Table 3. Feed buffer componentstable:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Amount\n2x IVPS feed buffer,6.25 μl\n50 mM amino acid,0.3125 μl\n75 mM methionine,0.25 μl\nH2O,To 12.5 μl",
    "Continue the reaction at 37 °C with shaking (220 rpm) for another 2.5 h (total 3 h). Note: The yield increases alone with incubation time from 3-6 h, as indicated in manufacturer’s protocol; however, in our tested system, protein degradation can occur for at least two expressed proteins when the reaction time is extended to 5 h (Figure 2). Therefore, we recommend a total incubation time of 3 h.Examine the expressed protein by Western analysis (Figure 2).Sample preparation: Save 5 μl expressed protein from 25 μl reaction and add equal volume of 2x sample buffer.Boil the protein sample at 100 °C for 10 min and cool down on ice for 5 min.Apply 5 μl boiled protein extract into SDS-PAGE analysis.Perform Western blotting with the anti-His (C-term)-HRP antibody.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160502/20160502190555_6969.jpgFigure 2. Example of detection of protein after in vitro transcription/translation. Tobacco proteins PI1 and PI2 (Lin et al., 2015) fused to a 6x His tag (PI1-His and PI2-His) were expressed via single-step in vitro transcription/translation with an incubation time of 3 h or 5 h. Coomassie blue staining (*) was used as loading control.Protein-protein interaction and co-immunoprecipitation (see Figure 1)Bait protein: A recombinant protein expressed in and purified from E. coli can be used for screening interacting partners (prey proteins). The desired tag [herein, a GST-tagged CP (GST-CP) protein] can be added when producing the bait protein. The CP gene was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector by BamHI and XhoI digestion and ligation.Prey protein: His-tagged recombinant protein produced via in vitro transcription/translation.Note: A negative control is required to avoid the false positive reactions. Replace the His-tagged interacting candidate product with a GFP-His in vitro transcription/translation product as a negative control.",
    "Incubate 4 μl of crude reaction mixture from the in vitro transcription/translation reaction (prey) with 2 μg bait protein (herein, GST-CP recombinant protein) in 1 ml co-precipitation buffer for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation on an Eppendorf mixer with 5 rpm (mode 01).Balance the Protein G PLUS-agarose beads. Spin the agarose beads (30 μl suspension per co-IP reaction) at 2,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature, then remove the supernatant without disturbing the resin. Wash the beads with 0.5 ml H2O and repeat the spin procedure. Finally suspend the beads in 0.3 ml co-precipitation buffer.Add 10 μg of the anti-bait antibody (herein, anti-CP antibody) and balanced Protein G PLUS-agarose beads to the 1 h reaction mixture and incubate at room temperature on an Eppendorf mixer with 5 rpm (mode 01) for another 1 h.Centrifuge the reaction at 2,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature to sediment (pull down) the immunoprecipitant.Remove the supernatant and wash the immunoprecipitant twice with 0.5 ml wash buffer. Centrifuge the reaction at 2,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature for each wash and then remove the supernatant.Suspend the precipitant in 20 μl 2x sample buffer.Boil the protein sample at 100 °C for 10 min and then cool down on ice for 5 min.Perform Western analysis (apply 10-20 μl protein on the SDS-PAGE) for prey detection using the anti-His (C-term)-HRP antibody; and an anti-tag antibody (herein, anti-GST monoclonal antibody) was used for detection of the bait GST-CP. The official interacting data can be found in Lin et al. (2015)."
