    "Ethics approval was obtained from the ethical committee of the TU Dresden (#EK451122014).\n1. Organoid Culture and Preparations Before Electroporation\nEstablish organoids by tissue digestion as described previously and expand them with their corresponding entity specific culture medium in a basement matrix (overview see Table 1 and Table of Materials)11,12,13,14,15,16,17.\n\tNOTE: For human tissue samples informed consent and approval of the study by an ethical committee is necessary.\nPrewarm 48-well plates at 37 °C for post-electroporation seeding.\nPrepare basal medium w/o antibiotics as well as entity specific organoid culture medium w/o antibiotics (see Table 1) including 10 µM Y-27632 and 3 µM CHIR99021.\n\tNOTE: The withdrawal of antibiotics is important to reduce toxic effects. Y-27632 and CHIR99021 ameliorate cell recovery10.\nPreparation of the organoids (see Figure 1)\n\t\nCultivate 5 wells of organoids in a 48-well plate per electroporation sample in culture medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Proliferative organoids should be used (around 2-3 days after last splitting).\nPrepare 230 µL of dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) including 10 µM Y-27632 per well.\nRemove the culture medium from each well and dissociate the organoids mechanically in 230 µL of the prepared dissociation mixture. Pool 5 wells per electroporation sample into one 15 mL tube.\nMix by vortexing and incubate for 5-15 min at 37 °C until clusters of 10-15 cells occur. Therefore, check the dissociation microscopically. Stop the digestion by adding basal medium w/o antibiotics up to 10 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is very critical! The electroporation efficiency will be reduced, when incubation is too short, but long digestion will reduce survivability.\nCentrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant and wash twice with 4 mL of electroporation buffer (see Table of Materials).\n2. Electroporation",
    "NOTE: The following protocol is developed for electroporators capable of square waves and separated poring and transfer pulse sequences (see Figure 2). Optionally, impedance values as well as the voltages, currents and energies transferred into the sample can be measured as control for reproducible experiments.\nResuspend the organoid pellet in 100 µL of electroporation buffer (see Table of Materials) containing 30 µg of plasmid DNA.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of the used plasmid DNA should exceed 5 µg/µL for an optimal salt concentration during the electroporation process. Therefore, endofree plasmid maxi kits (see Table of Materials) for the preparation of vectors are recommended. A total amount up to 45 µg of DNA can be used without cytotoxic effects.\nDispense the complete DNA-organoid mixture into an electroporation cuvette with 2 mm gap width without producing air bubbles.\nSet the electroporation parameters according to Fujii et al.10 (see Table 2, Figure 2).\nMix the cells slightly without foaming by tapping the cuvette with a finger. Place the cuvette into the cuvette chamber.\nPress the Ω button of the electroporator and make a note of the impedance value.\n\tNOTE: An impedance between 30-40 Ω showed the best results. In general, it should be in the range between 30-55 Ω. If this is not the case, please control the following aspects: gap width of the cuvette used, cable connections of the electroporator, possible air bubbles, correct volume and salt concentration of the electroporation mixture.\nPress the Start button to execute the electroporation program and control the values of currents, voltages and energies displayed.\n\tNOTE: The values of measured voltages, currents and energies should correspond to the set electroporation parameters. For the comparison of repeated experiments, it can be helpful to note these data.",
    "After electroporation, immediately add 500 µL of culture medium w/o antibiotics (with CHIR99021 and Y-27632; see step 1.3). Mix by pipetting up and down to dissociate the white foam.\n\tNOTE: The white foam appears after the electroporation process and a significant number of cells is attached to it. So, dissociation of it is very important for not losing cells.\nTransfer the sample completely from the cuvette into a new 15 mL tube using the pipette belonging to the electroporation cuvettes (see Table of Materials). Rinsing the cuvette again with basal medium is recommended to obtain remaining cells.\nFor regeneration of the cells, incubate them for 40 min at room temperature.\n3. Seeding of Cells\nCentrifuge the cells at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 µL of basement matrix and seed 20 µL drops in a prewarmed 48-well plate (see step 1.2). Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C for polymerization and add 250 µL of culture medium, which is supplemented with Y-27632 and CHIR99021 until the next splitting of the grown organoids (around 5-7 days).\n4. Determination of Transfection Efficiency\nNOTE: In general, it is recommended to electroporate a vector carrying a fluorescence marker as additional transfection control. Dependent on the chosen marker and its chromophore maturation the fluorescence will be visible within around 24-48 h post transfection18.\nCheck the fluorescence microscopically after 24-48 h in the transfection control (see Figure 4B).\nFluorescent activated cell scanning (FACS)\nHarvest the cells analogously to step 1.4.2-1.4.4 and digest around 10-20 min until there are single cells. Add up to 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCentrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.",
    "Optionally for discrimination of living cells: Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and add a suitable antibody (see Table of Materials) or propidium iodide (PI). Mix very carefully only by tapping and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Wash with 10 mL of PBS, centrifuge and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of PBS and optionally filter the suspension through a 100 µm cell strainer into a FACS tube.\nAnalyze the cells by a FACS machine using an appropriate gating strategy (see Figure 3; Figure 4A) and determine the transfection efficiency."
