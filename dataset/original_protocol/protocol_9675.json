    "1. Media and buffer preparation\nPreparation of 2xYT+P medium (solid and liquid)\n\t\nPrepare liquid and solid media as described in Table 1, and then sterilize by autoclaving.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol requires one 2xYT+P agar plate containing chloramphenicol (10 µg/mL). The volume of liquid media is proportional to the volume of the lysate required. Here, a starting volume of 5 L of liquid 2xYT+P media is used. However, the volume can be adjusted as needed, knowing that 1 L of the cell culture results in 2 to 3 mL of the final cell lysate.\nPreparation of chloramphenicol (34 mg/mL)\n\t\nWeigh 0.34 g of chloramphenicol, add ethanol to 10 mL, and dissolve by mixing. Aliquot 1 mL each into several tubes, and store at -20 °C to use later.\nPreparation of S30A buffer\n\t\nPrepare S30A buffer according to Table 2, aiming for 2 L of this buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Once again, the volume of this buffer is proportional to the volume of the lysate required.\nBefore autoclaving, adjust the buffer's pH to 7.7 using glacial acetic acid.\nAutoclave the buffer.\nKeep this buffer at 4 °C after autoclaving.\nBefore use, add DTT (filtered by a 0.22 µm membrane filter) to the S30A buffer to reach a final concentration of 2 mM (2 mL of stock 1 M DTT to 1 L of S30A buffer).\n\t\tNOTE: Once again, the volume of this buffer is proportional to the volume of the lysate required.\nPreparation of energy solution\n\tNOTE: This energy solution is based on the Sun et al. paper13 (14x stock concentration). Table 3 recapitulates the components needed for the preparation of the energy solution stock, with catalog numbers for all the chemicals used in this protocol.\n\t\nPrepare the stock solutions according to Table 3 and keep them on ice.",
    "Calibrate the pH as requested for the indicated components, either with Tris buffer 2 M (60.57 g of Tris base in a 250 mL volume of sterile water) or KOH 15% (15 g of KOH in a 100 mL volume of sterile water) as indicated in Table 3.\nIn a 15 mL tube, add the volume of each component in the order indicated in Table 3.\nAliquot the energy solution, 150 µL per tube.\nFlash freeze aliquots on dry ice and store at -80 °C.\nPreparation of amino acid (AA) solution\n\tNOTE: Amino acid solution is prepared by the RTS Amino Acid Sampler kit. Each of the 20 amino acids is provided in this kit as a 1.5 mL volume at 168 mM, except for leucine which is at 140 mM. Here, the prepared stock solution is 4x concentrated, rather than the working solution required. The final concentration of the amino acid solution is 6 mM for all amino acids, except leucine which is at 5 mM.\n\t\nThaw the 20 amino acid tubes by vortexing and incubate at 37 °C until they are completely dissolved.\n\t\tNOTE: Cys may not dissolve fully.\nIn a 50 mL tube, add 12 mL of sterile water and 1.5 mL each of the amino acids in the order indicated in Table 4.\nVortex until the solution is fairly clear, incubating at 37 °C if necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: Cys may not dissolve fully.\nAliquot 500 µL of the amino acid solution per tube on ice.\nFlash-freeze the aliquots on dry ice and store at -80 °C.\nPreparation of solutions for buffer calibration",
    "Prepare the stock solution for Mg-glu (100 mM) and K-glu (3 M) as indicated in Table 5. Make a serial dilution (in 1 mL volume) from these stocks for Mg-glu (0 to 20 mM) and K-glu (20 to 300 mM) as indicated in Supplementary File 1 for calibration steps.\n\t\tNOTE: These stock concentrations are for the calibration step and may need to be changed when setting up the final experiment. The highest concentrations of the stocks tested for this protocol are 1 M and 4.5 M for Mg-glu and K-glu, respectively.\nPreparation of PEG8000 solution stock\n\t\nPrepare 50 mL of 40% PEG8000 solution (20 g of PEG8000 in a 50 mL volume of sterile water).\n2. Cell culture and lysate preparation (4 day experiment)\nDay 1\n\t\nStreak strain BL21 Rosetta2 ΔrecBCD (Table 6) from -80 °C glycerol stock onto a 2xYT+P agar plate that contains 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol. Alternatively, BL21 Rosetta2 ΔrecB (Table 6) may also be used10.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C.\nDay 2\n\t\nInoculate a single colony from the above agar plate into 10 mL of 2xYT+P supplemented with 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking.\nDay 3\n\t\nMake a subculture by diluting the overnight culture 100 times into 4 L of fresh 2xYT+P media containing 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, 40 mL of the overnight culture is added into 3960 mL of fresh media. After dilution, the 4 L media is divided into 4 flasks (5 L volume) such that each flask contains 1 L.\nIncubate at 37 °C, 200 rpm for about 3 to 4 h of growth to reach an OD600 of 1.5-2.0. Dilute the culture by 4x if measuring OD600 > 0.8.",
    "NOTE: The exact incubation time may vary according to the strain, initial inoculum, labware, and the instruments used. The ΔrecB/ΔrecBCD knockout strains have growth rates comparable to the BL21 Rosetta2 parental (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPut the culture on ice.\nSpin down the cells at 5,000 x g for 12 min at 4 °C, and then discard the supernatant by decanting.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 800 mL of chilled S30A+DTT.\n\t\t​NOTE: The volume of S30A+DTT is 5x less than the original cell culture volume. For example, for a starting volume of 1 L of the cell culture, resuspend cell pellets in 200 mL of S30A+DTT. It is also recommended to carry out this step in a cold room at 4 °C, as well keeping all materials on ice.\nSpin down the cells at 5,000 x g for 12 min at 4 °C, and then discard the supernatant by decanting.\nRepeat steps 2.3.5 and 2.3.6.\nResuspend cell pellets in 160 mL of chilled S30A+DTT.\n\t\tNOTE: This time the volume of S30A+DTT is 25x less than the original cell culture volume. For example, for a starting volume of 1 L of the cell culture, resuspend cell pellets in 40 mL of S30A+DTT. Again, it is recommended to carry out this step in a cold room at 4 °C, as well to keep the materials on ice.\nTransfer the cells to chilled and pre-weighed 50 mL tubes.\nSpin down the cells at 2,000 x g for 8 min at 4 °C, and then discard the supernatant by decanting.\nSpin down the cells at 2,000 x g for 4 min at 4 °C, and then remove the remaining supernatant carefully by using a pipette.\nRe-measure the weight of the tube to calculate the weight of the cell pellet.",
    "Keep the cell pellets at -80 °C.\nDay 4\n\t\nTake the cell pellets from -80 °C and thaw them on ice for 1-2 h.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 0.9 mL of S30A+DTT buffer per gram of the pellets' weight. Pipette slowly to resuspend the cells, avoiding top froth as much as possible, if any.\nPlace 1 mL aliquots of the resuspended cells into 1.5 mL microtubes, and keep them on ice or a pre-chilled cold block at 4 °C (it is preferable to use metal blocks). \n\t\tNOTE: If the last aliquot is much less than 1 mL, it is better to discard it than to sonicate a sub-optimal volume. The optimal volume (1 mL) for sonication was determined for this setup (tube, sonicator, and probe), and may vary for a different one.\nSonicate each tube in a sonicator (3 mm probe, frequency 20 kHz), with a setup of 20% amplitude for three cycles (30 s sonication, 1 min pause).\n\t\tNOTE: The total energy delivered over the three cycles was ~266 Joules (~80-110 Joules per cycle). During this step, keep the tubes on the cold block that is surrounded by ice. Alternate between two cold blocks to avoid overheating of the probe (the standby cold block is also kept cold on ice). Both the cold blocks were pre-chilled in the fridge the day before the sonication.\nSpin down the lysate at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant (cell lysate) with a pipette and transfer to a 50 mL tube.\nIncubate the cell lysate at 37 °C at 200 rpm agitation for 80 min.\nSpin down the lysate at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "Collect the supernatant and aliquot 30 µL each in pre-chilled 1.5 mL microtubes, while keeping all tubes on ice.\nFlash-freeze the lysate aliquots on dry ice and store at -80 °C.\n3. Cell-free buffer calibration for linear DNA\nNOTE: Cell-free buffer was calibrated for optimal Mg-glu and K-glu concentrations as described in Sun et al.13. Supplementary File 1 is needed for the calibration steps. Reactions were set to a final volume of 10.5 µL each. Extracts were calibrated using 1 nM of linear (see section 4 below) or plasmid DNA. The experiments can be performed on the same day the buffers are prepared, or the prepared buffers can be frozen at -80 °C to perform the experiment on another day. For all calibration steps, each component was thawed on ice before mixing and pipetting into a 384-well plate.\nPrepare a Master Mix, according to the 'Buffer Preparation' tab in the Excel file Supplementary File 1, containing: (a) cell extract (33% of the total reaction volume), (b) reporter DNA (as linear and/or plasmid DNA) to a final concentration of 1 nM, (c) cell-free buffer (PEG8000, AA solution, and energy solution), and (d) K-glu to a final concentration of 80 mM.\nFor a reaction volume of 10.5 µL, take 1.05 µL (10% total reaction) of different concentrations of Mg-glu 10x concentrated stocks (final concentration ranges: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 20 mM) and add 9.45 µL (90% total reaction) of the Master Mix. Mix gently.\n\tNOTE: Use PCR eight-strip tubes to prepare the dilutions and mix with a multichannel pipette. If needed, a different range of Mg-glu concentrations may be used.",
    "Pipette 10 µL of the above reactions into a 384-well square-bottom microplate, cover it using an adhesive plate seal, and measure gene expression as fluorescence output. Record fluorescence data with a plate reader (Ex: 485 nm; Em: 528 nm) at regular intervals (e.g., 5 min) for 8 h of incubation at 30 °C with continuous orbital shaking at 307 cpm.\n\tNOTE: If needed, spin down the 384-well microplate (<2,500 x g, 1 min, room temperature) before starting data acquisition. End-point measurements were used to compare GFP expression in the different buffer compositions. The fluorescence values can be converted to standardized units for plotting (see below).\nIdentify the Mg-glu concentration that results in the highest fluorescence value at the end-point.\n\tNOTE: If unsure about the optimal Mg-glu concentration obtained, repeat step 3.2 with more diverse concentration ranges.\nWith the optimized Mg-glu concentration, proceed to K-glu calibration for a range of concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 mM), using the same volumes indicated in step 3.2. Run the experiment and identify the highest fluorescence value from among the K-glu concentrations tested. This indicates the optimal buffer composition for Mg-glu and K-glu for this lysate.\n\tNOTE: If unsure about the optimal K-glu concentration obtained, repeat the step with more diverse concentration ranges.\nOnce the Mg-glu and K-glu values are established, prepare stock tubes of the optimized buffer composition according to the batch volume obtained. Use the 'Buffer Preparation' tab in Supplementary File 1 to calculate the number of buffer tubes needed, aliquot 38 µL per tube, and store at -80 °C.\n4. Linear DNA preparation",
    "NOTE: For lysate calibration, plasmid P70a-deGFP is used. This plasmid was maintained in E. coli KL740 cl857+ (Table 6) for miniprep using the Plasmid Miniprep Kit, or maxiprep using the Plasmid Maxiprep Kit. Linear DNA fragments used as expression templates in the cell-free reactions were PCR amplified using the primers and templates listed in Table 7 and Table 8.\nPCR amplify from plasmid P70a-deGFP using DNA polymerase with oligo primers listed in Table 7. Set up the PCR reactions in a 50 µL volume, according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the thermocycler program: [98 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles x (98 °C for 30 s → 66 °C for 30 s → 72 °C for 60 s); 72 °C for 10 min; 4 °C for ∞].\nDigest the template DNA in the PCR reactions by adding 1 µL of DpnI restriction enzyme per 50 µL PCR reaction and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, purify the PCR reaction using a PCR & DNA cleanup Kit and elute in nuclease-free water.\nVerify the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel (1x TAE) prior to use.\nQuantify the purified PCR products (or the plasmid preps) using Nanodrop (ND-1,000).\n\tNOTE: If using a DNA polymerase/buffer that is directly compatible with the downstream cell-free reaction, the purification step (step 2) can be skipped entirely and the concentration of unpurified DNA measured by a fluorometric assay with DNA-binding dye instead (see Batista et al.10).\n5. Experimental execution",
    "NOTE: In addition to using Supplementary File 1 to calibrate the buffer stock for each lysate batch prepared (above), it is recommended to use the ‘Reaction Preparation’ tab in the file to set up the subsequent cell-free reactions. As before, the reactions' volume is set at 10.5 µL per reaction, of which only 10 µL is finally pipetted into the 384-well plate for data acquisition. Here, 5 nM of each template is used for cell-free expression. It is important to be consistent when pipetting the reactions-use the same pipette and the type of tips. Dispense carefully to avoid any bubbles in the well or any liquid sticking to the walls of the well. If needed, spin down the plate (<2,500 x g, 1 min, room temperature).\nCalculate the volumes to pipette by inputting the sample descriptions and replicates needed per sample into the 'Reaction Preparation' tab of Supplementary File 1.\n\tNOTE: If a reaction volume other than 10.5 µL is required, that can also be inputted into Supplementary File 1. The file will calculate the number of tubes of previously optimized buffer stocks and the cell extract tubes to be thawed on ice.\nLabel a 1.5 mL microtube for the Optimal Master Mix preparation (separately for linear and plasmid DNA), add the correct volumes of the Buffer and Lysate, and mix gently.\n\tNOTE: Due to differences in optimal K-glu concentrations in their buffers, copies of the 'Reaction Preparation' tab should be made to use separately for linear and plasmid DNA.\nPipette the DNA samples first, followed by nuclease-free water, and finally the Optimal Master Mix (MM) from step 5.2. Mix the cell-free reaction gently with the pipette just before adding to the plate reader and avoid any bubbles.",
    "NOTE: Use a PCR eight-strip tube to mix the reaction volume for an additional replicate. For example, if technical triplicates are intended, prepare a mix for four reactions and leave a dead volume in the tube in order to reduce pipetting errors while adding the samples to the plate.\nSet up the reactions in the plate reader (Ex 485 nm; Em 528 nm). Kinetic runs recorded fluorescence data at regular intervals (e.g., 5 min) for 8 h of incubation at 30 °C, with continuous orbital shaking at 307 cpm.\n\tNOTE: End-point measurements were reported as the 8 h time-point. The fluorescence values collected are in arbitrary units (a.u.), but they can be converted to standardized units for plotting (see below).\n6. FITC and GFP relative quantification\nNOTE: GFP expression is exported by the plate reader in arbitrary fluorescence units (a.u.). However, it is recommended to use standardized units of measurement in order to compare fluorescence values between different settings (batches, equipment, users, and laboratories). Presented here are detailed steps to convert the fluorescence values (a.u.) to FITC-equivalent and eGFP (µM) values, using standard curves of NIST-FITC and recombinant eGFP. Store NIST-FITC stock solution at 4 °C and store recombinant eGFP at -20 °C. Ensure that the stock solution and serial dilutions are protected from light. Upon delivery, it is recommended to aliquot the recombinant eGFP into smaller volumes to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nPrepare a solution of 100 mM sodium borate, pH 9.5, and store at room temperature or at 4 °C.\nPrepare 12 dilutions (70 µL each) for the standard curve, 2x per step (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.781, 0.390, 0.195, 0.097, 0.048, and 0 µM) of NIST-traceable FITC standard from the 50 µM stock using the sodium borate solution. Prepare the dilution series in triplicate.",
    "Similar to step 6.2, prepare serial dilutions (70 µL each) from the recombinant eGFP using the sodium borate solution (1.2, 0.3, 0.075, 0.0188, 0.0047, 0.0012, 0.,0003, 0.,00007, and 0 µM). For molarity calculation, consider the full size of the protein (28 kDa) and the concentration of the purified eGFP (1 g/L). Prepare the dilution series in triplicate.\nAdd 20 µL of each dilution (nine wells each = three dilutions series x three technical replicates) into a 384-well square-bottom microplate, covered by an adhesive plate seal, and incubate in a plate reader for measurement.\n\tNOTE: Here, the settings used were Excitation: 485/20, Emission: 528/20, with gain 50. However, additional wavelength/gain combinations can also be used to calibrate for other fluorescent molecules and/or gain settings. To calculate the conversion factor, the same wavelength and gain settings are required to acquire the GFP fluorescence data from the cell-free experiments and the standard curve data.\nUse the linear signal range (here, for example, [FITC] ≤ 0.781 µM) to fit the slope [y = ax and R2] for each condition.\n\tNOTE: The range may differ for different machines and standard solutions used.\nSave the data for FITC and eGFP calibration to calculate relative measurements for the lab by following the example in Table 9. Divide the values obtained in fluorescence arbitrary units (a.u.) by the curve slope \"a\" value (y = ax) to estimate GFP production in terms of FITC or eGFP.\nSubscription Required.
