    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPBMC isolation from human healthy donor whole peripheral blood\nTiming: ∼1 h 30 min\nThe starting material for CAR T cell manufacture can vary according to the clinical protocol followed. Unsorted white blood cells (WBCs), WBCs depleted from monocytes or natural killer cells, or enriched for specific T cell subsets (e.g., CD4+, CD8+ or central memory T cells), or purified CD3+ T cells can be used (Vormittag et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nHere, we generate CAR T cells from freshly isolated healthy donor-derived PBMCs.\nAlternatives: Alternatively, it is possible to apply this protocol (from step 12) to thawed PBMCs.\nOn day 0, collect fresh human whole blood sample from an adult healthy donor in tubes containing an anti-coagulant and keep the sample overnight (16–18 h) at room temperature on a rocker.\nOn day 1, dilute the peripheral blood sample 1:2 in PBS and invert gently. For instance, if the volume of the blood is 30 mL, add 30 mL of PBS to it.\nAliquot 15 mL of Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS density gradient medium into new 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nSlowly layer the diluted peripheral blood sample (30 mL) onto the Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS medium by pipetting it down the side of the Falcon tube.\nCritical: It is important to layer the diluted blood sample on top of the Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS medium for a successful gradient separation. While adding the diluted blood sample, proceed carefully, hold the Falcon tube at an angle (45°) and avoid mixing the two components (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Gently handle the tubes.",
    "Note: If the volume of the diluted blood sample is larger than 30–35 mL, prepare multiple 50 mL Falcon tubes filled with Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS medium and the diluted blood sample. The number of 50 mL Falcon tubes varies according to the diluted blood sample volume.\nQuickly centrifuge the Falcon tubes with the diluted blood sample and the density gradient medium at 700×g for 20 min at room temperature, turning off the centrifuge brake.\nNote: With the brake off, the centrifuge takes approximately 30–40 min to complete.\nNote: Once centrifuged, gently handle the tubes to avoid the disruption of the density gradient formed.\nNote: The density gradient centrifugation separates the diluted blood sample into four phases: a bottom layer with granulocytes and erythrocytes, an intermediate layer with Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS medium, a top layer containing plasma and platelets, and a mononuclear layer at the plasma/Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS interface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCarefully aspirate and discard most of the top layer (about 2/3 of it).\nPrepare two 50 mL Falcon tubes for the PBMC isolation.\nSlowly aspirate the mononuclear layer with a Pasteur pipette and transfer it to the new 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nCritical: While harvesting the mononuclear layer, avoid aspirating the underlying Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS medium.\nTop up the 50 mL Falcon tubes containing the harvested PBMCs with PBS, invert the tubes gently, and centrifuge them at 220×g for 5 min.\nRepeat the washing step for a total of 2 washes.\nDiscard the supernatant without disturbing the PBMC pellet and resuspend it in 10 mL of TexMACSTM medium, an optimized T cell medium.\nAlternatives: Instead of using TexMACSTM medium for CAR T cell culture, it is possible to use X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) (Medvec et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).",
    "Take an aliquot of the resuspended cells and count them using a hematology automated analyser. Record the WBC and the lymphocyte counts.\nAlternatives: If the hematology automated analyser is not available, use an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer. However, extra-time will be required for the count by hemocytometer.\nProceed with the next step “activation of T cells from human PBMCs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]”.\nAlternatives: Alternatively, it is possible to freeze the isolated PBMCs for later use.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1432-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of PBMC isolation\n(A) The diluted peripheral blood (PB) should be carefully stratified on top of the Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS medium. Holding the tube at an angle (45°) can help in the process.\n(B) Pre-centrifugation sample stratification and post-centrifugation sample separation into four layers.\nActivation of T cells from human PBMCs\nTiming: ∼20 min\nIn this step at day 1, T cells are activated and expanded from PBMCs by using CTSTM (Cell Therapy Systems) DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28. The goal is to enrich the PBMC culture for T cells. Here, we adapted from CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 user guide on www.thermofisher.com[href=http://www.thermofisher.com].\nDilute the isolated PBMCs to 1 × 106 WBCs/mL with TexMACSTM medium.\nCarefully resuspend CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 by vortexing (more than 30 s).\nWash CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28.\nTake an aliquot of CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 (7.5 μL of beads per million of lymphocytes, 1:3 lymphocyte:bead ratio) and mix it to an equal volume of TexMACSTM medium in a 15 mL Falcon tube. Vortex the 15 mL Falcon tube.\nPlace the 15 mL Falcon tube on a DynaMagTM-15 Magnet for 1 min, aspirate off the supernatant.\nOnce removed the 15 mL Falcon tube from the magnet, resuspend the washed beads in 7.5 μL of TexMACSTM medium per million of lymphocytes.\nAdd the washed CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 to the isolated PBMCs.",
    "Carefully mix the PBMCs with the DynabeadsTM and plate them into a Flask at a concentration of 1 × 106 WBCs/mL. We recommend using T25 Flask for 5–15 mL of cell:bead suspension, T75 for 15–30 mL and T175 for 30–50 mL. Gently mix the Flask content for 10 min on a rocker or manually every 2 min.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: If the lymphocyte count is not known, add the CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 to the cells at a 1:1 WBC:bead ratio.\nAlternatives: CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 (with a concentration of 4 × 108 beads/mL) are a GMP-grade product and therefore expensive. Alternatively, research-grade DynabeadsTM Human T-Expander CD3/CD28 (Cat#11141D, GibcoTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing less concentrated beads (1 × 108 beads/mL) are commercially available. If using the research-grade Dynabeads, please follow the specific manufacturer’s recommendations.\nAlternatives: For better representation of CAR T cell clinical manufacturing, the PBMCs can be cultured with DynabeadsTM in MACS® GMP Cell Differentiation Bags (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s recommendation. However, this culture method is more laborious and time consuming than the flask culture.\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nLentiviral transduction of T cells\nTiming: ∼1 h\nIn this part of the protocol, T cells from human PBMCs are lentivirally transduced to express the CAR construct. Here, we describe the transduction with an anti-CD19 FMC63-based CAR construct, but this same protocol was used to generate other anti-CD19 CAR T cells (Michelozzi I.M. et al., 2020 ASH abstract).\nNote: The CAR-expressing lentiviral vector used and the lentiviral particle production are described in (Ghorashian et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nAfter 17–24 h (day 2), harvest the cell:bead mixture into two pre-labeled 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nTo improve cell recovery, wash the Flask twice with CliniMACS® PBS/EDTA buffer.",
    "Centrifuge the 50 mL Falcon tubes with the cell:bead mixture at 220×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell:bead mixture in 10 mL of TexMACSTM medium.\nCount the resuspended cells using the same instrument as day 1 for consistency. Record the WBC and lymphocyte counts.\nNote: As the addition of DynabeadsTM to the PBMCs enriches the cell culture for T cells at the expenses of other cell types, the WBC number at day 2 may be similar to or lower than the one measured the day before.\nNote: The transduction of 2.5 × 106 beads-activated T cells is sufficient for a 4-condition experiment. Moreover, we recommend including a non-CAR control in the experiment (e.g., T cells transduced with an empty or scrambled vector, or untransduced T cells) undergoing the same experimental conditions as the CAR-transduced cells.\nResuspend the cell:bead mixture in TexMACSTM medium at a concentration of 1 × 106 WBCs/mL.\nAliquot 500 μL of cell:bead mixture per well into a 24-well plate.\nAlternatives: If CAR T cells are generated by gamma-retrovirus transduction, it is recommended to use RetroNectin®-coated non-treated plates (CytoOne®, Starlab). The coating of the plate is performed following the manufacturer’s instruction (Takara Bio Inc.).\nAdd the lentiviral supernatant to the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOIs) between 1–10 (Ghorashian et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nMix well.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nOptional: 24 h post-transduction (day 3), top up with TexMACSTM medium each well containing transduced beads-activated T- cells to augment T cell expansion. Alternatively, spin down the plate at 220×g for 5 min, aspirate no more than half of the supernatant without perturbing the cells, and add fresh TexMACSTM medium into each well.",
    "Note: The transduction occurs within 16 h. Beads-activated CAR T cells are incubated for longer, until day 6, to allow their expansion.\nDaily check the cell culture to assess expansion, activation and transduction level.\nCAR T cells tend to form clusters when activated, a hallmark of T cell activation, and express mCherry, a fluorescent protein encoded by the reporter gene present in the lentiviral vector construct used by us to transduce T cells. mCherry expression is a proxy for CAR expression (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1432-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. CAR T cell culture at day 8 before antigen stimulation\n(A) Activated CAR T cells tend to form clusters in culture.\n(B) mCherry fluorescent signal under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Magnification 10×. Scale bars in mm.\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nDynabead removal from CAR T cell culture\nTiming: ∼1 h\nIn this section of the protocol, CTSTM DynabeadsTM CD3/CD28 are magnetically removed from the cell culture (day 6).\nHarvest the cell:bead mixture in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nTo improve cell recovery, wash the wells with PBS.\nTop up the 50 mL Falcon tube with PBS.\nCentrifuge the 50 mL Falcon tube at 220×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 13 mL of TexMACSTM medium.\nMove the cells into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nRemove the DynabeadsTM from the cell culture.\nPlace the 15 mL Falcon tube on DynaMagTM-15 Magnet for 1 min.\nCarefully aspirate the cell content without perturbing the beads and transfer it into a new 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter and record their concentration and viability.\nSeed the cells in TexMACSTM medium at a concentration of 1 × 106/mL.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Optional: Leave the cells resting for 1 day after bead-removal, before antigen-stimulation, to maximize the CAR-dependent- and minimize the DynabeadsTM-driven intracellular signaling response detected by mass cytometry.\nAlternatives: At this stage of the protocol, CAR T cells can be live-frozen for later use.\nStimulation of CAR T cells with irradiated antigen-positive target-cells\nTiming: ∼1 h\nTwo days later (day 8), CAR T cells are co-cultured with irradiated antigen-positive target-cells (NALM6 cells) to test their functionality. Target-cells are irradiated to impede their overgrowth in culture.\nCount the NALM6 and the CAR T cells and resuspend each of them to a concentration of 1 million/mL in TexMACSTM medium.\nIrradiate NALM6 cells (40 Gy) with 137 Cesium radioactive source.\nNote: Irradiator performance can vary. The timing required for irradiation has to be specifically calculated based on the properties of the irradiator available.\nAlternatives: Instead of irradiating the target cells, it is possible to treat them with Mitomycin C before co-culture (MacLeod et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nAliquot CAR T cells in 96-, 24- or 12-well plates according to the number of cells and add NALM6 in 1:1 ratio (in the stimulated condition).\nAliquot CAR T cells in 96-, 24- or 12- plates according to the number of cells and add an equal volume of TexMACSTM medium (in the unstimulated condition).\nNote: We recommend to aliquot 100 μL, 500 μL, and 1 mL of CAR T cells per well in a 96-, 24-, and 12-well plate, respectively.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nProceed with the sample preparation for mass cytometry analysis (see below from step 47).\nNote: In order to proceed to the mass cytometry phenotyping, the stimulation of at least 0.2–0.5 × 106 CAR T cells in this step is recommended.",
    "Note: Here, we analyze the cells by mass cytometry 24 h post antigen-stimulation. However, the stimulation period may vary according to the user’s needs, from few minutes (to assess biochemical changes, as reported in (Fisher et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])) to days (to assess late effector functions e.g., proliferation, exhaustion and killing potential). If specifically interested in CAR T cell exhaustion, repeated antigen stimulation rounds (antigen stress test) may be a further option (Kiesgen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: If using cell lines genetically engineered to express the target antigen, add the wild-type cell line in the unstimulated condition, to account for non-antigen driven effects of the co-culture.\nBrefeldin A treatment, IdU staining and fixation of samples\nTiming: ∼5 h\nAt day 9, unstimulated and stimulated samples are treated with Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein transport, to avoid the release of cytokines into the media, improving their intracellular detection. Subsequently, samples are stained with Cell-IDTM 127 IdU, a thymidine analogue incorporated into the DNA during S-phase of the cell cycle, to specifically identify proliferating cells. Its signal is detected in the 127I channel of CyTOF® mass cytometer.\nFinally, samples are fixed to preserve their biochemical and molecular state.\nNote: If the readers are not performing cytokine or proliferation analyses, proceed directly to cell fixation (from step 49).\nNote: Equilibrate at room temperature Brefeldin A Solution and Cell-IDTM 127 IdU reagents before their use. The reagent dilutions and the timing of incubations are defined according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/products/brefeldin-a-solution-1-000x-1499?GroupID=BLG2181[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/products/brefeldin-a-solution-1-000x-1499?GroupID=BLG2181] and https://fluidigm.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#700000009DAw/a/4u0000019iFX/uPaSg89NU8Nh7ZHqE0rwjNPwEr13MZLbRGhyS0aA0mc[href=https://fluidigm.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/]).\nAdd Brefeldin A Solution to a final concentration of 1× (1:1,000 dilution) to unstimulated and stimulated samples. Mix gently by pipetting and incubate for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "After 3 h 30 min, dilute Cell-IDTM 127 IdU 1:1,000 in unstimulated and stimulated samples (final concentration of 50 μM). Mix gently by pipetting and incubate for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nDuring the incubation, prepare fresh 1.6% formaldehyde (FA) by diluting 16% FA in PBS (1:10 dilution). For example, dilute 5 mL of 16% FA in 45 mL of PBS. For four experimental conditions, as in this case, prepare 5 mL of 1.6% FA.\nOptional: Filter the stock FA before diluting it.\nAt the end of the incubation, harvest the cells into pre-labeled individual 15 mL Falcon tubes for each experimental condition (4 tubes).\nWash each well with 200 μL of Maxpar® PBS to collect any residual cell.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL Falcon tubes at 220×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nNote: The fixation section of this protocol (steps 49, 53–60) is adapted from “Fix Cells” section of the protocol “Maxpar Cell Surface Staining with Fresh Fix” on https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/marketing/maxpar-cell-surface-staining-400276-pr/maxpar-cell-surface-staining-400276-pr/fluidigm%3Afile[href=https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/marketing/maxpar-cell-surface-staining-400276-pr/maxpar-cell-surface-staining-400276-pr/fluidigm%3Afile].\nDifferently from Fluidigm’s protocol, we fix cells before cell surface staining procedure to preserve the samples, block all biochemical processes and to prepare the samples for the “cell barcoding[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]” step. We also reduce the incubation timing (7 instead of 10 min) for a less harsh fixation and we increase the centrifuge speed (1,200 instead of 800×g) to augment cell recovery. Moreover, we wash away the fixative after incubation.\nNote: The following volumes are recommended for 1–3 million cells. If staining a larger number of cells, scale up these volumes.\nNote: The panel of antibodies provided in the protocol works well with fixed epitopes. If using a different panel of antibodies sensitive to fixation refer to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].",
    "Aspirate off the supernatant, and aliquot 1 mL of the freshly prepared 1.6% FA into each 15 mL Falcon tube.\nGently mix by vortexing.\nIncubate for 7 min at room temperature.\nWash with 2 mL of Maxpar® Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) and centrifuge at 1,200×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nNote: After fixation, samples are centrifuged at higher speed (1,200×g for 5 min) to increase cell recovery.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently pipette or vortex to resuspend the cells in the residual volume.\nRepeat the wash (step 56) (2 washes in total).\nAfter the second wash, aspirate the supernatant and do not resuspend the cell pellet to preserve cell integrity. Leave the pelleted cells in the residual Maxpar® CSB volume (approximately 200 uL).\nStore the cell pellets in 15 mL Falcon tubes at 4°C.\nPause point: Cells can be stored in FA at 4°C for up to one week (7–10 days).\nNote: Longer term-storage in FA can increase conformational changes in surface antigens.\nViability staining with Cell-IDTM cisplatin\nTiming: ∼30 min\nIn this part of the protocol, unstimulated and stimulated fixed samples are stained with cisplatin (Cell-IDTM Cisplatin), an agent that preferentially penetrates dead cells with damaged membrane. Its signal, detected in the 195/194Pt channel of CyTOF® mass cytometer, allows distinguishing between live (cisplatin low) and dead (cisplatin high) cells.\nHere, we adapted the section of the protocol from Fluidigm’s “Cell-IDTM Cisplatin” product information sheet https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/cell-id-cisplatin-prd018/cell-id-cisplatin-prd018/fluidigm%3Afile[href=https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/cell-id-cisplatin-prd018/cell-id-cisplatin-prd018/fluidigm%3Afile].",
    "Differently from Fluidigm’s protocol, for 0.2 × 105–1 × 106 cells, we use cisplatin at a 10-fold lower concentration (0.5 instead of 5 μM), and we reduce the timing of its incubation (1 instead of 5 min) to resolve the differences between fixed live and fixed dead cells. Centrifugation is performed at higher speed due to the cells being fixed. Moreover, we wash cells in Maxpar® PBS rather than Maxpar® CSB to proceed with the next step of cell barcoding.\nNote: Equilibrate at room temperature Cell-IDTM Cisplatin immediately before use.\nResuspend the samples in the residual volume left and count them.\nNote: Do not use viability dye (e.g., Trypan Blue) while counting as cells are fixed.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,200×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 500 μL of Maxpar® PBS.\nDilute Cell-IDTM Cisplatin 1:5,000 in Maxpar® PBS (1 μM cisplatin).\nAliquot 500 μL of 1 μM cisplatin into 500 μL of cells (cisplatin final concentration of 0.5 μM) and resuspend carefully.\nIncubate for 1 min on a rocker at room temperature.\nQuench the cisplatin by adding 5 mL of Maxpar® CSB to each 15 mL Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 1,200×g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and gently vortex to resuspend the cell pellet.\nAdd 4 mL of Maxpar® PBS to wash cells and centrifuge at 1,200×g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently vortex to resuspend the cell pellet.\nContinue with the next step “cell barcoding[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]”.\nCritical: Cisplatin is a mutagen and a carcinogen. It is toxic if swallowed, inhaled or if in contact with skin. Handle cisplatin using personal protective equipment.\nCell barcoding\nTiming: ∼1 h 20 min",
    "In this step, the different experimental conditions derived from one donor are uniquely barcoded using Cell-IDTM 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit. This kit contains 20 different barcodes, each of them characterized by the exclusive combination of 3 Palladium (Pd) isotopes (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Here, we use 4 barcodes to label each donor’s experimental conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1432_2.csv\nHere, we adapted the protocol from Fluidigm’s “Cell-IDTM 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit” user guide https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/cell-id-20-plex-pd-barcoding-kit-ug-prd023/cell-id-20-plex-pd-barcoding-kit-ug-prd023/fluidigm%3Afile[href=https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/cell-id-20-plex-pd-barcoding-kit-ug-prd023/cell-id-20-plex-pd-barcoding-kit-ug-prd023/fluidigm%3Afile].\nNote: The following volumes are recommended for 1–3 million cells.

    "In this part of the protocol, the multiplexed sample is fixed to ensure that antibodies are firmly attached onto the cells and to allow the subsequent staining with iridium (Cell-IDTM Intercalator-Ir), a nucleic acid intercalator that labels nucleated cells. The intensity of its signal, detected in the 191/193Ir channel of CyTOF, allows to distinguish singlets (with lower DNA content) from doublets/aggregates (with higher DNA content). The following part of the protocol is adapted from “Fix Cells” and “Stain Cells with Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir” sections from “Maxpar Phosphoprotein Staining with Fresh Fix” protocol on https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/maxpar-phosphoprotein-staining-with-fresh-fix/maxpar-phosphoprotein-staining-with-fresh-fix/fluidigm%3Afile[href=https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/maxpar-phosphoprotein-staining-with-fresh-fix/maxpar-phosphoprotein-staining-with-fresh-fix/fluidigm%3Afile]\nNote: The following volumes are recommended for the staining of 1–3 million cells.

    "However, as intercalation is a slow process, short incubation with the intercalator solution can affect the quality of the iridium staining resulting in less tight iridium signals (DNA peaks).\nThe following day, proceed with the “Sample acquisition” step.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at 4°C in intercalator solution for 48 h until their acquisition. For longer storage, after step 127 perform an additional wash with 200 μL of Maxpar® CSB and store pelleted cells at 4°C.\nNote: If staining more multiplexed samples, prepare the intercalator solution separately for each sample.\nSample acquisition\nTiming: ∼ 1h (sample preparation and acquisition)\nIn this part of the protocol, the multiplexed sample is prepared for acquisition at an HeliosTM (WB Injector) mass cytometer equipped with the Super Sampler unit.

    "Filter the sample into a polypropylene FACS tube using a 35 μm cell strainer cap and vortex it immediately before acquisition.\nAcquire the sample for 10,000 s at a flow rate of < 600 events/s. The acquisition takes 45 min for a sample with less than 1 × 106 cells (0.6–0.95 × 106 cells).\nNote: The acquisition will take longer if acquiring a sample with larger number of cells.\nNote: See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nNote: If analyzing more multiplexed samples on the same day, process and acquire one multiplexed sample at a time.
