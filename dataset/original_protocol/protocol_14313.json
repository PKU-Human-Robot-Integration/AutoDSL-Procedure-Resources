    "All methods described here use tissue samples derived from dead animals and fully comply with the German legal regulations of animal welfare.\n1. Volumetry\nSubmersion Technique for Determination of Tissue/Organ Densities (Figure 1 and Figure 2)7,12,16\nPrepare materials: Scalpel blades, paper towels, fine forceps, standard laboratory scales, glass or plastic beakers, 0.9% saline, and self-constructed specimen holders (Figure 2A).\nExcise a piece of tissue (maximum size: 2 x 2 x 2 cm3) from the organ/tissue, specifically from the organ compartment of interest. Small organs, such as the pituitary, or the pineal gland, are measured in toto.\n\t\tCAUTION: Ensure that the size of the sample is notably smaller than the inner diameter of the beaker (step 1.1.5 et seq.), and its filling level to allow complete submersion of the sample without contacting the inner walls of the beaker in step 1.1.7.\nCarefully swab the sample with a paper towel to remove excess blood/tissue fluid.\nWeigh the sample on a precision scale and record the weight of the sample (mS). Determine the weight of small tissue samples to the nearest mg (Figure 1A).\nPlace a beaker filled with room-temperature 0.9% saline on the scale. Do not completely fill the beaker, to allow for a submersion of the tissue sample in the subsequent step without overflowing.\n\t\tCAUTION: Use a beaker size appropriate to the size and weight of the tissue sample(s) to be measured and the effective measurement range of the scale. For larger samples up to 2 x 2 x 2 cm3, a beaker size of 50–100 mL is appropriate in combination with a scale measuring from approximately 100 mg to 500 g, whereas for small samples, use beakers of 5–10 mL volume in combination with precision scales with measuring ranges between approximately 0.1 mg and 20 g.",
    "Submerge the sample holder (i.e., a sufficiently rigid loop of thin wire or something similar, Figure 2A) in the saline to a marked position (arrows in Figure 1B, Figure 2B, and Figure 2C). Then, reset (tare) the display of the scale to zero.\nCarefully attach the tissue sample to the sample holder and completely submerge the sample in the saline until the marked position on the sample holder is reached (arrows in Figure 1B, Figure 2B, and Figure 2C).\n\t\tCAUTION: The submerged sample and the sample holder must not have contact with the inner walls or the bottom of the beaker or the surface of the saline.\nWhile holding the sample holder and the submerged sample in that position, record the weight displayed on the scale (mL), referring to the weight of saline displaced by the tissue sample (Figure 1C, Figure 2B, and Figure 2C).\nCalculate the volume of the sample (VS) from mL, and the density of saline at room temperature (20 °C) (ρsaline = 1.0048 g/cm³) as VS = mL/ρsaline [g/g/cm³] (Figure 1).\nCalculate the density of the tissue sample (ρsample) from the weight (i.e., mass) of the sample (mS) and its volume (VS): ρsample = mS/VS [g/cm³] (Figure 1).\nFor organs measured in toto, repeat the measurement three times and calculate the average organ density from the single measurement values. For large organs/tissues, perform repeated measurements with different samples of the same organ/tissue/organ compartment, and calculate the average density from the single measurements, accordingly.\nCalculate the total volume of the organ/tissue/organ compartment from its weight and density (Figure 1).\nApplication of the Cavalieri-Method for Determination of Porcine Organ Volumes7\nPrepare materials: Ruler, caliper, knife, scissors, forceps, waterproof pen, plastic transparencies, scanner, photo camera, and cross grids printed on plastic transparencies.",
    "Place the entire organ/tissue on a plain surface (cutting base) and measure the length (l) of the organ along its longitudinal axis (Figure 3B, Figure 5A).\nCut the complete organ/tissue into equidistant parallel slices orthogonal to the longitudinal organ axis (Figure 3C, Figure 5B). Choose a distance d between two sections (i.e., the sectioning interval/section thickness, usually approximately 1 cm) sufficiently small to receive a sufficient number of tissue/organ slabs. Randomly position the first section within a distance between 0 and the sectioning interval from the margin of the organ. While slicing, visually judge the position and orientation of each section plane, to obtain approximately parallel organ/tissue slabs of roughly uniform thickness.\n\t\tNOTE: The necessary number of tissue/organ slabs depends on the shape and the size of the examined organ/tissue. If small organs or samples have to be sectioned in thin slabs of ≤5 mm, embed the samples in agar prior to sectioning (see step 1.3.3.) and use a technical device for slicing of the agar-embedded sample. Empirically recommendable sectioning intervals for most porcine organs and tissues, as well as examples for slicing devices, are indicated in the Supplementary Material of \"Tissue Sampling Guides for Porcine Biomedical Models\"7.\nPlace all organ/tissue slabs on the same surface facing down on the cutting base (i.e., consistently on either the right or the left section plane of each organ slab, Figure 3D, Figure 5C) and count the slabs (n).\nObtain section profiles of the tissue slabs by one of the following approaches:\n\t\t\nCarefully place the tissue slabs on appropriately labeled plastic transparencies, while maintaining the orientation of their upper and lower section surfaces. Trace the outlines of the tissue slabs on the plastic transparencies using a waterproof pen (Figure 3E1-2).",
    "Take photographic images of the tissue slabs, holding the camera vertically above the section surfaces (Figure 3F). For calibration, place a size ruler next to the tissue slabs.\nScan the tissue slabs on a flatbed scanner while maintaining the orientation of their upper and lower section surfaces (Figure 3G). For calibration, place a size ruler next to the tissue slabs.\nMeasure the areas of the (traced, photographed, or scanned) section profiles of all tissue slabs by one of the following approaches:\n\t\t\nOverlay or superimpose the traced organ slab profiles with an appropriately sized, calibrated grid of equally spaced crosses printed on a plastic transparency and count all crosses hitting the profile area (Figure 3E3-4; compare to Figure 5D). Calculate the section profile area of each organ slab by multiplying the number of crosses hitting the profile area by the area corresponding to one cross.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To receive sufficiently precise volume estimates, choose a cross grid with a sufficiently small distance between adjacent crosses, so that an average of at least 100 crosses will hit the section surfaces of the slabs of one organ in each examined case of the study. Empirically recommendable cross grid sizes for most porcine organs and tissues are indicated in the Supplementary Material of \"Tissue Sampling Guides for Porcine Biomedical Models\"7.\nMeasure the areas of the tissue slabs in the digital images of the photos/scans using appropriate commercially available or freeware morphometry soft- and hardware applications (Figure 3H), such as a commercial image analysis system21, or ImageJ22.",
    "CAUTION: Note that one tissue slab (either the first or the last) is placed on the scanner resting on its natural surface, respectively, faces the camera with its natural surface. Therefore, the scanned image, the photo image of this slab, will not show a section surface. Therefore, no section area profile is measured in the scanned image/photo image of this tissue slab (Figure 3I). Also note over-projection present in scanned images and photographs of organ/tissue slabs, i.e., only measure the areas of the actual section profiles, but not of the tissue in the image lying behind the slab section surface (Figure 12G-H).\nCalculate the estimated organ volume as the product of the sum of all corresponding section profile areas of all tissue slabs per case (i.e., consistently of either the right or the left, respectively, the upper or lower section surface of each organ slab and the mean thickness of the slabs (i.e., the quotient of the measured length of the vertical organ axis (l) and the number of slabs)15.\nDetermination of the Extent of Three-Dimensional Embedding-Related Tissue Shrinkage during Processing of Tissue Samples for Histology\nPrepare materials: Microtome blades, forceps, agar, metal casting molds, digital scanner, and size ruler (e.g., graph paper).\nCut a fresh, plane section surface from a fixed tissue sample.\n\t\tNOTE: If using samples of easily deformable (soft) tissues (fat tissue, gelatinous tissues), embed the fixed tissue sample in agar prior to sectioning (Figure 4A).\nTo embed sample in agar:\n\t\t\nMix standard agar powder as used for microbiology culture medium with an appropriate volume of water (approximately 0.5–1 g agar/10 mL water) in a glass beaker. Stir the mixture and heat it in a microwave oven at 700 W until boiling for 3–5 s. Stir the mixture and bring to a boil again for 3–5 s.",
    "Optionally, to increase the contrast of the agar to the tissue sample, dye the liquid agar, e.g., with black ink (add 1 mL ink to 10 mL of hot liquid agar and stir vigorously).\nPour the hot agar into a casting mold (e.g., a metal mold used for paraffin embedding, Figure 10A-D) and submerge the fixed tissue sample in the warm agar. Let the agar cool until solidification, remove the mold, and cut the agar block with the embedded tissue using a microtome or razor blade.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: While handling hot liquid agar, wear protective goggles and gloves. Process tissue samples fixed in formaldehyde solution under an exhaust hood and wear protective goggles and laboratory gloves.\nPlace the sample with its section surface facing down on a flatbed scanner, together with a size ruler and scan the section surface (Figure 4A,B).\nDetermine the area of the section surface of the fixed tissue sample (Af) in the digital scan, using one of the techniques described in step 1.2.6 (Figure 4B).\nEmbed the sample in plastic embedding medium, such as epoxy (e.g., Epon) or glycolmethacrylate/methylmethacrylate (GMA/MMA)23, following standard protocols23,24,25 (Figure 4C). Ensure that the section surface of the fixed sample scanned in the previous step (1.3.4) is maintained in the plastic-embedded sample.\n\t\tNOTE: To maintain the orientation of the section surface of the sample during processing of the sample, consistently place the sample with its intended section surface facing downwards into the embedding cassette or the casting mold, or mark the intended section surface (or the opposite side of the sample) with ink.",
    "Cut a histological section from the plastic block corresponding to the original section surface of the fixed tissue sample (step 1.3.2) using a microtome (Figure 4D), mount the section on a glass slide (Figure 4D) and stain it routinely (e.g., Hematoxylin and eosin stain, H&E)24,25.\n\t\tCAUTION: To receive a histological section approximately in the same plane as the original section surface of the fixed tissue sample, carefully adjust the position of the plastic block in the mount of the microtome before sectioning.\nPlace the slide with the stained section facing downwards on a flatbed scanner together with a size ruler and scan the section (Figure 4E).\nDetermine the area of the section of the plastic-embedded tissue sample (Ae) in the digital scan, using one of the techniques described in step 1.2.6 (Figure 4F).\nCalculate the average embedding-related tissue shrinkage (for the respective tissue and embedding medium) from the measured areas of corresponding section profiles of tissue samples before and after embedding in plastic embedding medium. The linear shrinkage factor fs is calculated as the square root of the quotient of the areas of the section profiles of n tissue samples after embedding in plastic embedding medium (Ae) and the areas of the corresponding section profiles of the same tissue samples before embedding in plastic embedding medium (Af) (Figure 4G)14.\n2. Volume-weighted Systematic Random Sampling by Point Counting and Processing of Tissue Subsamples for Different Downstream Analysis-types7\nPrepare materials: Ruler, caliper, knife, scissors, forceps, waterproof pen, point/cross grids printed on plastic transparencies, and random number tables.\n\tNOTE: Copy templates for cross grids (5–60 mm) are provided in the Supplementary Material of \"Tissue Sampling Guides for Porcine Biomedical Models\"7.",
    "Place the organ/tissue on a plain surface (cutting base) and measure the length (l) of the organ along its longitudinal axis (Figure 5A, Figure 6A).\nCut the complete organ/tissue into equidistant parallel slices orthogonal to its longitudinal axis (Figure 5B). Choose a distance d between two sections (i.e., the sectioning interval/section thickness, usually approximately 1 cm) small enough to obtain a sufficient number of tissue/organ slices. Randomly position the first section within a distance between 0 and the sectioning interval from the margin of the organ. While slicing, visually judge the position and orientation of each section plane to obtain approximately parallel organ/tissue slabs of roughly uniform thickness.\n\tNOTE: The necessary number of tissue/organ slabs depends on the size of the examined organ/tissue and the number of sampled tissue locations. If small organs or samples have to be sectioned in thin slabs of ≤5 mm, embed the samples in agar prior to sectioning (see step 1.3.3.) and use technical devices for slicing of the agar-embedded sample. Empirically recommendable sectioning intervals for most porcine organs and tissues, as well as examples for slicing devices are indicated in the Supplementary Material of \"Tissue Sampling Guides for Porcine Biomedical Models\"7.\nPlace all organ/tissue slabs on the same surface facing down on the cutting base (Figure 6B).\nOverlay the tissue slabs with an appropriately sized cross grid printed on a plastic transparency by placing the outermost left upper cross of the grid over a random point out of the tissue (Figure 5C-D, Figure 6B).",
    "NOTE: Choose a cross grid with a sufficiently small distance between adjacent crosses, so that in each examined case of the study, at least twice as many crosses will hit the section surface(s) of the tissue compartment to be sampled, as the number of samples that have to be taken from that tissue compartment. Empirically recommendable cross grid sizes for most porcine organs and tissues are indicated in the Supplementary Material of \"Tissue Sampling Guides for Porcine Biomedical Models\"7.\nMark and count all crosses hitting the tissue (respectively, the tissue sub-compartment to be sampled). Consistently apply a uniform mode of counting and numbering of the crosses hitting the tissue compartment to be sampled in all tissue slabs, e.g., by consecutive numbering of the respective crosses in each line by line, from the left to the right and from top to bottom, or, e.g., by numbering the crosses in one tissue slab after another in clockwise direction, starting with the cross closest to the twelve o'clock position, as exemplarily demonstrated in Figure 5E.\nDivide the number of crosses hitting the tissue/tissue compartment to be sampled (n) by the number of samples to be generated to obtain the systematic sampling interval (i).\nDetermine the first sampling position by choosing a random number x in the interval between 1 and i. For this, use a random-number table. Mark the first sampling position (x) and every next x + i, x + 2i, x + 3i, etc., cross hitting the tissue/tissue compartment to be sampled on the plastic transparency using a waterproof pen (Figure 5F).\n\tNOTE: Random number tables can be conveniently and quickly generated using an online random number generator.",
    "Tag the tissue locations corresponding to the marked crosses by slightly raising the plastic transparency and placing a small piece of clean, blank confetti paper on the surface of the tissue slab using a pair of tweezers (Figure 5G, Figure 6E).\nExcise specimen of tissue from the sampled locations (Figure 5H, Figure 6F, Figure 7A) and further subdivide them for different types of subsequent analyses (Figure 6G, Figure 7A-B), as specified in Table 1.\nAfter sampling, clean the plastic transparencies with warm water and soap, dry, and reuse them.\n3. Generation of Isotropic Uniform Random (IUR) Sections and Vertical Uniform Random (VUR) Sections for Quantitative Stereological Analyses\n\"Isector\" Technique\nPrepare materials: Razor or microtome blades, agar, spherical casting molds (e.g., casting molds for pralines, which can be obtained from confectioner suppliers), foldback clamps, and forceps.\nPlace an adequately sized piece (1 x 1 x 1 cm3) of fixed, systematically randomly sampled tissue in a spherical casting mold, hold together by foldback clamps, and fill the mold with warm liquid agar (Figure 8A-E).\nRemove the agar sphere (Figure 8F) from the casting mold after solidification of the agar.\nRoll the agar sphere with the embedded tissue sample across the table, stop, and section it at a random position.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting section plane is an IUR section (Figure 8F-G).\nProceed to embed the tissue sample in plastic resin such as GMA/MMA, maintaining the orientation of the IUR section plane (see 1.3.5).\n\"Orientator\" Technique\nPrepare the materials: Razor or microtome blades, agar, forceps, random number table(s), prints of equiangular, and cosine-weighted circles.\n\t\tNOTE: Copy templates of circles are provided in previous publications8,26.\nPlace the sample of fixed tissue (or of agar-embedded fixed tissue) on a print of an equiangular circle with one edge parallel to the 0–180° direction (Figure 9A, Figure 10E).",
    "Determine a random angle by using the random number table. Find the corresponding marks at the scale of the equiangular circle, which the sample rests on. Using these marks, cut a section through the sample (or through the agar surrounding the embedded tissue sample), with the section plane being oriented parallel to the direction of the random angle indicated on the scale of the equiangular circle, and vertical to the resting surface of the sample (Figure 9B-C, Figure 10F).\nPlace the tissue block with the section surface generated in the previous step facing downside on a cosine-weighted circle with the edge of the resting surface placed parallel to the 1-1 direction (Figure 9D, Figure 10H).\nRepeat step 3.2.3 and cut a new section through the sample at a random angle determined using the random number table (Figure 9E-F, Figure 10I-J).\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting section plane is an IUR section.\nIf appropriate, determine the area of the IUR section profile of the fixed tissue sample for determination of the embedding-related tissue shrinkage (Figure 9G-J) as described in step 1.3, and proceed to embed the tissue sample in plastic resin such as GMA/MMA.\nGeneration of Vertical Uniform Random (VUR) Sections\nPrepare materials: Razor or microtome blades, agar, forceps, random number table(s), and prints of equiangular circles.\n\t\tNOTE: Copy templates of circles are provided in previous publications8,26.\nDefine a vertical axis within the fixed tissue sample that is always recognizable in the sample/sections during the subsequent steps.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, the axis vertical to the natural surface of the tissue sample is chosen as the vertical axis.\nIf appropriate, embed the sample in agar (Figure 11B).",
    "NOTE: Agar-embedding prior to VUR- or IUR-sectioning of the fixed sample is generally recommendable for small, thin, fragile, or soft samples. Also use agar-embedding of samples to facilitate the positioning of the VUR sectioned sample during the subsequent embedding of the sample in plastic resin medium.\nPlace the sample on a print of an equiangular circle, with the vertical axis being orthogonally oriented to the plane of the table/paper table (Figure 11C).\nCut the sample at a random angle (determined using a random number table) with the section plane orthogonal to the table and parallel to the vertical axis to receive a VUR section plane (Figure 11D).\nIf appropriate, determine the area of the IUR section profile of the fixed tissue sample for determination of the embedding-related tissue shrinkage as described in step 1.3 (compare to Figure 9G-J) and proceed to embed the tissue sample in plastic resin such as GMA/MMA.\nSubscription Required.
