    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTitration of primary antibodies\nTiming: 28 h\nPerform this step once before quantification to determine the saturating concentration of the monoclonal primary antibody for your antibody and cell line of choice. The saturating concentration indicates the number of antibodies needed to stain all receptors on the surface of the cells that will be analyzed.\nSeed 106 cells each on two 10 cm cell culture dishes in standard medium.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 10% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h.\nCritical: Always use a certified biosafety cabinet and sterilized equipment and solutions. Follow aseptic technique when working with cells.\nCritical: Cytokine binding might interfere with antibody binding, so it is best to quantify receptor expression at the cell surface in the absence of cytokines. When isolating primary cells, receptors might be bound by cytokines. Carefully wash cells with PBS several times before receptor quantification to remove these cytokines. Additionally, test whether binding of the primary antibody is affected by cytokine binding by comparing fluorescence intensity of stained unstimulated cells and stained cells stimulated with recombinant cytokines.\nNote: For HepG2 cells standard medium refers to DMEM/F-12 with Glutamax plus 10% FCS plus Pen/Strep. For other cell types adjust medium and supplements.\nDetach cells from cell culture dishes.\nRemove cell culture medium by vacuum aspiration and gently wash cells once with sterile PBS.\nAdd PBS/EDTA to cover the surface of the cell culture dish (e.g., 2 mL/10 cm dish).\nIncubate cells on ice until they detach from the cell culture dish.\nResuspend cells with 4 mL ice-cold FACS buffer.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a FACS tube.",
    "Note: Avoid using trypsin to detach cells from the cell surface as trypsin cleaves gp130 and other surface proteins. Instead of detaching cells with PBS/EDTA, you can also use any other protocol to detach and singularize cells until it does not cause receptor cleavage.\nNote: At this point, you should create a suspension of single cells without cell aggregates. You can easily control this with a microscope. If cells continue to form aggregates, you can use a syringe (0.9 × 40 mm needle size) to mechanically disrupt cell-cell contacts or increase the incubation time with PBS/EDTA. Keep in mind that intensive physical steering stress may reduce receptor expression.\nNote: We describe this method for adherent HepG2 cells. You need to adapt some of the steps to the cell line you are analyzing, particularly when detaching cells from tissue culture dishes. To harvest suspension cells, take them directly out of the culture flask and centrifuge them (233 g, 4°C, 5 min). Resolve the cell pellet in PBS and centrifuge again.\nWash cells.\nAdd 4 mL ice-cold FACS buffer to each FACS tube.\nVortex cells briefly.\nCentrifuge cells (233 g, 4°C, 5 min).\nRemove supernatant by vacuum aspiration.\nResuspend cells in 2 mL ice-cold FACS buffer.\nDetermine the cell number.\nResuspend 200,000 cells each in 100 μL ice-cold FACS buffer with various dilutions of the primary antibody (e.g., dilute the antibody 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500). Leave two aliquots of cells unstained as controls to account for 1) auto-fluorescence of the cells and 2) unspecific binding of the FITC-conjugate, respectively. Resuspend these control cells in 100 μL FACS buffer each.\nNote: Only the concentration of the primary antibody needs to be titrated. Saturating concentration of the FITC-conjugate is used according to the QIFIKIT manual[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/packageinsert/public/SSK0078RUO-E_03.pdf].",
    "Note: The choice of the primary antibody depends on your protein of interest. If you want to use QIFIKIT for quantification, as described here, you need a mouse monoclonal IgG primary antibody, as the calibration beads are covered with mouse monoclonal IgG.\nNote: Test the specificity of the primary antibody by staining cells with the antibody that are known to not express the receptor or where the gene coding for the receptor has been knocked out. If staining is positive in cells that do not express the receptor, it is necessary to choose another antibody clone.\nNote: Complete resuspension of the cell pellet is crucial for homogenous binding of the antibodies. However, the cells are alive during staining, so avoid strong and long vortexing at all steps performed and keep cells on ice.\nNote: If you are analyzing immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and B-cells, that express Fc receptors, include an incubation step with an Fc blocking reagent following manufacturerś description. This ensures that only antigen-specific binding is analyzed. For human cells, e.g., BD Pharmingen Human BD Fc Block (Cat# 564219) can be used.\nIncubate cell suspensions on ice for 30 min.\nWash cells twice.\nAdd 4 mL ice-cold FACS buffer to each FACS tube.\nVortex cells briefly.\nCentrifuge cells (233 g, 4°C, 5 min).\nRemove supernatant by vacuum aspiration.\nResuspend unstained control cells in 100 μL ice-cold FACS buffer.\nResuspend all other cells, including cells that serve as control for unspecific binding of the secondary antibody, in 100 μL FACS buffer with FITC-conjugate (1:50 in FACS buffer) each.\nIncubate cells on ice in the dark for 1 h.\nCritical: Protect cells stained with FITC-conjugate from light-induced destruction of the fluorophore by incubating them in the dark.\nWash cells as described in step 9.",
    "Resuspend cells in 300 μL ice-cold FACS buffer per FACS tube.\nAnalyze the fluorescence intensity of the cells using a flow cytometer.\nPerform flow cytometer start-up.\nSeparate the cell population of interest from debris and large cell aggregates based on an SSC-A against FSC-A scatter plot (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2921-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating of single cells\n(A) SSC-A and FSC-A of HepG2 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The depicted gate marks living cells outside of bigger aggregates.\n(B) FSC-H and FSC-W of living HepG2 cells from Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A. The depicted gate marks single cells. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] A) and B) are modified from Reeh et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] with permission from Springer Nature.\n(C) HepG2 cells were stained with anti-gp130 primary antibody followed by staining with FITC-conjugate. Unstained cells and cells only incubated with FITC-conjugate serve as control.\nGate single cells in an FSC-H against FSC-W scatter plot (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRecord the fluorescence intensity within the FITC channel for 10,000 single cells/sample and calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of these cells.\nDetermine the concentration of antibodies needed for saturation of the FITC signal, i.e., identify the concentration of antibodies that does not further increase the fluorescence intensity of the cells compared to the next lower antibody concentration (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: For 200,000 HepG2 cells the saturating amount of the anti-gp130 (BR3) antibody is 1:50 (20 μg/mL). This dilution strongly depends on the concentration of the antibody stock solution (here, 1 μg/μL), the number of cells analyzed, and the number of epitopes present on the cells. Thus, each cell/antibody pair requires determining the dilution of the antibody that results in saturated binding.\nFlow cytometric quantification of surface receptors\nTiming: 28 h\nSeed 106 cells /10 cm cell culture dish in standard medium.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37°C, 10% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h.\nDetach cells from cell culture dish.\nRemove cell culture medium by vacuum aspiration.\nGently wash cells once with PBS.\nAdd PBS/EDTA to cover the surface of the cell culture dish (e.g., 2 mL/10 cm dish).\nIncubate cells on ice until they detach from the cell culture dish.\nResuspend cells with 2 mL ice-cold FACS buffer.\nTransfer 200 μL each of the cell suspension to two FACS tubes on ice.\nNote: Cells in one FACS tube will be stained with anti-gp130 antibody (IgG) and FITC-conjugate, cells in the other FACS tube will be incubated with a corresponding IgG isotype control and FITC-conjugate as control for unspecific binding of the primary antibody and the FITC-conjugate. Unspecific binding results in increased fluorescence and thus overestimates receptor numbers.\nNote: Perform all steps with pre-chilled buffers (store in the refrigerator or on ice) and on ice to prevent receptor internalization.\nNote: Working sterile is not necessary after this step as the incubation periods are short and performed on ice, thus contamination of the sample is highly unlikely.\nNote: Ensure that the number of stained cells is not too high, so that you do not need too much of the primary antibody to reach saturation of staining. Ideally, use 100,000 to 200,000 cells. Since only 10,000 cells are finally analyzed by flow cytometry, fewer cells are perfectly fine. However, some cells will get lost during washing steps, and others will be out-gated when gating for single-cells. Thus, a moderate excess in cell number is beneficial.\nAdd 2 mL ice-cold FACS buffer to wash the cells.\nCentrifuge cells (233 g, 4°C, 5 min).\nRemove FACS buffer by vacuum aspiration.\nStaining of cells with primary antibodies.",
    "Resuspend one aliquot of cells in 100 μL ice-cold FACS buffer with primary antibodies at saturating concentration (anti-gp130, 1:50, final concentration 20 μg/mL).\nResuspend one aliquot of cells in 100 μL ice-cold FACS buffer with IgG isotype control (1:25, final concentration 20 μg/mL) at the same concentration.\nIncubate cells on ice for 1 h.\nNote: It is also possible to stain the cells in v-bottom 96-well dishes or 1.5 mL reaction tubes instead of FACS tubes. In this case, wash cells with 200 μL FACS buffer in the next steps.\nNote: Complete resuspension of the cell pellet is crucial for homogenous binding of the antibodies to the cells. However, the cells are alive during staining, so avoid strong and long vortexing at all steps performed and keep cells always on ice.\nStaining of cells and beads with FITC-conjugate.\nVortex Set-up beads and Calibrator beads briefly.\nTransfer 20 μL of Set-up beads and 20 μL of Calibrator beads into separate FACS tubes.\nWash Set-up beads, Calibrator beads and the cells with 3 mL FACS buffer.\nNote: Set-up beads contain two populations of beads: blank beads and beads conjugated with a high number of mouse IgG. They are used to pre-adjust the detector gain of the FITC channel of the flow cytometer to ensure linearity of the measurement. Calibrator beads contain five populations of beads coupled to different numbers of mouse IgG.\nCentrifuge Set-up beads, Calibrator beads, and cells (233 g, 4°C, 5 min).\nRemove FACS buffer by vacuum aspiration.\nResuspend Set-up beads, Calibrator beads, and cells each in 100 μL ice-cold FACS buffer with FITC-conjugate (1:50).\nIncubate Set-up beads, Calibrator beads, and cells on ice in the dark for 1 h.\nCritical: Protect cells and beads stained with FITC-conjugate from light-induced destruction of the fluorophore by incubating them in the dark.",
    "Note: Always prepare a master mix containing FACS buffer and FITC-conjugate for the use in parallel samples. This ensures that you add the exact same amount of FITC-conjugate to the cells and beads.\nNote: Dead cells absorb antibodies and can therefore increase the fluorescence signal. To exclude dead cells from analyses you can use a live-dead assay as described by the manufacturer in addition to staining of the cells with primary antibodies and FITC-conjugate. Live/dead stains are available in different colors and should be chosen depending on the laser and filter equipment of your flow cytometer.\nWash Set-up beads, Calibrator beads and cells with 3 mL FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge Set-up beads, Calibrator beads, and cells (233 g, 4°C, 5 min).\nRemove FACS buffer by vacuum aspiration.\nResuspend cells and beads in 300 μL FACS buffer.\nAnalyze the fluorescence intensity using a flow cytometer.\nPerform flow cytometer start-up.\nDetermine optimal gain of FITC detector channel:\nGate Set-up beads in the SSC-A against FSC-A scatter plot (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2921-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Determination of optimal gain of FITC detector channel\n(A) SSC-A and FSC-A of Set-up beads were analyzed by flow cytometry. The depicted gate marks single beads.\n(B) HepG2 cells were treated with IgG isotype control and FITC-conjugate (blue). Set-up beads were stained with FITC-conjugate (green). Analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] is modified from Reeh et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] with permission from Springer Nature.\nGate living cells in the SSC-A against FSC-A scatter plot and single cells in the FSC-H against FSC-W scatter plot (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).",
    "Adjust the detector gain of the FITC channel so that fluorescence of blank Set-up beads, control cells stained with IgG isotype control and FITC-conjugate, and the Set-up bead population with a high number of IgGs are depicted on the same log scale (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: This step is crucial to determine the linear range of the measurement. Once you start the measurement, you must not change the detector gain of the FITC channel as this would make it impossible to compare FITC fluorescence intensity between different samples for absolute quantification. However, changing the detector gain of FSC and SSC between the measurements of cells and beads may be needed as they differ greatly in size and granularity.\nRecord fluorescence intensity within the FITC channel of 10,000 Set-up beads, 10,000 Calibrator beads and 10,000 single cells/sample without changing the detector gain of the FITC channel.\nExport FCS files.\nCalculate amount of gp130 as described in the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section."
