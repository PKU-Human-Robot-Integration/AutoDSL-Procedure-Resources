Preparation and isolation of mouse FRT\n(A) Euthanized mice prepared for dissection.\n(B) Dissected mouse with exposed genital tract (left panel) with a yellow arrow highlighting the FRT and the isolated FRT (right panel).\n(C) The different FRT regions are separated.\nMake an incision in the skin and underlying abdominal muscles extending down to the genital part using sterile scissors and pin the opened skin to the dissection platform.\nClear off any connective tissue from the FRT (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nUsing bent forceps, carefully lift out the entire genital tissue by holding at the middle part of the cervix region (harder part of the cervix) and cut out the tissue from the area connected to the vagina (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPlace the FRT tissue in an empty 100 mm Petri dish and remove any associated adipose and connective tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTransfer the tissue to a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 10 mL ice-cold PBS and wash tissue by inverting the tube several times.\nTransfer the tissue to a sterile 100 mm Petri dish using forceps.",
    "Separate ectocervix and endocervix from the junction as indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] using a scalpel blade based on the physical characteristics of the tissue as follows.\nFirst, locate the ectocervix based on its hard, dense, and fibrous texture and proximity to the vagina. Cut the vaginal region from the ectocervix.\nThen choose a region close to the place of uterine horns bifurcation and dissect endocervical tissue.\nDissect out an area physically overlapping with the defined ectocervix and the endocervix, called the transition zone (TZ).\nPlace different FRT tissue regions in separate 100 mm Petri dishes.\nCritical: Use a separate scalpel blade to cut the ectocervix and endocervix region from the cervix junction to avoid contamination of cells between tissues.\nNote: From this step on, the tissue from different cervical regions can be processed in parallel.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Preparation and isolation of mouse FRT, related to steps 3–10\nShown are the steps in preparing the euthanized mice for dissection on the dissection platform, dissection, isolation of the FRT, and separation of ectocervix and endocervix from the junction as indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C\nCell isolation from the uterine cervix for single-cell RNA sequencing\nTiming: 2 h\nCritical: It is important to prepare single-cell suspensions within a short time and maintain the cells in a cool condition where appropriate to ensure high-quality RNA for the 10× Genomics sequencing.\nBy holding tissue with forceps, mince into small pieces using sterile scissors (less than 0.5 mm3 thickness) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1188-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Single-cell preparation from the endocervix and ectocervix tissue\n(A) Uterine Cervix tissue collected in PBS in a petri dish.\n(B) Cervix tissue minced into small pieces with scissors and scalpel blade.",
    "(C and D) Minced tissue is transferred to collagenase type II containing Falcon tube for tissue digestion (C) and the Falcon tube containing digested tissue after collagenase type II treatment (D).\n(E) Digested tissue is incubated with TrypLE for cell dissociation.\n(F) Filtration of the dissociated cells to remove cell clumps.\n(G and H) Cells isolated from uterine cervix tissue and imaged at 10× (G) and 20× (H) magnification.\nTransfer the minced tissue with a pipette into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 3 mL of collagenase type II (0.5 mg/mL) per tube pre-warmed at 37°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIncubate the tubes containing collagenase type II for 45 min at 37°C, 180 rpm in a horizontal position in an orbital shaker incubator.\nNote: Seal the cap of the Falcon tube with Parafilm to avoid leakage of solution and loss of cells.\nAfter digestion, gently pipette up and down 20 times with a 1 mL pipette to dissociate cell aggregates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCentrifuge the suspension at 1000 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully and retain the pellet.\nAdd 3 mL of pre-warmed TrypLE and resuspend the cell pellet using a 5 mL pipette boy by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C, 180 rpm, in an orbital shaker by placing the tube in the horizontal position.\nNote: Seal the Falcon tube cap with Parafilm to avoid leakage of solution and loss of cells.\nGently pipette up and down 20 times with a 1 mL pipette to dissociate cell aggregates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nAdd 5 mL of ice-cold PBS, centrifuge at 1000 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and retain the pellet.",
    "Critical: Re-suspend the pellet in 5 mL of ice-cold PBS containing 0.04% BSA, mix by inverting the tube several times.\nPass the solution into a pre-assembled 50 mL Falcon tube topped with a 40 μm cell strainer placed on ice to filter out tissue debris (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: Pre-wetting the filter with the PBS used for the cells can ease the passage of cells.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 6 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 3 mL ice-cold PBS containing 0.04% BSA and count the cells using a Neubauer counting chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G) (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nProceed immediately to step 28−29 for single-cell sequencing and to avoid loss of cell viability.\nNote: Depending on the cell type, viability may significantly decrease or form clumps (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells) when cells are kept in suspension for a prolonged time before use. Non-viable and dying cells generally contain more fragmented RNA that may not be efficiently captured by 10× Genomics Single Cell Solutions and may, therefore, decrease cell recovery efficiency.\nOptional: Cell viability assay\nTiming: 20 min\nTake 10 μL of cell suspension from step 25 and mix thoroughly with 10 μL of trypan blue.\nLoad 10 μL onto the Neubauer chamber to determine the cell viability.\nNote: If the samples have less than 70% viability, dead cells may be removed by following the dead cells removal protocol from 10× Genomics https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-removal-of-dead-cells-from-single-cell-suspensions-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-removal-of-dead-cells-from-single-cell-suspensions-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing]\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 6 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant.\nCritical: Re-suspend the cell pellet in the required volume of ice-cold PBS containing 0.04% BSA to obtain a cell concentration of 700 to 1200 cells/ μL, which is the optimal range of cell concentration for 10× Chromium Controller.",
    "Immediately following cell counting, proceed to the 10× Genomics protocol for single library preparation and sequencing.\nPerform single-cell partition into nanolitre-scale Gel-Bead-In-Emulsions (GEMs) and reverse transcription using Single-Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v2 and library construction for Illumina sequencing (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v2-chemistry[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v2-chemistry]).\nNote: The data in our manuscript Chumduri et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] was generated using the V2 kit. However, a new kit with v3 Chemistry has become available currently (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep?filter=chromium[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep?filter=chromium]). We recommend following the manufacturer's instructions for using the newer versions of the kits as they become available.\nLoad approximately 13,000 cells per sample onto the 10× Genomics Chromium Controller chip to recover approximately 6,000 cells (Chumduri et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: Users can choose other loading cell numbers and expected target cell recovery depending on the need and budget. 10× Genomics recommends loading 13,000 cells for 7500 target cell recovery (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nPerform reverse transcription of single-cell GEMs to produce barcoded cDNA and amplify the cDNA using a SimpliAmp Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) or similar Thermal Cycler.\nQuantify the cDNA library and check the quality using a Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent).\nProceed to sequence in paired-end mode with S1 100-cycles kit using Novaseq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) with approximately 400 million reads allocated per sample with at least 70,000 reads per cell.\nNote: Users can choose other platforms depending on sample size, the required sequencing depth, and the budget.
