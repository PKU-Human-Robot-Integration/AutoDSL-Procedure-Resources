    "NOTE: Fluorochrome incubation and confocal analysis will take at least 2-3 h for a control and a treated sample. Data processing is not included in this time calculation. Required materials can be found in the Table of Materials. This protocol can be applied to fresh or cryopreserved spermatozoa. Solea senegalensis is a fish species that spawns in cold water, work always under cold conditions (4-7 °C). See Figure 1 for a general view of the protocol.\n1. Preparatory Work Before the Experiment\nPrepare a 1 mM mitochondria stain stock solution in analytical grade DMSO.\nPrepare a 1 μg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) stock solution in deionized water.\nPrepare a 200 mOsm/kg Ringer solution (116 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.7)\nPrepare a 4 mM 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) stock solution in analytical grade methanol.\n\tNOTE: Keep the stock solutions in aliquots at -20 °C until needed.\nSet the microcentrifuge at 4-7 °C.\n2. Sample Preparation Before Fluorochrome Incubation\nNOTE: Gentle handling of spermatozoa is desirable when pipetting and resuspending.\nIf working with cryopreserved cells, prepare a water bath for thawing at 40 °C for Solea senegalensis spermatozoa10. Immerse the straw samples in the water bath for 7 s.\nUsing scissors to cut, empty the sample into a microfuge tube and centrifuge at 1000 x g, 4-7 °C for 1 min.\nRemove seminal plasma or seminal plasma with cryoprotectants from the cryopreserved sample by pipetting to discard any component that could interfere with the staining protocol.\nResuspend the cells in 50-100 μL of 4 °C 200 mOsm/kg Ringer solution.\nDetermine the sperm concentration with a Neubauer or a similar counting chamber under a stereoscopic microscope.",
    "Dilute the cell suspension up to 1-2 x 106 cells/mL in a final volume of 0.5 mL in 4 °C Ringer solution.\n3. Fluorochrome Incubation\nNOTE: Fluorochromes must be handled in low light conditions, especially when in solution.\nAdd 3.125 μL of DCFH-DA stock solution (final concentration in the sample: 25 μM) to the working sample dilution. Incubate at 4-7 °C for 40 min in darkness10.\nAfter 30 min, add 0.5 μL of the DAPI stock solution (final concentration in the sample: 2 μM) and 0.5 μL of the mitochondria stain stock solution (final concentration in the sample: 100 nM) to the sample. Incubate both fluorochromes for 10 min in darkness.\n4. Sample Preparation for Confocal Microscopy\nAfter the incubation time, centrifuge the cell suspension at 1000 x g, 4-7 °C for 1 min.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully by pipetting.\nAdd a 10-20 μL of 200 mOsm/kg Ringer solution.\nPlace 5 μL of a concentrated cell suspension drop on a slide.\nCarefully, put a cover slide on the preparation and seal it with polish. Once the polish is dry, the preparation is ready for confocal microscopy.\n5. Confocal Setup Prior to the Experiment\nNOTE: Depending on the microscope, DCFH-DA could be \"burnt\". Establish the best conditions with a non-valuable sample first.\nTurn on the microscope, lasers, camera and the computer running the microscope.\nSet excitation lasers taking into account the excitation and emission maximums of each fluorochrome:\n\t\nFor DAPI, use an excitation maximum of 358 nm and an emission maximum of 465 nm.\nFor the mitochondrial stain, use an excitation maximum of 644 nm and an emission maximum of 662 nm.\nFor DCFH-DA, use an excitation maximum of 504 nm and an emission maximum of 525 nm.",
    "Start working with 25X objective to focus on the spermatozoa. Choose the DAPI channel to focus because this fluorochrome reports the highest intensity. Once the cells are focused, use a 63X or 100X objective for a thorough evaluation because Solea senegalensis spermatozoa size is around 2 μm.\nFor each channel, optimize the pinhole, the gain and the voltage. In the same way, adjust the digital offset to reduce background. Once all parameters are optimized for the fluorochrome used, save the settings. For a routine experiment for a single Solea senegalensis sperm cell we used the following (these parameters may change in each experiment): pinhole of 1 and the gain voltage of 750 V.\n6. Acquisition of Images\nSelect the desired quality conditions for the image acquisition. Define acquisition settings like bit depth, image format, light sheet thickness, and choose single sided illumination. For a routine experiment for a single Solea senegalensis spermatozoa we used the following (these parameters may change in each experiment): frame size of 1024 px; bits per pixel of 16; scan speed of 2-4).\nOpen and center the scan area to begin and take an image of the field.\nUsing the crop tool, select the region of interest and press live.\nWith the help of the range indicator tool, adjust the digital offset to reduce the background. Do this for each channel and take the image.\nCheck the quality of individual channels for each fluorochrome and their combinations.\n7. Creating a 3D Image Video\nZ-stack acquisition settings.\n\t\nChoose the Z-stack option in the software.\nSelect the single cell, group of cells or region of interest and focus it.",
    "Delimit the Z-stack with the 'First Slice' and 'Last Slice' options and establish the z step to interval to 0.2 µm with the help of the fine focus. Choose DAPI channel to focus because this fluorochrome may report the highest intensity and you can easily select the whole spermatozoa head. Choose the optimal acquisition parameters for each channel and run the experiment.\nRun the Z-stack experiment. Split the channels and observe the localization of each signal within the cells.\nZ-stack process.\n\t\nVolume render: Once the experiment is finished, select the options of the Z-stack processing software and choose the volume render option. Select the number of steps and the rotation degrees (360°). Save the file with a video extension.\nStereo anaglyph: Choose stereo anaglyph in the options process window. This tool allows to create a 3D image video with split channels.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
