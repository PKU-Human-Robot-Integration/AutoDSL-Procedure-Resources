    "Hippocampal neuron plating preparation Note: Steps 1–5 should be performed under sterile conditions in a tissue culture room and in a class II biosafety hood, equipped with a vacuum flask system and an aspirator hood. Dilute poly-L-lysine stock solution to a working solution of 50 µg/mL. Add an appropriate amount of working solution to coat glass coverslips placed inside wells of a 24-well plate (~500 µL/well) or a 35 mm MatTek glass-bottom dish (~1 mL/well) and incubate at 37 °C for at least 2 h or overnight, a range that in our experience coats the coverslip surface for the proper adherence of hippocampal neurons.Wash coverslips three times in sterile, cell culture grade water.Fill each well of a 24-well plate containing single coverslips with 500 µL of Plating media (DMEM + 10% FBS) (half the final volume) and incubate at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 until plating (see Notes #4 below).Thaw Mixture A and DNase I. Mix 5 mL of Mixture A + 45 units of papain powder in a 15 mL Falcon tube and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min until papain dissolves completely. Then, add 1 mL of 0.05% DNase I, filter-sterilize the mixture through a 0.22 µm filter, and keep the solution in a 15 mL Falcon tube at room temperature for up to 2 h.Pre-warm ~25 mL of the Plating media (DMEM + 10% FBS) at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 in a 150 mm dish.Mouse hippocampal neuron isolation and plating [adapted from Kaech and Banker (2006)] Note: Steps 1–8 can be done on a standard laboratory bench. Steps 9–16 should be done in a class II biosafety hood, equipped with a vacuum flask system and an aspirator hood.",
    "Steps 4–8 should be done quickly, ideally in under 30 min to avoid deterioration of tissue. Collect mouse neonates at P0 (Day 0) and up to P2 (Day 2). Keep the pups in contact with a bag of warm water or with a preheated heating pad.Clean the dissection tools with water and soap, followed by a wash with 70% ethanol.Dish A and B: Put ~8 mL of Dissection media into two 60 mm dishes and in a 15 mL Falcon tube inside an ice bucket (Figure 1).Decapitate the pups with surgical scissors into Dish A, containing the Dissection media. Shake gently to clean off the blood (Figure 1A).Peel off the skin and the skull using two Dumont forceps. Isolate the brain into Dish B (Figure 1B).Split the brain along the midline with Dumont forceps. Remove the cerebellum on the posterior side and discard. Position the medial side of the hemisphere facing up. Remove the midbrain (ventral part) by inserting the Dumont forceps ~45° and flipping. Peel off meninges (membrane covering cortex) and blood vessels (Figure 1C).Ensure the hippocampus (seahorse/banana shaped) is visible and intact. To isolate hippocampus, stabilize the hemisphere by spearing the base of the brain and by cutting along the top edges of the hippocampus using Dumont forceps (Figure 1C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4651/bioprotoc-13-07-4651-g001.jpgFigure 1. Isolation of hippocampi from mouse P0–P2 neonates for primary hippocampal cultures. (A) Decapitate; (B) Remove the brain; (C) Harvest the hippocampus (outlined by dotted lines in bottom figure). Numbers 4–7 correspond to steps in Procedure B. (adapted from https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/neurobiology/neurobiology-protocols/isolation-of-mouse-primary-neurons.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/neurobiology/neurobiology-protocols/isolation-of-mouse-primary-neurons.html]).Using a 10 mL serological pipette, gently transfer both hippocampi into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing Dissection media. Repeat the steps to harvest more hippocampi, if needed.Note: Work inside a biosafety hood for the rest of the protocol.",
    "Aspirate the Dissection media and wash the hippocampi twice in ~8 mL of cold HBSS (without antibiotics).Note: Be careful not to aspirate hippocampi. Aspirate HBSS. Add ~1 mL of the Brain Digestion Enzyme (5 mL of Mixture A + 45 units of papain + 1 mL of 0.05% DNaseI) per two hippocampi. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Invert the tube gently by hand a couple of times every 2–5 min, so that dead cells on the outer layers detach during this step.Note: It is critical for viability of plated neurons that temperature is 37 °C and not higher. Aspirate the Brain Digestion Enzyme slowly and gently. Wash twice with ~6 mL of Plating media (DMEM + 10% FBS), pre-warmed at 37 °C.Aspirate the Plating media and add back ~1.2 mL of Plating media per two hippocampi. Use a P1000 micropipette to pipette up and down 7–10 times to dissociate the hippocampi (avoid making bubbles). Let the debris sink for 3–5 min.Pipette ~1 mL of the top part of the supernatant containing dissociated cells into a new 15 mL Falcon tube and add 5 mL of the Plating media for a total volume of 6 mL.Plating cells in 24-well plates:  pipette ~500 µL of the cells into each well of a 24-well plate containing 500 µL of pre-warmed Plating media. Mix each well carefully. The cell density plated for experiments in this protocol is two hippocampi in 12 wells of a 24-well plate, which corresponds to ~ 70,000–125,000 cells per well.Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below), for 1–5 h to allow attachment of the cells to the coverslips.",
    "Gently aspirate the Plating media one well at a time using a P1000 micropipette and replace immediately with 1 mL of Growth media (NBA + B-27 + GlutaMAX) per well. This media should be pre-warmed in the incubator at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below). Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below).Note: Do not let coverslips dry during media change. Check the plate under the microscope for density, growth, and health of neurons every day. At Days in vitro (DIV) 2, neurites with growth cones should be visible in healthy neurons (Figure 2A). At DIV 4–5, axons (orange arrows) and dendrites (green arrows) are identifiable by morphology (Figure 2B). From this stage forward, neurons are ready for transfection and imaging. By DIV 9–10, axons and dendrites continue to grow and fasciculate extensively (Figure 2C). Researchers might find it difficult to discern a single axon without transfection of axonal fluorescent proteins.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4651/bioprotoc-13-07-4651-g002.jpgFigure 2. Growth of cultured primary hippocampal neurons at (A) day in vitro (DIV) 2, (B) DIV 4, (C) DIV 9. Neurons were plated at 1:12 dilution, i.e., two hippocampi were plated in 12 wells in a 24-well plate, yielding 75,000–125,000 cells/coverslip. Images were taken with a Nikon Plan Fluor 40×/1.3NA oil objective using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) optics. Asterisks = soma; arrows point at axons (orange arrows) or dendrites (green arrows). Scale bar = 10 μm.Transfection of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons Note: This protocol is modified from one suggested for the use of Lipofectamine 2000 (InvitrogenTM;https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/cell-culture/transfection-protocol/lipofectamine-2000.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/cell-culture/transfection-protocol/lipofectamine-2000.html]). This protocol is for the transfection of one coverslip in a 24-well plate of neurons at DIV 5–8; adjust accordingly for the number of coverslips required. These steps should be done under a sterile biosafety hood in a tissue culture room. Prepare two 1.",
    "5 mL Eppendorf tubes.In tube 1, add 50 μL (volume adjusted) of Growth media + 400–800 ng of endotoxin-free purified plasmids that will be transfected. For PrP-mCherry (mCh) plasmids, we added 800 ng. Mix by flicking the tip of the Eppendorf tube and incubate for 5 min.In tube 2, add 48 μL of Growth media + 2 μL of Lipofectamine 2000. Mix by flicking the tip of the Eppendorf tube and incubate for 5 min.Spin tube 1 and tube 2 quickly (~5 s) in a MINI microfuge.After 5 min of incubation, combine the diluted DNA (tube 1) with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 (tube 2) by dropwise pipetting. Mix by flicking the tip of the Eppendorf tube and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 min.Transfer 500 μL of the media from each well of the 24-well plate, where neurons have been plated for 5–8 days (DIV 5–8), into empty wells of a 24-well plate and add 500 μL of new Growth media to these wells to make a total of 1mL. This will be the media to add back to each well of neurons after transfection to allow the transfer of neurotrophic factors secreted in each well pre-transfection.Add 100 μL of plasmid-Lipofectamine 2000 mix to each well of the 24-well plate where the neurons are plated. Incubate at 37°C and 5.0% CO2 for 2 h (see Notes #4 below).After 2 h, replace all the media from each well containing the neurons with the Growth media prepared in step 4. Protein expression from the plasmid transfection depends on the plasmid, protein being expressed, and concentration being transfected, but could occur as early as 45 min to 1 h after transfection.Notes:  Incubation in Lipofectamine 2000 for longer than 3–4 h will result in toxicity.",
    "This protocol usually yields 1%–5% transfection efficiency, which is useful to observe fluorescent protein expression in single neurons and in single axons. Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment Note: Parts D–K will demonstrate the experimental procedures for PrPPG14-mCh expressing neurons. The same procedures apply to PrPWT-mCh (control) or any other membrane protein of interest. Retention of PrPPG14-mCh in the ERPrepare the transfection mixture (Lipofectamine 2000 + plasmids) as in Procedure C. In the 100 μL mixture, add 0.5 μL of 1,000× BFA solution (1:200 dilution).Apply the transfection mixture with BFA to neurons. The final concentration of BFA per well is 5 μg/mL (1×).Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) and replace the media with 5 μg/mL BFA for another 1–5 h (Figure 3A).Note: Longer incubation time results in higher protein expression but more leakage from ER into other compartments. Image the PrPPG14-mCh expression pattern in the soma and axons using live imaging. Use the same media with BFA during live imaging.Note: Neurons can be immunostained with organelle-specific antibodies to confirm protein localization in the cellular compartments at a given time (see examples in Chassefeyre et al., 2021). Releasing PrPPG14-mCh from the ERRepeat steps 1a–1c from Procedure D.After 2–6 h of 5 μg/mL BFA treatment, replace the media with new Growth media pre-warmed at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below; Figure 3B).Using a live imaging microscope, image the PrPPG14-mCh expression pattern one or two days post-transfection in the soma and in axons every 10–30 min. The signal of PrPPG14-mCh should appear as big, round punctate aggregates along the length of axons, and as large punctate aggregates in the soma. To confirm that PrPPG14-mCh transits into lysosomes in the soma as observed previously (Chassefeyre et al., 2021), follow steps in Procedure H.",

Timeline of Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment of hippocampal neurons. (A) Hold PrPPG14-mCh in the ER. (B) Release PrPPG14-mCh from the ER.Imaging BTX-AF647-labeled surface PrP and its subsequent internalization (Figure 4) Cloning of Bungarotoxin binding sequence (BBS) into PrP was fully described in Chessefeyre et al. (2021). In brief, a 13 amino-acid BBS tag (WRYYESSLEPYPD) was inserted at the BspEI site in the linker between mCh and the C-terminal of the PrP sequence downstream of mCh, which was shown to not alter PrP trafficking or endoggresome formation. Endotoxin-free purification of PrPPG14-mCh-BBS in MoPrP.Xho vector is recommended for transfection of primary neurons.Transfect neurons at DIV 5-8 with PrPWT-mCh-BBS or PrPPG14-mCh-BBS following the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol outlined in Procedure C.Two days post-transfection, treat neurons with 150 μM tubocurarine chloride diluted in Growth media and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below; Figure 4B).Note: BTX can bind to acetylcholine (ACh) receptors on the surface of neurons. Tubocurarine blocks ACh receptors and thus reduces BTX-AF647 binding and background fluorescence signal. Replace the Growth media containing tubocurarine with Growth media containing 7 μg/mL of BTX-AF647 and incubate neurons at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) for 1 h.Wash with Growth media and image the live BTX-AF647 signal immediately or one day later.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4651/bioprotoc-13-07-4651-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Schematic for the live imaging of endocytosis of PrPPG14-mCh-BBS into endocytic vesicles and/or the accumulation of PrPPG14-mCh-BBS in endoggresomes one day after transfection.",
    "Dynasore treatment to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis of PrPPG14-mCh from the neuronal cell surface Follow Procedure E steps 1 and 2 to transfect DIV 5–8 neurons with PrPPG14-mCh-BBS. One or two days post-transfection, add 0.5 μL of 80 nM Dynasore DMSO stock to 500 μL Growth media, mix well, and apply to neurons. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) (Figure 5A).Replace the media with Growth media + 150 μM Tubocurarine + 80 μM Dynasore and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) (Figure 5B).Replace the media with Growth media + 7 μg/mL BTX-AF647 + 80 μM Dynasore and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) (Figure 5B).Replace the media with Growth media and image neurons starting immediately and then at desired timepoints up to a day later, to image PrPWT/PG14-mCh-BBS internalization and/or aggregation in endoggresomes and the requirement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in these events (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4651/bioprotoc-13-07-4651-g005.jpgFigure 5.

Monitoring the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis on PrPPG14-mCh-BBS internalization and/or on the formation of endoggresomes within one day after PrPPG14-mCh-BBS expression.Thrombin treatment to cleave off PrP at the cell surface Cloning of Thrombin cleavage sequence (TCS)-tagged construct MoPrP.Xho PrPPG14-mCh-TCS was described in Chassefeyre et al. (2021). Briefly, the TCS tag (LVPRGS) was inserted at the BspEI site downstream of mCh and was shown not to alter PrP trafficking or PrPPG14-mCh endoggresome formation. Endotoxin-free purification of PrPPG14-mCh-BBS in MoPrP.Xho vector is recommended for transfection of primary neurons (Figure 6A).Transfect neurons at DIV 5–8 with PrPPG14-mCh-BBS following the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol outlined in Procedure C (Figure 6B).",
    "After 2 h of incubation in Growth media + Lipofectamine 2000 transfection mix at 37 °C, 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below), replace media with Growth media + 5 units/mL of Thrombin protease. Incubate neurons at 37 °C, 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) up to 2 days prior to live imaging of PrPPG14-mCh endoggresome formation (Figure 6B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4651/bioprotoc-13-07-4651-g006.jpgFigure 6. (A) Schematic and (B) timeline of Thrombin treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons. Cleavage of PrPPG14-mCh at the TCS site and its release from the cell surface.LysoTrackerTMassay to probe for acidic endolysosomes Grow and transfect neurons with PrPPG14-mCh as described in Procedure C (Figure 7A).Prepare 50 nM of LysoTrackerTM Green (or other desired LysoTracker with different fluorescent dyes) in Growth media. Incubate DIV 5–8 neurons in LysoTracker for 2 h at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below). Wash 2–3 times in Growth media and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) prior to live imaging. Do not wait longer than 30 min as LysoTrackerTM signal might grow fainter with time (Figure 7B).Live image LysoTrackerTM Green signal using a microscope equipped with a 488 nm laser (Figure 7B).Notes:  LysoTrackerTM Green: optimal excitation wavelength is around 504 nm and optimal emission around 511 nm. LysoTrackerTM fluorescence signal could be weak (Chassefeyre et al., 2021). Image LysoTrackerTM-treated neurons following the recommendations of vendors, which in our protocols is within 30 min to 1 h post-treatment of cells with LysoTrackerTM. This will circumvent the photobleaching that can occur after longer periods of LysoTrackerTM treatment. Imaging using decreased laser power aids in avoiding photobleaching during image acquisition, as well as imaging using other microscopes, e.g., a lattice light sheet microscope.",
    "Ideally, this assay should be combined with other lysosomal protein markers (such as LAMP1) or Magic Red® (see Procedure Part I).Magic Red® Cathepsin B assay to probe the activity of Cathepsin B enzyme in degradative lysosomes (Figure 7) Grow and transfect neurons with PrPPG14-mCh as described in Procedure C.Dilute 250× DMSO stock of Magic Red® in sterile H2O. Apply 10 μL into each well of a 24-well plate with plated DIV 5–8 neurons, containing 250 μL of Growth media. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) (Figure 7B).Wash wells containing Magic Red® 2–3 times with Growth media. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) prior to live imaging (Figure 7B).Live image Magic Red® signal using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a 561 nm laser (Figure 7B).Notes:  Magic Red® has an excitation wavelength of 592 nm and an optimal emission of 628 nm. LysoTrackerTM Green and DeepRed Magic Red® can be combined in the same experiment to cross-validate the observation that degradative and acidic endolysosomal organelles are present in the soma and in axons. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4651/bioprotoc-13-07-4651-g007.jpgFigure 7.

Probing for PrPPG14-mTagBFP2 in degradative endolysosomes.Image acquisition and axon identification Pre-warm the incubation chamber on the microscope until the temperature reaches a steady 37 °C. Prepare ahead of time the CO2 chamber.Live imaging of primary neurons grown on #1.5 glass coverslips in 24-well plates is done on 35 mm MatTek dishes. Add a mixture of ~500 μL of new Growth media and ~500 μL of old Growth media from the culture well to each 35 mm MatTek dish and keep dish at 37 °C and 5.",
    "0% CO2 (see Notes #4 below) prior to placing the coverslip inside (step 3).Using Dumont tweezers with an angled fine tip, pick up the coverslip from the edge. Using care not to drop the coverslip, flip it with the cells side down onto the bottom of the MatTek dish, inside the glass bottom area.Mount the MatTek dish on the microscope stage within a 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 environment. Let the cells stabilize to that environment for 10–15 min prior to imaging.Using 60× or 100× objectives with high NA, localize the transfected cells using widefield or fluorescence illumination. Distinguish dendrites vs. axons based on neuronal morphology (Encalada et al., 2011). Find the isolated axon region and acquire images.Note: Unless otherwise indicated, the axon region imaged is of a mid-axon region, defined as a location at least ~200 μm away from the soma and from the axon termini."
