    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSurgery\nTiming: <1 h for headbar implant only, 1–2 days if including a viral injection and cranial window implant\nHere, we describe how to attach the headbar to the mouse skull as well as implant a grounding pin for lick counting. For details on intracranial viral injections and/or cranial window implants, which should be done prior or simultaneously to headbar implantation, see Mizrahi et al. (2004)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and Dombeck et al. (2007)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nAnesthetize the mouse in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols.\nOnce anesthetized and unresponsive to touch, maintain anesthesia with 1%–2% isoflurane and 0.5 L/min O2 with the mouse on a heating pad.\nClean scalp with betadine and 70% ethanol. Use a scalpel to make a longitudinal incision about 5–6 mm long, exposing the skull.\nUsing scalpel, thoroughly etch the surface of the skull to enhance the bonding of the Optibond and dental cement to the surface of the skull. Then, apply a layer of Optibond dental adhesive over the exposed surface of the skull. If necessary, pull the skin back with forceps to avoid getting Optibond on the skin. Cure the Optibond using blue light.\nIf injecting virus and/or implanting electrodes or a cranial window, follow that procedure now and then return to this protocol.\nIf necessary, sterilize grounding pin and implant on the back of the skull, over the cerebellum.\nPrepare a smooth portion of the back of the skull by trimming away neck muscle and then drill a small (∼1 mm) craniotomy.\nCritical: The muscle has a tendency to bleed, so carefully scrape away the connective tissue where the muscle connects to the skull with a scalpel to minimize bleeding.",
    "Using forceps with a steady hand, insert the tungsten wire end of the gold pin into the craniotomy and hold as still as possible. With the other hand, apply Flow-It ALC around the base of the pin and then cure with blue light.\nCritical: Make sure to implant the pin at an angle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) that will not interfere with the treadmill setup when you attach it to the mouse or with the objective if you are imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/954-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Three views of a mouse with a surgically implanted cranial window and headbar, head-fixed to a custom head plate\nNote the lick port positioned by the spout and a grounding wire connected to an implanted pin.\nThe blue light used to cure the composite dental adhesives may irritate the mouse’s skin (e.g., ears) when exposed. Aim the light away from it, or cover up any exposed skin when curing.\nImplant the headbar using dental cement.\nApply a thin layer of dental cement over the entire surface of the skull. This layer should have a low viscosity (determined by relative amounts of dental cement powder and dental cement liquid mixed together) to allow it to spread easily.\nAfter 2–3 min, apply a small amount of thick dental cement to the back of the skull. Immediately place the headbar in the middle of this thick spot of cement so that the wings of the headbar are perpendicular to the long axis of the mouse’s body. Be sure to balance the headbar before the cement dries fully so that the mouse will not be at an angle while head-fixed.\nApply one last coat of dental cement over the back of the headbar and spread around to the rest of the skull with care not to cover the wings of the headbar.",
    "Allow the dental cement 5–10 min to dry.\nInject the mouse subcutaneously with 5 mg/kg of carpofen dissolved in saline (at a concentration of 1 mg/mL)and remove from anesthesia.\nMice should begin to recover from anesthesia within minutes and will be fully responsive in approximately one hour.\nWater restriction and habituation\nTiming: 1 week\nIn order to ensure mice are sufficiently motivated to walk on the treadmill for water rewards, water consumption must be restricted in some way that follows IACUC-approved water deprivation protocols. We replace homecage water with 2% citric acid water, which reduces water intake and is a safer alternative to removing homecage access to water completely (Reinagel, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Urai et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nReplace homecage water with 2% citric acid water.\nWeigh mice prior to citric acid water treatment (baseline) and then every day for 5 days and then once per week after treatment has begun.\nCritical: Ensure that animal weight does not drop below 85% of the baseline weight. If this does happen, immediately allow access to 1 mL of clean water. If a mouse continues to be below this threshold, remove from experiments.\nDuring the first week of citric acid water treatment, habituate mice to handling by the experimenter in the room in which experiments will be conducted. Do this for at least 3 min per day for 3 days (does not need to be consecutive).\nPrior to starting any behavior session, ensure that there is sufficient water in the syringe and that all treadmill data is being acquired.\nTo test whether all data are being acquired, run a test session\nOne week after the beginning of citric acid water administration, begin training.\nTreadmill training\nTiming: ∼2–3 weeks",
    "Mice will vary in the amount of training sessions needed to walk well on the treadmill. Begin with 20-min training sessions, and reduce the training time as mice improve walking by 5 min per session until training session are 10 min long. Define the number of laps you will need for your experimental purposes, and train mice until the entire cohort has reached that level or has been excluded.\nRun the program RunTreadmill.m and enter all the relevant information in the GUI.\nDo not start the data acquisition until the animal is head-fixed.\nAffix the headbar to the head plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nIf the mouse turns so that its rear legs are to the side or nearly in front of the head, gently tug the treadmill belt until the mouse is in a walking position. Some mice may continue to do this during the first couple of days of training, but it will diminish over time.\nCritical: When placing mice on and off the treadmill, take care not to stress them as this will impair performance. Quickly transfer mice from the cage to the treadmill platform and avoid dangling them by the tail. Do not overly force the mouse into head-fixation. Place the mouse behind the head-fixation stage. Many mice naturally duck their heads under the head-fixation stage to investigate. When they do this, simply pull the belt forward lightly so that the headbar is now near the fixation point and hold the headbar in place while screws are inserted. This minimizes the degree to which you have to force the mouse in place. Over training they will become more used to this process and tend to voluntarily walk to the head-fixation position.",
    "On day 1, train the animal to lick the reward spout by administering a free 10 μL reward (10% Splenda in water) and touching it to their snout.\nOnly do this once per day at the beginning of the training session for the first 2–3 days.\nRun the session from the MATLAB command line.\nStart a timer for the duration of the session. Turn off the room lights and come back when the timer has gone off.\nUnscrew the headbar and gently place the mouse back in the homecage.\nCheck the performance on the task (e.g., rewards earned, licking behavior, etc.) by running the OpenTreadmillFile.m program.\nNote: Reward volumes vary in the literature (4–20 μL). Although we use a 10 μL reward, others may decide to vary this amount based on their specific experimental needs.\nNote: For sanitary purposes, clean the syringe containing sweetened water regularly (once per week) by flushing with 70% ethanol and tap water to avoid mold growth. Regularly clean the area of mouse feces and replace treadmill belts when they become soiled. This will vary based on frequency and volume of use, but is usually around once every 1–2 months."
