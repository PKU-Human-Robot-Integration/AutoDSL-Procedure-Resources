    "All Procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to national guidelines.\n1. Preparation of Fixators Prior to Surgery\nBefore creating stabilized fracture, one needs to assemble the custom-design external fixation device. The custom-designed external fixation frames consisted of two aluminum rings stabilized by three stainless-steel #0/56 threaded rods, 8 #2/56 hexagonal nuts, and 17 matching bolts (Small Part Inc., Miami Lakes, FL3).\nTwo aluminum rings are needed per fracture. To one ring assemble 4 #2/56 hexagonal nuts (small Part Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) and matching bolts into the appropriate holes, these should remain loose. This will be the proximal ring. To the distal ring assemble 3 nuts and bolts, again do not tighten fully.\n2. Anesthesia, Fracture Creation, and Fixator Application\nMice (age, sex, and body weight are determined by the user) are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50mg/ml Ketamine, 0.5 mg/ml Medetomidine (0.03 ml/mouse).\nApply eye lubricant to the eyes of the mice and place a piece of tape across their head to protect their eyes during the procedure.\nThe animal is placed on a heating pad for the remainder of the procedure.\nTransfix the proximal and distal metaphyses of the left tibia using four 0.25 mm sterile insect pins (Anticorro: Fine Science Tool, Foster City, CA) by attaching the pins to a Dremel Tool and drilling them through the bone.\nPins are oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia, and 90 ° to each other. At least 10 mm between the proximal and distal pins.\nPosition the first ring above the proximal pins with the nuts facing inward, toward the pins. Secure the pins to the ring keeping the tibia positioned centrally within the aluminum ring.",
    "Position the second ring below the distal pins and secure the pins to the ring using the hexagonal nuts as before. Add the fourth nut-bolt combination to the distal fixator.\nCreate the transverse fracture by three-point bending with an appropriate device. We use the gravity system of Bonnarens and Einhorn 4. Rest the posterolateral surface of the tibia across the blocks, raise the weight to a predetermined height along the drop arm and drop the weight so that it contacts the anterolateral aspect of the tibia to produce the blunt fracture. The height the weight is dropped from needs to be determined for each strain of mouse to ensure a single fracture exclusively of the tibia.\nFracture is confirmed by X-ray.\nAfter confirming the fracture, three stainless steel #0/56 threaded rods are attached to the rings. Starting from the distal end insert the rod and thread a nut onto the distal ring to secure the rod. Then put another nut onto the rod, the proximal ring will sit on top of this nut. Ensure that the two rings will be held at equal distances and are not straining the pins. Secure the proximal ring to the rods with a third nut.\nSubcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (1.0 mg/kg) for analgesia are given immediately after surgery and animals are monitored for pain and given buprenorphine as needed.\nAnesthesia is reversed by administering Atipamezole, and animals are monitored until they are responsive and ambulating.\n3. Distraction Osteogenesis (see also: 12,13)\nTo modify this procedure to accommodate distraction osteogenesis is straightforward. The rings are held in position by threaded rods, and by turning the nuts holding the rods in place the rings can be moved apart.",
    "Latency: For standard distraction osteogenesis using this model the fixators are placed onto the tibia and left alone for a latency period of 5 days.\nDistraction: Distraction osteogenesis can be performed by turning the nuts on the stabilizing rods ¼ turn (0.25 mm) every day 7 days.\nMaturation: Bony bridging is observed by 10 days and complete consolidation is observed by 27 days after the completion of distraction.\n4. Creation of a Critical Sized Defect\nTo create a critical sized defect the external fixators are applied as previously described with the following modifications.\nBefore beginning the procedure the skin is cleaned with 70 % ethanol.\nThe fixators are applied completely prior to creating the defect.\nThe mouse is then place under the dissecting microscope to visualize the medial tibia, and an incision (5-7 mm) is made with a #10 blade on a scalpel.\nThe muscle is gently transected and separated to expose the mid-diaphysis of the tibia.\nA 3 mm segment of the bone is then removed from the mid-diaphysis using scissors. Using the point of the scissors, the bone is slowly snipped away and bone fragments are removed with forceps if necessary. Care should be taken with the tips of the scissors to avoid displacing the tibia with a large mechanical force.\nExamine the surgical site to ensure that there are no bone fragments, as these could promote healing.\nReplace the muscle around the blunted ends of the tibia.\nClose the incision on the skin with 2-3 sutures of 6-0 Polyamine Monofilament.\nAnesthesia is reversed and the animals are monitored for pain and given analgesics as previously described.\n5. Representative Results",
    "When properly applied, the external fixators provide more rigid stability of the closed tibial fracture with excellent reduction (Figs. 1, 2). However, in some cases inadequate reduction (an obvious and large gap between bone ends or multiple fractures occur (Fig. 3), and these mice are excluded from analyses. Fractures stabilized using this method heal primarily via intramembranous ossification (Fig. 4). In contrast, if the fracture is not stabilized a large cartilage callus is formed in the fracture gap (Fig. 5), and this is replaced by bone through the process of intramembranous ossification.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3552/3552fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
