    "Generation of HBV-replicating stable cell linesTransfection of HepG2 cellsGrow HepG2 cells in MEM/10% FBS at a 37 °C, CO2 incubator. Split the cells to a 10-cm plate 24 h before transfection; the cell density should reach 70-90% at the time of DNA transfection.Dilute 20 μg each of pTSMP-HBV1.3 plasmids of genotype Ae (AY707087), Ba (GU357842), Ce (GU357845) and D1 (GU357846) with 2 ml opti-MEM serum-free medium, respectively. Mix gently.Note: The map of pTSMP-HBV1.3 plasmid and the genome organization of HBV1.3 used in this study are shown in Figures 2A and 2B, respectively. The construction of pTSMP-HBV1.3 plasmids can be referred to (Wu et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629020540_5651.jpgFigure 2.

    "Run samples on BD FACS Aria III machine, the excitation light required is 561 nm (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629020912_7571.jpgFigure 3. The first round of mCherry-activated FACS sorting. Negative cell with unexpressed mCherry is HepG2 (blue peak), positive cell with expressed mCherry is HepG2-pTsmp-1.3HBV-S11 (red peak).The sorted mCherry-expressing cells are cultured in a 6-well culture plate for expansion in the presence of puromycin selection (2 μg/ml). Refresh Culture medium containing puromycin every 2 days.On the following day, when cell confluence is 70-80%, the cells are subjected to the second round of mCherry fluorescence-activated FACS sorting and further puromycin selection.After about a 4-round of mCherry fluorescence-activated FACS sorting and puromycin-resistant cell selection, over 90% cells are puromycin resistant and stably expressed mCherry.These cells are further propagated. After 10 passages, nearly 100% of cells of the 4 HBV cell lines persistently express mCherry and grow well in the presence of puromycin.Characterization of HBV-replicating stable cell linesImmunofluorescence of hepatitis B virus core antibodyCell preparationSeed 4 x 105 pTSMP-HBV1.3 cells and 3.5 x 105 parental HepG2 cells (serve as a negative control) on the cell imaging plate with a density of 70%.
