    "NOTE: All the buffers and the medium used in this protocol are listed in Table 1.\nDays 1 and 2\n1. Crosslinking the Cells\nTransfer the mouse T-cells from a 6-well plate to a 50 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C and ~271 x g. Resuspend the cell pellet in 30 mL of IMDM cell culture medium and count the cells using a Neubauer chamber.\nCollect aliquots of 20 x 106 cells into new 50 mL tubes.\nAdd formaldehyde (FMA) to a 1% final concentration directly to the cell culture medium and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n\tCaution: FMA is toxic if inhaled, so work under a fume hood and wear proper protective equipment. Also, please handle FMA waste according to the rules of the host institution.\nAdd a 1/8-volume of 1 M glycine, pH 7.0, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C and ~271 x g and wash with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nWash the cell pellet with 1 mL of PBS and transfer to 1.5 mL tubes.\n2. Cell Lysis and Chromatin Shearing\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of SDS lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nTransfer each sample to a sonication tube and perform shearing using a focused ultrasonicator according to the settings indicated in Table 2.\nAfter shearing, transfer the samples to 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C and ~18,000 x g.\nTransfer the supernatant to new tubes.\nCollect 50 µL to determine the shearing efficiency according to step 3 and snap-freeze the sheared lysate in liquid nitrogen. Store the lysate in single-use aliquots at -80 °C.\n3. Determination of Shearing Efficiency",
    "Add 50 µL of elution buffer to the 50 µL of each sheared lysate and incubate at 65 °C overnight, with shaking.\nAdd 100 µL of TE buffer and 4 µL of 10 mg/mL RNase A (0.2 µg/µL final concentration). Mix and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C, with shaking.\nAdd 2 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K (0.2 µg/µL final concentration) to each sample and incubate for 2 h at 55 °C, with shaking.\nTransfer each sample to a gel tube suitable for phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction; handle according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAdd 200 µL of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and shake the tubes. Centrifuge for 5 min at 24 °C and ~16,000 x g and transfer the upper phase to new tubes.\n\tCaution: Phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol are toxic if inhaled and are corrosive; work under a fume hood and wear proper personal protective equipment. Also, handle phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol waste according to the rules of the host institution.\n\t\nRepeat once.\nPurify the DNA by using purification columns according to the manufacturer's instruction, with the following modifications:\nWash the membrane twice. After the last wash, leave the tube open for 2 min at room temperature to evaporate the residual ethanol.\nFor the elution, add 50 µL of H2O, incubate at room temperature for 1 min, spin the tube for 1 s to properly wet the membrane, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min before eluting the DNA by centrifugation for 1 min at 24 °C and ~17,900 x g.\nQuantify the purified DNA on a fluorometer using a high-sensitivity kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAnalyze approximately 500 ng of the purified DNA on a 1.8% agarose gel and approximately 1 ng on an electrophoresis system using a high-sensitivity kit.",
    "NOTE: The expected size of the DNA fragments is between 200 and 500 bp.\nDays 3 and 4\n4. Immunoprecipitation\nDilute 1 volume of sheared lysate with 5 volumes of dilution buffer.\nPreclear with 30 µL/mL protein A agarose beads (prepared according to Appendix A) for 30 min while rotating in the cold room.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min at ~750 x g.\nCollect 10% of the input and store it at 4 °C.\nAliquot the desired amount of lysate into new tubes (see Table 3 for details). Add the desired antibodies to each tube (see Table 3 for details) and rotate overnight at 4 °C.\nAdd 40 µL of protein A beads and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C while rotating.\nWash the beads with 1 mL of low-salt buffer, high-salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and TE buffer (for each wash, incubate for 5 min at 4 °C while rotating and centrifuge for 3 min at 4 °C and ~950 x g). See Table 3 for details.\nAdd 110 µL of elution buffer and incubate for 15 min at room temperature, vortexing every 2 min.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 4 °C and ~950 x g and transfer 100 µL of supernatant to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nRepeat steps 4.7-4.8 with 100 µL of elution buffer and combine the eluates. Add elution buffer up to 200 µL to input the samples.\nIncubate all samples overnight at 65 °C, with shaking.\nDay 5\n5. DNA Purification\nAdd 200 µL of TE buffer to each eluate and 8 µL of 10 mg/mL RNase A (0.2 µg/µL final concentration). Mix and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C, with shaking.",
