    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection and fixation of Drosophila pupae\nTiming: approximately 2–5 days\nThe steps below describe how to collect and fix Drosophila pupae of the appropriate developmental stage, to investigate the role of different genes in the clearance of the larval salivary glands during metamorphosis.\nCollect white prepupae (WPP) from the side wall of a culture vial (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) using a pair of forceps and place them in a 35 mm petri dish lined with a piece of wet tissue paper (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/608-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. .Collecting and preparing pupae for fixation\n(A) White prepupa (WPP) (circle).\n(B) Collected WPP in a petri dish lined with wet tissue paper.\n(C) 24 h APF pupa (arrows indicate the position of the cuts).\n(D) 24 h APF pupa after the cuts have been made (arrows point to the cut sites).\nNote: New WPP form on the side wall of the culture vial every hour and can be collected multiple times each day.\nIncubate the WPP- containing petri dish in a 25°C incubator with a 16 h day/8 h night cycle for exactly 24 h.\nCritical: After 24 h of incubation, the animals should have transitioned from the pre-pupal to the pupal stage. Do not use animals that are still in the pre-pupal stage (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nUsing a pair of forceps, submerge a pupa in a concave slide containing PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nUsing a pair of dissecting scissors incise the pupal case first at the anterior end of the pupa and then at the posterior end (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPuncture the cuticle at the posterior end of the developing animal using the tip of the dissecting scissors or a needle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Critical: During the process, be careful not to severely damage the developing animal inside the pupal case. When puncturing the cuticle or when cutting the pupal case at the posterior end of the animal, a small amount of tissue might leak out of the cut. These pupae can still be used unless they have sustained excessive damage (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nTransfer the pupae to an Eppendorf tube with 500 μL of fixative solution.\nIncubate the pupae in fixative at 4°C for 48 h.\nPause Point: After step 7 the animals can be stored in the fixative solution for at least two weeks without any noticeable variation.\nNote: Collect at least 20 animals from each genotype/condition. The collection and fixation process can last several days. Animals of the same genotype/condition collected at different times/days can be added to the same tube.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Dissection of pupae for fixation, related to steps 3–5\nEmbedding Drosophila pupae in paraffin\nTiming: approximately 2 days\nThese steps describe the process of embedding the Drosophila pupae in paraffin.\nDiscard the fixative solution and add 500 μL of 80% ethanol to the pupae.\nRotate the pupae with ethanol on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 15 min.\nDiscard 80% ethanol and add 500 μL of 85% ethanol.\nRotate on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 20 min.\nDiscard 85% ethanol and add 500 μL of 90% ethanol.\nRotate on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 25 min.\nDiscard 90% ethanol and add 500 μL of 100% ethanol.\nRotate on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nDiscard 100% ethanol and add 500 μL of fresh 100% ethanol.\nRotate on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nRepeat steps 16 and 17 two additional times.",
    "Discard the 100% ethanol from the tube and add 500 μL of 100% xylene.\nRotate on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nDiscard 100% xylene and add 500 μL of fresh 100% xylene.\nRotate on a nutator at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nRepeat steps 21 and 22 two additional times.\nIn a 20 mL scintillation vial add:\n~1.8 g of paraffin chips, Paraplast X-tra (not melted).\n2 mL of 100% xylene.\nTransfer the pupae into a scintillation vial.\nNote: Add a maximum of 20 animals per vial. If more animals have been collected from one genotype/condition, split them into an appropriate number of vials.\nNote: Remember to melt enough paraffin in a 56°C incubator which will be used the next day.\nIncubate the pupae in a 42°C incubator for 16–20 h.\nDiscard the xylene/paraffin solution from the vial using a glass pipette.\nAdd an adequate amount of melted paraffin, enough to cover all of the pupae.\nIncubate the vial containing the pupae in a 56°C incubator for 2 h.\nReplace melted paraffin with fresh melted paraffin and incubate in a 56°C incubator for 2 h.\nRepeat step 30 two additional times.\nPause Point: The procedure can be paused for at least one week.\nFill the vial with melted paraffin.\nIncubate the vial in a 56°C incubator for at least 30 min.\nMake a mold using a 3\" × 5\" white unruled index card (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/608-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. .Orientation of the processed pupae into the molds for embedding in paraffin\n(A) Paper mold.\n(B) Animals oriented in the molds and labeled.\nCover the slide warmer with aluminum foil and pre-heat it to 56°C.\nPre-heat the mold on the slide warmer.\nQuickly pour the melted paraffin containing the pupae into the mold.",
    "Orient the pupae, using a toothpick, with their ventral side facing down (spiracles pointing up) and ensure that there is an adequate amount of space between them. This step is to be performed quickly before the paraffin begins to harden (~3 min) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Construction of paper mold for paraffin embedding, related to step 34\nNote: You can add a small piece of paper (i.e., a tag) with the genotype/condition corresponding to each mold. You can also position up to five animals, side by side, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nSwitch off the slide warmer and leave the molds containing the pupae to cool for 16–20 h.\nStore the paraffin blocks with the embedded pupae at 20°C–25°C.\nPause Point: The paraffin blocks can be stored at 20°C–25°C indefinitely.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Orientation of pupae in the paraffin mold, related to step 38\nSectioning of the embedded Drosophila pupae\nTiming: approximately 1 day\nHere we describe how to prepare the embedded animals for sectioning with a microtome. We also describe the key steps in the sectioning process.\nPeel away the paper mold from the hardened paraffin block (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/608-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. .Preparation of embedded animals for sectioning\n(A) Animals embedded in paraffin.\n(B) Small piece of paraffin that contains a group of animals.\n(C) Embedded animals mounted on microtome chucks.\n(D) Trimmed block of paraffin with pupae.\nCut the paraffin block into smaller, individual pyramid shaped blocks (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nMount a block on a microtome chuck by melting the paraffin on the bottom of the block and then letting it solidify on the microtome chuck (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Trim the blocks creating a truncated rectangular pyramid with only 0.5 mm of space surrounding the animals (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nCritical: Make sure the shape is a truncated rectangular pyramid to obtain a straight ribbon when sectioning (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nPlace a microscope slide onto a 42°C slide warmer and add distilled water on top of it (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Trimming of the paraffin blocks, related to step 44\nNote: Use a pencil or a chemical-resistant marker to label microscope slides.\nSection using a microtome at 7 μm thickness (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nFloat sections onto a microscope slide with water (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nLet the sections expand for 1–2 min (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nRemove the water from the slide using a paper towel along the side (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nLeave the slides on the 42°C slide warmer for 16–20 h (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S5. Tissue sectioning process, related to steps 45–50\nStaining and image acquisition\nTiming: approximately 4–6 h\nIn these steps we describe the process of staining the tissues on microscope slides.\nPlace the microscope slides into a slide rack (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/608-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. .Staining of the tissue sections\n(A) Containers with the solutions used during the staining procedure.\n(B) Plastic container with slides in the slide rack, under running water.\n(C) Slides with stained tissues after a coverslip has been mounted.\nRehydrate the tissue by incubating them sequentially in containers with the following solutions and time duration(s) under a chemical hood (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A):\n100% Xylene I for 3 min.\n100% Xylene II for 3 min.\n100% Ethanol I for 3 min.\n100% Ethanol II for 3 min.\n95% Ethanol I for 3 min.",
