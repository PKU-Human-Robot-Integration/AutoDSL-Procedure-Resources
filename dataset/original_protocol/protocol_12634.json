    "1. C. quinquefasciatus colony rearing\nSet up multiple colonies of C. quinquefasciatus adults in bug dorm cages.\n\tNOTE: The colonies were provided by Dr. Laura Harrington at Cornell University20. Detailed protocols for rearing Culex mosquitoes can be found in other literature21.\n\t\nMaintain the mosquitoes at 25 ± 1 ˚C at 30% humidity with a 12:12 h day:night cycle.\nProvide 20% sugar solution ad libitum by introducing a sugar solution container with a wick into the cage or by saturating cotton balls with the sugar solution and placing it within the cage.\nAllow mosquitoes to mate for at least 3 days prior to blood feeding (Figure 2A).\n2. Collection of C. quinquefasciatus pre-blastoderm stage embryos\nAfter 3-6 days post eclosion, provide females with 1-2 mL of a citrated bovine blood-meal through a synthetic membrane and heated to approximately 40 °C in a blood feeding system (Figure 2B). There are also alternative blood feeding protocols that can be used for Culex mosquitoes (e.g., see ref21).\n\tNOTE: C. quinquefasciatus is known for a preference for avian blood. Some labs use anesthetized live birds or avian blood for their blood meal source21,22,23. However, colonies can be trained/selected to feed on bovine blood or small rodents if this feature is selected for over multiple generations.\n\t\nAllow females to rest for a minimum of 3 days after blood feeding to undergo oogenesis and egg maturation before inducing oviposition for microinjection experiments.\nOn the day of embryonic microinjections, create an oviposition cup with organically infused oviposition water. Oviposition water should be made by fermenting rabbit feces (50 g/L), decomposing grass (4.5 g/L), or fish food (25 g/L) in water over the course of 5 or more days24,25.\nPlace the oviposition cup into the cage and place the entire cage into a dark location (Figure 2C).",
    "After every 30 min, check the cup for egg rafts.\n\t\nIf egg rafts are present, collect the rafts by scooping them with a paintbrush and place them on a wet filter paper (Figure 2D,E).\n3. Alignment of C. quinquefasciatus pre-blastoderm stage embryos\nSeparate the eggs from the rafts by pressing down on the raft and teasing apart the eggs individually using a fine tip paintbrush and forceps (Figure 2E).\nAlign individual eggs on a thin strip of double-sided sticky tape placed across the top of a glass slide (Figure 2F).\nWhile aligning, try to point the anterior side of each egg in the same direction for easier accessibility.\n\tNOTE: An alternative egg alignment method without double sided sticky tape can be found in a previously published Nasonia vitripennis embryo microinjection protocol26.\nCover eggs with the halocarbon oil mix.\n\tNOTE: Halocarbon mix can be prepared ahead of time by gently mixing two halocarbon reagents and water (9:1:20, halocarbon 700 : halocarbon 27 : Ultrapure water) and then incubating the mixture overnight at 25οC to facilitate water saturation of the halocarbon oil.\n4. Needle preparation for microinjections\nGenerate the aluminosilicate capillary glass needles using a glass micropipette puller.\n\t\nPlace an aluminosilicate capillary glass into a needle puller, as per instructions from the needle puller’s user manual.\n\t\tNOTE: Quartz and borosilicate capillary needles can also be used, but for this experiment, aluminosilicate is preferred because of its relative affordability and durability.\nSet Heat to 516, Velocity to 100, Delay to 70, Pull to 97, and Pressure to 500 on the needle puller.\nActivate the needle puller, as per the puller’s instructions and repeat as needed for additional needles.\n\t\tNOTE: During the injection process, needles often become clogged or accidentally broken, therefore, pulling additional needles for a single experiment is highly recommended.",
    "Bevel the needle tip by gently touching the tip of the pulled needle on the rotating diamond abrasive plate for around 10 s at a 50˚ angle.\n\tNOTE: Beveling the needle opens it to allow fluid to flow through while also creating a sharper tip for easier penetration into the embryo. An example of a proper needle can be seen in a previous article26.\nStore pulled and beveled needles by embedding them into lines of modeler’s clay in a Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: To ensure the best quality for needle tips, needles should be freshly pulled and beveled as close to the time of injection as possible.\n5. Loading the injection mixture\nPrepare the injection mixture consisting of genome modification reagents (e.g., 200 ng/μL sgRNA and 200 ng/μL Cas9 mixture), or preferred injection solutions and keep it on ice.\n\tNOTE: This mix can be prepared while waiting for eggs to be laid. More details on Cas9 and sgRNA production and preparation for microinjection can be found in previous publications27,28,29,30.\nLoad 2 μL of injection mixture into the injection needle using a microloader tip.\n6. Microinjection set up\nPlace the filled injection needle into a micromanipulator set up linked to an electronic microinjector.\nPlace the glass slide containing the aligned eggs on the stage of a compound microscope.\nUsing the micromanipulator and compound microscope, align the needle to aim at the posterior end of the embryo at a 25-35˚ angle.\n7. Embryo microinjection (Figure 2G)\nCarefully insert the needle into the embryo and inject the mixture at a quantity of about 10% of the volume of the embryo (700-800 pL depending on the size of the eggs).\n\tNOTE: When injecting, the egg should slightly swell, however, if too much fluid is injected, eggs may burst, or cytoplasmic fluid may leak out.",
    "Inject around 20 eggs at a time then stop and perform embryo recovery procedures.\n\tNOTE: While injecting, there is a high chance of needles to either clog or break. If a clog occurs, which can be determined by a lack of injection fluid flowing through the needle, try either cleaning out the needle with the clean function on the electronic microinjector or try re-beveling the needle. If neither step works, quickly change to a new needle while ensuring the prepared eggs remain moistened.\n8. Embryo recovery and hatching\nLeave the eggs undisturbed for at least 5 min. Within 20 min post-injection, carefully remove the halocarbon oil by brushing lightly with a clean paintbrush (Figure 2H).\nLift the eggs gently using a paintbrush and place them into a cup of double-distilled water (Figure 2I). Take care to keep the eggs on the surface of the water.\nCheck the eggs daily for 7 days for hatching (Figure 2J).\nFollow normal larval rearing procedures21.\n9. Screening for genome modification\nScreen the injected mosquitoes for the mutant phenotypes using a stereoscope (Figure 2K).\n\t\nVerify mutations that do not have an easily recognizable phenotype, by PCR amplification, T7 Endonuclease I assay, and sequencing by subcloning of the target region31.\nSet up additional crosses between injected individuals to detect heritable mutations within the germline."
