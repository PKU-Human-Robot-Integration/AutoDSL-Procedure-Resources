    "The influenza M1 and HA subunits and the functional mutant−encoding genes are designed in silico using a DNA cloning software of choice (i.e., VectorNTI, ApE, others). and are then inserted into transfer plasmids of choice called Donor and Acceptor (the MultiBac transfer plasmids available are listed in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl-0001] to be used based on the individual experimental design). In addition to HA, further influenza protein−encoding genes (NA, M2) can be likewise inserted, resulting in multivalent VLPs. Polycistronic expression cassettes can be prepared using a variety of different methods-total DNA synthesis, restriction/ligation cloning, ligation-independent cloning (LIC), sequence and ligation−independent cloning (SLIC), or Gibson cloning (Casini, Storch, Baldwin, & Ellis, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0013])-as described in detail previously (Benoit et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0007]; Celie, Parret, & Perrakis, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0014]). The technique used is entirely up to what the individual user feels most comfortable with. Given the recent decrease in costs incurred as a result of the competition among the commercial suppliers, we recommend using custom DNA synthesis (importantly including complete cassette sequencing also of promoters and terminators), which will make expression cassette construction easier and faster, in particular for generation of mutant arrays, as we carried out here for influenza HA.\nTable 1.\n                MultiBac Donor and Acceptor Plasmids\ntable:\n﻿Vector names,Host strain,Replicon,Recombination and multiplication sides,Antibiotic resistance genes (1000× stock concentration)\nAcceptor plasmids,Acceptor plasmids,Acceptor plasmids,Acceptor plasmids,Acceptor plasmids\npFL,TOP10a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl1-note-0001_68],ColE1,\"Tn7L, Tn7R, loxP, multiplication module M\",Ampicillin (100 mg/ml) Gentamycin (10 mg/ml)\npKL,TOP10,pBR322,\"Tn7L, Tn7R, loxP, multiplication module M\",Kanamycin (50 mg/ml) Gentamycin (10 mg/ml)\nDonor plasmids,Donor plasmids,Donor plasmids,Donor plasmids,Donor plasmids\npUCDM,BW23474b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl1-note-0002_69],R6Kγ,\"loxP, multiplication module M\",Chloramphenicol (30 mg/ml)\npSPL,BW23474,R6Kγ,\"loxP, multiplication module M\",Spectinomycin (50 mg/ml)\nOther plasmids,Other plasmids,Other plasmids,Other plasmids,Other plasmids\nMultiBac bacmid,DH10MultiBac DH10MultiBacCre,F1,\"Tn7L, Tn7R, loxP\",Kanamycin (50 mg/ml) Ampicillin (100 mg/ml)\npBADZ-HisCre,TOP10 DH10MultiBacCre,ColE1,,Zeomycin (50 mg/ml) (Zeocin)\na recA- endA- pir- other cloning strains can be used here as well.",
    "b recA- endA- pir+ other pir gene expressing strains can be used here as well.\nIn this protocol, the plasmid used is created by custom gene synthesis for DNA encoding M1 from H1N1 influenza virus and hemagglutinin derived from both H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viral strains. We have also used commercial mutagenesis services to insert carefully planned potential immune-modulating mutations into the hemagglutinin encoding genes.\nIn the in silico design step, it is important to eliminate internal restriction sites, as this can be important for subcloning into the MultiBac plasmids when we need to insert any other proteins such as NA and M2, or glycosylases to modulate the sugar structure of the heterologous proteins (Palmberger & Rendic, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0045]; Palmberger et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0047]; Palmberger et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0046]) for our parallelized expression experiment set-up.\nCodon optimization is another key point to be applied for best expression results of the gene(s) of interest in insect cells, which is done via the web-based algorithms offered by most of the synthetic DNA suppliers (e.g., http://www.idtdna.com/CodonOpt[href=http://www.idtdna.com/CodonOpt]; or OptimumGene™, from http://www.genscript.com[href=http://www.genscript.com]), typically free of charge. This procedure will also eliminate potentially harmful RNA secondary structure elements in the transcripts.\nIn this section, MultiBac based VLP-factory™ production will be described. First, the preparation of baculoviral genome for the expression of virus-like particles with the genes inserted into viral backbone encoding M1 from H1N1 influenza strain and mCherry fluorescent protein for monitoring virus performance and VLP production is detailed. Then, transformation into DH10MultiBac cells comprising the MultiBac baculoviral genome is described, and finally DH10VLP-factory™ cells are prepared.\nAll reagents are prepared using ultrapure water (Millipore Milli-Q system or equivalent; conductivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25°C) and analytical grade reagents.

    "1. Insert the genes encoding influenza H1N1 M1 protein (GenBank ID ABD59883.1) and fluorescent protein mCherry (GenBank ID ANO45948.1) into the multiple cloning sites MCS1 and MCS2 of plasmid pUCDM (Fitzgerald et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0025]) under polh and p10 promoter control, respectively, for generating pUCDM-M1-mCherry. Use generic restriction enzyme/ligation-based cloning or ligation-independent methods (Casini et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0013]; Haffke et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0031]) according to user preference.\n2. Transform pUCDM-M1-mCherry into pir+ E.coli cells expressing the pir gene product on which propagation of pUCDM-based ‘Donor’ plasmids depend (e.g., PIR1 and PIR2 from Invitrogen) due to their conditional origin of replication (Fitzgerald et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0025], Metcalf, Jiang, & Wanner, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0038]). Plate the transformed cells on LB agar plates (100 × 15 mm size) containing 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol, and incubate at 37°C overnight. Use single colonies from this plate to inoculate 25 ml bacterial culture Luria Broth (LB) medium for growing cells and preparing pUCDM-M1-mCherry (Fitzgerald et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0025]).\n3. Prepare 1 µg of pure pUCDM-M1-mCherry plasmid by using the QIAquick plasmid purification kit, following the standard plasmid preparation procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n4. Prepare DH10MultiBacCre chemical competent cells containing the MultiBac baculoviral genome and expressing Cre recombinase enzyme (which catalyzes an in vitro Cre-LoxP reaction for fusing Donor and Acceptor plasmids via their LoxP sites) according to on published procedures (Berger et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0008]). Briefly:\n         \nGrow cells in 500 ml sterile LB medium to an OD600 of 0.5-0.6 from an overnight culture.\nCentrifuge the cells 10 min at 3000 × g, 4°C. Resuspend and wash twice, each time with 100 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M CaCl2 at 4°C. Resuspend the final pellet in 5.6 ml of ice cold 0.1 M CaCl2 and 2.4 ml of ice-cold sterile 80% glycerol. Keep everything at 4°C.",
    "Make 100-µl aliquots, flash freeze cells in liquid nitrogen, and finally store at −80°C.\n5. Transform pUCDM-M1-mCherry plasmid into DH10MultiBacCre cells by using a standard salt-dependent transformation protocol. Briefly:\n         \nAdd 500 ng to 1 µg of the plasmid to the competent cells and incubate on ice for 10-15 min.\nSubject cells to a heat shock at 42°C for 45-60 s, and then incubate on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 400-500 µl of medium (LB, TB, or SOC) and recover for 4-6 hr or overnight at 37°C.\nPlate the cells on LB agar plates containing 10 µg/ml tetracycline, 50 µg/ml kanamycin, and 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol antibiotics, 1 mM IPTG, and 100 µg/ml BluOGal color reagent. Incubate at 37°C overnight.\nSeveral blue colonies should grow on the plate.\n6. Select a single blue colony for bacterial culture growth by inoculating it in 4-5 ml of LB medium. Prepare competent cells and store flash-frozen (liquid nitrogen) in aliquots at −80°C as described in step 4.\nThese are the DH10 VLP-factory™ cells containing the MultiBac-based VLP-factory baculoviral genome (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0001]).\n7. Prepare VLP-factory V0 virus from a frozen aliquot according to published protocol (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0005] in Current Protocols article Bieniossek et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0012]). Briefly:\n         \nFirst grow an overnight culture from a frozen cell aliquot from step 6 in 2-3 ml of LB medium at 37°C shaker.",
    "On the next day, spin the cells 10 min at 3000 × g, room temperature. By applying the QIAquick plasmid purification kit, the pellet is used to prepare bacmid. Firstly, add 300 µl P1 buffer onto the pellet and pipette the mixture up and down to resuspend it. Then, transfer the mixture into a new 1.5-ml tube and add 300 µl P2 buffer. Gently invert the tube until the mixture is homogenous, but do not incubate more than 5 min. Add 300 µl N3 buffer to the tube, and a white precipitate would appear at this stage. Invert the tube again gently and then spin it 10 min at 17,000 × g, room temperature. Carefully transfer the supernatant into a fresh tube and spin again for 5 min at 17,000 × g, room temperature.\nTransfer the supernatant into a fresh tube, add 700 µl of isopropanol, and mix gently to homogenize. Spin 10 min at 17,000 × g, room temperature. There will be a small DNA pellet at the bottom; remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Add 200 µl of 70% ethanol to the tube carefully, spin 5 min at 17,000 × g, room temperature, and remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Add 50 µl of 70% ethanol and bring the tube into the sterile hood.\nRemove the ethanol and let pellet dry. Add 2 ml insect cell medium to 5 wells in a 6-well culture plate and 3 ml insect cell medium to the last well to keep it as a cell control. Add 0.5-1.0 million Sf21 cells in 1 ml volume to the wells drop by drop, evenly, except the cell control well, which will only have medium.",
    "Sf21 cells should be used from the batch that have been monitored for 2-3 days before the infection in terms of showing a healthy profile for cell growth. These cells must be maintained daily with a fresh insect cell medium to keep the cell density in the flask ideally in between 0.5 and 1 × 106 cells/ml to ensure optimal growth conditions.\nAdd 30 µl of sterile MilliQ water to the pellet and resuspend the DNA by gently tapping the bottom of the tube. Transfer 10 µl into a fresh tube to check it on an agarose gel (see Current Protocols article: Voytas, 2000). Add 200 µl of insect cell medium to the remaining 20 µl.\nIn a separate fresh tube, add 100 µl of insect cell medium to 10 µl of transfection reagent and mix, then add 100 of this mix to the tube containing the DNA/medium mix from step 7e. Mix gently and add 150 µl of the mix drop-by-drop to two wells of the plate with insect cells. Incubate at 26°C for 48-60 hr without shaking. Cells that are infected with VLP-factory™ virus will get bigger in size and will turn brightly red due to mCherry expression. Collect the V0 virus in sterile 15-ml Falcon tubes.",
    "Here, DH10VLP-factory™ cells containing baculoviral genome will be transformed with the transfer plasmid array consisting of wild-type and mutant influenza HA protein-encoding genes. Hence, we will have the VLP variants expressed in insect cells that we can visually follow by means of the red color change in the shaker flasks.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0001])\nAn empty Acceptor plasmid for the insertion of genes encoding wild type and mutant influenza HA protein via multiple cloning sites (Fitzgerald et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0025])\nErlenmeyer shaker flasks, 250 ml\n1.

Transform DH10VLP-factory™ aliquots with transfer plasmids encoding the array made up of wild-type and mutant influenza HA proteins by using standard a salt-dependent transformation protocol. Next, plate the cells on agar containing kanamycin, gentamycin, tetracycline, IPTG, and BluOGal.\nRefer to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0001], step 5, substeps a-d for the above procedures.\n3. Pick a single white colony from each transformation and prepare composite VLP-factory™ bacmids. Use these bacmids to infect insect cells in 6-well plates and generate V0 initial virus.\nThe bacmid preparation and V0 initial virus production is done as in step 7 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0001].\nAlready at this early V0 stage in 6-well plates, composite VLP-factory™ produces clones stained bright red (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0003]) from mCherry expression.",
    "In case the agar plates are aged (agar plates which were prepared more than a week ago as a big batch and stored at 4˚C) or there are many colonies on the plate, we suggest waiting an extra day to observe full blue/white color development, to eliminate false positive selections.\n4. Harvest the VLP-factory™ V0 viruses producing influenza VLPs after 48-60 hr. Amplify to produce V1 virus by adding V0 viruses to 250-ml shaker flasks containing 50 ml insect cell culture (Bieniossek et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0012]). Cell cultures turn red starting from 24-48 hr post infection. Collect the V1 virus at 24 hr post infection.\nWe have produced and processed batches of 25 different VLP array members at a time via this approach, to be able to control logistics. In the high-throughput approaches to culturing insect cells, parallel processing of many more specimens at the same time in smaller volumes in a table-top multi-fermenter is possible following established robotics protocols that we developed (Monteiro, Bernal, Chaillet, Berger, & Alves, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0039]).",

    "The comparison of primary sequences from adenovirus serotypes revealed that two regions in the penton base protein comprise high variability in amino acid sequence and length. These are the variable loop (VL) and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) loop. The RGD loop is characterized by a conserved tripeptide motif (-RGD-) that regulates integrin-based penetration of the adenovirus into target cells (Gout, Schoehn, Fenel, Lortat-Jacob, & Fender, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0030]).\nThe low conservation of the VL and RGD loops suggests that one or many antigenic epitopes can be inserted into these regions of the penton base protein. Starting from the Ad3 adenovirus serotype, we thus set out to design a synthetic gene in a “BioBrick” format (Shetty, Endy, & Knight, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0056]) providing multiple easily accessible insertion loci for generating protomers comprising epitope sequences or even small protein domains in the VL and RGD loops, optionally in a library format (Vragniau et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0065]). The crystal structure of the Ad3 protomer (Szolajska et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0057]) provided guidance for the proper design of the loci based on the secondary structure motifs flanking the loop regions.\nThe RGD loop in wild-type Ad3 is significantly larger than the VL, and the RGD motif is critical for cell internalization. We therefore elected to maintain the RGD motif and introduce two insertion loci, before and after the RGD tripeptide motif, respectively. Together with one locus in the VL, we thus engineered our ADDomer© plug-and-play multiepitope display platform comprising three independent epitope insertion sites.",
    "For high-level expression of ADDomer©, we implemented the MultiBac system (Sari et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0053]; Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0006]), preparing a pACEBac-ADDomer plasmid (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl-0001]) as a generic starting point for all epitope insertions exploiting this scaffold (selected examples shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl-0002]). ADDomer© was expressed with excellent yield (∼1 g ADDomer from 1 liter of insect cell culture). Quality control of the MultiBac-produced ADDomer© sample evidenced negligible nucleic acid or endotoxin contamination (Vragniau et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0065]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d6e98d09-dda7-460f-a727-480dbcd700ba/cpz155-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nADDomer© VLP production.

    "8. Prepare a continuous sucrose gradient by mixing 15% and 40% (w/v) sucrose solutions made in PBS with Gradient Master 107. Clarify lysate from debris via centrifugation for 30 min at 6000 × g, 4°C, prior to subjecting the cleared supernatant to a continuous sucrose gradient (15% to 40%) centrifugation (Fender, Ruigrok, Gout, Buffet, & Chroboczek, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0024]). Load the lysate on the gradient and ultracentrifuge for 18 hr in Beckman SW 41 rotor at 287,472 × g, 4°C.\n9. Combine ADDomer-containing fractions as identified by SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions (see Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0029]), which migrate in the gradient at about 30% to 40% sucrose. Dialyze (see Current Protocols article: Phillips & Signs, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0048]) the combined fractions against purification buffer using a 6-8 kDa MWCO dialysis at 4°C overnight.\n10. Further purify ADDomer by ion-exchange chromatography via a High Q column (Bio-Rad) with 50 mM NaCl purification buffer and applying a linear salt gradient from 50 to 500 mM NaCl purification buffer. Equilibrate the column prior to applying ADDomer with 5 column volumes of purification buffer containing 50 mM NaCl.\n11. Identify fractions containing purified ADDomer by tracking absorbance at 280 nm and analyzing fractions by SDS-PAGE (Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0029]) These fractions elute between 330 and 400 mM NaCl, which can be conveniently traced by monitoring conductance. Pool fractions comprising ADDomer and store at ambient temperature or frozen (−80°C).\n12. Purify additional ADDomer variants of choice designed in step 1 according to the same protocol (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0006]). Choose the number of ADDomer variants you wish to purify depending on the availability of the purification equipment in your laboratory and the level of automation.",
    "Infectious diseases continue to constitute major global challenges, forcefully evidenced most recently by the SARS 2 coronavirus outbreak that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, wreaking havoc world-wide. Vaccination is uniquely suited to overcome these serious threats. Pre-COVID-19, Zika and Chikungunya virus infectious diseases, which are transmitted by mosquitoes, were causing alarm. Originally confined to sub-Saharan Africa, these diseases are increasingly spreading to the Northern Hemisphere, accelerated by deforestation and global warming. In the Chikungunya virus, the E2EP3 linear peptide has been identified as the major neutralizing epitope, with specific antibodies present in the majority of patients (Kam et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0034]). The E2EP3 neutralizing epitope is located at the N terminus of the viral E2 glycoprotein, including the first 18 amino acids starting from N-terminal serine (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0007] and Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl-0002]). pACEBac-ADDomer is used as a backbone in this protocol for inserting DNA encoding for this E2EP3 epitope. The steps described in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0004] for purification of the vaccine candidate are used in this protocol.\nMaterials\npACEBac-ADDomer (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0004], step 4)\nE2EP3 neutralizing epitope peptide (see Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0007] and Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-tbl-0002])\nDH10EMBacY cells (Geneva Biotech SARL, Switzerland)\nHi5 insect cells\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\nEDTA-free complete protease inhibitor (Roche, Switzerland)\nHigh Q column (Bio-Rad)\n1. Insert E2EP3 into ADDomer© to create ADDomer-tevCHIK VLP vaccine candidate to combat Chikungunya infectious disease (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0004] steps 1-4).\n2. Apply steps 5-12 of Basic Protocol 4 here to purify the Chikungunya vaccine candidate, by using the plasmid generated in step 1 of Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-prot-0005] instead of pACEBac-ADDomer.\n3. At the N-terminus of E2EP3 in ADDomer©, a site for a highly specific protease [tobacco etch virus (TEV) NIa] is included preceding the epitope. Thus, upon cleavage, generate a native-like conformation comprising an exposed N-terminal serine.",
    "Of note, negative-stain EM analysis confirmed that the ADDomer dodecahedron stayed intact in spite of 60-fold cleavage by TEV (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-fig-0008]; Vragniau et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0065]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/334cc63b-2e02-47b1-926e-502534c00130/cpz155-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nNative-like peptide epitope presentation on ADDomer-tevCHIK. Chikungunya envelope protein E2 consisting of three domains is shown (A, B, and C). E2EP3 (comprises the N-terminus of E2 with the amino acid sequence NH2-STDKDNFNVYKATRPYLAH). This E2E3P peptide, the major neutralizing epitope in the Chikungunya virus, is presented in an exposed native-like conformation in ADDomer-tevCHIK, with native-like meaning that the N-terminal serine residue of the epitope is accessible exactly as is the case in the Chikungunya viral envelope protein containing the major neutralizing epitope E2EP3. The N-terminus was liberated by TEV protease cleavage at a specific site as indicated.\n4. Our approach is validated with immunization experiments. Sera of mice injected with uncut ADDomer-tevCHIK did not yield E2EP3-specific immunoglobulin titers when assayed against synthetic E2EP3 peptides in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Vragniau et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.55#cpz155-bib-0065]). In contrast, TEV NIa quantitatively cleaved ADDomer-tevCHIK, exposing native-like E2EP3 that elicited a very strong specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) response in ELISA when injected into mice, in agreement with the immune reaction that is observed in patients after Chikungunya viral infection.\n5. An unrelated nanoparticle scaffold made of polylactic acid fused to a similar amount of E2EP3 peptide epitopes did not elicit a comparable immune response, indicating that the ADDomer© scaffold itself may have an adjuvating effect."
