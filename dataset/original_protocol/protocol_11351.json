    "Please note that all the mouse experiments described here were approved and performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Tsinghua University.\n1. Generation of DR3 Overexpression Cell Lines\nConstruct the plasmid for DR3 expression (pMXs-IRES-DR3-FLAG) by inserting full-length DR3 cDNA with 3x FLAG at the C-terminus into retroviral vector pMXs-IRES-Blasticidin at the restriction sites of BamHI/XhoI.\nGrow Plat-A cells in 60 mm dishes with 4 mL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). The next day, when the cells reach 80% - 90% confluence, transfect the cells with 2 μg of plasmid pMXs-IRES-DR3-FLAG using transfection reagent (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s manual20.\nAfter 72 h, collect the supernatant, filtrate the media using a 0.45 μm sterile filter, and keep the viral suspension in the dark at 4 °C.\nGrow HT29 cells in DMEM in a 60 mm dish and incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nThe next day, when the cells reach 30% - 50% confluence, infect the cells with 2 mL of viral suspension in the presence of 8 μg of 1,5-Dimethyl-1,5-diazaundecamethylene polymethobromide per milliliter of viral suspension. After 4 - 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, aspirate the viral suspension, add 4 mL of fresh DMEM, and return the dish to the incubator.\nDiscard the media from the dishes 24 h postinfection and carefully wash cells with 2 mL of prewarmed PBS. Add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.",
    "After observing under a microscope at 10X magnification that most of the cells have detached, stop the trypsinization with 2 mL of complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Collect the cell suspension in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of DMEM. Mix well by gently pipetting up and down. Dilute the cells by factors of 30, 100, and 300. Seed the cells in 150 mm dishes with 20 mL of DMEM containing 1 µg/mL blasticidin. Incubate at a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for ~1 - 2 weeks.\nDuring this period, observe the colonies every day with an inverted microscope at 10X magnification. Mark the well-isolated colonies at the bottom of the dish when the colony diameter is about 1 - 2 mm.\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells with 3 mL of pre-warmed PBS. Add 2 milliliters of trypsin-EDTA in a 60 mm dish. Use sterile forceps to pick up autoclaved sterile cloning cylinders, and place them in the 60 mm dish. Pick up the cylinders containing trypsin-EDTA and gently place them over the marked colonies. Make sure every cloning cylinder only contains one colony and avoid contamination with nearby colonies.\nReturn the dish to the incubator for 3 minutes.\nAfter 3 min, check the cells under the microscope at 10X magnification to see whether they have detached. When the cells have lifted up, add 70 μL of culture medium to each cylinder to inactivate the trypsin. Gently mix the cell suspension with a 200 μL pipette. Make sure not to move the cylinder during this process.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension from each colony to two 24-well plates containing 1 mL of DMEM per well. Add 30 μL of cell suspension per well in plate A and 70 μL in the corresponding wells in plate B. Label the plates properly and put them back in the incubator.\n2. Verification of the DR3 Overexpression Cell Line\nWhen the cells in plate B are at 90% confluence, remove the media and carefully wash the cells with 1 mL of PBS. Completely remove PBS and lyse the cells with 50 μL of 1x SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Transfer the cell lysates from the 24-well plate to 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and boil the samples for 10 min at 100 °C.\nRun the samples on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel at a constant voltage of 80 V for 15 min and, then, at 120 V for 1 h.\nTransfer the protein to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane by wet transfer at a constant current of 400 mA for 2 h.\nTest the DR3 expression in different clones with anti-FLAG antibody, using the wild-type HT29 cells as a negative control (Figure 1). Dilute the primary antibody by a factor of 5,000 in 5% nonfat milk that is dissolved in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20). Incubate the membrane with FLAG antibody at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the membrane with TBST by shaking it on a decoloring shaker at 200 rpm at RT. Refresh the TBST every 5 min for a total washing time of 15 min.\nIncubate the membrane with anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted by a factor of 10,000 in 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C for 5-6 h.\nWash the membrane again as described in step 2.5.",
    "Detect the FLAG expression using western enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate and image the membrane with a gel documentation system (see Table of Materials). Identify the clones expressing DR3 as the positive clones.\nTransfer the clones in plate A that correspond to positive clones in plate B to a 6-well plate and continue to amplify the cells until growing them in 10 cm dishes. Make frozen stocks of the cells growing from positive clones and store them at -80 °C for future use.\n3. Assessment of the Apoptotic Response of Cells to Antimitotic Agents\nNOTE: Diazonamide is a new class of marine natural product that has remarkable activity in inhibiting cancer cell growth, which mirrors other tubulin-destabilizing agents21. However, its mode of action remains unclear. To test the cellular response of cells to antimitotic agents, paclitaxel and diazonamide were used to treat wild-type HT29 cells and HT29-DR3 cells. The drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make 10 mM stocks and, then, further diluted to different concentrations: 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, 1,000 nM, 3,000 nM, and 10,000 nM in DMSO.\nCollect HT29 and HT29-DR3 cells by trypsinization. Measure the cell density using an automatic cell counter. Then, seed the cells in 12-well plates in DMEM at a density of 3 x 104 cells per well. The next day, add 10 nM diazonamide and use 1% DMSO as a negative control. After 48 h of treatment, image the cells under a microscope at 10X magnification (Figure 2).",
    "Seed HT29 and HT29-DR3 cells in 96-well plates in DMEM at a density of 3 x 103 cells per well and allow them to grow overnight at 37 °C. Then, add dose-escalating diazonamide concentrations of 0.3 nM, 1 nM, 3 nM, 10 nM, 30 nM, and 100 nM to each well, using 1% DMSO as a negative control.\nAfter 48 h of treatment, measure the cell viability using a luminescence-based cell viability assay kit according to the manufacturer’s manual.\n\t\nTake out the 96-well plate from the incubator and let it stand at RT for approximately 30 min. Then, add 50 µL of assay reagents to each well, shake the plate at RT for 2 min to lyse the cells, and incubate the plate at RT for another 10 min. Determine the luminescence of each well using a microplate reader (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: The cell viability represents the relative luminescence intensity of each well to that of the control well treated with 1% DMSO.\nUse six-weeks-old female BALB/c nude mice for an in vivo study14.\n\tNOTE: The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions.\n\t\nTrypsinize HT29 and HT29-DR3 cell and, then, stop the trypsinization using DMEM prewarmed at 37 °C. Collect the cell suspension in a 50 mL tube and centrifuge the cells at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in DMEM medium without FBS. Centrifuge the cells again and resuspend the cell pellet in PBS.\nCount the cells using an automatic cell counter and dilute the cells to a concentration of 2.5 x 107 cells/mL using PBS. Generate tumors through a subcutaneous injection of 200 μL of the HT29 or HT29-DR3 cell suspension in the right flank of each mouse (5 x 106 cells/mouse)22.",
    "Measure the tumor volume (TV) using calipers every 2 d after the transplantation. Calculate the TV using the following formula: TV = 1/2L x W x W (here, W: tumor width, L: tumor length). When the average tumor volume reaches about 100 mm3, randomize the mice into either the control or the treated group (n = 6 per group) and initiate the treatment.\nPrepare the paclitaxel solution as follows. First, dissolve paclitaxel completely in ethanol at 5% of the total volume and, then, add 5% of the final volume of polyoxyl 35 hydrogenated castor oil. Finally, make up the remaining 90% of the volume with D5W (5% dextrose in water, pH 7.4).\nInject the paclitaxel intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg 3x per week for two weeks. Measure the tumor volume and body weight 3x a week14. Terminate the experiment and euthanize the animals if the body weight decreases by 20% or the tumor volume reaches about 2,000 mm3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
