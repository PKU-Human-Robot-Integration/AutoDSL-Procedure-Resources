    "The use of human tissue was approved by the ethics committee of the Ludwig-Maximillian University [Munich, Germany (project number 455-12)]. Tumor-free human lung resections were provided by the Asklepios Biobank for Lung Diseases (Gauting, Germany, project number 333-10).\nNOTE: All procedures of human PCLS production (Figure 1) are done under a sterile laminar flow hood.\n1. Preparation of Instruments and Materials\nPrepare all materials for the inflation of lung tissue with agarose as described below.\nPrepare the cultivation medium: Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) F-12 supplemented with L-Glutamine, HEPES, 10,000 IE Penicillin, 10,000 IE Streptomycin and 0.1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum.\nNOTE: Medium is used at 37 °C.\nPrepare a sterile metal tray covered with tissue paper. Place a sterile 15 cm cell culture dish on the tray.\nFill the cell culture dish with the 15 mL of cultivation medium.\nPrepare a 3% (w/v) agarose solution by dissolving the appropriate amount of low-melting point agarose in a minimum of 30 mL of cultivation medium.\nHeat the solution in a microwave until boiling. Cool the agarose solution to 42 °C in a water bath. Keep the liquid agarose solution stored in the water bath.\nPrepare several 50 mL conical tubes filled with the liquid agarose.\n2. Resected Lung Tissue\nStore fresh tumor free lung tissue of lobectomy resectates immediately after resection in DMEM F-12 medium at 4 °C until step 3.\nDo not exceed cold ischemia time of 4-8 h prior to processing.\n3. Inspection and Selection of Resected Tissue Prior to Agarose Filling\nLift the tissue from the medium with tweezers. In order to avoid any damage to the tissue, especially to the pleura, handle the tissue with tweezers at the airways only.\nScore the tissue quality by criteria of the Lung Agarose Filling Score defined in Table 1.",
    "Proceed to step 4 if the tissue’s quality is scored above or equal to 72. If the tissue’s quality is scored below 60, do not continue further with agarose filling.\nNOTE: If the tissue score is between 60 and 68, the agarose-filling and tissue slicing still might produce reasonable results, and a final decision for prolongation of the experiment has to be made case to case. However, lung tissue that did not meet the above-mentioned requirements, mostly fails in agarose filling.\n4. Lung Tissue Inflation by Agarose Filling\nLift the tissue from the storage medium and drain excess media from the tissue. Transfer the lung tissue into the 15 cm culture dish prepared in 1.1.2.\nFill a 30 mL syringe with the low-melting point agarose from 1.1.3.\nPrepare a peripheral venous catheter by removing the obturator and attach it to a 30 mL syringe\nIdentify a bronchus (0.5-3 mm in diameter) in the tissue that is ventilating an intact section of the tissue (see Figure 2).\nInsert the cannula into the selected bronchus (0.5-3 mm diameter).\nGently push the cannula gently forward as far as possible.\nSeal the bronchus around the cannula by compressing the bronchial wall around the cannula with forceps, ideally clamping any adjacent pulmonary artery at the same time.\nOcclude other additional airways with a surgical clamp to prevent agarose leaking through these airways.\nLift the tissue with the forceps from the culture dish.\nManually pour the agarose with the syringe no faster than 0.3 mL/s. The speed of agarose filling might vary between approximately 0.05 and 0.3 mL/s due to the heterogeneous resistance of airways and/or atelectasis.\nIf high resistance while filling or agarose leaking from the tissue is observed, retry the whole procedure with a different bronchus from step 4.4. Perform troubleshooting as described below.",
    "NOTE: The degree of agarose filling is highly dependent on the position of the catheter in the tissue and deep penetration of the catheter results in agarose filling of small cone like regions (*) of the lung tissue (Figure 2C).\n\t\nIn case of high resistance, try positioning of the catheter leads to proper filling of most regions of the tissue (#) (Figure 2D).\nAs plugs of early solidified agarose in the proximal bronchi or other airway obstructions (arrow) can lead to an incomplete filling of the tissue (Figure 2E), do not force agarose filling as this might lead to defects in the filled area, but not in a filling of the obstructed tissue parts.\nIf the respiratory tree derived from the cannulated bronchus is damaged during resection and the agarose filling results in a constant leaking of the liquid agarose (arrow in Figure 2F), insert the catheter into a more peripheral part of the airway system to fill at least a minor part of the tissue (*) (Figure 2G). Additionally, seal the damaged peripheral airway with a surgical clamp (arrow) (Figure 2H).\nApply agarose until the lung tissue is filled completely. Do not over-inflate the tissue as this may cause irreversible damage to the tissue structure and its cells.\nClamp the bronchus that was used for the filling immediately. Remove the cannula prior to clamping.\nIncubate the tissue in the culture medium at 4 °C for 30 min to ensure agarose solidification.\nIf the resected tissue has multiple bronchial entries, repeat step 4.2 to 4.13 until all parts of tissue are filled with agarose.\nStore the agarose filled lung tissue sections in 4 °C cold medium until slicing.\n5. Precision-cut Lung Slicing",
    "Identify regions in the lung tissue that are solidly filled with the agarose. Solidly filled regions will not collapse when they are gently pressed with tweezers against the bottom of the cell culture dish.\nExcise a 1-1.5 cm3 block of regions described in 5.1, whereas one side still should be covered with pleura.\nAttach each individual tissue block with the pleural side contacting the holder of the vibratome by using a cyanoacrylate glue.\nNOTE: The pleura is slightly elastic and therefore impedes the cutting with the vibratome blade. Placed on the tissue holder, the pleura will not interfere with the cutting and, importantly, forms a natural barrier between the cyanoacrylate glue and the tissue’s parenchyma allowing for minimal diffusion of the glue.\nSlice the lung tissue with the vibratome with the following settings: thickness: 500 µm, frequency: 100 Hz, amplitude of the knife: 1.2 mm, forward speed of the blade of 3-12 µm/s, which depends on tissue stiffness. Reduce the protrusion-speed of the blade if the slice is not cut properly, or if the tissue block itself starts to vibrate.\nGently transfer the slice by lifting it with forceps from the vibratome tray into a well of a 12-well plate filled with cultivation medium. Finally, incubate the lung slices in an incubator under standard cell culture conditions.\nStop slicing when 2-3 mm of the tissue block are left unsliced since the cyanoacrylate glue may have compromised the tissue integrity of this region.\n6. Generation of PCLS Punches\nTransfer the lung slices from a single well to an empty 10 cm dish.\nPlace a 4 mm biopsy puncher orthogonally to the upper surface of a PCLS and start to move the puncher in clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.",
    "Fill cell culture medium into the wells of a 96-well plate. Lift the tissue punches with forceps and transfer the punches into the wells of a 96-well plate. Finally, incubate the lung punches submerged in the medium prepared in 1.1.1. in a cell culture incubator under standard conditions (21% (v/v) oxygen, 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide and 95% humidity, at 37 °C).\n7. Tissue Culture and Sample Harvesting\nCulture the PCLS and punches overnight in an incubator under standard cell culture conditions.\nCulture PCLS and punches under outlined condition for a maximum of 120 hours after their generation to ensure cellular viability and function.\nFor harvesting protein as well as RNA, wash PCLS and punches three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), transfer them into cryovials and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nSample medium supernatant of cultured PCLS punches for the analysis of secreted proteins.\nFor histological analyses, wash the PCLS and punches three times with PBS and fix them with 4% paraformaldehyde by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, store the PCLS in PBS at 4 °C for further downstream staining."
