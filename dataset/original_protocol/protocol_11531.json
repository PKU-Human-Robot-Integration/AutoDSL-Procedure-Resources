    "Ethics Statement: Patient-derived colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor specimens were obtained from consenting patients at the University of Colorado Hospital in accordance with a protocol approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (08-0439). All animal work was performed under animal protocols approved by the University of Colorado Denver Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, Protocol # 51412(06)1E and 96813(04)1E).\n1. Receiving and Preparing Patient Blood\nCollect 1 - 2 ml of blood in a blood/cell separation tube containing sodium citrate (tube phases included are plasma, lymphocyte and monocyte band, density gradient fluid, gel barrier, and erythrocytes and neutrophils). Caution, follow Blood Borne Pathogen guidelines with blood or tissue.\n\tNote: PBMCs and plasma could be used for future studies that may include: comparing germline genetic variation with tumor mutations, isolating circulating tumor cells, evaluating cell free DNA (cfDNA), examining proteins and microRNAs, etc.\nCentrifuge the blood/cell separation tube at 2,500 x g for 15 min with no brake at RT.\nCollect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs in lymphocyte and monocyte band of tube) and put into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (clear, autoclavable, DNase, RNase, and pyrogen free), and fill to the top of the tube with sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS).\n\t\nCentrifuge at 2,300 x g for 3 min at RT to form a pellet of PBMCs at the bottom of the tube. Next, remove the supernatant carefully. Add 1 ml of sterile PBS to wash the pellet and centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 30 sec and then remove supernatant.\nUse a pipette to collect plasma from the blood/cell separation tube (in plasma phase of tube) in a 1.5 ml sterile cryogenic vial (DNase and RNase free, no human DNA, endotoxin free) and put the plasma and pellet of PMBC's into a -80 °C freezer for storage.",
    "2. Receiving and Preparing Patient Tumor Sample\nPrepare either RPMI or DMEM media with 1:100 (10 %) of Penicillin-Streptomycin and Non-essential Amino Acids, 1:1000 (1%) Plasmocin, and 10 % inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (complete media) and add 20 - 25 ml to a sterile collection cup for the tumor specimen.\nRetrieve tumor sample in a sterile cup containing complete media on ice or keep at 4 °C.\n\tNote: The tumor sample is a piece of excess patient tumor tissue that is removed by a surgeon, processed by a pathologist, and placed into a sterile collection cup with complete media. Caution, follow Blood Borne Pathogen guidelines with blood or tissue. Also, ideally to inject five mice, the tumor should be approximately 1 cm³.\nBring the tumor sample to the animal facility for injecting into immunocompromised mice.\n\tNote: It is best to process the tumor sample as soon as possible.\n\t\nIn a laminar flow hood, place the tumor sample into a sterile plastic cutting dish from the tumor cup. Use autoclaved-small scissors and forceps to cut into 10 - 12 approximately 3 x 3 x 3 mm pieces and place into an autoclaved 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube filled with 300 µl of gelatinous protein mixture solution. Keep tube on ice.\nAs a priority inject tumor into mice, but if there is any tumor left over, collect flash frozen vials (FF), formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cups, and a viable tumor vial.\nFor FF, collect small pieces of tumor tissues from a sterile cryogenic vial for further analysis such as protein, RNA, or DNA isolation. Place FF immediately into a liquid nitrogen dewar and store long-term in a -80 °C freezer.",
    "For FFPE, if there is enough tumor, place 3 small pieces into a 10 ml 10 % formalin cup and process into paraffin embedded blocks once tumor has been in formalin for at least 24 hr.\n\t\tNote: 24 hr is based off our Histology Core suggestions 11.\nLastly, place the remaining tumor into a cryogenic tube. Make viable media by adding 10 % Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) to complete media. Next, add 1 ml to a cryogenic tube and store on ice. Note: Do not keep on ice for long periods of time.\n\t\t\nCut any leftover tumor into small pieces that ideally will be enough for 10 tumors to be injected into 5 mice in the future. Then, place the viable tumor tube on ice until it can be placed into an Isopropyl Alcohol freezing container (slowly freezes the tumor 1°C at a time) and put into -80 °C freezer to ensure that the tumors do not die during the freezing process.\n\t\t\tNote: For long-term storage the tumors are removed (after 2 - 3 days) and placed into a large liquid nitrogen dewar. Please note that viable tubes should not be allowed to thaw unless it is being taken out to inject into mice.\n3. Injection of Patient Derived Tumor Xenografts\nUse five 6 - 8 week old male and/or female athymic nude mice (T-cell deficient) for each separate patient derived tumor. Inject a total of 10 tumors (2 injections per mouse) subcutaneously (SQ).\n\tNote: The original human tumor is designated as F0 and then once injected into mice the next generation is F1. Also,use autoclaved forceps, scissors, and trocars for each unique explant.\nLoad pieces of tumor from the gelatinous protein mixture solution into autoclaved 12 G trocars and ensure that the tumor is completely pushed into the trocar.",
    "In a sterile laminar flow hood, place 5 mice into an anesthesia box that is connected to an Isoflurane anesthesia machine (started at the initial rate of 5% Isoflurane, 3 - 4% oxygen, and 2 - 3% Isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia) and charcoal filter (absorbs excess gas).\n\t\tNote: An experienced technician should be able to perform the entire procedure on a cage of 5 mice within approximately 5 min total (roughly 30 sec per mouse). Therefore additional thermal support and eye lubrication is not generally used. For less experienced individuals or during training, it is highly recommended that individuals either perform the procedure on less animals at one time and/or use a warming pad/eye lubrication during procedure if animals will be anesthetized longer than 5 min. Procedure is based upon IACUC standards at our university.\nPinch a mouse toe to ensure the mouse is no longer responsive, then take the mouse out of the Isoflurane box. Place the mouse onto a clean field to inject tumors on the middle dorsal neck region and sliding the trocar down subcutaneously until the flank region is reached with autoclaved 12 G trocars.\n\t\nDeliver one tumor subcutaneously to each side of the mouse's flank. Pinch the tumor when the trocar is pulled out, ensuring that the tumor stays in the desired flank region. The gelatinous protein mixture hardens with the mouse’s body temperature and encapsulates the tumor for approximately 1 week to help the tumor grow and secure it to the SQ connective tissue. The lesion made by the trocar is no larger than 4 mm and there is no need to close the skin with staples.",
    "Note: Our veterinarians determined no closure is needed based on very small size of the lesion, quick healing time (middle dorsal neck region reduces any skin tension or grooming of lesion), no infections noted, and close monitoring of the animals during this time period.\nBefore the mouse is fully awake inject Meloxicam 2 mg/kg SQ (pain medication) away from the site of tumor injection. Next, place the mouse into the cage and monitor until the mouse is awake and moving.\n\tNote: Do not leave recovering animals unattended until fully awake. Meloxicam dosage is based upon IACUC standards at our university.\n\t\nNext, repeat the same procedure with the 4 remaining mice and monitor their breathing.\n\t\tNote: Please note this is a very quick procedure and mice wake up very soon after Meloxicam injection, but adjust Isoflurane as needed. Each time a mouse is taken out, turn down the Isoflurane. The Meloxicam will last 24 hr and the lesions from the trocars will fully heal in 1 week.\n4. Maintenance of Patient Derived Tumor Xenograft Bank\nMonitor growth and health of mice at least once per week. Use a spreadsheet (or other tracking system) to track tumor sizes, tumor generation, date of tumor injection, and health of mice.\n\tNote: If mice have lost 15% of their original body weight, low body condition scores (≥ 2), have tumor ulcerations, tumors reaching 2,000 mm3 or total tumors 3,000 mm3, or are sickly (hunched, cold, lethargy, etc.) in any way, mice are euthanized via CO₂ or anesthetized followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary method. Euthanize via anesthesia and cervical dislocation if collecting tumor, otherwise mice are euthanized via CO₂ and cervical dislocation.\nWhen a tumor is approximately 1,500-2,000 mm3 anesthetize the mice as described above and then perform cervical dislocation to euthanize.",
    "Check that the mouse has no heartbeat. Excise the SQ tumor with autoclaved scissors and forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: Allow tumors to grow for up to 1 year and if no tumor is seen then euthanize the mice via CO2, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary method.\nPassage the best growing tumor into the next generation (aka a new set of 5 mice). Use instructions above to collect 10 - 12 tumors for passing and then collect the leftover tumor as also described above.\n\t\tNote: Collecting numerous viable tubes is very important in the early generations (F1 - F8); therefore collect several viable tubes, FF tubes, and 1 FFPE per generation.\nKeep the remaining mice until a new generation of mice has tumor growth of approximately 300 mm3. When remaining mice have tumors that are large, continue to collect as described above.\nContinue to passage tumors and collect at each stage until F15. At this point, take a viable tube of the earliest generation possible out of liquid nitrogen and let thaw on ice and follow tumor-injecting procedures described above.\n\tNote: Tumors that grow from viable tubes take longer to grow in mice compared to passing from generation to generation, so keep that in mind when planning. If a particular PDTX model is no longer needed at any passage, euthanize and collect tumor, to ensure numerous viable tubes are collected for future use.\n5. Developmental Therapeutics with Patient Derived Tumor Xenografts\nNote: Most tumors at F3 generation have good growth kinetics (grow faster and more consistent), therefore, proceed to PDTX drug efficacy studies.\nWhen the desired tumor is very large (1,500 - 2,000 mm3), follow procedures above to collect tumor to expand into desired amount of mice.",
    "Depending on the hypothesis being tested determine the number of tumors needed per treatment group.\n\t\tNote: 1 ml of gelatinous protein mixture solution can approximately fit 30 small tumor pieces (depending on tumor morphology) for injecting into mice.\nCheck mice with tumors weekly and when most tumors are visibly small (approximately between 50 - 300 mm³) measure the tumors with calipers to determine the tumor volume. Tumor volume = [width² (smallest measurement) x length (largest measurement)] x 0.52.\n\tNote: The gelatinous protein mixture solution surrounds the injected tumor pieces for one week, then after one-week tumor growth will be accurate.\nUse tumor volumes between 50 - 300 mm³ and then average the left and right tumors. Then randomize into treatment groups with 10 tumors per group and a group average within a few numbers of each other. Next, sort the mice into groups and begin the desired treatment study.\nDose the mice with drug (schedule dependent on drug), weigh and measure (tumor) twice per week. At the end of study, euthanize mice via anesthesia and cervical dislocation and collect tumor for future pharmacodynamic analysis in the lab.\n\tNote: The study lasts for 30 days depending on vehicle tumor size and health of mice.\n6. Organization of a PDTX bank\nKeep a well-documented form to prevent repeating of research and appropriate use of animals.\n\tNOTE: This is key to a successful PDTX bank.\n\t\nUse spreadsheets to keep track of a tumor from the human patient in the clinic, to mice in the PDTX bank, treatments, data, and what is collected. Note: this includes freezer, liquid nitrogen dewars, and FFPE storage as well.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
