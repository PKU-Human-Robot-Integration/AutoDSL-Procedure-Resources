    "Tail vein blood collection is a standard non-terminal procedure frequently used in longitudinal studies involving rodents. This method is suitable for collecting small blood volumes (20 to 200 μl) and ideal for repeated blood collection within short intervals (2 to 3 days). Mouse blood collection via tail vein sampling into the anticoagulant solution often leads to variable blood dilutions, which are difficult to resolve and adjust due to small volumes of samples. Although one way might be to add a precisely measured blood volume to a known volume of anticoagulant, this is cumbersome, time-consuming, prone to errors, and, if using pipette aspiration, can induce inadvertent platelet activation through fluid shear stress caused by pipetting blood through a narrow bore tip. Shear-induced activation can trigger the coagulation cascade and platelet activation, resulting in a significant reduction in the cellular components of the blood sample and sample loss. Planned functional studies are also dramatically affected. Hence, we propose an easy, quick, and accurate sample collection method with dilution correction involving precise weighing of the collected material, which can be adapted to any laboratory animal blood collection mode.\nMaterials\n100 mg/kg carboplatin solution (cat. no.

Coat a 500-µl centrifuge tube with EDTA solution by repeatedly dispensing and aspirating roughly 600 µl of 0.5 M EDTA solution into the tube five to six times (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-fig-0001]).\nThe coating helps prevent blood clot formation before mixing with the preferred anticoagulant at the bottom of the tube (step 2).\nAnticoagulants such as heparin, trisodium citrate, and acid citrate dextrose can also be used if preferred or if functional studies are planned where EDTA may interfere.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9b653e6d-402c-4209-9729-31e96d280d73/cpz1765-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSchematic representation of the blood collection method (via tail vein and cardiac bleed) and whole blood count measurements using murine blood samples. First, the tubes were coated with anticoagulant EDTA and then filled with the required amount of EDTA (1:5). Next, the tubes were weighed before and after blood collection. Blood volumes were then calculated using a standard curve, and the accurate blood-to-anticoagulant dilution factor was calculated. The blood counts were measured using the ADVIA 2120 hematology system and then multiplied with the correct blood dilution factors to calculate the final blood cell counts.\n2. Add 15 μl of 0.5 M EDTA to each pre-coated microcentrifuge tube.\nPrepare one tube per mouse from which blood is to be collected.\nAs the anticoagulant volume is calculated based on the maximum blood volume to be collected, this would be a sufficient anticoagulant volume for approximately 100 μl of blood (final concentration 15% or ∼ 50 mM EDTA).",
    "3. Record the weight of all the microcentrifuge tubes containing EDTA using an electronic weighing balance.\nBlood collection tubes can be prepared and stored at room temperature (RT) the day before blood isolation.\n4. Cut the tubing attached to 23-G butterfly needles and have the needles ready for blood collection.\nCut the tubing as close to the needle as possible. This is to ensure that the blood reaches the anticoagulant-coated tube rapidly.\nBlood collection by tail vein bleed\n5. Place the mice in a cage and expose them to a warming lamp for 1 to 2 min to increase the visibility of the tail vein.\nWatch for any signs of distress and immediately move any distressed mice to a new cage.\nDo not expose mice to the heat lamp for a prolonged period (>4 min), which can affect the circulating blood counts.\n6. Place a mouse in a mechanical restrainer with the tail extending out.\n7. Locate one of the two lateral tail veins in the middle third of the ventral tail. Carefully insert a 23-G butterfly needle into the tail vein (Liu et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-bib-0015]).\n8. Discard the first drop of blood and collect approximately 5 to 6 drops (∼45 to 60 μl) of blood into a labeled pre-weighed anticoagulant tube.\n9. Gently tap and invert the tube to ensure blood mixes with the anticoagulant.\nDo not use a pipette or vortex to mix the blood with the anticoagulant.\n10. Use clean tissues to apply pressure to the puncture site for about a minute and ensure the bleeding stops before returning the mouse to the cage.\n11. Reweigh and record the weight of the microcentrifuge tubes containing anticoagulated blood after blood collection.\nStandard curve for blood dilutions and weights",
    "12. For each tube, subtract the weight before drawing blood from the weight after drawing blood. This is the weight of the blood in each tube.\n13. Prepare a standard curve of the sample blood weight versus the volume of blood. To do this, add various known volumes (15 to 150 µl) of anticoagulated blood into 0.5-ml vials and record each weight using an analytical weighing balance. The standard curve needs to be generated only once per mouse strain and used for correcting blood dilution.\n14. Plot the weight versus volume data using a graphing program (e.g., Prism GraphPad or MS Excel) to obtain a standard curve, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/441c4346-13ad-4526-ae35-d1fadd446aca/cpz1765-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nStandard curve for weight versus volume calculations. The standard curve was plotted using the calculated volumes and weights of the blood. The standard curve was used to obtain the formula for measuring unknown volumes from the known weights.\n15.

For routine analysis, a table can be prepared in MS Excel to calculate unknown blood volumes from the weights of the tubes recorded before and after blood collection.\n17. Calculate the dilution factor for each blood sample, as shown in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-tbl-0001].",
    "The final weight of the blood collected is calculated by subtracting the weight of the tubes containing anticoagulant (W1) from the weight of the tube (W2) after blood collection (W2–W1). The weight of the collected blood in each tube was calculated and inserted into the formula, and the total volumes of the blood (V1) and blood–anticoagulant mix (V2) were obtained. The known anticoagulant volume was then subtracted to obtain the blood volume collected in each tube. The anticoagulant dilution factor was calculated using the blood volume and total volume. This dilution factor was added to the standard ADVIA dilution factor (1:4) to obtain the final dilution factor for the blood. Data in the highlighted row of Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-tbl-0001] indicate a change in the dilution factor when less blood was collected.\nTable 1.\n                Mouse Blood Dilution Factor Calculations from the Standard Curve of Weight versus Volumes of the Blood\ntable:\n﻿Sample name,Weight before (W1) (g),Weight after (W2) (g),Final weight of blood (W2–W1),Volume of blood (V1) (µl),Vol. of anticoagulant EDTA (µl),Total vol. blood+ anticoagulant (V2) (µl),Dilution factor of blood (V2–V1),Dilution factor for ADVIA,Final dilution factor\nMl,0.508,0.565,0.057,56.8,15,71.8,1.26,4,5.26\nM2,0.509,0.581,0.072,71.8,15,86.8,1.21,4,5.21\nM3,0.504,0.579,0.075,74.8,15,89.8,1.2,4,5.2\nM4,0.511,0.568,0.057,56.8,15,71.8,1.26,4,5.26\nMS,0.052,0.589,0.069,68.8,15,83.8,1.22,4,5.22\nM6,0.516,0.542,0.026,25.8,15,40.8,1.58,4,5.58\nM7,0.507,0.578,0.062,61.8,15,76.8,1.24,4,5.24\nMS,0.511,0.544,0.037,36.8,15,51.8,1.41,4,5.41\nM9,0.512,0.586,0.075,74.8,15,89.8,1.2,4,5.2\nMlO,0.51,0.574,0.062,61.8,15,76.8,1.24,4,5.24\nMll,0.511,0.58,0.07,69.8,15,84.8,1.21,4,5.21\nM12,0.511,0.565,0.054,53.8,15,68.8,1.28,4,5.28\nM13,0.507,0.563,0.052,51.8,15,66.8,1.29,4,5.29\nM14,0.507,22.0,0.015,14.8,15,29.8,12.01,4,6.01\nScreening of blood samples for clots\n18. Blood clots should be exceedingly rare if employing the appropriate amount of anticoagulant and correct sample handling technique. Visually screen the blood samples for clots by gently tumble-rolling the microcentrifuge tube containing blood at eye level and closely looking for evidence of blood clots (Brake et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-bib-0005]).\nIf in doubt, gentle pipetting can detect clots; blood clots will block the pipette tip and prevent aspiration. Micro-clots can also be visualized by staining blood smears with the Giemsa–Wright stain (Bain, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-bib-0003]).",
    "19. Exclude all the clotted blood samples from blood count measurements and analysis to ensure accurate blood cell numbers.\nClotted blood samples will contain lower levels of all single cells and return inaccurate measurements.\nDilution correction of blood cell count using the standard curve\n20. Mix 50 μl of anticoagulated blood with 150 μl of 1× PBS (4-fold dilution).\nUse 200-µl tips with tip ends cut to prevent platelet activation while dispensing blood. The method described here is for measurements using an automated blood analyzer, but it can be scaled down and used for cell counts made using a hemocytometer.\nThe blood and buffer volumes and dilutions have been optimized using an ADVIA 2120 automated blood analyzer for blood count measurements. We have observed that greater dilutions of blood can diminish accuracy and affect data reproducibility.\nDilute anticoagulated blood samples can be kept at RT, and cell count analysis should be performed within 1 to 2 hr.\n21. Correct the blood cell counts obtained from the automated analyzer by multiplying each value by the appropriate dilution factor, as shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.765#cpz1765-tbl-0002].\nIt is more accurate to correct for the dilution factor based on volume rather than weight. Hence, we use a standard curve to calculate the collected volume of blood.\nTable 2.\n                Blood Cell Counts from Female and Male Mice After Dilution Correction; Comparison of Uncorrected (Standard) and Volume-Corrected Measurements\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0_level_0,Unnamed: 1_level_0,Females,Females,Males,Males\nHematology Parameter,Units x,Corrected data,Uncorrected data,Corrected data,Uncorrected data\nWhite blood cell count,103 cells/μl,9.52 ± 3.1,8.23 ± 2.7,9.5 ± 3.2,8.0 ± 2.4\nRed blood cell count,106 cells/μl,10.1 ± 1.001,8.4 ± 0.9,10.6 ± 1.1,8.6 ± 0.9\nHemoglobin,g/dl,184.1 ± 18.1,150.5 ± 14.9,192.8 ± 18.3,158.5 ± 16.6\nMean cell volume,fl,48.2 ± 1.1,48.3 ± 1.1,48 ± 0.6,48.1 ± 0.7\nPlatelets,103 cells/μl,1231.3 ± 306.8,1037.8 ± 252.4,1276.8 ± 187.4,1058.5 ± 187.4",
