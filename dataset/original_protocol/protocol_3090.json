At the center of the DDR is the chromatin component histone\n      2A variant (H2AX) that is phosphorylated on the serine residue 139 forming\n      the DNA damage mark γH2AX. Gamma irradiation-induced DNA damages activates\n      PI3K-like kinases, a family including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM),\n      ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and DNA-dependent protein\n      kinase (DNA-PK),21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] which in turn leads to\n      γH2AX foci formation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The histone mark\n      γH2AX is also induced by perturbation of the DNA replication process,\n      known as replication stress. Treatment with agents that deplete the\n      nucleotide pool (hydroxyurea), inhibit DNA polymerases (aphidicolin),\n      induce DNA crosslinks and bulky lesions (cisplatin) or target\n      topoisomerase I and II (camptothecin and etoposide, respectively), impair\n      the progression of DNA replication forks. The pattern of γH2AX signal can\n      vary from the formation of discrete foci to global nuclear staining\n      referred to as pan-nuclear staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n      Spreading of the γH2AX mark over large chromosomic regions surrounding an\n      unrepaired double-strand break (DSB) promotes chromatin binding of other\n      DDR factors including the TP53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26],27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27] (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]\n      and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).

For illustration, the",
    "specificity of the γH2AX primary antibody is confirmed by the detection of\n      γH2AX foci induced in all phase of the cell cycle in response to IR, and\n      by the specific induction of the γH2AX signal in S-phase cells by\n      replication stress (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and\n      2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    \nCritical: Primary antibodies that have\n      not previously been characterized in QIBC analysis should be validated\n      using gene-knockout cells or siRNA-mediated knockdown. As an example, the\n      specificity of the 53BP1 primary antibody was confirmed by applying the\n      QIBC pipeline to 53BP1 siRNA treated cells and to control siRNA treated\n      cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n    \n        Sample covered with the primary antibody dilution are incubated in the\n        humidity chamber for 1 h at 18°C–22°C .\n      \nNote: Alternatively, when samples are\n      incubated in 2% BSA saturation buffer for 1 h (step 12), then incubate the\n      samples 16 h at 4°C with the primary antibody dilution.\n    \nWash 2 times with 2 mL PBS for 5 min with agitation (45 rpm).\n        Incubate the sample with 250 μL of freshly prepared anti-Mouse Alexa\n        Fluor 647 secondary antibody diluted at 1:500 in 2% BSA saturation\n        buffer, for 1 h at 18°C–22°C, in the humidity chamber.\n      \nCritical: Negative control is\n      recommended to validate the secondary antibody specificity by incubating\n      the dedicated sample in 2% BSA saturation buffer without primary antibody\n      (step 14, Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) and\n      subsequently incubate this sample with the secondary antibody dilution\n      (step 17).\n    \nNote: The present protocol describes\n      single protein immunofluorescence staining. However, the same protocol can\n      be applied for dual protein staining if the cell preparation procedure for\n      immunostaining is compatible with two proteins detection (step 10). For\n      immunostaining, the sample is incubated with a mix of the two primary\n      antibodies specifically directed against each protein and raised in",

Mowiol mounting media is stored in aliquots at\n        −20°C for up to 1 year.\n      \nCritical: Bubbles in the mounting\n      media interferes with the automatic focusing.

Samples that are part of an experiment must all be\n      imaged during the same acquisition session.\n    \n        Sample shading images are generated for each experimental wavelength at\n        the end of the acquisition session.\n      \nNote: Heterogeneous field illumination due\n      to widefield acquisition needs to be corrected for accurate quantitative\n      QIBC analysis. Field illumination correction requires shading images for\n      the execution of the Fiji-script “01_Shading-Dark correction_v2.ijm” (step\n      35). The shading images are generated for each experimental wavelength by\n      averaging three frames and are obtained by imaging an autofluorescent",

    "to validate the segmented objects. Objects from the ROI list can be\n      removed. For this, the object ROI is selected on the image and the\n      “delete” button of the ROI manager window is clicked. The manual editing\n      process is repeated for all images.\n    \n        The fully automated analysis is complete when the message \"All\n        images in the folder have been analyzed with StarDist plugin\" is\n        displayed.\n      \nNote: Automatically extracted parameters\n      are saved in a new Excel spread sheet called “Results.xls” generated\n      during the Fiji-script execution. The analyzed images QIBC Fiji-script\n      extracted parameters are detailed in the Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. The\n      “Results.xls” file is saved in the folder “image folder” under the\n      \"QIBC_analysis\" folder.\n    \n        The Fiji-script execution generates a new “Label-Image” folder.\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2863_5.csv\nNote: The “Label-Image” folder generated\n      by the execution of the Fiji-script contains for each analyzed image an\n      image on which StarDist segmented object are colored. The “ROI” folder\n      contains for each image the ROI list in a “.Zip“ extension file. To open\n      the ROI, drag and drop the “.Zip” file into Fiji. The ROI will\n      automatically be loaded to the ROI manager window.\n    \n      Part 6: Multiparametric data visualization with Spotfire® software (TIBCO)\n    \nTiming: 1 h to 2 h\n    \n      The use of data visualization tool, such as Spotfire, allows users to\n      cross-analyze the protein parameters in the context of the cell cycle at\n      the individual cell level, thus providing in depth information from\n      asynchronous cell populations.\n    \nNote: The dot plots of asynchronous cell\n      populations presented in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1],\n      2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], and\n      4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] were generated with Spotfire® software (TIBCO). Cell\n      cycle staging based on total DAPI intensities and Mean EdU intensities was\n      performed to discriminate cells into 3 sub-populations (G1, S and G2). A\n      second multidimensional analysis was then applied on the number of 53BP1",
    "or γH2AX foci or on the mean γH2AX intensities in the context of the\n      cellcycle stage of the cell. For visualizing discrete data in\n      scatterplots, mild jittering (random displacement of data points along the\n      discrete data axes) was applied in order to demerge overlapping data\n      points. A template (canvas) of Spotfire® dedicated to QIBC experiment is\n      available for download on the Zenodo platform. Follow the instructions\n      provided in the video tutorial to execute the QIBC multiparametric data\n      visualization for QIBC experiment (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8014997[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8014997])."
