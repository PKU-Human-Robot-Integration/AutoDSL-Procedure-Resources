    "aEEGs are conducted as part of the clinical routine in our hospital. The presented protocol follows the guidelines of the institution's human research ethics committee. Written informed consent regarding the filming and the publication of the material was collected from both parents of all infants that appear in the video.\n1. Gather the Needed Supplies\nConnect the eEEG device to electric power in the place where the monitoring will take place and plug the module box to the aEEG device.   \nEnsure that there are four electrodes for a two-channel aEEG and two electrodes for a single-channel aEEG. Choose either needle electrodes, gold cups, or hydrogel electrodes. Additionally, have one hydrogel electrode ready to serve as a reference electrode.\n\tNOTE: Gold cups can be disinfected and reused for up to two years. Needle and hydrogel electrodes are single-use only. Needle electrodes can be used in infants at 23 weeks of gestation without causing skin lesions or infections. Here, the best results were achieved using needle electrodes in older infants as well.\nPrepare the following supplies: a positioning strip provided by the manufacturer (to help place the electrodes correctly), tape appropriate for use in neonates (e.g., viscose mull), skin disinfectant appropriate for use in neonates (e.g., alcohol-based or octenidinhydrocholoride-based), swabs, skin preparation gel, a module box, and contact gel for gold cups.\n\tNOTE: Once disconnected from electrical power, the device will shut down, and the recording will need to be restarted. Some devices have internal batteries, however, and can be moved after being switched on or during the recording.\n2. Apply the Electrodes\nRespecting the principals of minimal handling42,43,44, apply the electrodes during routine care or delivery room care. Wear (unsterile) gloves, a gown, a hood, and a mask, according to the institution's guidelines and the patient's infectious status.",
    "Prepare the skin for the reference electrode, as follows:\n\t\nDisinfect the skin. Place skin preparation gel on a cotton swab until it is moist. Apply a few gentle strokes with the cotton swab, using very little pressure. Be very cautious in extremely premature infants between 23 and 25 weeks of gestation to avoid causing lesions on the immature skin.\nPlace the reference electrode on the back or the chest of the infant.\nPlace the measuring device on the infant's head, and line up the same letters/signs on the infant's tragus and sagittal suture; the two arrows indicate where to place the electrodes (positions C3, P3, C4, and P4 of the 10 - 20 system).\nPlace the electrodes on the infant's head, following the instructions, below, corresponding to the type of electrodes selected.\nNeedle electrodes.\nDisinfect the area indicated by the measuring device.\nStretch the skin slightly and insert the needle tangentially, just underneath the skin at the markings, with the tip of the needle pointing in the caudal direction. Use tape to keep the electrode in place.\nRepeat the procedure for both/all four electrodes.\n\t\tNOTE: Use needle electrodes in very premature infants, as rubbing for skin preparation is not necessary.\nGold cups.\nDisinfect the area indicated by the measuring device.\nPrepare the skin in the marked areas, as described in step 2.2.\nFill each cup with contact gel. Place the cup in the proper position, with the cable running towards the head end; tape it into place.\nHydrogel electrodes.\nDisinfect the area indicated by the measuring device.\nPrepare the skin in the marked areas, as described in step 2.2.\nPlace the electrodes with the cable running towards the head end. Fix the electrodes with tape in case they do not stay in place.\n3. Connect the Wires to the Monitor",
    "Insert the cables into the module box, as indicated by the legend on the box.\nThe default starting screen includes impedance monitoring for all electrodes.\nMake sure that all electrodes are in place and that there is no mechanical contact between electrodes. If the impedance of one or more electrodes is not satisfactory, remove the corresponding electrode and perform one or two more strokes with the cotton swab, but do not apply more pressure.\nStart the recording when everything is set.\n\tNOTE: Obligatory recording parameters are raw EEG and impedance. According to the device and clinical indication, additional options are burst suppression ratio, sharp transient intensity, and spectral edge frequency, among others. Standard parameters for review include raw EEG, amplitude-integrated EEG curve, and impedance. Depending on the device, there is the opportunity to view more features, like spectral edge frequency, or different forms of the presentation of the lower, mean, and upper border. Additional features are seizure detection and burst rate analysis.\n4. Optional: Place a CPAP Hat\nIf required, place a CPAP hat or head band on top of the aEEG electrodes.\n5. Aspects to Keep in Mind During the Recording\nRegularly check for impedance and the dislocation of electrodes to obtain quality recordings. Also, check the infant for skin irritation to avoid lesions or infections.\nMark events (e.g., handling, kangaroo care (skin-to-skin care), apnea with bradycardia, intubation, and administration of sedatives or opioids) to facilitate the identification of artifacts using the provided button on the screen of the cerebral function monitor. Leave aEEG electrodes in place during kangaroo care to resume the recording afterwards.",
    "Leave aEEG electrodes in place for intubation or other invasive measures to resume the recording later. In case the cables are not long enough to move the infant within the incubator, disconnect them from the module box and reconnect them after the procedure.\n6. Review of the aEEG Tracing and Storing\nReview the tracing at the end of the recoding on the monitor or transfer it to an external storage device."
