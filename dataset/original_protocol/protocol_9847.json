    "All human subject research was performed in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\n1. Locating the MCA signal by freehand TCD\nNOTE: “Freehand” TCD refers to operation of TCD with a handheld transducer to find a CBFV signal before beginning an fTCD experiment.\nSetting TCD parameters\n\t\nKeep the power at a reasonably high value (e.g., 400 mW) during the initial search for the MCA. Once the MCA signal is located, reduce the power as much as possible while still maintaining a “good” signal (see step 2.2.7).\n\t\tNOTE: Using a reasonably high power during the initial search does not violate the “As Low As Reasonably Achievable” (ALARA) principle of exposure to acoustic radiation because higher power will allow the MCA signal to be discovered more quickly10.\nSet the sample volume to 8–12 mm during the initial search for the MCA signal. If the signal is difficult to find, increase the gate size to increase the intensity of the signal, but note that this may incorporate the signal from one or more nearby arteries into the signal from the MCA.\nSet the gain at a medium level, with the goal of “keeping background noise at a minimum, but present”10. \nSet the high-pass filter cutoff (normally termed “threshold”) to 50–150 Hz. \nIf the subject is an adult, set the depth to 50 mm, which is the average mid-point depth of the M1 segment of the MCA10 (Figure 1). \n\t\t​NOTE: This setting will be discussed in more detail in subsequent steps. Depth settings for children are given in Table 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62048/62048fig1.jpg",

In such individuals, bilateral insonation of the MCA is sometimes impossible.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62048/62048fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: The transtemporal window (marked by the dashed ellipse), zygomatic arch (arrow), and subwindows11.

    "​NOTE: When placed on the head, the gel should cover sufficient space to maintain a seal between the scalp and the Doppler probe’s surface, thus preventing signal interruption from air coupling underneath the probe’s surface.\nAlert the subject that the gel may feel cold (if at room temperature).\nPlace the transducer on the temporal window, which was located in section 1.2.\nSearching for the MCA\n\t\nAfter placing the transducer on the scalp, search for the MCA signal, which will generally be located slightly anterior (forwards) and rostral (towards the head) from the location of the initial transducer scalp placement10.\nIf the TCD spectral signal is not immediately obvious, adjust the angle of the transducer while keeping it in the same location relative to the scalp. Slowly angle the probe from rostral to caudal (towards feet) and posterior to anterior. \n\t\tNOTE: Figure 3 shows two spectra taken from the same position, but at different angles.\nIf a signal is still absent after performing step 1.4.2, check the color M-mode display for flow in the MCA at different depths (indicated by red coloring). Increment or decrement the signal depth in 5 mm steps and search as described in step 1.4.2. If flow is visible in M-mode but not in the Doppler spectrum, increase or decrease the depth until the flow signal is visible in the Doppler spectrum.\nIf a satisfactory signal is still not obtained, move the transducer to a nearby position on the scalp, which is slightly more anterior, and repeat steps 1.4.1–1.4.3. \nWhen an optimal MCA signal is obtained, note the depth and maximum velocity.\nUsing a washable makeup pen, place a mark on the scalp (trace part of the transducer edge) where the optimal signal was found. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62048/62048fig3.jpg",

(B) Sample Doppler spectrum at same location and depth as (A). The only change is that the transducer has been angled upwards (superiorly) slightly. In both (A) and (B), depth = 50 mm, gain = 50, sample volume = 12 mm, power = 420 mW/cm2, and filter = 100 Hz.

This step should be performed on both sides if bilateral monitoring will be performed, as the bifurcation may not be at the same depth on both sides.\n\t\nIncrease the depth until the signal from the bifurcation of the ICA into the MCA and ACA is noted (Figure 4), typically at a depth of 51–65 mm10.\nSearch for the optimum bifurcation spectral signal using the procedure described in step 1.4.2. Always strive for the highest-velocity spectral signal possible10. \nWhen an optimal bifurcation signal is obtained, note the depth of the bifurcation.\nFor bilateral monitoring, repeat sections 1.1–1.4 and steps 1.5.1–1.5.3 on the other side of the head.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62048/62048fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Spectral Doppler (top) and M-mode (bottom) image of bifurcation of the ICA into the MCA and ACA.

Relocating the MCA after placing a fixation device",
    "NOTE: For fTCD experiments, it is necessary to monitor CBFV for 10–90 min or longer. Therefore, a fixation device (Figure 5) is crucial to provide stability.\nPlacing the fixation device\n\t\nBy visual inspection, adjust the fixation device (Figure 5) to the subject’s approximate head size.\nAlert the subject before placing the headset on his or her head. Place the headset on the subject’s head.\n\t\tNOTE: If the subject has long or thick hair, it may be necessary to tie the subject’s hair back, depending on the fixation device being used.\nAdjust the fixation device’s fit, and ask the subject if the device is too tight.\n\t\tNOTE: The device should be tight enough that it does not move when bumped slightly, but loose enough that the subject is not uncomfortable.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62048/62048fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Subject wearing custom fixation device. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62048/62048fig5large.jpg]\nLocating the MCA signal\n\t\nLoosen the mechanism of the fixation device holding the transducer in place (e.g., loosen the mechanism, shown in in Figure 5, by turning a knob counterclockwise) so that the transducer can move freely.\nAlert the subject before applying gel to the transducers (which should already be in place from section 2.1), and that the gel may be cold (if it has been stored at room temperature).\nApply enough ultrasound gel to the transducer to cover the face of the transducer. \nAdjust the fixation device so that the transducer is located over the top of the mark made in step 1.4.6.\nSearch for the optimal MCA spectral signal using the procedure described in steps 1.4.1–1.4.3. Always strive for the highest-velocity spectral signal possible10.",
    "NOTE: When compared to freehand TCD, the optimal depth at which the MCA is located using the fixation device may differ slightly (at most 1–2 mm) from the depth for the freehand device. This is because the fixation device may hold the transducer slightly further away from the scalp while still maintaining a coupling gel seal.\nWhen the optimal MCA spectral signal is found, tighten the mechanism of the fixation device to lock the transducer in place. Note the depth and all other settings. \nDecrease the power (see step 1.1.1) as much as possible while still maintaining a spectral envelope that traces the maximal velocity accurately.\nFor bilateral monitoring, repeat steps 2.2.1–2.2.7 on the other side.\n3. Performing a breath-hold maneuver\nNOTE: This section is given as an example of a functional experiment that may be performed using the experimental setup described in section 1 and section 2.\nPerform all steps described in section 1 and section 2.\nBegin recording on the TCD software.\nBreathe normally for 3 min to achieve a good baseline recording, and allow CBFV to stabilize from any previous experiments or stimuli.\nCount down slowly from three. On the count of one, ask the subject to begin breath-holding following a normal inspiration13. \n\tNOTE: The subject should not inhale deeply, as this would decrease carbon dioxide in the lungs and decrease the likelihood of observing the increase in CBFV due to cerebrovascular reactivity. The subject should also avoid performing a Valsalva maneuver, in which intrathoracic pressure is substantially increased against a held inspiration14. \nPlace a marker in the TCD recording to signify the start of breath-holding.\nHave the subject hold their breath for 30 s, or until they are no longer comfortable holding their breath.",
    "When the subject inhales, place a marker in the TCD recording to signify the end of breath-holding.\nContinue monitoring CBFV using TCD and recording for at least 30 s following the end of breath-holding to ensure that CBFV returns to baseline values.\nSubscription Required.
