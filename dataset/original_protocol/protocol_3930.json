Fill the custom-made or commercial incubation chamber with micro-dissecting solution and place it on ice next to the bubbling cutting solution. Keep this solution saturated using a solvent inlet bubbler line.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/899-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Brain extraction and mounting setup\n(A) Ice bucket containing the dissection tools, perfusion syringe with slushy cutting solution, and a 100 mL storage bottle with slushy cutting solution as well.\n(B) An extracted brain in an ice tray containing bubbling cutting solution and the arrow points to the inlet solvent filter used for bubbling. This brain was perfused with slushy cutting solution prior to extraction in order to obtain a high-quality image.\n(C) Image of the brain following removal of the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs.\n(D) Specimen holder with a glued agar block used a bumper support to prevent dislodging of the brain during slicing. Scale bars: (Main panels) 20 mm and (Insets) 5 mm.\nNote: We generally do not perform transcardial perfusion prior to brain extraction, but it is a common practice that may prove to be beneficial especially if this protocol is applied to aged mice. In such scenario, perfusion can be done manually using a 30mL syringe filled with approximately 25mL of slushy solution. This perfusion syringe should be prepared in advance and kept on ice until processing (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).",
    "Place a double-edge razor blade in a 20 mm glass petri dish with acetone for 5 min. Scrape residual glue off the blade and rinse with copious amount of water. Mount the blade on the vibratome (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and set up the optimal slicing settings for your machine. We cut 350μm-thick slices using an advancing speed of 0.1–0.15 mm/s and 1 mm amplitude to obtain healthy slices with the Leica VT-1200, but slices of similar quality can be obtained using other models, providing that proper settings are used.\nMove the ice bucket with the cutting solution containing syringe and 100 mL storage bottle as well as tools to the dissection area. Remove the ice tray from the freezer and rinse the inner dish containing the Sylgard in order to dispose ice from accidental water spillage. Now add the slushy cold cutting solution from the 100 mL storage bottle to the Sylgard dish and bubble it with the inlet solvent diffuser in the dissection area.\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber and turn on oxygen tank and vaporizer filled with isoflurane (1–2%) and wait until limb and eye reflexes have disappeared. Note that approved anesthetic cocktails can be used instead of isoflurane (i.e., intraperitoneal injection of the ketamine–xylazine mixture). When preparing slices from two animals (e.g., a control and an experimental) at the same time, we recommend processing each animal separately from anesthesia to brain extraction (See step 7). We do not recommend the processing of more than two animals in the same preparation. Also, a second ice tray is required to keep the brains from the animals apart in order to avoid mix up.",
    "Decapitate the animal using the standard scissors. Place the head in the slushy cutting solution in the ice tray and cut the skin longitudinally along the skull median line and laterally as well using the micro-dissecting scissors in order to fully expose the skull.\nCut the skull bone longitudinally along the median line, advancing from back to front with extreme care in order to prevent damage to the brain with the scissors tip. Make one last transverse cut along the nasal bone, then use the bone rongeurs to pull the skull top from the brain.\nGently scoop the brain using a long-curved tip spatula and cut out the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs while in the slushy bubbling solution (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C). Allow the brain to recover for 2–3 min in the ice tray while bubbling using the solvent inlet filter line. At this point, it is possible to begin the brain extraction process for another animal beginning with the anesthesia induction in step 4.\nPlace a 42.5 mm round filter on the back of the glass petri dish and dampen it with some cold cutting solution. Gently place the brain on the soaked filter paper using a flat squared tip spatula. Remove excess cutting solution using a transfer pipette or 2–3 pieces of filter paper sequentially.",
    "Apply a dab of glue on the surface of the specimen holder in front of the agar block (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) and use a strip of filter paper to lift the brain from the back of the petri dish and place it on the glue. Make sure the back of the brain is in contact with the agar block. Note that lifting the brain with the filter paper strip can be done by first folding ¼ inch of the filter to create an L shape strip and touch the surface of the brain with the smaller folded portion to lift it and place the ventral side of the brain on the glue. This approach allows for the slicing of both brain hemispheres in the transverse plane. If you are processing two brains, we recommend mounting the brains in a line to mitigate the risk of mixing the slices as they come off the blade. This arrangement, however, prolongs the slicing time as opposed to mounting side-by-side.\nNote: we generally place a 4% agar block on the specimen holder prior to mounting the brain in order to prevent advancing force of the blade from dislodging it during slicing (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). The brain is mounted between the block and the advancing blade holder. We strongly recommend using such agar block as it serves an important role in generating healthy slices.",
    "Place the specimen holder with brain attached to the stage chamber and quickly fill it with ice-slushy cutting solution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Set up a cutting window if your vibratome allows for it as it significantly reduces the cutting time. Remove the inlet solvent bubbler from the ice tray and place it in the stage chamber as far away as possible from the cutting blade (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) and cut the tip of a transfer pipette to create an opening large enough to capture the slices as they come off the blade. Cut 350μm-thick transverse slices. If you are slicing two brains, take the necessary care to prevent mixing them (See steps 4 and 9 for tips).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/899-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Slicing and microdissection setup\n(A) Final view of the slicing setup with the mounted on the specimen holder and submerged in bubbling slushy cutting solution.\n(B) Slices in bubbling recovering or microdissection solution.

    "Carefully pick up each slice as they come off the blade using the wide mouth transfer pipette and place the slices inside the bubbling incubation chamber sitting on ice (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, pictured off ice for clarity). If you are slicing two brains, make sure to have a dedicated commercial (See note in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]/brain slicing for suggestions) or custom (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) incubation chamber for each brain.\nMove the slices to an ice tray with bubbling recovery solution for microdissection under a microscope immediately after collecting the last slice from the vibratome (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nAdjust the optical settings on the dissection microscope in order to have clear view of the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Using a sable brush to gently hold the slice in place, cut the cortex and hippocampus from the subcortical brain structures of both hemispheres with a scalpel blade (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). Mince tissue into chunks as small as possible and collect the hippocampal/cortical tissue chunks along with some microdissection solution in a 15 mL Falcon tube and proceed to incubation.\nIncubation\nTiming: 90–120 min\nRemove microdissection solution from 15 mL falcon tube with minced cortical and hippocampal tissue chunks using a transfer pipette and quickly add ∼2.6 mL of EBSS#1-papain-DNase mixture to the Falcon tube.\nDisplace the air in vial with a carbogen tubing line with no inlet solvent filter attached at room temperature (RT; 21°C–23°C) for 2–3 min and immediately cap the vial. Do not bubble gas through the solution.\nSeal the cap of the Falcon tube with parafilm and wrap it in foil. Tape the sealed and wrapped Falcon tube to a rocking platform in the hybridization oven/incubator and incubate for ∼90 min at 37⁰C.",
    "Critical: We highly recommend test runs prior to the final experiment to evaluate the appropriate duration (30–90min) of the incubation. We noticed that the RNA yield was best using a 90min incubation.\nIn the meantime, prepare the following:\nSet a centrifuge for 15 mL tubes to RT (21°C–23°C) for short spins.\nPrecoat Eppendorf LoBind Microcentrifuge or 15 mL Falcon tubes for collecting FACS cells by filling them with 30% BSA incubate at RT (21°C–23°C) until after final resuspension. We generally collect our FACS cells in a 15 mL falcon tube.\nEBSS#2 (RESUSPENSION) solution in a 50 mL Falcon tube: 9.6 mL EBSS + 700μL OPI + 500μL DNAse 1, and 1.2cc 50% Trehalose in EBSS for a total volume of 12 mL for each brain and place on ice.\nOPI discontinuous density gradient medium: 5 mL OPI in EBSS + 0.6 mL of 50% Trehalose in EBSS for a total volume 5.6 mL per brain and place on ice.\nTrituration\nTiming: 30–40 min\nTriturate the mixture 8–10 times using a 10 mL serological pipette. Let the non-dissociated chunks settle for a couple minutes and collect the cloudy suspension for centrifugation in a 15 mL Falcon tube. This is important for FACS efficiency.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 300 g (∼1800 RPM) for 5 min at RT (21–23°).\nDiscard the supernatant and gently re-suspend the pellet in 3 mL of mixed EBSS#2 solution by trituration with a 1 mL micropipette while avoiding air bubbles.\nSlowly and gently layer the cell suspension to the OPI discontinuous density gradient medium previously prepared and do not agitate. The cell suspension can be transferred to the OPI medium by slowly expelling it from the transfer pipette along the wall of the Falcon tube. This step is critical for a cell suspension with minimal cellular debris.",
    "Centrifuge at 70 g (∼800 RPM) for 6 min at RT (21–23°).\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet 2 mL of FACS solution prepared in the morning using a 1 mL micropipette.\nCount cells: Take 50 μL of cell suspension and add it to 250μL of 0.4% trypan blue. Mix well and mount on hemocytometer. Count the live, unstained cells (Live cells do not take up trypan blue) in 4 corner squares on the hemocytometer. Take the average cell count and multiply by 10,000 (1×104). Multiply by five to correct for the 1:5 dilution from the trypan blue addition. The final value is the number of viable cells/mL in the original cell suspension.\nCritical: For FACS efficiency, it may be necessary to dilute the cell suspension further if the cell density is too high. We generally aim for a density ≤1×107 cells/mL. Staining of surface antigens with antibodies may be done at this point. In addition, cell suspension can be labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Cat#: 62247; ThermoFisher Scientific) or propidium iodide to label dead cells, allowing for gating of dead cells from live cells. Alternatively, live cells can be labeled with the membrane permeable dye calcein acetomethoxyis (Cat#: 65-0853-39; ThermoFisher Scientific), which emits bright green fluorescence signals upon cleavage of the acemethoxy group by active cellular esterase. We did not use fluorescent dyes as they prolong the preparation, but they are certainly useful in the first few preparations as they allow for the assessment of progress in generating suspensions with predominantly live and healthy cells.\nFACS sorting\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "Prepare FACS collection tubes: Aspirate BSA from 15 mL Falcon tubes or the Eppendorf LoBind Microcentrifuge tubes and add the desired solution for collecting FACS cells (e.g., 0.1–2 mL FACS solution or 750μL TRIzol LS/250μL sorted volume). Note that we generally collect our cells in a 15 mL Falcon tube with a starting volume of 2 mL FACS solution.\nConfirm that the flow cytometer tubing was rinsed with one run of RNase free dH2O, then bleach followed by RNase free dH2O.\nConfirm that the nozzle size is set up to ensure smooth passage of neurons. We normally use a 100 μm nozzle with a sheath pressure of 45 psi. We generally excite TdTomato with an argon-ion laser (488 nm) and detect using emission spectra between 564 nm and 606 nm. Finally, limit sorting to 60–75 min per sample.\nConfirm the sorting will be conducted at slow speed to prevent damage to neurons.\nTake a few cells at the beginning of sorting and observe under a fluorescent microscope to ensure cells are:\nWell dissociated and viable.\nTomato red positive.\nUse proper forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) properties to exclude debris and doublets (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/899-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

(I) Total neuronal population in both preparations were selected by forward and side scatter profiles. (II) Fluorescence gates were established by comparing TdTomato positive and negative cells. (III) TdTomato positive cells were selected for RNA extraction. (IV) Histograms of fluorescence emission of sorted TdTomato positive cells versus event number.\ncheck the intensity of the fluorescence and report it.",
    "Gating can be adjusted at this stage to ensure that fluorescence positive cells alone are collected.\nSet up a timer at the start of sorting and collect TdTomato+ cells in either Eppendorf micro-centrifuge or 15 mL Falcon tubes with FACS solution or TRIzol LS. If you choose to collect directly in TRIzol LS, limit your collection volume to 250μL as noted above in step 25 because TRIzol LS allows at most a 30% sample volume for optimal RNA isolation as per manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). More importantly, restrict total sorting time to 1–2 h to prevent RNA degradation.\nAfter sorting, spin the cells at 140 g (∼1300 RPM) for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant. Cells pellet can be kept at −80°C for until RNA preparation at a later time point. While freezing cells in TRIzol LS at −80°C for up to a month is generally tolerable, we recommend immediate RNA extraction from cells collected in such solution in order to maximize recovery.\nRNA extraction and purification\nTiming: 2–3 h\nWe use the TRIzol LS method for RNA extraction and purification with few modifications from the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific), but other methods such as the Invitrogen purelink kit can be used with modifications to obtain high quality RNA (Saxena et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nPreparation:\nReagents: Isopropanol, Chloroform, TRIzol LS, RNase Zap, linear acrylamide, DEPC-treated water, sodium acetate (3M), 200 proof ethanol.\n75% ethanol in DEPC-treated water on ice.\nTurn on centrifuge and set temperature to 4°C\nTake out linear acrylamide out of the freezer and keep at RT.\nSet up water bath to 37°C.\nClean and wipe tools, working area, and tubes with RNase Zap.",
    "Thaw your FACS sample on ice. If you have a frozen pellet of FACS cells, add 1 mL of TRIzol LS while thawing. Homogenize sample by intermittent vortexing for 2 min and then by pipetting up and down (10×).\nIncubate the homogenized sample at room temp for 5 min to permit complete dissociation of the nucleoprotein complex.\nAdd 267μL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol LS reagent used for homogenization. Cap the tube securely and shake vigorously by hand for 15 s.\nIncubate for 15 min at RT (21°–23°) and then spin a centrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nRemove the aqueous phase by decanting into a clean new tube. Avoid the organic phase as it contains mostly DNA and, thus, will affect the quality of the extracted RNA.\nAdd 2μL of linear acrylamide to the aqueous phase and gently mix by inverting the tube.\nAdd 666μL of 100% isopropanol per 1 mL TRIzol LS used for homogenization and gently mix by inverting the tube for 15 s.\nIncubate at RT (21°–23°) for 10 min and then spin at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the RNA pellet and resuspend the pellet in 100μL of DEPC-treated water.\nAdd 200μL of 100% ethanol and 10μL of 3M sodium acetate to the resuspended RNA. Briefly Vortex to mix the solution and store in a −20°C freezer for at least 1 h.\nSpin at 14000 g for 30 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the RNA pellet with 1 mL of 75% cold ethanol (Made with DEPC-treated water) by gently inverting the tube.",
    "Spin at 14000 g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant. Air dry the pellet for about 5 min to allow residual ethanol to evaporate. Do not allow pellet to over dry as that tends to interfere with solubility.\nResuspend pellet in ∼25μL DEPC-treated water and obtain a rough estimate of RNA yield using a nanodrop or fluorescent based methods (Qubit for example). Accurate yield and quality of RNA can be readily obtained using a bioanalyzer 2100 with a Pico/Nano chip. At this point RNA sample can be stored at −80°C until use for RNAseq or other experimental plans.\nCritical: Bioanalyzers are expensive, but they are often available for use in Flow Cytometry core facilities for a fee. If your core facility does not have one, RNA integrity can be checked by running some of your sample on a 1% standard agarose gel and examine the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bands. High integrity RNA should have an upper 28S band of twice the density of the lower 18S band. Both bands should be tight and crisp."
