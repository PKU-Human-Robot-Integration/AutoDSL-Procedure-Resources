    "This protocol follows guidelines set forth by the Institutional Review Board and human subject research protocol of the University of Kentucky.\n1. Opening the Image Viewer\nOpen the image viewer used at the institution where the research is being conducted. Double-click on the desktop icon to open the viewer.\nLog in using an institutional username and password.\n2. Identifying the Appropriate Patient\nClick on the Study List icon in the toolbar.\nUnder the Search Criteria drop-down list, choose the option labeled With Patient ID Equal To.\nEnter the patient's hospital identification number.\nUnder Modalities, click on All Modalities to unselect all the imaging modalities.\n\t\nClick on CT to select this modality.\nUnder Body Regions, leave the default to All Body Regions.\nThen, click with the mouse on Find.\n3. Identifying the Optimal Study\nClick on Performed on to organize the list by the date of study.\nThen, click on the study of interest.\n\tNOTE: The optimal study is a CT chest (either with or without contrast). When multiple studies are available, use the CT scan that can visualize the entire coronary tree closest to the index time point (for retrospective data analysis) or the most recent CT scan (for clinical purposes).\n4. Identifying Optimal Image Series\nClick with the mouse on the tile icon in the top-right corner of the screen and highlight a single tile. Click to make the screen a single pane.\nHover over the series icon on the top row of images to identify the series that has a 3 mm slice thickness (or the closest to 3 mm).\nClick and hold the left mouse button, drag this icon to the center of the viewing screen, and release the left mouse button.",
    "Use the center mouse scroll bar (or, alternatively, hold the left mouse button and drag to the right) to scroll through images and ensure an adequate visualization of the coronary tree.\n5. Optimizing the Images to Highlight Calcification\nScroll through the images until an image where one of the coronary arteries is visualized.\nRight-click and select the Window/Level option.\nClick on Interactive W/L.\nAs a starting point, type in 500 in the W (window) field.\nAs a starting point, type in 150 in the L (level) field.\n\tNOTE: The goal of adjusting the window and level settings is to optimize the contrast between epicardial fat [usually the lowest Hounsfield unit (HU) in the cardiac silhouette], cardiac chambers, and calcification or metallic structures (usually the highest HU). CT scans with contrast that use lower kV often require the highest level (often > 250 HU) and the largest window (often > 1,000 HU). For \"low-dose\" CT scans (low mAs) without contrast, would use a slightly lower level (0 - 150 HU).\nManually adjust the window by holding down the left mouse button on the horizontal slide bar and moving it right and left (moving the scroll bar to the right increases the window).\nManually adjust the level by holding down the left mouse button on the vertical slide bar and moving it up and down (moving the scroll bar up increases the level).\n\tNOTE: The goal is to adjust the window and level to achieve the following: fat, including epicardial fat, should be dark gray to black; myocardium should be a slightly lighter gray; and calcium and metal should be white.\nClick on Close to close the window and level box and begin viewing the images.\n6. Identifying Coronary Artery Calcification",
    "Use the center scroll ball on the mouse to scroll up and down the series of images, looking at one coronary at a time.\nMark (on a separate document, spreadsheet, etc.) whether coronary artery calcification is present or absent in each of the four major epicardial coronary arteries (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: CAC is deemed as present in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCx), or right coronary artery (RCA) if it is seen in the vessel itself or in its branches.\n7. Techniques for Identifying Subtle Areas of Calcification\nIdentify an area of questionable coronary artery calcification.\nRight-click on the screen to bring up the menu.\nClick on Annotate.\nThen, click on Elliptical ROI.\nClick and hold down the left mouse button on the area of calcification and move it down and to the right to create a circle or ellipse large enough to cover the area of calcification.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: Make sure the region of interest (ROI) is large enough to cover the entire area of potential calcification and some epicardial fat, but small enough to not include other chambers (especially those with contrast). The software will then provide the minimum, maximum, and average HU in the area without the region of interest.\n\t\nClick and hold the left mouse button in the center of the region of interest to move it if necessary.\nClick and hold the left mouse button on the corners of the region of interest to adjust the size if necessary.\nRepeat steps 7.5 - 7.5.2 to create another region of interest over the sternum, the bright bony structure at the top of the screen.\nRepeat steps 7.5 - 7.5.2 to create another region of interest over the ascending aorta.",
    "Compare the maximum HU in the area of potential calcification to the maximum HU in the ascending aorta and the sternum.\n\tNOTE: Classify an area as coronary artery calcification if it is more than 2 standard deviations away from the maximum HU in the ascending aorta. Coronary artery calcification should have a maximum HU closer to the maximum HU in the sternum than the maximum HU in the ascending aorta (Figure 2).\n8. Distinguishing Coronary Artery Calcification from Other Sources of Calcification\nTo open the post-processing software, left click on Windows' start button and then click on the post-processing software. Now, log in using an institutional username and password.\nTo open the study and series, type in either the Patient ID or the Patient Name in the appropriate field in the search options at the top right of the screen. Then, uncheck Date 1.\n\t\nNow, click on Update Study List and then perform a single click on the desired study from the results list at the top left of the screen.\nIn the Series List below, click on the series that has the 3 mm slice thickness in the label.\nClick and hold the center mouse scroll bar on one of the images and move the mouse up to zoom in so the arteries can be visualized well.\nClick and hold the left mouse button on the center of each of the crosshairs to move them over the center of the area of calcification in question.\nClick and hold the left mouse button on the marker on the crosshairs to be able to rotate the other two images. Continue to watch the other two images until the adjacent structure of interest is well visualized.",
    "NOTE: The 3 areas that are most often confused for coronary artery calcification include aortic wall calcification as RCA or left main artery (LM) calcification, mitral annular calcification (mistaken for LCx calcification) or tricuspid annular calcification (mistaken for RCA calcification), and pericardial calcification. Coronary arteries are surrounded by epicardial fat, whereas these other adjacent structures are not.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
