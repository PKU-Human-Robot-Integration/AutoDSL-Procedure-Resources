    "The protocol follows the animal care guidelines of the University of Cincinnati and West Virginia University. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC), and were performed according to the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Installation of the blast TBI setup\nAcquire all the working parts that are required for the setup, including: shock tube consisting of steel driven- and driver section, polyester membrane, securing bolts, pressure sensors, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe shield to protect peripheral organs, 9.53 mm high pressure hydraulic line and quick connect male and female attachments, high flow gas regulator and a gas cylinder with wall-mount bracket (see Figure 1A,B and Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The specifications of the driven and driver section used here (see Figure 2 and Table of Materials) have been established to produce a consistent short-duration scaled blast wave (see Figure 3C,D) to induce mild to moderate TBI in mice. For this purpose, a taper-designed (6° taper) short driver section was selected. The length and diameter of the driven and driver sections can be modified to specifically research blast wave29,30,31,32, compression wave18, or shock wave dynamics33. For experiments with rats, the dimensions of the shock tube need to be adapted to yield comparable forces according to retain pertinent body scaling parameters17 (see Table of Materials).\nInstall the individual working parts of the setup on machine slide tables that are fixed on a stable, easy to clean surface (preferably stainless steel for use in rodents) in laboratory space approved for animal experiments.\n\tNOTE: The blast wave experiments produce a considerable level of noise; therefore choose a location within sound absorbing laboratory space, where noise will not interfere with other experiments/laboratory groups.",
    "Fix the PVC pipe shield perpendicular to the shock tube setup so that the body of the rodent will be fully covered and only the head protrudes.\n\t\tNOTE: For the standard procedure to induce mild to moderate TBI described here, the center of the head is located 5 cm from the end of the driven section for mice.\nWall mount gas cylinder in close proximity to setup in accordance with OSHA and all other pertinent safety regulations.\n\t\tNOTE: Compressed air, helium or nitrogen gas are commonly used to generate the blast waves in rodent shock tube models. All data presented here has been generated using helium, as this gas produces higher overpressure over a shorter duration34, allowing for appropriate scaling for murine subjects.\n2. Evaluation of the setup and blast wave properties using pressure sensor recordings.\nPrepare the shock tube.\n\t\nCarefully cut the polyester membrane without bending and producing fissures, in order to ensure consistent rupture.\nInsert the membrane between the driven and driver sections. Secure the sections by tightening connecting bolts.\nCheck that the system is airtight and the membrane is tightly fixed between driver and driven sections.\nConnect the gas tank via a 9.53 mm high pressure hydraulic hose and quick connect attachments to the shock tube\n\t\tNOTE: Driver and driven sections are machined to precise tolerances in order to afford a complete seal of membrane between sections. This allows for no gas leakage and precludes the use of any form of gasket/o-ring material and allows for greater consistency in generated waveform.\nInstall the pressure sensors for monitoring the blast waves (see Figure 1C).\n\t\nPosition one pressure sensor in the head placement area, and three sensors at the exit of the shock tube (see Figure 1C and 2).",
    "Initiate recording from pressure sensors, just prior to blast wave execution. Record the pressure wave data at 500,000 frames per second using a sensor signal conditioner and data acquisition board (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Wear OHSA-approved earmuffs to ensure adequate hearing protection.\nOpen the main valve of the compressed gas tank fully to allow the gas flow to produce a sudden, rapid pressure spike.\n\t\tNOTE: The gas overpressure ruptures the polyester membrane to release a shock wave that transitions into a compression wave within the driven section and exits the tube in the direction of the head placement area.\nTurn off the gas flow immediately after the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: The setup can be equipped with a spring return valve to automatically and rapidly stop the gas flow.\nAnalyze the pressure wave recordings using custom written computer program to determine peak overpressure and graph data. Data can be graphed with each sensor individually or overlaid on one another to demonstrate planarity of the wave generated (see Figure 3C,D).\n\t\tNOTE: The analysis can technically be done using more readily available software, but due to the large data sets, these programs have long delays in generating plots.\nEstablish experimental conditions that are adequate for the aim of the designated TBI study, and confirm that the model produces a consistent blast wave with a peak over-pressure, duration, and impulse measurement comparable to a Friedlander wave (see Figure 3). Verify these parameters using the aforementioned computer software.\n\t\nCalibrate the setup by repeating steps 2.1.1. to 2.2.5. and use the pressure wave recordings to determine whether the setup needs adjustment (for representative data see Figure 3).\nModify the setup (if needed).",
    "NOTE: The blast wave properties can be adjusted by minor modifications of the setup. For example, the distance of the head to the end of the driven section impacts the blast wave force at the level of the head. The thickness of the polyester membrane determines the level of peak overpressure, with thicker membranes increasing peak levels (see Figure 3A,B). Additionally, the setup allows selecting the direction by which the blast wave strikes/penetrates the head (i.e., head-on, side, top or underneath) and therefore different aspects can be investigated, such as blast wave injury alone or in combination with coup and contrecoup injury due to rapid rotational forces.\nRepeat steps 2.1.1 to 2.2.4 to establish desired blast wave properties (if needed) and control for reproducibility.\nRepeat steps 2.1.1 to 2.2.4 with polyester membranes of different thickness to evaluate scalability of the setup (for representative data see Figure 3A,B).\n3. Preparation of experimental setup and induction of mild TBI in rodents\nNOTE: Transfer rodents to holding area 30 min to 1 h prior to start of TBI experiments to acclimatize. Select holding area that is minimally affected by noise of the procedure.\nPrepare all materials required for the experiment and check setup for proper installation (e.g., adjust parameters according to aim of study) (~5 – 10 minutes).\n\tNOTE: Injury severity can be adjusted by selecting the thickness of the polyester membrane. Based on our studies, a membrane thickness of 25.4 to 102 μm is utilized for mild to moderate TBI in mice35. We have previously utilized membranes with a thickness of 76.2 to 127 μm to produce mild to moderate TBI in rats19.\n\t\nCarefully cut the polyester membrane, insert it between the driven and driver sections and secure by tightening the connecting bolts.",
    "Connect the gas tank to the shock tube through the use of quick-release fittings. Ensure that the membrane is tightly fixed between driver and driven sections.\nPlace three pressure sensors at the exit of the shock tube, 120° apart, to monitor the blast wave properties during the TBI induction as described in step 2.2.2 and 2.2.5.\nEnsure distance from end of shock tube apparatus is correct for each respective subject using installed micrometer. Keep the positioning of the rodent’s head (i.e., position, distance) constant within studies to allow for consistent injury evaluation.\n\t\tNOTE: As stated in 1.2.1., different types of injury can be induced by selecting the direction, in which the blast wave impacts the head. For the procedure to induce mild to moderate TBI described here, the body is placed perpendicular to the shock tube that the blast wave impacts the side of the head. In this setting, the head is allowed free mobility and hence is exposed to the blast wave and rapid rotational forces allowing the generation of coup and contrecoup effects.\nInitiate the recording from the pressure sensors using the graphical user interface (GUI) of the software.\nAnesthesia and positioning of rodents in setup\n\t\nTransfer rodents from holding room and induce anesthesia with 4% isoflurane in oxygen and maintain with 2% isoflurane in oxygen to reduce distress and pain.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the animal is non-responsive to toe or tail pinch prior to proceeding. Make sure the induction of anesthesia is consistent for all experimental animals, including sham controls. This procedure requires a low-level and short duration of anesthesia.\nPlace the fully anesthetized rodent in the PVC pipe shield with cushioning to protect peripheral organs from the blast wave.",
    "NOTE: Control subjects are anesthetized and placed in proximity to the setup, but are not directly subjected to the blast wave. Ensure that the controls are subjected to the noise generated by the shock tube.\nPlace the head of the rodent within the head placement area and support it from below, either by a support built directly into the shielding apparatus or a gauze pad. Determine the head alignment according to each individual rodent’s anatomy, with the occipital condyle aligned with the edge of the protective shielding.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid directing the pressure wave directly towards the brainstem to decrease mortality. Injury to the respiratory center of the brainstem and the cervical spinal cord is known to contribute to breathing abnormalities and even death in rodent models of TBI36,37,38.\nExposure of rodents to blast wave.\n\t\nRapidly open the main valve of the compressed gas tank to produce a pressure spike that ruptures the membrane and produce a loud explosion that confirms the generation of a pressure wave. The membrane will be visually ruptured when removed after the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: A high-speed camera can be used to capture the coup and contrecoup effects of the rotational acceleration experienced by the rodent for further analysis.\nTurn off the gas flow immediately after hearing the explosion.\nRecovery from blast wave exposure\n\t\nAfter blast wave exposure, remove the rodent from the apparatus and place on a flat surface directly adjacent to the shock tube on their side.\nMonitor subjects to determine righting reflex time (RRT). Use a stopwatch to record time from blast wave exposure until they regain inherent righting reflex. (see Figure 4A).",
    "As soon as subjects regain their righting reflex, place them in their respective home cage where they are monitored for adverse reactions (i.e., seizures, difficulty breathing, bleeding from a bodily orifice) for the next 24 h.\nAfter the initial monitoring period, subjects can be analyzed using various biochemical, neuropathological, neurophysiological, and behavioral assays of researcher’s choosing (see below).\nPrepare setup and room for next experiment.\n\t\nClean setup with detergent to remove odor.\n4. Downstream applications for rodents exposed to blast wave/rotational forces and controls\nNOTE: In previous studies, the effects of mild to moderate TBI at various time points after exposure to a blast wave and rotational forces were assessed in rodents using downstream applications, including biochemical, neuropathological, neurophysiological, and behavioral analyses19.\nBiochemical analysis\n\t\nAt defined experimental time points (hours to days post-mild TBI), harvest tissue (e.g., brain, blood) for biochemical analysis using standard protocols as described19.\nUse tissue for biochemical analysis (i.e., immunoblotting, ELISA, etc.) to assess the effect of mild TBI on neurobiological and pathophysiological processes.\nNeuropathological analysis\n\t\nAt defined experimental time points (hours to days post-mild TBI), perfuse rodents transcardially with saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde solution to fix tissue as described19.\n\t\tNOTE: Some applications are not compatible with paraformaldehyde fixation (e.g., silver staining, some antibodies for immunohistochemistry).\nUse perfused, fixed tissue for anatomical, histological and molecular analyses to assess neuropathological changes associated with mild TBI, including neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and neurochemical changes as described19.\nNeurophysiological analysis in brain slices\n\t\nAt defined experimental time points (hours to days post-mild TBI), sacrifice rodents by decapitation, remove brain and prepare brain slices as described19.\nPerform electrophysiological recordings as described19 to assess the effect of mild TBI on basal synaptic properties and synaptic plasticity.\nBehavioral analysis",
    "At defined experimental time points (hours to days post-mild TBI), evaluate behavioral performance, including motor function (e.g., open field, rotarod, locomotor activity; see Figure 4D) and learning & memory (e.g., fear conditioning, Barnes maze, Morris water maze).\nSubscription Required.
