  "procedures": [
    "Part 1 : Purpose:\nTo demonstrate a capsulorhexis technique using predominantly shearing forces with a cystotome on a virtual reality simulator and on a human eye.\nPart 2 : Method:\nSteps:\nOur technique involves creating the initial anterior capsular tear with a cystotome to raise a flap.\nThe flap is then left unfolded on the lens surface.\nThe cystotome tip is tilted horizontally and is engaged on the flap near the leading edge of the tear.\nThe cystotome is moved in a circular fashion to direct the vector forces.\nThe loose flap is constantly swept towards the centre so that it does not obscure the view on the tearing edge.\nRe-engage the needle to the tearing edge frequently to create a suitably sized continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis.\nPart 3 : Results:\nOur technique has the advantage of reducing corneal wound distortion and subsequent anterior chamber collapse. The capsulorhexis flap is moved away from the tear leading edge allowing better visualisation of the direction of tear. This technique offers superior control of the capsulorhexis by allowing the surgeon to change the direction of the tear to achieve the desired capsulorhexis size."
