    "All mice experiments and procedures in the study were approved by Case Western Reserve University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The procedures were conducted in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) accredited facility. The BM was aspirated under a University Hospitals Institutional Review Board-approved protocol at the stem cell core facility at Case Western Reserve University after informed consent.\n1. Culture and Transduction of Human Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs)\nNOTE: The isolation of hMSCs is described in detail in previous publications15,20.\nCulture isolated hMSCs in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium-low glucose (DMEM-LG) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Culture the cells at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2 in T175 flasks with 25 mL of growth medium. Replace the medium every 3 - 4 days. On day 14, perform the primary passage of hMSCs.\n\t\nWhen the cells reach 80% confluence, completely remove the old medium and gently wash the cells with 5 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; for 75-cm tissue culture flasks).\nRemove the PBS from the flask and add 4 mL of 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Place the flask back in the incubator at 37 °C for 5 - 10 min. Keep the time of exposure as brief as possible.\nWhen the majority of cells have become well-rounded or have detached from the culture dish, stop the reaction by adding a volume of bovine calf serum equal to half the volume of trypsin.\nTransfer the cell suspension to an appropriate-size centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min and then carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL of medium (DMEM-LG + 10% FBS) and count the cells with a hemocytometer.",
    "NOTE: At this point, the cells can be subcultured or transduced with triple reporter.\nPerform the transduction of hMSCs with triple reporter.\n\t\nSeed 1.5 x 106 cells in one T175 flask. Culture the cells in 25 mL of growth medium at 37 °C, 95%, humidity and 5% CO2. Wait 24 h for the cells to attach.\nMake a virus cocktail in 15-mL tubes, as described in reference 18.\n\t\t\nThaw lentivirus at 37 °C in a water bath. Add 160 µL of a 5 mg/mL proteamine sulfate solution in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) to 8 mL of culture medium (DMEM-LG + 10% FBS) for a final concentration of 100 µg/mL. Vortex for 3 s. Add a virus multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 (1st time thawed).\nRemove the medium from the cell culture flask (step 1.2.1) and add the virus cocktail to the cells. Incubate for 10 h at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\nAdd 4 mL of 100 µg/mL proteamine sulfate in 4 mL of DMEM-LG + 10% FBS and incubate for an additional 14 h.\nStop the transduction after 24 h by replacing with 25 mL of medium (DMEM-LG + 10% FBS).\nConfirm transduction efficiency by evaluating mRFP expression by flow cytometry18.\n\tNOTE: Here, hMSCs that were transduced with over 65% efficiency were used.\nExpand the cells by replacing with 25 mL of fresh medium (DMEM-LG + 10% FBS) twice a week. Culture the cells at 37 °C, 95%, humidity and 5% CO2. Passage cells after they reach 80% confluence.\nOnce the desired number of cells is reached, perform trypsinization per steps 1.1.2 - 1.1.4.",
    "Count the cells and suspend them in sterile PBS (1x) in the final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/75 µL. Keep the cells on ice for transport to the ultrasound machine. For experiments, use hMSCs from passage numbers 2 - 5.\n2. Ultrasound-guided Intracardiac Injection of hMSCs into the Left Ventricle\nNOTE: Use SAMP1/YitFc with established small-intestinal inflammation and age- and gender-matched AKR/J mice for the experiments. Maintain the SAMP and AKR mice under specific pathogen-free conditions, feed them standard laboratory chow, and keep them on 12-h light/dark cycles. Here, the ultrasound-guided cardiac injections were performed in a dedicated pathogen-free cardiac ultrasound room located in the CWRU animal research facility that was sanitized with a disinfectant and rinsed with 70% alcohol. Laboratory research personnel must wear personal protective equipment, including gowns, face masks with eye shields, and sterile gloves during the intracardiac injections. The body heat of the mouse must be maintained for the duration of the procedure.\nSet up the ultrasound imaging system before anesthetizing the mouse. For this protocol, use the ultrasound machine designed for mouse echocardiogram.\n\t\nTurn on the power and initialize the transducer (30 MHz) to set up the new study.\nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber using 3 - 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a rate of 0.2 - 0.5 L/min. Maintain the animal for the whole procedure with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen via a nose cone. Confirm proper anesthetization prior to performing imaging by pinching the toe, rolling the mouse, and observing the absence of movement.",
    "NOTE: Ophthalmic ointment should be applied to the eyes following the induction of anesthesia to prevent corneal drying. Transfer the anesthetized mice to the imaging machines (i.e., bioluminescence imaging system and ultrasound), where they will receive a maintenance dose of anesthetic isoflurane. Determine the anesthesia start time and the depth of anesthesia by observing a lack of reaction to pinches on the tail and foot pad every 10 min for the entire duration of anesthesia.\nSet the temperature of the imaging table and ultrasound gel to 37 °C.\nCompletely remove the fur over the thorax area of the anesthetized mouse using hair removal cream.\nPlace the mouse on the imaging table in supine position and secure both the upper and lower limbs with adhesive tape to avoid body movement during the procedure. Use an electrocardiogram monitor during the procedure for all mice.\nClean the skin of the thorax area using a 10% povidone/iodine swab followed by a 70% ethanol swab. Apply a thick layer of gel to the thorax area of the mouse.\nMount the transducer in the holder and adjust its position until the left ventricle is clearly visible on the field of view.\nLoad 150 µL of transduced hMSC cell suspension (2 x 106 hMSCs in 150 µL of sterile PBS) into a 1-mL syringe with a 28-G needle and secure the syringe to the appropriate holder. To visualize pulsating blood, keep a small air column in the syringe. To avoid clumping, suspend the cells before the injection.\nAdvance the syringe towards the mouse thorax, adjust the needle trajectory using the ultrasound guidance, and enter the left ventricle.\nFollowing the guidance of the ultrasound imaging, penetrate the syringe needle through the intercostal space and into the left ventricle of the mouse.",
    "NOTE: The syringe needle tip should be clearly visible in the left ventricle on the ultrasonographic image. Proper placement should be further confirmed by fresh arterial blood outflow into the syringe. These are signs of a successful insertion.\nInject the hMSC cell suspension very slowly over 2 min, applying gentle pressure.\nFollowing the injection of suspended cells, gently withdraw the needle, clean off the ultrasound gel, and release the mouse from the tape restraints.\nPlace the animal in a new, clean cage with a preheated pad.\n\tNOTE: After the completion of the procedure, a warm environment should be provided to the mice until recovery. Over-heating should be avoided, since peripheral vasodilation compromises the recovery. The mice should be monitored closely and kept isolated from other mice until their full recovery, indicated by their ability to maintain sternal recumbency.\nMonitor the animal until they achieve complete recovery from the anesthesia and daily until the end of the experiment.\n3. Bioluminescence (BLI) Imaging of hMSCs\nImage the mice 24 h after the intracardiac injection in the bioluminescence imaging system. Start the in vivo imaging software. Initialize the imaging system and open a new study.\n\t\nIn the control panel, set the imaging parameters by clicking \"sequence setup.\" In the imaging mode, select \"luminescence\" and \"photograph.\" Set the exposure times from 0.5 s to 10 min. Set the binning to \"medium\" and the F/stop to \"1.\" Set the excitation filter to \"block\" and the emission filter to \"open.\" Set the field of view to \"C\" for two mice. Add the sequence setup to the image wizard by clicking on the acquisition control panel.\nSwitch on the oxygen pump and set the isoflurane to 2.5% in both the induction chamber and the nose cone inside the machine.",
    "Inject the mouse i.p. with 300 µL of D-Luciferin (12.5 mg/mL).\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia induction chamber.\n\t\nAfter 2 - 3 min, transfer the mouse into the in vivo imaging chamber, with its head in the nose cone on the anesthesia manifold. Apply optical ointment to protect the eyes during imaging. To image multiple mice, use black light baffle to prevent the reflection of light onto adjacent mice.\nClick the \"acquire\" button to start the image acquisition 10 min after D-Luciferin injection.\nRepeat steps 3.3 - 3.5 to image more mice.\nAfter the in vivo image acquisition, euthanize the mice by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, to confirm death. Perform the ex vivo analysis.\n\t\nIf the ex vivo analysis is performed after 20 min, repeat the luciferin injection (step 3.3) before sacrificing the mice; the BLI signal may decrease 20 min after the luciferin injection.\nDissect the mice to remove the whole gastrointestinal tract (i.e., from the stomach to the rectum), mesenteric lymph node (MLN), lungs, spleen, and liver. Place them in petri dishes using forceps and scissors2,4.\nPlace the petri dish containing the explanted organs in the imaging chamber and acquire BLI images per steps 3.1 - 3.6.\nAfter the image acquisition, transfer the explanted organs to specimen molds containing optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Cryofreeze the molds at -80 °C using dry ice. Perform immunohistochemistry using anti-luciferase antibody on frozen sections to confirm the presence of hMSCs16.",
    "For the quantification of light intensity, use the region of interest (ROI) tool in the tool palette16,19. Select the ROI frame and move it to region of interest on the image. Click \"ROI measurement\" and save the data in SEQ file format. Export the data as a .txt file and use statistical software to perform basic statistical tests for quantification16.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
