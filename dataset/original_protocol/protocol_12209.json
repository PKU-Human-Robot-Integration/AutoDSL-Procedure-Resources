    "All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Texas A&M University College of Dentistry.\n1. Animal Breeding\nUse three animal models in this study. To investigate the fate of the embryonic chondrocytes in condyle formation, first use Col10a1-Cre15 mice and cross them with Rosa26tdTomato (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J) mice to obtain Col10a1-Cre and Rosa26tdTomato mice. Next, cross these mice with 2.3Col1a1-GFP mice16. Use Col10a1-Cre; Rosa26tdTomato; 2.3Col1a1-GFP mice to perform the cell lineage tracing experiments (Figure 1B).\nTo study the fate of the postnatal chondrocytes, follow the same procedure as in step 1.1, but use the Aggrecan-creERT2 (Agg-CreERT2)17,18 line and keep the Agg-CreERT2; Rosa26tdTomato; 2.3Col1a1-GFP mice to perform the cell lineage tracing experiments (Figure 1C). Inject tamoxifen on postnatal day 14.\nTo combine the cell lineage tracing technique with immunofluorescence, cross Agg-CreERT2 mice and Rosa26tdTomato mice. Use mice that carry both genes in the experiment and inject the tamoxifen on postnatal day 3 (Figure 1D).\n2. Material Preparation\nDissolve the tamoxifen powder in 10% ethanol and 90% corn oil at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The dosage for injection is 75 mg/kg.\nDissolve the paraformaldehyde (PFA) powder in PBS to a concentration of 4%, using 2 M sodium hydrate to adjust the pH value to 7.4. Use 4% PFA solution to fix the tissue (the mandibular condyle and hind leg are used here) after sacrifice. Because of its toxicity, handle PFA in the hood with gloves and a facemask.\nDissolve the EDTA powder in distilled water to a concentration of 10%, using 2 M sodium hydrate to adjust the pH value to 7.4. Use 10% EDTA to decalcify the mandibular condyle and hind leg.\nDissolve sucrose powder in PBS at concentrations of 15% and 30%. Use the sucrose solution to dehydrate the tissue after decalcification.",
    "Dissolve the hyaluronidase powder in PBS at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, pH 5.0. This solution is for immunofluorescence antigen retrieval.\nUse a 1.5-ml tube to prepare a blocking solution that contains 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 20% goat serum in PBS for Runx2 or DMP1 immunofluorescent staining.\nUse a 1.5-ml tube to prepare a primary antibody solution that contains 2% goat serum in PBS for Runx2 or DMP1 immunofluorescent staining. The concentration of the primary antibody is 1:400 for Runx2 and 1:100 for DMP1.\nUse a 1.5-ml tube to prepare the rabbit IgG solution as the control for immunofluorescent staining to avoid false positive results. The solution contains 2% goat serum in PBS. The concentration of the rabbit IgG for Runx2 control is 1:400; for DMP1, 1:100. Perform the experiment and control staining simultaneously.\nUse a 1.5 ml tube to prepare a secondary antibody solution that contains 2% goat serum in PBS for Runx2 or DMP1 immunofluorescent staining. Use the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:500.\n3. Slide Preparation for Confocal Microscopy (Cell Lineage Tracing Only, No Combination with Immunofluorescence)\nInject tamoxifen in the Agg-creERT2 mice at a favorable time point.\n\t\nFirst, remove a mouse from its cage. Then, use the left thumb and index finger to grab the skin on the back of the mouse and turn it over, exposing the abdomen. Use the right hand to hold the syringe. The optimal entry point for injection is on the left or right side of hypogastrium, avoiding the liver and bladder.",
    "Keep the syringe parallel to the hind legs of the mouse and inject intraperitoneally. The dosage for injection is 75 mg/kg. The weights of the mice at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks old are approximately 7 - 9 g, 11 - 13 g, and 16 - 18 g, respectively.\nAnesthetize the mice with a Xylazine/Ketaset combination.\n\t\nTo prepare the working solution, first dilute the Xylazine and Ketaset with distilled water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml, respectively. Next, mix the Xylazine and Ketaset in a 1:2 ratio. The dosage for injection is 30 µl/g.\nInject as in step 3.1. Confirm the anesthetization by pinching the mouse's ankle. The mouse is unconscious if it has no reaction.\nPerfuse the mice with 4% PFA after anesthetization.\n\t\nAfter the mouse loses consciousness, fix the four legs of the mouse on a board to entirely expose the abdomen.\nSaturate the abdomen with 70% ethanol and make an excision from the lower abdomen to the neck along the middle line. Pinch and simultaneously pull the skin to the lateral sides to reveal the peritoneal membrane. Use dissection scissors to make a longitudinal excision.\nCut off and remove the front ribs to expose the heart. Puncture the heart from the left ventricle with a 22 G syringe, hold the syringe, and simultaneously cut a slot in the right auricle.\nSlowly inject the 4% PFA, which is perfused along the cardiovascular system while the blood flushes out of the cut from the right auricle. The volume of the PFA for perfusion is 1 ml/gram. Perform this step in a Class I biosafety cabinet that is hard-ducted to the building exhaust system.",
    "Peel off the mouse's skin and put the whole body into a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube that contains 40 ml of 4% PFA to fix overnight at 4 °C.\nUse dissection scissors and # 3 and # 5 forceps to carefully remove the mandible and hind leg from the body and to remove the muscles and tendons on the surface. Perform this step in a Class I biosafety cabinet that is hard-ducted to the building exhaust system.\nCut the mandible into two pieces at the distal region of the third molar. Similarly, cut the femur and tibia in the midshaft to expose the bone marrow cavity in order to accelerate decalcification. Put the part that includes the condyle and condylar process and along with the hind leg into 40 ml of 10% EDTA to decalcify at 4 °C for 2 - 4 days in a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube.\nUse 50 ml of 15% sucrose to dehydrate the condyle and hind leg overnight at 4 °C in a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube.\nUse 30% sucrose to dehydrate the condyle and hind leg overnight at 4 °C in a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube.\nAlong the sagittal plane, embed the sample with OCT on the cutting plate in the cryosection machine.\n\t\nHorizontally lay the condyle or the hind leg in the mounting mold. Submerge the tissue in OCT and leave it in the cryosection machine until the OCT freezes.\nMount the OCT block on the cutting plate. Wait for approximately 15 min before cutting to ensure that the OCT is completely frozen.\nCut the condyle and hind leg into 10-µm sections. Collect the sections on slides and store at -20 °C.\nIncubate the slide in a 37 °C chamber to remove the water before staining.",
    "Wash the slides twice with distilled water for 5 min.\nWipe off the water around each section. Use a hydrophobic barrier pen to circle the sections and drop DAPI or non-fluorescing anti-fade mounting solution into the circle. Carefully lay down the cover slip.\n4. Immunohistochemical Staining for Runx2 and DMP1\nNOTE: The IgG control is necessary for immunohistochemical staining to avoid false-positive signals. The staining for the experimental and control groups needs to be performed simultaneously.\nIncubate the slides in a 37 °C chamber to remove the water before staining.\nWash the slides twice with distilled water.\nUse the hydrophobic barrier pen to circle all the sections on the slide. From this step, add all of the prepared solution into the circle to completely cover the sections.\nTreat the sections with hyaluronidase in a humid chamber at 37 °C for 30 min. The volume of the solution (in steps 4.5 - 4.8) depends on the size of the section. Use 50 µl of solution for the condyle and 100 µl for the long bone. Wash with PBST (PBS that contains 0.1% Tween 20) three times.\nPrepare and apply the blocking solution to each section and incubate them in a humid chamber for 1 hr at room temperature.\nIncubate the sections with primary antibody solution (rabbit anti-mouse Runx2, or rabbit anti-mouse DMP1) at 4 °C overnight. Wash with PBS three times.\nIncubate the sections with secondary antibody solution (goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488) for 2 hr at room temperature. Wash with PBS three times.\nWipe off the water around the section and drop DAPI into the circle to cover the section on the slide. Carefully lay down the cover slip.\n5. Confocal Microscopy",
