    "NOTE: This protocol was adapted from MacKinnon and Taunton10 for use in live cells.\n1. Preparation of Cultured Cells\nPrepare sterile 6-cm cell culture dishes for the number of samples desired (see below).\n\tNOTE: One dish of cells is used per treatment condition, but if more protein is required 2 or 3 dishes can be prepared per condition and combined after UV irradiation.\n\t\nPrepare at least 3 dishes of cells; Negative control with DMSO only (D), Probe treatment only (P), and probe + competitor (C).\nOptionally, prepare a 4th dish as a no UV control, to be treated with probe but not subjected to UV light.\n\t\tNOTE: If multiple competitor molecules are to be tested, such as different analogs of the small molecule of interest, prepare additional competitor plates as necessary.\nAdd HEK293T cells to culture dishes in 4 ml culture media. Use 3.5 million cells per plate.\n\tNOTE: The number of cells should be determined for each cell type so that cells are almost 100% confluent at the beginning of the experiment, in order to achieve the maximum protein yield. For HUVEC, use 0.3 million cells per plate. A good approximation is 1/10 of the cells in a confluent 15 cm dish. HEK293T cells should be cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nReturn the cells to the culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) overnight.\n2. Treatment of Cells and Photocrosslinking\nThe next day, pre-aliquot the following drugs into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes:\n\t\nFor the first treatment, add 4 µl of DMSO to 2 tubes and 4 µl of 10 mM competitor (i.e., the unmodified parent compound) to 1 tube.",
    "For the second treatment, add 16 µl of DMSO to 1 tube and 16 µl of 50 µM photoaffinity probe to 2 tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal concentration may be different for different probes (see discussion), but between 200-500 nM is a good starting point (here we use 200 nM). The concentration of competitor should exceed that of the probe at least 20 fold (here we use 10 µM). The final concentration of DMSO should be equal in all plates and should not exceed 0.5% (20 µl volume).\nBring the cell plates into the cell culture hood and add the pre-aliquoted drugs from step 2.1.1 as follows: Aspirate 1 ml of culture media, resuspending the pre-aliquoted drug in the media, and gently adding it back to the plate drop wise. Add the DMSO to the DMSO (D) plate and the probe (P) plate, and add the competitor to the competition (C) plate. Return the plates to the culture incubator for 30 min.\nWith lights in the culture hood dimmed, add the pre-aliquoted probe from step 2.1.2 to probe (P) and competition (C) plates and add the DMSO to the DMSO (D) plate, as above. Return the plates to the culture incubator for 1 hr.\nDuring the incubation, prepare the following items; A tray of ice that can fit all of the plates; ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS [pH 8.5] + 1x protease inhibitor cocktail [complete EDTA-free, diluted from 50x stock solution made in water]; 200 µl/plate); microcentrifuge tubes labeled D, P, or C for each of the different treatment conditions, on ice.\n15 min before the end of the 1 hr incubation, set up the UV lamp (365 nm) in the cold room and turn it on to warm up the bulb.",
    "After 1 hr incubation with the probe, place dishes on ice. Wash the cells gently with 5 ml ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) to remove excess probe. Re-cover the cells with 4 ml ice-cold PBS.\nPlace the dish of cells centered 3 cm under the UV lamp on top of an ice pack to minimize heating from the lamp. Irradiate for 3 min. Remove the dish to the tray of ice and repeat for all samples.\nAfter irradiation, aspirate the PBS from the cells and add 200 µl of the ice-cold PBS (pH 8.5) with protease inhibitors to each plate. Detach the cells from the plate using a rubber scraper and transfer to the pre-labeled microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\nAdd SDS to a final concentration of 0.4% (10 µl of 10% SDS into 250 µl of sample).\n\tCAUTION: SDS powder is hazardous. Avoid inhaling SDS powder by wearing a mask over nose and mouth.\nLyse the cells by sonicating the suspension for 10 pulses (output 1, duty cycle 30%) and incubate on ice for 1 min before a second round of 10 pulses.\nIf needed, remove 2 µl of suspension and check under a light microscope to ensure complete cell lysis.\nBoil the samples on a hot plate set to 95 °C for 5 min to complete cell lysis and denature all the proteins.\nMeasure the protein concentration in each sample using a spectrophotometric detergent-compatible protein assay, such as the Dc protein assay19, according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a spectrophotometer set to measure absorbance at 750 nm.",
    "Normalize the protein concentration to 2.5 mg/ml (or if concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/ml, normalize to the sample with the lowest protein concentration) by adding PBS pH 8.5 + 0.4% SDS as needed (for example, if samples are 5 mg/ml in 250 µl, add 250 µl of PBS pH 8.5 + 0.4% SDS to obtain a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml).\n3. Attachment of Fluorescent Tag by Click Chemistry for Visualization of Labeled Proteins\nRemove 40 µl of the cell lysate and transfer to a new microcentrifuge tube. Keep the remaining lysates for reaction with biotin-azide (step 4).\nAdd the following reagents in order: 0.2 µl fluor-azide (1 mM stock solution in DMSO), 0.58 µl TCEP (100 mM stock in water with 4 equivalents NaOH added, prepared fresh), and 3.38 µl TBTA (1.7 mM stock in a 4:1 ratio of t-butanol to DMSO). Vortex to mix.\nAdd 1.14 µl CuSO4-5H2O (50 mM in water) to start the reaction. Vortex briefly and incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.\nAdd 50 µl of 2x SDS sample buffer to quench the reaction. At this point, run the samples directly on an SDS-PAGE gel20 for best results, or store at -20 °C overnight if necessary.\nIf freezing samples, reheat for 5 min at 95 °C before loading onto the gel.\n\tNOTE: Since the molecular weight of the target protein is typically not known at this stage, it is advisable to run 2 gels with different acrylamide concentrations (i.e., 8% and 15%), or a wide molecular weight range gradient gel (i.e., 4-15%), to ensure complete molecular weight coverage.",
    "When the dye front has reached the end of the gel, continue running the gel for an additional 5 min to ensure all of the excess unreacted fluor-azide has completely exited the gel.\nRemove the gel to a container with ddH2O and incubate for 10 min with gentle agitation, to wash away all excess fluor-azide.\nPlace the gel onto a glass plate and scan the gel using a Typhoon fluorescent gel scanner according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n4. Attachment of Biotin Tag by Click Chemistry for Affinity Purification of Labeled Proteins\nOf the remaining lysates from step 3.1, use the maximum amount after protein normalization such that all samples are the same volume (for example, if after normalization to 2.5 mg/ml the resulting sample volumes are 500, 550, and 600 µl, use 500 µl of each).\nPre-clear the lysates by adding to 50 µl high-capacity streptavidin agarose beads, pre-washed 2x with PBS (pH 7.4). Incubate 1 hr at 4 °C with rotation.\nPellet the beads by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube on ice and discard the beads.\nRemove 1-2% of the DMSO sample to a new tube labeled \"input\". Add an equivalent volume of 2x SDS sample buffer and store at -20 °C.\nPer 500 µl of lysate, add the following reagents: 1.38 µl biotin-azide (10 mM stock in DMSO), 5.5 µl TCEP, and 32.5 µl TBTA. Vortex to mix.\nAdd 11 µl CuSO4-5H2O per 500 µl of lysate and vortex briefly. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd 4 sample volumes of acetone chilled to −20 °C. Vortex the samples and incubate overnight at −80 °C to completely precipitate the proteins and remove unreacted biotin-azide.",
    "Centrifuge the samples at 17,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the precipitated proteins.\nAspirate the supernatant completely, and resolubilize the proteins by sonication in 150 µl PBS (pH 7.4) + 1% SDS.\nAdd 600 µl of PBS (pH 7.4) to dilute the concentration of SDS to 0.2%.\nAdd the samples to 30 µl pre-washed high-capacity streptavidin agarose beads and incubate 1 hr at 4 °C with rotation.\nPellet the beads by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 3 min. Aspirate the supernatant containing unbound proteins and discard.\nAdd 1 ml of wash buffer (400 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 0.2% SDS, pH 7.4) to the beads and incubate 5 min at room temperature with rotation.\nRepeat steps 4.12 and 4.13 3 times.\nAspirate the wash buffer completely from the beads, and add 30 µl of 2x SDS sample buffer.\nIncubate for 5 min on a 95 °C heat block to release the proteins from the beads.\nCentrifuge the beads for 1 min at 13,000 x g at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the samples can be stored at -20 °C until ready to run SDS-PAGE. If freezing samples, reheat for 5 min at 95 °C before use.\nCarefully pipette the sample buffer containing proteins off of the beads, and load onto SDS-PAGE20 (see important considerations below). The beads can be saved for reboiling later if necessary.",
    "NOTE: For protein detection by silver stain, better results are obtained using a 1 mm thick gel. If a band is to be cut out of the silver-stained gel for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, prepare all reagents fresh from sterile solutions and leave an empty well in between samples on the gel. For every band cut from the probe lane, a parallel slice should be taken from the DMSO lane so that background proteins can be subtracted. For validation of protein ID by western blot, it is critical to also load the input sample from step 4.4 when running the SDS-PAGE gel.\nFollow a standard protocol for either silver staining21 or Western blot22 to detect the target protein(s).\nSubscription Required.
