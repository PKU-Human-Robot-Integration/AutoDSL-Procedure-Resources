    "All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n1. Instrument settings and probe selection\nNOTE: Lung POCUS can be performed with a multitude of transducers depending on what question needs to be answered.\nSuperficial lung investigation\n\t\nFor the evaluation of abnormalities that have manifestations superficially (e.g., pneumothorax or pleural line abnormalities), perform lung POCUS using a linear high-frequency (5-10 MHz) probe, with the focal zone set at the pleural line. If a linear high-frequency probe is unavailable, perform superficial lung ultrasound using a low-frequency probe (see section 1.2), although the spatial resolution will be lower, which increases the chances of ambiguous or difficult-to-interpret findings.\nDeep lung investigation\n\t\nUse a low-frequency (≤5 MHz) ultrasound probe for the evaluation of anything deeper than the interface of the visceral and parietal pleurae. Ensure that the low-frequency probe has a footprint small enough to fit in between the rib spaces (e.g., a convex array, a micro-convex array, or a linear phased-array sector arc probe).\n\t\tNOTE: The linear phased-array sector arc probe is often colloquially referred to as a \"phased-array probe\". However, this term is misleading, because all modern ultrasound transducers (including linear high-frequency probes) use phasing to steer the ultrasound beam13,14. For the sake of brevity, the linear phased-array sector arc probe is referred to as a \"sector probe.\"\nPreset the machine as follows: abdomen (or lung if there is no abdomen option), varying depth (6-20 cm, depending on the object of interest), harmonic imaging disabled, and indicator to the left of the screen. Perform most of the study in a two-dimensional (2D), grayscale mode called brightness mode (B-mode).",
    "​NOTE: Other ultrasound modes such as motion mode (M-mode) and color doppler (CD) can occasionally provide additional information and may be used when screening for certain pathologic states.\n2. Patient positioning\nSupine versus sitting\n\t\nPerform the studies with the patient sitting up or supine.\nDelimitation of the imaging regions\n\t\nDivide each hemi-thorax into three regions, reflecting the anatomic segmentation of the lungs (Figure 115). In the left chest, treat the lingula as the left-sided analog of the right middle lobe.\n3. Scanning technique\nApply ultrasound gel to the transducer.\nScanning the right hemithorax\n\t\nR1: right upper lobe (anterior lung zone) (Figure 215)\n\t\t\nPlace the probe in the mid-clavicular line in the 1st-3rd intercostal spaces (ICSs). Position the probe in the parasagittal orientation, with the indicator mark pointing cranially.\nAxis: Center on the pleural line so that the cranial and caudal rib shadows are visible on the edges of the images.\nDepth: If the dominant pattern is A-lines (see \"Normal lung ultrasound findings\" in the representative results section) with ≤ two B-lines (see \"Pathologic lung POCUS findings\" in the representative results section), decrease the depth so that only a single A-line is visible. If there are >three B-lines, increase the depth until at least three A-lines are visible.\n\t\t\tNOTE: B-lines are vertical hyperechoic artifacts that arise from the pleural line, become wider from superficial to deep, reach the deepest visible portion of the ultrasound screen, and efface the A-lines where the two intersect.\nOverall gain: Adjust the gain until the pleural line and A-lines are visible as distinctly echogenic (bright) lines and the spaces between the pleural line and A-lines are hypoechoic (dark).\nClick on acquire.\nR2: right middle lobe (antero-lateral lung zone) (Figure 315)",
    "Place the probe in the anterior axillary line in the 4th-5th ICSs. Position the probe midway between the parasagittal and coronal orientations, with the indicator mark pointing cranially.\nAxis: See step 3.2.1.2.\nDepth: See step 3.2.1.3.\nOverall gain: See step 3.2.1.4.\nClick on acquire.\nR3: right lower lobe (posterior-lateral lung zone) (Figure 415)\n\t\t\nPlace the probe in the mid-to-posterior axillary line in the 5th-7th ICSs. Position the probe in the coronal plane with the indicator mark pointing cranially.\nAxis: Center on the diaphragm such that both the sub-diaphragmatic and supra-diaphragmatic structures are visible at the same time.\nDepth: Increase the depth until the sub-diaphragmatic spine is visible.\nOverall gain: Increase the gain until the liver/spleen appears slightly hyperechoic.\nClick on acquire.\nScanning the left hemithorax\n\t\nL1: left upper lobe (anterior lung zone)\n\t\t\nProbe positioning: See step 3.2.1.1.\nAxis: See step 3.2.1.2.\nDepth: See step 3.2.1.3.\nOverall gain: See step 3.2.1.4.\nClick on acquire.\nL2: lingula of the left upper lobe (lateral lung zone)\n\t\t\nProbe positioning: See step 3.2.2.1.\nAxis: See step 3.2.1.2.\nDepth: See step 3.2.1.3.\nOverall gain: See step 3.2.1.4.\nClick on acquire.\nL3: left lower lobe (postero-lateral lung zone)\n\t\t\nProbe positioning: See step 3.2.3.1.\nAxis: See step 3.2.3.2.\nDepth: See step 3.2.3.3.\nOverall gain: See step 3.2.3.4.\nClick on acquire.\nSubscription Required.
