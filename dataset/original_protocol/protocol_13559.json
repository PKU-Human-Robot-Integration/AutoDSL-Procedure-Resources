    "The local ethical committee at the tertiary referral center for MRKHS (IRCCS San Raffaele University Hospital, Milan, Italy) was notified and approved the protocol before its implementation in July 2017. All patients or guardians gave signed informed consent for laparoscopic oocyte retrieval and cryopreservation during vaginoplasty and for the use of anonymized clinical/laboratory data for scientific purposes.\n1. Team composition\nDesignate a dedicated team, composed of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, an experienced vaginal surgeon, an infertility expert, a dedicated psychologist, and a committed nurse.\nAssist the patient as a team during the whole setup and performance of the procedure.\n2. Diagnostic work-up and counseling\nPerform transabdominal pelvic and abdominal ultrasonography on the patient for visualization of the ovaries and estimation of the Antral Follicle Count (AFC). Assess blood levels of anti-Müllerian-hormone (AMH) to optimize the gonadotrophin starting dose for controlled ovarian stimulation. Perform serological tests for infectious diseases (HIV-Ab, HCV-Ab, HBV-Ab, RPR-TPHA) according to national/local protocols for cryopreservation of tissues/gametes.\nCounsel the patient about both the sexual and reproductive aspects of MRKHS, including nonsurgical and surgical vaginoplasty, the costs and legislation related to surrogacy, the perspective of uterine transplantation in the context of an experimental program, the different approaches available for oocyte retrieval and the performance of oocyte cryopreservation in terms of live-birth rates.\nOffer the patient psychological evaluation to support her through the procedure and assess emotional stability and commitment and desire for future motherhood. Obtain signed, informed consent for concomitant laparoscopic oocyte retrieval, gamete cryopreservation, and laparoscopic vaginoplasty. In the case of an underage patient, perform the clinical assessments in the presence of the parents who also sign the relative informed consent.\n3. Scheduling of the surgical procedure and of controlled ovarian stimulation",
    "Schedule the procedure of concomitant laparoscopic oocyte retrieval, gamete cryopreservation, and laparoscopic vaginoplasty, taking into account the availability of the clinical team (see above) as well as that of the lab staff performing oocyte vitrification.\nStart controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) on day -14 from the day of surgery, taking into account a planned duration of COS of n = 12 days and the 36 h needed between ovulation triggering and oocyte retrieval and vitrification.\nIn case COS requires a different duration from the expected, reschedule the surgery accordingly.\n4. Controlled ovarian stimulation: starting dose, dose adjustments and monitoring, final oocyte maturation triggering\nStart COS in any phase of the ovarian cycle, as commonly done in the context of \"random start\" protocols for fertility preservation.\nChoose the starting dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)/human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) based on the patient's AFC and AMH, and instruct the patient to continue daily self-administered subcutaneous injections. Perform individualized dose adjustments subsequently based on the ovarian response.\nMonitor ovarian response by serial transabdominal ultrasound and concomitant measurements of E2 and P (day 1, day 6, day 8, day 10, and day 12).\nTrigger final oocyte maturation by subcutaneous administration of 0.2 mL of a Gn-RH-analog (Triptorelin).\n5. Clinical procedure (laparoscopy): oocyte retrieval\nPosition the patient in modified dorsal lithotomy position, which allows excellent simultaneous access to the abdomen and perineum. Induce general anesthesia and administer 2 g of Cefazolin intravenously as per routine intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Position an intravesical Foley catheter.",
    "Establish pneumoperitoneum with a peri-umbilical Veress needle, position one 10 mm umbilical trocar for insertion of the laparoscope and two 5 mm trocars in the right and left upper quadrants. Under laparoscopic vision, use a 17 G single lumen needle connected to an aspiration pump, as commonly employed for transvaginal retrieval, through the right and left trocars for puncture of the right and left ovary, respectively.\nLift and hold the ovaries with laparoscopic forceps to facilitate exposure of the follicles. When aspirating multiple follicles that are one close to another, retain the needle tip in the ovary to reduce the number of times that the ovarian cortex is transfixed and the inherent risk of bleeding.\n6. Clinical procedure (laparoscopy): vaginoplasty\nNOTE: Vaginoplasty steps remain unchanged compared to the Davydov's laparoscopic modified technique12.\nDissect the peritoneum by lifting and incising the peritoneal strand transversally between the two rudimental uterine horns, and then extending the incision anteriorly, laterally, and posteriorly.\nBegin a purse-string suture in polydioxanone synthetic absorbable (PDS) 2-0 monofilament in each hemipelvis, from the mobilized peritoneum above the bladder, with consecutive transfixion of the round ligament, the tubal isthmus, the uteroovarian ligament, and the lateral peritoneal leaf. Then, include in the two sutures the lateral aspect of the mesorectum and the anterior aspect of the rectal serosa, immediately below the rectosigmoid junction.\nExpose the vaginal dimple on the perineal approach and perform an H-shaped incision, and create a neovaginal space by sharp and blunt dissection of the vesicorectal space. Then, pull down the dissected peritoneal margins to the edge of the vaginal vestibulum. Position interrupted sutures in PDS 3-0 for the peritoneal-vestibular anastomosis. Lastly, place a paraffin coated gauze in the peritoneum-coated neovagina.\n7. IVF laboratory: the day before the oocyte retrieval",
    "Prepare 2 to 5 round-bottom tubes with 9 mL of Quinn's Advantage Medium with HEPES (supplemented with 5% human serum albumin [HSA]) according to the number of expected follicles and incubate them overnight at 37 °C.\nPrepare one or two 4-well dishes with 0.5 mL/well of Fertilization Medium (supplemented with 5% HSA), covered with 0.5 mL of mineral oil for embryo culture and incubate it overnight at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (6% CO2, 5% O2).\nPrepare one dish containing 9 (30 µL) drops of Continuous Single Culture (CSCM) medium (supplemented with 10% serum substitute supplement [SSS]) covered with 6 mL of mineral oil. Incubate it overnight at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (6% CO2, 5% O2).\n8. IVF laboratory: oocyte retrieval procedure\nPrepare a solution of Quinn's Advantage Medium with HEPES (supplemented with 5% HSA) with heparin at a final concentration of 10 IU/mL in which follicular aspirates will be collected.\nSimilar to routine transvaginal oocyte retrieval13, collect the follicular aspirates in 10 mL round-bottom tubes, kept warm (37 °C) in a portable incubator and immediately transported to the embryology laboratory, with a transportation time of approximately 10 min.\nExamine the follicular fluid in a prewarmed sterile 90 mm Petri dish to identify cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC). Once a COC is detected, rinse it in a central-well dish filled with 1 mL of prewarmed Quinn's Advantage Medium with HEPES (supplemented with 5% HSA).\nAs all the COCs are collected, place them into the 4-well dish containing the Fertilization Medium and label the lid and the bottom with data relating to the patient's identity.\nIncubate them at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (6% CO2, 5% O2).\nEnsure that a double-checking of the procedure is performed by a second member of the laboratory staff.\n9. Oocyte denudation",
    "Perform cumulus/corona cells removal within 38 h post ovulation trigger.\nPrepare a solution of Quinn's Advantage Medium with HEPES (supplemented with 5% HSA) with Hyaluronidase at a final concentration of 10 IU/mL.\nPrepare a central-well dish with 1 mL of prewarmed Quinn's Advantage Medium with HEPES (supplemented with 5% HSA) containing Hyaluronidase and another one with 1 mL of prewarmed HEPES-buffered medium (supplemented with 5% HSA).\nLabel the oocyte denudation dishes with patient identification data.\nPlace COCs in the central-well containing the enzyme to disperse the cumulus cells with a glass Pasteur pipette, gently pipetting the solution containing COCs up and down for up to 30 s.\nMove the oocytes to the second central-well dish containing only HEPES-buffered medium, making sure to displace a minimum amount of the enzyme.\nRemove the remaining corona cells using denuding pipettes with decreasing inner diameters (170-140 µm).\nAssess the stage of oocyte maturation, separating metaphase II (MII) oocytes, characterized by the extrusion of the first polar body, from metaphase I oocytes (MI) and germinal vesicles (GV).\nTransfer the MII oocytes in an IVF culture 60 mm Petri dish containing nine (30 µL) drops of Continuous Single Culture (CSCM) medium (supplemented with 10% serum substitute supplement [SSS]) covered with 6 mL of mineral oil.\nIncubate them at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (6% CO2, 5% O2).\n10. Oocyte vitrification\nPerform vitrification of MII oocytes immediately after oocyte denudation, following the protocol provided by the vitrification kit's manufacturer.\nBring to room temperature (25-27 °C): the equilibration solution (ES), the vitrification solution (VS), and the washing solution (WS), nearly 30 min before the procedure.",
    "NOTE: As reported by the manufacturers, ES contains 7.5% DMSO, 7.5% ethylene glycol, 20% dextran serum supplement (DSS), Gentamicin in M-199 HEPES-buffered Medium; VS contains 15% DMSO, 15% ethylene glycol, 0.5 M sucrose, 20% DSS, Gentamicin in an M-199 HEPES-buffered Medium, and WS contains 20% DSS, Gentamicin in an M-199 HEPES-buffered Medium.\nFor a cryodevice, use Cryotop consisting of a fine strip of transparent film attached to a plastic handle.\nLabel the cryodevices with the patient's name, date of birth, ID, date of cryopreservation, and number of oocytes loaded on any single device.\nLabel the vitrification dish with the patient's name and ID.\nEnsure that a witness operator checks the correct patient data on the cryodevices and dish.\nFill a cooling box up to the top with fresh liquid nitrogen and cover until use to minimize dispersion and evaporation.\nUse a stripper pipette with an inner diameter of 170 µm to avoid damaging oocytes during manipulation.\nGently shake each vial of ES, VS, and WS to mix the contents before use.\nPrepare the lid of a 60 mm Petri dish with one drop of 50 µL of WS1 (Figure 1A).\nPlace drops just before use to limit medium evaporation.\nTake the oocyte dish from the incubator and transfer the MII oocytes (up to 3 at a time) with minimal volume of medium from the culture dish into the 50 µL of WS.\nDispense 50 µL drops of WS2, ES1, and ES2 in close proximity and transfer oocytes from drop WS1 into drop WS2 (Figure 1B).\nMerge the drop of ES1 to WS2 and wait for 2 min for the spontaneous mixing of both the solutions.\nThen, merge the drop of ES2 to the previously merged drops and leave for further 2 min.",
    "Finally, merge a new 100 µL drop of ES3 to the previously merged drops and leave for 1 additional minute.\nPlace the oocytes into a 100 µL drop of ES4 for 10 min (Figure 1C).\nDispense two 50 µL drops of VS and one 100 µL of VS (Figure 1D).\nMove the oocytes sequentially into the three drops of VS for 60 s so that the oocytes remain in each drop for ~20 s.\nWhen approximately 10 s are left before the end of the 60 s of incubation, place the cryodevice under the microscope.\nCarry the oocytes at the tip of the pipette and place them on the cryodevice with the minimum amount of VS.\nAspirate the excess of VS, leaving the oocytes covered by a thin layer of VS.\nPlunge the cryodevice directly into liquid nitrogen and move it rapidly. Keep the device in liquid nitrogen and cover it with the protective lid.\nStore the cryodevice in a storage system (e.g., visiotube) and place it in the cryogenic tank. Record cryopreservation data on the laboratory database and sheet.\n11. Inpatient postoperative care\nRemove the urinary catheter and vaginal paraffin-coated gauze 48 h after surgery.\nDigitally explore the patients' neovagina after the removal and instruct the patient on how to perform the digital exploration. Then, coat a vaginal mold (9 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter) with estrogen gel (to favor epithelialization) and instruct the patient on how to insert and maintain the mold.\nStarting on day 3 post surgery and on each following day, instruct the patient on how to position the mold and maintain it in place for at least 2 h daily.\nIf no complications occur, discharge the patient on day 5-6 post surgery.\n12. Outpatient postoperative care",
    "Instruct the patient on how to perform neovaginal dilation for 2 months with the same mold (9 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter) used during the hospital stay, and then a larger one (11 cm in length and 2.5 cm in diameter).\nAfter the 3 months' visit, allow the patient to begin sexual activity and inform her to keep using the molds on the days when there is no intercourse.\n13. Follow-up\nSchedule follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post procedure.\nAt each follow-up visit, assess compliance with dilation exercises and ask the patient whether she has experienced any limitation to her daily life activities, pain, urinary symptoms, or sexual dysfunction (as of the visit after the third month post surgery). Perform gynecological examination at each follow-up visit to measure vaginal width, length, suspension, and mobility of the adnexa.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
