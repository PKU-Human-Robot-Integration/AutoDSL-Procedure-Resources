    "All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina (assurance number: A3049-01).\n1. Low-density Embryonic Neuronal Culture\nPreparation for primary cortical neuron culture\nSolutions:\n\t\t\nPrepare Poly-L-Lysine stock solution by dissolving 5 mg of Poly-L-Lysine in 10 ml Borate buffer.\nPrepare working solution by diluting 1 ml Poly-L-Lysine Stock in 49 ml Borate Buffer.\nPrepare borate Buffer, pH 8.4 by starting with 395 ml dH2O and then adding all ingredients (1.24 g boric acid + 1.9 g of Borax). Adjust pH to 8.4 by 1 M NaOH. Adjust to 400 ml and filter with 0.2 µm nylon membrane filter under hood.\nPrepare HBSS solution, pH 7.2 by starting with 445 ml dH2O and adding all other ingredients (50 ml 10X HBSS Stock + 1.2 g HEPES). Adjust pH to 7.2 by 1 N HCl, bring to 500 ml and filter with 0.2 µm nylon membrane filter under hood.\nPrepare plating medium: DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Filter with 0.2 µm nylon membrane filter under hood.\nPrepare complete growth medium: To 50 ml Neurobasal medium, add the supplements (500 µl GlutaMax (100X) + 500 µl Glucose + 1 ml B-27 (50X) + 500 µl of Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (100X) + 100 µl 7.5% Sodium Bicarbonate. Filter with 0.2 µm nylon membrane filter under hood.\nTwo days before culture:\n\t\t\nCoat twelve 35 mm glass-bottom dishes with 2 ml of Poly-L-Lysine working solution, and keep under the hood O/N.\nOne day before culture:\n\t\t\nEmpty coating agent from the dishes and rinse with ddH2O. Allow dishes to dry for an hour under hood.\nPrepare plating medium (DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (10% of total solution). Pipette 2 ml medium into each dish, and incubate O/N at 37 oC, 5% CO2.",
    "Note: It is important to avoid plastic culture dishes when culturing. Use of glass-bottom dishes (for inverted microscopes) or glass coverslips (for upright microscopes) yields sharp and clear images. Compared to a plastic-bottom dish, the glass-bottom dish avoids unwanted hues or glare during fluorescent microscopy.\nCell culture protocol:\nPut refrigerated HBSS Buffer (100-150 ml), 100 mm petri dishes, forceps, scissors, 50 ml tubes, and 15 ml tubes under UV light in hood.\nEuthanize pregnant rat with lethal inhalation of 5% sevoflurane under the hood outside of culture room.\nSterilize with 70% EtOH, tent the skin of the lower abdomen using forceps while cutting from the tail up in the middle of abdominal cavity.Open the uterus using scissors to expose the placenta.\nRemove 8-10 E18 fetuses. Place 8-10 fetuses in petri dishes containing HBSS solution.\nHold the back of the head of the fetus with forceps, then use scissors to sever the head from body. Place it in another petri dish filled with 5-7 ml of HBSS. Transfer dish to hood.\nFill two additional 100 mm petri dish with cold HBSS.\nPeel aside skull, and scoop brain into a new petri dish filled with HBSS.\nUse sharp curved forceps, separate cerebellum and brain stem from brain, then transfer brain to a new petri dish with cold HBSS in it.\nUse tweezers to secure, separate the hemispheres with curved forceps. Remove meninges; isolate frontal cortex and transfer pieces into marked 15 ml centrifuge tubes.\nFill the 15 ml tube with fresh 2 ml HBSS and add 20 µl Trypsin EDTA (10x concentrated mixture with 0.5% Trypsin and 5.3 mM EDTA.) to each 15 ml tube.\nIncubate 10-15 min at RT. Gently swirl tube every few minutes, do not allow settling.",
    "After 10-15 min, use glass pipette to remove old HBSS and rinse twice with new HBSS.\nImmerse in trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml, 2 mg Trypsin inhibitor in 2 ml HBSS), mix well and let it sit 5 min. Wash twice with fresh HBSS.\nUsing glass pipette with rubber bulb, triturate brain pieces 10-15 times very slowly so as to avoid bubbles.Triturate again using a calibrated pipette and a sterile tip with a reduced tip diameter very slowly until homogeneous.\nTransfer dissociated cells at desired density to pre-prepared coated culture dishes (50 cells/mm2). Incubate O/N at 37 oC, 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 hr, replace DMEM/F12 medium with freshly made complete growth serum-free Neurobasal medium.\nMaintain the cells at all times in a 5% CO2/95% room air humidified incubator for at least 12-14 days before experimentation. Supplement the cells every 5-6 days with fresh Neurobasal medium replacing approximately 50% of the old medium.\n2. Fluorescent Labeling and Immunocytochemistry\nNote: The immunofluorescent labeling of primary cortical cell cultures was carried out in glass bottom 35 mm cell culture dishes with a working volume of 1 ml.\nWash the glass-bottom dish twice with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS).\nFix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT.\nWash cells twice with PBS and permeabilize with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min.\nTreat cells for 20 min at RT with an F-actin specific stain, AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin (1:40, 25 µl of Phalloidin in 1 ml PBS).\nRinse cells twice with PBS and block with 10% normal goat serum at RT for 1-2 hr.\nDilute the chicken polyclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (1:2,500) in PBS with 2% normal goat serum and incubate O/N at 4 oC.\nFollowing incubation, rinse in PBS twice.",
    "Dilute the secondary antibody (Alexa Red 594-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (1:500) with 2% normal goat serum and incubate for 2 hr at RT.\nRinse with PBS and add 10 µl/dish of Hoescht dye.\nIncubate 3 min at RT and wash with PBS twice.\n\tNote: The labeled cells now ready for step 3 (F-actin puncta counting).\nPreserve cell sample with 100 µl of antifade reagent as a coverslipping agent and keep at 4 oC in the dark for long term storage.\nNote: Phalloidin is relatively stable in PBS at +4 °C in the dark for up to 1 week and fluorescence can be preserved with antifade coverslipping reagents. However, optimal images are obtained from 1-3 days after staining since Phalloidin may start to diffuse out with extended storage.\n3. F-actin Puncta Counting\nTurn on fluorescent microscope and switch to 20× objective. Open microscope software, and set up program at 1280×960 pixel image size, and 0.17 µm/pixel image resolution at 1× zoom.\nAcquire images of co-labeled F-actin/MAP2 neurons under green (495 nm)/red (613 nm) fluorescent channels.\nChoose 5 Green (F-actin)/Red (MAP2) immunolabeled/Blue (Hoescht) fluorescent images of individual neuron with clearly defined dendritic arbors.\nIdentify the F-actin rich structures in second order dendritic segment (length range 25-75 µm) with continuous MAP2 immunofluorescence.\nRotate the selected region of images to a horizontal level. Copy and paste as a new image.\nSubtract the background of images, using a consistent adjustments for each dish.\nCount the bright green F-actin puncta and trace the length of selected dendritic segment manually by trained independent observers. Export the data to a spreadsheet file.\nCalculate the density by dividing total F-actin labeled puncta (N) by the length (L) of the MAP2 labeled dendrites. Express data as number of F-actin puncta per 10 µm of dendrite",
    "Note: Puncta (size ≤1.5 µm) of F-actin fluorescence with a peak intensity of at least 50% above the average intensity of staining in the dendritic shaft were included in each selected dendritic segment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
