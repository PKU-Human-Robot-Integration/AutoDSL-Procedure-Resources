    "All methods described here were approved by the Landesdirektion Dresden (Permit numbers: AZ 24D-9168.11-1/2008-1, AZ 24-9168.11-1/2011-52, AZ 24-9168.11-1/2013-5, AZ 24-9168.11-1/2013-14, AZ DD24.1- 5131/354/87).\n1. Preparation of Materials and Solutions\nNOTE: Prednisolone, like other glucocorticoids, leads to immunosuppression. Thus, precaution must be taken to prevent infection in treated animals during the experiment. To this end, autoclave glass ware and 'fish water' (i.e., the water that is used to rear adult zebrafish) before starting the experiment.\nCalculate the number of zebrafish to be used in the experiment. Be sure to include the individuals that serve as controls.\nAutoclave 600 mL glass beakers that are covered with aluminum foil with autoclave tape. Zebrafish will be treated individually, thus 1 glass beaker is required per zebrafish.\nCalculate the amount of fish water needed for the experiment. 300 mL are required per individual and day. Take into consideration the length of the experiment (e.g., 1 week/7 days).\nFill glass bottles with fish water, close them and autoclave the bottles with autoclave tape. Ideally, use 2 L bottles, but other bottles like 1 L or 5 L can be used as well.\n\tNOTE: If experiments are long (e.g., 4 weeks/28 days) and the amount of glass bottles is limited, make sure to prepare bottles for a minimum of several days at a time and repeat the process (1.3 to 1.4) throughout the experiment.\nPrepare a prednisolone stock solution of sterile-filtered 100 mM prednisolone in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Freeze the stock in 1 mL or 2 mL microcentrifuge tube aliquots.\n\tCAUTION: Always wear protective clothing when working with prednisolone (protective gloves, safety goggles, lab coat).",
    "On the first day of the experiment, prepare incubation solutions with prednisolone and DMSO, respectively. To this end, thaw the required amount of 100 mM prednisolone stock solution and add prednisolone to autoclaved fish water at a final concentration of 50 µM.\n\t\nFor the control treatments, add the corresponding volume of DMSO to autoclaved fish water. As an example, to produce 2 L prednisolone containing fish water, add 1 mL of 100 mM prednisolone stock to 2 L fish water. In another 2 L bottle of fish water, add 1 mL DMSO, correspondingly.\nWork in an appropriate place that is designated to perform drug treatments, ideally in a room at 27 °C.\n2. Generation of Injuries in Zebrafish Fins\nNOTE: To injure bone in zebrafish fins, perform resection of the fin (amputation, usually in the caudal fin) or fracture individual bony fin rays (fracture model). To this end anaesthetize adult zebrafish first.\nAmputation\n\t\nTo anaesthetize adult zebrafish, prepare a 100 mm diameter Petri dish containing 0.02% MS-222 (Ethyl-3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate) in fish water (this water does not need to be autoclaved).\n\t\t\nTransfer one zebrafish at a time to the MS-222 containing Petri dish by using a fish net and incubate it until it lies on its side without movement and does not respond to touch. Test the latter by touching the anal fin with blunt forceps.\nWait until level 4 of anesthesia is reached which is the appropriate level for fin resection12. At this stage, the rate of opercular movement is decreased, muscle tone is lost and the fish does not move upon touch12.",
    "Take blunt forceps and transfer the anaesthetized zebrafish carefully to the inversed lid of the 100 mm Petri dish. Place the zebrafish on its lateral side. Make sure the zebrafish always lie in the same orientation, for example on their right body side. With a scalpel or a razor blade, resect 50% of the fin (Figure 1A, 2A).\n\t\tNOTE: The speed of zebrafish fin regeneration depends on the amount of resected fin tissue, i.e., the more fin tissue is resected, the faster the fin regenerates13. Thus, to minimize variations in fin regeneration make sure to always resect the fin at the same level in all zebrafish.\nTransfer the injured zebrafish to an autoclaved glass beaker containing 300 mL of prednisolone or DMSO containing autoclaved fish water. Cover the glass beaker with aluminum foil to avoid escape of the zebrafish.\nRepeat steps 2.1.2 to 2.1.3 until the required number of zebrafish for the experiment is reached.\nFin fracture\n\t\nPrepare an agarose-coated 100 mm Petri dish by heating a 2% agarose solution in fish water or E3 (embryo media 3, 50 mM sodium chloride, 0.17 mM potassium chloride, 0.33 mM calcium chloride, 0.33 mM magnesium sulfate). Carefully pour roughly 10–15 mL of the solution into the Petri dish. The bottom of the dish should be completely covered. Let the agarose solidify.\nAnaesthetize zebrafish as described in section 2.1.\nTake blunt forceps and transfer the anaesthetized zebrafish carefully to the agarose-coated 100 mm Petri dish. Place the zebrafish on its lateral side. Under the dissection microscope, spread the caudal fin completely to be able to identify distinct bony fin rays and fin ray segments. Make sure the zebrafish always lie in the same orientation, for example on their right body side.",
    "With an injection needle (0.3 mm x 13 mm) introduce a fracture in the center of a bony fin ray segment (Figure 1B). To do this, the needle is pushed slightly onto the segment until a crack appears (arrow in Figure 2B). While gentle pressure leads to fracture of only one of the two opposing hemirays stronger pressure will lead to fracture of both hemiray segments.\n\t\t\nDo not introduce too many fractures in fins, since this will greatly impair stability of the fin. As a suggestion, apply fractures only in 3 to 5 fin rays.\nAlways produce fractures in corresponding segments across different fin rays and zebrafish, for example in dorsal fin rays 3, 7 (or 8) and ventral fin ray 3. The proximal-distal level of fracture is ideal at 3 segments proximal to the fin rays' bifurcation point 11.\nTransfer the injured zebrafish to an autoclaved glass beaker containing 300 mL of prednisolone or DMSO containing autoclaved fish water. Cover the glass beaker with aluminum foil to avoid escape of the zebrafish.\nRepeat steps 2.2.2 to 2.2.5 until the required number of zebrafish for the experiment is reached.\n3. Generation of Calvarial Skull Injuries (Trepanation)\nNOTE: The calvariae in zebrafish are homologous to calvarial bones in mammals. Thus, these exoskeletal bones14 represent a tissue of special interest when studying the pathogenesis of GIO. To injure the skull, trepanation is performed by drilling a hole in the Os frontale and/or Os parietale (Figure 1C, 2C) with the help of a microdrill11.\nAnaesthetize the zebrafish according to section 2.1.\nHold the anesthetized zebrafish upright with forceps, so that the calvarial bones are well visible under a dissection microscope from above (Figure 1C).",
    "Locate the rotating microdrill on the center of the frontal bone (Os frontale) and touch the bone. The produced hole is of the size of the microdrill burr (500 µm, Figure 2C, Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: Be sure to not move the microdrill laterally while producing the injury. Also stop immediately when the resistance of the bone suddenly drops. Do not drill any further, otherwise the brain will be damaged 15.\nTransfer the injured zebrafish to a cage filled with fish water until it fully recovers from anesthesia. Watch it carefully.\nTransfer the injured zebrafish to a fish water plus prednisolone or DMSO containing glass beaker.\n4. Treatment of Zebrafish During Incubation\nNOTE: During application of prednisolone/DMSO, the drug containing fish water needs to be changed daily, and zebrafish need to be fed regularly.\nWater changes\n\t\nTo exchange the fish water, thaw 100 mM prednisolone stock and prepare the required amount of 50 µM prednisolone in autoclaved fish water fresh every day of the treatment period. Prepare DMSO containing fish water for the control zebrafish accordingly.\nTake a glass beaker containing a single housed zebrafish in its incubation solution and transfer the solution including the zebrafish into an appropriate container, for example a temporal housing cage.\n\t\tNOTE: Always use separate interim containers for prednisolone and DMSO treated zebrafish, respectively, to make sure DMSO control zebrafish do not get exposed to prednisolone and vice versa.\nRefill the glass beaker with fresh drug containing fish water (300 mL).\nTransfer the zebrafish from the interim container to the glass beaker containing fresh incubation solution using a fish net. Put back the foil to avoid escape of the zebrafish.\nIf the time of the experiment exceeds 2 weeks, exchange the glass beakers.\nFeeding",
    "During short treatments (for up to 2 days) do not feed zebrafish. During longer experiments, feed zebrafish. Take special care to avoid pollution of the incubation solution. Thus, feed with Artemia ssp. rather than with flake food, and only on every second day.\n\t\tNOTE: Artemia are regularly used to feed young zebrafish, and should be available in the zebrafish haltering unit.\n\t\t\nRoughly 2 h before the fish water is exchanged, feed zebrafish with Artemia ssp in their glass beakers. To do so, use a plastic pipette and feed 0.5 to 1 mL of hatched Artemia solution per glass beaker.\nWait for 2 h and exchange the incubation solution with fresh drug containing fish water according to section 4.1.\n5. Analyses of Samples\nNOTE: After incubation of injured zebrafish in prednisolone and DMSO containing fish water, respectively, either perform bone mineralization/calcification analyses (5.1 to 5.3) or carry out live imaging of zebrafish under the dissection microscope (5.4)10,11,16. Use live imaging to determine fin regenerate length and to detect differences in reporter gene expression in transgenic zebrafish.\nFixation of tissues of interest\nFor fixation of fins and/or skulls prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and freeze at -20 °C for storage. Use freshly prepared 4% PFA in PBS or thaw the required amount before use. Alternatively, 2% PFA in PBS can be used.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and should be handled carefully under a fume hood. Wear protective clothing.\nFor fixation of fins prepare a small Petri dish (e.g., 30 mm) with cold 4% PFA in PBS and make sure that the bottom of the dish is fully covered. For fixation of skulls, prepare a little glass jar with lid or a tube with cold 4% PFA in PBS.",
    "CAUTION: Handle PFA containing solutions only under the fume hood as it is toxic. Wear protective clothing.\nHarvest the tissue of interest.\n\t\t\nTo harvest regenerating fin tissue or fins with fractures anaesthetize the zebrafish according to section 2.1 or euthanize the zebrafish according to section 5.1.5.\nTransfer the anaesthetized zebrafish to the lid of a Petri dish. By using a scalpel or razor blade, harvest the fin regenerate. Make sure to include stump tissue in regenerating fins to facilitate handling of the harvested tissue.\nFix fins flat in the PFA containing Petri dish at 4 °C overnight. Flat fixation avoids curling up of the fin tissue during fixation.\n\t\t\nTo fix flat, grab the fin tissue with one fine forceps at the dorsal or ventral edge of the stump and immerse it in the fixation solution. Grab the opposite edge of the stump with a second fine forceps and slightly depress the tissue onto the bottom of the dish.\nHold for 10 to 20 s before releasing. The fin tissue should not curl up anymore. If it does, repeat.\nEuthanize zebrafish in order to harvest injured skull tissue. Prepare a 100 mm diameter Petri dish containing 0.1% MS-222 in fish water. Transfer one zebrafish at a time to the MS-222 containing Petri dish by using a fishing net. When level 6 of anesthesia (medullary collapse) is reached wait at least 10 min to assure death of the specimen12.\nUsing a scalpel cut off the head plus a little trunk tissue from the rest of the body. Immerse the harvested tissue in the prepared 4% PFA solution in the glass jar or plastic tube. Fix for 24 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking.",
    "To store samples long-term after fixation, wash them with PBS (3 x 20 min at RT) and methanol-treat in an increasing methanol series (1x 30%, 1x 50%, 1x 70%, 2x 100% methanol in PBS for 20 min each).\n\t\t\nStore them in 100% methanol at -20 °C. Otherwise, directly proceed with bone staining or other analyses after washing with PBS.\nBone staining techniques I (alizarin red staining)\n\tNOTE: This staining is performed according to van Eeden et al. 199617 and Walker & Kimmel 200718 with modifications.\n\t\nTo perform alizarin red staining on adult fins or skulls, harvest and fix tissue as described in sections 5.1.\nIf samples were stored in methanol at -20 °C, rehydrate samples by doing an inverse methanol series (70%, 50% and 30% in PBS, each 1x20 min) and wash twice 20 min with PBS. Wash samples for 5 min minimum with deionized water.\nTo do alizarin red staining in skulls, treat samples with 50 mg/mL trypsin in 30% saturated Na2B4O7 at room temperature overnight. Rock samples during this time. Rinse samples in 30% saturated Na2B4O7 solution. Wash samples with deionized water 2 times for 5 min each. This step is not performed for fin tissue.\nAdd alizarin red solution (Part B: 0.5% alizarin red S powder, 10% glycerol in deionized water) and rock the samples during incubation at RT. Check for staining after 1, 2, 4 h or overnight.\nTo clear samples treat them with a decreasing 1% potassium hydroxide:glycerol series (3:1 overnight, 1:1 overnight, 1:3 overnight).\nStore the samples in a 1:1 solution of 0.1% potassium hydroxide: 80% glycerol and mount them with 80% glycerol for imaging.",
    "NOTE: For combined Alcian blue/alizarin red staining treat samples with Alcian blue staining solution (Part A: final 0.02% Alcian blue, 50 mM MgCl2, 70% ethanol) after rehydration (section 5.2.2) for 2 h at RT. Treat fins with a decreasing ethanol series in 50 mM MgCl2 (70%, 50%, 30%, each 1x 15 min) and wash them for a minimum of 1h (3x 20 min) in deionized water. Proceed with alizarin red staining (section 5.2).\nBone staining techniques II (calcein staining)\n\tNOTE: To detect calcium deposition in fin fractures and skull injuries, live fish are incubated in calcein containing solution.\n\t\nPrepare the required amount of 0.2% calcein in deionized water (pH 7.5). Make sure the pH is neutral. Use 1 M NaOH to adjust the pH.\nIncubate up to 3 zebrafish simultaneously in 100 mL of calcein solution for 20 min in a glass beaker covered with aluminum foil.\nTransfer the zebrafish to a beaker with fish water. Let them swim briefly before transferring them to a new beaker with fish water. Let them swim in this new beaker for 20 min to wash. Take pictures (see section 5.4).\nLive imaging of zebrafish\nUse this approach to acquire images of regenerating bone tissue such as in the fin or skull throughout the experiment without sacrificing the zebrafish. Anaesthetize the zebrafish according to section 2.1.\nTo acquire images of fin regenerates, transfer the anaesthetized zebrafish onto an agarose-coated Petri dish (see section 2.2.1 and Figure 1B).\nTo acquire images of regenerating skull bones, place the zebrafish upright in a sponge (Figure 1D) or place it in an agarose-coated dish that has been prepared to hold the trunk of the zebrafish.\nAcquire images at the desired magnification and resolution using a stereomicroscopic setup.",
