Despite negative selection producing less purity than positive selection, we have observed that negative selection results in surface marker expression more consistent with untouched DCs analyzed directly from the spleen. Note that a commercial splenic DC purification kit can also be used here. DNA uptake assays can also be performed with bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs, see below).\nHarvest 2 mouse spleens in RPMI and keep on ice.\nInject 50 μL of digestion buffer (1 mg/mL Collagenase A and 50 U/mL DNase I in RPMI into each side of the spleen and incubate for 1 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nMince the spleens and digest with 10 mL of digestion buffer for 30 min at 32°C–35°C with gentle stirring using a magnet.\nNote: Add EDTA for a final concentration of 1 mM during the last 5 min of digestion in step 3 to minimize cell clumping.\nFilter through a 70 μm cell strainer. Spin down cells at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Wash the cell strainer with 5 mL of HBSS in the 50 mL tube before filtering the cells to reduce the impact of cells landing in the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL FACS buffer. Count cells and adjust to 1 × 108 cells/mL in FACS buffer.\nAdd TruStain FcX™ PLUS (i.e., anti-CD16/CD32) at 1:2000 dilution and incubate 10 min on ice.\nPrepare the mixture of biotin conjugated antibodies (10 μL Ly6C, 20 μL Ter119, 20 μL CD49b, 30 μL Ly6G and 40 μL of CD3e and B220 in 1000 μL total volume of FACS buffer).",
    "Note: The total volume of antibody needs to match that in step 5 to maintain the cell concentration for step 8 (i.e., if there are 1.5 × 108 cells in 1.5 mL in step 5, then scale up to prepare 1.5 mL of total antibody mixture).\nSpin down cells at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C. Add biotin antibody mixture to splenocytes. Mix well. Incubate 20 min on ice.\nSpin down at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C. Wash 1× with 2 mL cold FACS buffer.\nVortex the MojoSort Nanoparticles. Prepare a working dilution by adding 7.5 μL–992.5 μL FACS buffer. Scale appropriately so that the final cell concentration matches that in step 5.\nAdd pre-mixed MojoSort beads to splenocytes. Mix well. Incubate 10 min on ice.\nAdd FACS buffer to reach 3 mL total volume. Transfer cells to a 5 mL polystyrene tube and place in a magnet designed to hold the tube for 3 min.\nNote: Either the BioLegend MojoSort (#480019) or the STEMCELL EasySep Magnet (#18000) can be used during this step.\nDecant supernatant containing dendritic cells. Count cells and resuspend at 106/mL in RPMI supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Proceed to plate cells as in step 15.\nNote: Do not invert the tube more than once in order to maximize purity of the DCs.\nNote: Approximately 1 × 106 cells will be recovered from 108 total splenocytes, with 40%–60% purity for CD11c+MHCII+ DCs. If higher purity is required then fluorescence activated cell sorting is recommended.\nTreatment of DCs with EdU-labeled tumor debris\nTiming: 2 h for DNA uptake; 6 h for cell activation",
    "This in vitro assay has been designed to track the tumor DNA uptake by DCs. Cells are stimulated with tumor debris to mimic the tumor microenvironment interactions. This protocol can also be adapted for use with BMDCs: (i) Flt3L-FC BMDCs differentiated following Brasel et al. (Brasel et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) or (ii) CD103+ BMDCs differentiated following Mayer et al. (Mayer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nQuickly thaw frozen EdU-labeled tumor debris at 37°C. Once thawed, add β-mercaptoethanol to 55 μM final concentration.\nPlate DCs from step 13 in 96-well round-bottom plate. Recommend using between 1 × 105 to 2 × 105 cells per well. Spin down at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 100 μL of EdU-labeled tumor debris (prepared in step 14).\nNote: It is suggested to use RPMI supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (55 μM) as a staining control. Alternatively tumor cell debris could be generated in the absence of EdU.\nCulture at 37°C and 5% CO2 for up to 2 h before proceeding to the next step. Alternatively, cells can be incubated for 4–6 h to evaluate DC activation. Incubation over 6 h is not recommended with splenic DCs due to reductions in cell viability. For intracellular cytokine detection, monensin and brefeldin A should be added during the last 4 h of culture.\nNote: Incubation times can vary, since DNA uptake has been observed as early as 15 min and splenic DC activation as early as 2 h. BMDCs may require longer incubation times if interested in measuring activation (up to 24 h).\nNote: Tumor cell debris can be supplemented with 1% FBS for incubation times longer than 2 h to improve cell viability. Higher levels of FBS can reduce the amount of activation observed.",
    "Optional: Antibodies or other reagents can be added to the tumor cell debris in step 14 to evaluate their ability to regulate DNA uptake or DC activation. For example, DNA uptake in splenic DCs and CD103+ BMDCs is increased by the addition of anti-TIM-3 (clone RMT3-23) and reduced by the addition of anti-HMGB1 (clone 3E8) (de Mingo Pulido et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSurface staining for flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step will label the cells with the specific flow cytometry antibodies necessary to identify the cells of interest.\nSpin down plate at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C and wash once with 200 μL cold FACS buffer.\nCreate a mixture of Live/Dead Zombie NIR dye (1:1000 dilution) and TruStain FcX (1:2000 dilution) in PBS (no protein). Add 200 μL of the mixture to the cells and incubate for 30 min on ice protected from light.\nPrepare the surface antibody mixture (200 μL per sample) in cold FACS buffer during the incubation period in step 19. See the gating strategy used in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1724-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategies for DCs\n(A and B) A representative gating strategy illustrating the purity of splenic DCs (A) and BMDCs generated with FLT-3L and GM-CSF (i.e., iCD103+ BMDCs) (B).\nNote: Suggested markers are listed below. See the resource table for recommended antibodies and dilution factors.\nSplenic DCs: CD45+, CD11c+, MHCII+ and CD11b+ (cDC2) or CD8a+ (cDC1).\nCD103+ BMDCs: CD45+, CD11c+, MHCII+, CD11b+, CD103+\nFlt3L-FC BMDCs: CD45+, CD11c+, MHCII+, CD11b+\nAfter step 19 is complete, spin down at 300 g for 10 min and wash with 200 μL ice cold FACS buffer.\nAdd 200 μL of antibody mixture to cells and resuspend gently by pipetting up and down. Then, incubate for 30 min on ice protected from light.",
    "Spin down at 300 g for 10 min and wash with 200 μL ice cold FACS buffer.\nResuspend the pellet gently in 100 μL BD Cytofix Fixation Buffer and incubate 15 min on ice protected from light. If doing the Click-iT reaction, it is recommended to use the Click-iT fixative included in the kit, otherwise BD Cytofix Fixation Buffer can be used.\nSpin down at 500 g for 5 min and discard supernatant.\nStore cells in FACS buffer or proceed to Click-iT EdU reaction.\nPause point: After fixation, samples can be stored at 4°C and protected from light in order to continue staining the next day for the Click-iT EdU reaction or intracellular proteins. If interested in evaluating cytokine expression, follow the standard intracellular staining protocol for flow cytometry. Using the same sample to detect DNA uptake and cytokine production is not recommended.\nImmunofluorescent staining for confocal microscopy\nTiming: 3 h\nAs an alternative to flow cytometry, BMDCs can be analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Using specific cytoplasmic markers (such as GAPDH) or nuclear markers (such as Hoechst 33342), the internalized DNA and its subcellular location can be determined.\nHarvest BMDCs and distribute 106 per well of a 96-well plate.\nSpin down plate at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and wash once with 200 μL cold FACS buffer.\nFix cells for 10–15 min at room temperature using 200 μL BD Cytofix or 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS.\nPermeabilize and block cells for 10 min at room temperature using 200 μL of perm/block buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 2% BSA, in 1× PBS).\nSpin down plate at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and wash once with 200 μL FACS buffer.",
    "Primary antibody incubation – incubate with 200 μL of a solution of anti-mouse GAPDH in FACS buffer (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at 4°C any point after fixation in order to continue staining the next day.\nSpin down plate at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and wash twice with 200 μL FACS buffer.\nSecondary antibody incubation: incubate with 200 μL of AF488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody in FACS buffer (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature.\nSpin down plate at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and wash twice with 200 μL FACS buffer.\nNuclear staining: incubate with 200 μL of Hoechst 33342 in FACS buffer (1:1000) for 10 min.\nProceed to Click-iT EdU reaction.\nClick-iT EdU reaction\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step labels the DNA with the fluorophore of choice using the Click-iT reaction. The Click-iT EdU reaction provides a more sensitive and robust assay to detect the uptake of exogenous DNA by DCs (as compared to BrdU labeling), as it does not require denaturation of the DNA.\nUsing the splenic DCs (from step 26) or BMDCs (from step 37), spin down the plate at 300 g for 10 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 40 μL Click-iT-Saponin based permeabilization buffer and resuspend the DCs. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature protected from light. This buffer needs to be prepared from 10× stock solution by diluting in deionized water.\nPrepare the EdU Click-iT Plus reaction cocktail as follows:\nPrepare 1× Click-iT EdU reaction buffer additive by diluting the 10× stock solution in deionized water. Volume required will depend on the number of reactions. Refer to the recipe below (as per the manufacturer’s directions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/cell-and-tissue-analysis/protocols/click-it-edu-imaging-protocol.html]).",
