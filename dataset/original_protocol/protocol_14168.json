    "The procedures carried out in this protocol were in accordance with the national Danish legislation for care and use of laboratory animals and the experiments were approved by the Danish National Animal Experiments Inspectorate (protocol# 2015-15-0201-00615).\n1. Preparations\nPrepare axolotl medium.\n\t\nApply high quality non-chemically treated tap water as axolotl medium. If this is unavailable, apply 40% Holtfreter's solution.\nPrepare 40% (wt/vol) Holtfreter's solution by dissolving 15.84 g NaCl, 0.54 g CaCl2·2H2O, 1.11 g MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.288 g KCl in filtered and deionized water up to a volume of 1 L.\nMake immersion anesthetics.\n\t\nPrepare benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) anesthetic solution by dissolving 200 mg ethyl 4-aminobenzoate in 3 mL acetone and then dissolving this mix in 1 L tap water or 40% Holtfreter's solution.\nPrepare MS-222 (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonic acid, also commonly known as tricane) anesthetic solution by dissolving 200 mg ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonic acid directly in 1 L tap water or 40% Holtfreter's solution.\nPrepare propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) anesthetic solution by dissolving 3.3 mg 2,6-diisopropylphenol in in 1 L tap water or 40% Holtfreter's solution. Alternatively, dilute commercially premade solution to 3.3 mg/L.\n\t\tCAUTION: Propofol is a powerful human anesthetic (intravenously administered) and should be handled with care, including in the diluted form.\nPrepare bed and container for echocardiography.\n\t\nPrepare lip-shaped animal bed for echocardiography by folding a 70 cm x 55 cm piece of soft cloth once and then rolling it into \"burrito shape\" (Figure 1A). Then bend over the ends until they meet and tape these together (Figure 1B).\nSubmerge the lip shaped structure in axolotl medium to accommodate the anesthetized axolotl during ultrasound imaging. Secure the animal to the structure and prevent floating using loose rubber bands; position these mid-mandibular and over the sacral region (Figure 1C).",
    "NOTE: The rubber bands should not squeeze the animal as this will affect hemodynamics.\nFor 2D echocardiography on unanesthetized axolotls, prepare a hammock by carving out a 16 cm x 8 cm x 5 cm hole in a 33 cm x 27 cm x 5 cm block of polystyrene foam (e.g., a lid from a medium size polystyrene foam container) (Figure 1D).\nPush a 33 cm x 27 cm piece of plastic wrap through the hole and secure the edges of the wrap to the top surface of the polystyrene foam block (Figure 1E) to create a hammock. Add axolotl medium to 3 cm of depth in the hammock. The unanesthetized axolotl will sink to the bottom of the hammock allowing for easy ventral access through the plastic wrap (Figure 1F).\n2. Anesthetize Axolotls\nImmerse axolotl in desired anesthetic solution (benzocaine, MS-222, or propofol).\nInspect for first signs of sedation, reduced movements and increasing loss of righting reflex, this appears within 10 min in animals < 10 g (< 10 cm) and within 20 min in animals between 10 g and 50 g of body mass (10-22 cm).\nInspect for complete lack of body movements, gill ventilation movements, and righting reflex, and make sure the animal is non-responsive to moderate pain stimulation tested by pinching the webbing between digits.\n\tNOTE: Despite the fact that general anesthesia is accomplished within 30 min in benzocaine anesthetized axolotls, cardiac function is not stabilized until 1 h. This is not the case in MS-222 or propofol anesthetized axolotls (Figure 6A-F).\nTo maintain axolotl under general anesthesia, keep the animal in anesthesia solution or wrapped in wet paper wipes wetted in anesthesia solution.",
    "NOTE: Anesthesia can be maintained for 7 h without adverse effects on animal's wellbeing given that the skin and especially the gills are kept moist.\nTo reawake axolotl, transfer the animal to anesthesia-free medium.\n\tNOTE: The first sign of awakening is gill ventilation movements. Animal should be upright and responsive to stimulation within 1 h.\n3. 2D Echocardiography on Anesthetized Axolotl\nPlace anesthetized axolotl in a supine position in the lip-shaped animal bed (steps 1.3.1-1.3.2). Secure it from floating using loose rubber bands (Figure 1C). Ensure that the thoracic surface is covered by 3-5 mm of medium.\n\tNOTE: For a brief acquisition (< 5 min) anesthetic-free medium can be applied. For prolonged acquisition, anesthetic solution should be applied as ultrasound medium to ensure stable cardiac function throughout measurements.\nPosition the transducer over the midline of the animal in the thoracic region parallel to the long axis of the animal (Figure 2A, Figure 3A-B, Supplementary File 2). Use transillumination with a cold light source on white and albino axolotls to ensure the correct placement of the transducer (Figure 2C and Supplementary File 1).\n\t\nFor axolotls weighing < 20 g, use a 50 MHz transducer; for axolotls > 20 g, use a 40 MHz transducer. Ensure positioning of the cranial/anterior direction to the right for standardized image acquisition. If this is not the case rotate the transducer 180 ° or invert the image.",
    "Make sure that in the long axis midline view, a small portion of the ventricle (positioned to the right in the thoracic cavity, Figure 2A) appears in the frame at ventricular diastole and a large portion of the left and right atria (positioned at the center/slightly toward the left in the thoracic cavity, Figure 2A) and the sinus venosus are visible both in atrial systole and diastole (Figure 3A, B).\nTranslate the transducer 1-3 mm toward the animal's right to obtain the ventricular long axis view (Figure 2A). The correct position is attained when the cross-sectional area of the end-systole ventricle is at its maximum (Figure 3C-H).\nIn B-mode, acquire ≥ 3 cardiac cycles with > 50 frames/s in either 'general imaging' (high spatial/low temporal resolution) or 'cardiology' (low spatial/high temporal resolution) mode.\n\tNOTE: This view allows for evaluation of ventricular function. Ventricular function can be evaluated in two dimensions using the ventricular fractional area change (FACv) calculated from the end-diastolic and end-systolic cross sectional area of the ventricle (CSAv) using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq1.jpg (1)\n\tThe axolotl's ventricle assumes the shape of a sphere and a geometry based stroke volume [SV(geo)] can be calculated using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq2.jpg (2)\nTranslate the transducer along the long axis of the animal until the center of the ventricle is in the middle of the screen. Rotate the transducer 90 ° clockwise to obtain the mid-ventricular short axis view (Figure 5A and B, Supplementary File 10). Evaluate the circular shape of the ventricle by translating the transducer along the long axis of the heart.",
    "Return the transducer to the long axis plane and translate it back toward the midline or slightly to the left of the midline to obtain the atrial long axis two chamber view (Figure 2A). Make sure that the correct position is attained by confirming that the cross-sectional areas of the end-systole atria are at their maxima and the two atria combined assume the outline of the number '8' tilted ~ 45 ° toward the left (Figure 4A and B, Supplementary File 6).\nIn B-mode acquire ≥ 3 cardiac cycles with > 50 frames/s in either 'general imaging' or 'cardiology' mode.\n\tNOTE: The axolotl's atria are irregular in shape and 3D function cannot be directly inferred from 2D data, thus their function must be evaluated as an index measure such as atrial fractional area chance (FACa) based on the combined cross sectional area (CSAa) of both atrial chambers in systole and diastole:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq3.jpg (3)\nTranslate the transducer toward the right until the outflow tract (conus arteriosus) appears (close to the ventricular long axis view) (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: After leaving the ventricle in an anterior direction, the outflow tract makes a sharp bend and runs at a small angle toward the ventral surface before again assuming an anterior direction and splitting up into gill branches and systemic vessels.\n\t\nMake sure that the correct outflow tract view is attained by confirming that the diameter of the outflow is at its maximum at ventricular end-systole and two of the three semilunar valves at the entrance of the outflow are visible at mid-ejection (Figure 4E, Supplementary File 8).\n\t\tNOTE: The ventral directionality toward the transducer of the intermediate portion of the outflow tract allows for velocity and flow measurements using Doppler imaging.",
    "Apply Color Doppler-mode to map blood flow velocities in the outflow tract during cardiac ejection (Figure 4F and Supplementary File 9). Likewise apply Color Doppler and Power Doppler imaging to visualize blood flow in the ventricular and atrial views (Figure 3E-H, Supplementary Files 4-5 and Figure 4C-D, and Supplementary File 7).\nApply Pulse Wave (PW) Doppler-mode at the position of maximum blood velocity in the portion of the outflow tract running toward the transducer.\n\t\nUse 'beam angle' and 'angular correction' up to 45 ° to adjust for the outflow not being completely perpendicular to the face of the transducer (Figure 4G). Make sure that the PW Doppler position is not overlapped by the spiral valve of the outflow during any phase of the cardiac cycle (Figure 4E).\nIn PW Doppler-mode acquire velocity/time data over ≥ 3 cardiac cycles.\nReturn to B-mode and acquire ≥ 3 cardiac cycles at the exact same plane as PWV was acquired.\nMeasure the velocity time integral (VTI) of the blood flow in the outflow tract as the area under the velocity/time curve for one full cardiac cycle (Figure 4G, g1).\n\tNOTE: From the VTI and the diameter (d) of the outflow tract at end-systole obtained from the B-mode acquisition, a PW Doppler based stroke volume [SV(pw)] can be calculated using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq4.jpg (4)\n\tHeart rate (HR) is measured from the velocity/time curve by measuring the duration of an entire cardiac cycle. Cardiac output [CO(pw)] is calculated using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq5.jpg (5)",
    "Obtain the oblique paragill view, a view that offers an alternative for the measurement of the blood flow velocity in the outflow tract, by rotating the axolotl 90 ° in the lip shaped bed in such a way that the right part of the animal is facing upward (Figure 2B). Angle and rotate the transducer and position it parallel and just posterior to the protruding gills (Figure 2B). Make sure that the correct position is attained by confirming that the outflow tract is running downward at ~ 45 ° and that the atria appear under the outflow tract during ejection (Figure 5C, Supplementary File 11).\nApply PW Doppler-mode at the position of maximum blood velocity in the portion of the outflow tract running away from the transducer (Figure 5D, Supplementary File 12). Use 'beam angle' and 'angular correction' up to 45 ° to adjust for the outflow not being completely perpendicular to the face of the transducer (Figure 5E).\nIn the PW Doppler-mode acquire blood velocity over ≥ 3 cardiac cycles.\nReturn to B-mode and acquire ≥ 3 cardiac cycles at the exact same plane as PWV was acquired.\n\tNOTE: SV(pw) and CO(pw) are calculated for the oblique paragill view using Equation 4 and Equation 5 as described above for the long axis view.\n4. 2D Echocardiography on Unanesthetized Axolotl\nPlace the unanesthetized axolotl in a prone position in the hammock (step 1.3.3).\nLeave the animal undisturbed for 30-60 min to recover from handling stress.\nPosition the ultrasound transducer with the transducer head facing upward toward the axolotl in the hammock.\nApply ultrasound-gel on the transducer.\nGently, and without disturbing the animal, position the transducer over the midline of the animal in the thoracic region parallel to the long axis of the animal.",
    "NOTE: This is the same, but inverted, position as for the anesthetized axolotl (step 3.2).\nObtain B-mode, Color Doppler mode, PW mode data in the long axis and short axis view as described in steps 3.2-3.14.\n\tNOTE: An oblique paragill view is unobtainable in the unanesthetized axolotl. The echocardiographic data in unanesthetized axolotls should be acquired between gill ventilation movements (a 10-20 s period for a resting animal). If the axolotl moves during acquisition, measurements must be repeated.\n5. Evaluate 2D Echocardiography Data and Minimize Subjectivity\nAvoid operator/observer bias in 2D ultrasound imaging and 3D evaluation of cardiac function based on 2D data caused by subjectivity in both the data acquisition and the data analysis phase by performing intra/inter-operator/observer analysis20.\n\tNOTE: In the startup of studies and when training new personnel this subjectivity must be quantified and minimized using intra/inter-operator/observer analysis.\nInitiate the intra/inter-operator/observer analysis in a two person setup with operator/observer 1 (less experienced) being tested against operator/observer 2 (more experienced) by performing ≥ 6 consensus measurements together, including both bench work at the ultrasound system (operation) and subsequent analysis of relevant parameters (observation).\nReach consensus between operators and observers and operate (operator/observer 1) the ultrasound system to acquire relevant data on ≥ 6 animals (operation 1.1).\nDirectly after, operate (operator/observer 2) the ultrasound system to acquire relevant data on the same animals (operation 2.1).\nLet animals recover for 3 days. Thereafter, repeat (operator/observer 1) the procedure (operation 1.2).\nAnalyze (operator/observer 1) all measured data (operation 1.1/observation 1.1; operation 2.1/observation 1.1; operation 1.2/observation 1.1) and after 24 h repeat the analysis of operator/observer 2's data (operation 2.1/observation 1.2).\nAnalyze (operator/observer 2) the data acquired by her/himself (operation 2.1/observation 2.1). Note that the values obtained by this analysis are considered closest to the true values.",
    "Evaluate variation, tendencies, and bias in comparisons between all acquired parameters using Bland-Atman plotting, QQ plotting, t-test (equal mean), and F-test (equal variance) (Figure 6G).\n\t\nNote that the operation 1.1/observation 1.1 versus operation 2.1/observation 1.1 comparison demonstrates the inter-operator variation.\nNote that the operation 2.1/observation 1.1 versus operation 2.1/observation 2.1 comparison demonstrates the inter-observer variation.\nNote that the operation 1.1/observation 1.1 versus operation 1.2/observation 1.1 comparison demonstrates the intra-operator variation.\nNote that the operation 2.1/observation 1.1 versus operation 2.1/observation 1.2 comparison demonstrates the intra-observer variation.\nMake sure that mean and variation of the different measurements are non-significantly different for the four comparisons; the difference between measured values should fall within ± 1.96 standard deviations, and there should appear no tendencies toward less precision of neither small nor large values.\n6. 3D Echocardiography on Anesthetized Axolotl\n3D acquisition\n\t\nPlace the anesthetized axolotl in a supine position in the lip-shaped animal bed (step 1.3.1). Secure it from floating using loose rubber bands (Figure 1C) and make sure that the thoracic surface is covered by 3-5 mm of medium. 3D acquisition is a lengthy procedure, therefore apply anesthetic solution as ultrasound medium to ensure stable cardiac function throughout measurements.\nPosition the transducer over the midline of the animal in the thoracic region either parallel to the long axis of the animal (for a sagittal 3D recording) or orthogonal to the long axis (transversal 3D recording).\nTranslate the transducer in the in-plane dimension (x and y) and the out-of-plane dimension (z or slice) to ensure that the entire cardiac region will be covered in the subsequent 3D capture.",
    "Adjust the frame rate and spatial resolution as desired by selecting either 'general imaging' (high spatial/low temporal resolution) or 'cardiology' (low spatial/high temporal resolution) mode. For 0.33 Hz < HR < 1 Hz use a temporal resolution of 50 frames/s obtained at high spatial resolution ('general imaging') that allows for the cardiac cycle to be reconstructed into 50-150 distinct phases.\nAdjust '2D gain' to a level where anatomical structures are barely recognizable in the raw B-mode image (~ 5 dB) to increase signal-to-noise-ratio in the final reconstructions.\nFor each slice (z step), record ≥ 1,000 frames.\nTranslate transducer one z step at a time, e.g., 20 µm or 50 µm, and repeat recording until the entire cardiac region is covered.\n3D reconstruction (Supplementary Files 13 and 14).\n\t\nExport acquisitions into Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine DICOM (little endian).\n\t\tNOTE: Each slice containing a set number of frames will compose a single file.\nDetermine the number of frames in a full cardiac cycle. As HR can vary over time, determine this for both the first and the final slice. Set the highest number of frames per cycle as the initial upper estimation of phase resolution that can later be reduced (step 6.2.8).\nDetermine crop boundaries and excise irrelevant space surrounding the B-mode window.\n\t\tNOTE: These boundaries should be constant throughout slices.\nConvert the RGB Color image into 32-bit.\nCalculate the correlation value (C) for each frame in the stack and the number of frames included in the first cardiac cycle using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq6.jpg (6)",
    "NOTE: Here imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq7.jpg is the signal intensity of the pixel at coordinate (i, j) in the first image imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq8.jpg and is the same in the second image, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq9.jpg, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq10.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq11.jpg, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq12.jpg are the mean intensity and standard deviation, respectively, of the first and second image in the comparison, and I and J are the numbers of columns and rows in the image. The resulting array of correlation values will have the size of the product of the number of frames per cardiac cycle and the total number of frames per slice (e.g., 75 × 1,000 = 75,000 in Figure 8) (see exemplary script in Supplementary File 16). The correlation value cannot be calculated if one or both of the images in the comparison have a standard deviation of pixel values of zero, however this is highly unlikely in ultrasonographic images.\nDetect local maxima in the array of correlation values (Figure 8A, see exemplary script in Supplementary File 17 to automatically detect local maxima).\nCalculate quadratic average Q(AVG) of frames with peak correlation values (i.e., matching cardiac phases) using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq14.jpg (7)\n\t\twhere N is the total number of frames with matching cardiac phases, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq15.jpg is the intensity of the pixel at coordinate (i, j) of the nth image and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq16.jpg is the temporal arithmetic mean of imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57089/57089eq17.jpg of the nth image (see exemplary script in Supplementary File 18).\nRepeat step 6.2.3-6.2.7 for all slices.",
    "Select a slice (reference slice) with easily recognizable anatomical structures (e.g., mid-ventricular) and check if the reconstructed ensemble averaged one cardiac cycle corresponds to exactly one cycle (i.e., if there are additional phases resulting in more than one cardiac cycle). Delete additional phases to yield exactly one cardiac cycle (e.g., going from an overestimated 75 phases/cycle (in reality, 1.07 cycle) in Figure 8 to exactly one cycle containing 70 phases in Figure 8).\nOn the neighboring slice (test slice), sort the ensemble averaged one cardiac cycle t-stack into matching cardiac phases with the reference slice using the correlation value formula ( Equation 6) (see exemplary scripts in Supplementary File 19 and Supplementary File 20).\n\t\tNOTE: Although two non-identical slices will not appear completely similar at any point during the cardiac cycle, adjacent slices with a sufficiently small step size (e.g., 20 µm or 50 µm) will have pronounced similarities resulting in correlation value maxima that can be translated into matching phases.\nRepeat step 6.2.9-6.2.10 for all slices.\nCollapse the entire 3D reconstruction into a single 3D Tagged Image File format (TIF) containing z slices and t frames or into a stack of DICOM files.\n\t\tNOTE: Data can be binned in each dimension to reduce size, increase signal-to-noise ratio and generate isotropic data (in-plane resolution is usually several folds higher than out-of-plane resolution).\nSubscription Required.
