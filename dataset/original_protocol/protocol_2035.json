    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSoft lithography of PDMS with the mold\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThese steps describe how to prepare PDMS and fabricate PDMS devices with the mold.\nPrepare the mixture of PDMS and the curing agent at a 10:1 volume ratio (Cong and Pan, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Mata et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPut a weight boat on a scale and set it to zero.\nPour PDMS into the weight boat using a stainless steel lab spatula.\nPour the curing agent into the PDMS using a dropper.\nVigorously stir the PDMS mixture using the spatula for 3 min.\nPut the boat containing the PDMS mixture into the vacuum oven.\nSet the vacuum oven pressure to 20 kPa at room temperature (25°C).\nDegas the PDMS mixture for 30 min to ensure there is no air bubble formed at the surface of the PDMS mixture. Our vacuum oven is equipped with a front window, allowing us to observe the degassing process.\nPrepare the resin-free, completely cured mold on the flat surface of a table.\nPour the degassed PDMS mixture into the mold until the PDMS fills up.\nPut the mold filled up with the degassed PDMS into the vacuum oven.\nSet the vacuum oven pressure to 20 kPa at room temperature (25°C).\nDegas the PDMS mixture in the mold for 30 min.\nChange the vacuum oven pressure to 101.325 kPa (1 atm) and temperature to 85°C for curing.\nCure the PDMS mixture in the mold in the vacuum oven for 1 h.\nTake out the mold from the oven and let it cool down to room temperature.\nTake off the cured PDMS from the mold.",
    "Critical: During the degassing process, the pressure in the vacuum oven should be adjusted properly. If the pressure is too low, the liquid in the weight boat (or any container) comes out together with the air bubbles. In contrast, the degassing process takes a long time to remove air molecules from the PDMS mixture at high pressure.\nAssembling the PDMS device and the acrylic holder\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps describe the screw mechanism, caution, and alternative methods.\nSet the bottom piece of the holder on a flat surface of the table.\nAlign the PDMS device in the center of the bottom piece (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1629-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Assembling of the PDMS device with the acrylic holder\nCover the PDMS with the top piece of the holder.\nAlign screw holes around the edge and the fluid inlet hole.\nInsert screws into screw holes around the edge.\nLoosely tighten all screws and then further tighten each screw with nuts in the zig-zag direction.\nCritical: Because the 3D printed PDMS device is soft, special care should be taken during the assembly of the device using a screw mechanism. The overtightening of screws can squeeze and deform the PDMS device, leading to the failure of proper device operation. In contrast, loosely tightened screws allow air leaks, causing unsuccessful degassing of the vacuum pocket and uncontrollable fluid flow in the microchannel. Although the screw mechanism is a cheap and easy method to fabricate devices in the laboratory, this method needs hands-on experience. Instead, a hinge-like 4 side locking mechanism used in most food containers with airtight lids or clamps is an alternative way to improve the reliability of the device fabrication.\nVideo recording and device operation\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "These steps describe the particular sequence of preparing the devices and performing the fluid trajectory measurements.\nSet up a digital camera and light source for recording the fluid trajectory.\nUse a white background below the device for clear recording.\nAdjust the focus of the camera on the microchannel in the device.\nSet the vacuum oven pressure to 50 kPa and temperature to room temperature (25°C).\nPlace the assembled device into the vacuum oven.\nDegas the device for 1.5 h.\nPlace the degassed device under the camera.\nStart recording in the camera.\nBegin the experiment by dropping a fluid into the inlet of the device.\nAfter completing the experiment, stop recording the camera.\nCheck the video recordings for the data analysis.\nCritical: Prepare the experimental setup for video recording before the final degassing process of the PDMS device, in order to avoid diffusion of air molecules into the PDMS in ambient conditions, which can cause deterioration of the vacuum power.\nAlternative method: Fabricating non-PDMS, self-powered microfluidic device using a removable vacuum battery\nThe following steps describe an alternative method to fabricate a self-powered microfluidic device using non-PDMS materials. Here, we have used the 3D printed materials to fabricate all parts of the device, which includes a microchannel embedded device body and a removable vacuum battery.\nDesign and 3D printing of the microfluidic device and vacuum battery\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThese steps describe the fabrication, post-treatment, and assembling of parts.\nDesign the device body consisting of the microchannel and several holes.\nThe top piece of the body includes holes for fluid inlet, screws, and vacuum battery attachment.\nThe bottom piece of the body includes the microchannel for fluid flow and holes for screw assembly.",
    "Design the vacuum battery to drive the fluid flow in the microchannel of the 3D printed, non-PDMS device. The vacuum battery includes the following components (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1629-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. 3D printed, non-PDMS device parts and assembling, along with the removable vacuum battery\nEmpty volume (space) to control the vacuum level.\nA vacuum pumping port on the top (or side) of the vacuum battery for attaching a hand pump.\nOpen area on the bottom of the vacuum battery for the diffusion of air molecules in the microchannel through a thin PDMS membrane.\nScrew holes for attaching the vacuum battery to the device body.\nPrint the device body and vacuum battery design via the 3D printer.\nWash the 3D printed body and vacuum battery by following the washing step described above (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nDry them with a nitrogen gas stream.\nMake threads on the bottom piece of the device body and vacuum battery.\nHold the bottom piece or vacuum battery securely using a bench vise.\nInsert a tip drill and manually turn it gently to make threads.\nPrepare a PDMS membrane (thickness of 500 μm).\nPrepare the mixture of PDMS and the curing agent at a 10:1 volume ratio as described above.\nPlace down a polystyrene Petri dish upside down on the spinner chuck.\nPour 30 g of the PDMS onto the Petri dish.\nSet the spin speed of the spin coater to 200 rpm and time to 30 s.\nRun the spin coater.\nWhen spinning is completed, take the Petri dish out from the spin coater.\nSet the vacuum oven pressure to 101.325 kPa (1 atm) and temperature to 85°C for curing.\nCure the PDMS on the Petri dish in the vacuum oven for 1 h.\nCarefully peel off the cured PDMS membrane from the Petri dish.",
    "Keep the membrane clean before use.\nAssemble the device body and vacuum battery (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPlace the bottom piece of the device body on a flat surface of the table.\nEvenly spread the vacuum grease on the surface.\nStack the top piece of the device body on the top of the bottom piece.\nMake sure the alignment of all screw holes of the top and bottom pieces.\nInsert screws into the holes and tighten them up. Tighten screws properly as described above.\nPlace the PDMS membrane on the hole for the vacuum battery.\nStack the vacuum battery on the PDMS membrane.\nInsert screws and tighten them up. Tighten screws properly as described above.\nCritical: Ensure that all screws are properly tightened in the 3D printed materials. The overtightening of screws can crack or break the device during assembling, which allows an air leak like the case of loosely tightened screws. The diffusion of air molecules out of the microchannel reduces the power of the vacuum battery, responsible for driving the fluid flow in the microchannel.\nDevice operation and data acquisition\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps describe the particular sequence of preparing the devices and performing the fluid trajectory measurements.\nSet up the CCD camera and light for recording the fluid trajectory as described above.\nAttach a hand pump to the vacuum battery.\nSqueeze the lever repeatedly to remove the air in the vacuum battery (<1 min).\nWhen the vacuum gauge reaches 50 kPa, stop the squeezing.\nDetach the hand pump from the vacuum battery.\nClose the air valve to close the hole.\nPut the degassed device under the camera.\nStart recording in the camera.\nBegin the experiment by dropping a fluid into the inlet of the device.\nAfter completing the experiment, stop recording the camera.",
    "Check the video recordings for the data analysis.\nOptional: The removable vacuum battery could be attached to conventional microfluidic devices fabricated with silicon or glass materials. Furthermore, the vacuum battery could be used to drive the fluid flow for the PDMS-based microfluidic devices described above, instead of using the built-in vacuum pocket."
