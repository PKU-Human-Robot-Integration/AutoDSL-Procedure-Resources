    "Note: All procedures are performed on ice and all centrifugations are performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Preparation of cytosol from cultured HT-1080 cells (prepared ahead of time, will be used in the reaction, Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171113/20171113022335_7312.jpgFigure 1. Schematic overview of the experimental procedure. The preparations of cytosol and donor membrane for the budding reaction were described in Procedure A and Procedure B, respectively. The assembly of budding reactions and isolation of vesicles from budding reactions were described in Procedure C. Packaging efficiency of COPII cargos were assessed by immunoblotting as described in Procedure D (Republished from Gorur et al., 2017 with modifications).Culture 20 x 15 cm plates of HT-1080 to 95% confluent in 30 ml culture medium per plate.Note: HT-1080 was chosen because it supports the secretion of overexpressed PC1, while it does not express PC1 endogenously and thus minimized background. Its fast growth rate also makes it easy to scale-up for cytosol preparation. Remove media and wash cells with 10 ml PBS/plate, repeat the wash one more time, and remove as much of PBS as possible.Scrape cells on ice and collect with 1 ml B88 buffer/plate (see Recipes) with protease inhibitors (used as suggested by manufacturer: 1 tablet per 50 ml). Note: This is done 5 plates at a time with 5 ml of B88 buffer. Collect cells from the first plate by resuspending with 5 ml of B88, and then use the same buffer to collect cells from the next 4 plates.Transfer cell suspension to a 50 ml Falcon tube.Add digitonin (40 mg/ml; see Recipes) to cell suspension to reach a final concentration of 80 μg/ml. Mix by inverting the tube a few times.Rotate for 30 min on a platform rotator at 4 °C.",
    "During the 30 min incubation, hydrate 4 g Bio-beadsTM (1 g per 5 x 15 cm plates) with 25 ml B88 buffer:Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at Acceleration Setting (Accel) 9 (default) and Deceleration Setting (Decel) 7 using SorvallTM ST16R centrifuge.Discard supernatant and wash beads two more times with 25 ml B88 buffer.After the last wash, discard as much buffer as possible.Note: To remove buffer between Bio-beadsTM, press a P1000 tip to the bottom of the tube through beads then aspirate buffer with minimal disruption. This step should be immediately followed by the addition of crude cytosol to prevent Bio-beadsTM from drying out.After the 30 min digitonin incubation, centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min.Take the supernatant (crude cytosol) and transfer to wash Bio-beadsTM.Incubate cytosol with Bio-beadsTM with mild agitation to absorb digitonin from the crude cytosol on a platform rotator at 4 °C overnight.The next morning, clarify the cytosol-beads mixture at 300 x g for 5 min at Decel 7.Recover supernatant and aliquot to about 14 x 1.5 ml polypropylene microfuge tubes.Centrifuge at 135,300 x g for 30 min in TLA-55 rotors at Accel 2 Decel 6.Collect supernatant conservatively and avoid disturbing sedimented material.Concentrate supernatant (cytosol) by centrifuging in 15 ml Amicon-3k concentrator at 4,000 x g for 4 x 10 min. Note: Cytosol was centrifuged 4 times for 10 min each time and mixed between each sedimentation to minimize protein precipitation.Further concentrate cytosol using 0.5 ml Amicon-3k concentrators at 14,000 x g for 3 x 10 min in a fixed angle rotor (FA-45-30-11, Eppendorf).Note: Cytosol was mixed between each sedimentation to minimize protein precipitation.Collect concentrated cytosol and measure protein concentration using Bradford reagents. Note: The concentration should be between 40-80 mg/ml.Freeze small aliquots (recommend 1.",
    "6 mg/aliquot) in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for future use in budding reaction. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.Preparation of donor membrane (DM) from cultured human cells (prepare on the day of the reaction fresh, Figure 1)Culture 3 x 10 cm plates of IMR-90 to 95% confluent in 10 ml culture medium per plate.Note: Use young cells under PDL 37.5. Older cells are significantly less efficient at secreting PC1. IMR-90 was used to prepare donor membrane because it is the most efficient at PC1 secretion of all cell lines that we tested. Other cell lines such as sv-IMR90 and U-2OS may also be used to prepare donor membrane with lower budding efficiency (Gorur et al., 2017). Aspirate media from 3 x 10 cm plates of IMR-90.Wash each plate with 10 ml PBS.Add 0.5 ml 0.25% trypsin to each plate and incubate at RT for 5 min.Collect cells from each plate with 6 ml PBS buffer into 2 x 15 ml tubes.Add 25 μl 10 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (see Recipes) to each tube and mix well.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 1 ml B88 buffer with low retention tips. Note: Dislodge the cell pellet by gently tapping it prior to the addition of buffer. Use low retention tips for all future steps.Add B88 buffer to each tube so that the final volume in each 15 ml tube is 6 ml.Add 3 μl 40 mg/ml digitonin to each tube so that final concentration is 20 μg/ml.Mix well and incubate on ice for 5 min.Add 8 ml B88 buffer to each tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 1 ml B88 buffer and transfer to 2 x 1.",
    "5 ml low retention microcentrifuge tubes.Mix 3 μl of trypan blue and 3 μl of cells on a glass slide, carefully lay a cover slip over the sample, then check percentage of permeabilized cells under a light microscope with a 16x or 25x objective.Note: 100% of cells should be permeabilized at this stage. Blue nuclei and clear to light brown ER surrounding each blue nucleus should be observed.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min in a swinging bucket rotor (S-24-11-AT). Note: Perform all subsequent centrifugations in a swinging bucket rotor for maximum recovery.Discard supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml B88 buffer containing 0.5 M LiCl (see Recipes) in B88.Incubate on ice for 5 min, then centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml B88 buffer.Note: Dislodge the cell pellet by gently tapping the tube prior to the addition of buffer.Incubate on ice for 5 min, then centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml B88-0 buffer (see Recipes).Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend both pellets in 200 μl B88-0. This is a working stock of DM.Determine the concentration of DM in the working stock:Make a 1 to 50 dilution of DM in B88-0.Blank with B88-0 and measure the optical density of diluted DM sample at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer. The reading is the ‘OD600’ of the diluted sample.Note: OD600 is used as a unit of concentration in this protocol.Calculate the concentration of the working stock by multiplying the OD600 of the diluted sample with 50.",
    "Note: If the OD600 of the working stock is above 2, then there will be enough of DM for 8 x 100 μl budding reactions with the final OD600 of 0.5.Calculate the volume of working stock to be added to each budding reaction using the equation: C1V1 = C2V2 where, C is the concentration of DM in OD600 and V is the volume in μl.Reconstitution of COPII coated vesiclesIn low retention tubes, assemble budding reactions by adding ingredients from left to right in Table 1. Each 100 μl reaction contains ATP regeneration system (1 mM ATP, 40 mM creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), 3 mM GTP, 20 ng/μl SAR1B, 10 ng/μl SEC23A/24D, 10 ng/μl SEC13/31A, 2 μg/μl cytosol, and OD600 of 0.5 for DM. Note: Add B88-0, nucleotides (an ATP r.s. and GTP, see Recipes) and recombinant COPII proteins first. Mix well by pipetting and briefly centrifuge to collect liquid at the bottom of each tube. Then add DM and mix by pipetting up and down gently until homogenous. Add cytosol last and mix by gentle pipetting.Table 1. Sample calculation of cell-free PC1 budding reactions. Each row represents a single cell-free reaction. The total volume of each reaction is 100 μl. Each column represents a component of the reaction, and the volume added to the reaction in μl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171113/20171113023505_1298.jpgIncubate reactions at 30 °C (or on ice as a negative control) for 1 h.Isolate COPII carriers of PC1 with the following centrifugation steps (Figure 1).Centrifuge at 7,000 x g for 10 min.Place 50 μl of 60% OptiPrepTM at the bottom of a 7 x 20 mm ultracentrifugation tube with positive-displacement pipet Microman® M250. Note: The OptiPrepTM gradient purchased from Sigma-Aldrich is a 60% (w/v) solution.",
    "Recover 85 μl 7,000 x g supernatant and mix with the 60% OptiPrepTM in a 7 x 20 mm ultracentrifugation tube until homogenous, resulting in a 22.2% (w/v) OptiPrepTM mixture.Note: Avoid introducing bubbles.Overlay with 100 μl 18% (w/v) OptiPrepTM in B88 by slowly pipetting against the wall using a gel-loading tip. Important Note: An interphase should be observed between 18% OptiPrepTM and the 22.2% 7,000 x g supernatant OptiPrepTM mixture at this stage.Overlay with 10 μl B88 by pipetting slowly using a gel-loading tip.Important Note: An interphase should be observed between B88 and 18% OptiPrepTM in B88. Centrifuge at 55,000 rpm (or 258,488 x g) for 90 min at the Acceleration Setting (Accel) 2 and Decel 6 in TLS-55 rotors and adaptors for 7 x 20 mm tubes.Collect lipid vesicles from the top of the flotation gradient immediately after the centrifugation is over.Immunoblot (Western blot)Perform standard immunoblotting procedure by following the notes below:Add DM to 20 μl 1x sample buffer C (see Recipes) to reach a final concentration of 0.1 OD600/μl DM, then mix vigorously using a micro-tube mixer at max speed for 10 min at RT.Add 5x sample buffer (see Recipes) to float fractions.Incubate both DM sample and floated samples at 65 °C for 10 min.Load the desired amount of DM sample and the entire floated fractions onto a 15 wedged well 4-20% gradient gel.Run sample at constant 25 mA until dye runs out of the gel (about 75 min) at RT.Transfer protein onto a PVDF membrane at constant 0.15 A for 16 h at 4 °C. Important Note: The transfer condition was optimized for PC1.Conditions may vary for other proteins of interest.Block with 5% non-fat milk (w/v) in TBST (see Recipes) for 30 min at RT.Incubate with primary antibodies at RT for 2.5 h.",
    "Important Note: The temperature and duration were optimized for the rabbit anti PC1 antibody LF-41, which was used at 1:5,000 in 1% BSA (w/v) TBST. Each aliquot can be stored at 4 °C and reused up to 7 times without compromising the detection. An ER marker (ribophorin I) is included as a negative control, whereas regular COPII cargos (ERGIC53 and SEC22B) are used as positive controls.Wash with TBST 3 x 5 min.Incubate with secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP at RT for 1 h.Wash with TBST 3 x 5 min.Develop with the HRP substrate ECL plus and image on a ChemiDocTM Imaging System with ImageLab software v4.0."
