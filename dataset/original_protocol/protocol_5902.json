    "Isolation of washed plateletsTake human blood from cubital vein by safety multifly-needle on volunteers. Discard the first 1 ml then take another 5 ml into a syringe with 714 μl ACD buffer (see Recipe 1) inside.Notes: The volunteers should not take any drugs that affect platelets in the last two weeks. Draw blood smoothly to avoid platelets activation. Mix the blood with an equal volume of modified Tyrode’s buffer (pH 6.5) (see Recipe 2) in a 15 ml falcon tube.Centrifuge the mixture in Step A2 at 70 x g for 35 min without brake at room temperature (RT) to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP) retrieved from the upper layer.Mingle 3 ml PRP with 7 ml modified Tyrode’s buffer (pH 6.5) in the presence of 0.1% rHSA (w/v) and 100 ng/mg PGI2 in a 15 ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge the diluted PRP in Step A4 at 1,200 x g for 10 min at RT.Discard the supernatant and suspend the pellet carefully in 1 ml Tyrode’s buffer with pH 6.5.Measure the platelet concentration on an automated hematology counter.Store the purified platelets at room temperature until use. Notes: Platelets cannot be cultured, so they should be prepared daily from freshly drawn blood. The whole process of platelets preparation should be gentle enough to prevent platelets activation. Bacteria preparationInoculate E. coli from a frozen stock in LB-broth medium with 100 μg/ml Ampicillin.Note: Conduct E. coli inoculation at the Bunsen burner. Culture the inoculated E. coli at 37 °C with 260 rpm shaking overnight.On the following day, dilute saturated culture of E. coli in LB-broth medium with 1 mM IPTG and 100 μg/ml Ampicillin (1:500 in a volume of 5 ml).Culture the diluted E. coli in Step B3 at 37 °C with 260 rpm for 2.5 h to allow growth to mid-log phase.",
    "Determine the colony forming units (CFU)/ml of cultured E. coli at OD600nm=1 (1, Determine viability of bacteria as a function of OD600nm by plating bacteria and counting colony forming units at various time points with increasing OD600nm. 2, Based on obtained growth curves determine CFUs/ml at OD600nm=1, we obtained 2.8 x 108 CFU/ml at OD600nm = 1.0).Measure the E. coli concentration by optical density at OD600nm (expected OD600nm ~0.5-0.6).Adjust the cultured E. coli to OD600nm equal to 0.25 in LB medium (0.7 x 108 CFU/ml; 1 ml), centrifuge at 1,200 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.Suspend the bacteria pellet in equal volume of PBS (1 ml) and keep them on ice under light protection until use.Note: Perform the bacteria preparation according to the safety regulations of your laboratory.Coverslip coatingImmerse glass coverslips in 20% HNO3 for 1 h on a shaker with the speed set at 60 rpm, then wash with ddH2O four times.Soak acid-washed coverslips in ddH2O for another 1 h on the same shaker, and rinse again with ddH2O twice.Dry the freshly cleaned coverslips at 90 rps for 10 sec by a KLM spin coater.Silanize air-dried coverslips with HMDS at 80 rps for 30 sec using a spin coater to ensure homogeneous silanization.Note: HMDS is volatile and inflammable, so coat the HMDS in a ventilation hood. Cut the 6 channel bottomless Ibidi sticky-slide into single channel slides (Figure 1), and mount to the silanized coverslip.Note: Mount coverslips and sticky-slide with some pressure until the bottom is sealed, otherwise the buffer in the channel will leak out.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180911/20180911230321_2150.jpgFigure 1. A photo of Ibidi sticky slides. The upper is the 6-channel slide; the lower is the 6- cutted single slides. Seed 120 μl prepared E. coli (8.",
    "4 x 106 CFUs) in PBS on silanized coverslip in the Ibidi channel at 37 °C for 30 min.Coat 120 μl fibrin (see Recipe 4) on the E. coli seeded coverslip for 15 min at RT.Wash the fibrin-coated slides 5 times with modified Tyrode’s buffer (pH 7.4; 120 μl) (Figures 2 and 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180911/20180911230338_9440.jpgFigure 2. Diagram of the experimental setup. The single Ibidi sticky slide channel is mounted on a silanized glass coverslip. The buffer is pipetted as indicated by the red arrows.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180911/20180911230446_6129.jpgFigure 3. A representative coverslip coated with fibrin and bacteria. Freshly cleaned and silanized glass coverslip was seeded with E. coli and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then coated with fibrin for 15 min at RT, and finally washed with Tyrode’s buffer. A. Phase contrast image of the coated channel. B. Fluorescent fibrin coating of the channel. C. Fluorescent E. coli bound to the channel. D. Merged channels. Scale bar = 10 μm.Microscopic observation of migrating platelets and bacterial captureSupplement modified Tyrode’s buffer pH 7.4 in a total volume of 240 μl with 104/μl human platelets, 1,000 μg/ml rHSA, 200 μM CaCl2, 2 μM U46619 and 4 μM ADP and add to above prepared channels coated with fibrin and live E. coli.Note: ADP, U46619 and CaCl2 synergistically trigger platelets activation and spreading. Albumin is an anti-adhesive protein that lowers substrate adhesiveness. Incubate the channel in Step D1 at 37 °C for 1 h and 20 min (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180911/20180911230426_5481.jpgFigure 4. A representative image of migrating platelets collecting fibrin-bound E. coli. Fibrin and live E. coli coated channel was incubated with 104/μl human platelets in the presence of 1,000 μg/ml rHSA, 200 μM CaCl2, 2 μM U46619 and 4 μM ADP in modified Tyrode’s buffer at 37 °C for 1 h and 20 min.",
    "Images show phase contrast (A) and epifluorescent micrographs (B and C). The black area in the fibrin image (B) indicates the area cleared by migrating platelets. Scale bar = 10 μm. E. coli accumulated on platelets and bacteria density is reduced in areas where platelets migrated (D).Assemble the Ibidi channel with a fluid tube connected to the syringe pump and place it on an inverted microscope with a heated stage.Note: Always carefully rule out air bubbles in the syringe and tube before the perfusion. Perfuse the channel with pre-warmed (37 °C) modified Tyrode’s buffer (pH 7.4) at 0.5 dyne/cm2 for 1 min to remove non-adhering bacteria and take phase contrast and epifluorescent images. Note: The flow rate Φ (ml/min) of the syringe pump is calculated by the following formulas provided by the instruction of sticky sides from Ibidi:τ = η x 97.1 x Φτ: Shear stress (dyne/cm2)η: Dynamical viscosity (dyn s/cm2)The dynamical viscosity of cell culture medium at 37 °C is ~0.007. Perfuse the channel with modified Tyrode’s buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C at 5 dyne/cm2 for 5 min and take images (Figure 5).Image acquisition: Filtercubes (Excitation/Emission): fibrin (Alexa 488) (494/528 nm); E. coli (tdTomato) (590/617 nm).Note: Deal with the waste of the perfusion buffer that contains bacteria properly according to the safety regulations.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180911/20180911230506_0106.jpgFigure 5. Representative images of bacteria trapped without platelets and with platelets after 0.5 dyne/cm2 and 5 dyne/cm2. The micrographs show the merged phase contrast and fluorescent images. Scale bars = 5 μm.Note: In the absence of platelets, the number of E. coli (magenta) on the fibrin (green) was reduced after perfusion. The white arrows indicate the E. coli that were flushed away. In contrast, the bacteria bundle collected by migrating platelets is resistant to shear stress."
