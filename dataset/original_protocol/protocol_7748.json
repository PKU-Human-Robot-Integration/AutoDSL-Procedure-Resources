    "BrdU administrationMice are injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) with 300 mg/kg bodyweight BrdU (15 mg/ml diluted in 0.9% NaCl) and perfused after 24 h to analyze proliferation of neural progenitor cells.Alternatively, to study survival and differentiation of new-born cells mice are injected i.p. on three consecutive days with 300 mg/kg bodyweight per day BrdU and perfused 4 weeks after to analyse BrdU-positive cells. Transcardial perfusionAnimals are anesthetized with an overdose of Rompun (14 mg/kg bodyweight) and Ketavet (100 mg/kg bodyweight) in 0.9% NaCl.Mice are transcardially perfused with 30 ml HBSS followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7. For transcardial perfusion the thorax cavity is opened, and the right auricle cut with a scissor to allow bleeding. A butterfly cannula is introduced into the left ventricle and mice are perfused with 30 ml HBSS followed by fixation with 10 ml 4% PFA. Brains are removed and post-fixed overnight in 10 ml 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7 in a 15 ml Falcon tube on a tube roller mixer at 4 °C. Tissue is washed twice with PBS and may be stored in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide for up to a year.Vibratome cuttingFor coronal vibratome sections (see Figure 1)The cerebellum is cut, removed.The brain glued upright with the cutting site using superglue onto the holder plate of the vibratome. Coronal sections may have a thickness of 50 μm or 100 μm.Note: The NeuN antibody does not very well penetrate 100 μm thick sections. If you have to use 100 μm thick sections primary antibody incubation should be 72 h. For sagittal brain sections (see Figure 1)Sagittal brain sections are embedded in 2% agarose in PBS.",
    "The brain is then glued in a solid gel block on the lateral side to the holder plate.Sagittal sections are cut 100 μm thick. Agarose can be removed from the slices after cutting or may be kept during the staining process in order to stabilize the tissue (especially olfactory bulbs). Sections are stored in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide at 4 °C. Tissue might be used for up to one year after perfusion.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130727/20130727221335_2028.pngFigure 1. Overview of neurogenic niches in coronal and sagittal brain sections (SVZ: subventricular zone; DG: dentate gyrus) Immunofluorescence stainingFor each mouse, 6 coronal brain slices (50 μm thick) 250 μm apart are stained, starting from the first slice, when both, upper and lower blade of the DG, are present on the slice. If saggital sections are used, 3 slices from each hemisphere 3 slices (300 μm) apart are used. Brain sections are placed in net carriers in 12 well plates (2 slices per well) filled with 4 ml 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.8% NaCl (TBS). The sections are washed three times in TBS each 15 min at RT on a rocking platform (50 rpm). BrdU staining BrdU staining requires DNA denaturization by incubating the brain sections in 2 N HCl (always prepare fresh) at 37 °C on a shaker for 30 min. Thereafter, sections are neutralized by washing in Boric buffer for 10 min on a shaker at RT. Next, sections are washed six times in TBS for 15 min each at RT. Blocking of unspecific antibody binding is performed by incubating sections for 1 h in TBS++ in net carriers at RT.Sections are transferred to 0.5 ml Eppendorf Safelock tubes (2 sections per tube) containing 200 μl TBS++ and the diluted primary antibodies, and incubated at 4 °C for 24-72 h.",
    "For this 12 tubes are put in a 50 ml Falcon and rotated at 4 °C on a tube roller mixer. A selection of primary antibodies is listed in Table 1.Table 1. Primary Antibody list table:",

Confocal microscopyConfocal microscope pictures can be taken with a 20x, 40x or 60x objective on a confocal microscope. Cell numbers can be counted manually or by using the Cell counter plug in of ImageJ. Cell numbers are normalized to the volume of the DG granule cell layer measured by ImageJ."
