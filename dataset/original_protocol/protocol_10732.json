    "1. Culture of Murine Myoblast Progenitor Cells or C2C12 Cells\nIsolate cells according to the protocol initially published by Shefer and colleagues 10 and later adapted by Collins et al. 11 and Boonen et al. 12 and store these in liquid nitrogen. This requires mice, e.g. C57Bl/6. Alternative methods are used in other labs, e.g. a method published in Journal of Visualized Experiments by Li Y et al. 13. For the reagents and equipment you are referred to the table on page 7 and 8. From the muscle from one mouse you will generally obtain enough cells to cryopreserve about 20 vials in liquid nitrogen. Next, we start the protocol to thaw the cells from the liquid nitrogen storage.\nPlace the cells from 1 vial into a 25 cm2 Matrigel (1 mg/ml) coated tissue culture flask and add growth medium (GM) consisting of (335 ml DMEM advanced, 100 ml fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 ml HS, 5 ml penicillin/streptomycin, 5 ml L-glutamin, 5 ml chicken embryo extract (CEE)).\nNote: coat for 2 hr at Room Temperature and remove the Matrigel by aspiration.\nSubculture the cells approximately 1:3 every 3 days.\n\tThis means: on day 3: Passage cells from one 25 cm2 to a 75 cm2 flask, on day 6: passage cells from one 75 cm2 flask to two 150 cm2 flasks (with 30 min preplating in uncoated flasks). On day 9 transfer one 150 cm2 flask to 1 triple 150 cm2 flask, or if unavailable to three 150 cm2 flasks (if needed preplate again depending on the phenotype of the cells). On day 12 the cells are ready for seeding into a muscle construct.\nNotes: - Per triple 150 cm2 the number of cells will be approximately 4.5 x 106 cells.",
    "- Use vials from different isolations to mix them to obtain a mixed population of cells at time of seeding.\nNote: If you choose not to work with primary cells, C2C12 myoblasts are a good alternative.\n2. Engineering Skeletal Muscle Tissues\nPrepare silicon glue by mixing the\"elastomer\" with the \"curing agent\" (10:1). Cut +/- 5 mm square segments of Velcro with one triangular side (house-like shape; Figure 1). Glue the Velcro into the wells of a 6-well culture plate at a space of approximately 12 mm between the squares.\nNotes: - Only use the soft side of the Velcro and face this side upwards.\n- Make sure that the rooftops face each other.\n- Only cover the Velcro with silicon glue, do not spread glue throughout the well.\n- For later electrical stimulation it is relevant to align the constructs in vertical direction of the well plate (along the long axis).\nLeave to dry overnight in vacuum oven, not heated, primarily to remove air bubbles. Sterilize by adding 70% EtOH to the wells and incubate for 15 min. Rinse 3x with PBS and put under UV for 15 min. Remove all PBS from the wells and the Velcro and place in incubator until use.\nThaw Matrigel solution in the fridge and prepare the collagen solution to the desired concentration shortly before making the 3D constructs. Dilute the stock collagen with sterile 0.02% acetic acid (final concentration 3.2 mg/ml).\nNote: leave everything on ice.\nTrypsinize the cells, resuspend in GM and count. Leave cells in centrifuge tube in the incubator.",
    "Add the desired amount of Collagen stock solution for the numbers of constructs that you want to make to a tube (according to Table 1), add 0.5M NaOH to this collagen solution until a light pink color is indicating a pH of 7.5. Mix gently by pipetting up and down and avoid bubble formation. Then add the Matrigel and mix very gently but thoroughly. Finally, add the GM to the Collagen/Matrigel mixture (for the appropriate amounts see Table 1).\nNotes: - Perform each step on ice! Matrigel and collagen will readily gel at increasing temperature.\n- Mind that the color indeed is pink! An increase in pH will also induce rapid gelation.\n- Final concentration of collagen: 1.6 mg/ml.\nCentrifuge the desired amount of cells at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nNote: - Depending on the activity of the cells the number of cells per construct needs to be adjusted. Typically, the number of cells lies between 750,000 and 1,250,000 cells per construct.\nUse some of the gel mixture to resuspend the cell pellet and transfer the cells into the remaining mixture and mix thoroughly, but without introducing air bubbles.\nTake the preheated well plates out of the incubator and pipette 0.35 -0.4 ml of the cell-gel mixture into the Velcro first. Then, begin to pipette the mixture from the center between the attachment sites and extend to the Velcro. Finally, use the remainder of gel to fill up the gap between the two Velcro anchors and pipette around the Velcro pieces.",
    "Carefully check after 5-10 min if the gels are solid enough to be transferred, i.e. gently tap the dishes and inspect visually if the gel is rigid. If so, carefully place the dishes in an incubator. Usually, they can be picked up after ten minutes. Then, after 1-2 hr, gently overlay each gel with 4 ml of warm GM.\nNote: -Do not make any vigorous movements when handling the plates.\nReplace GM by differentiation medium (growth medium without chick embryo extract) after 24 hr, and replace with fresh medium every 2-3 days. On day 7 you should have obtained mature oriented muscle fibers, as can be evaluated with staining for cross striation development in the fused muscle fibers.\n3. Electrical Stimulation\nSterilize the electrodes from the ionoptix plate (see table of reagents and equipment) before use with 70% ethanol and subsequently dry under UV in a safety cabinet. Place the plate with electrodes onto the culture plate with the constructs and cover with the lid from the culture plate and transfer to an incubator. Connect the Ionoptix C-pacer with the appropriate cables.\nNote: Electrodes are placed parallel alongside the muscle construct (Figure 2).\nApply the stimulation protocol as anticipated.\nNote: We generally use 4 V/CM, 6ms pulses at a frequency of 2Hz. Change culture medium every 24 hr during stimulation.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
