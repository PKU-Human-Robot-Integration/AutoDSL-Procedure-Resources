Representative image of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in the ampulla of oviduct\nCOCs can be seen in the swollen and translucent ampulla.\nNote: The ampulla is swollen and translucent such that the oocytes are visible. Be careful not to damage the oocytes by forceps. The heating stage (37°C) should be used to maintain temperature during oocyte manipulation.\nRemove cumulus cells surrounding oocytes by brief incubation in 1 mg/mL hyaluronidase and then wash oocytes in fresh M2 medium on the heating stage.\nCritical: Do not exceed 3 min exposure to hyaluronidase as it will damage the oocytes.\nFollowing oocyte collection and fertilization, the effect of NMN supplementation on oocyte and embryo quality can be assessed by 1) Antibody staining and confocal microscopy, go to step 5; 2) Dye staining and confocal microscopy, go to step 12; 3) Chromosome spreading, go to step 15; 4) Sperm binding assay, go to step 21; 5) In vitro fertilization and embryo culture, go to step 26.\nAntibody staining and confocal microscopy\nTiming: 1–1.5 days",
    "Fix 20–30 oocytes in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS (pH 7.4) at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nNote: It is better to prepare the fixation solution just before use if needed.\nPermeabilize oocytes in IF MPs at 20°C–25°C for 20 min.\nNote: Longer time of permeabilization will damage the oocytes.\nBlock oocytes in IF blocking buffer at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nNote: This step will reduce the background of the nonspecific binding of the primary antibody.\nIncubate oocytes with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nAlternatives: For some primary antibodies, oocytes can be incubated at 37°C for 4 h. In this case, the background of images might be higher.\nNote: The recommended antibody concentration: α-tubulin-FITC (1:200), LCA-FITC (1:100).\nWash oocytes in IF washing buffer, and then incubate them with the corresponding secondary antibodies at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nCounterstain oocytes with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/mL) at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nMount 10 oocytes in 2 μL of antifade mountant on the microscope slides and seal by coverslip with lanolin. Acquire images under the laser scanning confocal microscope immediately after mounting or store the slide at −20°C.\nDye staining and confocal microscopy\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nIncubate oocytes in M16 medium containing 500 nM cell permeant MitoTracker Red CMXRos, 2 μM MitoProbe JC-1, 10 μM dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA), or 10% Annexin-V-FITC at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 30 min for active mitochondrion staining, mitochondrial membrane potential assessment, DCFH staining, and Annexin-V staining, respectively.\nNote: The process of dye staining should be completed in dark to avoid the fluorescence quenching.\nWash oocytes three times in 0.1% BSA/PBS.",
    "Mount 10 oocytes in 2 μL of antifade mountant on the microscope slides and seal by coverslip with lanolin. Acquire images under the laser scanning confocal microscope immediately after mounting or store the slide at −20°C.\nCritical: For the measurement of fluorescence intensity, acquire images from both control and treated oocytes by following the same staining procedure and setting up the same imaging parameters of the confocal microscope. Apply Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) to define a region of interest (ROI) in the images, and determine the average fluorescence intensity per unit area within the ROI. Compare the final average intensities between aged and NMN-supplemented groups.\nChromosome spreading\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nWarm acidic Tyrode's solution (pH 2.5) and M2 medium to 37°C.\nTransfer oocytes into 50 μL Tyrode's solution for 30 s to remove the zona pellucida (ZP).\nNote: Too little exposure to the solution will not remove the ZP completely, which will prevent the oocytes from bursting and chromosomes from spreading. Too much exposure will damage and kill the oocytes. Watching the ZP dissolve under the dissection microscope can aid in optimizing the exposure time.\nCritical: Using fresh Tyrode's solution is critical, as its function declines with age. Use a fresh well of Tyrode's solution for each group of oocytes to ensure uniform digestion of the ZP. Tyrode's solution should be aliquoted and stored at −20°C.\nWash the oocytes by transferring into warmed M2 medium immediately after ZP removal.\nCritical: Be careful when transferring, as oocytes will easily stick together and to the glass pipette following removal of the ZP. Addition of 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone in the medium helps to prevent the oocytes from sticking.",
    "Recover oocytes in M2 medium for 10 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and then transfer them with as little M2 medium as possible into one drop of fixative on the microscope slide.\nNote: The transfer should be done within 30 s, using a microscope without a heating stage.\nObserve oocyte dissolution under the microscope and leave the slide to air dry at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nAfter air drying, stain the chromosomes with propidium iodide (PI) for 10 min and acquire images under the laser scanning confocal microscope.\nSperm binding assay\nTiming: 2–2.5 h\nBefore starting:\nEquilibrate HTF in the incubator for 12–16 h before use.\nRelease sperm by slicing the cauda epididymides (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) from 3-month-old male mice (sacrificed by cervical dislocation) with fine-tipped forceps in HTF medium, followed by 1 h of capacitation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/432-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative image of male reproductive system in the mouse\nMatured sperm can be collected from cauda epididymis.\nCalculate sperm concentration by computer-assisted sperm analysis system, and add 4 × 105/mL capacitated sperm to 100 μL HTF containing 20–30 ovulated oocytes and 5 two-cell embryos at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 30 min of binding.\nNote: Prepare two-cell embryos as a negative wash control ahead of time, as the sperm cannot bind to embryos.\nWash sperm binding to the ovulated oocytes with a wide-bore pipette to remove all but 2–6 sperm on the two-cell embryos (negative control).\nCritical: Watch the sperm binding to the oocytes under the dissection microscope when washing them. Too much or too little wash will affect the number of sperm binding to the oocytes.\nFix the oocytes with sperm in 4% PFA for 30 min, and stain them with Hoechst 33342 for 10 min.",
    "Quantify the bound sperm from z projections acquired by confocal microscope.\nIn vitro fertilization and embryo culture\nTiming: 5 days\nBefore starting:\nEquilibrate HTF in the incubator for 12–16 h before use.\nEquilibrate KSOM in the incubator for 12–16 h before use.\nRelease sperm by slicing the cauda epididymides from 3-month-old male mice with fine-tipped forceps in HTF medium, followed by 1 h of capacitation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAdd 4 × 105/mL capacitated sperm to 100 μL HTF containing 20–30 ovulated oocytes at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 5 h of incubation (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: The presence of two pronuclei is scored as successful fertilization.\nCritical: Observe the activity of sperm before addition to the oocytes, as it is critical for the success of the fertilization. If the sperm activity is weak, release the sperm from another male mouse immediately. (See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nTransfer the fertilized oocytes to a 96-well culture plate containing 100 μL KSOM medium covered with mineral oil at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for in vitro embryo culture for 4 days to the blastocysts.\nCritical: Do not frequently (more than once per day) take embryos out of the incubator to observe the development during the culture, as it will greatly impact the progression of embryonic development. (See Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7])\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. In vitro fertilization assay, related to step 27\n4 × 105/mL capacitated sperm are incubated with the ovulated oocytes in 100 μL HTF at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 h."
