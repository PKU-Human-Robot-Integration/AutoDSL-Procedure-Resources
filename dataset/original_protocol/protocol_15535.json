    "Animal work was conducted following the Catalan and Spanish laws (Real Decreto 53/2013) and the European Directives, with approval of the ethical committee (Comité Ètic d'Experimentació Animal, CEEA) of the University of Barcelona, and the local regulatory bodies of the Generalitat de Catalunya. Studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. This procedure is designed to be performed in adult mice, starting at 8 weeks of age, with no age limit. Examples of the surgical procedure developed in C57BL/6 mice of 10-12 weeks of age are provided here. Anatomical differences depending on mouse strain should be considered.\n1. Animal preparation\nBefore starting the surgical procedure, gather and sterilize all the required materials and tools. Set up the operating table with all the necessary surgical materials (listed in the Table of Materials).\nAnesthetize the animal using isoflurane inhalation in a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (30%/70%).\nAdminister buprenorphine (see Table of Materials) subcutaneously at a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg BW to provide analgesia and alleviate any pain and discomfort.\n\tNOTE: Analgesia is mandatory, but different protocols are accepted. Pain and discomfort signs must also be controlled during the first days after MCAo (see step 4). Apply corrective solutions when necessary.\nPlace the animal in an anesthesia induction box (see Table of Materials) with 5% isoflurane until it reaches a state of deep anesthesia (loss of reflex in paw puncture and ocular reflex).\nPosition the mouse on the operating table and decrease the level of isoflurane to 1.5%, delivered by face mask. Apply vet ointment to avoid eye dryness during the procedure.\nMaintain body temperature at 37 ± 0.5 °C controlled by a rectal probe connected to a heating pad (see Table of Materials).",
    "Shave the ventral part of the neck and the head (calvaria) with an electric razor. Carefully remove fur debris and disinfect the skin areas three times in circular movements with iodine-based disinfectant and 70% alcohol.\n\t.\n2. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) assessment with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF)\nWith scissors, make an incision on the skin of the head, in the direction of the sagittal suture, from the ears to the area between the eyes.\nRetract the skin and remove the periosteum on the right side of the skull.\nFind the coordinates (2.5 mm lateral from Bregma) and attach the Doppler holder (see Table of Materials) using cyanoacrylate. After the glue has dried, connect the Doppler probe and check for the correct signal readout.\n3. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo)\nTurn the mouse over to the supine position, and fix it to the surgical table with medical tape.\nMake a midline incision on the neck. Laterally pull back the skin and salivary glands using retractors (see Table of Materials) to expose the carotid territory.\nIdentify the vascular anatomy of the common carotid artery (CCA), the ICA, and the ECA, as well as the different arteries derived from them (maxillary and lingual, superior thyroid, occipital, and pterygopalatine) (Figure 1A).\nDetach the main arteries from the adjacent connective tissue so that they can be handled.\n\tNOTE: Take special care not to damage the nerves, especially the vagus nerve, which runs parallel to the CCA.\nWrap a 6-0 silk suture (see Table of Materials) around the ECA at the maxillary/lingual bifurcation. Tightly secure a knot to permanently interrupt the circulation.\nPass a second suture around the same artery, between the first knot and the CCA bifurcation, and keep this knot loose.",
    "Place a third thread around the CCA and tie a slip knot that can be easily untied.\n\tNOTE: This can also be carried out with a vascular clip, but the thread allows more movement and flexibility. At this stage it is possible to observe a first decrease in CBF in the LDF signal.\nPlace a vascular clip (see Table of Materials) interrupting blood circulation from the ICA.\nMake a small incision in the ECA, close to the area where the tight knot is located.\nInsert the monofilament until the thick coating has completely entered the arterial lumen.\nTighten the second knot to hold the monofilament inside the artery and prevent the pressure exerted by the blood from pushing it out (Figure 1B).\nRemove the vascular clip from the ICA.\nCut the ECA below the first knot and rotate the stump to orient it in the direction of the ICA (Figure 1C).\nAdvance the monofilament via the ICA until the point where the MCA branches out.\n\tNOTE: The occlusion is reflected in an abrupt blood flow drop in the LDF readout. We consider a successful occlusion when the drop in CBF is greater than 70% from the basal value. If CBF measurement systems are not available, the point of occlusion can be noted by the resistance to advance, which in adult mice is usually about 11 mm from the bifurcation of the CCA.\n\t\nIf anesthesia is continued during the occlusion period, monitor the mouse and keep it under constant observation for 45 min.\nIn case the mouse is awakened during the occlusion period, suture the skin of the neck with several stitches. Without disconnecting the LDF probe, place the mouse in the temperature-controlled box, allowing recovery from anesthesia.",
    "NOTE: It is common for the mouse to exhibit spontaneous circling behavior during this period, indicative of successful occlusion.\nAfter 40 min, anesthetize the mouse again following the same anesthesia and disinfection procedures as indicated in points 1.4, 1.5 and 1.7. Place it back on the surgical table, and remove the stitches from the neck.\nAfter 45 min of occlusion, loosen the knot holding the monofilament in place. Pull slowly and gently on the filament and check that tissue recanalization occurs.\nPull out the filament and tighten the knot to prevent blood loss.\nUntie the CCA knot. Ensure that there is no arterial wall damage.\nRemove the retractors and re-position the muscles, glands, and skin. Suture the skin (6-0) and apply disinfectant.\nDisconnect the Doppler probe, and detach the holder. Suture and disinfect the skin of the head.\nDuring the recovery period from anesthesia, leave the mouse in a cage provided with a heater to maintain the temperature. Keep it under constant observation until it is fully recovered from anesthesia. After recovery, the mouse can be returned to its cage.\n\t​NOTE: Housing with social enrichment is highly recommended. However, never mix operated mice with non-operated mice in the same cage without any physical separation in order to prevent aggression.\n4. Post-operative care\nPeriodically supervise the animals following the procedures and regulations established according to the local regulations. Provide analgesic treatment on the appropriate schedule to minimize pain after the surgery.\n\tNOTE: In the present study, the same analgesic was applied as at the beginning of the intervention (Buprenorphine 0.05mg/kg BW) at 6 h and 24 h after surgery.\nPerform euthanasia when the supervision parameters indicate so, following the institutionally approved protocols.",
    "Daily monitor the weight of the animals. Provide soft food to the animals during the first few days after surgery. In addition, hydrate them by subcutaneous injection of saline (200 µL) immediately after surgery and periodically thereafter if it is observed that the mouse does not hydrate on its own. Arrange food and water in a way that is easily accessible to the animal.\nOnce the in vivo study is completed, anesthetize the mice, euthanize them, and remove the brain tissue for further histopathological analysis (if needed).\nSubscription Required.
