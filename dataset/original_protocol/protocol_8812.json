    "NOTE: All experimental procedures are performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School, which follow national animal care guidelines, including Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of laboratory Animals, the ILAR Guide, and the Animal Welfare Act. Experimental procedures listed below detail exposure of the left DCN. Use sterile instruments while performing survival surgery.\n1. Primary Craniotomy and Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus Exposure\nAnesthesia\n\t\nAnesthetize a mouse, aged 8–12 weeks, weighing 18–24 g, with xylazine 20 mg/kg and ketamine 100 mg/kg via an intraperitoneal administration. Confirm proper anesthesia by monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, as well as toe pinch withdrawal reflex. Place vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Once adequately under anesthesia, shave hair overlying the scalp to provide unobstructed access to the surgical site.\nSurgical positioning\n\t\nPlace the mouse securely in a small animal stereotaxic holder, held in place by a snout clamp.\nEnsure that the snout clamp is loose enough to allow for adequate respiration but tight enough to completely immobilize the head of the mouse. If the mouse head is loose, the animal is likely to fall out of the head holder during the craniotomy portion of procedure.\nPlace auditory brainstem implant electrodes in standard fashion, which  allows for heart rate monitoring. Respiratory rate should be monitored by visualization. Note that normal heart rate and respiratory rate will vary depending on age of the mouse.\nA thermometer is placed and euthermia is ensured via placement on a homeothermic heating blanket.\nSkin incision and exposure of the interparietal and occipital bones of the skull",
    "Under a microscope, make a vertical incision through the skin starting at the midline, directly between the pinna, and extending to the caudal portion of the occiput. Following midline skin incision, displace the skin laterally. Visualize the muscles covering the left the posterior aspect of the skull.\nRemove muscle overlying the left parietal, interparietal, and occipital bones of the skull by disarticulation of muscle attachments to their respective bones with a scalpel or iris scissor. Observe a small degree of bleeding along cut muscle edges. Minimize this by gentle pressure with a cotton-tipped applicator for 10-15 sec.\nCraniotomy overlying Cochlear Nucleus\n\t\nIdentify relevant suture lines, including sagittal and lambda sutures lines (Figure 1, Left Panel).\nUsing rongeurs, make a craniotomy over the interparietal bone, left of midline, ~2 mm caudal to the lambda suture line. This region overlies the DCN.\nFollowing craniotomy, observe a thin layer of dura that overlies the cerebellum. Using a scalpel blade, remove the dura. (Figure 1, Middle Panel).\n\t\tNOTE: Removal of dura may cause a small degree of bleeding. This process of using the scalpel blade to remove the dura is intended to reduce the amount of blood loss during the cerebellum aspiration, which will pool on the brainstem surface and obscure identification of the DCN. Total blood volume of mouse is ~1.5 ml should not exceed > than 15%. If bleeding exceeds this amount, the mouse should be provided with  with fluid supplementation. \nRemove coagulated blood overlaying the cerebellum with the cotton tip applicator. Optionally, gently drip saline using a dental point onto the cerebellum to clear blood away blood.\nCerebellar Aspiration",
    "Using a 5 French suction, aspirate the lateral-most portion of the left cerebellum overlying the DCN until the DCN is visual (Figure 1, Right Panel). Remove approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the left cerebellum. The main landmark adjacent to the DCN is the ampulla of the superior semicircular canal.\n\t\tNOTE: Aspiration of the cerebellum is the key step of the protocol. Directed aspiration of the cerebellum is most successfully performed if it occurs in a single attempt and not with multiple passes of the suction as this will cause bleeding. To assist in aspiration, set the focal plane of the microscope at the expected depth of the CN, which will be slightly distal to the surface of the cerebellum. Setting the focal plane to the CN will improve visualization and ensure a sharp image.\nFollowing aspiration, further bleeding, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) build-up, and cerebellum displacement on the DCN are expected. Instill 0.5 cc of sterile saline quickly into the craniotomy to prevent blood coagulation. A combination of gentle dabbing with a dental point and suction may then be used to clear away a path for direct visualization of the DCN. Do not directly contact the surface of the DCN.\n2. Pressure Microinjection for Virus-mediated Gene Transfer and Surgical Recovery\nAfter the DCN is free of overlying blood and CSF and is clearly visible, make pressure microinjections into the DCN using a 10 µl Hamilton syringe over a 2 min period.\nIntroduce the needle with a micromanipulator until the tip is no longer visible under the surface of the DCN.",
    "For optimal performance, use a 33 or 34 gauge needle (use a gastight syringe with the 34 gauge needle) with a shallow bevel, such as 45°, to minimize blunt trauma and localize the injection volume within the DCN, which is a thin and shallow brainstem structure (<300 µm thick).\n\tNOTE: Other microinjection instruments may be utilized based. Ideally, the injection instrument should be flexible to allow for some slight bend, if needed to directly target the DCN. Further, as the mouse moves slightly throughout the procedure due to respiration, the instrument should be robust enough to withstand minor amounts of movement.\n3. Surgical Recovery\nImmediately following injection, re-approximate the skin and allow the mouse to recover per standard recovery procedure. Remaining cerebellum and scar tissue will fill in the cavity caused by aspiration of the cerebellum. Constantly monitor animals until sufficient consciousness is regained to maintain sternal recumbency. Monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, as well as ability to feed.\n\tNOTE: No animal that has undergone surgery is returned to a cage with other animals until fully recovered.\nIf a mouse begins to walk in circles post-operatively (<5% of cases), typically 2-4 hr after closure of the skin incision, immediately sacrifice the mouse, as it would likely have a difficult time feeding. This side effect is likely due to aspiration of the cerebellum. The animal should be monitored for pain postoperatively, and appropriate narcotics should be given to ensure animal comfort based on institutional standards. Antibiotics may be necessary, if evidence of infection.\n4. Secondary Craniotomy and Cochlear Nucleus Exposure\nAfter 2-4 weeks of healing and virus-mediated gene transfer incubation, re-anesthetize a previously injected mouse and repeat step 1.1-1.5 Optimal incubation time varies with the type of gene transferred.",
    "Remove scar tissue over the craniotomy site by a combination of tweezers, scalpel, and rongeurs.\nAfter visualizing the craniotomy, identify a combination of remaining cerebellum and scar tissue overlying the DCN. Use a 5 French suction to aspirate overlying cerebellum/scar tissue (similar to the previous cerebellar aspiration).\nFollowing aspiration, expect further bleeding, CSF build-up, and remaining bits of cerebellum. Quickly introduce saline into the craniotomy to prevent blood coagulation. Use a combination of gentle dental point dabbing and suction to clear the path for direct visualization of the DCN.\nObserve the surface of the DCN. Perform optogenetics-based physiology experiments as DCN is now accessible. Introduce a light stimulus, for example with an optical fiber (Figure 2), to drive an optogenetics-based experiment.\n5. Histology\nFollowing conclusion of experiments, euthanize the mouse with an overdose of ketamine. Perfuse the mouse with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.\nExtract the brainstem from the skull and post-fix for 2 hr. Cryoprotect the brainstem in 30% sucrose for 24-48 hr. Section the brainstem using a standard cryostat using 60 µm sections.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
