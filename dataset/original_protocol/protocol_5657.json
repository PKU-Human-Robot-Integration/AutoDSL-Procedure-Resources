    "The whole procedure is summarized in Figure 1. All animal experiments were performed in accordance to Swiss animal welfare legislation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227230531_0925.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the procedure. The scheme summarizes the principal steps of this protocol for assessing in vivo inflammasome activation via peritoneal injection of MSU.MSU injection into the peritoneal cavity (see Video 1, which shows how to perform intraperitoneal injections)    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Procedure to perform intra-peritoneal injections  Prepare MSU suspension: add 0.5 ml of sterile PBS to one vial of MSU crystals (5 mg) and vortex thoroughly (> 5 min for initial resuspension, later vortex for 1 min is sufficient) to obtain a suspension of 10 mg/ml MSU. Note: MSU crystals do NOT dissolve in PBS and are injected as a suspension. Do not centrifuge; vortex for 1 min prior to use.Mark each mouse by ear punch or toe clipping as per local animal welfare legislation and animal experimental license. Note: Since the experiment lasts max 16 h, mice can also be marked transiently using a waterproof bench marker.Inject 180 μl of MSU suspension or 180 μl sterile PBS (control mice) into the peritoneal cavity using an insulin syringe:Vortex the MSU suspension before drawing into the syringe.Hold the mouse slightly inclined towards its head.Insert the needle at a 30°-45° angle. Make sure that you are in the peritoneal cavity and slowly inject the suspension.Peritoneal lavage and collection of cellsPerform peritoneal lavage as shown in Video 2 at the desired time-point of analysis (typically 4 h, 8 h, and 16 h after MSU injection):    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 2. Procedure to perform a peritoneal lavage  Euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation or CO2-asphyxiation.Note: Process one mouse after each other, the mice should not become stiff before the cell harvest is complete.",
    "Take care that no blood vessels bleed into the peritoneal cavity when euthanizing by cervical dislocation.Open the skin of the belly carefully without damaging the peritoneum.Inject 5 ml PBS into the peritoneal cavity using a 25 G needle.Shake the mouse for 2-3 min.Aspirate the PBS from the peritoneal cavity using the same syringe, transfer into a 50 ml conical tube, measure the amount of recovered PBS.Note: An experienced experimenter recovers approx. 4 ml of the injected PBS.Determine the cell concentration per ml using a Neubauer counting chamber or an automated cell counter. Note: Red cell lysis is not required, but make sure not to count red blood cells, debris, or dead cells.Flow cytometry to characterize cell infiltrateTake 1 x 106 cells from each lavage, spin down, transfer to FACS tube. Resuspend the cells in 50 μl PBS containing:AlexaFluor anti-Ly6G antibody, 1 μg/ml;Fitc anti-Ly6B.2 antibody, 1 μg/ml;PE-CF594 anti-CD3ε antibody, 0.5 μg/ml;Pacific Blue anti-CD45 antibody, 0.5 μg/ml;Zombie-NIR Live-dead discriminator (dilute 1:800).Incubate for 20 min on ice in the dark.Add 100 μl FACS buffer to each tube.Spin down at 350 x g for 5 min.Remove supernatant and wash once more with 100 μl FACS buffer.Resuspend in 100 μl FACS buffer and proceed to analysis at Flow cytometer. Figure 2 shows typical results and gating strategy used to identify live, single, CD45+ cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227231125_5645.jpgFigure 2. Gating strategy. Gating strategy to exclude debris, doublets, and dead cells from the analysis.CD45+, Ly6G+, Ly6B.2+ cells are neutrophils. Figure 3A shows typical flow cytometry dot plots when gated on single, live CD45+ cells. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227231207_1737.jpgFigure 3.

Representative results of relative and absolute numbers of infiltrating neutrophils (left) and T cells (right). Each point represents one mouse.",
    "Quantification of IL-1β in peritoneal lavageTake 0.5 ml of peritoneal lavage from Step B6.Spin the cells down, use supernatant for the analysis.Note: IL-1β levels can be rather low; do not dilute the supernatant for ELISA analysis.Perform IL-1β ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Figure 4 shows typical results of IL-1β ELISA on peritoneal lavages.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227231304_9752.jpgFigure 4. Representative data from ELISA measurement. IL-1β ELISA from peritoneal lavage collected from WT and NLRP3-/- mice 8 h after intra-peritoneal MSU injection. For the lavage, 3 ml of PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity. Each dot represents one mouse."
