    "Removal of vibrissae (Figure 1)Sacrifice 3-5 weeks old K12rtTA/rtTA/TetO-Cre/RosamTmG mice with ketamine/xylazine injection followed by cervical dislocation.Remove the lip pad containing vibrissae with scissors and place in Stem Cell Media.Under a dissecting microscope, remove the subcutaneous fat and connective tissue with forceps and scissors to expose the rows of vibrissae. Remove individual vibrissae by pulling away from the pad using fine forceps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515001656_1214.jpgFigure 1. Isolation of the hair follicle bulge region from K12rtTA/rtTA/TetO-Cre/RosamTmG reporter mice. A. Diagram of the triple transgenic mouse model showing the inducible, tissue-specific nature of the system. B. Scheme showing isolation of the hair follicle bulge region. bg–bulge region. Parts Reprinted with permission from Blazejewska et al., 2009.Isolation of hair follicle-derived stem cellsExpose the epithelial cores of the vibrissae by cutting the collagen capsule, loosening it from the core and pulling it down along the hair shaft. Section the epithelial cores into three portions (Figure 2). Place the middle portion containing the hair follicle bulge region into a 35-mm dish containing 2 ml of collagenase (2 mg/ml) and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h in order to remove any residual mesenchymal remnants of the capsule. Transfer the partially digested hair follicle bulge region to another 35-mm dish containing 5 ml dispase/trypsin (2.4 U/0.05%) solution and digest for 1.5 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber to obtain a single-cell suspension of epithelial cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515001910_2062.jpgFigure 2. Scheme for the clonal growth assay. The bulge region of the hair follicle is separated via mechanical dissection and enzymatically dissociated. The cells are plated on a 3T3 feeder layer and allowed to form holoclones (white circle at 2 weeks). The red channel depicts the membrane-bound tomato red fluorescence as these cells were derived from the reporter mice described in Figure 1.",
    "Preparing feeder layerAdd Mitomycin C (40 μg/ml) to a 70% confluent dish of NIH3T3 cells and incubate in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h.Replace the Mitomycin C with 3T3 media.Trypsinize and seed at 2 x 105 cells per well of a 6-well culture plate.Expansion/clonal growth assayEnrich stem and progenitor cells by seeding at 1 x 103 cells/cm2 onto a Mitomycin C inactivated NIH 3T3 feeder layer in a 6-well culture dish (see above).Cultivate for 14-21 days in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to obtain holoclones (Figure 2). Change the medium every 2 days. Cultivate until holoclones are obtained. These will be large colonies containing tightly packed cells.Subcultivation of hair follicle stem cellsRemove the 3T3 feeder layer with Versene for 60 sec at room temperature.Wash 2 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).Remove the attached holoclones with trypsin (0.25% Trypsin-EDTA) for 15 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Centrifuge at 170 x g for 5 min.Cells are ready for application of choice (Note 6)."
