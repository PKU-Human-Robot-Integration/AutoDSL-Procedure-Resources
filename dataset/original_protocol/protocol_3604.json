HaloTag is a mutant bacterial haloalkane dehalogenase that can specifically form a covalent bond with its substrate, such as a functional small molecule conjugated with a 6-chlorohexyl group.

We observed a high rate of cell death and an increased population of cells in which the HaloTag was mislocalized upon using a higher amount of the plasmid DNA (250 ng).\nNote: Other transfection reagents can be used instead of FuGENE HD.

Otherwise, diffusion of the added solution may not be efficient and quick responses might not be obtained upon the addition of ZPT and TPEN solutions.\nCritical: Do not use higher laser power to avoid photobleaching of the probes. In our study, we used 0.2% laser power (Head output: 473 nm: 15 mW; 559 nm: 15 mW).\nCritical: Adjust the values of HV and gain so that the ZnDA-1H fluorescence signals are not saturated upon the addition of ZPT.\nCritical: Avoid adding TPEN and ZPT solutions during scanning.",
    "Note: In our study, we used only the 60× silicone oil immersion objective lens (UPLSAPO60XS2, NA 1.30) for quantifying Zn2+ concentration. Although our method is theoretically independent of the type of objective lens, it is desirable to use an objective lens with a larger NA to obtain sufficiently high signals with a lower laser power considering that the photobleaching of the probes impairs quantitativeness.\nNote: In principle, this quantification method can be applied not only to confocal microscopy but also to other fluorescence microscopic techniques as long as the quantitativeness of the detected fluorescence signals is maintained.\nNote: Step 64: When searching the cells for imaging, use a larger CA value (for example 300) rather than a higher laser power to detect lower ZnDA-1H fluorescence signals at the steady-state and to avoid photobleaching.\nNote: Steps 67 and 68: Disconnect the Luer fittings, add the solution into the tube using a micropipette, and retain the solution in the middle of the tube. Reconnect the Luer fittings, and when the time for addition comes, drip the solution slowly into the dish by pushing air through the syringe.\nImage processing and analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis method describes how to process the time-lapse imaging data using the Fiji software to quantify labile Zn2+ concentration (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/529-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Note: Step 80: We used the Kd value determined at pH 6.5 for the estimation of [Zn2+]Golgi as the pH in the Golgi can vary from 6.7 to 6.0. You can also estimate [Zn2+]Golgi at a different pH by applying different Kd values determined under different pH conditions."
