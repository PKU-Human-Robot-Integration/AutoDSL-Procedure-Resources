    "Adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 20-30 g, 8-10 weeks of age were purchased from the Animal Centre of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University and were performed in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals proposed by the Institute of Animal Resources and published by the National Institutes of Health. Excel and Origin 8.5 were used for data acquisition and analysis. Data are presented as means ± SD, for statistical evaluation, Student's t test was used and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n1. Solution and perfusion apparatus preparation\nAssemble a constant flow Langendorff apparatus (commercially available or self-made). Figure 1 provides a simple schematic.\nPrepare the solutions according to the reagents given in Table 1 and Table 2.\nTurn on the circulating water bath and adjust a suitable input temperature (42.7 °C in our laboratory) to ensure that the perfusate circulation system's outflow from the cannula reaches 37 °C.\nClean the perfusion system by circulating deionized water. If a sterile condition is required, run 75% ethanol through the perfusion system for 15 min, followed by deionized water (at least 10 cycles to avoid alcohol toxicity effects on the heart).\nMeasure the time and volume for one cycle of the perfusate circulation system to determine how many milliliters of oxygenated Tyrode's solution to be loaded in the following perfusion step.\nSterilize all the surgical tools in the desired method.\nSet the flow rate of the perfusate perfusion system at 4 mL/min.\nPrepare two clean 35 mm Petri dishes-one containing Tyrode's solution (Petri dish 1), the other containing solution 1 (Petri dish 2).",
    "Prepare a 1 mL syringe filled with solution 1 and a 20 G blunt steel cannula needle with a notch from where the distance is 1 mm to the tip. Prepare a loose knot with 3-0 suture to the cannula shaft. Regulate the viewing field of the stereomicroscope and ensure that the cannula tip is below the liquid surface of Petri dish 2.\n2. Animal preparation\nAdminister heparin (concentration, 1,000 IU/mL; 0.2 mL/mouse) intraperitoneally to the mice to avoid blood clots. After 10 min, anesthetize the mice with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, I.P. injection) and ensure that the mice stop responding to tail/toe pinches. Perform cervical dislocation 20 min after heparin administration.\nTransfer the mice onto the surgical platform, fix the mice in a supine position, sterilize the chest with 75% ethanol, and dry it with gauze or napkin.\n3. Heart excision and aorta cannulation\nLift the skin of the xiphoid with tissue forceps and make a minor lateral incision through the skin with tissue scissors. Perform a blunt dissection between the skin and fascia and extend the incision of the skin in a V-shape toward the axillae on both sides.\n\t\nContinue the same incision trace through the rib cage, and then, deflect the rib cage upward by clamping the sternum with tissue forceps to fully expose the heart and lungs.\nPeel off the pericardium using a curved forceps. Tear the thymus gland toward both sides by two curved forceps if it covers the great vessels. Gently pull the base of the heart toward the tail with curved forceps until a \"Y\"-shaped blood vessel (the aorta and its branch arteries) can be seen.",
    "To reserve different lengths of the aorta for cannulation and comparison, transect the aorta at the left common carotid artery (green line in Figure 2) and cut the brachiocephalic artery at the same time in some mice. Transect at the ascending aorta in other mice (black line in Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: For those who are new to this procedure, this step can also be done under a stereoscopic microscope.\nExcise the heart, and immediately immerse in Petri dish 1 to wash and pump out the residual blood.\nTransfer the heart to Petri dish 2, and trim any surplus tissue using fine iris scissors if necessary. For those who are new to this procedure, do this step under the stereomicroscope to avoid erroneously cutting the aorta or other heart structures.\nPush the syringe to expel air bubbles before aorta cannulation. Perform retrograde aorta cannulation with the assistance of two straight tying forceps (smooth jaws) under the stereomicroscope. Ensure that the whole cannulation process is under the liquid surface.\nAvoid penetrating the aortic valves and adjust the depths to the ascending aorta (the mouse that the aorta was transected at the left common carotid artery) and the aortic root (the mouse that the aorta was transected at the ascending aorta), respectively.\n\tNOTE: The depth of aorta cannulation (referred to as simply as depth) is defined here as the position where the cannula tip is in the aorta or where the aorta is ligated.\nLigate the aorta with the pre-knot 3-0 suture to the cannula notch. Gently press the syringe content to rinse the residual blood.\n\tNOTE: The blood will leave the coronary arteries and effuse from the dorsal veins If the depth is properly positioned. The heart and the atrial appendages will expand and become pale.",
    "Remove and connect the cannula to the Langendorff apparatus. Once again, take care to avoid any air bubbles entering the heart.\n\t​NOTE: Be aware that the time from thoracotomy to initial perfusion should not exceed 5 min.\n4. Heart perfusion\nFirst, prime and perfuse oxygenated Tyrode's solution for approximately 10 s (the volume of liquid running 10 s in the system used in this protocol is approximately 0.7 mL) if there is residual blood in the atria, and then switch to solution 1. However, just perfuse with solution 1 If there is no residual blood in the atria. Perfuse the heart for approximately 2 min.\nSwitch to solution 3. Suck about 2.5 mL of solution 3 with a single-use sterile polyethylene pipet and prewarm it in the water bath for later use, with the remainder used for perfusion for approximately 11-12 min. Discard solution 3 perfused in the first 2 min. Recycle the rest to the perfusate reservoirs by the peristaltic pump for reuse until digestion is completed.\nTerminate the digestion when the heart becomes swollen and turns slightly pale and flaccid (spongy texture) or an imprint exists if the myocardium is gently pinched using a toothed forceps.\n5. Cell isolation and calcium reintroduction\nRemove the ventricles and the atria with forceps, and place them in different Petri dishes. Add the prewarmed solution 3 to the Petri dishes.\nTriturate the tissue into a turbid texture with blunt forceps and gently pipette the tissue for even digestion. Avoid introducing air bubbles.\nTransfer the turbid digested tissue with the pipette into solution 4 to arrest the remaining enzyme activity, and then centrifuge for 20 s at 192×g. Remove the supernatant and add solution 5 into the cell sediment and pipette to evenly disperse the cells.",
    "Reintroduce calcium in a stepwise manner in order to avoid calcium paradox and calcium overload. Gradually add in a total of 50 µL 100 mM/L CaCl2 (at every 5 min interval of 5 µL, 10 µL, 15 µL, and 20 µL, respectively) to the cell suspension.\n6. Cell storage\nFor the patch clamp study, store the cells in Tyrode's solution. For other cellular studies, store the cells in solution 6.\nTo ensure the accuracy of acute functional studies' (e.g., Ca2+ sparks, Ca2+ waves, Ca2+ release, Ca2+ leak, and patch clamp recordings) results, finish these kinds of functional experiments within the next 6 h."
