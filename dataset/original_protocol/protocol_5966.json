    "Priming and generation of CTL Pmel-CD8 cells in vitro (Benkhoucha et al., 2013)For bulk cultures, single cell suspensions were prepared from one or pool of spleens of 8 to 10 weeks old unimmunized Pmel-1 transgenic mice*.Note: *Thy1.1+ Pmel-1 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 CD45.2 background, whose TCR recognizes an H2Db restricted epitope corresponding to amino acids 25-33 of murine and human gp100 (hgp10025-33). Gently homogenize spleens and pass through a 70 μm Nylon cell strainer (Falcon, BD Biosciences).Lyse red blood cells with ACK lysing buffer (BioWhittaker) for 5 min at RT.Count mononuclear cells from one spleen and suspend in culture medium (DMEM) at 5 x 106 cells/ml, and then expose the cells to 10 μg/ml human gp10025-33 peptide (KVPRNQDWL) for 1 h at 37 °C.After three washes with DMEM, culture mononuclear cell populations in 150 cm2 cell culture flasks (20 ml of medium). Add IL-2 (50 IU/ml; PeproTech) to cultures at Days 2 and 4.On Day 5, collect cells from culture plates, wash 5 min at 1,200 rpm with medium and then proceed functional (in vitro killing assay, not shown here) and phenotypic assays (see Figure 1, intracellular FACS staining: IFNγ, Granzyme B, Perforin, FasL). More than 98% of the bulk cells are CD3+ CD8+ T cells after 5 days of culture.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112233951_8727.jpgFigure 1. Representative plots (histogram) of Granzyme B, perforin, IFN-γ and FasL on Day 5 differentiated Pmel-1 CD3+ CD8+ T cellsOnce we checked the CTLs phenotype, they will be injected intravenously to recipient mice (106 cells/mouse) (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112234012_7507.jpgFigure 2.

    "gp10025-33 peptide-loading of the target cellLyse 108 Splenocytes (from CD45.1 C57BL6/J mice) in RBC lysis buffer for 3 min at 37 °C and then wash twice with PBS.Resuspend cells in RPMI-1640 complete medium.Count the mononuclear cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer.Resuspend cells at 5 x 106/ml of RPMI-1640 complete medium.Divide the cells equally into two separate 50 ml Falcon tubes–one for peptide-pulsed target cells (will be stained with CFSE), and the other for unpulsed target cells (will be stained with brilliant violet).Add to one part of the cells (peptide-pulsed) gp10025-33 peptide at 1 μg/ml.Add an equivalent amount of PBS to the unpulsed target cells.Incubate the cells in a 37 °C water bath (or in incubator 37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 h.Wash cells twice with RPMI-1640 complete medium.Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cell pellet in HBSS.CFSE labeling of peptide-pulsed target cells under sterile conditionsCount all live cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer.Resuspend the cells in HBSS at 5 x 107/ml.Thaw an aliquot of 5 mM stock CFSE solution.Incubate the pulsed target splenocytes with CFSE: Add 1 μl of the 5 mM stock CFSE for each milliliter of pulsed target cells (final concentration of 5 μM).Pipette cells up and down to mix well and incubate in a water bath for 10 min at 37 °C. Gently agitate the cells periodically.Add 10x the volume of pre-warmed RPMI-1640 complete medium to the CFSE-labeled cells to stop the reaction.Pellet cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in cold RPMI-1640 complete medium.Wash the cells two more times with cold RPMI-1640 complete medium.Count the mononuclear cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemacytometer.Wash the cells with cold PBS.",
    "Resuspend the cell populations in PBS at 5 x 106/ml.BV labeling of unpulsed target cells under sterile conditionsCount all live cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer.Resuspend the cells in HBSS at 5 x 107/ml.Thaw an aliquot of 5 mM stock BV (cellTraceTM) solution.Incubate the unpulsed target splenocytes with BV: Add 1 μl of the 5 mM stock BV for each milliliter of unpulsed target cells (final concentration of 5 μM).Pipette cells up and down to mix well and incubate at RT for 20 min (protected from light). Gently agitate the cells periodically.Add 10x the volume of pre-warmed RPMI-1640 complete medium to the BV-labeled cells to stop the reaction.Pellet cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in cold RPMI-1640 complete medium.Wash the cells two more times with cold RPMI-1640 complete medium.Count the mononuclear cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemacytometer.Wash the cells with cold PBS.Resuspend the cell populations in PBS at 5 x 106/ml.Five hours after the CTLs injection into three mice, combine an equal volume (~equal numbers) of peptide-pulsed CFSE cells with unpulsed BV cells and proceed with i.v. injection (105 cells/mouse) in recipient mice.Note: Keep 50,000 cells from the mix at 4 °C for the flow cytometry analysis (input ratio) (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112234032_2967.jpgFigure 3.
