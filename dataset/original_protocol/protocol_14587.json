    "Ethics statement: Prior to collecting cells from human subjects, informed consent and ethics approval must be obtained.\n1. Prepare Stain\nNOTE: Prepare stain on day of experiment.\nAdd 5 µl Ethidium (or 4 µM) and 5 µl Calcein AM (or 4 µM) to 2.5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in 15 ml centrifuge tube; mix. Wrap in aluminum foil to shield from light and store at RT until use.\n2. Collect Cells\nRemove cell culture inserts from their package and label for each eyelid to be sampled. Mark orientation of cell collection on the side of the membrane plastic holder using permanent marker. Conduct slit lamp inspection at moderate magnification (approximately 20X) to confirm appropriate health of the region to undergo IC.\nDispense one drop of topical anesthetic (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride) in the lower conjunctival sac of each eye and instruct participant to keep eyes closed for one minute.\nEvert upper eye lid and hold in place by the lashes; avoid any contact with the lid wiper area.\n\tOptional: the aid of a secondary investigator may be required to perform this step.\nApply membrane perpendicularly onto the central part of the lid wiper region with minimal pressure.\nHold membrane in place for 3 - 5 sec. Observe the membrane become translucent in the contact area. At this point, gently remove the membrane and permit the participant's lid to \"flip\" back into place.\nPromptly apply one drop of PBS to the sample, to prevent it from drying out. Membrane will turn translucent and should not turn opaque at any time, as this indicates drying. Have the secondary investigator proceed immediately with processing of samples (section 3).",
    "Conduct final eye check to ensure integrity of the conjunctiva. Dispense ocular lubricants and instruct participant to avoid rubbing their eyes until anesthetic effect wears off (approx. 15 min).\n3. Sample Processing\nUsing micro-scissors, cut the membrane in half (one half for each of the downstream analyses), perpendicular through the middle of the cell collection. Cut along the outer margin of one membrane half to separate it from the plastic holder; avoid interaction with the collected cells on the membrane, including ensuring that the membrane does not fold onto itself.\nSecure the membrane using tweezers before completely detaching from holder. Place membrane into labelled 2 ml centrifuge tube containing 500 µl of 95% (v/v) ethanol and leave to fix for a minimum of 20 min to a maximum of 2 hr before processing (section 4.2).\nImmediately separate second half of membrane (as described in section 3.2) and promptly proceed with section 4.1.\n4. Sample Staining\nImmunocytochemical Staining\nCarefully place membrane in 35 mm glass bottom culture dish with collection side facing down; ensure membrane is flat.\nPipette 20 µl of immunocytochemical stain composition assembled in section 1 on to the membrane. If sample curls up, use disposable pipette tips to carefully flatten the membrane by pushing its edges down. Avoid contact with cell collection areas.\nGently cover the membrane with glass cover slip. Avoid unnecessary movement of sample. Cover dish with lid and seal with lab-film around the edges. Do not obstruct transparency of dish (top and bottom) and visibility of sample. Label with lab marker.\nImmediately proceed with imaging (section 5.1), then return to section 4.2 to continue with cytological staining of the other half of the membrane.\nCytological Staining",
    "Gradually hydrate membrane by slowly adding 500 µl of distilled water to the tube used for fixation in section 3.4. Aspirate contents several times into pipette tip to mix, then remove contents.\nAdd 500 µl of distilled water. Let stand for a few seconds, then remove. Add 500 µl of Alcian Blue stain and leave for 3 min. Remove stain and perform 3 consecutive 500 µl distilled water rinses or until liquid rinses clear.\nAdd 500 µl of Hematoxylin # 1 stain and leave for 3 min. Remove stain and perform three consecutive 500 µl distilled water rinses or until liquid rinses clear. Dehydrate (reverse of section 4.2.1) by aspirating the clear liquid.\nAdd 500 µl of Papanicolaou OG-6 stain and leave for 3 min. Remove stain and perform one 500 µl 95% (v/v) ethanol rinse.\nAdd 500 µl of Papanicolaou EA-65 stain and leave for 3 min. Remove stain and perform 3 consecutive 500 µl 95% (v/v) ethanol rinses.\nFully dehydrate using three consecutive 500 µl 100% ethanol rinses. Using tweezers, remove sample from solution; avoid touching cell collection areas.\nPlace membrane on glass slide; ensure that cell collection line is either parallel or perpendicular to slide margin for easier alignment during imaging.\nApply a drop of 100% ethanol and cover with glass slip. Immediately proceed with imaging (section 5.2).\n5. Sample Imaging\nImaging Fluorescent Immunocytochemical Stains\nUse a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM)11 or fluorescence microscope12, equipped with a digital color camera, connected to a computer running an image acquisition software. Due to the samples being contained within culture dishes, an inverted microscope may be necessary.\nSet up microscope11,12 according to absorption and emission spectra of ethidium homodimer-1 (528/617 nm Ex/Em maxima in the presence of DNA) and calcein AM (494/517 nm Ex/Em maxima).",
    "Select the microscope's lowest magnification (e.g., 2.5X objective) and activate the digital imaging system; observe the sample displayed on the computer monitor.\nInspect sample for cellular features of interest.\nSelect desired microscope magnification and acquire images using imaging software.\nSave files in either native microscope file format or an uncompressed file format (e.g., *.raw, *.tiff).\nImaging Cytological Stains\nUse a standard laboratory bright-field microscope with no filters, equipped with a digital color camera, connected to a computer running an image acquisition software.\nPlace and lock glass slide (from step 4.2.8) on microscope stage. Rehydrate sample with 100% ethanol as needed, throughout the entire imaging procedure.\nSelect the microscope's lowest magnification (e.g., 2.5X objective) and activate the digital imaging system; observe the sample displayed on the computer monitor.\nEnsure cell collection is aligned with either X or Y axis of microscope stage control. Adjust if needed, by removing the cover slip and rotating the sample using a pipette tip or tweezers.\nUsing the imaging software, capture image(s) of the entire sample with the lowest microscope magnification.\nSwitch to moderate microscope magnification (e.g., 10 - 20X objective) and adjust microscope light source and software imaging parameters (exposure, contrast, white balance, etc.), and disable their automated software metering. Save these settings for future use.\nDetermine beginning and end points of scan (e.g., top left and bottom right corners of cell collection).\nUsing the imaging software, capture image(s) of the entire cell collection area within the starting and end points. Ensure a 20% side-to-side and top-to-bottom overlap between all adjacent images.\nSave files using the native microscope file format or an uncompressed file format (e.g., *.raw, *.tiff).",
    "Generate final panoramic image using automated stitching software of choice (e.g., Adobe Photoshop Elements). Use reference images taken at step 5.2.5) to confirm the accuracy of the automated stitching in the final image.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
