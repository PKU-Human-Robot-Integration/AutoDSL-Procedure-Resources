    "Note: Isolation of peritoneal macrophages as well as MDSCs should be performed under sterile conditions. Macrophage isolationInject intraperitoneally (i.p.) 3-4 naïve Balb/c mice with 1 ml of sterile 3% thioglycolate 4-5 days before macrophage isolation.4-5 days later, euthanize mice by cervical dislocation (AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition). Carefully make a small incision on the skin to expose the peritoneal wall, avoid cutting the peritoneal wall to prevent leakage of the PBS. Harvest peritoneal cells by injection of 5-10 ml of sterile cold PBS into the peritoneal cavity; give a small massage to shed the peritoneal cells (use 18 gauze needle for the extraction, wash several times with PBS). Collect PBS each time you wash the peritoneum (Lu, 2013). Spin the cells at 300 x g for 5 min, count the cells and resuspend in RPMI or DMEM media containing 10% FCS and 1% Pen-Strep. If red blood cells are present, lyse with ACK buffer. Briefly, add 3-5 ml of ACK lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min. Quench the reaction by adding two times the volume of PBS. Spin for 5 min, 300 x g and repeat wash one more time. Plate cells at 7.5 x 105 cells/well/500 μl of RPMI or DMEM/10% FCS and 1% Pen-Strep in 24-well plates, and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h.Remove non-adherent cells, and wash the attached cells once with RPMI or DMEM media.",
    "Save an aliquot (to detach the cells add 2 mM EDTA in PBS for approximately 10-15 min, collect the cells and spin down for 5 min at 300 x g), resuspend in PBS and evaluate the purity of your macrophage population by staining with CD11b and F4/80 antibodies (1 μg of antibody per million of cells) by flow cytometry, as illustrated in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160810/20160810205657_6717.jpgFigure 1. Analysis of peritoneal macrophagesTumor derived blood MDSC isolationInject 1 x 104-1 x 105 4T1 cells subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c mice (Reuter, 2011). On day 21-28 almost 90% of white blood cells are MDSCs (doubled positive CD11b+Gr1+), as seen in Figure 2. Determine the percentage of Gr1 positive MDSCs by staining with anti Gr-1- APC and CD11b- PE antibodies and analyze by flow cytometry (1 μg of antibody per million of cells).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160810/20160810205937_2912.jpgFigure 2. Analysis of MDSCs in the blood of day 28 of 4T1-tumor bearing miceOn day 21-28 after tumor implantation, collect 100-500 μl blood by cardiac puncture from tumor bearing animals and lyse red blood cells with ACK buffer for 3-5 min at RT (5 ml of ACK for 500 μl of blood). Wash cells twice with PBS by spinning two times at 300 x g for 5 min at RT, count cells and resuspend in complete media.Optional: If MDSCs represent a minor percentage of total white blood cells, purify MDSCs with myeloid-derived suppressor cell isolation kit. Co-culture MDSCs (1.5 x 106 MDSCs/well/500 μl of RPMI or DMEM/10% FCS and 1% Pen-Strep media) with 7.5 x 105 macrophages by mixing them together in the same well (or at with different ratios MDSCs:Macrophages, 2:1, 1:1, etc.) in triplicates, add 100 ng/ml of LPS and incubate for 16-18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "Include wells that contain only macrophages and only MDSCs as controls (as represented in Figure 3) as well as in the presence and absence of LPS, as illustrated in Figure 4.After 16-18 h, collect culture supernatants and measure IL-12 and IL-10 secretion by ELISA (Remove cell debris by spinning 3 min 800 x g). Optional is detection of IFN-γ secretion according to the manufacturer’s protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160810/20160810210230_5451.jpgFigure 3.
