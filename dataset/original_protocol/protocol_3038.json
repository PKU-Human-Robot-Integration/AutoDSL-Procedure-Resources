    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSAM treatment of mammalian cells\nTiming: 1–3 days\nThese steps describe the treatment of mammalian cells with Ac5Neu5Ac3F that halts sialoglycan biosynthesis and the SAMs Ac5SiaNAz and Ac5SiaNPoc that allow introduction of clickable moieties into sialoglycans on surface and secreted glycoproteins and glycolipids.\nSeed HEK293 (3 × 104 cells/cm2), HeLa (2 × 104 cells/cm2), or Jurkat cells (3 × 105 cells/mL) 1 day before the start of the experiment into the desired culture dish format and cell density.\nDilute SAMs to a 10× concentration of the desired final concentration in culture medium.\nNote: For example, prepare 1 mL medium containing 1 mM SAM and add to 9 mL culture medium to yield 100 μM final concentration.\nAdd the SAM to the cells at a 1× final concentration and gently swirl the culture dish to equally distribute the SAM. For maximum effect (sialoglycan inhibition or incorporation) we recommend 100 μM SAM for HEK293, HeLa, and Jurkat cells.\nCritical: Always include a volumetric DMSO control sample treated with equal concentrations of DMSO to ensure that the observed effects are not mediated by this solvent.\nCulture the cells for the desired amount of time and selected application.\nNote: 100 μM was found by us to be effective in most mammalian cell lines and types.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] However, the effective concentration of SAM differs per cell line/type and depending on the application different concentrations are applicable.\nDetection of cell-surface sialoglycans with GBPs\nTiming: 6–8 h\nThese steps describe the detection of cell-surface sialoglycans with GBPs in adherent HeLa cells treated with Ac5Neu5Ac3F.\nPreparation of glass coverslips for culture.\nSterilize culture competent glass coverslips by dipping them into 70% ethanol for 30 s and wash thoroughly with 1× PBS.",
    "Place one coverslip/well into a 12-well plate and add 0.5 mL poly-L-lysine coating solution.\nAlternatives: Poly-L-Lysine is positively charged and enables attachment of net negatively charged cells to the cover slips preventing detachment during the staining procedure. Other reagents might also be suitable for coating.\nIncubate for 5 min at RT, remove the poly-L-lysine coating solution and thoroughly wash three times with 1 mL 1× PBS and aspirate all fluid.\nCritical: Remove all free poly-L-Lysine to avoid its binding to cells, which might interfere with adherence.\nSeed HeLa cells as described (preparation step 10) and add 100 μM of Ac5Neu5Ac3F, or DMSO control (step 2 and 3). Culture treated cells for up to 72 h.\nCritical: When adding the cells, ensure that the coverslip is at the bottom of the well and not floating to have cells growing only on one side.\nFix the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the wells twice with 1 mL 1× PBS.\nNote: Supernatant can be stored for subsequent analysis of secreted glycoconjugates. Supernatant can be centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C to pellet debris and stored at −20°C.\nRemove the 1× PBS and add 0.5 mL fixation buffer and incubate for 10 min at RT.\nNote: Plates containing fixation buffer should not be placed back into the culture incubator, because the PFA might damage live cells in other well/plates due to cross contamination.\nCritical: Do not pipet directly on the cells, but against the side of the well to avoid detaching the cells.\nAlternatives: When using a different method to fix cells on coverslips (methanol, acetone, or PEM buffer fixation), please check compatibility against a PFA control.\nRemove the fixation buffer and discard in hazardous compounds waste.\nWash the wells carefully three times with 1 mL 1× PBS.",
    "Critical: Wash thoroughly to remove all fixation buffer to prevent cross-linking of buffer proteins.\nRemove the 1× PBS and add 1 mL blocking buffer. Incubate the wells for 1 h at 20°C or >3 h at 4°C.\nPause point: Coverslips with fixed cells can be stored in blocking buffer at 4°C for up to 2 months with 0.02% NaN3 added.\nStain the cells with biotinylated MALII.\nWash the coverslip with 1 mL PBS-BSA and add 0.5 mL lectin staining solution containing 5 μg/mL biotinylated MALII.\nIncubate the samples for 1 h at 20°C or for >3 h at 4°C and wash three times with 1 mL PBS-BSA.\nNote: Some lectins require divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+) for binding and therefore should always be added to the lectin staining solution.\nDetect bound MALII with immunofluorescence.\nWash coverslips twice with PBS-BSA and incubate the samples for 30 min with 0.5 mL PBS-BSA containing 1 μg/mL streptavidin, Alexa Fluor™ 488 conjugate protected from light at 20°C.\nNote: Other secondary fluorescent streptavidin probes can be used, and samples can be stained with additional probes (e.g. antibodies) but ensure that these are compatible with the GBP.\nWash the coverslips twice with 1 mL PBS-BSA and once with 1× PBS followed by incubation with 0.5 mL 1 μg/mL DAPI in 1× PBS for 10 min at 20°C in the dark.\nWash the coverslips once with 1 mL 1× PBS and mount them with mounting medium onto a microscopy slide and seal the edges of the coverslip with transparent nail polish.\nAcquire representative images using the EVOS M5000 imaging system or alternative fluorescence microscopes.\n(Sub)cellular localization of alkyne-tagged sialoglycans\nTiming: 6–8 h\nThese steps describe how alkyne-tagged sialoglycans can be detected in the Golgi apparatus using bioorthogonal chemistry.",
    "Seed HeLa cells on poly-L-lysine coverslips in 12-wells (step 5) and culture them for 2 h in the presence of 100 μM Ac5SiaNPoc or DMSO control as described in preparation step 10.\nFix the cells as described in step 7 and permeabilize the cells by adding 0.5 mL permeabilization buffer for 10 min at RT.\nPause point: Coverslips with fixed cells can be stored in blocking buffer at 4°C for up to 2 months with 0.02% NaN3 added. This can only be done before permeabilization of the cells.\nNote: Additional probes to stain extracellular targets can be used after fixation and before adding the permeabilization buffer.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer and add 1 mL intracellular blocking buffer for 60 min at 20°C.\nWash the coverslips three times with 1 mL intracellular washing buffer and incubate with intracellular CuAAC solution for 45 min at 37°C.\nCritical: Thoroughly wash the samples with 1× PBS to remove all free protein from the blocking step, because free proteins can bind the copper and reduce the reaction efficiency.\nAspirate the CuAAC solution and wash the samples three times with 1 mL intracellular washing buffer.\nIncubate the samples with intracellular washing buffer containing 1 μg/mL streptavidin, Alexa Fluor™ 488 conjugate protected from light at 20°C .\nNote: Probes, e.g. antibodies against intracellular targets, can now be used for additional staining.\nWash three times with 1 mL intracellular washing buffer and once with 1× PBS. Perform DAPI staining and mounting as described in steps 9 and 10.\nPause point: Sealed samples can be stored in the dark at 4°C for up to 3 years.\nAcquire representative images using the EVOS M5000 system or alternative fluorescence microscopes.\nFlow cytometry analysis of sialome engineering\nTiming: 4–6 h",
    "These steps describe how the dose-dependent effects of Ac5Neu5Ac3F and Ac5SiaNPoc on the sialome of Jurkat cells can be quantified by flow cytometry using MALII and click chemistry-based detection of sialoglycans, respectively.\nStart with Jurkat cells growing for 3 days in a 96-wells U-bottom plate (ca. 0.2–0.4 × 106 cells/well) in the presence of 0–256 μM of Ac5Neu5Ac3F and Ac5SiaNPoc and equal volumes of DMSO vehicle control.\nWash the cells three times\nCentrifuge the plate in a plate centrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant by ‘flicking’ the plate.\nCritical: Before ‘flicking’ of the plate, make sure that a pellet is visible after centrifugation to avoid loss of cells.\nResuspend the cells in 150 μL PBS-BSA.\nStain membrane sialoglycans with biotinylated MALII lectin.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL PBS-BSA containing 5 μg/mL biotinylated MALII and incubate the samples for 45 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the plate at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant by ‘flicking’ and wash twice with 150 μL PBS-BSA by centrifugation.\nLabel alkyne-tagged surface sialoglycans by click chemistry.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL extracellular CuAAC solution and incubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the plate at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant by ‘flicking’ and wash three times with 150 μL PBS-BSA buffer by centrifugation.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL PBS-BSA containing 1 μg/mL streptavidin-PE conjugate and incubate for 20 min at 4°C protected from light.\nWash the samples three times with 150 μL PBS-BSA by centrifugation.\nAlternatives: Cells can be stained with other probes/dyes (viability, surface marker), provided they do not interfere with MALII binding and are compatible with the selected fluorophores.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL PBS-BSA and keep at 4°C protected from light.\nNote: Immediately before the measurement, resuspend the cells by pipetting or using build-in shaking options form the flow cytometer to ensure that the cells are in solution.\nAcquire the samples using the CytoFlex flow cytometer plate-reader function or a flow cytometer with similar parameters. For data analysis go to the quantification and data analysis step.\nAlternatives: Other flow cytometer systems with similar parameters can be used for analysis.\nDetection of sialoglycoproteins by western blot\nTiming: 1 day\nThese steps describe how alkyne-tagged sialoglycoproteins can be detected in total cell lysates and supernatant derived from HEK293 cells using western blotting.\nStart with HEK293 cells growing in a 6-well plate (ca. 1 × 106 cells/wells) for 3 days in the presence of 100 μM Ac5SiaNAz or equal concentrations of DMSO (step 3).\nTake off the supernatant\nCollect the supernatants into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nTo remove cells, centrifuge the supernatant tubes at 300 × g for 5 min and transfer supernatant into clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nAlternatives: Different concentrations of SAM and different time points can be chosen. Keep in mind that a certain incorporation time, min. 8–16 hours, is required to accumulate detectable amounts of alkyne label in surface and secreted sialoglycoproteins.\nLyse the cells.\nGently wash the adherent cells twice with 1 mL 1× PBS (RT) and aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL ice-cold cell lysis buffer per well and detach the cells by repeated vigorous pipetting (hold plate at a 45° angle) or scraping with the pipette tip or cell scraper.\nCheck that all cells are detached with a light microscope at 4× or 10× magnification.",
    "Hold the plate at a 45° angle and transfer the samples into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and incubate them on ice for 1 h and vortex for 10 s after 30 min.\nVortex the sample tubes and centrifuge in a microcentrifuge at high speed (>10.000 × g) for at least 10 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant containing soluble sialoglycoproteins to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: A small white pellet consisting of the insoluble components (e.g. membranes, DNA) should be visible in the tube. This can be used for subsequent analysis of insoluble molecules, by resuspending it in 2% SDS.\nPause point: Collected supernatants and cell lysates can be stored at −20°C for several years.\nDetermine the protein concentration in the cell lysates using a BCA Protein Assay Kit following the manufacturers instruction.\nLoad 30–50 μg of cell lysate per sample on a protein gel and run the gel 30 min at 60 V to run the samples out the slots and 60 min at 130 V in SD-PAGE running buffer to separate proteins by size. Transfer the proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane for at least 60 min at 275 mA/100 V using ice cold 1× transfer buffer.\nOptional: Directly after transfer, stain the nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau S solution to detect the blotted lysates and confirm equal loading of protein. Rinse the blot in dH2O once and submerge the blot in Ponceau S solution in a fume hood. Incubate the blot for at least 5 min at 20°C gently shaking (30–50 rpm), after which the Ponceau S solution can be removed. Rinse the blot in dH2O till background of blot appears clear and acquire the image of the membrane.\nPause point: membranes can be dried and stored for at least 3 years at 20°C.",
    "Place the membrane into a clean incubation tray with the protein side facing upwards and add 30 mL membrane blocking buffer and incubate shaking for 1 h at 20°C or >4 h at 4°C.\nDiscard the blocking buffer and wash the membrane three times for 5 min with 30 mL 1× PBS and once with 30 mL demi water shaking at 20°C.\nCritical: Thoroughly wash the membrane to remove all free protein from the blocking step, because free proteins can bind the copper and reduce the reaction efficiency.\nIncubate the membrane in 30 mL membrane CuAAC solution for 45 min at 37°C shaking.\nDiscard the click reaction buffer and wash the membrane four times for 5 min with 20 mL PBS-BSA shaking at RT.\nTransfer the membrane into a 50 mL tube and add 4 mL PBS-BSA containing 1 μg/mL Streptavidin, Alexa Fluor™ 647 conjugate and incubate on a tube roller for 1 h at 20°C or >4 h at 4°C protected from light.\nAlternatives: Membranes can be stained with other probes and antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated to compatible fluorophores to co-localize for example the sialoglycan and a specific protein signal.\nWash the membrane four times for 5 min with 20 mL PBS-T at 20°C and image the membrane with a fluorescent membrane imaging system.\nOn-cell synthesis of high affinity Siglec ligands\nTiming: 4–6 h\nIncorporative SAMs with azide or alkyne tags allow further chemical modification with click chemistry once incorporated into sialoglycans. These steps describe a method to chemically modify sialic acids at the cell surface of living cells, rendering them into high-affinity Siglec ligand expressing cells (HASLECs).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCulture suspension Jurkat cells for 72 h with 100 μM Ac5SiaNPoc or DMSO control.\nDistribute the cells into a 96-well V-bottom plate with 0.1–0.2 × 106 cells/well.",
    "Centrifuge the plate in a plate centrifuge for 3 min, 500 × g, at 4°C and discard the supernatant by flicking the plate. Wash twice by resuspension in 150 μL 1× PBS by centrifugation and flicking.\nCritical: Thoroughly wash the cells to remove all medium proteins, because free proteins can bind the copper and reduce the reaction efficiency.\nRemove the 1× PBS from the last wash step and resuspend the cells in 100 μL on-cell Siglec ligand synthesis buffer. Incubate the plate for 20 min at 37°C.\nNote: Add the reaction buffer also to DMSO-treated cells to determine the background.\nCentrifuge the plate with 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant by flicking of the plate. Wash twice with 1× PBS-BSA by centrifugation and removing the supernatant by flicking.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL Siglec-3 staining buffer and incubate for 1 h at 4°C protected from light.\nNote: Incubate one or more wells with PBS-BSA without recombinant Siglec-3/CD33 Fc chimera as negative control.\nCentrifuge the plate with 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant by flicking of the plate. Wash twice with 150 μL PBS-BSA by centrifugation and removing the supernatant by flicking.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL PBS-BSA and pipet up and down to create single cell suspensions.\nAlternatives: Cells can be stained with other probes/dyes (viability, surface marker), provided they do not interfere with Siglec binding and are compatible with the selected fluorophores.\nNote: Immediately before and during the measurement, resuspend the cells by pipetting or using build-in shaking options to ensure that the cells are in solution.",
    "Acquire the samples using the CytoFlex flow cytometer plate-reader function or a flow cytometer with similar parameters. For data analysis go to the quantification and data analysis step.\nAlternatives: As an alternative to CuAAC, strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) can be used for the bioorthogonal chemistry. This reaction is spontaneous and does not require copper and is more suitable for live-cell modifications. However, the copper-catalyzed azide and alkyne L39 conjugation forms a triazole that maybe required for high-affinity Siglec-3 binding."
