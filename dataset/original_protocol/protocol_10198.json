    "1. Preparation of through-hole array aluminum plate and magnet array\nPrepare two 50 mm x 50 mm (or larger) aluminum plates. The thickness of each plate was 300 µm that is half of the bead diameter.\nForm a 30 x 30 through-hole array on one of the aluminum plates by using a CNC rotary engraver with a Φ550-µm micro drill bit with 30 mm/s of plunge rate and 8000 RPM of spindle speed. The distance between each hole (center to center) was 1 mm (Figure 1a and Figure 2a, i).\nForm a 30 x 30 array of Φ750-µm through-holes on the other aluminum plate, using the same procedure as that described in 1.2 (Figure 1a and Figure 2a, ii).\nAttach the two plates each other by using a sticky tape and form Φ3 mm alignment holes at each of the four corners of both aluminum plates.\nSoak the aluminum plates in 15% sulfuric acid for 12 h to clean their surfaces. Since the thin layer of aluminum oxide on the surface of the aluminum make it corrosion resistant, the hole diameter and thickness of the plate are not changed by this acid treatment.\nForm a 30 × 30 array of 1 x 1 x 1 mm neodymium magnets (with a magnetic strength of 0.363 N). Ensure that each magnet is the opposite polarity to its neighbor. To prevent the breaking or scattering of the magnet array, attach a 30 x 30 mm aluminum plate to the bottom of the magnet array using double-sided tape (Figure 2a, iii and inset in Figure 2).\n2. Bead trapping process\nAlign and stack the two aluminum plates (top plate: 750-µm-hole plate, bottom plate: 550-µm-hole plate) using the prepared alignment holes at the four corners of each plate (Figure 1b).",
    "Lock the two plates together by inserting M3 bolts into the alignment holes, and then secure the bolts with nuts (Figure 1b).\nStack the aluminum plate assembly on the prepared magnet array (Figure 1b, 2b, and 2c). Align the array of magnets and the array of through holes in the aluminum plate during the stacking process. Then use a sticky tape to fix the position of the magnet array.\nPlace a sufficient number of Φ600 mm SUJ2 steel beads on the plate assembly and manipulate the beads using an acryl (or non-metallic) plate such that a bead becomes trapped in each hole (Figure 1c, 1d, and 1e) while simultaneously removing the excess beads which have not lodged in the holes.\nCarefully remove the top plate to avoid unwanted scattering and dislocation of the trapped beads (Figure 1f).\n3. Concave microwell fabrication\nMove the concave microwell mold, produced in steps 2.1 to 2.5, above, to a Petri dish.\nMix polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) monomer and curing agent according to the manufacturer's instructions19 with a PDMS monomer:curing agent ratio of 10:1.\nDe-gas the PDMS mixture by using a desiccator and vacuum pump to remove any bubbles trapped in the PDMS mixture.\nPour the PDMS mixture into the concave microwell mold and de-gas again using the same procedure as that described in 3.3 (Figure 1f).\nBake the PDMS mixture on a hotplate at 80 °C for 2 h to form a bead-embedded PDMS substrate (Figure 1g).\nRemove the cured PDMS substrate from the mold (Figure 1g). In the removing process, spray methanol using washing bottle to detach PDMS substrate from the mold.",
    "Using a Φ15 mm x 2 mm magnet, remove the trapped steel beads from the PDMS substrate (Figure 1h). For this process, any magnet that is sufficiently strong to extract the beads from the PDMS substrate can be used.\n4. Spheroid culture\nCut the concave microwell-patterned PDMS substrate by using a Φ14 mm biopsy punch to be fitted in 24-well plate in this study.\nSterilize the resulting Φ14 mm PDMS substrate in an autoclave sterilizer at 121 °C and 15 psi.\nPlace the sterilized PDMS substrate into a 24 well plate.\nCoat the entire PDMS substrate with 4% (w/v) pluronic F-127 solution overnight to prevent cell attachment to the microwell surface. During the coating process, remove any air bubbles entrapped in the concave microwells by pipetting or by using an ultrasonic cleaner.\nFlush the F-127 solution three times by using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nSeed 1 mL of cell-medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) solution (which contains 2 x 106 cells) on the PDMS substrate. Note that the seeding density can be changed according to the target spheroid size and/or target cell type. Here, adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) were used.\nAspirate the 1 mL of medium using a 1000 µL pipette to remove any excess cells that were not trapped in the microwells (Figure 3).\nIncubate the cells at 36.5 °C, humidity of >95%, and 5% CO2 condition. In the case of the ASCs used in our study, the cells aggregate to a spheroid in 48 h.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
