    "This protocol was approved by and adheres to the animal care and ethics guidelines of the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.\n1. Animal Preparation and Anesthesia \nWear gloves while handling mice.\nAnesthetize mice with inhaled isoflurane and place in the prone position. Induce anesthesia using 3-5% isoflurane and 1 L per minute O2 flow rate. Following induction of anesthesia, maintain anesthesia at 2-3% and 1 L per minute O2 flow rate.\n\t\nAdjust O2 flow and isoflurane percentage for adequate anesthesia according to animal’s disease state, age, and respiration rate. Smaller or weaker animals may require less isoflurane for adequate anesthesia (i.e.1.5- 2.5% isoflurane).\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by applying light hindlimb footpad pressure with an object such as forceps to demonstrate a lack of withdrawal response. \nMaintain temperature at 37 °C surface temperature with a thermostatic warming plate as variation in temperature can affect CMAP size and duration.\nApply veterinarian petroleum-based ointment to eyes to prevent dryness. Monitor level of anesthesia observing respiration rate and assessing for withdrawal responses following pressure applied to the foot pad via forceps.\nRemove hair from the hindlimb to be studied using clippers. After removal of hair from the hindlimb(s) to be studied, lightly extend the hindlimbs at the knee, abduct at the hips and affix to the working surface using adhesive tape (as shown in Figure 1).\nFollowing the CMAP and MUNE recordings and discontinuation of anesthesia, do not leave animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return animal to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\n2. Recording Setup and Equipment\nPlace the electrodes for the CMAP and MUNE recordings as pictured in Figure 1.\nUse two fine ring electrodes for the recording electrodes.",
    "Place the active (E1) ring electrode on the skin overlying the proximal portion of the gastrocnemius muscle of the hind limb, at the knee joint, and the reference (E2) ring electrode on the skin over mid-metatarsal portion of the foot.\nIn order to reduce impedance, coat the skin underlying the ring electrodes with gel to sufficiently saturate residual hair and maximize electrode-skin contact. Avoid excessive application of electrode gel as this may cause an electrical bridge between electrodes and could prevent accurate recording.\nFor stimulation of the sciatic nerve at the proximal hind limb, use two insulated 28 G monopolar needles as the cathode and anode. Insert the cathode at the region of the proximal hind limb and insert the anode more proximally in the subcutaneous tissue overlying the sacrum.\n\t\nAvoid inserting the stimulating electrodes overly close to the sciatic nerve or too deep that it would directly injury the sciatic nerve or other structure. Figure 1 illustrates electrode placement.\nFor the ground electrode, place a disposable surface electrode on the contralateral hind limb or tail.\n3. Data Acquisition\nSciatic CMAP\n\t\nObtain sciatic CMAP responses by stimulating the sciatic nerve with square-wave pulses of 0.1 ms duration and intensity ranging from 1-10 mA.\nAcquire CMAP responses with increasing stimulus intensity until the amplitude of the response no longer increases. Then, in order to ensure supramaximal stimulation, increase the stimulation to ~120% of the stimulus intensity utilized to obtain a maximal response and obtain an additional response. If there is no further increase in the CMAP size, record this response as the maximal CMAP.\nRecord baseline-to-peak and peak-to-peak CMAP amplitudes in mV (Figure 2).\nAverage Single Motor Unit Potential (SMUP) Size and MUNE Calculation",
    "Determine the average single motor unit potential (SMUP) size with an incremental stimulation technique1. To obtain incremental responses, deliver submaximal stimulation of 0.1 ms duration at a frequency of 1 Hz while increasing the intensity in 0.03 mA steps to obtain the minimal all-or-none responses. Obtain the initial response with stimulus intensity between 0.21 mA and 0.70 mA.\n\t\t\nIf the initial response does not occur with stimulus intensity between 0.21 mA and 0.70 mA, adjust the stimulating cathode position either closer or farther away from the position of the sciatic nerve in the proximal thigh to decrease or increase the required stimulus intensity, respectively.\nIf the initial incremental response is obtained with a stimulus intensity between 0.21 mA and 0.70 mA and fulfills the criteria noted below (3.2.2), store and record additional increments with increasing stimulus intensities adjusting by steps of 0.03 mA to obtain a total of 9 additional increments that meet the established criteria.\nDuring measurements of the incremental responses, ensure that each increment meets the following criteria.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the initial negative peak of the incremental responses is aligned temporally within the negative peak of the maximal CMAP response shown as the shaded portion of the CMAP illustration in Figure 2.\nEnsure that each incremental response is stable and without fractionation, established by observing three duplicate responses. Distinguish visually incremental responses in real-time (superimposed on the previously recorded increments).\n\t\t\tNote: Each increment should be visually distinct and larger compared with the preceding response (Figure 3). Analysis in real-time allows recognition of larger amplitude (incremental) responses compared to prior responses, and small changes attributable to background noise can be disregarded. A superimposed view of 10 increments is shown in Figure 4 (B and D) to further illustrate this point.",
    "After visually confirming each increment, ensure that the measured amplitude difference (confirmed response-amplitude of the prior response=amplitude difference) is at least 25 µV.\nIf the increment is less than 25 µV, discard and re-measure the response. After recording 10 incremental responses, assess the increments to ensure that the amplitude of each individual incremental response is not greater than 1/3 of the sum of all ten increments (i.e. the total amplitude of the final response). If this condition is not met, re-measure the incremental responses. \nAverage the 10 incremental values to give an estimation of the average single motor unit potential (SMUP) amplitude (Figure 3). Note: Figure 3 details the basis of the average SMUP calculation, but the average SMUP amplitude can be simply calculated by dividing the entire amplitude of the final incremental response by the total number of increments (i.e., 10).\n\t\tExample individual SMUP calculations (illustrated in Figure 3):\n\t\tSMUP 1=peak-to-peak amplitude of increment 1\n\t\tSMUP 1=0.050 mV\n\t\tSMUP 2= (peak-to-peak amplitude of increment 2) – (peak-to-peak amplitude of increment 1)\n\t\tSMUP 2=0.150 mV-0.050 mV=0.100 mV\n\t\t\nCalculate each subsequent increment (up to a total of 10), and make an average of the ten increments.\nCalculate MUNE by dividing the maximum CMAP amplitude (peak-to-peak) by the average SMUP amplitude (peak-to-peak). (MUNE=CMAP/average SMUP). In some electrophysiological systems, the SMUP increments are measured in μV whereas CMAP is typically provided in mV. When necessary, convert CMAP and SMUP results to similar units prior to MUNE calculation."
