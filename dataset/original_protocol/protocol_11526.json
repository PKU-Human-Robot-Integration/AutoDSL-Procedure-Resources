    "1. Fluorescent Labeling of Cells\nNOTE: Label glioblastoma cell lines and microglia with fluorescent dyes 9. Alternatively, generate cell lines that constitutively express fluorescent proteins such as GFP/RFP as described in 14.\nPlate cells on a 6 well plate such that they will be 70 - 80% confluent on day of staining. For the murine glioblastoma cell line GL261 and human glioblastoma cell line U87, plate 1 x 106 and 1.5 x 106 cells, respectively on a 6 cm dish 24 hr before staining.\nPrepare fluorescent cell stain dye solution in DMSO and add 5 µM dye to media, either Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) or Macrophage Serum Free Medium (MSFM), vortex well.\nIncubate cells with dye for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove dye containing media and add fresh media (RPMI or MSFM) to the cells.\nIncubate cells for 30 min. Note: Cells are now stained and ready to be used in experiment.\n2. Pre-coated Matrix Chamber Coculture Invasion Assay\nDifferentiate THP-1 cells using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)15.\n\t\nPlate 2 - 3 x 105 THP-1 cells in 1.5 ml of RPMI/10% FBS in a 6 well culture plate. Immediately after plating add 100 nM PMA and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 hr.\n\t\tNOTE: After 48 hr, THP-1 cells that have successfully undergone differentiation will be adherent and spread to the bottom of the well taking on a round morphology.\nRemove PMA by washing once with 1x PBS and replace with fresh RPMI/10% FBS. Wait another 48 hr until cells are ready to use in assay.",
    "Equilibrate matrix pre-coated chambers by placing them in a well containing 500 µl of media alone (no serum) and adding 500 µl of media alone to the top. Incubate chambers for 2 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Pre-coated chambers were purchased from the manufacturer; see Table of Materials/Equipment.\nTo gently detach cells (fluorescently labeled glioblastoma cell lines and the microglia/macrophages), remove media from cells by aspiration. Wash cells on dish with 2 mM EDTA/PBS. Add 500 µl of 2 mM EDTA/PBS and incubate for 5 - 10 min in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nResuspend cells in 5 ml of media containing 0.3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA).\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 120 x g.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in MSFM/0.3% BSA media (for GL261 cells and microglia) or RPMI/0.3% BSA (for U87 and THP-1 cells) such that the concentration of cells is equal to 1 x 106 cells/ml. Use a hemocytometer to count the cells.\nAdd 500 µl media/0.3% BSA per well of 24 well plate.\nRemove media from chambers that have been equilibrated for at least 2 hr (step 2.2). Place chambers in well containing 500 µl media/0.3% BSA (step 2.7).\nIf inhibitors are being used to study their effect on macrophage/microglia stimulated glioma invasion, add the appropriate concentration to both the bottom and top portions of the chamber.\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of CSF-1R inhibitor used to fully inhibit microglia stimulated GL261 glioblastoma invasion can be found in reference 9.\nDepending on the cell lines used, add cells to the top chamber as described in the next two steps: mouse glioblastoma (2.10.1) and human glioblastoma (2.10.2).",
    "Mix 1.5 x 105 GL261 (glioblastoma) cells (150 µl) and 5 x 104 mouse microglia (50 µl) (see step 2.6 for media details). Bring volume to 500 µl by adding 300 µl MSFM/0.3% BSA. Add cell mixture to the top chamber and incubate at 37 °C , 5% CO2 for 48 hr.\n\t\t​NOTE: Murine microglia are isolated from neonatal mice as described in 16.\nMix 7.5 x 104 U87 (glioblastoma) cells (75 µl) and 2.5 x 104 THP1 (macrophage) cells (25 µl). Bring volume in 500 µl by adding 400 µl RPMI/0.3% BSA. Add the cell mixture to the top chamber. Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\nAfter incubation, remove cells from top of chamber by gentle aspiration and fix chambers by placing in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Allow chambers to remain in fixative for 15 min at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C). Remove fixative by gentle aspiration and replace with 500 µl 1x PBS. Proceed to section 4 for image analysis.\n\t​NOTE: Experiment can be paused at this moment and saved for imaging in 1x PBS. Fluorescent dye signals can be detected for up to 2 weeks after fixation.\n3. Invasion Assay \"3D\"-embedding Glioma and Macrophages/Microglia in Matrix\nThaw matrix mix at 4 °C overnight. Perform all further manipulations using matrix on ice in the hood.\nPrepare 10 mg/ml concentration of matrix in media (MSFM or RPMI) with 0.3% BSA on ice.\n\tNOTE: Stock concentration of matrix is typically around 15 mg/ml.\nTo prepare cells (labelled in step 1) for suspension in matrix, remove media from cells by aspiration. Wash cells on dish with 2 mM EDTA/PBS. Add 500 µl of 2 mM EDTA/PBS to cells and incubate for 5 - 10 min in incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "Resuspend cells in 5 ml of media containing 0.3% BSA.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 120 x g.\nAspirate supernatant from pellet. Resuspend pellet in media/0.3% BSA such that the concentration of cells is equal to 1 x 106 cells/ml. Use a hemocytometer to count the cells.\nAdd 1.5 x 105 GL261 cells (in 150 µl) + 5 x 104 microglia cells (in 50 µl) into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Add 2 x 105 GL261 cells (200 µl) into a separate 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\n\tNOTE: GL261 cells alone without microglia serves as a control.\nSpin cells in microfuge for 5 min at 120 x g.\nResuspend cells in 200 µl cold matrix on ice.\nPlate 50 µl (50,000 cells) onto the center of the top compartment of 8 µM pore size chamber insert.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min for polymerization to occur.\nAdd 200 µl serum-free medium to the upper chamber and 700 µl serum containing cell growth medium to the lower well.\nIncubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 hr.\nAfter incubation, remove cells from top of chamber by gentle aspiration and fix chambers by placing in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Allow chambers to remain in fixative for 15 min at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C). Remove fixative by gentle aspiration and replace with 500 µl 1x PBS. Proceed to section 4 for image analysis.\n4. Imaging Assays\nRemove chambers from 3.7% formaldehyde and wash in well containing fresh 500 µl 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Do not allow chambers to dry.",
    "Using a cotton tipped applicator, gently clean the non-invasive cells from the top portion of the filter (side facing the inside of the chamber) by scraping the filter surface. Start gently and increase pressure gradually. Do this at least 3 times per chamber.\nPlace chambers in either a glass-bottomed dish or leave in a 24 well plate.\nPlace sample on the stage of an epifluorescent or laser confocal fluorescent microscope equipped with camera and image capture software 9,10.\nTake several 10X or 20X images of representative fields.\nUsing an image analysis software, such as ImageJ, count the number of glioblastoma cells that have crossed the filter to the underside 9,10.\nIf imaging the \"3D\" invasion assay (described in section 3), generate a Z stack series using a fluorescent laser confocal microscope 5-6. To image the invasive cell population on the underside of the filter, follow the protocol steps 4.2 -  4.6 described above.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
