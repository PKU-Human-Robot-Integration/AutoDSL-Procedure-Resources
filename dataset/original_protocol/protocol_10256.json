    "1. Pilot Plant Start-up\nNitrogen production system\nTurn on the air dryer, the air compressor, and the nitrogen generator. Verify that there is at least 800 kPa of air in the air compressor tank. This keeps sending nitrogen to the buffer tank until there is no more than 0.004% (40 ppm) oxygen in the nitrogen.\nTurn on the nitrogen gas booster. The gas booster starts to fill the nitrogen supply tanks, at pressures as high as 17 MPa.\nHydrogen production system\nTurn on the chiller, the water deionization unit, and the electrolyzer. The electrolyzer will not operate without a venting system, because there is a flow sensor that measures the negative pressure venting in order to let the electrolyzer start. The hydrogen is produced with a rate of 0.54 kg/h, and the discharge pressure will be about 1.5 MPa.\nTurn on the hydrogen gas booster. Verify that the chiller is operational and the cooling liquid is flowing through. The hydrogen supply tanks will be filled up to 17 MPa.\nAmmonia skid start-up\nUse the computer in the control room to do the following:\n\t\t\nVerify the emergency exits for the building.\nMake sure that the oxygen, hydrogen, and ammonia concentrations in the building are less than 20%, 19 ppm, and 35 ppm, respectively.\nVerify that the hydrogen and nitrogen supply tanks are charged to 17 MPa.\nMake sure that the ammonia sampler and the weight tank valves are bypassed.",
    "Pressurize the skid with nitrogen by setting the skid's nitrogen inlet regulator to 2.5 MPa. Set the nitrogen pressure regulator to 300 psi and then open the nitrogen bypass valve to fill the skid with nitrogen to 300 psi. Then close the nitrogen valve when that pressure is reached. Set the hydrogen regular to 1,200 psi and open the hydrogen valve to allow the skid to fill to 1,200 psi. Then close the hydrogen bypass valve.\nOpen the hydrogen inlet valve and set the skid's hydrogen inlet regulator to 10 MPa.\nSet the NH3 pressure regulator to 1 MPa.\nUse the GUI controlling software to close/open multiple bypass valves on the skid, the compressor, and the air valves.\nUse the GUI controlling software to turn a couple of the PID controllers to ensure that the skid is fed with a 1:3 ratio of N2:H2.\nFrom the control room, and using the master GUI controlling software, start the skid. The compressor starts to recirculate the gas in the skid, and inject the fresh feed.\nIn the GUI controlling software, set the reaction and condensation temperature. The reactor and condenser temperatures are set at 440 °C and -25 °C, respectively.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It takes up to 4 days for the reactor to get to the set point temperature and achieve a steady state condition.\n2. Experimental Apparatus Start-up\nReactor preparation and reduction\nWeigh 3 g of the pre-reduced catalyst. Reduce the particle size of the catalyst particles to less than 1 mm using a mortar and pestle.\nLoad the catalyst into 0.25 in tubing, and place quartz wool on both sides.",
    "Use a PID controller, and increase the reactor temperature to the reaction temperature (400 °C) with appropriate ramps, while flowing hydrogen through the reactor with a flow rate of 500 standard cubic centimeters per minute (SCCM). Use the ramps (summarized in Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: The temperature increase should be very smooth in order to obtain the proper catalyst activity.\nContinue the reduction process for 24 h. Ensure that no air or impurity comes into contact with the catalyst. Always keep the reactor under a nitrogen blanket.\nAbsorber preparation\nLoad 80 g of the CaCl2 absorbent into the absorber column (ID: 2.3 cm, Length: 30 cm). According to different absorbent sizes, different absorber packing supports will be used on both sides of the absorber, in order to immobilize the packed bed.\nTo remove any humidity, increase the absorber temperature to 350 °C while flowing nitrogen with the flow rate of 200 SCCM for 24 h.\nStarting reaction separation tests\nIncrease the reactor and absorber temperature to 400 °C and 180 °C, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: Use proper temperature ramps to increase the reactor temperature. Use transformers to make the temperature control smoother. Keep the system in idle mode under the nitrogen blanket. Before starting any test, charge the system with nitrogen to 5 MPa a few times, and then release the pressure.\nUse the GUI to control the hydrogen and nitrogen mass flow controllers.\nCharge the apparatus to the target pressures with nitrogen and hydrogen, with the ratio of 1:3.\nOnce the target pressure is achieved, close the inlet valves, open the reactor outlet valve, and turn on the recirculating pump. Due to the exothermic reaction and absorption, the reactor and absorber temperatures might require more careful control at the beginning of the process.",
    "Continue the test for 5 h, until the point when the absorber starts to breakthrough.\nDesorption of ammonia\nOpen the inlet and outlet valves.\nReduce the system's pressure to atmospheric pressure and increase the temperature of the absorber while flowing nitrogen with a flow rate of 100 SCCM for 5 h to desorb ammonia from the absorbent material.\nSubscription Required.
