    "All animal protocols described herein were carried out according to European Community Council Directives (86/609/EEC) and comply with the guidelines published in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Solutions and reagents\nPrepare standard medium: DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX 1x; 8 mmol/L HEPES; 100 U/100 μg Penicillin/Streptomycin (1% P/S); 1x B27; 1x N-2.\nPrepare neurosphere medium: add 10 ng/mL bFGF; 10 ng/mL EGF to standard medium.\nPrepare oligosphere/OPC medium: add 10 ng/mL bFGF; 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA to standard medium.\nPrepare oligodendroctye differentiation medium: add 50 nM T3; 10 ng/mL CNTF; 1x N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to standard medium.\nPrepare non-enzymatic dissociation buffer: add 1% P/S to non-enzymatic dissociation buffer and keep ice cold.\nPrepare sucrose solution: HBSS, 0.3 g/mL sucrose.\nPrepare BSA washing solution: EBSS, 40 mg/mL BSA, 0.02 mL/l HEPES.\nPrepare enzymatic dissociation buffer: HBSS, 5.4 mg/mL D-glucose, 15 mmol/L HEPES, 1.33 mg/mL Trypsin, 0.7 mg/mL Hyaluronidase, 80 U/mL DNase.\nPrepare cytokine mix: TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ (20 ng/mL each).\nPrepare cytokine mix vehicle: 0.04% of the stock (10% glycerol/100 nM glycine/25 nM Tris, pH 7.3).\nPrepare oxygen-glucose deprivation medium: standard medium using DMEM w/o glucose. Depending on the stringency of the desired glucose deprivation condition, it is possible to remove also B27 and/or N2 from the medium to avoid glucose-related compounds (e.g., D-Galactose in B27).\n2. Dissection and NSC isolation\nNOTE: Fetal and adult NSCs were isolated from E13.5 fetal forebrain or 2.5-month-old adult sub-ventricular zone (SVZ), following the Ahlenius and Kokaia protocol9 with modifications.\nFetal NSC cultures\n\tNOTE: Before starting the dissections, prepare 1.5 mL tubes containing 150 µL of non-enzymatic dissociation buffer each; clean Petri dishes and add ice cold HBSS.\n\t\nCollect the embryos at E13.5 - 14.5 from timed pregnant mice and place in a Petri dish containing cold HBSS.",
    "Decapitate the embryos using forceps.\nPlace the heads of the embryos in a clean Petri dish containing ice cold PBS and remove the skin from the skull with forceps, using magnifying glasses or a stereoscope.\nOnce the brain is visible and cleared of skin, squeeze it out by applying pressure at the sides with forceps.\nRemove the cerebellum, keep only the forebrain and remove the meninges with forceps.\nPlace the isolated tissue in the non-enzymatic dissociation buffer and repeat the dissection steps with the other embryos. Insert the tissue from 2–3 animals into each tube containing the buffer.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 15 min under continuous shaking.\nAfter incubation, add 850 µL of standard medium and mix by pipetting until the suspension is free of clumps.\nIf non-dissociated tissue is still visible, wait for 2 min at RT until it deposits at the bottom of the tube.\nWhen dissociation is complete, count the cells and plate them in suspension at a density of 10–50 cells/µL in a T-25 or T-45 flask containing 10–30 mL of neurosphere medium, kept in a vertical position to avoid cell adhesion.\nAdult NSC cultures\nSacrifice animals by cervical dislocation.\nCollect brains from 4–5 mice in a 50 mL tube containing ice cold HBSS.\nPlace the brain on a cold sterile surface. For this purpose, use a T-25 flask filled with water and placed at -20 °C overnight. At the time of the experiment, cover the flask with sterile aluminum foil.\nPlace the brain ventral side downwards, in rostro-caudal direction, and remove the olfactory bulbs using a razor blade.\nUsing a razor blade, cut 2–3 coronal slices of 1 mm thickness, from the cortex to the optical chiasma.",
    "Place the slices on the cold surface in a ventro-dorsal position and identify the corpus callosum and the two lateral ventricles.\nUsing magnifying glasses or a stereoscope, isolate the walls of the lateral ventricles, taking care not to carry pieces of the corpus callosum.\nPut the isolated tissue in the enzymatic dissociation buffer (5–10 mL) and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nMix the solution, pipetting several times (at least 50), and incubate again at 37 °C for 10 min.\nNeutralize the trypsin by adding 5 mL of standard culture medium and filter the solution using a 70 µm filter.\nCentrifuge the filtered solution for 5 min at 400 x g.\nResuspend the pellet in the sucrose solution and centrifuge for 10 min at 500 x g.\nResuspend the pellet in BSA washing solution and centrifuge for 7 min at 400 x g.\nResuspend the pellet in the standard culture medium, count the cells, and perform plating as described above (in step 2.1.10).\n3. Primary neurospheres\nAdd the growth factors (bFGF/EGF) every 2 days.\nEvery 4–6 days (depending on cell density), change half of the medium as follows:\n\t\nTransfer the entire cell suspension to a 15 or 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g.\nRemove half of the volume.\nAdd the same amount of fresh medium, gently mix by pipetting, and add growth factors.\n4. Oligospheres\nNOTE: Oligodendrocyte differentiation is performed following the Chen protocol10 with modifications.\nWhen the neurospheres reach a diameter of 100–150 µm, they are ready to be passed. To do so, transfer the entire cell suspension to a 15 or 50 mL tube, and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g.",
    "Rapidly evaluate the diameter by taking pictures of the spheres using an inverted transmitted light microscope and opening them by ImageJ software.\nClick on the Analyze menu and from the Tools window, select Scale bar.\nSet 150 µm as Width in microns and compare the scale bar with the spheres.\nRemove the entire volume by inversion and resuspend the pellet in 180 µL of fresh standard culture medium. Pipette 50 times to allow disaggregation of the spheres.\nAdd 810 µL of fresh standard culture medium, count the cells, and re-plate them as described for the neurospheres.\nAdd bFGF/PDGF-AA 10 ng/mL every 2 days.\nEvery 4–6 days (depending on cell density), change half of the medium as follows:\nTransfer the entire cell suspension to a 15 or 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g.\nRemove half of the volume.\nAdd the same amount of fresh medium, gently mix by pipetting, and add growth factors.\n5. Plate coating\nPoly-D,L-ornithine/laminin coating: at least 2 days before plating the OPCs, add 50 µg/mL poly-D,L-ornithine solution, diluted in PBS, to each well (40 µL/well for 96-well plates) and incubate at RT overnight.\nThe following day, remove the liquid and wash three times with distilled sterile water.\nLet the plates dry at RT overnight. The following day, add a laminin solution diluted in PBS (5 µg/mL; 40 µL/well for 96-well plates) and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.\n6. Cell seeding\nWhen the oligospheres reach a diameter of 100–150 µm, they are ready to be dissociated and seeded on the poly-D,L-ornithine/laminine coated plates. To do so, transfer the entire cell suspension to a 15 or 50 mL tube, and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g (as indicated in step 4.1)",
    "Remove the entire volume by inversion and resuspend the pellet in 180 µL of fresh standard culture medium. Pipette 50 times to allow disaggregation of the spheres.\nAdd 810 µL of fresh standard culture medium and count the cells.\nRemove the laminin solution from the wells and plate the cells at 3,000 cell/cm2 density (100 µL/well for 96-well plates).\n7. OPC differentiation induction\nAfter 3 days, remove the entire medium and add the same volume of oligodendrocyte differentiation medium.\nChange half of the medium every 4 days and add fresh differentiation mix (T3/CNTF/NAC) every 2 days.\n8. Induction of inflammation-mediated differentiation block\nAfter neurosphere dissociation and oligosphere production (section 4), add the cytokine mix to the culture medium and keep oligospheres exposed to cytokines for the whole spheres formation step.\n\tNOTE: The volume depends on the number of cells, since for the spheres forming cells are seeded at 10–50 cells/µL.\nIf the medium needs to be changed, change the entire volume and add the cytokine mix once more.\n9. Induction of oxygen-glucose deprivation cell death\nAt -1 DIV (2 days after cell seeding in multiwell plates), remove the medium and conserve it in a new multiwell plate.\nAdd half the volume (50 µL for 96-well plates) of OGD-medium (OGD group) or fresh medium (control group). The half amount of volume is used to reduce the exchange of oxygen between the liquid and the air.\nPlace the OGD group cultures in an airtight hypoxia chamber saturated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2. To achieve saturation of the chamber, let the gas mixture flow for 6 min at 25 l/min before closing the chamber pipes.",
    "Incubate the hypoxic chamber in the incubator for 3 h. The control group and plates containing the medium removed and conserved at step 9.1 should also be left in the incubator.\nRemove the glucose-free (OGD group) or the new medium (control group) and add the medium removed and conserved at step 9.1.\n10. Immunocytochemistry\nAt the desired time point, fix the cells with cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT.\nWash twice with PBS (10 min of incubation for each wash at RT).\nIncubate 1 h at RT with the blocking solution (PBS Triton 0.3% containing 1% BSA and 1% donkey/goat normal serum).\nIncubate with primary antibody mix (Table 1), diluted in PBS triton 0.3%, overnight at 4 °C.\nWash twice with PBS (10 min of incubation for each wash at RT).\nIncubate with secondary antibody (Table 1) solution diluted in PBS triton 0.3% adding Hoechst 33258 for 30 min at 37 °C.\nWash twice with PBS (10 min of incubation for each wash at RT).\n11. HCS analysis of cell viability, lineage composition, and lineage-specific cell death\nNOTE: The HCS representative images and workflow are shown in Figure 2A,B.\nSelect the Compartmental Analysis algorithm from the main menu of the software (HCS Studio v 6.6.0) and select Scan from the main menu Develop Assay/Scan Plate.\nIn the iDev window, select New and then select General intensity Measurement Tool from the Develop Assay template.\nClick on Create on the right side of the menu, selecting the 10x objective.",
    "This will open the Configure Acquisition menu. In this window, select the following parameters: (a) number of channels: the first one for the Hoechst nuclear staining (BGRFR_386) and one for each lineage-specific marker used in the reaction (b) select software focus on channel 1 and autofocus interval as 1 (c) select the plate model from the list.\nFrom the acquisition menu, look at the quality of the staining in different wells and different fields and manually select the exposure time by selecting Fixed Exposure Time in the menu.\nOnce the acquisitions parameters are set, select Mini Scan on the top of the menu and select ten fields per well in two wells per experimental condition. This will allow the set-up of all the analysis parameter in a subset of fields for the entire plate.\nWhen the mini scan is finished, click on the Configure Assay Parameter to configure the algorithm of the analysis.\nClick on Configure Groups in the right side of the window and drag-and-drop the wells of the miniscan. Click on the Add button in the Groups sub-section to configure the different groups.\nFollow the workflow on the left side of the window step by step to develop the whole algorithm. First select Process Image for each channel and click on Background Removal and on the desired level.\nFirst identify and select the nuclei by nuclear staining. Click on Identify Primary Object – Channel 1 to select the real nuclei and avoid analyzing artifact and debris. For this purpose, zoom in a representative picture of nuclear staining and check whether the nuclei are well surrounded by the perimeter built by the software. It is possible to change the thresholding value and to apply segmentation algorithms to better identify single nuclei.",
    "Once the nuclei are defined correctly, click on the following step: Validate Primary Object. Select Object.BorderObject.Ch1 to avoid the analysis of nuclei at the border of each field image. Select Object.Area.Ch1 and, by moving the “low” and “high” bars on the histograms, remove all the identified debris or big-objects corresponding to aggregates or artifacts.\nCheck all the mini scan representative images of all the experimental conditions to be sure that the selected parameters fit with all of them.\nClick on Identify Spots for each channel corresponding to the specific lineage markers, and select the Ring values: Width = 3 and Distance = 0. This will allow the identification of the cytoplasmatic fluorescence. According to the cell density, these values can be adapted. The software will automatically avoid the overlapping between adjacent rings.\nSelect Reference Levels in the workflow to build the analysis. The setting of the reference levels will allow the automatic counting of condensed nuclei, based on the nuclear size and nuclear staining intensity, and of specific marker-positive cells, based on the cytoplasmatic fluorescence identified by the Ring.\nFirst click on Object.Area.Ch1. In the mini scan images, select a condensed nucleus and move the “LOW” bar on the histograms in order to select as “condensed” all the nuclei under this size.\nClick on Object.AvgIntensity.Ch1. In the mini scan images, select a condensed nucleus and move the “HIGH” bar on the histograms in order to select as “condensed” all the nuclei above this fluorescence intensity.\nClick on Object.RingAvgIntensity for each channel of lineage specific markers. Select in your mini scan images a positive cell and move the “HIGH” bar on the histograms in order to select as “positive” all the cells above this fluorescence intensity.",
    "Check all the mini scan representative images of all the experimental conditions to be sure that the selected parameters fit with all of them.\nOn the top menu, select Population Characterization and select Event Subpopulation.\nAs Type 1 Event, select ObjectAreaCh1 on the left list, then click on the AND > button and finally select ObjectAvgIntensityCh1. This will allow the identification of condensed nuclei, as a combination of low area and high intensity.\nIn the same window, deselect all the Scan Limits.\nClick on Select Features to Store in the top menu, to choose the parameters to keep in the analysis.\nSelect Well Features and move from the left list to the right only the desired parameters: (a) SelectedObjectCountPErValidField (b) %EventType1ObjectCount (c) %High_RingAvgIntensity (For each channel of the specific lineage markers).\n\tNOTE: This analysis will give as readout the total number of cells, the percentage of condensed nuclei, and the percentage of lineage-specific positive cells for each analyzed marker on the total cell number. If the percentage of the different lineages is needed only on live cells, is it possible either to keep the value “High_RingAvgIntensity” for the channel (absolute number of positive cells) and recalculate the percentage on total cell numbers after the subtraction of the percentage of dead cells.\n\t\nAlternatively, it is possible to remove the dead cells from the analysis setting the same parameters used to identify condensed nuclei (steps 11.14–11.15) on the nuclei validation (step 11.11).\nSelect Scan Plate from the main top menu and click on the plate symbol on Scan Setting sub-menu on the top section to identify the well to analyze.\nWrite the name of the experiment and the description and once all the settings are completed, press the play symbol.\nSubscription Required.
