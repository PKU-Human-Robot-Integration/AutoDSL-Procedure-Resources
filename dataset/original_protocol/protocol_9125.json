    "1. Culture and Expansion of mESCs\nNOTE: Mouse embryonic stem cells are easy to culture and can be quickly expanded to the large numbers required by biochemical experiments thanks to their fast cycling time. Healthy mESCs double every 12 h.\nExpand mESCs to the desired number on gelatinized plates in mESC medium (see below) in a tissue culture incubator kept at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and >95% humidity.\n\tNOTE: Enough plates should be prepared for 3 - 5 biological replicates for the +4SU sample and the -4SU control. One 10-cm plate (i.e. 5 - 10 million cells) is more than sufficient for each biological replicate.\nThe medium for mESCs is composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5x penicillin/streptomycin, 1x non-essential amino acids, 100 µM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1,000 U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 3 µM CHIR99021, 1 µM PD0325901.\nBefore passaging mESCs, prepare the desired number of 10 cm plates.\nAdd 4 mL of 0.1% gelatin in water making sure that the entire surface of the plate is covered; incubate for 10 min at room temperature (RT); remove gelatin solution.\nPassage cells when they reach ~10 million cells per plate, typically ~48 h following inoculation.\n\tNOTE: As mESCs grow in dense colonies, plates should never be allowed to reach 100% confluency as observed for cell lines that grow in monolayers (e.g. HEK293 or 3T3 cells). An mESC plate should be passaged when ~50% confluent and definitely before the medium turns yellow.\n\t\nTo detach cells, wash plates with dense mESC cultures once in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, then add 0.05% trypsin dissolved in DMEM and return plate to incubator for 5 min (37 °C, 5% CO2, and >95% humidity).",
    "Remove plate from incubator and resuspend cells with equal volume of DMEM by pipetting up and down vigorously several times.\nCount cells using hemocytometer and ensure that cells form a single-cell suspension (i.e. no clusters), then centrifuge cell mixture 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 - 2 mL DMEM.\nInoculate cells at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in mESC medium (i.e. ~800,000 cells per 10-cm plate) using the gelatin-coated plates prepared in step 1.3.1.\n2. Crosslink of Protein–RNA Interactions in Live Cells\nNOTE: RNA-protein crosslinking is mediated by the photo-activatable ribonucleoside analog 4-thiouridine (4SU). 4SU has a longer absorbance maximum than endogenous nucleotides and can only be incorporated into RNA; therefore intermediate-wavelength UVB can be used to selectively crosslink RNA to proteins25,26. UVB treatment of 4SU-treated cells leads to covalent crosslinks between 4SU-containing RNA and amino acids, with a reported preference for Tyr, Trp, Met, Lys, and Cys27.\nExpand mESCs to the required number of 10-cm plates as described in step 1.\n\tNOTE: Enough plates should be prepared for 3 - 5 biological replicates for the +4SU sample and the -4SU control. One 10-cm plate (i.e. 5 - 10 million cells) is sufficient for each biological replicate.\nBefore the plates reach confluency, add 4SU directly into medium to a final concentration of 500 µM. Leave -4SU control dishes untreated.\nShake plates gently to distribute the 4SU homogeneously throughout the medium. Return them to the same tissue culture incubator for 2 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, and >95% humidity).\nTransfer plates to an ice bucket and discard medium.\nRinse the plate gently with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS.\n\tNOTE: Rinse gently or cells might detach.",
    "Add 2 mL of ice-cold PBS and place plates without lids in a crosslinker equipped with UVB-emitting bulbs (312 nm). Irradiate plates at an energy setting of 1 J/cm2.\n\tNOTE: It is critical that plastic lids are removed or they might shield the cells from UV light and prevent crosslinking.\nCollect cells using cell lifters and transfer to ice-cold PBS in conical tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 min, 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 5 mL ice-cold PBS with 2 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).\nCount cells using a hemocytometer. Expect 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 million cells from 10-cm and 15-cm plates respectively.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 min, 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Pelleted cells can be immediately used for step 3 or they can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C indefinitely. This is a potential stopping point.\n3. Isolation of Nuclei\nNOTE: Nuclei are isolated to remove cytoplasmic proteins and increase coverage of nuclear proteins. This step can be replaced with other forms of cellular fractionation to study RBPs in different cellular compartments.\nPrepare ice cold Buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 4 °C, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl). Use at least 2.5 mL per 10 million cells (as counted in step 2.9) for extraction.\n\tNOTE: Stocks of Buffer A (e.g. a 500 mL bottle) can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C for 6 months.\n\t\nPrior to use, add 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.2 mM PMSF to the desired amount (2.5 mL per 10 million cells) of ice-cold buffer A.\nWash cells using 2 mL Buffer A per 10 million cells. Spin at 2,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Discard supernatant, add Buffer A supplemented with 0.2% of a nonionic, non-denaturing detergent, such as octyl-phenoxy-polyethoxy-ethanol (see the Table of Materials), 500 µL per 10 million cells. Rotate for 5 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge at 2,500 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant; the pellet comprises intact nuclei devoid of cytoplasm.\n\tNOTE: Nuclei can be used immediately for step 4 or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C indefinitely. This is a potential stopping point.\n4. Lysis of Nuclei\nNOTE: Crosslinked nuclei are lysed in a mass spectrometry-compatible buffer to release proteins and protein-RNA complexes.\nAdd lysis buffer (9 M urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 24 °C), 200 µL per 10 million cells. Sonicate to shear chromatin using a 1/8\" probe at 50% amplitude setting for 5 - 10 s.\nSpin at 12,000 x g for 5 min and collect 175 µL of supernatant to avoid the pellet.\n\tNOTE: 100 µL will be used for the next RBR-ID steps and the remaining 75 µL of lysate can be stored at -80 °C for later use and/or western blot analysis.\nMeasure protein concentration via Bradford assay or similar technique28. Dilute protein concentration in the different samples to 1 mg/mL or the lowest sample concentration using appropriate amounts of lysis buffer.\n\tNOTE: From the nuclei of 10 million mESCs expect 100 - 200 µg of protein.\n5. Trypsin Digestion\nNOTE: Proteins are digested to generate peptides suitable for bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.\nAdd DTT solution to nuclear lysate (5 mM final); incubate for 1 h at RT.\nAdd iodoacetamide from fresh stock (14 mM final); incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark.\nDilute lysate with 5 times volume of 50 mM NH4HCO3",
    "Add trypsin (µg protein : µg trypsin = 200 : 1); incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n6. Desalting of peptides\nPrepare one custom-made stage tip per sample.\n6.1.1. Place a disk of solid phase extraction C18 material into the bottom of a 200 µL pipette tip.\nAdd 50 µL of oligo R3 reversed phase resin on top of the C18 disk. Place stage tip inside centrifugation adaptor and the place tip with adaptor inside a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nAdd 100 µL 100% acetonitrile to tips to wash. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 1 min to remove the solvent.\nEquilibrate with 50 µL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 1 min.\nAdd 100% formic acid to digested protein sample to decrease the pH to 2 - 3.\n\tNOTE: This should require ~5 µL per 1 mL of diluted peptide sample, but pH should be measured and more formic acid added if necessary.\nLoad sample onto custom-made stage tip, centrifuge at 1000 x g for 1 min until all of sample goes through the tip.\nWash bound peptides with 50 µL 0.1% TFA. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 1 min.\nElute peptides by adding 50 µL elution buffer (75% acetonitrile, 0.025% TFA) to stage tip and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 1 min to force the elution buffer out of the tip.\nDry the sample using a vacuum centrifuge set at 150 x g and 1 - 3 kPa for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Dried peptides can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely. This is a potential stopping point.\n7. Removal of Crosslinked RNA\nNOTE: Treat peptides with nuclease to remove crosslinked RNA.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 µL 2x nuclease buffer (100 mM NH4HCO3, 4 mM MgCl2).",
    "Measure peptide concentration using absorbance at 280 nm assuming 1 mg/mL of peptides for an A280 of 1.\n\tNOTE: The expected concentration is 1 mg/mL.\nAdjust all samples to 1 mg/mL or to the lowest concentration using 2x nuclease buffer.\nPrepare a master mix of 50 µL H2O + 1 µL high purity nuclease (≥250 U) (refer to the Table of Materials) per sample.\nTake 50 µL of peptide sample and add 50 µL of H2O + nuclease master mix.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Proceed to perform mass spectrometry.\n\tNOTE: The peptides are now ready for mass spectrometry. They can be analyzed immediately or stored at -80 °C indefinitely. This is a potential stopping point.\n8. Nano Liquid Chromatography, Mass Spectrometry, and Raw Data Processing\nNOTE: Because 4SU-crosslinking changes the mass of the peptide, their ions do not count toward the intensity of the non-crosslinked peptide during LC-MS/MS, which therefore appears to be decreased by the crosslinking. The degree and consistency of this decrease reflects the degree of protein-RNA crosslinking for each peptide24.\nPrepare HPLC buffers as follows: 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water (buffer A); 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade acetonitrile (Buffer B).\nIf a nano-HPLC is available, connect a nano-column with the following specifications: internal diameter 75 µm; packed with C18-AQ particles; length 20 - 25 cm.\n\tNOTE: If the HPLC available runs at higher flow rates use a proper column size for the indicated flow rate. Higher flow chromatography decreases sensitivity.\nProgram the HPLC method as follows: flow rate 250 - 300 nL/min; gradient from 2 to 28% buffer B in 120 min, from 28 to 80% B for the next 5 min and isocratic 80% B for 10 min.",
    "NOTE: If the HPLC does not have an automated column equilibration prior sample loading, start the program with 10 min at 0% B before loading the sample.\nProgram the MS acquisition method to perform data-dependent acquisition (DDA) as standard shotgun proteomics experiments. The instrument duty cycle should alternate full MS scans with tandem MS scans (or MS/MS) of the most intense signals. Use the optimal settings for proteomics MS runs.\n\tNOTE: For confident results, use instruments that can perform at least the full MS scan in high resolution mode (e.g. orbitrap, time-of-flight). For accurate quantification, make sure that intervals between full MS scans are no longer than 3 s. Longer duty cycles might prevent accurate definition of extracted ion chromatograms.\nLoad 1 - 2 µg of sample onto the HPLC column and run the HPLC-MS/MS method as programmed. For each biological replicate perform at least two independent runs and treat them as technical replicates.\nAfter MS, import the raw files into a proteomics software package for MS/MS spectra identification and peptide quantification via extracted ion chromatography. We recommend software packages that can perform chromatographic alignment of multiple MS runs (see the Table of Materials)29,30.\nIf the option is available in the software suite, enable \"Match Between Runs\" prior to starting data processing.\nOnce the analysis is finished, export the peptide list together with the quantification values.\nSubscription Required.
