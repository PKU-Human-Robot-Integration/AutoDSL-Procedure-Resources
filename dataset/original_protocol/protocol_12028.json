    "NOTE: Sample blocks should be polymerized and contain some heavy metal. Fixation and embedding protocols for the two samples shown in Figure 1A-B have been described elsewhere11. In short, the sample shown in Figure 1A was chemically fixed, stained en bloc first with 1% OsO4, then with 1% uranyl acetate, and embedded in Spurr's resin. The sample shown in Figure 1B was high pressure frozen, freeze substituted with 0.4% uranyl acetate in acetone, and embedded in Lowicryl HM20 resin. Use powder free gloves for the next preparation steps.\n1. Creating Arrays\nTrimming of the sample block\n\tNOTE: Always tighten screws well when inserting parts.\n\t\nInsert the sample block into the sample holder of the ultramicrotome, place the holder into the trimming block, and slide it into the lower stage of the ultramicrotome.\nTrim away resin around the embedded tissue with a razor blade leaving only a small rim of resin around the sample. Trim from the top until the target is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: The shape of the block-face may be trapezoid or rectangular (we have successfully used both shapes). It is important to use the longer sides of the rectangle as the leading and trailing edge to ensure that a large area is covered by the glue mixture stabilizing the ribbons.\nInsert the sample holder into the arm of the ultramicrotome and replace the trimming block in the lower stage by the knife holder. Insert a diamond trim knife (normally 45°), into the knife holder. Align the block-face exactly parallel to the trim knife edge.\n\t\tNOTE: To produce exactly parallel leading (bottom) and trailing (top) edges, turn or move only the knife to trim opposite sides. For large volumes (more than several hundred sections), a 90° trim knife is advantageous.",
    "Smooth all four sides, then rotate the sample holder so that the leading and trailing edge are now in the horizontal position.\nCarefully coat the leading and trailing sides of the block with adhesive mixture. Use a tiny brush formed from a few hairs fixed to a toothpick13. Perform this step quickly because the solvent of this mixture evaporates within seconds. Do not contaminate the block-face with this mixture. Let the coated sample block dry for 5-10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: For larger numbers of sections (>200), it may be better to coat the leading edge only, because with time, a bulge of glue might build up at the trailing edge, and potentially pull back sections over the knife-edge.\nPreparation of the substrate\nCut pieces of silicon wafers to a size that fits into the knife boat (roughly 2 x 2.5 cm2 for the Jumbo knife). If needed, mark the wafer pieces (numbers or letters) with a diamond scriber before cleaning, or with permanent marker after cleaning. Clean the silicon wafer manually with isopropanol and lint-free tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: For correlative imaging use indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass coverslips. They must be handled very carefully, and extra cleaning is not necessary.\nFix the substrate to one end of the carrier plate using a removable adhesive.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the substrate edges may be pinned down parallel to the knife-edge using two stripes of adhesive tape.\nPlasma activate (glow discharge) the substrate with air to obtain a hydrophilic surface. This should be done in such a way that a drop of water placed onto the substrate spreads to a very thin film (low contact angle, Figure 2C, D). Hydrophilization parameters depend on the plasma device used; for the parameters used here, see Table of Materials.",
    "NOTE: Plasma activation is very volatile, so perform this immediately before substrate usage.\nInsert the carrier into the clamp of a substrate holder, with the mounted substrate closer to the knife-edge to achieve optimal wetting of the substrate in the knife boat.\n\t\tNOTE: A detailed description of the substrate holder, including the computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, is given in Wacker et al.11\nSectioning Preparation\nInsert a Jumbo diamond knife into the knife holder, set the clearance angle (0° for Jumbo knife), and fill the knife boat with distilled water. Approach the knife to a distance of 1–2 mm to the sample.\nLower the substrate into the water using screws 1–3 (Figure 2A) of the substrate holder. Check that the waterline is located in the upper third of the substrate.\n\t\tNOTE: Check that the glue between the substrate and carrier plate is well cured by nudging the substrate with clean forceps. It should not move.\nBecause it is hard to see the ground clearance when using a silicon wafer, lower the substrate until you feel it touch the floor. Now raise the substrate a small amount. Make sure that neither the substrate nor the carrier touches the knife boat while cutting.\nUse a syringe or pipette to adjust the water level in the boat. While watching through the binocular, add or remove water until the full area of the water surface shows a homogenous reflection of the top light illumination of the ultramicrotome.\nSwitch on the bottom light of the ultramicrotome. Ensure that the arm is in the middle position and not in retraction using the hand wheel of the ultramicrotome. Approach the knife to the sample until the reflection of the knife-edge is visible on the block face.",
    "Use the adjustment options of the ultramicrotome to align the sample to the knife. First rotate the knife, then rotate and tilt the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: It is properly aligned if the light stripe, which can be seen in the gap between the sample and the knife, shows parallel edges (straight parallel lines and not wedge shaped).\nCheck the inclination of the sample: Make sure that the light stripe does not become thicker or thinner while moving the sample up and down. If needed, use the arc adjustment screw to correct this. Move the knife closer to the sample until it is just above the block-face (but does not touch it).\nSet section thickness (feed), cutting speed, and cutting window at the control unit.\nStart sectioning. If necessary, wait until the first full section is being cut. Cut some sections to be sure that they stick together to form ribbons (otherwise the glue has to be applied again). Start with a high feed value (maximum, 200 nm for the Ultra knife) until the first full section is being cut. Then, set the desired feed value. For adequate ribbon stability, a section thickness of 100 nm and a cutting speed of 1 mm/s is a good starting point. The lowest achievable section thickness is around 60 nm, depending on sample quality.\nStop sectioning. Remove all unneeded (partially cut) sections from the knife-edge and boat using an eyelash/cat's hair. If there is a lot of small debris floating around, remove the water completely with a pipette and fill the boat with fresh water. Now the process is ready for the first productive ribbon.\nSectioning",
    "Start sectioning. Once a number of sections (the actual number depends on the size of sections and substrate) has been cut, stop the sectioning process and release the ribbon from the knife-edge by gently stroking over the knife-edge with an eyelash14 or better yet, with a very soft hair from a cat's fur.\nManipulate (push/pull) the ribbon with the eyelash towards the substrate and attach the first section to the substrate.\n\t\tNOTE: It is necessary to gently push the ribbon until it sticks to the dry part of the substrate.\nContinue sectioning and attaching the ribbons to the substrate. Start on one side and move gradually over to the other with each new ribbon.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid massive water movements to avoid loosening the already attached ribbons. The same is true for air currents. Use the breath shield delivered with the ultramicrotome. In unfavorable environmental conditions, an enclosure for the ultramicrotome is recommended15.\nWhen the substrate is completely covered with ribbons (usually 4–5 ribbons are feasible), gently lift-out the substrate from the knife boat using the micromanipulator screws of the substrate holder.\n\t\tNOTE: Suitable movements are: lift up vertically (screw 1) and rotating/tilting out (screw 3), or a combination of both.\nLet the ribbon array dry before storing it in a dust-free environment. After drying, remove the adhesive mounted substrate as soon as possible from the carrier (on the same day, otherwise the substrate might be too hard to remove or may even break during demounting).\n2. Staining for the LM Imaging\nNOTE: Different staining/labeling methods are possible, including immunofluorescence protocols. Here a direct, rather unspecific stain is chosen to outline the cell walls.\nPropidium iodide staining",
    "Cover the bottom of a large glass Petri dish (30 cm diameter) with parafilm and line the edge of the dish with wet tissue to build a humid chamber.\nUse approximately 300-500 µL of solution per coverslip. Place one drop for each coverslip on the parafilm and put the glass upside down onto the drop, so that the sections are in contact with the staining fluid. Cover the dish and wrap it with aluminum foil to protect the samples from light. Incubate the samples for 16 h at 4 °C.\nRemove the coverslip with forceps and wash it by moving it up and down in a 100-mL beaker filled with 80 mL of distilled water. Repeat this step in another beaker with fresh water. Dry the coverslip carefully with compressed air.\n3. Recording the Image Stack in the FLM\nPlace the coverslip on the stage of a common wide-field FLM.\nChoose the appropriate filter set (Table of Materials) for the fluorescence to be observed.\nWith a suitable objective lens, take an image of the object in each section: try to fill the field of view and keep the orientation constant. For the root tip, a 40X air objective was used.\n\tNOTE: If the ribbons are not perfectly straight, a rotating stage can help to reorient the sections while taking images. If possible, center the image on a specific feature or keep a feature such as the edge of the section at an equal distance to the edge of the recorded image.\nIf possible, use 16 bit to limit saturated pixels and keep the exposure time constant.\n4. Registration of the FLM Image Stack\nImport the image series into Fiji16 as a virtual stack.\nOpen a new TrakEM17 (blank) from the file menu.",
    "Right click into the image field, and import the stack into TrakEM as \"One slice per layer\".\nAlign layers (right click into image field), set the range (first image to last), and choose none as the reference. For all settings, use the default values, and choose rigid as the desired transformation.\nWhen the registration is finished and satisfactory, save the aligned dataset by right click and choose export. Make flat image, set the range from first to last image, and let the software show the resulting stack. Save the stack in tif-format.\n5. Staining and Mounting for the SEM Imaging\nNOTE: For preparing staining solutions see Table of Materials. Solutions may be stored at 4 °C for up to 12 months, protected from light and air.\nCaution: Lead citrate and uranyl acetate contain heavy metals which are toxic. Wear gloves and dispose the waste according to the local authorities' instructions.\nCover the bottom of a large glass Petri dish (30 cm diameter) with parafilm and line the edge of the dish with wet tissue to build a humid chamber.\n\tNOTE: It is important that several pellets of NaOH are positioned within the Petri dish near the staining drops to prevent excessive precipitation of lead citrate.\nUranyl acetate staining\nCentrifuge the uranyl acetate solution at 2,680 x g for a few seconds to sediment small particles.\nUse approximately 300–500 µL of solution per coverslip. Place one drop for each coverslip on the parafilm and put the glass upside down onto the drop, so that the sections are in contact with the staining fluid.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature, and cover the dish during staining.\nRemove the coverslip with forceps and wash by moving it up and down in a beaker filled with distilled water (see step 2.1.3).",
    "Lead citrate staining\nDuring the uranyl acetate incubation, prepare the lead citrate solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Lead citrate should always be filtered immediately before use to remove any precipitates. Also centrifuge the lead citrate solution at 2,680 x g for a few seconds as in step 5.2.1.\nUse approximately 300–500 µL of solution per coverslip. Place one drop for each coverslip on the parafilm immediately before washing the coverslips after the uranyl acetate staining, and put the glass upside down onto the drop, so that the sections are in contact with the staining fluid. Place the drops (300–500 µL) on the parafilm immediately before washing the coverslips after the uranyl acetate staining.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid formation of precipitates, do not breathe onto the lead citrate droplets.\nPlace the washed coverslip upside down onto the drop (there is no need to dry it).\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature, and cover the dish during the staining.\nRemove the coverslip with forceps and wash it as described above in a beaker with fresh water (step 5.2.4).\nDry the coverslip carefully with compressed air.\nMounting samples for the SEM imaging\nMount the silicon wafers on aluminum stubs with a sticky carbon pad.\n\t\tNOTE: ITO-coated coverslips may either be mounted using silver paint and Cu-tape — make sure the conductive surface is connected to the stub — or with carbon pads as above. In that case, a conductive connection from the ITO-surface to the stub can be made with a drop of silver paint.\n6. Hierarchical Imaging in the SEM",
    "NOTE: In a field emission SEM, choose a low primary energy (3 kV or lower), a beam current in a range from 50 to 800 pA to avoid charging, and a suitable working distance for efficient collection of secondary and/or back-scattered electrons. Selection of the beam current depends on the sample properties (e.g., embedding resin); the electron dose will also be a compromise between a small current (less harmful to the sample) and a high current, which is beneficial for imaging speed and therefore lowers the total image acquisition time. Dedicated detectors for back-scattered electrons provide good contrast, are less sensitive to charging of the sample, and show less of the sample's surface artifacts (folds, knife marks). Contrast and brightness should be adjusted such that the histogram is centered.\nSEM imaging\nFirst define the four corners of the array by grabbing an image of each corner at low magnification, about 100x. Create a region of interest (ROI) enclosing the whole array. Assign an imaging protocol with the following parameters: Use a secondary electron (SE) detector, which allows for high speed imaging at a large image pixel size (for example 1,000 nm), and a short dwell time (e.g., 0.2 µs).\n\t\tNOTE: To overcome electron optical limitations at a large scanning fields of view (FOV), which might result in distortions at the periphery of the images, use dedicated low magnification modes (provided by most SEM manufacturers) or use medium, 1 to 2 k scan fields for single images.\nGenerate a section set by creating a ROI outlining just the tissue in the first section. Clone it to all subsequent sections using the stamp tool. Rotate the ROIs when needed to accommodate bent ribbons.",
    "Record the image series using an intermediate pixel size (around 50 nm) and a dwell time long enough to identify and recognize the target structure. Use a FOV for single images in a range of 6-10 k pixels.\n\t\tNOTE: The Atlas 5 software can automatically collect mosaics composed of adjacent images to cover large ROI/section areas across the serial sections.\nCreate a site set within this section set, containing the target structure for higher resolution SEM imaging. Make the ROI large enough to account for stage precision. Check and adjust the positions of the sites.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to place the ROIs in such a way that the center, where the autofocus and autostigmation will be performed, does not sit on \"empty\" material with no structural detail, e.g., vacuoles.\nDefine the autofocus settings and check the performance over at least the length of a ribbon (i.e., the longest distance that the stage has to travel) on a small ROI close to the site that will be imaged.\nDefine an imaging protocol for the high-resolution SEM acquisition. To see membrane compartments, choose 3–5 nm image pixel size. Select a dwell time depending on the detector so that the image is not too noisy.\nBefore starting the acquisition, define the focus values on at least the first section of each ribbon using the check protocol option.\nStart the automated SEM imaging over the whole series of target ROIs.\nExport the acquired data as image series, preferably in tif-format.\n7. Registration of the SEM Image Stack\nImport image series into Fiji as a virtual stack.\n\tNOTE: These will be large data files in the range of a few GB depending on the number of sections and the size of the ROI.",
    "Crop the SEM image stack for further processing to an area as close to the structure of interest as possible, and adjust the brightness and contrast.\nOpen a new TrakEM17 (blank) from the file menu.\nRight click into the image field, and import the stack into TrakEM as \"One slice per layer\".\nAlign the layers (right click into the image field), choose least squares as mode, set the range (first image to last), and choose none as the reference. For the settings, use the default values and choose rigid as the desired transformation.\nWhen the registration is completed and satisfactory, save the aligned dataset by right click and choose export. Make a flat image, set the range from first to last image, and let the software show the resulting stack. Save the stack in tif-format."
