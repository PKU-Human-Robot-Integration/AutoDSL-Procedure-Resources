    "All procedures described were approved by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The neonatal piglet was acquired from a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-approved farm located in Pennsylvania, USA.\n1. Stereo-imaging system setup\nAttach a stereo-imaging camera system that captures up to 100 frames/s (FPS) to a utility stand. The stereo-imaging camera system used in this study is a passive stereo camera with two horizontally aligned cameras (referred to as the left and right cameras) separated by a baseline of 63 mm (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65924/65924fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Stereo-imaging camera system.

Stereo-imaging system DLT Calibration-digitizing the 3D control volume\nObtain three clear acrylic plexiglass square sheets (12 in x 12 in x 0.125 in). On each sheet, place a grid and draw at least 10 points, resulting in a minimum of 30 points distributed across the 3D control volume in the x, y, and z coordinate planes. Construct the 3D control volume by stacking the three sheets at varying heights to capture the maximum height of what will be recorded (Figure 2A).\nDigitize all the points on the 3D control volume using a digitizer with a foot pedal. Acquire x, y, and z coordinates (in mm) (Figure 2B) by establishing the origin (0, 0, 0) on the 3D control cube, defining the positive x- and y-directions, opening a document to save the digitized (x, y, z) coordinates (in mm) of each point, and saving (x, y, z) coordinates (in mm) as a *.csv file.",
    "NOTE: The (x, y, z) coordinates are relative to the set origin on the 3D control cube.\nUse these digitized (x, y, z) coordinates (in mm) to calibrate the stereo-imaging camera system's left and right cameras, respectively.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65924/65924fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Three-dimensional control volume and digitizer with foot pedal.

Data analysis-marker trajectory tracking\nRun the custom MATLAB code (Supplemental File 6) to separate the output video file (Supplemental File 7) into two video files, left and right camera video files (Supplemental File 8 and Supplemental File 9, respectively).\nClick Run to initialize the DLTdv7.m22 GUI (Supplemental File 10).",
    "The DLTdv7 controls window pops up and the new project, load project, and quit buttons are enabled (Figure 6A).\nClick new project on the DLTdv7 controls window to begin a new project.\nWhen a dialog box pops up, select 2 to indicate two video files (i.e., left and right camera views) to track the displacement marker trajectories on a stretched peripheral nerve (Figure 6B).\nSelect the first video file (i.e., Video 1), which is the video file from the left camera view (Supplemental File 8), and click open (Figure 6C). Then, select the second video file (i.e., Video 2), which is the video file from the right camera view (Supplemental File 9), and click open (Figure 6C).\nAfter the two video files are selected, click yes to signify the video files were acquired from camera views calibrated via DLT.\nSelect the corresponding DLT coefficients *.csv file (Supplemental File 5) for the stereo-imaging camera system and click on open (Figure 6D).\nThe initial video frames are displayed from both video files and the rest of the DLTdv7 controls window is activated. The new project button is replaced with the recompute 3D points button and the load project button is replaced with the save button (Figure 6E).\nOn the DLTdv7 controls window, ensure the frame number is on 1, the current point is set to 1, autotrack mode is off, and update all videos, DLT visual feedback, and show 2D tracks are checked (Figure 6E).\nEnsure that the tracking points are placed on the displacement markers of the PN such that the insertion marker corresponds to point 1, marker 1 corresponds to point 2, and so on with the clamp marker being the final point.",
    "Place point 1 on the insertion marker on Video 1 (i.e., left camera view video file) ensuring the placed point is at the center of the insertion marker. Use keyboard shortcuts (Table 1) to move the placed point to the center of the insertion marker (Figure 7A).\nBecause DLT visual feedback is checked, when a point is placed in Video 1, a blue epipolar line appears in Video 2 (i.e., right camera view video file) (Figure 7). Place point 1 on the insertion marker in Video 2 using the blue epipolar line as reference. Use the keyboard shortcuts (Table 1), as needed, to move the placed point to the center of the insertion marker (Figure 7A).\nClick add a point on the DLTdv7 controls window to add points on the other tissue markers to track their trajectories. Refer to the current point on the DLTdv7 controls window to know which point is active.\nClick add a point. Place point 2 on marker 1 in Video 1. Use the blue epipolar line and keyboard shortcuts to place point 2 on marker 1 in Video 2. Continue adding and placing points, first on Video 1 and then on Video 2, for all displacement markers along the length of the nerve between the insertion and clamp (i.e., final point) (Figure 7B-F).\nOnce all initial points are placed in Video 1 and Video 2 (i.e., the left and right camera video files, respectively), ensure the frame number is on 1 and the current point is set to 1 on the DLTdv7 controls window.\nOn the DLTdv7 controls window, change autotrack mode to auto-advance from the dropdown menu and autotrack predictor to extended Kalman from the dropdown menu (Figure 8A).",
    "Complete the tracking of all the placed points in Video 1 first and then complete tracking in Video 2. Track the marker trajectory by left-clicking on the center of the marker frame by frame until failure (i.e., frame before gross rupture of the peripheral nerve) or the entirety of the video for predetermined stretch is achieved.\nBegin tracking point 1 in Video 1. Zoom in and out (Table 1) as desired to ensure tracking is at the center of the marker; click frame by frame until the failure or end of the video (Figure 8B). After completing the tracking of point 1 in Video 1, return to frame 1 and change the current point to point 2 from the dropdown menu on the DLTdv7 controls window. The previous tracked point will turn light blue and its trajectory will turn yellow. The current point will have a green diamond and a pink center.\nComplete the tracking of all the points in Video 1 by left-clicking frame by frame for each point until failure or end of the video (Figure 8C-G).\nIn Video 2, use the blue epipolar line to track points in reference to Video 1 (Figure 9). On the DLTdv7 controls window, return frame number to 1 and set current point to 1, and begin tracking point 1's trajectory in Video 2.\nFollow the same steps (5.2.16-5.2.18) to track the remaining points in Video 2.\nAfter tracking is complete in Video 1 and Video 2, click export points on the DLTdv7 controls window to export the (x, y, z) coordinates (in mm) of the tracked points.\nA dialog box pops up to select the directory where to save the output files. Click on the directory location.",
    "Another dialog box pops up to set the name of the output files. Set the output files' name (i.e., nerve1_101-Jan-2001videoanalyzed_cal09.30_trial1_).\nAnother dialogue box pops up. Select the save format as flat.\nAnother dialog box pops up. Select no to calculate the 95% confidence interval.\nA final dialog box pops up that shows the data is exported and saved, and the four output files are exported to the selected directory location (Supplemental File 11, Supplemental File 12, Supplemental File 13, and Supplemental File 14).\nClick save project on the DLTdv7 controls window to save the current project (Supplemental File 15) in the same directory as the output files.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65924/65924fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: Schematic to set up a new project to begin three-dimensional trajectory tracking.
