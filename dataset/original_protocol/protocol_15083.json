    "Prior to using this model, investigators must have received approval for the surgical protocol from their institution's animal use governing body. The model is approved by the Research Ethics Board, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, McMaster University (AUP # 10-04-24) and is carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n1. Mouse Preparation\nWeigh the mouse. Induce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane or 2% halothane. The circuit used should ensure adequate scavenging of the anesthetic to protect the surgeon.  After 2-3 min the animal's respiration will slow. Ensure the blink reflex is absent and pinch the  interdigital spaces in the paw to confirm surgical anesthesia (i.e. no response by the mouse). Apply ophthalmic lubricant to the eye, to prevent drying of the cornea during surgery.\nShave the lateral thigh and buttock from the sciatic notch to the knee and disinfect with proviodine. Shaving will keep the site of the incision hair free to ensure adequate visualization of the surgical field and to minimize interference with nerve dissection and transection. The sciatic notch, which is superior and posterior to the femur, can be identified by palpation.\n2. Operative Procedure\nReduce inhalational isoflurane to 2% (halothane 1%) and place the mouse on its side (side intended for surgery facing up), under an operating or dissecting microscope. Alternatively surgery can be performed with surgical loupes since 3.5X magnification is satisfactory for an adult (20-25 g) mouse.\nDon sterile gloves. Identify the sciatic notch by palpation. Using a scalpel, incise the skin of the lateral thigh from the sciatic notch to the knee (approximately 1 cm).",
    "Gently spread the skin. Identify the biceps femoris muscle, which is the flat superficial muscle of the lateral thigh immediately beneath the skin. Using fine scissors, split the biceps femoris muscle along the muscle fibers and hold open with a spring retractor to expose the sciatic nerve and its branches.\nIdentify the sciatic nerve immediately deep to the biceps femoris muscle. It can be identified by its characteristic shiny white color and is approximately 0.8 mm in diameter. It runs from the sciatic notch to the knee, branching into the tibial, peroneal and sural nerves at the level of the popliteal fossa.\nGently separate the tibial from the peroneal and sural nerve branches with ultrafine forceps and spring microdissecting scissors. The tibial nerve is the largest branch and is usually central. It's important not to crush the nerve while separating the branches. Holding the nerve just on the outer adventicial layer with the ultrafine forceps, and keeping the nerve slack (not taught), will avoid nerve crush and traction injury.\nFor complete and lasting denervation, cut the tibial nerve with microdissecting scissors as distally as possible, carefully avoiding the popliteal vessels. Alternatively, for temporary denervation with expected complete reinnervation in 2-4 weeks, the tibial nerve can simply be crushed with ultrafine forceps for 15 sec instead of transected. (Peripheral nerves regrow following injury and will reinnervate target muscle.)\nIf complete denervation is required, suture the end of the transected tibial nerve to the anterior surface of the biceps femoris muscle with 10-0 Nylon and re-approximate the biceps femoris with 5-0 Vicryl to prevent aberrant re-innervation of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.\nClose the skin with a running 5-0 Vicryl suture.\n3. Post Operative Care\nTurn off the inhalational anesthetic but maintain the flow of oxygen. Administer buprinorphine (or substitute) analgesic subcutaneously.",
    "Transfer the mouse to a clean cage with no bedding while waking from anesthesia. Keep on a warming blanket within the cage and under direct observation until ambulating.\nTransfer and house in soft bottom cage (not wire) with ample soft bedding.\nInspect the operative limb daily for condition of the surgical wound and the foot for the development of decubitus heel ulcers or evidence of chewing. Minor problems can be managed with topical antibiotics or antiseptics such as proviodine. Endpoint indicators requiring animal euthanasia are weight loss, evidence of poor self care (ruffled fur), and hunched posture. In addition, animals with major wound disruption or ulcers that do not heal in 1-2 weeks with topical antibiotics or appear to have pain should be sacrificed.\n4. Denervated Gastrocnemius and Soleus Muscle Harvest\nAt the post-operative time point desired, weigh the mouse and sacrifice with CO2 overdose.\nShave the medial aspect of both the operative and contralateral control legs and clean with alcohol. Place the mouse under an operating or dissecting microscope, or alternatively use surgical viewing loupes for magnification.",
    "On the operative limb, incise the medial calf skin with a scalpel from the ankle to the knee and circumferentially around the ankle. Gently pull the skin with forceps off the muscle and proximally toward the thigh. This exposes all the muscles of the leg. Identify the gastrocnemius muscle, which is the calf muscle that runs from the knee to the ankle on the posterior aspect of the leg and lies immediately underneath the skin. Identify the distal insertion of the biceps femoris muscle, proximal to the gastrocnemius muscle on the medial aspect of the knee. At its distal insertion the biceps femoris appears thin and filmy and overlies the most proximal portion of the gastrocnemius. Using scissors and blunt end dissection, gently separate the distal insertion of the biceps femoris from the gastrocnemius muscle.\nAt its distal insertion into the calcaneous, the gastrocnemius muscle tapers into the Achilles tendon. Identify the Achilles tendon, which appears white and sinewy. Hold the Achilles tendon with forceps, taking care not to hold or crush the gastrocnemius muscle, and divide the Achilles tendon from the calcaneus insertion using scissors.\nStill holding the tendon, gently lift the gastrocnemius muscle (pale red) off the deep soleus (deeper red), from the distal insertion towards its origin at the knee (the soleus can be harvested separately).\nDissect the gastrocnemius off the leg by dividing the origin of the gastrocnemius from the medial and lateral femur chondyles using scissors. Very gentle traction on the muscle facilitates this process. Be careful not to crush the muscle.",
    "The soleus will now be plainly visible, immediately under the site of the gastrocnemius. Lift the soleus from its insertion on the Achilles tendon to its origin on the posterior calf. If the soleus is inadvertently raised with the gastrocnemius, gently separate it from the harvested specimen. The gastrocnemius (light red) and soleus (dark red) remain easily identifiable in the harvested specimen due to their color differences.\nWeigh the muscles separately on a precision scale.\nSplit the muscles vertically, half for snap freezing in liquid nitrogen (for subsequent protein and/or RNA extraction), and half for histology (i.e. morphometric assessment, immunohistology) fixing either in 10% formalin, or frozen fixation in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen, as desired.\nRepeat from step 4.3 above on the control, un-operated, side to harvest control gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.\nSubscription Required.
