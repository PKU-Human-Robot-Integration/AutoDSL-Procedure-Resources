    "This protocol was designed according to the ethical requirement specified by the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München and with the approval of the ethics board of the department.\n1. Participants\nRecruit a sufficient number of naive participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and without neurological or psychiatric disorders. 10 participants are recommended based on similar, recent protocols21,22.\nNOTE: Overall, we recruited 13 participants (aged 20-28, 7 females, 12 right-eye dominant, 1 author) from which 3 were excluded from final analysis since their orientation discrimination performance remained at chance level for all tested locations.\n2. Experimental Setup\nConduct the experiment in a quiet and dimly illuminated room under the supervision of an experienced experimenter familiar with eye tracking and all other experimental components.\nPrepare an experimental setup consisting of a computer, a cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor, a standard keyboard, two loudspeakers, and an eye tracker (see Table of Materials).\nSequence and control the experiment using an appropriate software (see Table of Materials). Write a script which can be run on the software to load and launch the experiment automatically for each participant (https://github.com/mszinte/CompAttExo). Ensure that the script encodes all necessary experimental parameters and implements stimulus presentation as well as behavioral and eye data collection.\nDisplay all visual stimuli on a CRT screen with a minimum vertical refresh rate of 120 Hz. Ensure the proper display of visual Gabors via gamma linearization of the experimental screen.\nAssess participants' evaluation of the discrimination target orientation (counterclockwise vs. clockwise) via the left and right arrow keys on a standard keyboard.\nProvide auditory feedback via loudspeakers upon incorrect manual responses.\n3. Eye Tracking\nRecord the gaze of participants' dominant eye at a sampling rate of at least 1 kHz throughout the entire experiment via an eye tracker.",
    "Ask the participant to sit down comfortably on a chair, place their chin on a chinrest, and lean their forehead against a bar to restrain head movement during the experiment. Individually adjust the height of the chair, the chinrest and the forehead bar such that participants' eyes align with the center of the experimental monitor.\nIndividual Eye Tracker Calibration\nBefore each experimental block (duration: approximately 10 min) and whenever necessary (e.g. after noticeable head movements and resulting shifts of the estimated fixation), run a calibration procedure to guarantee that participants' gaze can be accurately tracked within a radius of 1°.\nNOTE: Here, we used a 13-point calibration procedure to get an accurate estimate of the characteristic light reflections (pupil and corneal reflection) of the tracked eye as a function of the gaze.\n\t\t\nAsk the participant to follow a dot moving across different locations on the screen with their eyes to estimate their gaze position.\nRepeat the procedure with a dot rotation of 30° and compare the measured gaze position to the estimated gaze position to validate the initial calibration. The calibration can be considered accurate when the averaged difference between the estimated gaze position following the calibration stage and the measured gaze position in the validation stage is below 1°.\nRepeat the calibration procedure whenever the participant breaks fixation repetitively to guarantee high tracking accuracy throughout the experiment.\nDuring the experiment, monitor correct fixation at the screen center at the beginning of each trial. Only start a trial if the gaze stays within a radius of 2° around the central fixation target for at least 200 ms.\n4. Instructions",
    "Provide participants with clear task instructions. Present the task instructions at least once at the beginning of each experimental session in the form of a written text, together with a visualization of the trial chronology. Encourage participants to carefully read through the instructions and to ask remaining questions to the experimenter.\n\tNOTE: The instructions, as presented to the participants before each block, are shown in Figure 1.\n\t\nInstruct the participant to fixate at the center of the screen at the beginning of each trial.\nInform the participant that 24 flickering distractor streams will appear on the screen and that two of them will be cued by white frames, which will either be flashed shortly or remain on the screen until the trial end.\nAsk the participant to execute a saccade towards the center of one of the two cued distractor streams at free choice. Emphasize that participants should move their eyes as fast and as accurately as possible upon the onset of the cues.\nInform the participant that, for a short duration during the trial, a tilted Gabor will be presented randomly at one of the 24 distractor streams.\nAsk the participant to manually report whether the tilted Gabor was rotated clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the vertical by pressing the right or left arrow on the keyboard, respectively. Explain that a sound will be played if the orientation of the tilted Gabor is being reported incorrectly.\n5. Experimental Design, Stimuli, and Trial Chronology\nEnsure to partition the experiment into at least two experimental sessions on different days to guarantee participants' concentration across the entire duration of the experiment. Within an experimental session, prompt participants to take short breaks in between consecutive blocks.",
    "NOTE: This experiment consisted of 24 blocks, each including 290 online correct trials (all trials without fixation breaks and with a saccade onset between 50 and 350 ms after the saccade targets onset; incorrect trials were repeated at the end of a block), amounting to a total duration of about 5 h.\nDeliberately predefine stimulus features (color, luminance, and size), stimulus timing, and a viewing distance which ensures the desired angular stimulus size. While most features of the visual stimuli (e.g., size, luminance, and contrast) can be adjusted to account for specific experimental purposes based on piloting, precise stimulus timing is crucial to assess visual attention during the presaccadic interval.\nStimuli and Trial Chronology\nPresent all stimuli on a gray (~19.5 cd/m2) background in order to minimize visual and screen aftereffects.\nNOTE: A visualization of the experimental procedure can be found in Figure 2.\nPresent a fixation target (FT) in the form of a black (~0 cd/m2) and white (~57 cd/m2) \"bull's eye\" (0.4° radius) at the screen center at trial start. Remove the fixation target from the screen together with the onset of the saccade targets.\nDisplay 24 evenly spaced distractor streams (DS) at a radius of 10° from the fixation target at the trial start. Use dynamic stimuli, alternating every 25 ms (40 Hz) between a vertical Gabor patch (frequency: 2.5 cpd; 100 % contrast; random phase selected each stream refresh; SD of the Gaussian window: 1.1°; mean luminance: ~28.5 cd/m2) and a Gaussian pixel noise mask (made of approximately 0.22° width pixels with the same Gaussian envelope as the Gabors).\nNOTE: The use of flickering noise helps to minimize attentional capture due to sudden onsets that are normally associated with static stimuli and thus reduces discrimination target detectability without concurrent selective deployment of attention21.",
    "Between 300 and 600 ms (in steps of the screen refresh rate of ~8 ms) after the onset of the fixation target, present two saccade targets (ST1 and ST2) in the form of gray circles (~39 cd/m2; 1.1° radius; 0.2° width) surrounding two randomly chosen distractor streams. Ensure to vary the time of saccade target onset from trial to trial to avoid that participants adopt a predictive saccade execution pattern.\n\t\t\nRandomly present the two saccade targets at an angular distance of either 30° or 90° across trials.\nRandomly display the saccade targets for either 50 ms (transient cueing condition: tST1+2) or until the end of the trial (continuous cueing condition: cST1+2) across trials.\nRandomly present a discrimination target (DT) at one of the 24 distractor streams and between 75 and 175 ms after the onset of the saccade targets. Display the discrimination target, a tilted Gabor patch, rotated clockwise or counterclockwise by 12 ° relative to the vertical, for 25 ms to replace the vertical Gabor patch within the randomly selected distractor stream. Select the time window for discrimination target presentation to maximize the number of trials in which the discrimination target offset occurred before saccade onset.\nNOTE: The applied tilt level of the discrimination target was derived from pretests with the objective of producing visual discrimination performance above chance level at attended locations. The tilt level can be generally changed but experimenters should first test whether participants can properly discriminate the target angle at least at the cued locations.\nErase all stimuli from the screen 500 ms after the onset of the saccade targets such that only the gray background remains.",
    "Wait for the participant to indicate the orientation of the discrimination target via the keyboard (by pressing the left arrow for counterclockwise orientations and the right arrow for clockwise orientations) and play a feedback sound whenever participants report the discrimination target orientation incorrectly. Automatically launch the next trial once a manual response was given.\n6. Data Preprocessing and Analysis\nProcess the recorded eye data before proceeding to final data analysis. Only include trials in which the participant maintained fixation within a 2° radius around the fixation target without blinking and initiated a saccade landing between 7° and 13° from the fixation target (i.e. within ± 30 % of the instructed saccade size). Ensure that any measure of visual sensitivity was collected during the presaccadic interval by including only those trials in which the discrimination target offset occurred before the saccade onset.\nNOTE: In total, 75.7% of all trials were included in the final analyses after eye data preprocessing.\nIn order to analyze data as a function of the location of the discrimination target relative to the location of the saccade targets, rotate the stimulus configuration of each trial as to align the saccade target locations symmetrically around the geometrical angle 0 of the stimulus stream orbit.\nSplit trials as a function of the saccade landing direction. To do so, divide the entire stimulus stream orbit into 24 even angular sectors of 15° (±7.5°) centered on each distractor stream and combine trials entailing saccades directed towards the same respective sector.",
    "Define visual sensitivity as: d' = z(hit rate) − z(false alarm rate). Count clockwise responses to clockwise discrimination targets as hits and clockwise responses to counterclockwise discrimination targets as false alarms (and vice versa). Substitute discrimination performance values of 100% and 0% by values of 99% and 1%, respectively, before transforming them into d'. Transform discrimination performance values below the chance level (50% or d' = 0) into negative d' values."
