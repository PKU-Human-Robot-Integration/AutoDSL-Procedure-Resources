    "Animal care and experimentation were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines, under the institutional license A91272108. The study protocols were approved by the institutional animal care committee CEEA #59 and received authorization by the Direction Départementale de la Protection des Populations under the reference number APAFIS #32589-2021072719047904 v4 and APAFIS #21474-2019071210549691 v2. See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, instruments, and reagents used in these protocols.\n1. Mechanical retinal injury\nNOTE: The injury paradigm protocol described here consists of a mechanical retinal puncture of a tadpole from stage 45 onwards. It, therefore, does not target any particular retinal cell type but damages the whole thickness of the retina at the puncture site.\nPreparation of the anesthetic for tadpoles\n\t\nPrepare a 10% stock solution of benzocaine. For a total volume of 10 mL, add 1 g of benzocaine, 2 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 8 mL of propylene glycol. Conserve the stock solution for several months at 4 °C protected from light with aluminum foil.\nPrepare 0.005% benzocaine solution at the time of use by adding 25 µL of 10% benzocaine stock solution to 50 mL of tadpole-rearing water (filtered and dechlorinated tap water). Mix well.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of benzocaine is particularly low because tadpoles are highly sensitive to anesthesia compared to adults.\nPin preparation\n\t\nAttach a 0.2 mm diameter sterile pin to a sterilized pin holder (Figure 1A).\nTadpole anesthesia\n\t\nUse a dip net to catch tadpoles in their tanks. Transfer them into a new tank containing the 0.005% benzocaine solution. Wait a few minutes until the tadpoles stop reacting to stimuli (tapping the tank or direct contact).\n\t\tNOTE: Several tadpoles may be anesthetized simultaneously, but the time spent in the anesthetic solution should be less than 30 min.\nRetinal puncture",
    "Use a spoon to catch one tadpole and put it carefully on a small Petri dish (55 mm diameter) containing a wet tissue. Position the tadpole dorsal side up in the middle of the Petri dish.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, puncture the retina by gently inserting the pin on the dorsal side of the eye, until it passes through the retina (Figure 1A). If several pokes are needed, repeat this procedure at different places. After puncturing the right eye, turn the Petri dish 180° to puncture the left eye.\nTransfer the lesioned tadpole to a large tank containing 1 L of rearing water by carefully immersing the Petri dish. Monitor the tadpoles until they are fully awakened.\n2. Conditional rod cell ablation using the NTR-MTZ system\nThe protocol aims to induce specific rod cell ablation in the Xenopus Tg(rho:GFP-NTR) transgenic line6, available at the TEFOR Paris-Saclay's zootechnics service, which hosts the French Xenopus resource center. This chemogenetic system uses the capacity of nitroreductase (NTR) enzyme to convert the prodrug metronidazole (MTZ) into a cytotoxic DNA cross-linking agent, to specifically ablate NTR-expressing rods (Figure 1B). Two detailed protocols to make Tg(rho:GFP-NTR) or Tg(rho:NTR) transgenic animals and induce degeneration have been published previously 7,8. Here, we simply detail the induction of retinal degeneration and how to monitor the degeneration process in vivo.\nPreparation of metronidazole solution\n\t\nPrepare 10 mM MTZ solution at the time of use by dissolving 1.67 g of MTZ powder in a dark bottle in 1 L of tadpole-rearing water containing 0.1% DMSO, using a magnetic stir-bar and a magnetic agitator.\n\t\tNOTE: MTZ is light-sensitive. Complete dissolution may take up to 10 min.\nGenerating transgenic tadpoles by natural mating from the Tg(rho:GFP-NTR) line",
    "NOTE: Since transgenic males represent a precious stock, we prefer to generate embryos via natural mating to not sacrifice the male and to use it repeatedly.\n\t\nHormone administration\n\t\t\nInject 600 I.U. of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) with 25G needles into the dorsal lymph sac of Xenopus laevis wild-type females. Inject transgenic males with 100-200 I.U. of hCG into the dorsal lymph sac. For live monitoring of rod degeneration (step 2.4), use albino Xenopus rather than pigmented ones, to better visualize fluorescence variations across the eye of the generated transgenic tadpoles.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Xenopus females can be primed with 50 I.U. of hCG 1 to 7 days before planned ovulation, but this is optional.\nMating and egg collection\n\t\t\nImmediately after the hCG injection, put in a tank one Tg(rho:GFP-NTR) transgenic male together with one hCG-injected female at 20 °C until the next day. Use a large volume (at least 10 L) and add small objects for the eggs to adhere to, so that the eggs are not damaged by the adults' movements. The following day, when the frogs are no longer in amplexus, remove the adults from the tank and collect embryos.\nRaising of embryos and tadpoles\n\t\t\nStage embryos and tadpoles according to the normal table of Xenopus development9.\nRaise embryos in a tank filled with tadpole-rearing water. From stage 45, feed tadpoles with powdered fry food and oxygenate the water with a bubbler. Add water daily if necessary to compensate for evaporation and change the whole tank water weekly.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, it is also possible to exchange 50% of the volume twice a week. A detailed protocol can be found in10.\nTransgenic embryo sorting\n\t\t\nFrom stage 37/38, sort and select transgenic embryos under a fluorescence stereomicroscope by directly visualizing GFP (Figure 1C).\nTadpole MTZ treatment",
    "Transfer Tg(rho:GFP-NTR) transgenic tadpoles to a tank containing 10 mM MTZ solution and rear them at 20 °C in darkness for 1 week. Use transgenic siblings raised in tadpole-rearing water containing 0.1% DMSO as controls.\nChange the MTZ and control solution every other day during the treatment period. Feed the tadpoles as usual during the MTZ treatment.\nFor individual fluorescence monitoring (step 2.4), place each tadpole in its small container with 30 mL of MTZ or control solution from step 2.3.1 onward.\n\t\tNOTE: MTZ treatment can be performed at any time from stage 45 onwards.\nLive monitoring of rod degeneration\n\tNOTE: The progressive degeneration of the rods can be monitored in real time. Therefore, perform steps 2.4.1. to 2.4.4. before MTZ treatment and then regularly after treatment.\n\t\nFollow steps 1.1 and 1.3 for the preparation of the anesthetic and the tadpole anesthesia, respectively.\nUse a spoon to catch one tadpole and put it carefully on a wet tissue in a small Petri dish (55 mm diameter). Observe the GFP fluorescence under a fluorescent stereomicroscope (excitation wavelength = 488 nm and emission wavelength = 509 nm) and take photographs of the eye. A decreased fluorescence intensity reflects the degradation of rods.\n\t\tNOTE: To make quantitative comparisons, the same settings must be maintained for imaging all tadpoles.\nTransfer the imaged tadpole to a large tank containing 1 L of rearing water by carefully immersing the Petri dish. Monitor the tadpoles until they are fully awakened.\nCompare the fluorescence intensity between MTZ-treated and control tadpole eyes to monitor and assess the efficacy of the degeneration process.\n3. Rod cell degeneration by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated rhodopsin knockout",
    "NOTE: This protocol is established to generate a model of retinitis pigmentosa in Xenopus laevis by inducing specific rod cell degeneration using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated rhodopsin knockout. The % of insertion-deletion (indels) in F0 is provided in11 and is ~75%. Such a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated rhodopsin knockout can also be performed in Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles 11.\nPreparation of solutions and reagents\n\t\ncrRNA and tracrRNA ordering\n\t\t\nBuy the synthetic CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targeting the rhodopsin (rho) gene and the standard trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). The crRNA is composed of a rho target-specific region (GCUCUGCUAAGUAAUACUGA) and another one (GUUUUAGAGCUAUGCU) that hybridizes to the tracrRNA.\ncrRNA:tracrRNA duplex (rho gRNA duplex)\n\t\t\nResuspend crRNA and tracrRNA at 100 µM in the nuclease-free duplex buffer.\nPrepare the gRNA duplex by mixing 3 µL of 100 µM rho crRNA, 3 µL of 100 µM tracrRNA, and 94 µL of duplex buffer. The final concentrations are 36 ng/µL rho crRNA, and 67 ng/µL tracrRNA.\nAnneal the oligos by heating them at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cool them to room temperature. Make aliquots and store them at -20 °C.\nCRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex (i.e., gRNA duplex/Cas9 protein)\n\t\t\nAt the time of use, prepare the mixture of rho gRNA duplex and the Cas9 protein. For 20 µL, add 10 µL of the rho gRNA duplex solution, 2 µL of Cas9 protein (stock at 5 mg/mL), 2 µL of fluorescein lysine dextran (stock at 10 mg/mL), and 6 µL of RNase-free water.\nTo form the ribonucleoprotein complex, incubate for 10 min at 37 °C and let the solution cool to room temperature.\nFor 20 µL of the control solution, mix 2 µL of Cas9 protein, 2 µL of fluorescein lysine dextran, and 16 µL of RNase-free water.\nPreparation of 10x, 1x, and 0.1x MBS solutions",
    "Prepare Modified Barth's Saline stock solution (10x MBS) by adding 11.92 g of HEPES, 51.43 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.75 g of potassium chloride (KCl), 2.1 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), and 2.46 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4, 7 H2O) in 800 mL of type II water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with 30% sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Add type II water until the volume is 1 L and sterilize by autoclaving. Store at room temperature.\nPrepare 1 L of 1x MBS solution by diluting 100 mL of 10x MBS salt solution and 7 mL of 0.1 M calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2, 2H2O) in type II water. Store at room temperature.\nPrepare 0.1x MBS solution by diluting 1x MBS solution in type II water. Store at room temperature.\nBenzocaine solution for adults\n\t\t\nPrepare 0.05% benzocaine solution by adding 5 mL of 10% benzocaine stock solution (see step 1.1.1.) to 1 L of tadpole-rearing water. Mix well.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Conserve this solution for several months at 4 °C protected from light with aluminum foil. Bring the solution to room temperature before being used on animals.\nL-cysteine solution\n\t\t\nPrepare the dejellying solution at the time of use by adding 2 g of L-cysteine hydrochloric monohydrate to 100 mL of 0.1x MBS solution. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with 30% NaOH.\nPolysucrose solution\n\t\t\nPrepare the dense polysucrose solution by adding 3 g of polysucrose to 100 mL of 0.1x MBS solution. Store this solution for a few weeks at 4 °C.\nIn vitro fertilization and dejellying\n\tNOTE: More details about Xenopus in vitro fertilization can be found in a detailed dedicated protocol in12.\n\t\nHormone administration to Xenopus laevis females to induce ovulation",
    "Approximately 15 h prior to oocyte harvesting, inject 600 I.U. of hCG into the dorsal lymph sac of the female and keep it overnight at 18 °C.\nTestis dissection\n\t\t\nEuthanize the Xenopus male with a lethal dose of 0.05% benzocaine solution for 10-15 min. As a complementary euthanasia method, sever the spine immediately posterior to the skull with sharp and sturdy scissors. Open the abdominal cavity with dissection scissors, cut the testes out, and trim away any attached fat and capillaries. Place each testis immediately on ice in 1 mL of 1x MBS.\nSperm preparation\n\t\t\nCrush one testis using a pestle for microcentrifuge tubes and dilute the suspension in a 15 mL tube containing 9 mL of 1x MBS. Add 10 µg/mL of gentamicin to the second testis tube and keep it at 4 °C for a few days for further fertilization experiments.\nIn vitro fertilization\n\t\t\nGently massage the back of the hormone-injected female and collect the oocytes in a Petri dish (100 mm diameter). Spread a few drops of the sperm solution to the oocytes. Wait 5 min and cover them with 0.1x MBS. Wait 10 min before proceeding with dejellying.\nFertilized egg dejellying\n\t\t\nReplace the 0.1x MBS solution with the dejellying solution to remove the jelly coat from the fertilized eggs (~5 min). Thoroughly rinse the embryos 5-6 times with 0.1x MBS and transfer them to a new 100 mm Petri dish filled with 0.1x MBS.\nPreparation of the microinjection system\n\t\nSharpen glass capillaries with a micropipette puller13.\nFill a sharpened capillary with 2-10 µL of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex or the control solution using a microloader tip and place the capillary into the microinjector handler.",
    "At the highest magnification of a stereomicroscope, break off the capillary tip with fine forceps, and adjust the injection time (~400 ms) to obtain an ejection volume of 10 nL per pulse. Set the ejection pressure to around 40 PSI.\nOne-cell-stage embryo microinjection with the CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex\n\t\nPlace one-cell-stage embryos on a grid (1 mm nylon tissue) glued in a 100 mm Petri dish filled with 3% polysucrose solution (Figure 1D).\nUsing the microinjector and under a stereomicroscope, inject 10 nL of the CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex (which corresponds to 500 pg of gRNA duplex + 5 ng of Cas9 protein per embryo) or control solution at the level of the animal pole, in the cortical region, just under the cytoplasmic membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescein lysine dextran contained in the solution allows subsequent sorting of the injected embryos.\nTransfer the injected embryos to a new 100 mm Petri dish containing a clean polysucrose solution and place them at 21 °C.\nOn the first day, regularly sort out the well-developed embryos and replace the polysucrose solution with 0.1x MBS around 5 h after microinjection.\nWait for 24 h after injection to sort and select well-injected rho crispant embryos under a fluorescent stereomicroscope by visualizing fluorescein lysine dextran (Figure 1E).\n\t\tNOTE: The earlier the microinjection after fertilization, the more effective the knockout.\nRaising of embryos and tadpoles\n\t\nRaise rho crispant embryos in 0.1x MBS in Petri dishes until stage 37/38. Remove dead embryos daily and change the 0.1x MBS solution. From stage 37/38, raise embryos in a tank filled with tadpole-rearing water, and from stage 45 proceed as in step 2.2.3.\n4. Retinal cell degeneration by cytotoxic intraocular CoCl 2 injections",
    "NOTE: This protocol is established to induce retinal cell degeneration by intraocular injections of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. According to the dose, it can trigger a cone-specific degeneration or a broader degeneration14. We use this protocol in Xenopus laevis tadpoles aged from stage 48 onwards. It can also be used in Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles.\nPreparation of buffer and reagents\n\t\nPrepare 0.005% benzocaine solution at the time of use as in step 1.1.\nPrepare 100 mM CoCl2 stock solution by adding 118.5 mg to 5 mL of 0.1x MBS (see step 3.1.4 to prepare 0.1x MBS). Conserve this stock solution for several months at 4 °C, protected from light with aluminum foil.\n\t\tCAUTION: CoCl2 is classified as a toxic compound for human and animal life. Carefully follow the instructions for handling, storage, and waste disposal on the safety data sheet.\nFor cone-specific degeneration, prepare a 10 mM CoCl2 solution at the time of use from the 100 mM stock solution diluted in 0.1x MBS. For broader retinal cell degeneration, prepare a 25 mM CoCl2 solution.\nPreparation of the injection system\n\t\nSharpen glass capillaries with a micropipette puller 13.\nFill a sharpened capillary with 2-10 µL of 10 or 25 mM CoCl2 solution or the control solution (0.1x MBS) using a microloader tip and place the capillary into the microinjector handler.\nAt the highest magnification of a stereomicroscope, break off the capillary tip with fine forceps, and adjust the injection time (approximately 100 ms) to obtain an ejection volume of 15-40 nL per pulse. Set the ejection pressure to ~40 PSI.",
    "NOTE: The size of the drop should be adapted to the stage of the tadpoles and the size of their eye. For example, at stages 48-49, the drop size is ~15-20 nL, while it is 30-40 nL at stages 52-56. Visually, the size of the drop is a little larger than the lens size.\nCoCl2 intraocular injections\n\t\nUse a dip net to catch tadpoles in their tanks. Transfer them to 50 mL of 0.005% benzocaine solution. Wait a few minutes until the tadpoles stop reacting to the stimuli.\n\t\tNOTE: Several tadpoles may be anesthetized at the same time, but the time spent in the anesthetic should be less than 30 min.\nUse a spoon to catch one tadpole and put it carefully in a small Petri dish (55 mm diameter) containing a wet tissue. Position the tadpole dorsal side up in the middle of the Petri dish (Figure 1F,G).\nUse the microinjector under a stereomicroscope to inject intraocularly the CoCl2 solution. Gently insert the capillary into the eye over the lens. When the capillary tip is inside the eye, eject two drops per eye. After injecting the right eye, turn the Petri dish manually 180° to inject the left eye.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the injection is done inside the eye, so a slight swelling of the eye must be seen after each ejection of the solution. The tadpole should stay outside the water as little as possible. The injection of both eyes should take less than 1 min.\nTransfer the injected tadpole to a large tank containing 1 L of rearing water by immersing it carefully in the Petri dish (Figure 1H). Monitor the tadpoles until they are fully awakened.\n5. Staining to assess retinal damage or retinal degeneration\nTadpole fixation and dehydration",
    "Prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution by diluting 100 mL of 32% PFA solution into 700 mL of 1x PBS. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with NaOH. Aliquot this stock solution and conserve it for several months at -20 °C.\nEuthanize the tadpoles in 0.01% benzocaine and transfer them into a vial containing 4% PFA for 2 h at room temperature with agitation or overnight at 4 °C. Rinse 3 x 5 min in 1x PBS.\nProgressively dehydrate tadpoles by successive 30 min incubations in 70% and 95% ethanol (diluted in type II water), followed by three more 1 h incubations in 100% ethanol. Store the tadpole heads at this step at -20 °C or directly transfer them to 100% butanol overnight for further steps.\nParaffin sectioning\n\t\nReplace 100% butanol with melted paraffin for 2 h at 62 °C. Replace the paraffin for 2 x 2 h of additional incubations at 62 °C.\nTransfer tadpole heads in disposable paraffin embedding molds and orient them so that their eyes are well aligned, and then allow the paraffin to harden. Store the blocks at room temperature.\nTrim the excess paraffin and mount the block with the embedded tadpole(s) on the microtome support.\nSection the block with a microtome at the appropriate thickness (10-12 µm). Transfer the ribbons with sections on a slide previously covered with 3% glycerin albumin (diluted in water).\nPlace the slide on a slide warmer at 42 °C for a few minutes and then remove the excess of glycerin albumin. Let the slides dry overnight in an oven at 37 °C.",
    "Dewax by immersing the slides for 2 x 15 min in a Coplin jar filled with 100% xylene. Rehydrate the sections with graded ethanol series: 100% twice, 70%, 50% (diluted in type II water), ~5 min each, followed by 2 x 5 min in water.\nImmunofluorescence labeling\n\t\nPrepare 100 mM sodium citrate (CiNa) stock solution by adding 29.4 g of sodium citrate trisodium salt dihydrate (C6H5Na3O7, 2H2O) to 1 L of Type II water; adjust the pH to 6 with Hydrochloric acid (HCl). Sterilize by autoclaving and store at room temperature for several months. Prepare the unmasking solution at the time of use by adding 25 mL of 100 mM CiNa stock solution to 225 mL of type II water. Add 125 µL of Tween-20 and mix well (final concentration is 10 mM CiNa, 0.05% Tween-20).\nPrepare Hoechst stock solution at 10 mg/mL by adding 100 mg of bisBenzimide H 33258 to 10 mL of type I water. Conserve this stock solution for several months at 4 °C, protected from light with an aluminum foil. Prepare Hoechst solution at 7.5 µg/mL by adding 300 µL of Hoechst stock solution to 400 mL of 1x PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution may be used up to 10 times and conserved for around 6 months at 4 °C, protected from light with aluminum foil.\nAfter dewaxing sections, perform antigen retrieval by boiling the sections in the unmasking solution for 9 min. Let the solution cool for 20 min.\nRinse once in type II water and once in 1x PBS. Put the slides flat in a humid chamber and add 400-600 µL of blocking solution per slide (antibody diluent + 0.2% Triton X100) for 30 min.",
    "Replace the blocking solution with 200 µL per slide of the primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution. Use a coverslip to spread the solution over the sections, avoiding bubble formation. Incubate overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber.\nTransfer the slides to a Coplin jar and rinse for 3 x 10 min in 1x PBS supplemented with 0.1 % Triton X100. Put the slides flat, add 400 µL per slide of the secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution, and leave for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber.\nTransfer slides to a Coplin jar and rinse for 3 x 5 min with 1x PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X100.\nCounterstain cell nuclei with the Hoechst solution for 10 min and rinse 3 x 5 min with 1x PBS.\nPlace coverslips over slides in an aqueous mounting medium specifically designed to preserve fluorescence. Let the slides dry for 1 h at room temperature and store them at 4 °C.\nImage the slides with a fluorescence microscope.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to assess retinal damage\n\tNOTE: Instead of labeling a particular cell type by immunostaining, general retinal histology can be assessed with H&E coloration.\n\t\nAfter dewaxing sections, perform nucleic acid labeling by immersing slides in hematoxylin solution for 2 min. Rinse well with tap water.\nPerform cytoplasm labeling by immersing slides in 1% eosin solution for 1 min. Rinse quickly with water.\n\t\tNOTE: Eosin is very soluble; if the slides are left too long in the water, all the dye disappears.\nRinse 2 x 5 min in 100% ethanol and 2 x 5 min in xylene.\nUnder the hood, place coverslips over the slides in 4-5 drops of a mounting medium. Let the slides dry under a hood and image the following day with a microscope.",
    "Detection of apoptotic cells\n\t\nAfter dewaxing sections (see section 5.2.6), follow the kit manufacturer's protocol to detect apoptotic DNA fragmentation.\nPerform nuclei staining by immersing slides in Hoechst solution (see section 5.3.8) and mount with an aqueous mounting medium specifically designed to preserve fluorescence.
