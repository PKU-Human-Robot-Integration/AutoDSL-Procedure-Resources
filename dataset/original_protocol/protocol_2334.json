    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExperimental procedure #1: Intranasal vaccination\nThis section details the handling, preparation, and intranasal delivery of liquid agents in the murine model (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Although this protocol utilizes adenoviral-vectored vaccines as the model system for demonstration purposes, this procedure applies to delivery of any liquid solution such as viruses, bacteria, antibodies, drugs, etc.\nTiming: 5 min per mouse\nAnesthetize mice with an approved inhaled or injectable anesthetic (see note).\nOnce mice are anesthetized, retrieve one from the anesthetic chamber and place the mouse in your hand to observe its respiration rate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1942-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mouse handling and intranasal vaccination procedure\n(A) Mouse placement in the palm.\n(B) Thumb placement on the jaw and throat.\n(C) Mouse positioning and thumb placement on the jaw and throat.\n(D) Pipette tip positioning over the nare prior to intranasal vaccination. Note thumb positioning.\n(E) Droplet on the nose during intranasal vaccination. Note thumb positioning.\nIntranasal instillation should be performed when the mouse breathes once every 2–3 s.\nNote: When using gaseous anesthesia, the oxygen and anesthetic flow rates directly affect the respiration rate of mice in the anesthesia chamber. Researchers should first familiarize themselves with their specific equipment.\nCritical: Regulation of the mouse’s breathing rate is imperative to ensure optimal timing for intranasal instillation. Gaseous anesthesia allows for more refined control of breathing rate and is recommended over injectable anesthesia.\nOnce anesthesia is achieved, load the pipette with the agent set to be intranasally administered and set it aside until step 7.",
    "Note: Depending on the volume of the liquid to be instilled, a single bolus of 25 μL, or two 20 μL boluses may be delivered. Additionally, the volume of liquid administered affects distribution in the lung. The larger the volume, the deeper in the lung it will reach, but the more difficult it will be to instill the entire volume (Southam et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nPlace and position the mouse on its back in the palm of your non-dominant hand (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nUsing your thumb, trace along the midline of the mouse, over the xyphoid process/sternum, up the throat, and onto the jaw and throat (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nApply light pressure.\nCritical: Pay close attention to how the mouse is placed in your non-dominant hand (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Additionally, it is imperative that the jaw remains tightly closed to prevent the mouse from swallowing the intranasally administered liquid. Researchers should first practice and familiarize themselves with this process. In general, observation of the mouse’s respiration without visible swallowing is an indicator of proper thumb positioning and pressure.\nAngle the supine-positioned mouse at approximately a 60° incline, ensuring your thumb remains depressed on the jaw (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nHolding the mouse in this position, re-examine its breathing rate.\nIf the mouse is not breathing at this point, adjust your thumb positioning and re-apply pressure, ensuring that rhythmic breathing is maintained.\nOnce a rhythmic breathing rate (as described in step 1a) is observed, take the loaded pipette with your dominant hand, and position the pipette tip just above the nares (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nDepress the pipette plunger to slowly instill a droplet onto the mouse’s nares (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nWait for the mouse to take a breath, inhaling the droplet.",
    "Once the droplet has been inhaled, wait for an additional breath before proceeding with the next droplet to ensure the first droplet is fully internalized.\nOnce the droplet has been inhaled, maintain the supine mouse in the 60° position for another 2–3 breaths to ensure the inhaled liquid does not bubble back out of the nose.\nIf bubbling is observed, the liquid can be aspirated by pipette and re-administered, as described in steps 7 and 8.\nRemove your thumb from the mouse’s jaw and place it on the mouse’s chest.\nDepress lightly. If the droplet has been efficiently inhaled, turbulence should be felt with every breath.\nReturn the mouse to its cage and place it on its back to recover.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Intranasal instillation of a liquid bolus into an anesthetized mouse, related to Experimental procedure #1, steps 3–1\n1\nExperimental procedure #2: Bronchoalveolar lavage\nThis section details how to excise and prepare the lungs for extrathoracic BAL, and secondly describes how to process the BAL fluid for isolation and downstream utilization of acellular and cellular airway components.\nTiming: 10 min per mouse\nMouse preparation, lung excision, and BAL needle placement.\nAnesthetize mice and maintain anesthesia as per animal research ethics board-approved protocols.\nEither gaseous or injectable anesthesia may be used.\nCritical: Avoid anesthetizing multiple mice at once. Do not sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation as this may damage the trachea and affect the integrity of the BAL procedure.\nOnce the mouse is anesthetized, place it in a supine position.\nSoak the abdominal and thoracic regions with 70% ethanol to disinfect the area and prevent fur from attaching to surgical equipment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1942-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Use sterile gauze to clean the exposed trachea if any residual bleeding is observed. This clean up step is essential to minimize contamination of the BAL fluid with blood.\nNote: If the trachea remains unexposed after step 25, sharply dissect the tissues in the throat region to expose the intact trachea. Alternatively, in place of step 25, one may instead sharply dissect away the rib cage and throat tissue to reveal the intact trachea. However, this latter procedure is more time consuming, and you risk accidentally cutting the trachea.\nUsing forceps, grip the most superior part of the trachea, immediately inferior to the larynx (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nSharply dissect the trachea with surgical scissors superior to where the forceps are grasping the trachea (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nWhile holding the trachea with forceps, gently pull the trachea distally while cutting away any connective tissue that is revealed along the ribcage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L).\nContinue this process until the entire thoracic block is freed from the connective tissue and can be lifted cleanly out of the mouse (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]M).\nCritical: Proceed slowly. Pulling too hard or too quickly risks tearing the trachea or lung tissue which can compromise BAL recovery.\nPlace the thoracic block onto a piece of wax paper (e.g., from the packaging of a single-wrapped 1 mL syringe) so the trachea can be laid straight and flat along the paper (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1942-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(H) Lungs prior to, and after perfusion.\n(I) Lung tissue after mincing in 1.5mL collection tube.\nUsing forceps, pass the trachea through the loop of the prepared surgical suture (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nLoad a BAL needle with 250 μL of sterile, ice-cold PBS.\nWhile guiding the trachea with the forceps, insert the BAL needle into the opening of the trachea (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: Avoid the esophagus when cannulating. The trachea is distinguishable by the presence of cartilaginous rings. The needle should be positioned approximately halfway down the length of the trachea. The location of the needle can be visualized by lifting the needle up to determine the depth in the trachea (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Ensure the sharp, beveled end of the needle is entirely concealed by the polyethylene tubing to avoid puncturing the trachea.\nTighten the surgical suture around the trachea, where it overlaps with the metal shaft of the needle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nOnce the suture is tightened, securing the trachea to the BAL needle, check the depth of the needle in the trachea, and the alignment of the surgical suture such that it sits just below the opening of the trachea and on the metal shaft of the BAL needle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nForceps can aid in this process by holding the tracheal tissue in place.\nCritical: Tie the suture as tight as possible to ensure the trachea does not slip off the needle during the BAL procedure.\nConventional bronchoalveolar lavage.\nOnce the suture has been securely tightened around the trachea and BAL needle, lift the lungs off the wax paper with the syringe. Support the lungs so they are not freely hanging by placing a finger underneath the lungs (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).",
    "Hold the syringe in a vertical position such that the trachea is aligned with the needle (avoiding any visible kinks) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nGently depress the plunger of the syringe. The lung lobes should begin to inflate on both sides.\nThe angle of the BAL needle may need to be adjusted to ensure that both the left and right lobes inflate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nGently pull back on the syringe plunger to aspirate the instilled PBS. The lungs may be gently massaged while pulling back on the plunger to aid in lavage fluid retrieval.\nNote: Approximately 100–200 μL of the first 250 μL instillation of PBS is retrievable. If resistance is felt when pulling the plunger back, the positioning of the BAL needle may need to be adjusted. If so, place the lungs back down on the wax paper and gently readjust the BAL needle positioning. This may entail moving the needle back and forth to work around or through the blockage. Repeat steps 35–37.\nDetach the syringe from the BAL needle and eject the recovered volume into a 1.5 mL collection tube.\nWith the same syringe, aspirate an additional 200 μL of ice-cold PBS and reattach it to the BAL needle.\nRepeat steps 35–37 and eject the recovered volume into the same the 1.5 mL collection tube as used in step 38. Place the collection tube on ice.\nNote: A total recovery volume of 300–400 μL is expected after the first two instillations of PBS.\nExhaustive bronchoalveolar lavage.\nWith the same syringe that was used for conventional BAL in steps 35–37, aspirate 300 μL of ice-cold PBS and reattach it to the BAL needle.\nRepeat the BAL procedure as per steps 35–37 and eject the recovered volume into a fresh 1.5 mL collection tube.",
    "Repeat this BAL procedure with two additional instillations of 300 μL of ice-cold PBS each time. Eject the recovered volume into the same 1.5 mL collection tube as step 42 (900 μL total volume) and place the tube on ice.\nFollowing BAL, dissect the lung lobes with scissors and forceps and place the pieces into pre-labeled 1.5 mL lung collection tubes filled with 750 μL cell culture media and place the tube on ice.\nOptional: Prior to dissection of the lung lobes from the thoracic block, perfusion may be performed. Perfusion is performed by injecting 5 mL of ice-cold perfusion buffer into the right ventricle of the heart with a 23G needle. Successful perfusion should visibly blanch the lung tissue of red blood cells (RBC), with the tissue taking on a predominately white/translucent appearance (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nNote: Perfusion does not remove vascular-bound leukocytes. To properly differentiate vascular-restricted vs. bona fide parenchymal leukocytes, intravenous labelling is required, as described in (Anderson et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nIncubate samples on ice until all samples have been collected to maximize cell viability.\nProcessing of BAL fluid for downstream applications.\nNote: The above protocol separates the BAL fluid into conventional and exhaustive fractions. The conventional fragment is enriched in both soluble and cellular components, while the exhaustive fraction is primarily cellular components.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL collection tubes containing the conventional and exhaustive BAL fluid at 3,000 × g, 4°C, for 5 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge.\nAfter centrifugation, visualize the cell pellets. Transfer the supernatant from the conventional BAL fraction to a fresh 1.5 mL collection tube and store samples at −20°C.\nDecant the supernatant from exhaustive BAL fraction into liquid waste with a pipette.\nResuspend the cell pellet from the conventional BAL fraction in 200 μL of cell culture media.",
    "Combine this cell suspension with the cell pellet from the exhaustive BAL fraction and resuspend. Store samples on ice until required for downstream applications.\nEnumerate cells and determine viability by trypan blue staining.\nOn average, 3–5 × 105 cells are expected to be recovered from a naïve mouse.\nExperimental procedure #3: Lung mononuclear cell isolation\nThis section details how to process lung tissues for isolation of mononuclear cells for downstream flow cytometric analysis. Cells isolated by this method should retain greater than 95% viability and are suitable for other biological assays such as RNA isolation, ex vivo culture, etc.\nTiming: 2 h\nOnce all lung samples have been collected, mince the lung tissue into smaller pieces using surgical scissors in the 1.5 mL lung collection tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nNote: A standard drill-bit or bead-based tissue homogenizer will reduce sample viability; as such, tissue processing must be carried out manually.\nTransfer the minced tissue into a sterile 50 mL polypropylene tube.\nUsing a serological pipette, dispense 10 mL of lung digestion solution into the 50 mL polypropylene tube containing the minced lung tissue.\nMinced tissue that remains in the 1.5 mL tube can be rinsed out with lung digestion solution.\nIncubate samples in a 37°C shaking incubator at 225 rpm for 1 h.\nNote: If a shaking incubator is unavailable, the samples may be incubated at 37°C and manually swirled every 10–15 min for the duration of the incubation. Researchers must swirl carefully to minimize the amount of lung tissue that clings to the side of the polypropylene tube, which can prevent it from being fully submerged in lung digestion solution.\nFollowing incubation, pour samples through a 100 μm nylon mesh basket filter into a fresh sterile 50 mL polypropylene tube.",
    "Grind the digested tissue through the basket filter with the rubber end of a plunger from a 5 mL syringe.\nAs the tissue is ground through the filter, occasionally rinse the filter with ice-cold RPMI-1640 to wash cells through the filter.\nRepeat step 57 until all visible pieces of lung tissue have been ground through the filter.\nNote: Some fibrous tissue is expected to remain in the filter after this process. Researchers should use a separate filter for each sample to avoid clogging the filter.\nCentrifuge samples at 500 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, visualize the cell pellet, then decant the supernatant in one motion into a liquid waste container.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of RBC lysis solution. Once fully resuspended, add an additional 1 mL of RBC lysis solution to the sample.\nIncubate samples for 2 min at 18°C–25°C. Occasionally agitate samples by gently swirling the tubes.\nNote: Researchers should work quickly during RBC lysis. If multiple samples are being handled, dividing the workflow will ensure greater uniformity in lysis duration between samples.\nStop the lysis reaction by adding 40 mL of ice-cold PBS to each sample.\nFilter samples through a 100 μm nylon mesh basket filter into a new sterile 50 mL polypropylene tube. White/translucent fibrous tissue will be present in the filter.\nCentrifuge samples at 500 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, visualize the cell pellet, then decant the supernatant in one motion into a liquid waste container.\nLeave the tube momentarily inverted on a stack of low-particulate wipes to remove additional supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of complete cell culture media. Place samples on ice.\nEnumerate cells and determine viability by trypan blue staining.",
    "For downstream flow cytometric analysis, resuspend cells to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/mL. Cells are now ready for downstream utilization.\nImmunological procedure #1: Mononuclear cell phenotyping of tissue resident memory T cell responses\nThis section details the staining of BAL and lung mononuclear cells for identification of antigen-specific tissue resident memory (Trm) T cell responses by flow cytometry. The antibody cocktail described herein is a suggestion for canonical Trm markers using specific antibodies that we have experimentally proven to work. Researchers may need to adjust the panel as per experimental need. The staining workflow for Trm analysis is presented in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1942-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Staining strategy for identification of tissue resident memory T cell responses\n(A) Staining workflow.\n(B) Example plate layout.\nTiming: 3 h without stimulation, 9 h with stimulation\nMononuclear cell plating.\nAdd volume/concentration-adjusted BAL and lung mononuclear cells to a 96 well U-bottom plate. To ensure enough events can be collected on the flow cytometer for sufficient data resolution, researchers are encouraged to: (1) Plate 5 × 105–2 × 106 lung mononuclear cells, and (2) 3–5 × 105 BAL cells. Volume-adjust cells to 200 μL.\nNote: Lung mononuclear cells may be utilized for Fluorescence Minus One (FMO)/isotype controls. Researchers are encouraged to prepare these for each color to ensure proper quality control of positive population cut offs (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Unstained and color controls made from lung mononuclear cells can also be used for compensation of BAL samples.\nOptional: Peptide stimulation preparation.\nNote: Instead of including broad activation markers such as CD44 in the flow cytometry panel, researchers may choose to directly assess antigen-specific T cell responses. This can be achieved by stimulating mononuclear cells with peptide pools spanning the antigen-of-interest and subsequently probing for cytokine production such as interferon gamma (IFNγ).",
    "Preparation of peptide stimulants for assessing antigen-specific T cell responses is dependent on the researcher’s needs. In this protocol subsection, overlapping 15mer peptide libraries with 10 amino acid overlaps were commercially generated at a purity of greater than 70%. This approach allows for quantification of both CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cell responses and can be utilized for downstream epitope mapping studies. Stimulations are performed using peptide pools containing overlapping peptides spanning the antigen-of-interest. Stimulations are performed at a final concentration of 2 μg/mL for each peptide. In this protocol, stimulations are performed in 96 well U-bottom plates with a final stimulation volume of 200 μL. The following procedure should be carried out immediately after cell enumeration, and prior to any flow cytometry staining. [peptide pool stock]×(volume of peptide pool stock) = 2 μg/mL × 0.2 mL.\nPrepare stimulants at a final volume of 50 μL per condition with cell culture media.\nAdd volume/concentration-adjusted lung/BAL mononuclear cells to the 96 well U-bottom plate and mix with the stimulant.\nPrepare a working solution of Brefeldin A as per manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/en-ca/products/reagents/flow-cytometry-reagents/research-reagents/single-color-antibodies-ruo/protein-transport-inhibitor-containing-brefeldin-a.555029] such that a final volume of 50 μL is added per well with cell culture media.\nAdd the Brefeldin A working solution to the cell and stimulus mixture. Ensure the final volume of each well is 200 μL by adding more cell culture media as needed.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 6 h. Following incubation, proceed to step 70.\nNote: Ensure that the CD44 antibody is replaced with a color-compatible cytokine antibody detection cocktail. Gate on the cytokine positive population prior to assessing Trm markers.\nViability LIVE/DEAD staining protocol.\nCentrifuge the plated cells at 500 × g at 4°C for 5 min.",

    "Prepare the viability stain working solution in PBS as per manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/ca/en/home/references/protocols/cell-and-tissue-analysis/protocols/live-dead-fixable-dead-cell-stains.html]. Add 50 μL of the viability stain working solution to each well containing samples, except the unstained control (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]).\nIncubate the samples at 18°C–25°C for 20 min, protected from light.\nNote: For compensation, researchers may either prepare a cell color control stained with the viability dye (in this case, Aqua) or may utilize amine reactive beads (e.g., ArC amine reactive beads: Thermo Fisher Scientific cat# A10346).\nFollowing incubation, add 150 μL of ice-cold PBS to each well and centrifuge the plate at 500 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, visualize cell pellets then decant the supernatant by flicking the plate in one singular motion into a liquid waste container.\nLeave the plate momentarily inverted on a stack of low-particulate wipes to remove additional supernatant. Proceed immediately to the next staining step.\nFc Block staining protocol.\nPrepare the working dilution of Fc block and resuspend samples in 50 μL of the working dilution (Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\nIncubate samples for 15 min on ice, protected from light.\nFollowing incubation, add 150 μL of ice-cold FACS buffer to each well and centrifuge the plate at 500 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, visualize cell pellets then decant the supernatant by flicking the plate in one singular motion into a liquid waste container.\nLeave the plate momentarily inverted on a stack of low-particulate wipes to remove additional supernatant.\nExtracellular stain – Antigen-presenting cell (APC) Master Mix #1.\nPrepare APC Master Mix #1. Resuspend samples in 50 μL of APC Master Mix #1 (Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]). If your antibody staining cocktail contains >2 brilliant dyes, researchers should consider using the BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences Cat# 566349) during the staining as per manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/en-ca/products/reagents/flow-cytometry-reagents/research-reagents/buffers-and-supporting-reagents-ruo/brilliant-stain-buffer.563794].",
    "Note: Researchers are encouraged to generate FMO/isotype controls for all fluorochromes. These should be prepared at this step (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nIncubate samples for 30 min on ice, protected from light.\nFollowing incubation, add 150 μL of ice-cold FACS buffer to each well and centrifuge the plate at 500 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, visualize the cell pellets, then decant the supernatant.\nExtracellular stain – APC Master Mix #2.\nPrepare APC Master Mix #2. Resuspend samples in 50 μL of APC Master Mix #2 (Table 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl9]).\nNote: Researchers are encouraged to generate FMO/isotype controls for all fluorochromes.
