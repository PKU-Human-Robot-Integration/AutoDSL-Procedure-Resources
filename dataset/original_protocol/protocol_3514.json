    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCMT live imaging: prepare apex culture medium (ACM)\nTiming: ∼1 h\nMelt MS medium using a microwave. If the medium is freshly autoclaved, it can be used directly.\nAdd vitamins to the MS to a 1× final concentration.\nAdd BAP stock to a final concentration of 200 nM.\nMix gently and pour the medium into the Petri dishes (60 × 10 mm).\nNote: The MS medium should be cooled down to ∼50°C before adding the vitamins and BAP. Steps 2–4 should be carried out in a laminar hood. We recommend using the ACM immediately. ACM plates could also be stored at 4°C for 2–3 weeks.\nCMT live imaging: dissection\nTiming: ∼4–5 h\nChoose plants with inflorescences of about 2–3 cm high for further experiments (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nRemove the outer mature flowers as much as possible using tweezers. Cut the stem at ∼1 cm length to the tip, and insert the stem into ACM.\nDissect further using tweezers with extra fine tips, starting from the oldest flowers, removing the flowers one by one carefully until the floral stage you are interested in.\nMove the whole shoot apex to new ACM. Insert the stem into the ACM with an angle that makes the surface of the particular sepal primordium parallel to the medium surface (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C–1F).\nWhen finished, pour sterile water into the Petri dish and make sure the apex is under water. Rehydrate for around 10 min. Remove the water, seal the Petri dish, and move into a growth chamber for a recovery for 4 h or longer.",
    "To dissect the vegetative shoot apex, keep the entire plant with as many roots as possible. If the plants are grown in soil, they should be washed in tap-water before dissection. Old leaves should be cut off as clean as possible using the needle from a 1 mL insulin syringe (BD). In order to expose the very young leaf primordia (e.g., P1-P3), a fine dissection is carried out to remove the leaves covering the shoot apical meristem, using fine tweezers under the stereo microscope at high magnification.\nNote: When dissecting the flowers, the cutting should be at the basis of the pedicel as close to the stem as possible. To facilitate the cutting, the dissection can be performed under water by pouring sterile water into the Petri dish (from step 3 onward). The dissected shoot apex can be cultured for a long time in order to follow the growth and CMT dynamics (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F). For a video of the dissection process, refer to (Prunet, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCritical: Fine tweezers and a stereo microscope with high magnifications are absolutely necessary for a successful dissection. The recovery period is important for the visualization of CMTs and should be at least 4 h.\nCMT live imaging: staining the shoot apices (optional)\nTiming: ∼10 min\nStaining cell membrane with FM4-64\nDilute the FM4-64 stock solution to a final concentration of 0.33 mg/mL.\nUse a micropipette to apply 5 μL on the flower bud. Close the Petri dish and keep it in darkness for 5–10 min.\nRinse briefly with sterile water for two times.\nStaining cell wall with propidium iodide\nUse a micropipette to apply 5 μL propidium iodide solution. Keep the Petri dish in darkness for 5–10 min.\nRinse briefly with sterile water for two times.",
    "Note: The cortical microtubule signal is very dense at both the anticlinal and periclinal cell membranes. This property makes it easy to distinguish the cell contour. However, if large scale segmentation and quantification is required, staining the membrane or cell wall will be very helpful.\nCMT live imaging: acquisition\nTiming: 20–30 min\nPrepare the microscope\nWe use upright confocal microscope LSM 700 (Zeiss) equipped with water immersion objectives (W Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.0 DIC and/or W Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.0 M27) to image sepal primordia.\nClean the objectives with 70% ethanol before starting the experiments using lens paper (swipe method) or high-purity cotton applicator (swirl method).\nPosition the samples\nPour sterile water into the Petri dish and make sure the shoot apex is submerged.\nUse the pipette to blow away any air bubble on the shoot apex.\nPosition the Petri dish on the stage center (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). For the time-lapse imaging, it will be helpful to mark the front position on the Petri dish using a marker (optional).\nAcquisition\nUse transmission light to find the flower bud.\nSet up the pinhole size, laser power, gain, and offset. The detailed settings we used for CMT acquisition are listed below:\nAccording to the strength of signal, use lower laser power as much as possible (e.g., 2%–10% of 10 mW laser) to avoid photo-bleaching and sample damage.\nSet the pinhole size to 1 AU (Airy unit).\nFor optimal contrast and to avoid overexposure, we use the range indicator to set gain and offset. The ideal setting is that very few red points (overexposure noise) are in the preview image.",
    "We usually select the frame size as 1,024 × 1,024 which matches closely the diffraction-limited performance of the objectives. To precisely optimize the frame size, the user can also click the “optimal” button in the ZEN software for calculation of appropriate number of pixels. With these settings, our xy pixel dimensions are 114 μm.\nHigh scanning speed under line scanning mode with 3× averaging will increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nAcquire z stacks at 0.25–1 μm intervals. In our hands, z steps of 0.5 μm allow volumetric temporal resolution sufficient to capture CMT dynamics while also allowing reasonable 3D reconstruction in both periclinal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and anticlinal walls (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/434-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

(D) Double labeling of CMTs (green color) and nucleus (red color) in each cell by tubulin antibodies and DAPI, respectively. (E) The organization of CMTs in (D). Scale bars: 20 μm.\nAfter the acquisition, remove the water as much as possible, cover the Petri dish with lid, seal, and put the Petri dish back to the growth chamber.\nNote: Clean the objective before acquisition to make sure there is no contamination on the objective. 63× objective performs better in particular on small younger sepal primordia. During acquisition, avoid over-sampling in z steps to minimize the photo-bleaching.\nCritical: Avoid any air bubble between the objective and samples. Bubbles seriously degrade signal quality.\nCMT live imaging: image processing\n3D reconstruction",
    "To visualize the CMT network in 3D, we use the Zeiss software (ZEN, black edition), and choose the transparency rendering mode to visualize the signal at the sepal/leaf surface.\nSurface renderings can also be obtained using MERRYPROJ (de Reuille et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) or MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTo visualize the CMT organization in anticlinal walls, choose subset of stack using ZEN software, make a 3D reconstruction, and tilt the 3D image properly to show the anticlinal CMT networks.\nCMT anisotropy\nWe use Fiji plugin—FibrilTool to quantify CMT anisotropy. The detailed steps for the quantification can be obtained in (Boudaoud et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCMT immunostaining: tissue fixation\nTiming: ∼4–5 h\nPrepare fixative\nAdd 4 g paraformaldehyde to 80 mL MTSB. Dissolve by adding a few NaOH pellets (around 0.1–0.15 g) and using a magnetic stir bar.\nAdd 1 mL 50% glutaraldehyde. Adjust pH to 7.0 with H2SO4.\nAdd 300 μL Tween 20 and 300 μL Triton X-100. Mix well and fill up to 100 mL with MTSB.\nCritical: Fixative must be prepared freshly. Seal the fixative during and after the preparation since paraformaldehyde can evaporate and is toxic.\nTissue fixation\nDissect tomato shoot apices under a dissecting microscope.\nDig a hole in a 3% agar plate. Vertically insert a tomato shoot apex from the tissue culture medium.\nRemove leaves older than P3 using the needle from a 1 mL insulin syringe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nIncubate the dissected shoot apices in a 15 mL conical tube with 10 mL fixative.\nVacuum infiltrate at −0.075 MPa (550 mm Hg) for 10 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C). Repeat for a total of 3 times (3 × 10 min). Renew the fixative each time.\nIncubate in new fixative for an additional 3 h at room temperature (23°C–25°C) with the tube horizontally arranged.",
    "Discard the fixative. Incubate samples in MTSB for 20 min with the tube horizontally arranged. Repeat for a total of 3 times (3 × 20 min). Renew MTSB each time.\nNote: Do not include too many samples for fixation in one 15 mL conical tube. The volume of fixative should be at least 20 times of the volume of samples. Release the vacuum pump slowly to avoid any damage to plant tissues.\nCritical: Fixation must be performed at room temperature (23°C–25°C). CMTs depolymerize at low temperature.\nCMT immunostaining: tissue embedding and sectioning\nTiming: ∼3–4 h\nPrepare 6% low melting agarose\nAdd 1.8 g low melting agarose to 30 mL ddH2O. Heat to dissolve in a water bath at 96°C.\nStart to prepare low melting agarose 1 h before the end of tissue fixation. Cool down the melted agarose to ∼40°C before tissue embedding.\nTissue embedding\nPour fixed samples of tomato shoot apices into a 6 cm Petri dish together with MTSB.\nSet a hot plate to 37°C.\nPut a 44 × 44 × 7 mm (L × W × H) plastic weighing dish on the hot plate. Fill up with melted agarose (∼8–10 mL per plate).\nQuickly put samples into the melted agarose with tweezers, and adjust to the desired orientation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nWhen all samples are embedded, transfer the weighing dish to 4°C and leave for 15 min to let the agarose solidify.\nNote: Leave enough space among samples when you embed in agarose.\nCritical: Care should be taken during transferring the weighing dish to 4°C to avoid the movement of samples in agarose. Plant tissues embedded in agarose can be shortly stored in a sealed plastic bag at 4°C, but should go through subsequent steps in the same day.\nTissue sectioning",
    "Take a poly-L-lysine coated glass slide. Draw a circle on the slice using a PAP pen. Fill the circle with MTSB.\nCut a piece of solidified agarose containing an individual tomato shoot apex using a razor blade. Trim the agarose block to an appropriate size suitable for a vibratome (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nFix the agarose block onto the specimen disc with cyanoacrylate adhesive (e.g., 502 super glue). Also evenly apply adhesive to the vertical faces of the block. Fill the cooling bath with ice, and fill the buffer tray with 1× PBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nMake agarose sections of 40–50 μm thickness with sectioning speed at 0.65–0.78 mm/s (set SPEED value as 7–7.5 for a VT1000 S vibratome) and the sectioning frequency as 40 Hz (set FREQ value at 4 for a VT1000 S vibratome) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nPick up sections using a brush and load them into the MTSB in the PAP circle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nPut slides with sections in a humid box.\nNote: Wait a few seconds after drawing with the PAP pen to let the mark dry before adding MTSB. Otherwise, the ink of the PAP pen can mix with the buffer.\nNote: The size of PAP circle depends on the number and size of agarose sections that are collected. To collect multiple sections (e.g., successive sections from one individual sample) on one slide, rather draw the PAP-rectangles which can cover a larger area of the slide.\nNote: Sections are transparent, which makes them difficult to be seen in 1× PBS buffer. It is necessary to apply adhesive to the vertical faces of the block to make it visible. The cyanoacrylate adhesive is transparent when it is liquid, and becomes opaque after drying. It thus outlines the transparent section to make it visible in 1× PBS buffer.",
    "Critical: The PAP circle is hydrophobic, and serves as a holder of sections and liquid. It facilitates the replacement of different buffers in subsequent steps. To avoid evaporation, the slides must stay in a humid box.\nCMT immunostaining: primary antibody incubation\nTiming: 13–16 h\nCell permeabilization\nPrepare the enzymatic solution: 1% (w/v) hemicellulose with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in MTSB.\nReplace MTSB by the enzymatic solution in the PAP circle using a pipettor. Incubate sections in the enzymatic solution for 15 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C).\nIncubation with primary antibody\nRemove the enzymatic solution from the slices. Wash sections with 1× TBS three times for 5 min each by incubation without shaking.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution: mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody is diluted in 1× TBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA at 1:800 dilution.\nRemove 1× TBS from the slides and apply 200 μL primary antibody solution per slide. Incubate the slides in a humid box for overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.",
    "Note: Hemicellulose digests the cell wall, while Triton X-100 increases the permeabilization of the plasma membrane by removing membrane remnants and soluble proteins. Combination of hemicellulose and Triton X-100 treatments increase the penetrance of antibodies. The enzymes used for cell wall digestion and the duration of Triton X-100 treatment should be optimized according to the plant materials. To label CMTs in tomato leaf primordia, we found it was sufficient to treat the samples with 1% hemicellulose and 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. To label CMTs in Arabidopsis leaf primordia, samples should be treated with 1% hemicellulose, 0.1% Macerozyme R-10 and 1% Triton X-100 in MTSB for 15 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C), followed by 3 × 5 min wash in 1% Triton X-100 in MTSB. Including a step of cold-methanol treatment after enzymatic digestion can further increase the permeability of the cell wall and plasma membrane, and also facilitates the binding of antibodies (Shimamura, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: The enzymatic solution and primary antibody should be prepared freshly.\nCMT immunostaining: secondary antibody incubation\nTiming: ∼3 h\nIncubation with secondary antibody\nTransfer samples to room temperature (23°C–25°C). Remove primary antibody solution from the slides. Wash sections with 1× TBS three times for 10 min each by incubation without shaking.\nPrepare secondary antibody solution: Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG is diluted in 1× TBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA at 1:500 dilution.\nRemove 1× TBS from the slides and apply 200 μL secondary antibody solution per slide. Incubate the slides in a humid box for 2 h at 37°C in the dark.\nNuclei staining (optional)\nRemove secondary antibody solution from the slides. Wash sections with 1× TBS three times for 10 min each by incubation without shaking.",
    "Apply 200 μL 1 μg/mL DAPI per slide. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C) in the dark.\nCMT immunostaining: CLSM\nTiming: 2–3 h\nMounting\nRemove DAPI solution and incubate sections in 1× TBS for 10 min.\nRemove 1× TBS from the slices. Mount the slide with ProLong Gold (1.47 RI) antifade reagent. This mounting media both preserves fluorescence and provides near aberration-free imaging on oil immersion lenses. Cover the slide with a coverslip.\nCLSM\nCLSM is performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope with 60× oil objective. We used a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a Nikon Plan Apo VC 60×/1.40 oil objective. Due to DAPI’s broad emission, sequential acquisition of DAPI an Alexa Fluor 488 stacks is important to minimize bleed-through.\nTo detect Alexa Fluor 488 signal, a 488 nm laser line is used for excitation and emission is collected at 500–530 nm. The laser power is 10 mW. The pinhole size is 1.2 AU (30.7 μm).\nTo detect the DAPI signal, a 405 nm laser line is used for excitation and emission is collected at 425–475 nm. The laser power is 10 mW. The pinhole size is 1.2 AU (30.7 μm).\nSet the scanning step as 0.5 μm to collect more details of CMTs in each stack. Perform maxima z-projection of generated stacks to obtain the overall organization of CMTs in individual cells or the whole tissue section.\nNote: The amount of mounting medium (e.g., ProLong Gold antifade reagent) should be sufficient to fill the PAP circle. Care must be taken during loading the coverslip to avoid air bubbles which can interfere with the microscopy.",
    "Note: The use of oil objectives gives higher resolution of CMT organization than air or long distance water objectives due to their higher numerical aperture. For visualizing CMTs in Arabidopsis cells, it is better to use a 100× oil objective.\nCritical: Perform the microscopy immediately after mounting the slides. The antibody signal can fade away and CMTs may depolymerize gradually."
