    "1. Sample Preparation\nCut a small tissue block (about 3 mm x 3 mm x 5 mm) from the plant sample (e.g., a poplar stem).\nImmerse the tissue in boiling deionized water for 30 min. Immediately transfer it to deionized water at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Repeat this step until the tissue sinks to the bottom of the container, indicating that the air in tissue has been removed and that the tissue has softened.\n\tNote: For the samples that sink to the bottom prior to this step, generally repeat this cycle 3-5 times.\nPrepare 20, 50, 70, 90% (v/v) aliquots of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in deionized water, as well as pure PEG, and keep the solutions at 65 °C.\nIncubate the tissue in a series of graded PEG baths to displace the water and allow the PEG to infiltrate.\n\tNote: Typically, PEG with a molecular weight 2,000 (PEG2000) is used for embedding.\n\t\nProcess the tissue with graded PEG in a drying oven as follows: (a) 20% PEG for 1 h, (b) 50% PEG for 1.5 h, (c) 70% PEG for 2 h, (d) 90% PEG for 2 h, and (e) 100% PEG for 10 h.\nPre-warm a cassette at 65 °C in an oven. Pour the PEG containing the block into the cassette and then place the tissue block in a desired position using pre-warmed tweezers or needles.\nSlowly cool down the cassette and store the tissue at RT until use.\nDissect the PEG block containing the target tissue into a small block (about 1 cm x 1 cm x 2 cm) using a sharp razor blade and mount it on the microtome.\nCut thin sections from the PEG block (typically 3-10 µm).",
    "Rinse the section with deionized water in a watch glass 10 times to remove the PEG from the tissue.\nImmerse the sections with toluene/ethanol (2:1, v/v) for 6 h to remove the extractives. Prepare the reaction liquid by mixing 65 mL of deionized water, 0.5 mL of acetic acid, and 0.6 g of sodium chlorite in a beaker. Add one section and 3 mL of reaction liquid to a 5 mL vial. Screw on the top of the vial.\nHeat the vial in water bath at 75 °C for 2 h to remove the lignin of the tissue. Rinse the section with deionized water in a watch glass 10 times.\nTransfer the untreated/delignified section to a glass microscope slide. Unfold the section carefully using brushes or needles. Remove the extra deionized water with tissue paper.\nImmerse the section into D2O. Cover the sample with a glass cover slip. Seal the cover slip with nail polish to prevent the evaporation of the D2O.\n2. Spectral Acquisition\nOpen the instrument operating software of the confocal Raman microscope. Turn on the laser (wavelength = 532 nm), focus on the surface of the crystalline silicon with a 100X microscope objective, and click the calibration button to calibrate the instrument.\nSwitch the instrument to the optical microscope mode and turn on the microscope lamp. Mount the microscope slide on the stage, with the cover slip facing the objective.\nView the sample with a 20X microscope objective and locate the area of interest. Apply immersion oil to the coverslip and switch to the immersion microscope objective (60X, numerical aperture NA = 1.35). Focus on the surface of the sample.\nSwitch the instrument to the Raman testing mode and turn off the microscope lamp.",
    "Choose a mapping area by using a rectangular tool. Alter the step size to determine the number of obtained spectra.\n\tNote: Be aware of the step size (usually larger than the spot diameter calculated by the numerical aperture of the objective; theoretically 1.22λ/NA). Sizes below this will result in oversampling.\nSet the optimum spectral parameters to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral quality in an appropriate acquisition time (generally < 8 h), depending on the sample suitability. Generally, input the imaging parameters in the instrument software as follows: laser (532 nm), filter (100%), hole (300), slit (100), spectrometer (1,840 cm-1), grooves (1200t), objective (60X oil), and acquisition time (2 s).\nSave the spectral data before data processing and convert them to a universal format (e.g., TXT files).\n3. Data Analysis\nLoad the spectral data (TXT files) into the data analysis software (e.g., Matlab). Apply a noise-reduction technique on the data set to improve the SNR (e.g., the Savitzsky-Golay algorithm or the wavelet algorithm)\nUse untreated samples to produce the images of lignin and polysaccharides. For lignin imaging, consider the spectral peak around 1,600 cm-1 due to the aromatic ring symmetric stretching vibration. For polysaccharide imaging (including cellulose and hemicellulose), use the spectral peak around 2,889 cm-1 because of the CH and CH2 stretches.\nUse delignified samples to generate the images of cellulose and hemicellulose. Perform self-modeling curve resolution (SMCR) on the acquired spectra to discriminate the spectra of cellulose and hemicellulose and to image their distributions.\nPerform principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis on the acquired data to distinguish the Raman spectra from different cell wall layers.\nSubscription Required.
