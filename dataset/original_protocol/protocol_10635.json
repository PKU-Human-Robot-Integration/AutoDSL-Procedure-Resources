    "1. Cell Culture (Adapted from Fleming and Kaczmarek18)\nCulture cells in appropriate media for greater than 2 but less than 10 passages before use in this assay. Untransfected HEK-293 cells and HEK-293 cells stably expressing rat Slack-B protein are grown in one half Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium and one half Leibovitz's L-15 Medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 500 µg/ml Geneticin (G418) is added to HEK-293 cells stably expressing Slack-B to select for expression of the Slack channel. Passage cells at 70-90% confluence by dissociation from dishes with a 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution.\n2. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Coating of the TiO2 384-well Optical Biosensor Plate with Fibronectin and Ovalbumin\nPreparation of the fibronectin ECM mixture and ovalbumin blocking solution\n\t\nPrepare a working solution of fibronectin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with a final concentration of 5 µg/ml of fibronectin in 20.0 ml PBS. From a 1.0 mg/ml stock concentration, add 100 µl to 20.0 ml PBS for a 200-fold dilution. The working solution of fibronectin can be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C after preparation.\nPrepare a 5% stock solution of heat-inactivated ovalbumin in sterile water. Dilute ovalbumin in sterile tissue culture grade water for a 5% solution and heat-inactivate for 30 min at 60 °C. Cool the solution to room temperature and sterile filter the solution. Aliquot the 5% ovalbumin solution and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare a 2% working solution of ovalbumin by diluting the 5% stock solution into PBS. For example, add 12.0 ml of 5% ovalbumin stock solution to 18.0 ml of PBS for a final volume of 30.0 ml.\n384-well optical biosensor plate coating\n\t\nHydrate the TiO2 plate with 20.0 µl/well of sterile tissue culture grade water for 15 min. The following steps should be performed with a 16-channel pipettor.",
    "Wash plate 1x with 50.0 µl PBS per well.\nAdd 20.0 µl of the fibronectin working solution to each well and incubate for 2 hr at room temperature to create the ECM.\nWash plate 1x with 50.0 µl PBS per well.\nAdd 40.0 µl of the ovalbumin working solution to each well and incubate overnight at 4 °C to block the plate.\nWash plate 3x with 50.0 µl PBS per well. ECM coated plates can be stored at 4 °C for up to 48 hr.\n3. Seeding of Cells onto the 384-well Optical Biosensor Plate\nRemove growth media from the cells and add trypsin to dislodge the cells from the plate. Collect the cells and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 1 min. Remove the trypsin media and resuspend cells in growth media.\nUsing a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter, determine the concentration of the cells.\nTo minimize the effects of evaporation during incubation, 50.0 µl of growth medium per well will be used. Cells should be diluted to achieve the desired number of cells per well in a volume of 50.0 µl of growth medium. For these experiments, 1,000 cells/well were plated onto the biosensor.\nAllow the seeded cells to incubate overnight in growth medium at 37 °C under air/5% CO2.\n4. Preparation of the Biosensor and Compound Plates for the RWG Optical Biosensor Assay\nRemove the plate from the incubator and remove growth media from the cells. Wash the cells 1x with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Add 25.0 µl of HBSS to each well.\nPlace the biosensor plate on the BIND Scanner and allow the cells to equilibrate to room temperature for 1-2 hr.",
    "Prepare a separate compound plate from which ligands of interest will be added to the biosensor plate during the assay. For these assays, 25.0 µl of solution containing compound was added to each well on the biosensor plate for a total volume of 50.0 µl. As such, compounds in solution were prepared in 2x the desired final concentration.\n5. Perform the RWG Optical Biosensor Assay\nTake a baseline measurement with the Scanner system for wells A1-P12 (half of the SBS 384-well plate) using a maximum resolution of 3.75 µm/pixel for the central 1.5 mm of each well using the BIND Scan software . This baseline scan will take approximately 30 min.\nAdd 25.0 µl of the compound solutions to each well for wells A1-P12.\nTake a baseline measurement of wells A13-P24.\nAdd 25.0 µl of the compound solutions to each well for wells A13-P24.\nTake a post compound addition measurement for wells A1-P12, and repeat for wells A13-P24.\n6. Analysis of Assay Data with BIND View\nOpen the BIND assay data for the baseline measurement in Windows, and click the \"Grid Editor\" button to enable cell selection. The software will calculate metrics of interest defined by the user.\nOpen the \"Plug-ins\", which include the \"Cell Finder\" and \"Baseliner\" function. Set parameters in \"Cell Finder\" so that cells are distinguishable from the background of the biosensor.\nExport the cell map file which contains the \"Cell Finder\" data for the baseline measurement.\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.2 for post compound addition data.\nOpen the \"Baseliner\" plug-in and import the cell map from the baseline measurement. The software will calculate the shift in PWV between the background and post compound data.",
    "Select \"Δ Cell Mean\" for the output of the mean shift in PWV for cells. The data can then be exported to Microsoft Excel for further analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
