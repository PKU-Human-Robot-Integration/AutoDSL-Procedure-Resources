    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHydrate Agilent Seahorse XFe24 sensor cartridge with XF calibrant\nTiming: 10 min\nDiscard the water from the utility plate prepared previously and fill each well with 1 mL pre-warmed XF calibrant prepared the day before.\nPlace the sensor cartridge utility plate in a non-CO2 37°C incubator for 45–60 min.\nPreparation of aCSF with different substrates\nTiming: 30 min\nFreshly add fatty acid-free BSA to previously made aCSF (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) to a final concentration of 4 g/L. Then prepare 200 mL aCSF-glucose and 500 mL aCSF-sucrose by dissolving glucose or sucrose in aCSF (with BSA) to a final concentration of 10 mM glucose or 10 mM sucrose, respectively. Adjust pH to 7.4 using 1 M NaOH.\nCritical: When assessing fatty acid-induced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in brain slices, aCSF-sucrose (aglycemic condition) has to be used to minimize the interference of glucose in the medium. Similarly, for glycolytic activity assessment, Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) values at aglycemic condition (aCSF-sucrose) will be used as the baseline representing glucose-independent pH changes. aCSF-glucose (glycemic condition) will be used to determine glucose-induced OCR and ECAR. Substrate-free aCSF (no glucose or sucrose) can be prepared and stored at 4°C for up to 4 weeks (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). BSA, glucose or sucrose must be added freshly on the day of experiment.\nVibratome setup\nTiming: 5 min\nPlace a new razor blade in the clamp and fill the vibratome tray with pH 7.4 aCSF-sucrose and set the temperature to 4°C. Adjust the sectioning parameters as follows (Leica VT 1200S): section thickness: 250 μm; cutting speed: 0.20 mm/s; cutting amplitude: 1.50 mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/677-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(C) Dap the bottom surface of the brain gently with paper towel to remove excess liquid before mount the brain onto the specimen plate.\n(D) A supporting piece of agarose block is added behind the brain to provide structural support during sectioning.\n(E) Sectioning a brain.\n(F) Collect brain slice containing the region of interest from the buffer tray of the vibratome to a petri dish prefilled with aCSF-sucrose using a transfer pipet.\nBrain dissection\nTiming: 5 min\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dissociation.\nOptional: Anesthesia of mice by isoflurane in an anesthetizing chamber before dissection is optional and should be used with caution, because anesthesia is known to affect brain metabolism.\nCritical: If anesthesia is used, isoflurane should be handled in a fume hood and the exposure time of mice to isoflurane should be minimized.\nDecapitate mouse and dissected the brain rapidly from the skull.\nTransfer the brain onto phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-soaked paper towel placed in a petri dish on ice. Remove the cerebellum and brain stem (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), put the remaining brain into a 50 mL beaker containing ice-cold aCSF-sucrose.\nCritical: Brain should be rapidly collected within 30 s–60 s of decapitation.\nVibratome sectioning\nTiming: 30 min (per mouse brain)\nTape the center of specimen plate and place a small dot of superglue in the center of the tape.\nNote: The use of lab tape greatly helps the cleaning of the specimen plate afterwards.\nTake out the brain from aCSF-sucrose from step 7 with forceps and dap the dorsum of the brain gently with paper towel to remove excess buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Carefully place the brain on the superglue (dorsum down), then slide a stabilizing agarose block to the ventral side of the brain (opposite to the blade side) to provide structural support during slicing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Note: Remove excess buffer with paper towel will help the brain stick more firmly to the specimen plate.\nMount and orient the specimen plate to make sure the dorsal side of the brain faces the blade.\nSet the cutting window to define the start and stop positions of the slicing. Make sure the blade cut completely through the tissue so slices will come off freely.\nAdjust the position of the buffer tray until the razor blade is in the cutting place. Start sectioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIdentify and transfer brain slices that contain the region of interest from the buffer tray to a 100 mm petri dish prefilled with 37°C aCSF-sucrose using a transfer pipet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCritical: Using this protocol, brain slices can maintain their metabolic stability for about 7–8 h after sectioning. The entire procedure needs to be completed within this time frame.\nPreparation of brain punches and transfer to seahorse plate\nTiming: 30 min\nPlace the mesh inserts of the Seahorse XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate in a 100 mm petri dish containing fresh 37°C aCSF-sucrose, make sure the mesh inserts are completely immersed in the liquid without any bubble under the mesh.\nCritical: XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate rather than the standard XFe24 cell culture microplate should be used. The XFe Islet Capture Microplate contains depressed chamber and mesh that will help hold the brain punches in place at the center of each well throughout the measurement.\nAdd 700 μL per well 37°C aCSF-sucrose to half of the XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate wells for aglycemic condition and add aCSF-glucose to the other half of wells for glycemic condition.\nPosition 1 mm stainless steel biopsy puncher over the area of interest on the brain section from step 13 and press down (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/677-Fig3.jpg",

Slice punch preparation and transfer\n(A) Lower 1 mm stainless steel biopsy puncher into the petri dish and press gently overtop the region of interest of the brain slice.\n(B) Brain slice after punch collection of the dentate gyrus of both hemispheres.\n(C) Eject the punched piece into a well of XFe Islet Capture Microplate directly and adjust the brain punches to make sure it’s located in the center of each well using the biopsy puncher.\nCritical: Mechanical damages to the brain tissue during biopsy and transfer can substantially affect tissue respiration. It is recommended to only use brain punches without damage.\nExpel each punch (1mm diameter) into one well of XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate and adjust the position of brain punch using biopsy puncher to make sure it is located in the center of each well (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Each punch should be submerged in the liquid and centered at the bottom of the wells.\nCritical: Do not place brain punches into the four background correction wells (A1, B4, C3, and D6) in the XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/677-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Layout of XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate and insertion of the mesh insert\n(A) Four background correction wells (A1, B4, C3, and D6) in the XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate should contain aCSF only (no punches).\n(B) Gently place the mesh inserts into each well of the XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate with fine-tipped tweezers above the punch to hold the latter in the center of each well.\nPlace the mesh inserts into each well of the XF Islet Capture Microplate with fine-tipped tweezers which will help keep the brain punches in the center of each well throughout the experiment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Incubate the XF Islet Capture Microplate with punches in a 37°C incubator without CO2 for 1 h to allow temperature and pH equilibration.\nMetabolic profiling by seahorse XFe24 analyzer\nTiming: 5 h\nPrepare injection solutions of BSA-oleate (1.65 mM), oligomycin A (240 μg/mL), FCCP (130 μM) and antimycin A (280 μM) by diluting their stock solutions (prepared as in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) using either aCSF-sucrose or aCSF-glucose (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]), corresponding to aglycemic or glycemic conditions assigned in step 15.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_677_3.csv\nLoad the hydrated sensory cartridge (from step 2) ports with 70 μL of 1.65 mM BSA-oleate in port A, 70 μL of 240 μg/mL oligomycin A in port B, 70 μL of 130 μM FCCP in port C, and 70 μL of 280 μM Antimycin A in port D using a 200 μL pipette and reagent reservoir (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_677_4.csv\nCritical: aCSF-sucrose should be used to prepare the injection solutions of substrates and inhibitors for aglycemic conditions. In parallel, for glycemic conditions, aCSF-glucose should be used as diluent of injection solutions.\nSet up the Seahorse XFe24 program as follows: baseline, 4 cycles; inject port A (BSA-oleate), 5 cycles; inject port B (oligomycin), 6 cycles; inject port C (FCCP), 5 cycles; inject port D (Antimycin A), 15 cycles. Each cycle is composed of mix 3 min, wait 3 min, and measure 2 min (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_677_5.csv\nNote: Comparing to cellular XF assays, it takes longer time for brain slices to reach stable OCR after oligomycin- and antimycin A injections (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Additional cycles are thus needed for measurements after oligomycin (6 cycles) and after antimycin A (15 cycles). However, depending on whether proton leak-related OCR (after oligomycin) and non-mitochondrial OCR (after antimycin A) is of interest, the cycle numbers for these steps can be adjusted.",
    "Place the utility plate with the loaded sensor cartridge into the XFe24 instrument tray and start the calibration step, which takes approximately 20 min.\nAfter calibration is completed, replace the utility plate with the XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate with brain punches prepared in step 18 and start the XF assay. Assay duration is around 5 h."
