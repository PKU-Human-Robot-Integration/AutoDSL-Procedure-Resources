Tri-transfection of HEK293T Cells\nNOTE: Please refer to Table 1 for the composition of the buffers and solutions used in the protocol.\nNOTE: Performance of this section of the protocol takes approximately 4 days.\nThaw a vial of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells in a water bath set at 37 °C.\nNOTE: Use only cells that have been passaged less than 20x to guarantee optimal transfection efficiency.\nSeed HEK293T cells at a density of 2 x 103 to 6 x 103 cells/cm2 in DMEM10 in 15 cm diameter cell culture dishes.\nGrow the cells to 70–80% confluence in a standard incubator set at 37 °C, with 95% humidity and 5% CO2.\nNOTE: The production of one batch of AAV vectors using this protocol requires 18 cell culture dishes (15 cm diameter). A cell confluence of 70% - 80% corresponds to 6 x 103 to 7 x 103 cells/cm2, maintained in 17–20 mL of DMEM10 culture medium.\nPrepare polyethylenimine (PEI)/DNA mix at a concentration ratio of 1/3.5 (w/w).\nPrepare the DNA mix for 18 cell culture dishes in one 50 mL conical tube by mixing 360 µg of pΔF6, 180 µg of pCapsid, and 180 µg of pTransgene in 18 mL of 150 mM NaCl.\nDistribute the DNA mix over three 50 mL conical tubes (6 mL of DNA mix per conical tube).",
    "Prepare the PEI mix for six cell culture dishes in a new 50 mL conical tube by mixing 840 µg of PEI (1 µg/µL) in 6 mL of 150 mM NaCl.\nPrepare the PEI/DNA mix by adding 6 mL of the PEI mix (prepared in step 1.4.3), drop by drop, to one of the conical tubes containing the DNA mix (prepared in step 1.4.2) and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nNOTE: After 20 min of incubation, the PEI/DNA mix will become slightly turbid.\nTake six cell culture dishes out of the incubator and completely aspirate the medium from each culture dish in a laminar flow hood. Remove the traces of the medium by rinsing the dishes with 5 mL of prewarmed Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS).\nEnsure the distribution of DPBS over the entire surface by gently tilting the dish.\nGently aspirate the DPBS and add 12 mL of DMEM1 to each dish.\nNOTE: Avoid detaching the cells by adding the medium slowly, from a pipette placed at the edge of the dish.\nMix the PEI/DNA by pipetting up and down 3x - 5x. Add 2 mL of the PEI/DNA mix to each of the six cell culture dishes in a drop-by-drop fashion, carefully distributing it over the entire surface. Once the mix is added to each dish, place the dishes back in the incubator. Repeat steps 1.4.3– 1.8 for the remaining culture dishes.\nIncubate the transfected cells for 5 h at 37 °C, with 95% humidity and 5% CO2.\nAdd an additional 12 mL of DMEM10 to each culture dish without removing the pre-existing medium (total medium volume = 25 mL).\nIncubate the transfected cells up to 72 h post-transfection at 37 °C, with 95% humidity and 5% CO2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58960/58960sfig1.jpg",

Use a cell scraper to carefully detach the cells from the culture dish. Collect the medium and the cells in a 50 mL conical tube kept on ice.\nNOTE: The contents of two cell culture dishes can be collected into a single 50 mL conical tube. At the end of this step, each of the nine tubes will contain approximately 50 mL of medium.\nCentrifuge the conical tubes at 420 x g for 10 min at 4 °C with the acceleration and deceleration of the centrifuge set to maximum.\nCarefully discard the supernatant from each tube. Do not use pipettes to prevent the loss of material. Instead, gently pour the supernatant into a waste disposal container and place the tubes containing the cell pellets back on the ice.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 2 mL of lysis buffer directly in the 50 mL conical tube by pipetting up and down 5–10x. Do not vortex. Pool the lysates from three tubes together.\nNOTE: At this point, there will be three 50 mL conical tubes, each one containing 6 mL of the resuspended cells in lysis buffer.\n2. AAV Vector Purification\nNOTE: Performance of this protocol section takes approximately 1 day. Perform the following steps simultaneously on each of the three 50 mL conical tubes containing the cells resuspended in lysis buffer (see the previous note).",
    "Freeze and thaw the resuspended cells 3x to lyse them and release the AAV particles. Perform the freezing step by placing the tubes in a bucket containing dry ice mixed with ethanol. Perform thawing by immediately placing the cells in a water bath set at 37 °C.\nAfter the third thawing step, centrifuge at 1,167 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nNOTE: A noticeable pellet composed of cell debris will be formed. When handling the tubes, avoid sudden movements as these can cause the detachment of the pellet into the supernatant, which will compromise the purity of the final vector.\nCarefully transfer the supernatants to clean 50 mL conical tubes and then add nuclease to each tube, to a final concentration of 50 U/mL supernatant.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Swirl the 50 mL conical tubes by hand every 10 min to ensure that the nuclease is thoroughly mixed with the supernatant.\nClarify the supernatant by centrifugation at 13,490 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nAttach a 0.45 µm filter to a 10 mL syringe and place it on top of a clean 50 mL conical tube. Carefully remove the plunger and fill the syringe with the supernatant from step 2.5.\nUse the plunger to force the lysate through the filter. Use a new filter and syringe for each tube of supernatant obtained in step 2.5.\nNOTE: The obtained fraction is known as ‘crude lysate’.\nPrepare each of the 15%, 25%, 40%, and 60% iodixanol fractions in four separate 50 mL conical tubes, according to the instructions in Table 1.",
    "Prepare the iodixanol gradients in three ultracentrifugation tubes using the following order of iodixanol fractions: 8 mL of 15% iodixanol, 5.5 mL of 25% iodixanol, 5 mL of 40% iodixanol, and 4.5 mL of 60% iodixanol.\nCAUTION: Iodixanol can cause irritation to eyes, skin, and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. When handling iodixanol gradients, wear gloves and work under a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nPipette 8 mL of 15% iodixanol into each ultracentrifugation tube.\nPipette 5.5 mL of 25% iodixanol solution into a clean 50 mL conical tube (Figure 1A).\nUse a non-graduated Pasteur pipette (as the neck of the ultracentrifugation tube is too narrow for conventional graduated pipettes) to carefully layer 5.5 mL of the 25% iodixanol solution below the 15% iodixanol solution (Figure 1B).\nNOTE: This can be successfully achieved by adding the iodixanol in three steps since the Pasteur pipette can only hold around 2 mL.\nAdd the 40% and 60% iodixanol solutions as described in step 2.9.3. Do not disturb the different iodixanol interfaces during layering.\nNOTE: The proper preparation of the different iodixanol fractions can be ensured by visual confirmation thanks to the phenol red added to the iodixanol fractions (see the instructions in Table 1). Since each fraction has a specific density, they will not intermix during the layering step, if it is performed properly (check Figure 1C).\nLayer the crude lysate on top of the 15% iodixanol gradient with a Pasteur pipette. Proceed drop by drop to avoid disturbing the interface between the crude lysate and the iodixanol solution.\nFill the ultracentrifugation tube up with lysis buffer until the meniscus reaches the base of the tube neck to ensure the tube does not collapse under the very high forces generated during the ultracentrifugation (Figure 1C).",
    "Close the ultracentrifugation tubes using appropriate lids. Use a digital scale to make sure all three ultracentrifugation tubes have the same weight. Adjust the weight, if necessary, by adding more lysis buffer on top of the ‘crude lysate’.\nNOTE: The weight difference between the ultracentrifugation tubes must be below 0.1 g to ensure the safe operation of the ultracentrifuge. Ultracentrifuges are potentially dangerous pieces of equipment and should only be used by properly trained personnel.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 301,580 x g, using a fixed-angle titanium rotor, for 1 h and 40 min at 12 °C, using maximum speed of acceleration and deceleration.\nCarefully insert a stainless-steel blunt needle at the 40% and 60% iodixanol interface.\nAttach the needle to a 5 mL syringe (Figure 1E).\nAspirate only the clear fraction, containing the vector particles.\nNOTE: The total volume collected is approximately 2.5–3 mL. Avoid the collection of material from the 25–40% interface, since this will increase the level of contamination in the final vector batch, due to the presence of non-desirable proteins.\nProcess the collected fraction (desalting and concentration) or store it overnight at 4 °C.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58960/58960fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Setup for iodixanol gradient purification and subsequent vector collection. (A) Before pipetting the different iodixanol gradients into the ultracentrifugation tube, pipette an adequate volume of each iodixanol solution into a separate conical tube. (B) Then use a Pasteur pipette to sequentially transfer each iodixanol solution to the ultracentrifugation tube: layers of an increasingly high iodixanol concentration should be added at the bottom of the tube underneath the previous layer(s). (C) Layer the crude vector lysate on top once the gradient has been prepared. This vector collection system does not use sharp needles, which present a risk of 'needlestick' injuries.

Desalting and Concentration of the AAV Vector\nNOTE: Performance of this section of the protocol takes approximately 2 h.\nPrerinse the filter membrane of the centrifugal filter by adding 5 mL of 1x PBS-MK and centrifuge for 5 min at 4,000 x g.\nAdd 5 mL of 1x PBS-MK to the collected AAV vector fraction, mix and then add the total volume to the filter. Upon addition of 1x PBS-MK, turbidity is observed. Centrifuge at 4,000 x g until the volume present on the cone-shaped filter has been reduced to 1 mL. Discard the flow-through accumulated in the outer collection tube.\nAdd 13 mL of 1x PBS-MK to the cone-shaped filter and repeat the centrifugation step as many times as necessary (minimum 3x), until there is no more turbidity observed when fresh 1x PBS-MK is added.",
    "In the final wash step, add 13 mL of PBS + 0.01% (v/v) non-ionic surfactant and centrifuge at 4,000 x g until the volume is reduced to 300–350 µL.\nCollect the remaining fraction present on the filter by pipetting the whole volume into a sterile skirted microcentrifuge tube.\nNOTE: This fraction contains the desalted and concentrated AAV vector. In the following steps of this protocol, this fraction is referred to as the ‘primary’ fraction. Make sure to handle the tube under the hood and store it at 4 °C.\nRinse the filter with 200 µL of 1x PBS-MK to collect the residual vector particles retained on the filter. Collect in a sterile microcentrifuge tube.\nNOTE: This is a diluted vector stock, which may be suitable for some applications requiring lower vector titers. In future steps, this fraction is referred to as the ‘secondary’ fraction.\nFor short-term storage, store the vector fraction(s) at 4 °C (less than 2 weeks). Aliquot and store the vector at ‑20 °C when long-term storage is required.\nPerform quality control as described in section 4.\n4.

    "Check the efficiency of the restriction digestion by running the linearized plasmid on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel at 100 V for 1 h. Complete digestion of the plasmid should produce a single fragment of defined size.\nPurify the linear plasmid DNA using a PCR purification kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions24, and measure the DNA concentration with a spectrophotometer by measuring the absorption at 260 nm. After the titration, store the remaining aliquot of the linear plasmid at ‑20 °C for further use.\nCalculate the molecules (i.e. DNA copies) of the plasmid stock per microliter as follows.\n\t\t\nFirst, calculate the molecular weight of the plasmid. Assuming that the average weight of a DNA base pair (bp) is 650 Daltons (Da) and that one mole of a bp weighs 650 g, the molecular weight of any double-stranded DNA template can be estimated by taking the product of its length (in bp) and weight per base pair.\n\t\t\t​Plasmid molecular weight [g/mol] = plasmid size [bp] x 650 [Da/bp]\nNext, calculate the number of moles of plasmid per microliter.\n\t\t\tMoles of plasmid per microliter = plasmid concentration [g/µL] / plasmid molecular weight [g/mol]\n​NOTE: The inverse of the molecular weight is the number of moles of plasmid present in 1 g of the material.\nThen, calculate the number of plasmid molecules per microliter, using Avogadro’s number (6.022 x 1023 molecules/mole).\n\t\t\tMolecules of plasmid per microliter = moles of plasmid per microliter [moles/µL] x Avogadro’s number [molecules/mole]\nFinally, dilute the plasmid stock (molecules/µL) to obtain a 100 µL solution with the desired concentration of 1 x 109 molecules (vector genomes (vg) per microliter).\n\t\t\tPlasmid stock (100 µL) = (desired concentration [molecules/µL] x 100 µL) / plasmid molecules [molecules/µL]\nMake serial dilutions of the plasmid stock (1 x 109 vg/µL) in triplicates:",

It also presents a fire risk. Handle with care.\nWait for the gel to polymerize and then pour off the butanol. Tip: Check to see whether the excess gel mix in the tube has solidified. Polymerization occurs in less than 20 min. Wash the surface of the gel with H2O and then dry it using paper towels, taking care not to disturb the surface of the gel.\nAdd TEMED and 10% (w/v) APS to the stacking gel and pour the gel into the gel holder on top of the separating gel.\nPlace the provided comb in the gel. Perform this action with one steady movement to avoid the formation of air bubbles inside the wells.\nWait for at least 20 min for the gel to polymerize. Tip: Check if the excess gel mix in the conical tube has solidified.",
    "Prepare the two mixes (Table 7) for both the primary and the secondary AAV vector fractions (steps 3.5 and 3.6, respectively).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n,High Amount,Low Amount\nAAV vector stock,5 µL,1 µL\n5x Sample buffer,3 µL,3 µL\nH2O,7 µL,11 µL\nTable 7: Composition of the sample mixes required for silver staining.\nFully denature the sample mixes by heating them for 5 min at 95 °C. Assemble the electrophoresis tank, paying attention to the electrode orientation.\nFill the tank with 1x cathode buffer on the inside of the electrode assembly and 1x anode buffer on the outside.\n\tNOTE: Anode buffer can be recycled from run-to-run. Fresh cathode buffer must always be used.\nRemove the comb from the gel and clean the wells of the gel with 1x cathode buffer.\nLoad 1 µL of protein ladder in a well. Load the sample mixes in different wells on the same gel (Figure 3). Run the gel at 50 V until the samples enter the resolving gel. Then increase the voltage to 100 V until the dye front reaches the lower limit of the gel.\nExtract the gel carefully from the glass plates and use the silver staining kit (according to the manufacturer’s instructions26) to visualize the viral proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3 subunits) that comprise the AAV capsid, as well as to check for possible protein contamination (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58960/58960fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Evaluation of vector purity using SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Using a Tricine-SDS gel, 5 µL of various vector preparations were separated. Proteins were subsequently detected by silver staining. Vectors are considered pure when VP1 (82 kDa), VP2 (67 kDa), and VP3 (60 kDa) are visible in a 1:1:10 ratio (lane 1), without excessive background (lane 2) or non-specific bands (lane 3).
