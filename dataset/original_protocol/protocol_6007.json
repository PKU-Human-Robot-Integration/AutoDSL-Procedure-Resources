  "procedures": [
    "The protocol requires 20 ml of Synechocystis PCC 6803 grown at 30 °C on an orbital shaker (about 60 rpm) under cool white fluorescent light of 35 μmol m-2 s-1 in liquid BG11 (Rippka et al., 1979) with an optical density of ~0.4-0.6 at 750 nm (see Notes). Collect the cyanobacterial cells by centrifugation at 2,300 x g for 10 min at ~4 °C, resuspend the cell pellet in 1.5 ml of Buffer B and transfer the resuspended cells into a 2 ml screw cap microtube. From this point keep the tubes on ice.Centrifuge the tube in the microcentrifuge at 9,300 x g for 2 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.15 ml of Buffer B and add the same volume of glass beads (measured separately in a graduated 0.5 ml microtube and added to the 2 ml microtube with the sample).Break the cells with three cycles of 20 s beating (max. speed) and 1 min cooling in a Mini-Beadbeater.Add 0.2 ml of Buffer B, vortex the tube for 2 s and immediately transfer the supernatant into a new pre-cooled 2 ml screw cap microtube, repeat five times.Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 1 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and glass beads.Transfer the supernatant into a new pre-cooled 2 ml screw cap microvial and centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.2 ml of Buffer B using a stainless-steel piston from a 0.",
    "25 ml microsyringe (length 120 mm, diameter 2 mm): hold the tube with the pellet after removal of the supernatant in one and piston in the second hand, insert the piston into the tube down to the bottom and vortex for 15 s with inserted piston, then add 0.2 ml of the buffer and vortex again with piston inside for 10 s.Measure the chlorophyll (Chl) content in the suspension. Mix 13.5 µl of suspension with 1.5 µl of 10% DM, centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 5 min, take 10 µl of the supernatant and add to 990 µl of methanol in a screw cap microvial, vortex, centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 5 min, take the supernatant and measure absorbance at 720 and 666 nm, C (μg Chl/ml) = (A666 - A720) x 1,269 (Wellburn, 1994).Prepare the resolving gel (see Video 1). First assemble the gel cassettes from glass plates and 1 mm spacer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then mix all components well (except for APS!) for each 4% and 14% resolving gel solution using magnetic stirrers and stirring bars (components of each solution are shown in Recipe 8, one column is one solution, the second and third column); then add APS to both solutions under constant mild stirring. Pour the 4% solution together with stirring bar into the right compartment of the gradient maker located on the top of the magnetic stirrer. The gradient maker has an inlet attached to the silicone tube leading to the peristaltic pump and has a closed connecting channel to the second compartment. The outlet of the peristaltic pump is connected to the hypodermic needle attached to the upper part of the glass gel cassette using a binder clip.",
    "Carefully open the connecting channel just enough to fill it with the 4% solution (if more solution is released, pipette it back to the right compartment) and close it again, and add now the 14% solution into the second (left) compartment of the gradient maker. Remove 8.5 ml of the 14% solution with a pipette and add it directly to the bottom of the glass cassette for gel polymerization and immediately start pumping the remaining solution with a rate of about 10 ml per minute into the glass cassette and in parallel open the connecting channel between the compartments of the maker. Adjust mild stirring of the solution (2 turns per second). After pouring the gradient, remove the needle, overlay the solution in the gel cassette with 0.5 ml of distilled water using a 0.25 ml syringe and wash the gradient maker and tubings with Milli-Q water. Watch the interface between the water and 4% solution until a clear border is formed and then remove the water with the syringe. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Pouring the resolving gel Prepare the stacking gel. Add APS to the 10 ml 4% solution (right column in Recipe 8), pour to the top of the polymerized resolving gel, immerse the 10 well comb avoiding air bubbles and wait for polymerization; afterwards remove the comb and wash the wells with Milli-Q water.Attach the prepared gels into the cooling core, check if the connection is tight and not leaking with distilled water, pour out water and insert the core with gels into the electrophoresis chamber with 2 litres of 1x lower buffer, attach the silicon tubes of the cooling core to the thermostat, which is set to 4 °C and pour 200 ml of 1x upper buffer into the upper reservoir of the cooling core.",
    "For gel analysis take the samples containing 5 μg Chl, add a corresponding volume of Buffer B buffer to reach the same volume for all samples (usually 30 μl), add 1/10 of the volume of 10% DM and centrifuge immediately at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Take 25 μl of the solubilized membranes and load into the gel wells.For estimation of the molecular size of complexes, Gel Filtration Markers Kit for Protein Molecular Weights can be used, load 30 μl of the recommended mixture.Close the lid, attach it to the power supply and run in the constant current mode at 15 mA for 1.5-2 h with an upper voltage limit of 1,000 V (see Figure 1; during the run voltage gradually increases up to 1,000 V, after reaching this limit, the current goes down).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181226/20181226231021_3040.jpgFigure 1. The setup of the electrophoretic apparatus (lower right corner) with cooling thermostat (left) and power supply (upper right corner)After the pigmented front reaches a distance of about 8 cm from the bottom of the wells, switch off the power supply, remove the lid, detach the silicone cooling tubes and take out the cooling core with the gels from the electrophoretic chamber.Remove the gel from the glass cassette and wrap it into a transparent plastic film.Transfer it into the scanner to acquire the color image (300 dpi resolution, 48-bit color depth).",
    "Transfer the gel into the LAS4000 camera to take a 16 bit greyscale image in tiff format either in transparency mode to quantify green bands of PSI (Digitize DIA method, the lowest tray position, 3 s exposure, high resolution mode) or in epifluorescence mode using the blue LED excitation light (wavelength 460 nm) eliciting the chlorophyll (but not phycobiliprotein) fluorescence while the emitted light is passed through an R670 filter (long pass filter with the edge at 670 nm) to quantify PSII (Fluorescence method, the lowest tray position, 3 s exposure, high-resolution mode) (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181226/20181226231042_9158.jpgFigure 2. Representative color scans (left pair) and chlorophyll fluorescence images (right pair) of the gel with separated Photosystem I and Photosystem II complexes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 GT-P (Tichý et al., 2016) and the Photosystem I-less mutant (Shen et al., 1993). Left two lanes show color scans, right ones Chl fluorescence scans with dominant bands of Photosystem II dimer and monomer. Blue bands (PBS frag.) represent fragments of phycobilisomes, the cyanobacterial antennae, fluorescence of which is not elicited by blue light.Quantify bands using ImageJ according to the user guide (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf]). The bands are first selected as regions of interest (ROIs) using the Area selection tools in Toolbar Tools, the background is subtracted using the processing tools and the intensity of the bands analyzed using the intensity statistics in the analysis tools."
