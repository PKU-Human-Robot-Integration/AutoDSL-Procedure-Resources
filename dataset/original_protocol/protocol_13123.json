    "1. Growth of yeast cells\nIsolate single colonies of the strain of interest by streaking a small portion of the cells from a -80 °C glycerol stock onto a YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) agar plate. Incubate the plate at 30 °C for 2-3 days.\n\tNOTE: The S. cerevisiae strain used in this protocol is derived from BY4741 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0). With the exception of the auxotrophic marker genes, this strain does not contain any deleted gene and does not carry any plasmid. Thus, it can be successfully cultivated in a rich medium, stimulating vigorous cell growth. When working with strains transformed with plasmids, use the appropriate minimal medium for plasmid selection.\nPrepare a starter culture by inoculating 2-3 individual colonies from YPD agar plate in 10-20 mL of YPGal medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose) in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate at 30 °C for 24 h with vigorous shaking.\n\tNOTE: The choice of the growth medium depends on the yeast strain used in the protocol. Both YPD and YPGal contain fermentable carbon sources, which allow the growth of strains that do not perform mitochondrial respiration. However, since glucose represses the expression of many mitochondrial genes, it is not recommended to use this carbon source since it will produce lower amounts of mitochondria. When working with respiratory competent strains that can respire, it is also possible to use carbon sources such as glycerol and ethanol in an attempt to obtain a higher yield of mitochondria.\nDilute the starter culture into 1 L of fresh YPGal medium to an OD600 less than 0.1. Cultivate the cells at 30 °C with vigorous shaking until OD600 reaches 1-1.5.",
    "​NOTE: Determine the growth rate (doubling time) for each yeast strain before performing the experiment. This will provide an accurate estimate of the time of incubation required for the culture to reach an OD600 of 1-1.5.\n2. Isolation of highly purified mitochondria\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from17, with minor modifications.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells with distilled water and collect them by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDetermine the wet weight of the cells.\n\tNOTE: The easiest way to measure the weight of the cell pellet from step 2.2 is to determine the weight of the empty centrifuge tube just before the collection of the cells. After centrifugation, discard the supernatant and measure the weight of the same tube with the cells. The weight of the cells is the difference between the two measurements.\nResuspend the cells in DTT buffer (2 mL per 1 g of cells) using a Pasteur pipette or P5000 tip. See Table 1 for DDT buffer composition.\nIncubate the cells at 30 °C for 20 min with gentle shaking (~70 rpm).\nCentrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells.\nWash the cells with Zymolyase buffer without the enzyme (about 7 mL per 1 g of cells).\n\t​See Table 1 for Zymolyase buffer composition.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells.\nResuspend the cells in the buffer without Zymolyase (7 mL per 1 g of cells).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and add Zymolyase-20T (3 mg per g wet weight).",
    "Incubate the cells at 30 °C for 30-40 min with gentle shaking (~70 rpm). Check the efficiency of this process by comparing the turbidity of the cell suspension before and after Zymolyase treatment.\n\tNOTE: In this step, the cells will be converted into spheroplasts due to cell-wall digestion by Zymolyase.\n\t\nFor this, add 50 µL of each cell suspension to separate glass tubes containing 2 mL of water. After mixing vigorously, the turbidity of the cell suspension treated with Zymolyase should rapidly decrease due to the osmotic disruption of spheroplasts. On the other hand, the turbidity of the non-treated cell suspension should remain unchanged.\n\t\tNOTE: The effects of turbidity can also be monitored by simple visual inspection or by measuring the OD600 of both samples. In the second case, the OD600 of the Zymolyase treated sample should be 10%-20% of the non-treated sample. An alternate method involves counting the cells in both samples by using light microscopy.\nIf the yield of spheroplasts formation is low, add more Zymolyase and incubate for a further 15 min interval.\nHarvest the spheroplasts by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: All the further steps should be carried out fast and on ice or at 4 °C to avoid protein degradation by hydrolytic enzymes.\nWash the spheroplasts twice with ice-cold homogenization buffer (about 6.5 mL per 1 g of cells) and pellet by centrifuging at 2,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. See Table 1 for homogenization buffer composition.\nResuspend the spheroplasts in ice-cold homogenization buffer (6.5 mL per 1 g of cells) and transfer it to a pre-chilled glass Dounce homogenizer. Use a large glass homogenizer of approximately 30 mL.\nHomogenize the spheroplasts with 15 strokes using a pestle.",
    "NOTE: The number of strokes should be adjusted depending on the pestle fitting. For tight pestle, 15 strokes are sufficient. On the other hand, if using a loose pestle, it is recommended to perform up to 25 strokes.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and add 1 volume of ice-cold homogenization buffer.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at low speed, 1,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL centrifuge tube using a Pasteur pipette or P5000 tip taking care to avoid disrupting the pellet.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a high-speed centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the crude mitochondria fraction.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently wash the crude mitochondrial pellet in 20-30 mL ice-cold homogenization buffer by gentle pipetting using a P5000 tip.\nTransfer the suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the remaining cell debris.\nTransfer the supernatant to a high-speed centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the crude mitochondria fraction.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently resuspend the crude mitochondrial pellet in a small volume (typically 1000 µL) of ice-cold SEM buffer by gentle pipetting using a P1000 tip. See Table 1 for SEM buffer composition.",
    "NOTE: Although this crude mitochondrial fraction can be used directly in some applications such as in organello protein import assays, it contains substantial amounts of other cellular components. These contaminations might lead to misinterpretations of the results when determining the submitochondrial localization of a protein. Therefore, further purification steps are required to get highly purified mitochondrial preparation, as described below.\nPrepare sucrose solutions in the EM buffer at concentrations of 60%, 32%, 23%, and 15% (w/v). These solutions are stable for up to 1 month at 4 °C. See Table 1 for EM buffer composition.\nPrepare a 4-step sucrose gradient in an ultracentrifuge tube as follows: Place 1.5 mL of 60% (w/v) sucrose onto the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Next, pipette carefully stepwise: 4 mL of 32%, 1.5 mL of 23%, and 1.5 mL of 15% sucrose (w/v). Take care to avoid disrupting the phases.\nCarefully load the crude mitochondrial fraction on top of the sucrose gradient.\nCentrifuge for 1 h at 134,000 x g at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor.\nCarefully keep removing the sucrose solution until the highly purified mitochondria fraction is reached which is represented by a brown band at the 60%/32% sucrose interface.\nRecover the purified mitochondria using a P1000 cut tip and place it into a pre-chilled high-speed centrifuge tube.\nDilute the recovered mitochondria with 5-10 volumes of ice-cold SEM buffer.\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend the pure mitochondria in 500 µL of ice-cold SEM buffer by gentle pipetting using a P1000 cut tip.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the highly purified mitochondrial preparation using the Bradford procedure following the manufacturer's instructions. Adjust the protein concentration to 10 mg of protein/mL with ice-cold SEM buffer.",
    "​NOTE: For the submitochondrial fractionation protocol described below, it is recommended to use freshly prepared mitochondria. However, Vögtle and collaborators performed a detailed quality control analysis of the mitochondrial intactness and showed that frozen organelles can also be used in this protocol13. For this, make aliquots of 40 µL and freeze them in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80 °C.\n3. Submitochondrial fractionation protocol\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from reference18 and is composed of two steps: (1) hypotonic swelling in the presence or absence of proteinase K, and (2) sonication followed by carbonate extraction. Perform all the steps of both the protocols on ice or at 4 °C to avoid protein degradation.\nHypotonic swelling in the presence of proteinase K\nTransfer 40 µL of highly purified mitochondria at 10 mg/mL (400 µg) into four 1.5 mL pre-chilled labeled microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 360 µL of SEM buffer in tubes 1 and 2.\nAdd 360 µL of EM buffer in tubes 3 and 4.\nAdd 4 µL of proteinase K (10 mg/mL) in tubes 2 and 4. Use the pipetting scheme listed in Table 2 to avoid mistakes.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare a 10 mg/mL solution of proteinase K in water immediately before use. The final concentration of proteinase K in the experiment should be around 50-100 µg/mL. Please see the Discussion section for further details.\nMix all the tubes gently and incubate on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing.\nAdd 4 µL of 200 mM PMSF to all the four tubes to stop proteinase K activity.\n\t\tCAUTION: PMSF is highly toxic. Wear gloves when working with solutions containing PMSF.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL pre-chilled labeled microcentrifuge tube. Take care to avoid disrupting the pellet.",
    "NOTE: The pellet can be directly resuspended in the sample buffer for further SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. However, traces of proteinase K can remain active even after PMSF treatment and eventually can digest some proteins after the pellet has been dissolved in the SDS-containing sample buffer. To avoid this problem, proteinase K could be completely inactivated by treatment of the samples with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as described below.\n\t\tCAUTION: TCA is highly toxic. Wear gloves when working with solutions containing TCA.\nResuspend the pellet from step 3.1.8 in 400 µL of ice-cold SEM buffer.\nPrecipitate the supernatant (from step 3.1.8) and the resuspended pellet (from step 3.1.9) with TCA to a final concentration of 10% (w/v).\nIncubate all the tubes on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the TCA-treated samples for 10 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 200 µL of sample buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible that the bromophenol blue pH indicator turns yellow because of the acid treatment. If this happens, add small aliquots (1-5 µL) of 1 M Tris base until it turns blue.\nAdd 4 µL of 200 mM PMSF to all the tubes.\nStore all the samples at -80 °C until further analysis by SDS-PAGE and western blot.\nSonication and carbonate extraction\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, it is not necessary to use freshly prepared mitochondria once the sonication causes the rupture of the mitochondrial membranes.\n\t\nTransfer 200 µL of highly purified mitochondria at 10 mg/mL (2 mg protein) into a 1.5 mL pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube.\nDilute mitochondria one-fold with ice-cold SEM buffer.\nSonicate mitochondria for 3 x 30 s on ice. Use a sonicator compatible for small volumes.\nCentrifuge the sample for 30 min at 100,000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Collect the supernatant and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube. Keep it on ice. This sample will be named soluble protein fraction (S).\nResuspend the pellet from step 3.2.4 in 400 µL of ice-cold SEM buffer.\nTake 100 µL of the resuspended pellet from step 3.2.6 and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube. Keep it on ice. This sample will be named submitochondrial particles fraction (SMP).\nDilute the remaining 300 µL from step 3.2.6 one-fold with freshly prepared 200 mM sodium carbonate.\nIncubate the sample from step 3.2.8 on ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the sample for 30 min at 100,000 x g at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube.
