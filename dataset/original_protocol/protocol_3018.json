The\n      aim is to passage the iPSC line specifically to reach 80%–90% confluency\n      on the next day to start the differentiation. Thus, the seeding cell\n      number may differ depending on the cell line, and require optimization. To\n      ensure reliable and consistent results, iPSC culture should be stable (at\n      least 3 passages after thawing), proliferative without over-confluency\n      stress, and devoid of mycoplasma contamination.\n    \n        Pre-coat a 6-well plate with COAT-1 coating medium.\n        \nAdd 1 mL coating medium to each well.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min to 2 h at 37°C before use.\n        Single-cell dissociation of iPSCs.\n        \n            Aspirate the DEF-CS medium and rinse the cell surface with\n            pre-warmed 2 mL PBS.\n          \nAspirate the PBS and add 500 μL TrypLE Select.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 5–7 min.\nGently pipette the well to dissociate iPSCs to single cells.\n            Add 3 mL of pre-warmed iPSC medium (passage) to stop the enzymatic\n            reaction.\n          \nTransfer the cell-suspension medium to 15 mL STEMFULL tube.\nAliquot 20 μL of cell-suspension medium for cell count.\n        Seed iPSCs to the plate.\n        \n            Aspirate coating medium and gently add pre-warmed 3 mL of iPSC\n            medium (passage).\n          \n            Seed the required cell number from the cell-suspension medium to\n            each well.\n          \nGently shake the plate to disperse cells evenly.\n        Incubate the plate in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for\n        16 h.\n      \nCritical: Cell density prior to\n      differentiation is an important factor for efficient differentiation. We\n      typically seed 3.6 × 105–4.0 × 105 cells per well,\n      which leads to approximately 80%–90% confluency on the next day. Seeded\n      cell numbers should be optimized according to the iPSC strains.\n    \nStepwise differentiation of iPSCs to mid/hindgut cells",
    "Timing: Day 0 to Day 5, 20 min per day\n    \n      These steps describe the stepwise differentiation towards mid/hindgut\n      cells, largely based on a previously established protocol.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Briefly, the protocol involves\n      Activin-induced definitive endoderm formation from days 0–2, then\n      Wnt/FGF4-induced posteriorization towards mid/hindgut patterning from days\n      3–5 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2767-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1. Stepwise differentiation of iPSCs to mid/hindgut\n        \n          Representative images of cells during differentiation. Cell death is\n          typically observed from day 0 to day 1, but typically cells start\n          proliferating from day 1. Scale bar, 500 μm.\n        \nDay 0: Aspirate iPSC medium (passage) and add 3 mL of pre-warmed\n        DE day 0 medium.\n      \nDay 1: Aspirate DE day 0 medium and add 3 mL of pre-warmed DE day\n        1 medium.\n      \nDay 2: Aspirate DE day 1 medium and add 3 mL of pre-warmed DE day\n        2 medium.\n      \nDay 3: Aspirate DE day 2 medium and add 3 mL of pre-warmed\n        mid/hindgut medium.\n      \nDay 4-5: Change mid/hindgut medium daily.\nNote: Cell death and detachment sometimes\n      occur during DE differentiation, especially from day 0 to day 1. Cells\n      typically start to proliferate from day 1 and should be confluent on day 3\n      (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If excessive cell death occurs from day 0\n      to day 1 and cells are not confluent on day 3, it is unlikely that the\n      following differentiation is successful. In this case, seeded cell numbers\n      or cell conditions (i.e mycoplasma infection or spontaneous\n      differentiation of iPSCs during maintenance) should be checked. Medium\n      volume can be increased in case of over-acidification.\n    \nOptional: Aggregates of mid/hindgut\n      cells sometimes start to detach from the mid/hindgut cell sheet,\n      especially from day 5. These aggregates can be used for HIO\n      differentiation in a three-dimensional culture system as previously\n      described.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\n      Mid/hindgut spheroid formation using an EZSPHERE® 6-well plate\n    \nTiming: Day 6, 1 h",
    "These are critical steps for the generation of homogeneous mid/hindgut\n      spheroids in suspension (suspension-Spheroids; s-Spheroids). Mid/hindgut\n      cells differentiated from iPSCs are dissociated into single cells and\n      seeded onto an ultra-low attachment spheroid-forming plate with\n      microwells, which generates homogeneous spheroids.\n    \nFor the generation of larger spheroids, proceed to step 19.\nNote: The size of spheroids can be\n      controlled by changing the microwell diameter of EZSPHERE® plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Microwell diameters of 200 μm, 500 μm, 800 μm, and 1400 μm produces\n      spheroids of 100 μm, 180 μm, 230 μm, and 330 μm respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Only 500 μm microwell is commercially available in 6-well plate\n      format, while the rest is available as 35 mm dishes. The protocol\n      describes the use of 6-well plates; however, it is largely transferrable\n      to the 35 mm dish format.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2767-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. s-Spheroid size design by various size EZSPHERE® plates\n        \n          (A) Bright-field images of small, medium, and large spheroids formed\n          in microwell diameters: 300, 500, and 1,400 μm, respectively.

    "Critical: Avoid agitating the\n      EZSPHERE® plates during spheroid formation as mid/hindgut cells and\n      spheroids can easily be displaced from the microwells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n    \nOptional: Spheroid formation can be\n      monitored by time-lapse imaging using the BZ-X710 microscope to observe\n      aggregation and self-organization.\n    \n      Large spheroid formation using an EZ-BindShut® 96-well plate\n    \nTiming: Day 6, 1 h\n    \n      An alternative to the EZSPHERE® method.

We typically use 200 μL of medium per well when\n      making spheroids from 1 × 105 cells per well.\n    \n        Place the plate in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24\n        h.\n      \nNote: When making larger spheroids,\n      sometimes a longer incubation period is required for true sphere\n      formation. If spheroids fail to form a sphere, incubate the plate for an\n      additional 24 h.\n    \ns-Spheroid collection from EZSPHERE® 6-well plate\nTiming: Day 7, 20 min\n    \nIf proceeding from step 24, skip to step 29.\n      These steps describe the collection of spheroids from EZSPHERE® 6-well\n      plates for subsequent culturing. After 24 h of incubation, mid/hindgut\n      cells should have aggregated in the individual microwells to form one\n      spheroid per microwell (∼9200 spheroids per well). The structure is still\n      a relatively loose aggregate; thus, aggressive pipetting or movements\n      should be avoided.\n    \n        Gently shake the plate and pipette the medium so that spheroids float\n        out from the microwells.\n      \nCollect the spheroid containing medium to 15 mL STEMFULL tube.\n        Add 1 mL of pre-warmed DMEM to each well and repeat steps 25–26 to\n        maximize spheroid collection.\n      \n        Centrifuge the tube at 80 g for 3 min and aspirate the\n        supernatant. Proceed to step 32.\n      \nNote: When spheroids are in physical\n      contact for a period, they tend to fuse, which doesn’t pose a problem for",
    "further culture and growth. In order to have s-Spheroids with homogeneous\n      shape, size and inner structure, it would be better avoiding fusion. To\n      that end, spheroid collection and transfer to suspension culture should be\n      performed quickly (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2767-Fig7.jpg\n          Figure 7.

Scale bar, 500 μm.\n        \ns-Spheroid collection from EZ-BindShut® 96-well plate\nTiming: Day 7, 20 min\n    \n      These steps describe the collection of spheroids from EZ-BindShut® 96-well\n      plates for subsequent culturing. After 24–48 h of incubation, mid/hindgut\n      cells should have aggregated into one spheroid per well. These spheroids\n      are much larger than those formed on EZSPHERE® 6-well plates, and so may\n      require longer period to form. Typically, larger spheroids are more prone\n      to structural damage and disintegration; thus, special care is warranted\n      when handling.\n    \n        Pick up the s-Spheroids from individual wells into a 15 mL STEMFULL tube\n        with a wide tip pipette.\n      \nNote: Use the appropriate pipette tip that\n      is wide enough to safely pick up the generated spheroids. For larger\n      spheroids, we recommend cutting the tip of a 1000 μL pipette tip in an\n      aseptic condition. This should be adequate to safely pick up even\n      millimeter-scale spheroids.\n    \n        Place the tube vertically for 30–60 s to allow gravity sedimentation of\n        s-Spheroids.\n      \nAspirate the supernatant. Proceed to step 32.\n      Differentiation of s-Spheroids into human intestinal organoids (HIOs) in a\n      suspended state (s-HIOs)\n    \nTiming: Day 7 to Day 35, Day 7: 10 min,\n      Day 10: 20 min per medium change\n      These steps describe the differentiation of s-Spheroids into HIOs through\n      suspension culture. This protocol describes two suspension methods; static\n      suspension culture and rotational culture. For smaller s-Spheroids (i.e.,",
    "s-Spheroids generated by EZSPHERE® 6-well plate), static suspension\n      culture is sufficient for s-HIO differentiation (steps 32–39). For larger\n      s-Spheroids (i.e., s-Spheroids generated by EZ-BindShut® 96-well plate),\n      we recommend static suspension culture for three days, followed by\n      rotational culture (steps 40–48) for optimal growth and differentiation.\n    \nDay 7: Prepare HIO d 7 medium.\nNote: medium should be kept on ice to\n      avoid Matrigel polymerization.\n    \n        Add HIO d 7 medium to spheroid-collecting tube (step 28, step 31).\n      \n        Transfer spheroid-suspension medium to a 6-well ultra-low attachment\n        (ULA) culture plate. 3 mL of HIO d 7 medium is used for each well.\n      \nNote: We typically culture approximately\n      up to 900 small s-Spheroids (i.e. s-Spheroids generated from EZSPHERE®\n      6-well plate) per 1 well of the ULA culture plate. For larger s-Spheroids\n      (i.e. s-Spheroids generated from EZ-BindShut® 96-well plate), up to 16\n      s-Spheroids are applied to each well. Medium volume can be reduced to 2 mL\n      depending on the s-Spheroid concentration.\n    \nNote: Culturing individual spheroids in\n      96-well low attachment plate would eliminate the potential of spheroid\n      fusion, but medium change would be laborious.\n    \nCritical: Excessive spheroid\n      concentration increases the risk of spheroid fusion. Culture\n      concentrations should be optimized accordingly.\n    \nGently shake the ULA plate to disperse the s-Spheroids.\nNote: Even distribution of spheroids\n      within the well is important for preventing s-Spheroid fusion (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\n    \n        Culture the spheroids for 3 days in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2\n        incubator.\n      \nDay 10: Collect the s-Spheroids.\n        \nPrepare HIO medium and keep on ice.\nPrepare ice-cold DMEM.\n            Collect the spheroids into a 15 mL STEMFULL tube with a wide tip\n            pipette.\n          \nAdd ice-cold DMEM to the tube (up to 12 mL).\n            Gently rotate the tube to dislodge the spheroids from Matrigel\n            scaffold.\n          \n            Large Spheroids: Place the tube vertically to allow gravity\n            sedimentation of s-Spheroids. Small spheroids: Centrifuge 40",
    "g for 3 min.\n          \nAspirate the supernatant.\nNote: Depending on the amount of spheroids\n      collected, steps 37 d-g may need to be repeated 2–3 times. If there are\n      considerable Matrigel residuals, repeat those steps.\n    \nNote: For rotational culture of large\n      spheroids, proceed to step 40.\n    \nDay 10: Add HIO medium to the tube and transfer the\n        spheroid-suspension medium back to the ULA culture plate.\n      \nDay 13 - Day 35: Change HIO basal medium every 3–4 days (Repeat\n        37–38).\n      \nNote: Mesoderm gradually develops around\n      the spheroids and through the culture period spheroids gradually\n      differentiate into HIOs. The culture period can be shortened or expanded\n      depending on the developmental stage desired.\n    \n      Rotational culture and differentiation of s-Spheroids into s-HIOs\n    \nTiming: Day 10 to Day 35. Day 10:\n      20 min, Day 13: 20 min per medium change\n      For optimal growth and differentiation of larger s-Spheroids, we recommend\n      rotational culture from Day 101. This section provides\n      step-by-step instructions for transitioning from static to rotational\n      culture, and culture maintenance. The bioreactor employed is the CELLPET\n      3D-iPS® bioreactor, in which the s-Spheroids are exposed to a constant\n      flow of the medium, enhancing active gas exchange and penetration of the\n      medium.\n    \nNote: Before starting rotational culture,\n      we recommend three days of static suspension culture, as s-Spheroids are\n      initially vulnerable to mechanical stress.\n    \nDay 10: Prepare 10 mL rotational culture vessel syringe (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2767-Fig8.jpg\n              Figure 8. Overview of the rotational culture\n            \n(A) Image of a culture vessel syringe.\n              (B) Representative image of spheroids cultured in a rotational\n              bioreactor; CELLFLOAT 3D-iPS system (Corresponding with\n              Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n            \n(C) Medium is applied to the vertically stood vessel.\n(D) Spheroids were collected in a 15 mL tube.\n              (E) Spheroids are transferred to the vessel. In this step,\n              spheroids typically sink to the bottom.",
    "(F) Vessel is tilted before setting the plunger to minimize the\n              risk of spheroids sinking to the very bottom.\n            \n              (G) Release the positive pressure by loosening the cap, then\n              closing the cap (Corresponding with\n              Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n            \nPrepare 8 mL of ice-cold HIO medium.\n            Close the cap of the vessel. Stand the vessel vertically on a 1.5 mL\n            tube stand.\n          \n            Add 7 mL of HIO medium to the vessel (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\n          \n        Add 1 mL of HIO medium to the spheroid containing tube (step 37) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]D).\n      \n        Transfer the spheroids to the vessel using a 1000 μL pipette (with cut\n        tip) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]E).\n      \nNote: Less than 20 spheroids are cultured\n      in a 10 mL vessel. 10 mL, 30 mL, and 50 mL vessels are currently\n      commercially available. The size of the vessel can be adjusted depending\n      on the number and sizes of spheroids.\n    \nNote: HIO medium used per culture vessel\n      must be less than 80% of the total vessel volume (i.e. 24 mL medium or\n      less for a 30 mL vessel). Using more medium increases the risk of\n      over-pressurization and spillage.\n    \nCritical: Culturing too many\n      s-Spheroids in one vessel will cause spheroid fusion and medium\n      over-acidification. For each iPSC strain and culture system, optimization\n      is necessary for the number of spheroids per vessel, vessel size, and\n      frequency of medium changes.\n    \nSet the plunger to the 10 mL scale.\nNote: The positive pressure within the\n      vessel will push back on the plunger. Thus, constant pressure needs to be\n      applied on the plunger to maintain its position. Be prepared to loosen the\n      cap and release the pressure when setting the plunger.\n    \nCritical: Ensure that no spheroids are\n      present at the tip of the syringe culture vessel (the very bottom where\n      the cap is placed). It endangers the spheroids when the positive pressure",
    "is released. If a spheroid can be seen close to the tip of the vessel,\n      gently pipette the medium, tilt the vessel 45 degrees, then set the\n      plunger (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]F).\n    \n        Release the positive pressure within the vessel by loosening the cap and\n        close the cap (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]G).\n      \nNote: Some HIO medium will leak from the\n      vessel cap. Loosen the cap with an absorbent paper in hand.\n    \n        Put the vessel on the CELLPET 3D-iPS® bioreactor placed within a\n        humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator and start rotation (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n      \nNote: The optimum rotational speed is such\n      that the cultured tissue is static relative to the viewer and rotating\n      relative to the vessel (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). This speed\n      differs depending on the size and density of the tissue. Typically, we\n      start rotational speed from 8 rpm and as s-Spheroids grow the speed is\n      gradually increased to maximize the nutrient/oxygen exchange of the\n      spheroids.\n    \nCritical: When the rotation is set too\n      fast, it generates high shear stress and destroys the s-Spheroids/HIOs.\n      Optimize the rotational speed depending on the size of s-Spheroids and\n      HIOs.\n    \nDay 13: Collect s-Spheroids from the vessel.\n        \nPrepare ice-cold DMEM.\n            Collect s-Spheroids from the vessels with a 1000 μL pipette tip\n            (with cut tip) and transfer them to a 15 mL STEMFULL tube.\n          \nAdd ice-cold DMEM to the tube (up to 12 mL).\n            Gently rotate the tube to dislodge the spheroids from Matrigel\n            scaffold.\n          \n            Place the tube vertically to allow gravity sedimentation of\n            spheroids.\n          \nAspirate the supernatant.\nNote: Depending on the amount of spheroids\n      collected, steps 46 c-f may need to be repeated 2–3 times. If there are\n      considerable Matrigel residuals, repeat those steps.\n    \n        Transfer s-Spheroids to the vessel (Repeat steps 40–45) (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C–8G, Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n      \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
