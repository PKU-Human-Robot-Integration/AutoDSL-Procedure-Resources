    "1. Preparation of a heavy peptide standard\nDepending on the supplier and quality of the heavy peptides purchased, the heavy peptides will need to be diluted. This protocol used the peptide sequences reported in Table 1, with the C–terminal amino acid modified to Lysine (13C615N2-lysine) or Arginine (13C615N4-arginine).\n\t\nMix the heavy peptides, diluting the mix with 50% acetonitrile (ACN) to create a peptide mix with each peptide at 10 µM.\nCreate aliquots of the peptide mix and store at -80 °C.\n2. Sample preparation\nSample lysis\n\tNOTE: The stability of ubiquitin chains must be considered during sample preparation. Keep biological samples and buffers chilled at 4 °C and add samples to ubiquitin stabilization buffer as rapidly as possible.\n\t\nPrepare a solution of 1 M NH4HCO3 (ammonium bicarbonate) in water and adjust the pH to 8 using 1 M NaOH.\nPrepare a solution of 200 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in water.\nPrepare ubiquitin stabilization buffer using 8 M urea in 50 mM NH4HCO3/10 mM NEM. Ubiquitin stabilization buffer must be prepared freshly each time.\n\t\tNOTE: A 5 mL solution of 8 M urea will require considerably less than 5 mL of water given the expansion of water when in a saturated solution with urea.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not prepare the buffer above 50 °C due to the tendency of urea to form polyurea at high temperatures.\nResuspend the biological sample to be investigated in ubiquitin stabilization buffer aiming for 0.5 µg/µL of protein and lyse the cells with an appropriate method for the sample. A sonication method consisting of three 10 s pulses with an SFX 150 Branson sonifier set at 70% intensity with 10 s breaks on ice between each pulse, was used for the cell lines in this protocol.",
    "Centrifuge sample at 18,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge.\nTransfer supernatant to a fresh low protein binding microcentrifuge tube. Samples can be stored at -20 °C at this point if needed.\nPreparation of sample and controls\nIf the samples are frozen, mix (e.g., with a thermomixer) while they are thawed to rapidly dissolve the urea.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not use temperatures above 50 °C due to the tendency of urea to form polyurea at high temperatures.\nCentrifuge sample at 18,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge.\nTransfer 20 µg of sample to a fresh low-bind microcentrifuge tube and adjust the volume to 50 µL with ubiquitin stabilization buffer.\nCreate a negative control using a normalized volume of ubiquitin stabilization buffer (50 µL). In this sample, no light version of each peptide should be present, allowing observation of any light contamination arising from the spike-in heavy peptides. This negative control was also used for retention time scheduling of the PRM described in section 3.1.\nA positive control was also created with ubiquitin stabilization buffer and the addition of commercially available chain types to the normalized volume of ubiquitin stabilization buffer (50 µL). Commonly, K63, K48, and M1 are available. In the representative results 20 ng of K48, K63, and M1 were utilized.\nReduction, alkylation, and digestion\nPrepare a solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) in water and adjust the sample to pH = 8 with 1 M NaOH.\nA culture of E. coli grown in LB broth was centrifuged 5,000 x g for 5 min to form a pellet, which was then washed 2x with PBS before resuspension in ubiquitin stabilization buffer at 5 μg/μL.",
    "Add 1 µg of E. coli lysate to each sample and control. This protocol uses E. coli (DH10B), but any complex lysate without ubiquitin can be used. Note that ubiquitin is common to all eukaryotes.\n\t\tNOTE: Using an E. coli lysate matrix reduces the loss of peptides due to nonspecific adhesion to plasticware. This is particularly noticeable in the negative control or samples with a limited protein content and has a strong impact on the observation of K6312.\nPrepare a solution of 500 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in MS grade water (DTT can be used as an alternative).\nReduce the samples and controls by the addition of TCEP to a final concentration of 50 mM. Vortex briefly before incubating for 30 min at room temperature (RT). If DTT is used, the temperature has to be elevated to 50 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not use temperatures above 50 °C due to the tendency of urea to form polyurea at high temperatures.\nPrepare a solution of 550 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) in NH4HCO3. Store in the dark.\nAlkylate the samples and controls by adding CAA to a final concentration of 55 mM. Vortex briefly before incubating for 20 min at RT in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: CAA is used instead of iodoacetamide as the reduction agent to decrease the chance of a double carbamidomethyl modification (114.0429) on a lysine residue being mistaken for a -GG modification (114.0429)13.\nAdd endopeptidase LysC to the samples at 1:25 (w/w) ratio to the protein content. Incubate for 3 h at 37 °C.\nDilute the samples and controls with 200 µL of 50 mM NH4HCO3 pH = 8 (1:5 v/v).\nAdd trypsin to the samples at 1:25 w/w ratio to the protein content. Incubate for 12 h at 37 °C.",
    "Add 10% formic acid (FA) solution in MS grade water at a 1:10 ratio v/v to each sample and control sample. Check that pH is <3) prior to the C18 cleanup and add more formic acid if needed.\nTo each sample and control add 0.5 µL of the heavy peptide standard created in section 1.\nPeptide cleanup\nSeveral manufacturers offer C18 cleanup tips or plates. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the product used, and dry eluted peptides in a vacuum centrifuge, ready for MS analysis.\n3. Analysis by LC-MS/MS\nExecute initial PRM analysis on the heavy peptide standard in an unscheduled fashion.\n\t\nResuspend the dried samples in 10 µL of MS loading buffer 2% ACN/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).\nEquip an HPLC with a reverse-phase C18 analytical column (75 µm x 15 cm, 2 µm 100 Å C18 beads) designed for nanoflow MS. Form linear gradients exchanging MS grade water supplemented with 0.1% FA with ACN containing 0.1% FA. A sacrificial trap column (75 µm x 2 cm, 3 µm, 100 Å C18 beads) to preserve the life of the analytical column was used here but is not required.\nCouple the output of the analytical column to a nano-ESI source on a high-resolution mass spectrometer.\nUtilize an appropriate targeted proteomics method for the mass spectrometer. For example, on a Q-Exactive plus a two-experiment method, cycle between a Full MS and a PRM experiment. For the Full MS experiment, a resolution of 120,000 with an AGC target of 1e6 and 240 ms as Maximum IT was used. For the PRM experiment, the same AGC target and maximum IT was used with a lower resolution of 60,000 and an isolation window of 1.2 m/z.",
    "Inject 200 ng of the negative control onto the analytical column using the HPLC autosampler. Apply a linear gradient to the sample on the analytical column increasing the ACN concentration from 2–25% over a period of ~45 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The 25% ACN concentration is lower than usual for proteomics due to the low hydrophilic nature of typical ubiquitin topology-characteristic peptides. If other peptides are to be quantified, a higher ACN concentration may be desired to achieve good target separation.\nAnalyze the results of the scheduling run as described in section 4.2 to create a scheduled inclusion list.\nAnalysis of the samples\n\t\nRun the remaining samples as described for the scheduling in 3.1 apart from the use of the scheduled inclusion list created in section 4.2.\n\t\tNOTE: A blank must be run after the positive control to ensure no carryover from the previous run is being detected in subsequent samples.\n4. Software analysis\nCreate an inclusion list of appropriate formatting for the utilized MS. This protocol used the open source software Skyline (version 19.1.0.193) (https://skyline.ms), which offers well-documented support and help. An inclusion list can be created for several mass spectrometers using the export isolation list facility.\n\t\nOpen a new Skyline document.\nSelect heavy isotope modifications as appropriate to heavy topology-characteristic peptides. In Settings|Peptide Settings under the Modification tab, click on the name field to see the potential modification. Selection is based on the isotopic state of the heavy peptides purchased. In this example, synthetic peptides carrying either a heavy Lysine (13C615N2-lysine) or a heavy Arginine (13C615N4-arginine) at the C-terminus were used. Appropriate labels would be: “Label:13C(6)15N(2) (C-term K)” and “Label:13C(6)15N(4) (C-term R)”.\nSelect Settings|Transition. Under the Filter tab include Precursor Charges 2, 3, 4.\nInsert peptides by selecting Edit|Insert|Peptides.",
    "Fill in the relevant fields including the topology-characteristic peptide sequence and a protein name (e.g., \"Chain–K63\").\nExpand each peptide now shown in the Targets panel. Delete undesired charge states. The preferred charge state and collision energy, which may differ based on mass spectrometer used, for each topology-characteristic peptide is shown in Table 1.\nFor each topology-characteristic peptide (except for M1 where the GG is included in the sequence) right-click on the sequence and select Modify. Add a GG as a structural modification by clicking the name field and selecting <Show all…> before selecting \"GlyGly (K)\".\nExport the isolation list File|Export|Isolation List, select the instrument type, and set the method type to Standard. Selecting OK will open a prompt to save a *.csv file that can be used to create a PRM method.\nCreate a scheduled inclusion list based on a heavy peptide scheduling run explained here using the open source Skyline software.\n\t\nCreate a target list as described in section 4.1.\nImport the scheduling run in 3.1 by selecting File|Import|Results.\nReview the identifications. The heavy signal for each peptide is observable by clicking on the mass for each heavy peptide entry. Correct recognition of the peak is often determined automatically, but the software may require manual curation by selecting the peak using click and drag under the x-axis.\nRetention times selected for the heavy variants are also applied to the light versions, thus creating a schedule for the PRM. The scheduling window can be modified under Settings|Peptide Settings using the Prediction tab, by changing the Time Window.\nA scheduled inclusion list can now be exported using File|Export|Isolation list and selecting the appropriate instrument type and setting method type to Scheduled.\nAnalyze the data.\n\t\nImport the samples in the same fashion as for the scheduling run analysis in section 4.2.",
    "After the complete import of all samples, curation of transitions is recommended. This is the process by which transitions with interference or poor signal-to-noise ratios are removed. An example of a chromatogram before and after curation is shown in Figure 4.\nData can now be exported either by right clicking on relevant graphs and selecting Copy data or by selecting File|Export|Results.\nSubscription Required.
