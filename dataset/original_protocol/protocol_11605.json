    "This protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Brock University and at Carolinas Rehabilitation.\n1. Prior to Testing\nCreate 3 separate lists for the 15 film clips, each listing the clips in a different restricted order.\nEnsure that each list begins and ends with a neutral stimulus and that no two clips that target the same emotion occur consecutively.\nCreate a separate folder on the desktop for each list of film order presentation and label the folder with the Order name (e.g., Order 1).\nSave the 15 clips into each of the three folders.\nRe-label each film clip so it reflects the presentation number and gives no clues regarding the target emotion (i.e., 01; 02; 03; etc.).\nCreate six randomized orders of task (DANVA-Faces, DANVA-Voices, Film Clips) presentation (see Figure 1).\nAssign the incoming participant to one of the three restricted orders of film clips presentation.\nAssign the incoming participant to one of the six randomized orders of task presentation.\n2. Day of Testing\nBring participant(s) into the lab and seat them comfortably at the table.\nReview the consent form with the participant by reading each section with him/her.\nAnswer any questions the participant may have about the consent form and have him/her sign it.\nHave participants complete the brief demographic questionnaire (Date of birth; gender). Have participants with TBI additionally complete the section of the questionnaire on relevant medical history questionnaire (date of injury, cause of injury, injury severity).\n\tNOTE: When participants are completing the questionnaire, inquire about any known visual processing difficulties so you may seat participants with TBI accordingly\nPosition the participant in front of the computer in a chair. Ensure that all participants (if more than one) have a clear view of the screen.\n3. DANVA-Faces Task",
    "Give each participant a clip board with the DANVA-Faces response sheet attached and a pen to circle responses.\nProvide the participant the following instructions: \"After you see each item, circle your response (happy, sad, angry, fearful, or neutral) on the line that corresponds to the item number shown on each slide.\"\n\tNOTE: If participants with TBI have indicated visual processing difficulties or fine motor difficulties are evident, provide the participant with the alternate response page. This page lists the five responses in larger text in landscape format.\nOpen the DANVA-Faces task in a presentation and play it using the Slide Show View.\nGive participants the following instructions: \"For this activity, I am going to show you some peoples' faces and I want you to tell me how they feel. I want you to tell me if they are happy, sad, angry or fearful. Fearful is the same thing as afraid or scared. If you are unsure of the emotion, choose the 'I don't know' response. There are 24 faces altogether. Each face will be on the screen for five seconds. You must answer before the face disappears for your answer to count. Indicate your answer by circling it on the sheet in front of you\".\n\tNOTE: If the participant is unable to circle his/her own responses and is participating in in the study as part of a small group, provide the following instruction: \"Indicate your answer by pointing to it on the sheet in front of you\". The examiner will then record the participant's response on the DANVA-Faces response sheet.\nEnsure the participants do not have any questions before starting.",
    "Start the task with the two practice trials. Give participants the following instructions: \"We are going to complete two practice trials so that you get a sense of how long each face will appear on the screen, and how long you have to provide your answer\".\nHit enter on the keyboard when the face disappears to move to the next stimulus. Ensure all participants are looking up at the screen before doing so.\nEnsure that the participants do not have questions. If none, begin the test trials. Ensure all participants are looking at the screen. Hit enter to start the test stimuli.\nContinue the procedure outlined for the practice tasks until the 24 stimuli are complete.\nCollect the participant response sheets.\n4. DANVA-Voices Task\nGive each participant a clip board with the DANVA-Voices response sheet attached and a pen to circle responses.\n\tNOTE: If participants with TBI have indicated visual processing difficulties or fine motor difficulties are evident, provide the participant with the alternate response page. This page lists the five responses in larger text in landscape format.\nOpen the DANVA-Voices task by going to the following website:\n\thttp://www.psychology.emory.edu/clinical/interpersonal/danva.htm\nClick on the link for Adult faces, voices, and postures.\nFill in the login and password by entering any letter for the login and typing EMORYDANVA2 for the password.\nClick Continue.\nClick on Voices (green circle in the center of the screen).\nTest the volume level. Provide the following instructions: \"I want to be sure that you can hear the sound on the computer and that it is at a comfortable volume for you. I am going to click test sound. Please tell me if you can hear the sound, and also if you need the sound to be louder or more quiet to be comfortable for you.\"\nClick test sound.",
    "Adjust the volume according to the participant's request (increase/decrease).\nClick 'test sound' again. Adjust the volume according to the participant's request. Do this until the participant reports it is at a comfortable volume.\nReview the task instructions with the participant. Give participants the following instructions: For this activity, you are going to hear someone say the sentence 'I'm going out of the room now, but I'll be back later.' I want you to tell me if they are happy, sad, angry or fearful. Fearful is the same thing as afraid or scared. If you are unsure of the emotion, choose the 'I don't know' response. There are 24 sentences. Before each sentence is spoken, a number will be announced. You need to listen to the sentence that follows. The sentences will not be repeated so you need to listen carefully. Tell me how the person is feeling by circling your answer on the sheet in front of you\". Once you have made your selection, I need to select a response on the computer screen to move to the next item. I will always select the same emotion (fearful). My selection does not indicate the correct answer in anyway.\"\n\tNOTE: If the participant is unable to circle his/her own responses and is participating in in the study as part of a small group, provide the following instruction: \"Indicate your answer by pointing to it on the sheet in front of you\". The examiner will then record the participant's response on the DANVA-Voices response sheet.\nClick 'continue'.\nDirect participants to circle (or point to) their answer on their response sheet when the sentence has played.\nClick 'fearful'. Click 'next'.\nContinue this procedure until the 24 sentences are complete.\nExit the website when you reach the end of the task.",
    "Collect the participants' response sheets.\n5. Film Clip Task\nSeat participants comfortably in front of the computer. Ensure that the screen can be fully seen by all.\nGive each person a clipboard with a copy of the Emotional Film Clip Response sheet.\n\tNOTE: If participants with TBI have indicated visual processing difficulties or fine motor difficulties are evident, provide the participant with two alternate response pages. The first page lists the five forced-choice responses and the second provides the 0-9 scale. Both response pages are in larger text and in landscape format.\nOpen the folder on the computer for the assigned order of film clip presentation.\nProvide participants with the following directions: \"You are going to view a total of 15 film clips. In each film clip, you are going to see a character who looks like they are feeling a certain emotion. They might look 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'fearful', or 'neutral'. First, I want you to tell me what emotion the character is showing. Then tell me what emotion you experienced while watching the film clip. Finally, tell me the number that best describes the intensity of the emotion you felt while watching the clip. For example, if the person's face made you feel 'mildly' happy or sad, circle a number ranging from 1 to 3. If you felt 'moderately' happy or sad, circle a number ranging from 4 to 6. If you felt 'very' happy or sad, circle a number ranging from 7 to 9. Only circle 0 if you did not feel any emotion at all. Do you have any questions?\"\n\tNOTE: Only the first question (Tell me what emotion the character is showing) was analyzed for the current study.\nDouble click 01 to open the first film clip.",
    "Tell the participant which character to focus on while viewing the clip.\nSelect 'View Full Screen' in the options menu to play the clip.\nDirect the participants to respond to line a (What emotion is the main character experiencing?) on their response sheet when the clip has finished playing.\nDirect the participants to respond to line b (Choose one emotion that best describes how you felt while watching the clip) on the response sheet once line a has been answered.\nDirect the participant to respond to line c (How would you rate the intensity of the emotion you experienced while watching the clip?) once line b has been answered.\nDirect the participant to re-direct his/her attention to the computer screen once the responses are complete.\nReturn to the folder on the computer that contains the film clips in the assigned order for the participant.\nDouble cck on 02 to open the second film clip. Repeat Steps 5.5 to 5.12 until the participant has viewed all 15 film clips.\nCollect the response sheet from the participant(s).\n6. Moving from One Task to Another (Optional Step)\nProvide participants the option to take a break between Tasks 2 and 3.\n7. Scoring the Tasks\nRefer to the answer key on page 25 of the DANVA2 manual32 to score the DANVA-Faces task.\nScore items that match the answer key as 1 and incorrect items as 0. 'I don't know' responses are scored as 0.\nCalculate a raw score by adding the total number of correct responses. Divide the raw score by 24 (total items) to obtain a percentage accuracy score.\nRefer to the answer key on page 27 of the DANVA2 manual32 and repeat steps 7.2 and 7.3 to score the DANVA-Voices task.",
    "Refer to the answer key for assigned order of film clip presentation for the participant. Score a 1 if the participant identified the target emotion when responding to the question about what emotion the character was showing, and 0 if the participant did not select the target emotion (including if the participant said 'I don't know').\nCalculate a raw score by adding the number of correct responses. Divide the raw score by 15 (total items) to obtain a percentage accuracy score.\nCreate a subset score for the Film Clip task that contains only responses to the happy, sad, angry, and fearful film clips by adding correct responses to only these 12 clips. Divide the number of correct responses by 12 to obtain a percentage accuracy score.\nCreate a score for responses to neutral film clips by adding the number of correct responses to the neutral clips. Divide the number of correct responses by 3 to obtain a percentage accuracy score.\n\tNOTE: A subset score needs to be created because the DANVA tasks did not include portrayals of Neutral while the Film Clips task did.\nCalculate a score for responses to positively valenced items (i.e., happy) and negatively valenced items (combine responses to angry, fearful and sad stimuli) for all three tasks.\nDivide the score for positively valenced items for each task by 3 to obtain percentage accuracy score.\nDivide the score for negatively valenced items for each task by 9 to obtain percentage accuracy scores.\n8. Data Analysis\nConduct a mixed model analyses of variance (ANOVA) to examine responses to isolated facial emotion stimuli, isolated vocal emotion stimuli, and multimodal film clip stimuli by participants with TBI and Control participants.\nExplore main effects found in the ANOVA using follow-up univariate comparisons.\nSubscription Required.
