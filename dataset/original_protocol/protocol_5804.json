    "Cell cultureGrow HTL cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere to about 80% confluence.Treat the cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for about 2 min. Dilute the cells to 0.4 x 106/ml with DMEM medium (supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum) and split at 50,000 per well into a 24-well plate one day prior to transfection.TransfectionPrepare Master Mix for one sample:To a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add:10 µl Opti-MEM medium0.195 µl X-tremeGENE 9 Transfection Reagent. Notes: Avoid touching the side of the tube while adding reagent.Make a Master Mix for larger number of samples: for example, for 10 samples, multiply by 11 to prepare some extra mix. (10 x 11 = 110 µl medium + 0.195 x 11 = 2.145 µl X-tremeGENE 9 Transfection Reagent).Add 10 µl Opti-MEM medium per well in a 96-well plate and then add 65 ng total DNA into each well.Note: We usually dilute the DNA plasmid to the concentration of 100 ng/µl and store them at 4 °C. Add 10 µl Master Mix to DNA mix per well and mix gently by pipetting.Incubate at room temperature for about 30 min.Carefully transfer 20 µl mix by pipetting into each well of cells cultured in 24-well plate. Note: In this particular case, for coexpression with γ-secretase, 20 ng substrate-encoding DNA, 5 ng phRG-tk Renilla normalization standard and 10 ng of each of the γ-secretase subunit expression plasmids were transfected. For the substrate-only control, 20 ng substrate, 5 ng phRG-tk Renilla and 40 ng pBSK mock plasmid were transfected. As a positive control, 10 ng Rho(4M)-TEV-site-rTA, 10 ng Arr(3A)-TEV, 5 ng phRG-tk Renilla and 40 ng pBSK mock plasmid were co-transfected (Kang et al., 2015).",
    "Culture the cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.Luciferase measurementAfter one day growth, remove the medium from the cultured cells by vacuum pump using loading pipette tips, and gently apply a sufficient volume (i.e., 500 µl/well) of PBS (see Recipes) to rinse the bottom of each well. Dispense 100 µl of 1x PLB (see Recipes) into each well and gently shake the culture plate for 15 min at room temperature (e.g., 70 rpm).Note: We use Eppendorf® Research® Pro electronic single channel pipette (20-1,000 µl) to dispense the PLB buffer. However, any laboratory pipettes which can reach 100 µl should be fine.Transfer 20 µl PLB lysate without cell debris into each well of a 96-well OptiPlate.Note: Generally, it is unnecessary to clear lysates of residual cell debris prior to performing the assay.Program the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader to perform a 2-sec premeasurement delay, followed by a 10-sec measurement period using 96 Plate US Luminescence aperture (700 nm emission filter) for each reporter assay.Dispense 50 µl LAR2 substrate (see Recipes), mix by pipetting 2 or 3 times and measure Firefly luciferase activity using EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader. The Luminescence reads represent the Firefly luciferase activity.Dispense 50 µl freshly prepared Stop & Glo® Reagent (see Recipes) in the same plate, mix by pipetting 2 or 3 times and measure the Renilla luciferase activity by EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader. The Luminescence reads represent the Renilla luciferase activity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115225023_2346.jpg Note: Normalize the relative activity using WT activity as 100."
