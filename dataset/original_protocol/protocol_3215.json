Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nDilute RNA samples with nuclease-free water to the assay-specific detection range.\nNote: The starting material is expected to have a relatively high RNA concentration, and using the Qubit broad range kit (0.5–2000 ng/μL) eliminates the need for sample dilution steps. In later stages of the protocol (following Poly(A) + RNA isolation and clean-up), the RNA concentration is anticipated to fall within the range of the high sensitivity RNA Qubit kit (0.2–200 ng/μL).\nPrepare the Qubit working solution by diluting the Qubit RNA Reagent 1:200 in Qubit RNA Buffer.\nTo prepare the standards, add 10 μL of each Qubit standard to 190 μL Qubit working solution in Qubit assay tubes, mix by vortexing.\nTo prepare RNA samples, add 1 μL of RNA sample to 199 μL Qubit working solution in Qubit assay tubes, mix by vortexing.\nMeasure concentration in ng/μL using the Qubit fluorometer.\nFragment analysis using the Fragment Analyzer System from Agilent troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nUse the Agilent DNF-471 RNA Kit (15 nt, 5–500 ng/μL input sample concentration) or the Agilent DNF-472 HS (High Sensitivity) RNA (15 nt, 50–5,000 pg/μL input sample concentration) kit to perform automated capillary electrophoresis.\nDepending on the RNA concentration, dilute the samples using nuclease-free water to the detection range of the fragment analysis kit.",
    "Analyze RNA integrity by following the operating instructions of the Fragment Analyzer System and the ProSize data analysis software. Manuals are available online: https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/Fragment_Analyzer_system_manual_D0002110.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/Fragment_Analyzer_system_manual_D0002110.pdf]; https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ProSize%20data%20analysis%20software%20user%20manual_D0002111_Rev_B.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ProSize%20data%20analysis%20software%20user%20manual_D0002111_Rev_B.pdf].\nUse RNA Quality Numbers (RQN) for data interpretation. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] shows RNA fragment analyses, demonstrating optimal RNA quality parameters across various species.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2984-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Total RNA fragment analysis and quality scoring\nTop panels: Total RNA isolated from Drosophila (left) or mouse (right), no fragmentation visible, RQN = 10. Lower panel: Total RNA isolated from Drosophila (left) or mouse (right), smeary baseline indicates RNA fragmentation, RQN = 8 or 6, not useful for detection of ultra-long transcript isoforms (> 10 kb). LM: Lower marker needed for size calibration, Blue and pink: ribosomal RNA fractions (28S and 18S) recognized by the software to calculate RNA Quality Numbers (RQN), 1 (poorest), 10 (highest) quality.\nCritical: Use only total RNA preparations of very high quality with no RNA fragmentation visible (flat baseline of electropherogram). RQN/RIN should be > 9. (RIN: RNA Integrity Number if Bioanalyzer or TapeStation systems are used for RNA qualification)\nSelection of poly(A)+ RNA\nTiming: 2 h\nPoly(A)+ RNA transcripts are selected from DNA-free total RNA preparations using Oligo d(T)-coupled paramagnetic beads. Use the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module from NEB (E7490). All reagents within the module should be stored at 4°C. Reagent expiry dates can be found on each tube. The module provides a step-by-step protocol for isolating Poly(A)+ RNA from total RNA preparations, which should be followed in detail as the selection of Poly(A)+ RNA increases library preparation efficiency and enables sequencing of full-length RNAs at a later stage.",
    "Prepare several DNA-free total RNA aliquots in PCR tube strips containing 4 μg of high-quality total RNA each. According to the Poly(A)+ selection module, starting material for Poly(A)+ isolation can vary from 1 to 5 μg of total RNA. The RNA should be diluted in a final volume of 50 μL nuclease-free water.\nNote: To generate sufficient material for a single experiment, we found eight 4-μg total RNA aliquots sufficient for an experiment run using a MinION/GridION or even a PromethION sequencing platform.\nPerform Poly(A)+ RNA isolation by following instructions of the NEBNext Poly(A)+ mRNA Magnetic Isolation module. https://international.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/manuals/manuale7490.pdf?rev=8fc35eb8aee94d0b90f0b671aa5a46ac&hash=C8CCC69263E3FEA33B00126133F6A118[href=https://international.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/manuals/manuale7490.pdf?rev=8fc35eb8aee94d0b90f0b671aa5a46ac&hash=C8CCC69263E3FEA33B00126133F6A118].\nMeasure Poly(A)+ RNA concentration and analyze RNA fragment size. Perform quality control by following the instructions detailed under step 1 “RNA quality control[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]”.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2984-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Poly(A)+ RNA fragment analysis\nThe NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module from NEB was used to isolate Poly(A)+ RNA from total RNA preparations. Samples were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer system using the Agilent DNF-471 RNA Kit (15 nt). LM: Lower marker needed for size calibration.\nNote: Software assisted assessment of RNA fragmentation level (RQN/RIN) is not possible at this step, since ribosomal RNA signals are removed post Poly(A)+ enrichment. Hence, only a visual inspection of the traces is possible. After Poly(A)+ enrichment, typically RNA fragments are visible beyond 500 nt. Enrichment of fragments smaller than 500 nucleotides can be interpreted as sample fragmentation. Poly(A)+ RNA extracted from drosophila typically shows a prominent signal around 2000 nt (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: Keep samples and all the reagents used during the Poly(A) isolation, except the NEBNext Oligo d(T)25 beads, on ice when not in use.\nExclusion of short Poly(A)+ RNA fragments (<1 Kb)\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Exclude short RNA fragments using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (upon arrival, aliquot RNACleanXP beads into 1 mL aliquots and store at 4°C for up to 18 months).\nBring Agencourt RNAClean XP beads to room temperature (30 min at 20°C–25°C).\nPrior to usage, vortex Agencourt RNAClean XP beads vigorously.\nIf multiple Poly(A)+ RNA fractions were prepared, pool fractions prior to bead clean-up.\nUse a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.4. For example, starting with a Poly(A)+ RNA sample volume of 50 μL, add 20 μL beads.\nMix Poly(A)+ RNA sample and Agencourt RNAClean XP beads and incubate for 5 min at room temperature to bind RNA to magnetic beads.\nPlace on a magnetic stand, wait until supernatant is clear Remove and discard supernatant.\nWhile keeping tubes on a magnetic rack, add 200 μL of 70% EtOH (freshly prepared) without disturbing the beads.\nRemove the ethanol and repeat the wash step while keeping the tubes on the magnet.\nRemove any residual Ethanol and dry beads for maximum 30 s while keeping the cap of the tubes open.\nRemove tubes from the magnet and add 20 μL elution buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) to elute Poly(A)+ RNA from the beads.\nMix well by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nPlace tubes on a magnetic stand and wait until supernatant is clear.\nTransfer supernatant, containing the sample, into clean tubes. Keep tubes on ice until cDNA generation.\nMeasure RNA concentration using Qubit HS RNA assay following manufacturer’s instructions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2984-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fragment analysis of cDNA (after library preparation)",
    "Black line: Poly(A)+ RNA was not size selected, Red line: Poly(A)+ RNA fragments < 1 kb were depleted prior to cDNA preparation. Samples were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer system using the HS NGS Fragment assay reagents. LM/UM: Lower / Upper Marker needed for size calibration.\nOptional: assess size distribution by capillary electrophoresis to visualize small molecule-depleted Poly(A)+ RNA. This control is informative to check whether any RNA degradation occurred in the process. At this point, the loss of small RNA fragments is not yet visible and can be only visualized after cDNA synthesis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCritical: To work with Agencourt RNAClean XP and AMPure XP cleanup magnetic beads, use low binding or low retention filter tips to avoid sample loss. Most plasticware providers offer low retention filter tips that can be used throughout the course of the experiment to avoid sample loss.\nGeneration of cDNA nanopore sequencing library\nTiming: 7 h\nUse the latest cDNA library preparation protocol from Oxford Nanopore https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols[href=https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols].\nNote: To assess online support, a login is required. The link refers to all Oxford Nanopore library preparation protocols. Prior to protocol download, the sequencing instrument must be specified, to include device-specific instructions: https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols[href=https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols]\nDepending on the scale of the experiment and the sequencing platform, choose the workflow with or without sample barcoding and follow the step-by-step protocol (PCR-cDNA Barcoding Kit (SQL-PCB 111.24) or PCR-cDNA Kit (SQK-PCS111). Store reagents of the library preparation kit at −20°C. Expiry dates are printed on each tube. To maximize read length, include the optimized steps detailed below:\nUse 4 ng size-selected Poly(A)+ RNA in 9 μL nuclease-free water (input recommendation of the library preparation kit). Perform multiple preparations in parallel to collect enough material for gel-based size selection.",
    "Split each 20 μL reaction into 4 PCR reactions using 5 μL reverse-transcribed RNA as input.\nAmplify each reaction using the cycling conditions detailed in SQK-PCB111.24 but change the extension time to 16 min (60 s/kb).\nNote: The number of PCR cycles can vary between 10 and 18. We recommend using 16 cycles as a starting point, since enough material for gel-based size selection must be prepared. The number of PCR cycles can negatively impact read length, which results in a decrease of N50 values. In our experiments, we have not reduced PCR cycles below 16, so amplification down to 14 or even 10 cycles should be tested case by case.\nNote: Due to long extension times (16 min/cycle), the PCR will last up to 5 h. We typically set up the PCR overnight and leave the reaction at 4°C prior to AMPure XP clean up.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2984_2.csv\nPool all the processed fractions into a 1.5 mL tube. Clean and size select the sample using AMPure XP beads (upon arrival, aliquot AMPure XP beads into 1 mL aliquots and store at 4°C for up to 18 months) , with bead-to-sample ratio of 0.4.\nNote: after pooling, the volume of the resulting sample to clean up can be relatively high. For instance, if library preparation has been started with four poly(A)+ RNA size selected replicates and each replicate split into four for the PCR step, a volume of 800 μL should be expected (16 samples, 50 μL each). In this example 320 μL of AMPure XP beads have to be used to clean this pool.\nBring AMPure XP beads to room temperature (30 min at 20°C–25°C).\nVortex AMPure XP beads vigorously.\nAdd 20 μL of beads per every 50 μL of sample volume.",
    "Mix sample and AMPure XP beads by vortexing and incubate for 5 min at room temperature to bind cDNA to magnetic beads.\nPlace on a magnetic stand, wait until supernatant is clear.\nRemove and discard supernatant.\nWhile keeping tubes on a magnetic rack, add 200 μL of 80% EtOH (freshly prepared) without disturbing the beads.\nRemove the ethanol and repeat the wash step while keeping the tubes on the magnet.\nRemove any residual Ethanol and dry beads for max. 30 s while keeping the cap of the tubes open. Remove tubes from the magnet and elute amplified cDNA in not more than 30 μL TE buffer.\nMix well by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nPlace tubes on a magnetic stand and wait until supernatant is clear.\nTransfer supernatant containing the size-selected cDNA, into clean tubes. Keep tubes on ice until cDNA generation.\nElute amplified cDNA in not more than 30 μL TE buffer.\nAsses yield (fluorometer) and size distribution (capillary electrophoresis) of amplified, full-length cDNA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nDNA quality control: for quantification, use the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay. For fragment analysis, use the HS NGS Fragment assay (DNF-474-0500, 100–6,000 bp) or the HS Genomic DNA 50 kb Kit (DNF-468-0500, 75–60,000 bp).\nPause point: After library preparation, samples can be stored overnight at 4°C or for up to 4 weeks at –20°C.\nEnrichment of cDNA fragments larger than 3 kb\nTiming: 4 h\nThe BluePippin instrument is an automated DNA size selection system. Using pre-cast gel cassettes with different agarose concentrations, selection of DNA fragments between 100 bp – 50 kb is supported. The section below describes settings for selection of cDNA fragments larger than 3 kb.\nPerform DNA size selection using a 0.75% Agarose Gel Cassette with the external marker DF 3–10 kb S1.",
    "Note: Pre-cast gels are stored at room temperature, provided reagents (marker and electrophoresis buffer) are stored at 4°C. Expiry dates are given on each gel cassette and reagent tube.\nBring DNA sample up to 30 μL in TE buffer (max. 5 μg DNA).\nAdd 10 μL loading solution to each sample and mix samples thoroughly, centrifuge to collect sample.\nProgram a protocol as described in the reference guide of the BluePippin software.\nEnter a base pair threshold (BP Start) for DNA size selection: 3 kb.\nEnter a base pair threshold (BP End) for DNA size selection: 15 kb.\nNote: BP end values do not represent the true upper limit of collection. All fragments > 3 Kb will be collected. The value (BP end) is required for the software to function properly.\nDetermine the lane to which the external marker S1 (3–10 Kb) will be added.\nAfter run completion, wait for 45 min with closed lid to collect 40 μL of the sample out of the cassette and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube (fraction 1).\nPerform a second elution with a 0.1% Tween solution (also provided in the kit). Before pipetting out the second eluate, wait for 10 min and transfer 40 μL of sample into a fresh 1.5 mL tube (fraction 2).\nCritical: Samples are either in a Tris-TAPS buffer (fraction 1) or in 0.1% Tween solution (fraction 2). Both Tris-TAPS buffer and 0.1% Tween are not suitable for nanopore sequencing, therefore the buffer must be exchanged through an AMPure XP cleanup (see step below).\nPerform an additional AMPure XP cleanup.\nCombine cDNA fractions of the same sample and mix by vortexing, with equal volume of AMPure XP beads.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature to bind cDNA to magnetic beads.",
    "Place on a magnetic stand, wait until supernatant is clear.\nRemove and discard supernatant. Elute the cDNA in 12 μL Oxford Nanopore elution buffer (EB).\nFor each sample, analyze 1 μL of the amplified cDNA for size, quantity and quality using a Qubit fluorometer and a Fragment Analyzer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2984-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Fragment analysis of cDNA (after library preparation)\nBlue line: Amplified cDNA cleaned using 0.4× AMPure beads, Black line: Amplified cDNA size selected using agarose gel on a BluePippin Instrument. Samples were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer system using the HS NGS Fragment assay reagents (1–6000 bp). RFU: Raw fluorescence value, LM/UM: Lower/Upper Marker needed for size calibration.\nLoading of the nanopore flow cells\nFollow instructions of the PCR-cDNA library preparation kit for adapter ligation, flow cell priming and loading, as well as for data acquisition parameters and basecalling.\nNote: Oxford Nanopore offers sequencing platforms scalable in size. The number of nanopores per flow cell vary and define the maximal output measured in number of reads or number of sequenced bases. SpotON flow cells (compatible with MinION and GridION devices) hold 512 active nanopores and, on average, 10 GB data can be produced per run. PromethION flow cells (compatible with PromethION devices) hold 5000 nanopores and can produce an average of 100 GB of data per run. Based on our experience, one million reads with an average size of 3 Kb (3 GB of data) is sufficient to detect a significant number of genes and couplings (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Therefore, either MinION, GridION, or PromethION instruments can be used. Sequencing on a PromethION platform is typically the most cost-efficient since the price per GB sequenced data is comparably lower and sample multiplexing is also more feasible.\nLoad samples. Instructions differ for GridION/MinION or PromethION sequencing platforms:",
    "For PromethION flow cells, load 15–25 fmols of (barcoded) amplified cDNA in 23 μL Elution Buffer from Nanopore.\nFor SpotON flow cells (GridION and MinION) load 15–25 fmols of (barcoded) amplified cDNA in 11 μL Elution Buffer from Nanopore.\nFor Mass to Moles conversion of dsDNA, the following webpage is useful: https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/-!/dsdnaamt[href=https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/-!/dsdnaamt].\nNote: Oxford Nanopore released R10.4 flow cells on 01/2023, improving read accuracy. Up to now, not all kits are compatible with the newly released flow cells. SQK-PCB111.24/SQK-PCS111 library preparation kits are currently only compatible with previously used R9.4.1 flow cells.\nAfter sequencing, the mapped reads should show a clearly shifted size distribution compared to the non-size selected samples (for an example, see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2984-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Histogram representing the read lengths from long-read sequencing data before and after the size selection procedure\nNote that the increase in longer reads corresponds to the threshold used for size selection."
