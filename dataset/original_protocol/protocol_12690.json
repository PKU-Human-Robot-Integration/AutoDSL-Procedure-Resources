    "1. Preparation of S2 Cells for Treatment with RNAi\nFrom a stock culture of confluent pMT:GFP:CID and pMT:mCherry:α-tubulin stably transfected S2 cells (~80% viable; grown at 24-28 ˚C), seed cells in a 6 well sterile culture plate at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL in fresh, warmed, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented Schneider’s insect media (SIM).\n\tNOTE: Stably transfected S2 cells can be generated by following a protocol from the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center (DRSC) (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/Protocols?tab=cells). Although the specific stable S2 line used herein utilizes GFP and mCherry, numerous alternatives exist both within these fluorescent spectra as well as others. A detailed discussion of these fluorescent proteins is beyond the scope of this protocol, but their properties and potential advantages/disadvantages have been expertly reviewed elsewhere 11.\n\t\nUsing a cell counter or hemocytometer, determine the density of confluent cell stock.\nDetermine the volume of confluent cell suspension necessary to achieve 1 x 106 cells/mL in a total volume of 4 mL (e.g., ~4 x 106 total cells). Add this volume of cell stock to a volume of fresh SIM to make 4 mL/well total volume. Determine the density of the cell stock (cells/mL) by diluting 100 μL of cells directly from the stock flask with 100 μL of media and counting this 1:2 dilution either manually with a hemocytometer or with an automatic cell counter if available.\nNOTE: If using S2 cells not stably transfected, a transient transfection assay with fluorescently tagged (GFP, mCherry, etc.) α- or β-tubulin, and a DNA marker (CENP-A, Histone H2B, etc.) can be performed. Further, stably transfected cell lines with various mitotic spindle and DNA markers are available from the Drosophila Genetics Resource Center that may better suit the exact experimental needs of the user (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/cells/Catalog).",
    "Place freshly seeded cells into 24-28 ˚C incubator for 36-48 h.\n2. Treatment of Seeded Cells with dsRNA Against Gene(s) of Interest\nNOTE: The following example and Results section will use Shortstop (Shot), an actin-microtubule crosslinking agent as the gene of interest. Use a mock treatment with no dsRNA or with dsRNA directed against an irrelevant gene (e.g., beta-galactosidase, lacZ) as a negative control.\nWarm Schneider’s insect media not supplemented with FBS (Serum free media; SFM) in 24-28 ˚C incubator.\nTransfer cells from the previously seeded well (from step 1.1.2) into a 15 mL sterile tube, noting the total volume of cells transferred.\nRetain a small volume of cells (~100 µL) for counting in a cell counter or hemocytometer.\nGently pellet cells by centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\n\t\nWhile centrifuging cells, determine the concentration of cells per mL using a cell counter or hemocytometer. Multiply this number by the total volume being centrifuged (noted in 1.2.2.) to obtain the total number of cells.\nAspirate the supernatant from the pelleted cells.\nRe-suspend the cells in warmed SFM to obtain a concentration of 3 x 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer 1 mL of the resuspended cells to a new well in a 6 well plate.\nAdd 10-50 µg of dsRNA (diluted in 100 μL of RNAase-free water) against Shot (or the target gene of interest) directly to the cells and swirl the plate to mix. Incubate the plate for 1 h in the 24-28 ˚C incubator to allow for direct dsRNA uptake into cells.\nDuring the 1 h incubation, warm the 10% FBS supplemented SIM in the 24-28 ˚C incubator.\nAfter incubating cells with dsRNA for 1 h, add 2 mL of 10 % FBS supplemented SIM directly to the well without removing the 1 mL of media.",
    "Place cells into 24-28 ˚C incubator for 3-7 days.\nNOTE: As with dsRNA concentration, total treatment time may need to be optimized for the desired target gene. To evaluate RNAi efficacy, perform a western blot on the whole cell lysates using an antibody against the target gene. If the initial dsRNA target sequence proves ineffective, designing alternative dsRNAs targeted to unique sequences within the target gene.\n3. Induction of Fluorescent Protein Expression and Preparation of Cells for Imaging\nIf stably transfected cells were generated using the pMT plasmid (containing an inducible metallothionein promotor) as described here, induce expression of fluorescent proteins by treating cells with copper sulfate (CuSO4) at a final concentration of 500 µM for 24-36 h prior to imaging and 4 days after RNAi treatment. Use of constitutive expression plasmids such as pAct does not require copper induction.\nPrepare Cells for Imaging\nWarm the 10% FBS supplemented SIM in the 24-28 ˚C incubator for 1 h.\nTransfer cells into a 15 mL sterile tube, noting the total volume of cells transferred.\n\t\t\nRetain a small volume of cells (~100 µL) for counting in a cell counter or hemocytometer.\nGently pellet cells by centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\n\t\t\nWhile centrifuging cells, determine the concentration (cells/mL) using a cell counter or hemocytometer. Multiply this number by the total volume being centrifuged (noted in 2.2.2.) to obtain the total number of cells.\nAspirate the supernatant from the pelleted cells.\nResuspend the cells in fresh, warmed 10% FBS supplemented SIM to obtain a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL. Add an appropriate amount of CuSO4 to maintain 500 µM concentration.",
    "Transfer 200-500 µL of re-suspended cells to one well of a multi-well live cell chamber and place on the inverted fluorescent microscope. Allow the cells to settle in the chamber for 15-30 min prior to imaging experiments.\nNOTE: Live cell chamber wells can be pre-coated with poly-L-lysine for additional adherence.\n4. Set Up a Live Cell Imaging Program\nNOTE: Live Cell Imaging in this experiment was performed using an inverted imaging system and its associated software (e.g., Olympus IX83 with the cellSens Dimensions software package). Details will differ by microscope manufacturer and software package; thus, general guidelines and operations are listed below.\nUsing the software that runs the inverted fluorescent microscope, prepare a program for imaging a cell (or cells) over time.\nOpen the software by double-clicking on the software desktop icon.\nCreate a new experimental file by clicking File, then New experimental file.\nFirst, insert a time lapse loop over which images will be taken. Do this by clicking the Stopwatch icon (Time-lapse Loop icon) from the icon bar. Set the interval in s in the Experiment Manager tab, and then set the number of cycles in the same tab by dividing the desired overall experiment length (in s) by the interval. Allow the loop to repeat over the desired total time period.\nNOTE: Typically, images are taken every 30-60 s over a period of 3-4 h.\nWithin the time lapse loop layer, insert an infrared focus check to maintain the focus of the objective (if available). To do this, add a Z-drift Compensation (ZDC) step within the Time-lapse Loop layer by clicking on the Square with Two Arrows icon (Move XY icon) and selecting Z-Drift Compensation from the dropdown menu.",
    "NOTE: The term infrared focus check refers to a system by which an infrared pulse is used to maintain a constant distance between the objective and the slide/imaging chamber. Many microscopes have such a system, each with their own proprietary nomenclature. Readers should consult their operation manual or representative for specific naming details.\nAfter the infrared focus check, add a step in the program to take a multichannel image (e.g., FITC for GFP and TRITC for mCherry) over a 3-5 z-stacks by first inserting a z stack step, then specifying the channel. Do this by adding a Multichannel Group layer within the Time-lapse loop layer by clicking on the Color Wheel icon (Multichannel Group icon). Next, add a Z-Stack Loop layer within the Multichannel Group layer by clicking on the 3-layered icon (Z-stack loop icon). Set the desired Step Size and Number of Slices in the Experiment Manager tab and set the exposure of each channel as low as possible to minimize photobleaching.\nNOTE: The z-stack interval, exposure time, and percent transmittance for LEDs can vary. Typical in these experiments, use three z-stacks taken over a range of 3 µm, giving an interval of 1 µm between each stack. Defining the center of the cell rather than the top and bottom tends to lead to the best results. Images are then collected for each channel(s) at an exposure of 50 ms and percent transmittance of 50% with no neutral density (ND) filter engaged.\n5. Image Dividing Cells Using Live Cell Imaging Program\nNOTE: S2 cells do not require CO2 and grow optimally at 23-27 °C. All imaging was performed at ambient temperature in a well-controlled room.",
    "Using the oculars, find the top (or bottom) corner of the well and focus the objective (40-60x oil immersion) onto the cells using the mCherry (α-tubulin) channel.\nScan along the top (or bottom) of the well to move away from the vertical well divider.\nNOTE: Imaging too close to the well dividers can interfere with infrared focus checks.\nFind a cell (or cells) that are in late G2 or early M-phase (prophase).\nNOTE: These cells can be best identified by the existence of exactly two ‘star-like’ microtubule structures (centrosomes) and an intact nucleus (indicated by a circular region of refracted light within the cell), both easily distinguished using the α-tubulin (red) excitation filter. Selection of cells in earlier interphase, notable by one or zero easily visible centrosomes, can result in wasted time due to a lag in G2/M progression. Conversely, selection of cells after NEBD will prevent accurate calculation of mitotic timing and imaging of early spindle assembly and chromosome dynamics. Also, S2 cells often contain >2 centrosomes. Although these typically clusters into a bipolar spindle12, it is advised that users avoiding these cells unless otherwise desired for the experimental design. Images and discussion of appropriate cells to select can be found in the Representative Results section.\nClick the Live view button to begin viewing cells in the software screen. Using the fine focus knob of the microscope, focus the cell (or cells) of interest. Set the infrared focus check by clicking the Set Focus button.\nInitiate the time lapse imaging program by clicking the Start button. Adjust the histograms as needed by selecting the desired channel and adjusting the mean pixel intensities to see the cell (or cells) of interest clearly.",
    "Allow the program to run, checking the cell after 15-20 min to ensure nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) has occurred, which is determined by the disappearance of the round dark, a refracted spot near the cell center.\nContinue allowing the program to run, checking intermittently (every 15-20 min) to determine once anaphase onset has occurred. Stop the program at this point if there is more time remaining in the total time period and save the file. Alternatively, if events during telophase and cytokinesis are of interest, allow the program to run a sufficient time in order to image these processes as well.\nPerform analysis of NEBD to anaphase onset timing by noting the time of NEBD (t­NEBD) in min and the time of initial chromosome separation (tanaphase onset) in min and subtracting t­NEBD from tanaphase onset to obtain the NEBD to anaphase onset time for a given cell.\nDo this by clicking the frame up button and noting the frames where NEBD and anaphase onset occur, subtracting these to determine the total number of elapse frames, and multiplying this by the time interval between imaging frames.\nContinue scanning for pre-dividing cells to obtain multiple n’s for a given condition. Cells can be imaged in the live cell chamber well for up to 12 h after their initial settling."
