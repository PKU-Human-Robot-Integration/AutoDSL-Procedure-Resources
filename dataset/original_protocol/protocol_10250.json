    "1. Preparation of Materials for Hydrogel Synthesis\nPrepare stock solutions of PEGDA, lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP), and fibronectin under sterile conditions and based on calculations (Table 1A).\nWeigh out and dissolve compounds in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Typically, maintain PEGDA working solution concentrations between 50 and 200 mg/mL (5-20% weight/volume). Pipette the PEGDA solution through a 0.22-µm syringe filter for sterilization.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the PEGDA solutions covered with a foil wrapping to protect them from light. Prepare a fresh solution of PEGDA (recommended) for each experiment.\nReconstitute fibronectin protein powder based on the manufacturer's recommendation. Maintain the fibronectin stock solution at 1 mg/mL, aliquot it into 60 to 100 µL aliquots, and store them at -20 °C until use. Defrost the aliquots at 4 °C for several hours or overnight before use. If protein stock is not already provided in sterile conditions, use a 0.22 µm syringe filter for sterilization.\n\t\tNOTE: Fibronectin is used for cell attachment. Other ECM proteins can be substituted.\nWeigh out LAP for the stock solution and dissolve it in PBS; a typical stock concentration is 25 mg/mL. Sonicate if there is any trouble with dissolving. Pass the solution through a 0.22 µm filter for sterilization. Cover the LAP with a foil wrapping and keep it at 4 °C for up to several months.\n\t\tNOTE: LAP is the photoinitiator used for the photochemistry.\nPrepare sterile glass slide molds for hydrogel formation.\nAutoclave a polyester sheet; one is needed for each gel mold. Soak two glass slides and three plastic spacers (0.5 mm thick) for each gel mold in 70% ethanol for at least 2 h, but generally allow them to soak overnight. Soak five binder clips for each gel mold in 70% ethanol for 10 min prior to use.",
    "Place the glass slides, spacers, and binder clips onto a small autoclaved sheet in the cell culture hood to allow them to air dry for several hours.\nPrepare hydrogel molds by placing plastic spacers around the edge of a glass slide. Place the second glass slide on top. Secure the spacers tightly next to each other with binder clips, two on each long side and one on top.\n\t\tNOTE: If this is not properly assembled, the gel solution will leak out.\nSurface-sterilize the mold with cell culture hood UV light for 30 min prior to use. Halfway through, flip the mold to expose both surfaces.\n2. Modifying Proteins with a Free Thiol\nPrepare stock solutions using calculations from the spreadsheet for converting amine into thiol on proteins (Table 1A).\nTo make the reaction buffer, adjust the PBS to pH 8 and add 5 mM EDTA. Pipette reaction buffer into a 0.22 µm syringe filter for sterilization.\n\t\tNOTE: EDTA is important, as it protects thiols from forming disulfide bonds. Thiol groups must remain in their reduced form for the reaction to occur.\nWeigh out 2-iminothiolane (Traut's Reagent) and dissolve it in reaction buffer for a stock solution concentration of 2 mg/mL (14 mM). Pass the solution through a 0.22-µm syringe filter for sterilization. Store the stock solution at 4 °C for up to several months.\n\t\tNOTE: 2-iminothiolane is the molecule that reacts with solvent-exposed free amines on the proteins and converts them into free thiols.\nReconstitute the protein in reaction buffer at a concentration between 0.1 and 1 mg/mL. Unless previously sterile, pipette this solution through a 0.22-µm syringe filter for sterilization.\n\t\tNOTE: This protein is the biochemical signal that will be patterned onto the hydrogel surface. Also, while protein concentrations can vary, higher concentrations are ideal for stronger protein patterns.",
    "React the protein with 2-iminothiolane by mixing both stock solutions together; use Table 1B to calculate the correct volume ratio. Typically, use a molar ratio of 8:1 2-iminothiolane to protein.\n\tNOTE: For larger proteins or more dilute concentrations, use a higher molar ratio of 2-iminothiolane. Refer to the manufacturer's protocol15.\nIncubate the reaction for 1 h at room temperature. Use a desalting spin micro-column to remove the thiolated protein product from the remaining reactants, following the manufacturer's protocol16.\n\tNOTE: The exclusion limit of this resin is 5 KDa.\nUse Ellman's Assay to quantitatively measure the number of free thiols per protein. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the assay17.\n3. Hydrogel Formation\nCreate the gel precursor solution based on values calculated from Table 1C. Mix together the PEGDA, fibronectin, and LAP volumes. Pipette the solution vigorously to ensure a homogenous solution, but avoid creating bubbles. Keep the solution protected from light.\nPipette the gel precursor solution carefully between the two glass slides of the gel mold. Typically, add a volume between 800 and 1,000 µL to the mold. Expose the gel solution in the mold to UV light (wavelength: 365 nm, power: 3-4 mW/cm2) for 1-2 min to form the hydrogel.\n\tNOTE: Do not expose the hydrogel to prolonged UV light, as it will limit the surface protein patterning capabilities.\nTake off the binder clips and gently remove top glass slide by applying opposite pressure to the two side spacers.\nUse an appropriately sized biopsy punch to cut out the hydrogel samples. Punch out multiple hydrogels from the gel rectangle to serve as replicates and control samples.\n4. Hydrogel Stiffness Measurements\nPunch out hydrogels with an 8 mm-diameter biopsy punch for an 8 mm parallel plate rheometer. Load one hydrogel sample into the rheometer (see the Table of Materials).",
    "Lower the parallel plate geometry that is 8 mm in diameter until making contact with the surface of the gel. Keep a gap distance of 0.5 mm for a 0.5 mm-thick hydrogel sample.\nPerform time sweeps for 5 min at 0.1% strain, 0.1 Hz frequency, and 37 °C. Average the G' values across each time sweep. Run independent hydrogels for replicates of each composition.\n\tNOTE: The G' values should be stable across time points; if they are not, percent strain and frequency sweeps should be performed to select the appropriate values14.\n5. Protein Patterning\nPrepare the desired pattern for the photomask using a computer aided design (CAD) program. Print the photomask on a transparent sheet using a high-resolution printer. Soak the photomask in 70% ethanol for 10 min prior to use. Allow the photomask to air dry in a cell culture hood before use.\nAdd the thiolated protein solution prepared in step 2 to the surface of the hydrogel for surface patterning. Pipette 1-2 µL/cm2 of thiolated protein solution to the surface of each cut-out gel.\n\tNOTE: It is important to minimize the protein volume; only add enough to evenly cover the entire surface of the hydrogel sample.\nCarefully place the photomask on the surface of the hydrogel. Do not allow air bubbles between the photomask and the hydrogel surface. Gently press down on the mask to remove any bubbles that form.\nExpose the hydrogel to a second round of UV light (wavelength: 365 nm, power: 3-4 mW/cm2) for 30-60 s.\n\tNOTE: It is important to exposure the pattern to enough UV light to create a strong pattern without causing the loss of protein function.",
    "Wash the hydrogels with PBS to remove unreacted species and place each hydrogel within the well plate. Be careful when placing the gels into each well; make sure that the patterned surface is face up. Wash the gels in PBS at 4 °C; gels are stable for at least two weeks at 4 °C.\n6. Preparing Hydrogels for Cell Seeding\nIncubate the gels in basal medium for 5-10 min at 37 °C prior to seeding. For human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), use EGM-2 medium without growth factors. Minimize the volume of medium added to each well to prevent hydrogel floating. For a 48-well plate, use a 250 µL volume of medium.\nSpin down the plate at 300 x g for 3 min to ensure that the hydrogels are located at the bottom of the well and are not floating. Do this immediately prior to cell seeding.\n7. Cell Seeding on Hydrogels\nUse standard sterile mammalian cell culture procedures for cell seeding and experimental procedures. Remove HUVECs from tissue culture flasks using standard cell detachment protocols. Wash the tissue culture dish with sterile PBS and incubate with trypsin for 3-5 min at 37 °C.\nQuench the trypsinized cell suspension with excess cell medium or trypsin neutralizer solution.\nSpin down the cell suspension in the centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant and keep the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in basal EGM-2 with no growth factors. Use a hemocytometer for cell counting.\nAdd 75,000 cells/cm2 to each hydrogel surface by pipetting slowly into the center of each well so as not to disturb the gels. Place the well plate into a cell culture incubator at 37 °C. For several days, periodically remove the dish for observation.\n8. Evaluation of Bioactivity",
    "Culture E. coli overnight in suspension in LB broth in an orbital suspension at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Spin down the E. coli culture, decant, and reconstitute the cell pellet in minimal volume of PBS. Weigh out the lysozyme and reconstitute at 1 mg/mL for the stock solution.\nPipette a small volume (25 µL) of lysozyme stock solution into microcentrifuge tubes. Add varying levels of LAP photoinitiator (0-12 mM) and expose the samples to 1 min of UV light. In a separate group, add the same amount of LAP (2 mM) to lysozyme solution and expose samples to varying UV light times (0-4 min). Include replicates for each treatment.\nAdd equal volume of concentrated E. coli solution to each lysozyme sample for a final lysozyme protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Incubate the mixed solutions for 4 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This allows time for functional lysozyme to lyse the bacterial cell wall and release proteins into the solution.\nUse untreated lysozyme incubated with E. coli for a positive control; consider this a 100% bioactive measurement. Use lysozyme solution incubated with PBS alone as a negative control.\nSpin down the samples to remove cell debris and keep the supernatant. Run a Bradford assay to quantify the total concentration of protein within the supernatant to measure the amount of bacterial lysate.\nRun a Bradford assay following the manufacturer's protocol18. Calculate the fold change in protein concentration compared to the negative control.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
