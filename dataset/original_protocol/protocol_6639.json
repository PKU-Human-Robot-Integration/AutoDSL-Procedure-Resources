    "Culture of C. elegans malesObtain male worms by applying the heat-shock method (Sulston and Hodgkin, 1988).Place 10 young L4 hermaphrodites on a fresh NGM-agar plate containing E. coli OP50.Seal the plate with Parafilm.Expose the plate to 30 °C for 6 h.Remove the parafilm and place the plate in an incubator at 20 °C for 2-3 days.Check then regularly for the presence of males on the plate. There should be 5-30 male worms on the plate.Transfer as many males as possible to a fresh NGM-agar plate and place 5 L4 hermaphrodites on this plate. Aim to have for 4-5 times more male individuals than hermaphrodites per plate. The progeny of the hermaphrodites should produce ~50% males.Maintain a culture of C. elegans males by transferring ~30 males and 5 L4 hermaphrodites to a fresh plate every three days.Synchronization of male wormsPipette 50 µl of bleaching solution on a fresh NGM-agar plate containing E. coli OP50.Add 10-20 adult hermaphrodites from a male culture plate into the bleaching solution.Incubate the plate for three days at 20 °C.Preparation of agarose padsPrepare about 30 clean glass slides and place them next to each other on the bench (Figure 2A).Prepare 10% (w/v) agarose powder in M9 buffer in a 50 ml Falcon tube (e.g., 0.5 g in 5 ml).Melt the agarose in a microwave with short heating intervals. Open the lid shortly in between the intervals.Caution: Melted agarose is hot; protective gloves should be worn. Use a small spoon or spatula to place a drop of the melted 10% agarose on a glass slide (Figure 2B).Immediately add a second glass slide on top and gently apply pressure for 5 s (Figure 2C).Repeat this procedure until all glass slides have agarose in between.Remove the top slide.Use a round object (e.g.",
    ", cap of a permanent marker) to cut out agarose pads of a defined diameter of 10 mm. For this, select areas that do not contain any or only a few trapped air bubbles. Such bubbles might impair worm immobilization or the image quality later. Multiple agarose pads can be cut out of a single agar preparation (Figure 2D).Grab each agarose pad with fine tweezers and put it to a small container (e.g., empty plate) filled with M9 buffer (Figure 2E). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201012/20201012194053_9947.jpgFigure 2. Immobilization of worms for live-imaging using agarose pads and Polystyrene beads. A. Arrangement of glass slides on the laboratory bench. This way, agarose pads can be produced quickly before the agarose starts to solidify. B. Placing of melted agarose on one glass slide using a small spoon. C. Placing of a second glass slide on top of the agarose droplet and simultaneously application of pressure until the agarose is solid (~5 s). D. Excision of an agarose pad (diameter of about 10 mm) using a cap of a permanent marker. E. Transfer of the agarose pad with a fine tweezer to M9 buffer until further use. F. Placing of the agarose pad on a glass slide to start a live-cell experiment and removal of excess of liquid from the side with a piece of filter paper. G. Application of a Polystyrene-bead solution (bead diameter 0.1 µm) to the top of the agarose pad. H. After addition of worms, a cover slip was placed on top of the agarose pad. Afterwards, a few microliters of M9 buffer were added to avoid dehydration of the animals. I. Sealing of the cover slip with candle wax and imaging of the slide using fluorescence microscopy.Store agarose pads for several days in M9 buffer at 4 °C until further use.",
    "However, best results for worm immobilization are achieved with freshly prepared agarose pads.Live-imaging of meiotic spindles in male worms using fluorescent markersSelect an agarose pad, place it with tweezers in the middle of a new glass slide. Be careful not to damage the surface of the agarose pad as this will reduce the immobilization effect on individual worms.Aspirate excess of liquid from the side of the agarose pad with a piece of filter paper (Figure 2F). Be careful not to touch the surface of the agarose pad as also cellulose fibers on the surface of the pad will reduce the immobilization of worms.Add 1 µl of a polystyrene bead solution on the agarose pad (Figure 2G).Place 5-10 three-day old male worms within the bead solution.Gently add a cover slip (Figure 2H). It is important to lower the covers slip gently as a dropping of the glass might damage the worms or activate spermatids within the males. A sliding of the mounted cover glass should also be avoided as this might impair the worms as well. If worms are still moving after the assembly procedure, discard the sample and start again with point no. 1.Add a few microliters of M9 buffer from the side under the cover slip. Be careful not to add too much as excess liquid will make the cover slip float and decrease the amount of immobilization.Seal the edges of the cover slip with melted candle wax (Figure 2I).Check again under a dissection microscope if the worms are immobile. If worms are perfectly immobilized at this point, they will not become mobile again, thus long-term imaging will be possible by using the settings described below.Place the prepared sample on a fluorescence microscope.Select a fully immobilized worm for imaging. Start image acquisition.",
    "Samples can be imaged for about 90 min without any detectable effects on cell division. Typically, z-stacks are recorded on a confocal spinning disk microscope in two fluorescence channels with an image stack every 30 s containing about 60 planes (0.33 µm z-spacing). For the analysis of spindle dynamics, use a worm strain expressing γ-tubulin::GFP and histone H2B::mCherry in the germ line. With a 60x water immersion objective (N.A.: 1.2), we generated images with a voxel size of 0.222 x 0.222 x 0.33 µm. As the specifications among microscopes and lasers can vary, it is not possible here to give absolute values for the laser power to be used. It is advisable to assess the degree of photobleaching after one hour by comparing the signal intensities in the recorded images at the beginning and at the end of data acquisition. If the signal is bleached very fast or cells stop dividing, reduce the laser power or the exposure time per frame. Then check, if the signal/noise ratio in a new recording allows to detect specific signals. This process needs to be repeated iteratively until the optimal imaging settings for the specific microscope have been determined.Image pre-processingImport the Z-stacks to ImageJ/Fiji. A user manual for ImageJ/Fiji can be found here[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf].Convert them to a hyperstack.Correct for bleaching using the method “Exponential fit”.Save images.Image processingImport images into arivis Vision4D (Figure 3A).Crop out and export individual meiotic cells from the meiotic region of the male gonad (Figure 3B).Make a note in which frame anaphase starts.Use a 3D median filter with a kernel size of 1 pixel (Figure 3C) to reduce the noise.Segment individual centrosomes in each meiotic cell with the tool “Blob finder” (Figure 3D). The settings have to be chosen in accordance to the used imaging setup.",
    "As the image quality varied among the live recordings the segmentation settings had to be adjusted within a narrow range. Typically, we used the following settings for the “Blob Finder” tool: diameter: 1 µm, threshold: 10-20, split sensitivity: 85-95.Track the segments over time using the tool “Track segments”. Typically, we used the following settings: type: “Brownian motion”, max. distance: 2-4 µm.Edit and combine tracks in order to have one track connecting the individual centrosomes over time using the tool “Track editor”.Export a Microsoft Excel file containing the x, y and z coordinates of the geometric center of mass of each of the segmented centrosomes.Create a semicolon-delimited CSV-file for the first centrosome track, containing in each line the x, y, and z coordinate of the center of mass each time point.Create analogously a second CSV-file for the second centrosome track.Use a custom-made Python script to reorient (Watt, 1999) and resample the image data in order to create a kymograph along the spindle axis with a defined radius for each fluorescence channel (Figure 3F, https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/50988/elife-50988-code1-v4.py[href=https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/50988/elife-50988-code1-v4.py]).Give the path to both CSV-files containing the coordinates of the center of the centrosomes (PATH).Indicate which fluorescence channel should be processed (CHANNEL).Indicate the frame of the data set that should be used as a start (START_FRAME; typically, this was ten time points before the frame of anaphase onset).Indicate the pixel size in the resampled output data set (LINE_PIXEL_SIZE; typically 0.1 µm was used).Indicate the radius around the spindle axis that is used to calculate the fluorescence pixel values within the kymograph (LINE_RADIUS; typically a ‘9’ was used, which means a radius of 0.9 µm around the spindle axis, given that the pixel size was set to 0.1 µm).Indicate the length of extrapolation along the spindle axis after the start and end coordinate (LINE_EXTRAPOLATE, typically 1.",
    "0 µm before and after the centrosome centers was added to each kymograph).Define an output filename for the kymograph CSV-file (OUTPUT_FILENAME).Calculate the Gaussian weighted sum of fluorescence (Burger and Burge, 2013) in each plane in 0.1 µm steps along the spindle axis with a radius of 0.9 µm (Figure 3G). This was repeated for all time points (Figure 3H) and the kymograph was saved as an image (Figure 4A) and a csv-file.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201012/20201012194308_4210.jpgFigure 3.

A selected area (indicated by a yellow box) is exported to a new file. Scale bar, 5 µm. B. Exported spindle as indicated in (A). C. Exported data after application of a 3D median filter (kernel size: 1 pixel). This algorithm removes the noise in the image while preserving the edges of structures. D.

The individual segmented spindle poles were traced over time as represented by lines on each pole. For 16 time points of the recording, white lines show the 3D position of the poles in the ‘past’ and gray lines the ‘future’ positions. F. Image showing a rotated and resampled spindle. Yellow dots indicate the center of mass of the segmented spindle poles. G. The volume that is used to assemble a kymograph is indicated by a box (green). Numbers in the coordinate system in (E-G) show distances in µm. H. Projections of the exported volumes at different time points that were used for the calculation of kymographs. Scale bar, 1 µm.",
    "Analyze the kymograph for each fluorescence channel to determine the position of the peak intensity from both sides of the spindle over time (Figures 4B-4C).Calculate the distance of the peak intensities for each channel over time. This way, the autosome-to-autosome distance (Figure 4D) and the pole-to-pole distance (Figure 4E) can be calculated. In addition, the pole-to-autosome distance (Figure 4F) can also be determined by calculating the distance of the peak intensities from both fluorescence channels on each side of the spindle.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201012/20201012194326_6519.jpgFigure 4.
