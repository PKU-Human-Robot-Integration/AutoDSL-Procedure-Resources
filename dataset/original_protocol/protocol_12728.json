    "1. Assembly of Artificial Elongation Complexes and Pol II Walking\nImmobilize 1 nmol of non-template DNA oligo containing a 3’ biotin molecule on magnetic beads.\n\tNOTE: The following steps can be done in advance to prepare for future experiments. All oligo sequences used in this protocol are provided in Table 1. RNA oligos are synthesized with 5’-triphosphate modifications.\n\t\nAdd 200 µL of magnetic beads (10 mg/mL) to a low-protein binding 1.5 mL tube, and then place on a magnetic rack for 2 min.\nWhile the tube is on the magnetic rack, remove the liquid from the tube without disturbing the beads. To wash the beads, remove the tube from the rack, add 1 mL of 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, return the tube to the rack, and remove the wash solution after 2 min.\nRepeat washes 2 more times using 200 µL of the same buffer.\nResuspend magnetic beads in 400 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, buffer. Then mix with 380 µL of H2O and 20 µL of 10 µM non-template biotinylated DNA oligo. Place the tube on a nutator and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash immobilized non-template DNA oligo 3 times with 200 µL of 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, and then 3 times with 200 µL of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin.\nLeave tube overnight at 4 °C to finish blocking beads with BSA.",
    "The next day, place the tube in the magnetic rack, remove and discard the liquid, and resuspend beads in 200 µL of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin and transfer to a new tube. For this DNA template, final concentration is approximately 5 µM.\nNOTE: Incubation time and oligo concentration need to be empirically determined for each biotinylated DNA oligo. This template should provide enough for 200 reactions, and last at least 6 months when stored at 4 °C.\nAnneal RNA and DNA template strand oligonucleotide oligos in a 2:1 molar ratio (20 and 10 pmol, respectively) to obtain the DNA:RNA duplex.\nSet up a 10 µL annealing mix as described in Table 2.\nNOTE: 10 µL of annealing mix are sufficient for 10 reactions. The annealing mix can be scaled up as needed if more assays are to be performed.\nPerform the annealing reactions in a thermal cycler using the following program: 5 min at 45 °C, followed by 12 cycles of 2 min each, starting at 43 °C and decreasing the temperature 2 °C per cycle. Idle at 4 °C.\nNOTE: This is a flexible timepoint. Annealing is finished within ~30 min but can be left at 4 °C for a longer period. In the lab, annealing mixtures have been left sitting for up to 4 h without observing any decrease in reaction efficiency.",
    "While annealing RNA to the template strand DNA, prepare buffers for later steps of the protocol. The ingredients needed to prepare each buffer for a single reaction with each buffer are listed in Tables 2 to 8. Scale up recipes by a factor of [Y(X+1) + 1] for Wash and (X+1) for all other buffers. X = number of reactions to be prepared; Y = number of washing steps needed (minimum 3).\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare all buffers fresh the day of the experiment. Do not place tubes on ice after PVA has been added to buffers. Add Pol II or nucleotides to buffers right before using.\nLoad purified RNA polymerase II onto the DNA:RNA hybrid.\nMix 1 pmol (1 µL) of DNA:RNA duplex with 13 µL of Pol II buffer (from Table 3).\nAdd ~0.02 units of purified RNA Pol II (1 µL) to the mixture from step 1.3.1 and mix by gently pipetting up and down and stirring with pipet tip, without introducing bubbles. Incubate for 10 min at 30 °C.\nNOTE: Volumes given from here on are for a single reaction; scale up as needed for the number of reactions in the experiment. RNA Pol II purified from rat liver as described10 is used in this example; however, RNA Pol II purified from other sources, including cultured mammalian cells or yeast can also be used3,4,5,11,12,13.\nComplete the elongation complex by addition of biotinylated non-template DNA.\nAdd 5 pmol (1 µL) of immobilized non-template DNA oligo to 14 µL of non-template DNA buffer (from Table 4), add to tube from step 1.3.2, and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nPlace the sample in magnetic rack for 2 min. Wash 1x with 30 µL of wash buffer (from Table 7) to remove unincorporated Pol II and oligos.",
    "Generate elongation complexes containing radiolabeled RNA 23mers.\nPerform all further incubations at 30 °C. Add 1 µL of 15 µM ATP and 10 µCi (1 µL) of [α-32P] UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) to 23 µL of Pulse buffer and use this to resuspend washed magnetic beads.\nCAUTION: Radioactive material is hazardous. Make sure to wear appropriate protective equipment and to follow all lab guidelines for safe use and disposal of radioactive material.\nNOTE: Replace radiolabeled UTP with 15 µM UTP when radiolabeled RNA is not needed, such as for western blot experiments.\nIncubate the reaction for 10 min to allow the synthesis of radiolabeled 23mers.\nAdd 1.5 µL of solution containing 100 µM ATP and 100 µM UTP mix to 3.5 µL of chase buffer, add to tube containing preassembled elongation complexes, and incubate for 5 min to chase all nascent transcripts into 23mers.\nPlace the sample in magnetic rack for 2 min, remove the supernatant, wash once with 30 µL of wash buffer to remove unincorporated nucleotides, and resuspend in 30 µL of wash buffer.\nEither add 94 µL of stop mix with proteinase K and glycogen (Table 9) to terminate reactions or proceed to section 1.6 to generate elongation complexes with longer transcripts or section 2 to perform capping assays.\n(Optional) Walk Pol II to make 23, 25, and 29 nucleotide transcripts\nFollow the procedure described in steps 1.2.1 through 1.5.4 to prepare elongation complexes containing radiolabeled 23mers. Scale up 4-fold to generate 120 µL of washed elongation complexes, which is enough complexes for 4 reactions.\nLabel 3 new tubes “23mer”, “25mer” and “29mer”. Transfer 30 µL of washed elongation complexes to “23mer” tube and add 94 µL of stop mix with proteinase K and glycogen.",
    "Place the tube containing the remaining 90 µL of washed elongation complexes in the magnetic rack for 2 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend beads in 90 µL of BTB supplemented with 1.2 µL each of 1.5 mM ATP and 1.5 mM CTP. Incubate for 10 min at 30 °C.\nAfter washing once with 90 µL of wash buffer and resuspending in 90 μL of wash buffer as described in step 1.5.4, transfer 30 µL of elongation complexes to “25mer” tube and add 94 µL of stop mix with proteinase K and glycogen.\nPlace the tube containing the remaining 60 µL of elongation complexes in the magnetic rack for 2 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend beads in 60 µL of BTB supplemented with 0.8 µL each of 1.5 mM ATP and 1.5 mM CTP.\nIncubate for 10 min at 30 °C, wash once with 60 µL of wash buffer as in section 1.5.5, and resuspend in 60 µL of wash buffer.\nTransfer 30 µL from 2x sample to “29mer” tube and either add 94 µL of stop mix with proteinase K and glycogen or proceed to section 2 to perform capping assays.\nProceed to RNA purification and analysis (Section 3).\n2. Using Artificial Elongation Complexes to Assay Cotranscriptional Capping\nGenerate washed elongation complexes containing 23mers by scaling up the procedure described in steps 1.2.1 through 1.5.5 13-fold. This is enough for 12 reactions + 1 extra.\nPol II CTD phosphorylation\nPlace the tube containing washed elongation complexes in the magnetic rack for 2 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend beads in 377 µL of BTB supplemented with 13 µL of 1.5 mM ATP.",
    "Prepare two new tubes, labeled +H and -H, respectively. To the tube labeled +H add 3 µL of ~300 ng/µL TFIIH, and to the tube labeled -H add 9 µL of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin.\nNOTE: We typically use TFIIH purified from rat liver, but we have obtained similar results using ~0.6 µg/reaction of commercially-available recombinant Cdk7/Cyclin H/MAT1 (CAK, which is the kinase module from TFIIH). See Table of Materials for information.\nAdd 87 µL of the washed elongation complexes from step 2.2.1 to the tube labeled +H and 270 µL of washed elongation complexes to the tube labeled -H. Incubate 10 min at 30 °C.\nPlace sample in magnetic rack for 2 min. To remove excess nucleotides and unbound protein, wash elongation complexes in +H and -H reactions with 90 µL or 270 µL of wash buffer, respectively.\nRNA capping\nResuspend elongation complexes in the tube labeled +H in 87 µL of capping mix (BTB supplemented with 50 µM GTP (Table 10). Resuspend elongation complexes in the tube labeled -H in 261 µL of capping mix.\nPrepare 4 new tubes labeled 5 ng CE+H, 5 ng CE, 15 ng CE, 45 ng CE. Dilute capping enzyme (CE) into 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin to prepare solutions containing 5 ng CE/µL, 15 ng CE/µL, or 45 ng CE/µL and dispense 3 µL of the appropriate solution into each of the 4 tubes.\nPrepare 12 new tubes with 94 µL of stop buffer (2.1.1) added to each.",
    "Start each capping reaction by adding 87 µL of elongation complex treated with TFIIH or not to labeled tubes containing capping enzyme. Incubate at 30 °C in a heat block.\nAfter 1, 2, or 4 min, stop reactions by transferring 30 µL of each reaction mixture to tubes containing 94 µL of stop buffer. Purify and analyze reaction products as described in section 3.\n3. RNA Purification and Analysis\nPurify RNA\nIncubate reaction products in stop buffer for 20 min at room temperature.\nNOTE: Pausing point. Samples in this buffer has been maintained for up to 4 h without loss or degradation of RNA.\nExtract once with 124 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1).\nCAUTION: Phenol is extremely toxic and is rapidly absorbed by the skin. Wear appropriate protective equipment.\nNOTE: To maximize recovery of RNA during extraction, use commercially available tubes containing a high-density gel, which forms a stable barrier between aqueous and organic phases. See Discussion and Table of Materials.\nTransfer the aqueous phase (top layer) to new tubes containing 12.4 µL of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2.\nEthanol precipitation\nAdd 350 µL of 100% ethanol and mix thoroughly by inversion.\nIncubate for at least 10 min on dry ice.\nNOTE: Pausing point. For convenience, one can stop here and complete the procedure on the next day; however, it is possible to proceed directly to step 3.3 and run the gel on the same day. RNA can be kept at -80 °C for a couple of days before further processing, but do not leave for longer times.\nPreparing RNA samples for gel electrophoresis",
    "Allow samples to thaw, mix by inverting 2-3 times, and centrifuge for 15 min at 21,000 x g, 4 °C, in a tabletop centrifuge. Meanwhile, set up denaturing gel mix (section 3.4.1).\nCarefully remove ethanol from samples without disturbing pellet.\nAdd 500 µL of 70% ethanol, invert tube a couple of times to wash pellet, and then centrifuge again at 21,000 x g for 5 min at either room temperature or 4 °C.\nRemove as much ethanol as possible and do a quick spin (5-10 s) of the tubes in a table top centrifuge. Then, with a gel-loading tip, remove the last remaining volume of ethanol.\nAir-dry pellet for 3 min at room temperature.\nDissolve RNA by adding 4 µL of H2O to the top of each pellet. Incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 4 µL of 2x RNA dye (See Table of Materials) to the mix, and then vortex each tube for a couple of seconds to fully resuspend RNA.\nNOTE: RNA dye that contains formamide instead of urea is recommended, since the latter precipitates at low temperatures.\nQuick-spin the tubes, and then incubate them at 70 °C for 10 min in a heat block.\nStore tubes on dry ice until ready to load on gel.\n\t\tNOTE: Keeping RNA on dry ice allows the flexibility to work on other experiments while the gel is polymerizing. Samples do not need to be reheated after thawing. However, RNA can be directly loaded after heating if the gel is ready to run.\nPreparing Urea-PAGE gel",
    "For 40 mL gel mix, combine in a 50 mL conical tube: 16.7 g of urea, 15 mL of 40% bis:acrylamide solution (19:1 ratio), 4 mL of 10x TBE (1 M Tris-HCl, 1 M sodium borate, 20 mM EDTA), and 8 mL of H2O. This volume is sufficient for one standard size gel (18 cm height x 16 cm width) with 1.0 mm spacers.\nCAUTION: Acrylamide is extremely toxic. While there is no inhalation risk when it is in solution, always wear lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses while handling.\nNOTE: This mixture is for casting a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel, which readily resolves RNA between 15-50 nt. Change the concentration of bis/acrylamide as needed to resolve different RNA transcripts of different lengths.\nPlace closed tube containing gel mix on a nutator until urea is fully dissolved.\nSet up gel-casting station with glass plates, 1 mm spacers and a 15-well comb.\nWorking rapidly, add 40 µL of TEMED and 400 µL of 10% ammonium persulfate solution to gel solution and mix well. Using a 25 mL pipet, pour gel solution between plates, insert comb, and allow the gel to polymerize for at least 2 h.\nNOTE: If the gel is poured more than 2 h before use, once it has polymerized cover it with moist paper towel (leaving the comb in place) and wrap with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.\nDenaturing gel RNA electrophoresis\nAfter polymerization, transfer gel to running tank and pre-run it at 20 mA in 1x TBE for 15-30 min.\nMeanwhile, thaw samples (if frozen), vortex, and spin them for 4 min at 2,000 x g, 4 °C.\nWhen ready, turn off the power supply, and carefully rinse each well with 1x TBE using a syringe.",
    "Use gel-loading tips to load samples onto the gel.\nRun gel at a constant 20-30 mA for about 2 h or until lower dye (xylene cyanol FF) reaches the bottom of the gel.\nRemove the gel, place it on a piece of absorbent paper, and wrap with plastic wrap.\nExpose the radiolabeled gel to a phosphorscreen.\nScan phosphorscreen using a phosphorimager and analyze image.\nSubscription Required.
