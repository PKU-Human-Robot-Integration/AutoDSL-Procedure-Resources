    "Specific steps are described below, and outlined in Figures 1 and 3. Figure 2 shows examples of primary data presented as screen shots of actual workflow. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227194018_4255.jpgFigure 1. Overview of steps for gene characterization Mapping the 5’ and 3’ ends of a geneIdentify appropriate RNA-sequencing libraries from the SRA NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra[href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra]). Screen each of these RNA-sequencing libraries with a series of adjacent genomic DNA sequences of ~60 nucleotides (= probes; other lengths could be chosen but 60 nucleotides give consistent results). The probes may be designed to overlap by 5-10 nucleotides, but this is not necessary. Start with areas within known exons and move in either the 5’ or 3’ direction as appropriate for 5’ or 3’ end mapping, respectively (see Figures 3B and 3C). Count number of matching sequences for each probe. Continue the search until the number of matching sequence reads drops below a threshold (e.g., fewer than 10-15) for at least two consecutive probes:Caveat 1: Some DNA sequences with low complexity will not match anything or will match too many different regions. Low complexity sequences will contain long stretches of the same nucleotide or alternating runs of two nucleotides. A key to this problem if many matches are found would be that they map to different regions of the genome rather than to one location. Only the latter would be expected if the transcript of a single gene was detected. Caveat 2: Some genes are not expressed in commonly available tissue RNA samples. How to know when you are done?For 5’ end mapping, the sequences that match within the last probe should end within a few nucleotides of each other. Ideally within a short distance in the further 5’ direction, a proximal promoter element should be identified, such as a TATA box (see Figure 3B).",
    "For 3’ end mapping, the sequences that match within the last probe should end within a few nucleotides of each other. Ideally, a polyadenylation recognition sequence should be found a short distance 5’ to the last expressed nucleotides (see Figure 3C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227194039_1725.jpgFigure 2. Examples of screen shots of primary workflow. A. Screen shot of Blast search of an SRA NCBI RNA sequencing library, SRX501262. The DNA sequence of the probe is shown, along with the RNA sequencing experiment being searched, and various other parameters of the search. Note that the megablast option for highly similar sequences has been selected. B. Screen shot of output from this experiment, illustrating the top 100 sequencing hits in graphical form from a total of 395 matches identified. At the bottom of the figure are descriptions of two of the matches, which may be selected to view the actual alignments of the DNA sequences.How to quantify alternative mRNA splicingIdentify appropriate RNA-sequencing libraries from the SRA NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra[href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra]). Construct two ~60-nucleotide probes:The first in silico probe should contain the last 30 nucleotides from the 3’ end of the last common exon and the first ~30 nucleotides from the beginning of first exon that may be alternatively spliced. The second in silico probe should contain the last 30 nucleotides from the 3’ end of the last common exon and the first ~30 nucleotides from the beginning of second exon that may be alternatively spliced. More probes may be generated using a similar strategy if the possible alternative RNA splicing pattern is more complicated. Screen the same RNA-sequencing libraries with each of these hybrid two-exon probes.",
    "Count the number of matching sequences for each probe, only including those that are identical to regions in both exons that should be adjacent to each other in each alternatively spliced mRNA (see Figure 3D). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227194108_2976.jpgFigure 3. Schematic for gene mapping using data from RNA-sequencing libraries. A. Map of your favorite gene (Yfg) as found in the Ensembl and UCSC genome databases. The gene contains four exons and appears to lack identified 5’ or 3’ UTRs in exons 1 and 4, respectively. Below the gene map predicted Yfg transcripts and characterized Yfg proteins are shown indicating that alternative RNA splicing is responsible for two distinct protein isoforms. B. Diagram of full-length Yfg exon 1, which was mapped using gene expression data from an RNA-sequencing library found in the SRA NCBI by using 60-bp genomic segments a-g as probes to screen the library. The DNA sequence below the graph illustrates the putative 5’ end of exon 1, with the location of the longest RNA-sequencing clones indicated by an arrow. A possible TATA box is underlined. C. Diagram of full-length Yfg exon 4, which was mapped using the approach shown in B, using probes a-g as illustrated. The DNA sequence below the graph shows the putative 3’ end of Yfg exon 4. A potential polyadenylation signal is underlined and a vertical arrow depicts the likely 3’ end of Yfg transcripts, which was identified as the location of the longest RNA-sequencing clones. D. Defining alternative RNA splicing in Yfg gene expression by screening RNA-sequencing libraries from different tissues, using as probes 60-bp fragments derived from exons 1 and 3 (3’ 30-bp from exon 1 joined to the 5’ 30-bp from exon 3) or exons 1 and 3 (3’ 30-bp from exon 1 fused with the 5’ 30-bp from exon 3).
