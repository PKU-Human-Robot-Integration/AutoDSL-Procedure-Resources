    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProtein electroporation\nHere, we provide a protocol for electroporation of protein into cells. For establishing parameters that yield high electroporation efficiency, we recommend first optimizing the cell line for electroporation by using an inert fluorescent standard, such as dextran. After electroporation conditions are optimized with the standard, the protein of interest can then be introduced by co-loading with dextran (step 1, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Labeling the protein of interest highly increases the possibilities for quantification of its delivery (steps 4–6), however labeling could interfere with protein function. If the protein is unlabeled, electroporation efficiency can be established by performing labeling the cells with antibodies against the protein of interest. For CAD cells, a semi-confluent 10 cm dish (approximate 1×106 cells) yields enough cells for the equivalent of two electroporations or a 10 μL suspension of Total Cell Volume (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). For each condition, “Total Volume” reflects the amount needed for two electroporations. This technique minimizes electroporation variability. We found it best to maintain the same volume of electroporation buffer (buffer R) across different protein concentrations (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for example protocol).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_413_2.csv\nTiming: 2 h, 30 min\nTransfecting cells with fluorescent dextran or protein\nTake cell culture media and 6-well plate with laminin-coated coverslips out of the incubator. Under sterile conditions, remove the DPBS and add 2 mL of pre-warmed media to each well of a 6 well plate. Place the plate back in the incubator.\nThaw dextran or protein on ice in the dark (e.g., covered with foil). If delivering protein, first preclarify by centrifugation (>100,000 × g, 20 min) to remove aggregates. For an example of co-electroporation with protein and dextran see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nAdd the required buffer volumes (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].) in sterile 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Harvest cells from (3) 60%–80% confluent 10 cm dishes by trypsinization (1.5 mL, 500 μL/dish, 3 min).\nNote: Alternately, cells could be harvested with a cell scraper.\nInhibit trypsin with (6 mL, 2 mL/dish) 8% FBS in DMEM/F12 media.\nCombine harvested cells into one 15 mL falcon tube and gently centrifuge (150 × g, 3 min) to remove trypsin.\nWash pellet in DPBS (3 mL) being careful to at least dislodge or fully resuspend the pellet upon DPBS addition.\nCentrifuge as before, add DPBS, and then remove DPBS. Repeat 1×.\nRemove 6-well plate from incubator.\nAdd dextran/protein to total electroporation volume.\nRemove DPBS then resuspend pellet gently in the minimal amount of electroporation buffer R. For example, for six electroporations with 10 μL of cell suspension per electroporation, the minimal amount needed would be 65 μL to provide enough volume to minimize bubble formation. We recommend adding an additional electroporation’s worth of cell suspension (10 μL) in case of arcing, an additional 10 μL for counting, and an additional 10 μL for the non-electroporation control. Gently mix the cell suspension so cells are evenly distributed.\nUse 10 μL of cell volume to count cells, cells should be in the range of 3–5 × 106 cells/ mL. Dilute in buffer R if cell count is too high.\nAdd 10 μL of total cell suspension volume to each Eppendorf tube using a 20 μL pipette tip. Stir the solution once gently with a pipette tip and then mix by pipetting up and down once, taking care to avoid bubble formation.",
    "Draw the solution into one 10 μL Neon Pipette Tip (Thermo Fisher). Tip should then be inverted to visualize any air bubbles. If bubbles have formed, dispense suspension back in the Eppendorf tube and redraw. If bubbles still remain, pulse centrifuge and resuspend.\nUse one single 1,400 v 20 ms pulse for electroporation. The pipette tip contents are dispensed into the 6 well plate with coverslips and media following completion of the pulse.\nUse one 10 μL Neon Pipette Tip (Thermo Fisher) twice per condition. Change the tip between concentrations.\nCritical: The time cells and delivery materials are suspended in buffer should be minimized; work quickly while taking care to ensure that bubbles do not form. If bubbles are not eliminated, the electroporation reaction could arc resulting in high cell death.\nPlace 6 well plate in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 2 h to allow cells to adhere.\nPlate a non-electroporated control from the total cell suspension volume from step k (30 mm dish) simultaneously with electroporated samples.\nTiming: 48 h, 30 min\nPreparing slides for imaging\nPrepare 6 mL of 4% PFA in PBS from 16% paraformaldehyde (1.5 mL of cold 16% PFA is added to 4.5 mL of PBS).\nAfter 2 h, remove cells from incubator and confirm adherence by light microscopy.\nFor fixation, quickly aspirate the media and add 1 mL of 4% PFA/well. Fix cells for 10 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nRemove the PFA and safely dispose of it.\nDispense PBS liberally into each well to a volume sufficient to cover the cells. Remove the PBS and gently add more to each well to remove traces of PFA. Repeat 1×.\nLeave PBS in wells for 5 min in the dark.",
    "Label and prepare slide (25 × 75 mm, Superfrost). Invert a bottle of ProLong Diamond Antifade mounting media and dispense one large drop.\nWhile tilting the 6 well plate, use forceps to carefully grab each coverslip. While keeping track of which face the cells are adhered to, gently drain the coverslip of excess PBS through capillary action by touching the edge of the coverslip close to a KimWipe or absorbent towel, being careful not to touch the face of the coverslip with cells. Place each coverslip on the mounting media so that cells are facing down toward the slide.\nKeep slides in the dark and undisturbed for 48 h.\nAfter 48 h, seal slides with a minimal amount of clear nail polish and allow the nail polish to dry completely before imaging.\nPause Point: Keep slides in the dark at 4°C for up to 2 months.\nAssessing delivery of purified proteins\nTwo important measures of protein electroporation are the fraction of electroporated cells and the amount of protein delivered per cell. Below are three orthogonal options for assessing the delivery of purified protein into cells. For assessing the amount of delivered protein, we recommend that at least two different methods are used, including a method that quantifies delivery on a per cell basis, such as quantification by microscopy. We also recommend performing at least three biological replicates of the assays listed below to determine if protein delivery is consistent from day to day.",
    "Determining electroporation efficiency. We used the EVOS XL digital inverted microscope equipped with the 20× 0.5 NA objective to measure efficiency. However, any microscope capable of transmitted light (ex. phase or DIC) and epifluorescence imaging should be sufficient. For these measurements, you want to use lower magnification (ex. 10× or 20×) to fit as many cells in a field of view as possible.\nLocate a field of view in the transmitted light channel, then focus and capture image.\nWithout changing the field of view, switch to the fluorescence channel and capture an image.\nRepeat and save in tiff format.\nElectroporation efficiency can be counted manually by counting the total number of cells (transmitted light channel) and dividing it by the number of fluorescent cells or quantified as described below using the freely available Fiji (ImageJ) software.\nFor the transmitted light channel, binarize each image (Process/Binary/Make Binary).\nBinarizing the image will often fragment cells. If this is the case, erode the binarized image (Process/Binary/Erode) until the cells appear whole.\nConvert binarized image to mask (Process/Binary/Convert to mask).\nNote: If thresholding the binarized transmitted light channel is difficult or cells are not captured, a plasma membrane stain such as CellMask HCS stain (Thermo Fisher) or Vybrant Di cell-labeling (Thermo Fisher) could alternately be used instead of the transmitted light channel to locate the cell edge. Lastly, cells could be circled by hand, however, this last option introduces the most bias.\nTo measure electroporation efficiency, analyze particles (Analyze/Analyze Particles), under “Show” select “Outlines.” To ensure that cell debris is not counted as a cell, limit the size by selecting a threshold number for cell size (for example 10-Infinity). Count cells using the results generated in Analyze Particles for both the light and fluorescence channels.",
    "Quantifying protein delivery using imaging. In this approach, electroporated cells are imaged on a microscope. The benefit to this method is that cell-to-cell variability of protein delivery is established in addition to mean changes of the entire population. We used the EVOS XL digital inverted microscope equipped with the 20× 0.5 NA objective to measure fluorescence intensity. However, any microscope capable of epifluorescence should be sufficient. For whole cell measurements, it is best to use a lower magnification objective with a large depth of focus.\nLocate cells with a range of fluorescence intensities.\nSelect settings for both light intensity and exposure time that provide good signal for both high and low fluorescence intensity cells. Ensure that highly fluorescent cells do not saturate the signal while retaining good signal-to-noise ratio for lower intensity cells. Since increasing either exposure time or light power will increase the signal, elect to increase exposure time over light power to reduce bleaching. Perform for both channels.\nLocate cells suitable for single-cell measurements: center them in the field of view, focus, and then capture the image. Cells should not be touching other cells. Once established, do not change imaging settings.\nNote: It is important that all imaging for each biological replicate is performed on the same day, using identical imaging parameters (light intensity, exposure time). This will minimize the potential that equipment variability (ex. light source) to affect a result.\nFor measurement of two probes, make sure that the stage is not moved when capturing both channels.\nCapture images for 30–40 cells and save in tiff format.\nOpen Fiji software and import all images from one data set as an image sequence (File/Import/Image Sequence).\nCreate one maximum intensity Z-projection of the image sequence (Image/Stacks/Z-Project-Select: Max IP).",
    "To measure background on a large number of images, select the maximum intensity Z-projection of the image sequence and locate an area devoid of cells or signal. To ensure the area is only background, adjust the brightness and contrast by reducing the maximum intensity (Image/Adjust/Brightness&Contrast). Use the rectangle tool (located in the toolbar) to draw a small box. While holding down shift, identify at least one more area free of cells/signal to draw another box, preferably at a far distance from the first box. When done, two areas should be selected on the stack that are devoid of any signal to generate a representative value for the background. Alternately, background can be subtracted from individual images, one at a time by using the rectangle tool to draw a small box in an area devoid of cells. Measure the mean intensity of the background (Analyze/Measure) for each image and then manually subtract that value from the image (Process/Math/Subtract). If background is subtracted manually, proceed to step l.\nSelect the window for the image sequence and Shift + E (alternately, Edit/Selection/Restore Selection) to transfer the drawn boxes to the image sequence. This places all the boxes in the same location for each image in the sequence, and every box should represent an area devoid of cells.\nClose the maximum intensity projection.\nDownload and then run the background subtraction macro (Plugins/Macros/Run/”File location”/Backgroundsubtract.txt) (For link see Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nNote: For simultaneous measurement of two channels, background subtract each channel. To use one channel to aid in detection of the other (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), use the brighter channel to locate and threshold the cell boundary. Transfer the selection from one channel to the other using Shift + E (alternately, Edit/Selection/Restore Selection) to transfer the drawn boxes to the image sequence.",
    "In the “Set Measurements” (Analyze/Set Measurements) window select the following: Area, Integrated Density, Mean Gray Value, Median. If measuring two fluorescence channels, each channel should have identical area measurements per cell.\nNote: There are multiple metrics available for fluorescence quantification. For quantifying the delivery of a fluorescent probe that diffusively localizes throughout the cytosol, we recommend using mean fluorescent intensity. Mean intensity is the sum pixel intensity divided by cell area and normalizes the measurement to account for any changes in area. It is a measure of the fluorescent probe concentration. Integrated density is a sum pixel intensity within the measured area and therefore measures the amount of fluorescent probe. Integrated density can alternately be calculated by multiplying the mean intensity by the area. Median pixel value can be used to display large variances in fluorescence distribution. Taking into consideration the localization of the probe as well as its distribution will help establish which metric will be the most informative.\nCheck a few of the images in the sequence to make sure the background was subtracted by drawing a box in an area devoid of cells. Take a measurement by Ctrl + M (alternately, Analyze/Measure) and checking the mean value. By selecting both an area for background and for a cell you can establish a signal: noise ratio.",
    "To measure individual cells, threshold the signal (Image/Adjust/Threshold). Optimize the thresholding so that cells are selected. If background subtraction was done correctly, the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and the protein is diffusively distributed in the cytoplasm, then the entire cell should be outlined (see Alternatives). Once the cell is thresholded, use the wand tool (located in the toolbar) to select the cell and Ctrl + M (Analyze/Measure) to measure. Additionally, the ROI Manager (Analyze/Tools/ROI Manager) can be used to measure cells and save a record of the analysis for future use.\nNote: If the protein is unlabeled, delivery can be assessed by performing immunostaining using an antibody that is specific for that protein. If the protein is endogenously expressed in the cells that are being electroporated, then electroporation should be assessed in cells were the gene encoding for the protein of interest is knocked out. Alternatively, an epitope tag could be added to the electroporated protein. As with any immunolabeling experiment, care should be taken to ensure that they antibodies are specifically interacting with their intended target. Protein delivery can also be indirectly by co-electroporating a fluorescent dextran that is similar in size to the protein being introduced (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), though co-electroporation of both probes needs to first be documented with an immunostaining experiment against the protein of interest.\nAlternatives: Fluorescence activated cell sorting could alternatively be used to assess protein delivery to individual cells. This method has the advantage of being able to analyze a much greater number of cells. Though, information about cell morphology that may be of importance will be lost.",
    "Quantifying protein delivery using fluorometry. In this approach, electroporated cells are lysed and their fluorescence is measured in a fluorometer. This requires that the delivered protein is fluorescent. As this is a bulk assay, it does not give a measure of cell-to-cell variability. Thus, it is recommended that this assay is combined with one that does such as quantitative imaging (step 4). Also, it only allows a relative comparison to be made between groups electroporated with different amounts of protein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPre-warm 10 mL aliquot of media (DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS) in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) and then divide 5 mL among (6) 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nThaw Alexa647-tagged Thymosin β4 or your choice of high quality fluorescently tagged protein or molecule.\nFollow the protocol of step 1 with 2–3 times the starting cell volume (6–9 60%–80% confluent 10 cm dishes). Double the electroporation volumes for four electroporations/condition instead of two.\nTake extra care to thoroughly resuspend the total cell volume and then count cells. Aliquot total cell volume equally among all conditions. Make a control for electroporation by mixing fluorescently tagged protein with lysate but do not electroporate.\nAfter electroporation, deliver cells to the Eppendorf tubes and partially close the lids to allow for gas exchange. Allow cells to rest for 10 min in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nCentrifuge Eppendorf tubes for 3 min, 150 × g, at 20°C–25°C. Remove media and replace with 1 mL of DPBS taking care to gently resuspend the pellet. Repeat the process of centrifugation, gentle re-suspension and washing, and DPBS removal 3×. Leave the pellet in DPBS.\nNote: This process can be performed under sterile or non-sterile conditions.",
    "Suspend each pellet in the same volume of a fluorometry-suitable protein buffer. The Qubit system comes with its own protein buffer (Component B).\nUsing a properly calibrated Qubit 4 Fluorometer or equivalent instrument, select the “Fluorometer” function and choose the Red (635 nm) excitation wavelength.\nNote: Check the excitation wavelength for the fluorophore of your protein or molecule of interest.\nRecord relative fluorescence units for each sample and graph as a function of protein concentration in the electroporation chamber.\nQuantifying protein delivery by western blot. This approach is similar to fluorometry (step 5), in that it is a bulk method that quantifies mean protein delivery among cells in a population. However, it offers a greater flexibility in what proteins are able to be measured since they do not have to be fluorescently labeled. This method does require that the protein of interest can be differentiated on the western blot, either because it runs at a different size than the endogenous protein or has an epitope tag that allows it to be specifically identified. As with fluorometry, it is recommended that an approach that quantifies cell-to-cell variability such as quantitative fluorescence imaging (step 4) is also performed. It is also important to know the electroporation efficiency (step 3) to accurately interpret the results.\nDispense 4–5 mL/dish of cell culture media (DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS) in (6) 60 mm tissue culture dishes (4–5 mL/dish) and place dishes in an incubator for a minimum of 30 min prior to electroporation. Pre-warm a 50 mL aliquot of media to 37°C in a water or bead bath.",
    "Follow the protocol of step 1 with 2–3 times the starting cell volume (6–9 60%–80% confluent 10 cm dishes). Double the electroporation volumes for four electroporations/condition instead of two. Additionally, use control cells to establish endogenous levels of protein.\nAfter electroporation, allow cells to adhere for 2 h in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nPrepare for cell lysis:\nMake a 2 mL RIPA buffer solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) with 80 μL of solubilized 25× Roche Protease inhibitor cocktail. Keep on ice.\nAliquot 10 mL of DPBS and keep on ice.\nLabel (12) 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and keep on ice.\nPre-chill a microcentrifuge capable of speeds up to 10,000 × g to 4°C.\nCheck for adherence and electroporation in a light and fluorescent microscope, respectively.\nHarvest cells.\nOn ice, aspirate media and rinse cells with ice-cold DPBS. Aspirate DPBS and replace with 250 μL of RIPA buffer. Cells should incubate on ice with RIPA buffer for 5 min prior to mechanical lysis.\nBy using a cell scraper and tilting the plate, collect cells at the bottom of the dish. Carefully alternate scraping and rotating the dish. Be sure to work quickly and keep the cells on ice.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette, transfer the RIPA buffer solution with cells to the chilled and labeled Eppendorf tube.\nStart a timer counting up.\nRepeat this for all cells. Do not leave cells out of the incubator longer than 5 min unless they are being harvested.\nWork quickly and ensure that the first harvested plate gets the same amount of time on ice in RIPA as the last as monitored by the timer.",
    "Generate whole cell lysate by mechanical lysis of cells with repeated passage (5×) through a 27G needle. Alternately, cells can be lysed via probe-tip sonicator. Either method should be performed on ice.\nCentrifuge lysate (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4°C). Pelleted membrane and debris should be seen at the bottom of the tube after centrifugation.\nFor the Li-Cor system, prepare 6× SDS buffer stained with Orange G (40% glycerol, 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% Orange G, 300 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, store at 20°C–25°C).\nDuring centrifugation step h, prepare SDS buffer by adding 5% β-mercaptoethanol (12.5 μL β- mercaptoethanol to 237.5 μL 6× SDS buffer).\nAfter centrifugation, take 30 μL of lysate from each sample and load 10 μL of each sample to three wells onto the same 96 well plate for protein quantification. Keep samples on ice.\nTransfer 145 μL of lysate from each sample to the Eppendorf tubes labeled in step diii and dilute with 30 μL of the prepared 6× SDS buffer. Keep all samples on ice until loading.\nTake a 96 well plate and load with BSA standards. Dispense 10 μL of each sample to three wells.\nAdd 190 μL of BCA reagent to all wells using a multi-channel pipette.\nIncubate 96 well plate with BCA working reagent for a minimum of 30 min at 37°C. Then read absorbance values with a plate reader. Calculate requisite volumes for loading protein samples. Make sure to multiply by the dilution factor to account for the addition of SDS buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nDenature samples at 95°C for 5 min in a heating block. Store samples directly on ice after denaturing and then centrifuge (5 min, 5,000 × g, 4°C).",
    "Pause Point: Samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 month at this point or processed as described below.\nMake 1× running buffer (1.44% glycine, 0.3% tris base, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) and 1× transfer buffer (7.5% glycine, 1.21% tris base) in 20% methanol added last. Store the transfer buffer aliquots at −20°C.\nLoad the gel in XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis or equivalent system.\nPrepare a gel (Novex tris-glycine 1.0 mm mini) for SDS-PAGE. In 1× running buffer, load 10 μL of WesternSure Pre-Stained Chemiluminescent Protein Ladder (Li-Cor) into the left-most lane.\nLoad 10 μg of each sample into the subsequent lanes, keep track of which lanes receive which samples.\nLoad empty lanes with 2 μL of 6× SDS buffer.\nRun gel at constant voltage until loading dye is close to the bottom of the gel (∼2 h, 120 V at 20°C–25°C).\n1 h and 45 min after the start of running the gel, wet a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane in a glass container with enough 100% methanol (MetOH) to cover the entire membrane. Dispose of the MetOH safely (Note: MetOH for wetting membranes can be reused) and wash the membrane 2× in de-ionized water (dH2O). On the second wash, shake the membrane in dH2O for 2 min. Remove the water and wash the membrane in transfer buffer on an orbital shaker or rocker. Ensure the membrane does not dry out.\nPre-wet the filter pads, blotting paper, and gel in ice-cold transfer buffer for a wet transfer in the XCell II Blotting or equivalent module. Assemble stack for transfer (from bottom to top: filter pad, blotting paper, gel, membrane, blotting paper, filter pad) and transfer on ice at constant current to the PVDF membrane (50 min, 100 mA).",
    "After transfer, rinse the membrane 2× in dH2O. Then, block membrane for 15 min in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1× tris buffered saline (TBS) at 20°C–25°C (2.5 g/50 mL). Dilute primary antibodies in 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, then add to membrane. Incubate primary antibody while shaking at 4°C overnight.\nThe next day, wash membrane in 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS 3× for 30 min. Incubate membrane with Li-Cor secondary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS for 2 h at 20°C–25°C while shaking. The membrane is then washed in 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS 3× for 30 min, and then washed in 1× TBS 2×.\nVisualize western and quantify the bands according to manufactures instructions.\nNote: Use a quantitative western analysis such as via the Li-Cor system to maintain linearity in detection. Quantitative western blotting can also be performed to determine how much protein is delivered in reference to endogenous levels. If establishing intracellular concentrations is desired, load a range of purified protein concentrations to generate a standard curve. To calculate concentration of protein per cell from western blot results, both the cell volume and the number of cells loaded per well are required."
