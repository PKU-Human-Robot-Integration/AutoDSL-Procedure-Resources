    "Tissue slidesThe slides used were obtained from mouse tissue, specifically bone marrow, lung, liver, and kidney. All tissues were processed by standard formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and tissue block sectioning, except for bone marrow of mouse tibia, which was decalcified between formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. For this purpose, the tibia bone was isolated from normal adult C57/Bl6 mice, fixed with formalin for 48 h, decalcified in 14% EDTA solution for 72 h before embedding with paraffin. Kidneys were harvested from the diabetic OVE26 mice [a transgenic mouse strain with early and persistent hyperglycemia (Epstein et al., 1989), and identified as a reliable mouse model of diabetic nephropathy (Zheng et al., 2004)] and uninephrectomized OVE26 mice (Zheng et al., 2011). Non-diabetic control kidney was obtained from age matched, same strain FVB mice. These animals have been tested for albuminuria, and their kidneys have been histologically evaluated with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and Masson’s trichrome stain. The kidneys with obvious tubulointerstitial fibrosis were used for demonstration of CD45 staining. The tissue sections of kidney, liver, and lung were cut at 4 µm, and sections of tibia were cut at 5 µm. Sections were mounted on positively charged slides. Prior to staining, all paraffin sections were heated for 30 min at 70°C. Bone marrow tissue was considered a positive control, and sections with omitted CD45 primary antibody were used as negative control.CD45 stainingImmunohistochemistry (IHC) Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue: dewax tissue slides in xylene and rehydrate with graded ethanol to water. (In detail: three changes in xylenes, 5 min each; two changes in 100% ETOH, 3 min each; followed by 95% ETOH, 90% ETOH, and 80% ETOH, 3 min each. Then, move slides to water, 3 min each with two changes.",
    ")Block internal peroxidase activity with H2O2: soak slides in the Coplin jar with 3% H2O2/PBS, 20 min, at room temperature (RT).Wash the slides with PBS: soak slides in PBS for 5 min, with three changes.Retrieve antigen in buffer of choice. For this protocol, antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer at pH 6, 95-100°C, 20 min. [In detail: Add 50 ml of 1× citrate buffer to a glass Coplin jar, and place this jar in a water bath beaker on top of a heating plate. As soon as the water bath is boiling, insert the tissue slides into the Coplin jar (maximal slide number: 10). Stop heating 20 min later by removing the beaker from the heating plate. Cool the Coplin jar at RT for 30 min.]Wash the slides with PBS for 5 min three times.Draw an hydrophobic circle around the tissue section on the slide: circle the tissue section with ImmEdge® Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen for a heat-stable, water-repellent barrier to keep reagents localized on tissue specimens and prevent mixing of reagents between sections.Block the tissue section with normal serum at RT for 30 to 60 min (avidin/biotin blocking procedure was added in this step and step 10).Prepare 2.5% normal goat serum in PBS.Add avidin solution from Avidin/Biotin blocking kit to 2.5% normal goat serum (4 drops per 1 ml), mix well.Place the slides in an incubation box.Apply 50-100 µl of blocking serum (with Avidin solution) to each tissue section.Incubate the section at RT for 30 to 60 min.Wash the slides with PBS-T, 5 min three times.Apply primary antibody**:Prepare antibody diluent: add biotin blocking solution to 2.5% goat serum/PBS (4 drops per 1 ml).Dilute CD45 antibody 1:400 with prepared diluent.Apply diluted antibody to tissue section.Incubate the slides in the incubation box overnight at 4°C.",
    "Wash the slides with PBS-T for 5 min three times.Apply secondary antibody:Prepare the antibody by diluting the biotinylated goat anti-rat (mouse absorbed) IgG in PBS at 1:200-1:400 dilution.Apply to tissue sections and incubate the slides in the wet box for 60 min at RT.Wash with PBS-T 5 min five times.Apply ABC solution***:Prepare ABC reagent from VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit: add two drops (100 μl) of Reagent A to 5 ml of PBS and mix; then add two drops (100 μl) of Reagent B to the above tube and mix immediately.Apply 50-100 µl of ABC reagent to each tissue section, incubate for 30 min at RT.Wash with PBS-T 5 min three times.Apply DAB:Prepare DAB reagent by mixing 200 µl of 50× DAB Chromogen with 10 ml of DAB substrate buffer.Apply DAB to tissue sections for a maximum of 10 min.Wash the slides in water 5 min three times.Counterstain nuclei with hematoxylin, if desired.Wash the slides with water 5 min three times.Dehydrate with ethanol and then xylene. (In detail: one incubation in 90% ETOH and two in 100% ethanol, 1 min each, followed by three incubations in xylene, 3 min each.)Apply permanent mounting medium to the slides and cover with cover glass.Observe the slides under the microscope to check if the brown color from DAB developed in the positive control and if the negative control section (where the primary antibody was omitted) has no color.If the staining is good, check the target sections for:Presence of positive staining.Location of the positive staining (parenchyma or interstitial tissue).Record the pathological changes of the tissue section imaged at the selected magnification. If necessary, perform quantitative analysis. Keep the observer blind to the group identification.Notes:  **For co-localized staining of CD45 with F4/80, select a tissue slide with three identically aligned serial sections.",
    "CD45 and F4/80 antibody are applied separately to adjacent sections. The third section lacks any primary antibody. All the other steps are the same. ***Allow ABC Reagent to stand for 15-30 min before use. Immunofluorescence (IF): Double staining for CD45 and KIM-1 Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue: tissue slides are dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated with graded ethanol to water.Retrieve antigen in buffer of choice. For this protocol, antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer at pH 6, 95-100°C, 20 min. (In detail: Add 50 ml of 1× citrate buffer to a glass Coplin jar, and place this jar in a water bath beaker on top of a heating plate. As soon as the water bath is boiling, insert the tissue slides into the Coplin jar (maximal slide number: 10). Stop heating 20 min later by removing the beaker from the heating plate. Cool the Coplin jar at RT for 30 min.)Wash the slides with PBS for 5 min.Draw a hydrophobic circle around the tissue section on the slide: circle the tissue section with ImmEdge® Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen for a heat-stable, water-repellent barrier to keep reagents localized on tissue specimens and prevent mixing of reagents between sections.Serum blocking:Prepare 2.5% normal donkey serum in PBS.Apply 50-100 µl of blocking serum to cover the tissue section.Incubate the slides for 60 min at RT.Rinse the slides briefly with PBS-T for 3 min three times.Apply primary antibody:Prepare the mixed antibody solution: add 5 µl of CD45 antibody (1:400) and 4 µl of KIM-1 antibody (1:500) into 2 ml of 2.5% donkey serum/PBS.Apply this mixed antibody solution to the designated tissue sections.Apply pre-immune serum only to the section which will be used as negative control.Incubate the slides overnight at 4°C.Wash the slides with PBS-T 5 min three times.",
    "Apply secondary antibody:Prepare antibody mix by adding Cy3 conjugated anti-Rat IgG and FITC conjugated anti-goat IgG (both at 1:100 dilution) to PBS and mix well.Apply this mixed antibody to tissue section.Incubate the slides for 60 min in the dark at RT.Wash the slides in the dark with PBS-T for 5 min five times.Mount the tissue sections using mounting medium with DAPI, overlay a cover glass, and store the slides in the dark at 4°C.Check the slides using a fluorescence microscope to validate positive and negative staining. In this study, DAPI/FITC/TRITC filters were used to reveal nuclei (DAPI), KIM-1 (FITC), and CD45 (Cy3) staining.Once the IF method is validated, check the target sections for positive stain and location. At the selected magnification, capture the images of the sample sequentially by DAPI, FITC, and TRITC filters with multi-channel acquisition settings and merge immunofluorescence images using the software. Keep the background and exposure equal for image comparison. If necessary, perform quantitative analysis. Keep the observer blind to the group identification."
