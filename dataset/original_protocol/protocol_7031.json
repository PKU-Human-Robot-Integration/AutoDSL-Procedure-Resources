    "C. glabrata culturingInoculate one single colony from the C. glabrata-streaked YPD agar plate in a 40 ml glass test tube with 5 ml of YPD medium.Place the tubes in a plastic beaker, and put cotton wads around the tubes so that these are tightly arranged in the beaker.Place the beaker in an incubator shaker, and grow the cultures with agitation at 200 rpm (rotation per minute) at 30°C overnight (14 to 16 h).The next morning, measure the optical density of the cultures at 600 nm (OD600) using the spectrophotometer, by diluting 20 times in sterile PBS.To obtain logarithmic (log)-phase cultures, inoculate the fresh YPD medium (10 ml, in 100 ml flask) with overnight-grown cultures at an OD600 of 0.1 and incubate with 200 rpm agitation at 30°C for 4-5 h, until the OD600 reaches 0.4-0.6. The OD600 may be measured every half an hour after 4 h of incubation.Cell lysisTransfer 10 ml of log-phase culture (0.4-0.6 OD600) to a 15 ml conical centrifuge/Falcon tube.Centrifuge tubes at 4,700 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Discard the supernatants and add 10 ml of PBS to the cell pellets.Centrifuge tubes at 4,700 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatants. Add 1 ml of PBS and suspend cell pellets in PBS by gentle pipetting.Transfer cell suspensions to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge tubes at 2,400 × g for 5 min at 4°C in a refrigerated microcentrifuge.Remove the supernatant completely using a 1 ml micropipette tip, without disturbing the pellet, add 200 μl cell lysis buffer to each tube, and suspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting.Add 0.",
    "5 mm glass beads to each tube up to a volume equal to that of the cell suspension, and lyse cells using the FastPrep 24 homogenizer at the maximum speed setting of 6.5 M/s for five cycles of 60 s each, with 3-5 min ice incubations in between cycles. Of note, based on the fungal species, this cell lysis step may require standardization for the optimal number of cycles and bead-beating speed settings.Take the tubes out from the FastPrep homogenizer and puncture them at the bottom using a needle. Place the cell homogenate-containing punctured tube inside a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube whose lid stays open. Arrange the tubes in a centrifuge with the open lids facing inwards and towards the center of the rotor, and centrifuge at 2,400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant will be transferred to the lower tube, while the glass beads will stay in the upper tube. Alternatively, centrifuge the cell homogenate-containing tubes at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove the beads, and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Centrifuge tubes again at 21,000 × g for 10-15 min at 4°C to remove cell debris and non-lysed cells, and collect the clear supernatants containing cellular proteins (approximately 150 μl) in new microcentrifuge tubes.Measure protein concentration in cell lysates using the BCA protein assay kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions. For this, add 11.5 μl sterile water and 1 μl cell lysate per assay. The reaction mixture volume in each well of a 96-well plate will be 12.5 μl. For standard plot generation, add 1 μl to 5 μl of BSA (Bovine serum albumin; 2 mg/ml concentration provided with the kit) in five separate wells of the 96-well plate. Make up the volume of each well to 12.",
    "5 μl with sterile water. Keep one well containing 12.5 μl of sterile water as blank, to which no protein sample is added. Add 100 μl of BCA solution (Solution A and Solution B in 50:1 ratio) to each well. Cover the plate with aluminum foil and incubate it at 37°C for 30 min. Measure sample absorbance at 562 nm in a multimode microplate reader. Calculate the protein concentration in cell lysate samples, which usually ranges from 5 to 10 μg/μl, using the BSA standard curve.Setting up of reaction mixtureStart preparing 1 ml total volume of the reaction mixture by placing a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube on ice. It will contain 500 µg protein, 500 µM menadione, and 500 µM NADH.Add the cell lysate corresponding to 500 µg of protein and 10 μl of 50 mM menadione stock solution (freshly prepared by dissolving 8.609 mg powder in 1 ml absolute ethanol in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube) to the reaction mixture. Of note, menadione is required for this assay, as no enzymatic activity was observed in the absence of exogenous menadione. However, menadione may be replaced with other quinones to check the specificity of different quinone reductase enzymes present in cell lysates. Similarly, since the levels and activities of Fld-LPs may change under various stress conditions, it is important to standardize the assay with 2-3 different concentrations of cell lysates and measure the absorbance values in the linear range.Make up the reaction volume to 950 µl with the assay buffer.For each cell lysate, prepare one blank control that contains all reagents.Set up a positive control by adding 20 μl of NAD(P)H: FMN oxidoreductase (1 Unit; Roche) instead of the cell lysate.Prepare 10 mM NADH stock solution by dissolving 6.",
    "6343 mg of powder in 1 ml HPLC grade water, before proceeding to the absorbance measurement step.Absorbance measurementSet up the Spectramax M5 plate reader to measure absorbance at 340 nm over a period of 60 s at 10 s intervals.Perform all the following steps in the dark.Add 50 µl of 10 mM NADH solution to the reaction mixture, mix well, transfer to a quartz cuvette (1-cm-path-length), and read the absorbance at 340 nm over a period of 60 s at 10 s intervals. Since NADH addition will start the quinone detoxification reaction, this step needs to be performed as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is important to start reactions individually just before the absorbance measurement.As a negative control, measure the absorbance of the blank sample (without adding NADH) at 340 nm over a period of 60 s at 10 s intervals.Repeat the above-mentioned steps for all cell lysate and positive control samples."
