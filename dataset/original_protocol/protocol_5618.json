    "Plate HFF cells in serum-free DMEM supplemented with MEM non-essential amino acids at low density (approx. 1 x 106 cells/150 cm2 flask). Incubate HFF cells in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h (Figure 1).Notes: In order to obtain enough RNA for each experiment, use 4 to 6 150 cm2 flasks.To plate HFF cells in serum-free DMEM; wash 70-80% confluent HFF cells (100 mm TC-treated cell culture dish) three times each with 10 ml phosphate buffered saline, add 1 ml 0.05% trypsin with phenol red to detach cells, add 10 ml serum-free DMEM media and collect cells in 15 ml conical tube, pellet cells by centrifuging at 300 x g at room temperature, and re-suspend pellet in serum-free DMEM supplemented medium.It is important to remove trypsin from HFF cells before re-plating since medium doesn’t contain FBS to inactive the trypsin.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131181856_3987.jpgFigure 1. Main steps diagram of this protocolCollect HFF cells by scraping flask on ice, pellet at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and wash two times each with 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline. Cell pellets can be frozen at -80 °C until RNA extraction (cell pellets must be kept on ice until lysed with TRIzolTM) (Figure 1).Notes:  To pellet HFF cells, remove old serum-free DMEM from cells and add 3 ml of fresh serum-free DMEM. Use the blade of cell scraper to collect cells in one corner of flask taking care to not splash the cells in flask. Add 1-2% of volume of FBS or BSA to cells on ice to assist in pelleting. Extract RNA from pelleted cells using TRIzolTM Reagent per manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "All steps in this protocol should be performed in an RNase free bench area by using RNase AWAYTM Surface Decontaminant to spray and wipe most surface areas including micropipettes and ice bucket. Resuspend cell pellets thawed on ice in 1 ml of TRIzolTM Reagent for 5 min to lyse. Add chloroform (20% of TRIzolTM Reagent volume), mix samples well, and incubate at room temperature for 2-3 min. Centrifuge samples at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate red phenol-chloroform (red/lower layer), interphase, and aqueous phase (clear/upper layer). Collect aqueous layer and precipitate RNA for 10 min at room temperature with isopropanol (0.5 volume of original TRIzolTM Reagent); GlycoBlueTM Coprecipitant (15 μg) can be added at this time to aid RNA precipitation. Pellet precipitated RNA by centrifugation (12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Wash RNA pellets with 75% ethanol (add an equal volume of 75% ethanol to TRIzolTM Reagent and briefly vortex) and re-pellet by centrifuging at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Air-dry RNA pellets for a few minutes and re-suspend in nuclease-free water.Note: Do not completely dry the RNA pellet because it will be difficult to re-suspend. Incubation at 55 °C for 10 min can help solubilize the RNA.Use DNase from TURBO DNA-freeTM Kit to digest DNA contamination in RNA samples according to manufacturer’s protocol:Mix RNA with 10x TURBO DNase Buffer (0.1 volume) and 1 μl of TURBO DNase. Incubate RNA at 37 °C for 20 min and halt the reaction by adding DNase Inactivation Reagent (0.1 volume). Incubate RNA samples for 5 min with intermittent mixing by flicking tube then centrifuge at 10,000 x g at room temperature for 2 min. Collect RNA (supernatant) and quantitate with NanoDropTM 2000 Spectrophotometer.",
    "Note: The average amount of total RNA obtained from each flask is 1.5-2 μg.Pre-load Protein G Sepharose® 4 Fast beads with rabbit serum control or anti-m3G-cap antibody (Figure 1).Note: Use large-orifice pipet tips or clip the tip off of a pipet tip to aid the transfer of Protein G Sepharose® 4 Fast beads. Wash 4 times the Protein G Sepharose® 4 Fast beads (40 μl slurry/IP sample) each with 1 ml NET-2 Buffer (see Recipes) using short 30 sec spins at 1,000 x g to pellet beads.Note: Non-filtered gel-loading pipet tips can be used during ‘wash’ steps to help prevent accidental loss of beads. Dilute washed Protein G Sepharose beads in 500 μl of NET-2 Buffer and add rabbit anti-m3G-cap antibody (15 μl/IP sample, approximately 150 μg) or rabbit serum control (15 μl/IP sample, approximately 150 μg). To achieve equal loading of beads with antibodies only use one microcentrifuge tube/antibody; aliquot the beads into separate tubes after they are pre-loaded.Incubate beads/antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature on tube rotator; make sure samples are actually mixing.Remove excess antibody by washing Protein G Sepharose Beads 5 times each with 1 ml NET-2 Buffer (short 30 sec spins at 1,000 x g); Resuspend beads in NET-2 Buffer (50 μl/sample). Aliquot antibody-bound Protein G Sepharose Beads into 1.5 microcentrifuge tubes; use enough tubes to have one of each antibody (anti-m3G-cap and control) per sample.Pre-clear RNA with Protein G Sepharose Beads to reduce non-specific binding:Add RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (1 μl) to RNA (10 μg/500 μl diluted with NET-2 buffer) and incubate for 3 to 5 min at 85 °C. Note: Plunge RNA into ice immediately after heating to avoid refolding of RNA.After heating, add an additional 1 μl of RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor to RNA.",
    "Note: Remember to wipe tubes with RNase AWAYTM Surface Decontaminant before opening to prevent possible contamination and degradation of RNA.Rotate RNA (10 μg/sample for each antibody) slowly (without vibration) with 40 μl of NET 2-washed Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (without antibody) for 2 h at 4 °C. Centrifuge RNA at 1,000 x g for 2 min to remove pre-clearing beads.Rotate pre-cleared RNA slowly (without vibration) with anti-m3G-cap or control pre-loaded Protein G Sepharose® 4 Fast beads for 4 to 16 h at 4 °C. Confirm that samples are mixing (Figure 1).Collect the beads by centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 2 min and remove supernatant (save 250 μl for RNA extraction).Wash beads 5 times with 1 ml of NET-2 Buffer using short 30 sec spins at 1,000 x g.Note: RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor can be added to NET-2 Buffer (see Recipes) to prevent degradation of RNA. Resuspend beads in 250 μl of G-50 Buffer (see Recipes) to elute TMG-capped RNA (Figure 1).Purify RNA by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (PCI) extraction (also extract RNA from TMG-capped depleted supernatant)Add 250 μl of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol to RNA in G-50 Buffer.Vortex RNA samples for 20 sec (10 up and 10 angled) and centrifuge samples for 10 min at 12,000 x g at room temperature.Transfer the aqueous phase with RNA (upper layer) to a clean microcentrifuge tube containing 50 μl of 3 M sodium acetate (NaOAc), pH 5.2.Add 1 ml of 100% ethanol (precooled to -20 °C) to precipitate RNA; 1 μl of GlycoBlue can be added to help precipitate RNA and visualize pellets. Incubate RNA at -20 °C for 48 h.Pellet RNA by centrifuging sample at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate ethanol and wash RNA pellet with 500 μl of 75% ethanol (precooled to -20 °C).",
    "Re-pellet purified RNA by short spin for 1 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C and aspirate 75% ethanol. Dissolve the dried m3G-capped RNA pellet in nuclease-free water (20 to 30 μl).Note: The average amount of pull-down m3G-capped RNA obtained from each experiment (5 flasks) is 1.5-2 μg.RT-PCR of m3G-capped RNAs by using iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit and 2x SsoAdvancedTM SYBR® Green Supermix PCR according to manufacturer’s protocols:Note: Perform RT-PCR using un-processed RNA (input) and RNA extracted from supernatant to determine expression levels of RNA of interest (m3G-capped and uncapped).  Mix 5 μl of m3G-capped RNA with 5x iScript Reaction Mix (0.2 volume) and 1 μl of iScript Reverse Transcriptase. Process RNA to cDNA in a thermocycler by undergoing the following conditions: 25 °C for 5 min, 46 °C for 20 min, 95 °C for 1 min, and held at 4 °C. The reaction can be stored at 4 °C for short-term storage or -20 °C for long-term storage. Mix the resulting cDNA (around ¼ of the total cDNA reaction mix) with 2x SsoAdvancedTM SYBR® Green Supermix (0.5 volume) and the desired forward and reverse primers (12.5 μM stock; 0.04 volume). cDNA then undergoes the following conditions to produce a PCR product: 95 °C for 1.5 min; 40 cycles: 95 °C for 30 sec, 60 °C for 30 sec. The PCR product is ran on a 1% agarose gel (made with 1x TBE [see Recipes] and ethidium bromide) at 100 V for 2 h, and bands are imaged with a UV transilluminator."
