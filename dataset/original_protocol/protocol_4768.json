    "Streak Aspergillus terreus conidia from a frozen glycerol stock (60%) onto Aspergillus Minimal Medium (AMM) plate (9.2 cm diameter, 25 ml medium solidified with 2% agar) and cultivate for 4 days at 37 °C in the dark (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160614/20160614203725_1089.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of Aspergillus terreus conidia suspensions. A. AMM agar plate with Aspergillus terreus grown for 4 d at 37 °C. Note the cinnamon coloured conidia on top of the colonies. B. Aqueous suspension of conidia. C. Microscopic image of Aspergillus terreus conidia (arrows). Note the round shape of the conidia and an average size of 2.5-3.0 μm. Scale bar = 10 μm.Collect the conidia with a spreader by adding 10 ml distilled sterile water. Filter conidia over a 45 μm cell strainer to remove any clumps and hyphal fragments and collect in a 50 ml screw cap tube (Figure 1B).Centrifuge (10 min at 2,600 x g), wash the cells at least once with 10 ml distilled sterile water with subsequent second centrifugation (10 min, 2,600 x g) and suspend conidia in 5 ml distilled sterile water.Estimate the conidia concentration in suspension using a counting chamber (Thoma or Neubauer chamber) (Figure 1C). If necessary, dilute the crude suspension by factor 10 or 100 in sterile water prior to counting.Slightly wipe the surface of the fruits with 70% ethanol. Subsequently, wash with distilled water and dry the surface with a soft cotton tissue (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160614/20160614204006_6628.jpgFigure 2.

Infection with conidia suspension in the longitudinal groove. D. Incubation in a sterile glass beaker (pre-weighed) for 5 to 7 days at room temperature.Cut the fruit longitudinally with a sterile scalpel (length around 10 cm; depth around 1.5 cm) (Figure 2B).",
    "Inoculate with 200 μl of a conidia suspension containing 2 x 108 conidia/ml. Disperse the volume evenly over the complete length of the groove (Figure 2C). For negative control use 200 μl of sterile water. Fruits used for infection and for the control must be taken from the same batch! At least three technical replicates (three fruits, each from the same batch or parental plant) and five biological (five different batches) replicates should be carried out.Weigh a sterile 1,000 ml glass beaker including a covering aluminium foil. Put the fruit into the sterile 1,000 ml beaker glass and cover it with aluminium foil (Figure 1D).Incubate the fruit for 5 to 7 days at room temperature (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160614/20160614204149_4825.jpgFigure 3. Cross-section of bananas after 7 days of incubation. A. Control (mock) infected banana. B. Banana infected with 200 μl of A. terreus conidia suspension (2 x 108 conidia/ml).Cut the fruit into pieces of approximately 2 x 2 cm size and smash the fruit in the glass beaker using a pestle. Add a magnetic stir bar and pour 150 ml ethyl acetate into the beaker.Extract the fruits while stirring on a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 15 min.Decant the supernatant into a 500 ml round bottom flask and repeat the extraction procedure. Pool both extracts. For dry weight determination of bananas evaporate the fruit debris in the glass beaker under a fume hood. Subsequently dry it at 37-50 °C. Weigh the glass beaker including its cover and calculate the dry weight by subtracting the weight of the empty glass beaker as previously determined.Evaporate the ethyl acetate from the fruit extractions to dryness using a rotary evaporator.Solve the residue in 2 ml HPLC grade methanol. Dilute the extract in a ratio of 1:10, 1:20 and 1:50 in methanol.",
    "Filter the dilutions over a 0.45 μm nylon filter into a HPLC vial. Run a calibration curve by applying 10 μl serial dilutions of the terrein standard (2.5 to 500 μg/ml in methanol) to a bifunctional C18 column (e.g., Macherey-Nagel Sphinx RP, 4.0 x 3 x 250 mm; 5 mm) in a modular HPLC system equipped with DAD (e.g., Agilent 1260 modular HPLC system). The following gradient (solution A = water + 0.1% formic acid, solution B = methanol) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min should be applied: 0.5 min = 10% B, 0.5-20 min = 10%-70% B, 20-25 min = 70%-100% B, 25-28 min = 100% B, and 28-33 min = 100%-10% B. Terrein is detected at a wavelength of 254 nm.Generate a calibration curve from peak integrations at 254 nm.Apply 10 μl aliquots of the diluted fruit extracts to the column. Use the calibration curve to calculate the amount of terrein (μg) by peak integration from the UV profile. Note that the total volume of terrein extract in methanol was 2 ml.Determine the total terrein content as terrein (μg)/dry-weight of fruit (g)."
