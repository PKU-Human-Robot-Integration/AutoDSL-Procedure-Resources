    "For the present study, the animal experiments were approved by UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals. Adult, 8-12-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice (in-house bred) were used here.\n1. DRG sample preparation\nAnesthetize the mice with 2.5% Avertin (see Table of Materials). Ensure adequate anesthesia by the lack of response to painful stimulation. Perfuse the animals transcardially with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% formaldehyde, as previously described14,15,16.\nDissect DRG tissue from the spinal cord, as previously described14,15,16.\nPost-fix the dissected DRGs in 4% formaldehyde for 3 h at room temperature.\nPut the DRGs in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C overnight.\nPreparing the base optimal cutting temperature (OCT)\n\t\nAdd the OCT compound (see Table of Materials) to cover the top surface of the aluminum block and freeze at -20 °C for 5-10 min (Figure 1A).\nCut off the top of the OCT using the cryostat (see Table of Materials) at 30 µm thickness until its surface is flat as the base OCT (Figure 1B).\nMake a mark at the bottom (six o'clock position) of the base OCT to mark its orientation, before taking the aluminum block off the cryostat (Figure 1C).\nIn the following steps, keep the mark at the six o'clock position to maintain the same orientation, which can lead to obtaining more sections of the DRG sample.\n\t\tNOTE: If the orientation is lost and the DRG sample is cut at a different angle, the DRG sample cannot be cut completely from top to bottom, which will leave some samples left out on the base OCT and wasted, as the base OCT will be encountered while trying to cut the DRG sample (Figure 1C).",
    "Performing OCT embedment of DRGs\n\t\nDry the DRG tissue before putting it on the OCT.\n\t\t\nBefore adding the DRG onto the block, ensure to remove the 30% sucrose/PBS solution around the sample.\nDry the DRG sample by placing it on a dry Petri dish (Figure 2A) and moving it from one location to another two or three times with dry tweezers (Figure 2B).\nDry the tweezers with lint-free tissue before moving another DRG sample (Figure 2C).\nPut the dry DRG onto the base OCT.\n\t\t\nWith dry tweezers, place the dry DRG onto the base OCT at the 12 o'clock position (Figure 1D).\nKeep at least 5 mm between the upper edge of the DRG and the upper edge of the base OCT.\nPut the dorsal part of the DRG at the 12 o'clock position and the ventral part at the six o'clock position (Figure 1D).\nEmbed the DRG tissue with OCT.\n\t\t\nAdd more OCT to cover the entire DRG sample in a round or oval shape, with the DRG in the center (Figure 1E).\nEnsure the upper edge of the OCT covers the DRG at the upper edge of the base OCT (Figure 1F), as this makes it easier to transfer the section onto the glass slide (Figure 3A).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the cover OCT is in the middle of the base OCT, the upper edge of the base OCT will block the glass slide to collect the section (Figure 3B).\nFreeze the cover OCT and DRG sample at -20 °C for another 5 min (Figure 1G). Do not trim the OCT around the DRG sample.\nCut off the top of the cover OCT at a 30 µm thickness until the DRG is visible.\n2. Cryosectioning of the DRG",
    "Change the cryostat section thickness to 12 µm to cut DRG sections onto the slide (Figure 1H).\nHold the OCT section at the bottom with a small paintbrush cooled to -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: It is important not to cut the whole section completely, but to leave 1-3 mm uncut (Figure 1I).\nUse the end of a room-temperature tweezer to gently touch the bottom (six o'clock position) of the section so that it sticks to the platform surface (Figure 1J). This prevents the section from curving back in a roll, which makes it difficult to collect the section on the slide.\n\tNOTE: When the bottom of the section sticks to the platform surface, and the top of the section still connects with the cover OCT, the section is in a flat shape (Figure 1K), making it much easier to collect the section on the slide.\nTake a charged glass slide (see Table of Materials) and slowly place the slide over the section. As soon as the section starts to stick to the slide, gently pull the slide backward (Figure 1L).\nFollow the same process to get more DRG sections onto the slide without overlapping the sections (Figure 1M). Ensure that a new DRG section is not placed over the OCT of another DRG section (Figure 4), as such a section cannot stay well on the slide and can be washed away during the immunochemistry staining process.\n3. Nissl staining of the DRG section on the glass slide\nWash the sections for 10 min in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-10. Then, wash the sections twice with PBS.\nApply a 1:300 Nissl stain (see Table of Materials) to the slide and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash the section with PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Then, wash the sections twice with PBS for 5 min, and then for 2 h at room temperature.\nApply 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluoromount-G (see Table of Materials) to cover the sections with a coverslip.\nSubscription Required.
