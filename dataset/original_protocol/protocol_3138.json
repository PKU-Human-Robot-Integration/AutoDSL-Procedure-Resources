Use a syringe plunger to mechanically digest the whole spleen from donor mice, then use ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer to remove red blood cells.\nAdd 10 mL ice-cold MACS buffer to one well of a 6-well plate for each spleen.\nCollect the spleen from the donor mice once mice are euthanized by IACUC approved method and put the spleen in one well of a 6-well plate which is prepared in step 1.\nUse a 100 μm strainer and the plunger from a 1 mL syringe to homogenize tissues on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2909-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Spleen single-cell suspension protocol\n(A) Spleen tissues are homogenized in 10 mL of MACS buffer on ice using a 100 μm strainer and the plunger from a 1 mL syringe.\n(B) The resulting cell suspension is transferred and filtered through a 100 μm single-cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube.\n(C) The cell suspension is then centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the cells after ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis. The pellet, indicated by the red arrow, becomes white.\nPut the 100 μm filter into a 50 mL tube and pass the homogenized tissues through the 100 μm strainer. Add another 5 mL MACS buffer to wash the strainer, then centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPour off the supernatant to retain the cell pellet.

    "Critical: It is critical to pay attention to the lysis time and temperature in order to effectively eliminate red blood cells (RBCs) while ensuring the viability of white blood cells for subsequent steps. Careful control of these parameters is essential for successful experimental outcomes (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Pour off the supernatant to retain the cell pellet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL MACS buffer and count cells.\nNote: Keep 5 × 106 cells in 500 μL MACS buffer single color compensation staining (step 20).\nMagnetic labeling & magnetic separation\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThese steps describe how to enrich CD4-positive cells from the spleen single cell suspension. The CD4 negative and positive cells are separated by the Miltenyi CD4+ T Cell isolation kit.\nCritical: Keeping the whole procedure on the ice or at 4°C and working fast is essential for getting live CD4+ live cells. Long time or high temperature might decrease the cell viability and purity.\nNote: The volume of reagent used below is sufficient for 107 or fewer cells.

If necessary, add MACS buffer.\nWash the column with 0.5 mL MACS buffer twice.\nNote: For the LS column, use 3 mL MACS buffer.\nRemove the column from the separator and place it on a suitable collection tube. Pipette 1 mL MACS buffer onto the MS column. Immediately flush out the magnetically labeled CD4+ cells.\nNote: For the LS column, use 5 mL MACS buffer.\nOptional: Potential alternative CD4+ T cell isolation kits or CD4+ T cell negative selection isolation kits can be obtained from different companies, such as Biolegend and Stemcell technology, might serve as suitable replacements for the Miltenyi CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit.\nAntibody staining of naïve CD4+ cell for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps describe how to stain and sort naïve CD4+ cells by flow cytometry.\nCritical: Performing the procedure on ice or at 4°C and working quickly is vital for isolating live naïve CD4+ T cells. A prolonged procedure or high temperature might decrease the cell viability and purity.\nNote: The volume of reagent and antibody used below is sufficient for 107 or fewer cells.

Pour off the supernatant to retain the cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellet with cold PBS to 2.5 ×106 cells/mL.\nVery slowly draw cells into a 1-mL syringe with a 27-G ½ inch needle attached.\nUsing a proper intraperitoneal (IP) injection technique, slowly inject 100 μL naïve CD4+ T cells into the recipient mouse (in this case, they are Rag2 −/− mice).\nSecure the recipient mouse in a suitable position to access the peritoneal cavity.\nInsert the 27-G ½ inch needle slowly and carefully into the peritoneal cavity.\nCritical: Take caution to avoid damaging internal organs or causing unnecessary harm.\nSlowly inject the 100 μL of naïve CD4+ T cell suspension into the peritoneal cavity.",
    "Critical: Ensure a controlled and steady delivery to ensure even distribution\nGently withdraw the needle from the peritoneal cavity, avoiding any sudden movements.\nMonitor the mice for signs of distress, adverse reactions, or complications.\nHouse the recipient mice under specific pathogen-free (SPF) or other conditions required for the protocol and wait 5 weeks before analyzing CD4+ subsets in the small Intestine (SI) lamina propria (LP).\nIsolation of lamina propria (LP) cells from the small intestine of recipient mice\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThese steps describe how to isolate cells from the small intestinal lamina propria. In this portion of the protocol, the lamina propria of the ileum are disrupted by collagenase VIII and DNAase I treatment.\nPreparing the necessary reagents in advance and allowing them to equilibrate to the desired temperature before handling the mice to collect the small Intestine is recommended. This will ensure that the reagents are at the correct temperature by the time you start the experiment and help maintain consistency and accuracy in your results.\nCritical: Performing the isolation steps quickly and accurately is essential for obtaining live cells.\nNote: This protocol can also be used to isolate cells from lamina propria of the colon or other mucosal tissues (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nAdd 10 mL ice-cold HBSS buffer containing 2% FCS to one well of a 6-well plate for each small intestine.\nCollect 5–6 cm distal small Intestine (containing the ileum) from the recipient mice once mice are euthanized by an IACUCC approved method and put them in the one well of a 6-well plate which is prepared in step 32 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2909-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

PMA and ionomycin affect protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium ion influx and induce cytokine expression in the cells. GolgiPlug (containing brefeldin A) blocks intracellular transport processes and causes accumulation of most cytokine proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nCritical: It is crucial to optimize the induction time for each cytokine. Induction times that are too long can result in significant cell death, while induction times that are too short may fail to induce enough cytokines.
