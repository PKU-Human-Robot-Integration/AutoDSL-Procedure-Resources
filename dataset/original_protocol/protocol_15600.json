    "The following steps were part of a study that conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the Canton Bern, Switzerland (2019-02468). All participants gave their written informed consent prior to study participation.\nNOTE: It is recommended to assess participants' vestibular function before the MVS experiment with standard vestibular diagnostic tests such as questionnaires (e.g., dizziness handicap inventory29), bithermal caloric tests, rotatory pendular tests, head impulse tests (HIT), subjective visual vertical (SVV), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c-VEMP), ocular vestibular myogenic potentials (o-VEMP), dynamic visual acuity (DVA), and/or dynamic posturography.\n1. Preparation of the experimental setup in the scanner room (Figure 2)\nCAUTION: All materials brought inside the scanner room must be MRI safe.\nConnect the experimental computer and the eye-tracking computer with a crossover ethernet cable to enable the synchronization of data collection.\nConnect the response buttons operated by the participant with the experimental computer via the response box.\nSwitch on the projector connected to the experimental computer.\nConnect the magnetometer device to the magnetometer computer by plugging it into the USB connector.\n\tNOTE: The 3D magnetometer must be suitable and calibrated for ultra-high field strength. In the software used in this study, the following settings were chosen: Units = Tesla, Range = 20.00, Acquisition rate = 100.00 Hz.\nConnect the eye-tracking goggles to the eye-tracking computer with a shielded firewire cable.\n\tNOTE: Unless the cable is long enough, the eye-tracking computer screen must be seen from inside the scanner room to enable adjustments of the eye-tracking goggles. If necessary, use an external screen placed in front of the window between the MRI room and the control room.\nOpen the eye-tracking software9,25.\n2. Preparation of the participant for entering the MRI scanner\nCAUTION: The following steps are critical for participant and staff safety.",
    "Let the participant read and sign the informed consent.\nConfirm that participant does not meet MRI exclusion criteria. Provide MRI-safe clothing, remove metallic objects (e.g., piercings), and provide a pregnancy test (if applicable).\n\tNOTE: For MR safety criteria, see https://mr-gufi.de/index.php/dokumente. The criteria vary between research sites.\nRemove contact lenses, eyeshadow, and mascara thoroughly (for better eye-tracking).\n3. Informing the participant about experimental procedures and tasks\nExplain the experimental procedure and give instructions about the tasks. Let the participant complete practice trials (if applicable).\nIf self-motion perception is assessed, inform the participant about specific translation and rotation axes (see Figure 1A). Use memorable terms for the specific movements, e.g., \"barbecue rotation\" for rotations in yaw (around the head-vertical axis) in the supine position26.\n4. Preparation of eye-tracker and magnetometer measurements\nPut an elastic headband and EEG cap on the participant's head (e.g., an MRI-safe EEG cap without electrodes) (see Figure 3A).\nFix the magnetometer behind one ear (must be in the range of the 3D-CISS sequence images) by pulling it under the elastic headband and the EEG cap. Fix it appropriately with adhesive tape (see Figure 3B).\nPut on the eye-tracking goggles over the EEG cap (see Figure 3C).\nLet the participant insert ear plugs.\nAdjust the eye-tracking parameters on the goggles (left/right centering, up/down centering, focus) and in the software (left/right centering, up/down centering, pupil size, contrasts, iris pattern) to ensure good tracking.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64022/64022fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Preparation of the participant.

    "NOTE: Calibration would be most precise if done before every run and in the position in which the participant is moved into the scanner. The here-reported procedure is less precise but was chosen due to time and technical constraints.\nLet the participant sit 1 m in front of calibration stimuli (measure the eye-stimulus distance with, for example, a tape measure).\nAdjust the eye-tracking parameters in the software (pupil size, contrasts, iris pattern) for good tracking.\n\t\nPress Record to start data acquisition.\nLet the participant look at every dot for 1 s (five dots in total, three in a row, one above the middle, one beneath the middle, distance of dots 10 cm) with verbal instruction: left, down, mid, up, right.\nPress Stop to stop data acquisition.\n6. Measuring spontaneous nystagmus before entering the scanner\nNOTE: Measurements are most precise when taking place outside the magnetic field in the supine position. This could be carried out with a detachable MRI bed. If not available, as in the setup used in this study, a position outside the 50 mT line (dashed line on the floor) should be chosen. The strength of the magnetic field at the position of the measurement can be assessed with the magnetometer (0.02 T in the setup used here).\nPut the goggles cover on and ensure the participant cannot see any light. Otherwise, let participant cover their head with black fabric to eliminate any light coming in.\nAdjust the eye-tracking parameters in the software (pupil size, contrasts, iris pattern) for good tracking. Tell the participant to open their eyes widely.\n\t\nPress Record to start data acquisition.\nMeasure the eye movements for at least 30 s. Readjust the eye-tracking parameters if necessary.\nPress Stop to stop data acquisition.\nTake the goggles cover off.",
    "7. Positioning the participant for the experiment\nLet the participant lie down on the scanner bed.\nAdjust the head-tilt position of the participant according to the first condition (either supine or tilted upward in the pitch plane at approximately 30°) by using appropriate cushions.\nPlace the mirror over the participant's head and adjust it so the screen is inside the participant's field of view.\nGive the participant the response buttons for each hand; if necessary, fix them with tape.\nLet the participant practice putting on and taking off the cover of the goggles so that this can be done in the dark inside the bore; the participant should repeat this for as long as necessary and finish with the cover on the goggles.\n\tNOTE: This step can lead to the displacement of the goggles, which can affect measurements regarding the position of the eyes. If possible, perform a calibration after this step.\nRepeat the instructions for the first task and ask the participant if the instructions are understood.\nAdjust the eye-tracking parameters either on the goggles or in the software (pupil size, contrasts, iris pattern) for good tracking.\nAdjust the MRI bed's starting position with the help of the MRI scanner's laser cross to ensure the participant's inner ear structures will be in the center of the bore during the experiment.\n8. Moving the participant into the scanner\nIf applicable, start the self-motion perception paradigm by pressing Run and entering the participant and trial information in the experimental software on the experimental computer.\nStart the eye-tracking measurements (in the setup used here, this was started by the self-motion perception paradigm) by pressing Record in the eye-tracking software. Tell the participant to open their eyes widely.\nStart the magnetometer measurements by pressing Record in the magnetometer software.",
    "Tell the participant that the run is starting.\nInside the scanner room, start to move the participant into the bore.\nAfter 3 min, percepts of self-motion should have vanished in most participants. Therefore, tell the participants to take the goggles' cover off if visual stimuli need to be presented (e.g., a questionnaire).\n\tNOTE: Eye-tracking can also be continued for a longer time with covered eyes.\nIf applicable, present a self-motion questionnaire on the screen by starting it by pressing Run on the experimental computer and letting the participant answer via response buttons.\n9. Presenting a paradigm with a cognitive task\nIf applicable, present a paradigm with a cognitive task on the screen by starting it by pressing Run on the experimental computer and letting the participant answer via response buttons. Assess the magnetometer orientation during this time.\n\t​NOTE: Now, different tasks can be implemented for the participant to conduct. Let the participant take the cover of the goggles on and off to change between eye-tracking and screen-based paradigms.\n10. Moving the participant out of the scanner\nLet the participant put the cover of the goggles on.\nRepeat steps 8-9 (except step 8.5., which is \"move the participant out of the bore\")\n11. Switch the head position\nSwitch the head position to the position not yet assessed using the appropriate cushions (either supine or tilted) and repeat steps 8.2-11.\n\t​NOTE: If an appropriate MRI bed is available, an interesting variation could be to move participants into the bore with their feet first, as reversed entry into the bore reverses the field direction relative to the inner ear.\n12. Assessment of the orientation of the vestibular organs\nRemove the mirror and goggles without displacing the magnetometer.\nInstall the head coil.",
    "Remove the probe of the magnetometer and replace the probe with a pipette filled with water without displacing the cover of the magnetometer (see Figure 3D).\nPlace the participant's head inside the head coil without displacing the magnetometer.\nMove the participant into the scanner.\nAcquire a 3D-CISS sequence for structural inner ear imaging.\n\t​NOTE: In this study, the following parameters were used: a slice thickness of 0.4 mm; a field of view of 179 mm × 179 mm; a flip angle of 60°; a repetition time (TR) of 8.29 ms; and an echo time (TE) of 3.81 ms. The acquisition time of this 3D-CISS was 10 min 53 s. Different sequences have been used in other studies23,30.\nMove the participant out of the MRI scanner.\n13. End of study\nRemove the pipette, cap, headband, and ear plugs, and leave the scanner room with the participant.\nIf applicable, let the participant fill out a questionnaire (e.g., self-motion perception, experienced differences between conditions, other experiences).\nDebrief the participant about the investigated research questions (e.g. measuring effects of MVS on nystagmus, self-motion perception and cognitive tasks by manipulating head position in reference to the magnetic field)."
