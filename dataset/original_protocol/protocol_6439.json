    "Plasmid construction (3 days)Hoc and/or Soc can be efficiently displayed on the T4 capsid as the linker for AAV attachment. Here, we constructed pET-28b-Soc and pET-28b-BAP-Hoc for Hoc/Soc protein expression. Additionally, the BirA-expressing plasmid pET-21a-BirA was purchased from Addgene (plasmid no.  20857  ). Plasmids pAAV-DJ (# VPK-420-DJ  ), pAAV-Helper (# VPK-400-DJ  ), pAAV-GFP (# AAV-400  ), pAAV-luciferase (# AAV-321  ), and pAAV-mCherry (# VPK-410  ) were purchased from Cell Biolabs.pET-28b-Soc construction (3 days)Amplify RB69 Soc gene fragment (228 bp) from RB69 phage genomic DNA using Thermo Fisher 2x Phusion high-fidelity PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F531S#/F531S[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F531S#/F531S]).The primers are shown as follows, where the underlined sequences indicate the recognition sequences for the respective restriction enzymes:Soc NheI Forward:5′-GCATCCGCTAGCGGTGGTTATGTA A ACATCAAA-3′.Soc XhoI Reverse:5′-GTGCTCGAGCACCACTTACTGGTGTAGGGGTAAAC-3′.Add 1/10 volume of 10x DNA loading buffer to each PCR sample and load 50 μl reaction onto the 1.5% agarose-TBE gel, and separate them by agarose gel electrophoresis. Additionally, load the 100 bp plus DNA marker for size verification.Cut the DNA band of expected size using a clean blade, purify Soc DNA using QIAGENQIA quick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Digest 1 μg purified Soc PCR product with NheI and XhoI by following the manufacturer’s instructions with incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Meantime, digest 1 μg pET-28b vector plasmid with NheI and XhoI at 37 °C for 4 h.To prevent vector recircularization during ligation, dephosphorylate the 5′-ends of the digested pET-28b with 1 μl Fast AP thermos sensitive alkaline phosphatase without changing the restriction enzyme buffer and incubate at 37 °C for 40 min.Separate the digested Soc insert and pET-28b vector using 1.5% and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Then purify them using the QIAGENQIA quick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Store the digested insert and vector at -20 °C until needed.Ligate insert and vector at a molar ratio of 5:1 using T4 DNA ligase at 22 °C for 2 h (in a water bath). Prepare the vector backbone without the insert as a negative control to evaluate vector recircularization.Transform E. coli DH5α competent cell with the ligation product using heat shock according to the manufacturer’s instructions and incubate on the kanamycin-LB plate overnight at 37 °C.Pick 2-3 single colonies and inoculate each into 3 ml LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml of kanamycin in 15 ml tubes.

Perform the first round of PCR by fusing Hoc to part of the BAP sequence using the BAP-Hoc Forward 1 and BAP-Hoc HindIII Reverse primers. Obtain full-length BAP-Hoc (1,197 bp) by the second round of PCR using the BAP-Hoc NheI Forward 2 and BAP-Hoc HindIII Reverse primers.Digest BAP-Hoc PCR product and pET-28b vector with Nhe I and Hind III.",
    "Then, sub-clone the digested BAP-Hoc fragment into the pET-28b vector according to the Steps A1b to A1j. The resulting pET-28b-BAP-Hoc plasmid should contain Hoc in-frame fusion with BAP, a 15-aa vector biotin acceptor peptide (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) at the NH2-terminus of Hoc, and also a hexa-histidine sequence at the COOH-terminus of Hoc.Protein expression, purification, and modification (4 days)Soc and BAP-Hoc protein expression and purification (3 days)Transform 15 ng of pET-28b-Soc or pET-28b-BAP-Hoc into 20 μl BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL competent cells using the heat-shock method according to the manufacturer’s protocol. BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL cells contain a ColE1-compatible, pACYC-based plasmid that has chloramphenicol resistance for protein expression.

Incubate overnight in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm and 37 °C.Inoculate 20 ml of overnight cultures into 1 L of Moore’s medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Incubate the cultures at 220 rpm and 37 °C until the cell density reaches OD600 = 0.4-0.5. Then, cool down the temperature of the cultures to 28 °C in a shaking incubator for 40 min at 220 rpm before adding IPTG.Add 1 ml 1 M IPTG to the 1 L cultures (final concentration 1 mM) and incubate for 2-3 h at 28 °C and 220 rpm for inducing protein expression.Harvest the induced cells by centrifuging the cultures using 500 ml centrifuge bottles and GS3 rotor of Sorvall RC-5C plus centrifuge at 7,000 rpm (8,288 x g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and store the pellet at -80 °C until purification.",
    "Resuspend the pellet with 50 ml HisTrap binding buffer containing one pill of complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail on ice. Lyse the cells by French press at 10,000 psi twice.Centrifuge the cell lysate using 30 ml tubes and SS34 rotor in Sorvall RC-5C plus centrifuge at 18,000 rpm (38,724 x g) for 30 min at 4 °C.Discard the pellet and harvest the supernatant containing soluble Soc or BAP-Hoc protein. Filter the supernatant through 0.22 μm Millipore filter units before loading onto the HisTrap column.Set up 1 ml HisTrap HP column on AKTA-prime system. Wash the column with 30 ml of water, followed by 30 ml of HisTrap binding buffer to equilibrate the column.Load the filtered supernatant onto the HisTrapHP column at a flowing speed of 1 ml/min (Increased flow rate will decrease protein binding to column.), followed by washing the loaded column with 50 ml HisTrap binding buffer.Set up the elution procedures of the HisTrap HP column on the AKTA-prime system. The parameters are as follows: Concentration (% Buffer B): 0; Gradient Length: 40; Target (% Buffer B): 100; Flow Rate: 1 ml/min; Fraction Base: ml; Fraction Size: 1; Pressure Limit: 0.3.

Aliquot the concentrated protein and store at -80 °C until needed.Soc protein biotinylation (4 h)Biotin N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters are the most popular type of biotinylation reagent. NHS-activated biotins react efficiently with primary amino groups (-NH2) of protein (the side chain of lysine residues and the N-terminus of each polypeptide) to form stable amide bonds.Exchange Soc protein gel filtration buffer (Tris buffer) with 1x PBS buffer (pH 7.4) using 10 ml Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (7K MWCO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Avoid buffers containing primary amines (e.g., Tris or glycine) as these will compete with the biotinylation reaction. Proteins in Tris or other amine-containing buffers must be exchanged into an amine-free buffer at pH 7.2-8.0. Concentrate Soc protein in PBS buffer to ~5 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filtration.Remove the vial of NHS-Biotin reagents from -20 °C storage and fully equilibrate it to room temperature for 30 min before opening to avoid moisture condensation inside the container. NHS-Biotin reagents are moisture-sensitive.Immediately before use, dissolve 2.0 mg NHS-Biotin reagent in 590 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent to prepare a 10 mM solution.",

    "Pick a single colony and inoculate into 20 ml sterile LB + M9A medium (equal volumes of LB and M9A) in a 125 ml flask. Grow at 37 °C for 6-8 h.Inoculate 5 ml fresh E. coli P301 culture into LB + M9A medium (500 ml) at a dilution of 1:100. Leave the cap loose to allow aeration and grow the culture in the shaking incubator at 37 °C to a density of 4 x 108 cells/ml (in the cell counter, if each small square has 5 cells/ml, the cell density is equivalent to 108 cells/ml).Infect the culture with 10-amber.13-amber.hoc-del.soc-delmutant T4 at an M.O.I. (number of phage added/each bacterial cell) of 4. It should be noted that phage T4 has no tropism to human cells, has no known toxicity or pathogenicity, and exhibits no preexisting immunity. The safety of T4 phage application in humans was reported. This involves simply adding a calculated volume of the phage solution into the bacterial culture. Mix the culture as you are adding the phage solution so that the phage is uniformly distributed into the culture. Put the culture back in the shaking incubator for 5 min.Superinfect at the same M.O.I. as above (a second T4 infection). Put the culture back in the shaking incubator and grow for 32 min more. At the 30th min quickly check the cell number under the microscope to see if the cell number begins to reduce. If the cell number is less than 4 x 108 cells/ml, just stop the infection and do centrifugation. If the cell number has not changed, leave the culture at 37 °C for 1-2 min more (Don’t leave for more than 35 min. The cells would have lysed). Reserve the Sorvall centrifuge ahead of time so that it is available when you need it.",
