    "Maintenance of  C. elegans  Since exophergenesis is a process that is influenced by food availability, make sure you provide constant, optimal conditions of worms’ culture:Keep worms at 20 °C for at least 2–3 generations before running an experiment (a necessary step, especially after thawing animals from -80 °C stocks).The authors avoid bleaching of gravid  C. elegans  followed by a short period of starvation of L1 larvae, to avoid the potential effects of bleach and food deficiency on exophergenesis in later stages of development. Instead, transfer gravid worms (or at any other desired developmental stage) to fresh NGM plates with bacterial food using a sterile platinum worm pick, or wash them off from old plates with M9 buffer and seed them using a pipette under sterile conditions. If you decide to transfer with M9, wash animals three times in the Eppendorf tube, to avoid contamination of a new plate with bacteria from the previous plate. Centrifugation at 2,000–3,000 rpm is permitted.Make sure worms have access to food ad libitum. Starvation severely affects exophergenesis. If you starve animals, maintain them for 2–3 generations with constant access to a food source before starting a new experiment.Minimize the risk of contamination by following good laboratory practices, wearing gloves, disinfecting the work surface, working beside the burner, sterilising the worm pick, etc. If you notice contamination (e.g., spots of other bacteria, or fungi on plates), discard the plate, and thaw a fresh stock of reporter strain. Otherwise, try to transfer eggs laid as far from the contamination as possible to an empty NGM plate, wait until they hatch, and transfer single worms to a fresh plate, preferably at the edge, where there is no bacterial food. Again, such worms should not be used for experiments before ensuring contamination is eliminated.",
    "Setup of worms for scoring exophers  Obtain a synchronized population of either:Eggs—transfer approximately 30–50 gravid worms with a worm pick to a fresh plate, allow them to lay eggs for 2–3 h (in the 20 °C incubator), and then remove adult worms. Alternatively, from a plate that contains mixed-stage worms, transfer eggs that contain 3-fold embryos (pretzel stage embryo) to a fresh plate.Freshly hatched L1 larvae—remove all larvae and adult worms from plate(s) with an unsynchronized population (by washing them off with M9), leaving only eggs on a plate. Place plate(s) in the incubator for 30 min–2 h (depending on how many eggs were initially on the plate, and how many are needed for your experiment; the shorter the period of incubation, the better synchronized the population will be), and allow them to hatch in the meantime.Once you obtain enough synchronized eggs (method a) or freshly hatched L1s (method b), transfer them to fresh plates. Try to maintain a similar number of worms per plate. For experiments with sufficient statistical power, seeding 50 worms per 60 mm Petri dish is optimal. If you seed more, you risk insufficient access to the food throughout the experiment. Avoid plates with fluoro-deoxyuridine (FUdR), which inhibits exopher production. Conversely, less than 20 worms per plate would require more than three biological repeats to reliably visualize the differences between the groups. Maintain worms at 20 °C unless your hypothesis requires otherwise. Synchronous growth of larvae at later stages  Monitor if the worms develop synchronously again at the L4 larval stage. Take the development of the vulva and its morphological differences in shape defined in subsequent sub-stages as a benchmark (Mok et al., 2015). To provide the best possible result reproducibility, sort worms at L4.5–L4.9 (approximately 43–46 h from hatching).",
    "This timing might require adjustment due to seasonal weather changes, if you do not use air conditioning set to a constant temperature throughout the year. Remove worms in other developmental stages. To ensure you do not miss any, you can transfer single worms of interest to fresh plates using a worm pick. Scoring exophers at adulthood day 2  The exophergenesis peak coincides with the highest egg-laying activity, as shown in Turek et al. (2021). The egg-laying behaviour of the hermaphrodite occurs ~65–128 h from hatching (Altun and Hall, 2012 in WormAtlas), with the maximal egg-laying at approximately 96 h. Therefore, for the highest reproducibility of the results, we score exophers on adulthood day 2, approximately 98 h (± 2 h) from hatching into L1 larvae.When worms reach the desired developmental stage, visualize them under the fluorescence microscope. At first, monitor their general fitness using brightfield—if the majority of control or single worms from the experimental group express abnormalities, do not use them for the research. Discard plates with contamination if not done earlier. A fluorescence stereomicroscope was used to score exophers in freely moving animals directly on NGM plates. We used a ZEISS Axio Zoom.V16 Motorized Fluorescence Stereo Zoom Microscope equipped with HXP 200 C fluorescence lamp (Kübler). For ACH81 and ACH93 strains, we used the Texas Red filter set to visualize wrmScarlet (wrmScarlet is fused to proteasome subunits of the BWM), and the GFP filter set (GFP is tagged to the mitochondrial outer membrane of the BWM). The GFP channel is not required if you are interested in the number of exophers, but not on the distribution of mitochondria.To acquire images with a confocal microscope, transfer worms onto freshly prepared 3% agarose (in H2O) pads on a microscope slide.",
    "Next, immobilize them with 25 μM tetramisole/levamisole and cover them with a round or square glass coverslip. We used an inverted Zeiss LSM 800 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 40× oil objective, equipped with 488-nm and 561-nm lasers, to excite the GFP and RFP fluorescent proteins, respectively. To investigate the presence and distribution of exophers, collect Z-stacks and process them with ZEN (Zeiss) or ImageJ (Fiji) software.Score the exophers on the ≥ 200 magnification under a fluorescence stereomicroscope. You will see the biggest vesicles even at lower magnification (16×, objective 1.0), but your quantification will not be precise (Figure 1C  , left panel). Most exophers will be located near the vulva region, but can also occur anywhere in the body cavity.Exophers are round vesicles that vary in size (Figure 1A). However, sometimes they remain attached to a releasing cell (Figure 1B–1C). Reject small vesicles with weak fluorescence that do not reach ~1/10 of the width of the BWM cell in quantifying exophergenesis, as well as any other irregular shaped fluorescent structures in the body cavity (Figure 1D).Data are collected as the number of exophers visible in a single worm from one experimental/control group. (e.g., if you have 40 animals on the plate, you should obtain 40 counts). Microsoft Excel is handy for the storage of the data generated this way. Maintain separate sheets for each biological repetition, to quickly detect any disturbances.Once you collect data from all repeats, we recommend you copy them to GraphPad Prism for further processing (statistical analysis, graphical visualization,  Figure 2)."
