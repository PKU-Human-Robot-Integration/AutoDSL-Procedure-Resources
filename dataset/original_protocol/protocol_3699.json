    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse treatment and single cell suspension of splenocytes\nTiming: 6 days\nFor this protocol, we will describe the treatment of mice and splenocyte isolation for further analysis of lymphocyte functions.\nTreatment of 8 weeks old mice with hydroxychloroquine by daily gavage\nPrepare 5 mg/mL HCQ in deionized water and gavage mice with 100 μL daily\nOn the 6th day, euthanize mice and harvest spleens following institutional animal guidelines. The spleens should be kept in 1× PBS on ice until further steps.\nCreate a single cell suspension of splenocytes by the following steps.\nPlace the spleen in a 6 well plate with some 1× PBS to keep spleen wet.\nPrepare a 50 mL tube with a 5 cm × 5 cm square of 40 μm nylon mesh.\nHomogenize the spleen with the end of a plunger from a 5 mL syringe, tamp the spleen against the bottom of the 6 well plate.\nAdd 10 mL of 1× PBS to the well of the plate in step 2 to resuspend.\nWith a 10 mL serological pipette, filter the splenocyte solution through the nylon mesh into the 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 7 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL of ACK lysing buffer for 3 min at 25°C.\nAdd 10 mL of 5% FCS in 1× PBS to the RBC-lysed splenocyte solution.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 7 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the splenocytes in 5 mL of 1× PBS.\nGather a new 15 mL tube and a 5 cm × 5 cm square of 40 μm nylon mesh.\nFilter the splenocyte solution through the nylon mesh into the 15 mL tube",
    "Optional: To distinguish the effects of treatment on lymphocyte function in different organs you can also harvest the liver, lymph nodes or blood from the mice. To create a single cell suspension of hepatic lymphocytes please refer to (Yoneyama et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), for lymph nodes lymphocytes to (Lim et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and for blood lymphocyte separation to (Spranger et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nOptional: For additional investigation of cell exhaustion upon HCQ or other treatments you can add anti-PD-1, Tim3 and CD69 to the extracellular master mix and stain unstimulated lymphocytes.\nTreatment of stimulated lymphocytes\nTiming: 8 h\nHere we describe the PMA/ionomycin stimulation experiment. For this experiment use splenocytes previously isolated from either HCQ treated or untreated mice.\nKey step: count splenocytes to ensure the final number of cells per well.\nTake desired cell number and spin down at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nDilute splenocyte at a final concentration of 2×106 splenocytes/mL in lymphocyte media\nAdd 100 UI/mL (final concentration) of IL-2 to lymphocyte media to make completed lymphocyte media\nSeed 100 μL of cell suspension in 96 V-bottom plate\nPause Point: Use splenocytes from untreated mice to test the effects of in vitro HCQ treatment on splenocytes.\nPrepare the treatment media by adding HCQ (molecular mass 319 g/mol) to completed lymphocyte media as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_626_5.csv\nAdd 50 μL of the HCQ treatment media to each well of the splenocytes of untreated mice and use technical triplicates for every HCQ concentration.\nPrepare the stimulation media by adding 8 μL/mL stimulation mix (PMA/ionomycin)\nAdd 50 μL of stimulation media to in vivo HCQ treated splenocytes or in vitro HCQ treated splenocytes as well as controls (the final concentration of stimulation mix is 2 μL/mL). Use one sample as unstimulated control.",
    "Pause Point: Now you have in vitro stimulated splenocytes in 200 μL, splenocytes from in vivo treated mice in 150 μL and unstimulated controls in 100 μL (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/626-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of treatment of splenocytes from treated and untreated mice\nL/D, Live/Dead\nAdd 50 μL completed lymphocyte media to splenocytes of treated mice and 100 μL to the unstimulated controls\nIncubate splenocytes in 37°C for 4 h\nSpin down plate at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nWash once with FACS buffer and discard the supernatant\nCritical: If you want to adapt this protocol, avoid centrifuge steps and other manipulations before the incubation of splenocytes to minimize the risk of cell death and improve cytokine signaling.\nOptional: Additional marker for cell exhaustion such as anti-PD-1, Tim3 and CD69 could be added to this panel to further investigate the influence of medications on lymphocytes.\nStain for flow cytometry analysis\nPrepare Live/Dead (L/D) stain by adding 1 μL/mL L/D stain to PBS\nResuspend cells in 50 μL L/D stain and incubate for 20 min in 4°C\nAdd 150 μl FACS buffer to each well and spin down plate at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nResuspend cells in 50 μL extracellular antibody master mix and incubate for 15 min in the dark at RT.\nAdd 150 μl FACS buffer to each well and spin down plate at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nResuspend cell in 100μL of BD Bioscience Fix/Perm and incubate at 4°C in the dark for 30 min\nSpin down plate at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nResuspend cells in 50 μL intracellular antibody master mix and incubate for 15 min in the dark in RT",
    "Add 150 μl FACS buffer to each well and spin down plate at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nDilute cells in 150 μl FACS Buffer for analysis for flow cytometry analysis\nAnalyze data using FlowJoTM software\nOptional: To get a better insight of the lymphocyte cytokine production profile, different concentrations of the stimulation mix can be applied. The recommended final concentration is 2 μL/mL but we observed positive TNFα and IFNγ signaling starting from a concentration of 0.5 μL/mL.\nProliferation and cytokine production of treated lymphocytes after antigen-specific activation\nTiming: 2–3 days\nFor this protocol we describe how to evaluate antigen-specific cytokine production as well as lymphocyte proliferation using CFSE stained OT-1 lymphocytes.\nSacrifice one 8 weeks old OT-1 mouse following institutional animal guidelines and harvest the spleen\nCreate a single cell suspension as described in step 2.\nResuspend 5×107 splenocyte cells in 10 mL prewarmed 0.1% BSA/PBS in 50 mL tube\nAdd 5 μL of a 5 mM stock solution CFSE on the wall of the 50 mL tube and vortex\nPut the 50 mL tube in a water bath 37°C for 6 min\nStop CFSE staining of cells by adding 25 mL FSC\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nWash cells once with completed media\nResuspend cells in completed lymphocyte media (see step 6) and resuspend cells with a final concentration of 2×106 splenocytes/mL\nSeed 100 μL per well of the cell suspension in a 96 well flat bottom plate\nPrepare treatment media as described in step 7\nPrepare stimulation media by adding 4 μg/mL OVA-I peptide to completed lymphocyte media (final concentration 1 μg/mL)\nAdd 50 μL of stimulation media to splenocytes. Use one sample as unstimulated control.",
    "Add 50 μL of treatment media to splenocytes.\nNote: In this experiment, it is crucial to add P/S to the media as the incubation time is longer and the risk for infection higher. Again, avoiding centrifuge steps until the incubation improves viability of the cells and consistency of the results.\nIncubate splenocytes in 37°C for 2 days\nSpin down plate at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant\nSave the supernatant to perform ELISA analysis following vendor’s instructions\nWash pellet once by adding 5 mL PBS, centrifuge at 400 g, 4°C, for 7 min and discard the supernatant.\nPerform an extracellular staining of cells for flow cytometry analysis as described in Step 15. Dilution of CFSE can be detected with the FITC channel."
