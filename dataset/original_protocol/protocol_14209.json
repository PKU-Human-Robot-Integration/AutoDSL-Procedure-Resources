    "All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals (mice) were followed in the experiments described in this manuscript.\nThis method uses FVBN adult mice, aged 16 - 20 weeks, found to be optimal for the purposes of this study. Day 1 includes steps 1 - 5 and Day 2 includes steps 6 - 7 (Figure 1).\n1. Equipment Preparation\nSecure an adequate supply of sterile, disposable syringes and needles, if ketamine/xylazine is used as the anesthetic (as recommended). If isoflurane is used as the anesthetic, check the oxygen tank and the fluid level of isoflurane to make sure there are adequate supplies for the experiment before starting. Also, assemble the nosecone breathing circuits and attach them to the induction box; attach new charcoal canisters to the breathing circuits. Prepare the induction box by turning on the oxygen and ascertaining that the second stage reads approximately 50 psi.\nTurn on the heating pad to 37 °C.\nPrepare the rectal temperature probe for the surgery.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nThis step includes anesthesia, hair removal, and positioning (adult FVBN mice-age 16 - 20 weeks).\nWeigh the mice and record the weights.\nAnesthetize the mice.\n\t\nAdminister ketamine and xylazine IP (80 - 100 mg/kg and 7.5 - 16 mg/kg, respectively). However, it is recommended to begin with lower doses of ketamine and xylazine (about 30 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, respectively).",
    "Maintain the anesthesia with about 0.1 - 0.25 times initial doses of ketamine/xylazine throughout the surgery. Ketamine and xylazine were the anesthetic agent(s) of choice in this particular study, as more reproducibility and survivability were observed. The anesthetic agent(s) of choice in other studies may be found to be different.  If isoflurane is used, put the mouse in an induction chamber and turn on isoflurane to 5% until the mouse loses full consciousness. Then use a nasal nosecone set at 1.5 - 2.5% isoflurane throughout the remainder of the procedure.\nMonitor the mice every 2 - 3 min by toe pinch to check for appropriate depth of anesthesia.\nShave the ventral neck area of the mouse.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on the preheated pad. Secure the paws and feet of the mouse to the surgical surface with tape.\nPlace artificial tear ointment onto the eyes to prevent drying out during surgery.\n3. Surgical Details\nMake a 1 cm incision in the right ventral neck over the jugular vein.\nApply one or two drops of lidocaine (1 - 2%) into the incision area for pain management and to promote vasodilation. Wait 2 min. for the lidocaine to take effect. \nExpose and isolate the right internal jugular vein via blunt dissection. Tie the vein off with 4-0 suture and gently retract the rostral end of the vessel with a hemostat. Cut a hole, using fine scissors, about 3 mm below or caudal to the tie, approximately halfway through the diameter of the vein.\nMark a PV-1 polyvinyl catheter 1.5 cm from the end and insert it into the jugular vein through the hole using a vessel dilator, and thread the catheter towards the caudal end of the vessel, approximately 1.5 cm.",
    "Tie the catheter securely within the caudal part of the vessel (below the cut), with 4-0 silk. Tie the rostral part of the vessel to the outside of the catheter with the loose ends of the suture which was used to tie off the rostral jugular vein, in step 3.3.\nTack the skin loosely back together around the catheter with 4-0 silk to help prevent loss of body heat and desiccation of tissues.\nConnect the catheter to a syringe containing heparinized saline (10 U/mL) and flush the catheter.\n4. Injections\nInject the Evans blue solution (50 μL of a 30 mg/mL solution in 0.9% normal, unheparinized saline, or approximately 50 mg/kg) into the jugular vein catheter, followed by a small volume of heparinized saline to flush the line.\n2 min later, inject substance P (100 μL of a 0.3 μM solution in 0.9% normal, unheparinized saline, or 1 nmol/kg), followed by a small volume of heparinized saline to flush the line. Substance P augments the extravasation of plasma proteins through the endothelial layer; in this protocol, it routinely induces an augmentation of plasma extravasation values of approximately 1.5-fold, making plasma extravasation values easier to measure.\nWait 18 min after the substance P is injected. During this time, the Evans blue dye will equilibrate and circulate.\nTerminate the experiment 18 min after the injection of substance P (20 min after Evans blue injection) by sacrificing the mouse with cervical dislocation. It is likely that the mouse can be directly cervically dislocated, without first giving an overdose of anesthetic, as the mouse is probably still well-anesthetized from the surgery. However, if it is necessary, an overdose of the anesthetics ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, or pentobarbital may be given, followed by cervical dislocation.\n5. Isolation of Organs",
    "Cut open the chest cavity of the mouse and gravity-perfuse (from a height of about 51 cm or 20\") the heart and blood vessels with 50 mL of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 3.5. pH 3.5 presumably preserves Evans blue binding to albumin.\nExcise 1 - 5 relevant organs (tissues) with a dissecting scalpel (e.g. urinary bladder, kidney, stomach, liver, pancreas, proximal or distal colon, ileum, duodenum, flank skin, ears, tail, heart, and/or lungs) and remove any residual contents, if present.\nRinse the organs in room temperature (RT) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1.44 g of Na2HPO4, 0.24 g of KH2PO4, 8.0 g of NaCl, and 0.20 g of KCl in 1 L, pH 7.4).\nBlot the organs with tissue, cut each organ in half, and weigh each half (wet weights, in g).\nDry one half of the tissue in a drying oven at 150 °C, on foil, for 48 h.\nPlace the other tissue half in a consistent volume (up to 200 µL) of formamide in a microfuge tube for 48 h (and up to 72 h) to extract the Evans blue.\n6. Measurement of Tissue OD\nRemove 50 µL of Evans blue-infused formamide (after 48 - 72 h RT incubation) from the microfuge tube and place into one well of a 96-well polystyrene plate. Be careful not to transfer tissue pieces along with the formamide.\nPlace 50 µL of new, pure formamide into each of two empty wells of the 96-well plate for the blanks.\nMeasure and record the OD620 of each well of the 96-well plate on an absorbance plate reader. 620 nm is the absorbance max of Evans blue.\n7. Calculation of Plasma Extravasation\nWeigh the dry tissue half which has been in the oven for 48 h.",
    "Calculate the wet weight/dry weight ratio for the specific organ of interest from each individual mouse, starting with the wet weight of this tissue half (obtained in step 5.4), divided by the dry weight of this same tissue half (obtained in step 7.1).\nCalculate the dry weight (in g) of the tissue half in formamide by dividing the wet weight of the tissue half before it was placed in formamide (obtained in step 5.4) by the wet: dry weight ratio for the specific organ of interest (calculated in step 7.2).\nCalculate the corrected OD620 values. Starting with the OD620 value from each experimental well of the 96-well plate (containing Evans blue-infused formamide from each tissue, obtained in step 6.3), subtract the blank well OD620 value (the mean OD620 value of the two wells containing pure formamide, prepared in step 6.2, OD620 values obtained in step 6.3) from each experimental value.\nCalculate the plasma extravasation value by dividing the corrected OD620 (calculated in step 7.4) by the dry weight of the tissue half in formamide (calculated in step 7.3). The units of plasma extravasation will be OD620/g dry weight.\nAnalyze data and express as the mean ± SEM. Statistically compare groups by t test or one-way analysis of variance and Scheffé's multiple-comparison test (lycofs01.lycoming.edu), as appropriate.\nSubscription Required.
