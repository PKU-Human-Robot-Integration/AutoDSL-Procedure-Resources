    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] depicts the complete workflow for the procedure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/905-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of single cell isolation from mouse brain tissue for glio-vascular cell enriched single-cell RNA sequencing\nGraphical summary of the main steps to obtain a live single cell suspension of enriched mouse brain vascular cells.\nNote: It is not recommended to handle more than 2 samples per person in each experiment to ensure high cell viability. This minimizes the processing time per sample in each step.\nMouse brain preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nAnesthetize a mouse (6–12 months old, male or female) with isoflurane and conduct a trans-cardial perfusion using ice-cold DPBS.\n25 mL of PBS would be used during the perfusion at a flow of 10–15 mL/min.\nCollect and store brain tissue in ice-cold HBSS.\nCell dissociation and myelin removal\nTiming: 150 min\nPrepare enzyme mix 1 (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).\nWarm enzyme mix 1 at 37°C for 10 min in a laboratory oven.\nDissect out cortical tissue on a 100 mm petri dish (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/905-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Brain tissue dissection, cell dissociation, and MACS separator setup\n(A–D) Step-by-step dissection of cortical brain tissue. Scale bar, 1 cm. (A) Whole mouse brain. (B) Remove the cerebellum from the cerebrum. (C) Halve the cerebrum along the longitudinal fissure and dissect out the subcortex, hippocampus, and midbrain. (D) The final dissected cortex is used for downstream neural cell dissociation and isolation of vascular enriched cells.",
    "(E–G) Brain tissue dissociation and generation of homogeneous cell suspension. (E) Consistency of the initial brain mince using surgical scissors in enzyme mix 1. Brain chunks should be small enough to pass through a Pasteur pipet. (F) Brain suspension with the addition of enzyme mix 2. The cortex is further dissociated after passing through a Pasteur pipet. At this stage the suspension should be turning cloudy. (G) Cell suspension after passing through a 20 G and 23 G needle. There are no visible chunks, and the suspension should be murky with a smooth consistency.\n(H) Quadro MACS Separator set up.\nNote: We recommend placing the dissected cortex on a Kimwipe soaked in PBS to prevent slippage during the dissection process. The process of dabbing the surfaces of brain cortical tissue with a Kimwipe helps in the removal of meninges that contain superficial vessels, meningeal, and fibroblast-like cells. This technique reduces potential sources of contamination during glio-vascular cell profiling.\nKeep dissected brains fully submerged in cold HBSS as enzyme mix 1 is heating up.\nAdd 2925 μL of enzyme mix 1 into an empty 5 mL snap cap Eppendorf tube (per sample).\nNote: A 5 mL tube is recommended for this step as it is easier for dissection scissors to reach to the bottom to mince the samples.\nOptional: Alternatively, the slicing process can be performed in petri dish with a blade or dissection scissor if the users find it easier to do so. The critical point is to mince the brain tissues efficiently to reduce the time between mincing and incubation.\nMove brain cortices into the 5 mL tube with enzyme mix 1.\nNote: Remove excess HBSS when moving dissected cortices to 5 mL Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Cut the brain tissue into small pieces with sharp dissection scissors, until small enough to pass through the opening of a Pasteur pipet (approximately 30 s), see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E.\nNote: Do not pipet to test if the chunks are small enough. Suction from pipetting may cause brain chunks to stick to the pipet tip filter leading to sample loss. Dissection scissors must be sterilized using 70% ethanol before use.\nIncubate samples for 17 min at 37°C under continuous rotation at 20 rpm using a rotator.\nDuring the incubation, prepare enzyme mix 2 at room temperature (RT; 20°C–26°C) (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).\nNote: Do not prewarm enzyme mix 2.\nAfter incubation, remove the tube from the laboratory oven and add 45 μL of enzyme mix 2 per sample.\nMix the tissue/enzyme solution 10–15 times at a rate of 1 mL/s using a sterilized glass cotton-plugged Pasteur pipet topped with a rubber bulb (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCritical: If a larger piece of tissue gets stuck to the pipet tip, tap the bottom of the tube until the tissue is dislodged. Make sure that the solution passes the pipet smoothly before moving on to the next step. Be careful that the solution does not touch the filter.\nIncubate samples for 12 min at 37°C under continuous rotation at 20 rpm.\nPass the tissue/enzyme solution 5 times using a 1 mL syringe with a 20 G needle at a rate of 0.5 mL/s.\nNote: Each pass is one cycle of (in/out)\nSwitch to a 1 mL syringe with 23 G needle and pass the tissue/enzyme solution 10 times at a rate of 0.25 mL/s until solid pieces are no longer visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).",
    "Critical: Avoid introducing bubbles during the mixing process. Use of a syringe larger than 1 mL increases the probability of bubble introduction. We recommend using a 1 mL syringe.\nOptional: While they have not been tested in this protocol, commercialized tissue dissociating devices (e.g., gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator with Heaters. Miltenyi Biotec; Cat# 130-096-427) might also be used for steps 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. The users are recommended establishing a customized program for tissue dissociation based on our protocol.\nIncubate samples for 10 min at 37°C under continuous rotation at 20 rpm.\nDuring incubation, rinse a 70 μm cell strainer with 2 mL of ice-cold (calcium and magnesium free) DPBS.\nTransfer the tissue/enzyme solution to a 50 mL conical tube and add 20 mL ice-cold DPBS.\nCritical: All steps from this time onward must be on ice unless noted otherwise.\nApply the tissue suspension to the 70 μm cell strainer placed on a separate 50 mL collection tube on ice.\nCentrifuge tissue suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant carefully and completely.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1,800 μL of cold MACS buffer (4°C).\nAdd 200 μL of Myelin Removal Beads.\nMix well. Incubate for 15 min at 37°C without rotation.\nAfter incubation, add 18 mL of cold MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare three LS columns per sample (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nPlace the columns on the Quadro MACS Separator with MACS MultiStand and rinse the columns with 3 mL of MACS buffer.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL MACS buffer.\nPlace 15 mL conical collection tubes below each column.\nApply 1 mL cell suspension per each LS column.\nWash column twice with 1 mL of MACS buffer.",
    "Collect total effluent.\nNote: Wait until the buffer in the column goes through before adding the next 1 mL of buffer.\nCombine eluents from the 3 separate columns of the same sample.\nCentrifuge the eluent at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRed blood cell removal\nTiming: 10 min\nDuring centrifugation, prepare 1× Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution.\nNote: Add 0.5 mL of 10× Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution to 4.5 mL ddH2O. (5 mL of 1× solution per sample). Keep the solution at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of ice-cold MACS buffer.\nAdd 5 mL of 1× Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution to the cell suspension.\nVortex gently for 5 s.\nNote: Please do not use vortex settings above 600 rpm.\nIncubate at RT for 2 min.\nCritical: Increased incubation time will damage the cells.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nMicroglia removal\nTiming: 1 h\nNote: In comparison to the entirety of the mouse cortex, our single cell suspension enriches vascular cell types (e.g., smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells) by targeted removal of microglia. The addition of the myelin removal beads also contributes to the removal of the oligodendrocyte population.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 90 μL of MACS buffer.\nAdd 10 μL of CD11b MicroBeads.\nIncubate for 15 min in a 4°C refrigerator.\nCritical: Do not incubate on ice.\nAfter the 15 min incubation, add 2 mL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDuring centrifugation, set one MS column per sample on the Octo MACS Separator with MACS MultiStand and rinse columns with 500 μL of MACS buffer.\nPlace collection tubes on ice under each MS column to collect effluent.\nAspirate the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of MACS buffer.\nApply the cell suspension to the MS column.\nWash columns three times with 500 μL of MACS buffer.\nCollect total effluent.\nNote: Wait until the buffer in the column goes through before adding the next 500 μL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDead cell removal\nTiming: 30 min\nDuring centrifugation, prepare 1X Binding buffer.\nNote: Add 4.75 mL ddH2O to 0.25 mL of 20X Binding Buffer Stock Solution per sample. Keep on ice. This dilution yields 1.5 mL of excess buffer. 20X Binding Buffer Stock Solution is provided in the Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec; Cat# 130-090-101).\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of Dead Cell Removal MicroBeads (provided in the Dead Cell Removal Kit).\nIncubate for 15 min at RT.\nDuring incubation, rinse 1 MS column per sample with 500 μL of 1× Binding buffer.\nAfter incubation, add 1 mL of 1× Binding buffer to the cell/bead suspension.\nPlace 15 mL collection tubes below each column.\nApply the cell suspension to the MS column.\nWash the column four times with 500 μL of 1× Binding buffer.\nCollect everything.\nNote: Wait until the buffer in the column goes through before adding the next 500 μL of 1× Binding buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCell viability assay\nTiming: 30 min\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cell suspension solution (0.04% BSA - see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension and mix thoroughly with 10 μL of trypan blue.",
    "Load 10 μL of the mixture onto a disposable hemacytometer and determine the cell viability using a bright-field microscope (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/905-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell viability evaluation of isolated single cells from mouse cortical brain tissues\n(A and B) Representative hemocytometer image of cells stained with trypan blue. Cell suspension and trypan blue (1:1 ratio) were mixed and loaded onto a disposable hemacytometer. Live cells with intact cell membranes exclude trypan blue (open arrow), whereas cells with membrane disruption (i.e., dead cells) are strained blue (closed arrow). Images were taken using an EVOS Microscope under 10× (A; scale bar, 400 μm) and 20× (B; Scale bar, 100 μm).\n(C) Representative FSC-A/SSC-A plot and doublet discrimination plot with corresponding gating.\n(D and E) Representative results of cell viability assay using flow cytometry. Sample viability was assessed by a live/dead stain using fluorogenic ester Calcein-AM (CAM) and the nucleic acid dye Ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1). A total of 5,000 cells were analyzed using BD Accuri Flow Cytometer. CAM positive cells are ‘viable/live,’ whereas EthD-1 positive cells are ‘dead’. The histogram plots show the fluorescence emission profiles of samples treated with CAM (green) or EthD-1 (red). Unstained sample fluorescence emission is shown in black. (C) The shift in FL1 fluorescence in CAM-treated cells indicates that over 97% of cells are viable. (D) The FL2 fluorescence shift in EthD-1 treated cells indicates that about 13% of cells have a loss of cell membrane integrity and are considered non-viable. X axis: fluorescence intensity; Y axis; relative cell count for each population (normalized to mode).\nNote: The cell viability can also be assessed by flow cytometry using the LIVE/DEAD Viability /Cytotoxicity Kit.\nCritical: Do not proceed with scRNA-Seq if cell viability is below 90%.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in the cell suspension solution. Adjust the cell suspension to ~ 1×106 cells/mL of live cells.\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing\nTiming: 4 weeks\nFor complete details on scRNA-Seq and data analysis, please refer to Yamazaki et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nProceed to the 10× Chromium protocol.\nNote: Approximately 3,000 glio-vascular cells per animal were loaded into each sample well according to the 10× Chromium Controller protocol (10× Genomics).\nOptional: After loading into the 10× Chromium Controller, surplus cells can be frozen as cell pellet or in an appropriate buffer (for RNA extraction) at −80°C for real-time PCR experiments at a later time to examine if the isolated cells are vascular cell-enriched populations. Please also refer to “Validation of vascular cell-enriched populations” in the ‘expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]’ section. To ensure the optimal cell viability for scRNA-seq, the isolated single cells should be subjected to 10× Chromium Controller immediately.\nPrepare libraries for scRNA-Seq using Chromium™ Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v2. Single cell libraries were constructed according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced at the 3′ end by an Illumina HiSeq 4000 Sequencing System at an average depth of 60,000 reads per cell.",
    "Note: If you are testing differential gene expressions between condition A and B, consider using a sequencing design in which confounding caused by batch or lane effects are eliminated (Auer and Doerge, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). For example, if you have four scRNA-Seq libraries generated from four biological replicates (e.g., samples from animal 1 with condition A, animal 2 with condition A, animal 3 with condition B, and animal 4 with condition B), the four libraries are pooled, and the pool is divided into four equal amounts that are subjected for sequencing by multiple lanes. The number of lanes utilized for sequencing should be determined such that the targeted reading depth per cell is sufficiently recovered in each sample.\nNote: Our data in this manuscript was completed using a V2 kit. As newer kits become available, we recommend following manufacturer instructions for use.\nFollowing scRNA-Seq, data can be analyzed by Seurat (Sajita et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or other platforms."
