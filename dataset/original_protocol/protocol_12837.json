    "NOTE: Perform all steps at room temperature unless otherwise stated and keep buffers on ice or in the fridge (except from the Elution buffer containing SDS). The protocol is divided into 5 sections: Preparation of RNA samples; preparation of beads for IP; binding of BrU-labelled RNA to beads; elution and purification of bound BrU-labelled RNA by 3 steps phenol-phenol/chloroform-chloroform extraction; analysis of RNA (in this example using RT-qPCR)\n1. Preparation of RNA Samples\nCount HEK293T cells using an automated cell counter and seed 3,500,000 cells in a 10 cm petri dish in 10 mL growth media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin) to obtain a total of >40 µg RNA upon extraction 48 h later. Maintain cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n48 h after seeding, aspirate 8 mL growth media and leave 2 mL behind to avoid drying out the cells. Add 2 mM BrU and any treatment to the 8 mL aspirated growth media, and remove the residual 2 mL from the cells before reapplying the 8 mL BrU containing growth media. Avoid the use of fresh media upon application of the BrU to the cells, since this can induce changes in gene expression.\nIncubate the cells for 1 h with BrU and treatment. Wash the cells in 5 mL Hank's buffer and trypsinize the cells using 2 mL 0.05% trypsin. Add 8 mL growth media to stop the reaction, transfer the cells to a 15 mL tube, and spin down the cells for 2 min at 1,000 x g.",
    "Remove the supernatant and extract total RNA from the cell pellet using an RNA isolation kit (see Table of Materials) or any other preferred method, and elute in RNase-free H2O. Store the RNA at -80 °C until ready to proceed.\n2. Preparation of Beads for IP\nPrepare beads in batches for the number of samples to be investigated plus one extra to account for loss during pipetting and whirl mixing. Resuspend anti-Mouse IgG magnetic beads thoroughly by whirl mixing and take out 20 µL beads per sample in an RNase-free 1.5 mL tube. Place the 1.5 mL tube in a magnetic stand and leave approximately 20 s for the beads to collect on the side.\nRemove the supernatant, take out the tube from the magnetic stand, and resuspend in 400 µL 1x BrU-IP buffer by pipetting. Spin the tube very briefly for 2 s in a table-top centrifuge, place it back in the magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant. Repeat the washing step once.\nBlock unspecific binding to the beads using heparin. Resuspend the beads in 1 mL 1x BrU-IP+ 1 mg/mL heparin buffer, and leave rotating for 30 min. Wash the beads once, as in step 2.2.\n\tNOTE: Heparin is a negatively charged polymer, which will compete with RNAs for binding. tRNA or other irrelevant RNAs can also be used if the downstream application is not sequencing.\nResuspend the beads in 1 mL 1x BrU-IP buffer and add 1.25 µg/sample anti-α-Bromodeoxyuridine antibody, which also recognizes BrU. Incubate the beads for 1 h while rotating, or overnight at room temperature.",
    "Wash the beads three times as in step 2.2. Resuspend the beads in 50 µL/sample 1x BrU-IP buffer supplemented with 1 mM BrU and leave rotating for 30 min to lower the sensitivity of the antibody bound to the beads and hereby the risk of unspecific binding during IP.\nWash the beads three times as in step 2.2, and resuspend in 50 µL/sample 1xBrU-IP buffer.\n3. Binding of BrU-Labelled RNA to Beads\nMeasure RNA concentrations in the RNA extracts from step 1.3 using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, and dilute 40 µg RNA from each sample in RNase-free H2O to a total volume of 200 µL.\nHeat RNA samples for 2 min at 80 °C to denature RNA and spin briefly in a tabletop centrifuge. Add 200 µL 2x BrU-IP+BSA/RNAse inhibitor.\nAdd 50 µL resuspended and prepared beads from step 2.6 to each sample and leave rotating 1 h. Wash the beads four times as in step 2.2.\n4. Elution and Purification of RNA by 3 Steps Phenol-phenol/Chloroform-chloroform Extraction\nElute RNA and perform phenol extraction\nResuspend the beads in 200 µL Elution buffer to elute RNA, and quickly thereafter add 200 µL phenol, pH 6.6 (CAUTION: Toxic, see note below step 4.1.2) to remove any non-RNA molecules from the sample.\nWhirl mix the sample, and spin 3 min at 25,000 x g in a tabletop centrifuge.\n\t\tNOTE: Phenol is toxic and should be handled in a fume hood wearing skin protection. The slightly acidic pH ensures that only RNA, and not DNA, is extracted. The RNA will remain in the upper aqueous phase due to the hydrophilic nature of charges. The hydrophobic cores of proteins will bind phenol and move to the lower organic phenol-phase.\nPerform phenol-chloroform extraction",
    "Aspirate as much upper-phase as possible (approximately 190 µL of the 200 µL, depending on experience in handling) and move it to a tube with 200 µL phenol/chloroform, pH 6.6 (CAUTION: Toxic, see note). Make sure to aspirate the same amount across samples.\nWhirl mix the sample and spin for 3 min at 25,000 x g.\n\t\tNOTE: Chloroform is toxic and should be handled in a fume hood wearing skin protection. Chloroform is added to remove phenol, which can affect the downstream analysis of RNA by inhibiting reverse transcription14 and polymerase chain reactions15.\nPerform chloroform extraction by aspirating the aqueous upper phase as before (now approximately 180 µL), and transfer to a tube containing 200 µL chloroform. Whirl mix the sample and spin 3 min at 25,000 x g.\nAspirate the aqueous upper phase as before (now approximately 170 µL) and transfer it to a tube containing 17 µL (1/10 volume) 3 M CH3COONa, pH 6.0. To neutralize and precipitate RNA from the aqueous solution, add 2 µL glycogen (20 mg/mL), which precipitates together with RNA and makes the RNA pellet more visible.\nAdd 500 µL 96% ethanol to increase binding between the salt ions and RNA and mix by inverting the tube a couple of times. Leave the tube overnight at -20 °C or 15 min on dry ice.\nSpin the sample at 25,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min. Discard supernatant without disturbing the pellet and wash the pellet in 185 µL 75% ethanol to remove any residual salt. Spin at 25,000 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant completely without disturbing the pellet and leave the pellet to dry 5-10 min with an open lid. Resuspend in 10 µL RNase-free H2O applied on the side of the tube to avoid disturbing the pellet.",
    "5. Analysis of RNA\nPrepare cDNA using a cDNA reverse transcription kit (see Table of Materials) or any other preferred method using 2 µL RNA sample and 1 µg yeast total RNA as carrier RNA for the cDNA synthesis reaction (not used if cDNA is used for next generation sequencing). Use 1 µg RNA without yeast RNA for cDNA preparation of corresponding input.\nDilute cDNA 1:25 and mix 9 µL diluted cDNA with 10 µL qPCR Master mix and 1 µL fluorogenic probe, both specified in the Table of Materials.\n\tNOTE: The cDNA dilution depends on the cDNA preparation and qPCR method used.\nRun the following qPCR program (e.g., on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system or equivalent): 2 min at 50 °C, 20 s at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C.\nSubscription Required.
