    "All procedures involving animals described in this protocol were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Breeding mice to express fluorescent reporter protein in interneuron subpopulations\nPair homozyogous, Cre-dependent tdTomato male mouse with either homozygous SOM-Cre female or homozygous PV-Cre female mouse.\n\tNOTE: Other specific neuronal populations may be targeted by using the appropriate Cre lines.\nAllow heterozygous offspring to mature to at least 3 weeks of age before proceeding. For experiments described here, genotyping is not necessary, as homozygous parents produce offspring that are all heterozygous for both cell type-specific Cre recombinase and Cre-dependent reporter alleles.\n2. Performing unilateral stereotaxic injection of viral construct\nAdjust settings of the micropipette puller for injection pipettes as indicated in the instrument user manual (see Table 1 for recommended settings). Pull the glass micropipette.\nBreak the tip of the sharp end of the pipette such that the tip diameter is approximately 30 µm with minimal taper over several millimeters.\nUsing previously documented procedures, decide on the appropriate titer and volume of virus to be injected. In the experiments described here, 1.0 μL (titer: 3.1-5.7 TU/mL) injected unilaterally produced good results.\nBackfill the full volume of the pipette with mineral oil. Load the pipette onto the microsyringe and flow a small amount of mineral oil through the tip to ensure the tip is not clogged.\nFrontfill at least 1.0 μL of viral construct. The recombinant adeno-associated viral vector used in these experiments was AAV2-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP.\nArrange sterile drape in a surgical area. Sterilize tools for stereotaxic procedure and place it on the drape.",
    "Anesthetize SOM-tdTomato or PV-tdTomato heterozygous animal using isoflurane (3% for induction, 1.5-2% for maintenance) and oxygen mixture. Periodically confirm surgical level of anesthesia with toe pinch throughout surgery. Ensure animal does not move beyond the surgical plan of anesthesia by monitoring respirations every 10-15 min.\nShave the top of the animal’s head. Apply 70% isopropyl alcohol and iodine-based solution liberally to surgical area and ophthalmic ointment to eye sockets to prevent drying of the membrane. Administer bupivacaine/lidocaine (1:1 ratio, 1.0 mg/kg) subcutaneously to surgical site for local anesthetic.\nFit the animal into stereotaxic frame.\nUse scalpel to make incision along sagittal axis of skin overlying the dorsal surface of the skull. Retract skin using forceps. Hydrate skull with 0.9% saline as necessary.\nOn the surface of the skull, lightly mark the intersection of anterior and lateral coordinates with a cross in pencil. Drill a hole at the appropriate coordinates in the transverse plane (in mm relative to Bregma, for cingulate cortex (Cg) injection: anterior 0.2, lateral 0.3; for posterior thalamus (Po) injection: posterior 2.25, lateral 3.4).\n\tNOTE: Markings should extend beyond the boundaries of the burr hole to provide guidance for accurate placement of pipette.\nTurn on and balance the air table.\nReposition electrode manipulator of the stereotaxic frame at 0° for injections into Cg, or 45° in the coronal plane for injections into Po.\nAttach the syringe pump to the electrode manipulator. Attach the microsyringe pump controller to the syringe pump.\nNavigate pipette tip near (but not touching) the surface of the brain, at the intersection of markings created in Step 2.11. Advance the pipette at approximately 1 mm/s along its longitudinal axis into the brain either 0.9 mm (injection in Cg) or 3.1 mm (injection in Po). Wait for 10 min before proceeding.",
    "Inject 1.0 µL of viral construct over a period of 10 min (100 nL/min). If welling of virus from pipette insertion site is observed, slow the injection rate to 50 nL/min.\nAfter injection, wait for 10 min before slowly retracting the injection pipette.\nSuture to close the scalp incision and administer 2-5 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously.\nDiscontinue isoflurane and monitor animal during emergence from anesthesia. Allow to recover according to procedures described by Institution’s Animal Care and Use Committee, including further administration of analgesics.\n3. Preparation of acute brain slices\nAllow at least 3 weeks for the expression of viral construct before harvesting tissue.\nPrepare 1 L of artificial cerebral spinal fluid for slicing procedure (slicing artificial cerebral spinal fluid, sACSF). See Table 2 for ingredients.\nThroughout the slicing procedure, supply sACSF with dissolved 95% O2/5% CO2 mixture, delivered via gas dispersion tube.\nPrepare ice cold bath for vibrating blade microtome. Mount ice-cold specimen stage onto microtome and fix sapphire blade in place for tissue sectioning.\nAnesthetize mouse with 3% isoflurane and oxygen until loss of righting reflex.\nDecapitate the mouse using guillotine and immediately submerge head in 4°C sACSF. To preserve the health of the tissue, complete the following steps as swiftly as possible.\nOpen skull cavity by making a small incision at the base of the skull and gently removing each skull plate. Gently remove underlying dura mater.\nWhile the brain is still in the skull cavity, use the razor blade to remove the cerebellum. Make a second vertical cut along the sagittal plane in the left hemisphere, just lateral to the midline.\nPrepare tissue block for sectioning.",
    "Gently lift the brain from the skull cavity. Place the brain on the filter paper with the flat, sagittal plane down. Guide the filter paper over the blocking template and align the brain to the underlying template outline (Supplementary Figure 1).\nMake two parallel cuts in the coronal plane as indicated by the lines on the template. Add a small drop of sACSF to keep filter paper wet, if necessary.\nPlace the tissue block in 4°C sACSF briefly while step 3.8.4 is conducted.\nApply a small amount of super glue to the ice-cold specimen stage.\nLift the tissue block from cold sACSF. Use the corner of an absorbent towel to wick away excess sACSF. Glue the posterior coronal plane of the tissue block to the specimen stage, with the dorsal surface of the brain facing the sapphire blade.\nCollect 500 µm thick coronal brain slices. Place slices of interest on nylon mesh (Supplementary Figure 2) in 34 °C sACSF and allow the container to reach room temperature.\n\tNOTE: For experiments described here, electrophysiological recordings were collected from a coronal section centered approximately 2.25 mm posterior to bregma to study a non-primary sensory area, medial secondary visual cortex (V2MM).\n4. Preparation of experimental artificial cerebral spinal fluid (eACSF) bags containing dissolved volatile anesthetic isoflurane\nPrepare 300 mL of a stock mixture of 3.0% isoflurane.\n\t\nIn a sealed polytetrafluoroethylene gas bag, add ~100 mL of 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture to 20-30 mL of liquid isoflurane and a small amount of 0.9% saline. Wait at least for 30 min to allow equilibration of isoflurane between liquid and gas phases.\nDetermine the amount of saturated isoflurane gas, Vsat, to add to the stock bag using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61333/61333equ01.jpg",
    "where P%stock is the target composition of the stock gas (3% in this case), Vstock is the final volume of the stock gas bag, Pisoflurane is the partial pressure of isoflurane at room temperature (~240 mmHg), and Ptotal is the atmospheric pressure (~760 mmHg).\nAdd the calculated amount of saturated gas to an empty gas bag and fill the bag with a volume of 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture to bring the total volume of stock bag to 300 mL.\nPrepare 2 L of artificial cerebral spinal fluid for perfusion of the slice during the experiment (experimental ACSF, eACSF). See Table 2 for ingredients. Dissolve 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture into solution.\nPrepare two separate bags of Control and Isoflurane solutions.\n\t\nTo an empty polytetrafluoroethylene gas bag, add 600 mL eACSF and 600 mL of 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture. Label this bag as Control.\nTo another empty polytetrafluoroethylene gas bag, add 300 mL of eACSF. Label this bag as Isoflurane.\nChoose a physiologically relevant equilibrated gas phase concentration of isoflurane. Experiments were conducted using gas concentrations equivalent to 1.3% isoflurane. Mice lose righting reflex, and presumably consciousness, at 0.9% inhaled isoflurane.\nUse the following equation to calculate the equivalent gas phase concentration at room temperature, P%(Troom)31:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61333/61333equ02.jpg\n\t\twhere P%(Tbody) is the physiologically relevant gas phase concentration chosen in Step 4.3.3, Troom is 25 °C, and Tbody is 37 °C.\nUse the following equation to determine volume of gas from stock gas bag, Vstock, to add to the Isoflurane solution.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61333/61333equ03.jpg\n\t\twhere Vsolution is the volume of eACSF in ISOFLURANE bag (300 mL), P%(Troom) is entered from equation (2), λ is the saline/gas Ostwald partition coefficient of isoflurane (λ = 1.232), and P%stock is the gas phase concentration of the stock gas bag (P%stock = 3.0%).",
    "To the Isoflurane solution bag, add the volume of gas from the stock gas bag, Vstock, calculated in Step 4.3.5.\nTo the Isoflurane solution bag, add a volume of 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture to bring the total volume of gas in the Isoflurane solution bag to 300 mL.\nShake both Control and Isoflurane bags on shaker for at least 1 h to allow isoflurane phase equilibration.\nAfter all data has been collected, the correct concentration may be verified by using an anesthetic gas monitor to measure equilibrated gas concentration of isoflurane above the remaining solution in bag.\nReport experimental concentrations of volatile gases in aqueous units, as millimolar concentrations are more robust to changes in temperature. Use the following equation to convert room temperature gas phase concentration, P%(Troom), to equivalent aqueous concentration (Caqueous, in mM)31:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61333/61333equ04.jpg\n\twhere α is the saline/gas Bunsen partition coefficient for isoflurane at 25°C32.\n5. Preparation of hardware and software for multi-channel recordings\nSet up 16-channel data acquisition system according to manufacturer instructions.\n\tNOTE: Several commercially available amplifiers and data acquisition systems can be used to collect multi-channel recordings. In the experiments described here, analog signals are delivered via an electrode reference panel to two amplifiers, where they are amplified (2000x) and filtered (0.1-10kHz). Analog inputs to the data acquisition system are digitized at 40kHz.\nFasten the appropriate 16-channel headstage adaptor to a microscope micromanipulator. Orient the adaptor such that the female connector ports are facing downward.\nAdjust the angle of operation of this micromanipulator such that it is oriented downward toward the recording chamber, at an angle approximately 70° relative to horizontal.\nConnect the headstage input to a 16 x 1 probe for in vitro electrophysiology via the headstage adaptor anchored to the micromanipulator.\nConnect the headstage output connector to the data acquisition system.",
    "Install appropriate software for data acquisition. Configure 15 input channels to correspond to input signals from the first 15 multi-channel probe contacts. Configure the remaining channel to receive input from the intracellular electrode.\n\tNOTE: Take care to consider electrode and adaptor maps when collecting and analyzing data, to ensure the appropriate signal corresponds to the electrode contact from which it was collected.\n6. Configuration of light stimulation protocols\nSet up light delivery system and install the accompanying software.\nOpen the software. Choose hardware wiring configuration in which a Trigger Source (Digital/TTL Out) provides Trigger In signal to the light delivery system, and the light delivery system provides Trigger Out signal to a 470 nm LED.\nMount high-power objective lens. Using digital camera, calibrate high-power objective for use with light delivery system.\nCreate new profile sequence of light stimulation profiles.\n\t\nCreate a pattern of choice. In the experiments described here, a circle of diameter 150 µm is used to allow layer-specific activation of axon terminals.\nTo construct a profile sequence, copy and paste this profile for each of any number of trials.\nCreate a waveform list that contains waveforms of any light intensity, pulse duration, or pulse number.\nRandomly assign waveforms to each profile. Each profile with its assigned waveform corresponds to one trigger pulse from a Digital TTL input, or one trial.\nSave the profile sequence.\nIn the data acquisition software, create a new protocol.\n\t\nSet the number of trials to equal the number of profiles in the profile sequence just created.\nChoose signal inputs to match those configured in Step 5.6. Configure a protocol that provides a single digital TTL output, recording from these 16 input channels for an appropriate amount of time before and after the digital trigger.\n7. Placing multi-channel probe in ex vivo brain tissue slice",
    "Perfuse bubbled eACSF (not in sealed bags) at 3-6 mL/min.\nTransfer the brain slice containing area of interest onto mesh grid in microscope perfusion chamber. Anchor with platinum harp (see Supplementary Figure 3).\nRotate mesh grid such that the line of electrode contacts on the distal end of the multi-channel probe is approximately perpendicular to the pial surface.\nUnder broadfield illumination and under fine control of the micromanipulator, lower the multi-channel probe toward the surface of the slice.\nRotate the filter cube turret to engage the appropriate filter cube for visualization of the fluorescent reporter protein expressed in axon terminals of cortical afferents. If necessary, rotate the slice to more precisely align the probe with the pial surface.\nPosition the probe just above the plane of the slice, ~200 µm short of the final target position along the x-axis, leaving at least one channel outside the boundary of the area of tissue being recorded\nSlowly insert the probe into the slice by moving the manipulator along its longitudinal axis. To minimize damage to the tissue, only advance the probe to the extent that the sharp tips are just visible below the tissue surface. This will minimize damage to the tissue while still ensuring the electrode contacts are in contact with the tissue.\n8. Patch clamping targeted neurons and obtaining whole-cell configuration\nSwitch eACSF source to bagged Control solution.\nIdentify fluorescently labeled cell for targeted patch clamp recording.\n\t\nRestrict the aperture iris diaphragm to the smallest diameter. Engage a low-power objective lens and bring the tissue into focus.\nCenter the light over an area of tissue adjacent to (but not overlapping) the multi-channel probe.\nEngage the high-power (40x or 60x) water immersion objective, using caution to avoid contact between the multi-channel probe and objective lens.",
    "Rotate the filter cube turret to engage the appropriate filter set to allow imaging of cells expressing Cre-dependent fluorescent marker.\nIdentify a fluorescently labeled cell as a target for patch clamp recording. Raise the objective lens to create ample space to lower a patch pipette.\nLoad a patch pipette (see Table 1) with internal solution (Table 2) and mount pipette into electrode holder. Using 1 mL syringe, apply positive pressure corresponding to ~0.1mL air.\nLower patch pipette into the solution. Bring the pipette tip into focus under visual guidance.\nObtain whole-cell recording from the targeted cell using the steps previously demonstrated33.\nIf planning to assess changes to intrinsic properties of the cell (e.g., input resistance, action potential firing rate in response to current steps), conduct these recordings. Otherwise, move to axon stimulation protocol in below.\n9. Layer-specific optogenetic activation of axon terminals\nManipulate field of view in the x-y plane to align light stimulation profile with desired location on slice.\nLoad light stimulus protocol and prepare the light delivery system to receive a digital TTL pulse.\nOptogenetically activate axon terminals while simultaneously recording extracellular field potentials and intracellular membrane fluctuations.\nSwitch eACSF source to Isoflurane solution and wash drug in for 15 min. If necessary, collect spontaneous recordings during the wash-in.\nRepeat step 9.2-9.3.\nSwitch eACSF source to Control solution and wash drug out for 20 min. If necessary, collect spontaneous recordings during wash-out.\nRepeat step 9.2-9.3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
