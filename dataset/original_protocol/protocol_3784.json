    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBiotin phenol proximity labeling of endogenous proteins\nTiming: 1 h\nBiotinylation of LD proteins in oleate-treated APEX2 cell lines by incubating cells with biotin phenol and H2O2.\nNote: Volumes listed are optimized for working with 150 mm plates. 15–20 plates were used in our studies.\nIncubate cells with 200 μM oleate complexed with 0.1% BSA for 24 h to increase LD abundance prior to harvesting.\nAdd biotin phenol to growth medium at a final concentration of 500 μM and swirl gently to mix.\nNote: To avoid using large amounts of biotin phenol, the volume of growth medium can be reduced from 20 mL to 10 mL prior to adding biotin phenol.\nIncubate cells with biotin phenol for 30 min at 37°C.\nAdd H2O2 from 100× stock (1 mM final concentration) to medium for 1 min to induce biotinylation.\nNote: To avoid labeling of undesired proteins, do not allow the biotinylation reaction to proceed longer than 1 min. It is recommended not to work with more than 2–3 plates at a time in order to avoid excess labeling time.\nAspirate medium and immediately wash three times with 5 mL quenching buffer to stop the reaction.\nWash once with 5 mL PBS to remove any residual quenching buffer.\nIsolation of LD-enriched buoyant fractions\nTiming: 4 h\nSeparation and isolation of the LD-enriched fractions containing the biotinylated LD proteins using sucrose gradient centrifugation and a tube slicer.\nNote: Samples should be kept on ice throughout all steps of the fractionation.\nHarvest cells in 3 mL PBS using a cell scraper and transfer to a chilled 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet cells and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cell pellet in 3 mL HLM buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nHomogenize cells by applying 80× strokes using a tight-fitting dounce.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet nuclei and any unbroken cells.\nTransfer the post-nuclear supernatant to a 13.2 mL ultracentrifuge tube, taking note of the approximate volume that was transferred for each sample (should be ~2–3 mL).\nDilute the post-nuclear supernatant 1:3 with 60% sucrose HLM buffer (20% sucrose final concentration). Pipette up-and-down several times to ensure complete mixing.\nCritical: Inadequate mixing at this stage will prevent sufficient separation of the buoyant fraction during ultracentrifugation.\nCarefully layer 5 mL of 5% sucrose HLM buffer on top, being careful not to disturb the layer underneath. Layer an additional ~4.5 mL HLM buffer on top, leaving approximately 0.5 cm of space at the top of the tube.\nNote: If the post-nuclear supernatant has a large volume, the amount of HLM buffer added to the top will be less than 4.5 mL. The slightly lower amount of HLM buffer does not alter the fractionation protocol or the purity of the buoyant fraction.\nCentrifuge at 28,000 × g in an SW-41TI rotor in an ultracentrifuge (e.g., Optima XPN-80) for 30 min at 4°C to pellet heavy organelles and float LDs.\nNote: Be careful when handling the ultracentrifuge tubes after centrifugation to minimize mixing between the separated layers.\nUse a tube slicer to isolate the top 1 mL LD-enriched buoyant fraction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Methods video S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/705-Mmc1.xlsx]). After pushing the blade through the tube underneath the LD-enriched buoyant fraction, pipette up-and-down several times to mix the fraction and then transfer to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/705-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Isolation of the LD-enriched buoyant fraction using a tube slicer\n(A) Illustration of fractions and their relative locations following ultracentrifugation of cellular homogenates.\n(B) The LD-enriched buoyant fraction consists of a prominent white layer at the very top of the column (indicated by the red arrow). The amount of LDs is greatly enhanced by oleate treatment.\n(C) Example of tube slicer apparatus setup. Following centrifugation and flotation of LDs, the tube is set in the tube slicer with the blade oriented just below the white LD fraction.\n(D) Top view of tube slicer showing the white LD layer prior to isolation and the complete removal of the LDs following isolation. See also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nNote: This step is performed at RT.\nNote: To maximize the amount of LDs collected, use an additional 200 μL of HLM buffer to wash the inner portion of the cut tube and tube slicer that contained the buoyant fraction. Pipette up-and-down paying special attention to the sides and corners and then combine together with the rest of the collected buoyant fraction.\nAfter removal of the LD-enriched fraction, collect the remaining fractions by pipetting 1 mL at a time from the top using a micropipette. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of HLM buffer.\nRemove 100 μL from each fraction and add 11.1 μL 10% SDS (1% SDS final) for analysis by western blot. Add 100 μL 10% SDS to the remainder of each fraction (1% SDS final) to be further analyzed by mass spectrometry.\nSonicate all fractions once for 30 sec at 15% amplitude using a tip sonicator. To solubilize LD fractions, incubate at 37°C for 1 h with additional rounds of sonication every 20–30 min.",
    "Note: To assess the purity of each fraction, separate 25 μL of the fraction by SDS-PAGE and western blot using antibodies against organelle markers such as the soluble protein GAPDH (enriched in the cytosolic fractions), the LD protein PLIN2 (enriched in the LD fraction), and the ER and LD protein UBXD8 (enriched in the pellet and LD fractions) (Bersuker et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Brasaemle and Wolins, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Olzmann et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Isolation of the buoyant LD-enriched fraction using the tube slicer, related to step 16\nPurification of biotinylated proteins from LD-enriched buoyant fractions\nTiming: 6 h\nAffinity purification and elution of biotinylated proteins from LD-enriched fractions using avidin-conjugated agarose beads and biotin-containing SDS elution buffer.\nDilute 1 mL of buoyant fractions 1:10 with HLM buffer in a 15 mL conical tube to reduce SDS concentrations to 0.1%. The lower SDS concentration is required for compatibility with the affinity purification procedure.\nNote: The entire buoyant fraction is typically used for the affinity purification and mass spectrometry, minus the samples that are removed where indicated for analysis of purity. Different cell types and metabolic conditions may require more or less amounts. We aim for ~1–2 μg of peptide for analysis by mass spectrometry.\nPrepare 200 μL of Agarose Monomeric Avidin bead slurry by washing twice with 1 mL of PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), followed by an additional wash with 1 mL of HLM buffer. For each wash, pellet beads by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min, and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend washed beads in 500 μL HLM buffer and add to the diluted buoyant fraction. Incubate at RT for 4 h on an end-over-end rotator to provide constant mixing.",
    "Pellet the beads by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min and save the flow through for analysis if desired.\nWash beads five times with 1 mL PBST followed by three times with 1 mL PBS.\nElute biotinylated proteins from the beads by adding 500 μL of elution buffer containing 2% SDS with 3 mM biotin. Pipette up-and-down several times using a micropipette with a cut tip to decrease shearing of the beads. Rotate end-over-end for 15 min at RT followed by heating at 95°C for 15 min. Pellet beads by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min and transfer the eluant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nIn-gel protein digestion and peptide extraction\nTiming: 2 days\nIn-gel digestion of affinity purified proteins with trypsin, extraction of peptides, and preparation of peptides for mass spectrometry.\nConcentrate the eluant in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator on medium heat until approximately 50 μL is remaining. Mix the eluant with 5× Laemmli buffer and heat at 65°C for 5 min immediately prior to loading onto a polyacrylamide gel.\nNote: Upon being concentrated, the eluant may become increasingly viscous and difficult to pipette. Moderately heating the samples increases the fluidity and allows for easier gel loading.\nLoad half of each sample onto neighboring lanes of the gel and separate proteins by SDS-PAGE until the dye front is approximately halfway down the gel.\nNote: If running multiple samples on the same gel, include an empty lane in between different samples to prevent any potential contact that could arise from bleed over into adjacent lanes.\nWash gel three times with ddH2O for 5 min using an orbital shaker for constant agitation.",
    "Add enough of the gel-fixing buffer containing 50% ethanol and 10% acetic acid to cover the gel and incubate at RT for 1 h with gentle shaking.\nRemove gel-fixing buffer and add a gel-washing buffer containing 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Incubate at RT for 30 min with gentle shaking.\nDiscard gel-washing buffer and wash gel three times with ddH2O.\nTo visualize the proteins in each lane, add enough Gel Code Blue G-250 stain to fully cover the gel and incubate at RT overnight with gentle shaking.\nWash gel with ddH2O for 4 h at RT with gentle shaking, replacing ddH2O every 45 min to remove the stain background for proper protein band visualization.\nExcise the proteins from the surrounding gel using a razor blade. Cut the pieces further into smaller fragments to increase surface area and transfer to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: To minimize keratin contamination, excise gel pieces in a laminar flow hood while wearing a long-sleeved laboratory coat. Spray down the working surface with 70% ethanol and clean all razor blades with an ethanol-sprayed Kimwipe prior to beginning.\nOverlay the gel pieces with 500 μL of a solution containing 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile. Incubate at RT for 40 min while briefly vortexing every 5–10 min. Remove as much of the solution as possible using a gel-loading pipette tip to prevent any accidental removal of gel pieces.\nDehydrate the gel pieces by adding 1 mL of 100% acetonitrile and incubate at RT with occasional vortexing until the gel pieces turn white. Remove the acetonitrile once complete.",
    "Note: This step may take several hours until the gel pieces are fully dehydrated. Replace the acetonitrile every hour until completion to ensure complete removal of any residual blue stain, as this can cause potential complications with mass spectrometers. Additional rounds of hydration and dehydration of the gel pieces with occasional vortexing may also be performed if necessary.\nAdd a sufficient amount of 10 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to cover the gel pieces and incubate for 1 h at 56°C.\nNote: This procedure for in-gel reduction and alkylation is optional and can also be done in solution prior to SDS-PAGE analysis (see step 26).\nCool samples to RT and replace the DTT solution with roughly the same volume of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Incubate for 45 min at RT in the dark with occasional vortexing. Remove the iodoacetamide solution once complete.\nNote: Iodoacetamide is light-sensitive and should be prepared fresh.\nWash gel pieces with ~100 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min while vortexing and dehydrate with ~100 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile.\nRemove the solution and dry the gel pieces in a vacuum centrifuge for 20 min.\nTo digest proteins, add 0.5 μg of mass spectrometry-grade trypsin in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 5% acetonitrile to the gel pieces and incubate on ice for 30 min to allow the gel pieces to become slowly saturated. After 30 min, transfer samples to a 37°C incubator for overnight digestion.",
    "Critical: Enough trypsin should be added only to where the gel pieces become fully saturated with no more ~10–20 μL of extra solution remaining. Excess trypsin solution can result in disproportionately high levels of trypsin being detected by mass spectrometers and subsequently decreased detection of desired peptides. Use no more than 1 μg of trypsin per sample for MS analysis.\nExtract the digested peptides by adding enough 5% formic acid in acetonitrile to fully cover the gel pieces and incubating at 37°C for 15 min with constant agitation.\nUse a gel-loading pipette tip to transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Concentrate the sample using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator on medium heat until 20 μL is remaining.\nRepeat extraction steps 42–43 two additional times to ensure that all peptides are removed.\nNote: To maximize peptide recovery, a bath sonicator can also be used in conjunction with constant agitation. Briefly after constant agitation for 15 min (step 42), sonicate the samples for 5 mins, pulse spin to collect the supernatant, and pool all peptides together.\nMass spectrometry and analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nIdentification of high confidence LD proteomes using mass spectrometry to analyze tryptic peptides, MaxQuant software to identity peptide identities and intensities for label-free quantification, and comparative analysis with controls to remove contaminant proteins.",
    "Analyze peptides using liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our analyses were performed at the University of California, Davis Proteomics Core Facility with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap Mass spectrometer connected to a Proxeon Easy-nLC II HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Proxeon nanospray source. A flow rate of 300 nL/min was used and peptides were separated using a 90-min linear gradient of 5%–35% over B for 75 min, 35%–80% over B for 7 min, 80% hold over B for 3 min, and 5% hold over B for 5 mins (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in water, solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] indicates key mass spectrometer parameters. All proteomic data files from two independent experimental replicates are available through the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database (Project PXD007695).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_705_7.csv\nPeptide identities, peptide intensities for label-free quantification, and MS/MS spectral counts can be determined by analyzing RAW output files using a variety of available proteomics software (e.g., SEQUEST and Mascot). For our analyses, we employ MaxQuant (current version v1.6.17.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]), an open source quantitative proteomics software package, using the reviewed human protein database obtained from Uniprot digested with trypsin/P and the indicated parameters (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]), including the addition of biotin phenol modification (C18H23N3O3S, +361.1460) to tyrosine.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_705_8.csv\nExport and open the protein groups file from MaxQuant. This file contains the relevant information regarding peptide identities, MS/MS spectral counts, and peptide intensities for label-free quantification. For label-free quantification, use the intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) value, indicated as “intensity” in the MaxQuant protein groups file. iBAQ reports the sum of all peptide intensities divided by the theoretically observable peptides for that protein (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).",
    "To identify a list of high confidence LD proteins, subtract the iBAQ intensity of the cyto-APEX2 from PLIN2-APEX2 and ATGL∗-APEX2 (averaged from two biological replicates) to provide a normalized value for proteins labeled by PLIN2-APEX2 (PLIN2-APEX2N) and ATGL∗-APEX2 (ATGL∗-APEX2N). This normalization controls for labeling of cytosolic proteins or non-specific binding of proteins to the beads.\nNote: A higher PLIN2-APEX2N or ATGL∗-APEX2N value corresponds to higher levels of the biotinylated protein on LDs. Whereas low values or negative values indicate a labeled cytosolic protein or a protein that non-specifically binds to the beads. High PLIN2-APEX2N or ATGL∗-APEX2N values increases the confidence that a protein is an LD protein.\nNote: We compared the method using iBAQ label-free quantification to our previous method (Bersuker et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) that used a normalized spectral abundance factor (SAF) based on spectral MS/MS counts (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). There is strong agreement between the two approaches (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B), and between the proteins that are identified using PLIN2-APEX2 and ATGL∗-APEX2 for proximity labeling (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/705-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
