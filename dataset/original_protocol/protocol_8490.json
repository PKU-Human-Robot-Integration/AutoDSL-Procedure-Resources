    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Mayo Clinic.\n1. Prerequisites of Rigor and Reproducibility\nTo ensure rigor of design, follow national standards of good laboratory practices are at all times and obtain internal approval by IACUC (or similar committee) prior to any animal involvement in experiments.\n\tNOTE: This protocol was designed to maintain a clinically faithful approach. Thus, the materials, instruments, and techniques involved are described in a fashion identical to the highest clinical standards in humans. For instance, strict sterile technique is followed and expired materials should never be used.\nTo support reproducibility of this methodology in an experimental setting, develop internal standard operating procedures and control for variability in swine breed, weight, gender, and age between separate cohorts.\n\tNOTE: The design of this protocol was based on the use of swine weighing 38 - 53 kg.\n2. Pre-operative Animal Care\nAdminister prophylactic intramuscular (IM) ceftiofur, given at 5 mg/kg, 1 day prior to the procedure.\nFast animals of solid food and restrict animals from cosmetic treatments, i.e. oil baths, 12 h prior to the procedure.\nInduce general anesthesia within 1 h of the procedure, using IM tiletamine and zolazepam, given as Telazol at 5 mg/kg, and IM xylazine, given at 2 mg/kg.\nOnce induced, administer subcutaneous (SC) buprenorphine sustained release (SR), given at 0.18 mg/kg.\nPlace an ear-vein catheter and perform rapid sequence intubation to place an endotracheal tube.\nAttach a pulse oximeter with heart rate monitoring function to the tongue to monitor oxygenation and heart rate.",
    "Place the animal in the prone position and clip the skin over the dorsum using an electric clipper. Clip hair over a large, bilateral area extending from the midline sagittal plane to the midline coronal plane and longitudinally from the sacral apex to the scapular spines. Use adhesive tape to remove hair and free-floating skin.\nScrub the clipped area up to 3 times with warm water and soap and dry the skin using a lint-free towel.\nMark bilateral anatomical landmarks using a surgical marking pen. Mark the last ribs, iliac crests, spinous processes, and transverse processes.\n\tNOTE: By marking the last ribs, iliac crests, and transverse processes, the lumbar spine is demarcated along its superior, inferior, and lateral boundaries, respectively. This protocol has been designed to guide access and injection of any lumbar DRG of interest. For reference, the superior iliac crests align with the L3 or L4 vertebral level.\nCover the animal with a warm blanket for transport to the operative suite.\n3. Positioning in the Operative Suite\nGently lift and position the animal prone into a modified large humane animal sling with padded abdominal aperture.\n\tNOTE: The abdominal aperture allows for reduction in abdominal pressure similar to the Wilson frame used during human surgery of the spine. In turn, this decreases intraoperative bleeding from the spinal blood vessels. The sling is advantageous because the legs are allowed to hang freely through padded openings which protect the animal from peripheral nerve impingement. However, because the sling frame is made of metal, it should be padded with insulation to avoid electrical short-circuiting and inadvertent animal burn. A blanket roll can be placed to position the head and neck in a comfortable position, depending on the size of the animal.",
    "Maintain general anesthesia using 1 - 3% inhaled (IH) isoflurane, titrated to effect. Moisten eyes with ophthalmic ointment and gently tape them shut.\nPlace lines for vital sign monitoring to document temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygenation. Monitor ventilation by capnography.\nPlace an adhesive, disposable electrosurgical dispersive electrode over the left or right scapula.\nAdminister warmed Lactated Ringer's as maintenance fluids through the ear-vein catheter. Give fluids at a rate of 5 - 10 mL/kg/h.\nPlace a forced-air warming device over the thoracic and cervical region and avoid covering the last ribs.\n4. Sterile Preparation of Operative Field for a Left-sided Injection\nNOTE: From this point forward, proceed in strict sterile fashion.\nPrepare the skin overlying the lumbar spine beginning with wide application of 0.7% iodine povacrylex and 74% isopropyl alcohol according to the manufacturer's instructions. To ensure that the guide needle can later be placed in a sterile fashion, lateralize application to the side of planned injection by extending antisepsis towards the midline coronal plane past the marked transverse processes.\nPlace disposable surgical towels in rectangular fashion to outline the planned incision site, which is over the midline along the marked lumbar spinous processes.\nApply an adhesive antimicrobial incise drape over the operative towels and exposed skin. Clamp drapes in place and extend the drapery edge off the operative field.\nSecure a vertical drape to poles at the head of the sling between the operative field and the monitoring technician.\nSecure lines for suction and electrosurgery within the operative field by clamping to the sterile drapes. Pass the free ends of tubes and wires out of the sterile field.\n5. Skin Incision and Subperiosteal Dissection\nPalpate the lumbar spinous processes along the midline and identify 3 consecutive vertebral levels.",
    "Use a #15 scalpel to open an 8 - 12 cm midline sagittal incision through the incise drape directly posterior to the spinous processes. Maintain hemostasis using gauze tamponade and monopolar electrosurgery.\n\tNOTE: Care should be taken not to deviate from the midline as the incision is advanced in the anterior direction because this limits bleeding from the paraspinal muscles. Periodic palpation for the spinous processes facilitates advancement. Self-retaining Weitlaner, Meyerding, or Gelpi retractors may be placed and repositioned as needed to facilitate the dissection. Suction is used to maintain visibility.\nDissect the subcutaneous tissue and fat using monopolar electrosurgery until the thoracolumbar fascia is reached. Palpate the spinous processes deep to the thoracolumbar fascia and cut the fascia along the midline to expose the supraspinous ligament spanning between spinous processes.\n\tNOTE: The thoracolumbar fascia is identified as an organized, aponeurotic sheath with a connective tissue grain that interweaves in an oblique, lateral to medial direction. At this point, the incision may be lengthened in either the superior or inferior direction to ensure that 3 spinous processes are fully visible with the centermost spinous process aligned within the center of the dissection field.\nUse a #15 blade to place a 2-mm deep parasagittal incision through the supraspinous ligament posterior to each spinous process. Place each incision along the left third of the posterior surface of the spinous process.\nGently release the supraspinous ligament at each level along each incision using a 5-mm Freer elevator.\nIdentify the subperiosteal plane and dissect within that plane along the lateral surface of each spinous process.\nPerform subperiosteal dissection at each spinous process in a parallel fashion to ensure that a gentle, even dissection is achieved.\nIncise the paraspinal muscle attachment along the interspinous spaces using monopolar electrosurgery in concert with subperiosteal dissection.",
    "Identify the lamina at each level and continue subperiosteal dissection laterally to reach the lateral border of the 2 zygapophyseal joints that connect the 3 exposed vertebrae and to reach the lateral edge of the lamina between the joints, called the pars interarticularis.\n\tNOTE: The pars interarticularis is the posterior border of the intervertebral foramen wherein the DRG resides. Occasionally, a small vein arises from a foramen located on the posterior surface of the lamina. These veins have a tendency to rupture during the subperiosteal dissection. Hemostasis is easily achieved by using a combination of bipolar electrosurgery and bone wax applied to the foramen.\n6. Single-level Laminotomy\nIdentify the target of laminotomy as the centermost lamina located between and medial to the 2 zygapophyseal joints.\nTrace the lamina to its inferior edge, to a point just medial to the contiguous inferior articular process of the caudal zygapophyseal joint.\nUse a 5-mm Freer elevator or curette to palpate the transition between the caudalmost edge of the lamina and central canal.\n\tNOTE: Care is taken to not force the palpating instrument anterior as this will contact the dural sac and spinal cord. Note that the spinal cord in swine extends past the lumbar spine 18. An intervertebral disc rongeur can be used to remove additional soft tissue overlying this area to facilitate palpation.\nUse a 2-mm up-biting, 45-degree Kerrison rongeur to extract bone in a piece-wise fashion. Remove bone along the base of the spinous process superiorly to a level just caudal to the caudal surface of the pedicle and out laterally to its full extent.\nUse angled bone rongeurs to assist with bone removal. Leave the inferior articular process that was connected to the lamina in place until the laminotomy is largely completed.",
    "Confirm that the inferior articular process is freely mobile and attached only by the zygapophyseal joint capsule. Incise the capsule using a #15 or #11 blade.\nRemove the inferior articular process in a piece-wise fashion but leave the adjoining superior articular process intact.\n\tNOTE: As the laminotomy is completed, hemostasis is performed with bipolar electrosurgery. Monopolar electrosurgery is not used because of the proximity of neural structures. Bone wax can be placed along sites of bleeding from exposed bone and absorbable gelatin sponges can be used to obtain hemostasis near soft tissue. Cottonoid is a helpful tool to wick serous fluid and blood away from the dissection.\n7. Dissection of DRG\nEvacuate the epidural fat in a piece-wise fashion from superficial to deep beginning medially and proceeding laterally. Remove fat by gentle dissection using bipolar forceps and suction with 6 - 10 French Frazier suction tips.\n\tNOTE: Loupe magnification or the use of a dissecting microscope is helpful in providing the level of detail needed to safely evacuate the epidural fat and achieve meticulous hemostasis of the epidural venous plexus using bipolar electrosurgery.\nIdentify the dural sac along the midline running in a superoinferior direction, parallel to the axis of the skin incision. Remove epidural fat along the dural sac until the dural sac can be seen to give rise to the dural nerve root sleeve.\nTrace the dural sleeve laterally and inferiorly by epidural fat evacuation until it is seen to enlarge around the DRG.",
    "NOTE: Identify the DRG for its oval shape and yellow to orange color. At the mid-lumbar spine, the DRG is typically 4 - 6 mm in size, longest in the medial to lateral direction, and located directly inferior or 2 - 3 mm medial to its respective pedicle. A blunt, right-angled nerve hook can be used to gently palpate for the pedicle.\nEvacuate epidural fat laterally, past the DRG, until the adjoining spinal nerve is seen.\n\tNOTE: If durotomy occurs, repair it by watertight closure using 6-0 nylon suture and smooth micro needle driver in a simple running stich.\n8. Injection of DRG\nUse a 22-gauge spinal needle to guide the trajectory of a 32-gauge convection enhanced delivery (CED) needle. Puncture the 22-gauge guide needle through the skin and paraspinal muscles.\n\tNOTE: The CED needle is designed to achieve fluid convection in tissue, also known as bulk flow, due to pressure gradients 19,20.\nAim the guide needle along a trajectory that approximates the longitudinal axis of the DRG and results in the needle tip emerging from the lateral paraspinal wall of the dissection field.\nFine tune the needle path until the needle lumen aligns with the center of the DRG.\n\tNOTE: The guide needle should never be allowed to contact the DRG.\nDraw up sterile injectate into a sterile syringe and connect the syringe to the sterile infusion tubing.\nSecure the tubing to the CED needle and hand the syringe out of the sterile field. Connect the syringe to a programmable syringe pump.\n\tNOTE: Tubing is prepared to a length of 5 feet to ensure that sterility and mobility are maintained. Also, it is of paramount importance that no air bubbles be introduced into solution.\nAdvance the injectate until expression is seen from the CED needle tip.",
    "Place the CED needle within the guide needle lumen and slowly advance the CED needle until it emerges from the guide needle tip. Ensure that the DRG is not punctured during needle alignment.\nFine tune the guide needle position along the long axis of its trajectory to determine the final location of the CED tip.\nSecure the guide needle and CED needle together using interlocking needle hubs once depth and alignment of the guide and CED needles is achieved.\nConfirm that all injection apparatus connections are fully secured, including the guide needle, CED needle, and connected tubing loaded with injectate.\nAdvance the guide needle along its long axis to approximate the CED needle tip and DRG.\nPuncture the DRG with the CED needle tip.\nSubmerse the CED needle tip into the three-dimensional center of the DRG.\n\tNOTE: Because the DRG is a three-dimensional structure of variable size and shape, DRG exposure must be complete in order to accurately place the CED needle tip at the true center of the DRG. The true DRG center is located at the intersection of its three anatomical axes, namely, the anterior to posterior, lateral to medial, and superior to inferior axes.\nDeliver 100 μL of injectate by CED using a graduated rate and volume of 3 steps.\nDeliver 4 μl at 2 μL/min for the first step. Deliver 8 μL at 4 μL/min for the second step. Deliver 88 μL at 8 μL/min for the third and final step.\n\tNOTE: Allow a 3-min pause between steps and after the final step to allow for pressure equilibration.\nWithdraw the injection apparatus after the final injection step and 3-min pause along its long axis in a smooth, gentle motion.",
    "NOTE: For injected solutions that are colorless, colored dye is included in the solution at a concentration of 0.1% weight/volume to assist in visual assessment of injectate distribution 12. Also, the vital dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is included in solution at a concentration of 0.25 μg/μL when the study design requires histologic assessment of injectate distribution 5.\n9. Closure\nApply 3 rounds of warm saline irrigation to the surgical site prior to closure to mobilize and flush the site of debris, i.e. bone fragments. Use suction to recover the saline and debris.\n\tNOTE: Meticulous hemostasis is ensured when irrigation remains clear. Hemostatic agents (gelatin sponge) and cottonoid are removed at this time. Ensure that all materials and instruments have been cleared from the incision site prior to closure.\nUse a 3-layered technique for closure.\nSuture the thoracolumbar fascia using 0 suture in a simple, interrupted, noninverted fashion. Place a stich every 5 - 8 mm to achieve watertight closure.\nSuture the subcutaneous tissue using 2-0 suture in a simple, interrupted, inverted fashion with a stitch placed every 5- to 8-mm to achieve adequate strength.\nClose the skin using 0 suture in a simple, running or interrupted fashion.\nUse a needle counter to ensure that no sharps are unaccounted for.\nIrrigate the skin with saline, dry the skin, and place adhesive bandage strips perpendicular to the incision.\nPlace gauze on top of the bandage strips and attach a final adhesive antimicrobial incise drape.\n10. Post-operative Animal Care\nExtubate, cover with warm blankets, and transport the animal to recovery.\nFollow standard institutional operating procedures for post-operative monitoring and recovery from survival surgery. At a minimum, observe the animal every 15 min until return of consciousness, hourly until full anesthetic recovery is achieved, and twice-daily thereafter.",
    "Provide post-operative pain management by administering IM or oral carprofen, given at 4 mg/kg, once daily for 5 days beginning on post-operative day 0. Administer SC buprenorphine SR, given at 0.18 mg/kg, once on post-operative day 2.\nAdminister post-operative antisepsis by giving IM ceftiofur, given at 5 mg/kg, once on post-operative day 4.\nRemove the bandage on post-operative day 5 - 7. Remove the sutures when wound healing is complete, typically on post-operative day 10 - 14.\nHumanely euthanize the animal according to standard institutional operating procedures once the study endpoint is reached.\nSubscription Required.
