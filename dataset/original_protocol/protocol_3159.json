The data represents an average from all tagmented DNA originating from all cells in a population. In liver this will mostly be hepatocytes.\nLiver nuclei preparation\nTiming: 45–60 min\nHere, the nuclei are isolated from mouse liver tissue. A clean nuclei population, deprived of cellular debris and free-floating genomic DNA, is essential for high quality ATAC-seq results. The work can be done in an open bench top.\nNote: Both bulk and snATAC-seq have nuclei isolation steps. While some steps are similar, there are considerable differences between the two protocols. This is due to the need for an extremely clean nuclei prep in snATAC-seq which necessitates a density gradient or similar nuclei cleanup methods. Therefore, it is advised to use the appropriate nuclei isolation steps depending on the type of protocol chosen (bulk or single-nuclei).\nCool a 7 mL Dounce homogenizer on ice.\nPrepare HB, NPB and NPB + 0.1% tween-20. Keep on ice.\nAdd 500 μL HB to the Dounce homogenizer, then add 50 mg of frozen liver tissue directly to the Dounce homogenizer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nHomogenize the tissue by 15 strokes with the loose pestle (‘A’), followed by 15 strokes with the tight pestle (‘B’). Avoid bubbles during homogenization. After homogenization, the liquid appears as an opaque homogenate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: Number/roughness of douncing greatly affects the number, quality and intact-ness of nuclei released. Different Dounce homogenizers provide variable results. Optimize number of strokes for your specific Dounce homogenizer and if possible, use the same Dounce homogenizer across different experiments.",
    "Filter homogenate through a 40 μm filter to a 1.5 mL tube on ice (no pre-wetting of the filter with buffers is needed). A strainer of 40 μm allows passage of larger multiploidy nuclei from subsets of hepatocytes.\nWash the Dounce homogenizer with another 500 μL of HB and pass the collected material through the same 40 μm filter (as in step 5) to the 1.5 mL tube containing the sample.\nSpin 500 g / 30 s / 4°C, save flow-through and discard filter.\nNote: This short centrifugation step helps the dense solution to go through the filter quickly rather than waiting for it to flow through the filter by gravity alone.\nSpin 500 g / 10 min / 4°C, aspirate supernatant. The pellet contains your nuclei.\nNote: The pellet should appear white or transparent.\nGently wash nuclei in 1 mL NPB + 0.1% tween-20 using a P1000, pipetting 10 times. Spin 500 g / 10 min / 4°C, discard supernatant gently using a P1000.\nGently resuspend nuclei in 100 μL NPB and keep on ice.\nTake a 5–10 μL from the sample and dilute 1:1 with trypan blue. Count nuclei using a hemocytometer. Nuclei should appear round and intact (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2929-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nuclei isolation evaluation\nFollowing the nuclei isolation steps in bulk ATAC-seq protocol, nuclei are stained with trypan blue and assessed for intact-ness. Some debris are apparent while most of material consists of round, intact nuclei.\nTransfer 5 × 104 nuclei to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Bring the total volume of each sample to at least 20 μL with NPB.",
    "Spin 500 g / 10 min / 4°C, aspirate supernatant. Keep on ice. It is preferable to continue immediately to the next steps. However, it is possible to freeze nuclei in −80°C for up to a month.\nTagmentation and purification\nTiming: 40–50 min\nHere, the tagmentase (Tn5 transposase loaded with sequencing adapters) enzyme cuts the DNA preferentially at accessible regions and inserts sequencing adapters at the flanks of the cut fragments.\nResuspend nuclei pellet in 22.5 μL of tagmentation reaction mix (detailed in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nTo each sample add:\n25 μL tagmentase buffer.\n2.5 μL tagmentase enzyme.\nMix gently by pipetting 20 times.\nNote: mix well to introduce tagmentase to all nuclei.\nIncubate the tagmentation reaction with shaking in the Thermomixer at 37°C / 30 min / 1000 rpm.\nImmediately following tagmentation, short spin samples and purify DNA using a MinElute PCR purification kit following manufacturer’s instructions. Elute DNA in 21 μL Nuclease-free water.\nNote: It is important to purify your samples immediately after incubation in order to stop the tagmentation reaction and avoid over-tagmentation.\nPause point: store samples at −20°C for up to a week.\nPCR amplification\nTiming: 45–60 min\nHere, the tagmented DNA fragments are amplified, with each sample barcoded with a unique index. At the end of the protocol, those indices will be used to identify which sequencing reads stem from which sample as samples are typically pooled during sequencing.\nTransfer 10 μL of the purified tagmented DNA to a 0.2 mL PCR tube on ice.\nNote: 11 μL of the purified tagmented DNA are left unused. The unused DNA can be frozen until the end of the experiment. It could be used if errors are made in the rest of the protocol (e.g., wrong indexing).",
    "Add 1 μL of individual indexing primers (Ad2 type primers, see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to each 10 μL sample in PCR tubes.\nCritical: To allow pooling during sequencing, each sample should get a unique index. Record which index was allocated to which sample.\nPrepare with excess and add 13 μL of PCR reaction master mix to each indexed sample:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_5.csv\n∗This primer is used in all samples. Only the indexing primers alter between samples (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nRun PCR as described in the table below:\nPCR cycling conditions\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_6.csv\nPurify the PCR-amplified tagmented DNA using a MinElute PCR purification kit following manufacturer’s instructions. Elute DNA in 21 μL nuclease-free water.\nPause point: store samples at −20°C for up to 1 week.\nSize selection\nTiming: 45 min\nHere, the purified DNA fragments of a desired size range are isolated, using designated DNA cleanup beads (most commonly used are magnetic AMPure XP beads and SPRIselect beads). At the end of this step, DNA fragments, including index and sequencing adapters, ranging from 150nt to 400nt are isolated and are ready for quality control and sequencing. This primarily corresponds to nucleosome depleted DNA and mono-nucleosomal DNA.\nNote: size selection is optional and enriches the tagmented DNA library for DNA fragments originating from non-nucleosomal DNA. If the aim is to analyze nucleosomal DNA, size selection should be modified or avoided.\nNote: Before starting size selection steps, prepare 80% ethanol (400 μL per sample).\nAdd 29 μL of nuclease-free water to the 21 μL purified DNA from the previous step, to reach a total volume of 50 μL.\nMix AMPure XP beads (or SPRIselect beads) thoroughly by vortexing for a few seconds and add 32.5 μL beads to each 50 μL sample. Mix thoroughly by gently pipetting 10 times.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C for 5 min.",
    "Place the reaction tubes on the magnetic rack for 5 min.\nMove the supernatant carefully to a new tube and discard the beads.\nMix AMPure XP beads (or SPRIselect beads) thoroughly by vortexing for a few seconds and add 88 μL beads to the supernatant. Mix thoroughly by gently pipetting 10 times.\nIncubate bead/sample mixture at 22°C–25°C for 5 min.\nPlace the reaction tube on the magnetic rack for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and discard.\nKeep the tubes in the magnetic rack and add 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the samples.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C (still on the magnetic rack) for 30 s and discard the supernatant using a pipettor.\nRepeat steps 33 and 34 once more (i.e., wash again with 80% ethanol).\nKeep the tubes in the magnetic rack, open the tube lid and air-dry the beads for 3 min.\nTake out the tubes from magnetic rack and add 20 μL of nuclease-free water to the beads to elute. Mix by gently pipetting 10× times.\nShort spin the tube and place in the magnetic rack. Let the tube rest for 5 min.\nTransfer supernatant to a new 0.2 mL PCR tube without disturbing/collecting any of the beads.\nCheck DNA concentration with 1 μL of sample on a Qubit fluorometer.\nNote: Optimally, sample concentration should be above 1 ng / μL.\nPause point: store samples at −20°C for up to 1 month.\nThe samples are now ready for post-library quality control (see ‘expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]’).\nSingle-nuclei ATAC-seq",
    "In snATAC-seq nuclei are isolated from liver tissue followed by tagmentation, generation of gel beads-in-emulsion (GEM), barcoding, cleanup, indexing, PCR amplification and size selection. snATAC-seq provides genome-wide chromatin accessibility data from each cell. Thus, giving insights into heterogeneity within cell populations as well as cell type-specific data. However, the snATAC-seq protocol is longer and the cost is much higher compared to bulk ATAC-seq. Using the current 10× Genomics platform, one snATAC-seq library reaction using 10,000 nuclei as input, costs about twenty times more than a bulk ATAC-seq library for 50,000 nuclei. For sequencing costs alone snATAC-seq is about eight times as expensive as bulk ATAC-seq, given that at least 30 million reads are required for bulk ATAC-seq, whereas 250 million reads are required for snATAC-seq (if 10,000 nuclei are sampled). Therefore, deciding between bulk ATAC-seq or snATAC-seq depends on several considerations including experimental design, the biological question and cost.\nNote: The snATAC-seq library preparation was performed using the Chromium 10× controller and the single cell ATAC v1.1 kit. The protocol describing GEM generation, Chromium operation, post GEM processing and library construction is identical to the standard protocol for the ATAC v1.1 kit and we refer the user to the online[href=https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/single-cell-atac/documentation/steps/library-prep/chromium-single-cell-atac-reagent-kits-user-guide-v-1-1-chemistry] detailed protocol. We have optimized nuclei purification, made slight modifications to the tagmentation step and optimized the DNA library size selection providing a larger fraction of sequenced reads from nucleosome depleted cis-regulatory regions.\nLiver nuclei preparation\nTiming: 30–40 min\nHere, the nuclei are isolated from mouse liver tissue and filtered for subsequent purification using gradient centrifugation.",
    "Note: Both bulk and snATAC-seq have nuclei isolation steps. While some steps are similar, there are considerable differences between the two protocols. This is due to the need for a very clean nuclei prep in snATAC-seq which necessitates a density gradient. Therefore, it is recommended to use the appropriate nuclei isolation steps depending on the type of protocol chosen (bulk or single-nuclei).\nNote: Prepare everything that can be prepared in advance so that nuclei are processed as quickly as possible (e.g., prepare the different dilutions of gradient buffers beforehand).\nCool a 7 mL Dounce homogenizer and pestles A and B on ice.\nPrepare HB. Keep on ice.\nAdd 2 mL HB to the Dounce homogenizer, then add 150 mg of liver tissue directly to the Dounce homogenizer and wait a few seconds until tissue is thawed.\nNote: In snATAC-seq much more starting material is needed compared with bulk ATAC-seq (150 mg vs 50 mg, respectively). This is due to the extra density gradient purification of the nuclei which requires higher amount of starting material.\nHomogenize the tissue by 15 strokes with the loose pestle A, followed by 15 strokes with the tight pestle B.\nCritical: Number/roughness of douncing greatly affects the number, quality and intact-ness of nuclei released. Different Dounce homogenizers provide variable results. Optimize number of strokes for your specific Dounce homogenizer and if possible, use the same Dounce homogenizer across different experiments. Insufficient Dounce homogenization will result in low nuclei yield and compromised nuclei quality. This will be evident after purification using density gradient. If nuclei quality is compromised this will result in small number of nuclei passing quality control after sequencing.",
    "Filter suspension through a 40 μm strainer to a 50 mL tube. A strainer of 40 μm allows passage of larger multiploidy nuclei from subsets of hepatocytes.\nTransfer homogenate to a 15 mL tube and spin 400 g / 5 min / 4°C.\nNuclei purification by a density gradient\nTiming: 45–60 min\nHere, a density gradient is used to purify nuclei, getting rid of cellular debris and free-floating genomic DNA from the lysis which can confound the downstream snATAC-seq data. This results in higher purity compared to only filtering. At the end of this step, high quality nuclei are isolated and ready for tagmentation.\nGently resuspend nuclei pellet in 2 mL cold HB by pipetting 10 times.\nOptional: When setting up the protocol we would recommend counting the nuclei here as a quality control (see step 55).\nNote: Nuclei are now ready for density gradient purification. Keep nuclei on ice while density gradient is prepared. We usually see between 15–30 million nuclei at this step, depending on the amount of liver used.\nPrepare 1× Nuclei buffer from the snATAC kit (will be used in step 57 below), and store on ice (the amount below is per one sample):\n50 μL 20× Nuclei buffer.\n950 μL nuclease-free water.\nPrepare 3 different concentrations of OptiPrep suspension (50%, 40% and 30%) by mixing the OptiPrep stock with nuclease-free water according to the scheme below (calculated for 2 samples + surplus). Keep all tubes on ice.\nNote: prepare appropriate number of tubes to balance the centrifuge.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_7.csv\nFor each nuclei sample: mix 2 mL nuclei suspension with 2 mL of prepared 50% OptiPrep suspension (keep on ice). This is your 25% OptiPrep + nuclei suspension for later usage in the gradient top layer (step 51.c).",
    "For each nuclei sample: build a 3-layer OptiPrep density gradient in a 12 mL open-top centrifuge tube (keep on ice) (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAdd 3.5 mL 40% OptiPrep suspension to the bottom of the tube.\nCarefully add 3.5 mL 30% OptiPrep suspension on top of the bottom layer.\nCarefully add 4 mL 25% OptiPrep + nuclei suspension on top of the middle layer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2929-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Density gradient-based nuclei purification\n(A–C) In snATAC-seq, nuclei are purified by a 3-layer density gradient (A). After centrifugation, the nuclei are gathered between the bottom and middle layers (B and C).\nCritical: When preparing the gradient, release suspensions on the side of the tube. This allows the liquid to land gently on the liquid surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCentrifuge the gradient tubes in an ultracentrifuge using swinging-buckets at 10,000 g / 24 min / 4°C (no break). After centrifugation, the purified nuclei are located between the bottom and middle layer and appears as a cloudy layer (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nExtract the purified nuclei band:\nCarefully, remove the liquid from the top of the gradient tube until the liquid surface is 1–2 cm from the nuclei band.\nUse a P1000 pipette to carefully extract the cloudy nuclei band into a new 15 mL tube (∼1–1.5 mL is usually extracted). (See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nWash the nuclei:\nAdd 4 mL of HB to the purified nuclei and mix by pipetting 10 times (total volume in tube ∼5–6 mL).\nSpin down nuclei at 500 g / 5 min / 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend the nuclei pellet in 1 mL HB. Transfer to a 1.5 mL tube. This is your purified nuclei suspension ready for next steps. We have not done any experiments with cryopreserved nuclei and recommend to proceed directly to tagmentation.",
    "Note: The optimal resuspension volume depends on nuclei quantity. If you observe very low quantity either by counting the nuclei in step 47 or observe a less turbid band than shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C, lowering the resuspension volume in step 54c is recommended. If you count 7 million nuclei in step 47, resuspension volume can be halved.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

At the end of this step, DNA within nuclei is tagmented.\nNote: Work in biological cabinet hood and use gloves, make sure to use a lab coat and avoid clothes that can shed fibres. Use specialized pipettes and pipette tips (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) at all steps leading up to running the Chromium controller. Other pipette tips might shed fibres and clog the chip.\nTake 10 μL of nuclei sample and dilute 1:1 with trypan blue. Count nuclei using a hemocytometer. Nuclei should appear round and intact (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2929-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of purified nuclei\n(A and B) An intact nucleus (A) and a broken nucleus that is leaking chromatin (B) are shown.

Discard supernatant.",
    "Resuspend each pellet in 1× Nuclei buffer (from snATAC-seq kit, prepared in step 48) to reach the nuclei concentration outlined below in step 57a and pass through SP Bel-Art 40 μm pipette-tip filter. Collect in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nThe volume is calculated as follows:   V  N  B  1 x     =   A m o u n t  o f  n u c l e i   7700   n u c l e i   μ L     \nExample calculation of resuspension volume with 5 million nuclei:\nV\nN\nB\n1\nx\n=\n5,000,000\nn\nu\nc\nl\ne\ni\n7700\nn\nu\nc\nl\ne\ni\nμ\nL\n=\n649.35\nμ\nL\nThe 7700 nuclei / μL is the upper limit of final concentration recommended by 10× Genomics for recovery of 10,000 nuclei at the end. The upper limit is used because some nuclei are lost during resuspension and filtering.\nNote: The last filtration step avoids any clogs in the Chromium Next GEM Chip H.\nCount nuclei again (see step 55).\nAliquot 12,000 nuclei for tagmentation for target recovery of 10,000 nuclei.\nAdd 1× Nuclei Buffer up to 5 μL.\nNote: Use 12,000 nuclei for tagmentation reactions in a volume of 5 μL. Exceeding 12,000 nuclei will dramatically increase the number of nuclei doublets during the droplet formation in the Chromium controller.\nTransfer the 5 μL nuclei sample (containing 12,000 nuclei) to a PCR strip, keep on ice.\nPrepare tagmentation mix, mix by pipetting 10 times.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_8.csv\nAdd 10 μL tagmentation mix to each nuclei sample and mix by pipetting gently 10 times. Do not spin down.\nIncubate in thermal cycler using the following protocol:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_9.csv\nGEM generation and barcoding\nTiming: 75–90 min",
    "In this step the 10× barcoded gel beads are emulsified with tagmented single nuclei. Subsequently a PCR is performed to linearly amplify and barcode DNA fragments. The result is a solution consisting of gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) with linearly amplified and barcoded DNA fragments, where each emulsion has a unique barcode. To complete this step in the protocol we refer to the 10× protocol supplied with the ATAC v1.1 kit used together with the 10× Chromium controller. It can also be found online[href=https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/single-cell-atac/documentation/steps/library-prep/chromium-single-cell-atac-reagent-kits-user-guide-v-1-1-chemistry].\nPause point: store samples at −20°C up to 1 week.\nPost GEM-RT cleanup\nTiming: 50–60 min\nIn this step the emulsions are broken, lipids are removed and the linearly amplified DNA from different emulsions are pooled. This is followed by cleanup of the DNA. The result of this step is a pool of DNA fragments where each pool of fragments derived from a GEM will have a specific barcode. Please use the detailed protocol supplied by the ATAC v1.1 kit.\nThis step results in a 40 μL bead-purified Post Ligation DNA library.\nPause point: keep samples at 4°C for up to 72 h or at −20°C for up to 2 weeks.\nLibrary construction – Sample index PCR\nTiming: 45–60 min\nIn this step the pooled barcoded DNA fragments are indexed with a sample index primer along with linear amplification. The result of this step is DNA fragments with a barcode (corresponding to a specific GEM) and a sample index sequence (common for all DNA fragments from one sample). Please use the detailed protocol supplied by the ATAC v1.1 kit.\nNote: We recommend to use half of the library from step 65 for indexing and amplification. This allows one to re-do this step if the library is over- or under-amplified.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2929_11.csv",
