    "All interventions were performed in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Michigan's Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) prior to implementation. Ten-week-old adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were utilized.\n1. Prior to the operative day\nEnsure an appropriate stock of sterilized surgical instruments, analgesic medications, anesthetic medication, and oxygen prior to the operating day. Please see Table of Materials for a complete list.\n2. Preoperative setup\nEnsure an adequate working space, including room for at least two individuals (the surgeon and an assistant).\n\tNOTE: There is need for a dedicated operating table, room for the anesthesia machine setup, and adequate storage space for sterilized and backup supplies.\nCalibrate an operating microscope for use during the procedures. Make sure the surgeon has the ability to adjust the handles of the microscope and the zoom/focus buttons by placing a sterilized cover over the handles/buttons\n\tNOTE: We utilized sterilized aluminum foil over the handles/buttons.\n3. Anesthesia and preparation\nPlace the animal in the anesthesia chamber and induce general anesthesia via 1.8% isoflurane and 0.9 L/min oxygen.\n\t\nConfirm an adequate plane of anesthesia via an assessment of spontaneous breathing and an evaluation of consciousness by assessing the animal's grimace response to a toe pinch.\nApply eye lubricant bilaterally to guard against corneal irritation or dryness.\nShave the operative site(s) with a razor or automatic clipper.\n\t\nEstablish a method for rat identification at this time, either via an ear tag or tail label/marking.\nAdminister a subcutaneous injection of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine along the animal's back for prophylaxis against postoperative pain.\n4. Surgical approach and injury patterns",
    "Transfer the animal to the operating table and continue the gas flow via a nosecone. Ensure that a warming pad is positioned underneath the animal and the sterile field to maintain its body temperature.\nPlace sterilized gauze (rolled up and fastened with tape) to use as a neck roll for the rat; this will provide an enhanced exposure of the surgical field. Note that the appropriate positioning of the animal is paramount for efficient nerve identification and dissection.\nPrepare the animal's facial skin for the procedure. Use chlorhexidine or an iodine-based solution to scrub the surgical site 3x, alternating with 70% ethanol, to ensure disinfection.\nPlan and mark the surgical incision if desired. Manipulate the ipsilateral ear in an anterior-posterior direction to determine the natural folding of the postauricular skin.\nFashion a 4-5 mm incision in the postauricular crease using sharp iris scissors or a number 15 blade. This can be expanded later in the procedure as necessary.\nBluntly dissect through the immediate subcutaneous fascia and place a micro-Weitlaner retractor to enhance exposure. Note that there may be small caliber blood vessels in this area; these are best avoided by retracting superiorly or inferiorly via the Weitlaner retractor.\nIdentify the anterior digastric muscle as it travels in an inferior-to-superior direction toward its insertion along the skull base.\n\t\nSpread gently through the muscle belly along its insertion point to reveal the tendon of the anterior digastric belly. Note that the tendon appears as a filmy white process emanating from the muscle with a solid insertion onto the skull base.\nAfter identification of the anterior digastric muscle and its tendon, adjust the Weitlaner retractor to further retract the muscle belly. Note that the subsequently exposed region is the three-dimensional space where the main trunk of the facial nerve lies.",
    "NOTE: This region is bounded superiorly and medially by the skull base, laterally by the anterior digastric muscle, posteromedially by the ear canal, and inferiorly by the structures of the neck, including the superficial temporal artery.\nAfter adequate exposure, identify the main trunk of the facial nerve as it travels inferiorly from underneath the tendon of the digastric muscle, where it exits the stylomastoid foramen from the skull base. Note that the nerve appears as a pearly white cord, encased in the animal's parotid-masseteric fascia. Practice caution when further exposing the nerve, for the following reasons.\n\t\nAvoid aggressive dissection, or perpendicular spreads, to guard against stretch-mediated neuropraxia injury.\nAvoid aggressive posteriorly and medially directed dissection to guard against violating the thin tissues overlying the ear canal as this could introduce middle ear flora into the surgical field.\nAvoid damaging the superficial temporal artery through broad medially and inferiorly directed dissection. Note that an injury will be identified by brisk, pulsatile bleeding.\n\t\t\nIf the artery is injured, apply prompt pressure with a cotton-tipped applicator or sterile gauze via forceps. Hemostatic agents or liquid fibrin sealant can be placed in near proximity. Keep in mind that the animal may require a subcutaneous injection of 0.9% sterile saline for fluid stabilization.\nTrace the main trunk distally by dissecting along the nerve in an inferior direction, distally from the exit of the stylomastoid foramen.\n\t\nExtend the original incision to allow for a full exposure of the nerve and its branches. Take care to avoid a disruption of the parotid gland as this could result in postoperative sialocele.\nInduce the desired injury patterns as follows.",
    "For a crush injury, use smooth-surfaced jeweler's forceps to firmly grasp the nerve and compress it9. Apply constant and reproducible pressure to the nerve for a period of 30 s to ensure an appropriate crush injury.\nFor a simple transection, grasp the fascia overlying the nerve, or the immediate epineurium, with fine-toothed forceps, and use sharp microscissors to cleanly transect the nerve at the desired point with a single cut. Take care to avoid excess traction on the nerve with the forceps.\nFor a nerve gap model, create the desired nerve gap using a similar method to the simple transection injury. Use the sterilized shaft of a cotton-tipped applicator-cut to the desired nerve gap length-intraoperatively to ensure similarity of injury pattern between animals.\n5. Wound closure\nIrrigate the wound with sterile saline and dry it with sterile gauze.\nApproximate the skin edges in a simple, subcuticular fashion with absorbable sutures, or use skin glue or wound clips, which are also acceptable for wound closure. Place a buried stitch by taking a deep-to-superficial bite of one skin edge and then a subsequent superficial-to-deep bite of the opposite skin edge.\n6. Postoperative recovery\nAdminister a subcutaneous injection of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic (such asÂ 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine and 0.5 mg /kg Carprofen) for postoperative pain control. Place the injection along the animal's back.\nCease the administration of the anesthetic agent and allow the animal to inhale oxygen for an additional 1 min.\nPlace the animal in a warmed (via a heat lamp), aseptic cage devoid of bedding material to avoid accidental ingestion. Note that the animal will typically demonstrate signs of recovery within 1-2 min and can appear disoriented, with a delayed recovery of hind-leg function.",
    "Return the animals to their cages in the appropriate housing unit and administer postoperative analgesics on postoperative day #1 to ensure continued prophylaxis against pain.\nMonitor the animals 2x per day to evaluate for signs of malnourishment, corneal irritation, or surgical site infection, and maintain appropriate surgical logs.\n\t\nAdminister 0.9% sterile saline in a subcutaneous fashion if there is significant weight loss.\nApply lubricating eye ointment daily until the animal's blink reflex is re-established.\nSubscription Required.
