Batch Gateway cloning of ORF library into pDEST vectors \n- Prepare pool of pENTR-ORF clones at 10 nM\n- Prepare pDEST for Bait and Prey at 10 nM\n- Set up LR reactions\nStep 2. Prepare competent yeast \n- Streak Y2HGold on a YPDA plate\nDAY 2\nStep 1. Batch Gateway cloning of ORF library into pDEST vectors \n- Continue LR reaction\n- Transform LR reaction into NEB stable cells\n- Plate on LB-Agar with corresponding antibiotic\nDAY 3\nStep 1. Batch Gateway cloning of ORF library into pDEST vectors \n- Colony counting\n- Harvest colonies from LB-Agar plates\n- Qiaprep DNA prep of Bait and Prey pDEST-ORF pool \n \nStep 2. Competent yeast\n- Grow 1 colony of Y2HGold during 8 hours\n- Transfer to 50 ml YPDA media\n- Grow overnight\n \nStep 3. Linearization\n- Digest Bait and Prey pDEST-ORF pool with I-SceI/I-CeuI\n- Heat inactivation\nDAY 4\nStep 2. Competent yeast \n- Transfer yeast to 100 ml YPDA\n- Grow yeast to OD 0.5\n- Wash cells \n- Resuspend in TE/LiAc",
    "Step 4. Batch yeast transformation \n- Prepare Seaprep liquid-gel selection media\n- Multiple transformations of yeast with linear Bait and Prey pDEST-ORF pool\n- Pool together all transformations \n- Plate dilutions for colony counting\n \nStep 5. Growth in selection media\n- Add transformations to liquid-gel selection media\n- 1 hour on ice\n- Grow at 30ºC for 60 hours\nDAY 7 \nStep 6. Harvest yeast\n- Colony counting\n- Centrifuge liquid-gel selection media with yeast colonies\n- Wash and resuspend in PBS\n- OD660 to calculate concentration of cells\nStep 7. Yeast library DNA isolation\n- For each selection media, Zymoprep™ Yeast Plasmid Miniprep of recombined Bait and Prey fragments \nStep 8. Covaris shearing\n- Shear DNA to 1,500-bp fragments\nStep 9. Circularisation\n- End repair\n- Mini Elute DNA purification\n- Ligation\n- Heat inactivation\nStep 10. R1/R2 PCR \n- 12 PCR cycles with Q5 polymerase \n- Purification with AMPure beads \nStep 11. P5/P7 PCR\n- 12 PCR cycles with Q5 polymerase and NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina\n- Purification with AMPure beads \nDAY 8 onwards\nStep 12. Paired-end sequencing\n- Library quality control\n- MiSeq run\nStep 13. Analysis"
