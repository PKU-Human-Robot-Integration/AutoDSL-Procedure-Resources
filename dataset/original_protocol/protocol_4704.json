    "Mitotic metaphase chromosome study (Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. The MS-preparation of mitotic and meiotic metaphase chromosomes Selected young leaves (Figure 1A) from healthy plants grown in experimental garden were collected at 9-10 AM for pre-treatment.Only apical region of the young leaves was cut (Figure 1B) and kept in a specimen tube containing cold saturated solution of para-dichlorobenzene for 5 min at 0 °C (in freezer compartment of normal household refrigerator) followed by 6 h pre-treatment at 10-12 °C (in the freeze compartment of normal household refrigerator). Pre-treated leaf tips were then thoroughly washed with distilled water and fixed in acetic acid: ethanol mixture (1:3) for overnight at room temperature.Leaf tips were transferred in 45% acetic acid for 15 min and then washed with distilled water, followed by hydrolysis with 5 N HCl for 20 min in refrigerator.Leaf tips were again thoroughly washed with distilled water and then immersed in 45% acetic acid for 5 min followed by staining with 2% aceto-orcein for overnight. Leaf tips were then squashed and mounted in 45% acetic acid (by putting a coverslip on leaf tip and applying gradual pressure with thumb in order to spread out the cells) and observed under a microscope.Photomicrographs were taken with Zeiss primo-star Microscope (any compound microscope can be used having 40x or 100x objective with oil immersion) and suitably enlarged (Figure1 C-E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171013/20171013032843_4313.jpgFigure 1.

Scale bar=5 µmMeiotic metaphase chromosome studyFlower buds of seventh and eighth developmental stages (Figure 2A-B) were collected directly from the field at 11-11:30 AM during April-May.",
    "Sepals and petals were removed from the selected flower buds and the anthers were kept in 45% acetic acid for 5 min.A part of the fused anthers was smeared in a drop of 2% aceto-carmine stain. After 10 min, the prepared slide was slightly warmed by passing over a flame.After 30 min, the stained cells were washed by adding drops of 45% acetic acid on one side of the cover glass and by drawing the access fluid from the opposite side of the cover glass with the help of a strip of blotting paper; this step is crucial for clearing the cytoplasmic background of the stained pollen mother cells. Finally, the prepared slide is wrapped in a fold of blotting paper to remove access of 45% acetic acid leaving only a thin film of fluid in between slide and cover-slip.Photomicrographs were taken with Leica Microscope and suitably enlarged (Figure 2C-D). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171123/20171123181223_9727.jpgFigure 2.
