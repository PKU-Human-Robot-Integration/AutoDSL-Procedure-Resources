    "Note: Prior to running any of the full high-throughput screens, it is recommended to check all liquid handling steps first to ensure proper function of all liquid handlers.

General workflow for primary and dose-response screens",
    "Prior to beginning the screening process, DUB and ubiquitin-rhodamine (Ub-Rho) solutions are prepared in assay buffer and compound source plates are prepared from DMSO stocks. Step 1: Compounds are added from source plates to 1536 well assay plates in single concentrations (for primary screen) or in either 4 or 8-point dose-response (for dose-response screens). Columns 45–46 contain DMSO only as a neutral control. Step 2: A 2x solution of DUB in assay buffer is then added to all wells on the plate except columns 47–48 (which receive only assay buffer). Step 3: A 2x solution of Ub-Rho is then added to all wells on the plate. Step 4: Plates are then incubated to allow the DUB enzymatic reaction to occur. Step 5: Fluorescence measurements for each plate are then recorded using a fluorescence plate reader followed by data analysis.\nDose response enzyme/substrate solution preparation\nTiming: 15 min\nPrepare assay buffer, DUB, and substrate solutions for dose-response confirmation of primary screen hits.\nPrepare 170 mL of a 2x DUB solution in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.002% Tween-20, and 5 mM DTT).\nPrepare 170 mL of a 2x Ub-Rho solution in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.002% Tween-20, and 5 mM DTT)\nPrepare 160 mL of assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.002% Tween-20, and 5 mM DTT) + 0.8% DMSO.\nPrepare 140 mL of STOP buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.002% Tween-20, and 5 mM DTT + 0.2% TFA).",
    "Note: As with the primary screen all enzyme and substrate concentrations were optimized for each enzyme prior to running all primary and confirmation screens. The same concentrations of DUB and substrate used in the primary screen were used for each enzyme in the dose-response confirmation.\nDose response screen plate preparation\nTiming: 15 min\nPrepare assay plates by adding compound to each well via acoustic transfer.\nFor preparation of dose-response compound source plates, 10 mM DMSO stocks were added to an intermediary 384 well plate.\n11.7 μL of 10mM compound in 100% DMSO was transferred from Matrix storage tubes to top concentration wells (row A and row I for 8-point dose response or row A, row E, row I, and row M for 4-point dose response) using a Tecan Freedom EVO-2 200 Base automated pipetting robot.\n8 μL of 90% DMSO is dispensed to remaining wells in the 384 well polypropylene plate (row B-H and row J-P for 8-point dose response or row B-D, row F-G, row J-L, and row N-P for 4-point dose response) with a Thermo Fischer MultiDrop Combi.\nA serial half-log dilution series is prepared by transferring compounds from rows with the highest concentration wells to the row directly below using the Tecan Freedom EVO-2 200 Base pipetting robot.\nFor 8-point dose response plates 3.7 μL is transferred from wells in row A to wells in row B, and from wells in row I to wells in row J followed by mixing with 7 cycles of aspiration and dispense.",
    "For 4-point dose response plates 3.7 μL is transferred from wells in row A to wells in row B, from wells in row E to wells in row F, from wells in row I to wells in row J, and from wells in row M to wells in row N followed by mixing with 7 cycles of aspiration and dispense.\nThis process is repeated vertically down the plate to prepare the half-log dose response series for each compound.\nFor the 8-point dose response plates 3.7 μL of solution from row H and P are removed after the final dilution and disposed to waste.\nFor the 4-point dose response plates 3.7 μL of solution from row D, row H, row L, and P are removed after the final dilution and disposed to waste.\nNote: DMSO percentage in the dose response compound source plates range from 100% at the highest concentration to 90.0% at the lowest concentration.\n5 μL of compound are transferred from each well of the intermediary plate to the 1536 well source plate for screening.\nFour 384 well intermediary plates are stacked in an interleaved pattern to make each 1536 well source plate.\nCompounds were acoustically transferred from source plates to new 1536 well assay plates by Labcyte Echo acoustic transfer.\nNote: For all DUBs, hits from the primary screen were prepared in compound source plates in either 8-point or 4-point half-log dose response in DMSO depending on DUB. Initial concentrations of the dose-response varied from 20 μM to 50 μM depending on DUB. Columns 45–46 contained DMSO only as a neutral control. Columns 47–48 were left blank to be used as an active control (no DUB).\nDose response DUB enzymatic reaction\nTiming: 1–4 h",
