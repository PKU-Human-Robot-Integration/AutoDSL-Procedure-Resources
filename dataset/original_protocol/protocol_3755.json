    "PCR amplify the fragment using primers designed from Before you begin step 7c. Refer to Before you begin step 5d for PCR reaction mix, and Before you begin step 5e for PCR condition. Gel purify the PCR product (refer to Before you begin step 5f).\nDigest pTVGFP and the PCR product with the two restriction enzymes selected in Before you begin step 7b, setting up the following reaction mix for digesting the pTVGFP and the PCR product respectively.

This generates the pTVFRT-GFP donor plasmid (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nTransform with competent bacteria and plate on Ampicillin plates.\nPick a few individual colonies and culture overnight for MiniPrep (Qiagen).\nVerify insertion by sequencing with the following primers:\npTVGFP 5′arm forward primer for verification: CAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGA\npTVGFP Pax reverse primer for verification: GAATTAGCTCTAATTGAATTAGTCTCTAATTGAATT\nNote: Steps 10 and 11 can be swapped around, depending on the availability of unique restriction sites\nNote: Instead of Gibson assembly, the components can be sequentially cloned into the repair vector using restriction sites from MCS1 via ligation (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPurify the pTVFRT-GFP plasmid with a Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen).\nPause Point: the pTVFRT-GFP plasmid can be stored at −20°C for an extended period until injection.\nInjection and screening\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nThe gRNA vector pCFD4 can be co-injected with the pTVFRT-GFP repair plasmid into embryos of any transgenic line that express Cas9 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). If in-house injection facilities are not available, the injection mix can be sent to companies for injection into commonly available Cas9 lines.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/679-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(C) Examples of reintegration vectors, for subsequent introduction of DNA fragments into the locus via the attP site using PhiC31-mediated integration (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nExpand the Cas9-expressing strain to be used for injection\nThe injection mix contains the pCFD4 and the pTVFRT-GFP plasmids in ddH2O.\nNote: Plasmid concentrations can vary. Recommended concentrations are 100 ng/μL for pCFD4 and 500 ng/μL for pTVFRT-GFP, for injecting into 300–400 embryos. Injection volume is typically less than 5% of the egg volume.\nNote: Recommended amounts of each plasmid are 300 μg for pCFD4 and 500 μg for pTVFRT-GFP, for injecting into 300–400 embryos.\nTiming: 1–2 months\nInjected embryos are grown to adulthood and crossed to w1118 flies. Screen for GFP signal in the next generation larval CNS or the adult eyes/ocelli (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nSelect individual transformants and establish balanced GFP-positive transformant lines (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nExtract gDNA from transformant lines and PCR verify the insertion is in the correct location. Design two sets of primers for the PCR verification, such that one of each set binds just outside the regions that correspond to the 5′ and 3′ arms, and the other binds to the GFP coding sequence (primers 1–4 in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). For PCR reaction mixture and PCR conditions, refer to Before you begin steps 5d-e.\nOptional: The pax-GFP flanked by loxP sites can be excised through Cre expression (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). This can improve expression of the integrated fragment. Cre recombinase lines such as BL#766 and BL#851 from the Bloomington stock centre can be used.",
    "Optional: Reintegration vectors can be introduced via the attP site via another round of injection. Examples include, introducing a GAL4 coding sequence into the locus, or reintroducing the CDS of the gene of interest but with a HA-tagged inserted within the CDS (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Poernbacher et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) Alternatively, instead of creating a conditional knockout, the re-integration vector can introduce another FRT cassette containing a mutant or tagged form of the gene of interest, thus generating a conditional switch allele. Details of the crossing scheme for the PhiC31-mediated reintegration can be found at (Hoppe and Ashe, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])."
