  "title": "A Modified Precipitation Method to Isolate Urinary Exosomes",
  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The steps involved in the isolation of the urinary exosomes using the modified precipitation method are illustrated in the Figure 1. The initial steps involve removal of large dead cells and cell debris by centrifugation. The final pellet obtained from the supernatant collected from each subsequent step corresponds to the exosome, which is dissolved in isolation solution for further extraction of protein, RNA, and DNA.\n1. Collection of Urine\nPrior to urine collection, prepare protease inhibitor cocktail according to the manufacturer’s instructions and add 3.125 ml of this cocktail to an empty sterile receptacle. The tube containing the protease inhibitor cocktail can then be distributed to volunteers for urine collection.\n\tNOTE: The reason for adding protease inhibitor is to minimize protein degradation in the urine sample. Although we specifically used a protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma, other commercially available protease inhibitors can be substituted.\nCollect approximately 10 ml of first-void urine. Process the urine immediately after collection without storage or refrigeration. Isolate the urinary exosomes in duplicate using the modified precipitation method; one of the duplicates is for DNA, total RNA and protein extraction, while the other is for the quantification of urinary exosome particles.\n\tNOTE: A 24 hr urine sample can be collected for exosome isolation by storing at 4 °C.\n2. Removal of Cell Debris and Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP)\nTransfer urine samples to 15 ml centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge 10 ml of urine at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 37 °C to eliminate cells and cell debris (Figure 1).\nUsing a pipette, transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube for further processing. Resuspend the pellet in 500 µl of isolation solution (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.6) followed by 10 min incubation with DL-dithiothreitol (DTT: final concentration 200 mg/ml) at 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: DTT is added to degrade THP, which traps exosomes, leading to decreased yields. Take care to leave the pellet undisturbed during transfer of the supernatant, and confirm that the supernatant is clear of pellet.\nVortex pellet samples every 2 min until the pellet is completely dissolved. Then add 500 µl of isolation solution to the dissolved pellet.\nImmediately following the addition of isolation solution to the pellet, centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 37 °C. Pipet the supernatant and combine with the supernatant collected earlier.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 µl of isolation solution for SDS-PAGE analysis.\n\tNOTE: PBS or TBS can be used instead of isolation solution to resuspend the pellet.\n3. Isolation of Exosome Pellet\nTo 11 ml of the collected supernatant, add 3.3 ml of ExoQuick-TC reagent and incubate at 4 °C for at least 12 hr.\n\tNOTE: The ratio of volume of supernatant to ExoQuick-TC reagent can be adjusted to increase or decrease the exosomal yield. We observed that lesser volumes of added reagent produce smaller yields of exosomes.\nFollowing incubation, centrifuge the sample/ExoQuick-TC mix at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 25 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh tube for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nThe exosome pellet can be stored at -80 °C for DNA, RNA and protein extraction and quantification of exosome particles using CD9 ELISA11.\n\tNOTE: The exosome pellet can be stored at -80 °C for 1 year with limited freezing and thawing.\n4. Biomarker Detection and Analysis of Exosome Pellet\nFor downstream analyses, extract DNA, RNA and protein from the exosome pellet using the DNA/RNA/Protein isolation kit and an RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Determine concentrations using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280nm with 2 µl of sample.",
    "Perform quantitative real time RT-PCR (qPCR) using TaqMan microRNA assays (in our case, we used human miR-192- and miR-1207-5p-specific assays) or miRNA-specific primers.\nFor SDS-PAGE analysis, use 4-12% Bis-Tris gel and separate protein samples by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Visualize gels using the silver staining kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPerform western blot analysis using PVDF membranes according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Use rabbit polyclonal antibody to apoptosis-linked gene-2 interacting protein X or ALIX and mouse monoclonal antibody to tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein or TSG101 in the western blot detection. Quantify the density of the bands by open access NIH ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) or a similar program.\nQuantify the number of urinary exosome particles obtained using a CD9 ELISA kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.\nSubscription Required.
