    "NOTE: All animal work was performed in accordance with European Union (EU) directive 2011/63/EU and the German Animal Welfare Act. The protocol is meant to be followed without interruption, from mounting to imaging the sample. Depending on the practical experience, it will take 2-3 hr to start a time-lapse experiment. Data processing is not included in this time calculation. All the material required for the experiment can be found in the checklist of material needed before starting that is provided as a supplementary document. Wear powder free gloves during the steps 1, 2, 3 and 4. For steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the protocol also refer to the official microscope operating manual.\n1. Preparatory Work Before the Imaging Experiment\nFluorescent Bead Stock Solution\n\t\nFor this protocol, use the 500 or 1,000 nm diameter polystyrene beads (labeled with red emitting fluorescent dye). The working dilution of the beads is 1:4,000. First, vortex the bead stock solution for 1 min. Dilute 10 µl of beads in 990 µl of ddH2O. Store the solution in the dark at 4 °C and use this 1:100 dilution as the stock solution for further dilution in 1:40.\nPreparing Solution for the Sample chamber\n\t\nIn a 100 ml beaker mix 38.2 ml of E3 medium without methylene blue, 0.8 ml of 10 mM N-phenylthiourea and 1 ml of 0.4% MS-222. It is beneficial to use filtered E3 medium to avoid small particles of dust or undissolved crystals floating in the sample chamber later.\nFluorescent Fish Embryo Selection\n\t\nIn the days prior to the experiment, prepare embryos expressing fluorescent proteins. Right before the experiment, sort the embryos under the fluorescent stereoscope for desirable strength of the fluorescent signal. Take 5-10 healthy embryos and dechorionate them using tweezers.",
    "NOTE: This protocol is optimized for 16-72 hr old embryos.\n2. Setting Up the Sample Chamber\nAssembling the Three Chamber Windows\n\t\nThere are 4 windows in the sample chamber, one for the objective and three to be sealed with the coverslips (18 mm diameter, selected thickness 0.17 mm). Store these coverslips in 70% ethanol. Wipe them clean before use with ether:ethanol (1:4).\nInsert the coverslip into the window using fine forceps and make sure it fits into the smallest groove. Cover it with the 17 mm diameter rubber O-ring and screw in the illumination adapter ring using the chamber window tool. Repeat the process for the other two windows.\nAttaching the Remaining Chamber Parts\n\t\nScrew the adapter for an appropriate objective into the fourth remaining side of the chamber. Insert the 15 mm diameter O-ring into the center of the adapter.\nScrew in the white Luer-Lock adapter into the lower right opening in the chamber and the grey drain connector in the upper left opening. Block all the three remaining openings with the black blind plugs.\nAttach the Peltier block and the metal dovetail slide bottom of the chamber using an Allen wrench. Attach the hose with the 50 ml syringe to the Luer-Lock adapter. Insert the temperature probe into the chamber.\nInserting the Objectives and the Chamber into the Microscope\n\t\nCheck under the stereoscope that all the objectives are clean. Use the 10X/0.2 illumination objectives and the Plan-Apochromat 20X/1.0 W detection objective and make sure that its refractive index correction collar is set to 1.33 for water. Screw the detection objective into the microscope, while keeping the illuminating objectives covered.\nRemove the protective plastic caps covering the illuminating objectives. Carefully slide the chamber into the microscope and tighten it with the securing screw.",
    "Connect the temperature probe and the Peltier block with the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The two tubes that circulate the cooling liquid for the Peltier block are compatible with both connectors. They form a functioning circuit irrespective of the orientation of connection.\nFill the chamber through the syringe with solution prepared in step 1.2 up to the upper edge of the chamber windows. Check that the chamber is not leaking.\nStart the microscope, incubation and the controlling and storage computers. Start the microscope-operating software and set the incubation temperature to 28.5 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: It will take 1 hr to completely equilibrate. Prepare the sample in the meantime.\n3. Sample Preparation\nPreparing the Agarose Mix\n\t\n15 min before making of the agarose mix, melt one 1 ml aliquot of 1% low melting point agarose (dissolved in E3 medium) in a heating block set to 70 °C. Once the agarose is completely molten, transfer 600 µl into a fresh 1.5 ml tube, add 250 µl of E3 medium, 50 µl of 0.4% MS-222 and 25 µl of vortexed bead stock solution.\n\t\tNOTE: This makes 925 µl of the mix, while additional 75 µl is calculated for the liquid added later together with the embryos.\nKeep the tube in a second heating block at 38-40 °C or ensure that the agarose is very close to its gelling point before putting sample embryos into it.\nMounting the Embryos\n\t\nTake five glass capillaries of 20 µl volume (with a black mark, ~1 mm inner diameter) and insert the matching Teflon tip plungers into them. Push the plunger through the capillary so that the Teflon tip is at the bottom of the capillary.",
    "Transfer five embryos (a number that can be mounted at once) with a glass or plastic pipette into the tube of vortexed 37 °C warm agarose mix.\n\t\tNOTE: Try to carry over a minimum volume of liquid together with the embryos.\nInsert the capillary into the mix and suck one embryo inside by pulling the plunger up. Ensure that the head of the embryo enters the capillary before the tail. Avoid any air bubbles between the plunger and the sample. There should be ±2 cm of agarose above the embryo and ±1 cm below it. Repeat for the remaining embryos.\nWait until the agarose solidifies completely, which happens within a few minutes and then store the samples in E3 medium, by sticking them to the wall of a beaker with plasticine or tape. The bottom opening of the capillary should be hanging free in the solution allowing gas exchange to the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: A similar protocol to the sections 3.1 and 3.2 can be also found on the OpenSPIM wiki page http://openspim.org/Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation.\n4. Sample Positioning\nSample Holder Assembly\n\t\nInsert 2 plastic sleeves of the right size (black) against each other into the sample holder stem. Their slit sides have to face outwards. Attach the clamp screw loosely by turning it 2-3 rounds. Insert the capillary through the clamp screw and push it through the holder until the black color band becomes visible on the other side. Avoid touching the plunger.\nTighten the clamp screw. Push the excess 1 cm of agarose below the embryo out of the capillary and cut it. Insert the stem into the sample holder disc.",
    "Confirm in the software that the microscope stage is in the load position. Use guiding rails to glide the whole holder with the sample vertically downwards into the microscope. Turn it, so that the magnetic holder disc locks into position.\nLocating the Capillary\n\t\nFrom now on, control the sample positioning by the software. In the Locate tab choose the Locate capillary option and position the capillary in x, y and z into focus just above the detection objective lens. Use the graphical representation in the specimen navigator for guidance.\nPush the embryo gently out of the capillary until it is in front of the pupil of the detection objective.\n\t\tNOTE: The 'Locate capillary' is the only step in the remaining protocol, during which the upper lid of the microscope should be opened and the sample pushed out.\nLocating the Sample\n\t\nSwitch to 'Locate sample' option and at 0.5 zoom bring the zebrafish eye into the center of the field of view. Rotate the embryo, so that the light sheet will not pass through any highly refractive or absorbing parts of the specimen before it reaches the eye. Likewise, the emitted fluorescence needs a clear path out of the specimen. Click on 'Set Home Position'.\nOpen the front door of the microscope and put the plastic cover with a 3 mm opening on top of the chamber to avoid evaporation.\n\t\tNOTE: If the liquid level drops below the imaging level, the experiment will be compromised.\nCheck the heartbeat of the embryo as a proxy for overall health. If it is too slow, use another sample (compare to non-mounted controls; specific values depend on developmental stage). Switch to final zoom setting and readjust the position of the embryo.\n5. Setting up a Multidimensional Acquisition\nAcquisition Parameters",
    "Switch to the 'Acquisition' tab. Define the light path including laser lines, detection objective, laser blocking filter, beam splitter and the cameras.\nActivate the pivot scan checkbox. Define the other acquisition settings like the bit depth, image format, light sheet thickness and choose single sided illumination.\nPress 'Continuous' and depending on the intensity of the obtained image change the laser power and camera exposure time.\n\t\tNOTE: For adjusting all the imaging settings use less laser power (0.5% of 100 mW laser, 30 msec exposure time), than for the actual experiment to avoid unnecessary photo damage to the specimen.\nLight Sheet Adjustment\n\t\nSwitch to the 'Dual Sided Illumination' and activate the 'Online Dual Side Fusio'n checkbox. Start the 'Lightsheet Auto-adjust wizard'. Follow the instructions step by step.\n\t\tNOTE: The wizard moves the light sheet into the focal plane of the detection objective, and ensures that it is not tilted and its waist is in the center of the field of view. After finishing the automatic adjustment, the positions of the left and right light sheets are automatically updated in the software. An improvement in image quality should now be apparent. Activate the 'Z-stack' checkbox.\nCheck the light sheet adjustment by inspecting the symmetry of the point spread function (PSF) given by the fluorescent beads in the xz and yz ortho view. If it is not symmetric, manually adjust the light sheet parameter position up and down until achieving a symmetric hourglass shaped PSF (Figure 1A).\nMultidimensional Acquisition Settings\n\t\nDefine the z-stack with the 'First Slice' and 'Last Slice' options and set the z step to 1 µm.\n\t\tNOTE: The light sheet in this microscope is static and the z sectioning is achieved by moving the sample through. Always use the 'Continuous Drive' option for faster acquisition of z-stacks.",
    "Activate the 'Time Series' checkbox. Define the total number of time points and the interval in between them.\nActivate the 'Multiview' checkbox. Add the current view into the multiview list, where the x, y, z and angle information is stored. Use the stage controller to rotate the capillary and define the other desired views. Set up a z-stack at each view and add them to the multiview list.\n\t\tNOTE: The software sorts the views in a serial fashion, so that the capillary is turned unidirectionally, while the image is acquired.\nDrift Correction and Starting the Experiment\n\t\nOnce the acquisition set up is complete, wait 15-30 min before starting the actual experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample initially drifts a few micrometers in x, y and z, but should stop within 30 min. If the sample keeps drifting for longer, use another sample or remount.\nSwitch to the 'Maintain' tab and in the 'Streaming' option define how the data should be saved, e.g., one file per time point or separate file for each view and channel. Go back to the 'Acquisition' tab, press 'Start Experiment' and define the file name, location where it should be saved and the file format (use .czi).\nObserve the acquisition of the first time point to confirm that everything is running flawlessly. Immediately proceed with registration and fusion of the first time point as described in steps 6 and 7, to confirm that it will be possible to process the whole dataset.\n6. Multiview Registration\nMultiview Reconstruction Application\n\t\nAt the end of the imaging session, transfer the data from the data storage computer at the microscope to a data processing computer. Use the 'MultiView ReconstructionApplication'20,21,31 implemented in Fiji32 for data processing (Figure 1B).\nDefine Dataset",
    "Update Fiji: Fiji > Help > Update ImageJ and Fiji > Help > Update Fiji. Use the main ImageJ and Fiji update sites.\nTransfer the entire dataset into one folder. The results and intermediate files of the processing will be saved into this folder. Start the MultiView Reconstruction Application: Fiji > Plugins > Multiview Reconstruction > Multiview Reconstruction Application.\nSelect 'define a new dataset'. As type of dataset select the meu option \"Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 Dataset (LOCI Bioformats)\" and create a name for the .xml file. Then select the first .czi file of the dataset (i.e. file without index). It contains the image data as well as the metadata of the recording.\n\t\tNOTE: Once the program opens the first .czi file, the metadata are loaded into the program.\nConfirm that the number of the angles, channels, illuminations and observe the voxel size from the metadata. Upon pressing OK, observe three separate windows open (Figure 1C): a log window, showing the progress of the processing and its results, the 'ViewSetup Explorer' and a console, showing error messages of Fiji.\n\t\tNOTE: The 'ViewSetup Explorer' is a user-friendly interface that shows each view, channel and illumination and allows for selection of the files of interest. Additionally, the 'ViewSetup Explorer' allows for steering of all the processing steps.\nSelect the files that need to be processed and press the right mouse button into the explorer. Observe a window open with different processing steps (Figure 1C).\nUpon defining the dataset, observe that an .xml file in the folder with the data is created.\n\t\tNOTE: This file contains the metadata that were confirmed before.\nIn the top right corner observe two buttons 'info' and 'save'. Pressing 'info' displays a summary of the content of the .xml file. Pressing 'save' will save the processing results.",
    "NOTE: While processing in the 'MultiView Reconstruction Application' the different processing steps need to be saved into the .xml before closing Fiji.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53966/53966fig1.jpg",

The system is aligned (center), when the bead image has a symmetrical hourglass shape in xz and yz projections. The examples of misaligned light sheet in either direction are shown on left and right. The maximum intensity projections of a 500 nm bead in xz, yz and xy axes are shown. Note that the ratio of intensity of the central peak of the Airy disc (in xy) to the side lobes is greater, when the lightsheet is correctly aligned compared to the misaligned situation. Images were taken with 20X/1.0 W objective at 0.7 zoom. Scale bar represents 5 µm. (B) The dataset is defined and then resaved into the HDF5 format. The beads are segmented and then registered. For a time series each time point is registered onto a reference time point. The data are finally fused into a single isotropic volume.

    "Resave Dataset in HDF5 Format\n\t\nTo resave the entire dataset, select all the files with Ctrl/Apple+a and right click. Then select resave dataset and as HDF5.\nA window will appear displaying a warning that all views of the current dataset will be resaved. Press yes.\n\t\tNOTE: The program will continue to resave the .czi files to hdf5 by opening every file and resaving the different resolution levels of the hdf5 format. It will confirm with 'done' upon completion. Resaving usually takes a few min per timepoint (see Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Since the files in the hdf5 format can be loaded very fast, it is now possible to view the unregistered dataset by 'right click' into the explorer and toggling 'display in BigDataViewer (on/off)'. A BigDataViewer window will appear with the selected view (Figure 1C). The core functions of the BigDataViewer33 are explained in Table 2 and http://fiji.sc/BigDataViewer.\nDetect Interest Points\n\t\nSelect all time points with Ctrl/Apple+a and right click select detect interest points.\nSelect Difference-of-Gaussian34 for type of interest point detection. Since the bead-based registration is used here, type \"beads\" into the field for label interest points. Activate 'Downsample images prior to segmentation'.\nIn the next window, observe the detection settings. For 'subpixel localization' use '3-dimensional quadratic fit'34 and to determine the Difference-of-Gaussian values and radius for bead segmentation use 'interactive' in the i'nterest point specification'.\nFor 'Downsample XY' use 'Match Z Resolution (less downsampling)' and for 'Downsample Z' use 1×. The z step size is bigger than the xy pixel size, thus simply down sampling the xy to match the z resolution is sufficient. Select 'compute on CPU (JAVA)'. Press 'OK'.",
    "In a pop up window, select one view for testing the parameters from the drop down menu. Once the view loads, adjust brightness and contrast of the window with Fiji > Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast or Ctrl + Shift + C. Tick the box 'look for maxima (green)' for bead detection.\nObserve the segmentation in the 'viewSetup' as green rings around the detections when looking for maxima and red for minima. The segmentation is defined by two parameters, the Difference-of-Gaussian Values for Sigma 1 and the Threshold (Figure 1D). Adjust them to segment as many beads around the sample and as few false positive detections within the sample as possible (Figure 1D). Detect each bead only once and not multiple times (Figure 1E). After determining the optimal parameters, press 'done'.\n\t\tNOTE: The detection starts by loading each individual view of the time point and segmenting the beads. In the log file, the program outputs the number of beads it detected per view. The detection should be done in a few seconds (see Table 1).\nPress save when the amount of detections is appropriate (600 to several thousand per view).\n\t\tNOTE: A folder will be created in the data directory, which will contain the information about the coordinates of the detected beads.\nRegister Using Interest Points\n\t\nSelect all time points with Ctrl/Apple+a, right click and select 'Register using Interest Points'.\nUse 'fast 3d geometric hashing (rotation invariant)' for bead detection as 'registration algorithm'.\n\t\tNOTE: This algorithm assumes no prior knowledge about the orientation and positioning of the different views with respect to each other.",
    "For registration of the views onto each other, select 'register timepoints individually' as 'type of registration'. For 'interest points' in the selected channel, the previously specified label for the interest points should now be visible (i.e. \"beads\").\nIn the next window, use the pre set values for registration. Fix the first view by selecting 'Fix tiles: Fix first tile and use Do not map back' (use this if tiles are not fixed) in the 'Map back tiles' section.\nUse an 'affine transformation model' with 'regularization'.\n\t\tNOTE: The allowed error for RANSAC will be 5px and the 'significance for a descriptor match' will be 10. For 'regularization' use a 'rigid model' with a lambda of 0.10, which means that the transformation is 10% rigid and 90% affine35. Press OK to start the registration.\n\t\tNOTE: As displayed in the log window, first each view is matched with all the other views. Then the random sample consensus (RANSAC)36 tests the correspondences and excludes false positives. For a robust registration, the RANSAC value should be higher than 90%. When a sufficient number of true candidates corresponding between two views are found, a transformation model is computed between each match with the average displacement in pixels. Then the iterative global optimization is carried out and all views are registered onto the fixed view. With successful registration, a transformation model is calculated and displayed with its scaling and the displacement in pixels. The average error should be optimally below 1 px and the scaling of the transformation close to 1. The registration is executed in seconds (see Table 1).\nConfirm that there is no shift between different views as observed on fine structures within the sample, e.g. cell membranes. Then save the transformation for each view into the .xml file.",
    "NOTE: Now the registered views are overlapping each other in the BigDataViewer (Figure 2A) and the bead images should be overlaying as well (Figure 2B).\nRemove the transformations by selecting the time points right click on them and then select Remove Transformations > Latest/Newest Transformation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53966/53966fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Results of the multiview reconstruction.

    "In the 'Basic Registration Parameters window select Match against one reference time point (no global optimization) for Type of registration'. Keep the other settings the same as in the registration of the individual time points.\nIn the next window, select the time point to be used as a reference, typically a time point in the middle of the time-lapse. Tick the box 'consider each timepoint as rigid unit', since the individual views within each time point are already registered onto each other.\nTick the box for 'Show timeseries statistics'. The other registration parameters remain as before including the regularization. Press OK.\n\t\tNOTE: In the log window, the same output will be displayed as in the individual time point registration. If the registration for the individual time points was successful and robust, the RANSAC is now 99-100% and the average, minimum and maximum error is usually below 1 px. Save this registration before proceeding.\n7. Multiview Fusion\nNOTE: The resulting transformations from the registration steps are used to compute a fused isotropic stack out of the multiple views. This stack has increased number of z slices compared to the original data, because the z spacing is now equal to the original pixel size in xy. The fusion can be performed by either a content-based multiview fusion21,31 or Bayesian-based multiview deconvolution31, which are both implemented in the multiview reconstruction application.\nBounding Box\n\tNOTE: Fusion is a computationally expensive process (see Table 1), thus reducing the amount of data by defining a bounding box significantly increases the speed of processing.\n\t\nSelect all time points right click and choose Define 'Bounding Box'. Use 'Define with BigDataViewer' and choose a name for the bounding box.",
    "Move the slider for 'min' and 'max' in every axis to determine the region of interest and then press 'OK'. The parameters of the bounding box will be displayed.\n\t\tNOTE: The bounding box will contain everything within the green box that is overlaid with a transparent magenta layer.\nContent-based Multiview Fusion\n\tNOTE: Content-based multiview fusion21 takes the image quality differences over the stack (i.e. degradation of the signal in z) into account and applies higher weights for better image quality instead of using a simple averaging.\n\t\nSelect the time point(s) that should be fused in the 'ViewSetup Explorer', right click and select 'Image Fusion/Deconvolution'.\nIn the Image Fusion window, select 'Weighted-average fusion' from the drop down menu, and choose 'Use pre-defined Bounding Box for Bounding Box'. For the output of the fused image select 'Append to current XML Project', which writes new hdf5 files to the already existing hdf5 files and allows using the registered unfused views and the fused image together. Press 'OK'.\nThen in the' Pre-define Bounding Box' pop up window select the name of the previously defined bounding box and press 'OK'.\nObserve the parameters of the bounding box in the next window. For quick fusion, apply a down sampling on the fused dataset.\n\t\tNOTE: If the fused stack is above a certain size, the program will recommend using a more memory efficient 'ImageLib2 containe'r. Switch from 'ArrayImg' to the 'PlanarImg (large images, easy to display) or CellImg (large images)' container, which allow processing of larger data. Otherwise use the predefined settings and apply 'blending and content-based fusion'. Proceed by pressing 'OK'.\nObserve the hdf5 settings in the next window. Use the predefined parameters and start the fusion process. Make sure that Fiji has assigned enough memory in Edit > Options > Memory & Threads.\nMultiview Deconvolution",
    "NOTE: Multiview Deconvolution31 is another type of multiview fusion. Here additionally to the fusion, the PSF of the imaging system is taken into account in order to deconvolve the image and yield increased resolution and contrast of the signal (compared in Figure 2C-J, Figure 5 and Movie 3).\n\t\nSelect the time point(s) to be deconvolved, right click and press 'Image Fusion/Deconvolution'.\nSelect 'Multiview Deconvolution' and use 'the pre-defined bounding box and append to the current XML project'. Select the bounding box and continue.\n\t\tNOTE: The pre-defined parameters for the deconvolution are a good starting point. For the first trial use '20 iterations' and assess the impact of the deconvolution by using the 'Debug mode'. Finally set the compute on to in 512 x 512 x 512 blocks.\nIn the next window, use the pre-defined settings. Set the 'debug mode' to display the results every '5 iterations'.\n\t\tNOTE: The output of the deconvolution is 32-bit data, however the BigDataViewer currently only supports 16-bit data. In order to append the output of the deconvolution to the existing hdf5 dataset, it has to be converted to 16-bit.\nFor the conversion, run 'Use min/max of the first image (might saturate intensities over time)'.\n\t\tNOTE: The deconvolution will then start by loading the images and preparing them for the deconvolution.\nBigDataServer\n\t\nIn order to share the very large XML/HDF5 datasets use the http server BigDataServer33. An introduction to how to setup and connect to such server can be found at http://fiji.sc/BigDataServer.\nTo connect to an existing BigDataServer open Fiji > Plugins > BigDataViewer > BrowseBigDataServer.\nEnter the URL including the port into the window.\n\t\tNOTE: The movies described in this publication are accessible via this address: http://opticcup.mpi-cbg.de:8085",
