    "1. Solution preparation\nPrepare the reference substance stock solution: Weigh 10.6 mg of salidroside, 5.24 mg of gallic acid, and 5.21 mg of ethyl gallic acid separately on an electronic analytical balance and add them individually into a 5 mL volumetric flask. Then, add HPLC-grade methanol to dissolve and dilute to 5 mL. Finally, shake well to obtain the reference substance stock solution with mass concentrations of 2.120 mg/mL, 1.048 mg/mL, and 1.042 mg/mL, respectively.\n\tNOTE: The reference substance stock solution contains 2.120 mg/mL salidroside, 1.048 mg/mL gallic acid, and 1.042 mg/mL ethyl gallate as the stock solution of each solution in the subsequent standard curve.\nPrepare the test sample solution. Extract 2.8 g of RG (Table of Materials) with 10 mL of HPLC-grade methanol using an ultrasonic cleansing machine (Power: 200 W, frequency: 40 kHz) for 30 min, and then filter it with a 0.22 µm filter for the system adaptability test.\nPrepare a mixed reference solution that contains 0.590 mg/mL salidroside, 2.030 mg/mL gallic acid, and 1.930 mg/mL ethyl gallate.\n\tNOTE: Each standard (2.950 mg of salidroside, 10.150 mg of gallic acid, and 9.650 mg of ethyl gallic acid) is dissolved in a 5 mL volumetric flask in HPLC-grade methanol as the dissolution medium.\nObtain the theoretical content of each characteristic component of RG for ultrapure water extraction.\n\t\nPlace 2.8 g of RG in a 500 mL conical flask, add 200 mL of ultrapure water, and ultrasonically extract (Power: 200 W, frequency: 40 kHz) for 60 min. Then, filter it with a 0.22 µm filter.\nDetermine the content of the test solution according to the linear equation obtained in the following experiment.\n2. Chromatographic condition",
    "Set the chromatographic conditions as shown in Table 1 for high-performance liquid chromatography. For details about the instrument used, refer to the Table of Materials.\n3. System adaptability test\nInvestigate the linear relationship.\n\t\nDilute the reference stock solutions of gallic acid and ethyl gallate by 5, 10, 25, 50, and 125 times, and the reference stock solutions of salidroside by 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 times to obtain the gradient concentration solution for drawing a standard curve.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the dilution ratio of the standard curve according to the preliminary experiment of the sample treatment. In the preliminary experiment, the stock solutions of the three standards were first diluted 5, 10, 25, 50, and 125 times, and then the first standard curve was plotted. However, when the concentration of the test sample was detected, it was found that the concentrations of salidroside did not fall within the linear range of this standard curve and, therefore, the concentrations were adjusted to include them in the curve. In summary, the above preliminary experiments were used to determine the final dilution concentrations of the three test samples for subsequent experimental studies.\nPrecision testing: Inject 10 µL of the mixed reference solution into the HPLC system six times daily and run the samples with the same HPLC conditions described in step 2.1. Record the peak area of each feature component.\nStability testing experiments: Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample solution and determine the peak areas of the HPLC according to the chromatographic conditions after 0 h, 6 h, 10 h, 12 h, 14 h, 16 h, 18 h, 20 h, and 24 h, respectively.\n\tNOTE: The peak areas are recorded automatically by the HPLC system.",
    "Reproducibility test: Take six samples of the same batch of RG to prepare the test sample solution according to the method in step 1.2. Inject 10 µL of each sample into the HPLC system. Run the samples as described in step 2.1 and determine reproducibility.\n\tNOTE: Repeatability was evaluated by comparing the concentration differences between the six samples.\nRecovery experiment\n\t\nPrepare six portions of the same batch of RG for the test solution. Then, add about 50% of the reference substance of each index component in the test solution to calculate the recovery rate. Run these samples in the HPLC system with the same conditions described in step 2.1.\nCalculate the recovery rate.\n\t\t​NOTE: Recovery rate = (C - A) / B x 100, where A is the amount of component to be measured in the test solution, B is the amount of reference substance added, and C is the measured value of the solution containing the reference substance and the RG sample. Refer to step 2.1 for the chromatographic conditions to perform the above steps (i.e., steps 3.1-3.5).\n4. In vitro dissolution test\nCarry out the dissolution test using the paddle method of the second method of general rule 0931 from Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition)12.\n\tNOTE: Sampling technique and equipment: The drug dissolution apparatus (Table of Materials) has a dissolution cup, a paddle, a temperature control system, and a speed adjustment system. Before starting the dissolution experiment, the water is preheated to a set temperature, and then the corresponding speed is set. Start recording the time immediately after adding RG.\nAdd 100 mL of ultrapure water into the dissolution cup of the drug dissolution apparatus and maintain the temperature at 37 °C ± 0.5 °C. Set the rotation speed to 100 rpm.",
    "NOTE: The dissolution apparatus has a heating device that allows the temperature to be set within the system. There was no significant difference in the dissolution rate of salidroside in water, artificial gastric juice (16.4 mL of diluted hydrochloric acid [234 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted to 1000 mL with water] with about 800 mL of water and 10 g of pepsin, well shaken, and diluted with water to 1,000 mL), and artificial intestinal juice (phosphate buffer [pH 6.8] containing trypsin)13. The most readily available water (ultrapure) was selected as the dissolution medium.\nAdd 2.8 g of RG into a dissolution cup and start recording the duration of dissolution immediately. Collect a total of 1 mL of the sample with an injector (see Table of Materials) at 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 60 min, and make up the volume in the dissolution cup with the dissolution medium at the same temperature immediately.\n\tNOTE: The sampling tube in the dissolution cup cannot collect small sample volumes, so the injector is used to collect the sample. Samples must be collected quickly to avoid missing specified collection time points.\nImmediately filter the collected samples through a 0.22 µm microporous membrane and take the subsequent filtrate. Determine the content of each component at each time point by HPLC (as per step 2.1) and calculate the cumulative dissolution.\n\t\nTo calculate the cumulative dissolution, calculate the dissolution of each time point (Xn):\n\t\tXn = A / B x 100, where A is the quantity of components measured at each time point and B is the theoretical content of each component.\nThen, calculate the cumulative dissolution (Y):",
    "Y = Xn + (X1 + ... + Xn-1) x V2 / V1, where V1 is the total volume of the dissolution medium and V2 is the volume of solute added after each sampling.\n\t\t​NOTE: Due to the low response values of salidroside and gallic acid in the chromatogram, the cumulative dissolution of salidroside and ethyl gallate at the 1 min time point was not plotted in the dissolution curve.\n5. Fitting the dissolution model\nImport the cumulative dissolution data at each time point into the data analysis software.\nUse the drug dissolution analysis plug-in in the data analysis software to fit the GompertzMod equation, the Gompertz equation, the Logistic equation, and the Weibull equation14. The larger the value of R2, the better the curve-fitting effect is.\n\t\nStart the software, select the Book1 window to enter the Origin Data Editing window.\nIn the first column A(X)-Long Name input Time, define Time as time, and input each dissolution determination time. Input Data in the second column B(Y)-Long Name, define Data as the cumulative dissolution, input the cumulative dissolution percentage of each dissolution determination time.\nAfter data input, select the column A(X) and B(Y), and select the Drug Dissolution Analysis plug-in in the software menu bar and click on Fit Dissolution Data > Concatenate Fit > OK. The software generates the fitting results of each model.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
