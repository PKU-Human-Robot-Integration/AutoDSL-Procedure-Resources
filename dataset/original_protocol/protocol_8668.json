    "1. Preparation of fusogenic SUV and LUV\nPreparation of fusogenic lipid mixture\nPrepare stock solutions of neutral, cationic, anionic, and fluorescent lipids in chloroform at 25-50 mg/mL (for example, neutral DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), cationic ethyl-PC (1,2-dimyristoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine), anionic POPA (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate), and fluorescent cholesteryl-Bodipy-FL12, respectively) by weighing appropriate amounts of dry lipids and dissolving them in 100% chloroform (Caution! Do this under a fume hood), or diluting commercially available chloroform stocks of lipids with chloroform.\n\t\tNOTE: Both natural lipid extracts and pure synthetic lipids can be used and demonstrate similar results.\nMix 2.5 mg a cationic and 2.5 mg of a neutral lipid in chloroform stock (1.1.1) in a glass vial.\n\t\tNOTE: This step yields 5 mg of cationic lipid mixture in chloroform, containing 50% weight fraction of cationic lipids. When needed, add 0.5% weight fraction of a fluorescent lipid to the mixture.\nMix 1 mg of anionic and 4 mg of neutral lipids in chloroform stocks (1.1.1) in a glass vial. This gives 5 mg of anionic lipid mixture containing 20% weight fraction of anionic lipids.\nEvaporate chloroform under a stream of nitrogen to form a thin layer of dry lipid.\nRemove the residual chloroform under vacuum for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Traditionally this step takes much longer (1-12 h), but we found that a longer treatment provides no obvious improvement in coupling properties of SUV.\nHydrate the dry lipid film by adding 0.5 mL buffer A (100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4) to each vial and leaving them to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and then vortex until the lipid film is completely detached from the glass surface and becomes a homogenous lipid suspension. This should take about 20 - 40 s.\nFormation of SUV and LUV by extrusion",
    "Assemble an extrusion system (see the Table of Materials) with two 1 mL syringes using a polycarbonate filter with one of the following pore sizes: 100 or 200 nm to form SUV, and 400 or 800 nm to form LUV.\nTransfer the lipid suspension into a syringe.\nExtrude the suspension by passing it through the filter 21 times, as shown elsewhere18,19.\n\t\tNOTE: An odd number of passages is needed to minimize transfer into the vesicle solution of large lipid clumps stuck to the filter side facing the original lipid suspension.\nTransfer vesicle solution into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n2. Formation of Fusogenic GUV by Inverted Emulsion Method\nNOTE: This procedure is illustrated in Figure 2.\nPreparation of lipid-in-oil solution\nMix a chloroform stock (see step 1.1.1) of a neutral lipid (2 mg) and an anionic lipid (0.5 mg) with 1 mL of hexadecane in 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nEvaporate chloroform from the mixture under constant mixing and heating at 80 °C for 30 min keeping the tube open. Close the tube and let cool to room temperature.\nFormation of a lipid monolayer at the lipid-in-oil/aqueous buffer interface\nPlace 200 µL of the lipid-in-oil solution on top of 0.5 mL buffer B (20 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MOPS pH 7.4) in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Note the convex shape of the phase separation border due to surface tension mismatch between the oil and the aqueous buffer (Figure 2A).\nWait until the phase separation border flattens, which is indicative of lipid monolayer formation on it. This typically takes 30 - 60 min at room temperature.\nPreparation of a water-in-oil emulsion\nPrepare a solution of a water-soluble non-ionic polysaccharide in buffer B, with a density higher than density of water (e.g. 15% Ficoll-400 (w/v), with density 1.05 g/mL)",
    "NOTE: Optionally, one can add fluorescent water-soluble dyes to the buffer for better visualization of GUV, and any other desired aqueous contents of the GUVs.\nTransfer 0.5 µL of the above mixture to a separate 1.5-mL centrifuge tube with 100 µL of the lipid-in-oil solution from 2.1.2.\nSonicate (44 kHz at 14 W) the mixture for 30 s in an ultrasonic water bath. Then, vigorously vortex for 45 min to form a water-in-oil emulsion, where each droplet will be coated by a lipid monolayer (Figure 2B).\nConversion of the water-in-oil emulsion into GUV\nPlace the resultant emulsion on top of the lipid-in-oil/aqueous interface, and immediately centrifuge the tube in a table-top centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 2 min. The resultant pellet of GUV should be clearly visible (Figure 2C).\nCool the tube to 4 °C in a refrigerator to solidify the lipid-in-oil mixture (Figure 2D, hexadecane solidifies below 18 °C), carefully remove frozen oil, and then withdraw the aqueous phase.\n\t\tNOTE: To facilitate oil removal freeze a wire bent in the shape of an anchor was used.\nResuspend the GUV pellet in 50 µL of fresh buffer B, transfer to a fresh tube, and inspect under a fluorescence microscope using a 100X oil immersion objective (Figure 2E).\n3. Monitoring Vesicle Fusion with Cobalt-Calcein Method\nPreparation of a gel-filtration gravity column.\nSoak ~10 g of a gel-filtration resin (e.g. superfine sephadex G-50) in 100 mL of deionized water, and let swell overnight.\nPack 3 mL of the resin into a disposable plastic gravity flow column, wash it with ultrapure water, and equilibrate with buffer C (100 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4) at room temperature.\nPreparation of SUV+ or SUV0 loaded with cobalt-calcein.",
    "Prepare a solution containing 1 mM calcein, 1 mM CoCl2, 98 mM NaCl, 10 mM MOPS, then bring pH to 7.4.\n\t\tNOTE: The essence of the method is that free fluorescent calcein forms a non-fluorescent complex with Co2+. It becomes fluorescent again upon addition of EDTA, which having higher affinity for Co2+, displaces calcein from the cobalt-calcein complex (Figure 3A).\nAdd 500 µL of this solution to a dry film of cationic or neutral lipids prepared as described in 1.1.\nPrepare 100 nm SUV by extrusion as described in 1.2.\nPellet extruded SUV at 1,000,000 x g for 20 min in a table-top ultracentrifuge and resuspend in 1 mL of buffer C. Repeat pelleting and resuspension three times; use 0.6 mL of buffer C for the last resuspension.\n\t\tNOTE: These steps remove most of the external cobalt-calcein.\nRemove the remaining external cobalt-calcein by passing SUV through a disposable gravity-flow column loaded with the gel-filtration resin equilibrated with buffer C as described for step 3.1.2.\n\t\tNOTE: We typically discard the first milliliter volume of the flow-through and collect the second milliliter, which contains external cobalt-calcein free SUV.\nPreparation of SUV- loaded with EDTA\nPrepare solution of 10 mM EDTA, 80 mM NaCl, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4.\nAdd 500 µL of this solution to a dry film of anionic lipids prepared as described in 1.1.\nPrepare SUV- by extrusion as described in 1.2.\nPellet and resuspend SUV- as described in 3.2.4.\nRemove the remaining EDTA by passing SUV- through the gel-filtration column as described in 3.2.5.\nPreparing SUV for fusion\nDilute SUV0, SUV+, and SUV- with buffer D (1 mM MOPS, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.2 mM CoCl2 and the desired concentration of KCl. Use 5 µL of each type of SUV per 1 mL of buffer D.",
    "Incubate the mixture for at least 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: This step will minimize the background fluorescence level by blocking calcein that is surface-bound to SUV+.\nVesicle fusion\nStart fusion reaction by mixing 1 mL of SUV+ or SUV0 with 1 mL of SUV− (diluted in buffer D as described above) in a 2-mL fluorimeter cuvette, and monitor increasing fluorescence of calcein using 480 nm excitation and 510 nm emission (Figure 3B).\nWait until the reaction comes to completion.\nAdd a mixture of detergent Triton X-100 and EDTA (0.05% final concentration and 7 mM, respectively) to release calcein out of vesicles and obtain the maximum fluorescence signal.\nDetermine the extent of fusion defined as the percentage of the maximum fluorescence signal following the detergent addition as shown in Figure 3C.\n4. Fast Reconstitution of Membrane Proteins into Fusogenic Proteoliposomes\nNOTE: This procedure is illustrated in Figure 4A.\nPrepare a gravity flow column with the gel-filtration resin as described in 3.1, and equilibrate it with buffer A at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: All further manipulations must be done strictly at ≤ 4 °C, unless otherwise indicated, to minimize loss of protein activity.\nAdjust concentration of the purified membrane protein to 0.7 mg/mL by diluting it with the same extraction buffer used for protein isolation.\nMix 140 µL of the protein with 300 µL of preformed SUV, 160 µL buffer A, and 60 µL of 10% cholate in Buffer A; this gives 1:30 protein: lipid weight ratio in a final 660 µL volume.\nGently shake the mixture on a rocking platform for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The following steps can be done at room temperature.\nPass the mixture through gel-filtration resin, and collect turbid fractions containing proteoliposomes.\nPellet proteoliposomes with a table-top ultracentrifuge at 400,000 x g for 15 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant containing non-reconstituted protein, and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of fresh buffer A.\nDetermine the protein content in PL and the supernatant using the Amido-black method20.\nDetermine the yield of reconstitution, which typically is around 50-70%.\n\tNOTE: Steps 4.6-4.8 may optionally be replaced by passing PL solution through 1 mL of Ni-NTA resin packed into a disposable gravity column and washed with Buffer A as described in 3.1.2. Such passing will separate non-reconstituted protein, which will preferentially be bound to the resin, from PL, most of which will be in the flow-through.\n5. Functional Tests of Protein Activity in Proteoliposomes\nNOTE: Both proteins used in this study are powerful proton pumps, which pump H+ into proteoliposomes upon addition of their substrates (Coenzyme Q1 for bo3-oxidase, and ATP for F1Fo, respectively), thus building a proton gradient across the membrane (ΔpH). In case of successful co-reconstitution by fusion, such acidification can be observed as a decrease in fluorescence of a pH-sensitive probe ACMA (9-Amino-6-Chloro-2-Methoxyacridine)12,15, which is used routinely for such tasks (Figure 4B-C). Additionally substrate-specific activity of the proteins (Coenzyme Q1 oxidation by bo3-oxidase22 and ATP hydrolysis by F1Fo23,24) can be monitored spectrophotometrically using various methods. Here, we demonstrate ATP hydrolysis activity of F1Fo PL using an ATP regenerating assay (Figure 4D), where two enzymes (pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) maintain a constant concentration of ATP as follows. PK recycles ATP by converting ADP produced by F1Fo back into ATP at the expense of its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Pyruvate, which is a product of this reaction, is converted into lactate by LDH at the expense of NADH, the oxidation of which can be monitored as decreasing optical density at 340 nm.\nPreparation of chemicals\nPrepare 1 mM ACMA stock in ethanol.",
    "Prepare a 1 mM stock of nigericin (or any other uncoupler) in ethanol.\nPrepare 25 mM Coenzyme Q1 stock in ethanol, and 1 M DTT stock in buffer A.\nPrepare a stock of 100 mM ATP in Buffer A, and adjust its pH to 7.4.\nPrepare stocks of ATP regenerating system components in Buffer A: 100 mM PEP, 1 mM NADH, and solutions of PK and LDH at concentration of ~500-1,000 units/mL.\nCoenzyme Q1 oxidation-driven proton pumping by bo3-oxidase PL\nAdd 20 µL of PL to a fluorimeter cuvette with 2 mL buffer A in presence of 0.5 µM ACMA, and wait until stable signal using 430 nm excitation and 515 nm emission.\nAdd 40 µM Coenzyme Q1 to the cuvette.\nInitiate proton pumping by adding 2 mM DTT to PL (Figure 4B).\n\t\tNOTE: DTT reduces oxidized Coenzyme Q1 and makes it available to bo3-oxidase.\nDissipate formed ΔpH by adding 2 µM uncoupler (for example nigericin). ACMA fluorescence signal should quickly return to nearly the original level.\n\t\tNOTE: There should be no ACMA quenching upon addition of the substrate, if the uncoupler is present in the reaction mixture initially.\nATP hydrolysis-driven proton pumping by F1FoPL\nAdd 40 µL of PL to a fluorimeter cuvette as described in 5.2.\nInitiate proton pumping by adding 0.2 mM ATP to PL (Figure 4C).\nDissipate ΔpH as described in 5.2.4.\nATP hydrolysis by F1FoPL, and its stimulation by the uncoupler\nAdd 40 µL of PL to a spectrophotometer cuvette with 2 mL buffer A, containing 1 mM ATP, 0.2 mM NADH, 2 mM PEP, and 15 µL each of PK and LDH.",
    "Follow the reaction by measuring absorbance decrease of NADH at 340 nm. 3-4 min later, add 2 µM uncoupler to the cuvette to release the backpressure of ΔpH on ATP hydrolysis. The reaction speed should increase immediately.\n\t\tNOTE: PL passed through Ni-NTA resin as described in 4.10 will demonstrate the strongest stimulation by the uncoupler (Figure 4D, red trace), while the eluate will be barely stimulated (blue trace).\n6. Testing Influence of Lipid Environment and Ionic Strength on Functionality of Membrane Proteins in Fusogenic Proteoliposomes\nAssess proton pumping by 40 µL of PL+, PL- and PL0 with ACMA quenching assay in 2 mL buffer D supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2 and 20 (Figure 5, Panel A) or 100 mM KCl (Panel B) as described in 5.2 or 5.3 (Figure 5, red, black and blue traces).\nFuse 40 µL of PL+ with same volume of LUV- in 2 mL of buffer D supplemented with 20 mM KCl, and test for ACMA quenching (green trace).\nRun control experiments as in Step 2 by mixing, for example, PL and SUV of the same charge (grey trace).\n\tNOTE: Proton pumping should be improved by postfusion PL.\n7. Delivery of Membrane Proteins into LUV and GUV by Fusogenic Proteoliposomes\nFuse 50 µL of PL+ with 50 µL of 800 nm LUV- in 1 mL of buffer D supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM KCl for 5 min.\nPellet the vesicles at 6,000 x g for 5 min, and discard supernatant containing unreacted PL+. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of buffer D supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM KCl, and repeat pelleting and resuspending twice more.\nRun ACMA quenching assay as described in 5.2 or 5.4.",
    "Run control experiments, as in Steps 1-3, using combinations of complementary charged vesicles in high salt (200 mM KCl), non-fusogenic vesicles, and just empty LUV- without PL+.\n\tNOTE: Proton pumping by postfusion LUV should be detected only when complementarily charged vesicles were used as shown in Figure 6.\n8. Assembly of Electron Transport Chain from Individual Components in Membranes of LUV and GUV, and ATP Production by this Chain.\nNOTE: A schematic of this procedure is illustrated in Figure 7A. ATP produced in this experiment will be registered by the luciferin-luciferase system, where conversion of synthesized ATP into pyrophosphate and AMP by luciferase is followed by light emission registered with a luminometer. We recommend using a single-tube luminometer, instead of the less sensitive microplate luminometers.\nMix 3 µL of bo3-oxidase PL+ and 5 µL of F1Fo PL+ formed as described in Section 4.\nFuse them with 3 µL of LUV or GUV- (formed as described in Section 2) in 800 µL of buffer D supplemented with 20 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl2 for 5 min.\nUsing high concentration stocks, add KCl and MOPS to 100 mM and 50 mM final concentration to the postfusion membranes.\n\tNOTE: In case of post-fusion LUV, this step will prevent their swelling due to osmotic offset between the external (buffer A) and the intravesicular (buffer D) salts concentration.\n\t\nOptionally, pellet the postfusion membranes as described in 7.2 to separate unreacted SUV+, and resuspend the pellet in 800 µL of buffer A.\nPrepare 200 µL of a luciferin-luciferase-ADP cocktail containing 400 µM ADP, 50 µM luciferin, and 2.5 µg luciferase in buffer A\nAdd the cocktail to the postfusion mixture from Step8.3.",
    "Add 40 µM of oxidized Coenzyme Q1, and trigger energization of the postfusion membranes by bo3-oxidase by adding 2 mM DTT. Wait for 1 min.\nInitiate ATP synthesis by adding 5 mM potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 7.4) to energized vesicles, and detect ATP production with a luminometer (Figure 7B). Run the reaction for ~3 min.\n\tNOTE: ATP synthesis reaction proceeds for 5-7 min until depletion of oxygen consumed by bo3-oxidase and luciferase.\nAdd ATP reference standard (0.5 nmol ATP) to the reaction mixture twice. Measure ATP produced.\nObtain the actual amount of ATP produced in the reaction by dividing the signal from ATP synthesis reaction by the ATP reference standard signal. Adjust this value to the total amount of F1Fo used in the reaction, and finally express the rate of ATP synthesis in µmol ATP/(mg F1Fo*min)."
