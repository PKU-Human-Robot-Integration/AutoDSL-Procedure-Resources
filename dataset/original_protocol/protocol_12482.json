  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the Rhode Island College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhere to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Maze Configuration\nPlace clear, static, salient extra-maze cues (painted shapes, furniture or other stationary room features) around the maze.\n\tNote: Any extra-maze cues must remain in the same location for the duration of the experiment.\nPlace the hub and arms of the radial arm maze in a plastic tub (See equipment table for example).\n\tNote: The maze used in this protocol consists of eight removable stainless steel arms attached to eight central supports affixed to a circular stainless steel base which has been painted black (see Figure 1 for diagram and corresponding dimensions). The plastic tub exemplified in Figure 1 has an inner diameter of 122 cm and a height of 60 cm.\nFill the tub with water warmed to room temperature (22-26 °C)7.\nPlace platforms 1 cm below the water surface at the ends of four of the eight arms.\n\tNote 1: For each subject the platform locations are fixed for the duration of testing. Regardless of the configuration, care should be taken to avoid placement of the platforms in more than two adjacent arms (no more than two platforms should be located in adjacent arms). Do not place a platform in the starting arm.\n\tNote 2: The hidden platforms must be painted the same color as the maze insert to blend in with the maze background.\n2. Transferring Subjects for Testing\nTransfer subjects from the vivarium to the testing room maintaining the designated testing order.\n\tNote: Animals should be placed into an opaque cage to help reduce anticipatory stress and prevent viewing of testing room cues.",
    "Once in the testing room, place all of the opaque cages from group 1 onto a staging bench or table maintaining the testing order.\n\tNote: In a large study (e.g. 30 subjects) it may be best to break the subjects into testing groups (e.g. 3 groups of 10 subjects each). This will depend on the size of your testing room and the feasibility of subject transport.\n3. Digital Tablet Protocol for Recording Maze Arm Entries\nOpen a PDF writer program on the digital tablet.\nImport all presaved data recording templates for subjects in group 1.\n\tNote: Each recording template should be presaved and labeled with specific subject and trial numbers (e.g. subject 1_trial 1, subject 1_trial 2, etc.) with a total of four templates for each subject (trials 1-4). The template should have a blank representation of the maze and platform locations as well as a place to record the subject number, trial number, testing day, escape platform used and trial latency (see Figure 2).\nOpen the template for the first trial of your first subject.\n\tNote: This system can also be used with paper templates for researchers without access to tablets or tablet based note-taking programs.\n4. Radial Arm Water Maze Testing\nIf animals are pair housed, separate the subjects prior to the testing session. Transfer the first testing subject into a separate opaque warming cage.\n\tNote: The cage should be warmed to 37 °C using heating pad to maintain body temperature between testing trials.\nPrior to the first trial of each subject, confirm that the subject identification number matches the subject number on the data recording sheet and ensure that platforms are correctly positioned in the eight-arm water maze.\nPlace the subject into the start arm facing the wall of the maze and start the timer.",
    "Note: This protocol was designed for two experimenters, one to record the data and one to handle the subjects. During this collaboration, communication between the experimenters is paramount. Confirmation of start times, subject numbers, and proper platform placement prior to each trial is essential.\nRemain stationary during each trial in a designated position in the room to maintain cue consistency during each trial.\n\tNote: Care should be taken to avoid salient sent cues (e.g. perfumes) during the experiments and the experimenters should wear the same garments (lab coats) each day to maintain cue consistency.\nRecord each entry into an arm by placing a mark on the corresponding arm in the recording template on the digital tablet.\n\tNote: An entry occurs when a subject's shoulders break the opening plane of the arm.\nAllow a maximum of 120 sec for the subject to locate one of the four platforms. Once the animal reaches the platform, stop the timer, the trial is complete.\n\tNote: To maintain consistency, a subject is said to have reached the target when its front paws are on the platform.\nIf the subject is unable to locate the platform within 120 sec, carefully guide them to the closest platform and allow them to remain on the platform for 10 sec before removal to ensure that the animal is aware of the target location.\nOn day one only, allow the subject to sit on the platform for 10 sec following each of all four trials so the subject can reference the spatial cues.\nFollowing trial completion, remove the subject from the platform by gently lifting them by the body.\nBegin the timer for the 90 sec intertrial interval.\nPlace the subject back into the individual cage over the thermoregulation pad.",
    "Record the specific platform used for escape by circling the corresponding location on the data-recording template.\nDuring this interval remove the escape platform used by the subject in the previous trial.\nOpen the template for the next trial and mark all platform(s) that have been used for escape by the subject, and thus removed during previous trials, with an X.\n\tNote: Marking all missing platforms prior to a subsequent trial is critical for defining error types (e.g. reference memory and/or working memory correct).\nPrior to starting a subsequent trial, confirm the subject number, the trial number and the remaining platform locations.\nAfter the 90 sec intertrial interval has elapsed, place the subject into the start arm facing the wall of the maze and start the timer for the next trial.\nRepeat this process for trials 2-4, removing the escape platform reached after each trial and marking the template appropriately during and after each trial (i.e. place and X over removed platforms, indicate arms entered, and circle the platform used for escape).\nOnce all four trials for a subject have been completed, place the escape platforms back in the appropriate arms of the maze and repeat the testing process for the next subject (testing steps 4.1-4.17).\nOnce testing is completed for group 1, export the data recording sheets to a folder for that testing day (e.g. Day 1) and save it to a file storage system.\n\tNote: The data recording sheets should be exported prior to starting the next testing group to minimize the chance of data loss.\nRepeat for each group (testing steps 2.1-4.19).\n5. Dependent Variables",
    "For each trial, count the number of first and repeat entries into any arm that previously had a platform. This will be indicated by an X over the platform on the data recording sheet. These are the working memory correct errors.\n\tNote: Because working memory correct errors are dependent on remembering the location of a platform that has already been used for escape and avoiding that arm, you cannot have a working memory correct error on the first trial.\nFor each trial count the number of first entries into any arm that never contained a platform from the data recording sheet. These are reference memory errors.\nFor each trial count the number of repeat entries into any arm that never contained a platform from the data recording sheet. These are working memory incorrect errors.\nRecord the latency to reach the platform for each trial.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
