    "All methods were approved by the Comité d'éthique de l'expérimentation animale of the Recherche CIUSSS-NIM and are in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. See the Table of Materials for reagents, equipment, and materials used in this protocol.\n1. Surgery preparation\nPreparation of ECoG and EMG electrodes\n\t\nFor each animal, prepare three ECoG electrodes: using a soldering iron, place a small drop of lead-free solder on the screw cap of a gold-covered screw, and solder a 4 mm long, 0.2 mm diameter gold wire (non-insulated) on the top of the screw cap using the lead-free solder (Figure 1A). Prepare 2 electrodes with the gold wire straight up, and one with a 45° angle from the vertical.\nFor each animal, prepare two EMG electrodes: cut one 0.2 mm diameter gold wire to a length of 1.5 cm and a second one to 2 cm. Curve both wires for these to embrace the curve of the skull up to the neck muscles, keeping a straight end that will be soldered to the connector (Figure 1B).\nFor each animal, prepare one connector: use a 6-channel connector (5 mm x 8 mm x 8 mm + 3 mm metal pins), and add lead-free solder to 5 of the 6 metal pins (omitting one middle pin; Figure 1C). Cover the top of the connector with tape to avoid litter or water infiltration.\nPreparation of AAVs and syringe pump\n\t\nPrepare the test AAV (here, AAV9-CaMKIIα0.4-cofilinS3D-HA) and/or the control AAV (here, AAV9-CaMKIIα0.4-eGFP) by diluting the stock AAV mix(es) (here, AAVs in a solution of phosphate-buffered saline containing non-ionic surfactant [0.001%]) with sterile saline to obtain the desired viral titer (generally 1012-13 genome copies [GC]/mL) and the required volume for the number of mice to be treated.",
    "NOTE: An injected volume of 1 μL per cortical area per mouse requires the preparation of 2 μL.\nFix one 10 μL syringe to a syringe pump and fill it with distilled water.\nFill one PE50 tube of approximately 60-cm length with distilled water using a 1 mL syringe and a 21 G needle. Importantly, leave the 21G needle and syringe in place after filling. Connect the PE50 tube with the syringe pump; leave the 21 G needle/syringe on one end of the PE50 tube, and connect the other end to the 10 μL syringe.\nOnce the tube is fixed to the 10 μL syringe, remove the needle at the other end, and push the piston of the 10 μL syringe to fill the gap left by the needle with water.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure there is no air bubble, and that the tube is completely filled with water.\nInstall a 28 G cannula at the end of the tube where the needle was removed. Push water into the cannula with the 10 μL syringe to fill it completely. Fix the cannula tightly to the stereotaxic arm.\nPreparation of animals\n\tNOTE: C57BL6/J male and female mice of ~12 weeks of age were previously adapted for at least 2 weeks to housing in individual cages and to a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle with ad libitum food and water and access to a wooden cube.\n\t\nCarefully weigh the mice, and inject intraperitoneally a mix of ketamine/xylazine (120/10 mg/kg) for anesthesia. Wait approximately 10 min for deep anesthesia.\nShave the hair from the back of the ears to the front of the head between the eyes using a hair trimmer.",
    "NOTE: Be very careful not to cut the whiskers (protect the whiskers with a finger during shaving) as whisker trimming will modify sensory inputs and ECoG activity35,36.\nAdd a generous drop of ophthalmic ointment on each eye to prevent dehydration. Verify the depth of anesthesia regularly during the procedure by pinching a toe from the hind paw. Provide the mouse with 0.5-1.5% isoflurane to ensure deep anesthesia if a toe pinch reflex appears.\n2. Intracortical AAV injection with a syringe pump\nNOTE: Perform all the following steps with sterilized instruments and in a clean environment. Use 70% ethanol to further wash sterilized instruments and to wash electrodes prepared in section 1.1 as well as anchor screws (non-gold-covered screws) before beginning the surgery.\nCarefully fix the head of the mouse on the stereotaxic apparatus with ear bars.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the head is not moving laterally.\nGently pull the tongue of the animal out of the mouth to avoid suffocation, and fix the nose of the mouse with the stereotaxic adapter.\n\tNOTE: Monitor the breathing frequently during the procedure.\nSterilize the shaved area of the head with 70% ethanol and by holding the skin with an extra fine Graefe forceps, cut the skin from the base of the ears to the level of the eyes with tissue scissors. Use four surgical clamps to stretch the skin and expose the skull (two on each side of the incision; see Figure 1D).\nScratch the skull surface with a sharp scissor tip: while avoiding bone sutures, remove the periosteum and create overlapping streaks in two or more directions. Remove the bone fragments, and dry the skull with 70% ethanol.",
    "NOTE: The scratching and the streaking will help make the recording montage more robust by improving the adherence of the cement to the skull (see below).\nWith the cannula fixed to the stereotaxic arm, identify the location of the bregma (i.e., the intersection between the skull coronal and sagittal sutures; Figure 1D) and lambda (i.e., the intersection between the skull sagittal suture and a straight line connecting the left and right lambdoid suture; Figure 1D), and note the stereotaxic coordinates of each. If the difference between z coordinates (vertical axis) of the bregma and lambda is greater than 0.3 mm, adjust the height of the nose using the stereotaxic adapter until the z position of bregma and lambda are aligned.\nMark the position of the cannula on the skull with a pen at these coordinates (motor cortex): 1.5 mm lateral right to midline and 1.5 mm anterior to bregma. Carefully pierce the skull at the position of the cannula with a 0.7 mm drill bit in a direction perpendicular to the skull surface (aligned with the vertical axis). Wash the pierced skull with a sterile cotton tip impregnated with a 10% providone-iodine solution.\nLoad the cannula with a 1 μL air bubble by pulling the 10 μL syringe piston back by 1 μL. Load the test AAV (here AAV9-CaMKIIα0.4-CofilinS3D-HA) or the control AAV (here AAV9-CaMKIIα0.4-eGFP) into the cannula previously loaded with the air bubble: mix the AAV by slowly pipetting up and down, pipet 1.7 μL on a sterile Petri dish, and aspirate 1.5 μL of the solution in the cannula by slowly pulling the piston of the 10 μL syringe. Mark the position of the air bubble on the PE50 tube to allow the tracking of the injection.",
    "Align the cannula with the hole on the skull for the vertical position of the cannula to reach the upper edge of the skull (i.e., skull surface). From the skull surface, slowly lower the cannula by 1.5 mm (to reach 1.5 mm below skull surface and layer V of the motor cortex).\n\tNOTE: Be very careful not to lower the cannula too much to avoid unnecessary lesion of the brain tissue.\nStart the syringe pump to inject 1 µL of AAV over the course of 40 min (speed: 0.025 µL/min to minimize tissue damage). Keep track of the injection on the PE50 tube with the movement of the air bubble, and make adjustments if required.\nAfter the injection is completed, leave the cannula in place for 5 min to ensure sufficient diffusion and avoid backflow. Then, slowly and carefully lift the stereotaxic arm to remove the cannula from the cortex.\n3. ECoG/EMG electrode implantation\nUsing straight Kelly forceps, slowly screw one ECoG electrode (with straight gold-wire) in the vertical axis (same angle that the hole was pierced) in the hole where the AAV was injected. Leave at least 2.5 mm of the screw out of the skull to minimize damage to the dura and cerebral cortex (i.e., for an approximate depth of 1.1 mm from the skull surface; Figure 1D).",
    "Mark the position of the posterior ECoG electrode and the reference electrode on the skull with a pen at these coordinates: posterior electrode (visual cortex) 1.5 mm lateral right to midline and 1.5 mm anterior to lambda, reference electrode (somatosensory cortex) 2.6 mm lateral right to midline and 0.7 mm posterior to bregma. Also, mark the position of three maintenance screws (acting as anchors between the skull and dental cement to solidify head montage) on the left hemisphere with no specific coordinates, but as distant as possible from each other and from the ECoG electrodes.\nCarefully pierce the skull at the marked position of the other electrodes and anchor screws with the 0.7 mm drill bit. Pierce in a direction perpendicular to the skull surface for each screw (i.e., vertical axis for the posterior electrode but with an angle from the vertical axis for other sites). Wash the pierced skull with a 10% providone-iodine solution, and block the holes with small, rolled pieces of delicate task wipers before installing the screws to prevent bleeding and contamination.\nUsing the straight Kelly forceps, screw the maintenance screws in the left hemisphere and then screw the last two electrodes in the right hemisphere. Make sure to screw with the same angle that the holes were pierced and to leave at least 2.5 mm of each screw out of the skull (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: To maximize the solidity of the final montage and the quality of the electrophysiological signals, be careful not to touch any screw when installing the next one.",
    "Place a few small drops of dental cement in the center of the ring-like space inside the screws. Insert the curved end of one EMG electrode (prepared at step 1.1.2) approximately 1-2 mm in the neck muscles by holding the curved extremity using Dumont #5 forceps and lifting the skin above muscles with extra-fine Graefe forceps. Then, place the curved side and elbow of the electrode in the dental cement; repeat for the second EMG electrode.\n\tNOTE: The straight end of the longer EMG electrode should be aligned with the anterior ECoG electrode and that of the shorter EMG electrode with the posterior ECoG electrode. Make sure the two EMG electrodes are not touching each other or any of the screws.\nCover the eyes of the mice, and apply light for 3-5 min to help cement solidification. Once the EMG electrodes are holding firmly, cover the base of the ECoG electrodes and the base of the anchor screws with dental cement to form a crown-shaped contour. Cover the eyes of the mice, and apply light for 3-5 min to help cement solidification.\n\tNOTE: Do not apply cement on the ECoG and EMG electrode extremities (gold wire that will be soldered to the connector) or on the skin.\nFill the center of the montage with previously mixed acrylic cement. During cement solidification, remove the four surgical clamps holding the skin (and wash these immediately with delicate task wipers).\n\tNOTE: Do not apply cement on the ECoG and EMG electrode extremities (gold wire that will be soldered to the connector) or on the skin.\nSuture the skin at the back and the front of the montage so that the skull is not exposed (but avoid stretching the skin too much) using a suture needle (13 mm 3/8 c) and synthetic absorbable monofilament.",
    "Hold the connector above the montage with curved forceps, and carefully align the gold wire of electrodes with the connector pins. Solder electrode extremities to connector pins with the soldering iron.\n\tNOTE: Proceed quickly to avoid overheating and damage to the cortical tissue. Make sure that each electrode makes good contact with the corresponding connector pin, and that the electrodes are not connected to each other.\nRemove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame. Cover the empty space between the connector and the head with previously mixed acrylic cement by covering all connections between electrodes and connector pins.\n\tNOTE: Avoid cement infiltration inside the connector by holding the mouse with the connector above the head (head straight not leaning).\nWeigh the mouse and place it in a clean cage (preferably equipped with a non-meshed lid) on a heat pad (individual housing to avoid damage to the head montage). Monitor the animal regularly, and administer 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously upon awakening, and 12 h later if the animal shows signs of pain (e.g., abnormal posture, squinted eyes).\n\t​NOTE: Weight gain relative to pre-surgery weight should not exceed 1.5 g.\n4. Recordings\nHouse mice individually to avoid damage to the head montage as a result of mutual grooming as well as damage and entanglement of the recording cables.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, mice were housed with ad libitum access to food, water, and a wooden cube, and daily monitoring was conducted.\nConnect the mice to recording cables 2 weeks after surgery for adaptation to cabling conditions.\nRecord ECoG/EMG signals for 24 h (or longer/shorter depending on research questions).",
    "NOTE: ECoG/EMG signal recording was accomplished using a cable, a swivel connector (to allow rotation of the cable), a 36-channel wearable box, and an amplifier, which was connected to a computer. Signals are sampled at 256 Hz (or more depending on research questions) and recorded with commercial software (see the Table of Materials). To ensure sufficient viral expression, experiments should be done at least 3 weeks after AAV injection, as described previously29,37.\nAfter recording, sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation (or other methods depending on the immunostaining protocol), and harvest the brain for immunostaining."
