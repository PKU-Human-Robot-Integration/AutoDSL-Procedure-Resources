    "A schematized summary of the spontaneous metastasis assay is illustrated in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010032318_3479.jpgFigure 1. The chick embryo for spontaneous metastasis model. After 10 days of incubation the CAM is dropping and tumor cells (green) are applied to it. After allowing xenografted tumor cells to grow, the tumor and chicken tissues are harvested on day 5-7 for Alu PCR.Preparing the eggs for xenografting tumor cellsFreshly fertilized chicken eggs are incubated on their side in a rotating incubator at 37 °C and 60% humidity for 10 days. The eggs are rotated three times per hour (Figures 2.1 and 2.2)On day 10 the eggs are placed on their side on an egg rack (Figure 2.3). Use a tube lamp or other suitable light source to candle the eggs by shining the light at the blunt end of the egg where the air sack is located. The embryo must be located near the bottom of the egg and the air sack on its right. Localize and mark using a pencil the allantoic vein that is located at the top of the eggshell, right where several blood vessels cross (Figure 2.4). Clean the area, including and around the mark, using a cotton swab soaked with iodine (Figure 2.5).Drill a small hole through the eggshell into the air sack using a 30-gauge syringe needle (Figures 2.6 and 3A).Make another hole near the allantoic vein, which penetrates the shell membrane but not the CAM, using a Dremel rotary tool kit (Figures 2.7 and 3B). The CAM is attached to the inner surface of the shell, so care should be exercised at this point. Use a 20-gauge syringe needle with a small hook on the end to make a third very small hole in the eggshell membrane (Figure 3C, Note 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010032916_6181.jpgFigure 2.

Drill holes in the eggshell; 8. Drop the CAM; 9. Cut an opening for tumor cell grafting; 10. Apply the tumor cells and wait for 5 min; 11. Seal the hole using laboratory tape; 12. Incubate the eggs.To suction, create with an automatic pipette aid fitted with a piece of Tygon tubing placed against the hole in the airsac. To separate the CAM from the shell and let it drop, apply a mild vacuum to the hole over the air sack so the blood vessel drops down, away from the eggshell and attaches to the embryo (Figures 2.8 and 3D). Use a cut off wheel (Dremel) to cut a square window (1 cm2) approximately 0.5 cm away from the branch point in the vein to expose the underlying CAM. A pair of needle-nose forceps can be used to remove a small section of eggshell in the square window and expose the CAM (Figures 2.9 and 3E). Once the CAM is dropped, seal the hole located near the chorioallantoic vein using laboratory tape.Then place the eggs in an egg rack into a stationary incubator at 37 °C and 60% humidity in anticipation for grafting the tumor cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010033055_5379.jpgFigure 3.

Apply a mild vacuum into the hole over the air sack to evacuate the air and drop the CAM. E. Cut a square window (1 cm2) using a Dremel cut off wheel and remove a small section of eggshell to expose the CAM. F. Graft the tumor cells onto the CAM.Preparing tumor cells for graftingDetach tumor cells from their culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice in order to remove any residual media. Cells are counted using a Neubauer chamber and resuspended in serum-free DMEM at 40 million cells/ml depending on the cell line used (Note 2).Grafting the tumor cells onto the CAMUsing a 20-200 μl pipette place 25 μl of the cell suspension onto a small area of the CAM (Figures 2.10 and 3F). The optimal number of cells should be determined empirically, but can range from 0.4 x 105 to 2 x 106 depending on the growth and ‘invasiveness’ characteristics of the tumor cell line used. Different tumors and cell suspensions derived from tumors have been implanted on the CAM (Tables 1 and 2). Tumor cell lines grow and intravasate to the vasculature with different efficiencies. For instance, suspensions of A375 melanoma (1 x 106), SKMEL2 melanoma (1 x 106), RKO colorectal carcinoma (2 x 106), HCT116 (0.5 x 106), U87 glioblastoma (0.2 x 106), PC3 prostate carcinoma (1 x 106), Hep3 epidermoid carcinoma (0.4 x 106), HT-1080 fibrosarcom (0.5 x 106) cell lines; have been grafted on the CAM of embryonated chicken eggs.",
    "All cell lines tested formed 4-8 mm size tumors, which recapitulated hallmarks of corresponding human specimens. Depending on the tissue origin, number of tumor cells and their proliferation capacity, primary CAM tumors can reach up to 500-600 mg in 6-7 days after cell inoculation.Seal the window in the egg tightly with laboratory tape and leave the eggs in a position with the embryos standing upright for 5-10 min, in order to allow the cells to settle (Figure 2.11).After 10 min, return the eggs to the stationary incubator (Figure 2.12).Allow cells to grow for 5-7 days depending on the nature of the tumor cell line used. This time should be enough for a macroscopic tumor to be visible.The CAM model allow experimental studies of potential anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic compounds. Tumors can be treated topically on the upper CAM with potential anti-cancer drugs. For instance, to evaluate the effects of DEL22379 in A375 and RKO tumor growth we inoculated tumor cells on the CAM and incubate the embryos for 4 days at 37 °C and 60% humidity. Then, we added 10 µM DEL22379 (prepare freshly, soluble in DMSO) topically on the CAM and treatment was refreshed every 12 h. Two days later tumors were harvested.Table 1. Different tumor samples implanted onto the CAMimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010183031_9291.jpgTable 2 .Tumor cells tested onto the CAMimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010183125_8896.jpgWe describe the different steps for graft the tumor cells onto the CAM using the spontaneous metastasis model in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. The chick chorioallantoic membrane as an in vivo xenograft model to study tumor growth and metastasis Harvesting tumors and chick embryo tissuesPerform dissections in an area free of contaminating DNA (Figure 4.1). To detect metastatic invasion this assay quantifies the presence of ectopic DNA in chicken organs using a highly sensitive PCR approach.",
    "Therefore, it is very important to prevent contamination with exogenous DNA.In order not to have cross-contamination of your samples, use three separated sets of surgery tools. One set for cutting the egg, one set for harvesting the primary tumor and one set for removing the internal tissues.Prepare three wash containers for sequential rinsing of the tools between each animal and change their liquid between different experimental groups. Sequentially these washes are: distilled water, 70% ethanol and 1x PBS.Get the eggs from the stationary incubator.Open a new window removing some of the eggshell such that the tumors become visible. At this point, you can take some pictures of the appearance of the macroscopic tumor (Figures 4-6).Resect the primary tumor from the CAM and weigh the tumor.Remove the chick embryo from the eggshell by cutting the shell radially into equal halves. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010183453_5103.jpgFigure 4. Pictures showing tumor and chicken tissues harvest. 1. Perform dissection in a clean area. 2. Open a new window removing some of the eggshell and resect the primary tumor from the CAM. 3. Cut the eggshell radially into equal halves and harvest lower CAM. 4. Open the chick embryo cutting through the sternum and collect a piece of liver.Transfer the embryo to a clean weight boat. The animal must be dissected using a clean set of tools. Open the chick embryo cutting through the sternum. Once the embryo is open, collect a piece of the liver. To harvest the lung, cut the rib cage and separate from the breast.Harvested samples can be processed immediately for DNA isolation or stored at -80 °C for later extraction of DNA, if necessary.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010183701_1966.jpgFigure 5. Different tumors have been implanted on the CAM. Tumors were formed using 0.",
    "5 x 106 HCT116 colorectal cancer cells or 1 x 106 SKMEL2 melanoma cells during 5 and 7 days respectively.Genomic DNA isolationTo extract genomic DNA from tissues, we use the DNA kit from Qiagen. Purified DNA following manufactuer's instructions. DNA can be used immediately or stored at -20 °C. Dilute the DNA 1:50 or 1:25 to get 30 ng/µl in nuclease free water before using it for the PCR reaction. PCR analysisTo detect human tumor cell DNA in the chick tissues we use quantitative PCR for human Alu sequences using Alu-specific primers and SYBR green mix amplification kit. Prepare the reaction mix in a final volume of 10 μl, with 0.4 μM of each primer. Optimize the amount of template DNA empirically, we usually use 30 ng. Use chicken GAPDH primers as an internal control. The PCR is run under the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 sec, 63 °C for 30 sec, 72 °C for 30 sec. Generate a standard curve using a dilution series of human DNA (102, 103, 104) from the original tumor cells. Use this standard curve to quantify human tumor cells in a chick embryonic metastasis assay.Measure Ct values in triplicate and against the standard curve calculate the number of tumor cells in each CAM and liver sample.Invaded cells are detected using either 30 ng of 50 ng of total CAM DNA. Use water as a negative control.To evaluate results and statistical significance of control and experimental groups, use Graph Pad Prism software and Student t-test or ANOVA analysis (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171013/20171013021916_9009.jpgFigure 6. DEL 22379 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of cancer cells. Tumors were formed using 1 x 106 A375p melanoma cells (A) or 2 x 106 RKO colorectal cancer cells (B).",
    "Cells were applied to the CAM of day-10 embryos. Four days after applying the tumor cells half of the embryos were treated with DMSO and the other half with DEL22379 (10 µM). Two days later tumors were harvested to weigh. CAM and chick organs (lung) were harvested from embryos bearing tumors and subjected to quantitative Alu PCR. Conversely, quantitative PCR of chGAPDH was used as an internal control to confirm the presence of equivalent quantities of host genomic DNA. Data shows average ± SEM from 3 independent experiments. **P < 0.05; ***P < 0.005, by unpaired Student t-test (Herrero et al., 2015)."
