    "Cells were kept in matching medium at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in a humid environment (incubator) and passaged according to standard protocols.    Cells were seeded in culture plates or on cover slips of desired size (e.g. 24 well plates) the day before the experiment and used at 70-80% confluency. For infections, cells were kept in medium devoid of antibiotics for at least 24 h.   To obtain polarized TC7 cells the Biocoat Intestinal Epithelium Differentiation Environment was used according to the protocol provided by the producer.  To induce hemichannel opening with low extracellular Ca2+   Cells were carefully washed twice with warm (37 °C) HBSS and once with warm HBSS devoid of Ca2+. For polarized TC7 cells both the apical and the basolateral sides have to be washed with buffer (by carefully lifting the transwell chambers containing the cells with tweezers and substituting the buffer in the well). For negative controls, only HBSS was used.   Fresh warm HBSS devoid of Ca2+ was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C (e.g. in an incubator, a heated microscope or floating in a water bath). For polarized TC7 cells both the apical and the basolateral sides have exposed to HBSS devoid of Ca2+. For negative controls, HBSS was used.   Hemichannels can be closed again by exchanging HBSS devoid of Ca2+ with HBSS.    To induce hemichannel opening with Shigella   Cells were carefully washed twice with HBSS at RT just before infection. Cells are washed and kept at RT (rather than using warm buffer) to synchronize infection. Indeed, the activity of the type III secretion system (T3SS-the main virulence determinant in Shigella, Salmonella and EPEC) is temperature-dependent, for example in Shigella the T3SS is not active below 35 °C.",
    "Therefore, samples are shifted to 37 °C to trigger infection only after bacterial adhesion to the cell surface. Bacterial strains were conserved as glycerol stocks at -80 °C. Shigella was streaked out on soybean-casein digest agar containing 0.01% (w/v) Congo red and grown over-night at 37 °C to select virulent colonies (virulent colonies are red, colonies that have lost the virulence plasmid are whitish). A single colony was picked, grown over-night at 37 °C and 200 rpm in soybean-casein digest broth, with antibiotics if indicated, and a 200-fold dilution sub-cultured to OD600 nm = 0.3-0.5.   Bacteria were diluted in HBSS at RT, added to non-polarized cells at RT at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1: 5 (target cell: bacteria) and allowed to attach for 15 min. For polarized TC7 cells, bacteria were added on the apical side at an MOI of 1: 40.   HBSS was removed to eliminate non-adhered bacteria (in polarized cells the buffer has to be exchanged both on the apical and basolateral side to control the temperature), warm (37 °C) HBSS was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C (e.g. in an incubator or floating in a water bath) for the desired time (e.g. 15 min).    To induce hemichannel opening with Salmonella   Cells were carefully washed twice with HBSS at RT just before infection. Bacterial strains were conserved as glycerol stocks at -80 °C. Salmonella was streaked out on Luria-Bertani (LB)-agar to isolate colonies and grown overnight at 37 °C. The next evening a single colony was picked, grown overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm in LB-broth, with antibiotics if indicated.   Bacteria were diluted in HBSS at RT and added at RT (on the apical side for polarized TC7 cells) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1: 2.5 (target cell: bacteria).",
    "Cells were incubated at 37 °C (e.g. in an incubator or floating in a water bath) for the desired time (e.g. 2 min-infections with Salmonella proceed very quickly to bacterial adhesins).    To induce hemichannel opening with EPEC   Cells were carefully washed twice with HBSS at RT just before infection. Bacterial strains were conserved as glycerol stocks at -80 °C. EPEC was streaked out on Luria-Bertani (LB)-agar to isolate colonies and grown overnight at 37 °C. The next evening a single colony was picked, grown overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm in LB-broth, with antibiotics if indicated.   Bacteria were grown over night, diluted in HBSS at RT and added at RT (on the apical side for polarized TC7 cells) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1: 2.5 (target cell: bacteria).   Bacteria were centrifuged onto cells at 180 x g for 10 min at RT by spinning the culture plate in an appropriate centrifuge to promote their adhesion.    HBSS was removed to eliminate non-adhered bacteria (in polarized cells the buffer has to be exchanged both on the apical and basolateral side to control the temperature), warm (37 °C) HBSS was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C (e.g. in an incubator or floating in a water bath) for the desired time (e.g. 2 h-infections with EPEC proceed very slowly."
