    "Ethics Statement: Procedures and incentives involving human subjects have been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Texas Christian University.\n1. Participant Inclusion Factors and Recruitment\nExclude people who have sugar sensitivities or any other health condition, like diabetes or other conditions that impair glucoregulation, and that would preclude them from being able to safely consume a sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverage. Exclude participants with a body mass index (BMI) over 30, as obesity is associated with energy dysregulation31.\n\tNOTE: If any of the following behavioral dependent variables in the study involve food or beverage consumption, ensure that participants do not suffer from food allergies towards the food or beverages planned for use.\nSchedule participants several days in advance of the session. \n\tNOTE: Participant recruitment and session scheduling do not have to be done in person. These procedures can be performed by email contact or phone call.\n\t\nWhen scheduling a participant to do this study, ask the participant to abstain from consuming all food and non-water beverages for at least 8 hours before the scheduled session time32.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternately, many clinicians and researchers instead require an overnight fast for their standard fasting period for measuring blood glucose tolerance1.\nSchedule all participant sessions for a consistent time of day to help control for natural fluctuations in blood glucose that may occur as a result of diurnal variation rather than fasting.\n\t\tNOTE: Morning (between 8 and 11 am) is an ideal time to schedule sessions, as it increases compliance with the fasting procedure and minimizes participant discomfort (e.g. light headedness) from prolonged fasting.\nSchedule single participant sessions or group participant sessions, depending on how sensitive of a topic the dependent variable of choice reflects.",
    "NOTE: For example, if measuring eating behavior as the primary dependent variable, it may be more prudent to let a participant consume food privately rather than publicly because group presence and size are known to impact food consumption33,34. When using a lexical decision task or a survey-based dependent measure, it may be more pragmatic to run participants in small groups in semi-private, partitioned laboratory space.\nSend participants a reminder email 24 hr in advance of a scheduled appointment to remind participants of the scheduled session time and the fasting requirement.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that participants have a way to contact the researcher and cancel or reschedule without penalty, if needed. Please see Appendix A for a sample reminder email.\n2. Survey and Lexical Decision Task Programming\nSet up a survey that includes any questionnaire-based dependent variables, moderating variables, and mediating variables needed to test the hypothesis.\n\t\nBegin the survey with a consent form and end with a debriefing statement.\nCreate the survey using survey-building software35. Divide the full survey into enough separate survey portions to accommodate a break for participants to complete the lexical decision task.\n\t\tNOTE: The current research survey was programmed into two halves using a survey building software. To do this, two separate surveys were built and then later linked together by a batch file. The first half contains steps 2.1.3.1-2.1.3.6. The second survey contains step 2.1.4. Participants completed the lexical decision task during the gap between the two survey halves.\nCreate the first survey half so that it contains the consent document and the items described in steps 2.1.3.1-2.1.3.6.\n\t\tNOTE: If collecting blood glucose data, some research institutions may require that researchers also include a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) form for participants to sign to authorize the recording of any blood glucose readings.",
    "Create a page near the beginning of the survey half that assesses how long the participant has fasted, and how hungry the participant is feeling.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Please see Appendix B for exact questions and scale-points used in the authors' research.\nInsert a \"stop\" instruction that tells participants to stop and contact the experimenter to start the next portion of the survey.\n\t\t\tNOTE: See Appendix C for sample set of stop instructions.\nProgram the beverage consumption task. To do this, first program a set of instructions for consuming the beverage. Follow the instructions by including a 2 min neutral filler observational task that participants can observe during the two minute beverage consumption period. Program into this task a 30 sec warning indicating that participants have 30 sec left to finish the drink.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the current research, authors programmed a block in their survey that automatically advanced pictures taken by the Hubble Telescope for 1 min and 30 seconds (see Appendix D for exact coding and how to implement it). This was followed by a 30 sec warning indicating to participants that there were 30 sec left to finish their drink.\nCreate a page in the survey to be completed after the two minute drinking procedure that prompts the participant to rate the beverage for (a) pleasantness, (b) liking of the beverage and (c) desirability as a future product for purchase. (See Appendix B for exact questions and scale-points).\nCreate a 10 min neutral filler task that participants will complete after consuming and evaluating the beverage.",
    "NOTE: The purpose of this 10 min neutral filler task is to allow enough time to pass for blood glucose changes to occur. Thus, the specific content that comprises the task is up to the experimenter to choose. In the current research, participants were asked to name as many brand names of office products, household cleaning products, and school supplies that they could think of in 3 min intervals (with additional 1 minute programmed to include instructions), in keeping with the consumer product testing ruse. The same JavaScript coding used for the blood glucose manipulation task was used to program open answer response blocks to appear for exactly 3 min (Appendix C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If concerned about participant fatigue due to the filler task, another slideshow presenting pictures of a neutral subject (which does not require word generation) could be substituted for a more active task (such as the brand name generation task mentioned above).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Alternately, if interested in measuring cognitive function, per se, the task can be modified to be more cognitively demanding if desired; given that research using various cognitive paradigms has revealed that blood glucose fluctuations may facilitate certain types of cognition under conditions of high load1,10,36.\nIf measuring post-manipulation blood glucose, program stop instructions for a second, post-manipulation reading immediately after the end of the neutral filler task to allow the implementation of the blood glucose assessment protocol.\nCreate a second survey half that contains all the questions that will go after the lexical decision task, as well as a debriefing statement where participants are informed of any deception (e.g. in the current line of research: the consumer product testing ruse).",
    "NOTE: In the current line of research, this portion asked participants to report on various sociodemographic factors, such as: age, height, weight, and socioeconomic status Optionally, including a measure of mood in this portion will allow for the ability to control for differences in cognitive accessibility that may result from changes in mood14.\nProgram the lexical decision task as a computer task using behavioral task-building software37 that is able to record reaction times down to the millisecond.\n\tNOTE: The coding details used to program this task will vary depending on the software that is used to execute the lexical decision task. Please see Appendix E for a sample coding template for the authors' task-building software of choice, and sample lists of words and non-words to program into task20.\n\t\nProgram the letter string words/non-words in the lexical decision task to appear in random order and not repeat by manipulating the portions of the coding labeled \"block\" and \"trial\" in the behavioral task building software.\n\t\tNOTE: Randomizing will help to control for any potential priming effects upon participants' behaviors from seeing a specific order of word/non-word letter strings. See the sample template in Appendix E for the exact code for that can be used to randomize letter string order.",
    "NOTE: In the current research, the authors programmed each letter string to show on the computer screen for 250 ms. The task was programmed so that participants indicate whether each letter string was a word or non-word by pressing the \"z\" or \"m\" keys on the keyboard, respectively. This task was also programmed so that there was a practice trial where participants categorized 15 neutral valence words and 15 non-word letter strings to gain familiarity with the task. The stimulus presentation time, response key, and task length can all be easily manipulated by altering the template code included in Appendix E.\nIntegrate the surveys and lexical decision task.\n\tNOTE: One way to integrate computerized surveys with computerized behavior tasks is to progra a batch file in a notepad application, saving it as a .bat file. This method helps to reduce procedural awkwardness by eliminating the need for an experimenter to open each survey portion and the lexical decision task manually. Please see Appendix F for sample batch file code used in the authors' current research.\n\t\nIf running the survey on a computer, ensure that upon opening the batch file an internet browser (or survey software program) opens and directs to the hyperlink containing the first survey half.\nProgram the batch file to automatically open the lexical decision task upon the close of first survey.\nProgram the batch file to automatically open an internet browser that directs to the last survey half upon completion of the lexical decision task.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample batch file in Appendix F provides the code to execute steps 2.3.1-2.3.3.\n3. Day of Study Setup",
    "Before participants arrive to the laboratory, assign each scheduled participant a unique ID number (e.g. \"101, 102\"…) using a participant log. Write each participant ID number being used in a session on an individual sticky note.\n\tNOTE: Give a sticky note to the participant when the participant enters the experiment room and enter the number into the computerized survey. Later use the participant's number to link the data from all survey parts and tasks.\nRandomly assign each scheduled participant into a drink manipulation condition prior to their arrival in the lab. Pour each participant's chilled drink into an opaque disposable cup labeled with that participant's participant ID number.Pour all drinks before the session while the room is empty of any participants, so that participants are blind to the type of drink that was assigned.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the experimenter (or research assistant) is blind to the hypothesis of the experiment. To make the procedure fully double-blind, add a second research assistant to the procedure. The research assistant will pour the drinks, number the cups, and then hand the drinks to the experimenter, who then distributes them to participants.\n\t\nRecord the participants' drink condition next to the corresponding participant ID number in the participant log.\n\t\t\nTo test the unique effects produced by non-caloric sweeteners relative to naturally sweetened drinks, ask each participant to drink either a \"sugar sweetened\" lime soda beverage, \"zero-calorie sweetened\" lime soda beverage, or a \"non-sweetened\" lime flavored sparkling water beverage.\nTo test the contrasting effects of high energy need versus low energy need, ask each participant to drink either a \"sugar sweetened\" lime soda beverage or \"plain spring water\".\n\t\t\tNOTE: Participants should be given 12 oz of the assigned drink (approximately one can).",
    "NOTE: In the authors' prior research, \"seltzer water\"20,38 has also been used instead of spring water to control for differences in palatability that might occur from having carbonated drinks presented versus plain water.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If consistency of drink constituency poses a concern to the readers' research, non-carbonated drinks can be used3. To do so, in the experimental condition mix 25 grams of pure glucose into water. In the non-caloric sweetener condition mix an equivalent amount of non-caloric sweetener (such as aspartame or saccharin) into water1,2. Sugar free squash pulp can be mixed to drinks in these conditions for improved palatability.\nPrepare the computerized surveys for administration. On the computer, open the study folder, double-click on the batch file icon and select run to open the survey.\n\tNOTE: If unable to run the survey on a computer and the survey is in paper format, write the participant ID on top of all forms.\nIf measuring blood glucose using a glucometer, gather blood testing strips (1 per reading), lancets (1 per reading), a glucometer, and a participant log with a spot built in to record readings.\n\t\nHave Band-Aids, hand sanitizer, medical-grade exam gloves, and sterilizing wipes present and ready for clean-up after the reading.\n4. Protocol for Running Participants Through the Study\nBring participants into the lab. Give brief introduction to the study purpose. Distribute a consent form (digital, or on paper) for participants to sign before starting the experiment. Once consent is given, hand the participant the sticky note containing the appropriate, assigned participant ID number.",
    "NOTE: It is ok to use some deception (e.g. a cover story) when initially explaining the study purpose to participants if telling them the true purpose will affect participants' survey and task responses. If deception is used, it is required to inform participants of the true study purpose upon debriefing.\nIf taking pre-manipulation blood glucose readings, guide participant to a sterile spot away from the survey. Wear exam gloves to minimize any chance of exposure to blood while taking blood glucose readings. Clean the participant's finger with a sterile wipe prior to reading blood glucose.\n\t\nUsing lancet (or lancet tipped blood testing strip), gently prick the side of participant's index finger. Squeeze a small amount of blood onto blood testing strip and insert into glucometer.\nWrite down the corresponding blood glucose reading and time the blood glucose reading is taken in the participant log. Wipe down the area with a sterilizing wipe.\nOffer the participant hand sanitizer and a tissue to clean their finger. Provide a small, adhesive bandage if the participant desires to cover their finger.\nDirect all participants to take a seat at the computer terminal where their drink and survey are located.\n\t\nInstruct each participant to place the sticky note with the participant ID number on the desk next to the computer where it is visible to both the researcher and the participant.\n\t\t\nInstruct the participant to type in the participant ID number on the sticky note when prompted at the beginning of the survey to ensure later ability to link survey responses to the participant's drink condition.\nInstruct participants to complete a consumer evaluation task, and as a consequence, consume a brand blind beverage.",
    "Hand the participant the cup containing the participant's assigned experimental drink. Double check that the cup matches the assigned condition and participant number recorded on the participant log.\nTell participants that the computer will prompt them to consume the entire beverage in two minutes and that this will be followed by a survey.\nAsk the participant to take the cup and begin to drink the beverage. At this time, click the next arrow on the survey page to begin the timed beverage consumption task.\n\t\tNOTE: The 2 minute timing can be performed manually by the researcher using a stopwatch, or can be programmed into a computer survey using JavaScript programming language (see Appendix C), such that upon clicking a \"begin button\" the survey will not progress until two minutes have passed and it has instructed the participant to finish the beverage and inform the researcher to come collect the cup.\n\t\t\nAfter the two minute period has elapsed, participants will be instructed by the computer to begin a survey on their impressions of the drink by clicking the \"begin\" button.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Participants will first be asked about their impressions of the drink to buttress the cover story. This brief survey is immediately followed by a 10 min neutral filler task to allow time for changes for blood glucose to occur16.\nCollect all used beverage cups from the participants' workspaces but do not throw away.\nNote in the experimental log next to a participant's ID number if a participant did not finish the entire beverage.\nIf recording blood glucose, immediately take another blood glucose reading at conclusion of the 10 min filler task before proceeding to the lexical decision task. Repeat steps 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3.",
    "NOTE: It is important to record both the time of first and second blood glucose readings, because there is always some small amount of variation in the time between readings across participants, due to differences in the time it takes to finish portions of the survey. Recording the time of readings allows the researcher the option of controlling for time between readings by entering it as a covariate in later statistical analyses.\nUpon completion of the 10 min filler task and blood glucose reading, submit and close the survey.\n\tNOTE: Allow the batch file to automatically open the behavioral task by ensuring that the internet browser running the survey is completely closed once the survey is submitted (e.g. do not simply minimize the window), and then verify that the batch file has successfully opened the behavioral task software by checking to see if a window prompting the participant to enter the participant ID number has appeared.\n5. Protocol for Running the Participant Through the Lexical Decision Task\nDouble click and open the software to run the task. Enter the participant's ID number into the participant ID prompt given by the behavioral task software and initiate the programmed lexical decision task by clicking the \"run\" button on the prompt window.\nBriefly describe the lexical decision task to the participant by verbal instruction or by including an instructions page at the beginning of the computerized task.\nAllow the participant time to complete the lexical decision task on the computer and instruct the participant to notify the researcher when the task is finished.\n\tNOTE: It typically takes participants approximately 3-4 min to complete the lexical decision task.",
    "After finishing the task, close the lexical decision task out fully by hitting spacebar, and ensure that the batch file opens the final survey portion that contains the sociodemographic and debriefing questions outlined in step 2.1.4.\nAt the conclusion of the entire study, debrief the participant. Give the participant the agreed upon compensation for participation and release them from the session.\nIf the participant did not finish the drink during the beverage consumption task, use a measuring cup at the end of the experimental session to measure and then record how much of the beverage is left, in fluid ounces, in the participant log.\nFlag the data for any participant who did not finish the assigned drink, and for participants who presented a fasting blood glucose level of higher than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).\n\tNOTE: Discarding participants' data for those that pass this blood glucose threshold is recommended because a fasting blood glucose level higher than 100 mg/dl is considered to be a marker of impaired glucose processing/prediabetes39. Heightened blood glucose at the first reading may also be an indicator that a participant did not comply with the pre-session fasting instructions and ate something prior to session.\n6. Scoring the Results and Preparing the Data for Analysis\nUsing the participant's ID number, match the participant's hand recorded log data (e.g. blood glucose readings, drink condition, amount of drink left if any, and any noted study session problems) with the participant's survey data and the computerized lexical decision task data.\nImport all data (log, survey, and lexical decision task) into a single dataset in any statistical analysis software format of choice40. Discard any flagged session data.",
    "Accomplish this either by entering data manually into a computerized spreadsheet and importing it into the statistical analysis software, or by entering it directly into a file format that is supported by the statistical software.\nCode and trim reaction time data from the lexical decision task, as outliers are known to distort reaction time data24,29.\n\t\nTrim reaction time data by either deleting any individual responses that fall outside the a priori determined cut-off latency, or by recoding all responses in a single word category into a new trimmed variable that does not include responses outside of the a priori cut-off window.\n\t\tNOTE: The authors suggest adopting the following a priori standards to trimming reaction time data: eliminating single item responses that are shorter than 100 msec and longer than 1,000 msec, and eliminating incorrect responses30.\nUsing the trimmed response latencies, create all dependent variables needed to answer the experimental hypothesis24,29.\n\t\nCreate mean reaction time composites for all correct responses in each word category that was included in the lexical decision task (e.g. high fat words, low fat words, non-words). Create sum composites of total number of correct responses for each word category24,29,30.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
