  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: This protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at UT Southwestern Medical Center which abides by the National Institutes for Health (NIH) policy for experimental animal usage.\n1. Repetitive Hypoxic Preconditioning\nCustom design four flowmeters on gas regulators and attach to standard 15 L induction chambers with PVC tubes to allow compressed gas from the oxygen (O2) tanks to flow into the chambers via an inlet port. See Equipment and Materials for more details about custom design.\nDivide mice into 2 groups: Repetitive Hypoxic Preconditioning (RHP) Group, which receive exposures to 8% and 11% O2, and the Control Group, which receive exposures to 21% O2 (room air) concurrently. See Table 1 for the variations in frequency, intensity (8 and 11% O2 or 21% O2), and duration (2 or 4 hr) of RHP exposures.\nRemove the top filter lid of each cage and place the cage, with food and water bottles intact, in the chambers connected to their respective O2 tanks. Close and secure the lid of the chamber.\n\t\nOpen the main gas valve for the tanks and set the initial flow for each induction chamber to 2 L per min (LPM) for the first 5 mins of exposure. Reduce the flow rate to 1 LPM for the remainder of the exposure.\nAt the end of the exposure, reduce the flow to to 0 LPM and close the gas valve for the tanks.\nOpen the chamber lids and replace the filter top lid on each cage. Place the cages in standard housing until the next hypoxic exposure.\nSpray down each induction chamber with NPD (Steris) or an equivalent disinfectant/deodorizer after each use.\nExpose both 21% and RHP mice at the same time of day over the course of two weeks as described in Table 1.",
    "2. Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (tMCAo)\nSee Discussion for more details on the timing of stroke following final RHP exposure.\nPrepare an aseptic surgery workplace. Clean surrounding workplace with 70% Ethanol or an equivalent disinfectant and autoclave all surgical tools.\n\t\nSet up the Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) instrument to measure relative changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Turn on the heating pad to 37 °C. Turn on the incubator to 34 °C.\nAnesthetize mice with a brief exposure to a mix of 4% isoflurane/70% NO2/30% O2 in a small induction chamber. Confirm proper anesthesia by lightly pinching the paw. If the mouse withdraws its paw, return the mouse to the induction chamber and continue isoflurane exposure.\nRemove mice from the anesthesia induction chamber and quickly insert the mouse’s nose in the nose cone. Open the gas flow to the nose cone, closing off flow to the anesthesia induction chamber.\n\t\nWithout changing the 70% NO2/30% O2 gas mixture, fix isoflurane at 1.8% as the maintenance dose for the remainder of the procedure. Breathing should remain slow and regular throughout the procedure but if breathing becomes rapid and shallow, increase the isoflurane dose. Maintenance dose may vary between equipment manufacture and animal used in the experiment.\nUsing a microshaver, shave the hair on the temporal region between the corner of the eye and the ear as well as ventral midline of the neck. Remove excess fur and apply ocular lubricant with a sterile cotton swab to keep the corneas from drying out during the procedure. Wipe down incision area with alcohol pads and swab providone-iodine with a sterile cotton swab to maintain aseptic conditions.\nAdminister analgesics according to rodent surgical guidelines.",
    "Make an incision through the temporal skin between the eye and the ear. Expose the temporalis muscle. Using surgical micro-scissors, cut the temporal muscle ligament at the temporal ridge within the area of white muscle striation.\n\t\nGently push the muscle bulk laterally with forceps to visualize the middle cerebral artery (MCA) through the skull. After incision of the temporal muscle, the area may fill with blood. Gently use a cotton swab to staunch any potential bleeding.\nTarget the the LDF probe tip to the MCA area. Record the vessel chosen as this area varies between mice.\nHold the LDF in place and flush with the skull until a stable red blood cell flux is read and record this value as the baseline CBF. Ideal baseline CBF on a Laser Doppler Flowmetry are >600 flux, but this will vary with manufacturer. If baseline CBF is <400 flux, the flow recording is most likely from a nearby vein, or an incomplete placement of the probe over the target vessel.\nAfter baseline CBF is established, reposition the mouse so that the neck is exposed. Support its head and keep the mouse under steady anesthesia from the nosecone.\nMake a ventral midline incision from just below the mandible to the clavicle.\n\t\nUsing forceps, blunt dissect all superficial fascia to expose the left common carotid artery (CCA). Separate the CCA from connective tissue and the vagus nerve.\nPermanently ligate the CCA with a 6.0 silk suture. Place the ligating suture as proximal as possible to allow enough room for occluding filament placement.\nLoop and loosely tie a second silk 6.0 suture around the CCA distal to the occluding suture. Be careful not to occlude the artery as the occluding filament will subsequently be threaded through the carotid.",
    "Use an 8 x 2 mm light micro serrafine areterial clamp to clamp the CCA distal to the loosely-tied silk suture. Gently lift the CCA with forceps and make a small longitudinal incision, as proximal to the ligating suture as possible with 3 mm vannas.\nThread a 12 mm silicon-coated 6.0 gauge nylon occluding filament through the incision to enter the artery lumen, and then advance it a few mm. Loosely tighten the second loose silk suture around the tip of the occluding filament to ensure blood flow does not push the filament out of the CCA and remove the arterial clamp.\nAt the first bifurcation of the CCA into the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the external carotid artery (ECA), thread the occluding filament into the right branch of the first bifurcation to enter the ICA.Advance the occluding filament 9 to 10.5 mm past the second silk suture into the left internal carotid artery (ICA).\nShortly after entering the ICA, advance the occluding filament into the left branch at the second bifurcation between the ICA and the pterogopalantine artery (PPA). Visualization of the PPA is unlikely so proceed until you feel a mild resistance with full placement of the occluding filament. Lifting the ICA with forceps may help the filament to thread more easily into the left branch of the second birfurcation. Tighten the second silk suture.\nTurn the mouse so the incision over the MCA is visible. With the LDF equipment, confirm that the CBF is blocked through LDF readings. A successful occlusion is a >80% reduction from baseline CBF.",
    "Completely tighten and double-knot the second silk suture around the occluding filament when the proper position is achieved. If necessary, slightly push in or pull out the occluding filament to achieve CBF criteria for a successful occlusion (e.g. >80% reduction from baseline CBF).\nClose the neck and head opening with 6.0 nylon sutures.\nPlace mice in the 34 °C incubator for the duration of the occlusion. Recommended length of occlusion is 60 min, but this varies for age, strain-dependent differences in cerebrovascular anatomy,25 and the extent of injury desired (mild, moderate, severe). Make sure that animals regain consciousness within mins of coming off anesthesia.\nRe-anesthetize the animals with isoflurane, as described in step 2.3, 5 min before the end of the pre-defined occlusion period, open the scalp incision and confirm that the MCA perfusion is still reduced using transcranial LDF readings. If CBF is not sufficiently reduced (e.g. <20% baseline CBF), the MCA has reperfused at some point during the occlusion and the mouse should be excluded from further experimentation.\nOpen the midline neck incision and loosely tie a third silk suture around the CCA, distal to the second silk suture but proximal to the CCA bifurcation to ensure that the external carotid artery (ECA) will remain viable after the filament is removed.\n\t\nCut or untie the knot that holds the occluding filament (i.e., second silk suture) and withdraw the occluding filament slowly. Once removed, quickly close the third silk suture around the CCA to minimize backflow of blood from the ICA. Double-knot this suture and close the incision with 6.0 nylon sutures.",
    "Reposition the mouse to quantify the level of CBF after 5 min of reperfusion. Successful reperfusion is generally defined as a CBF of >50% of baseline CBF, but, as with occlusion flow, investigators can establish their own criterion. If animals exhibit a CBF below 50% of their baseline, it is likely the MCA is ‘permanently’ occluded, and thus represents another study exclusion criterion.\nClose both incisions with 6.0 nylon sutures. Provide saline, anesthetic (Lidocaine), and antibiotics according to rodent guidelines. However some small doses of antibiotics (3 mg/kg of minocycline) have been found to be neuroprotective following stroke.26\nAfter regaining consciousness in the heated incubator following surgery, place mice in a clean, sterile cage. Provide moistened food or nutritional hydration dietary gel supplements and a petri dish of water as the animals will have restricted mobility following stroke. Monitor animals closely during recovery for excessive post-surgical pain and death.\n3. Evans Blue (EB) Injection\nInject EB 22 hr after reperfusion and should circulate in the bloodstream for 2 hr prior to sacrifice and TTC staining.\nMake an EB solution for injection (2% EB in saline) and gently mix at room temperature. Filter solution through filter paper or push through a 0.2 µm filter attached to a small syringe to remove undissolved EB and store at room temperature.\nPrepare the amount of EB needed for injection (4 ml/kg of body weight) Draw the desired amount of dye into a 0.3 cc insulin syringe with a 29 gauge needle and ensure that the solution is at room temperature\n\t\nRestrain mouse using flat bottom restrainer. Hold the tail so that the lateral vein is uppermost. Lateral veins are located on either side of the centerline of the tail. Hold the tip of the tail to keep the mouse steady for injection.",
    "Insert the needle into the vein approximately 3.5 mm, being careful not to perforate the vein. Confirm that the needle is in the vein by drawing back on the syringe and looking for traces of blood.\nInject all of the dye over the course of 1 min. If the solution is going into the vein there should be minimal resistance as pressure is applied to the syringe. Confirm successful systemic venous administration of EB by an immediate color change in the tail, limbs, and eyes of the mouse.\nRemove the needle from the tail and gently apply pressure using clean gauze in order to stop bleeding.\nBegin timing when the mouse’s skin turns blue. Allow the EB to circulate for 2 hr to penetrate the weakened BBB.\n4. 2,3,5- Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining\nPerfusion and TTC staining should occur 24 hr after reperfusion.\nPrepare a 2% TTC solution prior to the designated time of sacrifice. Add 10 g of TTC powder to 500 ml of 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Heat solution to 37 °C in water bath to facilitate solubilizing of the TTC. CAUTION: TTC powder and solution are a skin, lung, and eye irritant. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment when handling these materials.\n\t\nOnce the powder has completely dissolved, immediately transfer to a bottle, cover in foil, and store at 4 °C. TTC and tissue stained with TTC are light sensitive.\nAt 24 hr after tMCAo and 2 hr after EB administration, sacrifice the animal with an isoflurane overdose in a small induction chamber. Perfusion should begin immediately following sacricice in order to minimize autolysis which begins in the absence of oxygen following death.",
    "Quickly secure the animal on a Styrofoam platform with forearms pinned through the paws. Cut a lateral incision through the abdominal wall from the midline just below the ribcage. Carefully cut through the diaphragm to expose the heart.\n\t\nStart the perfusion pump at 5 ml/min flow rate with a 60 cc syringe filled with ice cold 0.01 M PBS and connected to a 27 guage winged infusion needle. Place the tip of the needle about 0.5 cm into the left ventricle of the heart and cut the right atrium. Progressively diluted venous blood should flow out of the atrium during the perfusion until venous blood appears colorless. Transcardially perfuse 30 ml 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) through the heart.\nAdd 5 ml of TTC solution into transparent 20 scintillation bottles.\nImmediately following perfusion, decapitate the animals and dissect out the brains using small scissors and a spatula if necessary. Examine the brains to exclude animals which underwent subarachnoid hemorrhage at the Circle of Willis, secondary to suture placement. Check that the hemisphere contralateral to the occluded MCA appears pale, without noticeable EB leakage or edema.\nPour PBS into an acrylic brain matrix designed to make 1.0 mm thick coronal sections of a mouse brain. Place the brain, dorsal side up, into the matrix and immediately pour PBS over the brain. Keep the brain moist.\n\t\nRemove the olfactory bulbs by inserting a stainless steel 0.21 mm thick blade into the second slot from the rostral side of the matrix.\nRemove the cerebellum by inserting a blade in the fourth slot from the caudal side of the matrix.",
    "Insert a blade into the middle slot of the remaining slots in the matrix. Insert the remaining blades, evenly bisecting the remaining tissue to ensure the most even distribution of tissue during the slicing.\nOnce all blades have been inserted, add 1 to 2 drops of PBS to the brain to moisten it.\nRemove the blades one at a time from the matrix beginning with the rostral region. Keep the first 7 slices for TTC analysis after tMCAo. Use a small spatula to carefully transfer the slices from the blade to the TTC-filled vial.\nAfter all sections are in the vial, cap it and place in a warm water bath until the sections turn pink. Gently turn the bottle in the bath if necessary to avoid section overlap, which could lead to uneven staining. Then dispose of the TTC and pour a 4% paraformaldehyde solution into the vial to cover brain sections to terminate the TTC chemical reaction.\nImmediately arrange the sections on a clean 1\" x 3” glass slide and orient the sections from rostral to caudal.\n\t\nWhen the sections are arranged on the slide, scan the slide using a standard scanner. Set the resolution at a minimum of 600 dpi for image analysis. Be sure to include the name of the animal and a metric ruler in the scanned image.\nFlip over the slide and scan the back side to ensure all data is collected.\n5. Infarct Volume Quantification\nQuantify the infarct volume by using a standard image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ).\nScan images at a high resolution (e.g. 600 dpi) for adequate analysis. Crop images. Standardize the scale for all images using the metric ruler included in the scanned image.",
    "Calculate the total volume of the contralateral hemisphere using the following formula. Repeat this formula to calculate the total volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere.\n\tSum of total contralateral hemisphere of each slice x slice thickness\nCalculate the indirect infarct volume. Control for ipsilateral edema from stroke by using the healthy, contralateral hemisphere as a control.27 Use the following formula to calculate the indirect infarct volume:\n\tTotal volume of contralateral hemisphere -\n\t(Total volume of ipsilateral hemisphere –Average volume of 3 measurements of infarct)\n6. Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) Integrity Quantification\nTo prepare for EB quantification, first weigh 2.5 inch weigh boats. Record the weight and label two weigh boats for each animal: one for the ipsilateral hemisphere and one for the contralateral hemisphere.\nAfter scanning the TTC-stained sections, bisect each section with a disposable razor blade into ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Place the ipsilateral hemispheres from all 7 sections in a weigh boat and record the weight. Repeat for contralateral hemisphere.\nImmediately transfer the weight boats to an oven set for 56 °C for 48 hr.\nWeigh the dried sections. Transfer both hemispheres into separate 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n\t\nCalculate the amount of formamide needed for each hemisphere (8 ml/g of dry tissue), and add to their respective microcentrifuge tubes. Formamide is light sensitive and cover all formamide-treated samples in foil from this point onward.\nTransfer the microcentrifuge tubes to an incubator set to 56 °C for another 48 hr.\nAfter the 48 hr, pipette out the blue supernatant into another set of labeled microcentrifuge tubes. Push tissue to the bottom of the tube to maximize the volume of extracted supernatant. Keep the tubes of supernatant and dispose of all tissue.",
    "Prepare exponential serial dilutions of EB in formamide for the standard curve. Include 1 blank (formamide only) and then 10 exponential solutions from 0.125 ug/ml through 64 ug/ml of EB in formamide.\n\t\nPipette 300 µl of the dilutions made for the standard curve into a 96-well plate. Pipette 300 µl of the supernatant into corresponding wells.\nMeasure the absorbance on a spectrophotometer at 620 nm.\nCompare the standard curve of the EB dilutions with the absorbance of the supernatant samples. The optical density is directly proportional to the integrity of the BBB.\nAssume the optical density of the contralateral hemisphere as background and use the formula (ipsilateral-contralateral)/contralateral to determine fold change.
