    "Infection of P2.1 cells with SeVSeed 500,000 P2.1 cells into 6 cm tissue culture dishes (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170813/20170813193007_5641.jpgFigure 2. Development of SeV-persistent cell lines using P2.1 parental cells. A flow chart of generation and maintenance of SeV-persistently infected cells using P2.1 cell line. The Western blot shows the consistent levels of viral protein (SeV C) expression at various passage numbers (indicated by P), and actin was used as a loading control.After cells have adhered (about 16-18 h post seeding), check for 80% confluence, wash cells two times with DMEM containing 2% FBS (virus infection medium), then add a minimum amount (1 ml) of virus infection medium.Add SeV at a concentration of 80 hemagglutinating units/ml. Incubate the cells with virus for 1 h with gentle physical agitation every 10 min.Remove the virus-containing medium, and wash cells two times with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Continue culturing cells in DMEM containing 10% FBS, passaging cells every 3 days, setting aside 10% for detection of SeV and 50% for freezing.After each passage, reserve some of the cells for future analysis.Combine 0.5 ml cell suspension in DMEM containing 10% FBS with 0.5 ml cryoprotective medium in a labeled cryovial.Immediately place in a freezer kept at -80 °C.For long-term storage, store cells in liquid nitrogen tank.To determine the presence of virus, harvested cells are analyzed by Western blot for viral protein detection, as described below.SDS-PAGE and Western blot to confirm SeV infectionSeed P2.1 cells and SeV infected P2.1 cells into separate 6 cm tissue culture dishes.After 24 h or when the cells are confluent, harvest cell lysates.Remove media, and wash the plates once with cold PBS.Lyse cells in 50 µl of cold lysis buffer (see Recipes). Gently vortex and keep cell lysates on ice for 30 min.",
    "Centrifuge cell lysates at 16,200 x g (Rcf) for 20 min in a cold (4 °C) centrifuge.Load equal amounts of protein on a 20% SDS-PAGE gel.Note: Prior to loading, combine cell lysates with equal volumes of 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer.Electrophorese the proteins at 100 V for 2 h, or until adequate separation of proteins in the 10-100 kDa region is achieved.Transfer proteins onto a PVDF membrane using a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer apparatus at 0.06 mA for 1.5 h.Block the membrane in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk on a rocker at room temperature for 30 min.Add the anti-Sendai Virus C antibody at 1:5,000 dilution in blocking buffer. Incubate on a rocker at room temperature for 1 h or 12-16 h at 4 °C.Wash the membrane three times in TBST, and add the secondary (HRP-conjugated) antibody, diluted to 1:5,000 dilution in blocking buffer, incubating for 1 h at room temperature.Wash the membrane three times in TBST and incubate in ECL solution for 1-3 min.Develop on autoradiograph film using an autoradiograph film processor.Quantification of infectious virus particles in persistently infected cellsThe infectious SeV titers in the culture supernatants were determined by previously described procedure (Peters et al., 2008) and was represented as pfu/ml. Briefly, the following procedure is performed:Seed LLC-MK2 cells in 6-well plate at 100,000 cells per well in Medium 199 and allow the cells to become confluent (in about three days).The culture supernatants from the persistently infected cell lines are serial diluted and then used to infect confluent LLC-MK2 monolayer, using the virus infection protocol (as described in Procedure A). After infection, the cells are washed and overlaid with Medium 199 containing 0.5% agar.After 3 days, the agar layer is removed and the cells are washed with PBS.Virus colonies are visualized by incubating the monolayer with a 0.",
    "1% suspension of guinea pig red blood cells for 20-30 min. The monolayer is then washed with PBS and the hemabsorbed plaques are counted."
