    "The protocol contains a detailed description of the following steps: At first, phantoms or mice and the multimodal mouse bed are prepared for imaging. Then a whole-body scan is acquired in the µCT. Subsequently the mouse bed is transferred to the FMT where two scans are acquired (up and upside down). This can be repeated for multiple mice at multiple time points. After completion of the data acquisition, the data needs to be exported and sorted to enable automated segmentation (requiring a Definiens software license), as well as image fusion and fluorescence reconstruction (requiring an Imalytics Preclinical software license). Finally it is shown how the multimodal data sets are visualized and how organs are interactively segmented to quantify the biodistribution of fluorescent probes.\n1. Phantom Preparation\nNOTE: Phantoms are useful to test the imaging system, but also to determine the calibration factor for a new probe.\nPrepare a solution of 200 ml water, 2 % agarose, 1.8 g TiO2 powder, 50 µl trypan blue. After boiling, fill the solution into a rectangular form, approximately of 8 cm length, 3 cm width, and 1.5 cm height.\nPrepare several fluorescent inclusions in the phantom using pipette tips, containing a mix of fluorescence and µCT contrast agent. To create the inclusions, cut the pipette tips and seal them with a lighter.\nAfter the solution has solidified, insert the inclusions into the phantom. Cut away some parts of the phantom to achieve an irregular shape and to fit it to the multimodal mouse holder.",
    "To determine the calibration factor for a new probe, some phantom scans are required. For this, the default FMT phantom is used in combination with known amounts of the probe. For an increased accuracy, add 4 % lipid emulsion to the solution to receive the same scattering coefficient inside the inclusion as in the rest of the phantom. Also add a small amount (2 %) of µCT contrast agent for easier image analysis.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nNOTE: µCT-FMT imaging requires special preparation including anesthetization and hair removal.\nPlace the mouse on chlorophyll-free food 7 days before imaging. This will reduce the background signal and is particularly important for FMT channels below 750 nm.\nAll animal experiments are performed under anesthesia. To initiate the anesthesia, place the mouse in a chamber filled with 2 % isoflurane in air (flow rate 5 L/min) until the mouse is falling asleep. Confirm proper anesthetization by gentle toe or skin pinching and by checking relaxation of muscle tonus (e.g., jaw muscle). To sustain the anesthesia, continue the isoflurane application using a tube that is placed on the nose of the mouse (2 % isoflurane in air, flow rate 1 L/min). In order to prevent eye dryness, use vet ointment on anesthetized mice.\nTo inject contrast agent, fix the anesthetized mouse on a heating pad using tape. Place a catheter (syringe needle attached to a tube) to the tail vein and inject the fluorescent contrast agent (e.g., 2 nmol, with maximal injection volume of 5 ml/kg body weight, i.e., 150 µl for a 30 g mouse).",
    "For scanning a hairy mouse, the scanning area has to be depilated in advance. For this, use a shaver or hair removal cream. Some strains of mice can develop rashes from the hair removal cream. Therefore, monitor the mice for skin changes and contact veterinary staff for care if needed. Also test the tolerance on a small number of animals when using new mouse strains.\nKeep the mouse anesthetized during µCT and FMT imaging (2 % isoflurane in air, flow rate 1 L/min).\n3. Mouse Bed Preparation\nNOTE: For µCT-FMT scanning, use a multimodal mouse bed, which fits both into the µCT and the FMT.\nBefore imaging, clean the mouse bed with wet tissues. Do not use ethanol because this may damage the acrylic glass. Make sure that the markers are free of water, because this may impair the automated marker detection.\nOpen the screws of the multimodal mouse bed and remove the upper part.\nAttach the anesthetic gas tube on the mouse bed and fixate it with tape.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse into the mouse bed and put the nose into the gas tube. Make sure the head of the mouse is at the front indicator of the mouse bed (Figure 1).\nMake sure that the mouse is in the middle of the mouse bed to optimally use the field of view of the FMT.\nClose the mouse bed and tighten the screws until the mouse is tightly held. Make sure the mouse can breathe steadily by visual monitoring of thoracic breathing movements.\n4. µCT Imaging\nNOTE: A whole-body scan is performed using the µCT. The generated anatomical data is required for image fusion, for an improved fluorescence reconstruction and for image analysis.",
    "Place the mouse bed with the mouse into the µCT. Make sure that the mouse is placed in a way that it goes “tail-first” into the µCT. This is important for the automated fusion.\nIn order to sustain anesthesia when the µCT-lid is closed, reconnect the tubes to channel the gas through the case of the µCT. First detach the long tube from the mouse bed and attach it to the connector at the outside of the µCT. Then attach the remaining free end to the connector inside the µCT.\nDrive the mouse bed into the µCT. Make sure that the gas tube is not loose and cannot get caught by the rotating gantry. If necessary, fixate it with tape. Insert the tube into the cut-out of the holder of the mouse bed.\nClose the µCT and acquire a topogram. Select at least two subscans to cover a substantial part of the mouse and the mouse bed, which is important for the fusion and reconstruction.\nSelect the µCT scan protocol named HQD-6565-360-90, which acquires 720 projections with 1032 x 1012 pixels during one full rotation requiring a scanning time of 90 s per subscan. Tubes are operated at voltage 65 kV and current 1.0 mA. Alternatively, to reduce the radiation dose and scanning duration, select the scanning protocol SQD-6565-360-29 which acquires 720 projections with 516 x 506 pixels with scanning time 29 s per subscan.\nStart the µCT scan. The blue bar indicates the progress. The subscans will be acquired subsequently. Hypothermia and fluid loss are not a problem because of the short scanning duration of only a few minutes. Do not open the lid of the µCT during scanning because this will automatically interrupt the scanning to protect the user from radiation.",
    "When the scanning is completed, open the lid, reconnect the anesthetic tube and detach the mouse bed from the holder to transport it to the FMT.\n5. FMT Imaging\nNOTE: Directly after µCT scanning, the mouse is scanned in the FMT in two configurations (up and upside down) which are used together for an improved fluorescence reconstruction.\nTurn on the anesthetic gas supply (2 % isoflurane in air, flow rate 1 L/min) for the FMT before placing the mouse bed into the FMT. Using the FMT control software, create a study group with an appropriate number of subjects (i.e., mice). Select the probes that will be used for imaging (use OsteoSense for novel probes that are not listed).\nCarry the multimodal mouse bed with the mouse to the FMT. The long flexible anesthetic gas tube maintains the gas flow. Before inserting the mouse bed into the FMT, carefully remove the tube since it is not needed inside the FMT. Avoid turning the screws of the mouse bed.\nPlace the mouse bed into the FMT with the red indicator first (“head-first”). This is important for the image fusion to be consistent with the µCT.\nClose the FMT.\nSelect the correct study group and subject. Select the required channel of the FMT (for OsteoSense 750EX, use the 750 nm channel).\nAdd a description, e.g., “up” or “down” and acquire an overview scan by pressing “Capture”. This captures a reflectance image of the entire field of view. Make sure to not have “Reflectance Images Only” selected, because otherwise it is not possible to acquire 3D scans subsequently.",
    "Adjust the imaging parameters for the 3D scan. Enlarge the field of view to include as much as possible of the mouse. Usually, the head and tail will not entirely fit into the field of view, however. Click “Advanced” and check the imaging settings. Set sampling density to 3 mm, sensitivity to normal and illumination min/max to 5000 and 50000, respectively.\nClick “add to reconstruction queue” and then click “Scan” to start the FMT scan. This will take around 5 to 15 min, depending on the size and thickness of the mouse, because longer exposure times are required for thicker objects. The device contains a heated imaging chamber to avoid hypothermia.\nAfter the scan, flip the mouse bed including the mouse upside down and acquire another scan. This provides additional data for the fluorescence reconstruction.\nWhen the µCT and the FMT-scans are completed and the mouse wakes up from the anesthesia, do not leave it unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness, e.g., to walk around or to maintain sternal recumbency.\n6. Image Fusion and Reconstruction\nNOTE: After completion of the µCT-FMT scanning, e.g., at the end of the study, the acquired data needs to be sorted to enable the automated image fusion and fluorescence reconstruction.\nTo sort the scans for further processing, create a folder for the study. For each µCT-FMT scan, create one subfolder whose name contains the mouse ID and the time point, e.g., M01_02h.\nFor each µCT-FMT scan, export the FMT scans (up and down) as .fmt files and save them into the subfolder using filenames ending with either “_up.fmt” or “_down.fmt”. Each .fmt file contains the acquired raw data, i.e., the excitation and emission images acquired by the camera, the metadata, such as the exposure times, and the fluorescence reconstruction generated by the FMT.",
    "Using the µCT software, create a reconstruction with isotropic voxel size 35 µm. Select a smooth reconstruction kernel (T10). Adjust the field of view so that the entire mouse bed including the markers is covered. Select MIFX/RAW as output format and start the reconstruction. After the reconstruction is done, move the µCT reconstruction files into the subfolder of the µCT-FMT scan.\nExport the µCT and FMT data for all scans. Make sure that each subfolder contains two .fmt files (up and down) and the µCT reconstruction in the MIFX/RAW format. To check for completeness select Menu->CT-FMT->Check Completeness using the Imalytics Preclinical software. A list of errors might appear, such as missing .fmt files or µCT reconstructions. Fix the errors and check for completeness until all errors are resolved.\nUsing Menu->CT-FMT->Settings, check the server name of the Definiens software and adjust if necessary. The default is http://localhost:8184, assuming that the Definiens software is installed on the same computer. The Definiens software is required in the next step to perform the automated segmentation of the mouse bed and markers.\nClick Menu->CT-FMT->Fuse group in the Imalytics Preclinical software to perform automated µCT-FMT fusion for the entire study. This takes a few minutes per µCT-FMT scan and results in a folder with suffix “Package” parallel to the study folder. This contains a smaller subset of files (the µCT data and the fused vendor-provided FMT reconstruction) that are relevant for further analysis.",
    "Click Menu->CT-FMT->Reconstruct group (FMT) in the Imalytics Preclinical software to perform the fluorescence reconstruction including the generation of absorption and scattering maps13. Even though the processing is GPU-accelerated20, each reconstruction requires 1 to 4 hr depending on the size of the mouse. The results will be stored in the package folder. Note: To enable a higher throughput, we currently perform these reconstructions on a GPU cluster with 56 GPUs.\n7. Image Analysis\nNOTE: To extract quantitative measurements from the image data, segmentation of lesions and organs is required.\nOnce all data sets are fused and reconstructed, create a segmentation for each µCT-FMT scan using the Imalytics Preclinical software.\nLoad a µCT file as underlay and the fluorescence file as overlay. Press “3D” to turn on the volume rendering and inspect the data set.\nTo segment the lung, click Menu->Classes->Add class and create a class named “tmp”. This can also be done through the context menu. Creating a new class automatically sets it as output class for subsequent segmentation operations.\n\t\nPerform a thresholding operation to segment all regions with low intensity in the µCT data set (click Menu->Segmentation->Thresholding->Below and enter 600). Now the tmp class contains the air outside the mouse but also the lung tissue.\nCreate a “Lung” class. Perform a “Fill Region” operation (right-click into the lung and select Menu->Fill Region->Fill region unlimited), to separate the lung from the outer air.\nDelete the tmp class because it is not needed anymore.\nTo segment convex regions, e.g., the bladder, use the scribble mode. First create a class “Bladder”.\n\t\nPress F1 to delete all scribbles.\nUsing the computer mouse, draw scribbles to delineate the boundaries of the bladder.",
    "Press F3 to fill the region enclosed by the scribbles with a temporary mask which appears as red overlay. Iteratively add more scribbles (in any slicing orientation) and press F3 until a sufficient accuracy is achieved. Typically, scribbles in 10 slices are sufficient.\nPress F4 to store the temporary mask as “Bladder”.\nProceed like this to segment other convex regions such as the heart and kidneys. Many regions, e.g., the stomach or the liver, can be approximated by a few convex regions.\nTo segment the spine, first create a “Bone” class.\n\t\nSelect ContextMenu->Thresholding->Above to perform a thresholding operation to classify all bright voxels (e.g., above 1,600) as “Bone”.\nA region filling operation would fail to segment the spine because it is connected with many other parts of the skeleton, e.g., the ribs. Perform a few cutting operations by iteratively drawing scribbles and pressing F2 to separate the spine from the skull, the ribs, and the sacral bone.\nFinally, create a class “Spine” and perform a region filling operation to get the spine (right-click into the spine and select ContextMenu->Fill Region->Fill region unlimited).\nSave the segmentation as a file inside the subfolder of the µCT-FMT scan. Use a consistent name, e.g., organs.seg, to enable the batch processing.\nSelect Menu->Statistics->Class statistics (overlay), to generate a spreadsheet which contains the mean fluorescence intensity, the volume and the total amount (product of mean and volume) for each class.\nTo generate a single spreadsheet containing the values for all regions of all µCT-FMT scans, click Menu->Batch->Set batch settings and then click Menu->Batch->Batch statistics. This avoids the effort of creating and merging many spreadsheet files, i.e., one for each µCT-FMT scan.\n8. Probe Calibration",
    "To calculate the calibration factor for a probe, multiple µCT-FMT phantom scans with different known amounts of the probe are required (see step 1.4), e.g., with 100 pmol, 50 pmol, 25 pmol and 0 pmol.\nScan the phantoms as described in sections 4 and 5. Also for phantom scans, up and down scans in the FMT are required.\nExport the data and perform fusion and reconstruction as described in section 6.\nSegment the inclusion using the µCT data for each scan by thresholding (above 1,200) and region filling.\nGenerate a spreadsheet with the measured fluorescence amounts and plot them as function of the known amounts. Compute the slope of a linear regression fit. This is the calibration factor for the probe."
