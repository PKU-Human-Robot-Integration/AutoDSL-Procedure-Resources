    "The protocols used in this study have been approved by the Comité Institutionnel des Animaux de l'Université de Sherbrooke, a Canadian Council on animal care certified institution.\n1. Preparation for micro-dissection (pre-dissection)\nPerform anesthesia with 5% isoflurane, followed by euthanasia with 2% isoflurane and 10 psi of CO2 until there are no vital signs.\n\tNOTE: Do not perform cervical dislocation, as this damages the spinal cord and cervical ganglions.\nPlace the euthanized mouse facing up (anterior view) on a dissection pad, and spray the fur with 70% ethanol.\nThen, pin the upper and lower limbs, using four small-diameter pins to hold the mouse in position during the dissection.\nUsing surgical scissors, cut the skin open from the lower abdomen to the throat.\nPeel off the skin to expose the internal organs, and use additional pins to maintain the skin on each side while exposing the abdominal cavity.\nCut the thoracic cage open to expose the heart and lungs.\nUsing a pair of standard anatomical forceps, grip the esophageal and trachea, and cut just above the forceps.\nThen, begin to peel off all the internal organs in a cranial to caudal approach. To do so, cut the diaphragm along the vertebral column to remove all the internal organs in one piece.\nUnpin the mouse and rinse off extra mouse blood from the abdominal cavity in a sink.\nPlace the mouse face down (posterior view). Pin the upper and lower limbs, using four pins to hold the mouse in position during the dissection.\nUsing surgical scissors, peel off the skin from the head to the hind limbs.\nExpose the left sciatic nerve (lower limb).\n\t\nCut the muscles open in the lower part of the left lower limb.\nLocate and expose the sciatic nerve by removing the muscle around it.",
    "Carefully cut the sciatic nerve at the sural, tibial, and peroneal nerve ramification, and spare the blood vessels.\nContinue to isolate the sciatic nerve using standard anatomical forceps and extra fine Bonn scissors, until it becomes parallel to the vertebral column, leaving a free nerve of about 2 cm.\nInsert the surgical scissors parallel to the spinal cord, and cut the hip.\nDislocate the hip by pulling apart the sacrum and the femur using fingers.\n\t\tNOTE: During this process, it is required to stop frequently to gently pull the sciatic nerve using forceps to avoid disruption.\nAt the end, delicately tear the hind limb off the mouse carcass, leaving a sciatic nerve of about 4 cm in length.\n\t\tNOTE: During this process, locate the L2 nerve, and tease it out of the hind limb to avoid damage to the L2. Repeat step 1.12 for the right side.\nExpose the brachial nerves (upper limbs).\n\t\nManipulate the mouse carcass in hands, rather than on a flat surface (dissection pad).\nLocate the left brachial plexus by teasing apart the fat and muscles in the left armpit.\nOnce located, cut the main brachial plexus ramifications (radially, axillary, suprascapular) and their sub-ramifications around the ulna with extra fine Bonn scissors, leaving free nerves of around 1.5 cm. Gently peel off the plexus out of the upper left limb.\nDislocate the upper left limb; ensure it is nerve-free. Repeat step 1.13 for the right side.\nExpose the brain.\n\t\nNow, place the mouse face up (anterior view)\nInsert one blade of the extra fine Bonn scissors in the mouth, and cut the mandible through the throat.\nRemove the mandible by further cutting from the cheeks to the throat.\nThen, cut the skull bone passing from one ear to the other.",
    "NOTE: Be careful to avoid going too deep and damaging the brain.\nCut and remove the palate and nasal bones to open the skull.\nCut the C1 vertebra at the base of the skull, releasing the cerebellum and the beginning of the spinal cord.\nFinally, cut the skull transversely up to the eye, and remove the pieces of the skull to expose the brain.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the brain in its cavity until the nerves are peeled off.\nRemove any extra fat or muscles from the carcass. Place the carcass in 10% formalin for 15 min at room temperature (RT), followed by brief 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) washes until there is no more fixative odor, and proceed to the next step.\n\t​NOTE: If the nervous system is dissected in the next 2 weeks, store it at 4 °C in PBS. Otherwise, store it in 10% formalin indefinitely. Always use a chemical hood when manipulating formalin.\n2. Spinal cord exposure\nTo expose the spinal cord, use a cranial-to-caudal approach. To remove each vertebra and their muscle layer above, cut at the ten o'clock and two o'clock positions on the ventral side, using Vannas spring scissors. Chip away the vertebra using Dumont mini-forceps. Continue this process through the cervical and thoracic vertebrae.\nFor the lumbar section, cut the transverse process on each side of the vertebra. Then, cut at the two o'clock and ten o'clock positions by inserting the blade of a pair of Vannas spring scissors into the vertebral canal. Remove the tissues, paying attention to the nerves which are sometimes stuck to the bones.\nProceed similarly for the caudal part.\n3. Thoracic nerve exposure\nPut the carcass under the dissection microscope to visualize the anterior side.",
    "Using Vannas spring scissors, cut along each rib (from the sternum to the lower extremities) to expose the peripheral nerves.\nNext, cut the vertebra on both sides (laterally) of the ganglion to expose the ganglion.\n4. Peripheral nerve peel off\nTo peel off the spinal cord and further dislodge the peripheral nerves, use the Dumont mini-forceps to gently roll the spinal cord and pull out the nerves one by one, starting with the caudal part of the spinal cord.\n\tNOTE: Before peeling off, an additional fixation can be performed in 10% formalin for 15 min at RT, followed by brief 1x PBS washes until there is no more fixative odor, as performed in step 1.15.\nFor the thoracic part, pull the nerve at a 90° angle (perpendicular to the spinal cord).\nFor the brachial plexus, cut the vertebra next to the nerve, to make room for the nerve.\n\tNOTE: The brachial plexus cannot be passed under the vertebra, as in the thoracic region.\nRemove the excess muscles to clear the nerves.\nStore in PBS at 4 °C for up to a total of 2 weeks, or indefinitely in 10% formalin at RT.\nSubscription Required.
