    "1. Fixation\nStart with 10 million Schneider's line 2 plus (S2R+) cells to prepare 17.5 mL of a cell suspension in Schneider medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at room temperature (RT).\nAdd methanol-free formaldehyde to obtain a final concentration of 2%. Mix and incubate for 10 min at RT, taking care to mix every minute.\n\tNOTE: Formaldehyde is a hazardous chemical. Follow the appropriate health and safety regulations, and work in the fume hood.\nQuench the reaction by adding glycine to achieve a final concentration of 0.125 M and mix. Incubate for 5 min at RT, followed by 15 min on ice.\nCentrifuge for 400 × g at RT for 5 min and then for 10 min at 4 °C; discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet carefully in 25 mL of cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, then discard the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: If continuing with the protocol, go to step 2.1 for lysis; otherwise, flash-freeze the pellet in liquid N2 and store the pellet at -80 °C.\n2. Lysis\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 0.2% of non-ionic surfactant (see the Table of Materials); 10 mM NaCl; 1x protease inhibitors), and adjust the volume to 10 mL with ice-cold lysis buffer. Adjust the volume to obtain a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Incubate on ice for 30 min, mixing every 2 min by inverting the tubes.",
    "Centrifuge the nuclei at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then carefully discard the supernatant. Wash the pellet 1x with 1 mL of cold lysis buffer, and transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube. Wash the pellet 1x with 1 mL of cold 1.25x restriction buffer, and resuspend each cell pellet in 360 µL of 1.25x restriction buffer.\nAdd 11 µL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) per tube (0.3% final concentration), mix carefully by pipetting, and incubate at 37 °C for 45 min, shaking at 700-950 rpm. Pipet up and down to disrupt clumps a few times during incubation.\nQuench the SDS by adding 75 µL of non-ionic surfactant (10% solution, see the Table of Materials) per tube (1.6% final concentration), and incubate at 37 °C for 45 min, shaking at 950 rpm. Pipet up and down a few times to disrupt clumps during incubation.\n\tNOTE: If clumps are large and difficult to disrupt, decrease the rotating speed to 400 rpm during SDS and surfactant treatments. If the clumps are difficult to disaggregate by pipetting, split the sample into two; adjust the volumes of restriction buffer, SDS, and surfactant; and proceed with the permeabilization. Next, spin the nuclei at minimum speed (200 × g), carefully discard the supernatant, pool the samples together in 1X restriction buffer, and proceed with digestion. Take a 10 µL aliquot as the undigested sample (UD).\n3. Enzymatic digestion\nDigest the chromatin by adding 200 units (U) of Mbo I per tube, and incubate at 37 °C for a period ranging from 4 h to overnight while rotating (950 rpm).\nOn the next day, add an additional 50 U of Mbo I per tube, and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h while rotating (950 rpm).",
    "Inactivate the enzyme by incubating the tubes at 60 °C for 20 min. Place the tubes on ice.\n\tNOTE: Take a 10 µL aliquot as the digested sample (D).\n4.

Crosslink reversal and DNA purification\nDegrade proteins by adding 50 µL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K per tube, and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h. Reverse crosslinks by increasing the temperature to 65 °C and incubate overnight.\nDegrade RNA by adding 20 µL of 10 mg/mL RNase A, and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPerform phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.\n\t\nAdd 1 volume of phenol-chloroform, and mix thoroughly by inversion to obtain a homogeneous white phase.\n\t\tNOTE: Phenol is a hazardous chemical. Follow the appropriate health and safety regulations. Work in the fume hood.",
    "Centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Transfer the aqueous phase into a fresh 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Perform a back-extraction of the lower layer with 100 µL of TLE buffer, and transfer the aqueous phase into the same 2 mL tube.\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 2 volumes of 100% ethyl alcohol (EtOH), 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate, and 2 µL of 20 mg/mL glycogen. Incubate at -20 °C for a period ranging from 2 h to overnight.\nSpin at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and wash the pellets 2x with ice-cold 70% EtOH. Dry the pellets at RT, and resuspend in 100 µL of TLE buffer. Quantify the DNA using a fluorogenic dye that binds selectively to DNA and a fluorometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Store ligation products at 4 °C for the short term or at -20 °C for the long term. Use an aliquot (100 ng) of the material as the ligated sample (L) for quality control.\n7. Assess Hi-C template quality\nDigestion and ligation qualitative controls\n\t\nPurify DNA from the UD and D aliquots by reversing the crosslinks, and perform phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation as described above.\nLoad 100 ng of UD, D, and L samples in a 1.5% agarose gel. Look for a smear centered around 500 bp in the D sample versus a high molecular weight band for the L sample (see representative results).\nDigestion efficiency quantitative control\n\tNOTE: To assess the digestion efficiency more accurately, use the UD and D samples as templates to perform quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) using primers designed as follows.",
    "Design a primer pair that amplifies a DNA fragment containing the DNA restriction site for the enzyme used for digestion (Mbo I in the present protocol), called R in the formula in step 7.2.3.\nDesign a primer pair that amplifies a control DNA fragment that does not contain the restriction site for the enzyme used for digestion (Mbo I for the present protocol), called C in the formula in step 7.2.3.\nUse the cycle threshold values (Ct values) of the amplification to calculate restriction efficiency according to the formula shown below:\n\t\t% Restriction = 100 - 100/2{(CtR - CtC)D - (CtR - CtC)UD}\n\t\tWhere CtR refers to the Ct value of fragment R, and CtC refers to the Ct value of the fragment C for sample D and sample UD.\n\t\tNOTE: The restriction percentage reflects the efficiency of the restriction enzyme cleaving the restricted (R) DNA fragment compared to a control (C) DNA fragment that does not contain the restriction DNA site. A restriction efficiency of ≥ 80% is recommended.\nDetection of known interactions\n\t\nPerform PCR to amplify an internal ligation control to examine short-range and/or medium- or long-range interactions (see representative results).\nAlternatively, design primers to amplify a ligation product in which the primers are in forward-forward or reverse-reverse orientation in adjacent restriction fragments.\nFill-in and biotin-labeling control\n\t\nVerify Hi-C marking and ligation efficiency by amplification and digestion of a known interaction or a ligation product between adjacent restriction fragments in the genome, as described above.\n\t\tNOTE: Successful fill-in and ligation of the Mbo I site (GATC) generates a new site for the restriction enzyme Cla I (ATCGAT) at the ligation junction and regenerates the Mbo I site.",
    "Digest the PCR product with Mbo I, Cla I, or both. After running the samples on a 1.5-2% gel, estimate the relative number of 3C and Hi-C ligation junctions by quantifying the intensity of the cut and uncut bands26.\n\t\tNOTE: An efficiency of > 70% is desired (see representative results).\n8. Sonication\nSonicate the samples to obtain 200-500 bp DNA fragments. For the instrument used in this protocol (see the Table of Materials), dilute the sample (from 5 to 10 µg) in 130 µL of ddH2O per tube, and set the instrument to sonicate to 400 bp: fill level: 10; duty factor: 10%; peak incident power (w): 140; cycles per burst: 200; time (s): 80.\n9.

Size selection\nTo select fragments mostly in the 250-550 bp size range, perform sequential solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) size selection first with 0.6x, followed by 0.90x according to the manufacturer's instructions, and elute the DNA using 100 µL of TLE.\n11. Biotin pulldown/A-tailing/adapter ligation",
    "NOTE: Perform the washes by resuspending the magnetic beads by vortexing, rotate the samples for 3 min on a rotating wheel, and then briefly spin down the sample and place it on the magnetic stand. Allow the beads to stick to the magnet, discard the supernatant, and proceed with the following wash step. Perform the washes at 55 °C on a thermo-block with rotation instead of the rotating wheel.\nMake up the final volume to 300 µL per sample with TLE for pull-down.
