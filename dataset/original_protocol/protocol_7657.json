    "Sample collection and fixation (both whole mount and cryosections) Prepare 200 mL of 100–150 mg/L MS-222 in fish system water into a glass beaker. Use an appropriate net size to catch the fish from the tank and place it into the beaker. Anesthetize fish for at least 5 min and transfer them to a Petri dish using a plastic spoon to perform fin amputation.Amputate the caudal fin using a sterile razor blade at the desired position and allow for regeneration to proceed to the chosen time point (Figure 1A and 1B). For simplicity, we recommend amputations perpendicular to the anterior–posterior axis, removing 50% of the area of the fin. Most fins will show robust regeneration in a range from 30% to 70% removed area. Be aware that amputation position will change regeneration speed as reported before (Uemoto et al., 2020).Euthanize the fish in accordance with animal care protocols approved by your research institution. We recommend the use of hypothermic shock to perform euthanasia. Immerse the fish in a sufficient volume of chilled system water (2–4 °C) to allow for locomotion. Wait until orientation and operculum movements are lost; this may vary depending on fish size and age. Leave the fish for at least 10 min following loss of orientation and cessation of operculum movement before disposing in biohazard waste bag and deposit into a biological waste freezer, following your home institution guidelines.Pour 20 mL of fixative solution (see Recipe 2) into a 100 mm Petri dish.Note: Although 0.5% formic acid may be left out of the fixative solution, its inclusion has been shown to improve penetration of whole-mount samples (Guerrero-Hernández et al., 2021).",
    "Collect the whole tail with a fragment of the spine as shown in Figure 1C; this step is important to avoid folding or wrinkling of the fin tissue during fixation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4908/bioprotoc-13-24-4908-g001.jpgFigure 1. Caudal fin sample collection prevents folding of the tissue during fixation. A. Anesthetized full size adult male prior to amputation. B. Caudal fin amputation and plane of future sample collection. C. Fixation step in orbital shaker placed in a cold room; a close-up picture of the sample is shown in the top right corner, where ~4 mm of the spine was included during sample collection to prevent the fin from folding during fixation.Transfer the sample to a Petri dish with fixative solution and incubate at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 2 h in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Wash with 20 mL of PBS-Tween (see Recipe 1) three times for 15 min each in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.All steps described above are common for both whole-mount and cryosections. For cryosections, skip to section F; otherwise, continue for whole-mount preparation.Permeabilization and bleaching (whole mount) Transfer samples to a polypropylene jar.Permeabilize samples by incubating with 10 mL of PBS-Tween-NaN3 (see Recipe 4) for 12 h in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm at room temperature.Incubate in 10 mL of 25% MetOH (see Recipe 7) for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 50% MetOH (see Recipe 8) for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 75% MetOH (see Recipe 9) for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 100% MetOH overnight (>12 h) at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.",
    "Transfer samples to a 60 mm Petri dish.Incubate in 10 mL of bleaching solution (see Recipe 6) for 12 h at room temperature under direct exposure to white light from a white lamp with goose neck, as shown in Figure 2.Note: Make sure the lid of the Petri dish is properly placed to avoid evaporation and that the lamp is not touching the Petri dish to avoid both heating up the sample and media evaporation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4908/bioprotoc-13-24-4908-g002.jpgFigure 2. Hydrogen peroxide methanol bleaching. A. Dehydrated fin before bleaching in the top panel and after bleaching in the bottom panel. B. Setup with lamp and Petri dish with bleaching solution. C. Fin placement for optimal bleaching with the lamp.Repeat previous step every 12 h with freshly made bleaching solution until desired bleaching; the more pigmented the sample, the more bleaching iterations this will take to dissolve all pigment. For most specimens, two steps of bleaching will suffice (1 day), and three bleaching steps should be sufficient to bleach very pigmented specimens (1.5 days).Transfer samples to a polypropylene jar.Incubate in 10 mL of 50% MetOH for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 25% MetOH for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Wash with 10 mL of PBS-Tween-NaN3 overnight (>12 h) at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Staining (whole mount) Incubate in 10 mL of blocking solution (see Recipe 10) for 24 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Wash with 20 mL of PBS-Tween twice for 15 min each at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of primary antibody solution (see Recipe 11) for 24 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.",
    "Wash with 20 mL of PBS-Tween four times for 15 min each at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of secondary antibody solution (see Recipe 12) for 24 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Wash with 20 mL of PBS-Tween four times for 15 min each at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of nuclear dye solution (see Recipe 14) for 24 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Repeat the previous step until desired nuclear staining has been reached. This may be necessary when working with larger tissues or when staining multiple fins in the same container. In our experience, two rounds of nuclear staining are sufficient to fully stain large tissues with high signal to noise ratio.Clearing (whole mount) Incubate in 10 mL of 25% MetOH for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 50% MetOH for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 75% MetOH for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of 100% MetOH for 4 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Fully stained and dehydrated samples can be stored in the freezer at -20 °C in 100% MetOH for extended periods of time (~1 month). It is key that containers are tightly sealed to avoid evaporation and drying of samples in storage.Incubate in 10 mL of DCM-MetOH solution (see Recipe 15) for 3 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.Incubate in 10 mL of DCM for 15 min at room temperature in an orbital shaker at 50 rpm.",
    "Repeat the previous step at least one more time and until the sample sinks to the bottom of the jar.Fill a 5 mL Eppendorf tube with 5 mL of DBE.Transfer the sample to a Kimwipe tissue to remove excess of DCM, transfer to the Eppendorf tube filled with DBE, and incubate in a rocking shaker for 15 min.Discard DBE and fill with fresh DBE. Leave the sample overnight protected from light.Mounting (whole mount) Heat up DER 332 in a 60 °C oven or water bath for at least 30 min; it should look homogeneous and much more liquid than at room temperature.In a 50 mL conical tube, pour 23 mL of DER 332, 7 mL of DER 736, and 6 mL of IPDA. Be careful to pour all the volumes from the plastic pipette as resin may adhere to the walls of the pipette.Homogenize the solution by circular hand movements until the solution is clear. You will introduce bubbles to the resin, which is expected (see Figure 3A and 3B).Centrifuge the conical tube at ≥ 3,000× g for 10 min at room temperature. If bubbles are still present, you may increase the centrifugation speed (see Figure 3C).With extreme care to avoid making bubbles, pour 10 mL of resin into a polypropylene jar using 10 mL pipettes with very slow pipetting motion only once. Reusing pipettes may result in bubbles being introduced to the resin.Transfer all contents from the Eppendorf tube into a 100 mm Petri dish. The sample should be transparent after clearing and may be hard to find. If the sample did not come out when pouring the contents of the Eppendorf tube into the Petri dish, use forceps to carefully extract the sample from the tube (see Figure 3D).",
    "With extreme care to avoid making bubbles, use forceps to pick up the sample and gently insert the sample into the resin located in the polypropylene jar (see Figure 3E).Stir the sample very gently while holding it with forceps to wash away the DBE for a couple of turns, being extremely careful not to make bubbles.Transfer the sample to the coverslip bottom Petri dish and, with extreme care without making bubbles, place it on top of the coverslip.Orient the sample according to your imaging needs, pushing the sample to the bottom against the coverslip using forceps so it locates adjacent to the coverslip. This is particularly important to avoid placing the sample too far from the objective working distance.Pour enough resin to fill the coverslip but maintain part of the sample protruding from the layer of resin. This is important because if the sample is completely submerged in resin it will float over time and get away from the coverslip (see Figure 3F).Incubate the coverslip bottom Petri dish with the sample in a dark environment at room temperature for 12 h, covering it with the lid to prevent any dust particles from attaching to the resin.Prepare new resin according to the procedure described above and pour enough volume to completely submerge the sample in resin (see Figure 3G).Optional: place a coverslip on top of the resin without introducing bubbles; this may be of particular interest for transmitted light imaging.Cure the coverslip bottom Petri dish with the sample in a dark environment at room temperature for at least three days before imaging (see Figure 3H and 3I).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4908/bioprotoc-13-24-4908-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Caudal fin sample collection and cryosectioning preparation. A. Sample placed and oriented into the OCT embedding molds and the mold after OCT is frozen. B. SlideTray slide staining system where subsequent steps are performed.Transfer samples to a new tissue mold with fresh OCT and position samples according to the sectioning plane under dissecting microscope with a fine brush or probe.Place the OCT containing tissue mold on dry ice or other freezing medium such as liquid nitrogen (-40 °C to -70 °C) to freeze the samples. OCT is viscous at room temperature but freezes into a solid support below -10 °C.",
    "Note: Liquid nitrogen is not recommended because it may cause tissues or blocks to crack. Cut sections 10–12 μm thick in the cryostat at approximately -18 °C. If necessary, adjust the temperature of the cryostat chamber ±3 °C according to the tissues under study.Note: The optimal temperature for obtaining high-quality cryosections may vary from tissue to tissue. A camel hairbrush is recommended to guide the emerging section over the knife blade or flatten the curved section. Within 30 s of cutting a tissue section, transfer the section with acceptable morphology to a room temperature microscope slide by touching the slide to the tissue. The tissue section will immediately melt onto the slide due to temperature differences.Note: This must be completed within 30 s of cutting to avoid freeze drying and unwanted morphological changes of the tissue. Poly-L-lysine-coated or silanized slides improve the adherence of the section (for reference, watch 9:40–9:45 clip at https://youtu.be/tA7S75MFdNk?si=7oq-uMaaxVEi1i_e&t=580[href=https://youtu.be/tA7S75MFdNk?si=7oq-uMaaxVEi1i_e&t=580]).Quickly evaluate tissue preservation/orientation and check your slide under a dissecting microscope. Collect enough sections per slide according to the need or the size of your samples. On most cases, 10–12 sections can be accommodated on a single slide.Allow the section to air dry onto the slide at room temperature for 2 h to maximize the adherence of collected sections to the slide.Air-dried slides can be processed immediately, or they can be placed in a box and stored for up to a month in -20 °C. When finished sectioning, you may store the remaining unused tissue block by covering it with a layer of OCT to prevent freeze drying.Staining and mounting (cryosections) Use the SlideTray Slide Staining System to perform the following steps on the slides, as shown in Figure 4B.Circle the tissue with Super PAP pen to avoid liquid leakage outside of the region of interest.",
    "Wash twice with PBS-Tween (see Recipe 1) for 10 min at room temperature. Slides may come from the freezer or right after air drying.Block with 500 μL per slide of PBS-Tween with 10% FBS and 5% DMSO for 1 h at room temperature.Wash once with PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature.Incubate with 200 µL of TrueBlack solution for 1 min at room temperature.Wash twice with PBS (without Tween) for 10 min at room temperature.Immunolabel with 500 μL per slide of primary antibodies (H3P, 1:400; Ecad, 1:200) PBS-Tween with 10% FBS and 5% DMSO solution for 1 h at room temperature.Wash twice with PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature.Develop fluorescent signal with 500 μL per slide of secondary antibodies (Rabbit-AF647, 1:400; Mouse-AF555, 1:500) in PBS-Tween with 10% FBS and 5% DMSO for 1 h at room temperature.Wash three times with PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature.Stain nuclei with 500 μL per slide of nuclear dye solution (see Recipe 14) for 1 h at room temperature. Alternatively, you may use DAPI solution (see Recipe 16) for 15 min at room temperature.Wash three times with PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature.Pour one drop of ProLong Gold antifade mountant.Mount coverslip and leave the slide to cure overnight protected from the light.Imaging (both whole mount and cryosections) Place the sample on the stage and image according to the fluorophores conjugated to the secondary antibodies.For volumetric imaging of whole-mount samples, use a 10× air objective on a Nikon spinning disk confocal microscope and collect a slice every 5 μm for the entirety of the sample (between 80 and 120 slices), making sure that the fluorescent signal does not saturate the detection range of the camera (see Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4908/bioprotoc-13-24-4908-g005.jpgFigure 5.
