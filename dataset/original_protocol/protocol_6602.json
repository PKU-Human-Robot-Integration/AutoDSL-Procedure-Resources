    "Transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Transform pRATIO3212-SMAX1 into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation method (Mersereau et al., 1990).Select the transformants on LB agar plates [containing 50 µg/ml Spectinomycin (expression construct), 25 µg/ml Gentamicin (helper plasmid), and 25 µg/ml Rifampicin (genomic)] at 30 °C for 2-3 days.Propagation of Nicotiana benthamiana Germinate ~50-100 seeds in a 3.5-inch square plastic pot containing potting soil at ~21-24 °C and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod with ~80-100 μmol/m2s light intensity. Cover the pot with a plastic cover to ensure high humidity.As soon as the first true leaves emerge (10-12 days), transfer the seedlings to 3.5-inch plastic pots containing potting soil (two seedlings per pot) and cover again for 4 days with a plastic cover. Remove cover and maintain in growth conditions described above.Water plants every second day or as required.At 3-3.5 weeks after transplanting, the plant has reached the optimal developmental stage for agroinfiltration.Note: It is best to stop watering plants one day before the infiltration.Transient expressionCulture A. tumefaciens carrying pRATIO3212-SMAX1 or pBIN61-p19 (hereafter, p19) in 2-3 ml liquid LB medium containing 25 µg/ml Gentamicin (helper plasmid), 25 µg/ml Rifampicin (genomic), 50 µg/ml Spectinomycin (pRATIO3212-SMAX1), 50 µg/ml Kanamycin (p19); grow overnight at 30 °C incubator, 200-220 rpm.Notes: The presence of p19 partially blocks RNA silencing and thus establishes a higher and more uniform transgene expression. For each transformed strain, prepare glycerol stocks by mixing 0.5 ml of culture with 0.5 ml of 50% glycerol. Store at -80 °C. Dilute the starter culture 1:1,000 in 15 ml LB + antibiotics in a 50 ml Falcon tube. Grow overnight at 30 °C incubator, 200 -220 rpm.Note: Perform this step in the evening. The culture volume can be scaled up depending on the number of transformations intended.",
    "However, we recommend keeping the culture volume less than 30 ml in a 50 ml Falcon tube for proper aeration. Pellet cells at 3,900 x g, 10 min at room temperature, remove supernatant, add 10 ml of infiltration media (see Recipes) and resuspend.Repeat Step C3, resuspend the pelleted cells in ~3-4 ml of infiltration media.Note: These washes remove traces of antibiotics that can kill the leaf tissue after infiltration. Measure absorbance of the culture at 600 nm. Add 100 µl Agrobacterium culture to a clear 96-well plate and measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) with a microplate reader.Notes: Blank the plate reader with a well containing infiltration media and use blank subtracted OD600 readings for further calculations. Alternatively, OD600 can be measured in a 1 ml plastic cuvette using a spectrophotometer. Determine the titer of culture required for infiltration and calculate the dilution factor for a final volume of 4.0-5.0 ml of culture in infiltration media, depending on the number of transformations intended. For example, if you require a final OD600 of 0.6 and culture reads 1.5, then you will need initial volume = (final OD600 x final volume)/initial OD600. Therefore, the required initial volume = (0.6 x 4 ml)/1.5 = 1.6 ml.Note: In this protocol, SMAX1 and p19 were diluted to OD600 of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, in the final infiltration volume of 4.0 ml. However, the optimum ratio might be different for other proteins. The final OD600 should not exceed 1.2 as this induces tissue necrosis, while OD600 of 0.3 and lower on the other hand drastically reduces transient expression efficiencies (Kim et al., 2009) (see Note 1). Vortex and incubate the cultures for 4 h at room temperature (without shaking).Choose the proper leaves for infiltration.",
    "Select the healthiest looking plants and avoid leaves that are torn or otherwise damaged. The ideal leaves are young leaves that are ~3-5 cm wide. Use 2-3 leaves per plant and at least 3 leaves (from independent plants) per construct.Notes: The developmental stage of the Nicotiana benthamiana plants is important for the success of this method. Healthy plants should have at least two large leaves, which may be the third or fourth leaf from the apical meristem. Avoid using small leaves as they are harder to infiltrate and display reduced transformation rates. Plants should not have flowered at the time of infiltration. Swirl the solution in the tube before drawing it up into the syringe, in order to evenly suspend the Agrobacterium. Press the nozzle of a 1 ml syringe without a needle against the abaxial (lower) surface of the leaf and hold a gloved finger on the other side and inject slowly. Try to be as gentle as possible when injecting, to avoid damaging the leaf. The infiltrated area appears as a dark, water-soaked region. If the infiltrated region stops expanding without pushing too hard, infiltrate again in a different area of the leaf. After infiltration, pat dry the leaf surface with a Kimwipe and mark the edge of the infiltrated circle with a Sharpie permanent marker. Mark the leaf by attaching a small tag to the petiole.Notes: (Optional) Before infiltration, a small incision can be made at the site of infiltration using a sterile razor. Make sure that the wounds do not perforate the leaf, which could decrease the efficiency of the infiltration. We usually do not infiltrate more than one construct per leaf. It is not necessary to infiltrate the total leaf space. We typically infiltrate 2-3 spots in a single leaf.",
    "If you are infiltrating leaves with different constructs on the same plant, you should clean your gloves with 70% ethanol (or wipe them with Kimwipe) in between infiltrations and ensure that the leaves are not touching each other to prevent cross-contamination. We suggest using leaves transformed with p19 only (untransformed leaves are less preferable) as negative controls.Return infiltrated N. benthamiana plants to the growth room, water them, and incubate for 3 days under normal growth conditions.Degradation AssayBefore setting up treatment plates, it is necessary to verify the expression of the reporter proteins.Prepare a black 96-well microplate (low autofluorescence) and add 300 µl dH2O in the wells you are going to use. Excise a single leaf disc from each transformed (and p19 only or untransformed) leaf using a hole punch and place them in a microplate abaxial (i.e., the leaf underside) side up. Read the plate as per section E to identify those leaves that show a good ratio of transformed over p19 (or untransformed) signal, and proceed with these samples (see Notes 2 and 3).Note: This step is critical to identify leaves suitable for the degradation assay (Steps D3-D6). Prepare a 24-well treatment plate for sample harvesting and treatments (Figure 1). Label wells and add 1 ml of freshly prepared 10 µM KAR1, KAR2, rac-GR24, or 0.02% (v/v) acetone control (see Recipe 9) to each well.Excise 5 or 6 leaf discs per leaf per treatment from within the infiltrated region/circle and float them (abaxial side down) on chemical treatments. Place no more than 4 discs in each well.Notes: It is critical to minimize mechanical damage to the leaf during handling (cleanly punch the disc edges and try to avoid the forcep damage). Exclude major veins from the excised discs.",
    "For each construct, we recommend using at least 3 different leaves from independent plants. Also, include multiple negative control leaf discs per treatment. For each leaf, punch out leaf discs at random from lamina on each side of the midrib. When the desired number of leaf discs are collected, they are immediately and randomly transferred to the treatment plates to prevent them from drying. Alternatively, place the discs in distilled water until ready to be transferred. For each construct, randomly allocate discs from the same leaf to different treatments rather than allocating discs from one leaf for one treatment and another leaf to a different treatment. Cover the plate and incubate at room temperature 12-16 h.Note: The plate should be carefully placed in the lab drawer (in the dark) and not allowed to remain on the bench top. Set up a black 96-well microplate with 300 µl dH2O in each well to be used. Transfer one leaf disc per well (abaxial side up) for measurement.Notes: Discard leaf discs that appear translucent (water-logged) or had submerged after overnight treatment.  It is necessary to include negative controls (p19 only or untransformed) on each plate, as these need to be measured with the same gain to perform the background subtraction correctly. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901225005_6506.jpgFigure 1. Workflow for ratiometric measurement of SMAX1 abundance in Nicotiana benthamiana. Schematic of the degradation assay using pRATIO3212-SMAX1 ratiometric reporter system in N. benthamiana.Quantification of fluorescence intensityWe suggest using the following optimized settings on the CLARIOstar plate reader to measure mScarlet-I and Venus fluorescence.Note: It would be possible to use these settings with other dual-fluorescent pRATIO reporters (Khosla et al., 2020a). Basic settingsMeasurement method: Fluorescence intensityReading mode: Well scanningMicroplate type: The CLARIOstar software contains a database with dimensions of microplates from most microplate manufacturers.",
    "In this case, we select “COSTAR BLACK 96” from the pull-down menu.Note: For measuring fluorescence, we recommend using black plates as they absorb light and reduce background and crosstalk. Well scan settingsNote: Well scanning measures different points of a well in a matrix style. The output is an average measurement value of all scan points. Number of flashes per scan point: 8Note: For fluorescence measurements using pRATIO reporters., 8-10 flashes are usually adequate. Increasing the number of flashes also increases the reading time. Scan mode: matrix scanScan matrix dimension: 9 x 9Note: You can use this option to define the matrix size for the scanning procedure and, therefore, the number of measurement (scan) points. Scan width [mm]: 4Note: This value is optimized to reduce the edge effect (see Note 3). Optic settingsNote: We used spectral scanning to identify excitation and emission wavelengths for each fluorescent protein (FP) that produced the strongest signal above background autofluorescence of tobacco leaves (Table 1) (Khosla et al., 2020a).Table 1. Optimal filter settings for tobaccoimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901225541_5000.jpgGain adjustment: For each fluorophore, we performed an automatic gain adjustment on the entire plate before the measurement. The instrument finds the well with the highest intensity and determines an appropriate gain.Notes: The purpose of a gain adjustment is to optimize the signal amplification so that the results have the maximum sensitivity and dynamic range. It is preferred to have the highest gain for each signal coming from the same well. Focal height [mm]: Perform automatic focal height adjustment on the well with the optimal gain (identified above). For a disc floating on 300 μl water, this is typically ~13 mm.General settingsOptic: Top optic usedNote: Top reading relies on measuring reflected light above the wells. For our protocol, we expect top reading to be more sensitive than bottom measurements.",
    "Floating leaf discs on the water in 96 well microplates ensure they do not get soaked and sit at the right height for accurate measurement.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901225958_9563.jpgFigure 2.
