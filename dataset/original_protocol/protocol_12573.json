    "The ethics committee of Ribeirão Preto Medical School University Hospital of the University of São Paulo (HCRP-USP) approved the study (CAAE:14275319.7.0000.5440). The participants signed the consent form, and all procedures were conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Population and sampling\nRecruit participants with BMI >30 kg/m2 for the study. For the present study, 32 women from an admixture population19 between 18 to 60 years old were recruited.\n\tNOTE: In the HCRP-USP, higher rates of obesity were observed mainly in women20. Participants with obesity, with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (n = 15), were recruited from the Metabolic Diseases outpatient clinic in HCRP-USP. The participants without obesity, with BMI between 18.5 kg/m2 and 24.9 kg/m2 (n = 17), were recruited from other clinics and did not have severe diseases; clinical data are shown in Table 1.\nExclude women who are pregnant, nursing mothers, smokers, and consume alcohol.\n2. Anthropometry and body composition\nMeasure the weight of the participants using a 200 kg digital anthropometric scale. Ensure to remove shoes and excess clothing.\nAssess height using a stadiometer with a 0.5 cm graduation. Participants were instructed to stand barefoot, feet together, and arms by their sides21.\nCollect the fat mass (FM) information using an electric bioimpedance. After 12 h of fasting, assess with an empty urinary bladder. Place the participants in the supine position, with legs apart and arms parallel without touching the body. Instruct participants to remove all metal accessories22.\nObtain the waist circumference (WC) using an inextensible measuring tape with a 0.1 mm graduation. The tape was placed horizontally around the middle waist, just above the hip bones. The measurement occurred just after a breath out. According to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), the WC cut-off for women is 88 cm23.",
    "Table 1: Population characteristics. All variables were parametric (p > 0.05, Shapiro Wilk), and differences were evaluated using an Independent t-Test, in which p < 0.05 was considered significant. *p < 0.0001. Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62598/Table 1.xlsx]\n3. Collection of biological material\nCollect peripheral blood after 12 h of fasting, as described previously24.\nCollect 4 mL of the whole blood samples in collection tubes with anticoagulant (e.g., EDTA) and store them on ice for transportation.\n4. DNA extraction\nCentrifuge each tube containing the blood at 2,000 x g for 10 min. Collect around 300 µL of the buffy coat (white interphase).\nExtract DNA from the peripheral blood using a commercially available instrument (see Table of Materials), as described previously25. Elute the DNA in 480 µL of ultrapure H2O.\nAssess DNA concentration and quality using a fluorometer. The integrity was evaluated using a 1% agarose gel analysis25. Store in a freezer at -80 ˚C.\n5. Preparation before methylation analysis\nEnsure that the samples have the minimum DNA concentration (500 ng is the ideal initial input to start), but dilution may vary between samples in this step.\nSome reagents are not included in the microarray kit26, so purchase them separately27.\nCheck if the kit contains all reagents used during the procedure; they are irreplaceable. Check the expiration date of all the reagents. Ensure other reagents and solutions not provided in the kit are also available (95% formamide/1 mM EDTA, 0.1 N NaOH, absolute ethanol, 2-propanol).\n\tCAUTION: Formamide is a volatile reagent; the quality of the results can be improved if the product is fresh. The integrity and quality of formamide and absolute ethanol are considered critical because they can affect the staining process proposed by the manufacturer. The chosen alcohols must be ultrapure products specific for molecular biology analysis.",
    "Once the microarray kit is acquired, download the Chips Decode Maps (DMAPs). Those files are available on the manufacturer's website 24-48 h after the kit is shipped and are excluded on the expiration date28.

    "NOTE: Functional enrichment is used to infer the biological functions of a set of genes.\n\t\nTo enrich data in a string, select the list of targets to enrich and use as input from: https://string-db.org/cgi/input?sessionId=bywt5Gl8Bawy&input_page_active_form\n\t\t=multiple_identifiers\nFor organism, select homo sapiens and press the Search button.\nTo navigate through the enrichment, click on the Analysis button.\nGEO submission\nDeposit the data to a public repository like NCBI's GEO. For this, register for the submitter account.\n\t\tNOTE: Complete the GEO submission (https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/submission/) by downloading the metadata sheet with descriptive information and protocols for the overall experiment and individual samples. GEO archive submissions can be created in any spreadsheet software. Second, add the raw data file generated from the cell-ranger count script for all libraries into the directory. IDAT and associated files or a matrix worksheet contains non-normalized data. The third folder is the processed data files. The matrix table is a spreadsheet containing the final, normalized values comparable across rows and samples and preferably processed as described in any accompanying manuscript.\nPlace processed data files generated from the cell-ranger count script for all libraries into the directory.
