    "Animal handling and preparation prior to audiogenic stressSprague-Dawley rats (males or females), weighing 150-325 g (6-12 weeks of age) upon arrival to the colony, are generally employed. They are housed in a dedicated vivarium facility and grouped four to five in clear polycarbonate cages (48 x 27 x 20 cm) containing floor wood shavings, and covered with wire lids providing food (rat chow) and water ad libitum. Rats are kept on a controlled light/dark cycle (lights on 7:00 AM - off at 7:00 PM), under constant humidity and temperature conditions. Animals are housed for a period of at least 7 days after arrival from the supplier, before any experimental manipulations are conducted.Rats are then singly housed into smaller clear polycarbonate cages (43 x 22 x 20 cm) with similar floor wood shavings and wire lids for food and water. They are handled manually (picking rats up with hands and transferring from hand to hand repeatedly) for a few minutes, adapted to transportation from the vivarium to the experimental room, placed into the sound attenuating chambers for 30 min, and returned immediately to the vivarium upon removal, once a day for five days prior to the experimental manipulations. Procedures are generally performed between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM to reduce variability due to normal circadian hormonal variations. Behavioral proceduresThe behavioral procedures generally consist of placing the entire polycarbonate cage of individual rats in the enclosures between 5:00 and 6:00 PM the afternoon prior to experimental noise exposure the next morning. This approach allows loud noise or background (no) noise treatments on the morning of the experiment without additional disturbances of the animals, as the noise is independently and remotely controlled for each chamber without opening the noise-attenuating chambers (see Video 1).",
    "Loud noise can be administered to rats at intensities ranging from 57-110 dBA (routinely 95-105 dBA), for durations ranging from minutes to hours (routinely 30 min) (see Video 1).Note: It is important to test noise amplitudes in each individual sound attenuating chambers as slight variations in speaker performance can lead to significant sound pressure level differences. These measurements should be performed both before placement and after removal of rats into the sound attenuating chambers (never during the presence of rats!) on a daily basis to ensure consistent sound pressure delivery across days and studies, as equipment failures happen. Ideally, a sound spectral analysis should be performed in individual sound attenuating chambers to ensure similarity of delivered frequency spectra. In our experience, inclusion of the lower frequency spectra (20-2,000 Hz) is necessary to induce significant and reproducible noise-elicited HPA axis responses.     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Loud noise delivery. The video clip provides a demonstration of the main controls available during audiogenic stress exposure in rats. The video clip begins in a background state, without noise or internal lighting. Moderate white noise is then presented (95 dBA), with a demonstration of the lighting being turned on and off. The noise intensity is then increased slowly, and reduced at the end of the clip. A rat’s home cage is present inside the internal enclosure for demonstration purposes.                                                      Immediately upon termination of noise or background exposure, the cages are immediately removed from the sound-attenuating chambers and rats are typically either lightly restrained (rats are gently wrapped in a towel and held by an experimenter on a counter top) for collection of a blood sample from a small tail ‘nick’ that takes less than 2 min, or are euthanized via decapitation for extraction of brain, other organs, and collection of trunk blood.",
    "Rats in repeated loud noise exposure studies are returned to the vivarium, and the above procedures are repeated until the end of the study.Notes: Although exposure of multiple animals to noise in the same housing cage could increase throughput and save time, we have noticed a reduction in HPA axis response and behavior when we have attempted such procedures (unpublished observations), suggesting significant effects of social factors when two or more animals are exposed to loud noise in the same housing cage.Adult female and male rats display similar HPA axis responses to audiogenic stress across multiple acute and repeated exposure protocols (Babb et al., 2013; 2014). Therefore, this stressor modality does not appear to provide an efficient approach to study sex differences in rats.It is good practice to verify the opening of the ear canal/external auditory meatus in all rats to be included in audiogenic stress studies, as we have encountered some rats from various vendors to have closed canals, and could therefore not be exposed appropriately to the intended sound pressure level. Simple visual inspection of the external auditory meatuses is easily performed during the initial handling of rats.Related to above, when animals need to undergo craniotomy using a stereotaxic apparatus, it is important to employ ‘blunt’ earbars (45° as opposed to the 18° angle typically provided) so as to keep the tympanic membranes intact; use of typical pointed earbars (18° angle) can easily rupture tympanic membranes and can induce significant variability in the sound pressure levels experienced by rats during loud noise exposure."
