    "A. Cartilage Biopsy (Surgery Room; Steps 1-5 in Non-sterile Preparation Room)\nPerform a final weight control of the rabbit (New Zealand White rabbit, female, 3.5-4.0 kg body weight, 6 months old) in order to be able to dose drugs properly and to monitor weight subsequent to surgery.\nInduce anesthesia to the rabbit by an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg propofol.\nAfter intubation, maintain anesthesia with 1.5 mg/kg/min propofol and 0.05 mg/kg fentanyl intravenously. Monitor anesthesia by using capnography, pulse oximetry and pulse rate.\nShave the knee to be operated on with an electric clipper and vacuum the fur.\nDisinfect the shaved knee thoroughly and cover the rest of the rabbit with a sterile dressing.\nPalpate the patella and perform a skin incision medially of the patella.\nOpen the knee joint by a medial parapatellar arthrotomy under sterile conditions. Try to avoid cutting any small superficial blood vessels.\nDisplace the patella laterally.\nInspect the knee joint for any anomalies and macroscopic cartilage lesions.\nCarefully peel small cartilage pieces (2-3 mm) out of the trochlea ossis femoris with a sterile scalpel (Figure 1).\nImmediately place these cartilage biopsies into a 50 ml tube with complete medium (DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep)) to continue with the in vitro culture right after the operation.\nClean the defects and rinse them with sterile saline.\nReposition the patella within the trochlea groove.\nWound closure in layers with single button sutures (4-0 Vicryl) and a continuing cutaneous suture (4-0 Monocryl). Use absorbable suture material.\nFinally, seal the wound with a spray dressing permeable to water vapor.\nB. In vitro Culture\nProcess the biopsied cartilage pieces as soon as possible after the operation in a sterile laminar flow tissue culture hood.",
    "Wash the sterile harvested cartilage 2x in PBS with subsequent centrifugation at 500 x g for 3 min at RT.\nCut cartilage in pieces of 1 mm3, transfer to a 50 ml falcon and digest them on a shaker for 30 min with 10 ml trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) and 10 ml PBS for 30 min\nAfter 30 min, stop trypsinization by adding complete medium. Then, shake the cartilage pieces for another for 12 hr with Collagenase A (0.21 U/mg) in serum free medium (DMEM + 1% Pen/Strep).\nCentrifuge the resulting solution at 170 x g for 3 min at RT.\nResuspend cell pellets in 5 ml complete medium.\nSeed the isolated chondrocytes on to 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks in 5 ml complete medium and keep in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nGrow chondrocytes to a density of 80%.\nRelease the cells from flasks by washing in PBS 2x before exposing to 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 3 min. Once chondrocytes detach, stop trypsinization by addition of 10 μl complete medium.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 300 x g (3 min) and resuspend pellet in complete medium.\nSeed cells in tissue culture flasks (75 cm2) and split at a ratio of 1:3 (∼5,000 cells/cm2) every 5th day or upon 80% confluency.\nDetermine cell numbers and viability by trypan blue staining.\nC. Cell-seeding of the Matrix\nPrior to implantation wash and release cells as described above. Perform cell count and transfer 5 x 104 cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Then centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend pellet in 15 μl complete medium for a complete saturation of the matrix.\nCut the bilayer collagen scaffold to the exact dimensions of the trochlear defect by a sterile biopsy punch.",
    "Place matrix into an appropriately sized tissue culture dish (e.g. 24-well plates).\nSeed cells onto the porous, cell-adhesive side of the matrix. This deters cell migration away from the matrix.\nLeave cell-seeded matrices without further cell culture medium within an incubator for 1 hr to allow full adherence of the chondrocytes.\nThen, place cell-matrix-constructs into culturing containers (e.g. 24-well plates) with fresh complete medium. Take care not to wash out any cells off the matrix even though strong adherence is expected.\nNow, cell-matrix-constructs can be taken to the surgery room for re-implantation.\nD. Matrix-assisted Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation\nPerform parapatellar arthrotomy to the contralateral knee as described above (A. 1-8).\nCreate two isolated chondral defects in the trochlear groove with a sterile air operating power drill (3.6 mm in diameter).\nClean the defect and rinse with sterile saline.\nAttention should be paid not to open the marrow cavity at any time. If necessary, seal the bottom of the defects with electrical cautery against bleeding.\nImplant the matrices seeded with the cultured chondrocytes with the porous side face down (Figure 2). Then press-fit into the drill holes and flush the surrounding surface.\nSeal the implanted matrices with a little bit of fibrin glue (Tissucol Duo S) to assure secure fixation.\nAfter clotting, relocate the patella within the trochlear groove and apply full range of motion to the knee joint a few times.\nDisplace the patella laterally once again and check for any event or sign of instable fixation. The matrices must be held still in place.\nReplace the patella again and finish the operation with wound closure in layers and spray dressing as described above.\nSubscription Required.
