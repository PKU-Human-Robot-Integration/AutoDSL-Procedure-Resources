    "Assay PreparationsPurify 10-15 mg/ml MSMEG_5795 and 20-40 mg/ml MurI2Ba protein using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography.Note: Determine the mycobacterial protein concentration using the PierceTM Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Centrifuge both proteins at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any aggregates prior to being assayed.  Prepare all stock solutions for the assays (see Recipes). D-amino acid transaminase reactionPrepare desired volume of the D-AAT assay reaction partial mixture containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM α-ketoglutarate, 0.15 mM PLP, 5 U L-lactate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mM NADH and 77 nM MSMEG_5795 protein. For example, 20 ml is a convenient amount to make here. As noted above the NADH is prepared fresh each day before conducting the assay.Note: Keep assay mix on ice during assay and equilibrate to room temperature before use.  Transfer 950 µl of the reaction mixture to a 1 ml quartz cuvette and pre-incubate at 30 °C for 5 min.Measure the absorbance at 340 nm for 2 min to set a baseline on the UltrospecTM 3100 pro. To start the reaction, add 50 µl 0.5 M D-alanine substrate to the assay mix to a final concentration of 25 mM to start the reaction and incubate each cuvette for 20, 40 and 60 min at 30 °C. The absorbance should be decreasing with time.Add 50 µl water instead of substrate to the negative control sample and incubate for 60 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, transfer the cuvettes immediately to 4 °C to halt the reaction. Filter the reaction mix using a Vivaspin 2 protein concentrator spin column with MWCO of 10,000 Da to remove MSMEG_5795 and L-lactate dehydrogenase. Use this protein-free output as a substrate for the subsequent glutamate racemase (MurI) activity assay.",
    "Note: Samples can be stored at -20 °C before second coupled enzyme assay is performed or for further analysis.  Glutamate racemase reactionPrepare desired volume of MurI assay reaction partial mixture containing 50 mM CHES pH 9.2, 5 mM NAD+, 37.5 U ml-1 L-glutamate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mM ADP, 0.65 mM INT, 2 U ml-1 diaphorase. For example, 10 ml is a convenient amount to make here. Note: Mix assay components vigorously in a glass beaker, but avoid foaming by using a small stir bar and magnetic stirrer. Filter mixture with a 0.45 µm syringe filter and a 20 ml syringe with a Luer-Lok tip. Keep solution on ice during assay. Equilibrate to room temperature before use. This solution will take on a light salmon hue. For each reaction sample, transfer 875 µl of the reaction mixture to a 1 ml quartz cuvette. Add 100 µl of the product coming from the D-AAT assay to each cuvette. Start the reaction by adding 25 µl MurI2Ba to a final enzyme concentration of 10 µM. To the blank sample, add the buffer used for the MurI2Ba stock solution in place of MurI2Ba and add water instead of substrate. Add water instead of substrate to the negative control sample. Monitor the absorbance at 500 nm for 30 min at 30 °C. Note: Subtract the absorbance values obtained from the blank sample from each measurement to obtain the final absorbance values."
