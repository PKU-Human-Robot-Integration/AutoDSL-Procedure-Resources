    "Biomass preparation-organic solvent washPre-freeze and freeze-dry lignocellulosic biomass (time may vary depending on sample source (for whole Miscanthus spp. tillers the samples were freeze-dried for an excess of 7 days to ensure complete dryness).Grind tissues to a particle size in the range 0.18-0.85 mm (suggested equipment: IKA A11 Handheld Analytical Mill; sieves with mesh sizes of 80 and 20 µm).Weigh approximately 1 g of the ground plant biomass into a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube.Add 30 ml 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer and leave in a shaking incubator set at 40 °C/150 rpm for 12 h.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant by decantation or aspiration.Add 30 ml 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, mix using a vortex mixer, but this time incubate the samples for 30 min at 40 °C/150 rpm.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.Repeat steps A6-7.Add 20 ml of the chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) solution, mix to re-suspend the pellet and leave in a shaking incubator for 30 min at 25 °C and 150 rpm.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant after the chloroform/methanol wash.Repeat steps A9-10 twice.Add 15 ml of acetone, mix to re-suspend the pellet and leave in a shaking incubator for 30 min at 25 °C and 150 rpm.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant after the acetone wash.Repeat steps A12-13 twice.Let the organic-washed biomass samples dry overnight in a fume hood (alternatively they can be left in an oven set at 35 °C for approximately 16 h). Biomass preparation-starch removalRe-suspend the dry, organic solvent-extracted biomass in 15 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0).",
    "Heat for 20 min at 80 °C in a heating block to induce starch gelatinisation.Cool suspensions on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet twice with 30 ml H2O, with centrifugation (900 x g for 10 min) and supernatant removal after each wash.Add to the pellet the following reagents: 10 ml 0.1 M ammonium formate buffer (pH 6.0), 10 μl type-I porcine α-amylase (47 units per 100 mg cell wall) and 500 µl 0.001 M sodium azide solution.Leave in a shaking incubator for 48 h at 25 °C/110 rpm.Terminate the digestion by heating to 95 °C/15 min.Cool samples on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet three times with 30 ml H2O and twice with 20 ml acetone, with centrifugation (900 x g for 10 min) and supernatant removal after each wash.Let the prepared cell wall material samples dry overnight in a fume hood (alternatively they can be left in an oven set at 35 °C for approximately 16 h; the samples are stable for months at room temperature if kept in a sealed container and protected from direct light).Biomass examination-Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopyWithout further preparation, place approximately 10 mg of the dry cell wall powder onto the Golden Gate ATR crystal.Press the sample into optimal contact with the ATR crystal using the anvil of the Golden Gate ATR accessory.Collect spectra in duplicate for each biomass sample Note: Each spectrum is collected by ATR in a mid-infrared range of 4,000-600 cm-1 and consists of the average over 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm-1. Spectra were corrected for background absorbance by subtraction of the spectrum of the empty ATR crystal.",
    "Recover the sample using a spatula or a razor blade (Video 1).Clean the contact areas with a laboratory tissue wipe and ethanol between samples.Repeat steps C1-5 for all samples. Convert each collected spectrum into an individual text file containing the spectral two dimensional Cartesian coordinates (x, y) (Figure 1) in two separate columns (we used the Bruker OPUS IR spectroscopy software). Subsequently, matrices containing the raw data may be created and the underlying relationships between the spectra may be investigated using numerical or statistical computing software (such as R or MATLAB). As an example, we used PCA to identify the features most distinctive of spectra collected from Miscanthus spp. leaf and stem cell wall biomass (Figure 2).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1.
