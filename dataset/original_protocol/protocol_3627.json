    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProcessing and digesting the adipose tissue\nTiming: [1–2 h]\nDuring this step, the adipose tissue is processed and digested. This isolates the stromal vascular fraction cells from the extracellular matrix whilst ensuring their viability.\nWeigh the adipose tissue and add 2 mL of ice-cold Wash/Digestion buffer per gram of sample.\nNote: If samples are <1g, add 2 mL of ice-cold Wash/Digestion and continue with all steps.\nNote: If the adipose tissue weighs up to 2 g then we suggest using 7 mL bijou tubes. However, if the samples exceed 2 g then use larger tubes (e.g., 15 mL tubes) or split the sample into two smaller tubes and weigh each separately.\nUsing sterile scissors, mince the adipose tissue and add 200 μL Collagenase II (2844 U) and 2.5 μL DNase (27.75 U) per mL of Wash/Digestion buffer.\nCritical: Always check LOT number and corresponding enzymatic activity in Units per mg when making up the Collagenase II and DNase stock solutions, as this will vary. As a result, it is not practical to state the enzyme concentrations in mg/mL as we must standardise to U/mL.\nCritical: Ensure at this point that all the adipose tissue is floating. Any tissue present sinking to the bottom of the tube is likely to be non-adipose tissue and should be removed.\nNote: Store the Collagenase II and DNase enzyme stock solutions in small aliquots to minimise the effect of repeated freeze/thaw cycles, which will decrease the enzymatic activity.\nPlace samples in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and 225 rpm for 25–30 min.\nNote: Digested samples should look homogeneous and pinkish white in colour, larger samples can take slightly longer than smaller samples (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Transfer the samples through a 100 μm cell sieve into a 50 mL tube pre-washed with ice cold Wash/Digestion buffer. Then top up the Falcon tube to 30 mL with Wash/Digestion buffer.\nNote: Ensure you rinse the sample tube used for digestion with Wash/Digestion buffer to remove any remaining sample and strain through the same 100 μm cell sieve.\nCentrifuge samples at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCritical: After centrifugation, open the tubes and check that the floating portion of the sample is composed of transparent lipid droplets. If you can see a white layer of adipose tissue floating, then this top layer will need removing with a Pasteur pipette and re-digestion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Re-digest in 2 mL Wash/Digestion buffer, with half the original collagenase volume used i.e., 200 μL Collagenase II in 2 mL Wash/Digestion buffer, with 5 μL DNase for 10 min (as in step 3). This will ensure you obtain all the stromal cells possible, particularly macrophages, from within each sample.\nDiscard supernatant and the remaining pellet contains the stromal vascular fraction cells.\nNote: Proceed directly to wash step 8 if you will use bead enrichment (recommended), otherwise carry out red blood cell lysis described in step 7.\nOptional: Resuspend pellets in 500 μl of red blood cell lysis buffer (ACK Lysis Buffer) for about 1 min.\nTop up with ice cold Wash/Digestion buffer and transfer the samples through a 70 μm cell sieve into a 50 mL tube pre-washed with Wash/Digestion buffer. Then fill the tube to the top with Wash/Digestion buffer.\nCentrifuge samples at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and the remaining pellet contains the stromal vascular fraction cells.\nMagnetic bead enrichment of conventional dendritic cells (recommended)\nTiming: 30–45 min",
    "This step enriches cells from the population of interest within a sample and as a result can change for any given experiment. We recommend this step is completed to reduce time required for flow cytometry assisted cell sorting. In this example we enrich live cells from the stromal vascular fraction of mouse adipose tissue followed by positive enrichment of CD11c + cells to increase the relative proportion of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) within our samples (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/552-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Bead enrichment and flow cytometry gating strategy for isolation of conventional dendritic cell subsets from mouse adipose tissue\n(A) The beneficial effects of magnetic bead enrichment (dead cell removal and CD11c+ enrichment) on live cells and conventional dendritic cell populations within a sample.\n(B) An example flow cytometry gating strategy for the isolation of conventional dendritic cell subsets (cDC1 and cDC2). Note that stromal vascular fractions taken from mouse adipose tissue were pooled (to increase yield) and cDCs expressing a Zbtb46-GFP reporter are shown in this example.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in ice cold 1× binding buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) containing Dead Cell Removal MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 200 μL per 107 cells and follow manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: Transferring the sample into fresh tubes at this stage prevents excess lipids which are stuck to the inside of the previous tube from affecting the sample.\nNote: We use twice the concentration recommended by the manufacturer for dead cell removal, as there is a higher abundance of dead cells compared to cDCs (our cells of interest).\nThe effluent from the magnetic column is your live cell enriched population. Top-up these tubes with MACs buffer and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in ice cold MACs buffer containing CD11c MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) following manufacturer’s instructions. Depending on adipose tissue site and metabolic status, a total of 105 to 106 CD45+ cells/g of fat are expected.\nThe sample you are left with is a single cell suspension enriched for live cells and CD11c+ cells. Proceed to next step.\nOptional: You can change these enrichment steps to suit your experiment. However, you may need to optimise bead concentrations.\nExtracellular staining and cell sorting\nDuring this step, you isolate a particular cell population of interest from the stromal vascular fraction by flow cytometry assisted cell sorting. Alternatively, if you do not need to obtain pure cell suspensions, you can add experimental readout markers and analyze the cells present in the stromal vascular fraction directly by regular flow cytometry.\nTake single cell suspensions and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cell pellets in 75 μL of PBS containing diluted fluorescently conjugated extracellular antibody markers following manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for examples of immune cell populations isolated from human and mouse adipose tissues and their gating strategies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/552-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example flow cytometry gating strategy for quantifying immune cell populations from digested adipose tissues\nLymphocyte populations (A) and myeloid populations (B) analyzed from the stromal vascular fraction of human adipose tissue via multi-color flow cytometry.\nIncubate cells in the dark at 4°C for 18 min.\nAdd ice cold PBS and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend pellet in ice cold MACs buffer as a wash and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend pellet in a small volume of MACs buffer and proceed to flow cytometry assisted cell sorting.",
    "Note: We usually resuspend cells taken from one mouse in around 500 μL for cell sorting on either a BD FACS Aria II or a BD FACS fusion cell sorter."
