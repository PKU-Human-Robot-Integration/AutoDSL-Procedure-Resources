    "Preparation of SNL feeder plates\nDay 0:\n1. Gelatinise plates by adding 1 ml, 0.5 ml and 100 µl per well of 0.1% gelatin to a 6-well, 24-well and 96-well plate respectively and leave the plates at room temperature for 1 hour.\n  2. Thaw frozen mitomycin-C treated SNL feeder cells from liquid nitrogen in a 37°C water bath.\n  3. Centrifuge the cryotube for 3 minutes @ 1200 rpm.\n  4. Aspirate gelatin from new plates.\n  5. Add M10 media to the new plates.\n  a. 3 ml/well for 6-well plate.\nb. 1 ml/well for 24-well plate.\nc. 200 μl/well for 96-well plate\n6. Carefully remove the supernatant and re-suspend cell pellet in fresh M10.\n  7. Equally distribute cell suspension between new plates and shake to ensure even distribution. The plating density of feeder cells should be approximately 8.4 x 104 / cm2.\n  8. Place feeder plates in incubator at 37°C with 95% air and 5% CO2.\n  \nDay 1:\n9. Feeder plates are ready for use.\n  10. Aspirate M10 and add EPSCM to feeder plates.\n  a. 2 ml/well for 6-well plate.\nb. 500 μl /well for 24-well plate.\nc. 200 μl/well for 96-well plate.\n11. Allow plates to equilibrate in incubator prior to cell plating.\n  \nEmbryo preparation\n1. For the production of 4-cell or 8-cell embryos, CD1 or C57B6 females older than 8 weeks of age are superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin 7.5 IU each.\n  2. This is followed 46-48 hours later by injection of human Chorionic Gonadotropin 7.5 IU each, and these are then mated to proven studs. \n  3. Vaginal plugs are checked the following morning \\(0.5 days post coitum, dpc). \n  4. 4-cell to 8-cell embryos are collected at 2.5 dpc by flushing the oviduct and the uterine cavity, respectively.",
    "5. Embryos are cultured in 1.0 ml KSOM medium containing 3.0 g/ml bovine serum albumin in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. \n  \nDerivation of EPSC lines from whole 8C-stage embryos \n6. Each 8-cell embryo is transferred to one well of a 96-well SNL feeder plate or a gelatinized plate in EPSCM. \n  7. Embryos are cultured in EPSCM for over 8 days until embryos hatch and form outgrowths. Until the embryos have attached media change is performed by the addition of fresh EPSCM to each well every 48-72 hours. Once outgrowth has attached, the media can be aspirated with the addition of fresh EPSCM.\n  8. To dissociate the outgrowth aspirate media from the wells and wash once with DPBS. Add Accutase 50 μl / well for a 96 well plate and place plate in incubator for 5 minutes. To assist in the dissociation gently pipette up anddown and across the plate. \n  9. Following confirmation of dissociation under the microscope, add 50 μl EPSCM \\(equal volume to that of Accutase) to each well.\n  10. Transfer the 100 μl cell suspension \\(50 μl Accutase + 50μl EPSCM) to a new pre-prepared 96-well SNL feeder plate or a gelatinized plate containing pre-equilibrated EPSCM.\n  11. After 2-3 days, EPSC colonies will reach 80-90% confluence and are subsequently passaged into a 24 well SNL feeder plate or gelatinized plate and then expanded into 6 well plates. \n  12. For passaging from 24 well and 6 well plates, aspirate the media and wash once with DPBS. \n  13. Add Accutase 200 μl /well for a 24-well plate or 500 μl /well for a 6-well plate.",
    "14. As before, place the plate in the incubator for 5 minutes and subsequently assist the dissociation with gentle pipetting. Following addition of an equal volume of EPSCM, transfer the cell suspension to a 15-ml falcon tube and centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm.\n  15. Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend in EPSCM.\n  16. Plate cells \\(if required, counting can be performed at this point).\n  Anticipated Results - Using SNL feeder layer, the EPSC derivation efficiency is close to 100%, whereas only about 20% will be achieved if embryos are plated in a gelatinized plate.  See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for a representative temporal progression of 8-cell embryos in EPSCM.\nDerivation of EPSC lines from single 8C-stage blastomeres \n1. Before separating the blastomeres, the 4-cell to 8-cell embryos are cultured in 1.0 mL KSOM containing 3.0 mg/mL BSA and 7.5 μg CB for at least half an hour. \n  2. The embryos are then suspended in 100 μl Tyrode’s Solution to wash away KSOM media. \n  3. The embryos are then transferred into and suspended in a new 100 μl drop of Tyrode’s Solution.\n  4. Immediately after the zona pellucida has dissolved in Tyrode’s Solution, the embryos are transferred into a 100 μl M2 drop. \n  5. The embryos are washed a few times in M2 drops. \n  6. The embryos are then sucked and blown a few times by a blunt needle \\(inner diameter: 40 μm). \n  7. The individual blastomeres are now collected. \n  8. For derivation of EPSC line from a single blastomere, individual blastomeres are plated into a 96-well plate on SNL feeders \\(one blastomere per well).",
    "9. The progress of blastomeres is monitored daily. As with preimplantation embryo culture, until the blastomere has attached, add fresh media to the well every 48-72 hours. Once attached, media can be carefully aspirated with the addition of fresh EPSCM.\n  10. At around day 7, some small cell clusters form and the cells continue to proliferate to form EPSC colony-like outgrowths.\n  11. By day 12, colonies are dissociated with Accutase and transferred into a new 96 well SNL feeder plate. \n  12. The cells are further expanded in 24-well and 6-well SNL feeder plates. \n  Anticipated Results: The derivation efficiency on SNL feeders is approximately 28.1% \\(9/32). See Figure 1a in the associated publication for a representative temporal progression of a single blastomere in EPSCM.\nConversion of mouse ESCs / iPSCs to EPSCs\nDay 0\n1. mESCs / miPSCs are plated on mitomycin C-inactivated SNL feeder cells in their original medium \\(N2B27-2i/LIF or M15) at a low plating density \\(1 x 103 cells / cm2).\n  Day 1\n2. Medium is switched to EPSCM and is changed daily.\n  \nDay 3/4\n3. Cells are passaged every 3–4 days at a 1:3 ratio.\n  4. As described above this is by a brief DPBS wash followed by single-cell dissociation using Accutase.\n  Anticipated Results: After 5 passages, which takes approximately 15 days, the cells will functionally have acquired expanded potential. \nNote #1: In the associated publication, to detect the presence of EPSCs and conventional ESCs in chimeras, cells were made to express a CAG-mCherry, EF-1α-H2BmCherry or CAG-H2BmCherry expression cassette by PiggyBac transposon transposition using Amaxa nucleofection \\(Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for mouse ESCs \\(mESC A-023).",
    "Note #2: Following plating of a single Rex1-GFP ESC on SNL feeders, the number of REX1-GFP positive colonies formed in EPSCM and in their original media \\(M15 or 2i/LIF) were comparable indicating that EPSCM was permissive for mouse ESCs and did not select for a rare subpopulation of cells. See Figure 3 for representative examples of colony morphology on feeders and in feeder free conditions.\nCryopreservation of EPSCs\n1. Feed cells 2-3 hours before freezing.\n  2. Move all media to room temperature to warm up 20 minutes before starting.\n  3. Remove media from the plate and wash once with DPBS.\n  4. Remove DPBS and add Accutase to the plate.\n  5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 5 minutes.\n  6. Tap the plate on the side to detach the cells from the plate.\n  7. Add fresh EPSCM of equal volume to that of Accutase.\n  8. Dissociate EPSCs by pipetting up and then down across the plate.\n  9. Transfer cell suspension to a new falcon tube.\n  10. Centrifuge the tube for 3 minutes @ 1200 rpm.\n  11. Carefully remove supernatant and re-suspend cell pellet in 500 μl freezing media.\n  12. Transfer 500 μl of cell suspension to each labelled cryotube.\n  13. Transfer tubes to freezing pot and store at -80°C for 24 hours.\n  14. After 24 hours transfer tubes to -180°C liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\n  \nCryorecovery of EPSCs\nDay -1: \n1. Prepare SNL feeder plates.\n  \nDay 0\n2. Move media to room temperature to warm up 20 minutes before starting.\n  3. Transfer a vial of frozen cells to the 37°C water bath.\n  4. Once thawed, briefly centrifuge the tube to collect the pellet at the base of the cryotube.\n  5. Transfer the contents of the cryotube to a 50-ml falcon tube containing 15 ml of warmed EPSCM.",
    "6. Centrifuge for 3 minutes @ 1200 rpm.\n  7. Carefully remove supernatant and re-suspend cell pellet in EPSCM.\n  8. Plate cells.\n  \nDay 1\n9. 24 hours after thawing, change media to EPSCM.\n  10. Change media every day until the cells are ready to be passaged."
