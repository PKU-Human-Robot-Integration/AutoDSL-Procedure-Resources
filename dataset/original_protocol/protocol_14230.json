    "Rules governed by German legislation for animal studies as well as Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (National Institutes of Health publication ed. 8, 2011) were followed. Official permission is granted from the governmental animal care office (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Recklinghausen, Germany).\n1. Animals\nUse female German landrace pigs (weighing 25-30 kg) housed in open cages.\nUse 5 animals per group (argon and helium).\nAllow the animals to acclimatize to the surroundings for at least one week before the experiments. Fast animals for 24 h prior to surgery with free access to water.\n2. Anesthesia\nPremedicate the animals with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (15 mg/kg body weight [BW]), xylazine (10 mg/kg BW), and atropine (0.1 mg/kg BW) 10 min before induction of anesthesia.\nPeripheral venous access is established by placement of a 22-gauge cannula into an ear vein.\nInduce general anesthesia by i.v. injection of propofol 2 mg/kg body weight.\nPlace the animal in the supine position and perform a longitudinal skin incision in the jugular groove over a length of 2 cm. Locate vein through the blunt preparation of the subcutaneous tissue. Insert cannula, then Seldinger wire.\nRetract cannula and insert 14 Fr. catheter over the guide wire. Retract guide wire. Connect catheter to the extension and fixate the catheter by a strap or a suture.\nPull out the tongue and insert straight laryngoscope. Use the tip of the laryngoscope to pull down the epiglottis. Insert the tube through the vocal cords. Place cuff under glottis and inflate.\nVentilate with 40% oxygen at 20-26 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg to keep the end-tidal partial carbon dioxide tension between 36 and 42 mm Hg.\nMaintain anesthesia with isoflurane at a concentration of 1-1.5% and fentanyl at a concentration of 3-4 µg/kg/h.",
    "Supply Ringer's lactate solution at an initial rate of 4 mL/kg/h, and increase after laparotomy to a constant infusion rate of 8 mL/kg/h.\n3. Surgery and Plasma Coagulation\nPlace the animal in a supine position on a standard surgical table.\nDisinfect skin by applying a standard surgical disinfectant (2-Propanol 45 g /100 g, 1-Propanol 10 g / 100g, Biphenyl-2-ol 0.2 g / 100 g) with a surgical swab for 3 times.\nPerform a wide midline laparotomy from the xiphoid process to the pubis with a scalpel and install surgical retractors.\nSwitch on the plasma coagulation device, open argon or helium gas bottle, depending on the used carrier gas. Adjust gas flow to 3 L/min. Select coagulation device output power as desired.\n\tNOTE: Both noble gases, Argon or Helium, can be used for plasma coagulation. Coagulation effects are comparable. See reference7 for details.\nPerform plasma coagulation on the left liver lobe as previously described7. Use a titanium mold (square aperture 1 x 1 cm2) to standardize the coagulation zone. Coagulate for 5 s with a probe distance of 1 cm. The coagulations with different power settings can be performed side by side with a short distance between the coagulations of 5 mm (Figure 1).\nFor harvesting of the liver, divide all ligamentous connections to the liver. Isolate and divide the hepatic pedicle above the superior duodenal flexure leaving long portions of portal vein and common bile duct. Divide the caval vein above and below the liver and retrieve the organ.\nAfter harvesting the liver, the pigs were euthanized by i.v. administration of 0.16 g/kg BW pentobarbital.\nFor the burst pressure experiments, resect half of the left medial liver lobe with sharp scissors. Plasma-coagulate the cut surface (100W output power) or seal the cut surface with fibrin sealant (Figure 2).",
    "4. Microcirculation Measurement\nNOTE: Laser Doppler spectroscopy can determine blood flow in tissue through measuring the Doppler shift caused by the movement of erythrocytes. The Laser signal correlates with the number of moving erythrocytes. Laser Doppler spectroscopy is in clinical use (e.g. transplant medicine) and has been validated multiple times15.\nSwitch on the laser Doppler flowmeter and spectrophotometer. Use a flat probe.\nTake baseline measurements for flow and velocity. Save or note the values.\nPerform coagulation as described under 3.5.\nPlace the flat probe on coagulation sites and measure flow and velocity. Again, save or note values.\nRepeat for all power settings of the coagulator device.\n5. Temperature Measurement\nSwitch the system on (thermographic camera, notebook, and infrared thermometer) and let it run for at least 1 h before performing measurements.\nAdjust focus and view frame on the thermographic camera on the coagulation site. Infrared sequences can be detected with the spatial resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels with a temperature resolution bigger than 20 mK. Take into account, that the region of coagulation and the surrounding tissue — affected by heat transfer — is located in the middle of the view.\n\tNOTE: It should include as many pixels of the frame as possible for an optimal spatial resolution.\nRecord coagulation process with the plasma coagulator on the liver surface with the thermographic camera over a 2-min period.\nAnalyze image sequences with the thermography analysis software: Define regions of interest.\n\tNOTE: Software calculates the course of corresponding mean temperature over time.\n6. Coagulation Depth Measurement\nHarvest the left medial liver lobe with sharp scissors.\nExcise the coagulation sites with 1 cm thickness. Cut into 3 mm thick longitudinal segments for further processing.",
    "Fix tissue samples at 4 ° C overnight with neutral 10% buffered formalin. Heat paraffin 2 °C over the melting point and embed slices. Process overnight.\nPerform Hematoxylin/Eosin staining.\n\t\nDeparaffinize and hydrate the tissue by subsequently dipping in 2x Xylene, 100% ethanol (EtOH), 95% EtOH, 70% EtOH, deionized H2O for 2 min each.\nStain the tissue sample with Meyer's Hematoxylin solution for 3 min.\nNow rinse in tap water for 5 min.\nStain the tissue with Eosin solution for 3 min.\nRinse in 2x EtOH 95% and then Xylene for 3 min each. Mount with the standard mounting medium.\nSwitch the system on (microscope connected camera, imaging software). View all sections with 40X magnification.\nTake an image of an object micrometer at a magnification of 40X. Press Recalibrate button in the Objectives window. Select manual calibration. Draw a line on the micrometer image of 100 µm. Enter 0,1 mm in the dialog box and press OK.\nSelect Length in the View>Analysis Controls>Annotations and Measurements window. Measure from the liver surface to the coagulation margin with the mouse. Export or note the result. Repeat measurement on another location on the same slide.\n\tNOTE: Coagulation depth can easily be differentiated from the normal liver tissue by the sharp margin between the normal hepatocyte cords and the zone of necrosis with shrunken cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei, and hemorrhage zones.\nCalculate mean out of two measurements.\n7. Burst Pressure Measurement\nSwitch the system on (automatic pumps, pressure meter). Prepare the liver samples according to the step 3.7.\n\tNOTE: Use two parallel pumps connected via a 3-way-stopcock. The maximal pressure of 1,500 mm Hg cannot be obtained with a single pump.",
    "Isolate portal vein, common hepatic artery and bile duct with scissors in the haptic pedicle. Clamp portal vein with an overholt forceps and ligate with a monofil suture 4-0. Clamp common hepatic artery an overholt forceps and ligate with a monofil suture 4-0.\nInsert Ch-16 catheter into the common bile duct and ligate with a 2-0 silk suture. Connect the catheter to the automatic pumps, install 3-way stopcock with pressure meter (Figure 3).\nFill the perfusion syringe with saline.\nStart automatic pumps with a delivery rate of 99 mL/h.\nMonitor liver cut surface and pressure meter for leakage and record burst pressure.\n\tNOTE: For easier recognition of leakage, patent blue can be added to saline (2 mL patent blue + 18 mL saline). It is easier to observe burst pressure by noticing the time of loss of pressure on the pressure meter.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
