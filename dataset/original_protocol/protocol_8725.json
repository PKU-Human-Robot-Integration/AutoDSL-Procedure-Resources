    "The construction and technical details of Flywalk have been described elsewhere26 (in case of any problems of establishing this set up, further information can be obtained from MK). Here we focus on detailed instructions on the handling of the paradigm that will help to obtain reliable results.\n1. Fly Handling\nRear flies in low to medium density cultures on food medium27 under a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark regime at 23-25 °C and 70% relative humidity. To this end, allow 20-30 newly emerged adult flies to reproduce in a big food vial for 1 week, then discard adult flies and wait for offspring to emerge.\nCollect 30-40 newly emerged (age <24 hr) adult flies and age them on in new a vial containing food medium27 for 3-5 days.\nTwenty-four hr before the start of the behavioral experiment: Transfer all 30-40 previously collected 3-5 d old (see 2.2) flies to a new vial containing a moist rubber foam plug or a moist tissue paper using an aspirator.\n\tNOTE: Do not anaesthetize flies using CO2.\n2. Preparation of the Flywalk Setup \nUse 250 ml bottles as humidifiers. Fill humidifiers with 100 ml of distilled water.\nPrepare odor vials.\n\t\nPrepare 500 µl 10-3 dilutions of the pure odors ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, isopentyl acetate and 2,3-butanedione in the solvent mineral oil.\nAttach two ball check valves per odor vial. Note that check valves allow for uni-directional airflow only. Therefore, connect check valves in such a way that air can enter the vial on one side and leave it on the other side.\nRemove the lid of a 200 µl PCR reaction tube. Pipette 100 µl of every odor dilution into a separate reaction tube and place the tubes in separate odor vials. Also prepare one odor vial containing only the solvent mineral oil.",
    "Tightly seal the odor vials by closing them using stainless steel plugs and rubber gaskets.\nConnect the 5 odor vials (4 containing odors and 1 containing mineral oil) to the odor delivery system. Make sure to connect them in the right flow direction. A wrong connection will not only compromise the planned experiment, but it may also contaminate the delivery system. \nCheck for leaks by sealing the outlet of the mixing chamber of the stimulus device. Make sure, that all airflows before the stimulus device now progressively drop to zero. If not, check for leaks which can now be identified by the hissing sound of air leaving the system.\nCarefully transfer 15 individual flies to 15 individual glass tubes using an aspirator and close glass tubes on both sides using the corresponding adapters. \n\tNote: Because the system must be hermetically sealed for successful experiments, ensure that adapters fit glass tubes tightly and note that glass tubes may break during this step. Take care to avoid injuries by wearing protective gloves and goggles.\nConnect the glass tubes to the Flywalk setup and, from here on, wait for at least 15 min before starting the experiment to allow flies to habituate to the new environment.\nAfter attaching glass tubes: check the readout of the downstream digital flow meters on computer 1 if the 16 airflows after the glass tubes add up to the airflow entering the system. Also check on computer 1, if humidity is between 60% and 80%.",
    "Design stimulus protocol controlling the sequence and timing of odor stimuli presented to the flies. To obtain e.g. the described data, present 4 odors and the control (mineral oil) singly and all possible ternary and the quarternary mixtures of the odors simultaneously for 40 times each. Set pulse duration to 500 msec at an interstimulus interval of 90 sec and randomize stimulus sequence.\nSwitch on the light source (LED-cluster; λ = 630). Make sure to provide enough light for efficient tracking without increasing the temperature inside the glass tubes.\nSet up a region of interest of the tracking system by dragging a frame across the area to be monitored in such a way that all 15 glass tubes are included and approximately 5 mm of the edges of the tubes are excluded.\nSet up 14 parallel separation lines between individual tubes in the tracking system by changing their Y-positions in the corresponding script to keep individual flies identifiable throughout the experiment. Make sure to position them in such a way that there is always one glass tube between two such separator lines, because only one fly will be tracked between any set of two lines.\nMake sure to set camera parameters in such a way that flies are reliably tracked throughout the glass tubes. If flies are lost at the edges of the region of interest, increase brightness or gain of the tracking software. Avoid mechanical vibrations of the tracking system. Track using commercial software according to manufacturer's protocol.\nStart experiment by starting the stimulus protocol. Record flies´ XY-coordinates at 20 fps (frames per sec) and log in combination with the odor valve status in text files.\n3. Data Analysis",
    "NOTE: The following steps in the data analysis are automatized using custom-written routines programmed in R. Because these steps are crucial to obtain meaningful results the analysis will nevertheless be presented in a step-by-step manner. The raw data for the analysis are .csv-files containing synchronized information on odor valve status, pulse number in the experiment and 15 fly x-positions in cm on a common time axis for one odor stimulation cycle. Custom code for data analysis can be provided upon request.\nOpen .csv-file, find time-point of valve opening signified by a change in the column representing the valve status.\nCalculate the linear function of odor position of the form\n\tf(t) = s*t + i\n\twhere t is time in the stimulation cycle, s is the wind speed (here 20 cm/sec) and the intercept i can be calculated using the time-point the odor enters the tubes at position 0 (valve opening plus delay).\nFind the time point at which odor and fly x-position intersect for every fly and set this time-point to 0. Note: This way fly positions are aligned to each individual´s encounter with the odor.\nExclude flies sitting at the very edges of the region of interest.\nCalculate speed from X-positions by dividing displacement along the x-axis by the time interval (100 msec) and repeat procedure for every stimulation cycle.\nTo obtain speed time-courses as shown in Figure 2E calculate mean speed time-course for every fly and odor and from those the mean time-course for a given odor.\nTo obtain net displacement as shown in Figure 3C calculate the net displacement within 4 sec after the odor pulse for every tracking event and afterwards the mean net displacement per fly and odor.\n4. Cleaning Procedure\nClean Glass Tubes",
    "Remove flies and adapters from glass tubes and soak glass tubes in detergent.\nRinse glass tubes under running distilled water and dry them using pressurized air.\nHeat glass tubes at 200 °C for 8 hr.\nClean Odor Delivery System\n\t\nRemove all odor vials and tubing from the central mixing chamber.\nRemove tubing adapters from the mixing chamber.\nClean mixing chamber by rinsing it with laboratory cleaning solution and solvents (e.g. ethanol, acetone). Perform these steps under the laboratory hood.\nDry mixing chamber using pressurized air and heat it at 200 °C for 8 hr.\nClean Odor Vials and Check Valves\n\t\nRemove steel plug (discard rubber gasket) and check valves from odor vials and soak all components in laboratory cleaning solution.\nSonicate components in an ultrasound bath and rinse them with distilled water.\nClean all components except check valves with ethanol and acetone. Perform these steps under the laboratory hood.\nDry components using pressurized air and heat them at 200 °C for 8 hr.\nClean check valves on the inside by flushing them with ethanol and acetone using a syringe (consider flow direction). Perform these steps under the laboratory hood wearing laboratory goggles. Because acetone attacks rubber parts, immediately dry check valves by flushing them with pressurized air.\nRemove residual odors by pulsing air through check valves for several days. Use an incubator at 60 °C and a 1 sec air on/1 sec air off regime for this cleaning step.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
