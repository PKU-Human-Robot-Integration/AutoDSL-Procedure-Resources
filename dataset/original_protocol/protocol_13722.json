  "procedures": [
    "The protocol was approved by the Animal Research Committee of Kyoto University (approval number: Med kyo 17616).\n1. Perform in vivo cyclic compression on the rat knee\nInduce experimental animal anesthesia\n\t\nInduce anesthesia in a 12-week-old Wistar rat (256.8 ± 8.7 g) by inhalation of 5% isoflurane solution in the anesthesia box.\nIntraperitoneally inject a mixture of three anesthetic agents9, including medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol, at 2 mg/kg of the rat body weight, and shave the area around the right knee joint. Confirm sufficient anesthetization by lack of pedal reflex to a toe-pinch.\nMount the anesthetized rat on the fixation device.\n\t\nPlace the anesthetized rat lying on their belly on the baseplate (Figure 1), with the right knee attached to a small piece of resin with a concave groove. Place the right hind limb in the hip extension, knee flexion, and ankle extension positions, with the knee flexed at approximately 140°. Accommodate the heel of the rat on the wedge-shaped groove on the movable fixture.\nMove the fixation device to the stress/tensile testing instrument (see the Table of Materials). After ensuring that there are no contacts with the load cell, open the stress/tensile testing instrument control software (Table of Materials) and click on the Calibration button. After calibration, attach the top of the frame to the load cell carefully. To keep the knee joint closely attached to the frame, turn on the rotary knob on the movable main operational panel slowly until the pre-load reaches 5 N.\nBuild a loading method and set up the compressive test.",
    "On the Main menu, click on Create a new method | System label. Set Test Mode to Cycle, and Test Type to Compression. Click on the Sensor label and select the Test tab to check that the limit is within 60 N. In addition, select the Stroke tab and check that the limit is within 500 mm.\n\t\tNOTE: The above step will stop the operation immediately if there is a large displacement on the stress point.\nUnder the Testing control label, select Origin of growth to start the main program with 0.3%/full scale. Of the four sections in a loading cycle, set the Stroke speed in control in the 1st and 3rd sections to 1 mm/s. Set the Maximum testing force in the 2nd section to 20 N, and the Minimum testing force in the 4th section to 5 N. Set \"the Duration of hold\" to 0.5 s for the peak load and 10 s for the minimum load (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: As this step defines every cycle, ensure that the joint surfaces are in contact with each other and are moving at a reasonable speed and that the motion is maintained.\nIn the Pre-load tab at the bottom of the page, ensure that On is checked, the Speed of deflection removal is set to 100 mm/min, and maximum force is 5 N. In the Specimen label, set the Material as Metal.\n\t\tNOTE: These detailed settings may be specific for each manufacturer.\nIn the Main menu, under the Select method and test section, select the method that was just built, and click on Start to begin the test.\n\t\tNOTE: The table at the bottom shows the actual measurements of the peak load and displacement.\nSet the number of cycles to 60.",
    "​NOTE: The entire loading session includes 60 cycles, which lasts approximately 12 min. In the control group, rats underwent 5 N pre-loading for 12 min pre-load under the same conditions.\nAfter loading, return the rat to its cage and monitor until full recovery. Maintain a 12-12 h light-dark schedule in the cage with sufficient space and food ad libitum. After the required experimental periods, sacrifice the rats with an overdose of the mixture of the three anesthetic agents injected intraperitoneally or carbon dioxide inhalation for analysis (1 h-8 weeks).\nSubscription Required.
