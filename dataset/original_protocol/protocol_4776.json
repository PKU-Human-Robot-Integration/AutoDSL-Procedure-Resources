    "Preparation of Synechococcus 7942 cultureSynechococcus 7942 is streaked and pre-incubated on BG-11 agar plates at 30 °C under continuous illumination (40 µE/m2/s) for 1 week in the plant growth chamber.Cells from the plates are suspended in approximately 1 ml of BG-11 medium with high turbidity and diluted into 80 ml of BG-11 medium at an OD750 of 0.05. The culture is incubated at 30 °C under continuous illumination (40 µE/m2/s) with 2% CO2 bubbling for 10 days.The culture is then diluted to OD750 = 0.2 with fresh BG-11 medium. After 18-h incubation under dark conditions at 30 °C with 2% CO2 bubbling, the culture is transferred to light conditions (40 µE/m2/s) to restart cell growth.A 1-ml aliquot of the cultured cells is used for the following assay (Procedure C, D and E).Preparation of E. coli culture as a standardE. coli is streaked and pre-incubated on M9 agar plates at 37 °C in the growth chamber. Cells from the plates are suspended in approximately 1 ml of M9 medium with high turbidity and then diluted into 10 ml of M9 medium at an OD600 of 0.2. The culture is incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 4 h.10 µl of 20 mg/ml chloramphenicol is added to the culture (final concentration, 20 µg/ml). After incubation with shaking for 2 h, 1 ml of cell culture is subjected to the following assay.FixationTo the 1-ml aliquots of cell culture, 10 µl of 0.5% Tween 20 and 20 µl of 50% glutaraldehyde are added (final conc. 0.005% and 1%, respectively), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation by a rotator.The cells are centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 1 min and then washed with 1 ml of PBS, and the cell pellets were stored at -30 °C until further analysis.",
    "DNA stainingCell pellets were frozen with liquid N2, and then thawed at room temperature. Note: This step is necessary for the permeation of SYTOX Green.The cell pellets are resuspended in 50 µl of 10 µM SYTOX Green solution, which was diluted with 50 mM trisodium citrate (pH 8.0).The samples are incubated overnight at 4 °C.FACS analysisThe SYTOX Green-stained cells are subjected to FACS analysis. The stained cell suspension (5 µl) is diluted with 250 µl of PBS and immediately analyzed by FACS. The cells could be selected by cell size and internal complexity by using forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) values. The SYTOX Green signal corresponds to the DNA amount, and is detected by the FL1 detector (laser: 488 nm, filter: 533/30 nm) (Figures 1 and 2). Note: The signal of Synechococcus 7942 cells can be identified based on chlorophyll autofluorescence using FL3 (laser: 488 nm, filter: 610/20 nm). The major peak of the chloramphenicol-treated E. coli sample, which corresponds to 1 copy of the chromosome per E. coli cell, is extracted and used as a standard for estimating the chromosomal copy number.Estimation of chromosomal copy numberThe Synechococcus 7942 chromosome copy number (ca. 2.7 Mbp) is calculated based on the peak location of E. coli (ca. 4.7 Mbp) (Figure 3). The copy number of Synechococcus 7942 changes under our culture conditions (2-4 copies under dark and 3-8 copies under light conditions) (Watanabe et al. 2015) as reported previously (Binder and Chisholm, 1995; Griese et al., 2011).Equation: Copy number of the Synechococcus 7942 chromosome = FL1 valueSynechococcus x 4.7 (Genome size in E. coli)/FL1 valueE.coli x 2.7 (Genome size in Synechococcus)"
