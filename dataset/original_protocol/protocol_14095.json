UV cross-linking and lysate production\nMicroorganisms in solution\n\t\nInoculate 3.5 L of the desired medium with yeast from an overnight culture to a starting OD600 of 0.05. Grow at 30 °C with continuous shaking at 180 rpm.\nDuring the growth, prepare other necessary materials.\n\t\t\nPrepare a container of liquid nitrogen.\nPrepare 3 L of stress-inducing medium and warm to 30 °C in a water bath.\nSet up the filter apparatus, turn on the cross-linker (Figure 2A) and label 50 mL conical tubes, one for each timepoint.\nOnce the cells reach your desired OD600, pour 500 mL of cells straight into the cross-linker and UV irradiate with 250 mJ of 254 nm UV. See Figure 2A and Figure 3A for details on using the crosslinker.",
    "NOTE: The UV irradiation energy must be carefully optimized for each protein of interest. See the Discussion for further details.\nAfter cross-linking, filter the cells using one of the vacuum filtration devices (Figure 2B,C). Roll up the membrane with the filtered cells, place in the t = 0 (time zero) 50 mL conical tube, and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nFilter the remaining cells over six different filters. Resuspend the collected cells in the 3 L of previously warmed stress-inducing medium by dropping the membranes in the medium and mixing vigorously with a stripette for 50 s. After the 50 s, prepare for taking the t = 1 sample.\nAfter 1 min, crosslink 500 mL of cells and harvest through filtration as in steps 1.1.3–1.1.4. Repeat after 2, 4, 8, 14, and 20 min, or different timepoints as needed.\nStore the conical tubes containing the cells at -80 °C. Set phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight.\nThe next day, take each conical tube containing a crosslinked sample and resuspend the cells in 25 mL of cold PBS by shaking vigorously.\nTransfer the cell suspensions to new conical tubes and spin at 4,600 x g, 5 min at 4 °C.\nPour off the PBS, quickly spin again to collect residual PBS and then decant the remaining liquid with a pipette.\nCalculate the weight of the pellet in the tube by comparing it to an empty tube.\nAdd two pellet volumes of ice-cold TN150, 60 µL of DNase 1, and 10 µL of RNase inhibitor. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\n\t\t\nFor example, for 400 mg of cells, add 800 µL of ice-cold TN150.",
    "The addition of the DNase is not essential for most soluble proteins but is very important when studying chromatin-bound proteins such as RNA polymerase. Additionally, it reduces the viscosity of bacterial lysates. It is very important to use exactly two pellet volumes of the lysis buffer, or the lysis efficiency can decrease.\nAdd three pellet volumes (in mL) of zirconia beads to the cell suspension. For yeast, use 0.5 mm diameter beads and for bacteria use 0.1 mm.\n\t\t\nFor example, for 400 mg of cells, measure out 1.2 mL of zirconia beads in a 1.5 mL tube and add them to the cells resuspended in lysis buffer.\nVortex the cell suspensions for 1 min, then place on ice for 1 min. Repeat for a total of 5x.\nAdd two pellet volumes of TN150 buffer and vortex vigorously to mix.\nCentrifuge the suspension in the conical tube at 4,600 g for 20 min at 4 °C in a benchtop centrifuge.\n\t\t\nAfter centrifuging, take a 50 µL sample of the supernatant for future Western blot analysis to examine the whole cell protein expression.\nTransfer the supernatants into 1.5 mL tubes and spin the lysate for 20 min at 20,000 x g at 4 °C, in a microfuge.\n\t\t\nAlternatively, if using 5 mL tubes, centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 20 min.\nFollowing centrifugation, take a 50 µL sample of the supernatant for future Western blot analysis to examine the soluble expression of the protein.\nProceed to RBP capture (section 2).\nCultured adherent cells\n\t\nSeed enough adherent cells in a Petri dish 24 h prior to UV cross-linking so that they can reach 80% confluency the next day. Grow overnight in the desired medium in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: If using quartz Petri dishes, it is beneficial to promote cell adhesion through the treatment of the cultureware with poly-D-lysine (70,000–140,000 wt) and fetal calf serum (FCS) 2.5 h before seeding. Add enough poly-D-lysine to cover the entire growth surface and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Next, the quartz Petri dish should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried in the cell culture incubator for 2 h or until completely dry. Afterwards, add enough FCS to completely cover the growth surface and place in the incubator for at least 30 min. The FCS should be completely removed before seeding cells.\nOnce the cells have reach 80% confluency, remove the media and wash with 15 mL of ice-cold PBS. Next, completely remove all remaining liquid and proceed immediately to the next step.\nTransfer the Petri dish to the tray for adherent cells (Figure 3B) and UV irradiate with 300 mJ of 254 nm UV. See Figure 2A and Figure 3B for details on using the crosslinker.\n\t\tNOTE: The UV irradiation energy must be carefully optimized for each protein of interest. See the Discussion for further details.\nImmediately after cross-linking, place the Petri dish on ice and add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS. Collect cells by scraping and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Pellet through centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the PBS and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS, and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Pellet cells again by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 x g at 4 °C.\nRemove the PBS and snap-freeze the cell pellets on dry ice. Store the cell pellets at -80 °C until required.\nRepeat steps 1.2.3–1.2.6 for each timepoint.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL of lysis buffer and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Afterwards, add 1 mL of lysis buffer for a total of 2 mL.\nAdd 5 µL of mammalian RNase inhibitor.\nSonicate 5x for 10 s on ice at 10 amp. Wait 30 s between sonication rounds.\nCalculate the protein concentration of each sample and normalize to the lowest concentration.\nTransfer 1.98 mL of lysate to a 2 mL tube.\nAdd 10 µL of DNase I and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min with shaking at 1,200 rpm.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\n\t\t\nAfter centrifugation, take a 50 µL sample of the supernatant for future Western blot analysis to examine soluble expression of the protein.\nProceed to RBP capture (section 2).\n2. RBP capture\nWash the magnetic anti-FLAG (75 µL of slurry per sample) or IgG agarose (500 µL of slurry per sample) beads 3x with 5 mL of TN150. Resuspend in a final volume of 700 µL of TN150 and add 100 µL of washed beads to seven 15 mL conical tubes.\n\t\nStore on ice until required.\nOnce the lysates have been clarified, add the supernatant to the tube containing the anti-FLAG/IgG beads.\nNutate at 4 °C for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: Some protocols describe overnight incubations with the beads, but this is not recommended, because long incubation times can dramatically reduce the recovery of cross-linked RNAs.\n3. Washing the beads and TEV cleavage of the tags\nHarvest the beads and remove the lysate.\n\t\nTake a 50 µL of sample of the supernatant for future Western blot analysis to examine the uncaptured protein.",
    "Resuspend the beads in ice-cold TN1000 and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube. Wash for 10 min, 4 °C, with nutation. Repeat for a total of three washes.\n\t\nIf using IgG agarose beads, wash with 5 mL of TN1000. If using anti-FLAG beads, use 2 mL.\nNext, wash the beads 3x with TN150, with the same volume as above.\nAfter the third wash, resuspend the beads in 600 µL of TN150.\nAdd 30 U of homemade GST-TEV protease to the bead suspension and rotate for 2 h at RT.\n\tNOTE: Recombinant GST-TEV protease is now also commercially available, but it has not been tested with this protocol.\n\t\nDuring the digestion, prepare for the next steps by setting up columns of three 1.5 mL tubes for each sample (i.e. for seven samples, have three rows of seven columns).\nTo the final row of tubes, add 0.4 g of guanidium hydrochloride, 27 µL of 5M sodium chloride and 3 µL of 2.5 M imidazole (pH = 8). Note that the pH of the imidazole must be 8. This is critical to maintain RNA integrity.\nAdditionally, wash the required volume of nickel beads in WB I 3x. Use 100 µL of slurry per sample. After the final wash, resuspend the beads in the same original volume of WB I and store on ice.\nOnce the TEV digestion is complete, collect the supernatant using a magnetic rack for anti-FLAG beads or centrifugation for IgG beads, and transfer to the first row of the tubes previously set up.\n\t\nTake a 50 µL of sample of the TEV eluate for Western blot analysis.\nSet a thermoblock incubator to 37 °C. To the second row of tubes, add 1 µL of RNase cocktail (1:50 dilution).",
    "Take 550 µL of TEV eluate from the first row of tubes and add to the second row (containing the RNase cocktail). Pipette vigorously to ensure mixing.\nAfter completing this for the first sample, immediately place the tube into the thermoblock and start a timer. Move on to the subsequent samples, such that each is staggered.\nIncubate for exactly 5 min. Once completed, remove the first sample from the thermoblock and transfer the solution to the third row of tubes (containing the guanidium hydrochloride powder).\n\tNOTE: A 5 min incubation with a 1:50 dilution of the RNase cocktail is usually suitable for most proteins, but this step will need to be carefully optimized with different incubation times or concentrations for each protein to make sure that the cross-linked RNAs are of the correct size (30–100 nt).\nImmediately vortex for a couple of seconds at full speed to dissolve the guanidium powder and then move on to the next sample.\nAfter all samples have been transferred into the guanidium powder, vortex again to ensure all the powder is fully dissolved.\nAdd 100 µL of washed nickel beads and rotate overnight at 4 °C. This incubation can be shortened to 2 h.\n4. On-bead alkaline phosphatase treatment\nSet a thermoblock to 37 °C.\nPlace a purification spin column in a 2 mL tube, one for each sample. Transfer the nickel beads to the columns and allow the supernatant to drain through. Afterwards, ensure that all the nickel beads were removed from the 1.5 mL tube by rinsing with WB I and applying to the column.",
    "Set up 2 mL tubes, six per sample (one to collect each wash). Keep the outside of the columns dry to maintain flow. Wash the beads 3x with 500 µL of WB I and then 3x with 500 µL of NP-PNK.\nClose the lid of the spin column and briefly spin beads to remove excess buffer.\nPut the stopper on the column, put columns into 1.5 mL tubes and add 60 µL of the reaction mixture seen in Table 2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nComponent,1x,7.5x\n5 x PNK buffer,12,90\nAlkaline phosphatase,4,30\nRNase inhibitor,2,15\nH2O,42,315\nFinal volume,60 µL,450 µL\nTable 2: Alkaline phosphatase reaction mixture.\nIncubate the beads for 1 h at 37 °C.\nWash the beads 1x with 500 µL of WB I to inactivate the alkaline phosphatase and then 3x with 500 µL of NP-PNK buffer.

Make sure to use proper shielding.\nFully resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of ice-cold acetone.",
    "Centrifuge for 15 min at 17,000 x g, 4 °C.\nRemove as much of the acetone with a P1000 pipette as possible. Afterwards, briefly spin the tube to gather small droplets of acetone, and then remove with a P10 pipette. Dry for 2 min in a fume hood.\n\tNOTE: The acetone supernatant can still be radioactive. Make sure to use proper shielding.\nResuspend the sample in 30 µL of 1x protein loading buffer. To ensure that the pellet is properly resuspended, check that the vast majority of the radioactivity is now present in the loading buffer and not left in the 1.5 mL tube by removing the solution in a P200 pipette and measuring the activity left in the 1.5 mL tube using a Geiger counter.\nHeat the sample for 10 min at 65 °C. Load on a 1 mm, 4–12% precast Bis-Tris gel and run for 1.5 h at 125 V in MOPS buffer.\nAfter the gel has finished running, open the gel cassette. The gel should be retained on the bottom plate. Dispose of the top.\nWrap the gel in cling film and then secure it using tape to the inside of a light-tight cassette. Ensure that the cassette has an amplifying screen to improve the signal.\nExpose an autoradiographic film to the gel and store the cassette at -80 °C during the exposure. The exposure time will vary between proteins with different cross-linking efficiencies.\n\t\nWhen placing the film, there must be a way of realigning it to the cassette in order to cut out the band of interest in the subsequent step. To ensure this, use a fluorescent ruler and also ensure that the gel is at a corner of the cassette, which is then covered by the film also placed in the utmost corner.",
    "NOTE: As a rule of thumb, eluates in loading buffer that give a reading of at least ~250 cps when displayed to a Geiger counter give sufficient signal for an exposure of 3 h. Otherwise, overnight exposure is performed.\nDevelop the film. Cut away the cling film covering the gel but do not move the gel. Otherwise, the image will be offset from the gel.\n\tNOTE: The gel will likely be highly radioactive. Make sure to use proper shielding when cutting out the gel slice.\nPlace the film over the gel and excise the band of interest. Put the gel slice into a 2 mL tube.\nSmash the gel slice using a P1000 pipette tip and add 600 µL of proteinase K buffer plus 200 µg of proteinase K (this protocol uses 10 µL of a 20 mg/mL proteinase K solution). Incubate for 2 h at 55 °C with vigorous shaking.\nAfterwards, cut the end of a P1000 tip off with a clean scalpel and transfer the supernatant and gel pieces to a spin column placed in a 2 mL tube.\nSpin the column for 1 min at 17,000 x ­g at RT. Collect the flow-through, which contains the radioactive, isolated RNAs.\nPerform a phenol:chloroform extraction.\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH = 5.2, and 500 µL of phenol:chloroform and vortex well. Spin for 5 min at 17,000 x g. Remove the aqueous top layer and place in a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 500 µL of chloroform and vortex vigorously for 10–15 s. Spin for 5 min at 17,000 x g at RT. Remove the aqueous layer and place in a new 1.5 mL tube.",

Remove the supernatant, add 500 µL of 70% ethanol and centrifuge for 5 min, 4 °C at 17,000 x g. Remove all the ethanol, perform a quick spin to gather residue and remove excess with a P10 pipette.\nDry the pellet for ~3 min in a fume hood. Resuspend in 20 µL of DEPC-treated water.\nStore the RNA at -80 °C overnight or proceed immediately to the reverse transcription step.\n9.
