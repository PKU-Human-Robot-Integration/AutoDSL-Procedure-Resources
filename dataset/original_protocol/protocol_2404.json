Timeline for differentiation and electroporation in 3T3L1 cells\nSeed 2×105 undifferentiated 3T3L1 fibroblasts in growth medium into a 150-mm dish (day 0).\nIncubate the cells at 37°C at 8% CO2 for 8 days with medium change at day 4.\nNote: Differentiation and maintenance of differentiation ability of 3T3L1 cells appears to be better under CO2 concentrations of 8% than 5%.\nAt day 8, switch to differentiation medium, and incubate the cells at 37°C at 8% CO2 for 4 days.\nAt day 12, switch to insulin medium, and incubate the cells at 37°C at 8% CO2 for at least 2 days.\nConfirm the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cells with brightfield observation.\nHarvest the differentiated adipocytes.\nDilute the cell suspension to 4×.\nSeed the cells (200 μL each) onto collagen IV-coated glass bottom dishes.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C at 8% CO2 for 1 day.\nDilute each 10–25 μg of myc-GLUT4-mCherry and TfR plasmid DNAs into 100 μL of electroporation buffer in total.\nRemove the culture medium and add the plasmid solution.",
    "Apply electroporation pulses with an electrode as follows: Poration pulse at 200 V for 10 ms, followed by five driving pulses at –30 V for 10 ms at 50-ms intervals.\nNote: This solution can be reused for electroporation into at least three glass bottom dishes.\nNote: Electroporation for other types of the cells can be performed according to previous reports (Matsubara et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Tsai et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Usui et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and manufacturer’s website (https://www.bexnet.co.jp/english/[href=https://www.bexnet.co.jp/english/]).\nAdd 2 mL of feed medium.\nIncubate cells for 1–2 days.\nPreparation of the reconstitution model in 3T3L1 fibroblasts.\nSeed 8×104 3T3L1 fibroblasts in growth medium into a 35-mm glass bottom dish, and incubate the cells at 37°C at 8% CO2 for 1 day.\nTransfect each 1 μg/dish of myc-GLUT4-mCherry, HA-sortilin and HaloTag-AS160 plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent as follows. The case of transfection into 1 dish is shown.\nDilute 4.5 μL of Lipofectamine 3000 reagent in 125 μL of Opti-MEM medium and mix well.\nDilute 1 μg each of myc-GLUT4-mCherry, HA-sortilin and HaloTag-AS160 plasmid DNAs in 125 μL of Opti-MEM medium, then add 6 μL of P3000 reagent, and mix well.\nAdd diluted DNA to diluted Lipofectamine 3000 reagent.\nIncubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd the solution to the cells dropwise.\nIncubate cells at 37°C at 8% CO2 for 4 h and change medium.\nIncubate cells for an additional day.\nPreparation of the fusion sensor molecule\nTiming: 1 week for antibody purification, 4 h for conjugation reaction\nThis part of the protocol describes antibody purification and preparation of the fusion sensor molecule anti-myc-SA/BODIPY. Schema for the preparation of the fusion sensor molecule (steps 5–8) are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. While working with BODIPY fluorescent molecules, minimize light exposure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2041-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schema for steps 5–8",
    "Steps 5, 6 and 7 can be carried out concurrently.\nPurification of anti-myc antibodies from hybridoma cell culture medium.\nMaintain MYC 1-9E10.2 hybridoma cells in antibody collection media at 37°C at 5% CO2 for 4 days.\nNote: Ideally, culture hybridoma cells in vessels that can continuously stir cell suspensions, such as spinner flasks; however, standard culture dishes can also be used. We usually purify anti-myc antibodies using 500 mL of conditioned media per run.\nCollect conditioned medium, spin down at 1,000×g for 3 min, and keep supernatant.\nRemove debris by filtration.\nPour Protein G Sepharose slurry into a column in one continuous motion.\nImmediately fill the remainder of the column with PBS and equilibrate the slurry with at least twice column bed volume of PBS.\nApply collected conditioned medium at a flow rate of approx. 2 mL/min.\nAfter applying all conditioned medium, wash the column with at least ten times column bed volume of PBS.\nPrepare 6× 1.5 mL tubes containing 50 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).\nAdd 0.2 M glycine buffer (pH 2.5) into the column and collect the eluates (1 mL in each 1.5 mL tube).\nMeasure absorbance at 280 nm and identify the fractions containing antibodies.\nExchange buffer with PBS-EDTA by ultrafiltration with Amicon Ultra-4 100k MWCO.\nNote: Other standard methods for buffer exchange, such as dialysis or desalting columns, can also be used. However, it may be necessary to concentrate the antibodies after buffer exchange by dialysis or with desalting column; the same applies hereafter.\nCritical: Presence of EDTA is critical for stabilizing half-antibodies prepared below (step 7) since EDTA prevents oxidation of sulfhydryl groups.\nDetermine antibody concentration, and dilute or concentrate the antibodies to prepare 10 mg/mL solution in PBS-EDTA. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: The specificity and other characteristics of the antibodies produced in this hybridoma are already well established (Evan et al., 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Quality can also be checked by western blotting (Nedachi et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) or immunofluorescence (Hatakeyama and Kanzaki, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPause point: The purified antibodies can be used for subsequent reactions immediately or stored short-term at 4°C. Long-term storage at –20°C is also possible if a cryoprotectant (e.g., glycerol) is added to a storage buffer (e.g., PBS), but the cryoprotectant must be removed before subsequent conjugation reactions by ultrafiltration or other standard methods for buffer exchange.\nPreparation of SA/BODIPY.\nExchange buffer in streptavidin stock solution for sodium bicarbonate buffer through ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 10k MWCO. After buffer exchange, determine streptavidin concentration using absorption at 280 nm with extinction coefficient    ε 280  1  m g / m L   = 3.2  c  m  − 1     (Waner et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) and molecular weight of 52 kDa.\nDilute (or concentrate, if required) this streptavidin to 10 mg/mL in sodium bicarbonate buffer.\nAdd 200 μL (2 mg) of streptavidin (≈38.5 nmol) into a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 3 μL of BODIPY FL-NHS (≈77 nmol) to the contents of the tube.\nMix with Eppendorf MixMate (or equivalent) at 800 rpm for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nExchange buffer for PBS through ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 10k MWCO and determine protein concentration using absorption at 280 nm (A280) and 504 nm (A504) with\n   (Equation 1)        [  P r o t e i n  ]    (  m g / m L  )  =    A 280  − 0.04  A 504    ϵ 280  1  m g / m L            \nNote: This equation is derived from manufacturer’s instructions.\nPreparation of maleimide-activated SA/BODIPY.\nDissolve sulfo-SMCC in Milli-Q water to 5 mg/mL.",
    "Note: Do not use buffer containing >50 mM of salts since sulfo-SMCC does not dissolve well in such buffers.\nImmediately after a, add 10-fold molar amount of sulfo-SMCC to BODIPY-labeled streptavidin.\nRock gently for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nExchange buffer for PBS-EDTA through ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 10k MWCO and determine protein concentration with equation (1)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1].\nPreparation of functional anti-myc half-antibodies.\nNote: This step can proceed in parallel with steps 5 and 6.\nNote: 2-Mercaptoethylamine is a mild reducing agent and can selectively cleave hinge-region disulfide bonds of IgG heavy chains without loss of selectivity (Makaraviciute et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Sharma and Mutharasan, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Yoshitake et al., 1979[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). The use of whole IgG should be avoided because labeling with whole IgG, which has two antigen-binding sites, may result in the unintended aggregation of labeled molecules.\nDissolve 6 mg of 2-mercaptoethylamine in 100 μL of PBS-EDTA, and immediately add 1 μL of this 2-mercaptoethylamine solution to each 10 μL volume of 10 mg/mL antibodies.\nRock gently for 1.5 h at 37°C.\nExchange buffer for PBS-EDTA to remove excess 2-mercaptoethylamine through ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 10k MWCO and determine antibody concentration.\nConjugation of SA/BODIPY and anti-myc half-antibodies.\nCombine anti-myc half-antibodies and maleimide-activated SA/BODIPY at 1:1.2 molar ratio, which has been determined on the basis of Poisson statistics with the expectation of increasing the 1:1 binding probability (Luchowski et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nRock gently for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nExchange buffer for PBS through ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 10k MWCO.\nDetermine protein concentration with equation (1)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1] and degree of labeling with\n   (Equation 2)       D e g r e e  o f  l a b e l i n g =    A 504  × 52000    [  P r o t e i n  ]  × 68000           \nValidation of transferrin-biotin-dependent enhancement of anti-myc-SA/BODIPY in vitro.",
    "Prepare 100 nM of anti-myc-SA/BODIPY in PBS.\nPrepare 1 μM of Tf-biotin in PBS.\nMix a and b to prepare anti-myc-SA/BODIPY: Tf-biotin = 1:0–32 mixtures as follows.\nRock gently for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nMeasure fluorescence intensity with spectrofluorometer (Excitation at 488 nm, Emission at 515 nm). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2041_16.csv\nCritical: Streptavidin labeling with BODIPY and antibody conjugation in this order is critical for proper fusion sensor preparation. When antibody conjugation to streptavidin precedes BODIPY labeling, there will be no increases in BODIPY fluorescence in response to the addition of biotin due to insufficient quenching of BODIPY (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nPause point: The prepared anti-myc-SA/BODIPY can be used immediately, stored short-term at 4°C, or stored long-term at –20°C with addition of a cryoprotectant (e.g., glycerol).\nLabeling of myc-GLUT4-mCherry and TfR, and imaging\nTiming: 4 h for labeling, 1 h for imaging/sample\nThis part of the protocol describes labeling myc-GLUT4-mCherry and TfR with anti-myc-SA/BODIPY and Tf-biotin, respectively, and acquiring fluorescent images of BODIPY and mCherry. For fluorescent imaging, 12-bit images were acquired with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope system equipped with an inverted microscope, a 63× oil-immersion objective, a white-light pulsed laser and hybrid detectors as a t-series at intervals of 10 s. BODIPY and mCherry fluorescence are acquired by line-sequential unidirectional scanning at 400 Hz with a 2× line average. Excitations are at 488 nm and 561 nm, and fluorescence values are collected at 495–565 nm and 580–650 nm, respectively. The pixel size is typically set around 0.144 μm/pixel.\nIncubate the cells with serum-free medium at 37°C at 8% CO2 for 1 h.\nTreat the cells with 4 μg/mL anti-myc-SA/BODIPY for 1 h in the presence of 1 nM insulin.",
    "Rinse the cells three times with serum-free medium and incubate the cells for at least 3 h with exchange of the medium every hour.\nRinse the cells twice with imaging buffer and incubate the cells for 10 min in 1 mL of imaging buffer.\nDuring the incubation, place the cells under a confocal microscope and search for the cells displaying proper localization of expressed myc-GLUT4-mCherry, i.e., predominantly localized around perinuclear regions. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd 10 mL of Imaging buffer containing 5 μg/mL Tf-biotin by perifusion and incubate for 5 min.\nWash the cells thoroughly with 30 mL of Imaging buffer by perifusion and incubate for 8 min.\nStart image acquisition and add 10 mL of Imaging buffer containing 100 nM insulin 2 min after initiation of image acquisition.\nContinue image acquisition for further 10 min. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSave acquired images as a lif (Leica image format) or tiff files.\nAnalysis\nTiming: depends on number of images\nThis part of the protocol describes analysis of acquired imaging data for quantifying heterotypic endomembrane fusion. Examples of analysis is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2041-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(A and B) Fluorescent images of anti-myc-SA/BODIPY (a1 and b1) and myc-GLUT4-mCherry (a2 and b2) in a 3T3L1 adipocyte expressing myc-GLUT4-mCherry and transferrin receptor before (A) and 10 min after (B) insulin stimulation (100 nM). Calculated images, i.e., ratio images (R, a3 and b3), images of changes in the ratio values (ΔR, a4 and b4) and binary images showing the area for which the ratio value is above the threshold that was set as the top 1% ratio value within the cellular region (S, a5 and b5) are also shown. White lines represent the cellular region. In the S images, percent areas within cellular regions are also shown. In this case, ΔS (changes in S from S0) was 2.73%. Gaussian-filtered images are shown.\n(C–E) Insulin-responsive changes in ΔRnormalized (C), ΔS (D), and ΔF (E). A 100 nanomolar quantity of insulin was applied at time 0 (arrow). Red curves represent 10-point Lowess smoothing.\nOpen the acquired BODIPY and mCherry images (e.g., a1/b1 and a2/b2 images in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B, respectively) with Fiji ImageJ.\nSet “Divide by zero value” in Fiji (Edit > Options > Misc…) to 0.\nCreate a new image as a 32-bit floating-point data by dividing each BODIPY frame image by each corresponding mCherry frame image with Image Calculator of Fiji and save it as a “ratio image” (e.g., a3/b3 images in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nNote: Since the Leica hybrid detectors have very low background signals, it is not necessary to subtract the background. When using other detectors having non-negligible background signals including PMTs and CCDs, it is critical to perform appropriate background subtraction on each image prior to division.\nSet ROI for analysis by extracting cell contours using the mCherry image (e.g., white lines of a4/b4 and a5/b5 images in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).",
    "Apply Gaussian Blur filter to each mCherry frame image to smooth the contour.\nBinarize the images.\nRun “Analyze Particles” of Fiji over all frames with turning on “Add to Manager” to add the measured particles to the “ROI Manager”.\nUsing the “ratio image” created in step 22 and the ROI obtained in step 23, measure the following two values, R and S, for each frame.\nR: Ratio value within cellular regions.\nS: Area of which the ratio value above the threshold, set as the top 1% ratio value within the cellular region just prior to insulin stimulation (e.g., a5/b5 images in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nCalculate mean R and S values for the frames imaged during the 2-min period before insulin stimulation (defined as R0 and S0, respectively).\nCalculate normalized changes in R from R0, i.e., (R–R0)/R0 (defined as ΔRnormalized, e.g., Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nCalculate changes in S from S0, i.e., S–S0 (defined as ΔS, e.g., Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nCalculate index of insulin-responsive heterotypic fusion ΔF as the product obtained by multiplying ΔRnormalized and ΔS (e.g., Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E)."
