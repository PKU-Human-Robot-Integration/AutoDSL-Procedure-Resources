    "Please note, this protocol is written for U2OS cells containing an I-SceI recognition site18. The cells need not be U2OS but must contain the I-SceI site. The protocol may need to be adjusted (e.g., number of cells seeded and incubation times) depending on the type of cells used.\n1. Defining the Kinetics of DSB Repair Complex Formation\nGrow U20S-DRGFP cells on a 10 cm tissue culture plate until 85–90% confluent.\nRemove the media and incubate at room temperature (RT) in 3 mL of EDTA for 2 min.\nReplace EDTA with 1 mL of trypsin and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Ensure that the cells are detached from the surface of the plate by viewing under a microscope. Neutralize trypsin with 5 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nDetermine the concentration of cells in this suspension using a hemocytometer and the trypan blue exclusion method.\nSeed 6 x 103 cells/well in 200 µL of a glass-bottom 96-well plate. Alternatively, seed 4 x 106 cells in 8 mL on 12 mm coverslips placed in a 10 cm plate.\n\tNOTE: Each well or coverslip represents a single time point, including the control.\nGrow the cells overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nInducing DSBs\nReplace the media from the 96-well plate/10 cm dish with H2O2 diluted to a concentration of 25 µM with DMEM + 10% FBS and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nWash the cells 3x with 1x PBS and replace with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 0, 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. Ensure that fresh dilutions of H2O2 are used for each experiment.",
    "NOTE: To avoid killing cells at the H2O2 concentration used here, ensure that the dose of damage is low enough such that the bulk of cells will avoid apoptosis and senescence. It is critical to observe the recovery process. This is best achieved by measuring sensitivity to a range of doses. Perform an MTT assay or other cell viability assay to determine the minimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide that can be used.\nFixing and permeabilizing cells\nWash the cells 3 times with 1x PBS. Remove a coverslip from the 10 cm plate for each time point and place it in a single well of a 24-well plate for fixing. Use the needle and forceps to carefully remove the coverslip and avoiding scratching cells off the coverslip surface.\nFix the cells by incubating for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at designated times after 1 h of H2O2 exposure and fresh DMEM replacement (0, 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h).\nWash the fixed coverslips 3 times with PBS. Permeabilize the cells with 0.5% non-ionic detergent diluted in 1x PBS. Incubate for 15 min at RT, before washing 3x with PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: After permeabilization, storage of coverslips is possible in PBS at 4 °C for at least a week.\nRepair complex visualization\nBlock the 96-well plate/coverslips in a solution of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% non-ionic detergent diluted in 1x PBS (3% BSA solution) for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate with primary antibodies that target the repair protein of interest, diluted according to the manufacturer's specifications in 3% BSA solution for 1 h at RT, before washing 3 times with 1x PBS.",
    "Incubate the 96-well plate/coverslips with secondary antibody diluted according to the manufacturer’s protocol in 3% BSA solution. Confirm that the secondary fluorophores do not have overlapping excitation or emission spectra.\nAfter washing the cells with PBS 3 times add DAPI, diluted according to the manufacturer’s specifications in 1x PBS and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nMount the coverslips onto slides with a drop of mounting agent, making sure the cell-side faces down. Press the coverslips carefully and soak up any excess mounting agent with a wipe.\nSeal the coverslips with fast-drying transparent nail polish and ensure a complete seal of the coverslip with the slide.\nTake the confocal microscope images by focusing on the DAPI channel, before other channels (with signals from DNA repair gene of interest) to avoid introducing bias into the experiment.\nAlternatively, images can be acquired by taking Z-sections of the desired region and condensing the image into a single plane to visualize all detectable foci.\n\t\tNOTE: If DSB resolution or protein of interest is not observed at time points chosen, determine when DSBs resolve by selecting a wide range of time points initially (0–48 h post DSB induction). The time points of interest will vary by the method of DSB induction and the repair protein of interest.\nUse free ImageJ software to define the nuclei in the immunofluorescence microscopy images.\n\tNOTE: To open microscope images, the Bio-Formats plugin must be installed in ImageJ.\n\t\nOpen the confocal images (.czi or .tif) by dragging the image file into the ImageJ window, or by selecting \"Bio-Formats Importer\" from the \"Plugin\" toolbar in ImageJ.\n\t\tNOTE: The \"Bio-Formats Import Option\" window will appear.\nSelect \"Split Channels\" to split the image into constitutive DAPI and fluorescent images within the \"Bio-Formats Import Option\" window.",
    "Select \"Colorized\" in \"Color options\" from the drop-down menu. Select \"OK\" to open the DAPI and Histone H2AX (H2AX) images as separate windows and choose the DAPI image.\nSelect the \"Image\" toolbar and \"Adjust Threshold\" option to select nuclei.\n\t\tNOTE: A \"Threshold\" window will appear.\nAdjust the image threshold by sliding the bottom bar of the \"Threshold\" window completely to the right. Adjust the top bar until the nuclei appear completely red with distinct outlines, and the background black. DO NOT select apply. Close the \"Adjust Threshold\" window.\nSelect the \"Analyze\" toolbar and \"Analyze Particles\" option. See an \"Analyze Particles\" window appearing on the screen.\nInput the minimum size of a nucleus.\n\t\tNOTE: Particles below the size inputted will not be counted as nuclei.\nFrom the \"Show\" dropdown menu, select \"Outlines\". Select the \"Add to Manager\" option. Click \"OK\" to open an \"ROI Manager\" window.\n\t\tNOTE: Outlines of nuclei will appear in a separate window.\nAssign numbers to the nuclei that can be selected from the \"ROI Manager\" window.\nUse ImageJ to quantify H2AX foci in immunofluorescence microscopy images.\nSelect the \"H2AX\" foci window (stained with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody). Then, select the \"Process\" toolbar and choose \"Find Maxima\" to find the foci within the nuclei.\n\t\tNOTE: A \"Find Maxima\" window will open.\nChoose the \"Single Points\" option from the \"Output Type\" dropdown menu and select \"Preview point selection\" to visualize the maxima/foci. Input a \"Noise Tolerance\" value depending on the fluorescence intensity of the image (Figure 1). Check for the appearance of a white window with small black dots.",
    "NOTE: These dots represent the H2AX foci/maxima that have been detected. The noise tolerance value must be maintained constant for all images being analyzed. A low/high noise tolerance will depict too many/few maxima (foci) within the nucleus and will not be an accurate representation of the foci within the nucleus.\nSelect the nuclei for which H2AX foci must be quantified for from the \"ROI Manager\" window. Select all the nuclei by checking the \"show all\" option.\nSelect \"Measure\" to measure the number of maxima/foci within the selected nuclei.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of maxima/foci appear as multiples of 255, i.e., one maximum has a \"RawIntDen\" (Integrated density) reading of 255.\nCopy the \"RawIntDen\" values and paste them into software for data analysis.\n2. Analyzing Localization to a Long-lasting Double-strand DNA Break\nSeed cells on 96-well plates/coverslips as described in sections 1.1 and 1.2.\nInduction of double-strand DNA breaks\nTransfect cells with the I-SceI expression vector using a lipid-based transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications. Wait 24–72 h after transfection to maximize the endonuclease expression. Determine if the transfection was successful by locating cells with a singular large nuclear γ-H2AX focus.\nAcquisition of images\nFix, permeabilize, block, and wash the 96-well plate/coverslips as described in section 1.8.\nCo-incubate cells with an antibody against γ-H2AX and the repair protein of interest (here, a primary antibody against RAD51 was used) diluted according to the manufacturer's specifications in 3% BSA solution.\nWash the 96-well plate/coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS. Incubate the 96-well plate/coverslips with secondary antibody diluted according to the manufacturer's protocol in 3% BSA solution. Confirm that the secondary fluorophores do not have overlapping excitation or emission spectra.\nIdentify cells that have a large nuclear γ-H2AX focus. Only take pictures of these cells to avoid bias.\nAnalysis of long-lasting I-SceI induced foci",
    "Analyze the long-lasting foci manually, by counting both the number of cells that have the large γ-H2AX foci and co-localized foci of the repair protein of interest.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
