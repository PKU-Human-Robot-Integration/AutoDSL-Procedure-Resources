    "All animal experiments were conducted according to University of Wisconsin – Madison and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines (University of Wisconsin – Madison Assurance number A3368-01).\n1. Selecting Females for Egg Collection via Interrupted Mating\nNOTE: IVF-based protocols rely on the extrusion of mature eggs from females through manual pressure 9. Previous protocols have used females directly from tanks or in pair matings without the females undergoing egg release behavior, but only a small fraction of these females (about 20% or less, depending on the zebrafish line) yield extruded and competent eggs upon manual pressure. In an improved procedure, females are pre-sorted for egg laying by direct visual observation, followed by immediate interruption of mating. This procedure is very effective, as nearly all females pre-selected through this interrupted mating step yield extruded and competent eggs upon manual pressure.\nThe afternoon before the experiment, set up mating pairs of the desired zebrafish strain in standard zebrafish mating boxes. Keep males in the same chamber as females yet physically separated from them, either through a mating box division or by placing the male under an egg-laying insert and the female inside the insert.\nThe morning of the experiment, remove the physical partition, placing both the male and female within the same egg-laying insert, so that mating begins.\nVisually inspect tanks containing mating pairs to detect extrusion of eggs during natural mating. At the first signs of egg extrusions, separate male and female to interrupt breeding. After separation from males, keep the pre-selected females either separately or pooled in the same tank. Use multiple females depending on the number of embryos desired (typically 50-150 eggs/female).\n2. Preparing a Sperm Solution",
    "NOTE: IVF relies on exposure of mature eggs to a sperm solution. This solution can be untreated, to generate diploid zygotes (which upon HS2 treatment become tetraploid embryos) or UV-treated, to generate haploid zygotes (which upon HS2 treatment become homozygous diploid embryos). Previous sperm preparation protocols suggested the use of capillary tubes to collect milt from the anal region of live males, but this was an ineffective process as only a small fraction of males yielded milt 9. The protocol presented below relies instead on sperm preparation from sheared dissected testes, which yields more reliable results.\nPrepare Hank's solution ahead of time as a Hank's premix solution, comprising of all components (Solutions 1, 2, 4 and 5) except the sodium bicarbonate solution (Solution 6). Prepare Solution 6 fresh and add to the premix the morning of the experiment (Table 1). To make Hanks' solution (final solution, prepare the morning of the IVF procedure), combine 990 ul of Hank's Premix and 10 µl of the freshly made Solution 6.\nEuthanize males by overexposure to tricaine as a 0.016% solution in conditioned water.\n\t\nPrepare tricaine as a 0.2% stock solution in water (buffer to pH 7.0 with 1M Tris pH 9.0) and keep at 4 °C. Add 8 ml of tricaine stock solution per 100 ml of water in a beaker, and use a net to transfer the males to the tricaine solution.\nUse the equivalent of testes for one male per clutch needed to be fertilized in a volume of Hank's solution corresponding to 100 µl per male (e.g. testes from 10 males collected in 1 ml Hank's solution, to fertilize 10 clutches with 100 µl/clutch).",
    "Confirm euthanasia by cessation of gill movements for 15 minutes. After euthanasia, remove the males from the beaker with a spoon. Rinse the males briefly with conditioned water and dry them lightly by placing them briefly on several locations of a paper towel.\nTo remove the testes, first decapitate euthanized males using dissecting scissors or a razor blade, and make a longitudinal cut along the abdomen with dissecting scissors.Under a dissecting microscope with a reflected light source, remove internal organs with dissecting forceps. Pull out each of the testes masses with forceps and place them inside the microcentrifuge tube containing Hank's solution.\n\tNOTE: Testes can be identified as each of two elongated structures of translucent appearance found alongside the body walls and which converge near the cloaca. Testes can stay 2-3 min on a petri plate surface after dissection and before placing them in the Hank's solution.\nRelease the sperm into the solution by shearing the testes with a narrow spatula and/or gently pipetting up and down 5-6 times the testes in solution with a 1,000 µl-tip micropipette, while avoiding air bubble formation. Let the testes debris settle.\nStore the sperm solution in ice, where it can keep its potency for up to 2-3 hr. If proceeding to UV-treatment of sperm solution, transfer the solution into a clean microcentrifuge tube leaving the pieces of testes behind.\n3. UV Treatment\nNOTE: UV treatment is used to crosslink sperm DNA in order to render it inactive in the embryo. This step is only used when producing gynogenetic haploid or homozygous gynogenetic diploid embryos. Sperm solution for UV treatment should be separated from pieces of testes (step 2.4), as large pieces may shield sperm from the UV treatment.",
    "Transfer the sperm solution to a clean, dry well of a depression glass plate sitting on an ice bed (e.g. ice inside a petri plate). Use up to 1 ml of sperm solution per glass plate well.\nExpose the sperm solution to UV by placing the depression glass plate on the ice bed under a UV lamp. Treat the sperm solution for 90 sec with a 115 V (60 Hz, 0.68A) UV-lamp at a 19 cm (7.5 inches) distance. With the end of a pipette tip, gently mix the solution every 30 seconds during UV treatment (use a clean pipette tip every 30 sec).\nUsing a clean pipet tip and micropipette, transfer the treated sperm solution to a new microcentrifuge tube. Store on ice until needed for IVF (no longer than 2-3 hr from extraction).\n4. Manual Extrusion of Mature Eggs\nNOTE: Females obtained by interruption of natural matings will readily yield eggs under anesthesia and manual pressure. During this procedure, tricaine treatment should be carefully controlled to avoid overexposure that may prevent recovery of the females.\nAnesthetize females by light exposure to tricaine solution: transfer females with a net to tricaine solution in conditioned water (made by adding 8 ml of Tricaine 0.2% stock solution to 100 ml of conditioned fish water) for about 2-5 min, until fish stop gill movement.\nAs soon as a female stops gill movement, use a spoon to collect it and briefly rinse it in conditioned water. Still using the spoon to move the fish, dry it lightly by placing it briefly and repeatedly on several locations of a paper towel, then transfer it to a clean, dry 10 cm diameter petri plate. Approach the fish with the spoon in the anterior to posterior direction, to avoid potentially damaging the gill operculum.",
    "Use lab wipes or soft tissue to gently further dry the anal fin area, to prevent any released eggs from prematurely being activated by water. Dampening the fingers lightly with water (to avoid them sticking to fish scales), place one finger of one hand on the female's back as support, and with a finger of the other hand apply slight pressure along the female's abdomen until eggs become extruded.\nUse a narrow spatula to move the eggs away from the female's body. Place the female back into a tank with conditioned water for recovery.\n\tNOTE: Once eggs are extruded while the female is lying on one side of her body, she can be flipped over and the process repeated on her other side to obtain additional eggs. To insure full recovery of the female, apply only gentle manual pressure on the abdomen, and carry out the procedure from gill movement stop to return to water in less than 2 min.\nActivate (with water exposure) and fertilize (with sperm solution addition) eggs simultaneously and within 90 sec after extrusion (see section 5).\n5. In Vitro Fertilization\nNOTE: Zebrafish fertilization in natural crosses is external, dependent on the simultaneous release and activation by water of eggs and sperm during mating. In vitro fertilization mimics this process by exposing the eggs to sperm solution in the presence of water. Water volume is originally small (1 ml) in order to increase the effective sperm concentration. Binding by sperm occurs within 15-20 sec 10, and water volume can then be increased. Chorion lifting further contributes to the close synchronization of the clutch by limiting the window for competence for sperm binding 11,12. The resulting embryos therefore exhibit largely simultaneous cell division cycles during the early cleavage stages.",
    "Add 100 µl of sperm solution (corresponding to the equivalent of testes from one male – see Part 2) to the clutch of extruded eggs on a petri plate. Gently swirl the pipette tip used to add the sperm solution among the eggs to mix the sperm and eggs together, being sure to not lift the tip from the surface of the petri plate to avoid egg damage.\nImmediately activate the eggs by adding 1 ml of embryonic medium (E3) solution (conditioned water is also acceptable as a substitute for E3 in Parts 5 through 7) and again gently mix eggs and sperm by gently swirling with the pipette tip. Start a timer to initiate timing relative to fertilization.\nAt 1 mpf in the 1 ml volume, flood the plate with E3. Before continuing, leave undisturbed until 10-12 mpf to allow egg activation, including full chorion expansion.\n6. Heat Shock Treatment\nNOTE: A heat shock applied in the early embryo inhibits centriole duplication, resulting in an incomplete complement of centrioles to drive spindle formation during the subsequent cell cycle 2. The absence of spindle in turn results in the lack of furrow formation 13.\nAfter expansion of the chorions (10-12 mpf), pour the embryos from the petri plate into a tea strainer. Rinse the petri plate using a wash bottle with E3 in order to collect any remaining embryos in the tea strainer.\nPlace the tea strainer with the embryos inside a beaker in a pre-heated bath with E3 at 28.5 °C. Pre-equilibrate the beaker and E3 to the water bath temperature, and make sure there is enough E3 so that all embryos in the tea strainer are exposed to the medium.",
    "At 22 mpf, remove the tea strainer from the 28.5 °C water bath, briefly blot it onto a paper towel to remove excess moisture, and place it inside a similarly preheated E3 beaker in a heat bath at 41.4 °C.\nAt 24 mpf, transfer the tea strainer back to the E3 in the water bath at 28.5 °C after brief blotting. At 29 mpf, use a wash bottle with E3 to transfer the embryos from the tea strainer to a 10 cm Petri plate.\n7. Selection for Embryos with a One-cycle Cytokinesis Stall\nDuring the time period 35-45 mpf, under a dissecting microscope with a transmitted light source, select those embryos that are undergoing symmetrical cleavage into the 2-cell stage, and which are therefore fertilized. Remove embryos that are not undergoing cell cleavage.\nContinue observing the fertilized embryos, selected for normal cell division during the first cell cycle, and during the second cell cycle (50-65 mpf).\nSort embryos according to the following categories (Figure 2C): 4 cells (\"no stall\", in the 2:2 arrangement standard for a 4-cell embryo); 3 cells (\"partial stall\", in an aberrant 2 smaller cells:1 large cell arrangement); and 2 cells (\"stalled\", embryos exhibiting a one-cell cycle delay in a 1:1 arrangement identical to that of a 2-cell embryo). Sort the stalled embryos into a fresh petri plate.",
    "NOTE: At this stage, embryos in the 2:2 arrangement correspond to those in which during the second cell cycle neither blastomere underwent a cell division stall; embryos in an aberrant 2 smaller cells:1 large cell arrangement correspond to those where heat shock caused a cell cycle stall during the second cell cycle in one blastomere but not the other; and embryos \"stalled\" in a 1:1 arrangement correspond to those where during the second cell cycle both blastomeres underwent the desired cell division stall. Stalled embryos should resume cell cleavage during the following cell cycle period (65-80 mpf). The arrangement of blastomeres may be variable, due to the incomplete cues from the previous cell cycle to stabilize the spindle 2,14, but most embryos will form a relatively normal blastula that can undergo normal development.\nAllow embryos to develop in the Petri plate, with a limit of 80 embryos per 10 cm plate. At 24 hpf, observe the embryos to determine whether they have a normal morphology characteristic of diploid or homozygous diploid embryos 6 (normal extent of axis extension (Figure 3A, 3C)), in contrast to reduced axis extension and increased body thickness characteristic of haploids (Figure 3B)), and/or assess diploidization using genetic pigment markers at 36 mpf, such as golden or albino and other such assays (Figure 3 and see below) 2,6,9.\nRemove any embryos that appear to have a haploid morphology, or that have lysed or exhibit other grossly abnormal defects.\n\tNOTE: If desired, allow embryos to develop until 5 days post fertilization, while continuing to remove lysed or grossly abnormal embryos on a daily basis and adding fresh E3 to refresh the medium. NOTE: Surviving embryos can also be grown after swimbladder inflation on day 5 by transferring to a hatchery system and feeding under standard conditions.",
