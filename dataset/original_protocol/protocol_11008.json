    "1. Measure total ALDH1A1 activity in ovarian cancer cell homogenates via fluorimetry\nThaw 1 × 106 cells in a T25 cell culture flask in 5 mL of the following cell culture media:\n\t\nIGROV-1 and PEO4: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).\nBG-1 and Caov-3: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and 1% P/S.\nOVCAR-3: RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS, 1% P/S, and 0.01 mg/mL insulin.\nMaintain the cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for two to three passages. Ensure the cells do not exceed 80%-90% confluency before passaging.\nTrypsinize the cells in 0.25% trypsin for 10 min, count them using an automated cell counter, and pellet 1 × 107 cells via centrifugation (180 × g) at 25 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant carefully via aspiration, wash the pellet by resuspending the cells in 1 mL of 1x PBS, and re-pellet the cells via centrifugation under the same conditions as described in step 4.\nResuspend the cells in a solution of 1x protease inhibitor in 1x PBS. Use 1 mL of this solution per 2.5 × 106 cells.\nSonicate the cell suspension on ice for 2 min (1 s pulse, 40% amplitude) with a cell homogenizer probe.\nPellet insoluble/membrane fractions via centrifugation (3,200 × g) at 25 °C for 15 min. Remove and keep the supernatant, as this is the homogenate that will be used in subsequent steps. Separate the homogenates into three cuvettes to perform the experiment in triplicate.\nAdd the probe to the homogenate to obtain a final probe concentration of 4 µM. Pipette up and down three times to mix the solution well.",
    "Measure the fluorescent signal immediately after addition and after desired incubation times on a fluorimeter. The incubation time can be optimized to see the maximum fold turn-on (1 h in this experiment). The incubation time must be constant across all cell lines compared.\n\t\nSet the excitation wavelength to 496 nm.\nSet the emission to 510-600 nm.\nSet the slit width to 0.5 mm.\nPipette the solution into a 1 mL quartz cuvette, place into the fluorimeter, and hit scan.\nDivide the final fluorescence intensity at 516 nm (maximum fluorescent wavelength) by the intensity at the same wavelength from the initial reading to determine the fold activation of the isoform-selective dye.\n2. Use of fluorescence microscopy to image cells with high ALDH1A1 activity\nThaw 1 × 106 cells in a T25 cell culture flask in 5 mL of the appropriate cell culture media.\nMaintain the cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for two to three passages. Ensure the cells do not exceed 80%-90% confluency before passaging.\nThe day prior to confocal imaging, plate 4 × 105 cells in an 8-well chamber slide.\n\t\nCoat the bottom of each well with poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/mL, 100 µL per well) for 10 min, subsequently aspirating.\nWash each well 3x by adding cell culture grade water (100 µL per well) and aspirating.\nTrypsinize the cells in 0.25% trypsin for 10 min, count them using an automated cell counter, and plate the cells at 4 × 105 cells per well.\nLet the cells settle and attach overnight (12-16 h).\nAspirate the growth media and add serum-free media (500 µL per well), supplemented with 2 µM of the probe or the control probe.\nIncubate with the probe at room temperature for 30 min and image the cells immediately.",
    "Turn on the confocal microscope and adjust for the sample.\n\t\nLoad the sample carefully at the lowest magnification; find the cells to ensure proper positioning.\nEnsure the objective lens is at 10x magnification and locate the cells.\nFor this experiment, the FITC channel (excitation: 488 nm laser; emission: 516-521 nm) and T-PMT (transmitted light) channel are required. Locate and focus on the cells using T-PMT to focus on the same z-plane for the entirety of the experiment to remove bias.\nAdjust the laser power and FITC gain to the appropriate setting, where the signal from the Ctrl-AlDeSense AM samples is minimally detectable, while still seeing signal in AlDeSense AM samples. Each parameter can be adjusted by sliding the corresponding bar. The settings may have to be adjusted a few times to identify the correct parameters. Once optimized, complete the rest of the experiment within that cell line using identical parameters.\nSnap three images per well for a total of three wells per treatment condition (nine images in total). Focus on the proper plane using T-PMT to avoid bias rather than using the fluorescence channel or merged image.\nProcess the images to determine the percentage of ALDH1A1+ cells.\n\t\nUsing image processing software, split the czi file into different channels.\nCount the total number of cells and the total number of fluorescent cells.\nTo determine the percentage of ALDH1A1+ cells, divide the number of fluorescent cells by the total number of cells in each image. It is imperative to count the same way for each image without manipulating the images, as, for instance, adjusting the brightness may add a confounding variable.\n3. Application of flow cytometry to identify cells with high ALDH1A1 activity",
    "Thaw 1 × 106 cells in a T25 cell culture flask in 5 mL of the appropriate cell culture media.\nMaintain the cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for two to three passages. Ensure the cells do not exceed 80%-90% confluency before passaging.\nTrypsinize, count, and pellet the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube via centrifugation (180 × g) at 25 °C for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of 2 µM probe/control probe solution in PBS. Rock the cells at room temperature for 60 min to ensure exposure to the dye is even.\nAfter the incubation period, pellet the cells via centrifugation (180 × g) at 25 °C for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 0.5 mL of PBS. Run the cells through a cell strainer (35 µm nylon mesh) to remove cell clumps that may clog the flow cytometer. Immediately place the cells on ice.\nTurn the instrument on and run the start-up protocol.\nCheck for sheath fluid and empty waste.\nRun the lines with 10% bleach and water for 5 min each.\nRun quality control beads to ensure proper function.\nIn the settings tab, select FSC (forward scatter), SSC (side scatter), and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) for the fluorescence filter.\nDraw the following graphs to gate for viability, singlets, and fluorescence. Optimize the laser power (specific to user's instrument) so that the cell populations are within the given parameters for further analysis.\n\t\nFSC-A versus SSC-A scatter plot: main cell population is near the center of the graph.\nFSC-A versus FSC-W scatter plot: narrow horizontal band indicative of singlets (rather than cell clumps).\nFITC-A versus FSC-A scatter plot: observe the distribution of cells sorted by the isoform-selective fluorogenic turn-on probe.",
    "FITC-A histogram: observe the shift in population based on FITC to determine the percentage of ALDH1A1+ cells.\nTo optimize the FITC laser power, run a sample with the probe so that the right tail of the histogram curve is near the maximum FITC-A signal. Subsequently, run a sample with the control probe. A population shift should be observable to reveal the maximum dynamic range. The laser power optimization step may have to be repeated multiple times, but the laser power should not be altered across samples once a setting has been designated for an experiment.\nRun each sample for 10,000 counts (done in triplicate).\nRepeat step 3.12 for each cell line, as there will be variability in uptake and ALDH1A1 activity.\nAfter completion of sample collection, run the lines with 10% bleach and water for 5 min each, then initiate shutdown of the instrument.\nProcess the data using the flow cytometry software and gate the desired cell population. Set the gates so that all events fall into either the ALDH1A1- or ALDH1A1+ gate. Using the rectangle gate selection, set the ALDH1A1- gate so that >99.5% of events in the control probe samples occur within this gate. The remaining cells will be considered ALDH1A1+. These same gates can then be applied to the probe sample to quantify the number of events considered ALDH1A1- and ALDH1A1+.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
