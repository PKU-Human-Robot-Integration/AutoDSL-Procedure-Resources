    "The testing protocol was approved by the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Ethics Committee.\n1. Vibration Detection Threshold (VDT)\nDevice and Testing Protocol Assembly – Pretesting\n\t\nAssemble the components of the device according to Figure 1A. Place a smooth-surfaced board (40 cm x 80 cm) on a table. Place the brass bar on the board.\nConnect the piezoelectric actuator (vibration stimulator) to the controller unit.\nConnect the response box and the monitor device to the data acquisition system (see supplemental code file).\nConnect the data acquisition system to a computer (or laptop), and to piezo actuator controller unit.\nScrew the custom-made stimulating probe to the moving part of the piezoelectric actuator (for specifics of the probe see Materials).\nMount the piezoelectric actuator with the probe on the balanced brass bar.\nTesting Protocol\n\t\nScript a test protocol that implements the two interval forced-choice and transformed-rule up and down method. See supplemental code file for an outline of the script.\nConstruct the waveform of the vibration stimulus as a sinusoidal wave and specify stimulus duration, rise and fall characteristics.\n\t\t\nOpen software (e.g., LabChart). Select Setup > Stimulator.\nChoose a custom waveform and configure the stimulator options. Create 2 stimulus waveforms pertaining to each interval (stim1 and stim2).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The waveform stim1 is composed of 3 parts: a delay of 4 sec, followed by a sinusoidal wave of 1.8 sec, and a delay of 1.8 sec (no stimulus). The waveform stim 2 is composed of 3 parts: a delay of 4 sec, followed a delay of 1.8 sec (no stimulus), and by a sinusoidal wave of 1.8 sec.\nFor the sinusoidal waveform, create new variable parameters for frequency and amplitude. Modify the sinusoidal wave function by inputting the following functions to the rise and fall.\n\t\t\tRise waveform: (1-e-bt)∙Amplitude∙sine(frequency), b = 9.1\n\t\t\tFall waveform: (e-bt)∙Amplitude∙sine(frequency), b = 9.1",
    "In the data panel of the lab chart, create the set of 35 voltage outputs pertaining to the 35 amplitude intensities (or levels) of the vibration stimulus. See Table 1.\nSet the starting/default amplitude of the vibration stimulus for the tested vibration frequency in the macro script for the testing procedure (see supplemental code file section).\nPreparation and Training of Subjects – Testing Session\n\t\nInform test subjects about the testing procedure and have them sign a written consent form. To ensure anonymity and fulfill data protection requirements, assign each participant a number.\nSeat the subjects comfortably in a quiet room at temperatures between 20-30 °C. Instruct them about the test in a simple and clear manner so that the subject knows what to expect during the testing.\nPlace the arm of the subject on the board. Pad the little finger with medical dough to minimize movement. Place the brass bar on the board to position the probe on the little finger of the tested hand just below the nail bed. Ensure proper contact between the probe and the skin and adjust the position of the probe to a horizontal position using the water-level. Avoid skin contact with the edges of the circular flat probe.\n\t\tNOTE: This ensures that the flat surface of the probe applies around 30 g (0.3 N) to the skin surface. Sharp edges can lead to decreased detection thresholds. The heavy mass of the brass bar prevents the transmission of distracting oscillations from the surroundings to the device and minimizes dissipation of the applied sine wave.",
    "Prior to testing, get the participants familiarized with the setup. Depending on the testing frequency, present both an easy (level 23) and a hard (level 7) to perceive vibration stimulus by varying the amplitude until the subject perceives a vibration to ensure that the experimental procedure is understood.\nIf necessary, reset the starting (default) amplitude at the selected frequency so that the subject can easily detect the stimulus when the testing protocol starts (see 1.2.3).\nMinimize interactions between subject and examiner during the test.\nStart the test by running the script that uses the two-alternative forced-choice procedure with the up-down adaptive method22.\n\t\tNOTE: Actions in 1.3.7-1.3.12 are automated by the program script.\nIn each trial, randomly administer a vibration stimulus during one of the two intervals that are visually indicated to the test subject as \"1\" and \"2\" on the screen of the monitor (Figure 1B). Have the subject indicate if the first or second sequential intervals contained the vibration stimulus by pressing one of two buttons \"1\" or \"2\" on the response box. Let the subject make a guess if he or she is not sure when the stimulus is presented.\n\t\tNOTE: The forced-choice technique requires that the subject responds even when the vibration is not perceived.\nIn a trial series, which consists of 6 to a maximum of 9 single trials, repeat the same vibration stimulus at one amplitude level at least six times consecutively. If the responses are all correct, reduce the stimulus intensity level (down rule) for the subsequent trial series.",
    "Based on the decision rule of the adaptive method (logical operators in script), grant the subject more trials to the same stimulus intensity if the subject makes errors in a trial series. Reduce the stimulus intensity if the stimulus is correctly identified in at least 5 trials, and incorrectly in less than 2 trials.\nIncrease the stimulus level if the subject makes the 2 incorrect responses in a trial series; or, more than one incorrect response and fewer than 5 correct responses.\nDocument the change in the direction of stimulus intensity, as reversal point. Change the stimulus intensity according to reversal point number: prior to the third reversal point by 4 intensity levels; at the 3rd reversal point by 2 intensity levels; else by 1 level (for more detail see supplemental code file and Figure 4B).\nEnd the testing when the subject completes a total of 8 reversals.\nCalculate the VDT by taking the median of the stimulus amplitude value of the last 6 reversals.\n2. Tactile Spatial Acuity Test\nDetermine tactile acuity with a two-alternative forced choice grating orientation test using the Tactile Acuity Cube (TAC). The TAC is comprised of 6 sides each containing a grating (bar and groove) whose widths are 0.75 mm, 1.25 mm, 1.75 mm, 3.0 mm, 4.5 mm, and 6.0 mm.\nSeat subjects in a quiet room at temperatures between 20-30 °C and instruct on the task.\nDuring the experiment, blindfold the test subjects using shielded eyeglasses. Place the dominant hand on a table with the palmar surface facing up.\nOn each trial, apply the TAC to the finger pad at one of two grating orientations: vertically (parallel direction) or horizontally (transverse direction) aligned to the long axis of the finger. Randomly choose the order of the grating orientation for each trial.",
    "Apply the gratings of the TAC for 2 sec to the finger pad of the index finger so that the cube exerts its whole weight on the finger (233 g). Avoid pressing the TAC on the finger pad.\nAsk the subjects to determine the orientation of the alignment before the cube is removed from their finger.\nAvoid movement of the participant's finger because it might provide a cue to the orientation. Discard the trial if the experimenter senses that the finger has moved.\n\tNOTE: Beware that small finger movements might not be detected by the experimenter in the procedure.\nEmploy a two-down and one-up adaptive method in the staircase algorithm.\nStart with the largest grating, 6.0 mm.\nDecrease the grating width after two correct identification of the orientation (correct response).\nTest the next, smaller width and continue with the stepping rule until the subject makes an incorrect response and document the grating width as a reversal point.\nIncrease the grating width stepwise again until the two orientations of a width are determined correctly again.\nEnd the test after completion of thirteen reversals.\nCalculate the tactile grating orientation threshold by taking the median of the grating widths of the last 10 reversals.\nSubscription Required.
