    "1)\tPreparation\nTo begin, seat the subject in a comfortable chair in front of a computer screen.\nUse a tape measure to ensure the distance between the screen and the subject's nasion is 60 cm.\nFinally, place a light-blocking mask over the subject's eyes.\n2) Determining Phosphene Threshold over V1/V2\nKnowing the subject's phosphene threshold will be important when exploring phosphenic behavior later in this protocol.  To determine this threshold, first set the TMS machine to 70% power.\nHold the coil so the top of the figure-8 faces cranial midline.\nBegin single-pulse stimulation at a point about 3 cm above the inion.\nAfter each pulse, ask the subject to report any phosphenic experience.\nBegin moving the coil in a small search grid around this region (V1/V2).\nDetermine the location where stimulation elicits consistent and unambiguous phosphene reports from the subject.  It has been theorized that TMS will be unable to elicit phosphenes in around 40% of the population, so there is a chance the subject will not report anything.  If this is the case, unfortunately, this experiment will not work.  The subject should be allowed to leave.\nOnce the phosphenic \"hotspot\" has been located, adjust the TMS power output up and down until the subject reports phosphenes for exactly 3 of 6 consecutive pulses.  This power level is the subject's V1/V2 threshold. If available, neuronavigation can be used to achieve greater spatial precision when locating and targeting the V1/V2 hotspot.\n3) Determining Phosphenic Threshold over the V5/MT+ Complex\nUsing the same aforementioned procedure and parameters, we will now determine phosphene threshold over the V5/MT+ complex.  To locate this region, begin at a point 3 cm dorsal and 5 cm lateral to the subject's inion.\nAfter each pulse, ask the subject to report any phosphenic experience.",
    "Again, using single pulses, begin a small search grid pattern until unambiguous and consistent phosphenes are elicited.\nFinally, adjust the TMS power output up and down until the subject reports phosphenes for exactly 3 of 6 consecutive pulses.  This power level is the subject's V5/MT+ complex threshold. Again, if available, neuronavigation can be used to achieve greater spatial precision when locating and targeting the V5/MT+ hotspot.\n4)\tDetermining Baseline Phosphene Behavior\nOnce phosphene threshold has been determined for both visual areas, we need to measure baseline phosphenic behavior.  To do this, first remove the subject's light-blocking mask.\nNext, instruct the subject to stare at a stable fixation cross presented in the center of the computer screen for 60 seconds.\nReplace the mask and, over the V1/V2 hot spot, generate a single pulse train for 3-seconds at 120% V1/V2 threshold.\nWait five-seconds and conduct another train.\nAgain, wait five-seconds and conduct a third train.\nAfter the third single pulse train, ask the subject to describe the location and motive characteristics of any elicited phosphenes.  This will be the baseline.\nRepeat this same procedure over the V5/MT+ hot spot (remember to reset the TMS power to 120% of the V5/MT+ threshold).\n5) Condition Number One\nOnce the phophenic baseline has been determined, remove the subject's light-blocking mask once again.\nInstruct the subject to stare at a stable fixation cross presented in the center of the computer screen for 60 seconds.  This time, rather than a blank screen, we will embed a series of moving dots at several locations around the cross.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2273/2273fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Adapting stimuli for condition one: simple translational motion.  All dots move coherently either to the left or right.",
    "Make sure all the dots are moving in the same direction.  This stimulus should serve to engender visual adaptation: a phenomenon in which changes in neural excitability as induced by prolonged exposure to a stimuli serves to bias the perception of subsequently presented stimuli.\nAfter 60 seconds, replace the mask and, over the V1/V2 hotspot, generate a single pulse train for 3 seconds at 120% V1/V2 threshold.\nWait five-seconds and repeat two more times.\nAfter three trains, ask the subject to report the locations and motive characteristics of any elicited phosphenes. If available, the use of an eye movement tracking system in a dark room can help achieve greater precision and quantitative monitoring of the eye movements made by subjects during phosphene elicitations.\nContinue this three-train/report sequence until phosphene behavior returns to baseline activity.\nRepeat this procedure for the V5/MT+ complex hotspot.\n6)\tCondition Number Two\nIn this second condition, repeat the same procedure utilized for condition one.  This time, however, rather than presenting the subject with a series of dots moving in a singular direction, present the subject with a series of dots each moving in its relative cardinal direction away from a central point - similar to a \"star burst\" pattern.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2273/2273fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Adapting stimuli for condition two: radial motion.  Dots move in respective cardinal directions either towards or away from a central point.\nAs before, after 60 seconds, replace the mask, conduct a series of three, 120% threshold trains over V1/V2, ask for a subject report, and continue until baseline returns.\nRepeat for V5/MT+.\n7) Diagram",
    "As an option, after each condition (or after all conditions are completed), ask the subject to draw the regions and motive behavior of each series of phopsphenes onto a graph.  This is not an integral step but will supply you with another set of interpretable data.\n8) Representative Results\nVisual adaptation to the uni-directional motive stimuli should elicit an identical phosphenic movement over V1/V2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2273/2273fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of phosphenes induced from V1/V2 in the right and left hemisphere during condition one (based on the drawings of subjects).\nThe V5/MT+ complex phosphenes should also be affected, such that the phosphene now will appear as a sum of the motion direction in the adapting stimulus and the baseline phosphene.\nHowever, visual adaptation to the starburst pattern should elicit an identical starburst phosphenic movement from the V5/MT+ complex, but should not change the V1/V2 baseline.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2273/2273fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
