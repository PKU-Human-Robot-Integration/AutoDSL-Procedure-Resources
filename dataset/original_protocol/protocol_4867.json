    "Growth of Rhodobacter capsulatus and spheroplast preparation, preparation of Cu-free MPYE and Cu-free waterGrow cultures under sterile conditions of the required Rhodobacter strains on MPYE agar plates (~24 h, at 35 °C) including antibiotics if required.Prepare MPYE medium for liquid culture, Cu-free MPYE and Cu-free water (see Recipes).Pick a single colony using a sterile inoculation loop and inoculate 10 ml MPYE in a 50 ml Falcon tube. Add appropriate antibiotics if required. Grow cultures at 35 °C and 110 rpm in a rotary shaker overnight.Next day: Inoculate the main culture (100 ml MPYE in 250 ml flask) with 108 cells from the overnight culture and incubate at 35 °C, 110 rpm until the culture reaches an OD685 of 1 (approx. 24 h, assuming that an OD685 = 1 corresponds to 7.5 x 108 cells/ml). This corresponds to the late exponential growth phase of R. capsulatus. Harvest the cells using a pre-cooled Lynx 6000 centrifuge (4 °C), at 5,000 rpm (corresponds to 3,000 x g in the F12-6 x 500 LEX rotor) for 20 min. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 40 ml pre-cooled Cu-free MPYE and centrifuge once more at 5,000 rpm (3,000 x g, F12-6 x 500 LEX rotor) for 20 min at 4 °C.Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 ml spheroplast buffer and take a small aliquot of 50 µl for determining the protein concentration, e.g., by the Lowry assay (see Data analysis).Split the cell suspension in two equal parts into two clean 15 ml Falcon tubes. One tube is for measuring the copper concentration in whole cells, while cells in the other tube are used for spheroplast preparation. This allows measuring the copper content in the cytoplasm (spheroplasts), periplasm (supernatant after spheroplast preparation) and whole cells.",
    "Spheroplast preparationAdd lysis buffer to the spheroplast sample fraction in a dilution of 1:10 to reach a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml of lysozyme, e.g., add 100 µl lysis buffer to 900 µl sample.Incubate the cell suspension 15 min on ice with gentle mixing i.e., turning the tubes upside down several times every few minutes. After 15 min, the majority of cells are converted into spheroplasts; longer incubations might be required for other Gram-negative bacteria. Monitor spheroplast formation by using a microscope. Collect the spheroplasts by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm (3,000 x g, F12-6 x 500 LEX rotor) for 20 min at 4 °C. Carefully collect the supernatant (periplasm), preferentially using a 1,000 µl automatic pipet into a clean 15 ml Falcon tube.Resuspend the pellet (cytoplasm) with 1 ml spheroplast buffer.Take aliquots of 50 µl from each fraction and measure the protein concentration of all samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923200105_3543.jpgFigure 1. Monitoring the spheroplast formation. A. R.capsulatus cells observed at 100x magnification. B. Spheroplasts formation observed at 100x magnification. Spheroplasts are indicated by arrows.Determination of Cu-concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopyTo approximately 1 ml of whole cells, spheroplasts and the supernatant (after the spheroplast preparation) in 15 ml Falcon tubes, add 1.5 ml of 53% nitric acid. This treatment and the following incubation at high temperatures completely denature the protein solutions and releases any bound metal. Incubate for 1 h at 80 °C and subsequently at 60 °C overnight without shaking.After overnight-incubation, stop the digestion by the addition of 300 µl H2O2 (30% in water) and adjust the samples to a final volume of 10 ml by adding Cu-free water. If any insoluble impurities are observed, the solution is filtrated through a 0.45 µm disposable syringe-filter. The prepared samples are now stable and can be stored for several days at room temperature.",
    "The copper content is measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer measuring 3 times for 3 sec of atomization. Load 20 µl sample and 5 µl modifier containing 0.005 mg palladium and 0.003 mg magnesium (functioning as ionization agent).Blank measurement (0.2% nitric acid in ultra-pure water), calculate mean and set to 0.Calibrate the spectrophotometer by measuring 3 standards containing 20, 40 and 60 ppb of Cu.Measure the samples. If the values are out of range, dilute the samples 1:2 or 1:3.Analysis of the copper content is achieved by the Perkin-Elmer AAWinLab software. For every value the standard deviation (SD) and relative standard deviation (RSD) is calculated by the software.Plot the data in excel using protein concentrations and copper measurements. Calculate the total copper amount of your 10 ml sample and divide it through the total protein mass, calculated by protein quantification assay and the sample volumes before adding the nitric acid using the following formula:µg Cu/mg protein = (X Cu ppb x 10 ml)/(X mg/ml protein x X ml sample volume)Note: Cu ppb refers to Cu µg/L."
