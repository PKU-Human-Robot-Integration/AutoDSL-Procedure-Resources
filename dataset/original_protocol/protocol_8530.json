    "The following experimental protocol followed the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, and the human subject gave written informed consent before participating in the study.\nNote: For the purpose of demonstration, a simple odor stimulation paradigm using a commercially available, MRI-compatible olfactometer is presented. This paradigm has proven effective in reducing the habituation effect and has produced reliable olfactory fMRI data15. Certain steps outlined in this protocol may be specific to the type of olfactometer used. However, any type of equipment—home-made or commercially available with similar capabilities—may be used in an analogous fashion. The olfactometer must be capable of monitoring respiration as well as presenting a sequence of odorants with precise timing. Make sure that the whole odor delivery system (including the olfactometer) is built with materials inert to odorant chemicals (e.g., glass and polytetrafluoroethylene), and the odor pathway is smooth and air-tight with minimal dead space.\n1. Paradigm Design\nCreate a new paradigm by specifying the airflow valve sequence on a programmable olfactometer.\n\tNOTE: The valve sequence is the order and timing of the opening and closing of specific air channels that hold different concentrations or types of odorants. In this demonstration, each of the valves for the six channels was opened twice for a total of twelve odor deliveries. Whenever one valve was open, all the other valves were closed, and each valve was opened again only after all the other valves had already opened once.\n\t\nAssign duration for the stimulus (the opening of a specific channel) as well as duration for the channel to be closed.\n\t\tNOTE: In this demonstration, the duration for the odor presentation was 6 s, while the duration for the channels to be closed varied from 22 s to 38 s.",
    "Set the number of repetitions for the sequence of valve opens and closes. Here, the number of repetitions is 1.\nInterleave each odorant presentation with a presentation of odorless air at the same flow rate. For example, deliver the airflow to the subject with or without odor at a flow rate of 6 L/min in 50% relative humidity and room temperature at 22 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: This is important, as variations in airflow may cause tactile sensation.\n2. Odorant Preparation\nChoose a proper odorant for the odor stimulation paradigm by considering the odor valence, pleasantness, intensity, familiarity, and trigeminal component (see Table 1).\n\tNote: Table 1 lists some commonly used odorants. Lavender odor was chosen for this demonstration because it has minimal trigeminal stimulation at low to moderate concentrations and is generally perceived as pleasant and familiar.\nChoose a proper solvent (e.g., water, mineral oil, 1,2-propanediol, ethanol) to prepare the odorant solutions.\n\tNOTE: Here, 1,2-propanediol was used as the solvent for odorant solution preparation.\nChoose a proper odorant concentration for the odor stimulation paradigm. For example, dilute lavender oil in 1,2-propanediol at 0.10% (volume/volume) concentration for the olfactory stimulation19.\n\tNOTE: This can be done by a psychophysical evaluation of a series of different concentrations by a group of normal subjects.\nPut the proper odorant solutions in the odorant containers. Ensure that all containers have the same amount of space, same amount of solution, and same surface area for the solution. For example, use six 300-mL size glass bottles as the odorant containers with each bottle holding 50 mL of 0.10% lavender oil solution.\nConnect all the odorant containers to the proper channels for odor delivery.\n3. Olfactometer Set-up",
    "Check the connections to ensure that all odorant containers are properly attached to the odorant carrier. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the seal. Proper tightness is ensured in a later step by checking the airflow through each odorant container.\nPlace the odorant carrier in the magnet room and connect each tube to the olfactometer outside of the room, as the main unit is not MR-compatible. Visually check for any kinks in the tubing, as this will affect airflow. The airflow of each channel will be checked in a later step.\nSecurely connect all tubes from the olfactometer to the odorant carrier by matching the numbers to the correct ports. For accuracy, color-code the tubes, such that pink for channel 1, blue for channel 2, etc.\nEnsure the air flow through all the channels is consistent by attaching a flowmeter to the output end of the tubing. Manually open each channel on the control panel of the olfactometer, adjust the total air flow as well as flow rates of each channel and the flush line until the flow rate of each channel is consistent.\nConnect the face mask or nose piece to the odorant carrier with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing. Make sure that the air flow (e.g., 6 L/min) delivered to the subject is consistent when the channels are switched.\nConnect the radiofrequency trigger from the MRI system to the “trigger in” port on the olfactometer to synchronize the odor stimulation paradigm and fMRI image acquisition. An optical-electrical signal converter may be needed.\nAdjust the total air flow and flow rates for each channel and the flush line to the designed amounts. For example, a total air flow of 6 L/min and the flow rates for each channel and the flush line to be 3 L/min.",
    "Connect the pneumatic respiratory sensor belt to the response port of the olfactometer via the pneumatic-electrical signal converter box.\nIf a subjective response is needed, connect the pneumatic response pad to the response port of the olfactometer via the pneumatic-electrical signal converter box.\n4. Experimental Procedure\nConduct a pre-screening to ensure that the MRI procedure is safe for the subject.\n\t\nAsk the subject about medical history, including potential implants, claustrophobia, or other preexisting conditions that may interfere with the subject’s ability to safely participate in the fMRI study. Additionally, perform a smell threshold test of the odorants to ensure that the subject can smell the odorants during the experiment.\nHave the subject lie supine on the MRI examination bed. Place the face mask or nose piece properly on the subject to ensure air blows into the nostrils. Place the respiratory sensor on either the chest or abdomen. Ask the subject to breathe normally. Manually adjust the tightness and placement of the belt holding the respiratory sensor according to the respiration pattern seen on the olfactometer display.\nCreate a data folder to record the respiratory data in the olfactometer. Click \"file manager\", enter the subject ID assigned to the current subject, then \"confirm\" the input.\nUse the \"paradigm check\" option to test the synchronization of odor delivery and inhalation without involving stimulus delivery, and if necessary, manually adjust the \"valve delay\" time to ensure the onset of odor delivery is synchronized with the subject's inhalation phase.\nSet the synchronization between odor stimulation and fMRI image acquisition by selecting “trigg-in” mode on the control unit of the olfactometer.",
    "Note: This allows the odor stimulation paradigm to be started with an external trigger over the “trigger in” port originated from the MRI system. Thus, the paradigm will not run until the external trigger from the scanner is received. Please note what kind of trigger pulse (electrical or light) that the MRI scanner sends out. A signal converter may be needed to link the two systems.\nActivate the respiratory trigger by selecting “resp trigger start” on the control unit of the olfactometer.\n\tNote: When activated, the start of each paradigm sequence element is synchronized with inhalation. This can be achieved empirically by delaying the odor delivery approximately half of a cycle of respiration from the beginning of the exhalation phase.\nStart the fMRI image acquisition on the MRI console; the odor stimulation paradigm will start as soon as image acquisition starts. Monitor the respiration pattern for any irregular respiratory activity.\n\tNote: Irregular respiratory activity may be in the form of plateaus, wider and longer cycles, or erratic waves. Here, a BOLD signal-sensitive T2*-weighted echo-planar-imaging sequence was used for fMRI image acquisition with 2,000 ms repetition time, 30 ms echo time, 90° flip angle, 220 mm × 220 mm field of view, 80 × 80 acquisition matrix, 30 4-mm-thick axial slices, and acceleration factor of 2 for integrated parallel imaging techniques. \nAt the completion of the imaging protocol, move the subject out of the magnet and remove the face mask/nose piece.\n5. Olfactometer Clean-up\nPower off the air pump. Detach the odorant containers from the odorant carrier and replace with clean, empty ones.\nPower on the air pump. Flush each channel with odorless air for 5 min to remove residual odorants in the air line.\nShut down the olfactometer.",
    "Disinfect the nose piece or face mask with alcohol wipes. Rinse the face mask or nose piece with warm water and then air dry.\n6. Data Analysis\nTo process the data, load the respiration data file to the open-source software Olfactory Network Stimulation Editing Tool (ONSET) (www.pennstatehershey.org/web/nmrlab/resources/software/onset)15\n\tNote: The ONSET software was developed by Xiaoyu Sun. Onsets of odor stimulation based on the timing of the paradigm and respiration trace will be automatically detected. The actual stimulation vector is defined as the start time of each effective inhalation during odor delivery.\n\t\nMeasure and compare the respiration rate and volume (the area under each inhalation and exhalation phase pair) between odor and odorless periods15.\n\t\tNOTE: There should be no significant difference in these respiratory parameters between the odor and odorless periods.\nProcess the fMRI data with the actual onset and duration vectors from ONSET for the activation of the central olfactory system15.\nSubscription Required.
