    "Blood should be collected from consenting healthy volunteers and processed in accordance with local rules. This protocol measures agonist-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) by light transmission aggregometry (LTA). The ISTH provides standardized protocols, including a 2013 method for PRP preparation and LTA9.  Collect whole blood into 4% sodium citrate as per ISTH recommendations in accordance with local ethics committee rules. Exclude donors that have taken any NSAID within the past 2 weeks.\n1. Assay procedure\nTake an aliquot of stock CRP-XL and dilute it in assay (Tyrodes10) buffer (Table 1) to a starting concentration that will cause maximum aggregation (see the NOTE below step 1.3).\n\tNOTE: In the literature, a concentration of 1 μg/mL will induce maximum aggregation, but some labs need higher concentrations to reach the same effect - adjust the dilution series accordingly\nMake a corresponding dilution series with the standard (see the NOTE below step 1.3 and Figure 1) such that the concentrations are the same as the test reagent.\nProduce a 6- to 8-point dilution series for the test and the standard, again in assay buffer, that takes the aggregation response from 100% to 0% aggregation. An example showing an 8-point dilution series concentration curve is shown in Table 2.",
    "NOTE: Some labs add agonist at a total of 10% assay volume, e.g., 50 μL of agonist to 450 μL of platelets, such that they dilute a 10x concentration to a final 1x concentration in the assay, while others add smaller (more concentrated) volumes of agonist, e.g., 5 μL of agonist to 495 μL of platelets - just make sure that the dilution series is appropriate for the assay bearing in mind how the volume displacement affects platelet concentration - again, be consistent. In the example, 30 μL of 10x agonist is added to 270 μL of platelet rich plasma (PRP).\nOnce the platelets are rested and ready to use, aliquot them into LTA cuvettes, add a stir bar, and allow them to reach 37 °C in the holding wells.\nOnce at temperature, place the cuvette(s) into the aggregometer and begin recording the trace(s). Add the agonist (with stirring) and record the data.\nRepeat step 1.4 for each concentration of the test and standard until the data needed to plot the curves has been collected (example curves shown in Figure 2).\nCalculate the potency of the test reagent relative to that of the standard; again, use any metric - maximum aggregation or area under the curve - as long as there is consistency and the analysis model appropriately fits the data.\n2. Checking the concentration curves\nFirst, check that the concentration response curves are parallel. There are many software packages that do this, but here the process is described for Graphpad Prism (see Figure 3).\n\t\nEnter the data so that log(concentration) is on the X axis and response (% maximum aggregation/AUC) is on the Y axis (Figure 3A)\nTransform CRP-XL concentrations (Figure 3B)\nSelect Non-Linear Regression from the Analysis functions and use the equation for dose-response stimulation/inhibition.",
    "Select log (agonist) vs. response (variable slope) - use 3- or 4-way fit depending on which is best for the data.\nDetermine whether the curves are parallel by using the Compare tab (as shown in Figure 3C) and click on the button to compare the datasets to ensure that the slope (Hill slope) and asymptotes (the Top and Bottom of the curves) are equivalent. In this example, the Hill slope for the test is 2.279, and that of the standard is 2.025 giving a ratio of 1.125.\nIf the slopes are parallel (for example, an acceptance criterion of slope ratio between 0.8-1.25) and the asymptotes are equivalent, proceed with potency (EC50) calculation using steps 2.1.3 and 2.1.4. In the example shown here, the asymptotes have been constrained as the evaluation in step 2.1.5 confirmed that the asymptotes are equivalent.\nDivide the EC50 value of the standard by that of the test to determine the relative potency. In the example shown here, test/standard (0.07259/0.1498) = 0.4846, i.e., the 'test' is half as potent as the standard.\nAdjust mass/volume concentrations to account for the difference in potency, i.e., if the standard was used previously at 1 µg/mL, the new material would be used at 1/0.4846 = 2.063 µg/mL) to ensure comparable amounts of active material are being used in experiments"
