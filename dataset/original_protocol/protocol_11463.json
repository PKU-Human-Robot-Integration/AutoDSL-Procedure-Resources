  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The Boyden chamber and scratch assays without inclusion of the ECM are referred to as the migration assay, and the same assays with the ECM is referred to as the invasion assay.\n1. Boyden Chamber Assay\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted for the SQ20B cell line, which is derived from a recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) laryngeal cancer and was obtained from John Little (Boston, MA, USA).\nDay 1\nCell Seeding\nSeed 2 106 SQ20B cells in 12 mL of culture medium (CM) in a 175 cm2 flask 72 h before day one and allow the cells to grow to 80% cell confluence.\n\t\t\nTo prepare CM for SQ20B cells, supplement Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.04 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 g/L streptomycin.\nUnder a laminar flow hood, trypsinize the cells. Remove the medium, wash the cells with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and add 2.5 mL of trypsin ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.5 g/L). Incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C and then stop the reaction by adding 12.5 mL of CM warmed to 37 °C. Count the number of cells using a cell counter.\nSeed the cells in a 25 cm2 flask at a cell density of 6 105 cells for each condition to be evaluated. Incubate the cells for 24 h in 3 mL of CM.\nDay 2\nCell starvation and preparation of coated chambers\nStarve the cells by replacing the medium in each flask with 3 mL of low-fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium using 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) instead of FBS. Starve the cells for 24 h in the incubator.\n\t\t\nTo prepare starvation CM (s-CM), supplement DMEM with 0.1% BSA, 0.04 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 g/L streptomycin.",
    "For the migration assay, go to step 1.3.\nFor the invasion assay, 12 h before day 3, prepare the coated Boyden chambers by adding 500 μL of s-CM to each coated chamber. Use commercially prepared coated Boyden chambers and keep them at 4 °C before use. Place each Boyden chamber in the companion plate and set it in the incubator at 37 °C overnight.\nDay 3\nCell seeding in the Boyden chamber\nUse the companion plate to prepare the chemoattractant.Fill each well of the 24-well companion plate with 750 μL of complete medium with 10% FBS, 0.04 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 g/L streptomycin.\n\t\t\nAdapt the chemoattractant for each cell line and each treatment condition. To prepare the chemoattractant CM (ca-CM), supplement DMEM with 10% FCS, 0.4 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 g/L streptomycin.\nTransfer the upper chamber into the prefilled companion plate, taking care to avoid bubbles.\nFor the invasion assay, carefully remove 450 μL of CM from each Boyden chamber.\nUnder a laminar flow hood, trypsinize the cells. Remove the medium, wash the cells with sterile PBS, add 0.5 mL of trypsin EDTA (0.5 g/L), and then incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C. Stop the reaction by adding CM warmed to 37 °C. Count the number of cells using a cell counter.\nSeed 3 104 SQ20B cells in 500 μL of 0.1% BSA medium, giving a final dilution of 6 104 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell concentration should be adapted for each cell line.\nPlace the plate into the incubator at 37 °C for 24 h.\nDay 4\nCell fixation and staining\nFix the cells before the doubling time specific to that cell line. Fix SQ20B cells before 24 h.",
    "Remove each insert from the companion plate and carefully remove the cells from the upper chamber using a cotton swab. It is particularly important to remove all cells located in the upper chamber.\nFix and stain each insert individually to obtain May-Grunwald Giemsa coloration9 using the staining kit provided. Alternatively, use 4% paraformaldehyde in another companion plate for a 30 min fixation.\nKeep the inserts in an empty 24-well companion plate under a laboratory hood to dry each chamber.\nDay 5\nMicroscopic analysis\nInsert the companion plate with the inserts onto a 20 phase-contrast microscope and count each migrated cell on the lower part of the membrane. Optimize the right focus position by moving the objective from the bottom to the top, and stop the position on the bottom part of the membrane.\nCalculate the ratio between the numbers of migrated cells and seeded cells. Repeat each count for each treatment condition in triplicate.\n2. Scratch Wound Assay: Cell Migration\nNOTE: Instructions must be adapted for each type of cell.\nDay 1\nCell Seeding\nSeed 2 x 106 SQ20B cells in 12 mL of CM in a 175 cm2 flask 72 h before day one and allow the cells to grow to 80% cell confluence.\nUnder a laminar flow hood, trypsinize the cells. Remove the medium, wash the cells with sterile PBS, add 2.5 mL of trypsin EDTA (0.5 g/L), and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C. Stop the reaction by adding 12.5 mL of CM warmed to 37 °C. Count the number of cells using a cell counter.",
    "Generate a prediluted sample at a cell density of 4 x 105/mL, giving a final density of 4 104 cells per 100 μL in each well. This concentration must be adapted for each cell line and should be in the range of 1 x 104 to 6 104 cells.\nSeed cells into each well of a 96-well plate by depositing 100 μL of the solution prepared in step 2.1.2.\nLeave the plate at room temperature for 5 min to disperse the cells evenly on the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the plate into the incubator and allow the cells to adhere to the plate for 12 to 16 h (maximum) at 37 °C.\nDay 2\nScratch wound assay\nRemove the plates prepared in step 2.1 from the incubator.\nUnder the hood, make a wound using the commercial wounding device according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nImmediately remove the medium from each well using a pipette with an adapted conical tip, taking care not to touch the wound.\nWash the cells twice by repeating the aspiration and using 100 μL of CM warmed to 37 °C for each well.\nRemove the CM using a pipette with an adapted conical tip after the washing steps.\nAdd 100 μL of medium specific for each treatment condition to each well.\nTry to avoid creating any bubbles in the wells. A reverse-pipetting technique may be helpful here. Alternatively, remove bubbles with a syringe needle.\nPlace the plate into the adapted rack of the video microscope.\nTo improve the image quality, allow the plate to warm for at least 15 min before the first scan to avoid condensation on the lower side of the plate.",
    "Program the schedule of scans, using the video microscope software at one image per well. A maximum 2-h interval is required for an invasion-migration experiment. If the objective of the experiment is to produce a video, an interval of 30 min maximum is preferred.\nAt the end of the experiment, wash the wounding device carefully and follow each of the four washing steps indicated by the manufacturer.\nDays 3, 4, and 5\nAnalysis of migration using the video microscope\nFor a minimum of 24 h and up to 5 days, monitor and check the cell migration.\nUse an appropriate cell mask adapted for each cell type to analyze cell migration. To obtain a cell mask adapted for each cell line, generate a cell processing definition from the software using a specific cell image collection.\nTrace the curves and export the data to a spreadsheet, which can be used to analyze and compare the results.\n3. Scratch Wound Assay: Cell Invasion\nNOTE: Instructions must be adapted for each type of cell.\nDay 1\nCell Seeding\nUse the same protocol for cell seeding as described in step 2.1.\nDay 2\nPreparing the ECM\nDefrost the matrix for at least 12 h before use at 4 °C. Make sure that no aggregates are visible. If aggregates are visible, keep the matrix at 4 °C for a longer period until the aggregates disappear. Keep the matrix on ice. Use precooled pipette tips.\n\t\tNOTE: The matrix will solidify if not kept at 4 °C.\nChill the microcentrifuge tubes on ice for 5 min.\nTake CM cooled to 4 °C from the refrigerator and dilute the matrix in the precooled microcentrifuge tubes to obtain a final concentration of 300 μg/mL.\nReturn the microcentrifuge tubes with prediluted matrix to the refrigerator at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: A cooling rack adapted for microcentrifuge tubes is helpful for maintaining the tubes at 4°C throughout the experiment.\nDay 2\nScratch Wound Assay and Treatment of the ECM\nRemove the plate prepared in step 3.1 from the incubator.\nUnder the hood, make the wound using the commercial wounding device according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nImmediately remove the medium from each well using a pipette with an adapted conical tip taking care not to touch the wound.\nWash the cells twice by repeating the aspiration procedure and using 100 μL of CM warmed to 37 °C.\nAfter the second wash, place the plate on the 4 °C incubator to equilibrate its temperature for 5 min.\nRemove the cold medium from each well with the aspiration pipette with a conical tip, taking care to pipette carefully from the edge and to avoid touching the wound.\nAdd 50 μL of prediluted matrix to each well using precooled conical tips at 4 °C.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: A prewarmed support rack at 37 °C is helpful to accelerate the warming of the 96-well plate.\nRemove the plate from the incubator and add 100 μL of the adapted CM to each well as indicated for each treatment condition.\nTry to avoid creating any bubbles in the wells. A reverse-pipetting technique may be helpful here. Alternatively, remove bubbles with a syringe needle.\nPlace the plate into the adapted rack in the video microscope.\nTo improve the image quality, allow the plate to warm for at least 15 min before the first scan to avoid condensation on the lower side of the plate.",
