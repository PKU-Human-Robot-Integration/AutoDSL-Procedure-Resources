Each individual step is described in detail below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2038-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow summary of the main steps in proteomic data acquisition\nGeneration of tryptic peptides utilizing S-Trap method\nTiming: 6–8 h\nThis section will provide detailed steps involving the preparation of lysates for tryptic digest and peptide generation. Starting with lysis of bone marrow derived macrophages, lysates are processed and proteins are quantified using the EZQ Method in preparation for the S-Trap Method peptide digest and elution of digest and lastly peptide quantification by CBQCA.\nNote: The S-Trap processing method requires a number of centrifugation steps. When deciding how many samples to process, we suggest considering the tube capacity of your microcentrifuge.\nPrior to starting the S-Trap method, prepare Proteomic Lysis buffer, S-Trap binding buffer, and Digestion buffer.\nDifferentiate macrophages from mouse bone marrow using established methods (Toda et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nOn day 7, seed macrophages at 1 million cells per well of a 6-well tissue culture plate.\nOn day 8, treat cells under desired experimental conditions.\nFollowing treatments, wash cells 3 times using 1 mL of sterile PBS per wash/per well, gently removing the PBS after each wash.\nCritical: Thorough washing is important to remove all serum from cells prior to lysis.\nAspirate PBS entirely and lyse cells in 400 μL of proteomic lysis buffer.\nNote: This volume of proteomic lysis buffer is optimal for the specific cell type and seeding density described. The volume of proteomic lysis buffer will require optimization for alternative cell types.\nScrape cells and transfer lysates to 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tubes.\nPlace Cap-Locks on tubes to prevent lids popping open during heating.\nIncubate lysates for 5 min on a ThermoMixer at 95°C with shaking at 500 rpm.",
    "Pause point: Cell lysates can be frozen at this point and stored at −80°C to perform quality control or validation experiments on separate lysates. If needed the cell culture media could be collected during step 4, prior to the PBS wash.\nIncubate lysates for 5 min on a shaker at 25°C with shaking at 1,000 rpm.\nPlace tubes in sonicator and sonicate at maximum amplitude for 15 cycles of 30 s on / 30 s off.\nNote: If using a different sonicator than the one described in this protocol, optimization of sonication cycles may be required.\nBriefly centrifuge tubes up to 4,000 g to collect liquid from the lid and sides.\nOptional: Add 1 μL of benzonase to each sample to degrade DNA and RNA, and incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nNote: Benzonase is an additional and optional step, added to further decrease DNA levels. Although SDS may deactivate Benzonase to a certain extent, we choose to include this step as an additional precaution to limit DNA in lysate, since DNA will bind and block the S-Trap column.\nDetermine protein yield using an EZQ protein quantitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer’s protocols:\nPrepare protein standards of ovalbumin, from the EZQ kit, make 2 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL, 0.02 mg/mL and 0.01 mg/mL, using proteomic lysis buffer as the blank.\nMount assay paper on EZQ™ 96-well microplate cassette.\nPrepare spots on assay paper mounted on plate (1 μL per well), with 3 replicates per standard and 3 replicates per sample.\nLeave to dry.\nTransfer the assay paper to a suitable container, add enough methanol to cover the assay paper and incubate for 5 min with shaking at 25°C.\nDiscard the methanol and leave to dry.",
    "Incubate with 20 mL EZQ stain (enough to cover assay paper) for 30 min with rocking, in the dark (covered in foil).\nDiscard the solution and add EZQ rinse buffer.\nIncubate for 1–2 min with shaking at 25°C.\nRepeat steps h and i two more times.\nDry assay paper.\nNote: Drying steps for washes with rinse buffer can be performed using a hairdryer under a fume hood.\nMount assay paper on the plate.\nAnalyze using CLARIOStar Plus microplate reader (or equivalent) for protein quantification using excitation/emission settings of ∼485/590 nm.\nDuring EZQ incubation step g, add 17 μL of freshly made 0.5 M IAA to each lysate sample after step 11 (optional), to give a final concentration of 20 mM IAA.\nIncubate samples in the dark at 25°C for 1 h.\nCritical: IAA is light sensitive, thus this step must be done in the dark.\nCheck the quantity of protein you have from your EZQ assay. If the amount falls in the range of 100–300 μg total protein then you can use the S-Trap mini columns.\nNote: If you have more than 300 μg protein, adjust your loading volume so that no more than 300 μg of protein is loaded. Using seeding densities as per step 2, BMDMs yield a surplus of protein, and adjusting the loading volumes to use S-Trap mini columns is sufficient.\nNote: If you have less than 100 μg protein, consider using S-Trap micro columns.\nNote: If you have many samples you can use the S-Trap 96 well plate.\nTo the lysate from step 15, add 12% aqueous phosphoric acid at 1:10 for a final concentration of 1.2% phosphoric acid (e.g., 40 μL phosphoric acid into 400 μL lysate) and mix briefly by vortexing.",
    "Note: The addition of phosphoric acid is important for the formation of a colloidal protein particulate, prior to loading on the S-Trap column.\nTransfer each acidified cell lysate to a new 5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tube.\nAdd S-Trap binding buffer at a ratio of 7:1 (v:v) to the acidified SDS lysate.\nExample: If you have 458 μL acidified SDS lysate, add 3,206 μL S-Trap binding buffer.\nMix samples by pipetting up and down.\nNote: Colloidal protein particulate is instantly formed in this step. Given sufficient protein, the solution may appear translucent.\nWith the S-Trap mini columns in a 2 mL receiver tube, add the acidified SDS lysate /S-Trap binding buffer mix to the spin column.\nNote: Do not add more solution than can fit in the lower, straight portion spin column (650 μL for S-Trap mini columns).\nCentrifuge the S-Trap mini spin column at 4,000 g for 30 s. Protein will be bound and trapped within the protein-trapping matrix of the spin column.\nNote: If the acidified SDS lysate/S-Trap binding buffer mix volume is higher than 650 μL, load the column and centrifuge multiple times until the full volume has been bound.\nWash captured protein by adding 400 μL S-Trap binding buffer; repeat centrifugation and discard the wash. Repeat this wash step a total of 5 times.\nMove S-Trap mini spin column to a clean 2 mL sample tube, taking care not to transfer any residual S-Trap binding buffer.\nReconstitute trypsin at 1 μg/μL in 50 mM acetic acid.\nExample: For a 100 μg aliquot of trypsin, add 100 μL of 50 mM acetic acid.\nFrom your EZQ calculations, calculate the quantity of trypsin required; for each sample a 1:20 (w/w) ratio of trypsin:sample total protein is used.",
    "Example: If 280 μg of protein is loaded onto the S-Trap column, 14 μg of 1 mg/mL trypsin will be required.\nPrepare a stock digest buffer containing trypsin (125 μL required per sample) and vortex briefly to mix.\nExample: As per the example above, if 280 μg of protein is loaded onto the S-trap mini column, prepare a trypsin solution containing 14 μL of 1 μg/μL trypsin and 111 μL of Digest Buffer for a total volume of 125 μL per sample.\nAdd 125 μL trypsin solution to the top of each spin column. Centrifuge at 4,000 g for 15 s and return any solution that passes through to the top of the column.\nNote: The S-Trap mini spin column is highly hydrophilic and will absorb the digestion buffer.\nEnsure the cap of the S-Trap mini spin column is closed to limit evaporative loss.\nNote: The column lid is designed to prevent pressure build up, which would otherwise force the digestion from the protein trap, while limiting evaporative loss.\nIncubate S-Trap mini spin columns on a ThermoMixer for 2 h at 47°C without shaking, with the heated lid.\nNote: This step can be replaced with ThermoMixer overnight 37°C without shaking, with the heated lid. We have not identified any difference in digest efficiency when comparing a 2 h digest with an overnight digest.\nCritical: Do not shake the columns once the trypsin is added. Shaking will greatly impede performance; some dripping may occur which does not affect performance.\nAfter 2 h add 80 μL of digestion buffer (without trypsin) to the S-Trap mini spin column and centrifuge at 1,000 g for 60 s. Keep the flow through in the collection tube.\nNote: This aqueous elution contains the majority of peptides.",
    "This process is repeated with the addition of 80 μL of 0.2% aqueous formic acid to each S-Trap mini spin column and centrifugation at 1,000 g for 60 s, collecting the flow through in the same collection tube as step 30.\nThis process is repeated this time with the addition 80 μL of 50% aqueous ACN containing 0.2% formic acid to each S-Trap mini spin column and centrifuge at 4,000 g for 60 s for the final elution, collecting the flow through in the same collection tube as steps 30 and 31.\nNote: This elution assists in recovery of hydrophobic peptides. Other organics may also be used as desired.\nPause point: You can store the eluted peptides at −80°C at this point or continue with the next step.\nVacuum dry the samples in an evaporator overnight (8–16 h) at 30°C using a program suitable for aqueous samples (“HPLC” program using the recommended evaporator).\nAfter peptides are dried, resuspend in 50 μL 1% formic acid. Pipette up and down to mix.\nNote: If you load less protein than the stated range of the S-Trap mini spin column, then consider resuspending in 40 μL of 1% formic acid.\nIncubate on a ThermoMixer at 30°C at 700 rpm for 1 h.\nNote: This step is necessary to fully resolubilize and resuspend peptides.\nCentrifuge at 20,800 g (or maximum speed possible in bench-top centrifuge) for 30 min.\nBeing careful not to disturb the precipitate, pipette liquid into a new 1.5 mL Protein LoBind tube, leaving the precipitate behind as waste.\nNote: It is important to leave precipitate behind, since any precipitate can clog the mass spec injector.\nPerform peptide quantification using the CBQCA quantification kit (Thermo Fisher) as per manufacturer’s protocols.",
    "Note: Peptide quantification is important since there will be loss of some peptides during S-Trap elution.\nAnalysis by mass spectrometry\nTiming: 4 h/sample\nIn this section, we include detailed settings required for DIA MS run.\nAnalyze 1.5 μg peptide per sample.\nInject the samples onto a nanoscale C18 reverse-phase chromatography system, then electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer. For liquid chromatography buffers are as follows: elution buffer A (0.1% formic acid in HiPerSolv Water (v/v)) and elution buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in HiPerSolv Water (v/v)).\nLoad at 10 μL/min onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).\nWash the trap column for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA then switched in-line with a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å).\nElute the peptides from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min with a linear gradient from 3% elution buffer B to 6% elution buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% elution buffer B to 35% elution buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% elution buffer B within 7 min.\nWash the column with 80% elution buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 35% elution buffer B for 5 min. Run two blanks between each sample to reduce carry-over. Keep the column at a constant temperature of 50°C.\nThe data acquisition settings are listed below:\nData acquisition\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2038_12.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2038_13.csv\nNote: If using a different MS instrument, the settings may require optimization.\nDIA data analysis using Spectronaut\nTiming: Hours to days depending on number of raw files to be analyzed",
    "Spectronaut is a software tool created by Biognosys, a spin-off company of Ruedi Aebersold, one of the principal contributors to the creation of data independent acquisition proteomics. It is currently one of the leading tools for the analysis of Data Independent Acquisition. Overall, it has been shown to provide a robust and reliable performance, coupled with a simpler graphical interface that makes it friendlier to use for non-expert users. This allows users to customize the settings, if they feel knowledgeable enough, or use a pre generated template, if not. It also allows users to customize the reports produced from the DIA data. This is a very valuable feature for non-expert users who want to obtain detailed reports with ease. In short, Spectronaut provides a robust performance and ease of use for non-expert users.\nSearch the raw data using Spectronaut 15 with the direct DIA option against the Mouse C57BL6J Uniprot database (UP000000589, 20210316). Do not use the default parameters. The search parameters are as follows:\nEnzyme: Trypsin.\nPeptide minimum length: 7 amino acids.\nMissed cleavages: 2.\nProtein Qvalue Cut-off (Run) should be set to 0.01.\nMajor Group Top N: unselected, the default value of 3 is incompatible with the “proteomic ruler” method.\nData MS1 and MS2 collected in profile mode.",
    "Critical: The top N parameter must not be enabled as it restricts the number of precursor ions and peptides used to calculate intensities. By default, Spectronaut uses the 3 most abundant ions and the 3 most abundant peptides only. As a result data are lost for proteins where more than 3 peptides are identified. The Proteomic Ruler method used to calculate estimated copy numbers requires all histone intensity to be used, therefore the Top N parameter is incompatible with this method. The ‘Major Group Quantity’ should be set to ‘Sum peptide quantity.’\nMinor Group Top N: unselected, the default for 3 is incompatible for reasons stated above.\nThe ‘Minor Group Quantity’ should be set to ‘Sum precursor quantity’.\n‘Protein LFQ Method’ must be changed to ‘QUANT 2.0 (SN Standard)’.\nCross Run Normalization should be unselected.\nCalibration mode: Automatic.\nFixed modifications: Carbamidomethylation of cysteine.\nVariable modifications: Oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and acetylation (protein N-terminus).\nFalse discovery rate (FDR) of precursor and protein: 1% Q-value.\nData filtering should be set to ‘Q-value’ to avoid values being imputed.\nFilter out decoy hits.\nThis is done when generating the report on Spectronaut. Within the report tick no decoy in Spectronaut to reverse hits.\nFilter out potential contaminants (keratin, trypsin) once the search is complete:\nDownload database of contaminants from MaxQuant (http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:start_downloads.htm[href=http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:start_downloads.htm]).\nUse the Gene ID to manually remove proteins where the gene name is included in the contaminants list from your dataset.\nNote: Version 15.4.210913.50606 of Spectronaut was used for this paper; however, the default search parameters must be substantially modified to ensure compatibility with the proteomic ruler method.\nNote: UniProt Mouse C57BL6J proteome database FASTA file (UP000000589) is available for download at http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/[href=http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/].",
    "Note: Other software can be used instead of Spectronaut such as Skyline and DIA-NN both of which are free.

This method is available as a plugin within the Perseus software package (Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). It uses the relationship between DNA mass and histone mass and correlates it to histone intensity detected in the proteomic experiment to estimate the copy numbers for all proteins detected in the sample. The proteomic ruler plugin can automatically estimate protein copy numbers as well as protein concentration. Requirements of the proteomic ruler include a deep proteome from a eukaryotic nucleated cell with a known ploidy. Accuracy of the histone ruler also requires complete cell lysis with no cellular fractions lost (chromatin required), and at least 12,000 peptides should be identified.\nDownload and install Perseus software.\nNote: Perseus software can be freely download at https://maxquant.net/perseus/[href=https://maxquant.net/perseus/].\nNote: Perseus version 1.6.15.0 was used.\nDownload and install the Proteomic Ruler plugin compatible with your version of Perseus.\nNote: The Proteomic Ruler plugin compatible with your version can be freely downloaded at http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:plugins:store[href=http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:plugins:store] with guidance at http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:plugins:proteomicruler[href=http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:plugins:proteomicruler].\nPrior to loading the Spectronaut output file (∗.tsv file generated by Spectronaut), adjust the ‘PG.MolecularWeight’ column to ensure that each protein is annotated with a single molecular weight.\nOpen the ∗.tsv file generated by Spectronaut in Microsoft Excel.\nCopy the ‘PG.MolecularWeight’ column onto a new sheet.\nSelect Data>Text to Columns.\nUnder ‘Original data type’ select ‘Delimited’.\nUnder ‘Delimiters’ select ‘Semicolon’.\nUnder ‘Column data format’ select ‘General’.",
