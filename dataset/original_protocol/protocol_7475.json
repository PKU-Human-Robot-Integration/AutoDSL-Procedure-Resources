    "Secretion assays in liquid media using 96-well plates Prepare the cells Inoculate three independent single colonies for each bacterial strain to be tested into 1 mL of LB media (see Recipes) supplemented with any required supplements. Make sure to include a strain that does not express β-lactamase fusion as a negative control.Grow the cells, under aeration, at 37 °C overnight.Dilute the cells 200-fold by pipetting 5 μL of the overnight cell culture into 995 μL of buffered saline (see Recipes).Prepare the ampicillin solutions Prepare a stock of 100 mg/mL ampicillin (Ap stock; see Recipes). Make 500 μL aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C until use. Prepare fresh every three months.Transfer 50 mL of LB media into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Discard 400 μL of media using a pipette before adding 400 μL of the Ap stock in order to prepare the 800 μg/mL first solution. Mix well by vortexing. Label this tube number 1.Label 10 additional 50 mL tubes 2–11. Add 25 mL of LB media to each of them.Make the serial dilution by transferring 25 mL of Ap 800 μL/mL of conical centrifuge Tube 1 to conical centrifuge tube 2. Close and mix well, then perform the new transfer from tube 2 to 3, etc., until tube 10. Tube 11 contains only LB media as a control.At the end, we get the following serial dilutions:table:\n﻿0,1\n1,800 μg/mL\n2,400 μg/mL\n3,200 μg/mL\n4,100 μg/mL\n5,50 μg/mL\n6,25 μg/mL\n7,12.5 μg/mL\n8,6.25 μg/mL\n9,3.125 μg/mL\n10,1.565 μg/mL\n11,0 μg/mL",
    "Notes:  This is just an example of a typical range used for one of our Bla fusion expression strains. A different range or more specific dilutions of ampicillin solutions can also be prepared, if necessary, in order to obtain a different range of concentrations. Smaller volumes can be used to prepare the solutions; however, using larger volumes gives better reproducibility. Load the ampicillin solutions and cells on the 96-well plate Calculate the number of plates needed, depending on the number of samples. Make sure to include control samples, such as buffered saline–only, to ensure all solutions are sterile. Place the plates such that they are facing 12 by 8, as illustrated in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4696/bioprotoc-13-12-4696-g001.jpgFigure 1. Suggested layout to load ampicillin solutions and samples in the plates Number each plate and write sample numbers on the plates.Using a 2,000 μL electronic pipette repeater, transfer 198 μL of each of the ampicillin solutions across the plates. Load solution 11 (no ampicillin) first, then solution 10 (1.565 μg/mL), etc., until the higher concentration solution.Once all plates are loaded with the Ap solutions, use a 20 μL electronic pipette repeater to load 2 μL of the 200-fold diluted cells to each well, starting from the least concentrated Ap solution down until the most concentrated solution.Place each plate on top of each other with their cap and tape them together and to the shaker plate in the incubator.Incubate at 37 °C and 180 rpm for 18 h.Notes:  Ampicillin is sensitive to light; keep the antibiotic in the dark throughout all steps. Use aluminum foil if necessary to protect the plates from the light. While we routinely use ampicillin in our studies, carbenicillin might be a better option because of its increased stability."
