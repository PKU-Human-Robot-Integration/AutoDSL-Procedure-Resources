    "1. Clearing Blood from Vasculature\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine with 10 mg/kg xylazine diluted in 0.25 ml saline.\nOnce anesthesia has been confirmed by no response to a paw pinch, use scissors to make an incision across the chest with scissors just below the xyphoid process, cut through diaphragm, and cut up between dorsal and ventral segment of ribcage to expose thoracic cavity. Expose heart by folding up sternum and adjacent chest wall and secure with hemostat. Open the pericardial sac with tweezers to expose the heart.\nTurn on perfusion pump (100mmHg pressure) connected to warm PBS plus heparin (5 unit/ml) solution in hot water bath at 37°C and tubing with a blunt 22 gauge needle on the outflow.\nInsert the needle into the left ventricle, near the apex of the heart. Immediately cut open the right atrium to enable systemic blood outflow and continue flushing until blood is removed from circulation.\n2. Perfusion of Casting Agent into the Vascular System\nPrepare Microfil (Flow Tech, Inc. Carver, MA) casting solution per manufacturer's protocol: Mix 5 ml of MV diluent with 4 ml of filtered MV compound. Add 450μl (5%) of catalyst (MV curing agent). Solution working time is 20 minutes, but mix immediately before use to ensure proper viscosity.\nWithdraw casting agent solution into a 10ml syringe, attach a blunt 20 gauge needle to the syringe and fill needle with solution.\nInsert needle into the left ventricle through the same hole used for flushing the blood. Secure needle into place with hemostat clamp on the heart.\nInject casting agent solution slowly into the left ventricle at approximately 3 ml/min. Excess pressure may lead to incorrect flow of casting agent or potential vessel rupture.",
    "Look for signs of successful perfusion, including: visualization of casting agent in intestine and liver vasculature, distal limb discoloration, and nose and tongue discoloration. Readjust needle if necessary to achieve proper perfusion.\n3. Collection and Processing of Tissue\nRemove brain and place in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C.\nDehydrate brain by placing from paraformaldehyde directly into increasingly concentrated EtOH at room temperature: 25% EtOH, 1 day; 50% EtOH, 1 day; 75% EtOH, 1 day; 95% EtOH, 2 days; and 100% EtOH, 2 days.\nClarify brain tissue around blood vessels by immersing the perfused brain in methyl salicylate for 2 days at room temperature.\nVasculature of the whole unsectioned clarified brain can be imaged with brain immersed in methyl salicylate under a dissecting microscope (Fig. 1) (Leica MZFL III microscope, Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) or brightfield microscope (Fig. 2) (Leica DM/LS, Leica Microsystems).\nReclarification can be done if tissue is not completely cleared. From methyl salicylate, transfer brain to 95% EtOH for 2 days, 100% EtOH for 2 days, and methyl salicylate for 2 days.\n4. Micro-CT Imaging or Histological Application- Tissue Preparation\nThe brain can be imaged using micro-CT directly after clarification or after re-hydration (Fig. 4).\nTo prepare brain tissue for histological analysis, rehydrate the brain through serial diluted EtOH: 100% EtOH, 1 day; 95% EtOH, 1 day; 75% EtOH, 1 day; 50% EtOH, 2 days; 25% EtOH, 2 days; and store in PBS. The brain can then be embedded in paraffin using a standard procedure.\n5. Representative Results",
    "Following vascular casting, the cerebrovasculature can be seen macroscopically on the brain surface (Fig.1A). The vascular tree inside the parenchyma can be visualized following clarification (Fig. 1B). The detailed vascular structure can be imaged and analyzed under a brightfield microscope (Fig. 2), dissecting scope (Fig. 3), and with micro-CT scanning (Fig. 4). Using brightfield microscopy, the vasculature can be viewed at different focal planes without sectioning the brain (Fig. 2A) as well as individual microvessels at higher magnification (Fig. 2B). Under a dissecting scope, one can see the entire vascular structure in one focal plane, allowing better visualization of the three dimensional structure of the cerebrovasculature (Fig. 3). Images taken under a dissecting microscope can show large vessel morphology and whole brain vasculature, but lack the details shown in pictures taken with brightfield microscopy (Fig. 2B). This technique has allowed us to detect irregular vessels in our experimental BAVM adult mouse model2. Figure 5 shows an example of the same irregular vessels detected by micro-CT scanning (Fig. 5A) and brightfield microscope (Fig. 5B). Together, this data shows that we can analyze the same sample with multiple imaging tools after vascular casting.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2958/2958fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
