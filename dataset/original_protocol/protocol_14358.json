    "In order to avoid alloimmune responses, and to strictly investigate ischemia reperfusion injury-related graft damage, a syngeneic donor-recipient pair should be used. In this protocol, male C57BL6 (H2b) 10-12-week-old mice weighing 26 to 28 g were used as size-matched donor-recipient pairs. All animals were housed in a barrier pathogen free facility and received human care in compliance with the \"Principals of Laboratory Animal Care\" formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 86-23, revised 1985). The Austrian Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture approved the experiments described in this manuscript (BMWF-66.011/0056-II/3b/2011).\n1. Pancreas Procurement\nAnesthetize the donor animal with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) using a 27-gauge (G) needle.\nShave the hair in the abdominal region using an electrical shaver, and fix the mouse on the operative field in a supine position with strands of tape.\nScrub the operative field three times with chlorhexidine-soaked gauzes.\nPerform a midline abdominal incision with a bilateral subcostal extension using scissors. Gently exteriorize the viscera to the left with sterile cotton sticks, and wrap them in a moistened gauze. Lift the xyphoid cranially with a mosquito clamp to provide maximal exposure of the abdominal cavity for the following steps.\nUsing a 19 G needle, inject 400 µL of a sterile 1:4 heparin-sodium chloride solution for heparinisation into the inferior vena cava (IVC). After removing the needle, euthanize the animal by exsanguination transecting of the aorta.",
    "Dissect the abdominal aorta between the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and the right renal artery by gently separating the fibrous tissue using curved tip forceps. Undermine the aorta and tie it with an 8/0 silk ligature.\nIdentify the hepatoduodenal ligament, which runs between the postpyloric duodenum and the liver hilum. Divide the bile duct below the entrance of the cystic duct after distal ligature, and gently dissect and transect the portal vein as distally as possible to have enough length for performing the anastomosis in the recipient.\nUsing curved tip forceps, bluntly dissect the abdominal aorta starting from the previous ligature (see step 1.6). Undermine the periaortic tissue using curved tip forceps, tie it with an 8/0 silk ligature, and transect it with scissors.\n\t\nUsing bipolar forceps, coagulate all its lumbar branches and transect the aorta with scissors as closely as possible to the diaphragm, in order to provide enough length for vessel anastomosis. At last, transect the already tied aorta above the left renal artery.\nPerfuse the pancreas with a 19 G syringe with 5 mL of 4 °C histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate perfusion solution in an antegrade fashion via the abdominal aorta, until there is a clear effluent coming from the portal vein. Apply low pressure to avoid oedema formation.\n\tNOTE: Perform Steps 1.5 to 1.9 in a fast and standardized fashion to avoid any bias by warm ischemic deterioration of the recovered graft.\nReplace the viscera into the peritoneal cavity using sterile cotton sticks.\nUsing curved tip forceps, separate the pancreas stepwise starting from the postpyloric duodenum, and moving forward until reaching the ligament of Treitz. For these steps, identify avascular connective tissue areas between the pancreas and the duodenal wall.",
    "Bluntly dissect these areas using curved tip forceps in order to isolate bridging vessels between the pancreas and the duodenum. Pass an 8/0 silk ligature around each isolated vascular structure and tie it.\nFinally, transect the vascular structure with scissors towards the duodenal wall. In the same fashion, use an 8/0 silk suture to separate the pancreas from the mesentery, the transverse colon, and the stomach.\n\t\tNOTE: During this procedure, the choledocho-pancreatic duct is ligated.\nIdentify the gastrosplenic ligament running from the spleen to the stomach, and the short gastric branches, by lifting the stomach cranially and cutting it with scissors. Leave the spleen attached to the recovered graft.\n\tNOTE: In order to minimize graft rewarming, irrigate the pancreas continuously using a 10 mL syringe with a 19 G needle with the cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate perfusion solution stored on ice.\nFinally, remove the pancreas from the donor site (Figure 1B) by grasping the spleen with forceps, and transfer it into the recipient.\n\t\nAlternatively, to trigger severe ischemia reperfusion injury, store the graft in sterile, 4 °C perfusion solution for 16 h before implanting it into the recipient animal.\n2. Recipient Preparation\nAnesthetize the recipient animal with an i.p. injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) using a 27 G needle.\nShave the right lateral cervical region using an electrical shaver, and place the mouse on the operative field in a supine position. Fix the mouse using strands of tape. Avoid overstretching the front limbs to avoid compromising respiration.\nScrub the operative field three times using chlorhexidine-soaked gauzes.\nMake a right paramedian, slightly oblique skin incision from the jugular incision to the right mandible angle.",
    "Bluntly identify and mobilize the lateral branches of the right external jugular vein. Coagulate them with bipolar forceps and transect them with scissors.\nLift the right lobe of the submandibular salivary gland cranially, identify the vascular pedicle, and cauterize it using bipolar forceps. Remove the lobe by transecting the cauterized pedicle with scissors.\nIn analogy to step 2.5, identify all medial branches of the external jugular vein, cauterize them with bipolar forceps and transect them with scissors. Undermine the external jugular vein with curved tip forceps as cranially as possible, and ligate it with two 8/0 silk ligatures, leaving enough space between the ligatures.\nTransect the external jugular vein between the two previously placed ligatures with straight scissors.\nPass the proximal end of the external jugular vein through the polyethylene cuff (inner diameter of 0.75 mm, outer diameter of 0.94 mm), and fix the handle of the cuff with a venous microhemostat clamp.\nRemove the tie at the end of the vessel stump and evert the vessel over the cuff. Fix the everted vein on the cuff with a circular 8/0 - silk ligature (Figure 1A).\nProximally and distally cauterize the superficial part of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, transect it with scissors, and remove it.\nGently mobilize the common carotid artery, undermine it below the bifurcation, and ligate it twice, making sure not to tie the carotid bifurcation. Cut the vessel between the ties.\nSimilar to step 2.9, pass the proximal end of the common carotid artery through the polyamide cuff (inner diameter of 0.57 mm, outside diameter of 0.6 mm), and fix it with an arterial microvascular clamp.",
    "Remove the ligature at the end of the vascular stump, and gently widen the lumen using vessel dilatators. Evert the vessel over the arterial cuff, and fix it with an 8/0 silk ligature (Figure 1A).\n3. Implantation\nPlace the graft into the recipient's neck region using the spleen as a handle, with the head oriented laterally, the tail including the spleen medially, and the vessel stumps ventro-caudally. Use cotton sticks to position the graft properly.\nGently pull the portal vein of the pancreatic graft over the recipient animal's external jugular vein, which has been previously everted, and fixed on the appropriate cuff (see step 2.10). Fix it with a circular 8/0 silk ligature.\nPull the stump of the abdominal aorta of the graft over the everted common carotid artery of the recipient animal. Fix it with a circumferential 8/0 silk ligature (Figure 1C).\nIdentify the splenic vessels close to the hilum of the spleen, and undermine them with curved tip forceps. Tie them with 8/0 silk ligatures and transect the splenic vessels to remove the spleen. Finally, shorten the ties.\nUsing a clamp applying forceps, remove the clamp on the venous cuff first. Then remove the arterial clamp.\n\tNOTE: If transplantation was successful, the pancreatic graft will be reperfused immediately showing a homogeneous pinkish color and visible arterial pulsation (Figure 1D).\nMoisten the graft with normothermic saline solution.\nRemove the handle of the venous cuff using straight forceps.\nClose the surgical wound with a running 6/0 suture.\n4. Postoperative Care (Endpoint)\nFollowing the procedure, apply up to 0.5 mL of normal saline subcutaneously (s.c.) for replacement of intraoperative fluid loss using a 19 G needle.\nKeep the recipient animal on a heating pad until complete recovery from anaesthesia.",
    "Once awake, return the recipient animal to the housing facility, where it can have food and water ad libitum.\nTo prevent postoperative pain, administer right after the operation (1) Buprenorphin (0.1 mg/kg b.w.) every 12 h for the first 5 days and (2) carprofen 4 mg/kg b.w. every 12 h s.c. for the first week.\nIn order to estimate proper nutritional intake, monitor weight (g) of each recipient animal every day. A weight loss of more than 10-15% compared to weight at surgery day, apathy, crippling, a very bent back, as well as surgical side infections represent endpoints.\n\t\nIn this case, as well as after reaching clinical endpoint, sacrifice the animal using terminal isoflurane inhalation."
