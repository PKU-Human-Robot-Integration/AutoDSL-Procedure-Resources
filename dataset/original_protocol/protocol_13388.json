    "This protocol has been approved by the local French ethical committee for animal experimentation (Comité d'éthique en expérimentation animale; reference CEEA-PdL n 06).\n1. Pre-operative preparation\nAdd gel diet food to the normal diet 3 days before the surgery. Fast the mice 6 h before the surgery.\nInduce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane (1 L/min) in a dedicated chamber with oxygen (1 L/min). Inject the mice subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg), amoxicillin (15 mg/kg), metoclopramide (1 mg/kg), meloxicam (1 mg/kg) and iron (0.5 mg/kg).\nShave the first 2/3 parts of the mouse's abdomen beginning from the xiphoid process using an electric razor. Disinfect the mouse's abdomen in two steps using an iodine polyvidone solution .\nPlace the mouse supine on a dedicated heat pad covered with a clean underpad. Maintain anesthesia using a nose cone with 2%-2.5% isoflurane (0.4 L/min) with oxygen (0.4 L/min). Use a toe-pinch test to confirm the depth of anesthetization.\nCover the mouse in a sterilized plastic wrap. In order to apply hyperextension on the mouse's abdomen, fix the lower paw and use a 1 mL syringe or equivalent placed behind the mouse's back. Cut an opening in a sterile compress with the size of the future incision, and use it as an operating field to cover the mouse. The general installation is shown in Figure 2A.\nBefore the surgery, use a face mask, a scrub cap, and sterilized gloves. Use sterilized instruments for the surgery.\n2. The SADI-S protocol\nMedian laparotomy\n\t\nUnder a binocular microscope (8x magnification), perform a median laparotomy with scissors or a scalpel by opening the abdominal skin from the xiphoid process to the middle of the abdomen. Ensure that the xiphoid process and the musculoaponeurotic layer are visible (Figure 2B).",
    "NOTE: Administer bupivacaine (3 mg/kg) subcutaneously at the surgical site 5 mins before making the skin incision.\nOpen the abdominal wall along the linea alba with scissors between the abdominal muscles. Be careful not to enter the thoracic cavity (Figure 2C).\nDuodenal exclusion\n\t\nGently mobilize the duodenum from the abdominal cavity using a moistened cotton swab to see its anterior and posterior sides. Localize the main bile duct, which is immediately visible under the binocular microscope on the posterior side of the lesser omentum and the duodenum (Figure 3A, black arrows).\nProximally from the main bile duct, visualize an area between the duodenal arteries under the binocular microscope (Figure 3A,B, blue dotted circles). Penetrate this area using curved micro forceps from one side of the duodenum to the other, and perform a duodenal ligation between the arteries using a 6-0 non-absorbable suture (Figure 3C-E). Be careful not to ligate the branches of the duodenal arteries.\nSleeve gastrectomy\n\t\nMobilize the stomach from the abdominal cavity using a moistened cotton swab and a non-traumatic clamp. Separate the stomach from the surrounding organs using micro scissors: separate the greater omentum, cut the short gastric arteries (branch of the splenic artery) between the stomach and the spleen, and the lipoma linking the stomach to the lower part of the esophagus (Figure 4A,B).\nUsing micro scissors, perform a 5 mm gastrotomy by opening the fundus and remove the residual food using a cotton swab (Figure 4C, arrow). Rinse the gastrotomy site with sterile saline solution (37 °C) to avoid contamination from the removed gastric contents. \nApply surgical clips (medium size, 5.6 mm) along the stomach's greater curvature to exclude approximately 80% of the stomach. Two clips are sufficient. Remove the excluded stomach by cutting it with micro scissors (Figure 4D-G).",
    "Anchor the surgical clips to ascertain impermeability by performing a running suture (8-0) from the beginning to the end of the stomach resection (Figure 4H).\nDuodeno-ileal anastomosis\n\t\nUnder the binocular microscope, visualize the last ileal loop, which is situated just before the caecum (Figure 5A). Gently mobilize the small intestine outside the abdominal cavity from the last ileal loop. Lay out the small bowel, as displayed in Figure 5B, so that the last ileal loop is located on the left side. Using a previously sized suture cord, measure 10 cm (approximately 1/3 of the total length of the small bowel) from the last ileal loop; this will be the site of the future anastomosis.\nIn order to ensure that the future biliary limb comes to the anastomosis site from its left side, make a large loop of the small intestine around the site of the future anastomosis. Using micro scissors, perform a 4 mm enterotomy by opening the small bowel at this point (Figure 5C-E). Rinse the enterotomy site with sterile saline solution (37 °C) to avoid contamination.\nPerform a 4 mm enterotomy on the excluded part of the duodenum, immediately after the pylorus, between the stomach and the ligation performed in step 2.2.2 (Figure 5F). Place an absorbable 5 mm x 5 mm hemostatic collagen compress to favor homeostasis.\nUsing a non-absorbable 8-0 suture, perform a side-to-side duodeno-ileal anastomosis. Begin with the posterior side anastomosis, followed by the anterior side anastomosis (Figure 5G-I).\nAbdominal closure\n\t\nDisplay the small bowel in the abdominal cavity so that the biliary limb comes to the anastomosis from the superior-left side of the abdomen and the common limb falls to the lower part of the abdomen.",
    "NOTE: Lavage the abdomen three times with approximately 5 mL of sterile 0.9% saline solution (37 °C). Then, suction the fluid from the abdomen to remove residual gastrointestinal fluid and digested food to avoid bacterial infection and subsequent abdominal inflammation. \nRehydrate the mouse with 500 µL of 37 °C saline solution by applying it directly into the abdominal cavity using a 1 mL syringe.\nClose the musculoaponeurotic layer using a single 6-0 non-absorbable running suture. Close the abdominal skin using 6-0 non-absorbable separated sutures (Figure 5J,K).\n3. General postoperative care\nAfter stopping the isoflurane, let the mouse wake on the heat pad under 0.4 L/min O2 insufflated with the nose mask. When fully awakened, which can be ensured by complete motor recuperation, place the mouse alone in a cage in a 30 °C incubator. Leave the mouse in the 30 °C incubator for 5 days (no specific condition for gas or humidity).\n\tNOTE: The cage should be warmed beforehand.\nAllow free access to water immediately after surgery. Add vitamin supplements, including vitamins B1, B9, B12, and liposoluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), to water (800 mg/180 mL of water) until the end of the protocol.\nMaintain analgesia by subcutaneous buprenorphine injections (0.1 mg/kg) twice a day from day 1 to day 3, once a day afterward until day 5. Continue amoxicillin (15 mg/kg), meloxicam (1 mg/kg) and metoclopramide (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous injections once a day until day 3. Provide subcutaneous injections of iron (0.5 mg/kg) once a day until the end of the protocol.\n4. General measurements and euthanasia\nWeigh the mice every day until postoperative day 5. Then weigh on day 7, and then weekly.",
    "To measure daily food intake, place one mouse per cage. Place a known weight of a solid diet and measure the weight of the solid diet remaining after 24 h. Measure food intake on day 3, 4, 5, 7, and then weekly.\nEuthanize the mice by cervical dislocation under general anesthesia (5% isoflurane (1 L/min) with oxygen (1 L/min)) with subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) after cardiac left atrium incision for blood sampling (500 to 600 µL of blood).\nMeasure the blood hemoglobin concentration using an automatic hematology analyzer requiring 20 μL of blood.\nSubscription Required.
