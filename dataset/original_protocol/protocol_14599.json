    "Ethics statement: Studies involving animals were conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Yale University.\n1. Behavioral Testing of Genetically Modified Mice\nNote: All mice should be subjected to the same testing regimen to limit differences in habituation to handling. Tests should be performed at the same time of day each time.\nNeonatal Hind Limb Test\n\tNote: The hind limb test is conducted daily from postnatal day (P) 4 to P10 to evaluate proximal hind limb muscle strength, weakness and fatigue.\n\t\nTransport mice to testing area and allow to rest for 30 min before testing.\nPrepare testing apparatus by cleaning a 50 ml conical tube with 70% ethanol, pushing two (P4-P8) or one (P9-P10) cotton balls to the bottom of the tube and securing in a vertical position.\nRemove one pup from the cage and record weight. Keep pup in holding tray on heat pad whenever not testing.\nGently suspend the hind limbs of the neonate over the rim of the conical tube, such that it is facing down towards the cotton balls. Count the number of pull attempts made and measure latency to fall using a stopwatch.\nRepeat once more then label the pup with marker. Afterwards, identify P6 pups by toe clipping.  Rub pups gently with bedding from home cage before replacing.\nWipe conical tube with 70% ethanol.\nRepeat testing on next pup until the whole litter has been tested.\nDispose of cotton ball and conical tube. Clean all equipment with 70% ethanol.\nWeanling Observation Test\n\tNote: The weanling observation test is administered daily from P19 to P21 to score movement and general activity levels.",
    "Transport mice to testing area and allow to rest for 30 min before testing.\nPrepare Plexiglas testing box marked with a 6x6 grid of 2 inch squares on the base by cleaning with 70% ethanol. Set up video equipment to the side such that the whole box is in the viewing field. Keep the set up and surroundings the same each day to avoid introducing novelty.\nRemove one weanling from the cage and place in a clean holding cup. Record weight.\nBegin video recording by filming the test identification card, with mouse identification number, age and date of testing. Transfer mouse from holding cup to the center square. Time for three minutes, counting the number of lines traversed by both front paws of the mouse during the test.\nReturn mouse to a clean cage and end video recording.\nClean the testing apparatus with 70% ethanol.\nRepeat until all litter is tested, then return all pups to the home cage.\nClean all testing equipment with 70% ethanol.\nUsing the videos, quantitate the number of rearing events by tallying after visual observation, where a mouse stands with both front paws clear of support, and grooming events, where both front paws are engaged in cleaning.\nWire Mesh Grip Strength Test\n\tNote: The grip strength test is conducted on alternate days between P22 and P26, to assess neuromuscular strength.\n\t\nTransport mice to testing area and allow to rest in home cage for 30 min before testing.\nPrepare apparatus by cleaning a Plexiglass box and mesh grid with 70% ethanol. Place bubble wrap in the bottom of the box and cover with paper.\nSeparate mice into groups of three, placing in individual holding cups.",
    "Place first mouse onto the center of the wire mesh and slowly invert 10-20 cm above the soft surface in the bottom of the Plexiglass box. Measure the latency to fall using a stopwatch. Terminate testing after 60 sec have elapsed if the mouse does not fall.\nReturn mouse to holding cup, wipe mesh with 70% ethanol and replace paper over the bubble wrap. Conduct the test on the remaining two mice in the group before returning to the first. Repeat until each mouse has been tested a total of three times.\nReturn the group to a clean cage and continue with remaining groups. If there are fewer than three mice in any group, ensure that a 5 min inter-trial recovery interval is allowed.\nReturn all mice to the home cage, dispose of paper and clean testing equipment with 70% ethanol.\n2. Examination of Retinal Structure\nAnaesthetize animals at P30-35 by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Assess depth of anesthesia by pinching the footpad and proceed only in the absence of a response, in line with IACUC guidelines. Perfuse with 4% PFA/PBS48.\nTo remove the eyes, clean the skin at the incision site with 70% ethanol, before cutting through the skin at the base of the skull. Peel back the skin to expose the skull and clean with 70% ethanol. Using clean instruments, carefully cut through the skull to reach the eye sockets and expose the eyes. Sever the optic nerve, gently remove the eye from the socket and rinse in PBS.\nFix eyes in 4% PFA/PBS for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Place eyes in a small petri dish containing PBS. Make a small incision in the center of the cornea using stitch removal scissors. Remove the cornea by cutting the edge between the cornea and sclera. Use forceps to remove the iris. Finally, peel off the RPE layers, leaving the retina intact and the lens in place.\n\tNote: The 4% PFA/PBS fixation will cause RPE detachment allowing for the RPE to be easily peeled from the outside of the retina.\nRe-fix in 4% PFA/30% sucrose/PBS for 15 min at room temperature before returning the eye to a petri dish containing PBS. Pull out the lens using forceps, bringing the vitreous body along with it.\nCryoprotect in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C.\nCoat eyes in Optimum Cutting Temperature compound (OCT) and transfer to an embedding mold containing fresh OCT. Orient the eye such that the sagittal plane is parallel with the cutting face, using as few movements as possible and avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. Flash freeze by immersing the mold in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Store blocks at -80 °C.\nUsing a cryostat, cut 20 µm sagittal sections and collect on precleaned slides.\nStain sections with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard protocols49. Image using a light microscope equipped for bright field microscopy.\n3. Histochemical Staining\nSample Preparation\n\t\nEuthanize animals at P30-35 using isoflurane overdose (30% in propylene glycol) via open drop inhalation. Assess euthanasia by the cessation of breathing, heartbeat and lack of response to pinching the footpad. Confirm death by cervical dislocation and organ removal, in line with IACUC guidelines.",
    "To remove the brain, clean the skin at the incision site with 70% ethanol, before cutting through the skin at the base of the skull. Peel back the skin to expose the skull and clean with 70% ethanol. Using clean instruments, carefully cut through the skull and remove to expose the brain. Remove the membranes, and gently remove the brain from the skull cavity. Rinse in PBS.\nCoat the brain in OCT and transfer to an embedding mold containing fresh OCT. Orient the brain such that the sagittal plane is parallel with the cutting face, using as few movements as possible and avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. Flash freeze by immersing the mold in a dry ice/ethanol bath and store at -80 °C.\nUsing a cryostat, cut 10 µm sagittal sections and collect on precleaned slides.\nNADH Diaphorase Staining\n\t\nPrepare 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.6 by dissolving 5.72 g Tris-HCl and 1.66 g Tris base in 1L-deionized water. Store at 4 °C for up to six weeks.\nPrepare NADH solution (2.25 mM NADH in 0.05 M Tris buffer). Aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare NBT solution (2.5 mM Nitro-Blue Tetrazolium in 0.05 M Tris buffer). Store at 4 °C for up to six weeks in a glass bottle.\nCombine equal volumes of NADH solution and NBT solution to make staining solution and add 1 ml to each slide. Incubate at 37 °C in a humidified chamber for 30 min.\nAspirate staining solution and wash three times with dH2O.\nWash three times each in ascending and descending concentrations of acetone/dH20 (30%, 60%, 90%, 60%, 30%) for 2 min at room temperature.\nRinse three times in dH2O and mount sections with aqueous medium. Image using a light microscope equipped for bright field microscopy. Blue staining corresponds to enzymatic activity.",
