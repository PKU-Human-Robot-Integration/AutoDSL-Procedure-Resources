    "Cultivation experiments with anaerobic organismsPlease note that the use of gases is described according to the specifications of our piping system. In particular, the manual addition of CO2 required a sterile syringe (male Luer-lock), a Luer-to-tubing connector (female Luer Lock), and, specifically for the 13CO2 gas, a lecture-bottle control valve to connect to the carbon steel lecture bottle (see Materials and Reagents A).Growth with different CO2 concentrationsHere we describe the cultivation of anaerobic microorganisms in serum bottles (117 mL total volume; 20 mL, 5 mL, and 2 mL medium).Solve the ingredients (see Recipe 1 for cultivation of Desulfurellaceae spp). Please remember that the reported list of ingredients may differ from the one suited for the cultivation of other autotrophs.Make the solution anoxic by performing vacuum-gas (usually 1 min each) cycles with 100% N2 (50–100 kPa overpressure) for approximately 40 min (see Note 5).Reduce the solution by the addition of Na2S9H2O at a final concentration of 0.05% (w/v).Adjust the pH of the medium to the growth optimum of the organism in question. Indeed, since the addition of sodium sulfide makes the medium pH alkaline (pH of ~8 in our case), it is necessary to adjust it by addition of an anoxic HCl solution (see Note 5). Other acids could be used, if compatible with the growth medium. Please consider that different medium compositions might influence the resulting pH and differ from our experience.Get rid of the overpressure in the medium bottle, then transfer it to the anaerobic chamber (see Note 3 for an alternative way of aliquoting without using the anaerobic chamber).Aliquot the medium (20 mL, 5 mL, and 2 mL) with the help of a bottle-dispenser. When cultivating sulfur reducers, distribute the elemental sulfur powder (10 g L-1) in advance into the serum bottles.",
    "Close the serum bottles with butyl-rubber stoppers, then transfer them out of the anaerobic chamber, and seal them with crimp aluminum caps.Autoclave sulfur-containing media at 110°C for 40 min. The autoclaved media can be stored at RT long-term. Please remember that the medium for the cultivation of other autotrophic microbes may require different sterilization temperatures.Prior to inoculation, add the sterile filtered vitamins (see Recipe 3) to the cultures and replace the gas phase. Due to the heat sensitivity, vitamins are usually not added to the medium before sterilization. Transfer 40 mL of vitamin solution to a serum bottle, make it anoxic (see Note 5), then add the vitamins to the culture medium anaerobically using sterile disposable syringes and needles, to a final concentration of 10 mL L-1 .Replace the gas phase of fresh cultures by performing vacuum-gas cycles with 100% H2. Before adding the CO2, release any overpressure present in the cultures.Add CO2 manually with a syringe at the respective final partial pressures: 80 kPa or 40 kPa for 20 mL cultures, 10 kPa for 5 ml cultures, 4 kPa for 5 mL cultures, and 2 kPa for 2 mL cultures.Fill up with H2 to 100 kPa overpressure.If necessary, adjust the pH to the organism optimum with anoxic 1 M NaOH (see Note 5). This is important because the addition of CO2 acidifies the medium (CO2 + H2O ⇋ H2CO3 ⇋  + H+).For the inoculation, use actively growing cultures during late exponential phase, to minimize the lag phase. In our case, the starting cell density was 106 [cells/mL]. Incubate the main cultures (Figure 1A) at the optimum growth temperature with agitation.Carbon-13 labelling experimentsHere, we describe the cultivation of anaerobic microorganisms in the presence of carbon-13 compounds in 1 L infusion bottles (200 mL medium).",
    "Solve the ingredients (see Recipe 1 for cultivation of Desulfurellaceae spp). Please remember that the reported list of ingredients may differ from the one suited for the cultivation of other autotrophic microbes.Aliquot the medium (200 mL) with the help of a measuring cylinder. When cultivating sulfur reducers, distribute the elemental sulfur powder (10 g L-1) into the 1 L infusion bottles in advance. Close the bottles with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps.Make the cultures anoxic by performing vacuum-gas cycles (usually 1 min each) with 100% N2 (50–100 kPa overpressure) for approximately 15–20 min (see Note 5).Reduce the cultures by the addition of Na2S9H2O at a final concentration of 0.05% (w/v).Adjust the pH of the medium to the growth optimum of the organism in question. Indeed, since the addition of sodium sulfide makes the medium pH alkaline (pH of ~8 in our case), it is necessary to adjust it by addition of an anoxic HCl solution (see Note 5).

Please consider that different medium compositions might influence the resulting pH and differ from our experience.Autoclave sulfur-containing media at 110°C for 40 min. The autoclaved media can be stored at RT long-term. Please remember that the medium for the cultivation of other autotrophic microbes may require different sterilization temperatures.Prior to inoculation, add the sterile filtered vitamins (see Procedure A1j) to the cultures.Add the tracer (i: 13CO2, or ii: [1-13C]glutamate), according to the following instructions.13CO2:Replace the gas phase of fresh cultures by performing vacuum-gas cycles with 100% H2. Before adding the 13CO2, release any overpressure present in the cultures. Manually add 13CO2 (99% carbon-13) with a syringe to a final partial pressure of 40 kPa, and fill up with H2 to 100 kPa overpressure.",
    "[1-13C]glutamate:Replace the gas phase with H2:CO2 (80:20; carbon-12) and add [1-13C]glutamate to the medium to a final concentration of 14 mg L-1.If necessary, adjust the pH to the organism optimum with anoxic 1 M NaOH (see Note 5). It is important because the addition of CO2 acidifies the medium (CO2 + H2O ⇋ H2CO3 ⇋  + H+).For the inoculation, use actively growing cultures during late exponential phase to minimize the lag phase. Please note that in our case the starting cell density was 106 [cells/mL]. Incubate the main cultures (Figure 1B) at the optimum growth temperature with agitation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4364/bioprotoc-12-06-4364-g001.jpgFigure 1. Anaerobic cultures in the incubator shaker. A. Serum bottle with 20 mL of medium. B. Infusion bottle with 200 mL of medium. Both cultures contain a suspension of elemental sulfur.Harvest of biomass and preparation of cell extractsHarvest the cells during mid-exponential growth for enzyme activity measurements, and during late-exponential growth for the GC-MS analysis. To identify the late-exponential growth phase, we counted the cells in the medium using a Thoma cell counting chamber (see Note 7 and Data analysis A2) and compared the results with the growth curves measured for the corresponding organism. In our case, the cultures typically reached the late-exponential growth phase after 48–96 h of growth.To separate elemental sulfur and cells before centrifugation, release the overpressure, open the bottle, and filter the medium with a folded filter and a funnel under aerobic conditions. Please note that performing this procedure under the fume hood is preferable, especially in the case of sulfur reducers producing H2S as a metabolic by-product.Centrifuge the filtered culture (15,000 × g, 4°C, 20 min) and carefully discard the supernatant. Please note that cell pellets of some organisms might get resuspended very easily.",
    "For better results, it is possible to use electronic pipettes to discard the supernatant in this procedure.Resuspend the cell pellet with approximately 20 mL of leftover medium and transfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cell suspension (3,000 × g, 4°C, 40 min) and carefully discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of 0.9% [w/v] NaCl solution (saline) and transfer the cell suspension to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cell suspension (21,000 × g, 4°C, 20 min) and carefully discard the supernatant.Freeze the cell pellet with liquid nitrogen and store it at -80°C, or disrupt the cells for further tests.In the latter case, transfer the microcentrifuge tube with the cell pellet to the anaerobic chamber.Resuspend the cell pellet with 500 µL of anoxic cell lysis buffer (see Recipe 5). Keep the solution cool with a cooled aluminum block.Lyse the cells with an ultrasonic homogenizer (60% amplitude, 4 min run, 1-s pulse, 2-s break; total energy input of 2,000 kJ). Especially for oxygen sensitive enzymes (i.e., pyruvate synthase, and 2-oxoglutarate synthase), it is crucial to perform the cell opening anoxically, either in the anaerobic chamber or in an anaerobic environment.Remove the insoluble cell debris by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 4°C, 20 min).Determine the protein concentration (Bradford, 1976), and handle on ice. Cell extracts are suitable for approximately 3–4 h of work. Long-term storage at -20°C compromises enzyme stability.Enzyme assaysIn the following procedures, the final concentrations of the reaction components are given. The suggested stock concentrations are listed in the Materials and Reagents section C.",
    "Before performing the assays, please take into account the following practical recommendations: start the enzymatic reactions with the substrates; choose the test temperature in accordance with the optimum growth temperature of the organism in question, and assume that a 10°C rise in temperature doubles the reaction rate; high temperatures might compromise the stability of the chemicals present in the reaction mixture; in case of spectrophotometric measurements, notice the maximum absorbance limit of the device in use.Test at least two different concentrations of cell extract to obtain a linear dependence of activity on the amount of the added enzyme. For the measurement of highly active enzymes of the roTCA cycle (i.e., citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase), only small amounts of cell extract should be added to the reaction mixture, if studied organisms possess this cycle. In our case, 0.5–1 (µg proteinmL-1) of cell extract was sufficient to obtain a linear activity. This corresponded to a difference of 0.3 to 0.7 absorption units per minute (Δabs min-1) in the assays of citrate synthase in the direction of citrate synthesis (oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA + H2O → citrate + CoA), or malate dehydrogenase in the direction of oxaloacetate reduction (oxaloacetate + NADH + H+ → malate + NAD+). However, citrate synthase is much less active in the direction of citrate cleavage (citrate + CoA → acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + H2O), thus requiring high protein concentration in the mixture (in our case, at least 20-fold higher). If the results of the assays are ambiguous, it may be useful to perform additional negative controls, by replacing the cell extract or the substrates with water.In our case, the final volume of the reaction mixture was 300 µL.",

If necessary, dilute the samples only with UHPLC-grade ddH2O.In our case, the CoA-esters were analysed with a 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system equipped with a EC-C18 column for reversed-phase LC separations (Agilent InfinityLab Poroshell 120 EC-C18 1.9 µm 2.1 × 50 mm). The diode array detector (Agilent, lamp catalog number: G7117B) allowed the UV detection of CoA and of different CoA-esters at 260 nm.Before the run, wash the pumps with UHPLC-grade ddH2O and potassium phosphate buffer, and equilibrate the column to the starting conditions (2% acetonitrile – 98% potassium phosphate buffer).For the actual sample analysis, use the following chromatographic solvents: solvent A, acetonitrile, and solvent B, potassium phosphate buffer in water (pH 7) (see Recipe 7).",
    "Perform chromatography using a gradient elution: after injection, increase the level of acetonitrile from 2 to 8% over 2.66 min, up to 30% in 3.33 min, then reduce it to 2% in 3.68 min, and maintain it isocratic up to 5.00 min.

For each fragment (mass M, containing only 12C), measure the intensities for ion traces from M-1 to M+X+4, where X is the number of carbons in the respective fragment.Using Labsolutions, integrate the respective signals.Calculate the overall 13C-excess, as well as the isotopologue composition in each fragment, by comparison with unlabeled samples, according to         Ahmed et al. (2014)        .The 13C-excess or the percentage of labelled molecules can be represented with column charts, while the isotopologue composition is ideally presented as stacked 100% columns using Excel 2016."
