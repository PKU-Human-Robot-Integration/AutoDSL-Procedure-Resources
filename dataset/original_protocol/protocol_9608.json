    "1. Preparation of the buffers and reagents\nPrepare cell growth medium by adding the following supplements to DMEM/F12 with L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide: 30 mM glucose, 5 µM HEPES, 0.5% w/v lipid-rich bovine serum albumine, 40 µM L-alanine, 40 µM L-asparagine monohydrate, 40 µM L-aspartic acid, 40 µM L-glutamic acid, 40 µM L-proline, 1% N2 supplement, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 20 ng/L each of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Perform these steps in a laminar air-flow (LAF) bench.\nPrepare 1% w/v alginate solution in ultrapure water by stirring vigorously for 4 h at 60 °C. Sterile-filter the dissolved, hot alginate solution with a 0.45 µm pore-size filter in a LAF bench. Store it at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: If the temperature of the alginate solution is below 60 °C, it will not be possible to pass it through the filter.\nPrepare a 37 g/L NaHCO3 solution in ultrapure water. Adjust the pH of the solution to 9.5 using NaOH, and filter-sterilize in a LAF bench. Store the solution at 4 °C.\n2. SHAPE composite material preparation\nAlginate microparticle generation\n\t\nPrepare a 2 mg/mL CaCO3 solution in ultrapure water in a sterile beaker. Mix it 1:1 with the alginate solution, and stir for 1 h at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer.\nAdd acetic acid in a 1:500 ratio, and leave stirring overnight at 650 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: The alginate solution will start gelling immediately. Make sure to use a stirring magnet with the same length as the diameter of the glassware used to ensure optimal, homogeneous stirring of the forming gel. The next day, the solution generated via stirring during gelation will appear viscous (Figure 2A).",
    "Mechanically fragment the gelled alginate solution into microparticles by homogenizing it at 15,000 rpm for 10 min with a homogenizer placed in a LAF bench (Figure 2B).\nCentrifuge the microparticles at 18,500 × g for 20 min (Figure 2C) at room temperature.\nCarefully discard the supernatant inside the LAF bench, resuspend the particles in DMEM containing 2 mM NaOH and 1% P/S, and incubate overnight at 4 °C (Figure 2D).\n\t\tNOTE: The color of the suspension should go back to red. If the suspension stays yellow, add NaOH dropwise, and mix until it turns red (Figure 2E).\nHomogenize the particles at 15,000 rpm for 3 min, and centrifuge at 18,500 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nObserve the pellet (Figure 2F), and remove the supernatant carefully.\n\t\tNOTE: The pellet of tightly packed alginate microparticles can be stored at 4 °C until further use. If the alginate solution was not filter-sterilized, the microparticles should be used up within 1 week.\nSHAPE composite formulation\n\t\nThe day before printing, resuspend the alginate microparticle pellet in twice the volume of growth medium containing 4% HEPES (1 M stock) and 4% NaHCO3 solution in a LAF bench, and incubate it overnight at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the microgel suspension at 18,500 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and discard the supernatant.\nNeutralize the collagen to be mixed with the alginate microparticles in a LAF bench. Dilute the collagen stock solution to reach a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, and neutralize it by adding 4% HEPES and 4% NaHCO3. For example, for 3 mL of SHAPE composite, mix 2 mL of alginate microparticles with 1 mL of neutralized collagen (0.12 mL of HEPES, 0.12 mL of NaHCO3, 0.16 mL of growth medium, and 0.6 mL of collagen).",
    "NOTE: All the materials being mixed with collagen need to be handled on ice to avoid collagen polymerization. As soon as the collagen is neutralized, polymerization will slowly start.\nGenerate the SHAPE composite by mixing the alginate microparticle pellet with the diluted and neutralized collagen in a 2:1 ratio. Mix the gel thoroughly by pipetting slowly up and down on ice in a LAF bench.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not vortex, as this will introduce bubbles into the support material.\nIn a LAF bench, transfer the generated composite material into a cooled microwell plate or any suitable printing container, and use within 30 min (Figure 3E, F).\n3. hNSC culture and bioink preparation\nCulture the cells in a basement membrane extract-coated T75 flask in growth medium. Passage the cells at least two times after thawing before using them for a 3D printing experiment.\nBefore printing, dissociate the cells enzymatically using a 0.025% trypsin solution for 5 min at 37 °C, neutralize the trypsin with growth medium, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Following the centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 2-3 mL of growth medium.\nPerform a cell count, centrifuge the cells at 400 × g, and resuspend the pellet in growth medium supplemented with 0.1% xanthan gum (to prevent the cells from sedimenting) at a final concentration of 9 × 106 cells/mL.\nUse a 21 G blunt metal needle to load 100 µL of tightly packed alginate microparticles into a syringe (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: Creating a plug with the alginate microparticles serves two purposes: it helps maintain extrusion stability during printing and allows for the complete extrusion of the loaded cellular ink (no dead volume).\nUsing the same needle, load the prepared cell suspension into the syringe (Figure 3B).",
    "NOTE: Take extra care not to introduce any air bubbles during the syringe-loading steps. Air bubbles will cause instabilities during printing.\nReplace the loading needle with a 27 G blunt metal needle, which will be used for printing (Figure 3C).\n4. Embedded 3D printing\nDesign a structure to print using the referenced software (see the Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Make sure to adjust the initial height of the printed structure to within the depth of the SHAPE composite support. Design suggestions can be found in Figure 4A (spiral and woodpile designs).\nGenerate a G-Code by clicking on Generate.\nInsert the cell-laden glass syringe into a volumetric extrusion head on an extrusion-based bioprinter (Figure 3D).\nMeasure the needle length of the cell-laden glass syringe by clicking on Needle Length Measurement.\nPlace the microwell plate or container loaded with the SHAPE composite onto the printer.\n\tNOTE: Keep the cell plate or container at 4 °C until printing to prevent the premature crosslinking of the support.\nMeasure the surface height of an empty well within the same microwell plate or container in which the SHAPE gel is loaded by clicking on SHM (surface height measurement).\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, determine the surface height manually by measuring the height of the well with the needle.\nSet the extrusion rate to 3.6 µL/min and the feed rate to 0.3 mm/s.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to test the extrusion before printing. Cell sedimentation can cause nozzle clogging and can be avoided by pre-extruding a small volume before the actual embedded printing or by adding a retraction volume to the volumetric syringe. In some cases, the feed rate needs to be kept below 0.5 mm/s when the needle is being inserted into or exiting the SHAPE gel to avoid the dragging of the ink.",
    "Load the G-Code into the user interface of the printer.\n\tNOTE: A new G-Code needs to be generated every time changes are made to the designed structure.\nInitiate the print procedure by clicking on Run (Figure 3G).\nImmediately after printing, place the SHAPE gel at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator for 30 min for annealing.\nAdd growth medium gently on top of the annealed SHAPE gel support.\nThe next day, replace the growth medium with differentiation medium formulated as follows: DMEM/F12 with L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide with 30 mM glucose, 5 µM HEPES, 0.5% w/v lipid-rich bovine serum albumine, 40 µM L-alanine, 40 µM L-asparagine monohydrate, 40 µM L-aspartic acid, 40 µM L-glutamic acid, 40 µM L-proline, 1% N2 supplement, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 100 µM dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dibutyryl-cAMP), and 2 ng/mL glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to damage the hydrogel during the medium changes. Tilt the plate, and remove the old medium gently. Add fresh medium dropwise to the wall of the well containing the gel rather than directly on top of the gel. Do not use an aspirator to remove the medium.\nRefresh the differentiation medium every 2 days until the experimental endpoint.\n5. Live-cell fluorescence imaging\nRemove excess medium from the gel.\nAdd an equal volume of 20 µM Calcein AM (diluted in differentiation medium from the stock solution) to the volume of the support gel.\nIncubate for 40 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the Calcein AM solution, and add an appropriate volume of fresh differentiation medium.\nTransfer the plate to the microscope for imaging.\n6. Immunocytochemistry\nRemove the excess medium from the gel.\nUsing a small spatula, transfer the gel to a larger container containing DPBS.",
    "Wash three times for 20 min each time with DPBS, and transfer the plate to a fume hood.\nRemove the DPBS, add enough 4% formaldehyde solution to cover the gel, and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash three times with DPBS for 20 min each time.\nPrepare blocking solution consisting of 5% donkey serum, 0.25% detergent, and 0.02% sodium azide in DPBS.\n\tNOTE: Prepare three times the volume needed to cover the gel; it will be used later as the basis for the primary and secondary antibody solutions.\nAfter washing with DPBS, add the blocking solution to the gel, and incubate for 6 h at room temperature to prevent unspecific binding. Rock the plate gently.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution by diluting the TUBB3 antibody in blocking solution at a ratio of 1:1,000.\nRemove the blocking solution from the gel, add the primary antibody solution, and incubate for 48 h at 4 °C. Rock the plate gently.\nWash three times with DPBS for 20 min each time.\nPrepare the secondary antibody solution by diluting 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000) and the secondary antibody (1:200) in blocking solution.\nAfter washing with DPBS, incubate the gel in the secondary antibody solution for 24 h at 4 °C. Rock the plate gently.\nWash three times with DPBS for 20 min each time, and store at 4 °C until imaging.\nBefore imaging, transfer the stained gel with a spatula to a dish or a well-plate with a thin imaging bottom.\nSubscription Required.
