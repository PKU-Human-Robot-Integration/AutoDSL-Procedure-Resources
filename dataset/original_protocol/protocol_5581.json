    "Donor mice preparationCo-house donor SPF female NOD mice in the same cage or randomly swap them between cages 3 times per week prior beginning diet treatment. Repeat this procedure for 3 weeks prior to starting treatment with the diet. Feed 10 week-old donor female NOD mice with diets for 5 weeks and collect fecal and cecal contents at 15 weeks of age. The choice of diet is the variable being examined in this protocol, to see if dietary effects work by altering the microbiota.Collect faeces from all the donor mice within the diet group so as to more widely sample the microbiotas present. For every two mice receiving gavages, collect the contents of one mouse’s caecum. Because multiple microbiota collections and donations will occur during the experiment, pooling the faeces samples from all the donor mice in a treatment group is essential to maintain a consistent microbiota transfer.Preparation of mixed cecal and fecal samplesFaeces collectionPlace individual donor mice that had been fed diets for 5 weeks in a clean empty cage under a laminar hood. Collect pellets from the bottom of the cage immediately after they are produced by the mouse, and place in a sterile 1.5 ml microtube containing 500 µl of sterile PBS at room temperature (see Recipes).Cecal content collectionSacrifice Donor mouse according to ethical guidelines.Before dissection, submerge mouse in 70% ethanol (see Recipes). Dissect the mouse and collect the cecal content within Laminar hood to avoid external contamination. To do this make a longitudinal incision through the skin and peritoneum of the mouse’s abdomen to expose the peritoneal cavity. Remove the caecum by cutting it free from the small intestine and colon at the junction of these organs with the caecum (see Figure 1), and place in a sterile Petri dish. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102015253_9837.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Removal of caecum from mice. A. Cutting of the junction between the caecum and the small and large intestines. B. Caecum after being removed.Cut off the end of the caecum, and expel the contents into a sterile 5 ml tube containing 1 ml of PBS at room temperature. This is best achieved by using one pair of flat tweezers to hold the caecum in the tube, and a second pair of rounded tweezers to push the contents out into the tube (see Video 1).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Removing caecal contents from the caecum  Sample preparationAdd the faeces in 500 µl of sterile PBS to the 5 ml tube containing the caecal contents in 1 ml sterile PBS for a final volume of ~1.5 ml. Adjust with additional sterile PBS if below this volume. Before homogenising samples thoroughly, clean the homogeniser by rinsing it in 70% ethanol (see Recipes) for 1 min twice and in sterile PBS once.Resuspend the faeces and caecal contents in the sterile PBS using the homogeniser.Spin down the homogenate at 805 x g (RCF) for 10 min at room temperature to pellet and remove solid material, and collect the supernatant which will contain the bacteria.Oral gavageDiluted homogenates from donors will be administered directly into the stomach of the recipient mice via oral gavage. The diluted cecal content does not generate any risk to the animal’s wellbeing as mice normally eat their own faeces.Firstly the animal is firmly restrained to immobilize the head. The mouse is kept in an upright (vertical) position and the gavage needle is gently passed through the side of the mouth, following along the roof of the mouth and is advanced through the oesophagus and toward the stomach.",
    "It is important to note that the entire length of the needle must be inserted into the mouse, this will confirm that the needle has entered the oesophagus not the trachea.After the needle is passed to the correct length, the microbiome will be injected. Mice don’t need to fast and volumes administered will not exceed 10 ml/kg in mice. If the animal shows any signs of distress after administration begins, the procedure should stop and the needle should be withdrawn immediately. If it appears that material has been injected into the lungs (if the animal shows signs of choking), then the animal should be euthanized. Recipient mice are left to rest for the next 24 h. Reconstitute the recipient GF mice with 200 μl of the homogenate supernatant via oral gavage.Recipient mice should be observed for no less than 15 min after procedure, and each day for the following two days after the procedure for signs of pain or distress, such as gasping, bleeding or frothing at the mouth. If any of these signs are observed, the mouse should be humanely euthanized. After gavage the pregnant GF Recipient Females will then be left alone with ‘Do Not Disturb’ cards for 2 days and will be housed in clean, autoclaved cages, using sterile food, water and bedding. To handle the GF recipient mice use double gloves and perform all work in a laminar hood. The oral gavage needs to be performed by a person experienced in the technique as it is important to be very delicate to avoid disrupting the mother, leading her to kill her pups.",
    "Inoculate pregnant germ-free NOD female recipient mice with a first oral dose of bacterial mix at the embryonic stage E(13) of pregnancy (measured from observation of plug), and a second oral gavage when pups are 2 weeks-old. Pups will be ready to be weaned at 21-24 days of age, and placed on normal chow and normal water. Similar to their mothers, 3-4 weeks old pups will receive two gavages with the donor microbiota, one day apart.Once the pups from the recipient mother’s are past their treatment period, they will be monitored for diabetes onset for up to 30 weeks of age. Diabetes assessment will be done by checking the blood glucose levels, with recordings above 12 mmol/L recorded on two consecutive days considered diabetic as previously described (Marino et al., 2009), and compared between groups. Examples of the results can be found in (Marino et al., 2017)"
