    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLPS injection\nTiming: 30 min\nC57BL/6J pregnant mice are given intraperitoneal LPS challenge on day 16 of gestation to induce a systemic inflammatory response, which may lead to preterm birth.\nCritical: The following steps should be completed within a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare the desired dose of LPS in 200 μL of injection saline solution to a final volume of 0.2 mL using a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nValidate dose-response to LPS for each new batch, investigator, and mouse strain.\nNote: In our hands, 25–75 μg LPS induces preterm birth in 100% of injected WT C57BL/6J mice, while 10 μg LPS produces ∼50% preterm birth rate and 5 μg LPS does not induce preterm birth.\nNote: In this protocol, LPS dosing is not adjusted for mouse weight change in pregnancy, and in our experience is equally effective in C57BL/6J mice ranging in weight from 25-35 grams.\nNote: In this protocol, mice were injected with 75 μg LPS. Uterine immune cell isolation was performed 6 h after injection, while IVCCA was performed 4 h after injection.\nVortex the LPS solution thoroughly to ensure the LPS does not adhere to the tube.\nDraw up the solution into a syringe. Remove any air bubbles.\nCritical: LPS is sensitive to light. Keep the syringe covered until you are ready to inject the mice.\nScruff the pregnant mouse in the non-dominant hand and hold it parallel to the work surface.\nInject the mouse intraperitoneally.\nPosition the needle with the bevel facing upward between the second set of nipples and nearly parallel to the abdomen.\nInject at the midline to avoid injecting into the uterine horns.\nCritical: Perform uterine immune cell isolation 6 h after injection. Perform IVCCA 4 h after injection.\nUterine immune cell isolation\nTiming: 9 h",
    "Here we describe the collection of uterine tissue from C57BL/6J mice 6 h after LPS injection followed by isolation of immune cells using enzymatic digestion. After isolation, the cells will be plated for immunostaining.\nNote: Prepare Digestion Buffer with 20°C–22°C RPMI 1640 immediately before experiment.\nUnder a laminar flow hood, add 1 mL of cRPMI to a 15 mL centrifuge tube for each animal. Keep the tube on ice until step 9.\nCollect uterine sample 6 h after injection of LPS or saline control.\nEuthanize the mouse and open the abdominal cavity.\nRemove the uterus.\nDiscard fetal and placental tissue, retaining the uterine tissue.\nPlace the uterine tissue in the 15 mL centrifuge tube with cRPMI.\nMince the uterine tissue with scissors.\nNote: Perform the following steps in a laminar flow hood.\nAdd 1 mL of digestion buffer to the minced uterus.\nIncubate in the orbital shaker at 37°C for 45 min at 225 RPM (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3050-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Depiction of minced and digested tissue after step 10\nSuccessfully minced and digested tissue from non-pregnant (left) and pregnant (right) uterus.\nFilter the sample through a 70 μm filter into 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes.\nRinse the 15 mL centrifuge tube with 10 mL of cRPMI.\nPour through the filter for a total volume of 12 mL in the 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3050-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Depiction of cell pellet after step 14\nImmune cell pellet after filtration and centrifugation.\nDiscard supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ACK.\nIncubate for 1 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nCentrifuge at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 3 mL of cRPMI.",
    "Centrifuge at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3050-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Depiction of cell pellet after step 21\nImmune cell pellet after ACK incubation and washing with cRPMI.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of cRPMI.\nRemove 10 μL and add it to 90 μL of Trypan blue in a new tube or plate.\nPlace 10 μL of the cell suspension in a hemocytometer and count immune cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3050-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Depiction of uterine immune cells in hemocytometer at step 25\nSeveral examples of immune cells are labeled with red arrows. Scale bar denotes 250 µm.\nCentrifuge the 50 mL tube at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in cRPMI at a maximum concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL.\nPlate up to 2 × 106 cells (up to 200 μL) in a 96-well round bottom plate.\nPlate two extra wells with isolated uterine immune cells for unstained control and viability control (Zombie UV).\nCritical: Plate the same number of cells per well for each animal or biological replicate. If cell yields are variable, multiple wells can be plated for higher yield samples. Plate a minimum of 50,000 cells per well.\nImmunostaining of immune cells from uterine tissue for flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section we describe the process of staining single cell suspensions for flow cytometry. This protocol describes the procedure for surface marker staining. Additionally, immune cells can be stimulated before staining to evaluate intracellular marker expression or capacity for intracellular cytokine production. For details on stimulation, intracellular staining, and cytokine production gating strategy, please refer to our previously published protocol.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nCritical: Complete the following steps in the hood with the light off.",
    "Note: Prepare the Surface Marker Master Mix at the end of the incubation period from the previous step.\nAdd one small drop (∼50 μL) of compensation beads to 11 wells (one for each staining antibody, excluding viability control). These will be the single-stained control wells.\nCentrifuge the plate for 7 min at 625 × g (1600 RPM) at 4°C to pellet cells and beads.\nAspirate the supernatant from each well.\nNote: Avoid touching the cell pellet while aspirating.\nAdd 50 μL of Surface Stain Master Mix to each sample well.\nAdd 50 μL of FACS Staining Buffer to each single-stained control well, the viability control well, and the unstained control well.\nAdd the 1× amount of each individual antibody (see list in Surface Stain Master Mix) to its single-stained control well.\nAdd the 1× amount of Zombie UV Dye to the pelleted cells in the viability control well.\nPipet each well up and down to mix.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in the dark.\nAlternatives: Surface stain can be incubated at 4°C instead of room temperature to decrease nonspecific binding.\nCentrifuge the plate at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend pellets in 200 μL of cold FACS Washing Buffer by pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge the plate at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend pellets in 100 μL of BD Cytofix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nCentrifuge at 930 × g (2000 RPM) for 4 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend pellets in 200 μL of cold FACS Washing Buffer.\nTransfer to flow tubes for acquisition.\nAcquire the data with a flow cytometer.\nIn-Vivo Cytokine Capture Assay (IVCCA)",
    "Timing: 10.5 h\nMouse serum cytokines are captured in vivo and quantified after LPS injection via ELISA. The protocol described here is our optimization of the original protocol published by Finkelman et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nPrepare IVCCA Antibody Master Mix in a 50 mL conical tube.\nDraw up 200 μL of the solution into a syringe (one syringe per mouse). Remove any air bubbles.\nNote: The antibody solution dosing is not adjusted for mouse weight and in our experience is equally effective in mice ranging in weight from 15-60 grams.\nInject the mice intraperitoneally.\nPosition the needle with the bevel facing upward between the second set of nipples and nearly parallel to the abdomen.\nAfter 3 h, inject the mice with LPS following the protocol above (steps 1–5).\nCollect blood 7 h after antibody injection (4 h after LPS injection) and place it into microtainer serum separator tube.\nNote: This procedure is terminal: collect as much blood as possible (usually about 500 μL to 1 mL).\nCentrifuge at 10,600 × g (10,000 RPM) for 7 min at 20°C–22°C.\nPlace serum in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nPause point: Serum can be stored at ‒80°C. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles may affect the level of cytokine detected.\nCritical: Ensure plate is coated (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 5) before thawing the serum, if frozen.\nThaw serum on ice.\nNote: Prepare dilution buffer while the serum thaws.\nMake biotinylated standards.\nAdd the below amounts of recombinant protein and injection antibody to 10 or 18 μL of dilution buffer as noted below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3050_9.csv\nIncubate for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAfter incubation, add enough dilution buffer to each standard to reach the noted final concentration.\nMake serial dilutions for each standard.",
    "Remove 25 μL of diluted standard and add it to 75 μL of dilution buffer for a 1:4 dilution.\nRepeat (b) 5 more times for the 1:16, 1:64, 1:128, 1:256, and 1:512 standards.\nAfter thawing, add 125 μL serum to 375 μL of dilution buffer for a 1:4 dilution.\nNote: Different genotypes of mice may respond differently to LPS and require different serum dilutions to accurately measure cytokine production. Additionally, serum concentrations of individual cytokines vary. Adjust serum dilutions as needed between genotypes and cytokines to keep samples within the range of the standard curve.\nWash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.\nAlternatives: We recommend use of an automated plate washer for consistency, but plates can also be washed manually using a wash bottle.\nLoad 30 μL of each of the standard dilutions onto the plate in duplicate.\nLoad 30 μL of dilution buffer onto the plate in duplicate as a blank.\nLoad 30 μL of the diluted serum onto the plate in duplicate.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 40 min.\nNote: Prepare the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP) by adding 1 μL SA-HRP to 20 mL dilution buffer while the plate incubates. Aliquots can be stored at ‒20°C for future use.\nAfter incubation, wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.\nAdd 30 μL diluted SA-HRP to each well and incubate for 25 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash the plate 10 times with wash buffer.\nAdd 150 μL of 1× TBS to each well.\nNote: Prepare the developer at this point.\nRemove the TBS and add 150 μL of the developer to each well.\nRead the plate on a luminometer at 425 nm.",
    "Critical: Read the plate immediately after adding the developer. If you have multiple plates, add developer to the plates one at a time as you are ready to read them."
