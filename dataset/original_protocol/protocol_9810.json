    "1. Coverslip preprocessing\nPrepare squeaky-clean coverslips as described in Waterman-Storer, 199825.\nPrepare 1% (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) solution and incubate the coverslips in the solution for 10 min with gentle agitation. Make sure that coverslips move freely in the solution.\nWash coverslips twice with dH2O for 5 min each.\nPrepare 0.5% glutaraldehyde (GA) solution and incubate the coverslips in the solution for 30 min on a shaker. For 25 coverslips, use 50 mL of glutaraldehyde solution. Make sure that coverslips move freely in the solution.\nWash coverslips three times with dH2O for 10 min each.\nSpin dry coverslips for 30 s using a custom-built coverslip spinner. A detailed description of the coverslip spinner has been published26 and is available online (https://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/home-built-coverslip-drierspinner/). Activated coverslips can be stored for up to one month at +4 °C in a box with dividers so that they stand apart from each other.\n2. PVA coating\nMix PVA (98% hydrolyzed PVA, MW 98000) with dH2O to make a 5.6% solution.\nSolubilize the mixture in a 90 °C water bath and immediately filter through a 0.2 µm filter in a biosafety cabinet while hot. Filter the stock solution again if it precipitates. PVA solution can be stored at room temperature for 3 months.\nIn a 15 mL tube, add one part HCl to eight parts PVA. Invert the tube carefully a few times to mix.\nPour 2 mL of the mixed solution into a 35 mm Petri dish and submerge a clean, preprocessed coverslip into the liquid, taking care that the coverslips do not stick to the bottom. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min on a shaker.",
    "Carefully remove the coverslips from the solution. Use the coverslip spinner to spin coat for 40 s. In the meantime, clean the tweezers. Transfer the coverslip to a box and dry at +4 °C overnight. PVA-coated coverslips can be stored at +4 °C for up to two weeks.\n3. Configuring the Multiphoton Microscope\nNOTE: The described protocol is tuned up to create cell adhesive micropatterns of desired shape and size on upright or inverted multi-photon imaging systems, especially the ones that are not equipped with a hardware autofocus. Thus, for every field of view (FOV), the patterning script ablates a small area to create a fiduciary marker on the coverslip, uses a software autofocus to focus the microscope on the coverslip surface, and ablates the desired pattern. Running this script in a loop for adjacent FOVs robustly creates a large array of micropatterns (5 x 5 mm or larger) that constrain cell shape and modulate the activity of intracellular biological processes. The described protocol was developed for Nikon A1R MP+ imaging system controlled by NIS-Elements software. If an imaging system from another vendor is used for patterning, the optical configurations and patterning script should be adjusted according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nTurn on the microscope software. Ensure that the \"Apo LWD 25X/1.10W DIC N2\" objective is mounted on the microscope.\n\tNOTE: The protocol described here is optimized for a 25x/1.1 NA water immersion objective, but other objectives can also be used for patterning. Readers should be aware that pattering with a high-magnification objective (e.g., 40x and 60x) takes longer time as it significantly decreases the number of patterns ablated in each FOV. Low magnification objectives can be used for patterning as long as they provide uniform illumination across the FOV and laser power sufficient to ablate the PVA layer.",
    "In the A1plus MP GUI window, set the laser line to 750 nm.\nSetting up the \"Image\" optical configuration\n\tNOTE: NIS-Elements provides users with several tools (graphical interface, an acquisition workflow builder JOBS, optical configurations, and macros) to control the microscope hardware. In this protocol, most of the hardware control is achieved through various optical configurations as well as ND Acquisition and ND Stimulation modules.\n\t\nIn the Calibration tab, click on New Optical Configuration. Name the optical configuration \"Image\". This is the baseline optical configuration that allows imaging of the coverslip through reflectance. Leave all other options as default and select the appropriate objective.\nIn the A1plus MP GUI window, click on the Settings button to configure the hardware settings under this optical configuration. Set the Stimulation Laser to IR stim, place the Beam Splitter (BS 20/80) in the light path, set the Scanner Unit to Galvano and select the appropriate descanned detector.\nIn the A1plus Compact GUI window, select a scan size and dwell time that is sufficient to capture small features on the coverslip(1.1 ms and 1024 pixels on our system, respectively). Click on the Normal button so no line averaging or line integration is performed. Make sure the Use IR Laser box is checked. Set up unidirectional scanning for simplicity.\n\t\tNOTE: If scan speed is of concern, bidirectional scanning can be used.\nIn the same window, adjust laser power and detector sensitivity to obtain bright but not saturated image of the coverslip surface. Setting laser power to 3 - 5% of the maximum power and detector sensitivity (\"HV\" slider) to 15 V is a good starting point.\nIn the A1plus Scan Area window, set Zoom to 1 to capture the entire FOV.\nSave the optical configuration.\nSetting up the \"Print_Fudiciary_Marker\" optical configuration",
    "Duplicate the \"Image\" optical configuration and rename it \"Print_Fudiciary_Marker\".\nIn the A1plus Compact GUI window, select the smallest scan size and dwell time (64 pixels and 80.2 ms on our system, respectively).\nSince no imaging is required in this step, set detector sensitivity to 0 and increase laser power to 30%. Higher laser power will thermally remove the PVA layer on the coverslip in the desired regions.\nIn the A1plus Scan Area window, set Zoom to maximum (15.87 for our system) and place the scan area in the middle of the FOV.\nIn the ND Acquisition window, set up a Z-stack experiment. Set movement in the Z position to Relative and select the appropriate Z device. Set the step size to 2 µm and the stack depth to 10 µm above and below to account for any unevenness in the microscope stage or the PVA surface between adjacent FOVs.\nSetting up the \"Autofocus\" optical configuration\n\t\nDuplicate the \"Image\" optical configuration and rename it \"Autofocus\".\nIn the A1plus Scan Area window, decrease the Zoom factor so the FOV is slightly larger than the fiduciary marker. This ensures that other small features on the coverslip will not interfere with autofocusing.\nIn the Devices menu, select Autofocus Set Up. Set the scan thickness to that of the Z-stack in the Z-stack experiment (see step 3.5.5). The microscope will scan through this range and find the best focal plane using the fiduciary marker. Leave the step size as default.\nSetting up the \"Load_ROI\" optical configuration\n\t\nDuplicate the \"Image\" optical configuration and rename it \"Load_ROI\".",
    "In the A1plus Compact GUI window, set scan size identical to that of the ROI mask. This optical configuration will be used to capture an image onto which the ROI mask will be loaded. We used 2048 pixels to achieve an optimal balance between resolution and speed.\n\t\tNOTE: It is essential that this captured image is identical in size to the ROI mask.\nSetting up the \"Micropattern\" optical configuration\n\t\nDuplicate the \"Print_Fiduciary_Marker\" optical configuration and rename it \"Micropattern\".\nSet the Zoom factor to one.\nIn the A1plus MP GUI window, increase the stimulation laser power to ablate PVA and select an appropriate scan speed (40% and 32 s/frame in our experiments, respectively).\nIn the ND Stimulation window, set up a ND stimulation experiment. Add a few phases to the Time Schedule and set each as Stimulation. Ensure stimulation area and duration are correct.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of phases can be adjusted according to the thickness and smoothness of the PVA layer as well as the laser power used in this optical configuration.\nIn the same window, enable the the StgMoveMainZ(-1.000,1) function before each phase. This again accounts for any deviations in the Z-direction.\n\t\tNOTE: The distance and direction in which the objective moves can be adjusted according to the thickness and smoothness of the PVA layer.\nSetting up the \"Label_Surface\" optical configuration\n\t\nDuplicate the \"Print_Fudiciary_Marker\" optical configuration and rename it \"Label_Surface\".\nIn the A1plus Compact GUI window, increase laser power significantly and set Zoom to one. High laser power used here will physically damage the glass coverslip and produce a label visible to the naked eye. This aids in locating the patterns in further experiments.\n4. Generating the ROI mask and Setting up the macro\nGenerating the ROI mask",
    "Use Adobe Photoshop or other available software to generate a 2048 × 2048 RGB image. The image corresponds to a FOV under the microscope (i.e., 532.48 × 532.48 µm, 0.26 µm per pixel). The image should have a black (0, 0, 0) background.\n\t\t​NOTE: A number of commercial and free image editors can be used to generate ROI masks for laser assisted micropatterning. Although we use Adobe Photoshop to generate the masks, GIMP and ImageJ/Fiji are also available as alternative free options.\nDraw 8 - 12 white (255,255,255) patterns on the black background. Pattern size varies depending on cell type (~200 pixels in diameter). Leave a 500 × 500 blank area in the center of the image for autofocusing. Leave sufficient space between adjacent patterns (>200 pixels) and at the boarder of the FOV for optimal ablation and cell attachment. Patterns presented in this protocol are available on Github (https://github.com/PlotnikovLab/Micropatterning).\nSetting up the macro\n\t\nClick on the Macro menu and select New Macro.\nImport the \"Pattern_Stimulation\" code available on Github (https://github.com/PlotnikovLab/Micropatterning) into the New Macro window. Save this piece of code to an appropriate folder.\nOpen another New Macro window and import the \"Stage_Movement\" code available on Github (http://github.com/PlotnikovLab/Micropatterning). Ensure that the “Stage_Movement” working directory in this code is identical to that in step 4.2.2. Save the “Stage_Movement” code to the same folder in step 4.2.2.\n5. Generating micropatterns using photo ablation\nTurn on the microscope and its accessories. Ensure that the IR laser has warmed up sufficiently prior to this.\nTransfer the PVA-coated coverslip onto a holder. For an upright microscope, ensure the PVA surface to be ablated faces down.\nAdd water to the corners to stabilize the coverslip and mount the holder onto the microscope stage.\nLower the objective and add water onto the coverslip.",
    "NOTE: The protocol described here is optimized for a 25x/1.1 NA water immersion objective. If a dry or oil immersion objective is used, water should be replaced with an appropriate immersion medium. When a water immersion objective is used to generate a large micropattern array, evaporation might become an issue. If this is the case, water should be replaced with GenTeal, an over-the-counter eye lubricant available from pharmacies.\nIn the microscope software, turn on the IR laser shutter in the A1plus MP GUI window. Click on the Autoalignment button to align the laser prior to patterning.\n\tNOTE: It is crucial to perform laser autoalignment at the beginning of each patterning session as small deviations in the laser path will significantly affect the quality of the patterns.\nSwitch to the \"Image\" optical configuration. In the A1plus Compact GUI window, click Scan to scan the FOV while slowly moving the objective closer to the coverslip.\nCarefully monitor the image. At first, the image will appear extremely dim. Move the objective closer to the coverslip until the image brightness increases. This is the coverslip surface that is facing the objective. Continue to move the objective until the brightness decreases and increases again. This is the PVA surface to be patterned. Focus on any small feature (coverslip imperfections, dust, etc.) on this surface and set zero on the Z drive. Always set zero after focusing.\n\tNOTE: Although both surfaces of the coverslip are coated with PVA, the optical properties of glass are not significantly altered by PVA coating. We routinely image such coverslips with dry, water- and oil-immersion objectives and did not find the non-patterned PVA surface to interfere with imaging.",
    "Switch to the \"Label_Surface\" optical configuration. Click on Capture. Return to the \"imaging\" optical configuration and scan. The glass surface should be damaged and appear amorphous. The damaged area is visible to the naked eye, indicating the location of patterns in further experiments.\n\tNOTE: To increase the size of the visible label, repeat step 5.8 in multiple adjacent FOVs.\nCheck again that the objective is roughly in the center of the coverslip. Ensure that there is sufficient water between the objective and the coverslip. Move the stage by 1 to 2 FOVs to avoid glass particles and scan to confirm.\nIn the Devices menu, open the Stage_Movement macro. Check that the Pattern_Stimulation working directory is correct; if not, stimulation will not occur. Set the variables \"PatternLength\" and \"PatternHeight\" to the desired number of FOVs that will be patterned. Save and run the macro.\nAfter patterning is complete, switch to the \"Imaging\" optical configuration. Again, check that the IR laser shutter is open in the A1plus MP GUI window.\nMove the stage to view the patterns. Scan through the patterns to check their quality.\nTransfer the coverslip to the grid box, with patterns facing up.\nStore patterned coverslips at +4 °C for up to one week before use.\n6. Fibronectin adsorption\nMake fresh 1 M NaBH4 in 1 M NaOH solution. Add at a 1:100 ratio to pH 8.0 phosphate buffer containing 0.2 M ethanolamine.\nTransfer patterned coverslips to a 35 mm tissue culture dish. Incubate each coverslip with 1 mL of the solution above for 8 min to quench autofluorescence, and then rinse 3 times with PBS.\nDilute fibronectin (FN) in PBS to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Incubate the coverslip in FN for 1 h at +37 °C.",
    "NOTE: If substantial nonspecific binding of ECM protein to the substrate is observed, FN can be diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Pluronic F-12724.\nWash the coverslip 2 times with PBS. If not immediately used, store in PBS at +4 °C overnight.\n7. Cell attachment\nNOTE: The following protocol is optimized for primary human gingival fibroblasts.\nCulture a 10 cm dish of cells to 70% confluency.\nWarm up cell culture media, PBS and 0.05% trypsin in a +37 °C water bath.\n\tNOTE: For cells that adhere weakly to the substrate, non-proteolytic dissociation with versene (0.48 mM EDTA) or a proprietary enzyme-free buffer may increase cell attachment to the patterns and should be considered.\nPrior to seeding cells, relocate the patterned coverslip to a clean 35 mm tissue culture dish containing 1 mL warm PBS.\nAspirate the cell culture media from the 10 cm tissue culture dish and wash once with PBS.\nAdd 700 µL of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA to the dish and incubate cells in a +37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 1 min.\nIn the meantime, aspirate the PBS covering the patterned coverslip and add 1 mL of cell culture media.\nConfirm that cells have detached. Then resuspend the trypsinized cells with 10 mL of cell culture media and add 1 mL to the patterned coverslip.\nCulture cells in the incubator for 2 - 3 h and check if a sufficient number of cells have attached to the patterns. If so, change media once to remove unattached cells. This minimizes the chance of multiple cells landing on the same pattern.\n\tNOTE: Attachment time may vary depending on cell type.\nAfter another 3-4 h, or when a sufficient number of cells have spread on patterns, cells are ready for further experiments. Do not wait for too long to avoid cell division.",
    "8. Data acquisition\nFix cells with 4% PFA in cytoskeleton buffer27 for 10 min at room temperature.\nFollow immunofluorescence protocols established for the proteins of interest. PVA-coated coverslips work well with any immunofluorescence protocol.\nAcquire images of cells using an appropriate microscope. Depending on the goal of the experiment, image either one or multiple cells per FOV.\n9. Image analysis\nNOTE: The following protocol allows users to obtain the average fluorescence signal of the protein of interest over a large number of cells from Z-stacks of microscope images.\nOpen the acquired images in NIS Elements and crop the images. Ensure that each image contains only one well-spread cell. Detailed instructions on image processing can be found in the script below.\nInstall Anaconda and launch Spyder through Anaconda Navigator.\n\tNOTE: The .py scripts can be run in any environment with the appropriate packages identified in the requirements.txt. We recommend Anaconda because it contains most of the required packages for the codes below.\nDownload the script from Github (https://github.com/PlotnikovLab/Micropatterning) and open in Spyder (“Pattern_Averaging_3Channels.py” or “Pattern_Averaging_4Channels.py” for images with 3 Channels or 4 Channels, respectively).\nSet parameters based on the acquired images. See the script for detailed descriptions.\nPress F5 to run the script. The progress can be tracked in the Console panel.\nRetrieve the output files saved in the same folder. The output images are the average of each channel for all samples. The excel sheet shows the mean intensity of each channel within a sample cell, which enables further quantitative analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
