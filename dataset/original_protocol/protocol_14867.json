    "NOTE: This protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Modified Krebs Solution and Test Drug Aliquots\nMake 6 L of modified Krebs solution that contains (in mM): 117.9 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 11.1 D-glucose, 2 sodium butyrate, 20 sodium acetate, 0.004 nifedipine (to block spontaneous muscle contractions), and 0.003 indomethacin (to block synthesis of endogenous prostaglandins). Use ice-cold and warm Krebs solutions for tissue dissection and single-fiber recording, respectively.\nPrepare any chemical solutions (e.g., IS, capsaicin, ATP) in aliquots at desired concentrations.\n2. Dissection of the Colorectum-nerve Tissue\nAnesthetize and euthanize male mice (6 - 8 weeks old, 20 - 30 g) in a CO2 chamber at a flow rate that displaces 10 - 30% of the chamber volume per minute until mice stop breathing completely as indicated by the absence of chest movement.\nImmediately following euthanasia, exsanguinate by cutting open the thoracic chamber, perforating the right atrium, and immersing the mouse carcass in an ample volume (~500 ml) of ice-cold Krebs (4 °C) solution bubbled with carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2).\nCarefully remove all viscera but the colon and pelvic organs. Transect the mouse in half across the T12 spinal segment slightly above the thoracic diaphragm and transfer the caudal half to a dissection chamber containing ice cold, bubbled Krebs solution.",
    "Under a stereomicroscope, remove the bladder and the reproductive organs by transecting at their junctions to the urethra, and remove the descending/abdominal aorta until it bifurcates into common iliac arteries. Free the PN or the LSN from their surrounding tissues by blunt dissection and follow the nerve from outside the iliac crest till its ventral entry point into the L6 and S1 vertebral column (for PN) or T13 and L1 vertebral column (for LSN).\nCut the pubic symphysis and right and left acetabular joints, and remove the iliac bone. Carefully free either the PN or LSN from the attached muscle and connective tissue from close to the colorectum until where the nerve enters the vertebral column.\nCarefully resect the iliac bone to expose the distal colorectum. Dissect out the distal colorectum with the attached PN or LSN in continuum.\nTransfer the colorectum with the nerve attached to the bath compartment of the tissue chamber. Remove excessive connective tissue by further dissection, and open the colorectum longitudinally along the anti-mesenteric border.\nWith mucosal side facing up, pin the mesenteric edge of the colorectum adjacent to the recording compartment into the silicone base of the chamber and attach the antimesenteric length of the colorectum to a rake of hooks connected to a force actuator (illustrated in Figure 1 and photographed in Figure 2A).\nExtend the PN or LSN into the recording compartment, which is connected to the bath compartment by a mouse hole and gate. Gently lay the nerve trunk onto a small glass mirror in the recording compartment, which provides a hydrophilic surface for the nerve to adhere to. Superfuse the bath compartment with warm (30 - 32 °C), oxygenated Krebs solution and fill the recording compartment with mineral oil.\n3. Single-fiber Recording and Localization of the Receptive Field",
    "Carefully peel back the epineurium (nerve sheath) from the PN or LSN under the stereomicroscope at high magnification (50 - 60X). Using fine forceps, tease the nerve trunk into 5 - 8 nerve bundles of ~100 µm thickness.\nPlace the platinum-iridium reference electrode in contact with the Krebs solution in the tissue chamber. Sequentially place the individual nerve bundles onto the recording electrode made of the same material.\nUse a soft paint brush to evoke APs from the colorectal afferents by gently stroking up and down the colorectal surface. Locate the nerve bundle(s) that innervate the colon through detectable AP (action potential) recordings.\n\tNOTE: The PN and LSN also innervate the urinary bladder and other pelvic organs.\nUse a pair of 30 G needle tips to further split the nerve bundle into fine fascicle filaments of ~10 µm thickness and place an individual filament onto the recording electrode.\nPlace the round-tipped concentric electrode perpendicular to the mucosal surface to electrically excite afferent endings at suprathreshold stimulus intensity (10 mA magnitude, 0.5 msec duration @ 0.3 Hz), which produces a ~2 mm radius of current spread. Move the electrode systematically (~1.5 mm steps) along the length and width of the flattened colorectum to localize receptive endings.\nWhen an afferent ending is excited, adjust the electrode position to pinpoint the site of activation (receptive field, RF) that requires minimum stimulus intensity (stimulus threshold). Discard endings with a stimulus threshold >3 mA19.\nCalculate the conduction velocity (CV) from 1) the distance between the stimulating electrode at the receptive field (RF) and the recording site and 2) the conduction delay (e.g., Figure 2B) between the stimulus artifact and the onset of the action potential.\n\tCV (m/sec) = distance (mm) / conduction delay (msec).\n4. Functional Classification of Mechanosensitive Colorectal Afferents",
    "After locating a RF by electrical stimulation, apply the following three mechanical stimuli to the RF:\n\t\nConduct the probing stimulus by pressing the tip of a calibrated von Frey-like nylon monofilament (0.4 and 1 g force) perpendicularly towards the RF on the flattened colorectum.\nConduct the stroking stimulus by gently stroking the colorectal mucosa with a fine nylon filament strand (10 mg force) to generate a small surface shear stress at the RF.\nConduct the circumferential stretch using a computer-controlled force actuator, which delivers a ramped stretch force (0 - 170 mN at 5 mN/sec) in circumferential direction along the anti-mesenteric edge of the colorectum via the rake of hooks described in step 2.8.\nClassify afferents as serosal (respond only to blunt probing), mucosal (respond to mucosal stroking and blunt probing), muscular (respond to circumferential stretch and blunt probing) muscular/mucosal (respond to circumferential stretch, mucosal stroking and blunt probing), or MIA (not responsive to any of the three mechanical stimuli).\nFor mesenteric afferents (only in the LSN innervation) that are difficult to activate selectively by electrical stimulation, locate their receptive endings by mechanical stroking/probing of the mesentery.\nFor stretch-sensitive afferents (muscular and muscular-mucosal), determine the response threshold, which is defined as the force that evokes the first AP during ramped stretch.\nFor serosal afferents, record their responses to ascending levels of punctate probing of the receptive field driven by the computer-controlled force actuator.\n5. Chemical Application/Modulation of Receptive Endings\nRecord a baseline response to a mechanical stimulus (i.e., response to ramped stretch, punctate probing, or mucosal stroking).\nCoat the bottom edge of a piece of tubing (brass or stainless steel, 10 mm high and 4 x 4 mm2 square or 4 - 5 mm diameter) with petrolatum and place it over the receptive field on the colorectum.",
    "Remove the Krebs solution inside the tubing, and expose the receptive ending for 3 - 5 min to 170 μl of the solution containing the chemical(s) to be tested.\nMonitor the response of the afferent during chemical application (some afferents are chemosensitive).\nRemove the chemical solution and tubing to terminate the action of the chemical. Within 4 - 6 min, test the afferent response to the same mechanical stimulus as in the baseline response.\nReapply the mechanical stimulus again after sufficient period of wash-out (>15 min).\n6. Recording and Discriminating AP spikes\nDigitize the electrical signals recorded from axons at 20 kHz and save the data to a computer. Monitor the signal on-line by an audio monitor.\nAnalyze the AP spikes off-line and discriminate single units based upon principal component analysis of individual spike waveforms25.\n\tNOTE: One record should contain no more than two easily discriminable active units.\nSubscription Required.
