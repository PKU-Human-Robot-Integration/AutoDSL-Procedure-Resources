  "procedures": [
    "The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, an institution accredited by AAALACi. The rats were provided by the Animal Center of Southern Medical University.\n1. Animal\nUse adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 ± 10 g.\nUpon transport, house the rats for at least 1 week before surgery under controlled environmental conditions with an ambient temperature of 25 °C, relative humidity of 65%, and 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle.\nProvide food and water ad libitum.  \n2. Establishment of infarction in the pons\nWeigh the rats prior to surgery and assess neurological performance according to the behavioral tests described below (section 3).\nPreheat the heating pad immediately before anesthesia.\nAttach the skull drill to the holder on the stereotaxic frame.\nIntraperitoneally inject the rats with 50 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine. Check for the lack of toe-pinch response.\nMount the rat onto the stereotaxic frame in prone position. Position the ear bars above the ear canal to secure the head. Ensure that the skull is kept horizontal to avoid any skewing of the injection.\nMaintain anesthesia by isoflurane (100% oxygen, 2.5% isoflurane) via a stereotaxic nose cone attachment for rats with inlet and outlet ports. Maintain the temperature at 37 °C using a heating pad and monitor the temperature throughout the procedure.\nUse eye ointment to prevent corneal drying. Use forceps to slightly pinch the paws to ensure that there is no pain response.\nShave the hair of the skull with a micro-shaver. Apply chlorhexidine surgical scrub in a circular fashion starting at the surgical incision site and rotating outward.",
    "Make a 3 cm midline incision with a scalpel from the line of the bilateral lateral canthus to 0.5 cm behind the posterior fontanelle, which should be marked by a surgical marker pen.\nUse a cotton swab to remove an blood.\nPlace a piece of surgical tape placed on each side of the skin flap to expose the scalp (Figure 1).\nGently remove the connective tissues from the skull bone with a cotton swab dipped in 0.9% NaCl. If not removed, the connective tissues will get caught in the drill.\nIdentify the bregma. Chose the central point of the bregma as the origin point and mark it using a fine-tip black surgical marker pen.\nPlace a drill at 6.0 mm AP, 2.0 mm ML (range from 0.5–3.0 mm, Figure 2A).\nPerform craniotomy (1 mm diameter) using an automatic drill. Proceed carefully, because this point is close to the venous sinus.\nRemove the drill from the stereotaxic frame.\nPlace a 22 G probe with an insulated sheath in the stereotaxic frame (Figure 3A). The tip of the probe should be placed 2 mm above the proximal end of the sheath (Figure 3A,B; Figure 2B).\nEnsure that the sheath enters the brain 7 mm (7 mm DV, Figure 2B; Figure 1C).\nAdvance the probe along the sheath (Figure 1D) until the tip of the probe is 9 mm below the surface of the brain (Figure 2D).\nConnect the electrodes to an electrical stimulator (Figure 3C). Connect the anode to the probe as shown in Figure 1D. Connect the cathode to the rats (usually to the ear of the rats).",
    "Turn the electrical stimulator on and set up the following parameters: single pulse width = 4,050 ms; voltage = 50 V; and current = 4 mA (Figure 3C). During electrical stimulation, the rat will exhibit trembling. In this study, the device was not turned on for control group rats used for the behavioral tests, MRI, and TTC.\nLeave the probe in position for 5 min after stimulation.\nRemove the probe from the brain (Figure 1F).\nUse bone cement to cover the craniotomy. Allow the cement to dry before wound suturing.\nSuture the wound with 4-0 polyamide suture filaments. After three or four stiches, tie 2-1-1 standard surgical knots.\nInject the rats with penicillin (0.25 mL, 80 IU diluted in 4 mL of saline) intraperitoneally to prevent infection.\nInject the rats subcutaneously with meloxicam at a dose of 2 mg/kg and then repeat it every 24 h.\nMonitor the rats every 15 min until fully awake and return them to the cage with a heating pad. Provide free access to food and water until sacrifice.\n\tNOTE: All procedures should follow the aseptic surgical principles. Before the surgery, put on a scrub top, surgical mask and sterile gloves after a surgical scrub of hands. Maintain sterile suture material within the sterile field at all times. \n3. Behavioral tests\nLonga score17\nPlace the rats on the surface of the table.\nRecord scores as follows: 0 = no neurologic deficit; 1 = failure to fully extend contralateral forepaw, a mild focal neurologic deficit; 2 = circling to the left, a moderate focal neurologic deficit; 3 = falling to the left, a severe focal deficit; 4 = no spontaneous walking and a depressed level of consciousness.\nBerderson score18",
    "Hold the rat by the tail and let the forelimbs reach out for a table. Record the scores as follows: 0 = both limbs reached the table; 1 = only one limb reaches the table.\nPlace the animal on a rough surface. Record the scores as follows: 0 = a strong grasp on the rough surface with good resistance when pushed; 1 = a slight resistance only seen in one paw; 2 = no resistance when pushed in one direction.\nPlace the rat in an enclosed area (18 in × 36 in) and allow it to roam freely. Record the scores as follows: 0 = walk the entire length of the enclosure without circling; 1 = walk the entire length of the enclosure with circling; 2 = cannot walk the length of enclosure but can circle; 3 = cannot move much. Use the sum of the assessment scores from each task as the final assessment score.\nBalance beam test19\nEnsure that the apparatus consists of a 3 cm wide and 70 cm long beam and is 20 cm above the floor. Place a darkened box at the far end of the beam with a narrow entryway.\nPlace a white noise generator and bright light source at the start of the beam. The noise and light were used to motivate the rat to traverse the beam and enter the goal box.\nTerminate the stimuli when the animals enter the darkened box. Record the latency to reach the goal box (in seconds) and hindlimb performance of the rat when traversing the beam.",
    "Record the scores for each performance as follows: 0 = balances with steady posture; 1 = grasps side of beam; 2 = hugs beam and 1 limb falls off of beam; 3 = hugs beam and two limbs fall off of beam, or spins on beam after >60 s; 4 = attempts to balance on beam but falls off after >40 s; 5 = attempts to balance on beam but falls off after >20 s; and 6 = falls off, no attempt to balance or hang onto beam after <20 s.\nAdhesive removal somatosensory test20\nPlace the rats in a clear plexiglass box and allow them to explore the new environment for 2 or 3 min.\nPlace a 10 mm diameter green color adhesive label on the inside surface of each forelimb above the thumb and on the wrist.\nReturn the rats to the plexiglass box.\nRecord the time for the rat to remove the first label and all other labels, respectively. Allow a maximum of 3 min. The test should be conducted 2x in training.\nLimb placement test\n\t\nHold the rats in a horizontal position and prevent movement.\nOnce the rat loses contact with table surface (passive limb movement), apply tactile and proprioceptive stimuli to the paw with the table edge.\nAssess the placement of the paw (success or failing) onto the table edge.\nRecord the scores as follows: 0 = no placement; 0.5 = unfinished and/or delayed placement; 1 = immediate and complete placement.\n4. Infarct confirmation by MRI\nPerform the MRI scan 24 h after surgery.\nAnesthetize the rat by isoflurane (5% for induction, 1%–1.5% for maintenance).\nSecure the rat head in a rat brain array coil and combined with a transmit-only volume coil.",
    "Place the coil and the rat in the MRI scanner. Secure the rat within the cradle using the tooth and ear bars.\nMaintain body temperature at 37 °C ± 0.5 °C during the MRI scanning procedure using a closed-circuit thermal jacket.\nUse a pilot sequence to ensure correct geometry.\nCollect T2-weighted scans using a fast-spin echo sequence: echo time (TE) = 33 ms; repetition time (TR) = 8,000 ms; field of view = 30 mm x 30 mm; acquisition matrix = 512 × 512; 50 slices; 0.4 mm thick.\nCollect a four-shot spin-echo planar imaging DWI scans: echo time = 30.5 ms; repetition time = 8000 ms; matrix = 96 × 96; field of view = 25 mm x 25 mm; three directions = x, y, z; B values = 0 1,000 s/mm2 and 1,000 s/mm2; 50 contiguous axial slices; 0.4 mm thick.\nReturn the rats to the cage.\n5. Infarct confirmation by TTC staining\nSacrifice the rats at the timepoint according to the experimental design. In this experiment, we sacrificed the rats 24 h after surgery.\nPrepare a 2% TTC solution before the sacrifice. Add 0.2 g TTC powder to the 10 mL 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4). Transfer the dilution to a 10 cm dish covered with silver paper and prewarmed to 37 °C in a water bath. \nExpose the rat to 5% isoflurane until loss of consciousness. Then, expose the rat to CO2 (20%–30% of the volume of the cage per min) until breathing has stopped, then maintain 2 min of CO2 exposure.\nUse the following signs to confirm death: no rising and falling of chest, no palpable heartbeat, poor mucous membrane color, no response to toe pinch, color change or opacity in eyes.\nPerform cervical dislocation.",
    "Secure the animals by taping the paws on a sterile platform. Create a midline incision from the clavicle to the hypogastrium and a lateral incision from the xiphoid to the left along the ribcage. Make a cut in the diaphragm also along the ribcage and a thorax midline incision to expose the heart.\nConnect the tip of a needle (27 G) to a perfusion pump containing 0.01 M PBS at 4 °C in the left ventricle.\n\tNOTE: Advance the tip along the left edge of the ventricle to avoid entering the atrium. Turn on the perfusion pump to ensure the tip is in the left ventricle and cut the right atrium. If fluid drains out of the nostril, the tip is in the atrium and needs to be adjusted or reinserted.\nUse approximately 100 mL of 0.01 M PBS, maintained at 4 °C for perfusion. Turn off the perfusion pump until the liver turns white.\nDecapitate the rats and dissect the whole brains using the scissors and forceps. Remove any water from the brain surface with blotting paper.\nStore the whole brain at -80 °C for 1 min (cutting brain sections is easier after freezing).\n\tNOTE: This step can be skipped if the brain sections can be cut well without freezing.\nPlace the brain into the matrix with the dorsal side up.\nIdentify the hole in the surface of the brain as shown in Figure 1G and insert a stainless steel 0.21 mm thick blade. Usually, the largest area of infarction is in the plane of the probe; thus, one blade should be inserted in this region.\nInsert the other blades at an interval of 2 mm.",
    "Simultaneously remove the blades, all at once, from the matrix and place the whole brain with the blades in the TTC solution in the dish. Remove the blades carefully.\n\tNOTE: Here, the brain sections were not easily removed from the liquid because some residual pia mater in the basis cranii interfered with sectioning. If any sections remain in the matrix, use a small spatula to transfer them to the dish.\nPlace the dish with TTC solution and brain sections in a water bath at 37 °C.\nCheck the dish every 5 min and ensure no overlap of sections.\nAdd 10 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde solution to the dish to terminate the TTC reaction.\nOrient the sections from the rostral to caudal and take pictures.\n6. Statistics\nUse statistical analysis software (e.g., GraphPad Prism) to perform a Student’s t-test.\n\tNOTE: All data are expressed as mean ± SE. Differences between groups are determined with two-tailed Student’s t-tests (p < 0.05 defined as statistical significance).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
