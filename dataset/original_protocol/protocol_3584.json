    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSequential protein extraction of α-synuclein from harvested cells or tissues\nTo model PD, we generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons from PD patient-derived iPSCs using a well-established differentiation protocol that is initiated by dual SMAD inhibition (Kriks et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The concepts of midbrain and other types of neural differentiation, as well as other technical considerations of culture modeling, have been discussed in detail previously (Zunke and Mazzulli, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). To obtain suitable starting material from iPSC-derived neurons, we typically plate 0.5 × 106 cells per well in a 24-well plate. If more material is needed, plate 1 × 106 cells per well in a 12-well plate or 2 × 106 cells per well in a 6-well plate. For brain tissue, we recommend using at least 10 mg per sample. Our culture studies have focused on the analysis of familial forms of PD, such as patients that express the SNCA triplication or A53T α-synuclein, or Gaucher disease patients with GBA1 mutations. These lines will often accumulate detectable levels of α-synuclein pathology between 60-to-90 days post-differentiation. However, extending the culture to 120 days may facilitate detection of insoluble α-synuclein, since it allows aggregates more time to grow and mature into stable structures. It is important to characterize the neuron viability of the line to be analyzed, so that these biochemical assays can be performed prior to the onset of neurotoxicity.",
    "Soluble and insoluble α-synuclein protein is sequentially extracted from cells and frozen tissues using extraction buffers containing detergents of increasing strength to differentiate the physiological conformations from pathogenic forms. Under physiological conditions, α-synuclein is primarily extracted in mild, non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100, therefore it is necessary to use an extraction buffer that will effectively disrupt the cell membrane while keeping the integrity of the soluble protein structure intact. We recommend using an extraction buffer containing 1% vol/vol Triton X-100. Since neurons are relatively fragile, using a gentle method of extraction such as homogenization is recommended for this step. For extraction of insoluble α-synuclein, a harsher detergent, such as the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a vigorous method of extraction such as ultrasonication is recommended.\nHarvest cells\nTiming: 20 min\nRinse the cells with cold 1× PBS while on ice and aspirate.\nAdd fresh cold PBS and scrape off the cells using a cell scraper, collecting into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes kept on ice.\nCollect each well from a plate into an individual microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin down the collected cells in a tabletop centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Carefully aspirate off and discard the supernatant. It is critical that no liquid is left on the cell pellet prior to freezing or starting the next lysis step.\nThe pellet can be stored at −80°C until analysis.\nCritical: Do not spin down the cells at a higher force as it will rupture the cell membranes.\nMaking an extract\nTiming: 5–8 h\nTo lyse frozen cells or tissues, briefly thaw samples on ice and then add 1% Triton X-100-containing extraction buffer that is supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors directly to the sample. Refer to recipe details listed under “materials[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1].”",
    "Use 50–100 μL per sample for a 24-well sized plate; 100–200 μL per sample for a 12-well plate; 200–300 μL per sample for a 6-well plate.\nFor frozen brain tissue, add 10 volumes of lysis buffer per milligram of tissue, and incubate on ice for 10 min to soften the tissue and prepare for homogenization.\nNote: For cell cultures, the volume will depend on the cell confluency. The indicated volumes are for iPSC-derived midbrain neurons which are cultured at relatively high density, so lower extraction volumes may be required for other cell types.\nTransfer the sample into a clean 1 mL capacity conical glass vessel.\nHomogenize the sample by slowly moving the Teflon pestle up and down 20-to-40 times. Place the homogenized lysates back in the original microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: The suspension should be homogeneous and without any clumps. The length of this step can vary depending on the rigidity of the culture or tissue. If clumps are present, the homogenization step should be repeated until a smooth, even homogenate is achieved. The homogenate should be translucent. A pipet tip should be barely visible through the homogenate when held up to a light. If the tip is not at all visible, then more lysis buffer should be added.\nCritical: It is important to have a sufficient volume of lysis buffer to yield an efficient extraction. Use no less than 30 μL buffer for extraction.\nIncubate the lysate in an ice-water slurry for at least 30 min, mixing slowly (e.g., 60 rpm) on a platform rotator.",
    "To fully disrupt lipid bilayers, perform three freeze/thaw cycles by placing the lysates in a 80°C ethanol bath for 2 min followed by a 37°C water bath for 30 s to 1 min. The thawing time will depend on the lysis volume, but should be done just until a small piece of ice is left. A white precipitate containing Triton-insoluble materials might be visible.\nNote: Normally, freeze/thaw cycles can be disruptive to native protein structure. However, glycerol is included in the lysis buffer to limit this. The freeze/thaw step can be skipped if disrupting native structure is a concern. However, we have carefully tested the effect of this extraction procedure on native dimers and multimers such as neural specific enolase and GAPDH, and have not found any evidence of native structure breakdown (Zunke et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nTransfer the lysates, including any insoluble material, to ultracentrifugation tubes.\nNote: Occasionally, the insoluble material can stick to the pipet tips. If this occurs, simply move the solution up and down several times until the particles are released.\nClarify the lysates in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nNote: Ultracentrifugation is required here to efficiently separate soluble α-synuclein from fibrillar and amorphous polymers.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the pellet. The supernatant is labeled as the Triton-soluble fraction.\nDetermine Triton-soluble protein concentrations using a micro BCA protein assay kit. Between 2–10 μg/μL is expected.\nIf extracting brain tissue, repeat steps 5–12. The total volume added will be 20 volumes of lysis buffer. This step is required to prevent carryover between the fractions.",
    "Wash the pellet with 50 μL of Triton-containing extraction buffer by gently pipetting up and down with a p-200 tip to break up the pellet. It is normally not necessary to completely dissolve the pellet again, since the goal here is to wash away any soluble liquid that could have been trapped in the pellet during centrifugation. Repeat step 11 and remove the wash buffer carefully.\nNote: Depending on the amount of the starting material and the nature of the sample, the pellet may not fully dissolve during this step.\nPause Point: The Triton-insoluble pellet can be stored at −80°C until further extraction with SDS lysis buffer.\nResuspend the Triton-insoluble pellet in extraction buffer containing 2% SDS and supplemented with protease inhibitors. Refer to recipe details listed under “materials[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1].”\nFor cell cultures using 1 X 106 cells per sample, use a minimum of 30 μL SDS lysis buffer per pellet, as a few μL will likely be lost when transferring among various tubes. Larger pellet sizes will require more lysis buffer volume (e.g., 50–70 μL) for an efficient extraction.\nFor brain tissue, use 5 to 10 volumes of SDS lysis buffer compared to the starting tissue weight (e.g., 100 μL volume for a 10 mg sample). If the sample appears viscous and hard to pipet, add more lysis buffer until a pipetable, partially translucent homogenate is obtained.\nNote: The pellet may not fully dissolve during this step, and particles may remain. This is normal.\nWithout delay, boil the samples at 100°C for 10 min.\nNote: We prefer to use a water bath for this step as opposed to a dry block, since water more efficiently surrounds the microcentrifuge tube and quickly raises sample temperature.\nSonicate the samples using either:",
    "Water-bath sonicator with a cup horn, such as the Qsonica system Q800R3.\nSonicate samples for 10 min at 30% power, 20°C. The parameters and instructions of the Qsonica machine should be strictly followed, including the use of thin-wall tubes, water levels adjusted to cover the sample inside the tubes, and appropriate distance between the sample and the cup horn. If the sample is not solubilized after 10 min, then repeat this step until the pellet is completely dissolved.\nNote: We prefer this method since it better controls temperature and is more consistent between samples, compared to probe sonicators that can only do one sample at a time.\nDirect probe sonicator\nPerform three each 3–5-s-long pulses per sample at 30% amplitude. Be sure to be extremely consistent with the pulse times between each sample and avoid excessive heat. Avoid touching the side walls of the microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: This step should be done in a safety chamber to prevent contact with aerosols and with ear protection.\nTransfer the sonicated samples to a microcentrifuge tube and boil once again for 10 min. It is safe to keep samples at 20°C–22°C for short periods, which avoids precipitation of SDS.\nNote: The boiling and sonication steps should dissolve pellets from cell cultures completely. However, if brain tissue is used, there may be some insoluble material remaining.\nSpin the lysates in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 20°C–22°C. Here again, 20°C–22°C is used (not 4°C) to prevent precipitation of SDS.\nNote: Depending on the cell material starting size, a pellet may or may not be present after this step. If tissue is used, a pellet will likely be present, which can be further extracted in 70% formic acid/water by incubation at 37°C and sonication, as described in step 16.",
    "Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the pellet. The supernatant is labeled as the SDS-soluble fraction.\nDetermine SDS protein concentrations using a BCA protein assay kit. BCA can tolerate only low levels of SDS so it is optimal to dilute the sample 1:200 to 1:1,000 to limit interference with the assay.\nNote: SDS interferes with some protein assay reagents such as Coomassie blue used in the Bradford assay.\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at −80°C at this point. Repeated cycles of freezing and thawing should be avoided.\nPrepare the Triton and SDS samples for western blot analysis, as described in section under “Detection of α-synuclein via western blot.”\nIf analysis of soluble monomers and oligomers is desired, prepare the Triton-soluble extract as described in section \"Gel filtration analysis of α-synuclein\".\nGel filtration analysis of α-synuclein\nTiming: 2–3 days",
    "High and low molecular weight conformers of α-synuclein can be separated and reliably detected via gel filtration followed by western blot analysis. The Triton-soluble fraction is most often analyzed by this method, since it can separate monomers from soluble oligomeric intermediates that are en route to forming higher order, insoluble polymers. However, SDS fractions can be used for this process if desired. There are other methods capable of separating monomers from oligomers such as native gel electrophoresis using Coomassie brilliant blue in the sample buffer to help resolve protein bands (native blue gels). However, this method does not have the same sensitivity at detecting oligomeric intermediates as compared to gel filtration. Optimal sensitivity is critical since in some models, intermediates can be in low abundance and difficult to detect. The gel filtration/western blot method described here can be used with any antibody that is suitable for western blot analysis. This is because after separation, the gel filtration fractions are then boiled in SDS and analyzed by PAGE. This exposes the epitopes efficiently so that the antibody of choice will have a greater capacity to bind to its epitope. This is in contrast to native blue gels where proteins are not denatured, thus leaving some epitopes involved in protein-protein interactions and within the NAC region of self-associated α-synuclein buried and undetectable.\nRemove the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 gel filtration column’s storage buffer with 0.22 μm sterile-filtered Milli-Q H2O. We use a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.\nPause Point: The column could be equilibrated in water slowly for longer periods if it is more convenient (12–16 h, set the flow rate to 0.1 mL/min).\nEquilibrate the column using 2 column volumes of 0.22 μm sterile-filtered 1× PBS, pH 7.4 as the mobile phase. Refer to recipe details listed under “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].”",
    "Pause Point: The column could be equilibrated in mobile phase slowly for longer periods if it is more convenient (12–16 h, set the flow rate to 0.1 mL/min).\nCalibrate the column with high molecular weight standards according to the manufacturer's instructions (e.g., Cat# 28403842 from Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare).\nIt is important to use the same injection volume as the sample that will be analyzed. We use a 250 μL injection volume, which is 1% of the column volume. Note that it is not necessary to calibrate the column before every run. This is usually done after 10–20 runs, after deep cleaning the column in NaOH, or if retention times and column pressures change significantly.\nPrepare the samples for loading. Dilute ~1 mg of the Triton-soluble lysate into a final volume of 250 μL using the PBS mobile phase. Centrifuge the sample at 20,000 × g, 4°C, for 10 min to remove any particulates in the sample. This will prevent the injection syringe from clogging.\nSet up the software for the following sequence: Set the pump flow to 0.5 mL/min (isocratic), injection volume of 250 μL, data collection in the diode array detector at 210 and 280 nm, and the fraction collector to collect every minute. The fraction collection start time should be set to collect just before the void volume of the column.\nNote: For the Superdex 200 Increase column, we typically calculate a void volume of 8 mL and start fraction collection at 16 min. We end the collection at 40 min, which is sufficient time for small proteins (5 kDa) to elute from the column. Be sure to set the autoinjector and fraction collector at 4°C. If this option is not available, the system should run in a chromatography refrigerator or cold room.",
    "Load the sample into the injection vial or manually inject the sample, and start the sequence through the software.\nAfter 40 min, collect the fractions and concentrate to a suitable volume for loading on SDS-PAGE gels (typically around 20–30 μL per sample). We use Amicon 10 kDa MWCO concentrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nWe typically combine fractions in the following manner to enhance the signal and conserve gel space: Fractions 1–5, 6–9, 10–12, 13–17, 18–20, and 21–24. Oligomers of α-synuclein normally elute between fractions 2–8, while monomers elute at fraction 15 corresponding to a 35 Å-sized protein.\nNote: Fraction concentration could take up to 4 h.\nPause Point: The unconcentrated fractions can be stored at −20°C for 12–16 h and concentrated the next day.\nClean the column with 2 column volumes of PBS, followed by 2 column volumes of filtered Milli-Q H2O, then store the column in 20% ethanol. Note that the sample injector and fraction collector should be cleaned in the same way to prevent salt precipitation in these components while the machine is stationary. This cleaning protocol is used for regular cleaning after each sample is run. The column should undergo an additional deep cleaning using one column volume of 0.1 M NaOH followed by 2 column volumes of water after every 10-20 separations, or if column back pressure increases.\nOnce the samples have been concentrated, prepare them for western blot analysis, as described in section \"Detection of α-synuclein via western blot\".\nDetection of α-synuclein via western blot\nTiming: 2 days\nBelow is a standard western blotting protocol that we use for the detection of soluble and insoluble α-synuclein. We recommend using at least two α-synuclein antibodies that detect distinct epitopes to confirm results. Antibody specificity should be validated by analyzing SNCA knock-out cell lines.",
    "Prepare 50 μg per lane of both Triton and SDS extracted protein lysates to load on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.\nTo prepare a sample, combine the appropriate volume of lysate with 4 μL of 5× Laemmli SDS sample buffer (for a final 1×) and supplement with Milli-Q H2O for a total volume of 20 μL. Refer to recipe details listed under “materials[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1].”\nBoil the samples for 10 min and load on an SDS-PAGE gel set up in 1× running buffer (refer to recipe details listed under “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nNote: For gel filtration fractions, simply load the entire concentrated fraction volume since the protein amount has already been normalized during the injection.\nNote: Gradient gels can also be used, such as 4%–12% acrylamide. However we have found that gradients are not necessary.\nRun the gel at a maximum 150 V for 1–1.5 h just until the dye front runs off the gel. α-Synuclein has a calculated MW of 14,460 Da based on its calculated amino acid sequence, but migrates at approximately 18 kDa likely due to its highly acidic C-terminus (Weinreb et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nTransfer the gel to a PVDF membrane using 1× Tris-glycine-based transfer buffer containing 20% MeOH (refer to recipe details listed under “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nTo activate the PVDF membrane, pre-wet it in 100% MeOH, and then equilibrate it in transfer buffer for 2–5 min until it sinks. We use low autofluorescent immobilon FL 0.45 μm membranes since we use fluorescent secondary detection.\nNote: PVDF is recommended for α-synuclein detection as it allows for higher signal detection compared to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes can also be used if they have low autofluorescent properties or if other non-fluorescent detection is used (e.g., radioactivity or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies).\nTransfer at constant 30 mV for 1 h.",
    "Note: This condition will vary depending on the transferring apparatus. We use the Bolt semi-wet transfer system from Thermo Fisher. In our experience, wet or semi-wet transfers are best for this application in order to efficiently elute the protein from the gel and onto the membrane. Other systems may work but should be tested and optimized first.\nPlace the membrane into 0.4% PFA fixative solution (refer to recipe details listed under “materials[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]”) for 30 min at 20°C–22°C. Slowly shake the membrane on a rotator (e.g., 60 rpm) to ensure full coverage.\nNote: This step should be done in a fume hood to prevent PFA inhalation.\nCritical: To preserve α-synuclein protein onto the membrane after the transfer, membrane fixation with 0.4% PFA is required (Lee and Kamitani, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nWash off the PFA with Milli-Q H2O, 3× for 5 min each. Discard the PFA solution and washes into a designated PFA waste container.\nStain the leftover gel in Simply Blue Safe Stain (or Coomassie brilliant blue) on a shaker for 1–2 h or for 12–16 h, then wash/destain in water for 12–16 h, and image on an Odyssey Imaging System, Azure Sapphire, or similar system. The stained gel can be used as a loading control during the analysis stage.\nBlock the membrane for 1 h. We use a 1:1 mixture of 1× Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4 (TBS) and Li-Cor Odyssey blocking buffer. If using chemiluminescent detection, the blots can be blocked in 1× TBS containing 5% non-fat milk. Milk cannot be used with fluorescent detection systems because it contains autofluorescent substances.\nDilute anti-α-synuclein antibody in the blocking buffer. Incubate the blots with the antibody mix for 12–16 h at 4°C while shaking.",
    "We typically use C20 or syn211 to detect all forms of α-synuclein, while LB509, syn303, and syn505 are better at detecting pathogenic aggregates and oligomers. Most of the antibodies are used at a 1:500 dilution (refer to “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”), but the end concentration varies depending on the antibody batch and should be determined by the user.\nThe following day, wash the blots 3× for 5 min each with 1× TBS-0.2% Tween.\nDilute secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Incubate the blots for 1 h at 4°C while shaking.\nWe typically use Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG or IR dye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (refer to “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”).\nWash the blots 3× for 5 min each with 1× TBS-0.2% Tween, followed by a 10min wash with 1× TBS (no tween).\nImage the blots on an Odyssey Imaging System, Azure Sapphire, or similar system. Blots should always be first probed with secondary alone and developed without the primary, to determine the background signal.",
    "Note: Sequential extraction/western blots should be sequentially probed using different α-synuclein antibodies. Monocolonal and polycolonal antibodies can be added simultaneously if using a two-color fluorescent detection system (e.g., LB509 with C20, or syn211 with C20). Other antibodies such as syn303 and syn505 can also be used, as they can detect additional α-synuclein cross-linked bands that are associated with pathological inclusions. Blotting for reliable loading controls can then be done to assess both loading, extraction efficiency, and carry over between the fractions. For soluble fractions, we use established soluble proteins such as GAPDH or neuron specific enolase (NSE) as loading controls. For insoluble fractions, we use vimentin. Tubulin can be used as well, however it is normally found in both soluble and insoluble fractions at approximately equal levels. Total protein levels can be used to control for loading, by staining the gel after transfer or by using a total protein stain on the blot prior to the blocking step (see step 42).\nNote: Gel filtration/western blots should be sequentially probed as above, followed by either GAPDH, tubulin, or NSE as loading controls and to monitor the column performance. For example, NSE is a known globular dimer under native extraction conditions, and therefore should elute off the column in a fraction that corresponds to ~90 kDa, however will migrate by SDS-PAGE at ~47 kDa. Technical issues during the extraction procedure may result in the breakdown of native structure, which should be evident from the analysis of these control proteins. Total protein levels can be used to control for loading in this step as well, by staining the gel after transfer or by using a total protein stain on the blot prior to the blocking step (see step 42).\nAnalysis:",
    "For sequential extraction/western blots, quantify the α-synuclein reactive species and normalize to total protein (from the Coomassie-stained gel) or a reliable loading control as mentioned above. As an alternative to using specific proteins for loading controls, the membrane can be stained with a total protein dye prior to the blocking step such as AzureRed Fluorescent Total Protein Satin from Azure biosystems (SKU: AC2124). The dye can then be imaged by either UV or green light (e.g., using the 520 nm channel of an Azure Sapphire imager). Li-Cor also makes a total protein stain called Revert 700 (Part No. 926-11011) that can be detected on the 700 nm channel, however this may interfere with subsequent antibody detection on this channel. Total protein normalization is often more accurate than using one particular protein, since the protein levels of housekeeping genes may change depending on the experimental conditions. α-Synuclein bands that migrate above 18 kDa monomer may be present, if pathogenic aggregates are cross-linked and stable to SDS and heat. In this case, these bands should be validated to react with other α-synuclein antibodies, and compared to an SNCA knock-out lysate to determine specificity.\nFor gel filtration/western blots, we determine α-synuclein oligomer-to-monomer ratios. Elevation in the proportion of oligomers normally indicates that pathogenic aggregation has occurred, however this requires further analysis of the oligomeric fraction (Zunke et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Additionally, oligomers and monomers can be analyzed separately and normalized to total protein obtained from the Coomassie-stained gel or total protein stain on the membrane. Note that although control proteins such as GAPDH and NSE are analyzed, they should not be used for normalizing α-synuclein levels in particular fractions since they do not elute equally in each fraction.\nDetection of α-synuclein aggregates via immunofluorescence imaging\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Below we describe a protocol for the immunofluorescence detection of α-synuclein. This step is complementary to those described above, and necessary to validate results obtained from biochemical extractions. The analysis of aggregates in fixed cells eliminates some of the confounds that might occur during a cell lysis procedure, including aggregation events that could occur post-lysis. Furthermore, more detailed information can be gained regarding the type of pathological aggregate that is formed, based on the subcellular location (i.e., juxtanuclear vs. within neurites) and reactivity with thioflavin dyes that bind to amyloidogenic structures.\nNote: A positive control where α-synuclein aggregation is induced in cells should be included. The most robust method to induce aggregation is to add pre-formed α-synuclein fibrils (PFFs) made from recombinant α-synuclein to the culture media, followed by 2–3 days of incubation. Detailed protocols for the generation of PFFs and addition to cultures have been described in detail elsewhere (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nPlate cells on glass coverslips and culture until the time of the experiment. For iPSC-derived neurons, we typically use 12 mm diameter cover glass placed in a 24-well culture cluster, seeded at 0.4 × 106 cells per well.\nCritical: For iPSC-derived neurons, we coat coverglass with 50 μg/mL poly-D-lysine (PDL) in borate buffer pH 8.5 for 4–8 h, rinse 3× with sterile water, then wash 3× for 2 h each with sterile water, followed by an 8-h incubation with 5 μg/mL laminin diluted in 1× PBS.\nNote: The coverglass used here is from Carolina Biological Supply, Assistant Glass cover slips, 12 mm (Cat# 633009). Before coating with PDL/laminin, the glass is pretreated with 70% nitric acid/water for 30 min, followed by three 1-h washes in Milli-Q water, using a volume of water that is 10 times that of the nitric acid.",
    "Critical: Include extra culture wells to use as a negative control where the primary antibody or thioflavin dyes are omitted. If available, use an SNCA knock-out line as an additional negative control.\nRemove the culture media and immediately add 4% PFA fixative solution. Refer to recipe details listed under “materials[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1].” Incubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C in a fume hood.\nCarefully remove the PFA and add double the volume of water to wash the cells. Repeat 3× for 5 min each.\nDiscard the PFA solution and washes into a designated PFA waste container.\nPause Point: The fixed cells can be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C until the next step.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.1% to 0.3% Triton X-100 diluted in 1× PBS for 30 min at 4°C. The final Triton concentration must be determined by the end user.\nNote: Typically, 0.1% Triton is better to visualize physiological α-synuclein found within synapses. 0.3% Triton better reveals pathogenic inclusions since a portion of the physiological species are extracted out of cells with the higher detergent percentage.\nTo prevent non-specific antibody binding, block the cells by adding 300 μL of 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal goat serum (NGS) diluted in the optimized concentration of Triton-PBS for 30 min at 20°C–22°C . Note that the same concentration of Triton X-100 should be used here as determined in step 46.\nNote: The cells are cultured on cover glass within a 24-well-sized culture plate. We perform steps 44–47 within the plate.\nIncubate cells with an anti-α-synuclein primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 12–16 h at 4°C. See the “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]” for a list of suitable antibodies.",
    "Note: To conserve antibody, we remove the cover glass from the well during this step and invert it onto a 50 μL droplet of primary antibody solution placed on parafilm. This is incubated inside a humidified chamber for 12–16 h. Keep the 24-well plate to use for the subsequent wash and secondary incubation steps.\nPlace the cover glass back into the 24-well plate. Carefully wash the cells 3× with Triton-PBS for 10 min each using 500 μL per well, then add secondary antibodies (300 μL of a 1:400 dilution) for 2 h at 20°C–22°C.\nWe typically use Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies.\nNote: Alexa Fluor conjugated antibodies may aggregate over time. The secondary antibody solution should be centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove any particulates.\nNote: The samples should be protected from light from this step forward.\nWash the cells 3× again with Triton-PBS for 10 min each, using 500 μL per well.\nNote: If thioflavin staining is not required, proceed to step 56.\nDissolve 0.05% thioflavin S w/v in 50% ethanol/water and vortex well to dissolve. Filter the solution through a 0.22 μm filter to remove particulate matter.\nCritical: Thioflavin solution should be made fresh for each experiment. Protect the solution from light, and store at 4°C when not in use.\nAspirate off the Triton-PBS wash solution and directly add thioflavin S. Incubate cells with thioflavin S solution for 15 min at 20°C–22°C protected from light.\nAspirate the solution and wash the cells twice with 50% ethanol in water for 20 min each.\nWash the cells once with 80% ethanol in water for 20 min.\nRemove the ethanol and wash with Triton-PBS for 5 min.",
    "Just prior to mounting, remove the Triton-PBS and briefly rinse one time with water. Immediately mount cover glass slips onto microscope slides with 10 μL of DAPI mounting media, and allow to dry for 10 min in the dark. Finally, the edges of the cover glass should be sealed with a light layer of clear nail polish.\nNote: If co-staining with thioflavin S, first perform a comparison of mounting media with and without DAPI to determine if crossover occurs in the user’s particular microscopy setup. Mounting media without DAPI is available from Southern Biotech (Cat# 0100-01).\nVisualize results using a confocal microscope for α-synuclein and DAPI. Using the confocal setup described in point 4 under “equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2],” the excitation/emission settings are as follows: DAPI, excitation= 405 nm laser line, emission = 410–450 nm; α-Synuclein-Alexa Fluor 568, excitation = 561 nm laser line, emission at 610–700 nm.\nFor α-synuclein/thioflavin S colocalization, use a microscopy setup with exciter filters described above in point 5 under the “equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]” section. For thioflavin S, excitation = 400–450 nm, emission = 450–550 nm; α-synuclein-Alexa Fluor 568, excitation = 510–550 nm, emission at 610–700 nm.\nCritical: During data collection, start with the long wavelength fluorophores first then sequentially move to short wavelengths (DAPI) at the end for each image sequence acquisition. This will limit crossover of fluorophore signals into other channels.",
    "Critical: It is important to note the bandwidth of each excitation filter used in the particular microscopy setup as discussed under point 5 of the “equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]” section. Thioflavin S can be excited on the same filter that is used for GFP or FITC, as long as a wide-band exciter filter is used, such as the Olympus BP420-480 with an IX-FLA fluorescence observation attachment (excitation range of 420–480 nm). If a nuclear DAPI stain is used, the excitation, emission, and barrier filters should be set up to limit crossover between the DAPI excitation and Thioflavin S excitation, by using a narrow band filter for the DAPI channel (e.g., Olympus BP360-370, between 360 nm and 370 nm, Olympus cube U-MNU). If the bandwidth of the DAPI exciter is wide (e.g., 330–380 nm), it will excite thioflavin S more efficiently on this channel. In this case, DAPI cannot be used simultaneously with thioflavin S, and an alternative mounting media without DAPI can be used (Southern Biotech Cat # 0100-01). In Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], we provide an example of cultures that express A53T α-synuclein stained with DAPI, thioflavin S, and anti-α-synuclein antibodies using an Olympus filter set of BP360-370 (DAPI) and BP420-480 (Thioflavin S) (Figure 1A[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Figures 1B and 1C[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] show an example of A53T patient-iPSC-derived midbrain neurons with a similar setup. In this example, the DAPI signal does not overlap with the thioflavin S signal, as shown in the DAPI alone channel.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/509-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative example of α-synuclein and thioflavin S staining in cultured cells\n(A) Transfected SH-SY5Y cells expressing A53T α-synuclein (α-syn) were cultured as described (Mazzulli et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), fixed, and stained using α-syn syn211 (red) and Thio S (green). The microscopy setup included an Olympus IX-FLA using BP360-370 (DAPI), BP420-480 (Thio S), and BP510-550 (α-syn) exciter filters.",
    "(B) iPSC-derived midbrain neurons from controls or patients harboring the A53T α-synuclein mutation were cultured for 90 days, fixed, and stained using LB509 for α-syn (red) and Thio S (green), and nuclei were detected with DAPI (blue), using a similar setup as described in (A).\n(C) Representative images of Thio S stained α-synuclein positive neurites from A53T iPSC-derived neurons as described in (B). The scale bars are 10 μm in all images. Arrowheads indicate large juxtanuclear inclusions, while arrows indicate cells with smaller punctated aggregates and diffuse Thio S staining. Asterisks show examples of background/non-specific staining of dead cells.\nCollect between 5 and 10 image fields per cover glass, typically using a 40× or 63× oil objective lens. The number of images to collect depends on the cell confluency. Ideally, between 10 and 20 cells per field should be obtained, with 100–200 cells total to use for quantification.\nNote: If the aim of the experiment is to determine a change in pathological aggregates between cell lines, genotypes, or drug treatments, it is important to blind-code the samples and seek optimal fields of view based on the quality of the cells.\nParameters for identifying amyloidogenic α-synuclein aggregates:\nIdentify the size and shape of the inclusion: Usually juxtanuclear inclusion bodies are around 1/16-th to 1/8-th of the size of the nucleus (arrow heads in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B). Smaller puncta may be visible in the cytoplasm (arrow in Figure 1A[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Large, elongated inclusions may fill the entire diameter of neuronal extensions (see Figure 1C[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Occasionally, a diffuse thioflavin S signal may be present, however they are most often punctate. The appearance of the signal will depend on the resolution capabilities of the microscope. Some super-resolution microscopes may reveal more fine, punctated structures.",
    "Location of the inclusion: Amyloidogenic aggregates tend to collect near the nucleus at the microtubule-organizing center. Aggregates in aged iPSC-derived midbrain neurons also occur in neurites and elongated structures that tend to expand a portion of the neuronal extension (Figure 1C[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])."
