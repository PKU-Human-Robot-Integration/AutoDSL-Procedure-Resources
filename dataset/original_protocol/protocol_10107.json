    "1. Degradable PGA Scaffold based Tissue-engineered Vessels Culture\nPGA Scaffold Fabrication\n\t\nSew PGA mesh (19 mm diameter and 1 mm thick) around silicone tubing sterilized by ethylene oxide (17 cm length, 5.0 mm diameter, and 0.3 mm thick) using 5-0 suture.\nSew polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE, 1cm length) with 4-0 suture onto each end of PGA mesh and overlapped by 2 mm.\nDip PGA scaffolds with the hand in 1 mol/L NaOH for 1 min to adjust the spatial structure of the mesh and soak with tissue culture grade water three times for 2 min each. Gently pat dry the scaffold with a tissue paper each time. Then dry up scaffolds in a hood with a blower for 1 h.\nAssembly of bioreactor and the Y-junction for OCT imaging\n\t\nSoak the self-developed glass cylindrical bioreactor (10 cm diameter and 11.7 cm in height with four lips inside and four side-arms outside the reactor as shown in Figure 1), PGA scaffolds, silicone tube (external diameter 5 mm, thickness 0.3 mm), biocompatible tubes, connectors, stir bar and equipment for assembly in a 95% ethanol tank for 2 h.\nPull PGA scaffold through side-arms of the bioreactor connected to one side with a connector as well as another side with the Y-junction used to deliver OCT guidewire. Assemble another PGA scaffold in the bioreactor in the same way. Please refer to Figure 1.\nFit ePTFE to bioreactor lips by tightening with 4-0 sutures.\nPut the bioreactor in the ethanol tank again for 1 h and dry up overnight in hood with blower on.\nSeeding of HUASMCs and Static Bioreactor Conditioning\n\t\nIsolate HUASMCs from human umbilical arteries by standard explant techniques.",
    "Expand and maintain cells in smooth muscle cell growth medium composed of DMEM medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 2.36 mg/mL HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin G, 50 µg/mL proline, 20 µg/mL alanine, 50 µg/mL glycine, 1.5 µg/mL CuSO4, 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid, 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor and 10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor.\nSeed HUASMCs at a concentration of 5×106 cells/mL in the above culture medium onto the PGA scaffolds.\nPut a stir bar (1.5 cm length) in the bioreactor. Insert one feeding tube (5 mm diameter, 15 cm length) and three short tubing segments (5 mm diameter, 7 cm length) for gas exchange through the silicone stopper lid.\nAttach PTFE 0.22 µm filters to each air change tube and one heparin cap to the feeding tube. Adjust the stir bar with a stirring speed of 13 rounds per minute. Assemble the glass bioreactor, silicone stopper lid and PGA scaffold into the culture system.\nAllow HUASMCs to adhere for 45 min by leaning the bioreactor every 15 min with stand, to the left and right. The reactor ports and joints are all sealed with paraffin film.\nConnect the Luo-Ye pump, PBS bag, the driver with biocompatible tubes as the perfusion system. Open the drive to fill the tubes with PBS.\nPlace the overall bioreactor in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Fill the culture chamber with 450 mL of the HUASMCs culture medium.\nPress the stop button and turn off the power of the drive device. Grow the seeded scaffolds under static culture for one week.\nChange the culture medium every 3-4 days by aspirating half of the old medium through the feeding tube and refilling the reactor with an equivalent amount of fresh culture medium.\nPreparation of the perfusion system for OCT imaging",
    "Pump fluids in the PBS bag to circulate through biocompatible tubes and back to the bag.\nOpen the power of the driver and regulate pump setting with a frequency of 60 beats per minute and output systolic pressure of 120 mmHg. Adjust the mechanical parameters according to the needs of tissue engineering vascular culture.\nClick the run button to make the perfusion system work. Provide the above fixed pulsatile stimulation to the vessels for 3 weeks by iteratively pressurizing biocompatible tubes10,12 after 1 week of static culture.\n2. Performing Optical Imaging with OCT\nUse a light source to ensure the axial resolution of 10-20µm and the image depth of 1-2 mm to identify the structure of TEBV based on the frequency-domain OCT intravascular imaging system9.\nTurn on the power switch and open the image capture software.\nConnect the fiber optic imaging catheter to the drive-motor and optical controller (DOC) with catheter automatic retreat function.\nSet parameters of image acquisition rate to 10 frames per second with an automatic pullback speed of 10 mm/s.\nAttach imaging catheter to Y-junction via heparin cap with a 18G needle.\nPlace the catheter into the silicone tube and identify the suture tightness of PGA mesh before loading PGA scaffold onto the bioreactor.\nPlace the catheter tip over the region of interest. Adjust the pullback device and check for the image quality8.\nAcquire images at 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28 days in culture for each individual TEBV and save sequentially with real time observation of TEBV microstructure, including surface morphology, internal structure and composition.\nRepeat the measurement for 3 times to get reliable measurement of engineered vessels each time. Capture a series of images throughout testing using the image capture software.\n3. Imaging Analysis",
    "Use image analysis software to measure TEBV wall thickness. Select the image to be analyzed. Click the tracking tool to identify the inner side of TEBV by the software automatically and manually sketch the outer side. A diagram of thickness will appear on the screen.\nRepeat the measurement for 5 times to get reliable measurement of the constructs. The OCT analysis was performed by two independent investigators blinded to the obtained information.\n4. Harvest of TEBV and Tissue Processing\nOpen the silicone stopper lid placed over the bioreactor when the culture is finished and discard the culture medium. Loosen ePTFE from bioreactor lips and cut the silicone tubes from the outer side of ePTFE with scissors. Harvest TEBVs from the bioreactor and cut into sections for scanning electron microscopy examination.\nTake out the rest of TEBVs and cut into 4 µm thick sections. Pull out the supporting silicone tube and fix sections with 4% paraformaldehyde. Perform routine histological staining of Masson's trichrome and Sirius red to examine the morphology of collagen and PGA10,13,14.\nTo assess PGA content and collagen component, observe histologic samples with Sirius red staining by a polarized microscope. PGA remnants are clearly demarcated through birefringence and the remnant area can be quantified based on the cross-sectional area10.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
