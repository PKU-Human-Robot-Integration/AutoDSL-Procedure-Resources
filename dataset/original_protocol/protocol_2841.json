Digestion buffer should be prepared before digestion using prewarmed complete 1640 medium.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2547_3.csv\nAfter washing, dry the tissue with dust-free paper, and place into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCut tissues into very small pieces (about 1 mm in length) with scissors and transferred into 50 mL tube containing 10–20 mL digestion buffer depending on the tissue weight.\nPlace the tubes at a slope of about 45° to maximize contact with the liquid. Shake the tubes at 200 rpm for 60 min at 37°C.",
    "The digested tissues are shaken vigorously with hand to dissociate thoroughly for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium to slow down the digestion. In order to increase single-cell yield, use 21-gauge syringe to aspirate back and forth to mechanically dissociate the residual tissue at about 25°C.\nFilter cell suspension by 100 μm cell strainer into a new canonical 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 5 min at about 25°C. Discard the supernatant, and scatter the cell pellet gently with 12.5 mL complete 1640 medium.\nAdd 12 mL of Ficoll in a 50 mL tube and carefully lay the above cell suspension at the top of Ficoll.\nCentrifuge at 1,350 g for 25 min, at about 25°C. Set the acceleration at 1 grade, and deceleration at 0 grade.\nCarefully collect the medium layer into new 50 mL tubes and adjust the volume into 10 mL with ice-cold PBS.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C, and resuspend cells with 5 mL flow buffer. Pass through 70 μm cell strainer into a 15 mL tube.\nCalculate the cell number by mixing 20 μL of cell suspension with 20 μL trypan blue using a hemocytomter. Record cell number and viability.\nPreparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step details how to isolate PBMCs in whole blood.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nBlood is collected with anticoagulant-treated tubes.\nDilute blood samples with equal volume of 2% FBS in PBS (1:1 dilution) at about 25°C.\nPipet up and down to mix the blood and buffer.\nAdd 12 mL of Ficoll to a 50 mL conical tube.\nGently transfer about 16 mL of diluted blood over the Ficoll layer.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 1,350 g for 25 min, at about 25°C. Set the acceleration at 1 grade, and deceleration at 0 grade, to avoid disturbing the PBMCs interface.\nRemove the diluted plasma layer at top with Pasteur pipette.\nCollect the PBMCs layer, the middle white layer, into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nWash the PBMCs once with 8 mL ice-cold PBS.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL RBC lysing buffer and incubate the mixtures on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 5 mL PBS to the tube, and centrifuge at 700 g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the PBMCs with 2 mL flow buffer and kept on ice for staining.\nAntibody mix preparation\nTiming: 15 min\nThis step details antibody mixes for staining ILCs.\nMake antibody mix for staining ILCs.\nStaining buffer: 20 μL of mouse serum and 50 μL of Brilliant Strain Buffer is added into 130 μL of flow buffer. Usually, 200 μL staining buffer per sample.\nBlock Solution: 2 μL of Fc block in 98 μL staining buffer/sample.\nAntibody Mixture: 2 μL of FITC-conjugated against each lineage markers (TCR γδ, TCR αβ, CD3, CD19, CD14, CD16, CD94, CD123, CD34, CD303 and FcεRI),4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] 2 μL of Alexa Fluor 700-CD45, 2 μL of PE-CD127, 2 μL of BV421-CD117 and 2 μL of PE-CF594-CD294 in 70 μL staining buffer/sample. This is a 2-fold antibody mixture. Final antibody dilution is 1:100.\nStaining\nTiming: 60 min\nThis step details for staining of ILCs for each sample.\nCells prepared from both tissue and blood are then washed with 1 mL of flow buffer and centrifuged at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPellets are blocked with 100 μL of Block Solution for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Add 100 μL of Antibody Mixture directly to the cells, vortex gently. Incubate for 30 min in dark at about 25°C.\nWash with 1 mL of flow buffer, vortex briefly and centrifuge at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 500 μL flow buffer and filter through 40 μm nylon strainer.\nSorting\nTiming: 6 h\nThis step details how to purify ILCs on a BD FACSAria III cell sorter.\nLabel collection tubes with indicated sample name, and add 1 mL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FBS.\nGently vortex the tubes to rinse the tube before collection.\nSet up the cell sorter with a 70 μm nozzle.\nSet PMT voltages based on clear separation of positive and negative single staining.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nAuto-compensation is calculated with compensation beads stained with each dye. Unstained beads are used as background.\nILCs are gated on CD45+ Lineage- CD127+ after the lymphocyte, and singlets gates.\nThe ILCs are sorted using the 4-well purity mode.\nThe flow rate is set under 4 grade, and cell rates are set under 12,000 events per second.\nAfter the sorting procedure, tubes are unloaded, and adjusted to 2 mL volume with RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FBS.\nCells are centrifuged at 700 g for 5 min at 4°C. And supernatants are removed with pipette with about 200 μL liquid left in the tube.\nThe above cell suspension is transferred into a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nThe cells are centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation, the liquid is gently removed with a pipette.\nThe cell pellets might be visible under the light.",
    "Critical: It is critical to leave about 200 μL liquid in the tube to avoid discarding the cells. The liquid volume of 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube is better than 1 mL to avoid cells sticking on the wall of tubes.\nOptional: Cells could be centrifuged at 700 g for 5 min and resuspended in PBS containing Fixable Viability stain 520 (1:1000) for 10 min at 4°C before staining for dead cell removal.\nNote: The digestion buffer volume is tissue weight dependent. 5 mL or less volume could be added when the tissue is less than 0.3 g. 10 mL for 0.3–0.5 g of tissue. 20 mL digestion buffer could be used when the weight is more than 0.5 g."
