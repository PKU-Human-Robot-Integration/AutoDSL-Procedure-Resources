    "All procedures described here and in the accompanying video have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Health Sciences Center and the main campus of the University of New Mexico.\n1. Prenatal Ethanol Exposure\nObtain all required materials and chemicals: Saccharin sodium salt hydrate, 190 proof ethanol (95% alcohol by volume), beaded glass drinking tubes , natural rubber white #4 stopper one hole , 1\" bend tubes-ball point, paper rulers printed from www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/paper_rulers/.\nObtain proven adult breeder rats from a vendor or alternative source. Use Long-Evans breeders for the methods and representative data presented in this protocol. Females weigh 125-150 g and 6-7 weeks of age upon arrival such that they are approximately 9-10 weeks old at the time of breeding (step 1.5). Ensure that all prospective dams are first-time mothers. Make sure that males are 12 weeks of age at arrival and 15 weeks old at the start of the breeding protocol.\nHouse the animals individually in plastic cages at 22 °C on a reverse 12 hr light/dark schedule (lights on from 21:00 to 09:00 hr). Provide access to food and tap water ad libitum throughout the study, including during all drinking sessions. Allow at least 1 week for acclimation to the facility before proceeding to step 1.4.\nObtain baseline body weights for each female rat.\nEvaluate pre-pregnancy drinking levels in female rats for 2 weeks. Follow steps 1.5.1–1.5.6 in order.",
    "On days 1 and 2 fill a drinking tube containing 0.066% saccharin solution (no ethanol) in tap water. To quantify consumption affix a paper ruler with mm precision to the drinking tube prior to filling it. Use this method as it reduces error in measurement associated with weighing tubes to quantify ethanol consumption. Fill the tube to the 20 mm mark on the ruler. Begin four-hour drinking sessions (steps 1.5.1-1.5.6 and 1.7) 1 hr after the onset of the dark phase (10:00 hr) when activity and drinking levels are highest.\nAt the end of each drinking session quantify the volume of the saccharin solution that was consumed. To facilitate measurement, determine the volume of solution per mm on the ruler in advance and convert mm to volumes. For the tubes recommended here each mm corresponds to 0.366 ml.\nOn days 3 and 4 fill a tube with 2.5% ethanol (v/v) and 0.066% saccharin solution in tap water. At the end of each session quantify the amount of ethanol solution (weight per kg of body weight) that was consumed.\nOn day 5 and thereafter fill a tube with 5% ethanol (v/v) and 0.066% saccharin solution in tap water. At the end of each session quantify the amount of ethanol solution (weight per kg of body weight) that was consumed.\nUpon completion of the pre-pregnancy drinking phase weigh the rats and calculate the mean ethanol consumption and standard deviation for the entire group. Remove rats for which mean consumption is greater than 1 standard deviation above or below the group mean from the study to reduce the variability in voluntary drinking during pregnancy.\nAssign the remaining rats to either the saccharin control or PAE conditions such that the pre-pregnancy drinking levels are matched as closely as possible for the two groups.",
    "Within 1-14 days pair each female rat with a proven male breeder. Female rats do not consume ethanol during the breeding phase. Confirm pregnancy by the presence of a vaginal plug, weigh the female rat, and house her individually. This is defined as gestational day 1. Optionally, leave the female rats with a male breeder for up to 5 days, after which remove the females from the study.\n\tNOTE: Because ethanol consumption during pregnancy begins at 10:00 hr on gestational day 1 inspection for the presence of a vaginal plug should be performed prior to this time.\nProvide ethanol or saccharin solutions for 4 hr per day (1,000 to 1,400 hr) for the duration of pregnancy.\n\t\nBeginning on gestational day 1 provide the female rat with either 0% or 5% ethanol and 0.066% saccharin solution in tap water based on the group assignment. Ensure that the volume of 0% ethanol solution provided to saccharin control rats is matched to the mean volume of 5% ethanol solution consumed by ethanol rats. At the end of each session quantify the amount of ethanol solution (weight per kg of body weight) or saccharin that was consumed.\nWeigh rat dams weekly to assess maternal weight gain.\nProvide food and tap water at all times including the drinking sessions.\nCease the ethanol exposure procedures when the offspring are born. Record the number of live pups and pup weights at birth. Designate the day of birth as postnatal day 0.\nCull the litter to 10 pups around postnatal day 2-3. Attempt to maintain an equal ratio of male to female animals in each litter. If this is not possible, cull to 10 pups with an unequal number of males and females.\nRecord pup weights 2-3 days after birth.",
    "Wean the animals at approximately postnatal day 21-24 and house in same-sex pairs with an animal from the same prenatal treatment condition. Do not use more than 1-2 rats from each litter per experiment to limit potential litter effects.\n2. Social Behavior\nObtain and prepare all required materials and equipment.\n\t\nObtain an apparatus for social interaction. Use a chamber with an open top constructed of material that is easy to clean and sanitize. The front of the apparatus should be covered with rigid transparent plastic (~2 mm thickness) for filming. Line the interior walls and floor with transparent plastic (~2 mm thickness) to aid in cleaning and odor control. Place mirrors along the back interior wall to aid analysis.\n\t\tNOTE : For the representative data reported here a custom chamber (95 cm long × 47 cm wide × 43 cm tall) with an open top and rigid transparent plastic (2 mm thickness) covering the interior sides and floor of the apparatus was used. Mirrors were placed along the back wall. The specific dimensions and materials are not critical for measurement of social behavior, however, it is recommended that the dimensions be sufficiently large to ensure that genuine social interaction can be distinguished from other behaviors. That is, the apparatus should be large enough so that animals are not always in close proximity to one another.\nObtain video cameras capable of recording under low or no-light conditions as all filming is conducted with little or no ambient lighting within the visible spectrum. Ensure that the camera has a high resolution within the infrared spectrum, however, any camera capable of recording under dark conditions in its native night mode or with additional infrared illuminators should be sufficient.",
    "Position infrared illuminators around the apparatus to improve lighting of the apparatus in the video recording.\nObtain laboratory grade wood chips (aspen chip).\nObtain a brush, dustpan, chlorine dioxide and isopropyl alcohol (70%) for cleaning the apparatus between sessions and odor control.\nApparatus acclimation and social behavior\n\t\nFor this phase of the experiment, make measurements in adult rats that are at least 90 days of age.\nPrior to each session remove any woods chips, wipe the apparatus clean with isopropyl alcohol to control odors between sessions and provide fresh wood chips. Ensure that the wood chips entirely cover the bottom of the apparatus. Clean and sanitize the apparatus with an appropriate agent, such as chlorine dioxide, as necessary.\nFor three consecutive days place an animal and its cage-mate into the chamber for 30 minutes to acclimate the animals to the apparatus. During the acclimation sessions all room lights are turned off.\nAt the end of the third acclimation session house the animals individually in new cages with fresh bedding, food, and water for 24 hr to motivate social interaction.\nRecord social interaction on the following day 24 hr after the animals were separated.\n\t\t\nRemove wood chips from the apparatus, clean and sanitize with chlorine dioxide, wipe with isopropyl alcohol to control odors, and replace the wood chips prior to the session.\nPosition one or more cameras to record the interaction. Position at least one camera in front of the apparatus so that the mirrors on the back wall of the apparatus can provide an additional perspective for analysis.",
    "Retrieve animals one at a time and hold the animal in front of the camera so that the unique features of the fur pattern can be noted. These identifying features of the fur can be used to distinguish rats during analysis rather than artificially marking the animals.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Because many aspects of rodent social interaction involve olfactory signals and smelling the partner, wherever possible introducing foreign odors should be avoided. Long-Evans rats typically have some feature of the fur pattern that can be utilized to distinguish any given pair of animals. For other strains (e.g., Sprague-Dawley rats) alternative approaches such as marking the tail with an unscented dye could be used. It is important to recognize that many behaviors of interest are directed toward specific targets (e.g., anogenital sniffing directed near the base of the tail, playful attacks directed at the nape of the neck, or aggressive attacks directed toward the flanks or belly). Marking the animals closer to the tip of the tail far from these targets of interest is recommended.\nRecord video of the social interaction for at least 12 min.\nMonitor animals for fighting throughout the session. If possible, watch the animals via a monitor or window so that the experimenter is not in the room during the session.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Fighting has been only rarely observed in studies with adult rats, however, animals should be monitored throughout the session. The session should be ceased if there is excessive fighting or there are signs of harm or injury to an animal.\nBehavioral coding and analysis.",
    "Identify the following behaviors of interest as per previous work with PAE1,18. Quantify the duration, frequency and latency to first occurrence of the following behaviors; wrestling (including pinning), boxing, crawling (crossing) over/under the partner, anogenital sniffing, other sniffing of the partner’s body (body sniffing), allogrooming (grooming of the partner), rearing, and sniffing/digging in the wood chips. Examples of each behavior are illustrated in the video component of this article.\nQuantify the social behaviors of interest from the video. Obtain the frequency, total duration and latency to first instance for each behavior of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: Obtaining these measures can be achieved manually, however, quantification of these measures using computerized analyses of digitized video is recommended. A Matlab (www.mathworks.com) script for playback of the video and quantification of behaviors is provided as a supplement to this article.\nAfter coding is completed for all rats the resulting duration, frequency and latency data are analyzed with a statistical package.\nSubscription Required.
