You should observe ∼9 kb band corresponding to the linearized vector.\nExcise the linearized vector band and perform gel purification using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit] or other commercially available gel extraction kits.\nAnnealing of oligos and ligation.\nPrepare the DNA annealing mix using the ordered oligos as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_5.csv\nAnneal the oligos using a thermocycler with the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_6.csv\nPrepare the following DNA ligation mix and incubate at room temperature for 10 min or at 16° C overnight.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_7.csv\nCritical: The annealed oligo duplex needs to be diluted at least 1:200 or further. A high concertation of the oligo duplex significantly reduces the ligation efficiency.\nTransform the ligation product using Stellar Competent Cells (Clontech) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.takarabio.com/products/cloning/competent-cells/stellar-chemically-competent-cells]. Other recombination-deficient strains with high transformation efficiency can also be used.\nCritical: The volume of the ligation mix should be limited to less than 10% of the volume of competent cells. Using a large volume of the ligation mix will significantly reduce the transformation efficiency.\nPick single clones to culture them in 2 mL TB medium at 37° C overnight.\nPrepare plasmids using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiaprep-spin-miniprep-kit].\nSend the purified plasmids for DNA Sanger sequencing to verify the correct insertion of sgRNA targets. We use the hU6-F (5′-GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT-3′) primer to sequence the sgRNA insertion region.",
    "To improve the quality of the plasmids for transfection, re-amplify the sequencing-verified clone using QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Midi Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/ko-us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiagen-plasmid-plus-kits].\nOptional: Alkaline phosphatase treatment of the vector can be performed during the enzyme digestion. If the vector is dephosphorylated, use T4 polynucleotide kinase during the annealing step to add 5′ phosphorylation to the oligos. Since the sticky ends formed from two BbsI digestion sites are not compatible, the self-ligation rate is low for these CRISPR vectors.\nNote: When analyzing the sequencing data, carefully check both the sequence of the sgRNA target and the adjacent vector sequence. Mutations can be induced during oligo production, and the adjacent vector sequence might be altered during enzyme digestion or DNA ligation.\nCell culture and transfection\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis major step describes the culture and transfection of Neuro-2a cells with CRISPR plasmids to test the efficiency of different sgRNA targets.\nThaw the frozen vial of Neuro-2a cells obtained from ATCC (CCL-131) by placing it in a 37° C water bath with gentle agitation. Transfer the cells to a centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of cell culture medium and centrifuge at 125 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL cell culture medium. Transfer the cells into a 10 cm culture dish and incubate them at 37° C in an incubator with 5% CO2.\nSubculture the cells every 2–3 days at a subcultivation ratio of 1:3 to 1:6. Cells should be passaged for at least 1–2 generations before transfection to ensure they have fully recovered from the frozen stock.\nOne day before transfection, plate 2–5 × 105 cells in 2 mL of cell culture medium in a well of a 6-well plate so that cells reach 70%–90% confluent at the time of transfection.",
    "Transfect Neuro-2a cells using Lipofectamine 2000.\nDilute 10 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 in 125 μL of Opti-MEM medium for each well of the 6-well plate. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nDilute 4 μg of plasmid DNA in 125 μL of Opti-MEM.\nAdd the diluted DNA to the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 (total volume = 250 μL), mix gently, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nAdd the 250 μL DNA-lipid complex to each well and mix gently.\nGenomic DNA isolation and surveyor assay\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis major step describes the preparation of genomic DNA from Neuro-2a cells and surveyor assay using the genomic DNA to test the efficiency of different sgRNA targets.\n48 h after transfection, remove the medium from cells and then harvest cells with 200 μL of PBND buffer (with added protease K).\nTransfer the cell lysate to a PCR tube and put it in a thermocycler with the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_8.csv\nSurveyor PCR.\nPrepare the PCR reaction mix with the following surveyor PCR oligos:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_9.csv\nRun the PCR reaction in a thermocycler with the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_10.csv\nAnalyze the PCR product using an agarose gel. Cut out the band corresponding to the desired size and perform gel purification using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2930-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of surveyor assay results\n(A) Predicted size of PCR products in the surveyor assay before and after T7 cleavage.\n(B) Surveyor assay results of two different genes.",
    "Note: Ideally, there should be only a single band that corresponds to the desired size. Exercise caution to only cut the target band if there are multiple bands present on the gel. Since the quality of the PCR product is critical for the subsequent T7 endonuclease assay, it is advisable to design a new set of primers to obtain more specific PCR products.\nPerform the surveyor nuclease assay with T7 endonuclease.\nPrepare the following T7 annealing mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_11.csv\nAnneal the PCR products in a thermocycler using the same DNA anneal program as described in step 2b.\nAdd 1 μL of T7 endonuclease I (NEB) to the annealed PCR products and incubate the mixture at 37° C for 15 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 1.5 μL of 0.25 M EDTA.\nAdd DNA loading buffer and run the mixture on an agarose gel to assess the T7 cleavage efficiency.\nNote: For each sgRNA target, it is necessary to set up a non-T7 endonuclease cleaved control and run it alongside the T7 endonuclease cleaved sample. Half of the gel-purified PCR product can be used for the T7 reaction, while the remaining purified DNA can serve as the control. Compared to the non-cut controls, the T7 endonuclease cleavage should result in two fragments that are locates close to the sgRNA target site: one upstream and one downstream. Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example of a successful assay. Three targets were chosen for each Genes. The length of the surveyor assay PCR products and the predicted sizes after T7 endonuclease cleavage are listed in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A. In the actual result shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, T1, T3, T4, and T5 exhibited higher efficiency compared to T2 and T6.\nOrder oligo template and CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and perform microinjection\nTiming: 3 months",
    "This major step describes how to design and order oligo template and crRNA for microinjection. Both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide and donor plasmid have been used as templates for homology-directed repair (HDR). In general, the ssDNA template offers a higher insertion efficiency and requires shorter homologous arms compared to the dsDNA template.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] On the other hand, both short ssDNA (<200 bp) and long ssDNA (>200 bp) can be synthesized directly by major vendors within a reasonable time and cost. Compared to sgRNA, we prefer a two-part guide RNA system, which includes crRNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). The tracrRNA pairs with complementary sequences within the crRNA to form a functional gRNA duplex (crRNA:tracrRNA) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Using this system, only crRNA needs to be ordered for each CRISPR project, and tracrRNA is the same for different targets, providing high activity at an affordable price. For the form of Cas9 nuclease, recombinant S. pyogenes Cas9 protein is a better option compared to Cas9 mRNA due to increased stability and the absence of the need for protein translation. All these reagents were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (IDT).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2930-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Design of HDR template\n(A) Illustration depicting the binding of Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex with the target DNA.\n(B) Example of asymmetric donor DNA design with the target strand, resulting in a high HDR rate.\nCompare the genomic editing efficiency of different sgRNA targets from the surveyor assay and select one target site with the highest efficiency and the least distance to the tag insertion site. The HDR template will be designed according to the selected site.",
    "When designing the HDR template, the length of the homolog arm and the selection of the target vs. non-target strand will affect the efficiency of insertion. In our hands, we achieved the highest HDR rate with asymmetric donor DNA and the target strand, as reported previously.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nAs shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, the crRNA:tracrRNA:Cas9 complex targets the DNA strand complementary to the gRNA and generates a double-strand break 3 bp upstream of the NGG PAM sequence.\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B shows an example of a ssDNA oligo template design when a 3×Flag tag is desired to be inserted at the N-terminus of a protein. The template was designed as the target strand with 36 bp before the 3×Flag tag and 91 bp after the 3×Flag tag. Keep in mind that the left homologous arm of the 3×Flag tag should not be less than 36 bp.\nIf the cut site is not exactly the site of insertion, the homologous arm on one side needs to be longer to take the extra DNA sequence between the cut site and insertion site into consideration.\nOrder the crRNA and ssDNA oligo from IDT. When ordering the crRNA, enter the 20 bp DNA sequence upstream of the PAM site in IDT’s online ordering tool, which automatically converts the DNA sequence to RNA during the ordering process. We normally order 2 nmol of crRNA and 4 nmol of Ultramer DNA oligo with standard desalting purification.\nDeliver the crRNA and ssDNA oligo to the UT Southwestern Transgenic Core for microinjection. Many institutions offer mouse microinjection services in core facilities. If microinjection is not available at the reader’s institution, there are other commercial alternatives, such as Charles River.\nCas9 protein and tracrRNA were provided by the UT Southwestern Transgenic Core and mixed with crRNA and ssDNA oligo for the microinjection.",
    "Note: C57BL/6 mice are the most commonly used inbred mice in biochemical research and are generally used to produce CRISPR mice. There are several different substrains of C57BL/6 mice, such as C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N, which carry different mutations.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Readers need to check carefully and choose a strain that does not affect their research.\nAt the UT Southwestern Transgenic Core, zygotes were prepared, injected with crRNA-tracrRNA/Cas9/ssDNA, and then transferred into pseudopregnant foster mothers. Pups were born and delivered to the requester around the weaning age (3–4 weeks).\nGenotyping and breeding of mice\nTiming: 6 months\nThis major step describes how to genotype and breed CRSIRP-modified mice. For genotyping, we typically use PCR genotyping as the initial step to check for the presence of the tag insertion. Subsequently, only the PCR-positive mice are sequenced to determine the exact nucleotide sequence of the tag and flanking regions. Genotyping-verified founders are then bred to establish individual knock-in mouse lines.\nDesign primers for PCR and sequencing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2930-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Design of primers for genotyping tag knock-in mice\n(A) Illustration showing the design of two primer sets (FI + RI, FT + RT) for genotyping.\n(B) Anticipated agarose gel results showing different genotypes.\nDesign a primer set (FT and RT in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) to detect the 3×Flag tag in front of ATG. This primer set can only detect the tag insertion but cannot distinguish between one copy (hemizygous) and two copies (homozygous) of the tag insertion.\nDesign a primer set (FI and RI in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) to detect the insertions on two chromosomes. This primer set can distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous insertions but cannot determine if the inserted DNA is the 3×Flag tag.",
    "Note: Keep in mind that these tags are very small (66 bp for 3×Flag tag), so the amplification regions should be designed to be small enough to differentiate a tag insertion.\nDuring weaning, tag mice and perform tail snipping for genotyping.\nLysis tails with 200 μL of PBND buffer (with added protease K) and incubate on a 56° C shaker for 2 h to overnight until the tissue is completely lysed.\nHeat the samples at 95° C for 5 min to inactivate the proteinase K.\nPrepare the following genotyping PCR reaction mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_12.csv\nRun the PCR reaction in a thermocycler with the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2930_13.csv\nMice with positive results from both FT + RT and FI + RI PCR gels should be kept for sequencing to verify the correct sequence of the tag and flanking regions.\nFrom the FI + RI PCR gel, cut the larger tag insertion band in hemizygous and homozygous mice and perform gel purification with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit]. Send the purified PCR product and use either FI or RI primer for Sanger sequencing.\nFor genotyping verified founders, set up breeding cages for each individual founder (G0) to breed with wild-type mice (C57BL/6J).\nGenotype the progeny (G1) and set up breeding cages for intercrossing these G1 mice for each founder line. Keep the homozygous progeny (G2) and establish breeding cages for a homozygous stock line.\nTesting the expression of the tag in different mouse tissues\nTiming: 2–3 days",
    "This major step describes how to test the expression of the tag in different mouse tissues. Although homozygous tag knock-in mice are more desirable for experiments, hemizygous tag knock-in mice might be sufficient to assess the tag expression of proteins with reasonable abundance. Age- and sex-matched wild-type mice should be dissected in the same manner as the tag knock-in mice to serve as controls. Western blot is typically used to test the tag expression.\nDissect different mouse tissues and prepare samples for western blot.\nDissect mouse tissues and place them in 2 mL beating tubes filled with ceramic beads. Snap-freeze these tubes in liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: The weight of different tissues needs to be optimized to obtain sufficient protein for western blot while also ensuring complete lysis. As a rule of thumb, we use 100 mg of tissue per 1 mL of lysis buffer for most tissues, except for adipose tissues, which require 250 mg of tissue per 1 mL of lysis buffer.\nOnce the dissection is complete, fill the tube with 1 mL of cold RIPA lysis buffer (with freshly added protease inhibitor) and use bead mill homogenizer to lyse the tissues.\nCritical: The tissue lysates should be kept at 4° C to slow down protein degradation. Bead mill homogenizers generate a significant amount of heat during high-speed or prolonged homogenization. For tough tissues, it is necessary to break down the homogenization process into separate sections and cool down samples on ice in between these sections.\nSonicate tissue lysates on ice to break down genomic DNA into small pieces to reduce viscosity.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4° C. Transfer the supernatant into a new tube and measure the protein concertation using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225].",
    "Adjust the protein concentration with RIPA lysis buffer and 4× LDS loading buffer. The final protein concertation of all mouse tissue lysates should be the same in 1× LDS loading buffer (around 2–10 μg/μL).\nLoad 20 μg of samples into each well of 4%–12% NuPAGE Bris-Tris gels and run the gels with 1× MOPS buffer at 120V for 1–2 h.\nTransfer the proteins from the gels to NC membranes at 15 V for 30 min, then incubate and wash the members for signal detection.\nBlock the membranes with 5% non-fat milk in 1×TBST at room temperature for 1 h.\nIncubate the membranes with the primary antibody diluted in 1% BSA 1×TBST at 4° C overnight.\nWash the membranes with 1×TBST for 15 min three times.\nIncubate the membranes with the secondary antibody diluted in 1% BSA 1×TBST at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the membranes with 1×TBST for 15 min three times.\nVisualize the membranes using a chemiluminescent substrate."
