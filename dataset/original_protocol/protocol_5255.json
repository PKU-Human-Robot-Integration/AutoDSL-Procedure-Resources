  "procedures": [
    "The protocols described here were developed for a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) construct containing a thermo-stabilizing E122W mutation (Roth et al., 2008), C-terminal truncation at residue 348, deletion of residues 245 to 259 in the third intracellular loop (ICL3), a FLAG tag at the N-terminus and a 10x His tag at the C-terminus. The construct also contains C327S and C341S mutations, leaving just a single reactive cysteine residue (Cys265) for fluorophore labeling. The deletions, truncations and cysteine mutations do not disrupt binding of ligands to the receptor (Liu et al., 2012). The procedures to express the receptor in sf9 insect cells infected with high-titer recombinant virus are described elsewhere (Cherezov et al., 2008).Receptor purification and Cy3 labelingLyse and wash frozen β2AR biomass (5 L, roughly 0.5 mg receptor/1 L biomass) using a 100 ml glass tissue homogenizer. Cell lysis is chiefly achieved through the use of hypertonic (low salt) buffer and the mechanical force of homogenization. Wash lysed biomass with the low salt wash buffer and the high salt wash buffer 3 times, respectively (500 ml per wash). Use Beckman Ultra centrifuge to pellet membrane fragment suspension (158,000 x g, Ti45 rotor, 35 min, 4 °C) in between washes. The washed membranes can be stored at -80 °C for up to two weeks or 4 °C overnight. Ideally, the washed membrane should be aliquoted, so that each aliquot of membranes contains roughly 0.5-1 mg of final purified receptor. Treat one aliquot of washed membrane with 1 mM timolol (dissolved in ddH2O), 1 crushed Roche protease inhibitor tablet for 30 min at 4 °C. This step can be done by adding a previously prepared 100 mM timolol stock (stored at 4 °C) and crushed Roche inhibitor directly to the suspended membrane.",
    "Then, thoroughly mix the treated membrane with the solubilization buffer at 1:1 ratio for 3 h at 4 °C.Remove membrane pellet from supernatant using Beckman Ultra centrifuge (rotor Ti70) at 265,000 x g, 35 min, 4 °C. Add stock 5 M NaCl, 4 M imidazole to the supernatant, so that the final concentration is 800 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole. Add 0.5 ml washed talon slurry to the supernatant and incubate at 4 °C overnight. Pellet talon resin using Beckman X-12R centrifuge (or equivalent) at 500 x g, 1 min, 4 °C and remove supernatant. Wash with 50 ml wash buffer 1, 10 ml wash buffer 2, 10 ml labeling buffer. Add 5 ml labeling buffer on top of the pelleted resin, and 20 μl of 5 mg/ml (in DMSO) Cy3 stock (approximately 25 μM final concentration, whereas the receptor concentration is approximately 1-5 μM). Incubate at 4 °C for 2 h in the dark. Load talon resin onto an empty column and wash with 50 ml wash buffer 2 using gravity flow. Elute purified, labeled receptor using 1 ml fractions of elution buffer. Run SDS-PAGE to visualize the elution pattern. Concentrate Cy3-labeled receptors using a 100 kDa MWCO vivaspin2 concentrator.Nanodisc preparationMix labeled receptor, purified MSP1 and phospholipid mixture at a molar ratio 1:10:700 in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. The phospholipid mixture contains POPC, POPS and biotinyl Cap PE in the ratio 67.5%, 27.5%, and 5%. Add Bio-Bead resin and incubate overnight at 4 °C.Remove Bio-Bead resin by pelleting. Purify nanodiscs by size exclusion chromatography using an AKTAxpress FPLC system, superdex 200 Increase 100/300 GL column and SEC elution buffer. Representative elution profiles of membrane protein-nanodisc complexes are presented elsewhere (Ritchie et al., 2009).",
    "Remove empty nanodiscs by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using an AKTAxpress FPLC system, Ni column and IMAC elution buffer. Exchange buffer to the final buffer using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare).Note: Ni-NTA and talon (Co2+) resins are both used to purify the receptor protein with poly-histidine tag, but differ in that 1) Ni2+ has greater affinity for histidine, conferring a larger binding capacity per ml of resin, whereas 2) Co2+ has greater selectivity toward histidine. As such talon resins are preferable to be used on crude lysate, as described in step A3 above, whereas Ni-NTA is preferable for the final purification step described here.Surface immobilization of receptor-nanodisc complexesClean quartz slides and cover slips, passivate the surfaces with polyethylene glycol (5% biotinylated), as described previously (Lamichhane et al., 2010). Prepare a microfluidic channel about 4-5 mm wide on the quartz slide using double sided tape, fix cover slip on top of the double sided tape and close the two ends of channel using silicon grease at the time of experiment (Figure 2). This device is subsequently referred to as the sample chamber.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170612/20170612014648_3237.jpgFigure 2. Illustration of the microfluidic sample chamber. Buffers or sample solutions are introduced through the entrance port via a pipette tip, as shown. Any excess solution flows out of the exit port, as shown.Fill the sample chamber with 0.2 mg/ml neutravidin and incubate for five minutes followed by final buffer wash.Fill the sample chamber with 100 μl of receptor-nanodisc complexes (approximately 1 nM concentration), incubate for 10 min to allow complexes (containing 5% biotinylated lipids) to bind to neutravidin on the surface, then flush the chamber with imaging buffer.",
    "Single-molecule fluorescence data acquisitionA microscope capable of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) measurements, equipped with a 532 nm (green) laser for excitation (prism-based or objective-based illumination) and an intensified charge coupled device (CCD) camera capable of detecting the fluorescence emission from single fluorophores (Berezhna et al., 2012) is used to record a TIRF image of the surface at regular time intervals (e.g., every 100 msec or shorter, depending on the frame time of the CCD camera) for a total period of at least 100 sec. Many discrete fluorescent spots should be visible in the image, each representing individual receptor-nanodisc complexes (Figure 3A).Add a ligand, such as the agonist formoterol or inverse agonist ICI 118,551 (1 mM), to the sample chamber, allow ligand to interact with receptor (30 min to 1 h) and repeat the data acquisition. Alternatively, prepare a new sample chamber containing a pre-incubated mixture of receptor-nanodisc complexes and ligand.As a control to test for non-specific binding, add receptor-nanodisc complexes to a surface lacking neutravidin. Very few fluorescent spots should be visible on the surface (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170612/20170612014822_8081.jpgFigure 3. TIRF images of immobilized receptor-nanodisc complexes and representative time trace for a single receptor-nanodisc complex (reproduced from Lamichhane et al., 2015). A. Typical TIRF image showing a 5 x 5 μm region (approximate dimensions) of immobilized Cy3-labeled β2AR reconstituted in nanodiscs. Each spot is due to the fluorescence emitted from an individual receptor-nanodisc complex. The very bright spots are due to a small fraction of receptor-nanodisc aggregates, which are readily identified and excluded from the data analysis. B. Corresponding TIRF image for a control surface lacking neutravidin. The number of fluorescent spots is greatly reduced relative to part A, indicating a negligible level of non-specific adsorption of receptor-nanodisc complexes. C.",
    "Representative fluorescence intensity versus time trace from a single nanodisc-bound receptor, showing repeated two-state intensity jumps prior to an irreversible photobleaching event. The red line is the best fit from Hidden Markov modeling. The single-step photobleaching transition confirms that a single receptor molecule is contained within the nanodisc."
