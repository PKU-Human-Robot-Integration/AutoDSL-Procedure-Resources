    "Cell harvesting and crude fractionation Human cell harvesting (here, we describe an example procedure for 2,500 cm2 of adherent HEK293 cells cultivated in eleven 225 cm2 flasks):Gently aspirate the medium using a vacuum aspiration system. To each flask, add 25 mL of sterile EDTA-DPBS and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.Gently hit the flasks with a hand to facilitate cells detachment. Collect the cell suspension into six 50 mL tubes.To collect the maximum of cells, rinse the flasks with 25 mL of EDTA-DPBS by transferring the solution from flask to flask. Divide the obtained cell suspension between the six half-filled 50 mL tubes from the previous step.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 600× g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Add 15 mL of sterile DPBS at room temperature to each tube and pool cell suspensions in two 50 mL tubes.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 600× g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Preparation of crude mitochondria (all procedures are carried out on ice with pre-chilled solutions and tubes):Resuspend the cells in 30 mL of buffer A.Disrupt the cells at high speed with a pre-chilled laboratory blender three times for 15 s, with 1 min intervals to prevent overheating. Place the homogenate into a 50 mL tube.Remove cellular debris and nuclei by low-speed centrifugation in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge at 1,000× g for 3 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into a new 50 mL tube.Repeat the procedure described in A2c twice.Note: The cell debris/nuclei pellet is easily dislodged and dispersed; one should pipette very carefully to limit this undesirable contamination. Transfer the supernatant into polycarbonate 50 mL bottles with screw cap. Pellet crude mitochondria by centrifugation in a refrigerated high-speed centrifuge at 21,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C.",
    "A brownish pellet will form. Carefully pipette the supernatant out.Carefully but thoroughly resuspend the mitochondrial pellet in 8 mL of buffer A and split in four 2 mL portions.Note: It is important to resuspend well the crude mitochondrial pellet and obtain a homogeneous suspension. However, do not overdo it to prevent the lysis of mitochondria. Prepare four two-cushion sucrose gradients in SW 32 Ti centrifugation tubes. First, place 10 mL of buffer B in the tube. Then, carefully and slowly layer 15 mL of buffer C along the tube wall atop the first cushion using a soft, smoothly going pipette. Avoid disturbing the lower cushion.Carefully load each 2 mL portion of crude mitochondria atop a two-cushion gradient.Centrifuge in a refrigerated ultracentrifuge Optima XPN-100 with a swinging bucket SW 32 Ti rotor at 45,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C.Collect the turbid mitochondria-containing interphase with a pipette.Combine the interphases from the four tubes in a polycarbonate 50 mL bottle, dilute them with 30 mL of buffer A, and pellet the mitochondria again at 21,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C.Carefully pipette out the supernatant.Gently but thoroughly resuspend the mitochondrial pellet in 800 μL of buffer A. Critical:  The suspension of mitochondria should be homogeneous. Save 500 μL of the suspension for a CoLoC-seq experiment (section B) and reserve the other 300 μL for a Mock CoLoC-seq experiment (section D). Keep them on ice.CoLoC procedure All procedures are carried out at 4 °C with pre-chilled solutions and tubes, unless specified differently; all centrifugations are performed in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge for 2 mL tubes.Measure protein concentration in the sample for the CoLoC-seq experiment by Bradford assay.Note: The spectrophotometer should be calibrated for the Bradford assay, following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "To this end, one typically uses a series of bovine serum albumin solutions containing 1–10 μg of protein. Dissolve 2 μL of the mitochondrial suspension in 40 μL of 6% NaOH. For the blank, use 2 μL of buffer A.Add 760 μL of MilliQ water and mix thoroughly.Add 200 μL of the Bradford solution, mix well, and transfer the suspension to a disposable plastic spectrophotometer cuvette.After 60 s of incubation at room temperature, read the blank OD at 595 nm. Then read the mitochondrial protein sample OD at the same wavelength and determine its protein concentration using the standard curve. From 2,500 cm2 of nearly confluent HEK293 cells, one typically obtains 5–10 mg of crude mitochondria.Adjust the mitochondrial suspension to 1.6 mg of protein per millilitre using buffer A.Split the resulting suspension of mitochondria in a series of identical 80 μL samples. Ten samples must be sufficient to create an informative RNA depletion curve.Prepare two series of 80 μL RNase A dilutions in buffer D with concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 μg/mL (e.g., 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.0, 2.6, 3.2, 4.0, and 6.0 μg/mL). Use one series for the CoLoC and the other for the Mock CoLoC procedure.Pre-warm the RNase A dilutions on water bath at 25 °C for 1 min.Mix the 80 μL mitochondrial samples with the corresponding 80 μL RNase A dilutions and incubate on water bath at 25 °C for 10 min.Dilute the reactions with ice-cold buffer E to 1.6 mL.Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the pellets thoroughly in 100 μL of buffer F.RNA extraction Caution:  RNA extraction should be performed in a fume hood and with personal protection.Add 1 mL of TRIzol and shake samples for 10 s (do not vortex).",
    "Pause point:  Once TRIzol is added to the samples, they can be stored at -80 °C; otherwise, proceed to step C2.Note: TRIzol is stored at 2–25 °C; however, it should be warmed up to room temperature before use. Incubate samples for 5 min at room temperature.Add 0.2 mL of chloroform and cap the tubes securely.Shake the tubes vigorously by hand for 15 s.Incubate for 3 min at room temperature.Centrifuge the samples at 14,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Carefully transfer the upper aqueous phase containing RNA to a new tube by angling the tube at ~45° and pipetting the solution out with a P200 micropipette. Critical:  Take up the aqueous phase as completely as possible but avoid touching the protein-containing interphase. Contamination of RNA samples with protein may result in low-quality and/or artefactually degraded RNA.Add 2 μL of 20 μg/μL glycogen to the samples to facilitate RNA precipitation.Add 0.5 mL of isopropanol to the samples and mix thoroughly.Let the RNA precipitate at -20 °C for 1 h. Pause point:  The samples can be stored at -80 °C.Centrifuge at 14,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. Carefully decant the supernatant into a clean tube.Note: RNA pellets sometimes do not stick well to the tube wall. Decanting the supernatant to another tube prevents the pellet loss; if needed, simply transfer the supernatant with the floating pellet back and repeat the centrifugation. Wash the pellet with 0.5 mL of 80% ethanol.Centrifuge at 14,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant as previously.Wash the pellet with 0.5 mL of 100% ethanol.Centrifuge at 14,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Decant the supernatant, as previously. Dry the pellets by leaving the tubes open on the bench for 5–10 min.Fully dissolve RNA in 45 μL of RNase-free water.",
    "Pause point:  Samples of isolated RNA can be stored at -80 °C.Mix each sample of extracted RNA with 90 ng of a spike-in transcript to enable subsequent data normalization.Add to each sample 5 μL of the 10× DNase I reaction buffer, 1 U of DNase I, and 20 U of SUPERase•In. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C to digest residual DNA.Re-extract RNA with TRIzol, as described in steps C1–C7. Precipitate it, as in steps C9–C16.Note: No further glycogen addition is required, since the previously added glycogen partitions with RNA during extraction. Re-dissolve the RNA pellet in 20 μL of RNase-free water. Measure RNA concentration in each sample with NanoDrop. Expected RNA concentrations are in the range of 50–200 ng/μL. Pause point:  RNA samples can be stored at -80 °C.Mock CoLoC procedure Mix 300 μL of the reserved crude mitochondrial extract from step A2n with 300 μL of ice-cold buffer H.Lyse the mitochondria on ice with 50 strokes in a small Dounce homogenizer.Clear the lysate by centrifugation at 16,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Note: The remaining pellet must be relatively small, and the supernatant must be of yellow-to-brown colour, indicating good solubilisation of the mitochondrial contents. If the pellet is still big and the supernatant is colourless, repeat the lysis adding more buffer H. Repeat step D3 to remove any remaining insoluble material.Measure protein concentration in the cleared lysate by Bradford assay, as described in step B1.Adjust the lysate to protein concentration of 1.6 mg/mL with ice-cold buffer A.Split the resulting solution in a series of identical 80 μL samples in 2 mL tubes.Perform RNase treatment in the same way as for the regular CoLoC procedure (steps B4–B6).Centrifuge the reactions at 16,000× g for 40 min at 4 °C.Add 1.",
    "44 mL of TRIzol. Pause point:  The samples can be stored at -80 °C. Otherwise, proceed to step D11.Incubate the samples at room temperature for 5 min. Add 320 μL of chloroform and extract RNA, as described in steps C4–C21.Northern blotting Caution:  Work with radioactive material in a specially equipped lab using personal protection.Note: While the northern blotting protocol described here is based on radioactive probes, viable non-radioactive alternatives also exist, e.g., irNorthern, using near-infrared fluorescence (Miller et al., 2018), and digoxigenin-labelled probes, exploiting western-like chemiluminescence detection (Höltke et al., 1992). Take 1 μg of the 0 RNA sample (treated with 0 μg/mL RNase A). Take the same volume of all remaining samples in a series. (For example, if the 0 sample has the RNA concentration of 200 ng/μL, you should take 5 μL of each sample in this series, independently of the RNA concentration of the other samples.) (Note: RNA yield naturally decreases in samples treated with higher RNase A concentrations. Keeping the same volume fraction enables correct dosage for all samples of a series. Measuring the level of the spike-in RNA will further ensure equal sample loading.) Mix the RNA 1:1 (by volume) with RNA loading buffer. Caution:  The RNA loading buffer contains formamide and should be manipulated under the hood.Prepare a big (15–20 cm) and thick (1.5 mm) 6% RNA denaturing polyacrylamide gel by polymerising the gel solution by addition of 1/100 volume of 10% ammonium persulfate and 1/1,000 volume of TEMED.Denature the samples at 95 °C for 5 min in a block heater.Install the gel slot in the electrophoresis chamber and add a sufficient amount of 1× TBE buffer.Just before loading the samples, thoroughly wash the pockets from urea 10 times by vigorous pipetting with a P1000 pipette.",
    "Keep the samples on the bench for 1 min and load them immediately after the last wash of the pockets on the gel using a smoothly going pipette with a long thin tip.Note: It is important to load the sample firmly and quickly on the very bottom of the well, avoiding spurts and bubbles. Close the chamber and run the gel at 10 V/cm and 30 mA until bromophenol blue is approximately 3 cm from the bottom.Carefully disassemble the sandwich. Stain the gel in 200 mL of 0.0001% ethidium bromide for 5 min. Visualise the ethidium fluorescence and record the resulting image with the help of a suitable UV-based gel documentation system.Note: Minimise exposure of the gel to UV light to avoid RNA crosslinking. Assemble a northern blot sandwich according to manufacturer’s instructions for a wet transfer tank. For example, use three sheets of Whatman paper with dimensions matching those of the gel. Moisten them with 0.5× TBE and apply them one upon the other, atop the sponge on the anode (+) side of the cassette. After each sheet, use a roller to gently chase air bubbles from the sandwich. Then, apply a Hybond-N+ membrane for nucleic acids transfer (moistened in 0.5× TBE) atop the Whatman sheets. Then, carefully place the gel on the membrane and cover it with three more moistened Whatman sheets. Close the sandwich.Place the cassette in the corresponding wet transfer chamber filled with cold, freshly prepared TBE 0.5× buffer and perform transfer at 75 V and up to 3 A for 1.5 h in a cold room, with gentle magnet stirring.Note: While 1.5 h is generally enough for a complete transfer, this step can be prolonged up to 3 h, at the experimenter’s convenience.",
    "Disassemble the sandwich and air dry the membrane on a sheet of absorbing paper. Crosslink RNA to the membrane for 3 min in Hoefer UVC 500 Ultraviolet Crosslinker. Pause point:  The dry membrane can be stored at 4 °C.Place the membrane in a hybridisation glass tube, add 20 mL of pre-hybridisation buffer, and incubate in a slowly rotating hybridisation oven for 30 min at 65 °C. Make sure that the membrane is uniformly unfolded in the tube and does not fold back on itself (if this happens, simply invert the tube), and that all areas subject to hybridisation are in maximally identical conditions and uniformly covered with the liquid.Replace the pre-hybridisation buffer with the hybridisation buffer and add 3–5 μL of the purified labelled probe.Note: For 5′-[32P]-oligonucleotide labelling, see section F. Incubate the membrane with the probe for at least 2 h (normally, over day or overnight) at 42 °C with continuous rotation in the hybridisation oven.Note: If the probed transcript is of low abundance, the amount of the probe can be increased. If the probe is long or highly structured, it should be denatured and put on ice, as described in step F1, prior to its addition to hybridisation buffer. If the probe is very long (> 40 nt), it is recommended to increase the incubation temperature to 50–60 °C to avoid non-specific hybridisation. The optimal hybridisation temperature can be adjusted for each oligo individually, with 42 °C performing well for most probes. To wash the blot, discard the hybridisation mix to a dedicated radioactive waste container, add 20 mL of the washing buffer, and rotate the tube in the hybridisation oven for 15 min at the same temperature. Caution:  Do not discard radioactive solutions in the sink.Discard the washing buffer in a dedicated radioactive waste container.",
    "Remove the membrane from the glass tube.Dry the membrane on a sheet of absorbing paper on the bench. Seal it in a plastic film.Expose the membrane overnight (or longer, up to a week, if the signal is expected to be weak) with a phosphorimager plate in an appropriate cassette. Shorter expositions are only needed if the signal is very strong (measurable with a portable counter) and becomes quickly saturated.Scan the phosphorimager plate on Typhoon or a similar device using appropriate instrument settings.Erase the residual signal from the plate with a light eraser.Note: The phosphorimager plate bleaching is also recommended immediately before exposition (step E18) to reduce background. To remove the previous probe for further hybridisations, rotate the membrane in a glass tube in the hybridisation oven in 20–30 mL of stripping buffer for 30 min at 63–65 °C. If the probe is very long and/or the signal is strong, remove it by rocking the membrane with an excess of stripping buffer in a water bath at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, proceed with the next hybridisation from step E13.Oligonucleotide labelling Caution:  Work with radioactive material in a specially equipped lab using personal protection.Prepare a 20 μL labelling reaction by mixing 13 μL of water, 1 μL of a 10 μM solution of the DNA oligonucleotide to label, 2 μL of 10× PNK buffer, 3 μL of [32P]-γ-ATP, and 1 μL of PNK.Note: If the probed transcript is very abundant, one can take 1 μL of [32P]-γ-ATP and 15 μL of water instead (the rest of the mix will be the same).",
    "If the probe is very long (> 40 nt) or highly structured, mix 13 μL of water and 1 μL of a 10 μM solution of the DNA oligo and denature it at 95 °C for 1 min, then immediately put on ice for 1 min and quickly add the remaining components of the labelling mix, as described above. This usually increases labelling efficiency. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 30 min to 1 h. Caution:  Shield the heating block with a Plexiglas screen to protect yourself and others from exposure to radioactivity.Oligonucleotide purification:Briefly vortex a Micro Bio-spin P-6 chromatography column.Shake the drops down, break the bottom plug off, and insert the column in the corresponding collecting tube.Open the upper lid, close it again to push air bubbles through, and open once again.Let the liquid in the column drop out by gravity flow for 3–4 min on the bench. Discard the flow-through.Centrifuge the column with the collecting tube at 1,000× g in a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature for 2 min.Discard the collecting tube.Carefully, without touching the resin, apply the labelling solution to the column and insert it in a clean 1.5 mL collection tube.Centrifuge at 1,000× g in a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature for 4 min. One should normally obtain approximately 20 μL of clean labelled probe. Critical:  Depending on the supplier, [32P]-γ-ATP solutions sometimes contain a colorant to facilitate their tracking. This one should stay on the column. In the case where the eluate is still coloured, repeat the procedure with another column.Measure the probe solution with a portable counter: it should normally be over the scale and beep.Note: Store the labelled oligonucleotide at -20 °C in a dedicated freezer in the radioactivity lab.",
    "Before each use, verify with a portable counter that the probe is still sufficiently radioactive. Library preparation & RNA-seq Note: cDNA library preparation and RNA-seq can be outsourced. In Jeandard et al. (2023), Figure S2 shows the key library preparation steps that ensure the selective sequencing of intact transcripts, as briefly summarised below. Remove caps with RNA 5′-pyrophosphohydrolase.Ligate the 5′-adapter to 5′-phosphorylated ends.Ligate the 3′-adapter to 3′-hydroxyl ends.Perform the first-strand cDNA synthesis using M-MLV reverse transcriptase with a 3′-adapter-annealing primer.PCR-amplify the resulting cDNA with a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and barcoded TruSeq primers (15 cycles).Purify cDNA with the AMPure XP kit.Perform cDNA fragmentation and end repairing and proceed with another round of adapter ligation and PCR amplification.Pool the cDNA samples equimolarly and perform size-selection on an agarose gel in the range 10–220 nt (excluding the flanking sequences).Sequence the pool on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (75 nt single-end reads) or similar.Note: Although the fragmentation step may be expected to destroy the strand-specificity of the protocol, our mapping results (Jeandard et al., 2023) showed that the first 5′-adapter ligation (step G2) largely determines the strandedness of the reads, which permits unambiguous transcript assignment and quantification. Other strategies to enforce the preservation of the strand information can also be implemented (J. Z. Levin et al., 2010; Dar et al., 2016)."
