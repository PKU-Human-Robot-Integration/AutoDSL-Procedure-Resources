    "1. Preparation of solutions\nPrepare the PVA stock solution in advance by heating the PVA solution in a 80 °C water bath and subsequently placing it in the refrigerator at 4 °C. Cool to room temperature (RT) for experimental usage.\nPrepare the emulsion-precursor by adding the aqueous gelatin solution (1 mL, 7.5%, w/v) to the organic phase of PLGA (2 mL, 2%, w/v in dichloromethane, DCM) (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: Generally, microfluidic technology involves different phases to form the microspheres. The continuous or collecting phase comprises an aqueous poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 600 mL, 1%, w/v).\n2. Droplet microfluidic device assembly and fabrication of PLGA-HOPMs\nNOTE: The consumable items required for this assembly are listed in the Table of Materials.\nCustomize the droplet generator assembly.\n\t\nConstruct a co-flow microfluidic generator using a glass capillary (OD, 1 mm), PVC tubes (ID, 1 mm), and a 26 G dispensing needle.\nConnect the glass capillary to the end of the PVC tube and then pierce with a needle at the connection of the above structure.\nPlace the other end of the PVC tube in the continuous phase during the droplet generation. Using UV glue, seal the gaps at the joint after curing.\n\t\tNOTE: The needle needs to be bent curved about 45° for convenient piercing at the PVC tube, and the needlepoint stretched into the capillary tube to form the coaxial structure.\nPrepare the droplet microfluidic platform.\n\t\nUse two syringe pumps, as shown in Figure 1. Use a 50 mL syringe to load the continuous phase and a 5 mL syringe for emulsion formation.\nSet the flow rates of the continuous and dispersion phases at 2 mL/min and 0.08 mL/min, respectively.\nPlace a 500 mL beaker in an ice bath and fill it with a pre-cooled PVA aqueous solution (step 1.1).",
    "NOTE: The end of the glass capillary must be immersed in the collecting phase. It is suggested to stir (1 h, 60 rpm) the supernatant of the collecting phase with the glass rod after the emulsion-droplets formation in the platform. Emulsion droplets are produced at the tip of the needlepoint. In general, the gauge of the needle influences the size of PMs, in which the lesser gauge corresponds to the smaller size of PMs. Moreover, the pore diameter is mainly correlated to the porogen concentration, capable of increasing with appropriate gelatin concentration1.\nPerform the emulsification and droplet generation.\n\t\nPrepare the emulsion following the steps below.\n\t\t\nPrepare the emulsion by immediately decanting the aqueous gelatin solution into the DCM solution of PLGA (step 1.2) and emulsifying using the ultrasonic device (see Table of Materials).\nAdjust the ultrasonic power to 400 W, and set the total processing time as 90 s (interval 2 s, ultrasonic treatment 1 s), accompanied by constantly changing the probe's position manually.\nStabilize the resultant emulsion for syringe suction and droplet generation in approximately 20 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Place the probe of the ultrasonic cell breaker in the oil-water interface. It is suggested not to let the ultrasonic probe contact the container.\nPerform the droplet generation.\n\t\t\nLoad the prepared emulsion (step 2.3.1) rapidly in the 5 mL syringe of the microfluidic platform after ultrasonic treatment.\nIntroduce the unstable W/O emulsion (which is in the course of phase-separation) into the microfluidic device as the discontinuous phase. At the same time, use the aqueous solution of PVA as the continuous phase.\nCollect the microspheres containing the emulsion at the bottom of the collecting beaker (PVA, 1%, w/v) after injecting proper portions of the emulsion into the microfluidic device.\nPlace the sample at 4 °C overnight for further stabilization.",
    "Rinse and lyophilize the prepared microspheres (PLGA-HOPMs) following the steps below.\n\t\t​NOTE: The generated PLGA-HOPMs contain arbitrary pores on the interior and surface.\n\t\t\nStore the microspheres at 4 °C before normalizing to RT and stir by a glass rod (1 h, 60 rpm) to eliminate the residual DCM.\nFiltrate the collecting phase in the 500 mL beaker carefully, and wash the collected microspheres thrice with deionized water to wash off the residual PVA on the surface of PMs.\nPlace the PLGA microspheres in the 37 °C water bath for 30 min to dissolve the gelatin wrapped in the PLGA backbone.\nRinse the resultant PLGA-HOPMs twice with the deionized water to remove the residual gelatin and pre-cool for lyophilization at -80 °C for 24 h.\nStore the dry PLGA-HOPMs at -20 °C for further experiments.\n3. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging\nDeposit PLGA-HOPMs on the sample stage of SEM (see Table of Materials) at RT and put the sample stage into the sputter cell of the magnetron sputter. Switch on the transformer and magnetron one by one. Introduce the sample to the SEM after being sputter-coated with gold for 1 min.\nObtain the SEM images by setting the acceleration voltage at 5 kV.\nAdditionally, quantify the particle size of PLGA-HOPMs using 100 PMs at the variable field of SEM imaging. Measure the representative result to quantify the pore size distribution.\n\t\nOpen the graphics with Image J and use the \"straight line\" to match the scale bar of the SEM image, which makes the software identify pixel to length.\nClick on analyze > set scale, set the \"known distance\" to the scale bar of the SEM image, and click on global > OK.",
    "Click on analyze > Tools > ROI manager... to measure the pore or particle size of PLGA PMs and click on add it. Measure the number of samples based on the requirement.\nClick on Measure to obtain the quantitative data of the graphics for further calculation.\n4. Cell culture and fluorescence imaging\nNOTE: Rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were used for the present work. The cells were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\nCulture the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with L-glutamine (DMEM/F-12), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPassage the rat BMSCs in a 1:2 ratio after reaching 90% of confluence.\nPerform cell adhesion following the steps below.\n\t\nIncubate the PLGA-HOPMs with ethyl alcohol (5 mL, 70%, v/v) and centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min at RT to sterilize.\nWash the sterilized PLGA-HOPMs twice with phosphate buffer solution.\nIncubate the HOPMs (five in number) with the cell suspension (5 mL, 1 x 105 cells/mL) in a sterile centrifuge tube (50 mL) under dynamic culture for BMSCs adhesion to PLGA-HOPMs.\nPerform the dynamic culture in a thermostatic aseptic shaker (37 °C, 90 rpm) by placing a sealed 50 mL centrifuge tube in the shaker (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The dynamic culture intends to enhance the adherence rate of BMSCs on the scaffolds, rather than directly incubating the PMs and cells onto the plastic plate. The cells and PLGA PMs are added into a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube, incubating the tube at a thermostatic aseptic shaker (37 °C, 90 rpm) and changing the media every 2 days.\nPerform the live and dead dual-stain assay.\n\t\nRinse the cell-laden PMs thrice for eluting BMSCs without attachment to PLGA-HOPMs.",
    "Place the cell-laden PMs on the 35 mm glass-bottom plate. Add 1 mL of staining buffer (see Table of Materials), including 1 µL of calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI), respectively, to the PBS-prewashed sample.\nAssess the samples by confocal laser scanning microscopy (see Table of Materials). Switch on the excitation light of 488 nm and 552 nm at the corresponding detector. For z-overlay analysis, set the z-wide to capture the different layers of the sample by z-axis movement of the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: It is worth noting that the other stains can be appropriately employed for analysis.\nSubscription Required.
