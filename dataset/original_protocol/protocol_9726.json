    "The procedure for harvesting human mandibular bone specimens was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Stomatology, the Fourth Military Medical University. The study followed the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All donors for the present study were informed of the possible risks and the study objectives. The age of the donors ranged between 18-40 years, and there was no gender bias. Written consent was obtained from all the human participants.\n1. Surgery preparation\nSelect the appropriate donor.\n\t\nSelect the patients as donors who plan to undergo surgeries such as mandibular setback following sagittal split ramus osteotomy and mandibular angle reduction plasty.\nPrepare the preservation solution.\n\t\nSupplement 30 mL of phosphate buffer saline (1x PBS) with 1% penicillin and streptomycin in a sterile and enzyme-free 50 mL centrifuge tube on the day before surgery. Store it in a refrigerator at 4 °C.\nOn the day of surgery, put the centrifuge tube with preservation solution in an icebox and keep it in the operating room 1 h before the surgery.\nSterilize the instruments to isolate the bone marrow on the day before surgery, including scissors, tweezers, and knives at 120 °C and 0.27 MPa pressure for 20 min.\nPrepare α-MEM culture medium by mixing minimum essential medium alpha (α-MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.\nPrepare an osteogenic differentiation medium by mixing α-MEM culture medium with 50 mM ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate, and 0.1 mM dexamethasone (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare adipogenic differentiation medium A by mixing α-MEM culture medium with 1 mM dexamethasone, 0.2 mM indomethacin, 10 µg/mL of insulin, and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare adipogenic differentiation medium B by mixing α-MEM culture medium with 10 µg/mL of insulin.",
    "Prepare chondrogenic differentiation medium by mixing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (HG-DMEM) and 100 nM of dexamethasone, 100 g/mL of sodium pyruvate, 25 mg/mL of vitamin C, 40 mg/mL of proline, 10 ng/mL of TGF-β3, and 1% of ITS (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: The osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation medium can be prepared in-house, as mentioned above. However, commercially available kits for the same were used (see Table of Materials) in the present study.\n2. Harvesting human mandibular bone specimen\nBefore surgery, carefully study the three-dimensional computerized tomographic scan images and surgical simulation planning of the donors (Figure 1).\nSelect the mandibular site that the donor plans to remove in surgery and is rich in cancellous bone with bone marrow as the donor site.\nDisinfect and drape the patient before operating.\nResect the selected donor site of the mandible using the ultrasonic osteotome blade (see Table of Materials), avoiding inferior alveolar nerve injury and donor bone impairment.\nPut the mandibular bone specimens into the preservation solution (step 1.2) as soon as possible.\nPlace the preservation solution with bone specimens in an icebox until the isolation of MSCs starts in the laboratory.\n\t​NOTE: The isolation of MSCs needs to be started as soon as possible after harvesting to preserve the viability of the cells. If the isolation of MSCs cannot be conducted immediately, the preservation solution with bone specimens can be stored in an icebox or refrigerated at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 h.\n3. Isolation and cultivation of human mBMSCs\nGet the bone specimens out of the preservation solution and dip them in 1x PBS with 1% penicillin and streptomycin for 5 min on a clean bench of the laminar flow cabinet.",
    "NOTE: This step aims to wash away the blood clot and residual oral fluids and further eliminate the microorganism because the mouth is not a completely sterile environment. Before cell isolation and cultivation, wash and disinfect hands with alcohol and wear disposable sterile gloves and masks.\nClean the adherent soft tissue and blood blot on the bone surface using sterile wet gauze.\nFill a 6 cm sterile culture dish with 5 mL of α-MEM culture medium.\nPut the bone into the sterile culture dish and cut it into small pieces (almost 2-3 mm3 volume) with a sterilized knife or scissor.\n\tNOTE: Hold the bone specimens with tweezers to avoid a finger cut.\nAspirate α-MEM culture medium in the culture dish with a 1 mL disposable sterile syringe.\nInsert the syringe needle with α-MEM culture medium deep into the bone marrow cavity of the cancellous bone specimen pieces.\nFlush the bone marrow into the culture dish with the syringe from all sides of the bone specimen pieces, at least 5-10 times per side.\nRepeat steps 3.5-3.7 until all the bone specimen pieces turn pure white to ensure that as much bone marrow is flushed into the culture medium.\n\tNOTE: The total operation time of the above steps from 3.1-3.8 needs to be controlled within 30 min on ice.\nRemove and discard all the bone specimen pieces with tweezers. Remove other small fragments using a cell filter with 70 µm pore size.\nShake the culture dish softly to make the flushed cells evenly distributed.\nPlace the culture dish into a cell incubator and culture the cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.",
    "On the third day of culture, check the cell morphology and growth status under a light microscope. Remove half of the culture medium with no adherent cells and tissue fragment; add 3 mL of fresh α-MEM culture medium.\nAt culture day 7, remove all the culture medium and add 5 mL of fresh α-MEM culture medium.\nThen, refresh the α-MEM culture medium every 3 days.\nCheck the cell morphology and growth every day.\n\t​NOTE: When the primary cell cultures (P0) reach 70%-80% confluence after 7-10 days of culture, carry out the cell passage.\n4. Cell passage\nAt 70%-80% confluence, remove all the culture medium of P0 cells. Wash the culture dish gently with 1x PBS twice to clean the residual culture medium.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin with 0.02% EDTA to the culture dish to digest the cells. Shake the culture dish softly to ensure that the trypsin is evenly distributed. Place the culture dish at 37 °C for 3 min.\nCheck the cells under the microscope. When 70%-80% of the cells get contracted and rounded, add 2 mL of α-MEM culture medium to stop the digestive reaction.\nGently blow the dish surface several times with a pipette to blow down the cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with α-MEM culture medium. Seed P0 cells in culture flasks (25 cm) for expansion with a 1:2 splitting ratio. The first passage cells were called P1 cells.\nWhen the P1 cells reach 70%-80% confluence, repeat the cell passage following steps from 4.1-4.6. The second-generation cells were called P2 cells.\nChange the expansion splitting ratio to 1:3 after the third generation cell passage.",
    "Use P3 to P5 cells to conduct identification experiments.\n5. Flow cytometric analysis\nDigest P3 to P5 MSCs using 0.25% trypsin with 0.02% EDTA, following steps 4.1-4.5.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1x PBS at a 1 x 106 cells/mL concentration.\nTransfer the cells into microcentrifuge tubes with 100 µL of the cell suspension per tube.\nAdd immunolabeled mouse monoclonal anti-human antibodies into the microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibody against CD45, fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody against CD90, CD34, and CD44 were used4,11 (see Table of Materials), and the dilutions of the antibodies were all 1:100. The dilutions of antibodies need to follow the manufacturer's instructions. PBS will be served as control.\nIncubate the antibodies and PBS control at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the suspension and resuspend the cells in 0.5 mL of 1x PBS. Repeat this step twice.\nLoad the tubes into the flow cytometer (see Table of Materials). Count the fluorescence-labeled cell numbers using a flow cytometer with a minimum of 10,000 events.\n\t​NOTE: It is better to start the flow cytometer cell count process immediately after the immunofluorescence labeling procedure. If not, the cells need to be fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, stored at 4 °C in the dark, and finish the process within 24 h.\n6. Cell proliferation assay\nUse P3 cells to perform the cell proliferation assay. Digest P3 MSCs with 0.25% trypsin, following steps 4.1-4.5.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with α-MEM culture medium.",
    "Count the cell number with a hemocytometer, and seed the cells on 96-well culture plates at a density of 3 x 103 cells per well, a total of 35 wells, 5 wells for each counting day (at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Refresh the culture medium of cells every 3 days.\nAt each counting day, discard α-MEM culture medium of the certain five wells for the certain counting day, and then add 100 µL of culture medium and 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (see Table of Materials). Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPlace the culture plates in a microplate spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials) and measure the optical density value of five wells for each counting day (a total 7 counting days) at a wavelength of 450 nm. Use five wells of the culture medium without cells as blanks.\nRecord the optical density value of every well, calculate the average value and standard deviation of five wells for each counting day, and plot the cell growth curve5,12.\n7. Multilineage differentiation\nPerform osteogenic differentiation induction following the steps below.\n\t\nDigest the P3 cells with trypsin following steps 4.1-4.5. Seed the cells at 2 x 105 cells/cm2 in a 6-well plate. Add 2.5 mL of α-MEM culture medium per well.\nWhen the cells reach 60%-70% confluence, change the culture medium into the osteogenic induction medium (step 1.5). Then, change the induction medium every 3 days.\nCheck the cells under a microscope every 3 days after induction. Observe the cell morphology and seek for obvious mineralization nodes.\nAfter 7 days of induction, perform the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining to evaluate the calcification of cells.",
    "Use 1x PBS to wash the cells twice gently. Add 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the cells at room temperature for 30 min. Then, use 1x PBS to wash the cells twice.\nAdd ALP staining solution (see Table of Materials) and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Different kinds of ALP staining solution can stain the cells with different colors, such as dark gray, red, and blue. In this protocol, the cells were stained blue. The incubation time can be prolonged if the staining color is not obvious. Some ALP solution staining kits may be poisonous; read the instructions carefully before use, wear gloves and a mask during the experiment, and wash hands carefully after use.\nWash the cells with water to stop the ALP staining reaction. Observe blue pigmented granules in the cells under a light microscope and capture the photos. Use the Image J software to quantitatively analyze the staining degree.\nPerform alizarin red staining (see Table of Materials) to evaluate the mineralization capacity of the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Obvious mineralization nodes formation of the differentiated cells usually can be seen after 21 days of induction.\nUse 1x PBS to wash the cells twice gently. Then, add 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the cells at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash the cells with 1x PBS twice, add 0.1% alizarin red staining solution (see Table of Materials) and incubate for 20 min. Again, wash the cells with 1x PBS twice.\nObserve the red nodules among fixed cells under a light microscope, indicating calcium deposits of osteogenic differentiation of cultured cells, and capture the photos.\nTo quantify the amount of alizarin red, add 10% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC, see Table of Materials) to the alizarin red-stained cells and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "Aspirate 50 µL of the CPC solution and measure the optical density (OD) at a wavelength of 540 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer.\nPerform adipogenic differentiation induction.\n\t\nSeed the P3 cells in a 6-well plate using the procedure described above (step 7.1).\nWhen the cells get 80%-90% confluence, change the culture medium into adipogenic differentiation medium A (step 1.6).\nIncubate the cells with adipogenic differentiation medium A at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nChange the induction medium to adipogenic differentiation medium B (step 1.7), and incubate for 1 day.\nChange the medium back to adipogenic differentiation medium A and incubate for 3 days. Then, replace with medium B for 1 day. Repeat this cycle 3-5 times until lipid droplets can be seen under the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The lipid droplets can be seen approximately 21 days after induction.\nUse the adipogenic differentiation medium B to culture the cells for an additional 7 days; then, big and round lipid droplets can be seen under the microscope. Refresh the medium B every 3 days.\nRemove the induction medium and use 1x PBS to wash the cells gently. Then, add 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the cells at room temperature for 10 min.\nWash the cells with 1x PBS twice; then, incubate the cells with oil red O staining solution (1 mL per well, see Table of Materials) for 15 min. Again, wash the cells with 1x PBS twice.\nPlace the cells under a microscope, and observe the red lipid droplets to evaluate the adipogenesis of differentiated cells.\nPerform chondrogenic differentiation induction.\n\t\nDigest and transfer the P3 cells into a 15 mL centrifuge tube with cell numbers of 5 x 105.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 250 x g for 4 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant by carefully decanting the top solution.\nAdd 0.5 mL of chondrogenic differentiation medium (step 1.8) into the tube to resuspend the cells, and centrifuge the tube again at 150 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat this step twice.\nLoosen the centrifuge tube cap to facilitate air exchange. Place the tube into the incubator and induce the cells with 0.5 mL of chondrogenic differentiation medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nKeep the centrifuge tube stable without removing or shaking it within 24 or 48 h, until the cells start pelleting. Flick the centrifuge tube bottom to suspend the cell pellet in the differentiation medium (step 1.5).\nRenew the chondrogenic differentiation medium with a pipette every 3 days. Avoid aspirating away the cell pellet.\nInduce the cells at least for 21 days until the pellet accretes to a 2 mm diameter.\nWash the pellet with 1x PBS, and fix it with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After dehydration and paraffin embedding13, section the pellet with a thickness of 3 µm using a microtome (see Table of Materials).\nPut the sections on glass slides. Stain the slides with Alcian blue solution (see Table of Materials) for 1 h at 37 °C. Wash the stained slides with water. Place the slides under a light microscope and capture photos of the blue-stained acid mucopolysaccharide indicating cartilage tissues."
