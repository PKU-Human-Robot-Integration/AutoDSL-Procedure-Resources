    "Note: Ensure that all safety instructions for the handling of hazardous compounds and for waste management are properly considered; since these may vary in different countries the following protocol does not provide any instruction on these issues.Part I. Nile red staining See Figure 3 for the outline of Nile red staining procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228191238_7125.jpgFigure 3. Flow chart the Nile red stainingNote: Nile red staining can be performed with cells taken either from cultures for gas chromatography analysis or from independent cultures prepared for microscopy experiments. Preparations of cellsInoculate a first seed culture of 10 ml NB medium (or of a culture medium that allows good growth of the species to investigate) with a single colony of R. eutropha H16 cells in a 100 ml flask and incubate the flask for 24 h on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C.Inoculate a second seed culture of 9 ml NB medium with 1 ml of the first seed culture (1:10 dilution) in a 100 ml flask. Incubate the cells for 24-30 h on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C. The procedure of two subsequent seed cultures on NB medium provides R. eutropha cells that are in the stationary growth phase as revealed by the presence of mainly short-rod-shaped or almost coccoid cells. Most of the cells (> 95%) have mobilized any previously accumulated PHB and the cells appear to be ‘empty’ after Nile red staining. Inoculate the main culture by transferring 1 ml of the second pre-culture to 9 ml of fresh NB medium (in a 100 ml flask) supplemented with 0.2% D-gluconic acid sodium salt (100 μl of 20% stock solution) and incubate the cells on a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C. Gluconate increases the C to N ratio of the medium and promotes accumulation of PHB.",
    "If different species are investigated other C-sources that a metabolized via acetyl-coenzyme A (precursor of PHB) may be added to promote the formation of PHB, e.g., acetate or glucose.Preparation of microscope slidesLabel the microscope slides.Prepare agarose pads by pipetting 100 µl of hot (~60 °C) agarose solution (1% [w/v] in H2O) on the slide and immediately place the cover slip on the agarose (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228191458_8552.jpgFigure 4. Preparation of an agarose pad for microscopyLet it solidify (≥ 2 min) and carefully remove the cover slip using a blade. Having removed the cover slip the sample should be applied within the next two minutes. Otherwise, the agar surface will become dry.Nile red staining of cellsTake samples every 2 h after inoculation of the main culture during the accumulation and mobilization phase of PHB. Remaining cells of the second pre-culture can be used as a negative control and represent the time point ‘0’ (T0). These cells (> 95%) should have no accumulated PHB. Alternatively, cells of R. eutropha PHB-4 can be used as a negative control for PHB granule accumulation. Due to a mutation in the PHB synthase gene cells of R. eutropha PHB-4 are unable to synthesize storage PHB (Raberg et al., 2014).Harvest 1 ml of culture by centrifugation (60 sec, 13,000 x g), discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the remaining ~30-50 µl medium that congregates from the tube walls at the bottom within ~1 min.Add 4 µl of cells to 1 µl of Nile red (working solution: 10 µg/ml in DMSO, light sensitive, stable for several months at 4 °C) in a reaction tube.Drop 1 or 2 µl of the stained cell suspension on the agarose pad, let it dry for a few seconds and carefully place the cover slip on the agarose.",
    "Microscopy analysisImage the samples using an appropriate fluorescence filter for Nile red (excitation: 562/40 nm, emission 594 (long pass), AHF Analysentechnik AG, Tübingen, Germany, www.ahf.de[href=http://www.ahf.de/]). Image the cells also under bright field.Analyze the pictures with the Nikon imaging software or ImageJ Fiji vl.50c.Part II. Determination of PHB content using gas chromatography See Figure 5 for the outline of the procedure to determine the PHB content using gas chromatography.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228191928_1040.jpgFigure 5. Flow chart of the determination of PHB content using gas chromatography Cultivation and harvesting of cellsThree independent colonies and cultures should be used for biological triplicates.Calculate the appropriate amount of culture volume depending on how many samples (data points) will be taken. 100 ml of culture is necessary for a data point when the culture has an OD600 ≤ 0.6. 50 ml of culture is necessary for a data point when the culture has an OD600 ≥ 0.6. We usually take a sample every 4 h over a period of 48 h. Inoculate the first seed cultures with 10 ml NB medium, the appropriate antibiotics if necessary and a colony of R. eutropha H16 cells and incubate it overnight in a shaker at 30 °C up to 24 h.Inoculate the second seed cultures with a dilution of 1:10 in NB medium and the appropriate antibiotics if necessary. Incubate it for at least 24-30 h in a shaker at 30 °C to get rid of all previously accumulated PHB. The culture should have a volume of at least 50 ml to have enough cells to harvest the T0 time point from the seed culture and to inoculate the main culture.Inoculate the main cultures with a dilution of 1:20 in NB medium, 0.2% sodium gluconate and the appropriate antibiotics if necessary and incubate it in a shaker at 30 °C.",
    "Take 50-100 ml samples every 4 h during the accumulation and mobilization phase of PHB. T0 is represented by the second pre culture. The volume of the main culture should be 50 ml higher than the sum of the volumes harvested for all data points. Harvest 50-100 ml of culture in 50 ml Falcon tubes by centrifugation for 20 min at 5,000 x g and 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and freeze the pellet for at least 2 h at -20 °C.Lyophilization and weighing of samplesIn order to freeze-dry the cell pellets, slightly open the lids of the Falcon tubes or use lids with a prepared hole.Place the Falcon tubes in the freeze-dryer and start the drying process by switching on the (rotary) vacuum pump. Freeze-dry the samples for at least 24 h. Lyophilization of the samples is finished when the cell pellets are dry. The absence of any residual water/moisture is important. Disrupt all cell pellets into small clumps using a spatula.Weigh approximately 10 mg of the freeze-dried cell pellets on an analytical balance into screw-capped culture tubes with chloroform resistant PTFE seal. If the size of the pellet is limited, it is possible to use fewer amounts of freeze-dried cells but the (mass) weight should always be between 5-10 mg. Note: It is important to determine the exact cell mass (weight) for later calculations.In order to generate a PHB calibration graph, weigh 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg of pure PHB into culture tubes with screw-caps, respectively.Acidic methanolysis and preparation of GC samples (Figure 6) Note: All steps should be performed in a fume hood. Add 1 ml of chloroform to the culture tubes.",
    "Add 1 ml of methanol supplemented with 15% (v/v) H2SO4 (150 μl H2SO4 + 850 μl methanol per sample) to the special culture tubes containing the weighted dried cells. Close the tubes tightly and vortex for three seconds. All pellet clumps should be in the solvent mixture.Incubate the tubes for 2 h 30 min at 100 °C in a thermostat-equipped oil bath. Follow the local safety instructions as the applied temperature is above the boiling point of methanol and chloroform. Intact sealing and the absence of any fissures in the glass tubes are essential.Cool down the samples on ice for 5 min.Add 1 ml of deionized water and 1 ml of chloroform containing 0.2% (v/v) methyl benzoate (2 μl methyl benzoate + 998 μl chloroform per sample) as an internal standard. Note: Use the same chloroform-methyl benzoate mixture for all samples to avoid dilution errors. Close the tubes tightly and vortex vigorously for 30 sec. Let the tubes stand for a minute to allow phase separation.Pipette 150 µl of the organic (bottom) phase into 0.3 ml limited volume inserts in GC glass vials. Close the screw cap of the GC vials.Prepare a GC vial with 150 µl pure chloroform as equilibration solvent for the column.Pipette 1 ml of pure chloroform and 1 ml of the chloroform methyl benzoate mixture into a culture tube to prepare an external standard. Transfer 150 µl of the mixture into a GC vial.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228192241_9141.jpgFigure 6. Images of the acidic methanolysis steps of PHB. Weighted cells (A), complete methanolysis sample before oil bath (B), sample after oil bath (C) and phase-separated sample with the bottom organic phase (white arrow, D).GC measurementPlace all GC vials in a GC tray.Refill all glass vials which are used to rinse the syringe three times between different samples with octane.",
    "Empty all waste vials. Set up the GC apparatus and the CTC automated sample injector according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer and install a gastight syringe as well as the appropriate liner.Use a DB-WAX column as stationary phase and the inert gas helium as mobile phase for the separation of the methyl esters. Program an injection volume of 1 µl, a split mode with a split ratio of 1:8 and an injection temperature of 250 °C.Program a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min.Program the following temperature gradient for the separation of the methyl esters:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228192344_2960.jpgDetection is performed with a flame ionization detector (FID) at 275 °C."
