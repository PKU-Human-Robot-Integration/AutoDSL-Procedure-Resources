    "Derivation and expansion of lung organoids PreparationPrepare basal medium (Recipe 1) and keep it on ice or at 4 °C.Prepare expansion medium (Recipe 2) and prewarm at 37 °C.Thaw matrigel at 4 °C and keep it on ice.Note: Matrigel will solidify at room temperature. Prewarm a 24-well suspension culture plate in a standard cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 and humidified atmosphere at 37 °C.Prepare glass Pasteur pipettes with a narrow opening (≤1 mm) by burning the tips with a flame, such as a Bunsen burner, to narrow the opening from ~1.5 to ≤1 mm. Cool down the Pasteur pipettes. Autoclave the Pasteur pipettes prior to use.Note: The burning procedure also aims to smoothen the sharp edge of the glass pipette and reduce cell damage. Any fine tip Pasteur pipette with a narrow opening (≤1 mm) and smooth edge can be used instead. Rinse the Pasteur pipettes with 2–3 mL of basal medium by pipetting up and down a few times to avoid excessive attachment of cells before using them to mechanically shear the organoids (i.e., steps A3e and B2e).Derivation of lung organoidsObtain freshly resected lung tissues from patients who underwent surgical operations due to various diseases. Transport the tissue in the cold basal medium (and preferably on ice at 4 °C) and process it as soon as possible.Note: The lung tissues/biopsies should be resected from the distal lung region, should be composed of normal tissues adjacent to diseased tissues (with both bronchioles and alveoli), and should be ~0.5 cm in diameter. Mince the tissue into small pieces (≤1 mm) with a sterile scalpel in a 100 mm cell culture dish. Wash the tissue pieces with 10 mL of cold basal medium and transfer them to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the tissue pieces in 8 mL of cold basal medium supplemented with collagenase at a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Digest the tissue pieces for 30–40 min at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm.Shear the digested tissue pieces by pipetting up and down 20 times using a 10 mL serological pipette. Filter the cell suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer.(Optional) Recover remaining tissue pieces from the cell strainer with cold basal medium and transfer them to a 15 mL centrifuge tube for a second round of mechanical shearing by pipetting and then filtering to increase the cell yield.Add FBS to the flowthrough with a final concentration of 2% to terminate enzymatic digestion. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.(Optional) Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of erythrocyte lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min at room temperature to remove the red blood cells.Wash the cells with 10 mL of cold basal medium. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in cold matrigel. Add 80–160 μL of matrigel for cells obtained from a lung tissue of size ~0.5 cm in diameter. Dispense 40 μL of the cell suspension to each well of a prewarmed 24-well suspension culture plate and incubate for 10–15 min at 37 °C in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator to let the matrigel droplet solidify.Add 500 μL of expansion medium to each well and incubate the plate in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator. Replenish the medium every 2–3 days with caution not to disrupt the matrigel droplets. Observe the organoids and monitor their growth under a light microscope regularly (Figure 1).",
    "Note: In the initial culture, there are non-epithelial cell types such as lung fibroblasts, which will gradually disappear after 2–3 passages. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4657/bioprotoc-13-08-4657-g001.jpgFigure 1. Derivation and expansion of lung organoids. (A). Top, a schematic graph outlines the derivation and expansion of lung organoids (LO) in expansion medium (Exp medium). Bottom, photomicrographs show growing lung organoids derived from isolated lung cells on day 0, 5, 9, 13, and 19. Scale bar = 500 μm. (B). Lung organoids were applied to immunofluorescence staining to label P63+ basal cells, FOXJ1+/ACCTUB+ ciliated cells, MUC5AC+ goblet cells, CC10+ club cells, and SFTPB+ AT2 cells (green). Nuclei and actin filaments were counterstained with DAPI (blue) and Phalloidin-647 (white), respectively. Scale bar = 20 μm.Expansion of lung organoidsPassage and split the lung organoids every 2–3 weeks.Disrupt the matrigel droplets by pipetting up and down the medium 10 times with a 1,000 μL pipette. Transfer the mixture to a 15 mL tube. Top up with cold basal medium to a total volume of 10 mL if several wells of organoids are harvested for passaging. Incubate the mixture on ice for 5 min. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Wash the organoids once with cold basal medium. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.(Optional) Resuspend the organoids in 1–2 mL of 10× TrypLE and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C to digest the organoids. Add FBS to the organoids with a final concentration of 2% to terminate enzymatic digestion (i.e., add 20 μL of FBS for 1 mL of 10× TrypLE).",
    "Note: Trypsinization is preferred when the mechanical shearing approach is inadequate to shear the lung organoid into small pieces or when the size of the organoids is highly variable, particularly when subsequent experimentations require organoids of a relatively uniform size. Shear the organoids into single cells and small cellular clusters by pipetting up and down 20–40 times with a Pasteur pipette.Check the sheared organoids under a light microscope to ensure organoid fragments are small enough (e.g., less than 10 cells). Repeat the mechanical shearing if necessary.Wash the cells with the cold basal medium. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in an estimated volume of cold matrigel, which enables a split of the organoids with a ratio of 1:2 to 1:10 based on organoid density in the original culture and the methods used for passage. We normally apply a ratio of 1:2 to 1:4 when passaging with mechanical shearing and 1:6 to 1:10 when passaging with enzymatic digestion.Note: The cell density should be approximately 2 × 104–4 × 104 cells in each 40 μL of matrigel. Dispense 40 μL of the cell suspension to each well of a prewarmed 24-well suspension culture plate and incubate for 10–15 min at 37 °C in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator to let the matrigel droplet solidify.Add 500 μL of expansion medium to each well and incubate the plate in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator. Replenish the medium every 2–3 days with caution not to disrupt the matrigel droplets.Note: The lung organoids can be passaged every 2–3 weeks for approximately one year (i.e., 16–24 passages). Distal differentiation of lung organoids to generate alveolar organoids PreparationPrepare distal differentiation medium (DD medium) (Recipe 3) and prewarm at 37 °C.",
    "Distal differentiation in suspension cultureCulture lung organoids in the expansion medium for 12–14 days to prepare sufficient organoids for differentiation culture (lung organoids from step A3j).Disrupt the matrigel droplets by pipetting up and down the medium 10 times with a 1,000 μL pipette. Transfer the mixture to a 15 mL tube. Top up with cold basal medium to a total volume of 10 mL if several wells of organoids are harvested for passaging. Incubate the mixture on ice for 5–10 min. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Note: Use cold basal medium (keep on ice) to wash the organoids and incubate them on ice to completely remove the matrigel. Residual matrigel may compromise the effect of subsequent suspension culture. Wash the organoids with cold basal medium. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the organoids in 1–2 mL of 10× TrypLE and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C to digest the organoids. Add FBS with a final concentration of 2% to terminate enzymatic digestion (i.e., add 20 μL of FBS for 1 mL of 10× TrypLE).Shear the organoids into single cells by pipetting up and down 20–40 times using a Pasteur pipette.Check under a light microscope to ensure the organoids are sheared into single cells. Repeat the mechanical shearing if necessary.Wash the cells with 10 mL of cold basal medium. Filter the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 1–10 mL of DD medium based on the estimated cell number. Count the number of cells with a hemocytometer under a microscope. Adjust the cell concentration to 2 × 105 per milliliter with DD medium.",
    "Dispense 500 μL of cell suspension (1 × 105 cells) to each well of a Nunclon Sphera 24-well suspension culture plate.Notes:  1) Approximately 2.4 × 106 cells are required for generating a plate of alveolar organoids in 24-well format. 2) Do not put too many cells in each well for suspension culture because cells may form aggregates if the density is too high, which may compromise alveolar differentiation. 3) Avoid scratching the bottom of the wells during pipetting, which may damage the super low cell attachment surface of the Nunclon Sphera culture plates. Incubate the cells in a standard cell culture incubator for 10–14 days for maturation (Figure 2). Directly add 100 μL of DD medium to each well every other day without removing the old medium, since evaporation reduces the volume of the medium during incubation. Evenly distribute the cells by gentle shaking before putting the plate back into the incubator.Notes:  1) Make sure to evenly distribute the cells; they may form aggregates if closely centered in the well, which may compromise alveolar differentiation. 2) Organoids with a lumen and thin wall are discernible under a microscope from day 3–4 after suspension cultured in DD medium. After 10 days of distal differentiation culture, the alveolar organoids are mature enough to simulate the native alveolar epithelium, which is applicable for subsequent experimental manipulation. 3) The thin and flat AT1 cells are delicate. Pipette gently to avoid disturbing the AT1 morphology during the differentiation culture and downstream procedures. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4657/bioprotoc-13-08-4657-g002.jpgFigure 2. Generation of alveolar organoids. (A). Top, a schematic graph outlines the distal differentiation protocol to generate alveolar organoids (AlvO) in distal differentiation medium (DD medium). Exp medium = expansion medium. Bottom, photomicrographs show single cell suspension on day 0 and mature alveolar organoids on day 14. Scale bar = 100 μm.",
    "(B). Alveolar organoids were applied to immunofluorescence staining to label AQP5+ AT1 cells (red) and SFTPB+/HTII-280+ AT2 cells (green). Nuclei and actin filaments were counterstained with DAPI (blue) and Phalloidin-647 (white), respectively. Scale bar = 20 μm.Proximal differentiation of lung organoids to generate optimized 2D airway organoids PreparationPrepare proximal differentiation medium (PD medium) (Recipe 4, no PIPES, pH 7.4) and prewarm at 37 °C.Prepare proximal differentiation medium (PD medium) (Recipe 4, with PIPES, pH 6.6) and prewarm at 37 °C.Pre-incubate the Transwell inserts with basal medium overnight in a standard cell culture incubator. For a 24-well insert, add 200 and 500 μL of basal medium to the top and bottom chamber, respectively.Proximal differentiation in Transwell insertsCulture lung organoids in the expansion medium for 12–14 days after passaging to prepare sufficient cells for differentiation culture (lung organoids from step A3j).Dissociate lung organoids into single cells according to steps B2b–B2g.Resuspend the pellet in 1–4 mL of expansion medium based on the cell number. Count the number of cells with a hemocytometer. Adjust the cell concentration to 1.3 × 106 per milliliter with expansion medium.Remove basal medium from the top and bottom chambers of the pre-incubated Transwell inserts. Seed 100 μL of cell suspension (1.3 × 105 cells) to the top chamber of 24-well inserts. Add 500 μL of expansion medium to the bottom chamber. Incubate the cells in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator for two days to let cells grow and attach.Note: Approximately 3.12 × 106 cells are required for generating a plate of 2D airway organoids in 24-well Transwell inserts. Replace the expansion medium with PD medium (pH 7.4) in both the top and bottom chambers. Incubate the cells in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator for two days to let cells reach confluence.",
    "Note: The 2D organoids reach confluence after changing from expansion medium to PD medium (pH 7.4) for 2–3 days. Replace the PD medium pH 7.4 with PD medium pH 6.6 in the top chamber, while keeping the PD medium pH 7.4 in the bottom chamber (i.e., pH 6.6/7.4 on top/bottom). Incubate the cells in a standard cell culture CO2 incubator for 10 days for maturation (Figure 3). Replenish the PD medium pH 6.6 in the top chamber and PD medium pH 7.4 in the bottom chamber every 2–3 days.Note: Motile beating cilia are normally discernible in the organoids under a light microscope from day 7 after differentiation in PD medium. After 14 days of proximal differentiation culture, the 2D airway organoids are ready for experimental manipulation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4657/bioprotoc-13-08-4657-g003.jpgFigure 3. Generation of optimized 2D airway organoids. (A). A schematic graph outlines the proximal differentiation protocol to generate 2D airway organoids (AwO) in proximal differentiation medium (PD medium) at different pH. Exp medium = expansion medium. (B). 2D optimized airway organoids were applied to immunofluorescence staining to label ACCTUB+ ciliated cells (red). Nuclei and actin filaments were counterstained with DAPI (blue) and Phalloidin-647 (white), respectively. Scale bar = 20 μm.Characterization of organoids Examine mRNA expression of cell type–specific genes or other cellular genesRT-qPCR assay: add 350 μL of cell lysis buffer to harvest the organoids for RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and detection of cellular gene expression.Note: Use the autologous undifferentiated lung organoids for comparison/control.
