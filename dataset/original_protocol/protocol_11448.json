    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Michigan.\n1. Generation of brain tumor NS and culturing conditions.\nPrepare Neural Stem Cell Medium (NSC) with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/F12B27 supplement (1x), N2 supplement (1x), and an antimicrobial reagent. Supplement NSC medium on the day of use with human recombinant endothelial growth factor (EGF) and basic-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) at a final concentration of 20 ng/mL each.\nInduce the brain tumor in mouse using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system in which plasmids encoding oncogenes or shRNA targeting tumor suppressors is injected into the lateral ventricles of neonates to generate spontaneous brain tumors9. Select a mouse with a large tumor, which is confirmed with bioluminescence imaging.\n\tNOTE: More detailed information about the Sleeping Beauty Transposon System and plasmid constructs used can be found in Calinescu et al.9.\n\t\nTo image the mice, inject 100 µL of 30 mg/mL luciferin solution intraperitoneally using a 26 gauge needle.\n5 min after injection of luciferin, anesthetize the animal using an anesthesia chamber with oxygen/isoflurane flow set to 2% isoflurane.\nWhen the animals are anesthetized (usually 2-3 min), place the animals in the bioluminescence chamber with oxygen isoflurane set to 2% isoflurane. If the animals will be under anesthesia for longer than 5 min, use an ophthalmic ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nImage the mice using an in vivo optical imaging system with the following parameters: automatic exposure, large binning, and aperture f=1. The parameter to consider it a large tumor is a bioluminescence >106 photons/s/cm2/sr.\nEuthanize the mouse with an overdose of isoflurane inhalation anesthetic in a closed chamber, check by toe pinch that the animal is anesthetized, and decapitate the mouse.",
    "Extract the brain and dissect it as described previously in Calinescu et al.9.\nPlace the brain in a 10 cm Petri dish. If the tumor induced expresses a fluorescent protein, use a fluorescent dissecting microscope set to the appropriate fluorescent channel and 0.3X magnification, otherwise identify tumor mass by the differences in tissue color and texture. Use scalpel and forceps to separate the tumor tissue from the normal brain.\nMince the tumor into small pieces in the Petri dish. Place the dissected tumor in a 1.5 mL tube with 300 µL of the NSC medium.\nUse a disposable plastic pellet pestle that fits to the walls of a conical microcentrifuge tube to gently homogenize the tumor. Add 1 mL of cell detachment medium and incubate the sample for 5 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The use of a pestle may kill some cells. If the reader wants to maximize the cell viability, the use of a pestle may be omitted.\nPass the cell suspension from step 1.7 through a 70 µm cell strainer and wash the strainer with 25 mL of NSC medium.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature, decant the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet into 6 mL of NSC medium.\nPlate the tumor cell suspension from step 1.9 into a T-25 culture flask and culture it at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Usually after 3 days, there will be a mixture of some dead cells, adhered cells and some cells forming NS which float in the medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube, collect only the cells that sink to the bottom using a micropipette and re-plate them onto a T-75 tissue culture flask.",
    "Maintain the cells at relatively high density (1-3 X 106 cells in a T-25). Passage the cells when they are confluent.\n\tNOTE: Confluency is determined by the spheres size. Black centers of large spheres mean that there are dead cells in the center and indicate that the cells should be passaged immediately.\nAdd the growth factors (EGF and basic-FGF; 20 ng/mL each) every three days. Change the medium when the cells are not confluent and the medium turns light orange.\nTo change the medium, collect the old medium and centrifuge it at 300 x g at room temperature for 5 min and re-suspend the cell pellet in NSC medium supplemented with EGF and FGF at the concentration specified in step 1.1.\n\tNOTE: If the spheres are at mid-to high confluency, but not ready to be passaged (sphere size is small with a diameter < 100 µm), then the pellet can be split into two flasks.\nTo passage the cells, centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature, decant the supernatant and incubate the cells in cell detachment medium for 5 min at 37 °C.\n\t\nAdd 5 mL of balanced salt solution to dilute detachment medium and centrifuge it at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDecant the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 18 mL of NSC medium and divide the suspension equally into three T-25 flasks.",
    "To freeze the aliquots of cells, dissociate the cells as in step 1.15, and freeze the cells in 1 mL aliquots of 90% fetal bovine serum with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Slowly cool down the cells by placing the cells on ice for 10 min, then keeping the cells -20 °C for 30 min, and -80 °C for 1 day. The next day, transfer the cells to a liquid nitrogen storage container.\n2. Native ChIP\nChromatin preparation\n\t\nAfter making stock of derived NS, culture NS in a T-75 in 15 mL of NSC medium at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 until NS become confluent. One confluent T-75 plate will yield 3-5 X 106 cells.\nWhen the cells become confluent, centrifuge NS at 300 x g for 5 min, decant the supernatant and add 1 mL of cell dissociation medium. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min. Add 5 mL of medium and count the cells using a hemocytometer10.\n\t\tNOTE: 1 x 106 cells are needed per immunoprecipitation (IP) reaction. Note that a pre-immune serum or IgG control must also be included11.\nCentrifuge the NS in one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube at 300 x g for 5 min, decant the supernatant and re-suspend NS pellet with 1 mL of balanced salt solution and transfer the suspension to low protein binding 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Centrifuge NS at 300 x g for 5 min, decant the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 95 µL of digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.2% polyethylene glycol octylphenyl ether) per 1 x 106 cells supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail at a high concentration (1:100). Immediately pipet the cells up and down to prevent clumping and avoid creating any bubbles.\nResuspend MNase in 50% glycerol to make 1 mg/mL solution (1.15 units/µL, stored at -20 °C) that will be referred to as \"1x\" stock. Make a \"0.1x\" stock by doing a second 1:9 dilution with 50% glycerol (e.g., 900 µL of \"1x\" MNase and 100 µL of 50% glycerol) and store it at -20 °C.\nMix 5 µL of \"0.1x\" MNase and 145 µL of digestion buffer. Keep the enzyme on ice all the times. Add 5 µL of diluted MNase in digestion buffer per 1 x 106 cells. Flick the tube to mix and place the tube in 37 °C block for exactly 12 min. Process the samples one at a time to ensure an accurate incubation time of 12 min.\nAdd 10 µL of 10x MNase Stop Buffer (110 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 55 mM EDTA) per 1 x 106 cells. Samples must be kept on ice from this point onwards.\nAdd 110 µL \"2x RIPA buffer\" (280 mM NaCl, 1.8% polyethylene glycol octylphenyl ether, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.2% Na-deoxycholate, 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA); stored at 4 °C) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail at high concentration (1:100) per 1 x 106 cells. Flick the tube to mix.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes for 15 min in a microfuge at 4 °C and 1700 x g. Transfer the supernatant to a new regular 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (low protein binding microcentrifuge tubes are no longer necessary) and store them on ice. Discard the pellet.\nImmunoprecipitation (IP)\n\t\nMix Protein A and Protein G magnetic beads in a 1:1 ratio. For every IP, prepare 25 µL of beads.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 140 mM NaCl, 1% polyethylene glycol octylphenyl ether, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate; stored at 4 °C) supplemented with protease inhibitors at low concentration (1:1000).\nUse a magnet to allow beads to separate from the washing solution and decant the washing solution (approximately 1 min). Perform the wash step twice.\nRe-suspend the beads to the original volume using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (1:1000).\nIf necessary, dilute the chromatin using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (1:1000) so that each IP has a volume of 100-200 µL. Reserve 10% of the volume used per IP of chromatin for the input.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, if 200 µL are used per IP, 20 µL of diluted chromatin should be reserved for the input. For a total of four IPs, total chromatin volume should be diluted to 820 µL.\nPrepare the input. Add 100 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) to the input and incubate the input at 55 °C for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 2.2.6-2.2.7 can be performed along with steps 2.3.4 and 2.4.1.\nPurify the input using a PCR purification kit following the manufacturer's instructions and elute in 50 µL of elution buffer provided in kit.",
    "Measure the concentration of the input using a microvolume spectrophotometer and record the results in a notebook. Blank with elution buffer from kit.\n\t\tNOTE: In mouse neurospheres, we used approximately 6 µg of DNA for each IP.\nRun input on a 1% gel or load 1 µL on a DNA Bioanalyzer using standard settings. Store the remainder for use as input in downstream applications.\nAdd 10 µL of washed protein A & G magnetic beads for every IP and incubate IP for 1 h at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, add 30 µL of protein A & G magnetic beads for three IPs.\nPlace the samples on a magnet and allow beads to separate. Divide chromatin by transferring the previously determined amount into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd the antibody and wrap the caps with plastic paraffin film to avoid evaporation. Incubate the samples overnight at 4 °C with rotation at 20 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentration should be determined empirically following manufacturer recommendations.\nThe next day, spin the tubes using a mini centrifuge at room temperature, 2000 x g, for 10 s. Then add 10 µL of beads to each IP and incubate IP for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation at 20 rpm.\nIP Washes and Protein Digestion\n\t\nAdd 150 µL of RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors at low concentration (1:1000) to each IP and incubate IP at 4 °C with rotation at 20 rpm for 5 min. Place the sample on a magnetic stand and allow the magnetic beads to separate. Use a pipet to remove the supernatant. Repeat this tep five washes.",
    "Add 150 µL of LiCl buffer (250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 % Na-deoxycholate; store at 4 °C) supplemented with protease inhibitors at low concentration (1:1000) to each IP and incubate IP at 4 °C with rotation at 20 rpm for 5 min. Place the sample on a magnetic stand and allow magnetic beads to separate. Use a pipet to remove supernatant.\nAdd 150 µL of cold TE (no protease inhibitors) and incubate the sample at 4 °C with rotation at 20 rpm for 5 min. Place the sample on a magnetic stand and allow magnetic beads to separate. Use a pipet to remove the supernatant.\nAfter the final washing step, re-suspend the sample in 100 µL of TE buffer supplemented with proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) and incubate the sample at 55 °C for 1 h.\nDNA Purification and ChIP Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR)\n\t\nPurify immunoprecipitated DNA using a PCR purification kit. After addition of DNA binding buffer from the kit to each sample, place the tube on a magnet and wait until magnetic beads aggregate, then transfer the supernatant to the cleanup column. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and elute in 50 µL of elution buffer provided in kit.\nTo check if the IP is successful, perform a qPCR. Ideally, primers should be designed for positive and negative control regions.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, for an IP performed with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the following samples should be run on qPCR: H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and IgG ChIP DNA, input DNA, and a no template control (NTC) using primers for regions to be enriched with H3K4me3 (positive control) and regions to be enriched with H3K4me3 (negative control); likewise, for H3K27me3.",
    "Follow standard protocols to perform qPCR12. Briefly, perform a qPCR using SYBR green master mix, 0.5 µL of 10 µM working concentration of each forward and reverse primer, and 2 µL of ChIP or input DNA. Read plates using a Real Time PCR system. Primer sequences are provided in Table 2. The Gapdh primer sequences from Hwang et al. were used13.\nAnalyze ChIP data relative to the input, i.e., percent input method (% IP)14. Calculate the percent input using the following formulas:\n\t\tAdjusted input = mean ct(input)-log2(DF)\n\t\twhere DF is the dilution factor of the starting input and\n\t\tDF = total volume of IP/ volume of input\n\t\t% IP = 100×2^(Adjusted input - Ct (IP))\n\t\twhere Ct is the threshold factor.\nSubscription Required.
