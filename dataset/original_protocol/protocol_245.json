    "**Euthanasia and laparotomy**\n1| Euthanize mice \\(inject i.p. 12.5 µg Avertin in 100 µl NaCl per 10 g body weight or use 1.5-2% isoflurane inhalation, TEM Sega, France), shave with electric trimmer, disinfect in 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol for 1 min then immobilize at the back-down position on the dissection pad \\(Styrofoam or equivalent support) by the fore,- and hind -limbs using elastic rings. Place the platform under a viewer light source. \n●TIMING After a single Avertin injection mice become immobile within 2-3 min, remain anesthetized for 15-20 min and will recover within 30-60 min. \n\\!CAUTION Animal experiments are to be performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines. Respect death criteria rigorously prior to any surgical interventions \\(immobility, eyeball blinking, heart beating, breathing and inertia to pain).  \n2| Cut the skin first from the pubis along the sternum and then the wall of abdomen using scissors and forceps, then fix the skin aside by pins. Pull the liver carefully, cut the diaphragm and then cut the ribs along the chondro-osseuse joints bilaterally; turn-up and immobilize the sternum by a needle \\(G 22) to uncover the heart. Rinse the thorax and abdomen with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free PBS supplemented with 10 mM EDTA. Lift the liver and digestive tube and dislodge on the left side gently to facilitate trans cardiac perfusion.\n?TROUBLESHOOTING Keep main blood vessels intact and avoid visceral tissues to compress. \n**Whole-body perfusion**\n3| Hold the heart with lightweight tweezers and introduce the butterfly cannula \\(BD Venflon, 0.8x32 mm) via the heart apex and left ventricle into the ascending aorta. Hole the right atrium and perfuse mice with 20-30 ml pre-warmed 0.9% \\(wt/vol) NaCl \\(37 C°, 110 cm height/pressure). \n● TIMING 10 min",
    "■ PAUSE POINT Continue either with Fig. 1 C| micro-dissection, Fig. 1 D|  BM fractionation \\(Supplementary Video 1a-d), Fig. 1 E|, F|, G| and H| quantitative determinations, Fig.1 I| laser scanning confocal microscopy,  Fig.1 J| transmission electron microscopy or Fig.1 K| µCT imaging.\n**Microdissection and fractionation of mouse femoral BM** \nSupplementary Video 1a-d|: Microdissection of femur under the stereomicroscope\n4| Strip the hind limbs, dissect femurs aseptically and cut muscle and tendon under 4 ml PBS containing 0.5% \\(wt/vol) BSA containing double strength antibiotic-antimycotic solution at +4 °C in a 60 mm Petri dish. Detach and remove the distal epiphysis. Rinse, then transfer cleaned femurs in a 35 mm Petri dish containing 4 ml IMDM containing 4% \\(vol/vol) FCS. \n■ PAUSE POINT Cleaned femurs in IMDM/4% FCS can be pooled on ice for a few h.\n● TIMING Preparation of two femurs takes 20 min.\n5| Place the dish under the dissection microscope. Hold the femur firmly with serrated forceps, section the distal spongiosa in halves and then bisect the compact diaphysis bone longitudinally making tiny, continuous holes using a sharp scalpel \\(#15A) along one side and then along the opposite side of femur. Open the two halves to uncover the BM shaft. \n▲CRITICAL STEP To recover the whole, intact marrow parenchyma, apply the fine scalpel carefully to make tiny holes only in the bone along the femur. Change medium to remove joint, bone spikes or muscle fragments prior to BM fractionation.  \n?TROUBLESHOOTING Hardness of the cortical bone varies with age and is different in low or high bone-density mouse strains. The instruments should be adapted accordingly, for example, use watchmaker forceps and 25 G needle to bisect femurs in perinatal and young mice.",
    "6| BM attaches to the endosteal bone surface by different forces depending on the anatomical locations, i.e. loosely at the cylindrical diaphysis and firmly at the spongy metaphysis \\(Fig.2| and Fig.3|). Following longitudinal bisection of femur aspirate the BM shaft from the central diaphysis using a 200-µl pipette tip and transfer this in a polystyrene tube filled with 2 ml IMDM supplemented with 2% \\(vol/vol) FCS \\(Tube-B). Dilacerate the metaphyseal spongiosa by fine scalpels to open the spongy meshwork, remove the loosely attached suspension and haematon nodules by harmless trituration and then pool this fraction in Tube-B. Scrape out the whole, inner endosteal/spongy bone cushion and transfer this pellet into Tube-C. \nSeparate the whole, pooled BM parenchyma \\(Tube-B) into two fractions, i.e. the buffy coat suspension and haematon nodules. Dissociate and erode the whole BM by three up-and-down aspirations via a 23 G needle and then allow nodules to settle during 10 min on ice. Transfer the supernatant suspensions in a 15-ml tube \\(Tube A). Add 1 ml fresh medium to the pellet and repeat the dispersion/erosion step two times using 25 G needles. Pool the supernatant suspensions to constitute the buffy coat fraction and conserve the nodular pellet containing haematons. \nThe procedure results in three defined fractions: Tube A - Fraction 1: buffy coat single-cell suspension; Tube B - Fraction 2: nodular haematon units and Tube C – Fraction 3:  endosteum/spongy bone \\(EOSB) containing firmly attached BM, mainly haematons, \n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://path.to/image.ext\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\\(Fig. 2|<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2401/thumbnail/Figure_2.png?1357726384\">See figure in Figures section.</a>) <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://path.to/image.ext\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**Enumeration of haematon units**",
    "7| Native haematon isolates. Stir up the purified haematon pellet in 1 ml standard culture medium \\(Zn-7 fixative can be used instead). Transfer 50 µl aliquot on a cleaned glass slide, remove occasional bone spikes and bubbles under the stereomicroscope and then cover the preparation with a 60x25 mm cover slip. Count compact aggregates under the microscope at low magnification \\(Fig. 2B|). \n●TIMING 15 min \n▲CRITICAL STEP Native haematons may occur in larger co-aggregates \\(see for example Fig.3Ba| and Fig.3Bb|). Continue mild dispersion through a 25G needle, or use digital image erosion36 to recognize and count individual haematon units. \n8| Haematon counting in short-term and long-term organotypic culture \\(Hem-LOC). Plate aliquots in Hydron bordered 25-sq cm flask filled with 4 ml My-LTCM and incubate the cultures in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 33 °C. Count haematons at d4 appearing either as rolling/slightly adherent spheroids or fully adherent cobblestone area forming islands \\(CAFI) under the phase-contrast inverted microscope. \n●TIMING Counting discrete CAFIs in a 25-sq cm flask takes ˂5 min.\nContinue the culture and apply weekly half depopulation and replacement of medium by fresh My-LTCM. Count CAFIs again at d35 \\(Fig. 2B| and Fig. 4Ab).  \n▲CRITICAL STEP Under the above conditions ≥90% of haematons become adherent and flattened but keep their structural integrity and maintain cell production for several weeks. \n?TROUBLESHOOTING The absence of structural integrity indicates for inadequate culture medium or culture conditions. \n \n9| Extrapolate the data from 7| and 8| for the whole femur \\(or other skeleton segment), represent graphically and calculate correlation \\(Fig. 2B|). \n**Functional analysis of haematons ex-vivo using video-microscopy, FACS, clonal bioassays and IH/LSCM**\n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://path.to/image.ext\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\\(Fig 3|<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2402/thumbnail/Figure_3.png?1357726386\">See figure in Figures section.</a>) <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://path.to/image.ext\">See figure in Figures section.</a>",
