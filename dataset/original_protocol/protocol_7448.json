    "Culturing MSCs for cell expansion Please note that this protocol has been slightly adjusted from the ScienCell protocol for the adipose-derived MSCs used in this experiment. If you obtain MSCs from a different source, it is advised that you use the specific protocol for your MSCs when expanding your cells.Coating T75 flask with fibronectinWorking in the BSC, add 5 mL of PBS and 150 μL of fibronectin to a 15 mL conical to make up a 30 µg/mL fibronectin solution. Mix and add to the T75 flask.Gently move the flask forward and back and then side to side, to evenly coat the bottom of the plate, ensuring there are no dry spots.Spray the exterior of the flask with 70% ethanol and place in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight.Seeding cellsPrepare the complete MSC medium and let it come to RT (refer to Note 15). Refer to Recipe 3.Remove the fibronectin-coated plate from the incubator, spray the plate with 70% ethanol, and place in the BSC.Aspirate the fibronectin solution and add 15 mL of complete MSC medium to the flask. Place the flask to the side.Remove a frozen cryovial of HMSC-AD from the liquid nitrogen and place it in a 37 °C water bath without submerging the cap. Hold the cap and swirl the vial gently.When a small ice crystal remains, spray the cryovial with ethanol and place it in the BSC.Carefully remove the cap of the thawed cells without touching the interior threads.Transfer the cells from the cryovial to the fibronectin-coated flask using a 1 mL pipette, drop by drop. Refer to Note 5.Replace the cap on the flask. Move the plate forward and back and then side to side, to evenly distribute the cells.Look at the cells under the microscope to ensure even distribution.",
    "Refer to Note 1.Place the flask in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Do not disturb the plate for at least 16 h.Change the media the next day and every 48 h thereafter, until the culture is approximately 50% confluent.After culture is 50% confluent, perform daily media changes.When culture is approximately 90% confluent, you can passage into a new plate/flask or freeze the cells.Changing mediaWarm MSC media to RT. Refer to Note 15.Retrieve T75 flask with MSCs from the incubator.Check the confluency and morphology of the cells under the microscope.Sterilize the plate with 70% ethanol and place in the BSC.Remove the media from the flask using a 25 mL serological pipette by tilting the flask so that the media accumulates at one corner and place the serological pipette in that corner. Be careful not to scrape the bottom of the flask or touch the pipette against the mouth of the flask.Add 15 mL of complete MSC media.Check under the microscope to ensure that the cells are still attached to the plate surface.Place the flask in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Passaging cellsWarm complete MSC media, trypsin-EDTA, FBS, and DPBS to RT.Retrieve the T75 flask with MSCs from the incubator.Check the confluency and morphology of the cells under the microscope to confirm the MSCs are around 90% confluent.Sterilize the plate with 70% ethanol and place in the BSC.Aspirate the media from the plate using a 10 mL serological pipette.Gently wash cells with 5 mL of DPBS by adding DPBS and removing it shortly after.Add 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the flask and incubate for approximately 1–2 min, or until the cells have round up, at 37 °C. Check cells mid-way through incubation to see if they are rounding or coming off the plate.",
    "Spray the flask with 70% ethanol, then place in the BSC. Transfer the trypsin solution from the flask to a 50 mL conical containing equal parts of FBS to trypsin. If 5 mL of trypsin was added to the cells, add 5 mL of FBS to the conical.Place the flask back in the incubator for one more minute without any solution.At the end of the incubation, gently tap the flask to detach the cells. Check under the microscope to ensure the cells have all detached.Add 5 mL of FBS to the flask and transfer the contents to the 50 mL conical.Examine the flask under the microscope to ensure that there is less than 5% of cells in the flask.An additional wash of the flask can be performed using 5 mL of DPBS to collect any remaining cells.Centrifuge at 123× g for 5 min at RT.Meanwhile, add 15 mL of complete MSC media to a prepared fibronectin-coated flask. Refer to step A1.After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant from the 50 mL conical. Be careful not to disturb the cell pellet.Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of complete MSC media and pipette up and down to ensure a homogenous cell suspension.Count the cells using trypan blue and a cell counter or a hemocytometer (refer to step A5 for freezing protocol if you are not seeding the cells).Plate cells at a density of 6,000 cells/cm2. Equation 1 can be used to calculate the quantity of cell suspension needed per well (or flask). A sample calculation for a T75 flask can be seen below. Refer to Note 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230503/20230503190155_6365.jpg Add the calculated quantity of cell suspension to the flask containing 15 mL of media.",
    "Add the cells to the middle of the flask using a 1 mL pipette and move it back and forth, then side to side, to evenly distribute the cells. Refer to Note 1.Check the cells under the microscope to ensure even distribution.Place the flask in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Do not disturb the flask for at least 16 h.Change the media the next day and every 48 hours thereafter, until the culture is approximately 50% confluent.After culture is 50% confluent, perform daily media changes.When culture is approximately 90% confluent, you can passage into a new plate or freeze the cells down.Freezing cellsFrom step A4r, after performing the cell count, add approximately 5–10 mL of complete MSC media to the remaining cell suspension.Centrifuge at 123× g for 5 min at RT.Meanwhile, label the desired number of cryovials with the cell type, passage number, number of cells, date, and your initials. The number of cells per cryovial should be 1 million per 1 mL of 10% DMSO Freezing Media solution.In a new conical, mix a 10% solution of DMSO in complete MSC media. Refer to Recipe 14.After centrifugation, aspirate supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the cell pellet.Add 1 mL of 10% DMSO diluted in complete MSC media per 1 million cells to the conical containing the cell pellet. Gently pipette up and down to resuspend the cells. This step must be done quickly, as cells could be adversely affected in DMSO at RT.Add 1 mL of resuspended cells to each cryovial.Transfer the cryovials to a Corning® CoolCell® containers and place in the -80 °C freezer for 24 h.After 24 h, place cryovials in the liquid nitrogen dewar.",
    "Differentiating MSCs to dopaminergic neurons on 2D cell culture plate Prior to performing any bioprinting experiments, it is important to perform 2D cell culture experiments to determine if the MSCs will successfully differentiate to dopaminergic neurons and to optimize the cell density for differentiation. Please note that this protocol has been slightly adjusted from Trzaska and Rameshwar (Trzaska and Rameshwar, 2011).Coating a 12-well plate with poly-L-Ornithine/LamininDilute PLO in PBS to reach a final concentration of 15 μg/mL. Refer to Recipe 4.Add 0.5 mL of PLO/PBS per well into the 12-well cell culture plate.Gently move the plate black and forth and side to side to evenly coat the bottom of the plate, ensuring there are no dry spots in the wells.Wrap in parafilm and incubate at RT for 2 h. Check the plates every 30 min to ensure that it does not evaporate. Alternatively, incubate the plate overnight at 2–8 °C.After 2 h or the following day, aspirate the PLO using a 10 mL serological pipette.Rinse each well with 1 mL/well of PBS.Rinse twice with 0.5–1 mL/well of ice-cold DMEM. Refer to Note 2.In the middle of the rinses, dilute the laminin solution in DMEM to reach a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Refer to Notes 3 and 4. Refer to Recipe 5.Add 0.5 mL of the diluted laminin solution per well.Leave for 2 h in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. If the plate is not being used right away, place in the fridge at 4 °C for up to one week.When ready to use, aspirate the laminin and seed the cells.Seeding cells for dopaminergic differentiationWhen the MSCs have become 90% confluent, passage them by following the step A4.After performing the cell count, seed the cells onto the plate.",
    "A cell titration experiment should be performed seeding the cells at various densities to determine the optimal seeding density for your cell line. Recommendation: 1,200–25,000 cells/cm2. Refer to Notes 1, 6, and 7.Culturing from day -1 to day 12On day -1 (the day cells are seeded), add 1 mL of complete MSC media to each well to allow cells to adhere. Perform this for both control and experimental groups. A control group is added so that it is clear that the differentiation protocol worked. Refer to Note 7.Place in the incubator overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.On day 0, remove the complete MSC media and add the respective media to the control group and experimental group. Refer to Recipes 1 and 2.Place the dish back in the incubator for nine days without any media changes. The cells can be checked under the microscope to monitor their progress.On day 9, add 50 ng/mL of BDNF directly to the experimental group without performing any media changes. Do not add the BDNF to the control group.Place the dish back in the incubator and incubate for an additional three days.After 12 days, the cells can be analyzed using immunocytochemistry, live/dead assays, electrophysiology, and ELISA. Refer to Figure 1 for schematic of cell culture period.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4663/bioprotoc-13-09-4663-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Once MSCs have been counted, centrifuge the cells at 123× g for 5 min. Refer to Note 8.When centrifugation is completed, without disturbing the cell pellet, place the conical containing the MSCs in a conical rack and place in the incubator while the bioink components are being mixed. Do not remove the supernatant yet.Thaw component 2 (genipin) at RT immediately before incorporating into the rest of the bioink.Working in a sterile BSC, add component 2 to component 1 at RT. If component 2 starts to clump, slowly pipette up and down using a wide bore pipette to disperse the clump.Remove the conical containing the MSCs from the incubator, disinfect the conical with 70% ethanol, and place in the BSC.Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.Add 1 mL of component 3 (at RT) to the cells and resuspend by pipetting up and down very gently. Harsh pipetting may cause cell death. Add the rest of component 3 to the cells and pipette up and down gently. The cell density per milliliter of bioink is dependent on the specific cell line used. Cell density titration experiments will need to be done to discover which density is best for each cell line. Typically, the cell density used is from 2 to 10 million cells per milliliter of bioink. Refer to Note 8.Slowly add component 3 and MSC mixture into the mixture of component 1 and component 2 using a 1 mL pipette tip. Slowly mix the complete bioink solution by gently pipetting up and down. Avoid generating air bubbles. Refer to Note 9.Preparing CrosslinkerThaw component A and component B at 4 °C.Add component B to component A using a serological pipette and pipette up and down to mix.",
