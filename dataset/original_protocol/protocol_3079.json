    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThymocyte isolation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes collection and dissociation of the thymus to obtain a single cell suspension.\nThymus collection.\nSacrifice the mice following authorized euthanasia methods.\nCollect the thymus and store it in a collection plate containing CO2 independent media on ice.\nThymus dissociation.\nPlace the thymus on a 40 μm nylon-filter lying above a 50 mL falcon (Falcon, Corning).\nMechanically dissociate the thymus on top of the filter while thoroughly rinsing filter with FACS/dissociation buffer.\nMAIT cell enrichment\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the enrichment of MR1:5-OP-RU Tet+ cells (MAIT cells) from the single-cell suspension of thymocytes. The MR1:5-OP-RU tetramer is used to specifically label and enrich MAIT cells as MAIT cells recognize 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), a metabolite derived from the riboflavin synthesis pathway presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1-related molecule MR1.\nCritical: To obtain enough MAIT cells to fill up one well of culture, pool at least 3 thymi from B6-MAITCAST mice. This must be refined depending on the strain used.\nMAIT cell staining.\nIncubate the thymic suspension with MR1:6FP tetramer to block unspecific staining:\nCentrifuge the 50 mL falcon containing the dissociated thymi (room temperature (RT), 367 g, 5 min) and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet into the remaining volume, which should be about 200 μL (add FACS/dissociation buffer if necessary).\nAdd 6FP:MR1 tetramer to the cell suspension (1/1000 final dilution).\nIncubate at RT for 20 min.\nSecond incubation with PE-labeled MR1:5-OP-RU tetramer:\nWithout washing, add MR1:5-OP-RU tetramer, labeled with PE at the titrated concentration (usually around 1/800).",
    "Critical: For an optimal staining, we follow the guidelines provided by the NIH tetramer facility (https://tetramer.yerkes.emory.edu/support/technical[href=https://tetramer.yerkes.emory.edu/support/technical]). Briefly, the tetramer is diluted at its final concentration in FACS/dissociation buffer containing 10% Fc Block (2.4G2 antibody) and centrifuged (4°C, 20000 g, 10 min) to spin-down aggregates. The supernatant is then added to the cells.\nIncubate at RT for 30 min.\nTransfer to a 15 mL tube.\nWash with 14 mL of FACS/dissociation buffer then centrifuge (4°C, 367 g, 5 min).\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet into the remaining volume, which should be about 200 μL (add FACS/dissociation buffer if necessary).\nMagnetic labeling and separation: This step follows the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi: https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001271.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001271.PDF]).\nMagnetic labeling.\nFor 3 pooled thymi: Add 150 μL of anti-PE MicroBeads to the 600 μL of cell suspension.\nIncubate for 20 min at 4°C.\nWash with 14 mL of FACS/dissociation buffer and centrifuge (4°C, 367 g, 5 min).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL FACS/dissociation buffer.\nMagnetic separation.\nPlace a LS column (1 column for 3 pooled thymi) onto the magnet. Prime column by passing 3 mL of FACS/dissociation buffer through.\nAdd the 3 mL solution containing the stained thymocytes on the column.\nCritical: Keep the negative fraction to ensure recovery of the cells of interest in case the enrichment fails.\nRinse the 15 mL falcon with 3 mL of FACS/dissociation buffer and pass it through the column.\nWash the column with 6 mL of FACS/dissociation buffer.\nRemove the column from magnet, place it onto a 15 mL tube, add 5 mL of FACS/dissociation buffer and firmly push the cells out of the column using the plunger.\nCentrifuge the cells (4°C, 367 g, 5 min) and proceed to the expansion step.",
    "Critical: Keep some of the enriched cells to check for enrichment yield by flow-cytometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2823-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative plot of percentage of MAIT cells pre-enrichment and in the well at day 0\nMAIT cell expansion\nTiming: 30 min + culture for 10–15 days\nThe objective of this step is to expand thymic MAIT cells.\nDay 0: Starting the culture.\nResuspend the MAIT cell-enriched thymocytes in complete culture media.\nCount the cells and plate 2 million cells in 2 mL final of complete culture media solution in a 24-well plate.\nAdd recombinant mouse IL-2 and 5-OP-RU in each well to reach concentrations of 5 ng/mL and 150 nM, respectively.\nCritical: Upon synthesis, the stock solution of 5-OP-RU is resuspended in DMSO, aliquoted and kept at −80°C. Freshly thawed aliquots should be quickly diluted and added to the culture. If using a stock solution of 5-A-RU, condensation with methylglyoxal should be performed right before the addition in the wells.\nPlace the plate in a cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nCritical: It is important to start the culture with the indicated cell density for optimal proliferation, if needed add negative enrichment fraction to compensate for low number of cells in the positive fraction but remain careful about initial quantity of MAIT cells (if using a B6 strain instead of the B6-MAITCAST strain, pool several thymi) (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] - problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nEvery 2 days for 9–10 days: maintaining cells in culture.\nAdd 5 ng/mL of fresh IL-2 to the culture.\nCheck proliferation and confluence of the cells. When cells start forming clusters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], black arrow) and are above 100% confluence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), split in half and top-off with 1 mL of new pre-heated media containing fresh IL-2.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2823-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative picture of cultured cells when splitting is necessary",
    "Black arrow indicates a cluster of proliferation.\nTip: If the medium drastically changes color (yellow color for a low acidic pH using phenol red indicator) without reaching above 100% confluence do not split the cells as you may affect expansion but instead replace 1 mL of “old” media with 1 mL “new” pre-heated media containing fresh IL-2.\nCulture at least 9 days to reach 90% of MAIT cells in your cells culture. Check the quantity and purity by flow cytometry.\nExpected yield following this protocol: between 3 × 106 to 7 × 106 MAIT cells total, starting from three B6-MAITCAST thymi.\nCRISPR-Cas9 knock-out\nTiming: 2 h + 2 days culture starting at D9-10 of MAIT cells culture\nThis step describes the method used to generate knock-out MAIT cells using the CRIPR-Cas9 system. Here we targeted CXCR6. For other targets see: troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] - problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. The protocol follows the recommendations from Lonza (https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/CH/en/Transfection/p/000000000000197184/P3-Primary-Cell-4D-Nucleofector-X-Kit-L[href=https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/CH/en/Transfection/p/000000000000197184/P3-Primary-Cell-4D-Nucleofector-X-Kit-L]).\nAnnealing sgRNA: (step 1 – Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], now directly available from IDT):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2823-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flowchart depicting steps 1–3 of the CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out protocol\nScheme done using BioRender.\nPrepare the mix for annealing: 1 μL tracrRNA + 1 μL crRNA (here: crRNA → Mm_CXCR6.1_AA)\nAnneal sgRNA in a thermocycler using cycling conditions as seen in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2823_4.csv\nCell harvest and plate preparation (step 2 – Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nHarvest expanded MAIT cells.\nCollect all desired wells, rinse thoroughly each well with PBS to collect all cells.\nCount the cells: 2. 106 cells/well in nucleocuvette strip will be required.\nCentrifuge the cells (RT, 367 g, 5 min). Keep the supernatant for preparing the following culture step. The pellet will be used for electroporation after an extra centrifugation step (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] – step 3bB).",
    "Critical: Do not forget to keep some cell culture media for the preparation of the plate.\nCritical: Keep in mind that up to half of the cells will be lost at the electroporation step.\nPrepare 48 well plates for the following culture step:\nIn each well add 250 μL of cell culture media + 250 μL of fresh media + 5 ng/mL of fresh IL-2.\nPlace the plate in a cell culture incubator (32°C, 5% CO2).\nCRIPR-Cas9 knock-out (step 3 – Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). For 1 condition (2.106 cells).\nStep 3a – (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Mix sgRNA (2 μL) and Cas9 (1 μL), incubate 10 min at RT (no more than 20 min).\nStep 3b – (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Centrifuge the tube containing the cell pellet (8. a. iii.) (RT, 367 g, 5 min) and remove as much supernatant as possible using a pipette.\nStep 3c – (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Quickly resuspend the pellet in 20 μL supplemented nucleosolution P3 (see media and reagent section).\nKnock-out sample: Add 3 μL of the complex sgRNA/Cas9.\nMock sample: Add 2 μL of sgRNA + 1 μL of PBS.\nCritical: Do not leave the cells in supplemented nucleosolution P3 more than 15 min, proceed directly to the electroporation.\nStep 3d – (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Transfer the cells (≃ 25 μL/well) into nucleocuvette strip (Lonza) and start “DN110” nucleofection program (Lonza).\nCritical: Never put more than 25 μL in a nucleocuvette well. Avoid bubbles, tap gently on sides of the nucleocuvette strip to remove them if necessary.\nStep 3e – (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): At the end of the program, immediately add 100 μL of the pre-warmed cell culture media (contained in the plate prepared at step 2) and place nucleocuvette strip in the incubator (32°C, 5% CO2) for 10 min.",
    "Step 3f – (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Transfer cells into the 48 well plates previously prepared (step 2b – Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and place the plate in a cell culture incubator (32°C, 5% CO2) between 24 h and 3 days (we always performed a 3-day incubation) and then transfer at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nTo evaluate knock-out efficiency (if applicable) proceed to the phenotype evaluation step.\nPhenotype evaluation\nTiming: 2 h 30\nThis section describes the steps to evaluate MAIT cell purity, absolute numbers, and phenotype by flow cytometry. This protocol is used to assess the quality of the enrichment, of the expansion, and the CRISPR-Cas9 knockout efficiency. Extracellular staining should target the protein of interest (here CXCR6; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) as well as the markers needed to check the phenotype of your cells (here, CD44 for example). Depending on the protein studied, at least 24 h are needed after the electroporation step to assess the effect of the gene editing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2823-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative flow cytometry histograms of expanded MAIT cells (MR1:5-OP-RU tetramer+ CD44hi cells) following CRISPR-Cas9 CXCR6 knock-out protocol (10 days of expansion before CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out, and additional 5 days of culture)\nPlots adapted from du Halgouet et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nCritical: This step is applicable only if flow cytometry is suitable to identify your target protein. Other techniques may be required for other targets (western-blot, Elisa…).\nTetramer staining.\nPrepare tetramer mix in FACS/dissociation buffer, by adding titrated MR1:5-OP-RU tetramer (PE), titrated anti-TCRβ and 10% Fc block (2.4G2 antibody). Centrifuge tetramer mix to remove tetramer aggregates (4°C, 20000 g, 10 min), following guidelines provided by the NIH tetramer facility (https://tetramer.yerkes.emory.edu/support/technical[href=https://tetramer.yerkes.emory.edu/support/technical]).\nCentrifuge 50 μL of cells (RT, 367 g, 5 min), discard supernatant and resuspend in tetramer mix.\nIncubate for 30 min at RT.",
    "Wash twice: add FACS/dissociation buffer, centrifuge (4°C, 367 g, 5 min), discard supernatant.\nResuspend pellet in extracellular mix containing titrated antibodies and 10% Fc Block in FACS/dissociation buffer.\nIncubate for 20 min at 4°C.\nWash twice: add FACS/dissociation buffer, centrifuge (4°C, 367 g, 5 min), discard supernatant.\nResuspend in FACS/dissociation buffer and proceed to flow-cytometry acquisition.\nWounding and injection\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the protocol to perform a human-like full-thickness skin wound in T cell-deficient Cd3ε−/− mice, followed by injection of the previously generated knock-out MAIT cells. The objective of this step was to address the differential migratory properties of CXCR6 knock-out versus wild-type MAIT cells. To easily distinguish between knock-out and wild-type cells by flow-cytometry, we injected thymic expanded cells from mice with distinct congenic markers (i.e., CD45.1/1 and CD45.1/2 B6-MAITCAST).\nOne day prior to injection, perform full-thickness skin excision of Cd3ε−/− mice. The steps described below (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) have been slightly adapted from the protocol published by Dunn and colleagues,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] which should be used as reference.\nInject anesthetic and analgesic in mice (in accordance with local regulations).\nShave and depilate (2 min of hair removal cream) upper-back hair.\nClean and disinfect epilated skin (e.g., Betadine).\nPerform full-thickness wound using a 4 mm diameter biopsy punch on one side (right or left) slightly off the midline of the mouse’s back.\nCritical: Do not perform skin full thickness wound more than 3 mm from the mouse’s midline as the silicon ring could be lost due to scratching/grooming of the mice. Do not perform skin full thickness wound on the mouse’s midline as it could hamper mouse movements.\nApply adhesive on one side of a silicone ring.",
    "Pause point: Silicone rings or “donuts” can be prepared in advance by cutting 1 cm wide circles in a 5 mm thick silicone sheet and punching the center using a biopsy punch (5 mm diameter in this protocol).\nCenter silicone ring over the wound and suture using 6-0 nylon thread: 4 stiches for short term needs (<5 days), 6 stiches for long term needs (up to 14 days).\nCover the wound:\nAdd 1.4 cm piece of non-woven compresses.\nOverlay with transparent occlusive dressing (e.g., 3M)\nWrap mouse with cohesive contention strip (e.g., 3M coheban) of about 2 cm wide and with a length of about 1.2 x the mouse circumference.\nCritical: Regularly check wound (i.e., every 2/3 days) to assess suture status (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] - problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]) and change dressing to avoid infection.\nInject the modified expanded MAIT cells one day following the excision.\nCollect the knock-out and wild-type cells in two separate tubes and thoroughly rinse all wells with PBS.\nStain a fraction of the cells to assess: MAIT cell purity, phenotype and numbers (see phenotype evaluation section).\nBased on cell count obtained by flow-cytometry, prepare a mix of CXCR6-KO and WT MAIT cells at a 1:1 ratio in 100 μL of sterile PBS and inject intravenously. Keep a part of the injected mixture for flow cytometry analysis (repeat step b) as a reference point for further comparison.\nTip: Given the low number of immune cells infiltrating the skin and the dilution of the injected cells in the whole mouse we would recommend injecting around 1 × 106 up to 2.5 × 106 MAIT cells (with 50% of KO and 50% of WT) to ensure subsequent recovery and analysis of the injected cells.\nSkin cell isolation\nTiming: 4 h 30",
    "This step describes the protocol for obtaining a single cell suspension from the skin day 2 post-injection. (If low cell yield refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] - problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nSkin collection.\nSacrifice the mice following authorized euthanasia method.\nCollect full-thickness skin samples (i.e., dermis and epidermis) in a collection plate containing CO2 independent media on ice:\nWound site (e.g., top left side in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]d): 1 cm2 encompassing the wound and surrounding rims.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2823-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Flowchart depicting steps b. to g. of the full-thickness skin excision protocol\nEpilated skin is in pink, orange is betadine disinfected skin, wound is in red, silicone ring is purple, the black crosses indicate stitches, and the cohesive contention strip is brown.\nContralateral control skin (e.g., top right side in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]d): 1 cm2 of skin from the opposite side off the mouse’s midline.\nPreparation of a single-cell suspension from the skin.\nPlace the samples (flattened, epidermis side up) at 37°C in a 24 well-plate with 1 mL of 500 CU Dispase (Corning) for 45 min.\nTransfer and chop skin sample in a new well containing 1.5 mL of skin digestion buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nIncubate 1 h 45 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nTransfer and scratch digested skin samples on ice.\nScratch using the back end of a syringe plunger on a 40 μm nylon-filter placed on top of a 50 mL tube (Falcon, Corning).\nThoroughly wash filter and plunger using FACS/dissociation buffer.\nCentrifuge cells (4°C, 367 g, 5 min) and discard supernatant.\nRemove skin debris using cell debris removal solution (Miltenyi) - steps listed below recapitulate manufacturer’s instructions (http://101.200.202.226/files/prod/manuals/201802/05/1137979001.pdf[href=http://101.200.202.226/files/prod/manuals/201802/05/1137979001.pdf]).\nResuspend cells in 3.1 mL cold 1× PBS and transfer into a 15 mL tube (Falcon, Corning).",
    "Add 900 μL of debris removal solution and gently pipette up and down (5–10 times) to homogenize.\nGently overlay with 4 mL cold 1× PBS.\nCentrifuge cells (4°C, 3000 g, 10 min).\nAspirate top two phases.\nCritical: A “white” cloud is usually visible just above the pellet: remove it as much as possible but beware of not aspirating cell pellet.\nFill tube with 15 mL cold 1× PBS.\nGently invert the tube 3 times.\nCritical: Do not vortex the tube.\nCentrifuge cells (4°C, 1000 g, 10 min) and discard supernatant.\nProceed to cell staining following the phenotype evaluation section.
