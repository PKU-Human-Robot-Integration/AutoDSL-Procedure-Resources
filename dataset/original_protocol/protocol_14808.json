  "procedures": [
    "1. Prepare the Different Media and Additional Components\nPrior to experiment, prepare media consisting of DMEM or other specified media with the addition of either normal FBS, charcoal stripped FBS, or charcoal stripped FBS plus the component to be tested. Note that multiple components can be tested in each experiment.\nWeigh out and dilute the hormones, growth factors, or cytokines appropriately to be dissolved in the charcoal stripped serum at the physiological concentration.\n2. Prepare the Collagen Matrix on Ice\nPrepare 2 ml collagen I matrix at 2.2 mg/ml by adding the following sterile filtered components on ice: 200 μl 10x PBS (pH 7.4), 5.4 μl 1 N NaOH, 600 μl of double distilled H2O, and 1.2 ml collagen I (at 3.63 mg/ml).\nKeep collagen I solution on ice until ready to plate.\n3. Prepare Migration/Invasion Plates for Assay\nFor each cell line to be tested, use one 24-well chamber plate in which 12-wells contain inserts. Use the additional 12 wells that do not contain inserts for adding the chemoattractant media and transferring the inserts for the experimental set up.\n\tNOTE: A collagen matrix on plates with a polyethylene teraphthalate (PET) membrane and 8 μm pore size is optimal for the cell lines use here. However, a matrigel matrix in precoated plates can also be substituted with the pore size decreased according to the cell line being investigated.\nClearly label the plate, using 3 wells per condition being analyzed (FBS migration, CS-FBS migration, FBS invasion, and CS-FBS invasion as well as FBS-migration for a control, noninvasive cell line). Assay migration by movement through pores in a PET membrane, and assay invasion by movement through a collagen or matrigel matrix and then through pores in the membrane. Use different color markers for each cell condition to aid in the plating process.",
    "4. Dispense the Invasion Matrix\nCarefully pipette 75 μl of the collagen matrix solution into the inserts to be used for invasion assays. Use caution to avoid bubbles. Disperse bubbles by applying an inverted pipette tip to the surface.\nTransfer the plate with the collagen-coated inserts to a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min to enable the gel to solidify.\n5. Plate the Cells onto the Membrane or Invasion Matrix\nMeanwhile, trypsinize cells and add media with 10% FBS. Spin cells at 200 x g for 5 min on a table top centrifuge and rinse 3x in serum free media.\nResuspend in serum free media. Count cells with a hemocytometer or automated slide counter. Add serum free media to a final concentration of 5 x 104 cells/ml.\nWhen the collagen matrix has solidified (after 30 min), add 700 μl of media with either 2% defined FBS or charcoal-stripped FBS to each well. Of the 12 inserts per plate:\n\t\n3 inserts have collagen and wells with media + 2% FBS\n3 inserts have collagen and wells with media + 2% CS-FBS\n3 inserts have no collagen and wells with media + 2% FBS\n3 inserts have no collagen and wells with media + 2% CS-FBS\nUse additional plates depending on the number of factors being tested and with a no collagen control corresponding to each condition.\nAdd cell suspension to the inserts at 5 x 104 cells/ml, plating 500 μl cells per insert in all migration and invasion inserts.\nIncubate the cells for 22 hr at 37 °C.\n6. Quantify the Number of Migrating and Invading Cells\nSet up staining of wells using methanol fixative, eosin, and hemotoxylin, in separate wells.",
    "Use cotton swabs to remove cells and matrix from each well. Rrepeat with second swab application for each well.\nWith forceps, dip each insert 5 times for 1 sec into each of the 3 solutions in succession.\nAllow inserts to dry O/N.\nEither i) remove filters with a scalpel, cutting carefully around the edges and mount on a slide with coverslip and immersion oil, or ii) allow the inserts to dry O/N inverted and use the inserts directly for microscopy.\nThe next day, view slides or inserts under a microscope with a 20X objective and take 5 images from different regions of the filter. To improve consistency, take 4 outer fields and one center.\nCount cells for all conditions using the ImageJ software and apply to the formulas below.\nDetermine the percent invasion as follows:\n\tMean # of cells invading through collagen I insert = a\n\tMean # of cells migrating through control insert = b\n\t% Invasion = (a / b) * 100\nDetermine the Invasion Index in 2% FBS as follows:\n\t% invasion of cells being assayed (in 2% FBS) = c\n\t% invasion of control noninvasive cells in (2% FBS) = d\n\tInvasion Index (FBS) = (c / d)\nDetermine the Invasion Index in 2% CS-FBS as follows:\n\t% invasion of cells being assayed (in 2% CS-FBS) = e\n\t% invasion of control noninvasive cells in (2% CS-FBS) = f\n\tInvasion Index (CS-FBS) = (e / f)\n7. Repeat Experimental Protocol Comparing Charcoal-stripped FBS to Charcoal-stripped FBS + Xn with Multiple Factors Combined\nRepeat the procedure multiple times as needed using different components for “X” or a combination of components.\nApply the calculations to determine the contribution of each factor “X” to the migration and invasion effects.\nSubscription Required.
