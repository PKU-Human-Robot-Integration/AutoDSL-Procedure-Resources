    "1. Culture of Alveolar Epithelial Cells (hAELVi)\nThawing\n\t\nPipette 4 mL of cultivation ready-to-use human alveolar epithelial (huAEC) medium in a 15 mL plastic tube and quickly thaw the vial in a preheated water bath (37 °C).\nTransfer the thawed cell suspension to a 15 mL plastic tube containing 4 mL of the medium before centrifuging the tube at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 5 mL of the cultivation medium. Then, transfer the cells to a T25 flask.\nCultivate the cells under standard conditions (5% CO2, 95% humidified air, 37 °C)\nSplitting\n\t\nCheck the status of the cells microscopically. When the cells are 80-90% confluent, split the cells, following steps 1.2.2 through 1.2.10.\nAspirate the cultivation media of the cells with a sterile pipette.\nWash the cells once with 4 mL of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) and aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL of Trypsin/EDTA solution (TE) to the cells prior to incubating at 37 °C for 3 min until the cells start to detach; check for detachment under a microscope.\nResuspend the cells with 2 mL of the culture medium and centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min. Then, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet again with 3 mL of the cultivation medium.\nUse the trypan blue dye exclusion assay to determine the viability of the cells. Take 30 µl of the cell suspension and add 30 µl of a 0.4% solution of trypan blue in a tube. After that, effectively mix the solution 3-5 times using a 100 µl pipette. Take 10 µl of the solution and put it under the coverslip of the hemocytometer.",
    "Count both the total number of viable cells and the number of dead cells (blue) in the areas of the hemocytometer. Then, calculate the cell viability [%] using the equation: cell viability = 100 – (100 / total number of cells x number of dead cells)\nTransfer the aliquot with the resuspended cell pellet to a new cell culture T25 flask or a 6 well-plate. Add the cultivation medium to the cells to achieve a total of 5 mL of cultivation medium in the T25 flask, or 1 mL for each well of the 6 well-plate.\nCultivate the cells in an incubator under standard conditions (5% CO2, 95% humidified air, 37 °C)\nOnce the cells are completely confluent, they are ready for the experiment.\n2. Preparation of an Air-tight Chamber\nNOTE: The construction plan for the air-tight chamber is depicted in Figure 1.\nUse a hermetic polypropylene box with a capacity of 6.5 L. The length, width, and height are 30 x 20 x 15.5 cm, respectively. Please note, the volume of the box is lower than the theoretical volume because of the rounded corners.\nDrill a 2.5 cm diameter hole on the bottom side of the lateral wall.\nInsert a corrugated tube with a green mark, which will serve as the gas-air mixture input pipe, and seal it with silicon.\nDrill a second 2.5 cm diameter hole on the top side of the opposite lateral wall.\nInsert another corrugated tube with a red mark and connect it with a charcoal filter, which will serve as the gas-air mixture output pipe, and seal it with silicon.\nDrill a tight 4 mm diameter hole at the center of the mean wall of the box.",
    "Insert short infusion tubing that is connected at a manifold with a rotating male luer-lock, which will be plugged into a gas analyzer, and seal it with silicon.\nPlace a digital thermometer/hygrometer inside the air-tight chamber.\n3. Expose Alveolar Epithelial Cells to Halogenated Agents (Sevoflurane and Isoflurane)\nNOTE: A schematic drawing of the device is depicted in Figure 2.\nCAUTION: Although animal studies have revealed no evidence of fetal harm or impaired fertility, and a very small study during cesarean sections did not show any untoward effects on the mother or fetus, the safety of using halogenated agents (e.g., sevoflurane or isoflurane) during labor and delivery has not been demonstrated to date. Furthermore, no controlled data has been collected during human pregnancies. Therefore, performing experiments using sevoflurane or isoflurane while pregnant should be strongly discouraged.\nWork under a laboratory extractor hood.\nCustomize an anesthetic machine circuit to switch the gas line of nitrous oxide by carbon dioxide (CO2).\nPlug the air-tight chamber with the green-marked, corrugated tube into the customized anesthetic machine circuit. Insert a heated humidifier (such as those used on ICU ventilators) into the pipe between the anesthetic machine and the air-tight chamber to warm the gas flow mixture to approximately 37 °C\nInstall the air-tight chamber on a hot plate, providing a heating plate temperature of 37°C.\nPut the 6 well-plate containing the hAELVI cells into the air-tight chamber and seal the lid.\nRegulate the gas flow rates (i.e., the mixture of air and CO2) to quickly obtain the standard conditions, defined as 5% of CO2 and 95% of humidified air.\nOpen the halogenated agent evaporator and choose the percentage desired (in the present study, the tested concentrations of sevoflurane and isoflurane were 4% and 1%, respectively).",
    "Note the composition of gas mixture and the sevoflurane or isoflurane concentration as measured by an external gas analyzer and displayed on the screen.\nOnce the target values are achieved, reduce the fresh gas flow rate to 1 L/min.\nThe air-tight chamber can be maintained with this gas flow rate as long as necessary for the experiment.\n4. Measure Sevoflurane or Isoflurane by Chromatography\nPreparation of samples\n\t\nAt different time points, very briefly open the chamber to take out the studied samples (in the present study, we used a 6 well-plate) and close the lid. Keep the other samples in the box. Then, aspirate 1 mL of the medium contained in each sample with a multi-volume adjustable micropipette.\nPut the medium into 10 mL headspace chromatography vials, which should be screwed hermetically tight with a Teflon-sealed cap. Freeze the chromatography vials at -20 °C if you do not use them immediately.\nPrepare a stock solution of sevoflurane and another stock solution of isoflurane, both at 50 g/L in methanol. Simultaneously, prepare a stock solution of chloroform (internal standard, IS) at 2 g/L in methanol. Store all standard solutions at -20 °C.\nPrepare working solutions of sevoflurane and isoflurane at 50, 500, and 5000 mg/L in ultrapure water/dimethyl sulfoxyde (50/50; v/v). For internal standardization, the working solution is fixed at 100 mg/L in methanol.\nAnalysis of cellular samples",
    "NOTE: The extraction procedure is based on the previously validated method of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry from Bourdeaux et al.1 and uses the same parameters of sensibility and specificity. Sevoflurane and chloroform (IS) were used in this protocol, and isoflurane was associated with the multiparametric analytical method. Briefly, for mass spectrometry acquisition, the method was developed after pure solution injection. Then, m/z was confirmed with reference standards and literature data. Three m/z were selected for each analyte (except IS): one m/z for quantification (the most abundant and the higher), for which abundance was calculated by integrating the area under the curve for quantification, and two m/z for confirmation. Using three m/z, analytes could be specifically identified because all m/z had the same retention time, as well as because all m/z amounts (relative of ion confirmation vs. quantification) were the same in the pure standard and in all samples. With this acquisition mode, analytes could be identified and quantified with good specificity.\n\t\nConstruct a calibration 8-point curves with the concentration ranges of 0.5-400 mg/L and multiple quality controls (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 75, 200, and 400 mg/L).\n\t\tNOTE: To validate each calibration, four quality controls were used: the lower limit of quantification (C1 = 0.5 mg/L), two intermediate levels (C2 = 20 mg/L and C3 = 75 mg/L) and the final level (C4 at 400 mg/L; upper level of quantification). All standards and controls were analyzed in cultured cell matrices to avoid the matrix effect. For each calibration curve, a blank matrix was analyzed to validate that there was no interference with cultured cellular and internal standards.",
    "Prepare a stock solution of sevoflurane and another stock solution of isoflurane, both at 50 g/L in methanol. Simultaneously, prepare a stock solution of chloroform (internal standard, IS) at 2 g/L in methanol. Store all standard solutions at -20 °C. Then, prepare working solutions of mixed sevoflurane/isoflurane at 50, 500, and 5000 mg/L in ultrapure water / dimethyl sulfoxyde (50/50; v/v). For IS, the working solution is diluted at 100 mg/L in methanol.\nFor calibration curves and controls, prepare the samples by spiking 50 µL of IS (100 mg/L) into 1 mL of the cellular sample matrices.\nPrepare sample solutions with 200 µL of saturated sodium chloride water solution in a 10 mL headspace tube, screwed hermetically tight with a Teflon-sealed cap.\nGas chromatography and mass spectrometry\n\t\nFor sample analyses, use headspace injections in a gas chromatography, coupled with the mass detection method.\nCarry headspace tubes for 10 min at 80 °C with a heater shaker. Then, withdraw and inject 1.5 mL of the gas sample into the gas chromatograph. Set the parameter of the injector at 260 °C with a split flow at 100 mL/min for 2 min at the start of the chromatography run.\nUse Split/splitless injector with a carrier mode-programmed pressure. First, keep the gas pressure at 40 kPa for 0.15 min. Then, increase the rate program pressure to 150 kPa at 125 kPa/min before setting a rate of 16 kPa/min to 300 kPa pressure for 5 min.\nSimultaneous to the injection, start with an oven temperature of 60 °C for 1 min and increase until a temperature of 140 °C is reached at a rate of 20 °C/min. Then, increase the temperature again until 250 °C is achieved. The total time of the run is 7 min.",
    "Carry out the chromatography separation using a fused-silica capillary column (30 m x 1.4 µm, 0.25 mm ID). Perform mass experiments with a single ion monitoring (SIM) condition, and monitor ion quantification m/z 181, and ion qualifications m/z 151 and 51 simultaneously at a retention time (RT) of 2.30 min for sevoflurane, m/z 149 (ion quantification), m/z 115 and 87 (ion qualifications) for isoflurane at RT 2.8 min, and m/z 83 (ion quantification) for chloroform at RT 3.70 min.\nDetermine the concentrations of sevoflurane and isoflurane in the cell culture by their area ratios to that of the IS using a weight quadratic fit. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for sevoflurane and isoflurane was at 0.5 mg/L and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) was 400 mg/L.\nSubscription Required.
