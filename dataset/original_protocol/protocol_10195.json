    "Collection of the teeth used in this experiment was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the regional Medical Ethics Committee.\n1. Specimen Collection and Sample Preparation\nCollect 24 sound extracted human (pre)molars from dental practices, and brush with pumice in a low-speed handpiece to a clean (no debris, no gingival remnants) and smooth tooth surface, and finally rinse for 15 s under running tap water.\nEmbed the samples to make them fit into the recesses (12 mm x 15 mm x 27.5 mm) of the cylinder of the device.\n\t\nMelt the impression compound (one stick of 113 g) on a hotplate (50 °C) for approximately 10 min and dip the occlusal part of the molar in the molten substance, covering the occlusal surface. Place the molar upside down on a microscope slide, and press down until all cup tips touch the glass and wait ± 30 s until the impression compound has cooled and set, fixing the tooth.\nUse a syringe to pour 10 mL of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) mixture into a silicone mold with inside dimensions of 12 mm x 15 mm x 27.5 mm. Mix PMMA in a fume hood (ratio 13 g polymer: 10 mL monomer) for roughly 25 s using a spatula. Leave to stand for 15 s so that any air bubbles can escape before using.\nTurn the microscope slide upside down and suspend the molar in the silicon mold filled with PMMA. Press the slide down until it touches the mold. The pouring phase lasts approximately 1.5 min at room temperature.\nAfter setting of the PMMA at room temperature and 1,000 hPa for 20 min, remove the microscope slide and remove the embedded tooth from the silicon mold.",
    "Measure the total height of the embedded molar and adjust the height to exactly 27.3 mm by incrementally removing the cured PMMA from the bottom with a milling machine equipped with a milling cutter of 16 mm.\n2. Preparing Demineralization Solution\nAdd 0.1 M lactic acid (50 g), 1.5 mM CaCl2 (1.103 g), 0.9 mM KH2PO4 (0.612 g), 10 mL 1% chloramine, 0.5 ppm F (2.5 mL of 1,000 ppm Fluorid Standard solution) to 4,900 mL of deionized water on a stirring plate.\nTitrate with 10 M KOH (± 50 mL) to pH 4.8 with calibrated pH glass electrode.\n3. Sample Mounting and Machine Settings of the Rub&Roll (Figure 1)\nRemove the cylinder from the container and place 24 specimens in the recesses in the cylinder of the Rub&Roll.\nTo adjust loading force, adjust the protrusion of the specimen from the cylinder by placing a shim in the recess underneath the specimen. For no load (0 N) of 8 specimens, use no shim, and for 30 N (8 specimens) and 50 N (8 specimens), use a shim of 1 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively.\nMount the 2 parts of the cylinder and secure it with a M6 bolt and place the cylinder in the container.\nFill the container with 500 mL demineralization solution.\nPlace the loading rod: a PVC tube (Hardness 73 Shore A) with an outer diameter of 14 mm and an inner diameter 10 mm with an insert of a stainless steel 316 rod (Hardness 130 - 150 HB) with a diameter of 9 mm.\nSet the rotation speed to 20 rpm, to simulate clinical chewing frequency, and let the device run uninterruptedly.\nDuring the experiment, replace the demineralization solution and PVC tube, and check the pH with a calibrated glass electrode twice a week.",
    "After 3 months (corresponding to about 1,500,000 cycles) disconnect the cylinder from the container and remove the specimen by disassembling 2 parts of the cylinder, and store the specimen in deionized water.\n\tNOTE: All specimens are scanned before and after loading in the Rub&Roll, using a non-contact profilometer.\n4. Profilometric Scanning, Analysis, and Subtraction\nGenerate a topographical measurement of the sample using a profilometer.\nSwitch on equipment: computer, PSU module, and sensor controller. Place the appropriate sensor and secure with thumbscrew. Then, carefully insert the optical fiber in the sensor controller.\nSelect the correct sensor on the sensor controller. The sensor controller will show 4 options (F1 - F4). Press F4 twice and the confocal sensor menu is displayed.\n\t\nPress F3 (sensor choice) and scroll to 2 - 10,000 µm. Select (10 mm) and press F4. Press F1 and choose F4 (yes) to save settings to EEPROM. Select LED intensity and turn to position \"± 9 o'clock\" and press F4 - F2 - F4 taking a \"dark reference\" of the sensor.\nOpen the software and choose the option \"connect\" to the device. Be aware that the measuring table will automatically move to the \"home position\" search. The home screen appears on the display. Press Tools in the menu bar followed by sensor selection and choose Sensor S29 | 10 - 10,000 µm.\n\t\nPress Tools in the menu bar followed by sample rate and choose 300 Hz. Press Tools in the menu bar followed by speed sensor and choose 0 - 100%.\nSelect Scan in the menu bar. Then select Key Move Stage. Press the yellow area in the middle of the screen to move the measuring table to the center.",
    "Position the specimen in the center of the measuring table, followed by setting the correct height within the range of the sensor. Place the sensor above the area of interest of the specimen and adjust the distance of the sensor in such a way that the complete sample area to be scanned is located within the focus range of the sensor. The sensor controller indicates whether the height is within the range of the sensor showing a green area in the live data height.\nChoose Settings. Set the average to 2, to ensure each recorded data point is the average of 2 measurements. This will slow down scanning speed, but increase scanning quality. After finishing the settings press OK to return to main scanning setup.\nPosition the sensor beam on the upper left corner of the specimen. Set the total scan area to 15 mm x 12 mm with a step size in X and Y direction of 40 µm (0.04 mm), number of steps in X = 375 and Y = 300. Again, smaller steps will increase scan resolution, but also scanning time. Press Scan now to start scanning.\nWhen the scan is finished after about 10 min, select File in the menu bar, followed by choosing Save As. The scans are standardized in such a way that the scales are always on the same levels.\nSelect File in the menu bar, followed by choosing Open file. Select Warpage in the menu bar. Apply a warpage filter of 1 to eliminate the noise of the scanning table and sensor. Select Highest point in the menu bar, and find the highest point on the molar.",
    "Select Tools in the menu bar, followed by choosing option-scale to the scan configuration. In the scan configuration, set the offset in mm calculated by Z value highest point (measured in 4.10) - 3500. Set the Range in manual, from 0 to 3.6 mm, and press OK.\nSelect Load Area in the menu bar to reset the scale. Select File in the menu bar, followed by choosing Save As.\nSubtract scans taken at two different moments in time.\n\t\nSelect Open in the menu bar in the software. Locate the original scan and the modified scan file in the directory, select files, and press OK. The Options screen will appear, choose in the leveling option: manual leveling option; and in the compensation offset the options respectively, apply to original and apply to modified.\nSelect Window in the menu bar, followed by the option create view and finally the option cross section view.\nSelect the modified surface and move the modified surface over the original surface in horizontal, vertical, and Z direction (height) by holding the control key and press the left and right arrow key for horizontal direction; holding the control key and press up and down arrow key for vertical direction; holding the shift key and press up and down arrow key for Z direction in such a way that the subtracted volume and height shown in the difference view are as low as possible.\nSelect File in the menu bar, followed by choosing Save As. Output is read as mean volume loss and mean height loss.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
