    "All animal work was done in accordance to the animal care guidelines of the Baylor College of Medicine.\n1. Cell Preparation\nNote: Different cancer cell lines can be used for IIA injection depending on research purposes. We have used breast cancer cell lines MCF7, 4T1, 4T07, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and prostate cancer cell line C4-2 in our research. We typically use both GFP- and firefly luciferase-labeled cancer cells for our study and show some data here from the GFP-Luciferase-labeled MCF7 cell line.\nMaintain cells in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nBefore IIA injection, trypsinize cells at 80 - 90% confluence with 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution. Use cold PBS to wash cells twice, and re-suspend cells in 10 ml PBS for cell counting. To remove PBS, centrifuge cells at 800 x g for 5 min.\nRe-suspend cells at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/ml in ice-cold PBS.\nUse 100 µl GFP- and firefly luciferase-labeled cancer cells for IIA injection of one mouse.\n\tNote: Therefore, the number of cells received by each animal is 5 x 105. This number may need to be altered based upon the aggressiveness of cell lines.\nKeep cell suspensions on ice.\n\tNote: Vibrations may be needed to prevent cell aggregation every few minutes until it is ready for injection. For some cell lines (such as MDA-MB-231), more stringent procedures (e.g., passing through 45 µm cell strainer) may be needed to prevent aggregation. Please note that the clog of vessels may cause tissue necrosis, and therefore confounding the experiments.\n2. Animal Preparation",
    "For animal pain management, give 5 mg/kg/day carprofen (or other analgesic) with dietary supplement to the mice no less than 24 hr before surgery. Administer a dose of 0.1 mg/ml buprenorphine subcutaneously 60 min prior to the surgery. Note: an optional procedure is to implant estradiol pallet into the back of animals to provide extra estradiol. This will accelerate the grow of ER+ cancer cells (e.g., MCF-7 cells)9.\nAnesthetize a 4 - 6 week old mouse (approximately 20 g) with ketamine (80 - 100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 -12.5 mg/ml) by intraperitoneal injection.\nConfirm the appropriate level of sedation of a 20 g mouse by toe pinch and the observation of a 50% reduction in respiratory rate and pink mucous membranes (e.g., mouse ear skin and paw skin). Keep monitoring these vital signs every 15 min during the surgery. Note: No movement of the animal indicates that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized and ready for surgery.\nUse vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness.\nShave the mouse on the lower abdomen, especially the right groin area where the surgery and injection will take place.\n\tNote: This is not necessary if athymic nude mice are used.\nPut the mouse on its back, spread the legs in their natural positions and stick the toes to mobile dissection cardboard with tape.\nWipe the right groin area with 70% isopropyl ethanol soaked sterile cotton swabs, followed with betadine surgical scrub several times.\n3. The Common Iliac Vein and Artery Location and Separation\nMake a skin incision of 1.0 - 1.2 cm long between the 4th and 5th nipples in the lower right abdomen using sterile, #10 carbon steel scalpel blades held in a No. 3 handle. Then use a sterile surgical drape to cover the animal body except the incision site.",
    "Move the animal to standard bench top dissection microscope. Use a magnification of 4X for injection.\nUnder 4X magnification of the dissection microscope, insert blunt separation forceps between the fatty tissue and the peritoneum, and push the tissues outwards on both sides to expose the iliac vessels and nerves (see Figure 1).\n\tNote: The artery between aorta from the midline and the lower part of artery branches is called common iliac artery. This is where the injection takes place.\nUse one pair of straight fine forceps to break through the connective tissue (like a membrane) between vessels and the nerve, closer to the vessels.\nSwitch the straight fine forceps to the left hand. Grab a pair of angled fine forceps using the right hand. Insert the right hand forceps into same position where connective tissues have been broken. And then stick the right hand forceps through, beneath the vessels.\nAt the same time, insert the left hand forceps into the connective tissues on the left side of the vessels to guide the right hand forceps going through.\nOnce the right hand forceps gets beneath the vessels, try to separate the vessels from the surrounding tissue a little bit more, and then keep them on top of the right hand forceps.\nUse left hand forceps to deliver the tip of a 4-0 silk suture to the right hand forceps, and then pull the suture gently and slowly through beneath the vessels. Note: Now both common vein and artery vessels are lifted up by the suture (see Figure 2).\n4. Injection and Post-injection Care",
    "Prepare the cells for injection in a 31 G insulin syringe. Use 100 µl of cell suspension in PBS per injection. Make sure to pipette up and down several times to separate the cells and avoid aggregation so that the injected cells will not clog and block the blood flow.\nWith the angled forceps in the left hand, put the forceps beneath the vessels along the guidance of the suture, and then open the two arms of the forceps, having the vessels held gently on the forceps.\n\tNote: The interval between the two arms of the forceps will be the injection site.\nHold the 31 G needle with 100 µl cell suspensions in the right hand, with the bevel of the needle upward, ready for injection.\nInsert the needle into the artery lumen (blood will enter the needle tip). Then push cell suspension slowly in to inject the cells. The cell suspension will push away the red blood in the vessel. Try not to break the vessels or leak the cell suspension out.\nWhen the injection is finished, gently pull back the needle and keep holding the vessels up on the left hand forceps to stop bleeding. Then pull away the suture.\nPull away the left hand forceps, and quickly use a cotton swab to press the artery incision area to stop bleeding.\n\tNote: Usually 5 - 10 min continuous pressure is sufficient to stop bleeding.\nWhen bleeding stops, use skin glue to close the skin edges of the surgery area. Make an ear-tag, and check for bioluminescence signaling to examine the distribution of injected cells.\n\tNote: A successful injection will result in an image similar to Figure 3.",
    "Check bioluminescence signaling by injection of 100 µl 15 mg/ml luciferin in PBS at 75 mg/kg mouse concentration via the intra-orbital sinus.\n\t\t\nFor intra-orbital injection, put fingers on both sides of the mouse eye, use pressure to make eye ball slightly pop out from the eye frame, insert 28 G insulin syringe needles between eye ball and nose, and then slowly push syringe to inject luciferin.\n\t\t\tNote: At the correct position, the needle should be able to reach a depth of 2 - 3 mm before hitting hard tissue (bone).\nPlace the mouse into imaging system for in vivo whole animal imaging for 10 - 60 sec within 5 min (see Figure 3).\n\t\t\tNote: An optional procedure is to implant estradiol pellet into the back of animals to provide extra estradiol. This will accelerate the growth of ER+ cancer cells (e.g., MCF-7 cells)15.\nLeave the mouse on a warm heating pad until it wakes up. Monitor the bleeding, swelling, signs of dehiscence and pain during the post-surgical period. Put the mice back to the cage with analgesic coverage (carprofin dietary supplement suggested) given for pain management until no signs of pain. Pay close attention and care to the animals during 7 days following surgery.\n5. Monitoring Metastatic Growth\nHistomorphometry:\n\t\nHarvest tumor bearing bone tissues, fix the bones in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr, then decalcify them in pH 7.0 14% EDTA solution for 3 - 5 days, and subject them to paraffin embedding as previously described14.\nSection the paraffin-embed bone tissues at the thickness of 3 µm and perform standard histological method of Hematoxylin/Eosin staining as previously described14.\nImmunohistochemistry:",
    "Subject paraffin-embedded tumor bearing bone slides to immunohistochemistry staining for various purposes as previously described14. Briefly, immunostain MCF7 cancer cells by anti-GFP antibodies, and immunostain osteogenic cells (pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts) by anti-Osterix antibodies and anti-Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) antibodies, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
