    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSignificance of not using clonal expansion\nWhen using lentiviral delivery, the lentiviral units will integrate into the genome at different sites, some of which can lead to a phenotypic alteration in the cell. Additionally, clonal expansion of isogenic clones can lead to alterations in the transcriptome (Carcamo-Orive et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). If one uses cells of mixed clonal origins, the effect of viral integration and clonal expansion will be reduced and the signal to noise ratio of transgene expression will be increased.\nEstablishing the CRISPRi cells\nTiming: 2 weeks\nIn this step, human iPSCs are transduced with the previously designed CRISPRi lentiviral vector. This results in the creation of cells with a constitutive downregulation of the target gene.\nCreation of CRISPRi cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCulture hiPSCs on Laminin521 (Lam521)-coated wells and feed everyday with IPSBrew. Use 900 μL PBS +/+ and 25 μL of Lam521 (0.5 μg/cm2) and incubate in the fridge for 12–16 h (or at 37°C for 2 h). Split every 3–4 days with Accutase (incubation for 10 min at 37°C), seeding 100,000–200,000 cells per well in a 12-wells plate with 900 μL of iPSBrew. (See Grassi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Johansson et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nOn the day of transduction, split the cells with Accutase (incubation for 10 min at 37°C). Count the cells.\nSeed 200,000 cells per well in a 12-wells plate. Use one well per condition. Use double amount of media (1.8 mL) with 10 μM of Rock inhibitor (RI).\nPlate some untransduced cells as negative control.",
    "Directly after seeding the cells, dilute each virus 1:10 in iPSBrew and add the equivalent of MOI10 to each well (the first time, use MOI5 and 15 as well to select the best MOI for the virus and cell line combination). Add one virus per well.\nChange the media every day and add 10 μM Rock Inhibitor until the day after the first split (∼70% confluency). The first split ideally takes place on day 3 post-transduction.\nOn the 3rd day post-transduction, split cells with Accutase (incubation for 10 min at 37°C). They should now behave quite normally.\nOn day 7–10 split again with Accutase (incubation for 10 min at 37°C), collect cells, and take samples for RNA and cryopreservation. If, instead, very little cells have survived the transduction, then see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nRNA: Collect 200,000 cells, spin down, remove media and snap-freeze.\nCryopreservation: Freeze 3–4 vials of cells for further experiments.\nSeed for start of differentiation (optional).\nExtract RNA, synthesize cDNA and check CRISPRi silencing efficiency using qRT-PCR for all three guides. We use the delta Ct method with the LacZ control virus as the nominator (set as 1 to normalize the calculation) for analysis.\nSelect the two guides that produces the most efficient silencing for further studies. Ideally, the silencing efficiency is   ≥   90%.\nOptional: FACS GFP+ cells prior to investigating silencing efficiency and freezing. This is preferable if the transduction efficiency is low. If feasible, FACS at the endpoint of the experiment is still recommended in case of low levels of silencing or selection during differentiation. If low downregulation levels are reached with all of the designed guides, see also troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].",
    "Note: Selection via FACS is needed at either the start or end of experiment. Selection at the start gives a better indication of actual silencing efficiency and it is often better for long-term experiments to start with a purer population. Selection at the end is not always possible due to complex differentiation protocols (for instance, with cerebral organoids the association into single cells needed for selection via FACS destroys some cell populations). In case of fbNPC (described here), we sorted only at the end of the experiment as these cells are well suited for single cell dissociation. For cerebral organoid differentiated described in Johansson et al., (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], we sorted the cells prior to start of differentiation and then used single-nuclei dissociation for analysis. If selection via FACS is not possible, puromycin selection can be an alternative method to establish the CRISPRi cells (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nNote: We recommend freezing serval vials of cells early in procedure to be able to use similar passage numbers for repeat or follow-up experiments as well as to avoid a decrease in efficiency (due to silencing and/or uneven growth patterns of transduced and un-transduced cells) with increased passage number and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. In our hands we have not seen much effect of these processes, but this can also depend on the gene of interest.\nNote: We have not tested other culture media or coating matrices but anticipate that other media or matrices will not significantly affect the procedure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1570-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic of the CRISPRi hiPSCs transduction",
    "After lentiviral transduction, the hiPSCs are grown for 7–10 days. Then, one can optionally FACS the GFP+ cells or directly proceed to check the efficiency of the transcriptional silencing. Once the successful CRISPRi has been confirmed, the cells are frozen down and ready to be used for the desired experiment.\nDifferentiate hiPSCs into fbNPCs\nTiming: 3 weeks\nHere, the steps to differentiate the hiPSCs into forebrain NPCs (fbNPCs) are described (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Grassi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and Johansson et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The CRISPRi cells have also been differentiated into cerebral organoids (see Johansson et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) with efficient silencing shown to persist after four months, see also expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1570-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic of the differentiation protocol used in this project\nThe differentiation is a two-week long protocol based on dual-SMAD inhibition that allows differentiation of hiPSCs into fbNPCs.\nThaw the two CRISPRi cell batches with the most efficient transcriptional silencing (e.g., guide1 and guide2), the LacZ CRISPRi control (experimental control), and include one untransduced control (FACS control).\nSplit the cells once before the start of differentiation.\nCoat one well in a 6-well plate (2.5 mL PBS + 150 μL Lam111) per condition. Leave 12–16 h at 4°C.\nDay 0.\nCollect the cells from four different conditions and count the number of cells.\nSeed 75,000 cells onto each Lam111-coated well in N2 media + Noggin (100 ng/mL) + SB431542 (10 μM) + Rock Inhibitor (10 μM) from each condition.\nDay 2. Replace media (N2 media + Noggin (100 ng/mL) + SB431542 (10 μM)), 2.25 mL/well. As the cells grow more dense, the volume of media will increase throughout the differentiation.\nDay 4. Replace media (N2 media + Noggin (100 ng/mL) + SB431542 (10 μM)), 2.5 mL/well.",
    "Day 7. Replace media (N2 media + Noggin (100 ng/mL) + SB431542 (10 μM)), 3 mL/well.\nDay 9. Replace media, N2 media only, 3.5 mL/well.\nDay 10. Coat 12-well plate with Lam111 (900 μL PBS + 60 μL Lam111, 1 well per condition), and 96-well plate with 100 μL PBS + 6 μL Lam111 (2–3 wells per condition).\nDay 11. Split cells with Accutase (10 min incubation at 37°C  °  ) and reseed (3 million cells/well) in B27 media + AA (0.2 mM) + BDNF (20 ng/mL) + RI (10 μM). Seed also 250,000 cells per condition per well in a 96-well plate for immunocytochemistry.\nDay 14. On day 14 the cells are fbNPCs as defined by FOXG1 and PAX6 staining and their transcriptional profile (Grassi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Johansson et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nFix cells in the 96-wells plate for 15 min at RT using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde.\nPerform immunocytochemistry of FoxG1 (1:75, RRID:AB_732415) for confirmation of forebrain identity (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). These cultures are homogenous at day 14 and almost all cells should appear positive after immunohistochemistry. Very similar results have been found with another human iPSC lines, one human ES line and two chimpanzee iPSC lines (Grassi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Johansson et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Additionally, when we performed single cell RNA-seq of these cultures, 95% of the analyzed cells were found in one main Pax6 and FoxG1 positive cluster (Johansson et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1570-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Immunocytochemistry of FOXG1 in fbNPCs\nOn day 14, the fbNPCs were fixed and then stained for FOXG1 (red) and DAPI (blue).\nCollect and sort the cells.\nPrepare FACS media and collection media (B27 media + Rock Inhibitor (10 μM).\nCollect the cells using Accutase (10 min incubation at 37°C) to ensure single cell suspension.",
    "Resuspend the cells in FACS media and filter prior to FACS.\nPrepare collection tubes with collection media (B27 media + Rock Inhibitor (10 μM).\nSort GFP+ cells into the collection tube.\nKeep on ice.\nSpin down, remove supernatant and snap-freeze pellet and store at −80°C.\nCritical: Bring untransduced cells to the FACS to set the gate for GFP and Draq7 (cell death marker).\nNote: As the cell density increases the protocol calls for increased volume of media.\nNote: One sample is needed for RNA isolation (RNeasy Mini kit (50) (QIAGEN, cat. # 74104)) to re-assess the transcriptional silencing efficiency at the end of the experiment. Collect additional samples depending on the scientific question and assays. We typically collect 3 × 200,000 cells per condition.\nOptional: If the gene of interest encodes for a protein the silencing can also be validated using WB.\nSilencing can also be validated using RNA-sequencing, via histone methylation marks-mediated CUT&RUN or ChIP, where reduction of H3K4me3 and/or enrichment of H3K9me3 markers confirm the silencing.\nCombine guides for analysis for reduction of off-target effects\nTiming: 4 days\nThis part of the protocol involves combining or verifying the effect of the CRISPRi using two different guides. This varies depending on the read-out. RNA-sequencing is used here as readout, and the combination of guides will be described below (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1570-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Schematics of fbNPCs FACS and RNA-seq analyses\nOnce the GFP+ fbNPCs are sorted via FACS, they are prepared for RNA-sequencing. The sequencing results are then analyzed to compare transcriptional differences between the control cells and the CRISPRi cells.",
    "Most guides will have off-targets. However, two guides are very unlikely to have the same off-targets. Thus, combining the readouts of two guides will minimize the off-target effect of each guide. Here, we combine the two CRISPRi conditions into one, and analysis is performed with control vs CRISPRi cells (in our case n=4 and 8, respectively)."
