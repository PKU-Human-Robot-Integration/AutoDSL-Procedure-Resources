Note: The solution is viscous and sticky. Pipet carefully to ensure that you aspirate and dispense 1 ml. Do not use an electronic pipet. Thorough mixing is critical to ensure that the PCR products bind to the beads.Change pipet tips for each row.Cover the plate to protect the samples from environmental contaminants and allow to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. You can use the lid from a pipet tip box to cover the wells.Transfer Reactions to a Filter Plate (stage 7, steps 19-21) Place the filter plate on the standard collar on the vacuum manifold.",
    "Using a 12-channel P1200 pipet, transfer each reaction from the pooling plate to the corresponding row and well of the filter plate.Note: You will need to pipet twice to transfer all of the solution from each well to the filter plate. The solution is viscous and sticky, so check to ensure that all of it has been transferred.Tightly seal the unused wells with a MicroAmp Clear Adhesive Film. To ensure a tight seal, cover 1/2 to 1/3 of the wells in row D as well. Unused wells must be sealed to ensure proper vacuum pressure.Purify the Reactions (stage 7, steps 22-30) To purify the reactions, turn on the vacuum to 20 to 24 in Hg and check the seals. Do not exceed 24 in Hg. Adjust the leak valve if necessary.Ensure that the unused wells are completely sealed, and cover the plate to protect it from environmental contaminants.Run the vacuum until all of the liquid has been pulled through the filter (approximately 40 to 50 min), then turn off the vacuum.Examine each well. There should be no standing liquid in any well, and the wells should appear dull (matte). Wet wells will look shiny. If any of the wells are still wet, put the plate back on the vacuum and continue filtering for up to 10 min (total ≤ 60 min).Using a 12-channel P1200 set to 900 μl:Add 900 μl of 75% EtOH to each reaction.Turn the vacuum on to 20 to 24 in Hg.Run the vacuum for approximately 1-2 min (or until the volume in the wells begins to decrease).Add another 900 μl of 75% EtOH to each reaction (for a total of 1.8 ml EtOH).Cover the plate.",
    "Run the vacuum until all of the liquid has been pulled through the filter (approximately 10 to 15 min), then turn off the vacuum.Examine each well. Again, there should be no standing liquid in any well, and the wells should appear dull (matte). Wet wells will look shiny. If any of the wells are still wet, put the plate back on the vacuum and continue filtering for up to 5 min (total ≤ 20 min).Remove any excess EtOH as follows:Blot the bottom of the plate on Kimwipes.Wipe the bottom of the plate with a clean Kimwipe.Return the filter plate to the manifold and turn on the vacuum for an additional 10 min only. Do not exceed 10 min. Less than 10 min is ok if no excess ethanol is present in the wells or on the underside of the filter plate.Note: The purpose of this step is to remove excess EtOH so that it is not carried over into the eluate. Ten minutes is sufficient for this purpose. Leaving the vacuum on for more than 10 min may over-dry the beads which may inhibit elution of the purified DNA.Turn off the vacuum, and blot the bottom of the plate on Kimwipes to remove any remaining EtOH.Elute the Purified Reactions (stage 7, steps 31-44) To elute the purified reactions, attach the elution catch plate to the bottom of the filter plate using 2 strips of lab tape. The filter and elution plate assembly is now referred to as the plate stack.Note: Do not completely seal with tape. Product will not elute if sealed.Pour or pipet 3 ml of Buffer EB to a solution basin.Using a 12-channel P200 pipet, add 55 μl of Buffer EB to each well. For accurate pipetting, pre-wet pipet tips with EB before dispensing.",
    "Dispense as close to the beads as possible without touching them. Buffer EB should be applied directly on top of the beads.Tap the plate stack to move all Buffer EB onto the filter at the bottom of the wells.Using an adhesive film, tightly seal the filter plate.Place the plate stack on a Jitterbug for 10 min at setting 5.Inspect each well to verify that the beads are thoroughly resuspended.The beads must be thoroughly resuspended in Buffer EB so that the DNA can come off the beads.Remove the plate stack from the Jitterbug and remove the adhesive seal.Continue elution on the vacuum manifold as follows:Remove the standard collar from the manifold.Place the plate stack inside the manifold.Place the standard collar around the plate stack (Figure 4.13 on page 97).Seal the empty wells with adhesive film.Turn the vacuum on to 20 to 24 in Hg and ensure that a seal has been formed between the collar and the base of the manifold.Ensure that the unused wells are completely sealed.Cover the plate stack to protect it from environmental contaminants.Run the vacuum until all of the liquid has been pulled through the filter (approximately 5 to 15 min).Turn off the vacuum.Examine each well. Again, there should be no standing liquid in any well, and the wells should appear dull (matte). Wet wells will look shiny. If any of the wells are still wet, continue filtering for up to 15 additional min.Seal the plate stack with an adhesive film, and spin it down at room temperature for 5 min at 1,400 x g.Remove the elution catch plate from the filter plate.Using a 12-channel P200 pipet, transfer 45 μl of eluate to a new PCR plate for fragmentation.Stage 8: QuantitationDuring this stage, you will prepare one dilution of each PCR product in optical plates.",
    "You will then quantitate the diluted PCR products.Note: This protocol has been optimized using a UV spectrophotometer plate reader for quantitation. The NanoDrop® will give different quantitation results. This protocol has not been optimized for use with this instrument. In addition, the NanoDrop quantifies a single sample at a time and is not amenable to 96-well plate processing. Turn on the spectrophotometer now and allow it to warm for 10 min before use.Place the following on the bench topOptical plateSolution basinAccuGENE waterLabel the optical plate “OP”.Prepare the purified, eluted PCR product plate as follows:If the plate was frozen, allow it to thaw in a cooling chamber on ice.Spin down the plate at 560 x g for 30 sec.Place the plate on the bench top.To prepare diluted aliquots of the purified samples, pour 15 ml of room temperature AccuGENE water into the solution basin.Note: One row of wells on the optical plate are used as blanks and contain AccuGENE water only.Using a 12-channel P200 pipet aliquot 198 μl of water to each well in rows A through E of the optical plate.Using a 12-channel P20 pipet:Transfer 2 μl of each purified PCR product from rows A through D of the purified sample plate to the corresponding rows and wells of the optical plate. Row E remains water only and will serve as a blank.Pipet up and down 2 times after each transfer to ensure that all of the product is dispensed.Examine the pipet tips and aliquots before and after each dispense to ensure that exactly 2 μl has been transferred. The result is a 100-fold dilution.Set a 12-channel P200 pipet to 180 μl.Mix each sample by pipetting up and down 3 times. Be careful not to scratch the bottom of the plate, or to introduce air bubbles.",
    "To quantitate the diluted PCR product, measure the OD of each PCR product at 260, 280 and 320 nm. OD280 and OD320 are used as process controls. Determine the OD260 measurement for the water blank and average.Determine the concentration of each PCR product as follows:Take 1 OD reading for every sample.OD = (sample OD)-(average water blank OD)Calculate the undiluted sample concentration for each sample using the Sample OD:Sample concentration in μg/μl = OD x 0.05 μg/μl x 100Apply the convention that 1 absorbance unit at 260 nm equals 50 μg/ml (equivalent to 0.05 μg/μl) for double-stranded PCR products. This convention assumes a path length of 1 cm. Consult your spectrophotometer handbook for further information.Stage 9: FragmentationDuring this stage, the purified PCR products are fragmented using Fragmentation Reagent. You will first dilute the Fragmentation Reagent by adding the appropriate amount of Fragmentation Buffer and molecular biology-grade water. You will then quickly add the diluted reagent to each reaction, place the plate onto a thermal cycler, and run the GW6.0 Fragment program. Once the program is finished, you will verify fragmentation by running 1.5 μl of each reaction on a 4% TBE gel or an E-Gel 48 4% agarose gel.Thaw/place the following reagents on ice (approximately 20 min):Fragmentation BufferAccuGENE waterPrepare the Fragmentation Buffer as follows:Vortex 3 times, 1 sec each time.Pulse spin for 3 sec.Place the buffer in the cooling chamber on ice.Label the following tubes, then place in the cooling chamber or on ice, as appropriate:Two strips of 12 tubes each: one labeled ‘Buffer’ and one labeled ‘FR’One 2.0 ml Eppendorf tube labeled ‘Frag MM’Plate of purified PCR product from the previous stagePower on the thermal cycler and preheat the block to 37 °C.

    "To prepare the samples for Fragmentation, aliquot 28 μl of 10x Fragmentation Buffer to each tube of the strip tubes labeled Buffer.Using a 12-channel P20 pipet, add 5 μl of Fragmentation Buffer to each sample in the 96-well reaction plate. Check your pipet tips each time to ensure that all of the buffer has been dispensed. The total volume in each well is now 50 μl.Read the Fragmentation Reagent tube label and record the concentration.Dilute the Fragmentation Reagent to 0.1 U/μl as described below using the appropriate recipe from Table 7.Table 7.
