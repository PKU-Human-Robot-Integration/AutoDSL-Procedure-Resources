    "All experiments carried out in animals were approved by the Committee for Laboratory Animal Care and Use of the Autonomous National University of México (UNAM), under the CICUAL-Protocol number: FLC40-14. (CICUAL: \"Comité Institucional para el Cuidado y Uso de los Animales de Laboratorio del Instituto de Fisiologìa Celular, Universidad Nacional Autònoma de México\").\n1. Preparation of Embryo Protein Extract\nCollect 100 - 200 embryos for each condition to compare (morphants vs. wild type) at desired stage, for example 72 hr post fertilization (hpf).\nPlace embryos in Petri dishes containing fish water (see Table 1) and manually dechorionate embryos using fine-tipped forceps. Avoid using pronase during this step (or any other protease throughout the protocol) as it may digest the targeted receptor.\nPlace embryos in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and wash embryos twice with 1x phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (see Table 1).\nAdd 500 µl of deyolk buffer (see Table 1).\nRelease most of yolk by gently pipetting up and down (about 30 - 40 times) the embryos in the solution. For 72 hpf and 48 hpf embryos use blue and yellow pipette tips, respectively. Yellow tips may need to be slightly cut to avoid destroying embryos. The successful yolk release can be checked by observing embryos under microscope.\nCollect embryos by centrifugation at 600 x g for 15 sec.\nDiscard supernatant carefully by using a pipet.\nWash embryos twice with 500 µl washing buffer (see Table 1) by gently vortexing at lowest speed.\nCollect embryos by centrifugation at 600 x g for 15 sec.\nStarting from here, continue the procedure at 4 °C.\nDiscard supernatant carefully by using a pipet.\nResuspend embryos in 350 µl of lysis buffer (see Table 1) and homogenize using a plastic pestle.",
    "Incubate lysed embryos 30 min with agitation on a test tube rocker at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge lysed embryos at 11,000 x g for 15 min in order to remove insoluble debris.\nTransfer cleared supernatant using a pipet to a fresh tube.\nDetermine total protein by Bradford protein assay4, or other suitable procedure. If Bradford assay is used, perform the calibration curve in the presence of equivalent concentrations of the detergents presents in the lysis buffer, as they cause an underestimation of the protein standard4.\n2. Detection of Endogenous Receptor Protein\nAffinity Labeling and Immunoprecipitation (all these steps at 4 oC)\nPlace 400 - 500 µg of total embryo protein in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and dilute to 1 µg/µl with buffer 1 (see Table 1).\n\t\tNote: In order to obtain 500 µg of total embryo protein, about 100 - 200 embryos must be initially processed. 72 hpf embryos routinely yield ~ 5 µg of total embryo protein, which is sufficient for betaglycan detection.\nAdd enough volume of labeled TGF-β2 stock to reach a final concentration of 150 pM and incubate with agitation on a test tube rocker 2 hr at 4 °C. TGF-β2 must be labeled before AFLIP is started, with 125I by the chloramine T method as described by Cheifetz et al.5.\n\t\tCAUTION: Use shielding to minimize exposure while handling 125I labeled ligand.\nAdd enough volume of undiluted antibody against the receptor of interest in order to reach a 1:100 dilution and continue incubation for another 2 hr at 4 °C (incubation may be O/N). This is the optimal dilution of antiserum # 31, used in this study and described elsewhere3, but depending on the quality of the antibody, a larger or smaller dilution may be the optimal.",
    "Add 50 µl of suitable immunoglobulin binding beads (e.g., G-protein-Sepharose, which was previously equilibrated in TNTE and resuspended 1:5 of its original volume in TNTE) and incubate for 50 min with agitation on a test tube rocker at 4 °C.\nRecover the beads by microcentrifugation at 11,000 x g for 20 sec.\nDiscard supernatant in an appropriate radioactive trash container.\nWash the IP-beads three times with 1 ml of IP wash buffer (see Table 1), by vortexing and microcentrifugation at 11,000 x g for 20 sec each time.\nResuspend IP-beads in 250 µl of IP wash buffer.\nAdd 1.5 µl of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml). Prepare the DSS solution just before its use in this step.\nIncubate for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation.\nIn order to quench the crosslinking reaction, add 500 µl of IP wash buffer, supplemented with enough Tris-Cl pH 7.4 stock to reach 25 mM Tris-Cl. The free amino groups in Tris capture unreacted DSS.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 x g for 20 sec to collect IP-beads and discard supernatant.\nResuspend IP-beads in 30 µl of reducing Laemmli buffer.\nBoil samples 5 min at 94 °C.\nOptionally, analyze samples in a gamma counter using manufacturer's protocol.\nSample Analysis\nSubject samples to denaturing SDS-PAGE. Use polyacrylamide at the appropriate percentage for the mass of the receptor and run gel under standard procedure.\nImmerse gel in fixative solution (see Table 1) for 30 min at RT.\nWash gel with distillated water for 15 min.\nPlace gel in previously hydrated filter paper and cover with saran wrap film.\nDry gel at 80 °C for 1 hr.\nExpose gel on a white phosphorimager screen at RT O/N.\nScan exposed screen using a phosphorimager using manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required.
