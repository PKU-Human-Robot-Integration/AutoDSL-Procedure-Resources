    "NOTE: Mosquitoes were the only animals directly used in this study. The procedures to manage chickens, whose blood was used to feed the infected mosquitoes, were approved as IACUC Protocol #201507682 by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Virus propagation and mosquito infection studies were performed at the BSL-3 facility of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach, FL. RT-LAMP experiments were performed in the BSL-2 laboratory shared by FfAME and Firebird Biomolecular Sciences LLC in Alachua, FL.\n1. Design of Primers and Strand Displacing Probes\nExtract viral sequences for Dengue 1 from the Broad Institute database23; sequences for Zika and chikungunya from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource24.\n\t\nCreate multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for sequences of interest using software MUSCLE v3.8.3125. Use generated MSAs to search for LAMP primers sets within a conserved region of the target, and avoid non-relevant or unintended targets, such as distinctions between subtypes of a target.\nFollow the design rules for LAMP primers as described online (http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/lamp/), and allow the use of mixed bases in primers to cover the virus divergence26. To avoid cross-reactivity of primer sets, compare generated LAMP primers to the NCBI RNA virus database using NCBI BLAST27. Compare each set to eliminate primers that would dimerize in a multiplexed assay by using NCBI BLAST as well.\nScreen the double-stranded portion of the strand-displacing probe against any viral genome sequence and mosquito genomic sequence. Modify 5'-ends of target binding probe with fluorescein amidite (FAM), HEX dye, and 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) dye for Zika, chikungunya, and Dengue 1, respectively.",
    "Include a positive control primer set for urine samples. Design LAMP primers to target human mitochondrial DNA. Label strand-displacing probe with TET on 5'-end. Label quencher probes that are partially complementary to each fluorescently labeled probe with quencher (e.g., Iowa Black-FQ) on 3'-end (Table 1).\n2. Virus Isolates and Infected Mosquito Samples\nUse isolates of Zika virus (Puerto Rico strain), Chikungunya virus (La Réunion or British Virgin Islands strain), and Dengue serotype-1 virus (Key West strain). Determine viral titers using plaque assay28 or quantitative RT-PCR29. Extract viral RNAs using commercially available RNA extraction kits.\n\tNOTE: Table 2 represents the viral titers of each virus isolate used in this study.\nFollow the article published by Yaren et al. for a detailed protocol about the infection of Ae. aegypti females with Zika and chikungunya viruses20. See Table 2 for the viral titer of the mosquito sample infected with Zika virus.\n3. RT-LAMP Coupled with Thermolabile Uracil DNA Glycosylase\n10X primer mix preparation.\nPrepare 100 µM stock solution of each primer and probe (see step 1) by adding nuclease free water. Vortex well and store at -20 °C until use.\nFor 10X Primer mix for each Zika, Dengue 1, or mitochondrial DNA target, mix 16 µL of FIP, 16 µL BIP, 2 µL of F3, 2 µL of B3, 5 µL of LF, 2 µL of LB, 3 µL of LB-fluorescent labeled probe, 4 µL of quencher probe, and 50 µL of nuclease-free water to give a total of 100 µL volume.",
    "For 10X Primer mix for Chikungunya, mix 16 µL of FIP, 16 µL BIP, 2 µL of F3, 2 µL of B3, 5 µL of LB, 2 µL of LF, 3 µL of LF-fluorescent labeled probe, 4 µL of quencher probe, and 50 µL of nuclease-free water to give a total of 100 µL volume.\n\t\tNOTE: The probe concentration described above uses 300 nM of final fluorescent probe and 400 nM of quencher probe. Alternatively, use 80 nM of fluorescently labeled probe and 200 nM of its quencher probe for real-time analysis.\nAdd 5 µL of 10X primer mix (For 3-plex, add 5 µL of each 10X primer mix), 5 µL of 10X isothermal amplification buffer (1X buffer composition: 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 8 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT), 7 µL of dNTP mixture (10 mM of dATP, dCTP and dGTP; 5 mM of dTTP and dUTP), 16 units of DNA Polymerase, 15 units of Reverse Transcriptase, 80 units of recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor, 2 units of thermolabile UDG, 1-2 µL of varying amounts of viral RNAs, and water to bring the total volume up to 50 µL in a 0.25 mL PCR tube (see Table of Materials).\nInclude negative control assays at this stage by replacing viral RNA volume with water. Incubate samples between 65-68 °C for 45 min to 1 h, then analyze by running 5 µL of each sample on 2.5% agarose gel in 1X TBE buffer containing ethidium bromide (0.4 µg/mL). Use a 25 bp or 50 bp DNA ladder as marker on the gel.\n\tNOTE: Addition of a non-target specific template is optional.",
    "To detect the presence of pathogenic RNA, test each primer set and its no-template control by varying the temperature and/or magnesium concentration, since each RT-LAMP primer set was designed to work in varying temperatures (65 °C to 68 °C) or magnesium concentrations (6 to 10 mM final). Prepare the experiments at room temperature.\n4. RT-LAMP Using Viral RNA-Spiked Urine\nTest RT-LAMP primers in varying final concentrations of urine (0%, 10%, 20%, and 50%) in 50 µL of total reaction volume. For 10% final urine concentration, add 1 µL of viral RNA to 5 µL of urine. For 20% final urine concentration, add 1 µL of viral RNA to 10 µL of urine. For 50% final urine concentration, add 1 µL of viral RNA to 25 µL of urine.\nFor real-time monitoring of RT-LAMP in 10% of urine, use a real-time PCR instrument (see Table of Materials) with different fluorophore filters.\n\t\nTo read fluorescence signals from FAM-labeled amplicons for Zika, use a filter ranging from 483 to 533 nm; for HEX-labeled amplicons for chikungunya, use a filter ranging from 523 to 568 nm; for TAMRA-labeled amplicons for Dengue 1, use a filter ranging from 558 to 610 nm; and for TET-labeled amplicons for mitochondrial DNA, use a filter ranging from 523 to 568 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: FAM has excitation and emission maxima of 495 nm and 520 nm, respectively. HEX has excitation and emission maxima of 538 nm and 555 nm, respectively. TAMRA has excitation and emission maxima of 559 nm and 583 nm, respectively. TET has excitation and emission maxima of 522 nm and 539 nm, respectively.",
    "Use 96-well plates and seal the plate with a clear plastic sheet, then incubate samples at 65-68 °C for 60-90 min and record the fluorescence every 30 s using the light cycler. Initially use 80 nM of fluorescently labeled probes, and then test the 300 nM of fluorescently labeled probes.\n\t\nDetermine limit of detection for each target by adding serially diluted viral RNAs in final urine concentration of 10%.\n\t\tNOTE: Use real-time RT-LAMP to determine optimum temperature, magnesium concentration, fluorescently labeled probe concentration, and reaction time.\nTo visualize the fluorescence generated by strand displaceable probes by eye, use a blue LED light source from a light cycler with excitation at 470 nm (any gel electrophoresis box with built-in blue light source will work, see table of materials), and record the image with a cell phone camera at room temperature in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Use 300 nM of fluorescently labeled probes, when visualization of all three colors by eye using blue LED is needed.\n5. RT-LAMP on Detection of Zika-Infected Mosquitoes Using Q-Paper Technology\nPrepare quaternary ammonium-modified filter paper (Q-paper), according to previously published methods with slight modifications30.\n\t\nImmerse 1 g of cellulose filter paper circles (see Table of Materials) with diameters of 3.5 cm in 50 mL of 1.8% of aqueous NaOH solution for 15 min for activation.\nCollect activated paper circles by vacuum filtration and then immerse them in 40 mL of aqueous solution of (2,3-epoxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (0.28 g) overnight at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the mass ratio of (2,3-epoxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride to filter paper at 0.28 to 1.\nCollect the resulting cationic paper by vacuum filtration, and neutralize with 50 mL of 1% of acetic acid.\nWash the paper three times with ethanol and air-dry under a hood with constant airflow.",
    "Cut Q-paper sheets into small rectangles (3 mm x 4 mm) using a paper punch or scissors. Crush Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes potentially infected with Zika on each paper with a micro pestle.\nAdd to each paper 20 µL of 1 M aqueous ammonia solution (pH ≈ 12) and wait for 5 min. Then wash each paper once with 20 µL of 50% EtOH and once with 20 µL of nuclease-free water. Air-dry the paper in BSL-2 biosafety cabinet for about 1 h.\n\tNOTE: At this point, samples can be stored at -20 °C overnight until use.\nUsing tweezers, place each paper in 100 µL of RT-LAMP reaction mixture and incubate at 65-68 °C for 45 min. Make sure to fully submerge the paper in the solution; it should not be floating. Read and record the fluorescence arising from Zika virus using blue LED light source and orange or yellow filter.\n6. Lyophilization of RT-LAMP Reagents for 100 µL of Reaction Volume\nPrepare 10X LAMP primer mixture according to section 3.1, and prepare dNTP mixture containing dUTP according to section 3.2. Store primer mixture and dNTPs at -20 °C until use.\nPrepare 10 mL of enzyme dialysis buffer to remove glycerol, by mixing 100 µL of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 µL of 1 M KCl, 2 µL of 0.5 M EDTA, 100 µL of 10% Triton X-100, 100 µL of 0.1 M DTT and 9.198 mL of nuclease-free water. Store the dialysis buffer at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to filter (0.2-micron filters) all buffer reagent solutions prior to use and store them at 4 °C.",
    "Use an ultrafiltration membrane with 10 kDa cut-off limit (see Table of Materials). Place 350 µL of dialysis buffer, 4 µL of 32 units of DNA Polymerase, 2 µL of 30 units of Reverse Transcriptase, and 2 µL of 80 units of RNase inhibitor into ultrafiltration membrane and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAdd another 350 µL of dialysis buffer to the ultrafiltration membrane and centrifuge (14,000 x g) for another 5 min. Empty the collection tube and repeat this step, then centrifuge (14,000 x g) for 3 min.\nFor elution, invert the membrane and place in a new collection tube. Spin at 1,000 x g for 2 min. Measure the elution volume; if less than 8 µL, bring the volume up to 8 µL by adding dialysis buffer. Store the elution at 4 °C, and immediately proceed to next step.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol is for single tube lyophilization, but prepare at least 10 reaction tubes at a time using the same ultrafiltration membrane and use the same amount of dialysis buffer.\nMix 10 µL of 10X LAMP primer if singleplex (for 3-plex, add 10 µL of each 10X primer mix), 14 µL of dNTP mixture, 8 µL of dialyzed enzyme mix, 2 µL of 2 units of thermolabile UDG, and 66 µL of nuclease free water (for 3-plex, use 46 µL) in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and leave the lid open. Instead, add another lid punctured with a needle to allow vapor to escape.",
    "Immediately freeze the tubes at -80 °C for 2 h, and lyophilize the tube for 4 h. Cover the lyophilization chamber with aluminum foil for protection from light. When reagents are dried, remove the punctured lids, close the original lid, and store the tubes with lyophilized reagents at 4 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Reagents can be lyophilized overnight, if necessary.\n7. Testing Lyophilized RT-LAMP Reagents on Urine and Mosquito Samples Containing Zika\nUse the following items from the kit (see the Table of Materials) for Zika: A 3D-printed observing box with orange filter (long pass filter, cut-on ~540 nm), 2 AAA batteries for observing box, lyophilized reaction tubes labeled ZV for Zika detection, and 1.1X rehydration Buffer in 1.5 mL screw top tubes.\nPrepare 50 mL of 1.1X rehydration buffer by mixing 5.5 mL of 10X isothermal amplification buffer that comes along with DNA Polymerase (see the Table of Materials), 3.3 mL of 100 mM MgSO4, 110 µL of 0.5 M DTT, and 41.09 mL of nuclease-free water. Mix well, aliquot 1 mL of this solution to 1.5 mL screw top tubes, and store at 4 °C until use.\nAdd 90 µL of 1.1X rehydration buffer to each reaction tube (0.5 mL). Ensure that the liquid fills the bottom of the tube containing the lyophilized reagents (dissolve them with mixing by shaking, then briefly spin down (1,000 x g)). Add 10 µL of urine sample spiked with viral RNA to the reaction tubes (see section 4.1 for details).\n\t\nIf testing mosquitoes, add a rectangle of Q-paper holding mosquito carcasses (as prepared in the steps described in sections 5.2 and 5.3), along with 10 µL purified water instead of urine samples.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, add 10 µL of saliva or serum samples instead of urine. If the samples are extracted DNA or RNA, add 2-5 µL of the sample into rehydrated mixture and complete with nuclease-free water to 10 µL of final sample volume.\nClose the lid of the reaction tubes. Place them in a heat block/bath (or incubator) pre-set at 65-68 °C. Incubate for 30-45 min, but no more than 1 h. After incubation, remove the tube from the heat. To prevent contamination of future assays, ensure that these tubes remain closed.\nPlace reaction tubes in the observing box; the temperature will fall to the ambient temperature (preferably 25 °C). Turn on the switch on the back of the observing box. Observe sample through the orange filter and capture the image by a cell phone camera which is held at a distance where the image fills 80% of the field of view.\n\tNOTE: Better visualization is achieved in low light environments.\nAfter visualization is completed, turn off the switch. Store the sealed tubes in the dark, preferably with refrigeration, if later visualization is needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
