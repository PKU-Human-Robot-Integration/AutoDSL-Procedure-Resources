    "Ethics statement: The research ethics boards of both the University of Manitoba and Kenyatta National Hospital/University of Nairobi approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.\n1. Preparation of Media and CMC Collection Tubes\nPrepare phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (137.93 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4). Autoclave for sterility. This can be stored at 4 ºC for several months.\nPre-aliquot 5 ml PBS into 50 ml falcon tube (one per sample to be collected) and store at 4 ºC until sample collection time.\nLabel 2-4 cryovials or 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes per sample to collect lavage for storage.\nPrepare cell culture media: RPMI 1640 + 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (final concentration 100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml and 250 ng/ml, respectively, with no FCS/FBS added.\n2. Collection of Cytobrush Samples\nCollection of cytobrush samples is a non-invasive procedure that must be performed by a trained MD or gynecologist.\nCollect cervical mononuclear cells (CMC) using both a cytobrush and a wooden or plastic scraper. Collect CMC from the participant under speculum examination by inserting the scraper and rotating around the cervical os (Figure 1). Insert the cytobrush into the endocervical os, rotate 360°, and immediately place both the cytobrush and scraper into the 50 ml falcon tube containing 5 ml of PBS.\nKeep samples on ice/at 4 ºC until processing. To maintain cell viability, process samples within 2 hr of collection.\nIf possible, collect matched blood samples in green top heparin vacutainers for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation to serve as a comparator/control for CMC analysis.\n3. Isolation of CMCs\nPerform sample processing in a biosafety level 2 laboratory, in a sterile biosafety cabinet with double gloves.",
    "During collection, CMC samples can become contaminated with blood. Exclude samples with visible blood contamination from the study in order to prevent confounding inclusion of PBMC in the final sample. Due to the low number of lymphocytes isolated from CMC samples, minor blood contamination can easily overwhelm the CMC lymphocyte component.\nVortex falcon tubes containing both the cytobrush and scraper for 45 sec to dissociate cells from the brushes. Samples may become foamy during this process; this is normal.\nUse the cytobrush to scrape any remaining material off the scraper, and discard the scraper into a bleach solution. To collect any cells remaining attached to the brush/scraper, use a fresh glove to squeeze the scraper between the thumb and forefinger. Slide down the brush, allowing the cells and PBS to be collected in the same 50 ml tube. Discard the cytobrush into a bleach solution, and discard the glove.\n\tIMPORTANT: Use a new glove for each sample.\nFit a 100 μm nylon cell strainer to a fresh 50 ml falcon tube. Using a transfer pipette, collect the PBS-cell suspension from the sample tube and filter through the strainer into the fresh tube.\nAdd 5 ml of RPMI 1640 to the original sample tube. Using the transfer pipette, wash the sides of the sample tube with the RPMI, and transfer through the filter to the new collection tube. Wash the bottom of the nylon filter with the RPMI as well.\nCentrifuge the samples for 10 min at 514 x g. It is crucial to leave the centrifuge brake off during this step, in order to prevent dislodging of the CMC pellet.",
    "Gently remove the supernatant from the tube, taking care to not disturb the pellet. Pellet size will be highly variable; in some samples, the pellet is quite large due to the presence of large numbers of epithelial cells, while in other cases, the pellet is barely visible and highly transparent.\nResuspend the pellet by gentle agitation of the falcon tube. Add 5 ml of PBS to wash the sample.\nCentrifuge again for 10 min at 514 x g with no centrifuge brake.\nCarefully discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet as above. The cells are ready for either cryopreservation (using a PBMC cryopreservation protocol), stimulation or flow cytometry phenotyping.\n4. CMC Surface Staining and Flow Cytometry\nResuspend the pellet from step 3.10 in 100 μl of blocking solution and transfer either into a 96-well plate or FACS tube. The blocking solution (to block Fcγ receptors) recipe is as follows: 1.8 μl mouse IgG (final concentration 0.2 μg/μl), 5 μl FBS and 93.2 μl FACS wash (PBS+2%FBS). Staining can be performed in a 96 well plate if pellet sizes are small enough, but may need to be performed in FACS tubes if pellets are routinely large. It is important to titrate antibodies accordingly.\nBlock the samples for 10 min on ice/at 4 °C.\nWash the cells with 100 μl of FACS Wash (PBS+2% FBS) in 96-well plates, or 500 μl in FACS tubes. Centrifuge at 600 x g for 10 min at 4 °C with the brake on low (or off, if a low brake setting is unavailable).",
    "Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet by agitation. Add viability Stain (Live Dead fixable viability dye). Prepare viability dye according to manufacturer’s instructions. It may need to be titrated for use in each lab/cytometer setup. Incubate for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C.\nWash the cells 100 μl/500 μl of PBS (for 96-well plate/FACS tubes). Centrifuge at 600 x g for 10 min with low/no brake. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells.\nIncubate the cells with the cocktail of surface marker antibodies, in a total volume of 100 μl. IMPORTANT: Optimize and titrate each flow cytometry panel prior to sample staining. Incubate cells for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C.\nRepeat step 4.5. if staining in a 96-well plate, transfer cells to a FACS tube and dilute to a final volume of 750 µl of FACS Wash containing 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (or CytoFix, diluted 1 in 4). Proceed to data acquisition on a flow cytometer.\n5. Collection and Preparation of Cervical Vaginal Lavage (CVL)\nPrior to cytobrush sampling, use a syringe to wash the endocervix with 2 ml of sterile PBS and aspirate the lavage from the posterior fornix.\nCollect the aspirated lavage sample into a 15 ml falcon tube and keep on ice/at 4 ºC until processing.\nCentrifuge sample at 400 x g for 7 min to remove cellular debris.\nCollect the supernatant, aliquot the sample into 1 ml or 500 μl aliquots, and store at -70 °C. Aliquots can be thawed for ELISA or bead array analysis of CVL proteins, but avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles.\nIf desired, resuspend the pellet of cellular debris in RNA Later to measure RNA expression by following the manufacturer’s protocol.\n6. Data Acquisition",
    "Prepare a set of compensation tubes that matches the antibody panel. Run the compensation tubes to adjust spectral overlap. Run the samples on any multicolor flow cytometer that is configured for the fluorochrome conjugated antibodies used in the panel.\nAcquire a PBMC sample first to adjust Forward Scatter (FSC) and Side Scatter (SSC) voltage in order to detect the lymphocyte population. Try to keep them at 100 on each axis on a linear scale. Running a PBMC control will make it significantly easier to find the CMC lymphocyte population.\nThe FSC threshold for CMC samples may need to be increased relative to PBMC samples due to smear up the SSC axis at low FSC values.\nVortex each tube before acquiring. Acquire the entire tube to maximize the number of lymphocyte gate events collected. Monitor the machine carefully to avoid clogging.\nExport the data into a flow cytometric analysis program such as FlowJo.\n7. Gating Strategy\nSelect Forward side scatter high (FSC-H)/Forward side scatter area (FSC-A) to determine the singlet population.\nSelect Time versus Fluorescent marker (as example FITC) to control for the quality of the acquisition. Change in flow rate may introduce artifacts in the data. Exclude any area that shows discrepancy in flow rate.\nIdentify the lymphocyte population on SSC-A/FSC-A plot. Use a PBMC control to facilitate the identification. Note that the CMC lymphocyte population might not be as clear as the PBMC control.\nGate on SSC-A/viability dye to exclude dead cells from live cells. Dead cells can non-specifically incorporate the antibodies, which will introduce artifacts.\nGate on the SSC-A/CD3 to identify the T cell population. From this gate, identify the CD4+ and CD8+ populations.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
