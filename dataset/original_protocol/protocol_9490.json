    "NOTE: Fix tissue for histological analysis at the same time that tissue is fixed for LM. Examine stained sections for morphological features that will guide later LM. When comparing mutant to wild-type, perform in situ hybridization or immunolocalization to define the domain where the gene of interest is expressed (in this case lg1).\n1. Tissue Fixation and Processing\nGrow flats of maize seedlings to two weeks old under standard conditions6.\nDissect shoot apices for lateral sections (Figure 4).\n\t\nExcise seedling just below the soil line.\nUsing a razor blade, remove thin slices from the base of the stem (cuts 1, Figure 4A) until an oval of culm encircled by one or two mature leaves is visible (Figure 4B).\nMake another cut approximately 10 mm above the base (cut 2, Figure 4A). This 10 mm segment will contain the SAM and young leaf primordia.\nTurn the 10 mm segment so the base is facing up. Make two cuts parallel to the lateral axis so that a slice of tissue 2-3 mm thick is obtained (cuts 3, and 4, Figure 4B). Discard the outer two portions and retain the central slice for fixation and embedding.\n\t\tNOTE: Outer leaves may be trimmed and discarded.\nFix tissue and process for embedding.\n\t\nEnsure that all materials to be used in subsequent steps are RNase free. Treat solutions with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) (1 ml DEPC per liter of solution. Incubate overnight with occasional shaking, and autoclave). Bake glassware in an oven at 200 °C or higher for at least 6 hr and treat plastic ware with RNase decontamination solution.",
    "Day 1: Immerse tissue slices in ~10 ml of Farmer's fix (3:1 Ethanol: Acetic acid) in glass vial on ice. After all samples have been dissected, apply vacuum to remove air bubbles and aid penetration of fixative. Hold under vacuum for 10 min then release the vacuum slowly. Replace fixative and incubate at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking.\nDay 2: Incubate in the following series of solutions, ~10 ml each, 1 hr each, all with gentle shaking; 85% ethanol at 4 °C, 95% ethanol at 4 °C, 100% ethanol at 4 °C, 100% ethanol at 4 °C, 100% ethanol at 4 °C, 1:1 ethanol: xylenes at room temperature, 100% xylenes at room temperature, 100% xylenes at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Xylenes are toxic by contact and inhalation. Work in a fume hood and use appropriate gloves.\nAdd paraffin tissue embedding medium pellets to approximately half volume of xylenes and incubate overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nDay 3: Transfer the vial to 60 °C oven until the pellets melt. Pour off solution and replace with fresh melted tissue embedding medium. Change the medium two more times during the day.\nDay 4: Change tissue embedding medium once in the morning. Return to 60 °C oven until afternoon.\nCast blocks\n\t\nPlace embedding molds on hot plate of tissue embedding station. Use forceps to transfer the tissue samples to the embedding molds with the cut surface facing down. Top up the mold with melted paraffin and place the embedding ring on top of the mold. Transfer to a cold plate until paraffin has solidified. Store the paraffin blocks at 4 °C in an airtight container with silica gel.\n2. Sectioning and Slide Preparation\nCut 10 µm sections on a microtome25.",
    "Examine ribbons and choose median sections. Median sections are those that include the SAM, which appears as a dome of cells surrounded by leaf primordia.\nMount sections on slides.\n\t\nPlace slides that are suitable for LM (either RNase free or baked) on 42 °C slide warmer and apply several drops of 50% ethanol solution to cover the slide.\nFloat sections on ethanol solution until the sections have expanded.\n\t\tNOTE: Floating sections on ethanol solution rather than water keeps RNA in a precipitated state reducing RNA degradation.\nTilt slide and remove excess ethanol solution by aspiration with a disposable transfer pipette. Use lint-free wipes to wick away any additional ethanol solution.\nDry slides at 42 °C for several hours or overnight. Store slides at 4 °C in an airtight container with silica gel.\nDeparaffinize slides on the day of use.\n\t\nPrepare three glass Coplin jars containing; 100% xylenes (xylenes I), 100% xylenes (xylenes II), and 100% ethanol (~50 ml of each solution).\nUsing clean forceps to transfer slides, immerse slides in xylenes I for 2 min, xylenes II for 2 min, and 100% ethanol for 1 min.\nDrain slides on lint-free wipes and air dry at room temperature.\n3. Microdissection of Blade, Ligule and Sheath Samples from Plastochron 7 Leaf Primordia\nSecure the slides on stage of LM microscope. Use five or six slides for each replicate, utilizing five sections per slide.\n\tNOTE: Tissue pooling for a single replicate is illustrated in Figure 5.\nExamine slides and identify the five most median sections on each slide, using the SAM apex as the central reference point.\n\tNOTE: This can be done at low magnification, usually a 5X objective is sufficient.",
    "Using 10X or 20X objective, identify the position of the ligule on the plastochron 7 leaf primordium of each section. The ligule will be visible as a bump protruding from the adaxial surface of the leaf primordium. Mark this position using the drawing tool of the LM software; select the pencil icon, move the cursor to the appropriate position and click and drag the mouse to draw.\n\tNOTE: A 10X or 20X objective is appropriate for this and subsequent steps. When using lateral sections, the two sides of each leaf primordium will be present in each section (Figure 2A).\nUsing the ruler tool and the rectangular drawing tool, measure 100 µm high rectangles centered on the ligule of each section (red rectangles, Figure 2A, 2B). These will be the \"Ligule\" sample.\n\t\nTo use the ruler tool; select the ruler icon, move the cursor to one end of the object to be measured, click and drag to measure the object. The length of the ruler will be shown on the screen.\nTo draw a rectangle; select the rectangle icon, move the cursor to a point that will be one corner of the rectangle, click and drag to draw a rectangle of the appropriate size. Alternatively, select the straight line drawing tool and draw four straight lines.\nMeasure 100 µm rectangles positioned 50 µm above and below the \"Ligule\" rectangle.",
    "NOTE: These will be the \"Blade\" and \"Sheath\" samples, respectively (green and blue rectangles, Figure 2A, 2B). Based on our histological data, a 100 µm rectangle encompasses the entire ligule region. Equivalent sized portions of blade and sheath were chosen to ensure that similar amounts of tissue were collected for each. Spacers of 50 µm were used to ensure that no ligule region tissue is inadvertently included in the blade or sheath microdissections.\nMicrodissect measured rectangles (Figure 2D-2F)7,8,9, collecting Ligule, Blade and Sheath samples in separate tubes. Use the laser cut function to cut through the tissue section along the outline of the selected domain. Use the catapult function to propel the rectangle of tissue off the slide and into the lid of the tube (Figure 2D-2F).\n4. Microdissection of Blade, Ligule and Sheath Adaxial Epidermal Samples from Plastochron 7 Leaf Primordia\nSelect sections and use the ruler tool to measure 100 µm high segments centered on the plastochron 7 ligule, as described in section 3 (above).\n\t\nSelect only the adaxial epidermal cells of each 100 µm high \"Blade\" and \"Sheath\" segment (green and blue selections, Figure 2C) by outlining with the drawing tool. The epidermis is the outer cell layer; the adaxial side is the one closest to the SAM.\nFor the \"Ligule\" sample, select only the cells of the emerging ligule bump as described in Section 3.3 (red selection, Figure 2C).\nMicrodissect selected regions, collecting Blade, Ligule and Sheath epidermis samples in separate tubes, as described in section 3.5.\n5. Microdissection of Plastochron 6 Leaf Primordia from  lg1-R and Wild-type Siblings\nGrow segregating families of mutant (lg1-R) and wild-type plants.",
    "Fix and process shoot apices for LM, as described in sections 1.2-1.4. Fix wild-type and mutant shoot apices in separate vials in order to keep them separate. Samples from the same planting should be fixed and processed for in situ hybridization.\nDetermine where lg1 is transcribed in wild-type siblings, by performing lg1 in situ hybridization6,26,27. Measure position of lg1 transcript accumulation from base of leaf primordium in multiple samples (Figure 1E).\nBased on in situ hybridization data, choose portion of leaf primordium that encompasses the region where lg1 is transcribed. In this case, 400-900 µm from the base of plastochron 6 leaf primordia (purple rectangles, Figure 2A).\nMicrodissect selected portion of leaf primordia, as described in section 3.5, collecting lg1-R and wild-type samples in separate tubes.\n6. Apply RNA Extraction Buffer\nApply 50 µl RNA extraction buffer to microdissected tissue and proceed with RNA extraction. Continue with RNA extraction, RNA amplification, library construction, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis as described in reference6.\nSubscription Required.
