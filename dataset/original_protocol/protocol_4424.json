    "Preparation of Human Foreskin Fibroblasts cell culture in 6-well plates Plate HFFs cells in complete DMEM medium and culture them for 4 days at 37 °C in presence of CO2. HFFs have to be at 100% confluence in each well (8 x 105 cells) before staining.    Staining of HFFs   Wash twice the cells culture with 1 ml 1x DPBS.    Fix cells with 1 ml formaldehyde diluted at 2.5% in DPBS 1x for 20 min at 4 °C.    Incubate 20 min, in the dark and at RT, the cells with 1 ml of Hoescht diluted 1/50,000 in 1x DPBS.    Wash twice the cells culture with 1 ml 1x DPBS.    Add 1 ml 1x DPBS.   Stored at 4 °C until addition of the stained homogenized brain.  Note: The stained cells are stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 24 h.      Isolation of brains from infected mice or rats   Anesthesize animal with isofluoran and euthanize it by cervical dislocation.    Soak the head with 70% (v/v) ethanol.   Cut the skin at the base of skull and remove it as much as possible.   Cut with scissors the dorsal and lateral part of the skull and take the top off.   Collect the brain tissue in 5 ml DPBS 1x solution.      Brains homogenization Put each mouse brain in 2 ml DPBS 1x into a glass homogenizer, homogenize at RT and adjust final volume to 4 ml. For rat brain, homogenize in 4 ml and adjust to 8 ml final.  Note: Brains can be stored at 4 °C until the staining for no more than 2 days.    Brains staining   Prepare 5x lysis buffer and proteinase K at 8 U/ml (stock at 800 U/ml, 1/100 dilution in 5x lysis buffer just before use).",
    "For mice, take 1 ml of homogenized brain (¼ brain), add 398 µl of 5x lysis buffer, 2 µl of proteinase K (see step E1, so final concentration at 0.008 U/ml) and 600 µl of 1x DPBS (final volume of 2 ml). For rats, take 2 ml of homogenized brain (¼ brain), add 995 µl of 5x lysis buffer, 5 µl of proteinase K (see step E1, so final concentration at 0.008 U/ml) and 2 ml of 1x DPBS (final volume of 5 ml).    Incubate at 56 °C for 15 min, homogenize every 5 min by vortexing.   Stop the proteinase K activity by adding PMSF to a final concentration of 2 mM (stock at 200 mM), homogenize and incubate at RT for 5 min.   Centrifuge the sample for 15 min at 1,250 x g (RT).   Gently eliminate the supernatant by pipetting.   Resuspend in 1 ml of Dolichos biflorus lectin diluted at 1/250 in DPBS 1x (996 µl 1x DPBS + 4 µl of Dolichos biflorus lectin).   Incubate 30 min at RT in a mechanical wheel placed in the dark.   Add 3 ml DPBS 1x and homogenize to wash the sample.   Centrifuge 15 min at 1,250 x g (RT).   Gently eliminate the supernatant by pipetting.   Resuspend each sample in 1 ml in DPBS 1x and transfer onto Hoescht-stained HFFs (see part A and B of the procedure) by pipetting (1 ml/well). Note: It is important to transfer the homogenized brain pellet onto HFF cells to facilitate microscope focus when there are no or very few cysts.      Count the cysts using epifluorescence microscopy (Representative data) Note: Samples can be stored at 4 °C until microscope observation for no more than 10 days. To know the cysts quantity in entire brain, multiply the counted number by 4."
