    "Note: Gloves should be worn during all steps of this protocol to protect your samples from phosphatase contamination. Preparing control samples for assessing quality and elution profile of ATP, GTP and cGAMPNote: Keep everything on ice for this step.Mix the ATP sample, GTP sample, and cGAMP sample as described below in 1.5 ml tubes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181016/20181016023928_4768.jpgThe samples can be stored at -80 °C and thawed immediately before centrifugation and subsequent analysis on the RESOURCE Q 1 ml column (see Procedure D).Dilution of DNA fragments and preparation of enzyme master mixNotes: Procedures B and C in this protocol are performed without pausing. Place the aluminum cooling block on ice for 30 min before starting Procedure B and keep it on ice throughout Procedures B and C. Keep everything on ice during this step, mix the enzyme master mix on ice, and keep the enzyme master mix on ice. Dilute the DNA fragments you are testing to a concentration of 5 ng/μl in ultrapure water or buffer NE.Mix enzyme master mix for the desired number of reactions according to the table below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181016/20181016023852_0186.jpgNotes: Enzyme master mix can be prepared for any number of reactions simply by upscaling the recipe. It is highly recommended that you make a surplus of the enzyme master mix. For example, if you want to make four reactions you should multiply the recipe for one reaction by five. The number of reactions that you will make is the number of DNA species you want to test plus a negative control with no DNA. Mix the master mix well by pipetting carefully up and down several times using a pipette with a suitable volume. Do not introduce air bubbles or make it foam!",
    "In vitro cGAS reactionImmediately after preparing the enzyme master mix, place one PCR tube per reaction into the aluminum cooling block (remember a tube for the DNA-free negative control).Pipette 160 μl enzyme master mix into each PCR tube.Add 40 μl of a given DNA species/fragment (5 ng/μl) into a corresponding PCR tube and pipette up and down ten times to ensure mixing (avoid air bubbles).For the negative control, add 40 μl of ultrapure water or buffer NE depending on what the DNA fragments are suspended in.Note: Addition of the DNA to the PCR tubes should be done swiftly but without forming foam in the samples. The cGAS catalyzed reaction is not occurring to any noticeable extent while the samples are kept on ice. Centrifuge the PCR tubes for 30-60 s on the small SpectrafugeTM to remove any drops sitting on the side of the tube and to remove any air bubbles.Place the PCR tubes back in the cooling block.The  T100TM  Thermal Cycler PCR machine is programmed to 2 h at 37 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 12 °C for indefinite. The lid heating is set to 105 °C and the sample volume is set to maximum (100 μl).Transfer the PCR tubes to the PCR machine and start the program.When the 2 h at 37 °C and 10 min at 95 °C has passed, move the PCR tubes to the -80 °C freezer, where they are stored until the analysis (Procedure D).Analyzing samples on RESOURCE Q 1 mlNote: The reactions are analyzed one at a time. The ATP, GTP, and cGAMP samples prepared in Procedure A are analyzed by continuing from Step D3.Thaw a single PCR tube and transfer all 200 μl to a 1.5 ml tube.Add 800 μl buffer A to the 1.",
    "5 ml tube and mix well.Centrifuge the now diluted reaction sample at 12,100 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Prepare the ÄKTApurifier 10 and RESOURCE Q 1 ml column.Wash pump A in buffer A and pump B in buffer B.Wash the entire flow path including the 2 ml sample loop in buffer A with a flow of 1 ml/min until the conductivity is stable and below 2.5 mS/cm.Connect the RESOURCE Q 1 ml column to the system and equilibrate the column in buffer A.Fix the injection needle to a 1 ml syringe and draw 900 μl of the diluted reaction sample into the syringe without disturbing the pellet that might have appeared after centrifugation.Inject 800 μl onto the sample loop.Use the Unicorn software to program the ÄKTApurifier 10 to do the following (see Table S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20181007/3055 Supplementary File Table S1.docx] for full variable list):Program:Wave length 1 = 280 nmWave length 2 = 254 nmWave length 3 = 215 nm (optional)Flow rate: 0.5 ml/minEquilibrate with 2 column volumes buffer AEmpty loop with 10 mlLinear gradient from 0% to 50% buffer B over 25 column volumesWash column with 100% buffer B over 5 column volumesRe-equilibrate with 5 column volumes buffer ANo fractionationNote: The maximal pressure for the column is 1.5 MPa but the pressure generated by the column during this application is usually less than 0.5 MPa. We run the chromatography at 4 °C but it will also work at room temperature. When the run is finished the next reaction sample can be analyzed by repeating Procedure D."
