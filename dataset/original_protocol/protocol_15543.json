    "All animal procedures were approved and carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Academia Sinica. Details of the research tools can be found in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation of recording chamber\nPrepare a semi-hexagonal tank, a base plate, and a head stage (Figure 1A; Supplementary Files 1-3). The head stage consists of two metal posts attached to a circular plate. The circular plate contains grooves that can be locked onto the base plate. After being locked together, the head stage and the base plate are laid at the bottom of the semi-hexagonal tank.\nPlace the semi-hexagonal tank on the experimental platform of the microscope. The platform should be able to move in the X and Y directions without hitting the limit of the translation stage.\nAim the 810 nm infrared (IR) light and the camera to the head stage for behavioral recording. Ensure that the field of view of the camera is large enough to fit an adult zebrafish.\n\t\nTo prevent the two-photon laser and the visual stimulus from interfering with behavioral recording, set up an 875 nm short-pass filter and a 700 nm long-pass filter in front of the camera, respectively.\nTo present the visual stimulus, attach back-projection films to the inner side of the three walls of the semi-hexagonal tank (Figure 1A).\nAim the three projectors at the three surfaces of the tank. The three images should be aligned to form a continuous visual scene. To prevent projector lights from contaminating the calcium fluorescence signal, place a neutral density filter and a red color filter (600 nm, long-pass) in front of each projector, and place a band-pass filter (510/80 nm) in front of the photomultiplier tube (PMT).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65526/65526fig1v8.jpg",

Head restraint surgery\nPrepare an Ω-shaped head bar (Figure 1B; Supplementary File 4) for the zebrafish head restraint. To do this, attach a piece of oil-based modeling clay to a three-axis micromanipulator. Ensure that the clay is solid enough to hold the head bar, but soft enough to detach from the head bar after head restraint.\nInsert an arm of the head bar into the clay and orient the head bar horizontally (Figure 1C). This will ensure that the later attachment of the head bar onto the zebrafish will be level.\n\tNOTE: The head bar can be made of titanium (24 mg) or stainless steel (43 mg) and can be reused for multiple experiments. The head bar material does not affect the behavior of adult zebrafish (weight ranges from 300-1,000 mg) under a head restraint.\nPrepare the cannon, a hollow tube for holding the fish body in place during surgery (Figure 1D).",
    "Prepare 0.03% and 0.01% tricaine methanesulfonate (TMS; see Table of Materials) in fish tank water. This will be used to anesthetize and maintain the fish in a sedated state during surgery.\nPrepare four tissue swabs to remove excess skin and water from the attachment sites on the skull. To prepare each swab, cut a paper towel into a 3 cm square and fold along its diagonal to produce a tube-like structure. Twist the ends of the tube into a fine point. The attachment site is very small, so a fine point allows finer control of the swab.\nPrepare a fish loading module for the micromanipulator (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: The module consists of two steel posts held together by a right-angle post clamp. One post attaches to the micromanipulator, while the other post holds a rotating post clamp that carries the fish. The module is used to position the fish onto the head stage with fine control. The rotating post clamp serves as a pitch adjuster to change the pitch angle of the fish.\nAnesthetize the fish with 0.03% TMS in fish tank water. Throughout the following steps, use a syringe to deliver 0.01% TMS in fish tank water to the mouth in short pulses every 90 s. Water flow from the perfusion should induce gill movement. This will allow the fish to survive for more than 40 min during surgery.\n\tNOTE: Tg[neuroD:GCaMP6f] is used due to its broad expression of the calcium indicator in the forebrain at both the larval and adult stages10.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, use gravity perfusion to provide constant water flow to the mouth during periods in surgery where both hands are occupied.\nWrap the fish into a capsule (Figure 2A) that holds the fish inside the cannon.",
    "Wrap the anesthetized fish in a piece of moist paper tissue starting from the tip of the tail to around 1 mm caudal to the gill. Ensure that the wrapping is tight to prevent sliding of the fish out of the tissue.\nWrap a soft plastic tubing with a longitudinal slit (e.g., a medium-sized heat-shrink tubing cut open) around the paper tissue to cover the fish from the end of the tail to around 2 mm caudal to the gill. The tubing ensures that the fish's body remains straight throughout the surgery.\nWrap a paper towel around the tubing to a diameter that is roughly similar to the diameter of the cannon.\nWrap a soft plastic tube cut from the bulb of a plastic transfer pipette around the paper towel. This ensures that the capsule can be loaded smoothly into the cannon.\nLoad the fish into the cannon.\nUse a scalpel to remove the skin covering the attachment sites, two triangular areas of the skull rostrolateral to the cerebellum and above the gills (Figure 2B), then remove the skin covering the region between the attachment sites. Use tissue swabs to dry out the attachment sites and clear out any remaining skin.\n\t\nUse an adjustable platform to support the head during skin removal, but the platform must not contact the eyes to avoid eye injury during the operation.\n\t\tNOTE: Thorough removal of the skin at the attachment sites is crucial in reducing motion artifacts during imaging.\nApply a drop of tissue glue (see Table of Materials) at the center of each attachment site using a 10 µL pipette tip.",
    "NOTE: Tissue glue covers the attachment sites and dries out quickly. The tissue glue provides a bonding interface between the skull and the dental cement used to glue the head bar, and prevents water from the gills from reaching the attachment site.\nPut the fish body in an upright position and position the head bar slightly above and caudal to the attachment sites in preparation for head bar gluing.\nPrepare dental cement (see Table of Materials) and use it immediately to glue the head bar to the skull (Figure 2C). The procedure is time sensitive and must be done within 45 s.\n\t\nMix one small spoon of polymer with four drops of quick monomer and one drop of catalyst V. Stir the mixture evenly for 15 s.\nUse a micropipette and a 10 µL pipette tip to apply the mixture onto the attachment sites and the region between the sites. Avoid covering the gills and the eyes.\nGently press the head bar onto the cement using the micromanipulator. Cover the head bar with the remaining cement.\nWait for 12 min to allow curing of the dental cement. Avoid water contact with the cement.\nTo improve optical access to the forebrain for calcium imaging, remove the skin above the telencephalon. Skin removal can be done in 3 min with five cuts using a scalpel (Figure 2D). Make sure that lipid droplets adhering to the surface of the skulls are removed.\nAfter curing, remove the clay from the head bar.\nTransfer the entire capsule from the cannon to the pitch adjuster in the fish loading module of the micromanipulator.",
    "Use the micromanipulator to position the fish. The head bar should be positioned on top of the metal posts of the head stage. Slightly increase the pitch angle of the fish so that the surface of the forebrain can be better aligned to the optical plane during two-photon imaging.\nGlue the head bar to the metal posts with ultraviolet (UV)-curable glue. A 15 s UV exposure is sufficient for curing.\nPull out the fish from the capsule and lock the head stage onto the base plate within the semi-hexagonal tank.\nImmerse the animal in fish tank water. The fish should start breathing and recover from anesthesia within 1-2 min.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, use syringe perfusion to deliver fresh water to the mouth.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65526/65526fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Key steps during head restraint surgery.

Two-photon imaging\nTurn on the laser and wait for 30 min for the power to stabilize. Set the wavelength to 920 nm and power to around 50 mW at the sample.\n\tNOTE: The laser beam controlled by the resonant scanner moves slowly at the turnaround points of the scan path. To prevent tissue damage, a Pockels cell is used to reduce laser power at the turnaround points.",
    "Place the recording chamber containing the head-restrained zebrafish on the experimental platform (Figure 3A). The platform should be able to move in the X and Y directions without hitting the limit of the translation stage.\nPlace the objective lens as close as possible to the forebrain surface. The objective lens should be aimed at the front edge of the pupil (Figure 3B).\nOpen the laser shutter and enable the PMT. Gradually elevate the objective lens (~1 mm) until the dorsal forebrain is revealed in the fluorescence image (Figure 3C).\nTo increase the number of neurons recorded, use a piezo actuator to acquire images at multiple depths (six image planes, 15 µm apart). This will increase the data yield at the expense of the frame rate. Enable fast Z-axis scanning to control the piezo actuator (uniform mode, number of slices = 6, step size = 15 µm, waveform = sawtooth, flyback time = 4 ms, actuator lag = 8 ms).\nFor behavior recording, turn on the 810 nm infrared (IR) lights on both sides of the tank. Adjust the angle to illuminate the entire body, which should be clearly visible in the camera.\nTurn on the projectors.\nStart recording data.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65526/65526fig3v2.jpg",
