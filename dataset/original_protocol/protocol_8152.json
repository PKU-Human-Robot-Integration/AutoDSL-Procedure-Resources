    "Prior to beginning any research procedures, written consent should be obtained from the parent and verbal consent should be obtained from the child for all study procedures.\nNOTE: See Figure 2 for an overview of the procedures.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60200/60200fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Overview of protocol. Each square represents one day. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60200/60200fig2large.jpg]\n1. Nap promotion condition\nEnsure that the nap promotion condition is counterbalanced with the wake promotion condition across participants as discussed below.\nSchedule the nap promotion condition to begin approximately one hour before the child's typical nap period to allow time to apply PSG and to conduct the visuospatial memory task. Ensure that the time between immediate and delayed recall are the same between the wake promotion and nap promotion conditions.\nExplain the procedures for this session to children and parents using age-appropriate materials.\n\tNOTE: Age appropriate materials include story books or short videos of another child undergoing the same procedures.\nApply polysomnography equipment (see section 3).\nConduct the encoding and the immediate memory assessment for the visuospatial memory task (see section 4).\nHave the child use the restroom and then initiate the child's typical pre-nap routine.\n\t\nAllow the parent/caregiver to put the child to sleep as they usually would. Interfere as little as possible because most children fall asleep faster when provided with their normal routine.\nAllow the child to nap utilizing their typical nap location.\nUtilize nap promotion techniques, but only when necessary as these have proven less successful in the home if they deviate too far from the child's normal routine.\n\t\tNOTE: Nap promotion techniques include using a weighted blanket, rubbing the participant's back, wrapping the child in a blanket (similar to swaddling), progressive muscle relaxation, and playing soothing music.",
    "Ensure that the amount of time the child sleeps in the nap promotion condition matches the amount of time they play in the wake promotion condition.\n\tNOTE: If the nap promotion condition is first, allow the child to wake up naturally and use this duration to set the duration of the awake session. If the wake promotion condition is first, use this duration to determine the length of the nap. If the nap exceeds this time, wake the child as naturally as possible by opening the door, walking around outside the bedroom, and gradually speaking louder.\nConduct the delayed recall assessment for the visuospatial memory task, approximately 15−30 min after the child wakes to avoid sleep inertia.\nCollect child and experimenter rating for Visual Sleepiness Scale (VSS)26 and Visual Mood Scale (VMS)27.\nRemove PSG electrodes.\n2. Wake promotion condition\nEnsure that the wake promotion condition is counterbalanced with the nap promotion condition discussed above.\nSchedule the wake promotion condition to begin approximately one hour before the child's typical nap period to equate time of day across conditions. Ensure that the time between immediate and delayed recall are approximate the same between the wake promotion and nap promotion conditions.\nExplain the procedures for this session to children and parents using age-appropriate materials.\nApply PSG electrodes (see section 3) in order to equate the wake and nap promotion conditions.\n\tNOTE: Although sleep is not expected, this equates conditions and can be used to verify the absence of sleep if in doubt.\nConduct the encoding and the immediate memory assessment for the visuospatial memory task (see section 4).\nHave the child use the restroom and then proceed to the location that they typically nap.",
    "Do not allow the child to nap, instead, have the child play quietly with non-stimulating toys in the same location as their typical nap.\n\t\tNOTE: Acceptable non-stimulating toys include small sensorimotor toys such as wax sticks and age-appropriate interlocking plastic bricks.\nHave the child play for their typical nap length or for the time they slept during the nap promotion condition (see step 1.7 for additional information).\nRecord any unusual activity such as talking, leaving the room, and playing with toys that are not provided.\nEnsure that the amount of time the child sleeps in the nap promotion condition matches the amount of time they play in the wake promotion condition.\nConduct the delayed recall assessment for the visuospatial memory task, approximately 15−30 min after the child is finished playing in order to keep delay time similar between conditions.\nCollect child and experimenter rating for VSS26 and VMS27.\nRemove PSG electrodes.\n3. Polysomnography (PSG)\nPreparation\n\t\nFacilitate PSG electrode application by having the child engage in a quiet activity such as reading a book, playing with playdough, eating a snack if they are hungry, or watching a short movie.\n\t\tNOTE: If a movie is used, ensure that the movie is age appropriate but does not elicit rowdiness in the child (e.g., popular child-friendly animated films or shows).\nAccessibility to a parent or guardian is not required. However, for shy and tentative children ensure that trusted caregivers are available.\n\t\tNOTE: For a small number of children, parents and guardians may be distracting instead of helpful. If this is the case, ask the parent if they would be willing to step out of the child's sight.\nCollect head measurements.\n\t\nUse a flexible tape measure and china marker to mark locations for subsequent electrode application.",
    "Measure the distance from the inion to nasion and place a mark at the halfway point. Measure the distance from preauricular notch in one ear to the preauricular notch in the other ear and place another mark at the halfway point. The intersection of these two marks is the \"Reference\" point (CZ).\nMeasure 10% of the inion to nasion distance up from the inion. Then measure out 10% of the preauricular notch to preauricular notch measurement from this point on either side. Make two marks, one on each side (O3 and O4).\nMeasure 20% of the preauricular notch to preauricular notch measurement from the reference point on either side of the head. Make two marks, one on each side (C3 and C4).\nMeasure 20% of the inion to nasion distance up from the reference point. Then measure out 20% of the preauricular notch to preauricular notch measurement from this point on either side. Make two marks, one on each side (F3 and F4).\nPrepare one electrode at a time for placement.\n\t\nClean each electrode location using an alcohol swab. Exfoliate using a slightly abrasive gel and then remove any residual cleaning material.\nFill each electrode using electrode cream.\n\t\t\nFor electrodes placed where hair is present, apply an additional drop of electrode cream to a gauze square and place it on the back of the electrode.\nFor electrodes placed on the face, use medical tape to adhere the electrode to the skin.\nPlace an electrode on each corresponding EEG, EOG, and EMG location.\n\t\nPlace an electrode on each marked location on the scalp (CZ, O3, O4, C3, C4, F3, and F4).\nPlace one electrode on each mastoid (small bony process behind the ear) and one in the center of the forehead.",
    "Place one EOG electrode adjacent to each eye. Place one of these electrodes slightly superior to the outside of the right eye (termed ROC) and one to the outside and slightly inferior to the left eye (termed LOC).\nPlace two EMG electrodes around the chin area. Place one electrode on the right cheek just above the smile line. Place the other on the left side just above where the chin meets the neck, adjacent to the esophagus. Find the second location by having the participant say the word \"milk\" out loud while feeling for the location where muscle contractions in the neck and chin are maximal.\nAttach electrodes to the recording device and initiate recording.\nRecord impedance readings for all electrodes. Ensure all electrodes pass the impedance test.\n\tNOTE: Some devices may note a 'Pass' or 'Fail', while other devices may give numeric values. In the latter, impedances under 25 kΩ are acceptable. If an impedance fails or is too high, remove and replace the batteries. If this does not amend the issue, reapply that electrode.\nAt the completion of each conditions, remove the PSG electrodes.\n\t\nFor electrodes applied in the hair, soak the location of the electrode with a water-based spray. Allow the spray to sit for about one minute then remove the electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: Detangling hair spray is highly effective for the purpose of removing hair electrodes.\nFor electrodes applied with tape, typically on the face and mastoids, use a cotton pad with baby oil applied to it to saturate the tape. When the tape is completely covered in baby oil, gently pull the tape up from the corners.\n4. Visuospatial memory task",
    "Administer nine to-be-remembered stimuli arranged in a 3 x 3 matrix to children younger than 44 months of age. Administer the 12 to-be-remembered stimuli arranged in a 3 x 4 matrix to children older than 44 months of age.\n\tNOTE: If a child assigned to the 12-item matrix is too challenged, the 9-item matrix can be used. Likewise, if it is evident that the 9-item matrix is too easy, the 12-item matrix can be used to avoid ceiling effects. This is justified because within-subject accuracy is of the variable of interest and not raw scores. Stimuli are typically cartoon-like pictures of common images (e.g., bear, car, scissors) arranged in a matrix and presented on a laptop screen. There are two sets of stimuli. This allows the task to be counterbalanced across the two conditions (i.e., nap versus wake promotion) so that children do not receive the same pictures in both conditions.\nAdminister the task in three phases: encoding, immediate recall, and delayed recall. For each phase allow the child to answer each question at their own pace.\n\tNOTE: Typical durations are: 6 min for the encoding phase, 2 min for the immediate recall phase, and 2 min for the delayed recall phase.\n\t\nIn the encoding phase, direct the child to identify each image by name, then instruct the child to remember their location of each item on the grid. Following encoding, the cards are replaced with 'blank' images and the child must then locate the position of each image until they reach an encoding score ≥75%.\n\t\tNOTE: A threshold of 75% was chosen based on studies in young adults28,29,30 and reflects a point when learning is clearly reached but not at ceiling.",
    "During this block, participants receive visual feedback from the task after each response. After the child selects an image location, reveal the associated image, informing the child whether that was the correct or incorrect location.\nProvide verbal feedback on performance to motivate the child but ensure that the amount of feedback is consistent across both conditions. When the child succeeds at locating an image use language like \"Great job, you got that one!\" When a child fails use language that highlights the child's effort (e.g., \"Whoops! Not quite but good try! Let's see if you can get the next one.\").\nProvide children who are assigned to the 12-item matrix that cannot pass encoding after 4 rounds with an opportunity to stretch, do jumping jacks, and move for about 5 min. If the child still cannot pass encoding after an additional 2 rounds, restart encoding with the 9-item matrix.\nProvide children assigned to the 9-item matrix who receive an encoding score of 100% on the first round with the encoding task for the 12-item matrix. If they do not go through all the necessary steps to drop back to the 9-item matrix, use the 12-item matrix for the following two phases.\nDuring the immediate recall phase, present the images again, one at a time, and ask the child to recall the corresponding location. Do not provide visual or verbal feedback, and only probe each item once. However, do provide feedback on effort (i.e., \"Good job giving your best effort\").\nConduct the delayed recall phase immediately after the wake or sleep condition.\n\t\tNOTE: This phase is identical to the immediate recall phase.",
    "At times children will become fussy during the delayed recall phase. If this happens, entice the child to complete the task with a prize or by offering more time to watch their movie during PSG removal. During this time do not allow the child to play with toys or engage in other tasks until the memory task is complete.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60200/60200fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Examples of screen displays during the visuospatial memory task.

Actigraphy\nProgram the activity watch.\n\tNOTE: The activity watch is sampled at 32 Hz, with a sensitivity of <0.01 g. Activity is stored in 15-s epochs.\nProvide each participant with a pre-programmed activity watch and instructions. Tell the parent that the watch should always be worn. Highlight that it is waterproof so there is no reason to remove the device.\n\t\nInstruct the child to wear the watch on their non-dominant hand continuously.\nInstruct the parent to press the button on the side of the watch face every time their child attempts to sleep, and then again when they wake.\n\t\tNOTE: This generates an event marker in the data which assists with scoring actigraphy.\nProvide the parent with a sleep diary (similar to a log or spreadsheet) on which they can record sleep times and watch removal.\n\tNOTE: This also assists with scoring actigraphy.\n\t\nIn the sleep diary, ask the parent to provide a complete log of all sleep for the number of days that the activity watch will be worn, including the time that the child goes to bed and when the child wakes up. The parent should provide this information for both naps and regular overnight sleep. Additionally, ask the parent to provide information about any time when the watch is removed.\n6. Data analysis",
    "Visuospatial memory task\n\t\nCalculate accuracy for each recall phase as the percent of items recalled.\nCalculate change in recall over the nap and wake intervals as follows.\n\t\t\nCalculate change in recallnap by subtracting immediate recall accuracy (before nap) from delayed recall accuracy (after nap).\nCalculate change in recallwake by subtracting immediate recall accuracy (before wake) from delayed recall accuracy (after wake).\nPSG\n\t\nCharacterize sleep stages in accordance with the standard scoring criteria (e.g., The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events v. 2.5).\nDetect sleep spindles at C3 using specialized software by marking spindle onsets and offsets.\nVerify sleep stages and spindle onsets and offsets with second trained researcher. In the event the scorings are not concordant, have a third trained scorer make the consensus decision.\nAnalyze spindle density using specialized software and an in-house MATLAB code based on previous studies31. In brief, filter EEG data from 0.5−35 Hz. Consider the maximum voltage between the identified spindle onset and offset the peak spindle amplitude. Use a fast Fourier transform of each spindle to identify the peak spectral frequency between 9−15 Hz24,32.\nActigraphy\n\t\nScore activity watch data using specialized software following standardized protocols20.\n\t\tNOTE: Multiple days and nights of data are required to ensure reliability of the data. At minimum, participants need at least three days and three nights of actigraphy data (days and nights do not need to be consecutive); however, 5 nights is preferable, particularly when these data are of primary interest33.\nUse sleep diary information and event markers (button presses) to verify sleep onset and offset.\n\t\tNOTE: These two items must be within 20 min of each other in order to score the start and end of a rest interval.",
    "If a participant is missing sleep diary information, event markers, or the diary and event markers are not within 20 min of each other, determine sleep onset and offset manually32: determine sleep onset by the first three minutes of continuous sleep33 and determine sleep offset by the last five minutes of continuous sleep34.\nSubscription Required.
