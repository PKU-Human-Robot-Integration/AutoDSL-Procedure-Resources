  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois. All animals were housed in animal care facilities approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Every attempt was made to minimize the number of animals used and to reduce suffering at all stages of the study.\n1. Preparation for and Removal of Brain from Mouse for Slicing\nPrepare for perfusion and slice incubation.\n\t\nApproximately 30 min before slicing, prepare high sucrose cutting solution and low calcium aCSF for incubation of the slice prior to recording or imaging.\nLay out all necessary tools (large blunt end scissors, small spring scissors, anatomic forceps, large scissors or guillotine, iris scissors, jewelers forceps, 10 ml syringe with 27G x 1/2 inch needle, small piece of 1 cm x 2 cm filter paper, and a broken tipped Pasteur pipette for slice transfer) for perfusion and slicing, and prepare perfusion tray.\nSet up incubating chamber with oxygenated aCSF in a 32 oC water bath and a culture dish filled with cutting solution.\nPrepare cutting stage for slicing.\n\t\nCut a small piece of 3% agar approximately 1 cm3 to use as a backstop for the brain and 1.5 cm x 1.5 mm x 3 mm for a bump to be used to prop up the IC.\nGlue the backstop onto the stage with cyanoacrylate adhesive as well as the bump on the right side of the backstop such that they form an 80o angle.\nRemove the brain.\n\t\nDeeply anesthetize a p12-p20 (ideally p14-18) mouse with ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylaxine 3 mg/kg (or comparable ethics committee approved procedure).\n\t\tNote: Confirm proper anesthesia level via lack of response to toe pinch. As the animal is under anesthesia briefly, ophthalmic ointment is unnecessary.",
    "Using blunt end scissors, expose the ribcage from the xiphoid process to the neck.\n\t\t\nFind the xiphoid process, and make a horizontal cut of approximately 1.5 cm.\nMake two vertical cuts from the ends of the previous horizontal cut to the shoulders, approximately 1.5 cm each.\nCut through the diaphragm and the costochondral junctions to expose the heart.\nWith small spring scissors, make a small, 2-5 mm cut in the right atrium, from the ventral to dorsal side of the heart.\nUsing a 10 ml syringe with a 27G x 1/2 inch needle, inject the left ventricle and quickly perfuse the animal with high sucrose cutting solution.\nOnce the blood runs clear, use larger scissors to remove the head.\n\t\tNote: We have not systematically assessed the utility of perfusion. However, in our experience, transcardiac perfusion in mice this young can be done with nearly 100% success, and does have the benefit of eliminating red blood cells, which can fluoresce and interfere with imaging.\nCut the skin down the midline to expose the skull.\nUsing bent iris scissors, cut the skull between the eyes, then starting from the cut between the eyes, carefully cut from anterior to posterior along the midline suture taking care not to damage the brain underneath.\n\t\tNote: The dura usually comes off with the skull. If necessary, remove the dura before carefully removing the brain.\nUsing jewelers forceps, pry open the skull and carefully remove the brain, then place the brain in cutting solution. Take care to avoid damaging the cortices.\n2. Preparing Brain for Slicing\nPreparing brain for mounting on vibratome stage.",
    "Using a slide marked with two lines at 90o and a diagonal line at 17o from the top left to bottom right, intersecting where the two lines meet, place the brain dorsal side up, using a razor blade, remove 2-4 mm of the rostral end brain creating a flat surface.\nPlace the brain caudal side up on the newly created flat surface, and align the dorsal surface of the brain with the horizontal and the midline of the brain with the vertical line.\nAlign the razor blade with the 17o line, tilt the razor at a 30o angle and remove approximately 3 mm of the right cortex in a double diagonal cut (17o from horizontal plane and 60o from the coronal).\nMounting brain on vibratome stage.\n\t\nPlace a small piece of filter paper 1 cm x 2 cm on the ventral side of the brain so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the midline.\nCarefully apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate adhesive to the area in front of the backstop (and to the left of the bump).\nPlace the double diagonally-cut brain face on to the glue so that the caudal part of the brain and hindbrain are propped upon the bump and the right side of the brain is against the backstop.\nDelicately press down on the brain, ensuring that the entire surface is in contact with the slicing chamber.\n3. Obtaining the Colliculo-thalamocortical Slice\nQuickly take the cutting stage and place in the vibratome, fill the stage with cutting solution.\nAlign the blade with the top (ventral side) of the brain.\nRemove 1-1.5 mm from the top of the brain, remove 300-500 µm slices and assess depth after removal.",
    "Note: When the IC, the MGB, and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are all visible, and the dentate gyrus forms a 'C' shape take one to two 600 µm slices. See Figure 3A.\nPlace slices in heated (32 oC) holding chamber.\n4. Imaging of the Slice\nPreparation for flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging.\n\t\nPrepare aCSF for perfusion of slice in a standard electrophysiological recording chamber, bubble aCSF with 95% O2/5% CO2.\nPull glass electrode for stimulation. Note that multiple different stimulating electrodes and configurations (glass, tungsten, carbon fiber, monopolar, bipolar) all work very well in conjunction with flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging.\nTurn on computer, camera, micromanipulator, light source, stimulation software, image capture software.\nPerfuse the recording chamber with oxygenated aCSF, place custom bridge (design available in Supplemental Materials) to elevate slice in chamber.\n\t\tNote: Perfusion rate can vary with any individual set up; 5-15 ml/min is used here.\nPlace slice in chamber, lower the liquid level in the chamber to prevent the slice from lifting off the bridge while placing specially constructed harp over slice, taking care to avoid placing harp strings over pathways of interest (Figure 1A). Increase liquid level to approximately 1-2 mm above slice to maintain aCSF flow above and below slice.\n\t\tNote: If repositioning is necessary, use the broken end Pasteur pipette or allow the aCSF level to rise and use forceps with extreme care.\nInsert silver chloride electrode into glass electrode filled with aCSF, insert the glass electrode into micromanipulator and connect to stimulus isolator, and carefully place glass electrode in IC/white matter leading to thalamus(see Figure 1A).\nFlavoprotein autofluorescence image acquisition.",
    "Collect images at 4 Hz (using an infinity-corrected 2X macro objective (NA 0.13)) and a camera for 105 sec while electrically stimulating (each stimulation consists of 1 sec of 40 Hz 2 msec pulses tissue at 0.05 Hz five times) while illuminating the tissue with blue light 470-490 nm and capturing above 515 nm. Ensure that the image is neither too dark, nor blown out see Figure 3 left column for reference.\n\t\tNote: Collection time, collection frequency, and stimulation frequency can be changed to suit the experiment, the custom program included in supplementary materials can be modified as such.\nExport images to Matlab, and using the custom written program available in supplementary materials to analyze spectral power of the images at 0.05 Hz. The resulting image will show connected pathways.\n\t\tNote: The custom program uses a fast Fourier transform of the pixel values in the time series to produce the image.\nPreparation for calcium imaging.\n\t\nPrepare small incubation chamber using a 3 cm culture dish and raised culture membrane to allow aCSF to reach both the top and bottom of the slice, and place on a heating pad to maintain temperature at approximately 32 oC.\nFill small incubation chamber with warm aCSF and slowly bubble with 95% O2/5% CO2.\nMix 2 µl of pluronic F-127 acid and 50 µg of Fura-2AM dissolved in 48 µl of DMSO.\nPlace slice in small incubation chamber on raised membrane and carefully using a micropipette add staining mixture directly above the MGB (or other structure of interest).\nCover slices to prevent bleaching prior to imaging, and allow slices to incubate for 45 min - 1 hr.\nRemove slices to heated holding chamber for 10-15 min to wash off excess material.\nFollow steps 4.1.1 to 4.1.6 for preparation to stimulate and image the colliculo-thalamocortical slice.",
    "Calcium image acquisition.\n\t\nCollect images at 10 Hz (using an 20X water immersion objective) for 25 sec while electrically stimulating (each stimulation consists of one 2 msec pulse) tissue at 0.2 Hz five times while illuminating the tissue with 365 nm light and capturing fluorescence above 510 nm.\nExport images to Matlab and using the custom written program available in supplementary materials to analyze spectral power of the images at 0.2 Hz. The resulting image will show active cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
