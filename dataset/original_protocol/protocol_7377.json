    "Sample preparation and staining  Retrieve fixed insects from 70% ethanol.Rinse samples once or twice in 70% ethanol and then rehydrate insects in a graded series of ethanol (70% ethanol, to 50% ethanol, to 25% ethanol, to 100% deionized water).Remove the liquid, place insect samples in a fresh Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube, and cover with 5% Lugol’s solution (approximately 300 μL; the volume is subjective, but sample should be submerged).Place in a dark cabinet overnight, from 12 to 24 h.Rinse or flush sample with water before replacing the solution with 70% ethanol.Store in freezer at -20 °C until scanning. Micro-computed tomography: preparing your sample for scanning  Trim a pipette tip to approximately 12.5 mm in height to accommodate the available space in the scanning chamber.Seal the bottom of the trimmed pipette tip with dental wax, ensuring a liquid-tight seal is created.Apply a small ball of wax to the pedestal and place the wax-sealed bottom of the trimmed pipette to the wax ball. Apply light pressure to adhere the wax from both surfaces together; additional dental wax can be added to ensure the pipette will stand upright on the pedestal.Orient the pipette tip so that it is straight and centered upright. Set the pedestal on the counter and slowly rotate to visually examine for movement of the pipette tip. Adjust the orientation of the pipette tip in the wax until rotational movement is reduced and it appears centered.Pipette 70% ethanol into the trimmed pipette (approximately 50–80 μL; can start at a lower volume and add more ethanol after placing sample).Retrieve your stained insect sample from its storage tube with a paint brush and deposit it in the ethanol of the trimmed pipette. Add more ethanol if the sample is not submerged.",
    "Gently tap the base of the pedestal on the counter (pipette staying upright) to dislodge any air bubbles within the pipette and to settle the sample in the bottom of the tube.Lightly seal the top of the trimmed tube with wax; roll a small ball of wax into a flat circle, apply to the open top of the pipette, and gently press the edges around the outside wall of the pipette tip.Check the orientation pipette tip one last time to ensure it is centered on the pedestal.Open the Bruker Skyscan Micro-CT scanning software. If the lights on the micro-CT are flashing and an X-ray source dialog box opens, the X-ray source may need time to warm up if the machine has not been used recently.Ensure the X-ray source is off and open the scanner door using the Bruker scanning software top menu bar.Place the pedestal in the scanner platform and tighten the ring.Close the scanning door using the Bruker software. Micro-computed tomography: scanning  In the Skyscan Micro-CT software, turn on the Grab setting (TV icon) and visual camera (lightbulb icon) along the top bar to view the sample inside the micro-CT machine during scanning setup (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4584/bioprotoc-13-01-4584-g001.jpg Figure 1. Screenshot of menu bar.  Active features are labeled in orange.Adjust voltage and amperage to 50 kV and 200 μA, respectively.Change the binning to 2,016 × 1,344 by clicking this setting on the bottom toolbar (found on the bottom right, dimensions next to an icon of a blue box with blue arrows, Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4584/bioprotoc-13-01-4584-g002.jpg Figure 2. Screenshot of bottom toolbar  To the right of binning setting on the bottom toolbar is the filter setting. Set the filter setting to “no filter.”Using the left mouse button and the Control key, click and drag the main image to center the sample.",
    "A line will appear to indicate the direction and degree of movement. Releasing will move the sample within the Skyscan unit.Rotate the sample 360° to ensure it is upright and within the bounds of the scanning area at all degrees of rotation. If the sample is tilted or rotates outside of the camera view, shut off the source and open the chamber to reorient the sample on the pedestal. Re-center the sample if any changes are made to the pipette orientation (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4584/bioprotoc-13-01-4584-g003.jpg Figure 3. Inside of the scanner with a sample  Click the Elevation setting on the bottom toolbar (displays a “mm” setting found on the right side, next to two green arrows) to open the Magnification and Positions menu. Slowly decrease the pixel size in a stepwise manner until it reaches 4.26 μm, ensuring sample does not contact the internal camera.Repeat step C6 to ensure the entire sample is still within the visible bounds of the screen. Repeat steps C5 and C6 if necessary.Right click on the center of the sample to bring up the Transmission reading for your sample.Return to the Magnification and Positions menu by clicking the Elevation setting on the bottom toolbar. Record the current elevation (mm) of the sample.Remove the sample from field of view by lowering the sample height number.Navigate to Scanning Modes menu from the Options tab to update the flat field correction. Adjust exposure time to obtain approximately 60% average transmission with flat fields turned off. In previous samples, 600 ms was optimal for ambrosia beetle scans.Return the sample to the field of view by entering the recorded Elevation number in the Magnification and Position menu.Click the Scan icon on the top toolbar (blue circular arrow) to begin setting the scan parameters: rotation step = 0.",
    "200 degrees; frame averaging = ON (2); Random Movement = OFF (0). Give the scan a descriptive title and use the Browse button to designate the data directory. Create a New Folder to house the scan data (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4584/bioprotoc-13-01-4584-g004.jpg Figure 4. An example of scan setting  Press ‘Scan’ to begin scanning."
