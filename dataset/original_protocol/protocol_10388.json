    "1. Preparation of Solutions\nTo prepare a 5 mg/ml solution of insulin, dilute the powdered insulin stock with 5 mM hydrochloric acid (HCl) in dH2O (500 mg insulin in 100 ml solvent). Prepare 100 ml solvent by adding 50 μl of concentrated HCl to 100 ml distilled water (dH2O).\nTo make a 1x solution of PBS, dilute the 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) stock solution to 1x with dH2O under sterile conditions.\nPrepare the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer solution as follows: mix the PDMS prepolymer together with the curing agent in a 10:1 (w:w) ratio.\nPrepare the cell culture medium as follows: to 500 ml of stock Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12), add 10 ml of sterile fetal bovine serum (FBS), 500 μl of gentamicin reagent, and 500 μl of 5 mg/ml insulin.\nTo prepare the 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x PBS solution, add 1% (w:v) solution of BSA powder to 1x PBS and mix thoroughly.\nTo prepare a 4 mg/ml solution of neutralized bovine type I collagen, add 50 µl 10x Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer, 30 µl 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 30 µl cell culture medium, and 400 µl of stock collagen to a chilled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix slowly by pipetting up and down; avoid introducing bubbles. To remove any bubbles, briefly centrifuge the mixture at 4 °C.\nPrepare a fixative solution by diluting 16% paraformaldehyde 1:4 (v:v) in 1x PBS.\nPrepare a nuclei labeling solution by diluting the stock nuclei labeling solution 1:1,000 (v:v) in 1x PBS.\nPrepare a 0.3% phosphate-buffered saline and detergent (PBST) solution by mixing 1x PBS with 0.3% (v:v) detergent.\nPrepare blocking buffer by diluting goat serum 1:10 (v:v) in 0.3% PBST.",
    "Prepare a primary antibody solution for a particular protein of interest by diluting primary antibody (for example, rabbit anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)) 1:200 (v:v) in blocking buffer.\nPrepare a secondary antibody solution by diluting a fluorescent probe-conjugated antibody (for example, goat anti-rabbit) 1:1,000 (v:v) in blocking buffer.\n2. Preparation of Elastomeric Stamps for 3D Micropatterning\nNote: Elastomeric stamps are made with PDMS.\nMake a PDMS solution at the same ratio as described in step 1.3 and mix thoroughly. Place the mixture in a vacuum chamber for 15-30 min to remove any air bubbles that were introduced during the mixing process.\nPour the degassed solution into a plastic weigh boat or Petri dish containing a silicon master that is lithographically patterned with features of desired geometry. For best results, cure the PDMS solution at 60 °C for ~12 hr.\n\tNote: The silicon masters are highly customizable; this protocol uses rectangular structures with dimensions of 50 μm x 200 μm x 50 μm spaced 200 μm apart. The silicon masters can be made using standard photolithography techniques. Briefly, an epoxy-based photoresist is spin-coated on top of a silicon wafer. A mask detailing the desired stamp features is placed on top of the photoresist-coated wafer, which is then exposed to UV light. The desired features not blocked by the mask are exposed to the light and the photoresist at these locations becomes crosslinked, while the remainder of the photoresist coating is soluble and can be washed away.\nAfter the PDMS has cured around the desired features on the silicon master, remove the PDMS and master from the plastic container. Carefully separate the PDMS from the silicon wafer and remove excess PDMS from around the imprinted features using a clean razor blade.",
    "Now cut the PDMS patterned with imprinted features into individual rectangular stamps (~8-mm x 5-mm) with a razor blade. Store these feature-side-up in a clean 100-mm-diameter Petri dish.\nAdditionally, use the PDMS solution described in step 1.3 to make supports for the rectangular stamps.\nUsing a spin coater, spread ~2-3 g of the PDMS solution evenly on a 100-mm-diameter Petri dish and cure the PDMS for ~12 hr at 60 °C as in step 2.1. Then, using a razor blade, cut the thin layer of PDMS into rectangles (~5 mm x 2 mm).\n\tNote: Two supports are needed for each PDMS stamp made in step 2.3. The supports can be stored in the 100-mm-diameter Petri dish that contains the PDMS stamps.\nBefore the PDMS stamps and supports can be used for cell culture, sterilize by immersion in 70% ethanol and dry using an aspirator in a biosafety cabinet (cell culture hood).\n3. Preparation of 3D Epithelial Tissues\nIn a biosafety cabinet, add a drop of approximately 50 µl of 1% BSA in PBS to the top of each stamp. Place the droplet covered stamps at 4 °C for a minimum of 4 hr to ensure that the BSA adsorbs to the surface of the stamp.\nAspirate BSA solution from the PDMS stamps.\nWash the surfaces of the stamps twice with cell culture medium (50 µl per wash per stamp should be sufficient), aspirating after each wash.\nHandle the sterilized PDMS stamps and supports using curved stainless steel tweezers. In a biosafety cabinet, lay out one 35-mm-diameter tissue culture dish for each PDMS stamp. In each dish, lay down two PDMS supports separated by a distance slightly less than the length of the PDMS stamps.",
    "Using the tweezers, sterilize as many circular glass coverslips (15 mm in diameter, #1) as there are PDMS stamps using 70% ethanol. Aspirate the excess liquid from the coverslips while holding them with the tweezers. Store the washed coverslips in a separate 100-mm-diameter Petri dish.\nDispense ~50 µl of the collagen mixture to evenly coat the surface of each PDMS stamp.\nPick up each collagen-coated PDMS stamp with the tweezers and gently invert them. Lower the inverted stamps on top of the PDMS supports laid out in 35-mm-diameter tissue culture dished such that the collagen is between the stamp and the bottom of the tissue culture dish. Incubate the dishes at 37 °C for 30 min.\nDispense ~50 µl of the remaining collagen mixture onto each of the circular coverslips (later, these will be placed on top of the engineered tissues to completely encapsulate them in collagen) and incubate them at 37 °C for 30 min.\nObtain a 100-mm-diameter tissue culture dish containing epithelial cells (ex. EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells) at ~40% confluency. Aspirate the cell culture medium and wash once with 10 ml 1x PBS. Add 2 ml of trypsin to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nAdd 8 ml of fresh culture medium to the tissue culture dish containing trypsinized cells, detaching any remaining adherent cells from the dish. Mix gently by pipetting and move the cell mixture to a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 100 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant from the conical tube and resuspend the cell pellet in cell culture medium. Using a hemocytometer, count the cells to determine the concentration of the suspension. Adjust the suspension volume to obtain a final concentration of ~106-107cells/ml.",
    "Remove the gelled collagen samples from the incubator. Using the tweezers, gently lift the PDMS stamps straight upwards to detach them from the molded collagen and discard them.\nDispense ~30 µl of the concentrated cell suspension onto the surface of each collagen gel containing molded cavities of desired geometry. Observe the cells under a brightfield microscope with a 10X/0.25 NA objective while gently shaking the dishes side to side to promote cell settling within the cavities. The cavities should be filled within ~5 min.\nTo remove excess cells from around the cavities, tilt each tissue culture dish on its side and gently dispense ~400 μl cell culture medium over the surface of the collagen gel. Aspirate the liquid and repeat the wash 1-2 more times, checking the collagen gels under the microscope in between each wash.\nAfter the excess cells have been cleared from around the cell-filled cavities in the collagen mold, place the tissue culture dishes into a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, using the tweezers, gently invert the collagen-coated class coverslips and place them on top of the cell-filled collagen molds such that the collagen from the coverslips forms a cap over the cell-filled cavities. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 15 min.\nOnce the collagen caps have adhered to the cell-filled collagen mold, dispense ~2-2.5 ml cell culture medium slowly over the glass coverslip on top of the gels. Culture the samples at 37 °C for 1-3 days.\n\tNote: 24 hr after initial seeding, the epithelial tissues can be treated with growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to induce branching.\n4. Immunofluorescence and Image Analysis",
    "Aspirate the cell culture medium from the tissue culture dishes and add enough fixative solution to cover the cell-containing gels. Incubate the dishes at room temperature for 15 min on a shaker at 200 rpm.\nAspirate the fixative, fill the tissue culture dishes with 1x PBS, and incubate at room temperature for 15 min on a shaker at 200 rpm. Repeat twice for three total washes.\nTo label nuclei: Aspirate the PBS from the tissue culture dish and replace with Hoechst solution. Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 min. To stain for FAK or another marker that is detectable with antibodies, skip to Step 4.5.\nAspirate the nuclear labeling solution and wash the cell-containing gels three times with 1x PBS as in Step 4.2. Stained samples can be stored in 1x PBS at 4 °C until further use.\nTo stain for a protein of interest: Aspirate the PBS from the tissue culture dishes, add 300 μl of 0.3% PBST, and incubate the sample at room temperature for 15 min.\nAspirate the PBS, cover the gels with blocking buffer, and incubate on a shaker (200 rpm) at room temperature for ~4 hr.\nAspirate the blocking buffer, cover the gels with primary antibody solution, and incubate on a shaker at 200 rpm overnight at 4 °C.\nAspirate the primary antibody solution, add 0.3% PBST solution, and incubate on a shaker at 200 rpm at room temperature for 30 min. Aspirate the PBST and repeat every 30 min for 3-4 hr.\nRepeat steps 4.7 and 4.8, this time incubating with the secondary antibody solution. Wrap the tissue culture dishes with aluminum foil to prevent photobleaching of the secondary antibody. After the final wash, stained samples can be stored in 1x PBS at 4 °C until further use.",
    "To visualize samples, use a 10X/0.30 NA objective focused on the midplane of the epithelial tissues.\nTo visualize cell nuclei, image fixed samples labeled with a nuclear marker using a 10X/0.30 NA objective under UV illumination.\nTo visualize samples stained for a protein of interest, image using a 10X/0.30 NA objective on an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nTo create frequency maps of protein staining of multiple tissues (typically 50 or more) of identical initial geometry, first import each of the images using standard image analysis software (see Materials) and convert them to 8-bit grayscale.\nTo threshold these images, convert them to binary (i.e., halftone/black and white) by defining a grayscale cutoff point; grayscale values below the threshold become black, and those above the threshold become white. Then, combine each of the individual binary images into a single image stack.\nNext, register the stacked images (i.e., align or match them) in the analysis software. Many image analysis software packages come with a freely available registration plugin.\n\t\nUse each image in a stack as a template for the alignment of the next image, such that the images in the entire stack are aligned by propagation. Finally, overlay (project) the images in the aligned image stack based on average intensity to form a single image with a pixel frequency map. This image can then be color-coded using image editing software of choice10,11.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
