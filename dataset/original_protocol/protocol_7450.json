    "Prepare zebrafish larva (Tg[gSAGFF202A:UAS-EGFP; Tg[SILL-mCherry] line for imaging Schwann cells and afferent neurons, or Tg[mfap4:EGFP; Tg[SILL:mCherry] line for imaging macrophages and afferent neurons) Collect embryos and keep them in the incubator at 28.5 °C for standard development to the 5–6 days-post-fertilization (dpf) larval stage. Embryos should be kept in 90 mm Petri dishes. For optimal survival, keep around 50 embryos per dish.At 4 dpf, screen specimens using a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Figures 1 and 2).Using a transfer pipette, isolate the positive larva expressing the mCherry (red) in the lateralis neurons and EGFP (green) in Schwann cells or macrophages.Note: Plastic materials intended for single use can be washed and re-used. This includes Petri dishes and transfer pipettes. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4665/bioprotoc-13-09-4665-g001.jpg Figure 1. Main tools for the protocol.  A.

Procedures for collecting eggs and raising specimens.  A. Photograph of a breeding tank, with a bottom grid to enable eggs to fall outside the reach of adult fish (which may otherwise eat them), a Petri dish and an egg-harvesting strainer. B. Once the inner container is removed with the breeding adults, the water with the eggs contained in the breeding tank is gently poured through the strainer to collect eggs. C. The eggs are gently and briefly washed with clean water from the facility system. D.",
    "The strainer is then placed inside down onto the inner (bottom) part of the Petri dish and eggs are flushed into this dish applying a gently flow of water using a plastic bottle. E. The eggs will now be visible in the dish. F. The dish with the eggs can then be moved to a stereomicroscope of fluorescence forMosaic-labelling, an alternative to stable transgenics lines for marking a selected population of neurons and Schwann cells or macrophages Prepare Casper zebrafish eggs from the Tg[gSAGFF202A] driver line for Schwann cells.Prepare the plasmids for injection. Mix well 20 ng/μL each of the UAS:EGFP and SILL:mCherry plasmids before loading into the capillary for injection.For macrophage and neurons, mix mfap4:EGFP and SILL:mCherry constructs for injection (10 ng/μL of each plasmids).Inject around 1–2 nL plasmids into the one-cell stage embryos.Screen the injected eggs that have developed as morphologically normal larva at 4 dpf and pick the EGFP and mCherry double-positives under a stereomicroscope of fluorescence. Then, transfer the positive larva to a new plate for growth to desired stage (Figure 2).Laser-mediated nerve transection and imaging Anesthetizing and mounting the larvaAnesthetize the larva with 1× MS-222 solution (0.016% w/v) diluting with E3 medium. The E3 embryo medium is prepared as a stock solution (10×) from which a working solution (1×) is freshly made (see Recipe 1). Put one large drop (around 100 μL) of 1% low melting agarose (melted at no more than 37 °C) onto the cover glass–bottomed dish. Move the anesthetized larva into the agarose drop using a transfer pipette with the minimal amount of water possible, to prevent too much dilution of the agarose. Using a hair loop glued to the tip of a glass pipette, gently push the larva to the bottom of the dish so that it touches the glass.",
    "Then, orient and position the specimen as desired. Generally, the resulting ~1% low melting agarose will allow enough time (30–45 s) for the procedure. With practice, up to three fish can be mounted almost simultaneously.After 5 min at room temperature, cover the now solidified agarose with E3 embryo medium containing MS-222.Move the dish with extreme care because, if shaken, the agarose block could detach from the glass, rendering the preparation unusable.Note: We noticed a significant drop of survival during imaging when more than three fish are mounted on the same dish. Put the dish containing fish on a holder adapted to the microscope stage. Put the heating system at 28.5 °C (or the ideal temperature for the specific experiment). Use the 20× objective to adjust the position of the dish by looking at the red or green fluorescence.Transect the axons with a laser beam by using a water-immersion 63× objective (see Notes). It is important to avoid oil-immersion objectives because they will prevent repeating the procedure on multiple fish mounted on the same dish, and also significantly complicate later imaging using lower magnification objectives.For transection, we use the iLas-Pulse ultraviolet laser system, controlled by VISION software. A 350 nm laser with 400 ps/2.5 μJ per pulse and adjusted to power of 27 mW is used for nerve transections.Using the VISION software, draw a line or a rectangle to mark the region to be targeted by the laser beam. This can be saved in the system for subsequent equivalent samples. To fully sever the axons, the laser pulses should be applied repeatedly until there is a clear gap in the rectangle region (see Notes). We normally set the pulse at 0.05 ms and hit three times per mouse click.",
    "If needed to generate a larger damage, move the line/rectangle to the next position for a new transection. We normally use a distance of 40 µm between multiple transections of the same nerve (Figure 5).Set up the parameters for intravital imagingAfter ensuring the axons are completely severed, select a 40× (air) or 63× (water) objective for live imaging. Put the region of interest in the center of the field of view and focus to the plane of interest. When Z-stacks’ parameters are fixed, the intervals of one stack can be set to 0.8–1.3 μm. The intervals of imaging are set to 5–10 min.If long-term imaging (more than 1 h) will be performed, replace the 63× water-immersion objective by an equivalent objective that can tolerate an immersion medium that will not evaporate. Given that high-grade low-melting-point agarose has a refractive index (RI) of 1.33 (similar to water) and that borosilicate glass has a RI of 1.47, the use of 100% glycerol with a RI of 1.47 is optimal.Image quantification The live imaging raw data is sent to Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/[href=https://imagej.net/software/fiji/]) for analysis.Use the plugin “Tracking” to analyze the dynamics of nerve repair and the behavior of Schwann cells or macrophages. Open Plugins – Tracking – Manual Tracking.Select the cell(s) of interest at the starting point for tracing over the course of the time series. This can be done from a single focal plane or a maximal projection of the entire or partial Z-stack.With information we got from tracking, we can make conclusions on how many Schwann cells were attracted to the damaged site and how long these cells stayed (Tian et al., 2020b; Figures 3–5, Videos 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4665/bioprotoc-13-09-4665-g003.jpg Figure 3.

    "Still images from a high-resolution time-lapse recording of a macrophage (green) and a lateralis sensory nerve (red) in the trunk of a larval zebrafish. A single macrophage is seen migrating towards the nerve immediately after it has been severed with a laser. A second macrophage is seen below, which never makes contact with the nerve. Over time, the macrophage moves along the nerve, surveilling damage (which can be seen as a discontinuity of the nerve on the left-hand side of the panels (C and D). The drawings below each panel (dotted lines) describe the two-dimensional shape changes ofthis single macrophage during the course of videomicroscopic imaging.
