    "The protocol has been approved by the local medical and ethics committees. The procedure lasts approximately 15 min per side.\n1. Indications\nEnsure the patient has the following indications for CLS: thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), ischemic diabetic foot, Raynaud's disease, parmoplantar hyperhidrosis, erythromelalgia, phantom limb pain, or livedo reticularis of the lower extremities.\n2. Contraindications\nExclude the patient if any of the following contraindications are fulfilled: spinal deformity, bleeding tendency, any infection in the procedure-involved areas, unstable vital signs, pregnancy, or any conditions that render the ability for compliance with the procedure.\n3. Preoperative Preparation\nConfirm the presence of indications and lack of contraindications based on clinical and laboratory results.\nObtain written, informed consent from the patient/relative.\n4. Treatment Procedure\nPatient position: ensure that the patient is in lateral decubitus position with the side to be treated facing upwards and the lower limbs flexed to make the back as stretched as possible.\nDisinfection: disinfect the skin at the planned needle puncture site (approximately 30 cm diameter) with 2% entoiodine, twice. Then, cover the patient's back with surgical towels.\nAnesthetization of the needle tract under lateral fluoroscopy guidance: anesthetize the skin and entire needle tract with 5–8 mL of 0.5% lidocaine (2% lidocaine diluted in 0.9% saline solution) without vasoconstrictors. Advance the needle under local anesthesia to the vertebral body surface gradually. Position the needle tip in the optimal injection area.\nNOTE: The puncture point on the skin is approximately 7–8 cm from the dorsomedial line, depending on body shape. Figure 1A shows the needle tract. Figure 1B shows the optimal injection area, which is at approximately one-third the dividing line of the vertebral body in the lateral view of a lumbar X-ray.",
    "Confirmation of the accuracy of the needle position with contrast agent: after ensuring that the needle tip is in the optimal area in the lateral view of a lumbar X-ray, inject 0.5 mL of the contrast agent to further evaluate the correct position of the needle tip.\nNOTE: The goal is to keep the contrast agent mainly confined to the optimal area then spreading along the psoas major muscle. Distribution of the contrast along the psoas muscle fibers is the marker of successful injection behind the anterior fascia (Figure 2).\nInjection of inactivating agent, 5% phenol: after aspiration, to ensure no puncture accidents, inject 2 mL of 5% aqueous solution of phenol into the optimal area (adjust the needle tip direction to ensure 1 mL of phenol spreads to the direction of the head then 1 mL of phenol to the direction of the foot). Then, withdraw the needle from the skin and compress and cover the puncture site with gauze to achieve hemostasis.\nNOTE: Steps 4.3 to 4.5 were performed at L3 and L4, respectively.\nEvaluation of the efficacy of sympathetic interruption: define satisfactory sympathetic interruption as a rise of at least 2 °C in skin temperature 5 min after the completion of step 4.5. If satisfactory interruption is not achieved, perform supplemental injection to another optimal area or L5, with a total phenol volume no larger than 10 mL for both sides. Perform the other side in the same manner if needed. Measure the skin temperature using an infrared thermometer, and calculate the average among temperature increases in the shin, plantar, and dorsal foot.\n5. Postoperative Care",
    "Encourage the patient to drink water and ambulate after completion of the procedure. Check the patient on the following day for any discomfort, especially in the loin, groin, and thigh, and for improvement of symptoms and any signs of primary disease. Measure the skin temperature as described in step 4.6. Follow-up with the patient accordingly.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
