    "1. Expression and Purification of TreT from Top10 E. coli\nNOTE: Please contact the authors to request the TreT-expressing E. coli strain (pBAD TreT plasmid, containing the T. tenax tret gene under the control of the AraC protein, transformed into Top10 E. coli 19) and the accompanying material transfer agreement. The following protocol typically gives a protein yield of approximately 4 mg/L.\nPrepare a 3 mL overnight culture of TreT-expressing E. coli.\n\t\nStreak Top10 E. coli transformed with pBAD-TreT expression vector on a lysogeny broth (LB) agar plate containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for approximately 48 hours.\nPick a single colony from the plate and inoculate 3 mL of LB liquid medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin in a culture tube.\nPlace the tube in a shaking incubator at 37 °C x 175 rpm overnight.\nInduce protein expression in TreT-expressing E. coli.\nAdd 750 mL Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin to a 2,800 mL Fernbach culture flask. Transfer 1 mL broth from the flask to a cuvette for later use as a blank.\nAdd the 3 mL overnight culture generated in step 1.1.4 to the culture flask, then place the flask in an incubator and shake at 37 °C x 200 rpm. Periodically check the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm versus the blank collected in step 1.2.1.\nOnce the absorbance at 600 nm reaches between 0.5-1.0, induce TreT expression by adding 750 µL of 1 M arabinose solution (1 mM final concentration) to the culture. Return the flask to the incubator and shake overnight at 37 °C x 200 rpm.\nPellet and lyse the TreT-expressing E. coli  cells.\nTransfer the culture to a polypropylene bottle and centrifuge for 15 min at 4000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 15 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 15 min at 4,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and either proceed to cell lysis (step 1.3.4) or store the pellet indefinitely at -80 °C.\nDissolve 1 protease inhibitor mini tablet in 20 mL of wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) in a 50 mL conical tube.\nTransfer the protease inhibitor-containing wash buffer to the conical tube containing the pellet. Vortex until the pellet is re-suspended.\nTransfer re-suspended cells to a 100 mL beaker and lyse the cells by sonication (pulse sequence of 45 seconds on, 45 seconds off with a run time of 2 min and 15 seconds at an amplitude of 75 percent).\nTransfer the lysate to a 50 mL metal conical tube and centrifuge for 60 min at 15,000 x g at 4 °C.\nClarify the lysate by passage through a 0.2-0.45 μm syringe filter into a 50 mL conical tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The typical concentration of lysate obtained is 100 mg/mL.\nPurify TreT from E. coli  cell lysate using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC).\nSet up the FPLC with a nickel affinity column (5 mL bed volume). Wash the column with 10 mL of deionized water or until the column is clean of any contaminants. Equilibrate the column using 20 mL of wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.",
    "Load the lysate (20 mL) obtained from step 1.3.8 onto the column and elute untagged proteins with wash buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/min until the absorbance reaches background levels (typically 80-100 mL of wash buffer are required).\nElute His-tagged TreT by using a linear gradient of elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) from 1-100% over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Collect 4 mL fractions until TreT has eluted and the absorbance reaches baseline level.\n\t\t​NOTE: Typically, 60 mL of elution buffer are required to elute the protein, and the protein elutes in the 60-100% elution buffer range. Approximately 10-15 mL of pure TreT in elution buffer are obtained.\nDetermine the concentration of TreT by measuring absorbance at 280 nm against an elution buffer blank.\nExchange TreT into tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer by dialysis.\nAfter preparing the dialysis tubing according to the manufacturer's instructions, prime it by rinsing with deionized water and then Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0).\nLoad the TreT sample into the dialysis tubing using a syringe and blunt needle. Dialyze overnight against 2 L of Tris buffer.\nDetermine the concentration of TreT by measuring absorbance at 280 nm against a blank collected from the dialysis washing.\nTransfer the TreT solution to a 50 mL conical tube and proceed to trehalose analogue synthesis (step 2) or store the enzyme at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: TreT is a thermostable protein. The TreT was stored in Tris buffer at 4 °C for several months without observing significant loss of activity.\n2. One-step Synthesis of Trehalose Analogues Using TreT Enzyme",
    "NOTE: The protocol below describes a reaction scale based on 4 mL volume, which can deliver approximately 15-30 mg of trehalose analogue depending on reaction efficiency and molecular weight of the product. The reaction components can be scaled to obtain more or less trehalose analogue if desired.\nAdd glucose analogue (0.080 mmol, mass will depend on the molecular weight), UDP-glucose (0.160 mmol, 97.6 mg), and MgCl2 (0.080 mmol, 16.3 mg) to a 15 mL conical tube. The final concentrations of these components will be 20 mM, 40 mM, and 20 mM, respectively.\nAdd TreT in Tris buffer (obtained from step 1.5.4) and, if necessary, an appropriate volume of Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) to achieve a final enzyme concentration of 300 μg/mL and a final volume of 4 mL. Pipet the mixture up and down gently or invert the tube to dissolve the solids.\nIncubate the reaction at 70 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 1 hour, then place the tube on ice to cool.\n3. Purification of Trehalose Analogues from Crude Enzymatic Reaction Mixture\nPre-rinse a centrifugal filter unit (nominal molecular weight limit (NWML) 10 kDa) to remove trace glycerol in the membrane by adding 3 mL of deionized water to the centrifugal filter unit and centrifuging at 3,000 x g until all liquid passes through the filter into the tube (approximately 20 min). Repeat two additional times. Complete this step immediately prior to or during the reaction (step 2.3).\nAfter cooling the enzymatic reaction mixture (obtained from step 2.3), transfer it to the pre-rinsed centrifugal filter unit. Rinse the reaction tube with 1 mL of deionized water and transfer to the centrifugal filter unit. Repeat rinsing of the reaction tube for maximum recovery of product.",
    "Centrifuge the centrifugal filter unit at 3,000 x g until all liquid passes through the filter into the tube (approximately 20 min). Rinse the upper chamber of the centrifugal filter unit with 3 mL of deionized water and centrifuge at 3,000 x g until all liquid passes through the filter into the tube (approximately 20 min). Repeat rinsing for maximum recovery of product.\nDiscard the upper chamber of the centrifugal filter unit. Add mixed-bed ion-exchange resin (3 g) to the filtrate at the bottom of the tube (typical filtrate volume is 8-15 mL depending on the number of rinses). Stir at room temperature for 1 hour with a magnetic stir bar at a speed sufficient to keep the resin beads suspended in the solution.\nDecant the supernatant and filter it to remove the resin. Add 5 mL of deionized water to rinse the remaining resin. Decant the supernatant and filter it, combining it with the product solution from the first decantation. Repeat rinsing of the resin for maximum recovery of product.\nAnalyze the reaction by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or HPLC to determine whether complete conversion of the glucose analogue starting material to the trehalose analogue product was achieved. See step 4.1 for TLC analysis and step 4.2 for HPLC analysis.\nRemove water by lyophilization or rotary evaporation to give the dried product. If no unreacted glucose analogue was observed during TLC or HPLC analysis, purification by chromatography is unnecessary. Weigh the product to obtain the reaction yield and perform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis (step 4.3) to confirm product structure and purity.\nIf unreacted glucose analogue was observed during TLC analysis, separate it from the trehalose analogue using a size exclusion column.",
    "Prepare a 1 x 100 cm column containing deionized water-saturated, extra-fine P2 polyacrylamide bead size exclusion media according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\t​NOTE: The size exclusion column can be reused after washing with deionized water.\nRe-dissolve the dried enzymatic reaction product (obtained from step 3.7) in 0.5 mL of deionized water. Apply the product solution to the size exclusion column manually or by using a column flow adapter. Rinse the vial that contained the crude product with another 0.5 mL deionized water, and load it into the size exclusion column.\nElute the product with deionized water by gravity flow and collect fractions of approximately 2 mL volume.\nAnalyze the fractions by TLC (step 4.1). Pool the fractions containing pure trehalose analogue.\nRemove water by lyophilization or rotary evaporation to give the dried product. Weigh the product to obtain the reaction yield and proceed to NMR analysis (see step 4.3).\n4. Analysis of Trehalose Analogue Products\nPerform thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of TreT reaction.\n\tNOTE: This procedure can also be used to analyze size exclusion column fractions. It may be necessary to concentrate the reaction mixture or column fractions prior to TLC analysis to observe compound staining on the TLC plate.\n\t\nMark lanes on the TLC plate surface with a pencil and apply analyte(s) and relevant standard(s) to the appropriate lanes, including the glucose analogue standard, the trehalose analogue standard (if available), the reaction mixture (or fractions collected from size exclusion column purification), and a co-spot. After applying each sample to the TLC plate, allow the plate to dry.\n\t\tNOTE: For reaction analysis, typically 2 µL of sample is applied to the TLC plate.\nDevelop the TLC plate using n-butanol/ethanol/deionized water (5:3:2).",
    "Dry the developed TLC plate, then dip it in 5% H2SO4 in ethanol (sugar stain) and heat on a hot plate on high setting until sugar-containing spots can be visualized (typically 5 min).\nPerform HPLC analysis of TreT reaction mixtures using any HPLC system capable of separating and detecting carbohydrates. This protocol involves carbohydrate separation using an aminopropyl HPLC column and detection using refractive index.\nAttach aminopropyl column (4.6 x 250 mm) containing a pre-column guard to the HPLC.\nEquilibrate aminopropyl column with 80% acetonitrile in deionized water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.\nLoad the solution of reaction product (or standard) onto the aminopropyl column.\nElute the product (or standard) with 80% acetonitrile in deionized water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and a column temperature of 50 °C. Typically, the run time used is 40 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Both the glucose analogue starting material and the trehalose analogue product can be detected by refractive index, although other methods such as evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) could be used. Using the conditions described, glucose analogues typically elute between 10-15 min and trehalose analogues elute between 15-25 min.\nNMR analysis of purified trehalose analogues.\nDissolve purified trehalose analogue in D2O (700 μL) and transfer the solution to an NMR tube.\nAcquire 1H and 13C NMR spectra according to appropriate NMR facility protocols.\n5. Application of TreT-synthesized Trehalose Analogues to the Detection of Mycobacteria\nSynthesize, purify, and administer 6-TreAz to M. smegmatis (Msmeg).\nAdd 6-azido-6-deoxy glucopyranose (6-GlcAz, 0.020 mmol, 4.1 mg), UDP-glucose (0.040 mmol, 24.4 mg), and MgCl2 (0.020 mmol, 4.1 mg) to a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Add TreT in Tris buffer (obtained from step 1.5.4) to achieve a final enzyme concentration of 300 μg/mL and a final volume of 1 mL. Pipet the mixture up and down gently or invert the tube to dissolve the solids.\nIncubate the reaction at 70 °C with shaking for 15 min.\nDilute the enzymatic reaction mixture with 3 mL of deionized water and transfer it to a pre-washed centrifugal filter unit (NMWL 10 kDa). Centrifuge the filter unit at 3,000 x g until most of the liquid passes through the filter into the tube, approximately 10 min.\nDiscard the upper chamber of the centrifugal filter unit. Add mixed-bed ion-exchange resin (0.75 g) to the tube and stir/shake at room temperature for 25 min. Decant the supernatant and filter it to remove the resin.\n\t\t​NOTE: Steps 5.1.1-5.1.5 provide an aqueous solution of 6-azido-trehalose (6-TreAz) at approximately 5 mM concentration in less than 1 hour. The 5 mM concentration is estimated based on the quantitative conversion of substrate to product and the dilution that takes places during the purification steps, assuming minimal loss of product during these steps. The solution can be sterile-filtered before addition to a biological sample if desired.\nAdd the appropriate volume of 6-TreAz product solution to a log-phase culture of M. smegmatis (Msmeg), typically to achieve a final culture volume of 100-1,000 μL and a final 6-TreAz concentration of ~25 μM. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for the desired amount of time, typically 60 min.\nPerform click chemistry to conjugate a fluorophore to azide-labeled cells. In this protocol, use Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) to deliver a fluorophore to cell-surface azides in Msmeg.\nCentrifuge the cells at 3,900 x g for 5 min, and then wash the cells with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Repeat two times.",
    "Re-suspend the pelleted cells in 4% para-formaldehyde in PBS to fix them. After incubating for 10 min, repeat step 5.2.1 to wash the cells.\nRe-suspend pelleted cells in 138 μL PBS.\nAdd 3 μL of a 1 mM stock solution of alkyne-carboxyrhodamine 110 (Alkyne-488) in DMSO.\nAdd 3 μL of a freshly prepared 60 mM stock solution of sodium ascorbate in deionized water.\nAdd 3 μL of a 6.4 mM stock solution of Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA) in tert-butanol/dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 4:1.\nAdd 3 μL of a 50 mM stock solution of CuSO4 in deionized water.\nPipet the cell suspension up and down, then incubate in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.\nRepeat step 5.2.1 to wash the cells. Re-suspend the cells in 150 μL PBS.\nPerform cellular fluorescence analysis. In this protocol, use fluorescence microscopy to visualize cellular fluorescence of labeled Msmeg.\nAdd 10 μL of bacterial cells suspended in PBS to a microscope slide and lightly spread the liquid into a thin layer using the edge of a coverslip. Allow to air dry in the dark.\nAdd 10 μL of mounting medium over the dried sample, then place cover slips over the sample and apply adhesive (e.g., nail polish) to immobilize.\nImage the slides using a fluorescence microscope at 100X magnification.\nSubscription Required.
