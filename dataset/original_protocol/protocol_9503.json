    "Caution: This protocol requires appropriate training in the use and handling of radioactive materials. Please use the requisite personal protective equipment when performing this assay, including beta radiation shielding. Radioactive waste must be handled carefully, as large volumes of waste are generated during the washing phase of the experiment. Ensure that the waste is stored in an upright container such as a large bucket or bottle that will not be easily knocked over or spilled. Once the experiment is concluded, carefully transfer all liquid waste to appropriately marked radioactive waste containers. Handle all materials with care, and keep a Geiger counter nearby to monitor the workspace for contamination.\nNOTE: This protocol is a revised version of a previously reported assay from our group.15 Phosphohistidine stability in H3PO4 should be tested for any uncharacterized histidine kinase prior to using this method. The phosphohistidine stability test has been described previously.15 A negative control that does not contain kinase must be included. This is necessary in order to subtract the background signal from each sample, and ensure that [γ-32P]-ATP is sufficiently washed from the membrane.\n1. Preparation of Reagents and Materials\nPurify histidine kinases from bacterial culture prior to using this assay.\n\t\nPurify a histidine kinase (gene ID 1189383) from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (EB101, ATCC 17802) for the development of this assay. Clone the kinase into expression vector pET-23aHis-TEV using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, and carry out site-directed mutagenesis to yield the mutant construct Vp1876 D499A.\nTransform the plasmid into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS, and grow cells in TB media at 37 °C. Supplement cultures with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 µg/mL), and grow with agitation (250 rpm) to an OD600 of 0.6.",
    "Induce protein expression with IPTG to a final concentration of 25 µM, and grow cultures overnight at 16 °C. Harvest cells by centrifugation (5,000 x g), lyse by sonication, and centrifuge to remove cellular debris (18,000 x g).\nPurify the His-tagged kinase using Ni-NTA agarose. Confirm purity by SDS-PAGE. Optimize purification for each protein, and confirm purity prior to using this assay.\nPrepare the 25 mM H3PO4 wash solution. To 1 L of distilled deionized water, add H3PO4 to a final concentration of 25 mM. The pH of this solution is approximately 2.0. Place 25 mM H3PO4 on ice.\nPrepare a 13x stock solution of 325 mM H3PO4, to be used to quench kinase reaction. The pH of this solution is approximately 1.5. Place 325 mM H3PO4 on ice.\n\tNOTE: H3PO4 at a final concentration of 25 mM sufficiently quenches the reaction, and also helps to block radiolabeled phosphate that is not bound to histidine from binding to the nitrocellulose membrane.\nPrepare a 4x reaction buffer stock solution containing 160 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 600 mM KCl, 16 mM MgCl2, and 40% glycerol.\nQuantify histidine kinase concentration by established protein concentration methods (Bradford, UV-Vis, etc.).16,17 Prepare a histidine kinase solution with a concentration that is 4 times the desired final concentration. To obtain adequate signal, the final protein concentration in the reaction should ideally be at least 5 µM.\nPrepare a 4x radiolabeled [γ-32P]-ATP solution with the appropriate 4x concentration of unlabeled ATP and labeled:unlabeled ratio for the experiment.",
    "NOTE: The amount of [γ-32P]-ATP that should be included in this mix is dependent on how much [γ-32P]-ATP will ultimately be spotted for each reaction. We have obtained adequate signal with final concentrations ranging between 0.1 - 5 µCi per reaction. It is important that the labeled:unlabeled ATP ratio be kept constant for all reactions in a given experiment. Serial dilutions should be made when multiple ATP concentrations are desired, as this well keep the labeled:unlabeled ATP ratio constant across all concentrations. Final ATP concentrations typically range from 10 µM to at least 1 mM, and each concentration should be assayed in triplicate to obtain reliable kinetic data.\n96- well dot blot apparatus\n\t\nCut an 8 cm x 12 cm piece of nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm pore size).\nPosition nitrocellulose in a dot blot apparatus, ensuring that the membrane fits such that the apparatus is sealed, and all wells are completely covered by the membrane. If assembled correctly, there should be no air leakage when the vacuum is applied.\nTo collect filtrate, connect the apparatus to a secondary side-arm flask. From the valve stem, connect adequate tubing such that the apparatus can be comfortably used without tipping the secondary flask.\nConnect the secondary side-arm flask to aspirator/vacuum source.\nTest that the apparatus is completely sealed by applying vacuum to the apparatus. If the apparatus is correctly assembled, a strong vacuum will be present in all of the wells. All tubing connections can be wrapped in Parafilm or saran wrap to ensure a tight seal.\nOptionally, to test the vacuum, pipet 100 µL of reaction buffer into one well. The vacuum should be strong enough to draw all liquid through the well and onto the membrane.\nTurn off vacuum until all samples are ready to be spotted on the membrane.",
    "2. Reaction Initiation and Quenching\nMixing of reaction components\n\t\nPrior to initiation, prepare all four reaction components as 4x stock solutions: reaction buffer (see section 1.4), histidine kinase (1.5), [γ-32P]-ATP (1.6), and ddH2O.\nMix equal volumes of reaction buffer, histidine kinase, and ddH2O. Allow these reaction components to equilibrate at room temperature for a short time (10 min).\n\t\tNOTE: The final reaction volume is dependent on whether the experiment is time-dependent, enzyme-dependent, or substrate-dependent. Time-dependent reactions must be larger, as multiple aliquots are taken from the same reaction and quenched at the desired time point. The reaction volume will depend on the number of time points desired. The assay is optimized for each spot on the nitrocellulose membrane to contain 30 µL of the reaction. Thus, if 10 time points are desired, the reaction volume must be at least 300 µL (a higher volume such as 330 µL would be preferable in the event of any pipetting errors). Enzyme and substrate-dependent experiments require smaller reaction volumes. The reaction volume for these experiments can be as small as 30 µL, as this is the final volume that will be spotted on the nitrocellulose membrane.\nTo initiate the reaction, add one volume of [γ-32P]-ATP solution to the reaction and mix by pipetting up and down. Track elapsed reaction time with a timer and allow the reaction to proceed for the desired time.\nTo quench the reaction, add 1/13 of the total reaction volume of ice-cold 325 mM H3PO4 to the reaction and mix by pipetting up and down. Alternatively, add an aliquot of the reaction to 325 mM H3PO4.",
    "NOTE: The final concentration of H3PO4 should be 25 mM to sufficiently quench the reaction. For example, add 2.5 µL 325 mM H3PO4 to 30 µL reaction, or add 30 µL reaction to 2.5 µL 325 mM H3PO4. The final pH of the reaction is approximately 4.0. This concentration of H3PO4 has been tested and confirmed to quench the kinase reaction in this buffer without degrading phosphohistidine.\n\t\t\nFor example, mix 7.5 µL 4x reaction buffer, 7.5 µL 4x histidine kinase, and 7.5 µL ddH2O. Initiate reaction with 7.5 µL [γ-32P]-ATP. Quench the reaction with 2.5 µL 325 mM H3PO4.\nImmediately place quenched reactions on ice until all reactions have been terminated.\n\t\tNOTE: To maximize efficiency, it is advisable to initiate one reaction every 15 or 20 s until all reactions are initiated, and once the desired reaction time has passed, quench one reaction every 15 or 20 s until all are quenched. For those who are using the assay for the first time, a longer interval may be more manageable.\n3. Spotting of Quenched Reactions on Nitrocellulose\nStart vacuum on 96-well dot blot apparatus\n\t\nPlace the pre-assembled 96-well dot blot apparatus (section 1.7) into a secondary container. This container should be large enough for the apparatus to be easily disassembled in, as the apparatus and membrane will be radioactive after use.\nApply vacuum to the 96-well dot blot apparatus.\nOnce the apparatus is under vacuum, carefully pipet the quenched reaction directly onto the nitrocellulose membrane in each well. Repeat until all reactions are loaded onto the membrane. Since the binding capacity of nitrocellulose (75 - 110 µg/cm2) is greater than the amount of histidine kinase that is spotted, it can be assumed that nearly all of the kinase binds to the membrane when loaded correctly.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the apparatus used, care must be taken not to puncture the nitrocellulose. Observe that all of the reaction has made contact with the nitrocellulose. It is easy for some or all of the reaction to stick to the walls of the well, and not reach the nitrocellulose.\nWash the wells with 100 µL of ice-cold 25 mM H3PO4. This will allow any reaction volume that may have been trapped in the well to reach the membrane, ensuring complete loading of all reactions. Allow the entire volume to flow through the membrane.\nApparatus disassembly and nitrocellulose membrane transfer\n\t\nCarefully disassemble the apparatus before shutting off the vacuum. Be advised that both the apparatus and nitrocellulose membrane are radioactive at this time. Do not remove any apparatus components from the secondary container at this time.\nWith forceps, carefully transfer the nitrocellulose membrane from the apparatus to a container of approximately 200 mL 25 mM ice-cold H3PO4. Place a lid on this container, as the wash will be radioactive. At this time, the vacuum may be shut off.\n4. Nitrocellulose Processing\nNitrocellulose washing\n\t\nPlace the container with the washing membrane on a rocker. Allow the membrane to gently rock for 20 min.\nAfter 20 min, carefully decant the used wash solution into a large bucket to be used for temporary waste storage. Add 200 mL of ice-cold 25 mM H3PO4 to the membrane and repeat.\n\t\tNOTE: At least three 20 min washes are necessary to remove background [γ-32P]-ATP signal from the membrane. After the third wash, test the used wash solution for radiation with a Geiger counter. Continue washing the membrane as described above until no signal is present in the wash solution.\nNitrocellulose drying",
    "After the membrane is sufficiently washed, allow the membrane to briefly air dry. This typically takes 5 min or less.\n5. Exposure to Storage Phosphor Screen\nNote: This section is optional. Exposing the membrane to a phosphor screen is beneficial in that it allows for visualization of the intensity of radiolabeled kinase in each spot on the membrane. The relative intensity of these spots is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated histidine kinase in each spot. The intensity can be quantified with image processing software, and these results can be compared to those generated from section 7. Furthermore, this step allows for quality control. Abnormalities seen in this scan might explain irregular results obtained from scintillation counting.\nPhosphor screen preparation\n\t\nPrior to exposing the membrane to the storage phosphor screen, expose the phosphor screen to white light for at least 5 min. This ensures that any residual image that may be held by the screen is erased.\nMake sure the screen is clean and dry. If necessary, gently clean the screen with a phosphor screen cleaning solution approved by the screen manufacturer, and wipe dry.\nNitrocellulose membrane preparation\n\t\nCarefully wrap the dry nitrocellulose membrane in a thin plastic wrap to prevent residual moisture from damaging the phosphor screen. Ensure that there are no wrinkles or bubbles.\nExposure to phosphor screen\n\t\nPlace the wrapped nitrocellulose membrane in the storage phosphor screen cassette, place the screen face-down onto the membrane, and close the cassette. Do not open the cassette or move the membrane until it is time to scan the phosphor screen, as membrane shifting during exposure will cause a double or smeared image to be captured.\nExpose for at least 4 h, or as long as the phosphor screen manufacturer suggests.",
    "Once exposure is completed, scan the phosphor screen and capture the image with a phosphor scanner.\n6. Preparing Nitrocellulose Membrane for Scintillation Counting\nPonceau S staining and destaining\n\t\nBriefly immerse the nitrocellulose membrane in Ponceau S staining solution (0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid) for 1 - 2 min. Wet the entire membrane with the stain prior to destaining.\nDecant excess Ponceau S from the membrane.\nRinse the membrane with ddH2O until only the spots from the histidine kinase are stained. Note that this procedure will only work if all spots contain detectable amounts of protein.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary to confirm that the kinase is bound to the nitrocellulose, and that protein loading is even throughout all spots. It also allows the spotted kinase to be easily cut out from the membrane.\nCutting out spots\n\t\nUsing scissors, cut out each spot on the nitrocellulose membrane. It is not necessary to cut perfectly along the edge of the stained spot; if the membrane was washed sufficiently, background due to varying size of cut out spots will be negligible. It is only important to cut out the entire spot for each reaction.\nUsing forceps, carefully transfer each spot into scintillation vials. No scintillation cocktail is necessary as the 32P is readily detectable by Cherenkov radiation.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the spot can be cut out using a sharpened cork borer. Remove each spot from the nitrocellulose with the cork borer, and push it into a scintillation vial with a pin. With this method, the membrane does not need to be touched, further minimizing radiation exposure.\nDetermining CPM/pmol of [γ-32P]-ATP solution\n\t\nSpot several dilutions of [γ-32P]-ATP solution (section 1.5) onto 1 cm x 1 cm squares of nitrocellulose. Briefly air dry.",
    "Using forceps, carefully transfer each square into scintillation vials. No scintillation cocktail is necessary. These samples will be used to generate a standard curve to determine the CPM/pmol of the ATP solution.\n7. Scintillation Counting\nLoad all scintillation vials into scintillation counter cassettes. Load cassettes into scintillation counter.\nExecute scintillation counting program to measure CPM for each vial. These data, along with the CPM/pmol of the radiolabeled ATP mix (from section 6.3), can be used to calculate the amount of phosphorylated histidine kinase present in each spot, and thus the rate of autophosphorylation.18,19\nSubscription Required.
