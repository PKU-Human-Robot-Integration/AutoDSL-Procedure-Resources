The light can not only make the tail vein of an adult mouse visible, but also make the temporal vein of a neonate visible (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAnesthetize mice with prewarmed 1% pentobarbital (80 mg per kilogram) via intraperitoneal injection.\nFor an adult mouse, use one 1 mL syringe with a 27–30 G needle.\nFor a neonate, use one insulin syringe with a 31 G needle.\nNote: In addition, hypothermia could serve for anesthetizing neonates as previously instructed.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]",
    "Note: If the intravenous injection fails, immune labeling of blood leukocytes can be completed by injecting the solution into the left ventricle of the heart as previously instructed (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] The injection should be taken after appropriate anesthesia and 5 min before intracardially perfusion. Be careful of not passing through the middle wall and into the right ventricle.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Injection of 1% Evens blue into the temporal vein of a neonatal mouse, related to step 3\n    \nHarvest the skull cap\nTiming: ∼ 10 min\nThis section describes how to perform intracardial perfusion to get rid of most blood leukocytes and harvest the calvaria containing the dura.\nFive minutes after immune labeling of blood leukocytes, intracardially perfuse mice with ice-cold PBS.\nFor an adult mouse, use 20–30 mL PBS in the perfusion apparatus with a 27–30 G needle. The perfusion should last for at least 5 min.\nFor a neonate, use 8–10 mL PBS in the perfusion apparatus with a 31 G needle. The perfusion should last for at least 3 min.\nCritical: Successful perfusion should turn the liver and the lung pale, which is very important. Make sure the needle is in the left ventricle and press the heart if necessary (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCut the scalp with a midline excision caudal to rostral, from between ears to immediately inferior to eyes.\nPull the scalp laterally to expose the skull.\nRemove the attached flesh on the skull cap.\nRinse the skull cap with ice-cold PBS for wetting and cleaning.\nHold base of skull with forceps and make a transverse cut between the eye sockets.\nCut along the edges of frontal bone, parietal bone, and the interparietal.\nLift the skull cap carefully to avoid the cranial dura sticking to the brain parenchyma.",
    "Note: The cut sequence to harvest the calvaria containing the dura is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. When the skull cap has been cut and lifted, the underlying brain is exposed. The brain tissue should be free of blood after successful perfusion and thereby appears white.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2664-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The cut sequence to harvest the skull cap containing the dura\nExtract the dura mater from the calvaria\nTiming: 1–3 min\nThis section describes how to dissect the entire dura mater from the calvaria, as shown in Methods videos S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]. It is recommended to complete this process under a dissecting microscope.\nPlace the skull cap in 2 mL ice-cold RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS in a pre-chilled 35 mm petri dish.\nUsing pre-chilled curved forceps, hold the skull cap at the area that covers the olfactory bulbs to maintain the skull cap at the bottom of the petri.\nCarefully examine whether small pieces of brain remain attached to the dura mater.\nRemove them using pre-chilled fine forceps.\nGently pull the cranial dura with pre-chilled fine forceps towards the superior sagittal sinus.\nNote: The initial detachment of the cranial dura from the skull cap will facilitate the rest of the dissection.\nContinue loosening the cranial dura from the interior of the skull cap using pre-chilled fine forceps until 360° is reached.\nNote: If areas of the cranial dura stay attached, carefully scrape before continue pulling.\nPull the cranial dura more firmly to make areas above the cisterna magna and at the tip of the transverse sinuses fully detached from the skull.\nNote: These areas of the cranial dura are thicker and thereby should be pulled more firmly to be detached from the skull.",
    "Critical: For neonatal mice, the cranial dura is thinner and softer. The loosened edges of the cranial dura should be wrapped so that they could be firmly grabbed and other areas of the cranial dura could be pulled harder to get fully detached from the membranous skull sutures.\nCarefully examine whether small pieces of skull bone or membranous skull sutures remain attached to the dissected dura mater (particularly at the tip of the transverse sinuses), remove them using pre-chilled fine forceps.\nNote: This process should be completed as fast as possible to avoid massive leukocyte death. But it is essential to extract the whole dura mater from the calvaria to get high-quality dura leukocytes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3.

Illustration of squeezing the dura mater with fine tweezers, related to step 21\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2664-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Image of neonatal and adult meningeal whole mounts dried onto the microscope slide\nMechanical isolation of dura leukocytes\nTiming: ∼ 15 min\nThis section describes how to squeeze the dura mater to release dura leukocytes and harvest the isolated cells by centrifugation.\nPut the dura mater in 2 mL ice-cold RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS in a pre-chilled 35 mm cell culture dish on ice.\nGrab the edge of the dura mater with pre-chilled fine forceps and cut the dura mater into about 4 mm × 4 mm small pieces with pre-chilled surgical scissors.\nQuickly squeeze the small pieces of the dura mater using pre-chilled fine tweezers for about 2 min (100–200 times; Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]) until all the remnants became sticky.",
    "Critical: It is important to keep the temperature low. Use different pairs of pre-chilled fine tweezers in turn to keep them at a low temperature. In addition, avoid squeezing the dura mater too many times because that might damage cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). These procedures are very important for cell viability (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Alternatively, simply cut the dura mater into tiny pieces with pre-chilled surgical scissors or press the dura mater with a pre-chilled 1 mL syringe plunger for about 2 min can also result in mechanical isolation of dura leukocytes, although maybe less efficient (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2664-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Data are representative of two independent experiments.\nPipette liquid containing cells, debris, and sticky remnants of the dura mater onto a 70 μm nylon cell strainer within a pre-chilled 35 mm cell culture dish on ice.",
    "Critical: It is important to make sure that nearly all the liquid goes through the 70 μm nylon cell strainer. Failure to do so will result in inefficient cell extraction (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Avoid bubbling or apply too much pressure which can cause significant cell death (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPlace the filtered sample (1.8–1.9 mL) into a pre-chilled 5 mL round-bottom polypropylene tube on ice.\nCentrifuge at 420 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and carefully aspirate the supernatant without sucking up the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nNote: It is recommended to transfer solution into a 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene test tube with cell strainer snap cap before centrifugation, which can reduce clogging of the flow cytometer.\nCritical: The number of leukocytes in the cranial dura of neonatal mice is considerably low. It is recommended to use a swing-out horizontal centrifuge for efficient recovery (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) and better viability (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nResuspend cells in 3 mL PBS with 2% FBS and repeat step 24.\nResuspend cells in 50–100 μL PBS with 2% FBS on ice until use.\nNote: In our hands, single-cell suspensions of the cranial dura can be kept on ice for at least 120 min without obvious reduction of leukocyte viability (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). If an absolute cell count is essential, remove a small aliquot of the cell suspension and count using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2664-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Comparison of the viability of dura leukocytes after different periods of time sitting on ice\n(A) Representative gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis of live single CD45+ cells.\n(B) Quantification for flow cytometry analysis of live single CD45+ cells.

    "Pause point: Since single-cell suspensions of the cranial dura can be kept on ice for at least 120 min, this step can serve as pause point.\nFlow cytometry analysis\nTiming: ∼ 60 min\nSurface staining, sample acquisition, and gating of dura HSCs are provided in this section.\nWash single-cell suspensions of the cranial dura once with 3 mL FACS washing buffer and repeat step 24.\nLyse red cells.\nDilute 10× RBC Lysis Buffer to 1× with ddH2O immediately prior to use.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL 1× RBC Lysis Buffer and keep the tube on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 3.5 mL FACS washing buffer to the tube to stop cell lysis and repeat step 24.\nNote: This step can be skipped since few red cells are left after successful intracardial perfusion.\nRepeat wash as in step 27.\nBlock Fc receptors.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL Cell Staining Buffer.\nAdd 0.25 μg TruStain FcX™ PLUS (anti-mouse CD16/CD32) Antibody and keep the tube on ice for 5 min.\nAdd fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against cell surface molecules to the tube and keep the tube on ice for 30 min in the dark.\nNote: CD3, CD11b, B220, Gr-1, and Ter119 are used as lineage markers. To determine cell viability, a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit should be used.\nRepeat wash as in step 27 twice.\nResuspend cell pellets in 200 μL 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde diluted on-site from its 16% (w/v) stock with PBS and preserve the sample at 4°C in the dark.\nNote: Fixed cells should be analyzed within 4 h of fixation. Otherwise, the samples should be resuspended in FACS washing buffer because certain fluorescence is sensitive to photo-induced degradation, leading to loss of fluorescence and changes in spillover.\nPause point: This step can serve as an optional stop step.",
    "Acquire the sample with a flow cytometer.\nSet the parameters and identify the FSC-A cut-off for debris (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRun the sample at a low flow rate.\nCollect as many dura cells as possible because the cell number is usually low.\nNote: A Becton Dickinson FACS Fortessa machine can be used for this purpose. We usually refer to femur bone marrow cells from the same mouse to set the parameters.\nAnalyze the data.\nNote: FlowJo version 10 can be used for this purpose. We usually gate CD45+ cells first and then set the scales of FSC-A and SSC-A for further analysis (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Dura HSCs are CD45-IV−LD−CD45+Lin−/lowc-Kit+Sca-1+CD150+CD48− singlets.\nNote: For sorting, surface staining should be performed in FACS washing buffer without NaN3. Immediately before sorting, add 0.2 μg/mL DAPI rather than fixable viability dyes for discrimination of dead cells because DAPI can be used to stain cells without a wash step due to minimal fluorescence in solution and low toxicity. In addition, this protocol is compatible with intracellular staining of cytoplasmic or nuclear antigen."
