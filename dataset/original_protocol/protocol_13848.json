    "This study was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki and local clinical ethics committee (2018/09).\n1. Physical Examination\nNOTE: The provocative tests for diagnosis of the TOS are depicted in Figure 1.\nFor the Adson test (scalene test, Figure 1A), bring the patient’s shoulder to external rotation with slight abduction and a little bit of extension and palpate the radial pulse. Extend the patient’s head backward and rotate toward the tested shoulder. Ask the patient to breathe in and hold their breath.\n\t\nConsider the test positive in cases where reproduction of symptoms or abolition of the radial pulse occurs while symptoms resolve with rotating of the head to the controlateral side.\nFor the costoclavicular brace test (Figure 1B), bring the patient’s arm to the back, depress and retract over the patients' scapula on the ipsilateral side. Check the pulse. If the radial pulse disappears or symptoms are reproduced, the test is deemed positive.\nFor the hyperabduction test (Figure 1C), slightly extend the patient’s arm and palpate the radial artery. Abduct the arm 90-180°. A positive test is a decrease in the pulse of the radial artery from baseline to the new position.\nFor the Roos (East) test (Figure 1D), perform the test in either a sitting or standing position. Take the patient’s shoulders to 90° abduction, externally rotate, and flex elbows to 90°. The elbows should be slightly behind the frontal plane. Have the patient open and close his/her hands for 3 minutes.\n\t\nConsider the test positive if the patient experiences heaviness, ischemic pain or weakness of the arms or numbness and tingling of the hands. Discoloration of the hands is also meaningful for the test.",
    "NOTE: Surgical treatment is the first option in VTOS cases, whereas surgical treatment is performed in NTOS cases after 3 months of conservative therapy without any improvement in their daily life, work life, and sleep quality.\n2. Preoperative clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment\nFor evaluation of the clinical improvement with surgical treatment, make clinical findings in the physical examination, EMG findings, and the QuickDASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand: https://www.hss.edu/physician-files/fufa/Fufa-quickdash-questionnaire.pdf[href=https://www.hss.edu/physician-files/fufa/Fufa-quickdash-questionnaire.pdf]) questionnaire related to symptoms of daily activities and social and psychological preoperative periods.\nDetermine the preoperative EMGs by measuring the compound motor action potential (CMAP), sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and F-wave latency. Make recordings using a commercial EMG/NCV/EP measuring system (e.g., Nihon Kohden Neuropack 2).\n3. Transaxillary first rib resection in a stepwise manner\nPerform anesthesia using a standard anesthetic induction protocol which includes 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium bromide, 0.05 mg/kg midazolam and 1-2 µg/kg fentanyl.\nAdminister tiopenthal sodium at 6 mg/kg for maintenance.\n4. Patient position (Figure 2)\nAfter placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position, wrap the arm, elevate and hang in a 90° abduction position. If needed, reduce traction every 3-5 minutes to prevent postoperative complication.\nUse a solution of 10% sterile povidone-iodine for topical sterilization. Drape the arm, axilla and chest. Use sterile sheets on to rest of the body to prevent contamination.\n5. Reaching the first rib\nUse the surgical instruments are shown in Figure 3 and the Table of Materials.\nMake an incision in a transverse fashion below the axillary hairline extending from the pectoralis muscle anteriorly and the latissimus dorsi muscle posteriorly at a length of 5-7 cm.\nCross the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia to reach the anterior chest wall.\nUse blunt dissection to reach the first rib.",
    "6. Releasing the first rib from muscles and fascia\nPierce the fascia overlying the first rib and dissect away the periosteum overlying the superior part of the rib. Bluntly dissect the inferior edge of the rib from surrounding muscles using monopolar cautery and rib raspatory.\nSplit the intercostal muscles until the costoclavicular ligament at the sternocostal junction and the angular costa in the posterior costovertebral junction.\nIn the superior edge of the first rib, expose the anterior scalene muscle anteriorly and medius scalene muscle posteriorly. Place the curved forceps under the anterior and middle scalene muscles to cut the muscles at the level of their insertion over the first rib, where they are farthest from the neurovascular bundle.\n7. Removal of the first rib or the cervical rib\nStart the resection of the first rib at the sternocostal junction anteriorly. First, turn from its superior edge and then the inferior edge to resect it using a rib cutter from the sternum. Ensure that the neurovascular structures are preserved.\nAfterwards, resect the posterior portion of the rib, and disarticulate the part located distally to the angle of rib; hence complete the rib resection.\nAfter totally freeing the cervical rib from surrounding tissue, resect and disarticulate the rib until the articular surface of the transverse process is seen.\n8. Postoperative Period\nIn postoperative period, perform a chest X-ray to rule out complications, such as pnomothorax.\nRemove the thorax drain on postoperative day 1 in uneventful cases.\nUse nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotic analgesics, and a muscle relaxant for postoperative pain.\nIn the early postoperative period, examine movement of the arm in the operated side. Continue physical therapy for the first two post-operative months.\nAdvise the patient not to perform any exhausting activity with the operated side.\n9. Postoperative clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment",
    "For evaluation of the clinical improvement with surgical treatment, compare clinical findings in the physical examination, EMG findings, and the QuickDASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand: https://www.hss.edu/physician-files/fufa/Fufa-quickdash-questionnaire.pdf[href=https://www.hss.edu/physician-files/fufa/Fufa-quickdash-questionnaire.pdf]) questionnaire related to symptoms of daily activities and social and psychological preoperative and postoperative (3 months) periods.\nCompare the preoperative and postoperative EMGs by measuring the compound motor action potential (CMAP), sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and F-wave latency. Make recordings using a commercial EMG/NCV/EP measuring system (e.g., Nihon Kohden Neuropack 2).\nPerform the physical examination postoperatively to evaluate the pain and paresthesia.\nSubscription Required.
