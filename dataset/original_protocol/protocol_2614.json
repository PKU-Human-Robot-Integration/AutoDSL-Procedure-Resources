    "Note: It is critical to stain the cells immediately after co-incubation and acquired detection immediately after staining.\nWash the cells three times with FACS buffer (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nAssess the phagocytosis efficiency by flow cytometry (BD FACS) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2271-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating strategy for in vitro phagocytosis assay is performed by co-culture of cancer cells (H1975-shcontrol and H1975-shCD47 cells) and BMDMs\nFitC: GFP positive cancer cells; PE-Cy7: F4/80 positive macrophages.\nCritical: Acquire at least 1 × 104 cells per tube. The phagocytic index based on FACS is calculated as the number of F4/80+GFP+ cells divided by the total number of F4/80+ cells.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nIn vitro phagocytosis assay based on confocal microscopy\nTiming: 16 h\nThis section describes how to stain and co-culture the macrophages and cancer cells and phagocytosis efficiency detection for a microscopy-based phagocytosis assay. The staining of macrophages is based on the PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker MINI Kit from Sigma-Aldrich, designed for the staining of membranes of live macrophages (see manufacturer protocol at https://www.sigmaaldrich.cn/CN/zh/product/sigma/mini26[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.cn/CN/zh/product/sigma/mini26]). The staining of macrophages and cancer cells enables us to perform in vitro confocal microscopy-based phagocytosis assay.\nPlace a suspension containing 2 × 106 single macrophages in a conical bottom polypropylene tube and wash once using serum-free DMEM medium.\nCentrifuge the cells 400 × g for 5 min into a loose pellet.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully.\nCritical: Be careful not to remove any cells but leave no more than 25 μL of supernatant.\nPrepare a 2×Cell Suspension by adding 100 μL of Diluent C (Catalog Number CGLDIL) to the cell pellet and resuspend with gentle pipetting to ensure complete dispersion.\nCritical: Do not vortex and do not let cells stand in Diluent C for long periods of time.",
    "Prepare a 2×Dye Solution (4 μm) in Diluent C by adding 0.4 μL of the PKH26 ethanolic dye solution (Catalog Number P9691) to 1 mL of Diluent C in a polypropylene centrifuge tube and mix well to disperse.\nAdd 100 μL of 2×Cell Suspension (step 18) to 100 μL of 2×Dye Solution (step 19) rapidly and mix the sample by pipetting immediately.\nIncubate the cell/dye suspension from step 20 for 3 min with periodic mixing in darkness.\nCritical: Strictly controlled the staining time to avoid overstaining.\nStop the staining by adding 200 μL FBS and incubate for 1 min to allow for binding of excess dye.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C and carefully remove the supernatant without removing cells.\nResuspend cell pellet in 10 mL complete DMEM medium.\nTransfer the suspension to a fresh sterile conical polypropylene tube and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the cell pellet twice with 10 mL of complete DMEM medium to ensure the removal of unbounded dye.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of complete medium.\nCount and seed 2 × 104 macrophages in each well of the 24-well tissue culture plate overnight (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nIncubate macrophages in the starved medium for 12 h.\nAdd 2 × 104 CFSE-labelled cancer cells and incubate at 37°C for 2 h (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nWash the non-phagocytic cancer cells with PBS more than three times and image the cells live under a confocal microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2271-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Phagocytosis of CFSE-labeled A549 cells by PKH26-labeled BMDMs is assessed by confocal microscopy\nRed, macrophages; green, tumor cells. Scale bar: 50 μm.\nCritical: The phagocytosis efficiency is calculated as the number of macrophages containing CFSE+ cancer cells per 100 macrophages.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]",
    "Part two phagocytosis assay in vivo\nTiming: 22 days\nThis section describes the construction of subcutaneously implanted tumor model in Balb/c nude mice, the sorting of macrophages in the subcutaneous tumor and the detecting of phagocytosis efficiency by flow cytometry.\nPurchase 4–6 weeks aged Balb/c nude mice from qualified companies and maintain in SPF rated conditions for one week.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nCount CFSE labeled A549 lung cancer cells and adjust the cell density to 5 × 106/100 μL with DMEM (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nInoculate 5 × 106 CFSE labeled A549 cells subcutaneously in the right flank of the prepared Balb/c nude mice.\nGive the mice intraperitoneal injection of monoclonal LSB2.20 or IgG every 2 days for a total of 4 injections (IgG 50 μg per injection; LSB2.20 at a dose of 25 μg, 50 μg or 100 μg per injection).\nCritical: Before inoculation, sterilize the needle entry site with a 75% alcohol cotton ball.\nSacrifice the mice by CO2 inhalation 21 days later.\nNote: Since CFSE labeling detection relies on the cell proliferation rate, the range of days that phagocytosis detection in vivo can vary in different mouse tumor models.\nMince the tumor tissue in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, add 5 mL digestion buffer, digest at 37°C, shaken at 120 × rpm for 1.5 h, and prepare a single-cell suspension.\nFilter the suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nWash the cells three times with DMEM and resuspend in cold FACS buffer.\nAdjust the cell density to 1 × 106/100 μL with FACS buffer.\nAdd 1 μL APC labeled rat anti-mouse CD11b and PE-Cy7-labeled rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody per 100 μL cell suspension and incubate at 4°C for 30 min in darkness.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspend in cold FACS buffer.",
