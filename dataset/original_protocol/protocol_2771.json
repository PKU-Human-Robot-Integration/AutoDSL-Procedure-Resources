Higher passages alter phenotypic properties that can affect\n      experimental reproducibility. Using the recommended seeding density and\n      confluency at passaging is also crucial to maintain cell genotype and\n      phenotype. After proliferation under standard culture conditions, cells\n      will be seeded on plates with flexible culture surfaces for mechanical\n      conditioning. This step expands the cell population for use in experiments\n      (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\n    \nThaw hMSCs at 37°C.\nAdd 10 mL of warm hMSC media.\n        Centrifuge hMSC at 300G for 3 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\n      \nAspirate culture media.\n        Add 10 mL of warm hMSC media.\n        \nResuspend cells thoroughly.\nSeed hMSC in T75 flask.\n        Passage hMSC at 70%–80% confluence.\n        \nCheck cell confluency under a microscope.\nWarm cell culture media, PBS, and 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37°C.\nAspirate culture media.\nWash cells with 5 mL sterile PBS with 30μM of HEPES.\n            Add 5 mL of warm 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 3 min at 37°C.\n          \n            Add 5 mL of warm cell culture media to deactivate trypsin-EDTA.\n          \n            Centrifuge at 300 G for 3 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\n          \nAspirate culture media.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of warm hMSC media.\nCount cells using hemacytometer.\nPrepare cell density of 40,000 cells/mL.\nSeed cell in T75 flask.\nMonitor cells daily for growth.\nChange media completely every other day.\nBiomechanical conditioning\nTiming: 9 days (for steps 13 to 25)\n    \n      In this step, a mechanical stretching device is used to deliver\n      physiologically mimetic patterns of mechanical strain to cells in culture.\n      A pharmaceutical compound, an EGFR/ERBB-2/4 (E/E) inhibitor (CAS#:",
    "881001-19-0), is also delivered to the cells during the weeklong\n      biomechanical conditioning, and together these treatments result in the\n      generation of enhanced vascular regenerative phenotypes.
