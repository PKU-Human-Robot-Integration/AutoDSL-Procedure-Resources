Synthesis of benzamide from 2-phenylethanol under MnOx catalysis (He et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])\nNote: This procedure can be also applied to other (hetero)aryl primary alcohols referring to He et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nPlace a 10 mm long fusiform magnetic stir bar in a 5 mL glass vial (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and add 40.0 mg (160 mg/mmol based on 2-phenylethanol) MnOx catalyst (prepared in “Preparation of manganese oxides”) to the vial. Then add 2 mL (8.0 mL/mmol based on 2-phenylethanol) 1,4-dioxane to the vial.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1836-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Then seal the autoclave.\nFlush the autoclave with 0.5 MPa O2 3 times and then charge it with 0.5 MPa NH3 and 0.5 MPa O2 in sequence.",
    "Critical: Because the inevitable dissolving of NH3 in the solution can makes the pressure dropped before the reaction performed, to ensure a stable and precise initial pressure, charge the autoclave with 0.7 MPa NH3, keep 20 s and release to 0.5 MPa (the same below).\nPlace the autoclave into 150°C oil bath and stir the reaction for 12 h. Set the speed of stirring to 600 rpm (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and 4E). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: To make sure the autoclave heated evenly, a stainless-steel support and a magnetic stir bar are placed in the oil bath. The temperature of the oil bath should be verified by a temperature sensor to obtain the required reaction temperature (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D, the same below).\nNote: While the reaction system is heated, a temperature gradient between the oil bath and the reaction vial inside the autoclave occurs. The monitoring of the temperature inside the autoclave shows that it takes ∼30 min to preheat the autoclave to the desired reaction temperature after placing the autoclave into 150°C oil bath. Please note the maximum pressure of the autoclave can reach ∼1.5 MPa while heating up the reaction system. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAfter completion of the reaction, cool down the autoclave to 20°C–25°C.
