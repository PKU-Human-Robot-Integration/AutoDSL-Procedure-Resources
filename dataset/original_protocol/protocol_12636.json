  "title": "Characterization of In Vitro Differentiation of Human Primary Keratinocytes by RNA-Seq Analysis",
  "procedures": [
    "Skin biopsies were taken from the trunk of healthy volunteers or patients with p63 mutations, to set up the primary keratinocyte culture. All procedures regarding establishing human primary keratinocytes were approved by the ethical committee of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (“Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Arnhem-Nijmegen”). Informed consent was obtained.\n1. Human primary keratinocyte differentiation by contact inhibition\nPrepare keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) from Keratinocyte Basal Medium (Table of Materials) when necessary.\nMake 500 mL proliferation medium using pre-prepared stocks (KGM-pro; see Table 1).\nMake 500 mL differentiation medium (KGM-dif; see Table 2).\n\tNOTE: KGM with supplements can be kept at 4 °C for two weeks. For longer storage, it can be aliquoted and stored at -20°C.\nSeed primary keratinocytes in the density of 5.0–20 x 103 cells/cm2, depending on the cell proliferative capacity. Add sufficient KGM-pro medium to cover cells.\n\tNOTE: 1) Details of regular cell culture within KGM medium can be found in the website of Lonza13. 2) The seeding density should be tested for each cell line. For example, a normal primary keratinocyte line can be seeded at a density of 5.0 x 103 cells/cm2, whereas a line carrying mutations in the transcription factor p63 that is less proliferative should be seeded at a density of 20 x 103 cells/cm2. 3) Depending on the experimental set up, several dishes or wells of cells should be seeded to allow collecting samples on different differentiation days in replicas.\nRefresh cells with the KGM-pro medium for two days after seeding (seeding on day 0, refreshing for the 1st time on day 3). Afterwards, refresh with KGM-pro medium every other day. Check cells regularly, at least every other day.",
    "Induce cell differentiation when cells are more than 90% confluent by changing the medium to KGM-dif. The day of changing medium to KGM-dif is defined as differentiation day 0. Collect cells for further RNA analyses by first washing 2x with DPBS, afterwards adding in the lysis buffer (from an RNA extraction kit).\n\tNOTE: With the abovementioned seeding density, cells should reach confluency within 7–10 days. Cells can be seeded with a higher initial density to reach confluency sooner. If cells are not proliferative, longer waiting may not give rise to fully confluent cells. A higher seeding density may be required.\nRefresh cells with the KGM-dif medium every day and collect cells on differentiation day 2, 4. and 7 for further RNA extraction.\n2. RNA extraction\nIsolate total RNA. This can be performed using a commercial RNA isolation kit (such as Zymo Quick-RNA MicroPrep RNA), or using phenol14. However, an isolation kit containing a DNAse treatment is highly recommended for RNA-seq samples to prevent DNA contamination and phenol. An example of a commercial RNA-isolation kit is given in the Table of Materials.\nMeasure RNA concentration with a spectrometer. Both DNA and RNA have an absorption peak at 260 nm.",
    "NOTE: 1) The ratio between the absorbances at 260 nm and 280 nm is used to assess the purity of the RNA. A ratio of around 2.0 is generally accepted as ‘pure’ RNA. If the ratio is substantially lower than 2.0, the sample might be contaminated with contaminants that absorb at 280 nm such as proteins, phenols, or other substances. 2) The ratio between the absorbances at 260 nm and 230 nm measures nucleic acid purity. A ratio between 2.0 and 2.2 is expected. If the ratio is substantially lower, the sample might be contaminated with contaminants that absorb at 230 nm such as EDTA, ethanol, or other substances.\n3. RNA quality check\nRun RNA either on a bioanalyzer RNA Pico chip to validate RNA Integrity Number (RIN) quantitatively, or on a gel for a qualitative measure. In general, a RIN of at least eight is highly advisable. However, when extracting RNA from tissues the RIN may be lower.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, quality control can be performed by qPCR on the RNA material. \n4. RNA-seq library preparation \nNOTE: The RNA-seq library preparation is often performed with a commercial kit or under commercial settings. The described protocol is adapted from a commercial kit, KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase (Illumina), with a brief description of all required steps: rRNA depletion with oligo hybridization to human ribosomal RNAs, RNA fragmentation, first-strand synthesis, second-strand synthesis and A-tailing, and cleanup after each step15. Other library preparation kits can also be used for this purpose. It is recommended to perform this step using a commercially available kit, as the quality of generated cDNA library is often more consistent. 2) The following steps are described for 1x library preparation. If preparing several samples, make master mixes with 10% extra volume.\nOligo hybridization and rRNA depletion",
    "Prepare oligo hybridization master mix (total = 11 µL, with 4.4 µL of hybridization buffer, 4.4 µL of hybridization oligos, and 2.2 µL of RNase-free water) and depletion master mix (total = 5.5 µL, with 3.3 µL of depletion buffer and 2.2 µL of RNase H).\nSet up the PCR reaction program on a thermocycler: 95 °C for 2 min; ramp down to 45 °C at -0.1 °C/s; 45 °C pause; 45 °C for 30 min; 4 °C forever.\n\t\tNOTE: Consider starting with double the amount of RNA than necessary for amplification. In the first attempt, use one-half of the amount to continue with the following steps. This is to make sure that there is still material to repeat these steps with a different number of cycles (see step 4.7.2), if the cycles of amplification turn out to be insufficient or overamplified.\nUse between 25 ng and 1 µg of total RNA in 10 µL of RNAse-free water, add 10 μL of oligo hybridization master mix. Place samples in the pre-programmed thermocycler and start the program.\nWhen the program reaches the pause step at 45 °C, add 5 µL of depletion master mix to the 20 µL hybridization reaction without removing it from the thermocycler. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times.\nResume the thermocycler program to continue with the depletion step (45 °C for 30 min).\n\t\tNOTE: 1) Put the beads for rRNA depletion (e.g., KAPA pure beads) at room temperature (RT) during the depletion step for the next part of the protocol. 2) Consider preparing the DNase digestion master mix (for section 4.2), since the reagents are needed directly after the rRNA depletion cleanup.",
    "Perform a 2.2x bead-based KAPA Pure Beads cleanup: combine the RNA mix (25 μL) and KAPA Pure Beads (55 μL), by thoroughly resuspend the beads in the RNA mix by pipetting up and down several times.\nIncubate at RT for 5 min to allow RNA binding to the beads, and place the tube(s) on a magnet rack to capture the beads until the liquid is clear, and carefully remove and discard 60 µL of supernatant.\nKeeping the tube(s) on the magnet, wash 2x with 200 µL of 80% ethanol by incubating the beads with the ethanol for ≥30 s and discard the ethanol.

    "Prepare the Fragment, Prime and Elute Buffer (1x) master mix with 11 µL of Fragment, Prime and Elute Buffer (2x) and 11 µL of RNase-free water.\nThoroughly resuspend the beads with purified, DNase-treated RNA in 22 µL of Fragmentation, Prime and Elute Buffer (1x) by pipetting up and down several times.\nIncubate at room temperature for 3 min to elute RNA off the beads, then place the tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads until the liquid is clear.\nCarefully transfer 20 µL of supernatant into a tube(s). Discard the tube(s) with beads.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a safe stopping point, as samples can be stored at -20 °C for ≤24 h.\nPlace the tube(s) in a thermocycler and carry out the fragmentation and priming at 94 °C for 6 min. Resulting in approximate 200–300 bp long fragments.\n\t\tNOTE: Incubate for 8 min at 94 °C for 100–200 bp fragments. When using partially degraded RNA, fragment between 1–6 min at 85 °C depending on the severity of degradation.\nPlace the tube(s) on ice and proceed immediately to first strand synthesis.\nFirst strand synthesis\nPrepare  first strand synthesis master mix (total = 12 µL, with 11 µL of first strand synthesis buffer and 1 µL of KAPA script).\nSet up the PCR reaction program on a thermocycler: 25 °C for 10 min; 42 °C for 15 min; 70 °C for 15 min; 4 °C forever.\nOn ice, combine 20 µL of fragmented primed RNA with 10 µL of first strand synthesis master mix.

Using a highly sensitive fluorescent dye-based kit (e.g., Denovix Qbit, see Table of Materials), or if the concentration seems to be below 0.5 ng/μL, requantify using a more sensitive qPCR approach (e.g., Kappa Quantification, see Table of Materials).\nDetermine the fragment size of the library, using high sensitive electrophoresis (e.g., a bioanalyzer).\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, quality control by qPCR can be performed before sequencing (Appendix) using a diluted prepared library instead of cDNA.\nSequencing\nSend the library for sequencing. For RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis, a sequencing depth of reads between 10–25 million per sample is generally sufficient.\n5. Data pre-processing \nQuality check Fastq files\nDownload and install Trimgalore16 to remove low quality base pairs and empty reads within the Fastq files.",
    "NOTE: 1) Most software mentioned here only works in Linux. If limited to a Windows computer, it is possible to run analyses on a Linux server using the software MobaXterm or Putty. Keep in mind that for genome indexing a lot of random-access memory (RAM) is required (around 64 GB). 2) Installing all required software into a conda environment is highly recommended. This will allow easy software installation and package management. For more information on conda, visit <https://docs.conda.io>.\nCreate a directory (folder) for the data e.g. the folder ‘RNA_seq_KC_diff’. Set this as the working directory by typing: “cd /home/user/RNA_seq_KC_diff/”.\n\t\tNOTE: For an overview of the folder structure, see ‘folder_structure.txt’ in the supplementary coding files.\nCreate several folders in the working directory with the specific names: ‘Fastq’, ‘CRCh38_fasta’, ‘CRCh38’, ‘scripts’, and ‘Mapping’.\nMove the fasta files of the sequenced data into the fastq folder. Alternatively, generate soft links using the command: “ln –s home/user/old_location_fastq/FastqFile home/user/RNAseq_KC_diff/Fastq/Fastqfile” to the Fastq files to save disk space.\nRun Trim galore on the Fastq files, see the TrimGalore.txt file for the code to copy paste into bash. Change folder names and settings within the command where necessary.\nMapping\nDownload a genome to map the reads to, e.g., hg38 ensembl release 97 (unmasked version): ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-97/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCH38.primary_assembly.fa.gz ; and the corresponding gene annotation file: hg 38 gene annotation ensembl release 97, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-97/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.97.gtf.gz. Transfer both the files to the CRCh38_fasta folder.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively use a different version of the genome, for example, the UCSC version of hg38, if mapping to transcript IDs rather than gene IDs is preferred.\nInstall STAR 2.7.117.",
    "Generate an in-house reference genome using STAR 2.7.1 by the generate genome script (see Supplemental Coding Files). Change the amount of threads to what the processer has (--runThreadN X). Change folder names and settings in this script where necessary. Run it by copy/pasting into bash.\nInstall samtools 1.918 for indexing the bam files and gzip to compress the wiggle files.\nAlign the Trim Galore validated sequencing reads to the human genome assembly hg38 (ensembl release 97) using STAR 2.7.1 followed by indexing using samtools and gzip. This should be performed using the script map_fastq.txt (see Supplemental Coding Files). Change the folder names and settings in this script where necessary. Run it by copying/pasting into bash.\n\t\tNOTE: STAR mapping generates several output files, including a bam file, a wiggle file, and read counts table named *_ReadsPerGene.out.tab, which can directly be used concatenated by R to use as input for Deseq2.\nGenome browser visualization\nInstall wigToBigWig from the UCSC genome browser tools to generate bigwig files with the big2bw script19.\nTransfer the files ‘convertBigWigChroms.py’ and ‘CRCH38_ensembl2UCSC.txt’ from the supplementary coding files to a folder ‘scripts’ in the working directory.\nMake the convertBigWigChroms.py executable (using the command: ‘chmod +x scripts/convertBigWigChroms.py’ on a Linux machine).\nGenerate bigWig files from the Wiggle files, using the script wig2bw.txt (see Supplemental Coding Files). Run it by copy/pasting into bash.\nInput the BigWig files on the UCSC genome browser or Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) for visualization.\n6. RNA-seq data analysis\nInput sample data into Deseq2 \nDownload and install Rstudio (version 1.1.456) and R (version 3.6).\nInstall all the required R packages (see Supplemental coding files).\n\t\tNOTE: For a detailed R-markdown file showing all programming code and output, see the attached files: “RNA_seq_kc_differentiation_wt.html” and “RNA_seq_kc_differentiation_patient.html”. A general description of all steps is included below.",
    "Generate a count table from the ReadsPerGene.out.tab files.\nWrite a sample data file, containing all filenames, the day of differentiation and other relevant sample data. For an example sample file, see “sample_data_example.csv” in the Supplemental Coding Files.\nUse the count table and sample data to generate a Deseq220 object containing both the countable and sample data.\nGene expression normalization, sample distance and PCA\nNormalize the count table in the Deseq2 object, using either Deseq2 rld, or vst normalization. Rld normalization is preferred, but with many samples, vst normalization is much faster.\nPlot sample distance based on the normalized read count intensities using the “dist” function in R and subsequently performing “hclust” clustering based on sample distance. Plot the heatmap itself using the pheatmap package.\nGenerate a PCA plot of the normalized read count intensities using the plotPCA function of Deseq2.\n\t\tNOTE: PCA serves as a tool in exploratory data analysis and can be used to visualize distance and relatedness between different samples.\nDifferential/highly variable gene expression analysis\nCalculate either the differential genes using the Deseq2 result function. However, when assessing changes over several timepoints in which pairwise comparisons are not applicable, use highly variable genes. In this case, extract the top 500 highly variable genes via ordering on the variance between samples from different time points with the rowVars function.",
    "NOTE: In our analysis, for the control samples, the top 500 highly variable genes (the genes with the highest standard deviation of their normalized intensity across days of differentiation) were used for further analysis. However, for the diseased vs control analysis differentially expressed genes between disease and healthy controls over time were calculated by Deseq2 using a multiple testing corrected p-value of 1 x 10-4 as a cutoff. Another possible filtering step is to exclude differential genes changing less than a certain fold change cutoff.\nPerform kmeans clustering on the differential or highly variable genes to cluster them by different expression patterns.\nVisualize differential or highly variable genes in a heatmap using the pheatmap package. The intensity plotted in the heatmap is the Deseq2 normalized intensity with the median value subtracted.\nGene Ontology (GO) annotation enrichment analysis\nGenerate a list of expressed background genes by taking all genes with more than 10 counts in a single sample.\nPerform GO analysis using online tools such as GOrilla21. Use the lists of the differential/highly variable genes in clusters as “gene list”, and the background genes as the background for comparison.\n\t\tNOTE: More advanced R-users can use the package clusterProfiler22 to automate Go-term enrichment analysis.\nSubscription Required.
