    "1. Preparation of dissection and imaging media\nNOTE: The media best suited for this live imaging experiment contains Schneider's Drosophila media containing 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.6x Pen-Strep, and 200 µg/mL bovine insulin, hereafter referred to as Complete Schneider's media.\nPerform the media preparation under sterile conditions to ensure that it does not become contaminated. The media was developed to support Drosophila ovarioles for extended periods of time9.\nAdd 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.6x Pen-Strep, and 200 µg/mL bovine insulin to the Schneider's media.\nMix the contents well and store at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Insulin does not dissolve completely in the Complete Schneider's media, and you will notice a precipitate settle in the bottom of the tube.\nMake aliquots of the media, being sure to leave the precipitate as it will interfere with imaging.\n\t​NOTE: This solution may be used within one month if stored in aliquots at 4 °C.\n2. Collection of Drosophila for dissection\nNOTE: Detailed Drosophila collection and dissection procedures may also be found in Weil et al.10 and Parker et al.11.\nFor optimal female germ cell imaging, first prepare a vial containing standard cornmeal fly food and a dab of wet yeast paste that is the consistency of peanut butter. This ensures the female flies are well-fed and will produce all follicle developmental stages for imaging.\nFor optimally healthy flies, collect 0-1 day old females and transfer with males into a fly food vial containing wet yeast paste.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the sleeping flies do not contact the yeast paste as they can stick to it.\nFeed the flies 3-7 days, changing the vial and the yeast paste daily.\n\t​NOTE: Make sure the yeast paste contacts the fly food so it does not dry out.\n3. Drosophila ovary dissection",
    "NOTE: It is important to prepare the media solutions fresh because hydrogen peroxide is susceptible to oxidation and TMRE degrades over time.\nRight before dissection, in Complete Schneider's media, prepare a fresh aliquot of 2 µM H2O2 solution, a fresh aliquot of 46 nM tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE), and a fresh aliquot of a 46 nM TMRE solution containing 2 µM H2O2.\nFor ovary dissection, use two pairs of fine forceps and a pair of electrolytically sharpened tungsten needles12. To dissect the ovaries, fill 2-3 wells of a glass bottom dissecting dish (watch glass) with Complete Schneider's that has been warmed to room temperature.\nAnaesthetize the vial of fattened flies with carbon dioxide and segregate the desired number of female flies to be dissected. Place a single fly in the media using forceps.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, gently grasp the fly by the thorax using one pair of fine forceps. With the other pair of forceps, grasp the posterior, and gently pull to remove the ovaries.\n\tNOTE: if the ovaries do not come out smoothly using this method, the entire abdomen may also be removed from the fly, and the ovaries can be gently squeezed out of either end of the abdomen using forceps.\nRemove any extraneous cuticle or tissue, then transfer the ovaries to a new well containing fresh media. The ovaries should still be moving from the surrounding muscle sheath.\n4. Preparing ovarioles for imaging\nUsing sharpened tungsten needles, gently tease the ovarioles apart, taking care to remove the surrounding muscle sheath (Figure 1).\nGently tease away any muscle sheath and nerve fibers attached to the isolated ovarioles (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: If the muscle sheath is not removed, the ovariole will twitch and move, causing problems with image acquisition (Video 1).",
    "If the subcellular structures of interest are endogenously labeled, proceed to Step 4.4. If the structures of interest will be labeled with a fluorescent dye, proceed to Section 5.\nOnce the ovarioles have been cleanly dissected, using a micropipette, transfer them in a 100 µL drop of Complete Schneider's imaging media into the glass depression of a glass bottom dish. The individual ovarioles will sink to the bottom of the droplet.\nProceed to Section 6 for imaging.\n\t​NOTE: For imaging mitochondria and Clu bliss particles, no more than five-ten minutes should elapse from the start of dissection to imaging.\n5. Staining mitochondria with TMRE\nNOTE: Additional detailed procedures on live staining of mitochondria with fluorescent dyes may be found in Parker et al. 2017.\nAfter step 4.3, transfer the isolated ovarioles in a 100 µL drop of 46 nM TMRE media into the glass depression of a glass bottom dish. The individual ovarioles will sink to the bottom of the droplet.\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 minutes. Place the lid onto the glass-bottom dish and place the dish into a covered box for the duration of the experiment to protect from light.\n\tNOTE: After incubation, samples can be imaged directly with no washes.\nRepeat steps 5.1-5.2 to prepare at least two dishes of TMRE-labeled ovarioles, one to serve as an experimental group and one to serve as a control.\n6. Live image acquisition\nOnce the ovarioles are mounted, place one of the glass bottom dishes onto the microscope and configure the imaging parameters as necessary. The optimum excitation/emission wavelengths for the TMRE used here are 549 nm/574 nm.\nAfter locating the desired field of view, acquire still images or brief videos of one or more ovarioles as desired as a record of pre-treatment conditions.",
    "7. Addition of hydrogen peroxide during imaging\nPause live imaging, remove the lid from the glass bottom dish, and carefully add 100 µL of 2 µM H2O2 solution to the dish using a micropipette if imaging endogenously labeled structures. If imaging mitochondria, carefully add 100 µL of 46 nM TMRE with 2 µM H2O2 solution to the dish using a micropipette (Video 2).\n\t\nAvoid breaking the surface of the existing media droplet or adding the solution too quickly so as not to displace the ovarioles resting on the bottom of the dish (Video 2).\nReplace the dish lid (dish cover), relocate and refocus the desired field of view if necessary, and resume imaging (Video 3, Video 4, Figure 3, Figure 4).\n\t\nTake care to resume imaging as quickly as possible after H2O2 addition as the experimental treatment is time-sensitive (Video 5).\nAcquire still images or brief videos of one or more ovarioles as desired. This will serve as a record of post-treatment conditions.\nFor the control, place the second glass bottom dish onto the microscope and repeat Section 6.\nRepeat step 7.1, this time adding 100 µL of TMRE-only media to the dish. If imaging endogenously labeled structures, add 100 µL of the Complete Schneider's media-only solution.\nRepeat steps 7.2 and 7.3 to acquire data for the control group.\n\tNOTE: For imaging mitochondria and Clu bliss particles, no more than three-five minutes should elapse from the addition of hydrogen peroxide to imaging."
