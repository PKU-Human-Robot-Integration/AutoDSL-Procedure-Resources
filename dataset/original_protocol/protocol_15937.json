    "There are several commercial kits available for DNA extraction, with various applications and proprietary reagents. For best results with hair shafts, this protocol combines both the Applied Biosystems PrepFiler™ Forensic DNA Extraction Kit and the Qiagen QiaAmp® DNA Investigator Kit, as recommended by Gallimore et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0008]). The QiaAmp® protocol is followed for the digestion and lysis portion of the extraction (dissolving of the hair fragment in the lysis solution), and the PrepFiler™ protocol is used for purification of the extract. A 2-cm cutting of hair is recommended, but whole mitogenome sequences can be obtained from as little as 1 mm of rootless hair (Canale et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0004]). The following extraction protocol is robust, routinely resulting in >4000 mtDNA copies/µl from 5-mm hair cuttings. The protocol also describes a cleaning procedure for hair fragments prior to extraction. The resulting extract can then be quantified, amplified, and sequenced (see Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-prot-0002] to 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-prot-0004]).\nMaterials\n10% (v/v) commercial bleach (7 mM sodium hypochlorite solution)\n70% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH; Decon Labs, cat. no. 64-17-5) or deionized water\nHuman hair sample(s), ≥1 mm\n5% (w/v) Terg-a-zyme (Alconox, cat. no. 1304-1)\n100% EtOH, 200 proof (molecular grade; VWR, cat. no. 71006-012)\nMolecular-grade water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10977023)\nQiagen® Buffer ATL (Qiagen, cat. no. 939011)\n1.0 M dithiothreitol (DTT; Promega, cat. no.

Prepare a dead-air box with a UV light source in which to perform the extraction by decontaminating the working surface with 10% commercial bleach, followed by 70% EtOH or deionized water.\nIdeally, the hood will have a UV light that can be used to further decontaminate the surface.\nCAUTION: Avoid direct exposure to UV light when using a UV lamp.\n2. Using the UV Stratalinker, irradiate all solutions except proteinase K as well as 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes, forceps, and a magnetic stand.\nWhen using the UV Stratalinker, solutions and supplies are typically irradiated for 30 to 45 min.\n3. Secure human hair sample to a clean surface (e.g., a piece of butcher paper or weigh boat) using laboratory tape.\nIf root material is present and the most discriminating information for identity testing is desired, then chromosomal DNA markers should be targeted. The hair shaft has limited to no DNA for chromosomal analysis. If mtDNA is the desired target and root material is present, this section of the hair should be tested.\n4. Cut a fragment of hair from 1 mm to 2 cm in length with a clean disposable scalpel.\nMore hair can be extracted, if available.\n5. Using UV-irradiated forceps cleaned with 10% bleach followed by 70% EtOH, place hair cutting into a UV-irradiated 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml UV-irradiated 5% Terg-a-zyme.\nClean the forceps with 10% bleach followed by 70% EtOH between hair cuttings.\n6.

Transfer hair cutting, using sterile forceps, to a tube containing 1 ml UV-irradiated molecular-grade water. Perform the water wash in duplicate by transferring the cutting to a second tube containing 1 ml UV-irradiated molecular-grade water.\nHair cuttings can be viewed microscopically to characterize the hair and to assess whether biological material remains on the surface of the hair.\n9. Place the hair cutting, using clean forceps, into a tube containing 300 µl UV-irradiated Qiagen® Buffer ATL.\nVerify that a precipitate has not formed in the ATL buffer. If it has, heat the solution to 70°C with gentle agitation prior to adding the hair cutting.\n10.

    "This procedure is a custom mtDNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (mtqPCR) duplex (Gallimore et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0008]). It utilizes a small target of 69 base pairs (bp) in length to quantify the number of mtDNA copies per unit volume and a large target of 283 bp in length to assess degradation of mtDNA templates. See Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-tbl-0001] for primer and probe sequences. The assay does not contain an internal PCR control (IPC) because the extraction outlined in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-prot-0001] does not typically retain elements inhibitory to the mtqPCR assay. The DNA standard used in the assay is the Applied Biosystems Quantifiler™ HP standard; the Quantifiler HP kit is designed to quantify the amount of chromosomal DNA in an extract, including an assessment of degradation. Alternatively, a synthetic standard of the target amplicons can be purchased and a known number of molecules of mtDNA per unit volume determined from the mass of synthetic DNA (Niederstätter et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0018]; Timken et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0022]). Regardless of the source of the standard DNA, the copies of mtDNA/µl in the standard must be established. Note that for this protocol, the number of copies were confirmed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) using a digital droplet PCR approach. The stock standard of known concentration is used to make the necessary dilutions to serve as the standard curve. The mtqPCR reactions are prepared for amplification on the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Real-Time PCR System. Although other qPCR instruments can be used, optimized conditions for the custom assay have only been established for the 7500.\nTable 1.\n                Primer and Probe Sequences for mtqPCR Custom Assay\ntable:\n﻿Oligonucleotide,Sequence (5’ → 3’)a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-tbl1-note-0001_19]\nmtND1-F,CCC TAA AAC CCG CCA CAT CT\nmtND1-R,GAG CGA TGG TGA GAG CTA AGG T\nmtND1-probe,VIC-CCA TCA CCC TCT ACA TC-MGB",

MGB, minor groove binder.\nThe amplification of extracted mtDNA can have varying results depending on the amount of added template. To assist in obtaining optimal amplification results, a quantification step is performed first. The measured concentration of mtDNA in the extract can then be used to ensure an adequate amount of template is added to the amplification reaction. This assay is also designed to assess degradation of mtDNA using the following equation:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\frac{{Small\\ Amplicon\\ Concentration}}{{Large\\ Amplification\\ Concentration}} = Degradation\\ Index\\ \\left( {DI} \\right) \\end{equation*}$$\nA degradation index (DI) of <1 indicates low degradation, 1 to 10 indicates moderate degradation, and >10 indicates extensive degradation.

Based on the value for the small target (mtND1), calculate how much to dilute the extract to achieve the ideal input amount for amplification as described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-prot-0003].\nIn addition, the DI for an extract can be calculated using the ratio of the small to large amplicon amounts. The higher the DI, the greater the chance that target amplicons will drop out. In addition, higher DI values may indicate that templates are damaged, increasing the noise observed in the sequence data.",
    "MPS of extracted mtDNA from the hair shaft (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-prot-0001]) requires an enrichment step. This protocol uses the PowerSeq® Whole Mito System from Promega, amplifying the entire human mitogenome as 161 amplicons in a single PCR reaction, ranging in size from 92 to 254 bp in length. The small size of the amplicons enables analysis of degraded samples and use of a dual amplification process to minimize the possible formation of concatemers, especially from the most degraded samples, whereas a single amplification approach can be used for samples with less degradation. The amplified products are then ready for library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq® or MiSeq® FGx™ system (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-prot-0004]).\nMaterials\nPowerSeq® Whole Mito Amp and Prep Kit (Promega, cat. no.

    "One of the most important and challenging aspects of forensic mtDNA testing is the analysis of the sequence data. MPS instruments, including the MiSeq, provide data as FASTQ files that contain the adapter-trimmed DNA sequences and quality scores (Liu & Harbison, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0013]). A variety of software packages can be used to visualize and analyze the data. This protocol uses the SoftGenetics GeneMarker® HTS software (Holland et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0011]). The sequence reads are first aligned phylogenetically to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) (Bandelt & Parson, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0001]; Parson et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0019]). The software then identifies differences between the consensus sequence and the rCRS to generate variant call format (VCF) files. The consensus sequence is reported as a haplotype, which can be used to identify the haplogroup of the individual associated with the sample (Huber et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0012]). It is expected that a laboratory will develop minimum criteria for reviewing, interpreting, and reporting the results generated by the software based on validation studies, guidelines such as the SWGDAM mtDNA interpretation guidelines (SWGDAM Guidelines, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0021]), and the International Society for Forensic Genetics (ISFG) guidelines for mtDNA typing (Parson et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0019]), literature references, and casework experience. The following protocol is a general framework for the analysis and interpretation of mtDNA. Details of the analysis and interpretation process can be found in McElhoe and Holland (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0015]) and McElhoe et al.

Select Illumina as the Sequencer.\ng. Select default settings for Filter Settings or set the settings to the desired values:\ni. The Variant Percentage serves as a threshold for the reporting of minor sequence variants. If set at 2%, the value can be increased when performing data analysis. Setting the value higher does not allow for reduction of the value during data analysis.",
    "ii. The Variant Allele Coverage value serves as a threshold for the number of variant reads required to call a minor variant; it is set at 40 reads. At a 2% Variant Percentage threshold, this means that total coverage must be at least 2000 reads in order to report minor variants at 2% (40/2000 = 0.02).\niii. The Total Coverage value is set at 200 reads to ensure that minor variants can always be reported at 20% or higher. However, this value can be set lower (10 to 50 reads) for haplotype assessment without analysis of minor variants.\niv. The Allele Score Difference serves as a quality assessment filter and is set at 10. This filter relates to the quality score of the major SNP or insertion (note that deletions are treated differently, using the quality score of surrounding nucleotide positions) compared to the quality score for a minor variant. If the difference between the two scores is greater than 10, the minor variant will not be reported. This limits the reporting of low-quality variants.\nv. The Allele Balance Ratio serves as a quality assessment filter and is set at 2 for SNPs and 5 for INDELs. The ratio for total reads (Read 1 vs. Read 2, low/high number of reads) is compared to the ratio for reads for a specific reported allele or variant (Total vs. Variant). If the ratio is greater than the threshold, then the variant is not reported; for example, if a SNP balance ratio is more than twice the ratio of total reads, then the variant is not reported. This filter guards against strand bias associated with noise in the data.\nCustom filter settings that allow for routine analysis of mitogenome sequences when using the Promega PowerSeq WMG kit can be found in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0003].",

    "The pileup for a sample data file. The top panel reports on read depth across the mitogenome. The reference profile is compared to the pileup, and nucleotides with the largest percentage of a specific variant are reported as the consensus profile. For example, position 152 is a T-to-C transition in the viewed pileup. The major profile (variants with the largest percentage of reads) and the minor profile can be viewed separately or together.\n7. Assess the following items for each sample:\n         \nThe distribution of reads across the mitogenome: The top panel in Figures 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0006] and 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0007] reflects the read density (y-axis) and the nucleotide position of the mitogenome (x-axis). This can be viewed on a global (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0006]) or local (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0007]) level.\nIndividual nucleotide positions in the haplotype: Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0007] is a zoomed-in version of nucleotide positions 136 to 187. A SNP can be seen at position 152 (T-to-C transition). The Reference sequence (rCRS) can be seen along the top of the pileup, with the consensus sequence of the sample immediately below. The green bars reflect sequence motifs that help to properly align sequences to produce phylogenetically correct haplotypes. Standard motif files are provided with the software, which can be easily customized to capture newly identified haplotype motifs.\nMajor and minor variants: The table at the bottom of Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0007] lists major and minor variant calls. Major variants reflect the reportable haplotype of the sample. Minor variants are assessed as possible instances of instrument noise, heteroplasmy, contamination, nuclear mtDNA inserts (NUMTs) (Marshall & Parson, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0014]), mixtures, and/or the result of DNA damage (Holland et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0009]; McElhoe & Holland, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0015]; McElhoe et al., 2022)[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-bib-0016].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4cd014aa-d748-40d6-ac5c-df61092596ec/cpz1865-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",

The blue and red segments of the read depth represent forward and reverse sequence data of the same region of sequence.\n8. Generate reports for each sample.\nA variety of reports can be generated for each sample, including coverage, read length, and aligned read length. An example of these data can be viewed in Figures 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0008] and 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0009]. Minimum, maximum, and average coverage is recorded, including areas of sequence that have fallen below the minimum threshold of 200 reads to be reported or have no reads aligned (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0008]). Once the reads go through the various filters and are aligned, there is a small drop in the aligned maximum read length, but on average, there is little change in the data (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.865#cpz1865-fig-0009]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/92490180-3244-43ab-95a1-4fb5adc3d7e1/cpz1865-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nThe read depth coverage curve for a given sample.
