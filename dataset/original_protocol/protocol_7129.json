  "procedures": [
    "Virus propagation HCoV-OC43 was propagated in HCT-8 or RD cell lines. HCoV-229E was propagated in MRC-5 or Huh-7 cell lines. HCoV-NL63 was initially propagated in the HEK-293T-hACE2 cell line, followed by additional 3-4 passages in Vero E6 or Huh-7 cell lines.Note: For all cell lines we have tried, only the HEK-293T-hACE2 cell line produces a high titer of HCoV-NL63, and the propagated HCoV-NL63 virus was accommodated in the Vero E6 or Huh-7 cell lines to allow CPE development and plaque formation. Cell seeding (Day 0)Note: All procedures should be carried out under aseptic conditions and in the sterile environment of a laminar flow cabinet. For a T75 flask of cell culture at 90-95% confluency, aspirate the 20 mL of cell culture medium and rinse the cells with DPBS buffer (10 mL of buffer is used for a 75-cm2 flask) by gentle agitation to remove any remaining serum, which might inhibit the action of trypsin. Repeat this step once.Add trypsin-EDTA solution (3 mL is used for a 75-cm2 flask) to the cell monolayer in the flask, agitate gently, and incubate the flask at 37°C for 5-10 min.Lightly tap the flask to detach the cells and add prewarmed (to room temperature) complete culture medium (10 mL for a 75-cm2 flask). Gently disperse the medium by pipetting with a serological pipette over the cell monolayer surface several times to ensure >95% recovery of cells. Pipet up and down for a few times to make sure that a homogeneous suspension is obtained.Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at room temperature (20-30°C) to spin down the cells.Aspirate the supernatant and add 10 mL of complete culture medium to resuspend the cells.",
    "Count the cell density of the suspension in step e using a cell counter.Transfer approximately 1 × 106 cells into a 175-cm2 flask and bring the total volume of the cell suspension to 40 mL with complete culture medium. This will allow cells to achieve 70-80% confluency 18-24 h after seeding.Incubate the flask in a cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 37°C).Virus infection (Day 1)Check the cell confluency in the 175-cm2 flask using a phase-contrast inverted microscope; cells should be at 70-80% confluency.Warm DMEM medium in a 37°C metallic beads bath (a replacement for water bath to avoid potential contamination due to microbial growth in the water) and thaw the virus stocks (the initial virus was obtained from BEI Resources and stored at -80°C).Prepare virus infection medium by adding FBS into DMEM to a final concentration of 2%. For 50 mL of DMEM, add 1 mL of FBS.Dilute 100 µL of the virus stock (from step b) into 10 mL of virus infection medium and mix well by pipetting up and down a few times.Aspirate the medium in the 175-cm2 flask and rinse the cells with PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer (50 mL of buffer is used for a 175-cm2 flask).Aspirate the PBS, calcium, and magnesium buffer.Infect the cells in the 175-cm2 flask by adding 10 mL of virus dilution prepared in step d. Gently swirl the flask to allow the virus dilution to evenly cover the cell monolayer.Incubate the infected cells in the 175-cm2 flask in a cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E; 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 1-2 h. Swirl the flask every 15 min to allow the virus dilution to evenly cover the cell monolayer to facilitate virus attachment to the infected cells.",
    "Aspirate the virus dilution in the 175-cm2 flask and add 40 mL of virus infection medium into the flask.Incubate the 175-cm2 flask in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E; 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 3 days.Virus collection (Day 4)Collect the supernatant in the 175-cm2 flask in a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4,000 × g at room temperature (20-30°C) for 10 min. This step spins down the cells or cell debris in the supernatant.Note: HCoVs achieve the highest viral titer 2-3 days post infection, which is before significant CPE will be observed, and the titer starts to decrease afterwards. Thus, the virus should be collected at no more than 3 days post infection. Transfer supernatant to another 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube using a 10 mL serological pipette. Filter the supernatant through a sterile 0.2 µm filter to remove any remaining cell debris. Aliquot the virus into sterile 1.5 mL DNase/RNase-free tubes at 1 mL per tube. Label each tube with the virus name and the date collected. Flash freeze the tubes (recommended but not necessary) and store all tubes in a -80°C freezer for future use.CPE assay - Titrate the virus stock We have examined different cell lines for HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 in both the CPE and plaque assays, and the results are listed in Table 2. HCoV-OC43 can develop complete CPE in the RD, MRC-5, and BSC-1 cell lines. HCoV-229E can develop complete CPE in MRC-5, Huh-7, and RD cell lines. HCoV-NL63 can develop complete CPE in Vero E6, Huh-7, MRC-5, and RD cell lines.",

    "Cell seeding (Day 0)Steps a-f is the same as in A. Virus propagation.Dilute the cells with complete culture medium. At least 12 mL of media with a density of approximately 2.5 × 104 cells/mL is needed for one 96-well plate. This will allow the cells to achieve 80-90% confluency at 18-24 h after seeding and be ready for virus infection.Mix the cell suspension by pipetting up and down a few times and transfer the suspension to a sterile reservoir. Dispense 100 µL of the cell suspension into each well of the 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.Note: Mixing the cell suspension several times to ensure it is homogeneous. Repeat periodically for even distribution. Cover the plate with a matched lid and incubate the cells in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 37°C) for 18-24 h.Virus infection (Day 1)Note: Removing and replacing reagents in the wells needs to be performed gently and carefully to avoid disturbing the cell monolayer. A brief centrifugation step (200 × g for 5 min) can be included if necessary. Check the cell confluency in the 96-well plate, using a phase-contrast inverted microscope; cells should be 80-90% confluency.Warm DMEM medium at 37°C in a beads basket and thaw one tube of HCoV virus stock from the -80°C freezer.Prepare virus infection medium by adding FBS into DMEM to a final concentration of 2%. For 30 mL of DMEM, add 0.6 mL of FBS.Serially dilute the propagated HCoV virus from 101 to 104 folds: Label four 15 mL sterile centrifuge tubes with 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, and 10-4, and add 2.7 mL of virus infection medium into each tube.",

    "To the 96-well plate prepared in step e, add 100 µL of virus infection medium into columns 1-2 and 11-12 (No virus), 100 µL of virus dilution from the 10-1 tube into columns 3-4 (10-1), 100 µL of virus dilution from the 10-2 tube into columns 5-6 (10-2), 100 µL of virus dilution from the 10-3 tube into columns 7-8 (10-3), and 100 µL of virus dilution from the 10-4 tube into columns 9-10 (10-4).Note: A small volume of 100 µL of virus dilution was used for infecting to facilitate virus attachment to the cells. Incubate the plate in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E; 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 1-2 h to ensure viral adsorption.Add 100 µL of virus infection medium into each well in the 96-well plate to bring the total volume in each well to 200 µL, which is suitable for cell maintenance longer than 3 days.Incubate the plate in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E; humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 4-5 days.Microscopic evaluation (Days 2, 3, 4, and 5)Examine the cells using a phase-contrast inverted microscope daily post-infection, and record changes in cell morphology and CPE development.Neutral red uptake assay (Day 5)Note: Steps a-k do not require sterile conditions or sterilized materials. Centrifuge the neutral red working solution (prepared one day prior to the neutral red uptake assay and incubated in the 37°C cell culture incubator overnight) at 4,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20-30°C) to remove any precipitations.Aspirate the virus infection medium in the cells and wash the cells by adding 200 µL of PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer into each well.Gently transfer the neutral red working solution (step a) into a reagent reservoir.",
    "Add 100 µL of neutral red working solution into each well using the 12-channel Electronic Pipette.Incubate the plate in the 37°C incubator (5% CO2) for 2-4 h.Note: For the RD and MRC-5 cell lines, the optimal incubation time is 2 h, and longer incubation times will result in significant loss of sensitivity. For the Vero E6 and A549-hACE2 cell lines, the incubation time can be up to 4 h without affecting assay sensitivity. Aspirate the neutral red working solution.Wash the cells by adding 200 µL of PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer into each well.Aspirate the washing buffer and remove any residual buffer by gently tapping the plate upside down on paper towels or let it air dry.Note: The wells need to be completely dry before addition of neutral red de-staining solution. Add 100 µL of neutral red de-staining solution into each well.Shake the plate rapidly on a microtiter plate shaker at 200 rpm for 15 min to allow the de-staining solution to completely extract the neutral red from the cells and to form a homogeneous solution.Measure the absorbance of neutral red extract at 540 nm in a spectrophotometer, save the data in .text format for analysis. The data in the .text format file will be transferred into Excel for data processing.Discard the de-staining solution into a proper liquid waste container, and discard the plate.CPE assay - Testing inhibitors Cell seeding (Day 0)The whole procedure in this part (steps a-i) is exactly the same as in B. CPE assay - Titrate the virus.Virus infection (Day 1)Check the confluency of the cells in the 96-well plate using a phase-contrast inverted microscope; cells should be 80-90% confluency.Warm the DMEM medium at 37°C in a beads basket and thaw one tube of propagated HCoV virus stored in -80°C freezer.",
    "Prepare dilutions of test compounds (GC-376 and remdesivir) in DMSO by creating eight three-fold dilutions (0.5 log unit), starting from the highest concentration of 1 mM for each compound. The concentrations of the resulting stock solutions are 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001, and 0.0003 mM.Make virus infection medium by adding FBS into DMEM to a final concentration of 2%. For 30 mL of DMEM, add 0.6 mL of FBS.Dilute HCoV stock virus for infecting. To obtain a S/B ratio greater than five, the optimal dilution for HCoV-229E is the 102 -fold dilution (equal to 2 × 103 PFU/mL) of the stock virus, that is 200 µL of HCoV-229E stock virus in 19.8 mL of virus infection medium. The optimal dilution for HCoV-NL63 is the 103 -fold dilution (equal to 7.2 × 103 PFU/mL) of the stock virus, that is 20 µL of HCoV-NL63 stock virus in 19.98 mL of virus infection medium. The optimal dilution for HCoV-OC43 is 102 -fold dilution (equal to 1.38 × 104 PFU/mL) of the stock virus, that is 200 µL HCoV-OC43 stock virus in 19.8 mL virus infection medium.Aspirate the medium in the 96-well plate using the HandE-Vac Handheld Aspirating System and rinse the cells by adding 200 µL of PBS, calcium, and magnesium buffer into each well using a multichannel pipette.

Gently swirl the plate to allow the virus inoculum to evenly cover the cell monolayer.Note: The desired volume of virus inoculum for infecting the cells in a 6-well plate will be 250 µL to 1 mL per well, to allow complete coverage of the cell monolayer and efficient adsorption of viruses. Incubate the infected cells in the 6-well plate in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 1-2 h.During the incubation, prepare overlay containing 0.6% Avicel in DMEM plus 2% FBS by mixing equal volumes of 2× DMEM and 1.2% Avicel. For one 6-well plate, mix 12.5 mL of 2× DMEM and 12.5 mL of 1.2% Avicel with 500 µL of FBS.Aspirate viral inoculum from step h and wash the unbound virus in each well with 3 mL of PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer. Gently swirl the plate to wash the cells thoroughly.Aspirate the PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer.Add 4 mL of overlay from step i into each well in the 6-well plate.Incubate the 6-well plate in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 4-5 days.Note: The optimal incubation time for HCoV-OC43 is about 4 days and 15 h. The optimal incubation time for HCoV-229E is about 5 days and 15 h. The optimal incubation time for HCoV-NL63 is about 3 days and 15 h. However, an incubation time that is 6 h shorter or longer than the optimal time will not significantly affect the results. Plate staining (Day 5)Aspirate the Avicel overlay.",
    "Remove the residual Avicel by washing the cells with 3 mL of PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer each well.Aspirate the PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer.Add 1.5 mL of 0.2% crystal violet into each well, incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Discard the crystal violet into a liquid waste container for biohazard materials, immerse the plate into tap water to remove the extra crystal violet dye.Leave the plate on a bench to allow it to air dry and take an image of the plate.Plaque assay - Test antiviral activity of compounds Cell seeding (Day 0)Steps a-i are exactly the same as in D. Plaque Assay - Titrate the virus, except that seeding cells in five 6-well plates for testing two compounds to determine the EC50s.Virus infection (Day 1)Steps a-b, follow the same procedure as in D. Plaque Assay - Titrate the virus. Prepare virus dilution for infecting. The optimal condition for testing compounds in the plaque assay is to have 80-150 plaques in each well of a 6-well plate. Based on the titration results in Figure 6A, the optimal dilution for HCoV-229E is 800-fold dilution (equal to 250 PFU/mL) of stock virus. That is, for five 6-well plates, add 25 µL of stock virus into 20 mL of virus infection medium, and mix well for infecting. Based on the titration results in Figure 7A, the optimal dilution for HCoV-NL63 is 30,000-fold dilution (equal to 240 PFU/mL) of stock virus. That is, for five 6-well plates, add 6.7 × 10-4 µL of stock virus into 20 mL of virus infection medium, and mix well for infecting. However, it is preferred to serially dilute the HCoV-NL63 stock virus 10-5-fold, and add 67 µL of the 10-5-fold dilution into 20 mL of virus infection medium, and mix well for infecting.",
    "Based on the titration results in Figure 8A, the optimal dilution for HCoV-OC43 is 5,000-fold (equal to 276 PFU/mL) dilution of stock virus. That is, for five 6-well plates, add 4 µL of stock virus into 20 mL of virus infection medium. However, it is preferred to first dilute the HCoV-OC43 stock virus 10-1-fold, and add 40 µL of the 10-1-fold dilution into 20 mL of virus infection medium, to minimize variations.Aspirate the growth medium in the 6-well plate and rinse the cells with 3 mL of PBS, calcium, and magnesium buffer in each well. Gently swirl the plate to wash the cells thoroughly.Aspirate the PBS, calcium, and magnesium buffer.Add 500 µL of diluted virus from step c into each well of the five 6-well plates. Gently swirl the plate to allow the virus inoculum to evenly cover the cell monolayer.Incubate the infected cells in the 6-well plates in the cell culture incubator (humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, 33°C for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, 37°C for HCoV-NL63) for 1-2 h.During the incubation, prepare the overlay solution which consists of 0.6% Avicel in DMEM, 2% FBS, and different concentrations of the test compounds or DMSO (control). For five 6-well plates, mix 65 mL of 2× DMEM and 65 mL of 1.2% Avicel with 2.6 mL of FBS. Aliquot 8.5 mL of the overlay to each tube (for two wells in duplicates), label the name and concentration of the test compound on each tube, and add the corresponding concentration of the compound into the overlay in each tube, vortex the tube to mix the compound, and overlay thoroughly.Aspirate the viral inoculum and wash the unbound virus with 3 mL of PBS, calcium and magnesium buffer. Gently swirl the plate to wash the cells thoroughly.",
