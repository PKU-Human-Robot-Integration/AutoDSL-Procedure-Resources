    "Flow of following procedures is presented in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200425/20200425205640_3384.jpgFigure 2. Flow of procedures Production of HiBiT-containing particlesSeed 293T cells in 6-well plates, at density of ~50,000 cells/well in 2 ml growth medium.Place the plates in a CO2 incubator for 24 h.Mix 0.2 µg pCAG-JEC-HiBiT, 0.4 µg pCMV-JErep-nluc and 0.2 µg pCAG-JEprME in 200 µl Opti-MEM, mix well with a vortex mixer.(Optional) Set control experiments using an empty vector in place of each plasmid.(Optional) Set experiments using plasmids encoding mutant forms of viral elements of interest.Add 2.4 µl PEI solution (1 mg/ml) to the mixture and mix well with a vortex mixer.Incubate the DNA-PEI mixture for 15 min at room temperature.Apply the DNA-PEI mixture to cell-containing wells (~200 μl/well).Place the plates in a CO2 incubator.Replenish growth media 6 h post-transfection.Note: Add media slowly to the side of the well to avoid cell detachment. Replenish growth media 48 h post-transfection.Note: Add media slowly to the side of the well to avoid cell detachment. Transfer the culture supernatant 72 h post-transfection to 2 ml tubes.Centrifuge the tube at 20,000 x g, 4 °C for 10 min.Transfer supernatant to fresh tubes and proceed to Procedure B or Procedure C.Evaluation of replication efficiency of the subgenomic replicon RNA in SRIPs-producer cells (a typical result is presented in Figure 2A)Suspend cells in each well in 1 ml PBS and transfer to a 1.5 ml tube.Centrifuge the tubes at 2,400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant, add 50 μl lysis buffer and mix by pipetting.Centrifuge the tubes at 20,000 x g, 4 °C for 10 min.Transfer 5 μl of the clear lysate in each tube to 384-well plate.Add 5 μl of NanoLuc substrate diluted 1:600 with lysis buffer.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Measure the luminescence using a microplate reader.",
    "Titration of SRIPs in culture supernatant (a typical result is presented in Figure 2C)Seed Huh7 cells in 96-well plates, at density of ~10,000 cells/well and incubate in a CO2 incubator overnight.Inoculate 100 μl of culture supernatant (prepared with Procedure B) into each well.Incubate for 72 h.Aspirate growth media and add 50 μl lysis buffer to each well and mix by pipetting.Transfer 5 μl of the lysate in each well to a 384-well plate.Add 5 µl of NanoLuc substrate diluted 1:600 with lysis buffer.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Measure the luminescence using a microplate reader.Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the culture supernatantLayer 300 μl of the culture supernatant containing HiBiT-labeled particles on continuous 10-45% sucrose gradient/PBS in Open-Top Polyclear centrifuge tubes (SETON, 14 x 95 mm).Centrifuge the gradients at 100,000 x g for 3 h at 4 °C with a pre-chilled swing bucket rotor.Fractionate the gradients from top to bottom (total < 40 fraction), with a piston fractionator (2.3 mm/fraction, 0.3 mm/s) to a 96-well plate.Titration of C-HiBiT-containing particles in sedimentation fractions (a typical result is presented in Figure 2B)Transfer 5 μl of the fraction in each well to 384-well plate.Add 5 μl of HiBiT reagent to each well.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Measure the luminescence using a microplate reader. Typical results out of 3 > experiments are indicated in the figures.Titration of SRIPs in sedimentation fractions (a typical result is presented in Figure 2D)Seed Huh7 cells in 96-well plates, at density of ~10,000 cells/well and incubate in a CO2 incubator overnight.Inoculate 5 μl of sedimentation fractions to each well.Incubate for 72 h.Aspirate growth media and add 50 μl lysis buffer to each well and mix by pipetting.Transfer 5 μl of the lysate in each well to 384-well plate.",
    "Add 5 µl of NanoLuc substrate diluted 600 fold with lysis buffer.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Measure the luminescence using a microplate reader (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200425/20200425205715_6511.jpgFigure 3. Typical results. (A) NanoLuc activity of producer cell lysate to evaluate autonomous replication of the subgenomic RNA (B) HiBiT activities of fractions of producer cell culture supernatant, fractionated via sucrose density gradient centrifugation. (C) NanoLuc activity of target cells inoculated with producer cell supernatant, which reflects the infectious titer of SRIPs in the supernatant. (D) NanoLuc activities of target cells inoculated with sucrose density gradient centrifugation fractions of producer cell supernatant, which reflect the infectious titer of SRIPs in the fractions."
