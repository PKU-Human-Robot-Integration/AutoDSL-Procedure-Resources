    "1. Generation of Drosophila specimens\nSelect a suitable MT plus-end marker. This study utilized GFP-tagged EB1, a well-characterized plus-end marker with a strong, clear signal11,12. Alternatives include other +TIPs such as EB310,13, CLASP/Orbit53, and CLIP-17054.\nObtain or generate flies with the MT marker under control of a UAS promoter (e.g., UAS-EB1-GFP).\nChoose the appropriate tissue-specific Gal4-driver. This study used the pan-neuronal driver elaV-Gal458,59 to drive expression in both sensory dendrites and at the NMJ and 221-Gal460,61 for dendrite-specific expression.\nRaise flies using standard fly husbandry techniques55,56. It is recommended that flies be kept in humidified incubators at 25 °C for optimal Gal4/UAS expression.\nUsing standard fly genetic techniques55,56, perform crosses to generate flies to express the MT plus-end marker in the desired cells/tissues.\n\tNOTE: For any Gal4-driver and -transgene combination, the experimental design should include proof-of-concept and validation experiments to characterize the system and avoid artifacts from overexpression.\n2. Equipment setup\nSet up a workstation, including the flies, anesthetic reagents, slide construction materials, stereomicroscope, and illumination source, close to the confocal microscope (i.e., in the same room) to minimize the time spent between sample preparation and imaging to prolong the health and viability of the larvae.\nPrepare the anesthetic by mixing a 9% chloroform mixture (0.1 mL of chloroform and 1.0 mL of halocarbon oil) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. To avoid separation, mix well by inverting the tube prior to preparing each new slide.\nPrepare the glass slide: Cut four strips of double-sided tape (~15 mm wide). Line up two of the pieces on the glass slide, leaving a space of ~5 mm in between the strips. Layer the remaining two pieces on top of the first two to double the thickness of the tape (Figure 1C).",
    "Add a large drop (~100 µL) of chloroform/oil mixture onto the glass slide in the 5 mm space between the tape pieces (Figure 1C).\n3. Preparation of larval samples for imaging\nFill a container (e.g., a 6 well plate) with 1x PBS.\nCollect 3rd instar larvae from the fly vial using forceps or a similar instrument. Identify larvae at the proper stage by their crawling behavior and by the presence of 9–12 prominent, serrated mouth hooks. Use a stereomicroscope to assist in staging larvae (Figure 1D).\nPlace a larva in the PBS and move it gently to wash off any remains of food or other debris. Dry the larva gently on a delicate tissue.\nAnesthetize the larva by placing it into chloroform/oil drop on the slide from section 2 (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: The dorsal/ventral orientation of the larva is not critical because both sensory and motor neurons can be detected through the translucent cuticle by setting the microscope stage to the proper focal plane, regardless of the orientation of the specimen.\nPlace a #1.5 coverslip on top. Adhere the coverslip to the tape by applying gentle pressure, thus immobilizing the larva without damaging it (Figure 1C).\nSeal the chamber with petroleum jelly or nail polish.\n4. Time-lapse confocal imaging of live samples\nPrepare confocal microscope and the 60x objective lens with oil immersion. Place the sample on the stage (Figure 1A,B).\nUse the acquisition software to configure experiments.\n\tNOTE: For this study, each imaging series was acquired at a single focal plane as opposed to a z-stack.\n\t\nSet the time-lapse duration to 30 s at an interval of 2 s, for a total of 16 frames.\nSet laser exposure and intensity to ensure sufficient signal while avoiding saturation and photobleaching.",
    "For EB1-GFP imaging, the 488 nm laser was set to an exposure time of 100 ms and intensity of 30%. These values may vary for different uses of this protocol and should be modified empirically.\nUse the eyepieces of the microscope to find the larva in widefield-green illumination. Find the dendrites or NMJs by adjusting the stage slowly. Do not expose larva to illumination (widefield or confocal) for longer than necessary.\n\t\nDendrites appear as thin bright-green webs of nerves easily distinguishable from thick long axon bundles (Figure 1E).\nNMJs appear as groups of bright-green individual boutons, approximately 5 µm in diameter, at the ends of thick long axon bundles that diverge from the nerve cord (Figure 1F).\nUsing the live camera feed, quickly focus on the region of interest using 488 nm illumination. Immediately stop illumination once the proper focus is found to avoid phototoxicity.\nInitiate image acquisition. EB1 comets are recognizable as bright, motile punctae.\nRefer to previously published protocols for additional details and guidelines on fluorescence live imaging57.\n5. Software-based image processing and analysis\nAnalyze each video file individually. Within software (user interface shown in Figure 2), select File | Import | Image Sequence and drag TIF files in the box that appears. Preview the video.\nUnder the Detection Parameters menu, tune the software parameters to ensure detection of only clearly visible punctae and avoid detection of spurious objects. For instance, reducing particle intensity results in greater sensitivity of software to punctae but increases potential false positives. The precise values of the parameters will vary empirically. Descriptions of the Detection and Tracking Parameters are available from the authors upon request.",
    "Apply the Neuron Particle Tracking recipe to analyze the image using the From beginning button (blue arrow, Figure 2B). The software will output results for the tracking parameters listed in Table 1 to the Results Spreadsheet (green box, Figure 2B). For ease of later analysis and interpretation, the results can be stored in spreadsheet software using the Export function found in the Results Spreadsheet section.\nNavigate the cursor to puncta detected in the previous step and left-click to select or deselect. Multiple puncta can be selected simultaneously using Ctrl + left-click.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the project aims and applications, additional heuristics may be used to filter the punctae. For instance, punctae with a lifetime of fewer than 8–10 s (4–5 frames) might be omitted because they do not present sufficient information about the entire growth event. The need for such heuristics will vary empirically. Additional details on software functionality are available from the authors upon request.\nSubscription Required.
