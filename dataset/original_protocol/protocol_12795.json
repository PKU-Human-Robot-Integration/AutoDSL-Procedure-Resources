    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all the materials and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Cell culture\nNOTE: All cell culture should be done in a sterile laminar flow hood.\nTo follow this protocol, first thaw a vial of frozen cells in a 37 °C water bath. Here, we use a genetically modified HCT116 cell line that lacks the three known detyrosinating enzymes, VASH1, VASH2, and MATCAP, to create tyrosinated tubulin.\nPrepare a Ø 10 cm plate containing 10 mL of the appropriate cell culture medium.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) supplemented with 10% v/v FCS (fetal calf serum) and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic (culture medium) was used for the genetically modified HCT116 cell line.\nCount the cells, and seed ~2.5 × 106 viable cells (~20% confluence) in the prepared 10 cm plate. Shake the plate gently to evenly distribute the cells. Incubate the dish in a 37 °C cell-culture incubator gassed with 5% (v/v) CO2 until the cells reach 80%-90% confluence.\n\tNOTE: Typically, this takes 3 days for HCT116 cells, but the time could depend on the specific seeding density and cell line used.\nDiscard the cell culture medium using a pipette or vacuum aspirator and wash the dish 2 x 5 mL of PBS.\n\t​NOTE: Take care not to dispense the PBS too forcefully onto the cell monolayer as this could detach the cells from the plate.\nAdd 1-2 mL of trypsin, and incubate the cells in the incubator for 2-5 min to detach the cells.\nAdd 2 mL of the culture medium to the plate to quench the trypsin.\nSplit the cell suspension into three to five equal parts and reseed them to expand the cells in culture medium until 6-12 confluent 15 cm plates are obtained.\n2. Harvesting",
    "Wash the cells gently with 10 mL of PBS (1x) to remove any cell culture medium.\nDetach the cells from the plates by incubating the cells for 5 min at room temperature with 3 mL of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA (sterile/filtered) and, subsequently, using a cell scraper.\nCollect the cells in a 50 mL tube on ice, and spin down (10 min, 250 × g).\n\t\nNote the volume of the harvested cells with the volumetric scale on the 50 mL tube.\n\t\t​NOTE: The expected volume can be anywhere between ~0.5 mL and 4 mL. PAUSE STEP: Flash-freeze the cell pellet in LN2, and store at −20 °C until use. Note that the cell pellet can be stored only for a few weeks or months. If the pellet is kept longer, then it could result in a decreased yield or no microtubules at all.\n3. Microtubule extraction\nNOTE: Keep everything for steps 3.1-3.5 on ice; everything from step 3.6 onward should be kept warm (30-37 °C).\nPrepare 10 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mM PIPES/KOH (pH 6.9), 2 mM EGTA/KOH, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, and one protease inhibitor tablet (mini).\nResuspend the harvested cell pellet in 1:1 v/v lysis buffer (if in doubt about the exact volume, take less lysis buffer rather than more).\nLyse the cells by sonication: 15 s on, 45 s off, amp 30, four cycles (determine the conditions experimentally, and change according to the sonicator).\n\t\nAfter sonication, collect a sample for SDS-PAGE analysis: 2 µL of lysate + 18 µL of water + 5 µL of 5x SDS sample buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Check under a standard light microscope if the cells have indeed fully lysed.",
    "Pipette the lysed cells into a centrifugal tube. Spin for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge rotor to clear the lysate.\n\tNOTE: Make sure all pockets in the rotor are dry and clean to ensure the correct balancing of the centrifuge.\nUse a syringe to take the cleared lysate out. Take care to not disturb the pellet as well as the floating layer on top.\n\t\nCollect a sample of the cleared lysate: 2 µL of lysate + 18 µL of water + 5 µL of 5x SDS sample buffer.\nCarefully rinse the pellet, and scoop up a little bit of the pellet by swirling a P10 pipette tip through the pellet; add 200 µL of water and 50 µL of SDS buffer.\nSupplement the supernatant from the previous step with 1 mM GTP and 20 µM paclitaxel to polymerize the microtubules; for a volume of 1 mL, add 10 µL of 2 mM paclitaxel and 10 µL of 100 mM GTP.\n\tCAUTION: Paclitaxel may cause skin irritation, serious eye damage, respiratory irritation, genetic defects, damage to an unborn child, and damage to organs. Prolonged or repeated exposure causes damage to organs. Do not breathe, spray, or dust the substance in any way. Wear rubber nitrile gloves to prevent skin contact.\nIncubate the GTP/paclitaxel-supplemented supernatant for 30 min at 37 °C to allow the microtubules to assemble.\nDuring this incubation step, allow the rotor and the ultracentrifuge to warm up to 30 °C.\nPrepare the cushion buffer: Add 0.6 mL of glycerol to 0.4 mL of lysis buffer, and supplement the mixture with 20 µM paclitaxel. Prewarm the cushion buffer to 37 °C.\nAdd 800 µL of cushion buffer to an ultracentrifuge tube. Pipette the GTP/paclitaxel-supplemented lysate carefully on top of the cushion buffer.",
    "NOTE: Prevent the mixing of the cushion buffer and the lysate by pipetting very gently.\nSpin for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 30 °C in an ultracentrifuge rotor. Mark the outward-facing edge of the centrifugation tube to easily recognize where the microtubule pellet should form.\nRemove the cushion buffer carefully using a pipette, taking care not to disturb the microtubule pellet.\n\t\nCollect a sample of the cushion buffer: 2 µL + 18 µL of water + 5 µL of 5x SDS sample buffer.\nWash the pellet carefully 3x with warm lysis buffer to remove the glycerol. Gently dispense the warm buffer next to the pellet (not flushing the liquid directly over the pellet), rotate the tube a few times to remove as much glycerol as possible from the pellet and the walls of the tube, and then aspirate and repeat.\n\tNOTE: If the glycerol is not washed off properly, the grid will melt very quickly under the electron illumination. This might be evidenced by high particle movement, creating blurry images.\nPrepare resuspension buffer with the following ingredients: 100 mM PIPES/KOH (pH 6.9), 2 mM EGTA/KOH, and 1 mM MgCl2, and warm the buffer to 37 °C.\nResuspend the washed pellet gently with a cut tip in ~50 µL of prewarmed resuspension buffer, and keep the tube at 37 °C.\n\t\nCollect a sample of the resuspended pellet fraction: 2 µL + 18 µL of water + 5 µL of 5x SDS sample buffer.\n\t\t​TIP: The cut tip prevents the breaking of the microtubules. Prepare a metal heating block to 37 °C, and keep this in a polystyrene box so that the sample tubes can be transported easily without cooling them down to room temperature.\n4. Cryo-EM grid preparation",
    "Prepare the plunge freezer device by installing the blotting paper. Warm the plunge freezer up to 30 °C, and set the humidification to 100%. Allow ~30 min to equilibrate the temperature and humidity.\nPrepare the settings of the plunge freezer to two applications, and run through the whole program once to be sure the settings are set properly. Ensure that the first application has a force of 10, 2 s blot time, and 0 s wait time and that the second application has a force of 10, 6.5 s blot time, and 10 s wait time.\nGlow-discharge the cryo-EM grids at 30 mA for 60 s.\nCool the polystyrene container assembly down with LN2, and prepare liquid ethane in a metal cup by condensing ethane gas into a cold metal cup.\nPrepare a dilution buffer with the following components: 100 mM PIPES/KOH (pH 6.9), 2 mM EGTA/KOH, and 1 mM MgCl2, and warm it to 37 °C.\nDilute the microtubule-interacting protein 1:1 v/v with dilution buffer just before applying it to the grids to ensure the salt concentration is lowered (we used a final salt concentration of 50 mM NaCl). Keep the mixture at 37 °C.\nGrab a glow-discharged grid with plunge-tweezers and click them into the plunge freezer.\nPosition the polystyrene container with liquid ethane in the plunge freezer, and run through the prepared program: first apply 3.5 µL of microtubule solution to the grid, let the plunge freezer blot the grid, then immediately apply 3.5 µL of freshly diluted protein, and lastly, let the plunger blot and plunge-freeze the grid in liquid ethane.\nTransfer the grids into a grid storage box, and store them in an LN2 dewar until imaging."
