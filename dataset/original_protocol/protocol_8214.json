    "The present study was performed under approval of the Research and Ethics Committee of the Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile (assessment statement code CEC170-18), confirmed to the national guidelines for research with human subjects.\n1. Preparation\nWelcome the subject.\nExplain the aims and relevance of the study. Provide a description of relevant technical details. Answer all questions thoroughly.\nExplicitly mention that she/he can interrupt the experimental session at any time if desired.\nAsk the volunteer to read the Subject Informed Consent and sign the corresponding form. Interrupt the experimental session if the informed consent is not obtained.\n2. Subject preparation\nAsk the subject to sit in a laboratory chair in a comfortable position.\n\t\nClean the scalp with ethanol (a solution at 95%) to remove the layer of dead skin cells and sebum that cover it. This step is important to reduce impedance between the electrodes and scalp.\nMeasure the head circumference with a measuring tape to define the size of the electrode cap to be used.\n\t\nAsk the subject to wear the electrode cap. Provide the instructions for comfortable but correct positioning of the cap.\nMeasure the distance between the nasion (Nz, the middle point of the nasofrontal suture, which can be identified by the depression between the eyes and the top of the nose) and the inion (Iz, the prominence of the occipital bone) using a measuring tape.\nMeasure the distance between the left and right pre-auricular points (identified as the depression just before the auricle of the ears) using a measuring tape.\nCorrect the position of the electrode cap, so the intersection between the imaginary lines defined in the previous steps correspond to the vertex of the head. Make sure the subject is comfortable after the adjustments.",
    "Put conductive gel in the electrode holders, according to the locations considered for the experiment.\n\t\nUse 64 scalp locations following the International 10-20 system31 to use the outcome of the protocol to perform source localization analysis. The higher number of the electrode locations (128) on the scalp can be used if needed.\nImplement clinical or ambulatory settings (with only a few electrodes) if source localization analysis is not planned. Use occipital locations to record SSVEP, temporal locations to acquire ASSR, and parietal locations to record SSSEP.\nPush the electrodes in the electrode holders. Make sure that the label of the electrode matches the label of location in the cap.\nAccompany the volunteer to the experimental room (preferably, a shielded, sound-attenuated chamber). Ask the subject to sit in a chair inside the room, in a comfortable position.\nPlace external electrodes on the nose and earlobes if a physical reference (different from the scalp electrodes) will be used for re-reference the EEG recording (in step 3.8.1).\nPlace external electrodes in periocular locations.\n\t\nPlace electrodes on the cheek and the frontal region of the head, approximately 1 cm above the eyebrow, to record blinking (in step 2.6.1).\nPlace electrodes on the outer canthus of the eyes, approximately 1 cm above/below the midline, to record eye movements (in step 2.6.1).\n\t\tNOTE: The electrooculogram (EOG) will be used in the step 3.8.5 for removing EGG artifacts induced by blinking and eye movements.\nTurn the EEG acquisition system on and check the electrode impedance if a low-impedance system is used for recording the EEG. Correct the impedance, as needed, as per the manufacturer's directions. Impedance should be kept below 10 kΩ32.\nAsk the subject to blink and move the eyes in different directions to ensure that EOG is being correctly recorded.",
    "To analyze the dynamic of SSVEP, adjust the location of the screen in the vertical direction, to match the view angle of the subject. Dim the lights of the room until a comfortable level is achieved. Adjust the luminance level of the screen to the upper limit of the participant´s comfort level.\n\t\nTo analyze the dynamics of ASSR, insert the earphones using the correct foam inserts, so the earphones fit the ear canal. Check that sounds are delivered at the desired intensity (e.g., a psychophysical comfortable level33).\n3. EEG acquisition and pre-processing\nSet the stimulus parameters defined in the experimental design. Refer to the user manual provided by the manufacturer of the stimulation system for details about the software.\n\tNOTE: For comprehensive explanations of the stimulus used for generation of SSVEP and ASSR, see Norcia et al.8 and Rance34, respectively.\nInstruct the subject to pay attention to the stimulation, in the case that visual entrainment is the topic of the experiment.\n\t\nPresent a subtitled movie with the sound off when auditory entrainment is the topic of the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Presentation of a silent movie allows deflection of attention from the acoustic stimulation while maintaining arousal level25.\nPresent stimuli longer than 90 s, as have been done to investigate the time evolution of SSVEPs and ASSR in both humans and animal models21,22,25,26.\n\tNOTE: Present stimuli shorter in duration if a pilot study has been performed.\nPause the stimulation for 2 min if only one experimental condition is being tested. Interact with the subject to check awareness.\n\tNOTE: The duration of the pause depends on the duration of the stimulation. Pauses 3x longer than the stimulation intervals will ensure that a response elicited by one stimulus is not affected by the previous stimulation. Longer pauses are permitted if the subject so requests.",
    "Pause the stimulation for at least 10 s when different experimental conditions are tested since alternating stimulation with pauses of 10 s has been proposed to decrease extra adaptation effects and reduce the length of the experiment25.\nRepeat the presentation steps (steps 3.3-3.4) at least 30x to ensure the high SNR of the measurements after the averaging of epochs (step 4.4).\nRecord the EEG using standard procedures35. Create a separate EEG file for each experimental run.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the user manual of the acquisition system for details about the software.\nMonitor the EEG recording to detect sleep periods based on the level of alpha activity and the frequency at which blinking artifacts appear. Pause the experiment when increased alpha levels accompanied by decreased blinking frequencies are detected, which is indicative of sleepiness. Reject the experimental run from further analysis when sleep periods are detected.\n\t\nCompute the amplitude of the steady-state response at the end of each experimental run, following the instruction provided in the user manual of the acquisition software used in the experiment.\nMonitor the attentional level of the subject by comparing the amplitude of steady-state responses obtained at the end of each experimental run. Set the steady-state amplitude obtained in the first experimental runs as a reference amplitude.\nSet a rejection threshold (a decrease in the response amplitude of 5% regarding the reference amplitude). Reject the experimental runs in which the amplitude of the steady-state response meets the rejection criterium.\nFinish the experimental session after acquiring the number of runs defined in the experimental design.\nPre-process the EEG data offline using standard EEG procedures35 described in the next steps per the manufacturer's directions.",
    "Re-reference the recording using an average reference (average of all recording electrodes) or the average of a subset of electrodes. Alternatively, use a physical reference (e.g., external electrodes placed on the nose and earlobes described in step 2.4).\nConvert the electrode coordinates to the international 10/20 system if the radial coordinate system was used during the EEG acquisitions. Refer to the manufacturer manual for details on conversion.\nBand-pass filter the EEG signal between 0.5-300 Hz. Set a notch-filter (centered at 50 Hz or 60 Hz) if necessary.\nDown-sample the EEG signal to decrease the execution time of the algorithm selected for removing ocular artifacts (step 3.8.5).\n\t\tNOTE: A sampling frequency of 512 Hz is adequate to analyze brain oscillations of frequency below 40 Hz35.\nRemove the ocular artifacts.\n\t\tNOTE: To this end, different techniques can be used (see Urigüen and Garcia-Zapirain35 for an extensive review on artifact removal algorithms). Among them, independent component analysis is one of the most extended methodologies and is implemented in both commercial and free analysis softwares37,38,39.\nSegment the EEG data in epochs time-locked to stimulation. Select the epochs length according to the aim of the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Epochs should be sufficiently long to allow for analysis of the steady-state response in the frequency-domain with an adequate spectral resolution.\nDo not run artifact rejection algorithms at this stage to detect and remove epochs containing artifacts.\n\t\tNOTE: Removing epoch at this stage will induce errors when the dataset is organized to run the column-wise averaging of epochs (steps 4.2 and 4.4). Rejection algorithms are implemented at a later processing step (step 4.1.4).\nRun the DC-detrend function to calculate DC-trends in individual EEG epochs and correct them.\nRun the baseline correction function to correct the baseline of the recording. Select pre-stimulus time intervals longer than 200 ms.",
    "NOTE: Baseline correction consists of averaging the data in the selected time interval. The average is calculated for each channel and subtracted from each data point in every epoch.\n4. Computation of the response amplitudes\nEnter the parameters needed for the computation of the steady-state responses (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: The in-house code used for processing the data is freely available at <https://figshare.com/ projects/Steady-state_visually_evoked_potentials_SSVEP_elicited_in_humans_by_continuos_light_modulated_in_amplitude_at_10Hz/62573>. Refer to the help text inside the code for further instructions. Similarly, a subset of the data used in this study is available.\n\t\nEnter the number of recordings (experimental runs) of the experiment.\nEnter the length of the epochs to segment the individual recordings.\nEnter the sampling frequency of the experiment.\nSelect artifact rejection algorithms to detect and remove epochs containing artifacts. The available selection criteria are 1) gradient (absolute difference between two consecutive samples), 2) max-min (the difference between the maximum and minimum amplitude in the epoch), and 3) amplitude (absolute maximum and minimum amplitudes).\nRun the processing code.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 4.2-4.7 are automatically performed when this option is selected. Run the steps manually if appropriate.\nRe-arrange the epochs into a data matrix of n rows and m columns, in which n represents the number of recordings (experimental runs) and m the number of epochs (Figure 1B).\nWeight the epoch to attenuate the effect of motion and muscular artifacts.\n\tNOTE: Weighted EEG epochs are obtained by dividing each voltage sample by the amplitude variance of the epoch they belong to, so that variance is used as a measure of amplitude variability and weighting factor40.\nColumn-wise average the dataset. To this end, time-domain average the epochs corresponding to the same time window in the different recordings.\n\tNOTE: This step allows the computation of the steady-state amplitude in recordings with a remarkably high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",
    "Export the time series resulting from the averaging for further analysis of the time evolution of the entrainment in external software.\n\t\nCompute the amplitude of the steady-state response in each epoch resulting from the column-wise averaging, using the fast Fourier transform (FFT).\n\t\tNOTE: The FFT length should correspond to the length of one epoch. The implementation of a windowing technique is not mandatory. The amplitude of the steady-state response is defined as the spectral amplitude obtained at the frequency of the amplitude modulation of the sensory stimuli.\nVector average the amplitude of an ad-hoc number of FFT bins at each side of the frequency of the response to calculate the residual noise level (RNL). The number of FFT bins should correspond with a frequency band of about 3 Hz, at each side of the frequency of the response.\n\tNOTE: The high frequency-specificity of the steady-state responses makes the response amplitude independent of those background oscillations with similar frequencies, which in turn distributes uniformly in a relatively narrow frequency band41,42,43.\nPlot the amplitude of the steady-state response and the RNL as a function of column index (i.e., the number of the acquired epoch) to explore the evolution of the steady-state response during the stimulation interval."
