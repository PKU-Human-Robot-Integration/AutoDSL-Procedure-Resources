    "1. Buffer and Equipment Preparations\nChill 45 mL cell disruption bombs, 15 mL tubes, and ultracentrifugation tubes at 4 °C.\nPrepare and chill 25 mL of homogenization buffer per 2 x 107 cells at 4 °C. Add one protease inhibitor tablet just before use.\n\tNOTE: Homogenization buffers typically contain KCl rather than NaCl to better reflect intracellular salt composition. Homogenization buffer used in this protocol consists of 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2 (hereinafter referred to as hypotonic homogenization buffer). Most buffers can be adapted for nitrogen cavitation (see Discussion).\nPrepare and chill 6 mL of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) buffer per sample at 4 °C. Add protease inhibitor tablets fresh before use.\n\tNOTE: PBS buffer used in this protocol consists of 10 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl.\nPrepare and chill 4 mL of solubilization buffer per sample at 4 °C. Add one protease inhibitor tablet just before use.\n\tNOTE: Solubilization buffer used in this protocol is 1x Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, which consists of 25 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% NP-40. See 4.6 NOTE.\n2. Cell Harvesting\nGrow 2 x 107-10 x109 tissue culture cells with the recommended culture media for the cell type. Typically, one 15-cm dish yields 2 x 107 HEK-293 cells cultured in DMEM at 90% confluency (Figure 1).\nRemove the growth medium by vacuum.",
    "For adherent cells, place the culture dishes on ice, wash the cells directly on the culture dishes gently with chilled homogenization buffer twice (10 mL buffer per 15 cm dish per wash) and harvest the cells with a large cell scraper in an appropriate volume of homogenization buffer; For suspension cells, collect and wash the cell pellet in chilled homogenization buffer twice (10 mL buffer per 50-mL culture per wash) with 500 x g spin at 4 °C for 5 min, and resuspend the washed cell pellet in an appropriate volume of homogenization buffer on ice.\n\tNOTE: The volume should be based on the requirements for protein concentration in the intended experiments as well as the minimal/maximal volume allowed in the cell disruption bomb. A general guideline is 2-10 x 107 cells/mL, or about 10 volumes of the cell pellet. This protocol is optimized for three 15-cm dishes of HEK-293 cells in 2 mL of homogenization buffer.\n3. Nitrogen Cavitation\nTransfer the cell suspension to a clean and chilled bomb in an ice bath on a stir plate.\n\tCAUTION: The bomb has high pressure, low temperature, nitrogen gas – wear appropriate personal protection.\nPlace a micro magnetic stir bar inside the bomb and turn on the stir plate to maintain suspension homogeneity.\nAdd one protease inhibitor tablet to the suspension and close the bomb per manufacturer's instruction.\nGradually pressurize the bomb with a nitrogen gas tank per manufacturer's instruction till the bomb pressure gauge reads 300 to 600 psi. Close all valves and disconnect the nitrogen tank.\n\tNOTE: The pressure required may vary with the cell type. Here we performed cavitation at 350 to 400 psi for HEK-293, NIH-3T3 and Jurkat cells.\nWait for 20 min to allow the nitrogen to dissolve and reach equilibrium within the cells.",
    "Remove excess water around the discharge valve using a cloth towel. Open the discharge valve gently to achieve a dropwise release of homogenate and collect in a pre-chilled 15 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Near the end of collection there will be a spurt of homogenate and gas will emerge with a hissing sound. Make sure that the gas does not cause previously collected cavitate to shoot out of the tube (hence the use of 15 mL tubes instead of 1.5 mL tubes). Once the spurt starts, close the discharge valve and open the nitrogen inlet valve abruptly to depressurize the bomb and achieve cavitation of the remaining cells in the bomb. Open the bomb for cavitate recovery and thorough cleaning.\n\tNOTE: The final cavitate should have a milky appearance with foam on top. Gently stir with a pipette tip to allow the foam to subside before centrifugation.\n\tNOTE: Examine the cavitate by phase-contrast microscopy to determine the homogenization efficiency. Add a 15 µL drop of cavitate to the surface of a microscopy slide and cover with a coverslip. Repeat step 3.4-3.6 only if too many unbroken cells are detected with a 20X objective.\n\tNOTE: If homogenization buffer does not contain EDTA or EGTA, add it to the collected cavitate at a final concentration of 1 mM within 5 min after discharge.\n4. Separation of Cytosolic and Membrane Fractions\nCentrifuge the cavitate at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei.\n\tNOTE: Repeat the centrifugation step until no visible pellet is produced and collect the Post Nuclear Supernatant (PNS) while avoiding the foam floating on top. Re-centrifuge the foam to further collect and combine PNS, if necessary (Figure 1).",
    "Process the PNS as desired to obtain fractions of interest. For the purpose of separating cytosolic and membrane fractions, transfer the PNS to an ultracentrifuge tube and perform ultracentrifugation as desired. This protocol is optimized for a <3.5 mL sample in a polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube and for ultracentrifugation at 350,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant (the S fraction) using a 1 mL pipette.\nCarefully rinse the pellet with 3 mL of cold PBS without disturbing it. Remove the PBS by vacuum.\n\tNOTE: If contamination of the membrane fraction by cytosolic proteins is a greater concern than the loss of sample, resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of cold PBS and re-ultracentrifuge as in step 4.2. Remove the PBS by vacuum.\nResuspend the pellet fully in an appropriate volume of detergent-containing solubilization buffer of choice. To achieve cell equivalence, use the same volume of solubilization buffer as the cytosolic fraction.\n\tNOTE: We suggest using 1x RIPA buffer as solubilization buffer for efficient membrane protein extraction. If no downstream assay is required for membrane fraction, use 1x laemmli sample buffer for maximal membrane protein extraction.\n\tNOTE: We suggest dislodging and transferring the pellet in solubilization buffer to a clean tube on a tube rotator at 4 °C for maximal membrane protein extraction.\n\tNOTE: If the pellet is too sticky (too many lipids) to be efficiently removed from the ultracentrifuge tube in solubilization buffer, we suggest snap freezing the pellet in liquid nitrogen and quickly dislodging the pellet from the ultracentrifuge tube with a mini metal spatula before the pellet thaws.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, membrane pellets can be just resuspended and not solubilized in a non-detergent-containing buffer to produce a P fraction of membrane vesicle suspension, in which case the centrifugation step in 4.6 is not required. Such P fractions are useful when investigating functions such as enzyme activities that are dependent on membrane association.\nCentrifuge the fully solubilized pellet suspension from step 4.5 at 20,000 x g in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant using a 1 mL pipette (the P fraction) and discard the pellet (insoluble lipids).\nPerform desired assays such as western blotting with the cytosolic and/or membrane fractions, or save them at -80 °C for future use.\nSubscription Required.
