  "procedures": [
    "Here the use of the OPAD (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) is described in general terms for an example experiment using capsaicin. The operator has the freedom to program numerous experiments with many options and pain models though. For instance, the administration of analgesics reduce nociceptive measures 6,3,4,5,7 and other pain models like chronic constriction injury produce and inflammation increased nociceptive behaviors 3,9. These models are easily adaptable to the following protocol.\nFor all experiments, maleSprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g, Charles River, Raleigh, NC) were used. These were housed in pairs in 22 °C temperature and 31% humidity controlled rooms with a normal 12-hr light/dark cycles (6am-6pm lights on) and had free access to food and water except when fasted. Behavioral sessions were performed during the light phase. These facilities were AAALAC accredited and all procedures were approved by the University of Florida IACUC.\n1.Training and Baseline Sessions\nFood fast rodents the night before each OPAD session (ex. 15+/- 1 hr for this experiment).\nRodents must first be trained until consistent behavior at non-aversive temperatures (ex. 33-37 °C) is observed. Generally, about six sessions (three times a week for two weeks) is sufficient to train mice or rats to lick about 600-1,000 or 2,000 times per session, respectively.\n2. Pretest Preparation and Capsaicin Treatment\nHairless rodents are best for all operant procedures, if this is not possible, rodents must have their facial hair (buccal hair only and not vibrissae pad/whiskers as this has an effect on a rodent's navigation) removed 1-2 days before testing for accurate recording of the behavior.",
    "Buccal hair acts as a temperature insulator and makes heat and cold less nociceptive. To remove hair, anesthetize rats, add eye ointment, shave cheek hair with clippers, apply hair removal cream, wait 2-4 min, then wash with water. See Neubert et al. 3 for full methodology.\nOn the day of testing, anesthetize the animal (ex. 1-2.5% isoflurane inhalation) and place opthalamic vet ointment on both eyes to prevent them from drying out and to keep any topical drug treatments from getting in the eye.\nApply capsaicin cream (0.1%) bilaterally on the exposed cheeks with a sterile cotton swab. Wait 5 min. Wipe off cream with gauze pads soaked in warm water (at about 40 °C). Wipe cheeks off with an alcohol swab and set a timer for 30 min.\nAllow the rodent sufficient time to recover from anesthesia before returning it to the cage. Wait until it can raise its head in a sternal posture in order to prevent the aspiration of cage bedding.\n3. Programming the OPAD System for Protocols and Experiments\nThe key innovation of the OPAD system to behavioral testing is the OroFacial software, an ANY-maze (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) driven system that allows the user to program and create new experiments.\nA general example of how to program a simple experiment is provided below, but many more options for temperature ramping protocols and pain models other than capsaicin are available.\nExperiments can be designed and saved at any point. Turn on OPADs and open software. Turn on white noise to control for ambient noise. Under \"File\" select New Experiment. Under the subheading \"Protocol\" name the protocol and select whether to be blinded.",
    "Under \"OPAD cages\" select \"New OPAD cage\" then \"Add all connected OPAD cages.\" Under \"Outputs\" select \"Temperature Controllers\" then \"Thermal element\". Adjust starting temperature (for example, a neutral 33-37 °C).\nIf needed, adjust ramping temperatures under \"OPAD temperature cycle.\" In order to change the temperature from neutral to hot to cold make adjustments here.\nFor \"1\", \"Set temperature to (°C)\" = 45, \"Ramp duration\" = 30 sec, and \"Remain at value for\" = 3 min. For \"2\", 33, 30 sec, and 3 min. For \"3\", 7, 60 sec, and 3 min. For \"4\", 33, 60 sec, and 3 min. Check the box for \"After the following period of time:\" and select 3 min.\nUnder \"Fields\" add any extra notes about the subjects. For example, make an area for animal ID by selecting \"New Field\" and change the name to \"Animal ID.\" Then choose \"Animals\", \"Text\", and \"Use this field as the animal ID.\"\nUnder \"Stage\", the OPAD will automatically set a \"First stage.\" Set duration of test period and name the stage if needed. For this ramping session, set this to 18 min.\nA note on stages: for most experiments, behavioral sessions shouldn't last for longer than 10-20 min. After that, rodents are satiated. For experiments over several days, additional stages can be added for each day to make the data analysis simpler.\nUnder \"Calculations\" select \"New Calculation\" and name it \"L/F\" for lick/face ratio. In the section labeled \"Enter the calculation in the area below\" adjust to say \"Lick : number of activations / Contact : number of activations\".",
    "To create time periods for a simpler data analysis select \"Analysis\" and \"New time period\". Name one \"33 °C\" and select the box for \"This period is the same in all stages\" For \"Starts at:\" write 0 and for \"Ends at:\" put 3 min.\nRepeat the above step for each time period. Name: \"Ramp 33-45 °C.\" Starts at: 3 min. Ends at: 3.5 min. \"45 °C\", 3.5 min, 6.5 min. \"Ramp 45-33 °C\", 6.5 min, 7 min. \"33 °C\", 7 min, 10 min. \"Ramp 33-7 °C\", 10 min, 11 min. \"7 °C\", 11 min, 14 min. \"Ramp 7-33 °C\", 14 min, 15 min. \"33 °C\", 15 min, 18 min.\nSave and name the protocol. Note: saved protocols can be re-used in new experiments.\n4. Running the Assay\nPrepare a room temperature reward mixture and place in OPAD bottles. A 2:1 ratio of water:sweetened condensed milk works well although sucrose or saccharin solutions may also be used.\nPlace liquid catch tray, Plexiglas cage, and metal flooring grate on the OPAD machine. Attach wiring to cage.\nPlace reward bottle on stand and adjust so the spout can be reached by the rodent. Initially, the bottle can be placed further back in the cage then withdrawn to produce better facial contacts.\nLoad the experiment into the OPAD software. Add the number of animals to be tested. Under the subheading \"Experiment\" add a \"Title\" and then add the treatment groups (capsaicin and control). Add the number of animals in each group.\nUnder the subheading \"Tests\", select \"Animal treatments and data\". Add the letter of the treatment (A, B, C, etc.) and the animal ID. The boxes should now have the designated animal ID on their screens.",
    "Press the button on the OPAD box. This will adjust the thermodes to the right temperature. When the light goes orange, place the rodent inside and press the button again. For this experiment, rats will be started 30 min after the capsaicin cream was wiped off.\nThe green light will turn on. Adjust the distance the bottle is from the box so the rat must make contact with the thermodes on its buccal, not vibrissa, region to be able to lick. Proper adjustment will result in a solid red box for licking above an outlined orange box for contacts.\nProper placement of the reward bottle is vital for the assay. If the bottle is too close the rat will either lick without making a contact or to touch its nose to the reward bottle so that many licks will appear as only one (denoted by an outlined red box for licks instead of a solid box).\nOnce the testing session is over the OPAD will alert the experimenter with a tone. Return the rodent to its cage. If another rodent is to be tested afterward the box will indicate its Animal ID. Repeat steps 4.5-4.7 as needed until the experiment is complete.\n5. Analyzing, Graphing, and Statistical Analysis of Data with OPAD Software\nUnder the subheading \"Results\" select whether to see a text, graph, or statistical analysis report.\nIn the \"Graph report settings\" box, select which variable to examine. For instance, under \"Calculation results\" check the \"L/F\" box.\nSpecify \"On the x-axis show\" as \"Time period\" and \"Show different series for\" as \"Treatment.\" Select \"View the report\". Saving, printing, copying, or emailing the report can be done at this time. Certain data points may be excluded in the box below the grouping step if needed.",
    "Under the subheading \"Data\" is an adjustable listing of the raw data from the experiment in spreadsheet form if needed. Note: all the data is now saved and can be manipulated and analyzed at a later time.\n6. Clean Up\nShut off the machine and remove cage wiring. Wash and sanitize the grate, box, bottle, and liquid tray. These components can be washed by hand or dishwasher."
