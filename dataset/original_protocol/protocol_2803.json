    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: This protocol is designed to analyze both plasmablasts (PBs) and memory B cells (MBCs) in samples from acute SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. The principle is the same for PBs and MBCs in both plating and detection, but MBCs require an additional step of stimulation into antibody-secreting cells for their detection, whereas PBs can be plated directly in the ELIspot plate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2501_3.csv\nTotal IgG-secreting B cells and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD)-specific IgG-secreting B cells are detected by B-cell ELISpot. Quantifying total IgG cells requires plating a small number of cells to avoid overlapping spots, whereas RBD-specific IgG cells, due to the rarity of the population, requires a higher number of cells to be plated to detect a sufficient number of spots. However, it is not recommended to plate more than 5 × 105 cells per well to avoid multilayer of cells which will affect the detection.\nCritical: Acute SARS-CoV-2 samples are infectious, and the plates need to be decontaminated before reading the spots on IRIS ELISpot reader (Mabtech). This protocol includes the decontamination steps by UV exposure and incubation with virucidal solution (Virkon). However, if the cells are from recovered patients or healthy volunteer (i.e.: vaccine monitoring) these steps are optional.\nPlasmablast plating [Day 1]\nTiming: 2 h\nPlasmablasts constitutively secrete antibodies and must be analysed by B-cell ELISpot straight after the isolation of PBMCs from whole blood. The ELISpot plate needs to be ready to use before plating the cells. This includes the coating with anti-human-IgG and blocking with R10 medium as described earlier.\nTake out PBMCs: aliquot 6 × 105 cells in an Eppendorf tube from the 2 × 106 cells/mL PBMCs suspension (Tube A) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2501-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of PBMC aliquoting for plating of plasmablasts",
    "Dilute the cells for the “Total IgG” condition (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPrepare a new tube with 656 μL of R10 (Tube B).\nTransfer 10 μL from Tube A into Tube B.\nPlate cells into ELISpot plate.\nEach sample will be distributed into 4 wells: 2 concentrations of cells for each condition “Total IgG” and “RBD”.\nRemove the blocking medium from the plate.\nFill the wells with fresh R10 medium, the volume to add depends on the conditions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2501-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of cell plating\nEach sample is distributed into four wells. The final volume of each well is 200 μL.\nAdd the cells:\n“RBD” (Tube A): 50 μL (1 × 105 cells) and 200 μL (4 × 105 cells).\n“Total IgG” (Tube B): 50 μL (0.15 × 104 cells) and 100 μL (0.3 × 104 cells).\nCritical: Do not let the membrane of the well dry during the procedure. During the plating, it is recommended to plate the highest concentration of the “RBD” condition (200 μL) first since there is no R10 added to keep the membrane wet for this condition. Alternatively, the different cell concentrations can be prepared in a separate 96-wells plate before transferring 200 μL using a multi-channel pipette.\nWrap the plate in aluminum foil to limit evaporation and incubate at 37°C–5% CO2 for 18–24 h.\nCritical: Do not move the plate during the incubation to avoid shifting of the cells in the well.\nMemory B cells stimulation [Day 1]\nTiming: 2 h\nUnlike plasmablasts, memory B cells require in vitro stimulation to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. The same suspension of PBMCs is used as a starting point (at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL).",
    "Take out PBMCs: aliquot 2 × 106 cells in an Eppendorf tube from the 2 × 106 cells/mL PBMCs suspension.\nPrepare 1 mL of stimulation medium for each sample. Add R848 at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. Add IL-2 at a final concentration of 10 ng/mL.\nNote: R848 (TLR7 /8 agonist) directly stimulates memory B cells that constitutively express TLR7 and myeloid cells expressing TLR7 that will bring additional support to B-cell proliferation and differentiation.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] IL-2 is a growth factor for various immune cells, including activated B cells.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nResuspend PBMCs in the stimulation medium.\nCentrifuge down the PBMCs at 500 × g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 1 mL of stimulation medium.\nTransfer into one well of a 48-wells plate and incubate at for 5 days.\nNote: Do not use edge wells on the plate. Instead, fill the empty wells around your wells containing the cells with sterile water to limit sample well evaporation.\nNote: Check the culture after 2–3 days. If some of the wells turned yellow, it is recommended to add fresh medium.\nMemory B cells plating [Day 6]\nTiming: 3 h\nAfter collecting the cells at day 6, the plating of memory B cells follows the same principle as plasmablasts as described in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nCollect and count the stimulated cells.\nCollect the cells from the 48-wells plate and transfer into Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge down the cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C.\nDiscard supernatant (Optional: collect the supernatant in new tubes to analyze antibodies secreted by stimulated B cells).\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL of R10 medium and count nucleated cells: take out 10 μL of cells to mix with 40 μL of methylene blue (dilution 1:5).",
    "Resuspend the cells at 2 × 106 cells/mL in R10 medium. 5.5 × 105 cells are needed to fill all the conditions (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). This suspension corresponds to Tube A (“RBD” condition) as described in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nDilute the cells for the “Total IgG” condition.\nPrepare a new tube with 656 μL of R10 (Tube B).\nTransfer 10 μL from Tube A into Tube B.\nPlate the cells as described in step 3 and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nELISpot plate detection [PB: Day 2 / MBC: Day 7]\nTiming: 4–5 h\nThe detection steps are the same for plasmablasts and memory B cells. The plate for plasmablasts is detected on day 2 while the plate for memory B cells is detected on day 7.\nPrepare the detection reagents:\nAnti-IgG-biotin (detection step A): prepare 100 μL /well in PBS 1× at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL.\nRBD-WASP (detection step A): prepare 100 μL /well in PBS 1× at a 1/25 dilution.\nStreptavidin-ALP (detection step B): prepare 100 μL /well in PBS 1× at 1/1000 dilution.\nAnti-WASP-ALP (detection step B): prepare 100 μL /well in PBS 1× at 1/275 dilution.\nNote: Keep the diluted reagent on ice until use.\nFlick the plate upside down over a waste container. Be careful to avoid splashing of bleach or other liquid in the plate (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nWash the plate with 200 μL of PBS 1× per well for a total of 4 times. Use a pipette to flush up and down in each well for the first wash (to detach all the cells from the wells). Flick the plate upside down for the following washes.",
    "Optional: Place the plate (containing PBS 1×) under UV for 5 min to decontaminate the wells (only in the case of acute samples). Protect the unused wells from UV with aluminum foil. Remove the PBS before adding the detection reagents.\nAdd 100 μL of detection reagents (detection step A, see detail in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) in each well and incubate 2 h at 18°C–22°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2501-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Template for adding of detection reagents\nWash the plate 4 times with 200 μL of PBS 1×.\nAdd 100 μL of detection reagents (detection step B, see detail in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) in each well and incubate 1 h at 18°C–22°C.\nWash the plate 4 times with 200 μL of PBS 1×.\nFilter the BCIP/NBT-plus substrate before usage and add 100 μL in each well.\nCritical: protect from light since BCIP/NBT-plus substrate is sensitive to light which may affect the spots development.\nIncubate 4–5 min and stop the reaction by adding 250 μL of distilled water (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nWash the plate 4 times with 200 μL of distilled water.\nOptional: Add 200 μL of Virkon-S (21.41% Potassium peroxymonosulfate, 1.5% sodium chloride) disinfectant5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] to decontaminate the wells (only in case of acute samples). Incubate 5 min and wash 4 times with 200 μL of distilled water.\nRemove the plastic rubber bottom and let the plate dry at 18°C–22°C before reading.\nCritical: Shake the plate upside down on a tissue between each washing step to remove as much liquid as possible (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]). Removal of the water at the last step will allow the plate to dry faster.\nReading of plate\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "The IRIS ELISpot reader was used to count the spots. More details can be found on Mabtech website (https://www.mabtech.com/iris[href=https://www.mabtech.com/iris]). Other readers can be used but parameters will have to be set up for adequate spot detection.\nThe protocol below provides the parameter used to count RBD and IgG spots using the MabTech reader.\nSelect all the wells to read and start the reading in the IRIS software.\nSelect all wells from the “Total IgG” condition: choose “tiny” emphasis and change the intensity to 80-90 (depend on the development of the spots) in the parameters (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nSelect all wells from the “RBD” condition: choose “big” emphasis and change the intensity to 10-20 (depend on the development of the spots) in the parameters (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9])."
