    "One week prior to the behavioral experiments, each day, all animals are familiarized to the transportation procedure from the housing location to the experimental room. The animals are also handled in the experimental room by the experimenter to habituate them to the procedure. Each day, mice are placed in the experimental room 30 min before the beginning of the behavioral experiments for acclimation. The duration of the entire behavioral procedure is about 9 consecutive days. As depicted below in Figure 2, each mouse is trained and tested in the object-context-place tasks first, followed by the object-location task. Each task procedure consists of three phases: pre-training, training and retention test. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413005057_0064.jpgFigure 2. Experimental design of the object context-place-location paradigmDay 1: Pretraining in contexts A and BAnimals are habituated to contexts A and B. They explore each box for 10 min with no objects present. Each pretraining session is separated by a 1-h inter-trial interval. The pretraining session starts immediately after the animal has been placed, by hand, at the center of the box, its nose facing the south wall. Between each pretraining session, the boxes and objects are cleaned with water followed by 70% EtOH, which is allowed to dry. This is done to prevent build up of olfactory cues.At the end of the 10 min of exploration the animal is removed from the context and returned to its home cage.Note: The order of context exposures is counterbalanced between animals within each experimental group, which was genotype in the case of Tsokas et al. (2016). From Day 2 to Day 4: Training in contexts A and BThe mice are allowed to explore contexts A and B, each during two 5-min trials/day, separated by a 1-h inter-trial interval.",
    "These trials allow the mice to learn the spatial arrangement of the four objects that are associated with each context. Note: The order of each context exploration is counterbalanced between training days and between animals within each experimental group (Table 1). Table 1. Example of counterbalancing the order of context exploration (i.e., Contexts A vs. B) between training days and the order within each experimental group (i.e., Wild Type vs. PKMζ-null in the original study)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413180539_8845.jpgDay 5: Retention test #1 Mice are given a first memory retention test that is either an object/context or an object/place mismatch test. In the object/context mismatch test, two of the four objects that had only been encountered in one context are placed in the second context, whereas in the object/place mismatch test two objects from one four-object configuration are place-permuted in the same context they had previously been encountered. The animal is allowed to explore for 3 min. The 3-min duration of the retention test session has been carefully validated. After 3 min the mice become familiar with the novel object configuration and so spatial novelty triggered by the object permutation is no longer detected by the animal. The mice will subsequently explore all the objects equally, whether or not there is a mismatch.Day 5: Re-exposureThe same day, an hour after the memory retention test, the mice receive an additional training session (5-min exploration twice in each context A and B) in order to minimize the potential effects of learning the mismatch object-space associations that might have been induced by the retention test. Day 6: Retention test #2Mice are given a second 3-min memory retention test, either an object/context or an object/place mismatch test, whichever test was not administered on Day 5.",
    "Note: The order of the retention tests on Days 5 and 6, the objects and the places that are permuted, are counterbalanced between animals within each experimental group (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170417/20170417014046_0913.jpgFigure 3. Counterbalancing Object and/or Place permutations and Retention Test order. A. Examples of spatial-object counterbalancing by making object pair permutations in the Object/Place and Object/Context mismatch tests. Because each subject can have an idiosyncratic preference or dislike for a particular object and/or context, it is important to counterbalance the object-context presentations amongst the subjects within each group during memory tests. There are a very large number of permutations possible. Consider randomizing the objects within a context by exchanging pairs of objects along the horizontal, vertical and two diagonals to generate six unique patterns of permutations and exchanging half of the objects from each context, which will generate 12 object-context arrangements. The six examples of objects permutations represented above from the initial training configuration (the training configuration is displayed as a-b-c-d) in Context A are b-a-c-d (horizontal), a-d-c-b (vertical), a-c-b-d (diagonal); they illustrate counterbalancing of the spatial manipulations for the Object/Place mismatch test. Configurations e-f-c-d (horizontal), a-f-c-h (vertical), a-f-g-d (diagonal) illustrate examples of counterbalancing spatial manipulations for the Object/Context mismatch test. B. Example of counterbalancing the order of the retention tests on Days 5 and 6 (i.e., Object/Place vs. Object/Context mismatch tests) and the type of object permutations between animals within each experimental group (e.g., Wild Type vs. PKMζ-null).Day 7: Pretraining in context CMice are habituated to explore a new context, context C, for 10 min. Day 8: Training in context CMice are allowed to explore context C for three sessions of five minutes separated by 1-h inter-trial interval, to learn the spatial configuration of two new objects in a novel environment.",
    "Day 9: Retention test #3Mice are given a 3-min retention trial consisting of an object/location mismatch test, in which the location of one object is changed. Note: The relocated object and its relative relocation in the context are also counterbalanced between animals within each experimental group.Behavioral measures of memory performanceEach video is analyzed offline to manually score the time the mouse is engaged in exploration of an object for each of the retention tests. Object exploration is defined as the nose of the animal being oriented toward the object at a distance of < 2 cm. Each video is therefore replayed in the Tracker software using a 2 cm wide annular mask around each object to define the object exploratory area. Within this area, animal’s activity such as sniffing or touching the object with paws is counted as object exploratory activity only if the animal’s nose is orientated toward the object (see Notes). Measuring object exploration is performed by an experimenter who is blind to the animal’s experimental group and whether the objects have been changed. Memory performance in the three different memory tests are quantified and analyzed using a discrimination index calculated as the absolute difference in time spent exploring the changed (i.e., incorrect, misplaced or relocated) objects and the unchanged objects divided by the total time spent exploring all the objects. As such, the index takes into account individual differences in the total amount of exploration. Good memory retention corresponds to a positive discrimination index, which reflects that the animal was spending more time exploring the incorrect (object/context mismatch), displaced (object/place mismatch) or relocated (object/location mismatch) objects than the objects that had remained unchanged (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413034947_6936.jpgFigure 4. Representative data of behavioral performance.",
