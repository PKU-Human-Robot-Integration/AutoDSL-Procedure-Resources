    "See Video 1 for the procedure to perform the experiment described in this protocol.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Trace Fear Conditioning Protocol. This video describes the trace fear conditioning protocol to assess hippocampal function in mice (Animals were handled according to approved protocols and animal welfare regulations of the University of Haifa Institutional Ethics Committee). Acquisition of TFCStart the FreezeFrame 3.0 software (Coulbourn Instruments) and select the protocol for TFC See Figure 1 for protocol settings in FreezeFrame 3.0.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812201622_3815.jpgFigure 1. The screenshots from FreezeFrame 3.0 software showing settings used in the TFC protocol. A. Conditioning trial; B. Contextual test; C. Tone and trace test.Turn on the light and fan of the conditioning box and calibrate the shock levels, light levels, and sound intensity levels for the testing chamber. For the TFC protocol, place mice in a chamber (with a 20 W bulb and a 16-bar metal grid floor) for 120 sec. Apply a 2.9 kHz tone for 20 sec at 80 dB (conditioned stimulus, CS) and a 0.5 mA foot shock for 2 sec (unconditioned stimulus, US) at the end of the 20 sec trace interval. Repeat the previous step four times and separate each trial by a 120 sec inter trial interval (ITI). After administration of the last shock, keep the animals in the chamber for 120 sec before taking them back to the home cage in order to maintain a constant ITI during the conditioning procedure. Do not house the mice in the same room as the testing room.Clean the chambers with 10% ethanol between successive sets of mice.Contextual memory testingPlace mice in the conditioning chamber 24 h after conditioning and record freezing for 300 sec (without tone or foot shock) using a visual camera. Analyze the data with FreezeView software (Coulbourn Instruments).",
    "Clean chambers with 10% ethanol between successive sets of mice.Tone and Trace memory testingFor the tone-trace test, place animals in the dark chambers 48 h after conditioning, but hide the grid floor with black plastic to create another context.Present the animals with the TFC protocol as on the conditioning day, but without shock. Record animal behavior using an infrared camera.Clean the chambers with water between successive sets of mice.Extinction of fear memoryExtinction of TFC refers to a reduction in the freezing response after the repeated presentation of a CS in the absence of the previously paired US.Measure extinction of tone-trace fear response 24 h and 48 h after Tone and Trace testing.Place mice in the dark chambers and hide the grid floor with black plastic to create another context. Present the animals with the TFC protocol as on the conditioning day, but without shock. Record animal behavior using an infrared camera.Clean the chambers with water between successive mice. Do not use 10% ethanol, since the mice may associate the smell with the conditioned context. In this case, water constitutes a different context, allowing to test auditory fear response."
