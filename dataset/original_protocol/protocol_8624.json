    "1. Formation of a Monolayer Biofilm of S. oneidensis MR-1 on an ITO Electrode (Figure 1)\nNOTE: To prevent the contamination of the electrochemical reactor with other microbes, all the media, implements, and components of the electrochemical reactor should be sterilized in advance. When using S. oneidensis MR-1 cells and constructing the electrochemical reactors, all the procedures should be conducted on a clean bench.\nCultivation of S. oneidensis MR-1 cells\n\tNOTE: A monolayer biofilm of S. oneidensis MR-1 was formed on an ITO electrode following the conditions reported previously4.\n\t\nTo grow S. oneidensis MR-1 cells, add one colony of S. oneidensis MR-1 grown on an agar plate comprising Luria-Bertani (LB) (20 g/L) and bacto agar (15 g/L) into 15 mL of LB medium (20 g/L) at 30 °C for 24 h in aerobic conditions with shaking at 160 rpm.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspend the resultant cell pellet in 15 mL of defined medium (pH 7.8) (DM: NaHCO3 [2.5 g/L], CaCl2·2H2O [0.08 g/L], NH4Cl [1.0 g/L], MgCl2·6H2O [0.2 g/L], NaCl [10 g/L], and 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES; 7.2 g/L]), supplemented with 10 mM lactate and 0.5 g/L yeast extract as the source of carbon, and trace elements for S. oneidensis MR-1, respectively.\nFurther cultivate the cell suspension aerobically at 30 °C for 12 h with shaking at 160 rpm and centrifuge again at 6,000 × g for 10 min. Wash the resultant cell pellet twice with DM medium by centrifugation for 10 min at 6,000 × g before the electrochemical experiment.\nConstruction of a three-electrode electrochemical reactor (Figure 1)\n\t\nPut an ITO substrate as the working electrode at the bottom of the reactor.",
    "Subsequently, insert a glass cylinder (diameter of 2 cm) and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cover. Then insert Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated) and a platinum wire into the reactor as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent the leakage of air and solution, insert a butyl rubber sheet between each component.\nAdd 4.0 mL of DM supplemented with 10 mM lactate and 0.5 g/L yeast extract into the electrochemical reactor.\nAfter confirming that there is no leakage from the electrochemical reactor, flow the nitrogen gas into the electrochemical reactor over 20 min to maintain anaerobic conditions inside the electrochemical reactor.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent contamination with other microbes, the gas should be filtered before it flows into the electrochemical reactor.\nConnect the electrochemical reactor to a potentiostat and apply +0.4 V (versus standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) to the ITO electrode, keeping the temperature of the electrochemical reactor at 30 °C using an external water circulation system.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent the effect of an external electric field, the electrochemical reactor should be placed in a Faraday cage.\nElectrochemical cultivation of S. oneidensis MR-1 cells (Figure 1 and Figure 2)\n\t\nAdjust the cell density of the suspension obtained in step 1.1 to an optical density of 1.43 at 600 nm (OD600) with DM supplemented by 10 mM lactate and 0.5 g/L yeast extract.\n\t\tNOTE: To obtain the correct OD600, apply the cell suspension of OD600 ≤ 0.8 to a UV-vis spectrometer prior to adjusting the OD600 to 1.43.\nAdd 0.3 mL of the cell suspension into the electrochemical reactor through the injection port using a syringe: the OD600 in the reactor changes to 0.1.",
    "NOTE: The addition of 0.3 mL cell suspension with OD600 = 1.43 into electrochemical reactor containing 4.0 mL medium results in 4.3 mL of solution with an OD600 = 0.1. When using other reactors with different volumes, the calculation of the cell density is required.\nContinue the potential application at +0.4 V (versus SHE) to the ITO electrode for 25 h.\n\t\tNOTE: For the formation of a monolayer biofilm on an ITO electrode, ensure that the produced current exhibits a deviation less than 50% from Figure 2.\n2. Replacement of the Supernatant with Fresh DM Medium with 10 mM Lactate (Figure 3)\nStop the potential application and disconnect the electrochemical reactor from the potentiostat and the water circulation system.\nReplacement of the supernatant with fresh DM medium with 10 mM lactate\n\t\nFlow the nitrogen gas into a bottle containing DM with 10 mM lactate over 20 min to remove oxygen from the medium.\nSlowly remove all the supernatant inside the electrochemical reactor using a syringe, under flowing nitrogen gas (Figure 3a, b).\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid breaking the biofilm on the ITO electrode by nitrogen gas, the gas should flow above the liquid surface.\nAdd 4.0 mL of fresh DM containing 10 mM lactate using a syringe (Figure 3c).\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid breaking the biofilm on the ITO electrode, slowly inject the medium along the wall of the electrochemical reactor. To keep the biofilm wet, the medium should be added immediately after the removal of supernatant. Injection of the medium upto 1 min after the removal of supernatant does not impact the current production from the biofilm of S. oneidensis MR-1.\nSlant the electrochemical reactor to remove all of the supernatant attached to the wall of the electrochemical reactor.\nRepeat the steps 2.2.2-2.2.4 three times in total.",
    "Stop the gas flow and connect the electrochemical reactor to the potentiostat again, applying +0.4 V (versus SHE) to the ITO electrode at 303 K.\n3. Addition of Deuterium Water to Measure the KIE on the EET Process (Figure 4)\nConfirm that the current production from a monolayer biofilm of S. oneidensis MR-1 is stable and does not increase rapidly. If the current increases steeply, wait until the current stabilizes within a 5% increase over 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The formation of a monolayer biofilm on an ITO electrode without contamination of other microbial strains was confirmed by rDNA sequences and a scanning electron microscopic image of the biofilm on an ITO electrode, as reported previously4. For confirmation of the rate limitation by the EET process, monitor the effect of adding shuttling electron mediators such as 100 µM anthraquinone-1-sulfonate ( α-AQS). See the section of Representative Results and reference15 for further details.\nAdd 40 µL of anoxic 50% (v/v) D2O into the electrochemical reactor using a syringe such that the concentration is 0.5% (v/v) D2O in the reactor.\n\tNOTE: To prevent damage to the biofilm by D2O addition, inject the D2O drop-wise.\nWait for the current to stabilize, and subsequently add the D2O up to 4.0% (v/v).\n\tNOTE: To obtain the KIE value (the ratio of current production in the presence of D2O and H2O), check the effect of the same volume of H2O addition on the current production.\nSubscription Required.
