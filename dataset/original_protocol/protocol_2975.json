    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCell Lysis of HEK293 Cells\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes the preparation and lysis of HEK293 cells.\nDay 1\nTiming: 1 h\nSeed 10 mL of HEK293 cells at 7–9 × 105 cells/mL into a 10-cm dish and incubate the cells for 16–24 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.\nDay 2\nTiming: 3 h\nNote: We use Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit with the modifications noted below.\nAspirate the medium from the dish. Place the dish on ice, rinse the dish with 10 mL of PBS (prechilled on ice), and then aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 600 μL of lysis buffer, pipette several times to cover the entire dish surface and transfer the cell lysate to a 1.5-mL tube by pipetting.\nNote: Leaning the dish and pipetting lysis buffer pooled at the lower corner of the dish toward the top of dish several times allows the entire detachment of cells from the dish.\nAdd 7.5 μL of 2 U/μL Turbo DNase I and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the sample at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nCollect the supernatant by pipetting into a new 1.5-mL tube and mix well by pipetting.\nMeasure the RNA concentration in lysate by a Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nFlash-freeze the sample by liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C. Proceed to step 20.\nPause Point: The lysate may be stored at −80°C.\nNote: The lysate typically contains 200–300 ng/μL RNA.\nCell Lysis from Zebrafish Embryos\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes the preparation and lysis of zebrafish embryos.\nDay 1\nTiming: 30 min",
    "In the evening, a day before collecting fertilized eggs, transfer adult zebrafish at a ratio of 1 male to 2 females in a mating tank and incubate them for 14–16 h.\nDay 2\nTiming: Variable\nNote: We use Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit with the modifications noted below.\nAt the beginning of the next light cycle, allow males and females to mate naturally.\nCollect fertilized eggs and let them develop in system water at 28.5°C.\nAdd pronase at a concentration of 1 mg/mL and incubate embryos at 26°C–28.5°C until their chorions lose elasticity.

Both options should work well in either HEK293 or zebrafish embryo lysates.
