    "1. Nitration of Angiotensin II\nTo generate nitrated peptide, dilute 10 μL of Angiotensin II (DRVYIHPF) parent solution (2 mM in water) in 390 μL PBS solution (10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) at the final concentration of 50 μM.\nAdd 10 μL of peroxynitrite (200 mM in 4.7% NaOH) to the Angiotensin II solution to make the final concentration of peroxynitrite 5 mM.\n\tNOTE: Peroxynitrite is unstable and easy to resolve when it is in acid form, so parent solution of peroxynitrite is kept in basic solution and stored in -80 °C.\nAdjust the pH value of the solution to 7-8 by 1 M HCl. To initiate the nitration reaction, shake the tube at 400 rpm for 5 min.\nUse a commercially available reverse phase SPE column (see Table of Materials) for the desalting.\n\t\nPrepare 2 solutions for the desalting, 5% methanol in water for the washing and 80% methanol in water for the elution.\nAdd 500 μL of methanol, followed by 500 μL of water to pre-condition the column, put 1 mL pipettor with the tip on the top of the column, press the pipettor to accelerate the flow.\nLoad 410 μL of the sample in step 1.3 on the column, discard the flow through.\nAfter washing with 500 μL of 5% methanol, use 300 μL of 80% methanol to elute the nitropeptide, which is then fully dried by speed-vac in the default setting at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Desalting is very important for the reactions, since the solvent left in the previous step may have a negative effect on the next steps.\n2. Alkylation of primary amines by dimethyl labeling\nReconstitute the powdered nitro-Angiotensin II in 100 μL of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) solution.",
    "NOTE: The pH value of the solution should be between 7 and 9, and make sure no primary amine is added in the solution.\nAdd 4 μL of 4% formaldehyde to the solution, mix briefly.\n\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde vapors are toxic; perform the experiments in a fume hood.\nAdd 4 μL of 0.6 M NaBH3CN to the solution, shake the tube at 400 rpm for 1 h at room temperature.\nQuench the labeling reaction by adding 16 μL of 1% ammonia solution, incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 8 μL of formic acid to acidify the solution and perform desalting using reverse phase SPE column as described in step 1.4.\n3. Reduction of nitrotyrosine to aminotyrosine\nReconstitute the dimethyl labeled nitro-Angiotensin II in 500 μL of PBS (10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAdd 10 μL of 1 M sodium dithionate to the solution and incubate at room temperature for 1 h. After the reduction reaction, the yellow color of the solution becomes clear.\n\tNOTE: Weigh 174.1 mg sodium dithionate and dissolve it in water to make the final volume is 1 mL. This solution can be stored at -20 °C no longer than a week.\nUse the reverse phase SPE column for the desalting as described in step 1.4.\n4. Biotinylation, enrichment, and detection\nReconstitute the dimethyl labeled amino Angiotensin II in 500 μL of PBS (10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAdd 5 μL of 40 nM NHS-S-S-biotin, dissolved in DMSO, to the solution, after 2 h incubation at room temperature, use 1 μL of 5% hydroxylamine to quench the reaction.",
    "In the meantime, equilibrate streptavidin agarose beads by adding 500 μL of PBS (10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), centrifuging at 580 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discarding the supernatant. Perform the equilibration 3 times.\nAdd 100 μL streptavidin agarose beads to the reaction system, incubate 1 h on a rotary shaker at room temperature. Wash 4 times with PBS (10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). For each washing step, add 500 μL of PBS to the beads, mix well, then centrifuge at 580 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nUse 400 μL of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to incubate with agarose beads at 50 °C for 45 min, spin down at 580 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the beads, add 20 μL of 0.5 M idoacetamide (IAM) to the supernatant for 20 min in darkness.\n\tNOTE: DTT is used to break the disulfide bond between the link of biotin and peptide, the latter is released from beads and further alkylated by IAM.\nUse reverse phase SPE column for the desalting shown in step 1.4.\nAfter resolving the dry peptides in 20 μL of 0.1% formic acid (FA), subject the product of each section to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.\n\t\nSeparate the modified Ang II peptides by a 60 min gradient elution (0-8 min, 2% B; 8-10 min, 5% B; 10-35 min, 18% B; 35-50 min, 28% B; 50-52 min, 80% B; 52-58 min, 80% B; 58-59 min, 2% B; 59-60 min, 2% B) at a flow rate 0.300 μl/min with nano-HPLC system which is directly interfaced with the high resolution mass spectrometer.",
    "NOTE: The analytical column is in 75 μm ID, 150 mm length, packed with C-18 resin. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.\nOperate the mass spectrometer in the data-dependent acquisition mode, set a single full-scan mass spectrum (300-1800 m/z, 60 000 resolution) followed by 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans at 28% normalized collision energy.\nOpen mass spectra data and identify the peaks of the product in each step to confirm the chemical reaction has been successfully performed.\n5. Quantification of nitropeptide\nPrepare 3 sets of nitro-Angiotensin II solutions from step 1.4, each set containing 2 concentrations of nitro-Angiotensin II: Set #1, 20 nmol in tube A and 20 nmol in tube B, each in 100 μl TEAB solution; Set #2, 10 nmol in tube C and 20 nmol in tube D, each in 100 μl TEAB solution; Set #3, 40 nmol in tube E and 10 nmol in tube F, each in 100 μl TEAB solution.\n\tNote: The two concentrations of nitro-Angiotensin II in each set are used for dimethyl labeling, to react with formaldehyde (light) and formaldehyde-D2 (heavy), respectively.\nFor each set, add 4 μL of 4% formaldehyde and formaldehyde-D2 to the sample to be labeled as light and heavy, respectively. Follow the steps 2.3 to 2.5 to finish dimethyl labeling.\nMix the light and heavy labeled samples.\nFollow the steps from 3.1 to 4.6 for the reduction, biotinylation, enrichment, and detection.\nSubscription Required.
