    "Note that the sgRNA sequences should be sure to include the oligo overhangs. Importantly, we add a ‘G’ as the initiation nucleotide, making the transcription more efficient.\nOur lab usually adds a ‘G’ when ordering oligos. On the 5’ end of the Forward Oligo, there will be a ‘CACCG’ sequence, and on the 5’ end of the Reverse Oligo, there will be an ‘AAAC’ sequence. The overhangs are required for the oligos to be complementary to the linearized plasmid backbone during ligation, which will allow for successful cloning. Thus, the oligo orders should be ‘5’-CACCGN...N-3’ and ‘5’- AAACN...NC-3’.\nThe ordered sgRNAs will arrive as two single-stranded guide RNA per gRNA. An annealing step must be performed prior to cloning.\n(Optional. This step is additional verification for efficiency and specificity of designed sgRNAs.) Off-target sgRNA comparison prevents unwanted gene manipulation.\nTo check for off-target interactions for your generated sgRNAs you can use various tools, we used http://crispor.tefor.net/[href=http://crispor.tefor.net/].\nFor ‘step 1’ copy and paste the binding element sequence for the sgRNA you wish to verify.\nThe sequence must be at least 20 base pairs long.\nSecond, for ‘step 2’, select the genome of interest.\nWe chose ‘Homo sapiens – Human – UCSC Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) + SNPs: 1000Genomes, ExaC’.\nThird, for ‘step 3’, select the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\nWe used the default selection ‘20bp-NGG-Sp Cas9, SpCas9HF1, eSpCas9 1.1’.\nSelect ‘Submit’, and wait about 10–15 s to get the results.\nThe two specificity scores, MIT and CFD, can then be used to gauge the likelihood of your sgRNA having off-target genome effects.\nThe scores range from 0–100, with the higher scores indicating a lower off-target effect on the genome of interest.\nsgRNAs should have a specificity score greater than 50 to be utilized for cloning and later transfection.",
    "Note: The U6 RNA Pol III promoter transcription starts at the +1 position (23 nucleotides after the TATA box), with G as the preferred initiation nucleotide for RNA Pol III promoters. A Guanine nucleotide must be included on one of the 5’ ends of the sgRNA, if it is not already included, to ensure that there is complete and efficient transcription (Kim et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: Check whether sgRNAs target the sharing motifs, which may potentially influence the expression of neighboring genes.\nCloning custom sgRNAs into lentiviral vector of lentiGuide-Hygro-mTagBFP2\nTiming: 1 week\nAnneal DNA Oligos\nOrder 25 nmole DNA oligos.\nReconstitute the dehydrated oligos with UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water to a 100 μM stock. Store at –20°C.\nAlternatively, order the oligos in a reconstituted form to save time if working with a large quantity of sgRNA.\nSet up the oligo phosphorylation and annealing for each forward (FWD) and reverse (REV) oligos. Oligos can be ordered phosphorylated.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_694_6.csv\nIncubate the reaction mixture in a thermocycler using the following parameters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).

Thermocycler program for annealing\nCombine 3 μL of each annealed oligos to create a pool of all annealed oligos. Once pooled, dilute the annealed oligos at a 1:10 dilution with UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water.\nPause Point: Store both the un-pooled annealed oligos and the pooled/diluted annealed oligos at –20°C until future use.\nGolden Gate Assembly allows for simultaneous digestion and ligation.\nPrepare the backbone of lentiGuide-Hygro-mTagBFP2 with a concentration of 25 ng/μL. Check for the BsmBI recognition sequence prior to running the assembly.\nClone the annealed oligos (from step 5) into the lentiGuide-Hygro-mTagBFP2 plasmid via the BsmBI restriction sites (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/694-Fig3.jpg",

GENTLY mix by flicking the bottom of the tube with your finger a few times.\nIncubate the competent cell/DNA mixture on ice for 20–30 min.\nHeat-shock each transformation tube by placing the bottom 1/2 to 2/3 of the tube into a 42°C water bath for 30–60 s (45 sec is usually ideal).\nPut the tubes back on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 250–1,000 μL LB or SOC medium (without antibiotic) to the bacteria and grow in 37°C shaking incubator for 45 min.\nPlate some or all of the transformation onto a 10-cm LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic (ampicillin).\nIncubate plates at 37°C overnight (18–24 h).\nNext morning, check for colonies (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Pause Point: Bacterial colony plates may be stored at 4°C for weeks. However, we recommend the verification of recombinant colonies by DNA sequencing soon.\nValidation of cloning by Sanger sequencing\nSelect 6 individual colonies (not satellite colonies) from each LB plate.\nPut a single colony into 4 mL of TB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nIncubate at 37°C, shaking at 300 rpm for approximately 16 h.\nExtract DNA using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit, or a miniprep kit from an alternative vendor, such as QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit.

    "Critical: NIH guidelines require the maintenance of a Biological Safety Level 2 (BSL-2) facility for work involving lentivirus. BSL-2 labs require: (1) all personnel to wear lab coats and gloves, (2) all procedures that may produce infectious aerosols or splashes to be performed within a biological safety cabinet (BSC), (3) an autoclave, or alternative method of decontamination, to be available, (4) for the laboratory doors to be self-closing, and (5) for sink and eyewash stations to be readily available. For more info, please refer to this link: https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/biosafety/[href=https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/biosafety/]).\nCritical: Steps of lentivirus collection and concentration should be performed in a BSC.\nPerform transfection when 293T cells are at approximately 80% confluency on a 15-cm plate.\nThaw or prewarm PEI and Opti-MEM on a 37°C water or bead bath.\nIn a 15 mL conical tube, combine PEI and DNA mixture in a 1:1 ratio.\nDrop PEI mixture into DNA mixture slowly to avoid precipitating the DNA (can be seen as white wisps).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_694_8.csv\nGently agitate once between drops to minimize precipitated DNA.\nGently swirl 5 times after adding all the PEI.\nInvert 5 times and gently vortex for 10 sec.\nIncubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) (the solution will become translucent).\nDrop ∼700 μL of the PEI/DNA mixture onto a 15-cm plate with ∼80% confluent 293T cells and put the plate into the incubator.\nAfter 6–8 h, perform a full media change (15 mL).\nAfter 48 h, harvest the first batch of viral media into a 50 mL conical tube or another sterile container.\nAdd 15 mL of media to the plate and return the plate to the incubator.\nAfter 24 h, harvest the second batch of viral media into a 50 mL conical tube or another sterile container.",
    "Discard the plate in an appropriate manner. Treat the 293T cell plates with a 10% bleach solution for 10 min and aspirate the solution before discarding plates into the biohazard bin.\nFilter collected viral media from both batches by passing through a 0.22 μm pore size filter into a 50 mL conical tube or another sterile container.\nNote: VSVG is an envelope protein, acting as an empty backbone for lentiviral production. MDL and Rev are the 3rd generation lentiviral packaging plasmids that are required for generating functional lentiviral particles.\nPause Point: Store filtered viral media on ice in a bucket at 4°C for less than 3 days.\nCritical: Under microscope, 293T cells should give very high transfection efficiency (≥97%) for all gRNAs. This is a necessity for high-titer virus production (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nLentivirus Concentration\nTiming: ∼4 h\nThis step produces concentrated lentivirus in tissue culture media for use in 2D cell culture infection protocols.\nNote: It is recommended to concentrate lentivirus on the day of the second viral media harvest to maximize virus yield. However, the viral media can also be stored for less than 3 days at 4°C for concentrating.\nSecure the centrifuge rotor into the ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter L-100XP Ultracentrifuge, or Optima XE-90 with 32 SW-Ti rotor) and pre-cool to 4°C.\nIn the BSC, using sterile forceps, insert empty 38.5-mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes into the metal centrifuge tubes for the rotor being utilized.\nCap the metal centrifuge tubes and pre-chill in 4°C for 15 min.\nRetrieve tubes and add 25–38 mL of filtered viral media (see above, Lentivirus Production, step 9-k) into polypropylene centrifuge tubes.\nCap metal centrifuge tubes and carefully bring to ultracentrifuge.\nCentrifuge samples at 45,891 × g at 4°C for 2 h.\nAfter centrifugation, bring metal tubes back to the BSC.",
    "Carefully open the metal centrifuge tubes and use sterile forceps to remove the inserted polypropylene centrifuge tubes.\nRemove supernatant media by gently tilting the polypropylene centrifuge tubes and aspirating close to the top.\nGently resuspend virus pellet (almost invisible) with DMEM or medium of choice.\nAvoid pipetting up and down during resuspension more than 10 times.\nVolume depends on how much you want to concentrate the virus.\nResuspension with 500 μL should yield virus on the order of 106 IU/mL.\nPipette the resuspended virus into a sterile 15 mL conical tube or 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 × g for 5 min to pellet any residual cell debris. Aliquot supernatant into 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPause Point: Store at –80°C until future use.\nCritical: Minimize freeze-thaw cycles: a single freeze-thaw cycle can reduce infection efficiency by 50%.\nLentivirus Titration\nTiming: ∼ 2 h\nThis step uses the abm’s qPCR lentivirus titration kit (Cat#: LV900) to assess the amount of virus particles in the concentrated lentiviral preparations. These steps follow those outlined in the manufacturer’s protocol.\nIn a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 2 μL of lentivirus to 18 μL of PBS (1:10 dilution).\nIn a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 2 μL of the diluted virus (from step 11-a) to 18 μL of Virus Lysis Buffer (1:10 dilution).\nGently mix by swirling pipette tip around or tapping tube.\nIncubate mixture at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 3 min. This solution is now referred to as the ‘viral lysate’.\nNote: The Ct value of the viral lysate will be used to determine the titer of the concentrated lentivirus preparation. The viral sample has since been diluted 1:10 twice; therefore, these dilution factors need to be considered in the titration calculation.\nSet-up qPCR reactions in triplicate, except negative control (NTC).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_694_9.csv",
    "Program the real-time qPCR instrument with the following cycle protocol (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/694-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Alternatively, the following formulas can be used (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]):\nTiter of viral lysate = [100 ×] 5 × 107/23(Ctx-Ct1)/(Ct2-Ct1)\nCtx = Average of 3 Ct values of the unknown sample\nCt1 = Average of 3 Ct values of STD1\nCt2 = Average of 3 Ct values of STD2\nNote: Because the viral lysate had been diluted 1:10 twice, a total dilution factor of 100× was factored into the titer calculation. Adjust the dilution factor as needed.\nLentiviral spinfection\nTiming: ∼6 h\nThe time of spinfection and the G-force may increase the transduction efficiency.\nTypically, 2.5–5.0 × 105 NPCs are seeded into one well of a 24-well plate and evenly distributed. Cells are incubated overnight (18–24 h).\nOn day -1, exchange with NPC medium containing pLV-TetO-hNGN2-eGFP-P2A-Neo, FUW-M2rtTA, and CRISPRi-gRNA in lentiGuide-Hygro-mTagBFP2.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_694_11.csv\nKeep the plate in the incubator at 37°C for 15 min.\nPlace the plate in the plate centrifuge and spin at 1,000 × g, 25°C for 1 h.\nReturn the plate back to the 37°C incubator.\nReplaced with fresh NPC medium after 3–4 h of transduction.\nNote: Purpose of each virus: FUW-M2rtTA activates the tetracycline activator to induce NGN2 expression to initiate neuron differentiation. pLV-TetO-hNGN2-eGFP-P2A-Neo expresses human neurogenin-2 under control of TetON promoter, to generate NGN2-induced neurons from hiPSCs and hiPSC-NPCs. LentiGuide-Hygro-mTagBFP2 serves as lentiviral backbone for gRNA delivery to gene of interest. ATP6V1Ai_1/2 contain synthetic gRNA for gene-targeted perturbation.",
    "Note: We need to pre-install Microscopy Filter Cubes for BFP (Excitation: 390 nm, Emission: 460 nm) (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) to check whether cells are blue-positive, determining the efficiency of lentiviral transduction. Next day, in spite of faint blue signal, there should be a >90% transduction efficiency across donors post infection.\nNeuronal differentiation\nTiming: 21 days\nExogenous human NGN2 transduction can rapidly induce NPCs into functional glutamatergic neurons in three weeks. See the schematic overview of our strategy for neuronal differentiation in our study (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/694-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Replaced with fresh NPC medium containing Dox, hygro, and G418 (optionally with puromycin if concerned with the loss of dCas9-KRAB transgene in NPCs) (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nOn day 3, a large number of cells may die due to antibiotic selection. Replace with neuron medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) containing Dox (1 μg/mL).\nDuring day 5–13, half media change every 2 days.\nDuring day 13–21, a complete media change to remove Dox and add 50 nM Cytosineb-D- arabinofuranoside hydrochloride (Ara-C) into neuron medium.\nAra-C reduces the proliferation of non-neuronal cells in the culture.\nGently replace half of the media every other day. Add media towards the wall of the well to avoid neuron detachment (see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nOn day 21 (D21), fix D21 NGN2 neurons with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and characterize them by immunofluorescence with TUJ1 (1:1,000, #801202, mouse IgG2a) and MAP2 (1:2,000, ab5392, chicken antibody).",
    "Pause Point: D21 NGN2 neurons can be fixed with 4% PFA and stored at 4°C for future immunofluorescence. TRIzol/RIPA-lysed samples can be stored at –20°C for future biochemical assays.\nNote: Dox induction should yield a high percentage of GFP-positive cells.\nNote: To measure the neuronal electric activity, we strongly recommend NGN2 neurons should be co-cultured with human fetal astrocytes to enhance neuronal maturation. On day 3, astrocytes are split as 17,000 cells/well in a Matrigel-coated 48W MEA plate (Axion Biosystems, M768-tMEA-48W) and maintained as above. On day 7, 70,000 NGN2 neurons are detached, spun down, and seeded on the astrocytes culture. We can detect the population-wide neuronal activity, including frequency and coordination of network firing, and the amplitude of voltage-gated potassium (K+) current and sodium (Na+) current using an Axion multi-electrode array (MEA) or whole-cell patch-clamp recordings respectively. We can keep the neuronal culture up to 35 days for recording if necessary.\nCritical: If there is a need to seed cells on to a microplate, such as a CytoView 48-well MEA plate, for neuronal activity measurement, then we highly recommend that you split NGN2 neurons using Accutase before differentiation day 7. Dissociating neurons at later stages of neuronal differentiation may lead to increased cell death and potential loss of cultures.\nValidation of CRISPRi-induced gene repression by qPCR and western blot\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The validation step is a critical prerequisite before starting a functional study. There is a necessity to redesign and test new gRNAs if CRISPRi fails to significantly repress gene mRNA and protein expression (see troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Reduced gene expression may vary greatly according to genes, gRNAs, transduced tissue types, and batches. We expect a consistent and significant reduction of gene transcription and protein translation. A satisfying level of CRISPRi can sufficiently knockdown the genes of interest to yield a phenotype, even though a small reduction may be achieved.\nQuantitative PCR validation\nRNA extraction: 21-day NGN2 neurons in 250 μL of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, #10296028) per 24-well well. Add 50 μL of Chloroform (Fisher Chemical, #C298).

Transfer the clear aqueous phase to tubes with 150 μL of isopropanol (Fisher Bioreagents, #BP2618) and 1 μL of GlycoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM9516) or Glycogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #R0551), taking care not to carry over the white interface. Spin at maximum speed (21,130 × g) at 4°C for 15 min. Wash the RNA with ice cold 70% ethanol (Fisher Bioreagents, #BP201851). Resuspend in 50 μL of UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Invitrogen, #10977) and adjust concentration to 25 ng/μL.\nFollow manufacturer's instructions of TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-Step Kit (Invitrogen, #4392938). Alternatively, Reverse transcribe RNA into cDNA using the Promega RT system (Promega, #A3500). Run samples on the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR machine using SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, #4472903). Design qPCR primers for genes of interest of the users. In our study, primers for ATP6V1A and the housekeeping gene of β-Actin are listed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_694_13.csv",
