    "All methods described here have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the PLA Army General Hospital.\n1. Materials\nPreparation of LPS injection\n\t\nAdd 25 mL of distilled water to 25 mg of LPS powder derived from S. typhimurium to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Store the injection in a sterile tube at 4 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: LPS is toxic.\nPrepare a 2% EB solution in normal 0.9% saline solution to keep EB injection at working concentration.\n2. Animals\nAdminister LPS to male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, aged 10 weeks (average weight: 280 ± 20 g) by intraperitoneal injection.\n\tCAUTION: If rats are purchased from another organization, then the adaptive phase should not be less than 7 days.\n3. LPS Injections\nInject LPS intraperitoneally into each rat at a dose of 1 mg/kg, and return the rats to their home cage.\n\tNOTE: Anesthesia is not necessary.\nSix hours later, inject the same dose of LPS injection into the rats.\nSixteen hours later inject the same dose of LPS into the rats.\n\tCAUTION: Injecting SD rats with LPS at a dose of 1 mg/kg may result in a 5% mortality rate. The mortality rate could further increase in younger or older rats or pregnant female rats.\nReturn the rats to their cages after LPS injection and provide ad libitum access to food and drink.\n\tNOTE: Rats will exhibit a distinct systemic inflammatory response, and thus it is essential that the cages remain clean throughout the experiment. Rats should be frequently (2x day) monitoring for weight, general appearance and attitude after the first LPS injection. If the rats start to exhibit a hunched posture, unwillingness to move, significant weight loss (>20%), porphyrin staining that they be humanely euthanized prior to the 7 day EB study end point.",
    "4. Sample Collection\nEB injection\n\t\nSeven days after the first injection, anesthetize the rat by intraperitoneally according to your approved IACUC protocol. \nWait 1–2 min until the rats do not show corneal reflex responses. Perform a 5–8 mm-deep cardiac puncture on each rat; the puncturing point should be 5 mm to the left margin of sternum at the 3rd and 4th intercostals space.\nWait until blood recovery is observed, and then inject EB at a dose of 0.2 mL/100 g body weight into the left heart ventricle.\n\t\tCAUTION: Cardiac puncture and EB injection should be carefully performed. EB might be injected into thoracic cavity or pericardium instead of the left heart ventricle.\n\t\t\nSuck back with an empty tube and replace this volume with an EB tube before injection to help reduce the failure rate (e.g., injection to rib cage by error).\nKeep the rat in a supine position for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: If sample is not used to detect EB leakage in immunofluorescence imaging, then this step may be omitted.\nGross observation\n\t\nPerform cardiac perfusions using ice-cold 1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to clear the cerebral vasculature and brains.\n\t\t\nUsing a scalpel, make an abdominal incision across the entire length of the diaphragm.\nCut through ribs just left of the rib cage midline.\nOpen up the thoracic cavity. Use clamps to expose the heart and to facilitate drainage of blood and other fluids.\nWhile steadily holding the heart with forceps (the heart should still be beating), directly insert a needle into the protrusion of the left ventricle to extend this to about 5 mm. Secure the needle at that position by clamping near the point of entry.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Do not excessively extend the needle, as it can pierce the interior wall and compromise the circulation of solutions.",
    "Release the valve to allow the flow ice-cold PBS solution (200–300 mL) at a slow and steady rate at around 20 mL/min using a perfusion pump. If the animals require fixation instead of gross observation, then use the same dose of ice-cold 0.9% saline solution.\nUsing sharp scissors, make an incision in the atrium, ensuring that the solution continuously flows. If the fluid does not flow freely or is coming from the animal’s nostrils or mouth, reposition the needle.\nScreen for CMHs by gross observation.\n\t\tNOTE: If the sample is not used in calculating the number of CMHs by gross observation, then this step may be omitted.\nFixation\n\t\nPerform cardiac perfusions using ice-cold 0.9% saline solution (200–300 mL) to clear the cerebral vasculature and brains.\nPerform cardiac perfusions using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation.\nDecapitate the rat, isolate the brain, and immerse the brain in 20% sucrose solution for at least 6 h.\nChange the solution into 30% sucrose and fix for another 6 h.\nPrepare 10 mm-thick brain tissues sections using a cryostat.\n5. HE Staining\nNOTE: This procedure is performed using a HE Staining Kit.\nWash the slides in distilled water.\nStain in hematoxylin solution for 8 min. Wash in running tap water for 5 min.\nDifferentiate in 1% acid alcohol for 30 s. Wash in running tap water for 1 min.\nStain in 0.2% ammonia water (Bluing) or saturated lithium carbonate solution for 30 s to 1 min. Wash in running tap water for 5 min.\nRinse in 95% alcohol (10 dips).\nCounterstain with eosin solution for 30 s to 1 min.\nDehydrate through 95% alcohol, two changes of absolute alcohol, for 5 min each.\nClear in xylene for 30 s.\nMount using Liu’s method9.\nAnalyze using a brightfield fluorescence microscope.",
    "NOTE: Red blood cells released from blood vessels, which are the components of CMHs, appear in red-orange under HE staining.\n6. Perl Prussian Blue Staining\nNOTE: This procedure is performed using a Perls Staining Kit.\nWash slides with distilled water.\nStain in reaction solution with equal parts mixture of ferrocyanide and hydrochloric acid for 10 min.\nDehydrate, clear, mount, and analyze the slides as described in steps 5.7–5.10.\n7. EB double-staining\nNOTE: This procedure follows step 4.1.3.\nWash slides with PBS three times for 5 min each.\nIncubate slides with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution for 15 min at room temperature.\nWash the slides with PBS solution three times for 5 min each, and mount slides with PBS-glycerol solution.\nAnalyze images on a fluorescence microscope. EB deposition is indicated by red fluorescence; nuclei are indicated by blue fluorescence.\n8. MRI-SWI\nPerform MRI on a 7-T magnet equipped with an actively shielded gradient system (16 cm inner diameter).\nSeven days after treatment, anesthetize the rats by facemask inhalation of 1.5–2.0% isoflurane using an isoflurane anesthesia system.\nApply vet ointment onto the eyes of the rat to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nKeep the rats in prone position and perform an MRI-SWI scan.\nObtain SWI weighted scans using a fast-spin echo sequence using the following parameters: echo time (TE) 8 ms, repetition time (TR) 40 ms, flip angle=12°, field of view (FOV) 35 mm × 35 mm, acquisition matrix 384 × 384, to acquire 1 mm-thick slices.\nIdentify CMHs in MRI-SWI according to Greenberg et al.11, which included the following criteria: (1) a diameter of ≤10 mm, and (2) circular, isolated, and low-signal intensity spots.\nAt the end of the experiment, euthanize the rats using the overdose carbon dioxide (at a flow of 6 L/min or 30% of the container volume) method.",
