    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of PDMS gels\nTiming: 4–5 h\nTraction force microscopy (TFM) using PDMS substrates can be used to infer patterns of mechanical stress thereby providing quantitative information on cellular mechanics.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] E-cadherin coating of PDMS substrates allows for the detection of traction forces at AJ.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] In particular, it was used to visualize E-cadherin-dependent force transmission of F-actin retrograde flows.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Before the E-cadherin coat can be applied, nano bead-embedded PDMS gels have to be generated.\nThoroughly mix equal quantities of CY-52-276 A and CY-52-276 B.\nNote: This protocol generates PDMS gels with a stiffness of 10–20 kPa. Different stiffnesses can be obtained by changing the CY-52-276 A : CY-52-276 B ratio.\nPipette 120 μL of mix into the center of a single well from a 2-well Eppendorf chamber.\nSpin-coat the solution using centrifugation for 1 min at 500 G to achieve an evenly spread flat gel.\nYou can use a Laurell WS-650MZ-23NPPB for spin-coating.\nCure gel for 2 h at 80°C.\nAdd 2 mL 5% 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTES) in 100% EtOH to silanize gel.\nIncubate gel for 5 min at 20°C–22°C in a flow hood.\nWash gel 3 times with 100% EtOH.\nDry gel for 15 min at 80°C.\nAdd 2 mL of 200 nm carboxylated fluorescent beads to gel.\nTo prepare the carboxylated fluorescent beads, dilute beads 1:2000 in dH2O.\nSonicate mixture for 10 min.\nPass mixture through a 0.45 μm filter to prevent clumping of the beads.\nIncubate gel for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash gel 3 times with dH2O.\nDry gel for 15 min at 80°C.\nPassivate gel with 2 mL 100 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) in dH2O for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash gel 3 times with dH2O.\nDry gel for 15 min at 80°C.\nGel is ready for E-cadherin coating.",
    "Gel can be stored at 4°C in the dark for up to 4 weeks. Carefully wrap the Eppendorf chamber in parafilm, to prevent gel from drying out.\nCoating with recombinant hE-cadherin/Fc\nTiming: 2 days\nE-cadherin-coated substrates can be generated on top of glass coverslips or PDMS gels. The steps below apply to both unless indicated otherwise. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for schematic representation of E-cadherin-coated substrate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3038-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. E-cadherin-coated substrate\nSchematic representation of a MCF7 cell spread on E-cadherin ecto-domain ligands.\nPrepare glass coverslips as indicated in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” or PDMS gels as indicated above.\nAdd 1 mL 25 μg/mL Protein A in PBS to coverslips.\nCritical: Make sure coverslips do not fall dry after addition of Protein A.\nIncubate coverslips for 3 h at 20°C–22°C.\nWash coverslips 3 times with PBS.\nGently aspirate PBS and add new PBS at the same time, to prevent coverslips from falling dry.\nAdd 30 μL 25 μg/mL hE-cadherin/Fc in PBS to coverslips.\nFor PDMS gels add 200 μL.\nIncubate coverslips 16–20 h at 4°C.\nWash coverslips 3 times with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL 1% BSA in PBS to coverslips.\nIncubate coverslips for 45 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash coverslips 3 times with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL movie media to coverslips.\nE-cadherin-coated coverslips are ready for spreading assay.\nIt is recommended to directly use the E-cadherin-coated substrate in a spreading assay. If required, substrates can be stored in the dark for up to 1 week.\nEpithelial cell spreading assay on E-cadherin-coated substrates\nTiming: 3 h\nEpithelial cells can be seeded on top of E-cadherin-coated glass coverslips or PDMS gels. The steps below apply to both. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for microscopy images of LifeAct-GFP expressing MCF7 cells seeded on top of E-cadherin-coated glass coverslips and PDMS gels.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3038-Fig2.jpg",
