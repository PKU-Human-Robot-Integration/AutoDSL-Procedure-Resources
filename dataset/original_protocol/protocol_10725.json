    "In this section, we introduce the experimental protocols for our cell-phone based wide-field fluorescence microscopy13 and opto-fluidic imaging cytometry platform14. We will use fluorescent beads and fluorescently labeled white blood cells to test these imaging platforms.\nA. Preparation of Cell-phone Based Wide-field Fluorescent Microscope and Opto-fluidic Imaging Flow Cytometer\nThe cell-phone based wide-field fluorescent microscope or flow cytometer consists of two major parts: a camera phone and a compact opto-fluidic add-on attachment.\n1. The Camera Phone\nWhile the presented techniques are applicable to almost any camera phone, we have chosen Sony Erickson Aino as the base for these devices. This cell-phone has an ~ 8 MegaPixel RGB CMOS sensor installed on it and a built-in lens that has a focal length (f1) of ~ 4.65 mm.\n2. Opto-fluidic Attachment for Wide-field Fluorescent Microscopy\nThe optical attachment is designed by Autodesk and is printed by a Dimension Elite 3-D printer using ABSplus thermoplastic material. In this printing process, model and support materials are heated in an extrusion head within the printer and are deposited layer by layer on a modeling base. When this step is completed, the supporting material can be dissolved, leaving a robust 3D model of the desired prototype Our optical attachment design consists of LEDs (center wavelength at ~ 470 nm, Digikey), a plastic filter (#NT54-46, Edmund Optics), a sample tray, and a plano-convex lens f2=15 mm (# NT45-302, Edmund Optics). All the LEDs and plastic filters can be easily changed based on the fluorophores' spectra. The steps for assembling this opto-fluidic attachment include:\nPlace the lens into the attachment within its specific lens holder position.\nPlace the plastic filter onto the filter tray and slide it into the attachment; or tape the plastic filter in front of the cell-phone camera lens.",
    "Insert the LED tray into the attachment.\nPlace the sample glass slides into the sample tray. Slide the sample tray into the attachment. Face the LEDs toward the sample.\nClip the attachment onto the cell-phone, such that the extra lens is directly in touch with the cell-phone camera lens.\nUse the switch on the attachment to turn on the LEDs.\nImage the sample of interest with the cell-phone camera unit using its \"night mode\".\n3. Opto-fluidic Attachment for Fluorescent Imaging Cytometry\nWhen there is a need to screen large volumes of liquid samples for the detection of rare events, optofluidic flow cytometry device could be preferred. We can modify our wide-field fluorescent microscope design and convert it into a flow cytometer, where a PDMS based microfluidic channel is used to continually deliver the liquid sample through the imaging volume. The optical attachment is also designed by Autodesk and printed by Dimension Elite 3-D printer. It also consists of LEDs (center wavelength at ~ 470 nm, Digikey), a plastic filter (#NT54-46, Edmund Optics), a sample tray, and an aspherical lens (f = 4.5 mm) (product # C230TME-A; Thorlab). The steps for assembling this opto-fluidic attachment include:\nPlace the aspherical lens into the attachment.\nPlace the plastic filter onto the filter tray and slide it into the attachment; or tape the plastic filter in front of the cellphone camera lens.\nSlide the microfluidic channel into the same opto-fluidic attachment.\nClip the attachment onto the cell-phone such that the extra lens is directly in touch with the cell-phone camera lens.\nUse the switch on the attachment to turn on the LEDs.\nConnect the microfluidic channel to the syringe pump and deliver the liquid sample into the microfluidic device at a constant flow rate.",
    "Capture a movie of the fluorescent cells/particles flowing through the microfluidic channel using the video mode of the cell-phone camera.\nB. Sample Preparation\n4. Preparation of Fluorescent Micro-particle Samples\nFluorescent beads with 10 μm diameter (red beads: product #F8834 excitation/emission 580nm/605nm; green beads: product #F8836: excitation/emission 505nm/515nm) are purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).\nMix 10 μl of green fluorescent beads, 10 μl of red fluorescent beads with 40 μl of DI water.\nPlace10 μl of this bead mixture on a glass slide using a micropipette and put another glass slide on the top of it to make a sandwich structure.\nInsert this sandwich structure into the sample tray and slide it into the cell-phone attachment.\n5. Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled White Blood Cells\nTake SYTO16 nucleic acid fluorescent labeling kit (#S7578, Life Technology) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) out from the refrigerator and bring them to room temperature.\nTransfer 200 μl whole blood sample from EDTA blood collection tube to 1.5 ml polystyrene tube (# 05-408-129, Fisher Scientific).\nAdd 1 ml red blood cell lysing buffer (# R7757, Sigma-Aldrich) to the 200 μl whole blood sample and mix thoroughly.\nAfter 5 min, centrifuge the lysed blood sample and remove the supernatant solution.\nResuspend the white blood cell pellet into 200 μl PBS buffer and gently mix them.\nAdd 5 μl 1 mM SYTO16 solution to the white blood cell sample. Wrap the sample with aluminum foil and incubate in dark environment for ~ 30 min.\nCentrifuge the sample again. Supernatant is removed and the labeled white blood cell pellet is re-suspended into PBS buffer.\nPlace 5-10 μl labeled white blood cell liquid sample to a cover slip, and place a second cover slip on the top of the sample.",
    "Insert the sandwiched sample slide into the sample tray and image it using the cell-phone fluorescent microscope.\nAlternatively\nContinually deliver the fluorescently labeled white blood cells through a microfluidic channel using an automated syringe pump, while also capturing a fluorescent microscopic movie of the flowing cells using the cell-phone camera in video mode. We should also emphasize that a portable battery powered syringe pump or even gravity force can be utilized to drive the flow through the microfluidic channel.\nSubscription Required.
