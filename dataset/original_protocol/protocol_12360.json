    "1. Preparation of Micro-scalpel for Neural Tube Ablations\nShape a micro-scalpel from a commercially available steel sewing needle.\n\t\nFirst flatten the needle on both sides using a grinding wheel mounted on a powered bench grinder.\nStart shaping the scalpel, first on a coarse grade Arkansas stone using a controlled circular motion, in alternate directions, on both sides of the needle.\nCarry on the same sharpening movements on an extra fine grade Arkansas stone to shape an ultra fine micro-scalpel, with a well defined cutting edge (Figure 1A, B).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatives to the micro-scalpel could be electrolitically sharpened needles, commercially available tungsten needles, or pulled glass needles.\n2. Incubate Wild Type and GFP Eggs to the Desired Stage\nStore fertilized chicken eggs and transgenic GFP chicken eggs in a cooled incubator at 14 - 15 °C prior to incubation as development is halted at this temperature. Store eggs for a few days, up to one week.\nTo commence development, place wild type and GFP eggs on a tray horizontally and incubate simultaneously in a humidified (58 - 60%) incubator at 37.5 ºC, so that embryos are at matching stages for neural tube grafting.\nTo obtain embryos at the 10 - 12 somite stage of development for carrying out vagal neural tube grafting, incubate eggs for 1.5 days (33 - 38 hrs) and stage embryos according to the development tables of Hamburger and Hamilton21.\n3. Prepare Eggs for Windowing and Grafting\nMove one egg at a time to a custom-made egg holder for windowing. Make a small hole in the egg shell by repeatedly tapping, with straight scissors, on the upper surface of the pointed end of the egg.",
    "Remove 2 - 3 ml of albumin from the egg with an 18½ G hypodermic needle and 5 ml syringe. Removing the albumin lowers the yolk within the egg and facilitates subsequent windowing without causing any damage to the embryo.\n\t\nDiscard the albumin. Seal the hole with a small strip of clear tape cut to size with fine scissors.\nUsing curved scissors, tap another hole in the upper surface of the egg shell. Insert the tip of the scissors into the hole and, keeping the scissors parallel to the bench, work in a circular motion to cut a ~2 cm diameter window on top of the shell.\n\t\nKeep the scissors in a stationary position and rotate the egg. Discard the removed disk of egg shell. At E1.5, the embryo is recognizable as a darker yellow disk on top of the yolk.\nRemove any shell debris that has fallen within the egg using tweezers. Discard any unfertilized eggs (identified by a small white spot on top on the otherwise light yellow yolk).\n4. Prepare the Host Embryo to Receive Grafted Tissue\nAdjust the stereo-microscope to eye level and optimize the orientation of gooseneck light source to adequately illuminate the embryo without causing reflections.\nTo visualize the embryo proper, inject a small amount of Indian ink under the center of the darker yellow disk, using a mouth tube and a pulled glass micro-pipette (Figure 1C, Oii).\n\t\nPrepare the ink 50:50 with PBS containing Penicillin/Streptomycin at 100 μg/ml final concentration. Insert the micro-pipette through the yolk membrane outside the perimeter of the blastoderm then carefully angle its tip directly beneath the embryo.",
    "Deliver ink underneath the embryo by blowing on the mouth tube. If mouth pipetting is not permitted, use a 1 ml syringe instead. Be careful not to introduce any air bubbles underneath the embryo, which can lead to contamination, then carefully remove the glass micro-pipette. This is a delicate step that can lead to the death of the embryo if not done with precision.\nStage the embryo by reference to Hamburger and Hamilton21 and record the stage in a lab book.\nUsing a custom made micro-scalpel (or a fine tungsten needle) mounted on a needle holder, make a very small gash in the vitelline membrane, next to the area where the micro-surgery will be performed.\n\t\nCarefully apply 2 - 3 drops of PBS over the membrane tear (using a glass micro-pipette and the mouth tube) to create space between the embryo and the membrane. Cut a larger window in the membrane to expose the entire region where the micro-surgery will take place.\nRemove the neural tube region of interest using the micro-scalpel, starting with rostral and caudal transverse incisions across the entire dorsal neural tube (at the level of somite 1 to 7 in the video).\n\t\nCut bilaterally between the neural tube and the somites to separate the neural tube from surrounding tissues, without damaging the somites.\nVery gently separate the neural tube from the underlying notochord, which should remain intact. Note that successful neural tube excision will leave all surrounding tissues perfectly intact (Figure 2).\nRemove the excised neural tube by aspirating it into a glass micro-pipette, then discard.\nRecord the level of neural tube ablation in a lab book. The host embryo is now ready to receive the donor neural tube.\n5. Prepare the Donor Graft Tissue",
    "Select a windowed, stage-matched GFP embryo by viewing under a fluorescent stereo-microscope with FITC filter. The GFP fluorescence makes it very easy to visualize the somites and stage the embryo.\nOnce a stage-matched embryo has been identified, remove the embryo from the egg by making 4 incisions, with Pascheff-Wolff spring scissors (Figure 1C, l) in a rectangle shape around the embryo then gently pick it up with an embryo spoon.\nPlace the embryo in a square watch glass with a sylgard polymer base. Gently shake the embryo with Dumont #5 tweezers to remove any attached yolk. Remove the vitelline membrane and pin the embryo onto the polymer base using stainless minutien pins (Figure 1C).\nUsing the Spring Scissors, make 4 incisions in a rectangular shape around the neural tube and surrounding somites, in the same region that has been removed from the host embryo.\nUsing a plastic transfer pipette, transfer the neural tube and somite tissues from the donor GFP embryo into a watch glass containing 0.2% pancreatin in Pen/Strep PBS.\nAllow enzymatic digestion to proceed for 10 min at RT to help separate the tissues. After incubation in enzyme, use stainless minutien pins mounted on a handle to manually separate the neural tube from all adjacent tissues.\nUsing a glass micro-pipette, transfer the dissociated neural tube to another watch glass containing DMEM + 10% serum (e.g., goat, horse or fetal calf) on ice, to rinse the excess pancreatin and stop enzymatic digestion. After 5 min, the dissected neural tube is ready to be grafted orthotopically into the chick host (Figure 2 and S1).\n6. Graft the Tissue",
    "Using a glass micro-pipette, carefully transfer the dissected neural tube from the watch glass to the host embryo. Position the neural tube in the correct anterior-posterior orientation and gently push the explant adjacent to the excised region of the chick host using the micro-scalpel. Leave a small fragment of ectoderm attached to, or by cutting a small nick in, the dorsal surface to identify the orientation of the neural tube.\n\t\nIf necessary, use the micro-scalpel to trim the explant to the exact size of the excised region.\nGently guide the neural tube into the ablated region and position it such that the dorsal side is correctly orientated. Use a glass micro-pipette, mounted to a mouth tube, to remove PBS and/or fluid surrounding the graft. This helps the donor and host tissues to adhere and the graft to become established.\nSeal the entire window with 24 mm wide clear tape to prevent dehydration and contamination.\nLabel the chimeric embryo by marking with a pencil on the eggshell and record its number in the lab book. Return the egg to the incubator for further development.\n7. Inject DiI into Blood Vessels of Host Embryo\nAt the desired experimental time point (here, 3 - 10 days later), retrieve the chimeric embryo from the incubator and remove the clear tape using straight scissors to gain access to the embryo within the egg.\nIf necessary, enlarge the window in the shell using the scissors. Be careful not to damage the chorioallantoic membrane if it is attached to the shell, which would result in hemorrhage and jeopardize the blood vessel labeling.\nChoose an accessible vein on the yolk making sure the blood flow is directed towards the embryo. Choose a branching point of one of the vitelline veins (Figure 3B, C).",
    "NOTE: At E6.5 - E7.5, the chorioallantoic membrane may need to be gently moved aside with tweezers to access the yolk veins. After E8.5, the only option is to inject into one of the chorioallantoic membrane veins since, by this stage, the chorioallantoic membrane fully covers the embryo.\nRemove the vitelline membrane above the chosen injection point using two Dumont #5 tweezers by tearing in opposite directions.\nBreak a pulled glass needle using a Dumont #5 and adjust its diameter to the approximate size of the vein prior to loading with CellTracker CM-DiI. Make the DiI stock solution at 40 µg/µl in DMSO and store at -20 °C. Prepare the working solution in 0.3 M sucrose/PBS at a concentration of 4 µg/µl.\n\t\nAspirate between 5 - 10 µl of DiI in 0.3 M sucrose/PBS into the needle using suction with a mouth tube. Older embryos might require up to 25 µl or more. From E8.5, embryos have larger, more muscular veins, which may need to be held in position with a Dumont #5 before stabbing with the DiI-loaded glass needle.\nSwiftly insert the needle into the vein and blow steadily with the mouth tube to allow the DiI to join the blood flow slowly without forming a clot. Alternatively, use a pressure injector for DiI delivery.\n8. Harvest Embryos for Sectioning or Wholemount Examination\nTo retain as much DiI within the embryo as possible, harvest the embryo immediately after the injection by scooping it onto a perforated spoon and cutting the blood vessels and connective tissues with a pair of straight scissors, to free the embryo from the yolk.",
    "Remove any loose membranes and dissect out the organs of interest (i.e., the lungs and digestive tract in this tutorial), taking great care not to compress the tissue, which creates diffusion of the DiI. Immediately fix the tissues by immersion in 4% PFA for 1 - 2 hrs at RT.\nRinse the tissue for 5 min in PBS, then 15 min in PBS containing 5 μg/ml DAPI. Mount the samples on a bridged microscope slide for whole mount examination or embed them for cryo-sectioning."
