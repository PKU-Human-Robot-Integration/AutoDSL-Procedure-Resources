    "All components of this study were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, and with the approval of the University of Cambridge Ethical Review Panel.\n1. Animal Preparation\nInduce infarcts with a surgical intervention7,8. For measuring at the acute stage, perform imaging 24 hr after intervention.\nPrepare a thin syringe tubing for drug delivery with a 25 G needle at one extremity and a syringe with a 25 G needle at the other end. The length of the line should be enough to allow the injection from outside the magnet’s bore (approximately 1.5 m).\nPrepare a solution diluting Gadovist in saline. Load a syringe with the right amount of solution to achieve 3 mmol/kg adjusted for mouse bodyweight. Keep the injection volume between 50-100 µl.\nPrefill the line with the Gadovist solution. To avoid blood clotting, fill the extremity of the line close to the cannula with heparin saline.\nPlace the mouse in the induction box for anesthesia with 3% isoflurane in O2 1 L/min for 3-5 min as necessary. Correct anesthesia depth can be identified with the slowing breath rate, which should decrease to less than 70 bpm.\nCannulate the tail vein using the line previously prepared, use surgical tape to keep the needle in place during the procedure.\n2. Animal Positioning and Monitoring\nPlace the mouse on the MRI bed, delivering 1-2% isoflurane in 1 L/min O2 for anesthesia maintenance as required. Maintain respiration rates between 20-70 bpm.\nEnsure the center of the MRI coil is located over the mouse heart position.\nMonitor respiration by placing a respiratory pillow sensor slightly below the diaphragm. Use a rectal thermometer with a prelubricated cover slip to monitor core temperature. Ensure that temperature is kept constant during the scans at 37±2 °C.",
    "For ECG monitoring, place three electrodes on the anterior paws and on the left rear paw, making sure that the palm of the toe is completely open. Choose the pair of electrodes achieving the best signal quality to derive the ECG. Twist the ECG cables together, to insure that they do not form resonant circuits at the MRI resonant frequency, which would severely corrupt the ECG signal when running pulse sequences.\nEnsure the electrodes are firmly attached to the bed using tape. The electrodes and the nose cone will hold the animal in place during the whole procedure.\nPosition a water-heated blanket over the mouse, encapsulating the monitoring and coil leads to maintain body temperature.\nAlign the laser of the bed with the heart position; use the anterior toes line as a landmark. Position this in the magnet isocenter using an automatic bed.\nRun the standard adjustments for the MRI system.\nSet the monitoring equipment to detect the R-wave in the ECG. Adjust the thresholds for each mouse and within imaging sessions so that there is reliable triggering.\n3. MRI\nAcquire a pilot image to plan the multiplanar pilot images.\nIdentify the heart in the image, most easily by its flow artifacts. If the images show the mouse is not well centered in the coil or the isocenter, retract the bed and repeat positioning.\nAcquire a fast gradient echo (GE) image with five slices per orientation and a 3 cm field of view (FOV) with ECG gating turned on.\nRun an ungated 3D scan centered on the heart for PET coregistration (see Table 1 for scan parameters). While this scan is running, plan the successive scans.",
    "Plan a four chamber (4 ch) view scan (see Table 1 for scan parameters). This should cut through the apex and the tricuspid and mitral valves, showing all 4 chambers.\nPlan a two chamber (2 ch) view (see Table 1 for scan parameters). It should cut through the apex and the tricuspid valve, showing the left atrium and ventricle.\nCrosscheck the geometry of the two long-axis views. If the slice planning is sub-optimal, repeat the scan.\nPlan a stack of short axis slices (see Table 1 for scan parameters) orthogonal to both the 4 ch and to the 2 ch view. Cover the whole heart, starting from the first apical slice without blood pool until the first basal slice without any RV. Slices should be equally spaced with no gaps.\n4. Late Gadolinium Enhancement\nIncrease blank time for gating to acquire every other heart beat (TR = 550-750 msec). A delay must be applied such that acquisition is performed at the end-diastolic phase of the ECG.\nPerform a low-resolution version of the LGE sequence (see Table 1 for scan parameters) before the injection in order to check that the gating is correct and no flow artifacts are present. If flow artifacts are present in the diastolic phase, increasing the delay slightly (i.e. imaging at the very early stage of systole) will get rid of them.\nPerform the injection of the Gadovist solution slowly and steadily over 15 sec.\nInitiate LGE imaging (see Table 1 for scan parameters) after the injection. Good contrast is achieved when imaging within the first 15 min.\n5. PET Imaging\nTransfer the MRI bed to the PET scanner leaving the receiver in place and firmly anchor it to the PET bed support. Connect the anesthetic and monitoring equipment.",
    "Position the heart in the center of the PET field of view moving the bed only axially.\nAcquire a single-pass transmission scan with a germanium source.\nExtract 10-30 Mbq of radioactively labeled FDG from its container with a syringe. Take necessary care with radioactive material. Measure the activity with a well counter. A good injection volume for mice ranges between 50-100 µl, if the volume is too small, dilute the solution with saline.\nStart the emission scan, set to acquire list-mode gated PET for 45 min. Contemporaneously, inject the tracer slowly and steadily over 15 sec. Flush the line with enough saline to deliver the whole of the radioactive tracer.\nFor animal health, do not to exceed 300 µl with the three injections (i.e. Gadovist, FDG, flush).\nPlace the syringe back in the well counter to measure the residual activity.\nFollow local rules throughout for handling radioactive material.\n6. MRI Segmentation\nLoad the Cine-MRI images in Segment v1.9 9.\nRun the automatic tools for segmentation. Starting from a point inside the ventricle, these will inflate the estimated ventricle walls until the best match is found.\nDelineate the LV and the RV manually at end systole (ES) and end diastole (ED), defined respectively as the frames with the maximal and with the minimal global LV volume. Exclude the papillary muscles and trabeculations throughout. Do not adjust image contrast, as inconsistency in the contrast leads to a different interpretation of partial volume effects.\nDelineate manually the epicardium at ES and ED for LV mass calculations, as shown in Figure 6. The cardiac muscle is incompressible, so the LV mass must be consistent in ES and ED. If the difference is more than 5% operator error is likely and these should be reviewed.",
    "At the base of the ventricles, use a straight line to discriminate ventricles from atria as shown in Figure 6, identifying the angle of the slice with the help of the long-axis views.\nCross-check the segmentation on the long-axis views.\nDelineate the scar area on the LGE images. Divide the scar volume by the LV mass derived in the cine imaging to obtain the infarct as a percentage of the LV.\n7. PET Analysis and Coregistration with MRI\nReconstruct the PET images using a 3D filtered backprojection algorithm and export data to Nifti format (http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/) showing standard uptake values.\nTransform all the PET images using the fixed transformation matrix between the PET and the MRI system. If the matrix is not known, fill a geometrical phantom with radioactive material and perform an MRI, then move the bed to the PET and perform an emission scan. The matrix obtained to transform the PET to the MRI image is the standard matrix to go from the PET to the MRI system.\nRegister the average PET image to the 3D MRI using SPM-mouse bulk coregistration tool10.\nStack the slices from Cine-MRI to obtain a 3D reconstruction, interpolate to obtain 0.3 mm isotropic resolution. Register the end-diastolic PET volume to the end-diastolic MRI volume using SPM-Mouse coregistration tools. Use the same matrix for all the other heart phases.\nTo evaluate PET infarct size, choose 50% of the maximum intensity in the heart to discriminate between infarcted and noninfarcted voxels. Express infarcted voxels as a percentage of the LV.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
