    "All animal procedures were approved and carried out in accordance with guidelines of the Veterinary Department of the Canton Basel-Stadt.\n1. Hardware and Software Setup\nTwo-photon scanning microscope setup:\n\t\nUse a pulsed infrared laser as an illumination source (pulse width <120 fsec).\nUse a scan head composed of an 8 or 12 kHz resonant scanner and a standard galvanometer. Note: This enables frame rates of 40 or 60 Hz at 750 x 400 pixels. A high frame rate is critical for minimizing brain motion induced image distortion. Moreover, fast resonant scanning results in a higher signal yield and reduces photobleaching16 and phototoxicity.\nUse a Piezo-electric high speed z-stepper to sequentially acquire time interleaved images at multiple depths. Note: This is optional and used to increase data yield at the expense of frame rate.\nUse a mechanical blanker to reduce laser exposure to the tissue. Adjust the width of the blanker depending on the amplitude of the resonant scanner. Note: Due to the sinusoidal nature of the scan path of a resonant scanner, the laser beam moves comparably slow at the scan turnaround points. To prevent damage of the tissue at these turnaround points where laser exposure is greatest, a mechanical blanker is introduced into the focal plane between the scan and tube lenses that stops the laser beam. \nFor data acquisition use a high speed digitizer (800 MHz) in combination with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Note: The FPGA high-pass filters and bins the PMT signal into pixels. The combination of the high-pass filter on the FPGA and the effective low-pass filter on the PMT amplifier result in a band-pass filter centered roughly around the repetition rate of the laser (80 MHz). Sample FPGA code is provided as a supplement.",
    "Air-supported treadmill setup based on the design of Dombeck and colleagues2\nConnect the ball holder to an air supply line using an air supply tube of at least 10 mm inner diameter. Maximize the cross section of the ball holder air supply inlet and place ample amount of tubing between the main air supply and the ball holder. Note: Increased cross section and increased length of the air supply tubing reduces noise generation.\nPlace a polystyrene foam ball (20 cm diameter) in a custom-designed and 3D-printed ball holder.\nIf the behavioral paradigm only requires forward (and backward) locomotion, restrict movement of the ball to the horizontal (pitch) axis by inserting a pin (e.g. a 19 G hypodermic needle) on the side of the ball. Note: Typically animals adapt to the setup much quicker in this reduced rotation paradigm.\nTrack movement of the ball using one or two optical computer mice to detect motion around two or all three axes, respectively. Note: The computer mice should ideally operate with an infrared diode for least interference with the imaging.\nVirtual reality environment setup\n\t\nPrepare the virtual reality environment. Note: A sample environment based on Panda3D, a freely available game engine, is provided as a supplement. The objects of the virtual environment are generated using Wings3D, an open source 3D modeler. The sample program reads position information on a data acquisition card and translates this into movement in the virtual environment. The code also performs the nonlinear transformation necessary for the environment to be projected onto a toroidal screen. The detailed construction of the toroidal screen has been described elsewhere14,17.",
    "Use LED projectors or LED backlit computer screens for displaying the virtual environment. Integrate a gating circuit for fast flickering of the LEDs during imaging. Note: An inherent problem in two-photon imaging during visual stimulation is light leak originating from the visual stimulation system, which can be reduced by shielding the objective. However, light leak from the visual stimulation system can be fully abolished by synchronizing the light output of the projector to the turnaround points of the resonant scanner (when data are not acquired), as is done with LED arenas used for visual stimulation during imaging in Drosophila18. This results in an effective high speed alternation of visual stimulation and data acquisition (see Figure 2). The flickering frequency (24 kHz) is orders of magnitude above the flicker fusion threshold, above which flickering is no longer perceived by the animal. The electronic circuit diagram of this modification to a commercial LED projector is shown in Figure 3.\nPupil tracking\n\t\nUse a CMOS based video camera (30 fps) for pupil position tracking. Make sure that the camera does not contain an infrared blocking filter. Note: The pupil is visible at high contrast during recordings due to stray light from the two-photon excitation laser exiting through the eye. Pupil position and diameter is extracted in real-time using custom-programmed software based on the design of Sakatani and Isa19. \n2. Injection of Genetic Calcium Indicator and Window Implant\nThe injection of a calcium indicator20 and the implantation of the cranial window21 are performed as previously described with the following additions:",
    "Inject the virus into the region of interest using a glass injection pipette backfilled with virus solution and connected to a pressure injection system. Adjust the pressure depending on the pipette inner-diameter, typically approx. 70-140 mbar, to inject approximately 100 nl of virus solution over the course of 1-2 min. Low volume injection pulses delivered at low frequency (0.05 sec pulses at 2 Hz) should be used in order to prevent overflow of the virus along the pipette during injection. Note: In order to monitor the injection volume, the pipette can be marked at small, evenly spaced lengths (e.g. 0.5 mm) under a stereo microscope. Displacement of the meniscus between the markings can then be used to estimate the injected volume.\nSeveral weeks post injection this should result in a bolus of densely labeled cells with a diameter of approximately 500 µm.  Efficacy of GECI expression in the region of interest depends on the choice of GECI and promoter combination, as well as the infectious titer and serotype of the recombinant AAV used. Note: As a representative example, injection of AAV2/1-EF1α-GCaMP5 with a viral titer of 8 x 1012 GC/ml into primary visual cortex of a mouse results in satisfactory expression at approximately two weeks post injection (Figure 1).",
    "The head bar should not obstruct the visual field of the mouse, but should be rigid enough to allow for stable imaging during behavior. This typically requires two points of attachment on either side of the head bar (see Figure 1). To firmly attach the head bar to the skull, make sure to maximize and dry the area of exposed skull where the head bar will be attached. Additionally, using a scalpel or a syringe, scratch the skull to create superficial grooves thereby increasing the surface area for gluing. Cover the bone with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive before attaching the head bar with dental cement.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nTwo to three weeks following virus injection, check the cranial window implant for clarity and expression under epifluorescence illumination. Clearly visible and sharply defined boundaries of superficial blood vessels are a good indication that the window implant is suitable for imaging (see Figure 1).\nMeasure and adjust laser power to a value below 50 mW at the sample.\nTurn on the airflow to the spherical treadmill.\nFor head fixation under the microscope, briefly anesthetize the animal with isoflurane to reduce stress. Place the animal into an isoflurane anesthesia container and wait until the animal stops moving (approximately 10 sec). Remove the animal and immediately head fix it under the microscope.\nPosition the visual display system as close as possible to the animal to still allow for access to the animal. The less visual contact the animal has with the experimenter, the less stressed the animal will be during the initial phase of the experiment.\nMake sure the cranial window implant is free of dust and dirt. Clean with water if necessary.",
    "Apply clear ultrasound gel as immersion medium between the cranial window and water-immersion objective. This solves problems of slow image degradation due to water evaporation or leakage and alleviates the need to mount a cone on the head bar to hold water. Note: Centrifuge the gel before usage to remove all air bubbles, and take care not to create any air bubbles during application of the gel. Air bubbles can severely degrade image quality.\nWrap a piece of black tape around the objective and head bar for light shielding.\nMove the virtual environment arena to its final position and adjust the video camera for pupil tracking.\nSet the laser blanker to match the scan amplitude used during the experiment.\nStart recording data.\nSubscription Required.
