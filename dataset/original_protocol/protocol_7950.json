    "NOTE: This protocol spans 2 days with a minimum period of 4-5 days for viral transduction between experimental days (Figure 1A). Animal experiments are performed in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines for Use of Animals in Research and Laboratory Animal Care under protocols approved by the Laboratory of Animal Services Animal Use and Care Committee at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada).\n1. Preparations for the neonatal AAV injections and imaging experiments\nSelect a Cre mouse line to label the retinal cell populations of interest. Confirm Cre recombinase expression at the time of AAV injections by crossing to a Cre transgenic reporter or through immunostaining with a Cre antibody.\nBreed transgenic Cre mice (8-16 weeks old) to generate Cre-positive neonatal animals.\n\tNOTE: For this demonstration, ChAT-IRES-Cre knock-in mice were used to target the cholinergic Starburst amacrine cells.\nObtain recombinase-dependent AAV virus encoding fluorescent protein(s). For optimal labeling of fine processes, select vectors that express modified XFPs targeting the plasma membrane.\n\tNOTE: This study used the Brainbow virus (BBV), AAV-EF1a-BbTagBY and AAV9-EF1a-BbChT (see Table of Materials), which provide the option for multicolour labeling (Figure 1B). Farnesylated enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) and monomeric Cherry (mCherry) expression produced the strongest fluorescent signals for live imaging. A single BBV can be used to image individual arbors, while co-injection of BBVs can be used to label more cells or neighboring arbors with distinct fluorophores. If using multiple fluorescent proteins, ensure minimal emission spectrum overlap (Figure 1C). Microscope acquisition parameters must be adjusted to capture distinct XFP signals.\nPrepare ∼3-5 µL aliquots of AAVs in individual low-binding tubes for single-use stocks to avoid freeze/thaw cycles. Store at -80 °C.\nPrepare borosilicate glass micropipettes with very fine tips using a micropipette puller.",
    "NOTE: Puller settings vary depending on filament and puller being used; see Figure 2A for final tip size and shape. Typical droplet diameters are 600 µm.\nObtain a microinjection system and associated tubing. Connect the microinjector to a pressurized air port.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62308/62308fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Experimental overview. (A) This protocol spans 2 days of experiments with a minimum of 4-5-day infection period between experimental days. Intraocular injections are performed on neonatal mice no older than postnatal day 3. Retinas are then dissected, flat-mounted, and live-imaged to capture the desired developmental window. Labelled cells can be imaged any time after the required 4-5 days needed for viral expression, as there are no apparent effects of prolonged AAV expression on dendrite morphology. (B) Cre-dependent Brainbow AAV vectors (BBV) are injected into animals expressing Cre31. In this study, ChAT-Cre knock-in mice were used to drive Cre recombination in starburst amacrine cells. The two BBVs encode modified eYFP or tagBFP, or mCherry and mTFP, which terminate in a CAAX motif that is sequentially farnesylated for membrane localization. Lox sites are depicted with triangles. The vectors express either farnesylated XFPs in a stochastic and combinatorial manner dependent on Cre recombination. The EF1α promoter includes regulatory elements from the elongation factor 1α gene. W represents elements from the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element, and pA indicates the polyadenylation sequence. (C) The excitation and emission spectra of mCherry and eYFP, the BBV fluorophores imaged in this study. When live-imaging multiple fluorescent proteins, the detection parameters must be arranged to adequately separate emission spectra into distinct channels. Abbreviations: AAV = adeno-associated virus; BBV = Brainbow AAV; ChAT = choline acetyltransferase; iRES = internal ribosome entry site; eYFP = enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; iTR = inverted terminal repeat; tagBP = Tag-blue fluorescent protein; mCherry = monomeric Cherry; mTFP = teal fluorescent protein; XFP = any fluorescent protein; EF1α= elongation factor 1 alpha.

    "Thaw an AAV aliquot on ice. Prepare a ~1:4 AAV dilution using sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline. Prepare ~0.5 µL of AAV dilution per animal (~0.25 µL per eye) in case the micropipette breaks, and a new pipette needs to be filled. Store the remaining undiluted AAV at 4 °C, and use within 2 weeks.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, the supplier AAV concentration was ~1-2 × 1013 genome content (GC)/mL and diluted to a final concentration of 4 × 1012 GC/mL. Optimize the viral concentration to obtain the desired labeling density.\nTo visualize the injections, add approximately 1 µL of 0.02% Fast Green FCF dye solution for every 15 µL of AAV dilution to color the solution blue.\nTransfer a mouse cage with dam and newborn litter (postnatal day (P) 0.5-3) to a procedure room with microinjection equipment. Keep the animals in the same cage with nests and bedding to minimize maternal stress and rejection of pups.\nSterilize the injection area with 70% ethanol, and place sterile diaper pads on bench surfaces. Prepare a warm platform (e.g., a heating pad) for recovery from hypothermia-induced anesthesia.\nBackfill the micropipette with the AAV dilution using a microsyringe. Under a stereomicroscope, break the micropipette tip with a 30 G needle to unseal the tip.\n\tNOTE: Figure 2A shows the backfilled tip-both sealed (top) and unsealed (middle).\nAnesthetize neonatal mice by hypothermia by placing 1-2 animals on ice. Place animals onto a latex glove to protect skin from direct contact with ice. Once the animal no longer moves in response to paw pinch (~2 min), place the animal under a stereomicroscope. If desired, tattoo paw pads with tattoo ink and 30 G needle, and collect tail clippings for DNA isolationto identify animals by genotyping.",
    "NOTE: Appropriate monitoring of depth of anesthesia must occur throughout the procedure.\nSwab the skin overlying the eyes with 70% ethanol. Use a 30 G needle to open the fused eyelid (Figure 2B). Apply light pressure with the fingers to open the eye, and poke a small hole through the cornea at the cornea-sclera junction (Figure 2C).\nInsert the glass micropipette into the hole, and press the microinjector foot pedal 2-4 times to inject the AAV into the intravitreal space. Slowly remove the micropipette, and confirm AAV injection by visualizing blue dye through the pupil (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: With an ejection pressure of 6-8 psi and pulse time of 600-800 ms, a 600 µm diameter droplet is ejected (Figure 2A, bottom). Approximately 0.23-0.45 µL of AAV solution is injected per eye. Blue solution outside the eye indicates that the AAV was not injected into the eye. Blue solution leaking from the injection site indicates that the AAV may have leaked out, reducing transfection efficiency.\nGently press the eyelids together to re-seal, and place the pup onto a heated pad. Once the animals recover a pinkish color and are responsive, gently transfer them back to the housing cage.\n\tNOTE: Ensure appropriate precautions are taken to avoid too rapid re-warming of the pups.\nRepeat the injection procedure for the remaining animals in the litter. Allow a minimum of 4-5 days for viral transduction before imaging the retina.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62308/62308fig02v2.jpg",

Retinal dissections for imaging experiment\nPrepare retinal aCSF (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 2.5 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 11 mM glucose, and 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES free acid)35. If desired, prepare and freeze 10x solution; thaw and dilute to 1x as needed.\nOxygenate the retinal aCSF by bubbling with carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2) for a minimum of 15 min. Adjust the pH to 7.4. Keep in a sealed container until use to ensure that the aCSF remains oxygenated.",
    "NOTE: Retinas require a high concentration of O2. It is important to keep aCSF oxygenated throughout the experiment.\nEmbed a 60 mm diameter Petri dish into an ice tray (fashion an ice tray out of lab plastic, e.g., a pipette box lid), and place it under a stereomicroscope. Fill the Petri dish with oxygenated retinal aCSF.\nEuthanize mice P9 and younger by decapitation. Euthanize mice P10 and older by isoflurane induction, or an alternate method approved under the animal protocol, followed by decapitation.\nIf the eyelids are sealed, cut the eyelid flap to expose the eye. Use forceps to enucleate the eyes, and transfer them into the cold retinal aCSF from step 3.3.\nTo dissect the retinal cup, under a stereomicroscope (magnification 25x), stabilize the eye by clasping the optic nerve using a Dumont #5 forcep (Figure 3A).\nPoke a hole in the center of the cornea with a 30 G needle, and then insert one tip of the microscissors into the hole to make an incision from the hole to the end of the cornea. Repeat to make 4 slices in the cardinal directions, creating 4 \"flaps\" (Figure 3A).\nWith two Dumont #5 forceps, grasp and pull the two adjacent flaps apart, gently peeling the sclera from the retina. Repeat with the remaining cornea flaps, and remove the sclera from the retina (Figure 3B).\nRemove the lens from the retinal cup using the forceps. With microscissors, make 4 radial incisions from the edge of the retina towards the optic nerve, creating 4 equal petals (Figure 3B). Repeat steps 3.4-3.7 for the second eye.\n4. Retinal flat-mount preparation",
    "Prepare grey mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane filter discs for mounting. If using large diameter MCE membrane filters, cut the disc into quadrants (roughly 1 cm across). Place the MCE disc onto the center of a larger white filter paper (Figure 3D).\n\tNOTE: MCE filters are also available in 1 cm diameter discs. The MCE filter disc must be large enough to fit 1-2 retinas, but small enough to fit into the imaging chamber. As MCE membranes hold a static charge, minimize contact and handling of the MCE membrane.\nHandling retinas using two size 3/0 paint brushes, flip one retinal cup onto a paintbrush with the retinal ganglion cell side down. Gently lift the retina out of the aCSF, making sure the water tension does not tear the retina (Figure 3C).\nWhile still holding the paintbrush with the retina, use a transfer pipette to place a droplet of aCSF in the center of the MCE filter paper (Figure 3C, right). Float the retina into the droplet of aCSF created by the surface tension. Use paint brushes to position the retina RGC side up within the droplet and to unfold the four petals.\nOnce positioned, create a water bridge between the paintbrush and white filter paper to break the surface tension of the droplet.\n\tNOTE: When aCSF is wicked away, the retina will adhere to the MCE filter paper (Figure 3D,E). Flat-mounted retinas can be handled by grasping the MCE disc with forceps. If the aCSF droplet quickly wicks away prior to forming a water bridge, this may indicate that the MCE membrane is not charged. Use a fresh MCE membrane, and minimize the time between enucleation and imaging by dissecting and flat-mounting retinas immediately before moving retinas into the imaging chamber.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62308/62308fig03.jpg",

Time-lapse confocal imaging of live whole-mount retina preparations\nAssemble the live-imaging incubation chamber for an upright confocal microscope as seen in Figure 4.",
    "NOTE: For inverted confocal systems, flat-mounts are placed RGC side down directly onto the glass bottom coverslip of the incubation chamber. Once the retinas make contact with the coverslip, they cannot be moved.\nFill the chamber with oxygenated aCSF, and turn on the pump and temperature controller (temperature 32-34 °C, flow rate 1 mL/min). Do not allow temperature to rise above 34 °C.\nTo transfer the retinal flat-mount to the perfusion chamber, stop the pump, and remove the aCSF that is in the chamber. Place the MCE disc with the retinal flat-mount into the (empty) incubation chamber.\nPlace a sample weight onto the flat-mount; pre-wet the weight to break surface tension. Refill the chamber with the warmed aCSF, and circulate aCSF at ~1 mL/min.\nPosition the nosepiece with the 25x water dipping objective (numerical aperture 0.95) into the imaging chamber. Screen for labelled cells of interest using epifluorescent light (Figure 4C).\nAdjust the imaging volume to capture dendritic features of interest.\n\tNOTE: This study captured the complete dendritic arbor at 1024 x 1024 pixels per frame, z-step 1 µm, and a frame rate of 2 min between each z-stack. Final image sizes are ~100 µm x 100 µm x 20 µm.\nTo adjust the laser power to an optimal setting, use a look-up table that identifies both oversaturated and undersaturated pixels. While scanning, adjust the laser power such that no pixels are oversaturated (i.e., at an intensity of 255 or above). Continue imaging as long as required, or until the there is a significant and detectable decline in fluorescent signal and increase in noise (typically 2-4 h).",
    "NOTE: Reduced laser power is recommended as deconvolution algorithms work optimally when pixels are distributed over the full dynamic range. Pixel intensity should not exceed 254; empirical analyses of neurites revealed that pixel values below 170 are ideal for deconvolution. Fast scan speeds (400-600 Hz) with line averaging (2-3) are preferable to single, slower scans of the same total pixel dwell time. The area of prolonged imaging often photobleaches, but other explant sections remain viable. Multiple regions in a flat-mount can be imaged, each for 2-4 h, with a total incubation time of 6 hours. Imaging sessions beyond 6 h have not been systematically tested. Neurite degradation and blebbing are signs that the explant viability is declining.\nAfter imaging, fix the retinal flat-mounts and membrane filter with cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Amplify the fluorescent labels in the fixed retinas by immunohistochemistry for further analyses.\n\tNOTE: Post-imaging fixation is not possible when using an inverted confocal; retinas are not removable without destroying the tissue.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62308/62308fig04.jpg",

Image deconvolution and post-processing in ImageJ\nImport the image series, split the series by time, and color if it is a multi-color image. Ensure that all time points for one color are contained in the same folder.\n\tNOTE: Import Bio-formats if using ImageJ (Bio-formats is automatically included in FIJI).\nCreate a theoretical point-spread function (PSF) using the ImageJ plugin, Diffraction PSF 3D.\n\tNOTE: Each imaging channel requires its own PSF as fluorescent protein emission wavelength impacts the PSF.\nUse Plugins | Macros | Run to perform batch Parallel Iterative Deconvolution for all timepoints using the provided macro (Supplementary File 1).\n\tNOTE: This macro runs 25 iterations of the Wiener Filter Preconditioned Landweber (WPL) iterative algorithm. Each color channel must be deconvolved separately.",
    "Merge the color channels, and compile all time points into a Hyperstack (Image | Hyperstacks | Stacks to Hyperstack). Correct the 3D drift using Plugins | Registration | Correct 3D Drift.\nReturn the image to a regular stack (Image | Hyperstacks | Hyperstack to Stack), and split the time points (Image | Stacks | Tools | Stack Splitter). Use batch processing to create maximum projection for all time points (Process | Batch | Macro | run(\"Z Project...\", \"projection=[Max Intensity]\"); ).\nImport the time-lapse image sequence (File | Import | Image Sequence). Use conventional ImageJ tools for desired analysis of deconvolved and post-processed two-dimensional (2D) video.\n\tNOTE: Four-dimensional (3D + time) deconvolved and drift-corrected videos can be viewed as a hyperstack. Omit the previous step to maintain 3D time points.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
