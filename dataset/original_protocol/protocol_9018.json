    "1. Cell Preparation\nOn Day 1, weigh and anesthetize animal.\n \nWeigh a 30 g-1 kg animal. Anesthetize in 5-10 animal volumes of 1:1 seawater:isotonic MgCl . 6H20 for 1 hr with aeration such as an electric aquarium air pump with attached airstone.\nPrepare dissection supplies.\n \nAssemble clean dissection tray with stainless steel straight pins, such as fabric pins. Assemble several Petri dishes containing artificial seawater (ASW; see Tables 1 and 3) + penicillin/ streptomycin (P/S).\nHave ready a low power microscope. Have clean dissection instruments ready, such as ribbed nose and fine surgical forceps, and fine and large surgical scissors. Spray the instruments with 70% isopropol alcohol before use and allow to dry.\nPosition animal on dissection tray.\n \nPosition animal ventral side down in the dissection tray. Pin animal through edges of body wall and parapodial borders, but avoid tail and head, to expose the dorsal surface and the genital groove\nRinse the dorsal surface in slow-running cold tap water. Apply a light stream of 70% isopropol alcohol from a squeeze bottle along the genital groove and over the top of the head.\nMake the initial incision.\n \nUsing a low power microscope (see Table 2) and reflected light to observe the point where the genital groove originates from the anterior shell margin, tautly hold with ribbed-nose forceps a fold of tissue to the left of this origin, while snipping a shallow hole all the way through the smooth, flat area of body wall just to the right of the genital groove with fine angled scissors.\nHemolymph should be observed to pour from the hole, sometimes carrying with it the abdominal ganglion and stomach.\nExpand the incision.",
    "Use large scissors to expand the incision anteriorly to a point between the rhinophores, while pulling upward with the lower blade to avoid nicking the gut. The internal organs will be observed to spill out of the incision.\nRemove the ganglia.\n \nReposition the tray and refocus the microscope on the head region.\nUsing clean forceps and fine scissors, remove the head ganglia by severing at one point the nerves that form the head ganglia into a ring around the esophagus to remove pleural-pedal and cerebral ganglia as a group.\nRemove the buccal ganglion that adheres to the ventral side of the esophagus.\nRemove the abdominal ganglion by cutting the 4 large nerve connectives that issue from this ganglion.\nIsolate ganglia of interest.\n \nTrim head ganglia apart, leaving a length of connectives attached to each ganglion of interest that is equal to at least the diameter of the ganglion; this will retard enzyme over-digestion of the cells of interest in the next step.\nPut each target ganglion through 2 rinses of ASW + P/S, moving between rinses with clean forceps.\nIf targeting the PVC cells, leave the right pleural hemiganglion attached to the right pedal hemiganglion, and similarly leave the left pleural hemiganglion attached to the left pedal hemiganglion.\nDiscard unwanted ganglia and the rest of the animal according to accepted research practice.\nEnzymatically digest the ganglia.\n \nFor each ganglion, prepare 1 ml of enzyme solution consisting of 3.75 mg dispase, 1 mg hyaluronidase and 0.3 g collagenase type XI per ml of ASW + P/S in a 15 ml polypropylene conical tube.\nPlace rinsed ganglia in enzyme solution and attach the cap tightly. Place the tube on its side on a rotary shaker (see Table 2) at slow speed for 13-5 hr overnight at approximately 23 °C (room temperature).",
    "Prepare the culture dishes.\n \nBefore microdissection (Day 2), prepare poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated culture dishes in a tissue culture hood. Add ~0.5 ml PDL (0.2 mg/ml of sterile water) to the center of a 35 mm dish for ~25 min.\nRinse PDL 3x with sterile water. Allow to dry. UV-sterilize the plates.\nDay 2 Isolate neurons.\n \nFill the center of 35 mm dishes that were PDL-coated and UV sterilized with approximately 0.5 ml of ASW + P/S to create an island of media inside the otherwise dry dish. This can be done on the bench, outside the tissue culture hood. One dish should be prepared for each cell cluster originating from a hemiganglion.\nHave ready a 100 mm diameter dissection dish made by sylgard-coating and curing a 5 mm deep dissection surface, outfitted with fine dissection pins of several sizes to be used as pins and probes (see Table 3). Rinse this dish with 70% isopropol alcohol, then with ASW + P/S, and finally fill it with ASW + P/S.\nPrepare microdissection of digested ganglia.\n \nPour the enzyme solution containing the digested pleural-pedal and buccal ganglia into the dissection dish.\nPlace the dish on the stage of the microscope against a black surface under reflected light.\nUsing the attached connective tissue, pin down each pleural-pedal hemiganglion dorsal side up. The tissues will be soft and intolerant of stretching.\nMicrodissect PVC neurons.\n \nUsing 2 pairs of clean fine forceps, and holding a fine dissection pin in one pair of forceps as a probe, isolate the PVC cells from a pleural hemiganglion. Enzyme digestion will have removed or broken apart the connective tissue sheath covering the PVC cluster, yet the cells will adhere to one another.",
    "Use the probe to detach these cells from the pedal-pleural connective18, then let the cell cluster fall to the bottom of the dissection dish.\nTransfer neurons to culture dish.\n \nTransfer the cell cluster to a prepared 35 mm culture dish by gently sucking up the cluster into the tip of a slightly fire polished disposable glass Pasteur pipette, then dispensing it slowly into the media island in a culture dish, being careful to avoid introducing air bubbles into the pipette. Repeat isolation of the PVC cluster of the other hemiganglion and place into a separate culture dish.\nMicrodissect and transfer BSC neurons.\n \nPin out the buccal ganglion ventral side up, with care to spare the cells of interest. Repeat step 1.12 with the 2 BSC cell clusters of the buccal ganglion10.\nIsolation of PVC and BSC neurons will produce 4 culture dishes containing neuron clusters: 2 dishes containing BSC clusters and 2 dishes containing PVC clusters. Discard the rest of the ganglia and set aside the 100 mm dissection dish.\nDissociate the cell clusters.\n \nPlace a culture dish containing cells on the stage of the low power microscope and remove the cover.\nDissociate the PVC cluster by gently flicking the bottom of the culture dish adjacent to the cell cluster with a fine dissection pin held in forceps. Flicking is digging the tip of the pin into the plastic of the bottom of the dish as though trying to dig out a fleck of plastic. When friction with the plastic releases the pin point, a percussion wave is produced through the medium that breaks apart the nearby clump of cells.",
    "5-10 flicks may be needed to nearly completely dissociate the cells, but it is better to leave small clusters of cells rather than to flick too much lest the cells be destroyed by mechanical sheer.\nReplace cover and repeat with other culture dishes.\nStore cell cultures.\n \nPlace the culture dishes containing media islands in their centers with dissociated cells into a large container that permits air circulation, such as a 150 x 25 mm round plastic Petri dish, and place this dish in an incubator set to 17 °C.\nInstall in the chamber an open dish of water as a source of humidity. Leave undisturbed overnight. The cells will adhere to the poly-D-lysine coating in the center of the dish.\nFlood culture dishes.\n \nOn Day 3, Gently flood the dishes with 2.5 ml of ASW + P/S. Examine and count the cells using an inverted cell culture microscope. Store in the 17 °C incubator.\n2. Electrophysiology\nThe method is standard patch clamping that has been described in numerous texts (e.g. Sakmann and Neher, 1995)16. This protocol will work on cells ≤100 pF capacitance, or cells <60 μm diameter during days 3 and 4 of the protocol. Cells without processes are optimal for recording. The following special considerations apply:\nLarger cells can be accommodated with the configuration setting on the Axopatch 200B amplifier set to β=0.1. Activation of very large currents may cause cells to escape voltage clamp. ASW solutions substituted for salt content (e.g. a fraction of the NaCl substituted with impermeable N-methy-D-glucamine chloride) may be used to reduce whole cell current amplitude.",
    "Fiber-filled borosilicate patch pipettes pulled on a pipette puller and backfilled halfway with intracellular solution (ICS) consisting of 450 mM KCl and other salts (see Table 1) are suitable, and should have resistance of approximately 0.5-1 MOhms. If isolation of specific ionic currents is desired, for example, Na+ currents in the absence of K currents, K+ in this solution can be replaced with other ions such as Cs+. Cl- replacement of ICS with an impermeant anion is also warranted if a more natural ICS is desired9.\nThe cells are robust with >1 hr-long recordings possible at room temperature. Recording is optimal on days 3 and 4 of the protocol, corresponding to 24-48 hr in culture. After 48 hr there is difficulty forming gigaOhm seals, perhaps because of elaboration of a glycocalyx on the cell surface, and space clamp problems caused by process outgrowth. The cells are useful, however, for non-patch clamp studies, such as toxicology, that can be completed in <14 d.\nASW and other solutions to be dispensed from the gravity fed solution device, as well as intracellular solution, should be filtered through a syringe-mounted 0.2 μm Acrodisk filter (Table 3) to eliminate fine particles that interfere with gigaOhm seal formation.\nDesensitization occurs when using agonists such as D-Aspartate (D-Asp), therefore ~1-2 min between applications of agonists is recommended. Conversely, potentiation is often observed with rapid repeated application of agonists such as L-Glutamate (L-Glu).",
    "Agonist activated currents such as L-Glu can be studied by applying agonists with the picospritzer pipette. This pipette is pulled the same as the patch pipette and contains agonist in ASW. When the tip of this pipette is positioned below the outflow pipe of the gravity fed solution device, and at a 45° angle from the outflow pipe (Figure 2F), agonist will be quickly washed away from the cell, and desensitization will be minimized. The agonist pipette should create an angle of 90° or more relative to the patch pipette.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
