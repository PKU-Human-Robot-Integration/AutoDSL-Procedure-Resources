Conjugation of the label to the NH2-ddUTP terminator nucleotide; B. TdT mediated labeling of ssDNA oligonucleotides; C. Purification of labeled ssDNA molecules (probes).Preparing the dye conjugated ddUTP (First pot, Figure 1A)Reconstitute the dye-NHS ester to 40 mM final concentration in anhydrous DMSO in a moisture free environment. (see Note 1) In a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, aliquot X Œºl of 20 mM Amino-11-ddUTP or 5-propargylamino-ddUTP. (see Note 3)Add 0.2X Œºl of 1 M NaHCO3 (pH = 8.4).Finally, add X Œºl of 40 mM dye-NHS ester (see Note 4). Mix well and incubate at RT for 2 h sealed from light. After the incubation, add 1.8X Œºl dH2O to expand the reaction volume to 4X Œºl. This results in a 5 mM stock of dye conjugated ddUTP (see Note 5). The resulting labeled nucleotide is stable for over a year when stored at -20 ¬∞C.Production of labeled ssDNA oligonucleotides (second pot, Figure 1B)Prepare an equimolar mixture of all different ssDNA oligos that should be labeled together, i.e., that target the same transcript. The total concentration of oligos should not be lower than 100 ŒºM. (see Note 6)To label 1 nmol of oligonucleotide mixture, prepare the following labeling mixture in a 0.2 ml thin-walled PCR tube:table:\nÔªø0,1\nAmount,Final concentration\n\"1 nmol oligo-mixture (e.g., 4 Œºl of 250 ŒºM stock)\",66.67 ŒºM\n3 Œºl 5x TdT reaction buffer (with Co2+),1x\n\"3-5 nmol dye-ddUTP (e.g., 0.6-1.0 Œºl of 5 mM stock)\",200-330 nM\n1x standard amount of TdT,0.4-0.8 U/Œºl\ndH2O,to 15 Œºl",
    "Please use the interactive probe_calculator.xls Excel sheet (Supplementary File 2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171119/probe calculator.xlsx]) to get the reaction composition adjusted to the dye-ddUTP used for labeling.Incubate at 37 ¬∞C O/N (16-18 h) in a PCR machine with the hot-lid set to 37 ¬∞C.Purification and spectroscopic analysis of the labeled oligonucleotide mixture (third pot, Figure 1C)After the O/N incubation, add 60 Œºl of 1 M Na-acetate (pH = 5.5), 125 Œºl of dH2O and 1.5 Œºg linear acrylamide to the reaction mixture.Transfer the entire 200 Œºl into a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Add 800 Œºl 100% ethanol prechilled at -20 ¬∞C. Invert the tube a couple of times and place it into the -20 ¬∞C freezer for about 15-20 min.In the meantime, cool the table-top centrifuge to 4 ¬∞C.After the -20 ¬∞C incubation, spin the oligonucleotide mixture at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 ¬∞C. Remove the supernatant and add 1 ml 80 % ethanol prechilled at 4 ¬∞C. Vortex until the pellet dissociates from the bottom of the tube. Spin at 16,000 x g for 5 min at 4 ¬∞C. Wash away the pellet from the wall of the tube with 1 ml 80% ethanol and transfer the entire volume including the floating pellet into a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Repeat Steps C5 and C6 two more times.Remove the supernatant from the last wash and let the pellet dry on air. (see Note 7) Resuspend the dried pellet in 15-50 Œºl nuclease-free dH2O.Measure the absorbance of the labeled oligonucleotide mix at 260 nm and at the dye absorption maximum (e.g., 570 nm for Atto565).In order to calculate the concentration and the degree-of-labeling (DOL), measure the absorbance of the unlabeled, undiluted oligonucleotide mix at 260 nm.",
    "(see Note 8) Calculate the molar extinction coefficient (ùúñoligo) of the oligonucleotide mixture by dividing the measured OD260 nm value with the concentration of the mixture (in M). Increase this value by 9,000 mol-1 cm-1 to correct for the UTP added to the 3‚Äô of the ssDNA molecules.Calculate the concentration of the labeled oligo by dividing the dye-corrected OD260 nm absorption by ùúñoligo:coligo = (OD260 nm - cf260 nm x ODdye)/ùúñoligo (see Note 9).Calculate the concentration of the dye as follows: cdye = ODdye/ùúñdye (provided by the dye manufacturer).Typically, only a small fraction of the dye molecules is present as contaminants (i.e., free from ssDNA), therefore the DOL is estimated as follows: DOL = cdye/coligo.The fraction of recovered oligonucleotides is assessed by taking the ratio of the recovered and initial amounts of the oligo (recovery% = coligo x Vresuspension/ninitial).The measured OD values can be entered into the interactive probe_calculator.xls Excel sheet (Supplementary File 2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171119/probe calculator.xlsx]) to obtain the concentration and the DOL of the labeled oligonucleotide mixture.Store the labeled probes at -20 ¬∞C.Trouble-shooting of 3P3 probe productionLabeled oligo mixtures with 0.9 < DOL ‚â§ 1.0 are considered good quality products that can be used in smFISH applications.The most typical cause of DOLs lower than 0.9 is the composition of the oligonucleotide mixture. We currently lack an understanding of which property(s) of the mixture‚Äìe.g., formation of intra- and intermolecular hybrids in the mixture‚Äìinfluence the labeling efficiency. However, if DOL < 0.9 is obtained, we recommend ‚Äòsplitting‚Äô the oligo mixture into two-three non-overlapping fractions, i.e., preparing two-three mixtures of the ssDNA oligos present in the original mixture. Individual labeling of these mixtures can help in identifying any molecules that behave extraordinarily in the labeling reaction. In most cases, we found that this ‚Äòsplitting‚Äô almost completely alleviates the low labeling efficiency problem, i.",
    "e., the DOL of each of the split mixtures increases above 0.9. Another solution we found was to re-label the already labeled oligonucleotide mixture, i.e., start over the labeling protocol from Step B2 using the labeled ssDNA molecules as input. (REF)The second most frequent reason for low DOL is the non-accurate (lower than actual) measurement of the molar extinction coefficient of the unlabeled oligo mixture. This can be noticed that when calculating the fraction of recovered oligonucleotides (recovery %) one obtains a value higher than one. In such cases, we recommend re-measuring the OD260 nm of the unlabeled oligo mixture at different concentrations (e.g., at 50, 100 and 200 ŒºM) and estimating the ùúñoligo by taking the slope of the line fitted to the data points. We found that terminal transferase activity of TdT varies from batch to batch. This may result in improper labeling (DOL < 0.9) when using 1x standard amount of the enzyme. We recommend to redefine the standard amount when starting a new aliquot of TdT, by setting up several labeling reactions of a single ssDNA oligo with Atto633-ddUTP (Procedures B and C) using increasing concentrations of TdT‚Äìe.g., 1x, 2x and 3x of the standard amount found in the recipe generator. Use the smallest concentration of the enzyme that yields DOL > 0.9 as the new standard amount.DOL > 1.0 may also indicate an imprecisely determined ùúñoligo. This would appear as a huge loss of the oligos (recovery < 50%). Try the same solution as in Step D3.If the ùúñoligo is appropriate, DOL > 1.0 indicates free dye contamination. In such cases it is advised to measure the DOL by PAGE (Procedure E). If the DOL determined by densitometry is ~1.0 and the difference of the two DOLs is small (max. 0.05-0.",
    "1), the free dye contamination is considered harmless in the downstream applications. If it is higher, re-purification of the oligonucleotide mixture by another method (e.g., by size exclusion chromatography) is recommended. We observed such high free dye contamination when using Abberior470SX-, Atto488- and AlexaFluor488-ddUTP (Gaspar et al., 2017b).PAGE analysis of the labeled oligonucleotidesGel electrophoresis provides a simple means to confirm the DOL estimated from spectroscopy data and to calculate DOL in case of non-fluorescent modifications (e.g., biotinylation). PAGE analysis also allows the quality control of most of the labeled ddUTP analogs, i.e., to determine whether there are unconjugated ddUTP molecules in the dye conjugated ddUTP stock (produced in Procedure A) that will result in reduced DOL of oligonucleotides. IMPORTANT: Only oligo-mixtures containing ssDNA molecules of identical length (e.g., only 20 mers) should be analyzed by PAGE.  Wipe the glass plates for gel casting clean with 70% ethanol, assemble the cassette and seal with 20 mm wide transparent tape, leaving the top (where the comb will be inserted) open. Put two fold-back clamps on the two sides of the cassette such that the clamps clamp above the spacer between the two glass plates.To cast a 10 x 8 cm acrylamide gel, add 8 ml of 15% PA - 8 M urea stock (see Recipes), 40 Œºl 10% APS and 5 Œºl TEMED into an Erlenmeyer flask. Mix well by swirling the flask and pour the mixture between the two plates of the assembled cassette. Fill to the top.Insert the comb, place the cassette horizontally and wait until the gel polymerizes (15-20 min).Remove the clamps, the tape and the comb. Rinse the outside of the cassette with dH2O to remove gel pieces polymerized on the outer surface and assemble the PAGE chamber.",
    "Fill with 1x TBE buffer (see Recipes) and pre-run the gel for 30 min with 2.5 mA/cm current (20 mA for an 8 cm long gel).In the meantime, prepare 5 Œºl of each sample by mixing 3 Œºl 1.5x PAGE loading buffer (see Recipes) and 2 Œºl oligonucleotide mixture containing 15-60 pmoles of labeled oligo. As size marker use a dilution row of the unlabeled oligonucleotide mixture (e.g., 1.5, 3 and 6 pmoles), no boiling is necessary.After the pre-run (E5), rinse all wells on the gel with 1x TBE using a P200 pipette to remove the accumulated urea that would prevent the loading.Load the samples and run the gel until the xylene cyanol (blue) and the bromophenol blue (purple) markers (from the 6x gel loading dye) reach about the one-third and two-third of the gel length.Image the fluorescently labeled pool of molecules on a gel-imager with appropriate filter sets to excite and detect the incorporated fluorescent dyes. Incubate the gel with SYBR-GOLD (or similar RNA/ssDNA dye) diluted 1:10,000 in 1x TBE for 10-15 min.Re-image the gel to detect both the non-modified and modified pools of ssDNA. Due to the addition of a bulky terminator nucleotide, labeled oligonucleotides run slower and thus they are well separated from their non-modified peers during PAGE. The amount of non-modified oligos can be measured by comparing the corresponding SYBR-GOLD fluorescence intensity to that of the dilution row of the unlabeled oligonucleotide mixture used as loading control (Figures 2A and 2A‚Äô).The presence of unconjugated ddUTP will result in production of unlabeled, ddUTP-terminated oligonucleotides. On gel, they appear as an intermediate band migrating between the unlabeled and labeled, fluorescent pool of oligos. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227191214_0667.jpgFigure 2. PAGE analysis of the labeled oligonucleotide mixtures. Labelling of the osk20nt-15x (Gaspar et al.",
    ", 2017b) probe mixture with Atto633-amino-11-ddUTP (lane 4) or Atto633-5-propargylamino-ddUTP (lane 5). The fluorescently labeled ssDNA species (magenta, A) migrate slower in the gel than the unlabeled oligonucleotides (green, A, gray, A‚Äô). Note that the probe molecules labeled with far-red fluorescence are not visible in the SYBR-GOLD channel, possibly because of a very efficient energy transfer form SYBR GOLD to Atto633 that quenches the SYBR GOLD fluorescence. While this is the case with other far-red dyes also (e.g., Abberior-RED), when there is no quenching dye present (e.g., biotinylated probes) or when the FRET fluorescence can be detected by the SYBR GOLD imaging setup (e.g., in case of Atto565), the labeled probes appear in the SYBR GOLD channel (Gaspar et al., 2017b). 1.5, 3, 6, 20 and 20 pmol ssDNA mixture was loaded to lanes 1-5, respectively. After a labeling reaction with either of the terminator nucleotides, only low amounts (< 1.5 pmol) of unlabeled oligonucleotides were left in the mixtures (lanes 4 and 5A and 5A‚Äô), indicating near-quantitative labeling with both terminator nucleotides. The red arrow indicates fluorescence of the bromophenol blue dye.Single molecule FISH in Drosophila ovariesDissect ovaries into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 300-500 Œºl fixative (for ovary dissection, please refer to Gaspar and Ephrussi, 2017).Fix for 20 min by nutating the dissected material.Remove the fixative and rinse the ovaries with 1 ml PBT (see Recipes).Wash ovaries in 1 ml fresh PBT for 10 min while nutating.Replace PBT and add Proteinase-K to 2 Œºg/ml final concentration. Nutate for 5 min at room temperature (RT). (see Note 10)Preheat 0.5 ml 0.05 v/v % SDS in PBS (see Recipes) to 95 ¬∞C.After the 5 min Proteinase-K digestion, remove the PBT and immediately apply the preheated SDS/PBS to the ovaries. Incubate them for 5 min at 95 ¬∞C.",
    "Add 1 ml RT PBS to the ovaries to cool the solution.Replace the wash solution with 200 Œºl 2x full-HYBEC (see Recipes). Transfer the tube to a rocking thermoblock set to 37-42 ¬∞C and shake at 1,000 RPM for 10 min.In the meantime, prepare the probe solution (5-12.5 nM/individual probe) in 50 Œºl of 2x full-HYBEC. Transfer the probe solution to the thermoblock and allow it to warm up (2-3 min). (see Note 11)After the 10 min incubation of the ovaries, apply the probe solution by mixing it into the 200 Œºl 2x full-HYBEC already on the specimen. Incubate for 1.5-3 h at 37-42 ¬∞C while rocking at 1,000 RPM.10-15 min before the end of the incubation, prewarm two times 1 ml 2x wash-HYBEC (see Recipes) to the hybridization temperature.Remove the hybridization solution‚Äìit may be kept at 4 ¬∞C for another hybridization‚Äìand wash with 1 ml prewarmed 2x wash-HYBEC for 2 x 15 min.Wash once with 1 ml RT PBT for another 15 min.Thoroughly remove the PBT and apply mounting medium, e.g., 80% TDE (see Recipes) or VectaShield. (see Note 12)After allowing the mounting medium to soak for at least one hour, mount the ovaries onto glass slides and image them using a high NA (> 1.1 NA) objective (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227191419_5954.jpgFigure 3. smFISH analysis of oskar mRNA in developing Drosophila egg-chambers. A. oskar mRNA is produced in the transcriptionally active nurse cells (left) and it is transported into the oocyte, where it localizes eventually at the posterior pole (on the right). The female germ-line cells (nurse cells + oocyte) are encapsulated by a layer of somatic epithelium, the follicle cells that do not express oskar mRNA. B. Close-up of the boxed region in A.",
    "oskar mRNA was detected by two different probe sets osk37x-Atto532 (green, osk3UTR#1-15 + oskCD#1-22) and oskCD20x-633 (red, oskCD#23-42, Gaspar et al., 2017b). There is a high degree of co-localization of the two puncta-like signal in the nurse cell compartment (B) and no such strong accumulations of the probes is detected in the follicle cells (B-B‚Äù). Arrows indicate multiple transcriptional loci inside the polyploid nucleus of the nurse cell (B). Scale bars represent 10 Œºm. C and D. Correlation of the signal intensities of the two channels. C. When all objects across the egg chamber are considered, a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.972) is established, indicating that the RNA content of the detected objects is variable. By fitting multiple Gaussian functions to the signal intensity distribution (Little et al., 2015; Gaspar et al., 2017b), it is possible to filter the smFISH objects containing a single copy of oskar RNA. D. In this regime, the correlation of the signal intensities is low to moderate (R2 = 0.264), however, vast majority of the objects can be detected in both channels‚Äìe.g., 88.6% of the objects analyzed in the Atto633 channel are also detectable in the Atto532 channel also. Vertical and horizontal black dashed lines represent the detection thresholds for the Atto633 and Atto532 channels, respectively. Red dashed line shows the boundary between objects with single and multiple copies of RNA (C). Colours represent the relative intensity difference between the two channels (see panel C for key). The number of smFISH objects (number of experiments) is indicated in C and D.RNA capture from ovarian lysateIsolate ovaries from well-fed 2-3 day old Drosophila melanogaster in PBS (see Note 13). Remove PBS and resuspend with 3 volumes lysis buffer. Mechanically homogenize using a tissue grinder.",
    "Transfer to fresh 15 ml tubes and clear the lysate by centrifugation (5 min at 140 x g).Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and dilute with 2 volumes capturing hybridization buffer (see Recipes). Preclear by adding 1:50 v/v Pierce¬Æ Avidin Agarose prewashed with a 1:2 mix of lysis buffer and capturing hybridization buffer.Keep on a rotator for 30 min at room temperature. Remove Avidin agarose by centrifugation (5 min at 140 x g). Split the precleared lysate (keep 0.1% as input sample) and supplement it with 0.25 ¬µg (see Note 14) of targeting and non-targeting control biotinylated DNA probes per ml of ovaries and incubate at 37 ¬∞C for 2 h on a rotator. Pre-wash 3.75 ¬µl magnetic Streptavidin beads per ml lysate with a 1:2 mix of lysis buffer and capturing hybridization buffer. Add magnetic Streptavidin beads to lysate and keep rotating for 1 h at 37 ¬∞C. Collect the beads using a magnetic rack.Wash beads three times for 5 min at 37 ¬∞C with low salt wash buffer (see Recipes).Wash beads two times for 5 min at 37 ¬∞C with high salt wash buffer (see Recipes). Wash beads three times for 5 min at 37 ¬∞C with low salt wash buffer.Elute the RNA from the beads by adding elution buffer (see Recipes) and boil at 95 ¬∞C for 5 min. Use approx. 0.75 ¬µl TE buffer per ¬µl Streptavidin bead slurry used in Step H10.Extract the RNA using an RNA extraction kit and determine the amount of captured RNA of targeting and non-targeting probes by qRT-PCR or Northern blot."
