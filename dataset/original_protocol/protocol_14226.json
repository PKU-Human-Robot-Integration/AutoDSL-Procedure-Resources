    "Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was obtained from human donors with approval of the Medical Ethical Committee (#MEC-2014-092), Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of Animal Experimentation, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (133-14-01).\n1. Human ASCs Isolation and Culture\nPrepare 3 mL of isolation medium for 1 g of adipose tissue. Mix low glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (LG-DMEM) with 10 g/L Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 1 g/L collagenase type 1.\nDissect human subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (n = 8, all female, mean age 40 ± 9 years old) to small pieces (0.5 cm) using a sterile surgical blade size 10, Adson-Brown tissue forceps and Metzenbaum scissors in a sterile Biological SafetyCabinet.\nStore the dissected tissue in a sterile glass media storage bottle. Weigh the total amount of dissected tissue and start the digestion with the prepared isolation medium (50 g of adipose tissue with 150 mL of isolation medium per bottle). The protocol can be paused here by storing the bottle with the dissected adipose tissue and isolation medium at 4 °C on a roller mixer overnight. Then prewarm the bottle the next day to room temperature 25 °C for 15 min before continuing with the next step.\n\tNOTE: Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was obtained as leftover material from donors undergoing breast reconstruction surgery with approval of the Erasmus MC Medical Ethical Committee (# MEC-200) and according to the Code of Conduct: \"Proper Secondary Use of Human Tissue\" (<http://www.federa.org>). Leftover adipose tissue was only used from donors who did not opt-out to secondary use.\nDigest the dissected adipose tissue in a sterile glass media storage bottle in a shaker-incubator at 150 rpm and 37 °C for 1 h.",
    "Divide the digested solution into 50 mL tubes and centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 390 x g.\nPrepare culture medium: LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 1.5 µg/mL ampothericin B.\nFollowing the centrifugation, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 20 mL of culture medium (LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 1.5 µg/mL ampothericin B). Centrifuge the cells again for 5 min at 390 x g and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL of culture medium (LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 1.5 µg/mL ampothericin B) and filter the cell suspension through a 100 µm filter.\nAdd 50 µL of 3% acetic acid/methylene blue solution (for red blood cell lysis) to 50 µL of cell suspension, mix the solution and use 10 µL to count the cells. Perform cell counting with a hemocytometer. Then plate the cells at a density of 40,000 cells/cm2 in culture medium (LG-DMEM supplemented with 30% FBS, 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 1.5 µg/mL ampothericin B).\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nFollowing the incubation, wash the cells with warm (37 °C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove cell debris and replace the media with 10% FBS culture medium with freshly added ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (25 µg/mL) and human recombinant fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, 1 ng/mL).\nSubculture ASCs at 90% confluence using standard 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution (3 mL for a T175 flask). After 3-5 min, neutralize the 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution with 10 mL of culture medium (LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 1.5 µg/mL ampothericin B).",
    "NOTE: Flow cytometry analysis using common ASC surface markers and tri-lineage differentiation assays were performed previously and revealed that ASCs isolated using this protocol displayed ASC specific characteristics21,22.\nWash the cells with 10 mL of culture medium (LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 1.5 µg/mL ampothericin B) for a T175 flask and centrifuge the cells for 8 min at 250 x g. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of culture medium. Count the cells with a hemocytometer.\nPlate the cells in T175 culture flasks at a density of 8,000 cells/cm2.\nFreeze the remaining ASCs in liquid nitrogen with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in culture medium before further use.\n2. ASC Sheet Preparation\nPre-coat thermo-responsive culture dishes (3.5 cm diameter) with 1 mL of FBS, then place the dishes in an incubator at 37 °C for at least 30 min before cell seeding.\nTrypsinize ASCs using standard 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution for 3-5 min (3 mL for a T175 culture flask). If there are any cell clumps after trypsinization, filter the cells through a 100 µm filter before counting.\nNeutralize the trypsin solution with LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (10 mL for a T175 flask) and centrifuge the cell suspension for 8 min at 250 x g. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of LG-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nAfter coating the thermo-responsive culture dishes with FBS, move the dishes from the incubator to a warming plate at 37 °C and remove FBS from the dish.\nSeed ASCs at 400,000 cells/cm2 (in total, 3.52 × 106 cells diluted in 2 mL of culture medium per dish).\nCarefully distribute the cells as evenly as possible by gently swinging the dish.",
    "Culture ASC sheets for 48 h at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Try to minimize opening the door of the incubator after seeding ASCs to prevent temperature drops that may interfere with ASC sheet formation or cause premature detachment of formed ASC sheets.\n3. Partial Colectomy and Colorectal Anastomosis\nInduce and maintain Male Wistar rats (weighing between 250-350 g) with 1 L/min of isoflurane (1.5-5%)/oxygen inhalation and inject 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine intramuscularly.\nOnce the animals are under general anesthesia, assess anesthetic depth using reflex testing. Apply vitamin A containing eye ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness. When anesthesia is considered sufficient for surgery, aseptically prepare the abdomen by shaving hairs and spraying the surgical area twice with 70% ethanol. Drape the abdomen with sterile paper drapes. Use an aseptic technique and maintain the sterile field during the whole surgical procedure.\nMake a midline abdominal incision of 5 cm with a sterile surgical blade size 10 and extend the incision with Metzenbaum scissors. Identify and exteriorize the colon and pack the colon off from the remainder of the abdominal cavity with saline moistened gauzes. Identify the right, middle, and left colic arteries in the mesentery, bluntly dissect around each vessel using Halsted mosquito and ligate each individual vessel with non-absorbable braided silk 4/0.\nIsolate the colonic segment between 1.0 cm aborally to the cecum and 0.5 cm above the caudal mesenteric artery. Transect through healthy colon using Metzenbaum scissors. After the resection of the colonic segment, bring the proximal and distal ends of the colon together by introducing two long cotton swabs trans-anally through the distal colon, and then into the proximal colon end.",
    "Using a surgical microscope, create an insufficiently sutured end-to-end anastomosis by one-layer inverting suturing using 5 interrupted sutures (non-absorbable monofilament polyamide 8/0). Place the interrupted sutures through all layers of the colon wall and position the knots extraluminally.\nDivide the rats randomly into control or ASC sheet group.\n4. ASC Sheet Transplantation\nAllow the culture dishes to cool down to room temperature 40 min before in vivo transplantation, to facilitate ASC sheet detachment.\n\tNOTE: After the detachment, ASC sheets shrink to approximately 2 cm in diameter. ASC sheet viability remains high for at least 3-6 h after the detachment20.\nRemove the culture medium and replace it with 1 mL of serum free LG-DMEM.\nGently grab the rims of the ASC sheet with atraumatic forceps and place the dish-side of the ASC sheet on top of the anastomotic line.\nCarefully stretch out the ASC sheet approximately 0.25 cm above and below the anastomotic line using the atraumatic forceps and wrap the sheet around the colon. Lift the colon up to wrap the ASC sheet around the dorsal side.\n\tNOTE: ASC sheets adhere spontaneously to the anastomotic line, there is no need to use tissue glue or any other biomaterial. The control group does not receive any additional treatment.\nRemove the cotton swabs and change the gloves and instruments. Replace the colon in the abdomen. Close the abdomen-linea alba with one layer of running sutures using absorbable braided polyglycolic acid 5/0. Suture the subcutis and the cutis together in one layer of running sutures using absorbable braided polyglycolic acid 5/0.\n5. Post-operative Evaluation and Follow-up",
    "Immediately rehydrate the animals with a subcutaneous injection of 5 mL warm saline postoperatively. Place the animals under a heat lamp to maintain body temperature and monitor the vital signs until animals regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\tNOTE: Animals that had undergone surgery were not returned to the company of other animals until fully recovered. After recovery, allow free access to water and regular rat chow. For post-surgical pain relief, administer 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously every 6-8 h for 3 days. No antibiotics were administered at any time in this study.\nObtain daily clinical evaluations of wellness and weight. In case of a very low wellness score or severe weight loss, animals should be euthanized by exsanguination via cardiac puncture while still under anesthesia.\nOn postoperative day 3 or day 7, anesthetize the rats again with 1 L/min of isoflurane (1.5-5%)/oxygen inhalation without buprenorphine, and perform a re-laparotomy with a U-shaped incision. Check the abdomen for the signs of peritonitis, stricture, fibrous adhesions, and the presence of abscesses. Score the severity of adhesions and abscess both in the abdomen and at the anastomotic area.\nDetermine the anastomotic bursting pressure by the insufflation of air in a closed segment of the colon including the anastomosis. Record the air pressure and the place of rupture when the first air leak as bursting pressure.\nRemove the colon from each sacrificed animal and fix the cut segment of the colon -containing the colorectal anastomosis- with 4% buffered formaldehyde, following by paraffin embedding and cutting the colon into 4 μm thick sections.\nEuthanize the animals while under anesthesia directly after collection of the anastomosis segment by exsanguination via cardiac puncture. Confirm animal death with the absence of breathing movement and a heartbeat.",
    "Perform histochemical stainings such as Hematoxylin & Eosin and Picro Sirius red, and immunohistochemical stainings with antibodies against human mitochondria, rat endothelial cells (anti-CD34) and cells of the immune system (CD3+, CD163+).\nDigitalize the slides for computerized analysis and compare the animal groups.\nSubscription Required.
