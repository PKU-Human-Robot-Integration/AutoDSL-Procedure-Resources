    "All procedures involving animals were performed according to the standards set by the Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Euthanasia was performed via cervical dislocation under anesthesia with ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally. All surgical procedures were performed in a sterile manner (surgeon was wearing head cap, face mask, sterile gloves, and clean disposable lab coat) and surgical tools were autoclaved between each use.\n1. Presurgical Steps\nAutoclave all surgical instruments to ensure sterility.\nAnesthetize C57bl6 mice with isoflurane (4% for induction and 1.5-2% for surgery). Pinch the hind toe every 10 min to ensure proper depth of anesthesia. Increase anesthesia if vocalization or hind limb retraction is seen.\nApply veterinary eye lubricant to the eyes to prevent drying.\nRemove the hair over the scalp with a 3 min application of hair removal gel or by shaving with an electric razor.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotaxic frame on a heating pad or calibrated water recirculating blanket set to 38°C.\nAdminister buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously to provide presurgical analgesia.\nDisinfect the scalp with three alternating applications of chlorhexidine or betadine and 70% ethanol using a cotton tipped applicator.\nInject 100 mL of bupivacaine diluted 50% in saline under the scalp to provide local anesthesia.\n2. Piezoelectric Cranial Window Surgery\nUsing autoclaved sterile surgical instruments, remove a 1 cm circle of scalp over the skull by cutting with surgical scissors in a circular pattern. Lift the scalp off the skull exposing the periosteum tissue over the bone.\nUse the tip of forceps to scrape the exposed bone clear of any remaining periosteum tissue. This is important to ensure that the dental cement will not fall off later.",
    "Set the piezoelectric surgery unit to vibrate on the lowest setting. Note that higher settings may break blood vessels due to intense vibrations.\nFix the sterile circular tip to the handpiece.\n\tNOTE: The 4 mm circular tip is well suited for surgeries. The large tip size contributes to the speed of the surgery as the entire window can be thinned simultaneously.\nFill a 10 mL syringe with ice cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and hold it in the hand not holding the piezoelectric handpiece.\nIrrigate the skull by dripping the ACSF from the syringe onto the skull at a rate of 1 mL/min. Alternatively, use a peristaltic pump positioned over the skull to free the use of the other hand.\n\tNOTE: Irrigation with cold ACSF is important to prevent overheating due to the friction from the high frequency vibrations.\nGently apply the vibrating surgical tip to the skull with a light circular motion (3 circles per 1 s) and thin the bone to the desired depth to perform a thin skull preparation (5 to 10 min).\n\tNOTE: Here, 4 mm windows were made that were thinned to 20 µm. However, the size of the window will vary with the size of the surgical tip. The thickness of the bone can be adjusted to the desired depth based on the length of time spent applying the tip to the skull.\nGently adjust the angle of the handpiece and change the angle of the tip while applying pressure to the skull to thin the skull uniformly.\nTo perform a complete bone removal without leaving any thin bone behind, thin the bone until cracks are visible around the window area. Remove the remaining flakes of thin bone with forceps without damaging the underlying dura.",
    "Soak a 1 mm piece of hemostatic collagen foam in cold ACSF. Hold the wet foam with forceps and place it on the thin skull. Allow it to sit on the thin skull for about 30 s to stop any micro bleeds from developing.\nUse forceps to place a 4 mm glass coverslip laterally over the window that has been thinned into the bone.\nUse the back of a small plastic or wooden cotton tipped applicator to apply approximately 100 µL of dental acrylic to the skull to hold the window in place.\n3. Post Surgical Care\nRemove the mouse from the surgical apparatus and place it in a heated cage for recovery. Monitor it continuously until it has regained full consciousness (assessed by normal mobility, gait, and behavior).\nAssess the animals twice a day for three days for manifestations of post-surgical pain including decreased activity, grooming, food, and water consumption, guarding behavior (e.g. limping or a hunched posture) or increased aggression. Do not return the animal to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\nAdminister Buprenorphine (0.05–0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously as an analgesic 8–12 h after the surgery for 3 days. Monitor the area of the window closely following surgery for dehiscence, inflammation, and signs of infection. If the animal does not return to baseline feeding and grooming behaviors, consult a veterinarian regarding possible interventions or euthanasia."
