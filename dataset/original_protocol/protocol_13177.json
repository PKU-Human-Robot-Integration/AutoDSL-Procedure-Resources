    "The protocol of this study has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Longhua Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Approval Number: 2023-LHXS-030). Before the trial, written informed consent was provided by each patient included in the study. A total of 76 patients with stage I-II frozen shoulder in the rehabilitation department of Longhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from December 2022 to May 2023, who met the inclusion criteria, were randomly divided into a control group and a treatment group, with 38 cases in each group. The operator must be familiar with the anatomy of the shoulder joint and the specific surgical method.\n1. Recruitment of patients\nUse the following inclusion criteria to enroll patients in this study: Conform to the diagnostic criteria of frozen shoulder; stage I or II frozen shoulder; regardless of gender, 40-65 years old; VAS score ≤ 7; without other treatment at the same time.\nUse the following exclusion criteria to not include patients in this study: Patients with blood coagulation dysfunction; diabetic patients with unstable blood sugar control; pregnant pand lactating women; patients with damaged treatment sites or serious infection; Patients with allergies to anesthesia.\n2. Exercises regime for control group\nSubject patients in the control group to a treatment course of functional exercises as described below19.\n\t\nHand wall climbing: Ask the patient to stand facing the wall with both feet open and raising both hands to climb up along the wall. Ask the patient to take the hands to the highest scales with the maximum tolerance and record this for each patient.",
    "Assisted hand: In a standing position, ask the patient to keep the affected upper limb in the state of backward extension and perform internal rotation to the opposite side by pulling the wrist of the affected upper limb with the healthy upper limb, and then maintain the upward pulling state to the maximum tolerance for the patient.\nPendulum swings: In standing and bending down position, ask the patient to support the healthy arm of each patient and drop to the affected side and perform the back and forth, left and right, as well as circle movements. Increase the range of motion when the symptoms are improved and draw circles by holding an object which is 1-2 kg (such as water bottles, dumbbells) to increase the intensity of stretching exercises.\nCourse of functional exercise: Ensure the patients in the control group perform functional exercises every day including wall climbing, assisted hand and the pendulum swings, 30 times/day for 4 weeks.\n\tNOTE: The functional exercise must be carried out within the tolerance range; otherwise, it may cause soft tissue strain in the shoulder and lead to deterioration of the condition.\nFollow the principle of - from light to heavy, from small to large, step by step and continuously - during the functional exercise. Ask the patient to avoid long-term shoulder work, heavy lifting, or strenuous activities, though the patient can perform all day-to-day activities during treatment.\n3. Exercise regime for treatment group\nSubject patients in the treatment group to small needle knife therapy with functional exercises.\nPreoperative preparation",
    "Material preparation (Figure 1): Sterilize disposable medical plastic cup, medical tweezers, absorbent cotton ball, dressing block, a 40 mm x 40 mm disposable sterile small needle knife, marker pen, type II skin disinfectant, 2% lidocaine hydrochloride, sterile water for injection, 10 mL disposable sterile syringe, disposable sterile injection needle, rubber surgical gloves, self-adhesive dressing.\nPatient information check: Check the basic information of each patient (name, age, affected shoulder). Explain the process and advantages of the small needle knife therapy. Make sure that the patients fully understand and relax during the operational procedure.\nPatient preparation: Fully expose the affected shoulder in a sitting position.\nPositioning (Figure 2): Mark the obvious tenderness points of the affected shoulder, such as the coracoid process point (attachment point of the short head of the biceps), lesser tuberosity of greater (attachment point of the subscapular muscle), intertubercular sulcus (attachment point of the long head of the biceps muscle), subacromial bursae (attachment point of the supraspinatus muscle), 2 cm behind the greater tuberosity of humerus (attachment point of the teres minor muscle)20.\nDisinfection: Prepare cotton balls in type II skin disinfectant. Routinely disinfect the skin 3x with gradually reduced diameter starting from 15 cm around the marking point.\nOperational procedure (Figure 2)\n\t\nLoad 5 mL 2% lidocaine plus 5 mL of sterile water into a 10 mL syringe to prepare a 10 mL 1% lidocaine working solution. \nReplace the 22G needle with a 25G needle (use thinner needles to ease the pain). Wear the sterile gloves on the left hand and hold the syringe in the right hand.\nInsert the needle into the mark and make sure no blood returns upon aspiration. Perpendicularly inject 1-2 mL of 1% lidocaine working solution at each marked point.",
    "Small needle knife insertion (Figure 2): Wear sterile gloves in the right hand to hold the small needle knife. Rapidly insert the small needle knife into the lidocaine injection site perpendicularly with a depth of about 1-3 cm. Make sure that the blade of the small needle knife is parallel to the muscle fibers to avoid damage to important blood vessels and nerves.\nPerform the 3-step manipulation of longitudinal incision, stripping and releasing the adhesion7,15. The patient will feel local soreness and pain, and the operator will feel resistance under the knife.\nWithdraw the needle when the operator feels a sense of looseness under the knife.\nPostoperative care (Figure 2)\n\t\nPress the injection site for 1 min with a dry sterile cotton ball. Cover the operating area with a sterile self-adhesive dressing.\nAssist the patients to dress well.\n\t\tNOTE: Put the medical waste into the medical waste trash can.\nAsk the patient to sit still for about 15 min before leaving the operating room to avoid postoperative discomfort. Advice the patient to keep the self-adhesive dressing dry until it is removed 48 h later to avoid bleeding and infection.\nCourse of small needle knife therapy21: Subject the patients in the treatment group to small needle knife therapy, once a week with a total of 4 sessions. Carry out the same functional exercises for patients in the treatment group as done for the control group.\n4. Post-intervention outcome assessments\nEvaluation index22,23,24\nUse the visual analogue scores (VAS), the Constant and Murley scores (CMS), and the thickness of CHL under ultrasound to assess the outcome.\n\t\tNOTE: The baseline measurements were performed before and one week after the treatment.\nAssessment instruments\n\t\nUse the GJJDC01 high-precision joint motion electronic measuring instrument for shoulder joint motion measurement and a portable color ultrasound system (Figure 3).",
    "Assessment instruments operation method (Figure 3)\n\t\nMeasurement of shoulder range of motion.\n\t\t\nPress ON to turn on the power. Ask the subject to uplift the shoulder to the maximum angle possible. Rotate the measuring ruler and obtain the measured value.\nSet the measuring instrument scale back to 0 and repeat the measurement 2x. Press and hold OFF to turn the power off.\nMeasurement of the thickness of CHL using an ultrasound.\n\t\t\nTurn ON the ultrasound machine by pressing the Power button. Press the Patient button, click New Patient, and enter the name of the subject.\nAsk the patient to fully expose the affected shoulder in a seated position. Move the shoulder joint of the patient passively to locate the CHL. Align the ultrasound probe with the CHL.\nPress the Freeze button to save the ultrasound image. Press the Caliper button to test CHL thickness. Record the measurement and turn it OFF.\n5. Statistical analysis\nPresent the continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Use the independent sample t-test to compare the differences between the two groups. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using statistical software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
