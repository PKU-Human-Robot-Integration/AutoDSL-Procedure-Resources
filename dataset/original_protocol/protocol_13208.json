Preparing mice for the experimental procedure\nRaise 22 SPF-grade male Balb/c mice (6-7 weeks old, body weight 20-25 g) in the animal facility of the hospital/research center. Divide the animals into control (n = 8) and model (n = 14) groups using the random number table method.\nAfter 1 week of adaptive rearing in the laboratory cage, feed the model group (IgAN group) with 0.1% bovine gamma globulin (BGG) solution in acidified water containing 6 mmol/L HCl for 9 weeks according to the modeling protocol of Zou et al.18.\nInject 0.1 mL of 0.1% BGG solution in saline into the tail vein for 3 consecutive days while continuing to drink BGG solution to prepare an IgAN experimental mouse model18.\nLet the control group freely drink 6 mmol/L HCl acidified water without BGG for 9 weeks. Inject the corresponding volume of saline into the tail vein for consecutive 3 days.\n\tNOTE: The control and model groups were fed the same quality as normal feed.\nAfter the tail vein injection, select 2 mice in the control group and 2 mice in the model group randomly and examine them by proteinuria, light microscopy, and immunofluorescence to determine whether the modeling was successful.\n\tNOTE: No food is provided to the animals, but they are not prohibited from water; record urine output.\nCollect urine for 24 h by metabolic cages and centrifuge it at 400 x g for 5 min; discard urine sediment. After a 10-fold dilution of the supernatant, measure proteinuria concentration using a urine protein assay kit and then multiply by the dilution factor and urine volume to obtain 24 h of total urine protein.",
    "NOTE: Microscopy and immunofluorescence methods are shown in sections 3 and 4, respectively.\nAfter successfully preparing the model, divide 12 mice in the model group into 6 mice, each in the model group (IgAN group) and DIO gavage group (DIO group), according to the random number table method.\nLet the control group continue to drink 6 mmol/L HCl acidified water without BGG, and the model group 0.1% BGG solution composed of acidified water containing 6 mmol/L HCl.
