    "Notes:  Unless otherwise specified, all steps are conducted outside of a biological safety cabinet (BSC) using aseptic techniques. This protocol assumes nematodes have already been cultured and subsequently colonized with bacteria of interest. This protocol describes obtaining worms from solid nematode growth media (NGM). Worms can also be obtained from a liquid culture. Worm preparation (pre-wash)To remove excess bacteria, pick 12 or more worms from a plate of interest onto a plain, unseeded NGM plate. Let sit for approximately 30 min. It may be necessary to periodically move worms around the plate away from the transferred bacteria, to prevent them from staying in transferred bacteria.Washing worms to remove external bacteriaTransfer 10 worms from the plain NGM plate from Step A1 into 1 mL of M9/levamisole solution.Note: If “Option 2” in Step C will be followed, worms must be placed in a tube that is compatible with the homogenizer machine, such as a 2 mL screw-cap non-skirted tube with a conical bottom. Allow worms to settle to the bottom of the tube and gently aspirate 950 μL of the supernatant.Note: To ensure worms are not aspirated, it is recommended that a dissecting microscope be used to look at the worms during this process. Because large pipette tips can increase the chance of aspirating worms along with the supernatant, it is recommended to remove no more than approximately 800 μL using a 1 mL pipette, followed by removal of 150 μL using a smaller volume pipette and pipette tip, approximately 50 μL at a time. There should be 50 μL remaining in the tube at the end of this step. Perform a gentamicin wash, using 950 μL of gentamicin wash solution. Allow worms to bathe in gentamicin solution for 15-20 min.",
    "Aspirate 950 μL of supernatant following the precautions mentioned in Step B2 “Note”.Repeat Steps B3 and B4.Wash worms with 950 μL of M9/levamisole solution and aspirate 950 μL of the supernatant, following the precautions mentioned in Step B2 “Note”.Repeat Step B6.Perform a third and final wash as described in Step B6, but keep the 950 μL of removed supernatant in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. This will be used to quantify remaining external bacteria, to obtain the actual number of intestinal CFUs in the final calculations.Note: To ensure that no worms were lost during washes, worms should be counted before homogenization. Lysing C. elegans Note: We describe two ways to lyse C. elegans: Option 1 uses a hand-held battery-powered homogenizer, and Option 2 employs an electric benchtop homogenizer. Option 1: Lysing C. elegans using a hand-held homogenizer Note: A video demonstration of “Option 1” Steps 2-3 can be found in Video 1.         <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>         Video 1. Demonstration of whole-worm lysis using a hand-held homogenizer. Add 200 μL of 1% Triton X-100 to the worms and let sit for 5 min. Allow worms to sink to the bottom of the tube. The total volume in each tube should be 250 μL.Push the pestle towards the base of the microcentrifuge tube very gently to avoid resuspending the worms. Mash the worms using as little upward motion as possible. A twisting motion is best to grind worms.Attach a hand-held homogenizer to the pestle without lifting the pestle away from the base of the tube. Grind worms until they appear shredded when viewed under a microscope, such as the Zeiss Stemi. Homogenization time should be kept as consistent as possible between samples. This step often introduces variability due to duration, force, motion, tube, and pestle type.Option 2: Lysing C.",
    "elegans using an electric benchtop homogenizer Add 200 μL of 1% Triton X-100 to the worms and let sit for 5 min. The total volume in each tube should be 250 μL.Add 30 1.5 mm sterile zirconium beads to each tube.Sequentially run at 4,000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 90 s, twice.Note: A video demonstration of the benchtop homogenizer at work can be found in Video 2. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Demonstration of whole-worm lysis using a benchtop homogenizer.Plating for CFUsIn a BSC, perform serial dilutions of saved supernatant from Step B8 and homogenized worm mixture, using sterile PBS. Begin by transferring 200 μL of each undiluted sample into the top row of a 96-well plate and perform at least five tenfold dilutions. Dilutions are performed by taking 20 μL of solution from the previous well and transferring into subsequent wells filled with 180 μL of sterile PBS.Note: If bubbles are present after homogenization, briefly centrifuge tubes to get rid of bubbles. Plate 10 μL of each dilution, as well as non-diluted samples, onto agar plates containing appropriate medium (i.e., LB), let dry, and place upside down at 37°C. The incubation time will depend on the bacteria used, but usually 16-24 h incubation is sufficient.Note: plate a minimum of three internal replicates per sample. Enumerating CFUsCount the number of CFUs from each 10 μL spot and record the corresponding row. Calculations and analysis can be found in “Data analysis”."
