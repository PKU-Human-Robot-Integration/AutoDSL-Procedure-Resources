    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn this protocol, we describe all steps from cochlea fixation, en bloc EM staining, resin embedding, targeted sample trimming to SBEM data acquisition (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/628-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the workflow of sample preparation for SBEM imaging\nThe procedure includes cochlea perfusion, fixation, decalcification, EM staining, dehydration, sample embedding and trimming.\nFixation and decalcification of mouse cochlea\nTiming: 1 day\nFixative preparation\nPrepare the fixative and the EDTA solution. Cool the solutions on ice before use.\nCritical: PFA, glutaraldehyde and cacodylate buffer should be handled in a fume hood while wearing protective gloves and a lab coat.\nCochlea perfusion\nAnesthetize the animal by intraperitoneal injection of 5% chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg body weight).\nDissect the auditory bulla from both sides after decapitation.\nImmerse the tissue in ice-cold cacodylate buffer (0.15M, pH 7.4).\nOpen both round and oval windows with fine-tip forceps under a dissecting microscope.\nPerfuse the cochlea with 1 mL ice-cold fixative by a flat-headed needle (23 G) through the round and oval windows at a constant flow rate (800 μL/min) using a perfusion pump. Repeat three times (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/628-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cochlea perfusion\n(A) Setups used for cochlea perfusion in a fume hood, including a perfusion pump and a dissecting microscope.\n(B and C) Perfusion ice-cold fixative at a constant flow rate (800 μL/min) through oval (B) and round window (C) with a flat-headed needle.\nRemove surrounding muscle tissue with dissecting tweezer (optional).\nTransfer the perfused cochlea into 5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with ice-cold fixative.\nStore at 4°C for 5 h.\nCritical: Perfusion should be done in a fume hood while wearing protective gloves and a lab coat.\nCritical: Handle the tissue carefully and always keep it immersed in ice-cold solution for optimal ultrastructure preservation.",
    "Note: Don’t cut apart the cochlea from the auditory bulla, which contains landmarks for determining the cochlea orientation.\nNote: This protocol is dedicated for whole-cochlea-wide preservation of nerve structures, thereby a relative high perfusion pressue is used to ensure fast and homogenous fixation, which however may cause damage of fine filamentous structures at the hair cell tips.\nDecalcification\nTransfer the sample to a 5 mL Eppendorf tube filled with the 5% EDTA solution.\nKeep it immersed in the EDTA solution. Store at 4°C for another 5 h.\nNote: In our experience, short decalcification duration leads to inhomogeneous staining/embedding due to poor tissue permeability for stain and resin, whereas prolonged incubation causes severe membrane extraction.\nNote: Consider replacing EDTA solution one or two times during the decalcification when incomplete calcification is noticed.\nPause Point: The fixed and decalcified samples can be stored in 0.15M cacodylate buffer at 4°C up to 2 days.\nEn bloc staining of cochlea for SBEM\nTiming: 1.5 days\nIn this step, we describe the optimized staining protocol which is slightly modified from the previously reported procedure for preparing large-size brain tissue (Hua et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nWash the samples twice with 0.15M cacodylate buffer for 30 min each.\nImmerse in 2% buffered OsO4 solution at 20°C–24°C for 2 h.\nTransfer to 2.5% buffered ferrocyanide solution at 20°C–24°C for 2 h.\nTransfer to 2% buffered OsO4 solution at 20°C–24°C for 1.5 h.\nWash with 0.15M cacodylate buffer for 30 min and then with Millipore water for 30 min.\nIncubate in 1% TCH solution at 20°C–24°C for 1 h.\nWash with Millipore water twice for 30 min each.\nIncubate in 2% OsO4 aqueous solution at 20°C–24°C for 2 h.\nWash with Millipore water twice for 30 min each.",
    "Pause Point: The sample can be stored at 4°C up to 12 h.\nIncubate in freshly prepared lead aspartate solution at 50°C for 2 h.\nWash twice at 20°C–24°C with Millipore water for 30 min each.\nNote: The staining of cochlea sample is carried out in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with different staining solutions. Sample transfer between tubes via disposable Pasteur pipettes.\nDehydration and resin embedding of cochlea\nTiming: 2 days, 3 days curing\nIncubate the sample sequentially in a graded acetone-water mixture.\n50%, 75%, 90% acetone at 4°C for 30 min each.\nPure acetone three times at 20°C–24°C for 30 min each.\nNote: Pre-cool 50%, 75%, 90% acetone to 4°C before use.\nTransfer the sample in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1:1 mixture of acetone and Spurr resin. Mix at 20°C–24°C for 6 h on a rotator (speed: 5 rpm) with the tube horizontally placed along the rotation axis.\nTransfer to a tube containing 1:2 mixture of acetone and Spurr resin at 20°C–24°C on rotator (tilted 60 degree from the horizontal plane, speed: 5 rpm). Keep the tube open to allow slow evaporation of the solvent for about 12 h.\nTransfer to a tube containing pure Spurr resin and incubate at 20°C–24°C for 8–12 h. Keep the tube closed.\nNote: Use freshly prepared resin. Freeze and thaw cycles may introduce water into the resin.\nTransfer the sample to embedding mold and fill up with resin.\nIncubate in a pre-warmed oven at 60°C for 24 h.\nIncubate in the oven at 70°C for 48–72 h.\nNote: Please see the hues of staining solutions and resins used in this protocol (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/628-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "From left to right: 2% buffered OsO4 solution, 2.5% buffered ferrocyanide solution, 2% buffered OsO4 solution, 1% TCH solution, 2% OsO4 aqueous solution, lead aspartate solution, 1:1 mixture of acetone and Spurr resin and pure Spurr resin.\nFast sample preview and inspection using X-ray microscopy\nTiming: 1–2 days\nIn this section, we describe how to identify the region of interest based on X-ray microscopy (XRM) data.\nSample mounting and trimming for X-ray microscopy.\nUse a scalpel or razor blade to carefully cut off blank resin from the sample block. Mount the sample (upright along the conical center axis of cochlea) on an aluminum metal rivet (Gatan) with two-component epoxy adhesive (UHU) for at least 12 h (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/628-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Slow trimming with caution is recommended to avoid sample damage.\nNote: This mounting direction is preferred for the ease of sample rotation in the X-ray microscope.\nNote: Small sample dimension allows short distance between sample and the detector which is crucial to yield optimal resolution with the X-ray microscope.",
    "Scan the sample with a high-resolution X-ray microscope (Zeiss, Xradia 520 Versa) at a pixel size of <4.5 μm, source voltage 60 kV, power 5 W and exposure time per radiograph of 1 sec. We recommend acquiring >1001 radiographs.\nImport the reconstructed XRM dataset into 3D image processing software (XM3DViewer, Zeiss or Dragonfly, ORS Inc.) to visualize the 3D volumetric data (Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2])\nLocate the region of interest using Dragonfly software:\nAnnotate the whole extent of the basilar membrane using the built-in annotation tool.\nLabel the locations of the frequency range of interest according to the reported place-frequency map of the mouse cochlea (Muller et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nDraw a bounding box around the locations of interest and measure the relative distances to the air-resin interfaces.\nNote: The angle and distance measurements from the regions of interest to the air-resin interfaces is used to design a trimming plan in the subsequent sample preparation step.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S1.

Scale bar, 100 μm.\nSerial block-face electron microscopy\nTiming: 2 days up to few months\nSample re-orientation: Use a razor blade to remove the sample from the aluminum metal rivet (after XRM scanning). Mount the cochlea sample (the conical center axis of cochlea in horizontal direction) on an aluminum metal rivet with two-component epoxy adhesive (UHU) for at least 12 h (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Expose the tissue block at the selected region of interest by trimming from sample top surface using a trimmer (Leica, TRIM2) equipped with diamond knife head (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nSample pre-scan using SEM (recommended)\nNote: It is recommended at this step to evaluate the sample quality in terms of membrane contrast and ultrastructure preservation before investing time in sample trimming and initiating SBEM acquisition.\nCoat the sample with 10-nm-thick carbon layer using a sputter coater (Ted Pella, 208C) and ground by connecting the sample surface with a carbon adhesive tape to the aluminum pin holder.\nScan the block-face by a SEM (GeminiSEM 300, Zeiss) equipped with a back-scattered electron detector.\nNote: Block-face smoothing with an ultramicrotome is recommended for high-resolution imaging.\nNote: Stitch via image processing tool (e.g., open-source stitching plug-in in Fiji using global optimization (Preibisch et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])), when both large field of view and high resolution are desired (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/628-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Scale bar, 200 μm.\n(C) Electron micrograph of the same region imaged at 30 × 30 nm2 pixel size. Scale bars, 200 μm.\nTrim down the sample block from the vertical sides by setting the specimen arm to 90 degree facing the sample milling direction in the trimmer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: The maximum sample width allowed at our SBEM setup is 1.2 mm.\nSmooth the block-face by the ultramicrotome (Leica, EM UC7) equipped with a diamond trimming knife (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).",
    "Note: A block-face with minimum tilt from the horizontal plan can save cutting cycles with in-chamber ultramicrotome, and thereby prolong the SBEM kinfe lifetime. This is recommended, considering the high price and complexity of SBEM knife exchange.\nCoat the sample with a 30-nm-thick gold layer using a sputter coater (Leica, EM ACE600).\nInitiate SBEM imaging\nCenter and secure the sample block in the in-chamber ultramicrotome (Gatan, 3View2XP) via adjusting and tightening screws on the aluminum pin holder.\nElevate the sample holder to carefully advance the sample block-face toward the ultramicrotome knife by monitoring the knife shadow on the block-face. Cut with max. 80 nm step size, until the gold layer is completely removed from the block-face.\nPosition the gas injection carbon needle of the focal charge compensation device (FCC, (Deerinck et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])) so that gas flow is directly pointing towards the block-face from a minimum distance (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/628-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Effect of FCC on minimizing sample charging\n(A) Arrangement of an in-chamber ultramicrotome with FCC device. Constant nitrogen gas flow is directed by a carbon needle (red arrow) towards the sample block-face.\n(B) Magnified view of the FCC carbon needle above the sample block-face.\n(C) Electron micrograph of the organ of Corti without FCC application. Note charge accumulation at pure resin area and structures like tectorial membrane (TM) and supporting cells (SCs).\n(D) Electron micrograph from the same region as in C under the same imaging condition but with FCC. Scale bar, 20 μm.\nSet SBEM imaging parameters and start data acquisition.",
    "Note: Large single-tile image (20,000 × 15,000 pixels) of 11 nm pixel size and nominal cutting thickness of 40 nm was recently achieved (Hua et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Wang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Incident beam energy 2 keV; dwell time 1 μs; FCC gas flow was set to 100% with a chamber pressure of ~ 2.8 × 10−3 mbar.\nNote: The effect of FCC application minimizes charging artifacts (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D). An alternative approach to reduce charging artifacts is low-vaccum mode SBEM acquisition by inducing nitrogen or water-vapor. Compared to the FCC method, low-vacuum mode SBEM imaging, however, has lower signal detection efficiency.\nNote: The FCC gas flow should be set just sufficient to cancel the charging artifacts, as gas injection reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of electron detection.\nNote: Although the data acquisition of SBEM operates in a fully automated fashion, manual refocusing is required once a day on average based on our experience.\nNote: Due to the spiral nature of cochlear basilar membrane, field of view adjustment is requried to follow the target structures during large image stack acquisition."
