    "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay\nCrosslinking and sample collection\n1. Collect approximately 5 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells from a exponentially growing yeast culture\n  \n2. Crosslink the cells by adding formaldehyde 1% \\(v/v) to the growth medium and incubate 15 min \n  \n3. Stop crosslinking adding glycine 125 mM and incubate during 5 minutes \n  \n4. Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4000xg and washed four times with 25 mL of cold TBS buffer at 4ºC\n  \n5. Cells can be stored at -20ºC \n  \nInmunoprecipitation\n6. Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of Lysis buffer\n  \n7.  Lyse the cells by vortexing with glass beads for 30 min at 4°C with Genie-2 \\(Scientific Ind.) and supplement with lysis buffer to a final volume of 600 μL\n  \n8. Fragment the chromatin by sonication using a BioRuptor Diagenode with discontinuous pulses during 10 min \n  \n9. Centrifuge the sample at 13400xg for 15 min at 4°C \n  \n10. Keep 20 μL from the supernatant as a control of whole-cell extract \\(Input)\n  \n11. Incubate the remaining volume with orbital rotation for 2 h at 4°C with Dynabeads Protein G \\(Invitrogen) previously bound to a specific antibody\n  \n12. Wash the beads 4 times in PBS containing 0.02% \\(v/v) Tween 20 \n  \n13. Elute the bound protein with two times 40 μL of Elution buffer by heating at 65°C for 8 min\n  \nDeproteinization, DNA purification and qRT-PCR\n14.  Revert the cross-linking by overnight incubation at 65°C shaking \n  \n15. Digest the eluted sample for 90 min at 37°C with 0.33 mg/mL proteinase K \\(Roche Diagnostics)\n  \n16. Purify the DNA using the High Pure PCR product purification kit \\(Roche Diagnostics)\n  \n17. Analyse the co-immunoprecipitated DNA in triplicate by quantitative PCR in a DNA Engine Peltier Termal Cycler \\(Bio Rad) using the SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM Tli RNase H Plus Green with ROX \\(Takara)",

Binding values indicates the specific enrichment of the analysed promoter region in the immunoprecipitated sample compared to the whole cell extract \\(Input) using the intergenic region as a control, calculated with the ΔΔCT method. Values are relative to the no tag control strain \\(value of 1 equivalent to no specific enrichment of the analysed region)\n  \nSchmittgen, T.D. and Litvak, K.J. \\(2008) Analyzing real-time PCR data by the comparative CT method.
