    "This protocol describes the clinical procedure which is an ‘add-on’ to standard IVF treatment. It should be performed by experienced personnel in compliance with good laboratory practice and clinical guidelines24,25. Obtaining written informed consent of from the eligible patients is recommended. This protocol was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee.\n1. Egg retrieval and denudation\nInduce ovarian stimulation using conventional stimulation protocols3. Adjust the dose to individual response. When two or more follicles, visualized by ultrasound scan, reach a diameter of 18 mm, induce oocyte maturation with application of 250 μg human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Schedule oocyte pick-up (OPU) at 35−36 h post hCG injection.\nCollect retrieved cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in CO2-independent handling medium (Table of Materials). Following a short incubation period (10−15 min) in a CO2-independent incubator, briefly (up to 30 s) expose collected COCs to hyaluronidase solution (Table of Materials). Under a stereomicroscope, mechanically remove cumulus-corona cells by gently pipetting COCs with a 200 µL filter tip.\nUsing denudation micropipettes with a gradually decreasing diameter (200 µm, 180 µm and 150 µm), gently strip the oocytes from the remaining follicular cells and wash the oocytes 3x in handling medium.\nAssess the number and developmental status of the denuded oocytes according to the presence or absence of the nucleus and first PB (Figure 1).\nCheck the inclusion criteria for PLM examination. Carry out an egg maturity assessment if there is (1) an unexpected poor response to conventional stimulation with fewer than 6 MII oocytes collected at OPU and (2) a history of previous fertilization failure or oocyte immaturity.\nPlace GV, MI and MII oocytes into separate wells in an IVF dish, each containing 500 µL of preequilibrated CO2-dependent culture medium (Table of Materials) covered with mineral oil (Table of Materials).",
    "Incubate for an additional 3−4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% O2 and 6% CO2.\n2. Preparation for PLM examination and subsequent ICSI\nNOTE: The protocol provided here describes the PLM assessment performed using the OCTAX Polar AIDE system (Table of Materials). Alternatively, other commercially available spindle view systems can be used.\nPrepare plates for embryo cultivation.\n\t\nDepending on the number of oocytes to be examined (total of MII oocytes, and MI oocytes extruding a PB during preincubation period), prepare either a 4-well plate or a 12-well plate, fill each well with 500 µL or 30 µL of culture medium, respectively, and cover with previously equilibrated mineral oil.\nEnsure that both culture medium and mineral oil have been equilibrated in the CO2 incubator overnight. Keep the prepared dish in the CO2-dependent incubator for at least 2 h. Number the wells if necessary to track the developmental fate of individual oocytes.\nPrepare the ICSI dish.\n\t\nUse assigned plastic dish and make 5 µL droplet of prewarmed handling medium for each PB-displaying oocyte and one extra droplet for needle washing. Make an additional droplet of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution (Table of Materials) for sperm immobilization prior to ICSI (add sperm just before ICSI) and overlay with prewarmed mineral oil.\nKeep the prepared ICSI dish in the CO2-independent incubator for at least 20 min. Number the wells if necessary to track the oocytes after ICSI.\nPrepare the PLM examination dish.\n\t\nUse assigned glass bottom dish and make 5 µL droplets of prewarmed handling medium for each PB-displaying oocyte. Overlay with prewarmed mineral oil.\nKeep the dish in the CO2-independent incubator for at least 20 min. Number the droplets if necessary to track the oocytes after PLM examination.\nSet the microscope ready for PLM examination.",
    "Switch the heated stage on the inverted microscope on well in advance to achieve correct warming temperature. Ensure that the settings are accurately adjusted to maintain 37 °C in the handling medium droplets in the PLM/ICSI dish during micromanipulation procedures.\nFit the sterile holding and ICSI needle into microinjection holders and bring them into focus. Alternatively, use a hatching needle.\nSelect the appropriate objective (20x and 25x are the most suitable) and ensure that the condenser is in bright field position.\nInsert green interference filter (the light turns green) and set the liquid crystal analysis slider into working position.\nSet the shutter to ~50% and adjust circular polarizer to decrease background noise.\nSet the computer ready for PLM examination.\n\t\nLaunch the imaging software.\nSelect Video | Video Source | polarAIDE in the video menu in the top menu bar.\nSwitch to live video by going to the Video page and activate spindle and zona analysis by hitting on the icon (Supplemental Figure 1) in the video toolbar.\nSelect display mode for dynamic scaling during spindle imaging: (1) red (birefringence)/green (background) combined view, or (2) white (birefringence)/and black (background) view. The dynamic scoring mode is used for autoscoring of zona pellucida.\n3. Examination of egg maturity\nAfter the preincubation period (3−4 h), perform a PLM examination revealing the oocyte maturity status at the standard time of ICSI (39−40 h after hCG trigger).\nTransfer all oocytes into individual droplets on the PLM dish and place it under the inverted microscope prepared for spindle imaging. Remember to remove the plastic lid from the glass bottom dish before starting the examination.\nBring the first oocyte into focus. If it is difficult to search for the cell under green light, pull out the green filter temporarily. Make sure the green filter is inserted before analysis.",
    "Observe the detected oocyte birefringence image (red/orange on green background) as it is computer-processed and displayed in real time on the computer screen. Remember that the signal is not visible in the eyepiece.\nIf the message announcing light exposure is too low/high pops up, adjust the brightness to the suitable intensity using the microscope’s light intensity knob.\nUse a holding and ICSI needle to turn the oocyte so the PB is in the 12 o’clock position and focus to the PB.\nIf the spindle birefringence is not visible at first sight in the vicinity of PB, gently turn the oocyte around each axis by slightly touching the zona pellucida to ensure the alignment of the polarized light with the array spindle fibers (Supplemental Video). Declare the absence of the MII spindle as long as the oocyte fails to show the spindle signal despite rigorous rotation.\nBased on the observed birefringence pattern, classify the oocytes into the following categories (Figure 2): (A) oocytes with bright signal of bipolar barrel-shaped MII spindle with clearly delineated boundaries and even distribution of birefringence; (B) oocytes with dysmorphic, apolar and translucent MII spindle with irregular boundaries and uneven distribution of the signal; (C) oocytes with no detectable MII spindle birefringence in ooplasm;   (D) anaphase I/telophase I oocytes, showing a microtubular bridge (a connective strand between first PB and the oocyte) instead of MII spindle.\n\tNOTE: Oocyte with detectable MII spindle signal (grade A or B) are suitable for immediate ICSI.\nTake a snapshot (F9) or record video for a report and/or subsequent image analysis. Keep documentation of image pattern to reduce subjectivity of the operator.\nMove to the position of a next oocyte and repeat steps 3.6−3.9.\n4. Optimizing ICSI timing",
    "Transfer all spindle-positive oocytes (grade A or B, step 3.8) into the ICSI dish and subject them to ICSI according to standard protocols24,25.\nIf the oocytes show no detectable MII spindle signal, place the PLM dish into the CO2- independent incubator and shift the ICSI into a later time.\nPerform PLM re-examination ~2−3 h later following steps 3.3−3.9. If some oocyte(s) still lack a MII spindle, further delay ICSI for additional 1−2 h.\nTransfer all oocytes into the ICSI dish and inject them according to standard protocols24. If the PLM dish is compatible with the bending angle of the microinjection needle, perform ICSI immediately in the PLM dish after switching to a bright field mode.\nUpon ICSI, transfer oocytes to prepared plates for embryo cultivation and culture until the blastocyst stage."
