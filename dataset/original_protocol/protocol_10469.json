    "1. Generation and Functionalization of Planar SLBs\nMixing of the lipids\n\t\nTo arrive at a 10% DGS NTA-Ni/90% POPC lipid composition dissolve 45 mg of POPC and 6.9 mg DGS NTA-Ni in chloroform in a 250 ml round bottom flask. Keep the volume of chloroform low (just several ml) to evaporate it in the next step. For a 1% DGS NTA-Ni/99% POPC lipid composition use 49.5 mg POPC and 0.69 mg DGS NTA-Ni.\nRemove the chloroform using a rotary evaporator slowly – an increase above ambient temperature is not necessary. Alternatively, blow it off inside a chemical hood in a stream of inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. While doing this constantly turn the flask to allow equal deposition of the drying lipid on the lower half of the round bottom flask.\nOnce the majority of the chloroform is evaporated, attach the flask to vacuum O/N to remove the chloroform quantitatively.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is critical to avoid contamination of proteins and cells with toxic chloroform at later stages and to ensure lipid bilayer fluidity.\nGeneration of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV’s) from dried lipids\n\t​NOTE: Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are between 20 nm and 100 nm in diameter and can be readily produced by bath sonication. Lipid extrusion, an alternative method, can give rise to SUVs and, depending on the pore size of the filter applied for extrusion, also large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), which are 100 nm to 1,000 nm in size. However, SUVs are best suited for forming SLBs.\n\t\nSUVs through bath sonication (shown in the video):\n\t\t\nDegass PBS. Suspend the dried lipid mixture with the 250 ml round bottom flask in 10 ml degassed PBS.",
    "Fill the flask with inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, close it with a stopper and seal the flask with autoclave tape.\nPlace the sealed flask into a bath sonicator and sonicate the lipid suspension at 120 to 170 W until it has turned clear. This takes between 30 and 60 min.\nMonitor the progress of vesicle formation spectro-photometrically: Ensue that the absorption of undiluted emulsion in comparison to PBS remains constant at 234 nm (as an approximate indicator for the lipid concentration) yet should drop significantly at 550 nm (due to reduced light scattering via larger particles).\nTo pellet heavy non-unilamellar vesicles, which interfere with the formation of a contiguous SLB, pellet the vesicle suspension by centrifugation, at 150,000 x g for 1 hr at 25 °C and then for 8 hr at 288,000 x g, 4 °C.\nFilter the supernatant through a syringe filter with a pore diameter of 0.2 µm.\nMeasure the OD at 234 nm and 550 nm to monitor the clarity of the vesicle preparation and the amount of lipid left.\nStore the vesicles at 4 °C under argon or nitrogen. Optionally, use vesicle suspension for bilayer preparation for several months.\nSUVs through lipid extrusion:\n\t\t\nIn brief, pass the lipid suspension several times through a filter with a pore size of 0.1 µm. Regardless of the fabrication method, centrifuge the vesicle suspension twice (1h, 150,000g , 25 °C; then 8h, 4 °C, 288,000 g) to pellet non-unilamellar vesicles which are heavier .\n\t\t\tNOTE: When stored at 4 °C under inert gas, vesicles can be used for bilayer preparation for several months.\nFormation of an SLB and charging with protein\n\t\nTreat 24 x 50 mm #1.5 glass slides with a 3:1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min.",
    "NOTE: Due to the aggressive nature of the mixture take special care, i.e. wear a lab coat and safety goggles as shown in the video!\nRinse glass slides under a stream of ddH2O out of a squirt bottle. Place them on a Teflon stand and let them dry for 10 to 30 min.\nRemove the bottom glass slide of 8 or 16 well chambers, fill the bottom with epoxy glue and carefully place a clean and dry glass slide on the glue-covered chamber bottom. Let the glue harden for about 10 min. Remove excess glue from the bottom.\n\t\tNOTE: A tight seal between the glass slide and the chamber can also be easily achieved with the use of a dental two-component silicone modeling paste, which hardens within 10 to 30 min. This seal is not as firm as epoxy glue but withstands regular physical strain. After the experiment it can be easily removed from the chamber, which is then reusable in future experiments.\nPipette 120 µl (60µl) of a 10-fold PBS-diluted lipid suspension into each well of an 8 (16) - well chamber (prepared as described above) and let the bilayer form for 20 min. Carefully rinse the bilayer twice with 15 ml PBS. Once the bilayer has formed, it must always be submerged in buffer and never be exposed to air.\nFill each well all the way with PBS, then take off 330µl (8-well chamber) or 165µl (16-well chamber). There are 350µl (175µl) left in the well. Add 50µl (25µl) of cocktail containing His-tagged proteins diluted in PBS to each well (400 or 200 µl final) and incubate at RT for 60 min in the dark. The surface protein density can be adjusted by varying the protein concentration during this incubation step.",
    "Rinse each well twice with 15 ml PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, SLBs should be used in experiments no longer than 6 hr after their charging with protein. During this period, fluorophore recovery after photobleaching remains up to 95% and no loss in bilayer-associated protein can be detected. The protein density should be determined prior to the experiment (see below).\nOptional step: To test for non-specific binding of the protein the DGS NTA-Ni containing SLB, wash the SLB once with PBS containing 300 mM imidazole. The protein should come off completely.\n2. Microscope Setup\nFor building a microscopy system capable of detecting the fluorescence of single fluorochromes refer to the recommendations stated in the introduction.\n3. Power Measurements\nNOTE: Fluorophores can be easily saturated with excess excitation light. This accelerates photobleaching with no further gain in emission and should thus be avoided. To optimize sample illumination the excitation power density should be measured directly at the specimen. Such measurements can also serve as a reference for future experiments. Furthermore, knowing the ratio between input and output laser power is helpful when assessing where light is lost in the imaging system.\nMove the excitation beam into the upright position so that it leaves the objective in a 90° angle.\nPlace the head of the power meter on top of the beam and measure the power of the beam (=P). Document the result.\nUsing the periscope, turn the beam into the TIRF position and image an intact homogenous fluorescent bilayer. To avoid bleaching and CCD signal saturation place a neutral density (ND) filter with an optical density (OD) of 2 to 3 into the excitation light path.",
    "Measure the integrated counts of the entire illuminated field (= Itotal). Also, measure the size of the illuminated area (= Atotal). Measure the integrated counts (= ICenter) of the maximally illuminated center spot as well as the size of the spot (= Acenter).\nMeasure the background signal per pixel (=B) either outside the illuminated area or without sample illumination.\nSubtract the background signal from the results measured in 3.). Do this by multiplying the number of pixels of the area in question (whole illuminated area or center spot) with the background counts per pixel. (=Itotal - Atotal .B and Icenter - Acenter .B).\nDivide the integrated and background corrected signal of the center spot by the integrated and background-corrected signal of the entire field of illumination.\n\tNOTE: The result indicates the fraction of total power located within the center spot (= (Icenter - Acenter .B) / (Itotal - Atotal .B) ). Multiplication of this result with the power P measured in 2.) results in the power of light illuminating the center spot.\nDetermine the size of the spot Acenter in µm². For this divide the camera pixel size in µm by the magnification of the objective, take the square of the result as µm² per pixel.\n\t\nAlternatively measure the pixel size within the image with the use of a micrometer slide placed on the microscope and take the square of the result as area per pixel. Multiply this value by the number of pixels located within the center spot to arrive at the illuminated spot area.\nDivide the power P illuminating the center spot by the size of the center spot Acenter,µm² to calculate the illumination intensity per µm2. An example is given in Figure 6.",
    "Power density values measured in non-TIRF illumination are typically lower than those present in TIRF illumination 13, which also depend on the exact angle at which the laser light is totally reflected. To arrive at power densities present under TIRF illumination, image calibrated fluorescent beads of 0.1µm diameter both in non-TIRF and TIRF. The ratio of bead fluorescence intensities measured in TIRF and non-TIRF mode amounts to the conversion factor C, which allows conversion of measured power density values into those effective under TIRF illumination (equation 1).\npower density  TIRF  = C  •  power density  non-TIRF                       (equation 1)\nwith C = bead intensity TIRF / bead intensity non-TIRF\n4. Density Measurements\nDetermine the average signal of individual fluorophores located on a bilayer. Bilayer-attached MHC molecules loaded with fluorescent peptides are ideal for this purpose since the protein:label stoichiometry is exactly one. If necessary bleach all labels on the bilayer in the field of view and let the fluorescence recover to visualize single fluorophores.\n\t\nRecord images in rapid succession (e.g. apply a streaming acquisition protocol) and monitor single molecules mobility over several frames. For more information refer to Figure 7.\nMark the central illumination spot within the bilayer as ROI. Measure the ROI, the variance in illumination power density (which is proportional to the fluorescence intensity) should be ideally less than 15%.",
    "Determine single molecule and bulk fluorescence only within this ROI. Integrate the signal of a ROI, which is large enough to capture 99% or more of the single emitter’s point spread function. When employing a camera with a pixel size of 16-20 µm (stated in the manufacturer’s camera specifications), an objective with 100-fold magnification and a numerical aperture equal to or larger than 1.45, take a region of 7 by 7 pixels with the intensity peak located in the center of the square.\nTo determine the background signal, integrate the counts of a neighboring 7 by 7 pixel square, which does not contain a fluorescence signal. Subtract the background from the single molecule signal to determine the corrected value for single molecule fluorescence. Select only signals, which are still visible in the following frame.\nRepeat step 4.2 fifty to several hundred times. Average the background-corrected signal. If desired, plot single molecule intensity values as a histogram. Optional: take advantage of a suitable plugin of open-source software packages (e.g. ImageJ) or process the data using commercial software (e.g. Metamorph, Molecular Devices). Experienced users may write their own analysis program in Matlab or similar software packages.\nPlace a Neutral Density filter of 2 or higher into the excitation path and take images of a fluorescent bilayer containing proteins labeled with the same fluorophore. Record the average pixel intensity within the same ROI used for single molecule intensity measurements. Record the exposure time of the bulk fluorescence measurements. Measure the same spot without illumination for background subtraction.",
    "To determine the protein density within the bilayer, multiply the background-corrected bulk fluorescence average pixel intensity determined in step 4 by the number of pixels per square micron (e.g. 41.5), by 100 (if an ND filter with an OD of 2 was employed) or 1,000 (if an ND filter with an OD of 3 was used) and the exposure time used in step 2 and divide it by the average single molecule signal determined in step 3, the exposure time used in step 2 and the number of fluorophores per protein.\n5. Testing the Integrity of the Bilayer\nPrepare a fluorescent bilayer and place it on the microscope stage as described above.\nAdjust the focus and take an image of the bilayer in TIRF mode. Apply a short but intense bleach pulse in non-TIRF mode to ablate the fluorescence within a small disk-shaped ROI.\nTake an image of the bilayer in low intensity TIRF mode immediately after bleaching and then every five to ten sec to monitor the speed of fluorescence recovery.\nMove to a different area on the bilayer and follow step 2 and 3. Take another image in low intensity TIRF mode 5 min after the bleach pulse. Determine the intensity Ipost bleach in the bleach area and compare it to the intensity prior to bleaching I0 at the beginning of the experiment (no bleaching should have occurred) to calculate the immobile fraction (IF) as follows:\n\tImmobile Fraction IF (%) = (I0 - Ipost bleach ) / (I0– background) x 100,\n\twith background = measured intensity within the ROI with no excitation light applied\n\tThe IF should be less than 10% (ideally less than 5%)."
