    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFasting mice—day 1\nTiming: 30 min\nPrepare 5–8 mice per group.\nNote: Metabolic assays in mice are diet-, age-, sex-, and strain-sensitive. Thus, it is important to keep these parameters comparable throughout each independent experiment.\nMice are housed with standard light–dark cycle and free access to water. They are fasted overnight for 12–16 h before test in clean cages with new bedding that has no food or feces.\nNote: For fasting, it is very important to remove all food and feces to avoid any pellet and stool intake.\nAMPK activator-induced glucose uptake—day 2\nTiming: 3 h\nStart the procedure at 9 am.\nNote: Metabolic studies should be performed at approximately the same hour during the day because physiological and biochemical parameters change throughout the day.\nPrepare an experimental table for recording body weight (BW), the volumes of the stock solution of MK8722 or A769662 to be injected, and the glucose levels measured at different time points (t = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min).\nWeigh mice and record their BW in the experimental table.\nNote: Handling mice gently to reduce their anxiety which may cause fluctuations in the blood glucose levels.\nThe dosing of MK8722 is 30 mg/kg, and A769662 is 60 mg/kg. Calculate and record in the table the volume of MK8722 or A769662 stock solution needed for intraperitoneal injection according to the BW of each mouse. The formula is as follows:\nVolume of MK8722 injection (μL) = BW (g) × 10 μL/g of 3 mg/mL MK8722 stock solution\nVolume of A769662 injection (μL) = BW (g) × 10 μL/g of 6 mg/mL A769662 stock solution.\nPrepare syringes loaded with the required volume (according to step 6) of stock solution, glucometer, and glucometer sticks for measurements.",
    "Note: Prepare one syringe per mouse with the corresponding volume of MK8722 or A769662 loaded according to its BW. Remove all air bubble from the syringes.\nCut 1–2 mm from the tail tip distal to the bone with a sharp dissection scissor (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/832-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cutting tail tips with a pair of sharp dissection scissors\nDiscard the first drop of blood.\nLet blood flow (2–5 μL) directly into the glucose test stick inserted into the glucometer and record the reading in the experimental table (t = 0).\nNote: The amount of blood drawn from tail vein should be complied with the Institutional Guidelines for animal care and use. At Peking University, the maximum blood volume that may be drawn from a mouse per week is 6 μL/g of body weight.\nInject mice with syringes loaded with MK8722 or A769662.\nNote: Space the injections of each mouse about 1 min apart to avoid overlapping of timings in blood glucose measurement. Make sure the injection is not subcutaneous by injecting at an angle below the visceral area. In obese mice, it is important to avoid fat pads when giving injections.\nStart timer right after injection.\nRepeat steps 10 at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after MK8722 or A769662 injection.\nRecord the glucose values in the experimental table.\nAt the end of the experimental session, clean the mouse tails with sterile pads and place the mice in clean cages with free access to food and water.\nResults are represented as percentage of basal blood glucose level overtime."
