    "1. Prepare Buffers and Reagents\nNOTE: See Table 1.\nPrepare solutions of buffer A, lysis buffer B, sample buffer and digitonin.\n\t\nPrepare buffer A by adding 8.77 g of NaCl and 50 mL of HEPES (1 M, pH 7.4) to 900 mL deionized water, adjust final volume to 1 L with deionized water.\n\t\tNOTE: Final concentrations are 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM HEPES.\nPrepare lysis buffer B by adding 20 mL of HEPES (1 M, pH 7.4), 0.75 g of KCl, 0.19 g of MgCl2, 2 mL of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (0.5 M EDTA), 2 mL of ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (0.5 M EGTA), 38.26 g of mannitol and 23.96 g of sucrose to 900 mL of deionized water, adjust final volume to 1 L with deionized water.\n\t\tNOTE: Final concentrations are 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 210 mM mannitol and 70 mM sucrose.\nPrepare sample buffer by adding 0.01 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to 10 mL of tris-buffered saline (TBS) for a final concentration of 0.1% SDS.\nPrepare a stock solution of digitonin by adding 25 mg of digitonin to 100 mL of deionized water (final concentration is 250 µg/mL).\nStore all buffer solutions at 4 °C and digitonin at -20 °C until the start of experiment.\nPrepare fresh solutions of protease and phosphatase inhibitors to be added to buffer solutions prior to addition to cells.\n\t\nPrepare a stock solution of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) by adding 17.4 mg of PMSF to 1 mL of 100% ethanol (final concentration is 100 mM).",
    "CAUTION: Wear appropriate protective equipment and exercise caution when handling PMSF. PMSF is hazardous if ingested and slightly hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), eye contact (irritant) or inhalation; it is corrosive to eyes and skin.\nPrepare a commercially available protease inhibitor cocktail (100×) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see the Table of Materials).\nPrepare a stock solution of sodium orthovanadate (SOV) by adding 92 mg of SOV to 1 mL of deionized water (final concentration is 500 mM).\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution when handling. SOV is hazardous in case of eye contact (irritant), ingestion or inhalation. Severe over-exposure can result in death.\n2. PBS Wash\nConcentrate and wash cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to fractionation.\n\t\nCentrifuge cell suspension at an appropriate speed to create a pellet. For example, centrifuge a suspension of U937 cells at 400 × g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in room-temperature PBS at a final concentration of 4 × 106 cells/mL and pipette gently to break up clumps.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 10 min to pellet cells.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in ice cold buffer A at a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4 °C or on ice and all buffers should be pre-chilled.\n3. Cytosolic Protein Isolation\nExtract cytosolic proteins by incubation with the detergent digitonin.",
    "Immediately prior to resuspension of cells (step 3.1.3) add 10 µL of stock PMSF (100 mM), 10 µL of protease Inhibitor (100×), 2 µL of stock SOV (500 mM) and 100 µL of stock digitonin (250 µg/mL) to 878 µL of buffer A (final concentrations are 1 mM PMSF, 1× Protease Inhibitor, 1 mM SOV and 25 µg/mL digitonin; adjust the final volume as per the number of cells being used). Keep the solution on ice until addition to cell pellet.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 10 min and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in buffer A solution containing inhibitors and digitonin (prepared in step 3.1.1) at a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/mL, pipette gently to break up clumps.\nIncubate the cell suspension on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 10 min. Collect the supernatant and place it in a clean centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the collected supernatant at 18,000 × g for 20 min to pellet cellular debris.\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube.\nRepeat steps 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 until no pellet is obtained following centrifugation.\nCollect the supernatant containing the cytosolic proteins and store it at 4 °C (short term) or -20 °C (long term).\nRemove excess digitonin and cytosolic proteins by centrifugation.\n\t\nResuspend the digitonin-permeabilized cell pellet (from step 3.1.5) in buffer A at a final concentration of 4 × 106 cells/mL and pipette gently to break up clumps.\nCentrifuge the digitonin-permeabilized cell suspension at 400 × g for 10 min and remove the supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: Repeated washes in buffer A can be performed to remove excess cytosolic contaminants.\n4. Cell Homogenization",
    "Incubate the cells on ice in lysis buffer B and lyse them by mechanical means.\n\t\nImmediately prior to resuspension of cells (step 4.1.2) add 10 µL of stock PMSF (100 mM) and 2 µL of stock SOV (500 mM) to 988 µL of lysis buffer B (final concentrations are 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM SOV; adjust final volume to accommodate number of cells being lysed) and keep solution on ice until addition to cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet (from step 3.2.2) in ice cold lysis buffer B solution containing PMSF and SOV (prepared in step 4.1.1) at a final concentration of 4 × 106 cells/mL.\nIncubate the cell suspension on ice for 30 min.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer (with a tight-fitting B pestle) on ice and perform 40 passes with the homogenizer pestle using slow, even strokes.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively utilize other means of mechanical cell lysis as detailed in discussion section.\nCollect the homogenate and transfer it to a clean centrifuge tube.\nWash the homogenizer pestle and tube with a small volume (1 to 2 mL) of lysis buffer B and add it to the homogenate.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 400 × g (or the minimum speed required to pellet unbroken cells) for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube.\n\t\tNote: If a significant pellet remains repeat steps 4.1.4 through 4.1.6 to increase the yield of fractions as detailed in the discussion section. The protocol can be paused here, and the homogenate stored at 4 °C for short term (24 h).\n5. Differential Centrifugation\nCentrifuge the homogenate at increasing speeds to remove cellular debris, isolate mitochondria and membrane fractions.",
    "Centrifuge the supernatant (from step 4.1.8) at 500 × g for 10 min. Transfer supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube, and discard any pellet.\nCentrifuge supernatant (from step 5.1.1) at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube, and discard any pellet.\nCentrifuge the supernatant (from step 5.1.2) at 2,000 × g for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube, and discard any pellet.\nCentrifuge the supernatant (from step 5.1.3) at 4,000 × g for 15 min. Transfer supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube, keep pellet containing mitochondria.\nResuspend the mitochondria pellet in a small volume (0.5‒1 mL) of lysis buffer B.\nCentrifuge the suspended pellet at 4,000 × g for 15 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the mitochondrial pellet in the desired final volume of sample buffer (e.g., 250 to 500 µL, depending on the size of the pellet and desired concentration).\nCentrifuge the supernatant (from step 5.1.4) at 4,000 × g for 15 min. Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube. Repeat this step until no pellet is obtained following centrifugation.\nSpin the supernatant at 18,000 × g for 3 h.\nRemove the supernatant, and keep the pellet containing membrane proteins.
