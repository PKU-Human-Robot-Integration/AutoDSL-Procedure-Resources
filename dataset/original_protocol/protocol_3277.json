This step details the procedures of the generation of the INTS8-dTAG cell line, including plasmid transduction of DLD-1 cells, single colony selection, PCR validation, and western blotting (WB) validation.\nPlasmid transfection of colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1.\nNote: We used Neon transfection system to perform plasmid transfection of DLD-1. Referring to the Neon manual[href=https://assets.thermofisher.cn/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fneon_device_man.pdf] is recommended for successfully conducting the experiment.\nGrow the DLD-1 cells in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1× Penicillin-Streptomycin in a 10-cm cell culture dish at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nWhen cell confluence reaches 80%, prepare the plasmid pools and control in 1.5 mL EP tubes as suggested in Table 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl12]:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3047_20.csv\nPlate 2 mL antibiotic-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS into 6-well plate per well and pre-warm in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nSet up a Neon Tube with 3 mL Buffer E2 into the Neon Pipette Station.\nSet the pulse conditions (1300 V, 20 ms, 2 pulses) on the Neon device.\nTrypsinize the cells with TrypLE Express.\nAfter neutralization, transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate off the supernatant, resuspend cells in PBS, and count the cell density.\nTransfer 4×106 of the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min and resuspend in 240 μL Resuspension Buffer R.\nAdd 110 μL cells into each 1.5 mL EP tube containing plasmid pools from major step 1.b and gently mix by pipetting.",
    "Use Neon pipette and 100 μL Neon Tips to pipette up the cell-plasmid mixture.\nCritical: Avoid air bubbles during pipetting as air bubbles can lead to lowered or failed transfection\nInsert the Neon Pipette with the sample into the Neon Tube placed in Neon Pipette Station and press “Start” on the screen.\nAfter “Complete” displayed on the screen, slowly remove the Neon Pipette from the Neon Pipette Station, and pipette the cells into the prepared 6-well plate containing prewarmed medium.\nGently rock the plate to ensure the cells are evenly distributed. Incubate the plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nPuromycin selection\nDiscard the medium and trypsinize the cells with 0.5 mL TrypLE Express per well at 37°C for 5 min.\nAfter neutralization with 1 mL complete medium, transfer the cells suspension into 10 mL complete medium in a 10 cm culture dish.\nAdd puromycin to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL.\nGently rock the plate to ensure the cells and puromycin are evenly distributed.\nCulture the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange fresh medium supplemented with 1 μg/mL puromycin every 2 days.\nNote: During puromycin selection, observe the cells under microscope every day. Typically, after 10 days of puromycin selection, control cells die completely, and sample cells in the sample dish form tens to hundreds of single-cell colonies that are large enough to pick up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3047-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative images of selected DLD-1 single-cell colonies after 10 days of puromycin treatment\nScale bar: 500 μm (left) and 200 μm (right).\nSingle-cell colony selection (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nAfter 10 days of puromycin selection, remove the medium of the sample dish, and wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd 15 mL PBS to the sample dish.",
    "Prepare a 96-well plate with 20 μL TrypLE Express in each well.\nPut the sample dish on the microscope stage, pick a colony into a well of prepared 96-well plate under the 4× objective with 10 μL tip, and mix by pipetting more than 10 times.\nRepeat major step 1.3.d for 16 times.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 5 min in a 5% CO2 incubator to trypsinize the cells.\nAdd 150 μL complete medium to neutralize, and gently mix by pipetting.\nPick 48 to 96 colonies in total by repeating major step 1.3.d to major step 1.3.g.\nCulture the cells in the 96-well plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: After this step, the cells from a single colony are evenly divided into the corresponding wells of two 96-well plates, one of which is used to continue culturing the cells, and the other is used for PCR validation.\nPCR validation of INTS8-dTAG homozygous knockin cells\n2–4 days after single-cell colony picking, remove the medium, trypsinize the cells in each well with 30 μL TrypLE.\nAdd 200 μL complete medium to neutralize, gently mix by pipetting, and transfer 115 μL cells to another 96-well plate for PCR validation.\nNote: After this step, the cells from a single colony are evenly divided into the corresponding wells of two 96-well plates, one of which is used to continue culturing the cells, and the other is used for PCR validation.\nOne day after subculturing, remove the medium of the PCR validation plate and add 50 μL lysis buffer to each well.\nAfter sealing the 96-well plate with a sealing film, digest the cells for 1 h in a 55°C oven.",
    "After the cell lysates cool down to room temperature (25°C), gently mix the cell lysate in each well by pipetting and transfer to 8-strip tubes.\nInactivate the proteinase K at 95°C for 12 min.\nDuring this time, prepare genotyping PCR master mix following Table below (Table 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl13]) and dispense 9.5 μL aliquot to 96 PCR tubes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3047_21.csv\nAfter the cell lysates cool down to room temperature (25°C), transfer 0.5 μL of each lysate to the master mix in corresponding PCR tubes.\nPerform PCR reaction with the following parameters (Table 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl14]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3047_22.csv\nRun 5 μL PCR product of each colony on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.\nTake an image of the gel, the PCR product of the knockin allele will display at the size of 1609 bp while the PCR product of the WT allele will display at the size of 430 bp (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Record the numbers of homozygous knockin colonies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3047-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. PCR validation of the integration of the dTAG into N-terminal INTS8 encoding genomic locus\n(A) schematic representation of genotyping primers targeting locus.\n(B) Representative agarose gel separating colony PCR amplicons.\nShip the remaining PCR product of PCR-validated homozygous knockin colonies to Boshang Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. And perform Sanger DNA sequencing with hINTS8_genomic_F and hINTS8_genomic_R.\nFurther validation by WB (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nSubculture PCR validated clones in the 96-well plate to 24-well plates.\nAfter reaching 80% confluency, for each colony, subculture to 3 wells of a 24-well plate. Cells in one of the wells continue culturing and cells in the other two wells are used for WB validation after dTAG-13 treatment.\nOne day after subculturing, for each clone, treat cells with DMSO or 100 nM dTAG-13 for 3 h.\nRemove the medium, wash cells once with PBS, then add 50 μL 1× Protein Loading Buffer per well.",
    "Shake to thoroughly lyse the cells and transfer to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nBoil the protein lysates for 9 min.\nRun protein on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nTransfer proteins to nitrocellulose membrane.\nBlock the membrane with 1× Blocking Buffer for 10 min.\nIncubate the membrane with primary antibodies diluted in Primary Antibody Dilution Buffer overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.\nWash the membrane with 1× TBST for 15 min. Repeat this washing step twice more.\nIncubate the membrane with secondary antibodies diluted in TBST for 1 h at room temperature (25°C).\nWash the membrane with 1× TBST for 15 min. Repeat this washing step twice more.\nDetect the signal of INTS8 and vinculin after treatment with High-sig ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3047-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Vinculin is a loading control. Stars represent non-specific bands.\nExpand the WB-validated and Sanger DNA sequencing-validated colonies.\nTake one validated colony to continue to generate the INTS8-dTAG+ΔN cell line.\nNote: Validated colonies should satisfy nearly complete deletion of INTS8 and corrected knockin on INTS8 N-terminal genomic locus.\nGeneration of INTS8-dTAG+ΔN cell line\nTiming: 10–14 days\nIn this section, we describe the procedures of expressing N-terminus deletion INTS8 in the generated INTS8-dTAG cells.\nSeed 5 × 105 INTS8-dTAG cells per well into 2 wells of a 6-well plate.\nAfter reaching 70–80% confluency, transduce the cells with lentivirus.\nRemove the medium.\nAdd 1 mL fresh medium, 1 mL lentivirus, and 1.5 μL polybrene to the sample well. Add 2 mL fresh medium to the control well.\nIncubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nReplace medium containing lentivirus with 2 mL fresh medium.",
    "Continue to incubate the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h.\nBlasticidin selection.\nDiscard the medium and trypsinize the cells with 0.5 mL TrypLE Express per well at 37°C for 5 min.\nAfter neutralization with 1 mL complete medium, transfer the cells suspension into 10 mL complete medium in a 10 cm culture dish.\nAdd blasticidin to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL.\nGently rock the plate to ensure the cells and puromycin are evenly distributed.\nCulture the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange fresh medium supplemented with 10 μg/mL blasticidin every 2 days until the cells in the control dish are all killed.\nFrozen the antibiotic-selected cells for long-term storage.\nNote: Typically, 10 days of antibiotic selection is enough to kill all untransduced cells.\nValidate INTS8-ΔN expression and upregulation of global Pol II phosphorylation level by WB (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nSubculture the antibiotic-selected cells in two wells of a 6-well plate.\nTreat cells with DMSO or 100 nM dTAG-13 for 3 h.\nRemove the medium, wash cells once with PBS, then add 150 μL 1× protein loading buffer per well.\nPerform the WB processes according to major step 1.5.e to 1.5.n with primary antibodies of INTS8, Rpb1, pSer2, pSer5, and Vinculin (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3047-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
