    "Quality control samples Ensure that appropriate controls are in place prior to extracting the samples. Required controls include:Blank solution without internal standards (methanol vehicle only).Blank solution with internal standards (75 μL of methanol vehicle spiked with 25 μL of internal standard mix).Pooled quality control samples, made by pooling at least 10% of samples in a large batch study, or an equal volume of each sample into a single tube. These pooled quality control replicates are run regularly over the entire batch, so that any variations can be monitored across the entire run. This is especially important for large study samples that are performed over multiple days.Extraction procedure Thaw liver homogenates atop ice; then, pipette 25 μL of each liver homogenate to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.Add 283 μL of deionized H2O to 25 μL of liver homogenate and allow the sample to stand on ice for 10 min.Pipette 581 μL of MeOH to the mixture.Pipette 262 μL of CH2Cl2 to the mixture.Cap the tube and vortex the mixture vigorously for 5 s at maximum speed.Ensure that the mixture consists of only one single phase. If two distinct phases are observed, add 25 μL of MeOH and vortex, and then check to ensure that a single phase is formed. Otherwise, continue adding 25 μL of MeOH and vortex until a single phase is seen.Add 25 μL of the premixed lipid internal standard, then vortex and incubate the mixture for 30 min at room temperature.Pipette 291 μL of deionized H2O to the mixture.Pipette 262 μL of CH2Cl2 to the mixture.Gently invert tubes 10 times. DO NOT VORTEX the tube; otherwise, an emulsion will be formed (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Inversion of tube Pre-chill centrifuge to 4 °C.

Transfer of organic layer Pipette 581 μL of CH2Cl2 to the remaining extracts in the tube.Mix by gently inverting 10 times, centrifuge, and then transfer the lower organic layer to the tube from step 12.Evaporate solvent using a nitrogen blower.Reconstitute the extracted lipids in 100 μL of MeOH.LC method and parameters Chromatographic separation of lipid classes is achieved using a normal-phase column by gradient elution of a 24-min timeframe. The elution order of solutes in normal-phase separation is governed by polarity, with solutes of lower polarity eluting first. Therefore, as a general rule, lipid species within each subclass elute in the order of decreasing chain length (i.e., longer chains elute first) and increasing degree of unsaturation of the fatty acyl groups (i.e., species with more double bonds elute later). The stationary phase (HILIC column) and mobile phases (A and B) are described below:• Stationary phase: XBridge Amide 3.5 μm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm column.• Mobile phase A: 1 mM ammonium acetate in 95% acetonitrile.• Mobile phase B: 1 mM ammonium acetate in 50% acetonitrile (pH to be adjusted by adding ammonium hydroxide).One should remember to add ammonium hydroxide to adjust the pH of mobile phase B to match the pH of mobile phase A. This is an important step because the retention times on a HILIC column are very sensitive to the pH changes in the mobile phase.The LC parameters are shown below:• Gradienttable:",

    "• Oven temperature = 35 °CMS method and parameters The method utilizes MRM quantification approach in a triple quadrupole LC-MS instrument to ensure high selectivity of lipid species. Positive ion mode is used to detect SM/CER/DCER/HCER/LCER/TAG/DAG/MAG, while negative ion mode is used to detect PC/PE/PG/PI/PS/FFA.In MRM, the lipids that have been ionized are scanned in Q1, fragmented to produce product ions in Q2 (also known as the collision cell), and these product ions are scanned in Q3. The first (Q1) and the last (Q3) mass analyzers of the triple quadrupole instrument are used as mass filters to isolate a precursor ion and a corresponding product ion for each lipid species. Generally, the product ions included in this method are either characteristic of the headgroup or the backbone of each lipid class, or they are specific for one of the fatty acids attached to the lipid species. For example, sphingomyelins undergo fragmentation to yield a phosphorylcholine head group as its product ion at m/z 184 (Chen et al., 2010). Ceramides other than sphingomyelins fragment at their sphingoid base backbones to produce either sphingosine at m/z 264 (CER, HCER) or sphinganine at m/z 266 (e.g., DCER, LCER) as their product ions (Chen et al., 2010). Cholesterol esters yield the cholesterol moiety as its product ion at m/z 369.4 (Yu et al., 2014). The phospholipids (PC, PE, PG, PI, PS, LPC, LPE, LPG, LPI, and LPS) fragment to yield one of the fatty acid chains as its product ion (Pi et al., 2016). Fragmentation of glycerolipids (e.g., TAG, DAG, MAG) produces a neutral loss corresponding to one of the fatty acyl chains.Besides Q1 and Q3 transitions, the mass spectrometry method has to be optimized for collision energy and other parameters.",
    "Table A1 in the appendix shows the MRM parameters for each of the lipid metabolites. These parameters will need to be re-optimized in different triple quadrupole instruments.The MRM scans are scheduled, which means that the instrument only scans for each Q1/Q3 transitions at a specific window, corresponding to the time when the particular lipid class elutes. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the MS peak of interest does not drift out of the scan window as a result of retention time shifts (usually due to changes in mobile-phase composition or column aging). Thus, every time after column or solvent changeovers, it is important to check the retention time to ensure that accurate and appropriate scan windows are set for each lipid of interest. The importance of this is highlighted in other lipidomics protocols as well (Mukhamedova et al., 2020). A typical chromatogram of the representative lipid standards is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4773/bioprotoc-13-13-4773-g002.jpgFigure 2.
