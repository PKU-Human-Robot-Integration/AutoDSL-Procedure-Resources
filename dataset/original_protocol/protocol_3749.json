    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAmplification of targeting library\nTiming: 3 days\nCheck the efficiency of competent cells.\nTake out the GeCKO v2 library of plasmid and competent cells stored at −80°C and thaw them on ice. Pre-cold the 20-mm electroporation cuvette on ice. Pre-warm the SOC medium without ampicillin and the SOC agar plate (150 mm × 25 mm dish) containing 0.2 mg/mL ampicillin at a 37°C water bath and 37°C incubator for 30 min before the electroporation, respectively.\nAdd 1 ng of plasmid into 50 μL competent cells in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Mix gently by pipetting and avoid bubbles.\nQuickly transfer the mixture into the pre-cold 20-mm electroporation cuvette and avoid bubbles.\nUse kimwipers to dry the surface of the cuvette. Place the cuvette in the Gene Pulser Xcell System, and electroporate the plasmid into the competent cells under the conditions as follows: Capacitance = 25 μF, Resistance = 200 Ω, Voltage = 2.5 kV.\nTake out the cuvette from the Gene Pulser Xcell System and put it on ice for 2 min.\nTransfer 2 μL transformation product into 500 μL pre-warmed SOC medium without ampicillin in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and mix well.\nShake the Eppendorf tube with the transformation product in a shaker incubator at 37°C with a speed of 180 r/min for 1 h for cell recovery.\nSpread the mixture onto the pre-warmed SOC agar plate containing ampicillin.\nIncubate the plate in a 37°C incubator for 30 min, and continue to incubate for 14 h with the plate up-side-down.\nCount the number of colonies generated in the SOC agar plate by ImageJ software. The efficiency of the competent cells is defined as the number of counted colonies × 2.5×104 colony-forming units (CFU)/μg plasmid.",
    "Note: We use commercially available competent cells, which generate 3.614×104 clones in 2 μL transformation product, and the efficiency of the competent cells is 9.035×108 CFU/μg plasmid.\nCalculate the volume of competent cells and the number of SOC agar plates required for sgRNA library expansion.\nNote: The A pool of GeCKO v2 library contains 65,383 sgRNAs. We expect each sgRNA will be amplified for 100 times in general, and thus the A pool library should yield 6.5×106 colonies after transformation. During the testing, 1 ng plasmids transformed into 50 μL high-efficiency competent cells produce 9.035×105 colonies, and expansion of the A pool library needs a total of 400 μL competent cells (8 vials) and 180 SOC agar plates. The method for calculation is also suitable for expansion of the B pool of GeCKO v2 library or other screening libraries.\nElectroporate the targeting sgRNA library into competent cells.\nElectroporate 1 ng of the targeting sgRNA library into 50 μL of competent cells at exactly the same conditions set at step 1d. Put the transformation product into 10 mL pre-warmed SOC medium without ampicillin for cell recovery as step 1 g.\nPerform electroporation one by one if multiple electroporation steps are required. For each electroporation, spread the transformation mixture onto 22–23 SOC agar plates containing ampicillin.\nCollect colonies.\nAdd 5 mL SOC medium with ampicillin onto each SOC agar plate.\nGently scrape the colonies by a cell spreader, and transfer the bacteria suspension into a sterilized 2 L beaker.\nWash the plate with another 5 mL SOC medium containing ampicillin, and collect the bacteria suspension into the beaker.\nExpansion of bacteria.\nSeparate the bacteria suspension into 10 conical flasks (500 mL) evenly.\nShake the conical flasks in a shaker incubator at 37°C at a speed of 220 r/min for 8 h.",
    "Collect the bacteria and extract sgRNA library using QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi Kit according to user manual.\nNote: The bacteria suspension after expansion could be preserved in 30% glycerol/SOC medium at −80°C, and the preserved bacteria could be used for future library expansion with no need of extra transformation.\nDissolve the extracted plasmid in sterilized ddH2O. Quantify the plasmid concentration with a NanoDrop UV spectrophotometer. Appropriate concentration of DNA plasmid is around 1 μg/μL.\nPause Point: The DNA plasmid can be stored at −80°C for several years.\nQuality control of the sgRNA library\nTiming: 8 days\nNote: A two-step PCR method is used to amplify the sgRNA sequences and add the Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences for next-generation sequencing (NGS).\nAmplify the sgRNA library by PCR according to the following PCR program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_673_5.csv\nRun the PCR according to the following program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_673_6.csv\nSubject obtained PCR products to 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel, and run the gel at 120 V for 25 min at 22°C–26°C.\nPurify the target products at around 300 bp through Universal DNA Purification Kit according to user manual.\nAdd Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences by another round of PCR for the gel-recycled products according to the following PCR program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_673_7.csv\nRun the PCR according to the following program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_673_8.csv\nSubject obtained PCR products to 2% agarose gel, and run the gel at 120 V for 25 min at 22°C–26°C. Purify the target products at around 260 bp through Universal DNA Purification Kit according to user manual.\nSequence the purified DNA products on the Illumina HiSeq/NovaSeq system. Check amplified library quality by MAGeCK (Li et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nInstall MAGeCK with Conda/bioconda.\nDownload the FASTQ file from Addgene.",
    "Cut adapter from the FASTQ files and just remain 20 bp sgRNA reads. For example, the pattern of reads1 sequence for A_pool is as follows: TAAGTAGA (Rd1 SP) GGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCG AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT (20 bp sgRNA) GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCCGTTATCAACTTGAAAAAGTGGCACCGAGTCGGAGATCGGAAGAGCA (sgRNA scaffold) Reads1 sequence for A_pool should be cut 43 bp from 5’ end and 87 bp from 3’ end. $ cutadapt -u 43 -o A_pool_R1_1.fq.gz A_pool_R1.fq.gz $ cutadapt -u -87 -o A_pool_R1_2.fq.gz A_pool_R1_1.fq.gz Use reads mapping algorithms (such as Bowtie2) to map reads. Build bowtie2 index. $ bowtie2-build A_pool.fa bowtie2_ind_A_pool Map reads with Bowtie2. $ bowtie2 -x bowtie2_ind A_pool -U A_pool_R1_2.fq.gz --norc | samtools view -bS - > A_pool_R1.bam\nUse MAGeCK to count sgRNA number with default parameters and only report the reads with unique alignment. $ mageck count -l A_pool_library.csv --sample-label \"A_pool\" --fastq A_pool_R1.bam\nA count file collecting all read counts (A_pool.count.txt) and a summary file (A_pool_summary.txt) would be build by MAGeCK. Obtain the normalized counts of each sgRNA in amplified library and original sgRNA library. Qualified library will have a coverage higher than 80% and ginidex lower than 0.2. Otherwise, re-amplify the library with a larger scale.\nPackaging of sgRNA library harboring lentivirus\nTiming: 9 days\nLentivirus production\nPassage HEK293FT cells when reached 90% confluency. Plate HEK293FT cells into 20 100 mm culture dishes.\nOn the next day, when the cells become 70% confluency, warm up 2×Transfection Buffer, 2 M CaCl2 and sterilized ddH2O at a 37°C water bath for 30 min before transfection.",
    "Add 5 mL ddH2O, 737.5 μL 2 M CaCl2, 100 μL sgRNA library plasmid at 1 μg/μL, 37.5 μL PAX2 at 1 μg/μL, 25 μL VSVG at 1 μg/μL in sequential in a 15 mL conical tube and mix well by pipetting. Add 5.9 mL 2×Transfection Buffer by dropwise and mix immediately. Incubate the transfection mixture at 22°C–26°C for 1 min when it become slight turbid toward the light.\nEvenly disperse the transfection mixture onto 5 plates of HEK29FT cells by dropwise (2.36 mL/plate). Gently swirl the dishes to ensure uniform distribution of the transfection mixture. Place the transfected dishes back into the incubator.\nRepeat steps 14c and 14d for 3 more times to complete the transfection of the rest 15 plates.\nCheck precipitates under the microscope at 1 h after transfection. Abundant tiny calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitates with Brownian movement predicts a successful transfection.\nContinue to culture the cells in a 37°C incubator for 16 h.\nAspirate the old medium and replace with 7.5 mL fresh HEK293FT medium in every dish.\nContinue to incubate the cells for 48 h. Collect the supernatant containing viral particles in a 50 mL conical tube, and centrifuge at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Harvest the supernatant and filter through a 0.45 μm syringe filter.\nSterile the ultracentrifuge tubes and buckets by soaking in 75% ethanol for 10 min. Air dry them in the biosafety cabinet.\nFill the filtered supernatant into 4 centrifuge tubes, and place them into the buckets. After balancing, centrifuge at 55,000 × g for 3 h at 16°C.",
    "When ultracentrifuge completes, aspirate the supernatant carefully, and collect the virus pellet with 2 mL hPSC growth medium for each centrifuge tube. Pool all virus suspension in a 15 mL conical tube and mix well by pipetting. Keep the virus suspension at 4°C for 8–12 h, aliquot (0.5 mL/vial) and store at −80°C before use.\nPause Point: The virus can be stored at −80°C for several years.\nTitration of the packaged lentivirus solution\nTest the minimal killing concentration of puromycin minimum kill concentration. At the second day after passaging of hPSCs and HEK293FT cells, treat the cells with a serial of concentrations of puromycin (0, 0.25, 0.34, 0.5, 1 and 5 μg/mL) for 3 days. 3 days after treatment, observe the killing efficiency of puromycin by counting the number of living cells. The minimal killing concentration of puromycin is 0.5 μg/mL for both hPSCs and HEK293FT cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/673-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Titration of packaged lentivirus sgRNA library\n(A) Titration the optimal concentration of puromycin for hPSCs. 0, 0.25, 0.34, 0.5, 1 and 5 μg/mL puromycin were applied in hPSCs for 3 days, and the killing efficiency was observed under the microscope. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(B) Phase contrast images show that HEK293FT cells in the control well without puromycin treatment reach 70% confluency 4 days after passaging. In puromycin treated wells, all cells in the well infected with 0 μL virus solution are killed, and the survival rates of cells infected with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μL virus solution show gradient increase. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nSeed HEK293FT cells in a 6-well plate at a density of 50,000 cells/well.",
    "On the next day, thaw the stored virus solution on ice and add 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μL virus solution into 5 individual wells. Mark the 6th well as control.\n24 h after virus infection, add puromycin (0.5 μg/mL) into the virus-infected HEK293FT cells. Leave the 6th control well untreated and do not add puromycin into this well.\nContinue to culture the cells in the incubator for 3 days and replace the puromycin-containing fresh HEK293FT medium daily. For the control well, replace fresh HEK293FT medium without puromycin daily.\n3 days after puromycin treatment, observe the cells of each well under a microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The control well usually reaches 70% confluency. In puromycin treated wells, all cells in the well infected with 0 μL virus solution will be killed, and gradient increases of survival in wells infected with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μL virus solution will be observed.\nDigest the cells of each well with trypsin (0.05%) and count the cell number.\nVirus titer (Infectious Units (IFU)/mL) = Number of survived cells ×    50,000 Number of control cells    / Volume of virus solution added (mL).\nNumber of survived cells: the number of remaining cells in each well infected with various volumes of virus solution and treated with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin for 3 days;\nNumber of control cells: the number of cells in control well without puromycin-treatment at day 4 after seeding.",
    "Note: In our case, different dilutions of the virus end up with similar titration results, and the virus titers for GeCKO v2 library, including both A and B pools, are around 106 IFU/mL. If the relationship of the number of survived cells and the volume of virus solution added is not linear, only take account those wells with lower concentrations of virus treatment for calculation. Only 1 frozen-thaw cycle is acceptable, otherwise the IFU of the virus will be greatly reduced.\nNote: hPSCs is not suitable for lentivirus titer test given their clonal growth behavior. Moreover, hPSCs could not survive after plating when they are digested into single cells. Here, we use HEK293FT cells to test virus titer instead of hPSCs.\nScreening of lineage specification preventing genes (LPGs) in hPSCs\nTiming: 30 days\nInfect PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs with sgRNA lentiviral libraries (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/673-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Genome-scale CRISPR screening in PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs\n(A) Timeline of the screening procedure. 3.4 ×106 hPSCs were infected with sgRNA lentiviral libraries of A pool or B pool and seeded in one MEF feeder-coated 6-well plate. 0.5 μg/mL puromycin was added from day 2 to day 5 to remove uninfected cells. MEF conditioned medium was supplied from day 3 to day 7. When reached 70% confluency at day 7, the library-infected hPSCs were passaged onto six 6-well plates with feeder layer. 2 days after passage, the hPSCs were treated with or without Dox (3 plates for each group) for 3 days. 5 days after passage, when the hPSCs were 70% confluent, both the control and Dox-treated cells were passaged onto eighteen 6-well plates with feeder layer. tdTomato positive cells organized into rosette-like structures were observable 6 days after the second passage, and FACS sorting and DNA extraction were performed. The whole procedure takes around 18 days.",
    "(B) Some hPSC colones express clustered tdTomato after Dox treatment. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(C) Fluorescent images show that FACS-sorted cells have uniform tdTomato expression. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nPrepare PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs in a 6-well plate with 70% confluency.\nWarm up DMEM/F-12, dispase (1.5 U/mL), trypsin (0.05%) and hPSC growth medium in a 37°C water bath.\nRinse one well of hPSCs with pre-warmed trypsin and digest the cells with trypsin for another 3 min in the incubator. Triturate the cell clusters into single cells with 1 mL pipette and count the total cell number of the well with a hemocytometer.\nCalculate the number of remaining 5 wells of cells.\nDigest the remaining PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs with dispase in a 37°C incubator for 3 min after brief rinse with DMEM/F-12. When the edges of hPSC colonies begin to curl, aspirate the dispase and rinse the cells with DMEM/F-12 gently.\nCollect the hPSC colonies using a 10 mL serological pipette with 10 mL hPSC growth medium. Blow the colonies off gently and pool all the cells to a 50 mL conical tube. Pipette up and down against the bottom of the tube to break up the colonies into around 50 μm pieces.\nTransfer the amount of cell clump suspension containing 3.4×106 cells into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 600 × g for 2 min at 22°C–26°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL lentivirus solution (106 IFU/mL) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.3 (Joung et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Shalem et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nIncubate the hPSC clumps/lentiviruses mixture in a 37°C incubator for 30 min, and gently tap the bottom of the 15 mL conical tube every 5 min. After incubation, seed the hPSC clumps/lentiviruses mixture on feeder layer in a new 6-well plate.",
    "Continue to culture the hPSCs in a 37°C incubator and replace refresh hPSC growth medium with 4 ng/mL bFGF every day.\n2 days after virus infection, add 0.5 μg/mL puromycin to kill uninfected cells for 3 days. Refresh the medium with puromycin daily.\nWhen the library-infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs are 70% confluent, passage them onto 6 new 6-well plates with feeder layer.\nNote: We usually maintain hPSCs on feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and in this way, hPSCs show no spontaneous differentiation. Ensure no occurrence of tdTomato positive cells under a fluorescence microscope every time before starting a screening experiment.\nNote: If the MEF feeder layer is killed by puromycin, add MEF conditioned medium and fresh hPSC growth medium at 1:1 ratio until the cells are ready for passage. To prepare MEF conditioned medium, the MEF feeder layer is cultured with hPSC growth medium for 24 h. The conditioned medium is then collected.\nNote: Before the Dox treatment, the PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs have been expanded by 25-fold for 9 days (6-fold for 5 days).\nNote: During passage, to maintain library coverage, pool the library infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs together and do not discard any of the cells. 3.4 ×106 cells × 0.3 MOI × 25 = 2.55 ×107 cells 2.55 ×107 cells / 65, 383 gRNA = 390-fold representation After Dox treatment, both the control and Dox-treated groups were further expanded for another 9 days before FACS sorting and DNA extraction, and the cells were pooled for 25 more folds at end point. 390 / 2 × 25 = 4875-fold representation It is therefore both the control and Dox-treated cells have been expanded by 4875-fold before screening.\nInduce Cas9 expression and initiate genome-scale gene knockout.",
    "At step 16l, 2 days after passaging, add 1 μg/mL Dox for 3 continuous days for 3 plates and leave the other 3 plates untreated as control.\nPassage and expand the control plates and Dox-treated plates onto 18 new 6-well plates, respectively.\nFACS-enrichment of tdTomato expressing transformed cells.\n6 days after passaging at step 17b, observe the tdTomato expressing pattern in control and Dox-treated cells under a fluorescence microscope. Typical tdTomato expressing cells organized into rosette like structures could be frequently seen in Dox-treated plates, but not in those control ones (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDigest one plate of control and one plate of Dox-treated library infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs into single cells with trypsin according to aforementioned method at step 16c.\nPellet the single cells of both control and Dox-treated groups by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in 5 mL PBS containing 10% FBS.\nPellet cells again at 1,000 × g for 2 min and resuspend them in 2 mL PBS.\nPass the control and Dox-treated cell suspension through a 35 μm nylon mesh incorporated into the tube cap to remove clumps. Place them on ice.\nRecord the percentage and collect all of the tdTomato positive cells in the Dox-treated group through FACS sorting. Also record the percentage of tdTomato positive cells in the control group by FACS, and re-confirm the percentage of tdTomato positive cells in the control group is always lower than that of the Dox-treated group.\nRepeat steps b-g to digest remaining plates of Dox-treated library infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs into single cells for further FACS sorting one plate by another.\nPool all FACS enriched tdTomato cells together. Double check the tdTomato expressing cells under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Pellet the tdTomato positive cells by centrifugation at a speed of 2,500 ×g for 4 min at 22°C–26°C. Remove the supernatant and the cell pellet is ready for genomic DNA extraction. Otherwise, store at −20°C before moving to step 20.\nPause Point: The collected cell pellet can be stored at −20°C for several days.\nDigest the remaining 17 control plates into single cells with trypsin set at setp16c. Pool all the cells together and mix well by pipetting. Take 6×106 cells and pellet them through centrifugation at a speed of 2,500 × g for 4 min at 22°C–26°C. Remove the supernatant and the cell pellet is ready for genomic DNA extraction. Otherwise, store at −20°C before moving to step 20.\nPause Point: The collected cell pellet can be stored at −20°C for several days.\nHarvest the genomic DNA of the pelleted control cells with phenol/chloroform extraction, and dissolve the genomic DNA in 50 μL sterilized ddH2O. Harvest the genomic DNA of the FACS enriched tdTomato cells by using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution according to the user manual, and dissolve the genomic DNA in 10 μL of sterilized ddH2O.\nPause Point: The genomic DNA can be stored at −20°C for several days.\nAmplify the integrated sgRNAs by PCR in control and tdTomato cells, and add Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences according to aforementioned steps 8–12. For the first step of PCR amplification, add 10 μL genomic DNA templates for both the control (600 ng/μl) and tdTomato cells, although the exact amounts of DNA are variant in different conditions.",
    "Note: In order to expand the integrated control library with ∼100-fold representation, ∼30 μg genomic DNA was extracted from 6×106 control cells and resolved in 50 μl sterilized ddH2O (600 ng/μl). 6 μg DNA in 10 μl ddH2O was used for PCR amplification for the integrated sgRNA library, and a total of 5 reactions were performed. All gel recycled PCR products from the 5 reactions were pooled, and 40 ng DNA products were used for the second-round PCR to add Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences.\nSequence the DNA products on the Illumina HiSeq/NovaSeq system, and use MAGeCK (Li et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) to identify LPGs.\nCut adapter from FASTQ data and just remain 20 bp sgRNA reads.\nUse reads mapping algorithms (such as Bowtie2) to map reads.\nUse MAGeCK to count sgRNA number and compare counts of each sgRNA in different samples with default parameters and only the reads with unique alignment are reported.\nGet the normalized counts of each sgRNA in control sample and tdTomato cells, respectively.\nEstimate the statistical significance (using a negative binomial test) of enrichment for each sgRNA in the tdTomato cells compared to control cells by using the MAGeCK algorithm.\nIdentify the LPGs by searching for genes whose sgRNAs are ranked consistently higher (by significance) using robust rank aggregation (RRA). Incorporate the negative control in MAGeCk analysis to generate null distributions and calculate the p-value and FDR for each.\nNote: As a marker selection, it is also acceptable to directly compare the enriched sgRNA pools in tdTomato cells with the initial sgRNA pool obtained during the quality control step."
