Prepare the reactions as in the following table and incubate reaction at 37°C for 30 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_703_14.csv\nTransformation:\nThaw 100 μL aliquots of DH5α competent cells from −80°C freezer on ice.\nAdd 10 μL of the products from Step 5 into 50 μL of ice-cold DH5α competent cells.\nIncubate the mixture on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock the mixture at 42°C for 45 s and return immediately to ice for 2 min.\nAdd 600 μL SOC medium (without antibiotics) and incubate in 37°C shaker for 30-40 min.\nPlate 200 μL of the mixture onto an LB plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and spread around.\nIncubate the plate for 16 to 24 h at 37°C.\nPick 2–4 colonies per construct. Grow colonies in LB/100 μg/mL ampicillin. Shake 16 to 24 h at 37°C.",
    "Miniprep each culture, extract genomic DNA using the Zymo genomic extraction kit following manufacturer’s instructions.\nSubmit the extracted plasmids for Sanger sequencing to verify successful cloning of the candidate gRNAs using U6 forward primer (ACGATACAAGGCTG TTAGAGAG).\nPause Point: Keep the glycerol stocks harboring the correctly cloned plasmids. At this point, the glycerol stocks at −80°C can be stored for long-term and you can proceed to the next steps later.\nChoose a sequence-verified colony and inoculate into a maxiprep culture. Store the plasmids at −80°C.\nElectroporating plasmids into human iPSCs\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis step tests the cutting efficiencies of the candidate gRNAs in human iPSCs. gRNAs that show no or low cutting efficiency will be excluded before single cell clone isolation. Here we use MC0192 human iPSC line generated in our lab, which has been reported previously (Zhao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Zhao et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). This iPSC line has been fully characterized and monitored for mycoplasma contamination regularly.\nCulturing human iPSCs: Thaw and culture human iPSC line (ID: MC0192) in feeder-free conditions with mTesR1 medium in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nCoat 100 mm cell culture dish with Matrigel: Dilute Matrigel with 6 mL cold DMEM/F-12 according to the dilution factor provided in the manufacturer’s datasheet and dispense the solution onto the plate. The aliquot (dilution factor) volume of Matrigel is typically between 270 and 350 μL (refer to the Certificate of Analysis). Add one aliquot (dilution factor) of Matrigel to 18 mL of DMEM/F-12 to coat three 100 mm dishes. Move the plate around so that the bottom of the plate is completely covered. Leave it at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in the biosafety hood for at least 1 h. Always prepare Matrigel-coated plate freshly!",
    "Thaw a vial of cells in 37°C water bath, transfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube, add 5 mL of mTeSR1 medium and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate the Matrigel coating medium and seed cells with 10 mL of mTeSR1 medium containing ROCK inhibitor (10 μM Y27632).\nChange medium with regular mTeSR1 medium after 24 h and refeed daily.\nNote: Extensive passage might induce some alteration in the human iPSC line, it is recommended to use human iPSC lines with comparatively low passage number (< passage 30). Before electroporation, we recommend to passage the cells one time after thawing followed by culturing for at least 5 days. When the cells reach 70% confluency during this period, passage cells according to the following steps.\nPassaging cells: Passage the cells before they reach 70% confluency.\nObserve the iPSCs under the microscope. If any differentiated cells appear, scrape them off using a P2 pipette tip under the microscope (in the hood).\nAspirate the mTeSR1 medium and wash the cells once with 10 mL DPBS.\nAdd 6 mL Dispase to 100 mm cell culture dish and leave it in the incubator at 37°C for ~5 min. When the edge of the iPSC colonies starts to peel off the plate, aspirate the Dispase, and rinse the dish with 6 mL pre-warmed DMEM/F-12.\nAspirate DMEM/F-12, add 6 mL of mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y27632, and scrape the dish to detach the iPSC.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nUsing 1 mL pipette, break the colonies into smaller pieces by pipetting up and down a few times.",
    "Transfer the iPSC to a new plate at 1:3 to 1:6 ratio depending on your experimental plan.\nElectroporation: Use the Invitrogen Neon™ transfection system or similar systems according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAspirate the mTeSR1 medium and wash the cells once with DPBS.\nAdd 6 mL of Accutase to 100 mm cell culture dish and leave it in the incubator at 37°C for ~5 min. Using a pipettor, pipette the cell suspension up and down 3 - 5 times to dislodge remaining attached cells. Add 10 mL of DMEM/F-12 to the plate, and collect the cells into a 50 mL tube. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Gently resuspend cell pellet with mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y27632. Count the number of cells needed for nucleofection (3 × 105 cells per electroporation) and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove the medium completely and resuspend cells in nucleofection solution.\nPipette the resuspended cells with 1.5 μg of each gRNA/Cas9 plasmid into electroporation cuvettes and electroporate according to the parameters in the following table. This electroporation parameter has been tested to ensure optimal transfection efficiency in several iPSC lines. However, we always recommend additional optimization for each particular iPSC line.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_703_15.csv\nGently plate the electroporated cells onto coated 100 mm plates in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM Y27632. Typically 1 to 2 ×105 cells survive 24 h post nucleofection.\nRefeed the cells daily with regular mTeSR1 medium beginning 24 h after nucleofection. Puromycin selection can be applied to remove non-transfected cells at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL for 24 h.",
    "Note: The concentration of puromycin may vary depending on the cell line. The lowest concentration can be 0.25 μg/mL. The puromycin concentration can range from 0.25 to 1 μg/mL. In our experience, 0.5 μg/mL with 24 h treating time shows the best results. Treating cells with puromycin for longer time is not recommended since the cells are very sensitive to puromycin. Further optimization for each particular iPSC line is always recommended.\nCritical: Human iPSCs can vary widely in their transfection efficiency, tolerance of single-cell dissociation, and maintenance conditions. For a given cell line of interest, relevant literature or the supplier should be consulted.\nEvaluate gRNA pairs via PCR amplification: Each of the two gRNA pairs indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] are transfected into iPSCs. After puromycin selection, the pooled cells which contain a mixed population of Cas9/gRNA transfected cells are collected to assess the deletion efficiency of its gRNA pair. The following PCR primers are used to amplify the targeted region, which will be around 204 bp for deletion alleles, and 304 bp for wild type alleles.\nAPOE-F (AGGTACTAGATGCCTGGACGG)\nAPOE-R (GTATAGCCGCCCACCAGGAG)\nAssemble the PCR reactions and run the cycling program as follows. Run 10 μL of PCR product on a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel to check for size of the products using UV imaging. gRNA5+8 generates >40% deletion efficiency since a stronger edited PCR band is present compared to the wild-type band. These pooled cells are used for isolation of single cell clones (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. APOE deletion in pooled cells transfected with different gRNA combinations\nTroubleshooting (Problem 1)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_703_16.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_703_17.csv\nSingle-cell clone isolation\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nOnce the desired deletion rate of pooled transfected cells is confirmed by PCR, dissociate the cells from the transfected cell pool using Accutase.",
    "Count the number of transfected iPSCs from each 6-well plate, and serially dilute them in culture medium supplemented with 10 μM Y27632 to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per 100 μL to reduce the likelihood of having multiple cells per well.\nUse 80 cells in 12 mL of culture medium for each fresh Matrigel-coated 96-well plate and use at least two 96-well plates for each transfected population.\nObserve each of 96-wells the next day and mark off the wells that may have been seeded with multiple cells. Allow the single cells to expand to a clonal appearance ~1 week after plating.\nReturn the cells to the incubator and allow them to expand for 2–3 weeks. Refeed the single cell clones daily with regular mTeSR1 medium.\nCritical: Single-cell dissociation and accurate count of cell number are critical for clonal dilution. We recommend examining the dissociated cells under a microscope to ensure successful dissociation and recounting cells at an intermediate serial dilution stage to ensure accuracy.\nPCR analysis and DNA sequencing\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nSingle cells are placed in 96-well plates and cultured for about 14 days before expanding and culturing in 24-well plates.\nEach clone from the 24-well plates is isolated and genomic DNA is extracted using Zymo genomic extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The genomic DNA is subsequently used for PCR amplification assay.\nPause Point: Extracted DNA can be stored at −20°C for several months.\nThe same PCR primers used in Step 14 are used to amplify the targeted region.\nAPOE-F (AGGTACTAGATGCCTGGACGG)\nAPOE-R (GTATAGCCGCCCACCAGGAG)\nAssemble the PCR reactions and run the cycling program as in Step 14.\nRun 10 μL of PCR product on a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel to check for size of the PCR products using UV imaging (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. APOE deletion in cells after single cell isolation and amplification\nAssay was run on genomic DNA samples from experimental clones and wildtype control. The gel images show that wildtype gives a 304 bp band. PCR products of clones with homozygous deletion (HM) have one band at around 204 bp, while heterozygous-deletion clones (HT) show both bands.\nSubmit the purified PCR products (using Macherey-Nagel Gel Purification Kit or similar) for Sanger sequencing with one or both of the PCR primers to confirm the APOE deletion (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Validation of APOE deletion in iPSCs via Sanger DNA sequencing\nClones #11, #34 and #40 show deletions in APOE gene compared with wildtype. Sanger DNA sequencing results of the 5’ and 3’ of deleted genomic region in APOE knockout clone #11 (A and B), #34 (C and D) and #40 (E and F).\nNote: Pick the clones that show normal pluripotent colony morphology with comparable growth rate to the parental cells. Confirm pluripotency by checking marker expression such as TRA-1-60, Nanog, and Sox2. If the differentiation rate is higher than 30%, it is recommended to do further selection following the regular iPSC handling procedure. Also confirm normal karyotypes of the selected clones before proceeding to the next steps. After pluripotency marker staining and three germ layer differentiation, we choose clone #11 to continue with the rest of the protocol (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Characterization of iPSCs after gene editing\n(A) Immunostaining of pluripotency markers (Nanog and TRA-1-60) in parental and APOE-/- iPSC lines.\n(B) In vitro differentiation of parental and APOE-/- iPSC lines into cells of all three germ layers. Cells were immunostained for Sox17 (endoderm), Brachyury (mesoderm), Nestin (ectoderm), and DAPI (nucleus). Scale bar: 100 μm.\nTroubleshooting (Problem 2)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nKaryotyping analysis\nTiming: 1 day",
    "GTL-banding karyotype analysis is performed by a Cytogenetics Core at Mayo Clinic.\nCells are treated with 0.0125 μg/mL colcemid (Life Technologies) for 16 to 24 h before being harvested using TrypLE (Gibco).\nCell suspension is then treated with hypotonic solution (equal parts KCl and NaCitrate) followed by fixation using 2:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid before spotted onto a glass slide.\nPrepared slides are stained using Trypsin and Leishman’s staining solutions. The stained slides are scanned using GSL-120 and analyzed using CytoVision™ (Leica Biosystems).\nGeneration of cerebral organoid from APOE-/- isogenic human iPSC line\nTiming: 3–4 months\nApoE is produced primarily by astrocytes in the central nervous system as a carrier of cholesterol and other lipids to support membrane homeostasis, synaptic integrity and injury repair (Liu et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Yamazaki et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Yu et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). The cerebral organoid model system is highly reminiscent of human brain structure with diverse cell types (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Lancaster et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Renner et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), which can be a powerful human related model to investigate gene functions and crosstalk between different cell types. Here, we use STEMdiff™ Cerebral Organoid Kit from Stemcell Technologies for cerebral organoid differentiation. Cerebral organoids in this study are generated following the manufacturer’s guidelines with some in-house optimizations (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Workflow for the generation of cerebral organoids (Created with BioRender.com)\nThaw Supplement(s) at room temperature (20°C–25°C). Add Supplement(s) to Basal Medium as indicated by the manufacturer (see Materials and Equipment).\nNote: If not used immediately, aliquot Supplement(s) and store at −20°C. After thawing aliquots, use immediately. Do not re-freeze.\nEmbryonic body (EB) formation\nNote: This protocol is for the formation of EBs from a human iPSC culture in a 100 mm dish, adjust volumes for other cultureware accordingly.",
    "Critical: Use a microscope to visually identify regions of differentiation in the iPSC culture. Remove regions of differentiation by scraping with a pipette tip.\nPrewarm EB Formation medium aliquot to room temperature (20°C–25°C) and add ROCK inhibitor (final concentration: 10 μM).\nAspirate medium from human iPSC culture and wash the dish with 10 mL of prewarmed sterile DPBS.\nAspirate DPBS and add 6 mL of Accutase. Incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nNote: Check the digest status under microscope. Incubation time may vary when using different cell lines. Other non-enzymatic cell dissociation reagents can also be used. Make sure all cells are dissociated into single cells. Dissociated cells can be filtered through 30 μm cell strainer when necessary.\nTransfer cell suspension into a sterile 15 mL conical tube.\nRinse the dish with 6 mL of mTeSR1 and add this rinse to the tube containing cells. Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate the supernatant. Add 1–2 mL of EB medium with 10 μM Y27632 to resuspend cells.\nCount cells and calculate the volume of cells required to obtain 150,000 cells/mL; add cells to extra EB medium with 10 μM Y27632.\nAdd 100 μL of cell suspension into 96-well round-bottom ultra-low attachment plate using multi-channel pipettor (15,000 cells/well). Centrifuge the plate at 500 × g for 5 min.\nIncubate 96-well plate at 37°C for 24 h. Do not disturb plate during this period.\nNote: It is important to optimize the initial cell seeding densities for optimal EB formation. Cell density needs to be adjusted according to specific iPSC line. Increase the cell number if the EB size is too small (<100 μm). Preliminary experiments can be performed before culturing the experimental cohort.",
    "Gently add 100 μl of EB Formation medium per well on day 2 and day 4 respectively. Add the medium directly, and do not change medium.\nObserve EBs under microscope on Day 5. EBs should reach a diameter of > 300 μm (typically 400–600 μm) and exhibit round and smooth edges. At this stage, most cells are still positive for pluripotency markers (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Characterization of EBs at early differentiation stages\nRepresentative images of pluripotency (TRA-1-60 and Nanog) and neural stem cell (Nestin and Sox2) markers expression in EBs at different stages.\nTroubleshooting (Problem 3)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nNeural induction\nPrewarm neural induction medium to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 250 μL of Induction Medium to each well of a 48-well ultra-low attachment plate.\nTransfer 1 EB to each well of the 48-well plate using a wide-bore 200 μL pipette tip.\nNote: EBs can merge with each other during the induction period, which will influence the size evaluation of the cerebral organoid. Transfer of multiple EBs into one well is not recommended.\nIncubate EBs in Neural induction medium for 48 h. Observe EBs under microscope, EBs should show smooth and optically translucent edges.\nCritical: Induction time needs to be adjusted among different lines according to the morphology of EBs. Optically translucent edge is an important hallmark for successful neuroepithelia induction. Marker staining shows the emergence of Nestin positive cells (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nCerebral organoid expansion\nPrewarm Expansion medium aliquot to room temperature (20°C–25°C), thaw Matrigel on ice at 2°C–8°C for 1–2 h.\nNote: You will lose some Matrigel during embedding, thaw Matrigel slightly more than the needed amount (20 μL/EB; 96 EBs × 20 μL/EB ≈ 2 mL Matrigel). Keep Matrigel on ice to prevent premature polymerization. All plasticwares used for embedding should be kept at −20°C prior to use.",
    "Place the Organoid Embedding Sheet into an empty sterile 100 mm dish on ice.\nUse a pre-chilled wide-bore 200 μL pipette tip and set the pipet at 25 μL, draw up EBs from the 48-well plate and transfer to embedding surface.\nNote: Matrigel can get dry and polymerize prematurely, Embed no more than 12–16 EBs at a time as Matrigel can get dry and polymerized prematurely.\nCarefully remove excessive medium from each EB. Add 20 μL of Matrigel dropwise onto each EB using pre-chilled 20 μL pipette tip.\nReposition the EB to the center of the droplet using pre-chilled pipette tip.\nPlace the plate in an incubator at 37°C for 15 min to polymerize Matrigel.\nUse sterile forceps to position the embedding sheet directly above a 6-well ultra-low adherent plate. Gently wash Matrigel droplets off the sheet using a 1 mL pipettor (3 mL Expansion Medium/well). Repeat until all Matrigel droplets are washed off.\nIncubate EBs in Expansion medium for 3 days. Embedded organoids will show budding of the EB surface (Nestin +/Sox2 +), which is a hallmark for neuroepithelia development (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nTroubleshooting (Problem 4)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nCerebral organoid maturation\nPrewarm Maturation medium (Medium E).\nUse a wide bore 1 mL pipette tip to carefully transfer 16–20 Matrigel droplets containing organoids to 100 mm dish.\nRemove excess medium, add 15 mL Maturation medium to the dish.\nPlace plate of organoids on an orbital shaker in a 37°C incubator. Set the shaker speed at 40 rpm.\nChange medium with Maturation medium every 3 days.\nAfter culturing organoids in Medium E for 4 weeks, replace medium with Neuron medium, and change medium every 3 days until harvesting.",
    "Note: Heterogeneous morphologies will be apparent in cerebral organoid culture. During the differentiation process, some abnormal cerebral organoids will fall apart into small pieces in the orbital shaker, which can be eliminated during medium change. Collect cerebral organoids with normal size range (typically 2–4 mm in diameter) and exclude those with obviously smaller sizes (<1 mm) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). The exclusion criteria should be adjusted for different iPSC lines, especially for those with disease-associated mutations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/703-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Representative image of cerebral organoids after 12 Weeks of differentiation\nThose that are much smaller than others can be excluded from further analysis (an example is shown with red arrow).\nTroubleshooting (Problem 5)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]\nCerebral organoid validation via specific neural marker immunostaining\nTiming: 3–4 days\nDuring the long-term differentiation procedure, cerebral organoids can be collected at different time points to confirm the emergence of neural differentiation markers, which will help to evaluate the quality of the cerebral organoids. After a period of maturation, organoids display cortical-like regions such as the ventricular zone and the emergence of multiple neuronal layers, which is similar to in vivo brain development. Here we stain organoid sections with Sox2 (neural progenitor cell marker), Pax6 (dorsal region marker), Nkx2.1 (ventral region marker), Tbr2 (intermediate progenitors),Tuj1 (early neuronal marker), Ctip2 (deep cortical layer marker) and Satb2 (superficial cortical layer marker) at Week 4 and 12 to monitor the differentiation of cerebral organoids (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCut a 1 mL pipette tip using sterile scissors as needed according to the size of cerebral organoid. Transfer organoids to a new 6-well plate carefully.\nRemove excess medium from the well. Wash cerebral organoids 3× for 5 min with DPBS.",
    "Add 5 mL fresh 4% PFA per well of 6-well plate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C). Make sure all organoids are submerged in PFA solution.\nDiscard PFA and wash cerebral organoids 3× for 5 min with DPBS.\nCaution: PFA can be potentially harmful to eyes, skin, or respiratory system. Avoid repeated and prolonged exposure.\nDiscard DPBS thoroughly. Add 30% Sucrose Solution at 5 mL per well of 6-well plate.\nAllow to equilibrate 24–48 h at 2°C–8°C. Adjust the equilibration time according to the size of organoid. Organoids should sink to the bottom of the well when equilibrated.\nTransfer organoids to Embedding mold and remove excess sucrose solution around the organoids.\nAdd Tissue-Tek® optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.) solutions to completely cover organoids, and use a 200 μL tip to adjust the location of the organoids. When embedding two or more organoids in one mold, separate organoids to avoid contact with each other.\nFreeze embedded organoids in O.C.T. on dry ice until completely frozen.\nPause Point: Embedded organoids can be stored in −80°C freezer for long-term use.\nCut frozen organoid sections using Cryostat. Here we use 30 μm sections for marker staining. Thickness can be adjusted to suit imaging system.\nDry slides completely on slide heater and store slides in −80°C freezer for long-term use.\nMove slides from −80°C freezer to room temperature (20°C–25°C). Use a PAP pen to outline the organoid sections. Proceed to the next step once the wax is completely dry.\nWash slides with PBS in a Coplin staining jar 3× for 10 min to fully remove O.C.T. from slides.\nIncubate slides with 200 μL of 0.5% PBS-X in a humidified chamber at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nWash slides 3× for 5 min with DPBS in a Coplin staining jar.",
    "Incubate slides with 200 μL of Blocking buffer at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in a humidified chamber for 1 h.\nPrepare primary antibody solution in Antibody Dilution Buffer.

Pipette Mounting medium to slide and mount slide with coverslip. Allow mounting medium to harden in 16 to 24 h and store at 4°C before imaging.\nEvaluation of APOE deletion efficiency in human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids: RT-qPCR\nTiming: 2 days\nHarvest cerebral organoids after 12 weeks of differentiation. Transfer organoids to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube using 1 mL cut pipette tips. Remove excessive medium. Wash cerebral organoids with 1 mL DPBS for 3 times.\nNote: Due to the heterogeneity of cerebral organoid, it is recommended to pool multiple cerebral organoids as one sample to reduce the variation. Here we pool 3 cerebral organoids as one sample.\nAspirate DPBS. Add 0.5 mL of Trizol and mash with a pestle at room temperature (20°C–25°C).",
    "Caution: Trizol will burn if spilt on skin/eyes. Conduct all experiments related with Trizol in the fume hood.\nAdd another 0.5 mL of Trizol to obtain a final volume of 1 mL and gently pipette the mixture up and down until tissue is well lysed. Leave the tube at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 2–3 min.\nAdd 200 μL of Chloroform and shake each of the tubes 15 times. Leave the tubes undisturbed for 2–3 min. This causes the solution in the tube to separate into 2 distinct layers.\nSpin the tubes at 4°C for 10 min at maximum speed. Carefully remove the aqueous layer on the top into a 1.5 mL RNase-free Eppendorf tube containing 500 μL of 100% isopropanol.\nNote: Do not disturb the layers! This method extracts large amount of RNA from the tissue and hence “less is better”. 300–400 μL of the aqueous layer should suffice.\nAfter transferring the aqueous layer into the Eppendorf tube, shake well. Spin at maximum speed for 10 min to obtain a pellet.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash with 1 mL of 75% EtOH (using DEPC water to dilute the 100% Absolute EtOH to 75%). Flick tube to wash the pellet RNA.\nSpin the tubes at 4°C at maximum speed for 10 min to pellet RNA. Carefully pour off the EtOH. At this point it is important to change your gloves. Clean new gloves with EtOH and RNase zap. Leave tube upside down so 75% EtOH drains out, allowing the pellet to dry.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 μL RNase free H2O.\nTreat RNA with DNase following the instructions of RNase-Free DNase Set and RNeasy Mini Kit from QIAGEN.\nPrepare cDNA with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit.\nConduct Real-time (RT)-qPCR with Universal SYBR Green Supermix using an iCycler thermocycler.",
    "Primers used to amplify target genes by RT-qPCR:\nACTB F (5’-CTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATG-3’)\nR (5’-AATGTCACGCACGATTTCCCGC-3’)\nAPOE F (5’-CGTTGCTGGTCACATTCCT-3’)\nR (5’-CTCAGTTCCTGGGTGACCTG-3’).\nThe 2exp (−ΔΔCt) method was used to determine the relative expression of each gene with ACTB gene coding β-actin as a reference.\nEvaluation of APOE deletion efficiency in human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids: Western blotting\nTiming: 2 days\nHarvest cerebral organoids after 12 weeks of differentiation. Transfer organoids to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube using 1 mL cut pipette tip. Remove excessive medium. Wash organoids with 1 mL DPBS 3 times.\nNote: Due to the heterogeneity of cerebral organoids, it is recommended to pool multiple cerebral organoids as one sample to reduce the variation. Here we pooled 3 cerebral organoids as one sample.\nOptional: Excessive Matrigel might influence sample quality for western blotting, which can be removed under microscope using forceps, especially for the samples collected at early stage of differentiation.\nLyse organoids with RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer supplemented with Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails for Cell Lysis.\nSonicate the lysate at 20 kHz (15 cycles, 1 s sonication/1 s rest for each cycle). Keep the sample on ice during the sonication. Then incubate for 30 min on ice.\nSamples were centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at 45,000 × g, for 1 h at 4°C.\nCollect supernatants. Determine protein concentration in the supernatant using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit.\nMix samples with Western blotting loading buffer. Heat inactive samples at 95°C for 10 min.\nLoad samples into a 4%–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), and transferred to PVDF Immobilon FL membranes (Millipore).",
