    "Experiment setupPlace the CPP apparatus in a room dedicated to behavioral research. This room should be devoid of extraneous odors or sounds. The room’s house lights should be turned off throughout the experiment, as the overhead lights will be used to track mice during testing (Figure 2). A lux meter is placed in the middle of each chamber (i.e., on top of either the grid or bar floors shown in Figure 1) to ensure that the light intensity (100 lux) from the overhead lights is similar across all chambers of the CPP apparatus.Note: Rooms that are used for surgical procedures or animal husbandry are not suitable. Similarly, clothes that have fragrances and other strong odors should be changed prior to the start of the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200411/20200411112419_9416.jpgFigure 2. Conditioned place preference room setup with eight apparatus. Each CPP chamber is assigned a box ID (e.g., Box 1). The orientation of each box is antiparallel (rotated 180°) from the adjacent box. The location of each box is permanently fixed. The overhead lights are positioned to avoid shadows on the floor of the compartments. Each camera is positioned to record from two boxes.Create a table in Microsoft Excel that includes the mouse ID, Group Assignment, Box #, and Time spent in the checkered and white compartments.Assign each mouse to a dedicated behavioral box with assigned cocaine-paired and saline-paired compartments.Note: During this step, ensure that both control and experimental groups are equally represented during each trial. For each group, assign the white compartment as the cocaine-paired compartment for half of the mice. For the other half, assign the white compartment as the saline-paired compartment. It is best to ensure that across the entire experiment, each group is represented in each research box.",
    "Counterbalancing the injection-compartment assignments in this manner prevents chamber bias from confounding the CPP scores. House mice in individual cages one week prior to the start of the experiment. At this point, unique identification can be assigned to mice.Note: Experimenters should be blinded to the treatment group of each mouse. Weigh the mice before the start of the experiment.Prepare the desired cocaine dose for the experiment.Set recording software to record video as well as live tracking if possible.Handling the miceTurn on the overhead lights in the behavioral room and put on nitrile or latex gloves.Note: The same type of glove must be worn throughout the experiment. Remove the cages containing the mice from their animal rack and place them on the utility cart.Transfer the mice to the behavioral room using the utility cart.Note: It is important to avoid excess noise and rattling during this transfer. These sounds and motions can act as stressors for the mice. Clean gloves and handling sleeve using 70% ethanol but wait until the ethanol evaporates before handling the mice.Remove a mouse from its cage by quickly grabbing the base of its tail and placing it on the handling sleeve.Allow the mouse to freely explore the handling sleeve for 3 min before returning it to its cage (Figure 3).Clean your gloves and the handling sleeve after handling each mouse.Repeat the handling and glove cleaning steps until all mice have been handled.Use the utility cart to return mice to their housing room and animal rack.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200411/20200411112442_6862.jpgFigure 3. Conditioned place preference schematic. A representative daily sequence for two mice in the same group are illustrated. Mice undergo handling for 3 min on three consecutive days. At pretest, mice are allowed to freely explore the three-compartment apparatus for 15 min.",
    "On days 5 and 7, cocaine is administered before the mice are confined to one of the larger compartments. They are then permitted to explore that compartment for 30 min. The experiment is counterbalanced to ensure that half of the mice have cocaine paired with the white compartment while the other half have the cocaine paired with the checkered compartment. On days 6 and 8, saline is administered before the mice are confined to the large compartment that has not been associated with cocaine. They are then permitted to explore that compartment for 30 minutes. Mice are given a day off on day 9 and remain in their home cages. On posttest, mice are allowed to freely explore the three-compartment apparatus in an identical manner to the pretest (15 min duration).PretestPrepare the behavioral room by turning on the overhead lights.Clean each CPP chamber using 70% ethanol.Open the guillotine doors so that mice can freely move between each compartment.Turn on the computer and recording software.Transfer only the mice that will be run together to the behavioral room using the utility cart.Set the recording software to begin tracking when mice enter each chamber and to stop after 15 min have elapsed.Pick up each mouse by the base of their tail and transfer them to your palm.Place each mouse in the center compartment of their predetermined CPP box.Note: Ensure that as each mouse is lowered into the CPP apparatus, they are facing one of the gray walls of the center compartment. This will reduce any bias for a particular compartment. Allow mice to explore the CPP apparatus for 15 min (Figure 3).Remove the mice from the apparatus and transfer it to its cage.",
    "Start by confining the mice to the center compartment by closing the guillotine doors, then grab it by the base of its tail before immediately placing it in your palm then cage.Return all mice to their housing room using the utility cart.Open the guillotine doors and clean the CPP apparatus thoroughly using 70% ethanol. Pay special attention to areas that may accumulate pooled urine or defecation.Note: The bedding (i.e., pine and cedar) can remain in place for the entirety of the experiment unless there is an accumulation of urine or defecation. Set the computer to record the next set of mice.Clean gloves using 70% ethanol before retrieving the next set of mice.Repeat Steps C5-C14 until all mice are tested.ConditioningPrepare the saline and cocaine solutions.Note: A moderate cocaine dose (e.g., 10 mg/kg) is recommended for preliminary experiments–where either a memory impairment or enhancement may be observed. Measure out the amount of saline or cocaine to be administered to each mouse from the stock using a syringe.Place each filled syringe in front of the CPP chamber in which the injected mouse will be added.Clean each CPP chamber using 70% ethanol.Close the guillotine doors so that mice will be confined to the outer compartments.Transfer only the mice that will be run together to the behavioral room using the utility cart.Administer saline or cocaine via intraperitoneal injection before placing the mouse into the assigned outer compartment.Set a timer for 30 min. Allow mice to explore the assigned compartment (Figure 3).Note: Mice do not need to be recorded during conditioning sessions. However, the recording software can be activated if the activity during conditioning is of interest. After 30 min have elapsed, remove each mouse from their respective CPP box and transfer it to its homecage.",
