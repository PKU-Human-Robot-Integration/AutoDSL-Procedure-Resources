    "1. Setting Up rec-8 RNAi (Day 1 - 3 in Figure 2)\nThis protocol is modified from Kamath and Ahringer30.\nFor induction of rec-8 dsRNA expression in Escherichia coli, prepare Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar plates31 supplemented with a final concentration of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-2-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Store in the dark at 4 °C until use, for up to 4 weeks.\nStreak HT115 bacteria carrying the rec-8 (W02A2.6) clone from the Ahringer laboratory library30 rec-8 clone onto Luria Broth (LB) plates supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 50 µg/mL tetracycline. Grow overnight in a shaker at 37 °C.\nOn Day 1, inoculate single colonies from the freshly streaked single colonies of the HT115 E. coli bacteria carrying the rec-8 RNAi clone into 4 mL LB containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 50 µg/mL tetracycline. Grow the bacteria culture overnight in a shaker or a roller drum at 37 °C.\nThe next morning (Day 2), induce production of double stranded (ds) RNA for rec-8 W02A2.6 in the HT115 bacterial culture by adding a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG and shaking for 40 min at 37 °C.\nAfter induction, seed NGM/IPTG plates with 100 - 200 µL of HT115 rec-8 bacteria and store plates at room temperature in the dark overnight (Day 3).\nThe next morning (Day 4), add the desired nematode strain to the induced HT115 rec-8 bacteria plates as described in step 2.1 below.\n2. Generating and Isolating Tetraploids (Day 4 - 16 in Figure 2)\nOn Day 4, place 3 - 4 young L4 (fourth larval) stage hermaphrodites of the desired diploid strain on the NMG/IPTG plates seeded with HT115 rec-8 bacteria that had been induced the day before (step 1.5, above). Grow nematodes at 15 °C in the dark.",
    "Repeat steps 1.3 and 1.4 starting 3 days after step 2.1, which will be three days before the first progeny (F1s) from that step become L4s. The timing of this step will depend on how fast a nematode strain grows at 15 °C. Some diploid mutant strains are slow growers, and this timing will need fine tuning in order to isolate tetraploids.\nOn Day 8 (after 4 days of rec-8 RNAi feeding treatment), transfer 20 (2 hermaphrodites/Petri dish) of the F1 (first filial generation) L4 hermaphrodites grown in the HT115 rec-8 bacteria onto freshly induced HT115 rec-8 RNAi and allow them to self-fertilize.\n\t\nAlternatively, transfer 20 of the F1 L4 hermaphrodites grown in the HT115 rec-8 bacteria onto freshly induced HT115 rec-8 RNAi bacteria together with untreated males of the same strain (2 hermaphrodites with 4 - 6 males/plate).\nOn Day 13, start screening for F2 (second filial generation) progeny that appear long (Lon) or overall larger than the wild type; then transfer individual Lon animals onto regular OP50 or HB101 strains of E. coli bacteria. Continue screening F3 (third filial) progeny; however, F3 progeny from the same plate cannot be considered independent strains if they become established, because they could be siblings from the same already established F2 mother.\n\tNOTE: Putative tetraploids are easily identified because they are clearly longer than diploids. Wild type hermaphrodites are two thirds shorter than tetraploids. Because it is longer, a tetraploid body makes an extra turn as it moves forward by generating sinusoidal body-bending waves from head to tail (Figure 3A).\nAllow Lon worms to self-fertilize and propagate by picking Lon progeny until only Lon progeny are sired in the absence of rec-8 RNAi treatment. This may take two to three additional generations. Lon worms often are sterile and do not yield progeny.",
    "3. Verifying Tetraploid Strains (Movie 1 and Figure 3A, B)\nNOTE: Tetraploid strains can be validated by counting the number of chromosomes in their unfertilized oocytes. Fluorescent microscopy can be used to screen for the number of chromosome pairs in unfertilized diploid oocytes (prior to the meiotic divisions), if the strain has a fluorescent marker for chromosomes. In the absence of fluorescent chromosome markers, tetraploid nematodes can be screened by fixing the nematodes and staining with a DNA dye; see below for a protocol for ethanol fixing and whole-animal 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining.\nWhole animal DAPI staining\n\tNOTE: Tetraploid strains carrying 12 connected chromosome pairs can be validated by DAPI staining these animals and counting the number of DAPI bodies in its unfertilized oocytes.\n\t\nPlace 5 to 10 µL of M9 buffer31 on a microscope slide, then transfer 6 - 10 nematodes to the drop.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, draw most of the M9 from the drop without removing the nematodes with a lint-free cleaning tissue. Then, immediately add a 10 µL drop of 90% ethanol onto the worms. Allow the worms to dry completely, but for no longer than a couple of seconds.\nAs soon as the ethanol evaporates (this can be seen as it happens under the dissecting microscope), add an additional 10 µL of 90% ethanol onto the worms.\nRepeat step 3.1.3 three more times.\nOnce the last drop of ethanol has evaporated, add 6 µL of DAPI or Hoechst dye at the recommended final concentration in the mounting media of choice (for example, a 1:1,000 dilution of a 2 ng/µL DAPI stock concentration in M9). For long-term storage of the slides, 0.5% p-phenylenediamine dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, in 90% glycerol as an antifade solution, instead of M9 only, may be used.",
    "Cover the worms on the slide with a coverslip and seal the edges of the coverslip with nail polish. Score in a fluorescence microscope (step 3.1.7) at least 10 min after adding the coverslip. Slides without antifade can be stored for a few days at 4 °C before scoring, but the quality of fluorescence starts to decline after a few days.\nUsing a fluorescent microscope at 100X magnification, score the number of single DAPI bodies (presumably single chromosome pairs) in the most mature unfertilized oocyte, which is immediately adjacent to the spermatheca and has not yet entered the spermatheca or the uterus.\n\t\t\nTo score individual DAPI bodies within an oocyte nucleus, use the microscope's fine focus to move slowly from the top of the oocyte nucleus to the bottom during counting. Then, recount the same nucleus while moving the focus in the opposite direction (i.e., from the bottom to the top of the nucleus) to confirm the counted number of DAPI bodies.\nScore the most mature unfertilized oocyte in each of the two gonads in at least ten hermaphrodites per stable Lon strain. Wild type oocytes have 6 DAPI bodies on average, 5 autosome pairs, and the sex chromosome pair. The presence of 12 DAPI bodies in the oocyte of stable Lon strains indicates that the animals in this strain are either partial (4 sets of Autosomes, 3 X-chromosomes) or complete (4 sets of Autosomes, 4 X-chromosomes) tetraploids.\nCalculate the average number of DAPI bodies observed from multiple (at least 10) oocytes per strain. Some chromosome pairs will be touching or right on top of one another, so the number of DAPI bodies in an oocyte is often smaller than the actual number of chromosome pairs.",
    "(Optional) Further validate stable Lon strains where the average number of DAPI bodies is 12 to test whether they are full (4A, 4X) or partial (4A, 3X) tetraploids by immunofluorescence staining against chromosome axis proteins such as HTP-332. This staining will distinguish chromosome pairs by showing a cruciform pattern from single unconnected chromosomes present in the partial tetraploid."
