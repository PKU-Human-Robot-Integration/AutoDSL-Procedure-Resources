    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe main steps of the procedure are displayed in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], in blue boxes.\nFly head collection\nTiming: 45 min\nIn this step, heads from 5–7 day-old adult male and female flies are dissociated from the rest of the bodies and selectively collected.\nNote: This protocol is modified from a previous publication (Tian et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nCollect and freeze adult flies.\nTransfer 5–7 day-old anesthetized flies into 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nSnap freeze flies by immediately plunging the tubes into liquid nitrogen.\nPause point: Flies can be stored at −80°C at this stage.\nNote: 10–15 mL adult flies can be recovered from about 20 fly bottles.\nNote: We recommend to not collect more than 25 mL of adult flies per 50 mL Falcon tube for optimal separation of fly heads in step 2.\nDissociate heads from fly carcasses.\nVortex the tubes for 15 s and shake vigorously to separate the heads, legs, and wings from the bodies.\nRepeat this step twice or thrice.\nSelectively collect fly heads.\nAssemble the sieves pre-chilled at −20°C together, such that the sieve with the bigger mesh size (630 μm) lies on top of the sieve with the smaller mesh size (400 μm) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1673-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Material used to collect fly heads\n(A and B) Sieves of different mesh sizes (630 μm and 400 μm) are stacked such that the sieve with the bigger mesh size lies on top of the one with the smaller mesh size.\n(C) After sifting, fly carcasses are found in the upper sieve (right) while fly heads are found in the lower one (left).",
    "Transfer the frozen fly material to the assembled sieves and sift by vigorous shaking. Fly bodies are retained on the top sieve, while heads are retained on the bottom one (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Smaller elements such as legs or wings are not retained and pass through both sieves.\nTransfer the head fraction to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes using a funnel pre-chilled at −20°C and a brush. Prepare aliquot of 1 mL heads.\nStore the collected head fractions at −80°C.\nNote: For sieves of a 100 mm diameter, we recommend to not use more than 60–80 mL of adult flies in step 3.\nNote: About 1 mL of fly heads can be recovered from 30 mL adult flies.\nCritical: Step 2 must be performed in a cold room (4°C), and step 3 on powdered dry ice.\nPreparation of head lysates\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step, fly heads are crushed and lysed.\nGrind fly heads.\nCool the mortar and pestle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) with liquid nitrogen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1673-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Material used to prepare head lysates\n(A) Porcelain mortar and pestle (left) and glass Dounce Tissue Grinder and pestle (right).\n(B) Fly head powder obtained after grinding heads into liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle.\n(C) Fly head lysate obtained after homogenization with the glass Dounce Tissue Grinder.\nTransfer 1 mL of fly heads to the cold mortar.\nGrind into fine powder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: Although starting from 1 mL should work for most proteins, the amount of fly heads to be used can be optimized depending on the expression level and pattern of the tagged RBP.\nPrepare the head lysate.\nTransfer the powder to a pre-chilled 15 mL Dounce homogenizer using a brush.\nAdd 8.5 mL of ice-cold Lysis Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT).",
    "Homogenize by pushing the pestle up and down several times (typically 15–20 times) until the solution gets opaque (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: We recommend using the smaller Dounce pestle for homogenization of the head lysate.\nCritical: These steps should be performed on ice, in a cold room.\nPreparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this step, head lysates are fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and nuclear proteins are extracted (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1673-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The main steps of lysate preparation and fractionation\nThe images were taken after the indicated centrifugation steps.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C to eliminate most of the cuticular and cellular debris.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL Falcon tube. Save two aliquots: one of 100 μL for RNA extraction and one of 50 μL for protein extraction. These aliquots represent input fractions.\nSeparate cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by centrifuging at 900 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nClarify and collect the cytoplasmic fraction.\nTransfer the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) into a new 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nRepeat steps 10.a and 10.b.\nDiscard the remaining pelleted debris and transfer the supernatant to a 15 mL Falcon tube. Save two aliquots: one of 100 μL for RNA extraction and one of 50 μL for protein extraction. These aliquots represent cytoplasmic input fractions.\nExtract and collect the soluble nuclear fraction.\nWash the pellet recovered after step 9 in 1 mL of Sucrose Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT). Centrifuge at 900 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nBreak the nuclear membrane.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of Sucrose Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT) supplemented with 800 μL of High Salt Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT).\nHomogenize by pipetting up and down and incubate for 30 min on ice. Invert the tube every 5 min.\nDigest DNA.\nAdd 4.6 mL of Sucrose Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT) supplemented with 7.5 μL of CaCl2 1 M to reach a final concentration of 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2.\nAdd 75 μL of DNaseI, invert the tube several times and incubate for 15 min at 37°C. Agitate every 5 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 60 μL of EDTA 0.5 M (4 mM final concentration) and invert the tube 5 times.\nNote: This step is particularly important for chromatin-associated RNA-binding proteins.\nCollect the soluble nuclear fraction.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant (soluble nuclear fraction) into a 15 mL Falcon tube on ice. Save two aliquots: one of 100 μL for RNA extraction and one of 50 μL for protein extraction. These represent soluble nuclear input fractions.\nNote: If desired, an aliquot corresponding to the nuclear insoluble fraction can be prepared by transferring 50 μL of the nuclear fraction collected in step 11.c.iii to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, centrifuging it at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and resuspending the pellet into 50 μL of urea buffer.\nNote: To save time, we recommend performing steps 10.b and 10.c in parallel to steps 11.b.ii and 11.d.i.\nCritical: Steps 6–11 should be performed on ice (except 11.c.ii).\nImmunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged RNA-binding proteins\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this step, GFP-tagged RNA-binding proteins are immuno-precipitated from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using GFP-Trap beads.",
    "Pre-clear the cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear fractions.\nPrepare control agarose beads.\nTransfer the beads to a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: 120 μL agarose beads are used per fraction. Calculate the total amount needed (which depends on the number of conditions analyzed in parallel) and pipet the corresponding volume with a pre-cut tip.\nAdd 500 μL of Lysis Buffer (per 120 μL of beads) and gently tap the tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat two times steps 12.a.ii and 12.a.iii.\nAdd 500 μL of Lysis Buffer per 120 μL of beads, pipet up and down several times and split into independent 15 mL Falcon tubes. The number of Falcon tubes depends on the number of fractions prepared.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Use MμltiFlex flat tips to avoid pipetting the beads.\nPre-clear cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions with agarose beads.\nTransfer each nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction to one of the Falcon Tubes prepared in step 12.a.v.\nResuspend the beads by gently tapping the tubes.\nAgitate on a nutator for 30 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nImmunoprecipitate GFP-tagged proteins.\nPrepare agarose beads coupled to anti-GFP nanobody/VHH (GFP-Trap beads) as described in step 12.a.\nNote: we recommend performing step 13.a in parallel to step 12.a to spare time. Washed GFP-Trap beads can be stored on ice during step 12.b.\nImmunoprecipitate GFP-tagged proteins from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions.\nTransfer each of the pre-cleared supernatant recovered in step 12.b to one of the individual Falcon Tubes prepared in step 13.a.\nResuspend the beads by gently tapping the tubes.\nAgitate on a nutator for 1 h 30 min at 4°C.",
    "Centrifuge at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nNote: If desired, save two aliquots of the supernatant: one of 100 μL for RNA extraction and one of 50 μL for protein extraction. These represent unbound fractions.\nWash and elute the bound fractions.\nAdd 500 μL of Lysis Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT) and resuspend the beads by gently tapping the tubes.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 14.a and 14.b three times.\nRepeat step 14.a and transfer the resuspended bead solution to a 1.5 mL low binding Eppendorf tube. Save an aliquot of 20 μL for protein extraction. This represents the bound fraction.\nRepeat step 14.b and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 100 μL of Lysis Buffer (+ RNaseOUT + protease inhibitors + DTT).\nTo elute the bound RNAs, digest proteins by adding 1.5 μL of Proteinase K solution and incubating for 30 min at 55°C in a Thermomixer under agitation. Gently tap the tubes 3–4 times during the incubation.\nCollect the supernatant in a 1.5 mL low binding Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: Steps 12–14.f should be performed on ice.\nRNA extraction and purification\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, total RNA is extracted from cytoplasmic and nuclear bound fractions through TRI Reagent extraction.\nCritical: RNA should be extracted immediately after sample collection to preserve integrity.\nCritical: Both TRI Reagent and chloroform are hazardous solutions, always work under a fume hood, with gloves and lab coat, when using them.\nExtract RNA.\nAdd 600 μL of TRI Reagent in each tube and mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nNote: Tri Reagent should be in at least 4-fold excess.",
    "Pause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nAdd 150 μL of chloroform.\nShake the tubes vigorously for 15 s.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10–15 min at 4°C.\nNote: Different phases are obtained after centrifugation: a lower pink TRI Reagent-chloroform phase containing proteins, an interphase containing DNA and a colorless upper aqueous phase containing RNA.\nTilt the tube, pipet the aqueous phase and transfer into a 1.5 mL low binding Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic phase into the pipette when pipetting the aqueous phase.\nPrecipitate RNA.\nAdd 1.5 μL of GlycoBlue.\nAdd an equivalent volume (about 500 μL) of isopropanol and vortex for 5–10 s.\nPrecipitate overnight (∼12–16 h) at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4°C.\nNote: GlycoBlue corresponds to a blue dye covalently linked to glycogen. While glycogen serves as a nucleic acid co-precipitant, the attached dye increases the visibility of the pellet.\nWash the RNA pellet.\nAdd 600 μL of 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove and discard the supernatant without touching the pellet.\nCentrifuge briefly to remove potential remaining ethanol.\nNote: Remove as much ethanol as possible at this step.\nLet the pellet dry for 5–10 min at room temperature.\nCritical: Do not let the RNA pellet dry for too long, otherwise re-solubilization (step 18) will be difficult.\nResuspend the RNA pellet. Add 20 μL of RNase free-water and pipet up and down until dissolution of the pellet. Save 2–3 μL for quality check (see step 20).\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nValidation of cell fractionation and RNA integrity\nTiming: 2 days",
    "In this step, the purity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions is estimated and the integrity of recovered RNA validated.\nAssess the quality of the lysate fractionation by western-blot.\nSample and gel preparation.\nUse a pre-casted gel.\nAdd 5× Laemmli buffer to the aliquots collected in steps 8, 10.d, 11.d.ii, 13.b.iv and 14.d and boil the samples for 5 min at 95°C.\nAlternatives: Prepare a polyacrylamide gel with a percentage adapted to the molecular weight of protein(s) of interest.\nGel loading and running.\nMount the gel in the electrophoresis chamber and fill the chamber with running buffer.\nLoad samples on the gel (35 μL), including a molecular weight marker.\nRun the gel for 1 h 30 min at 110 V.\nProtein transfer.\nCut a gel-sized PVDF membrane and activate it with methanol for 1 min.\nPrepare the transfer sandwich in the gel holder cassette by positioning the gel and the membrane between foam pads and filter papers.\nPlace the cassette in the electrophoresis chamber and fill the chamber with transfer buffer.\nTransfer overnight (∼12–16 h) at 40 mA at 4°C.\nImmunoblotting.\nRinse the membrane with PBS.\nBlock the membrane with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature under agitation.\nIncubate the membrane with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight (∼12–16 h), at 4°C, under agitation.\nNote: We used a combination of two anti-Lamin antibodies recognizing different epitopes to label the nuclear fraction (dilution 1:2,000 each), anti-Tubulin antibodies to label the cytoplasmic fraction (dilution 1:5,000) and anti-GFP antibodies to label RNA-binding proteins of interest (dilution 1:2,500). References are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nWash the membrane three times with PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature under agitation.\nIncubate the membrane with fluorescent secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature, under agitation.",
    "Note: Secondary antibodies excited at different wavelengths can be combined to simultaneously detect two or more proteins.\nNote: Protect from light to avoid exciting the antibodies with ambient light.\nWash the membrane three times 10 min with PBS-Tween at room temperature under agitation.\nImage using a fluorescence Odyssey imaging system.\nAssess RNA quality.\nMeasure the concentration of RNA samples using the QuBit RNA high sensitivity assay, according to manufacturer’s indications (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%253A%252F%252Fassets.thermofisher.com%252FTFS-Assets%252FLSG%252Fmanuals%252FQubit_RNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%253A%252F%252Fassets.thermofisher.com%252FTFS-Assets%252FLSG%252Fmanuals%252FQubit_RNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf]).\nNote: Given the low concentration of bound fractions, we recommend performing high sensitivity measurements, as regular spectrophotometers tend to overestimate the concentration of poorly-concentrated samples.\nFor fractions with a concentration higher than 1 ng/μL, dilute the RNA samples with commercial RNAse-free water to reach a concentration of 1 ng/μL.\nDetermine the integrity of RNA samples with an Agilent bioanalyzer.
