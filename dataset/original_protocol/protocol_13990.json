    "The present protocol follows the ethics guidelines of the Amsterdam UMC.\n1. Operative setting and trocar placement\nPlace the patient in French position with a heating device, laying on a short grain mattress with the right arm tucked in and slightly lowered, and the left arm abducted to 90°.\nAfter all safety procedures (hood, sterile glove and sterile scrub) are ascertained, create a sterile exposition. Have the first surgeon at the robot console and the table-side surgeon between the patient's legs. Perform the procedure using a 7-port technique.\nCreate pneumoperitoneum by placing a Veress needle in the left hypochondrium, then place seven trocars as shown in Figure 2 (4 robotic, 2 laparoscopic assistants, and 1 trocar for the liver snake-retractor).\n\tNOTE: The sequence of instruments (Table of Materials) during each operative step is seen in Table 1.\nPlace the robot on the right side next to the patient and dock the arms to the previously placed trocars.\nRetract the falciform ligament ventrally using a percutaneous suture by using a straight needle.\n2. Surgical technique\nMobilization of the stomach\n\t\nOpen the greater omentum 2 cm distal from the gastroepiploic vessels using a sealing device by the table-side surgeon.\nUse the snake-retractor to retract the stomach and the left liver ventrally and cranially. Expose the anterior surface of the pancreas by dissecting the adhesions between the pancreas and the stomach and duodenum.\nIdentify the right gastroepiploic vein and artery at the lower border of the pancreas and transect these using either a sealing device, clips or an endo-stapler using a vascular cartridge.\nUltrasound of the pancreas\n\tNOTE: Now, the entire pancreas can be exposed.\n\t\nPerform an intraoperative ultra-sound to locate the MPD.",
    "NOTE: The ultrasound is integrated in the robotic console and controlled trough a grabbing point intended for a fenestrated robotic grasper.\nOpening the MPD, ligation of the gastroduodenal artery\n\t\nDetermine the trajectory of the MPD and open the pancreas with the robotic monopolar diathermia hook. Insert a 5−7 Fr, 10 cm stent in the duct which prevents cautery damage to the dorsal surface of the MPD during dissection.\nStart the pancreatic duct incision at the pancreatic neck or body; then follow the duct towards the pancreatic tail.\nFinalize by proceeding from the pancreatic body to the pancreatic head which includes crossing the gastroduodenal artery. Expose and ligate the gastroduodenal artery on both sides, just below and above the pancreatic duct with stitches and subsequently transected.\nIdentification of the Roux limb\n\tNOTE: Pulling up the small bowel to identify the Roux limb.\n\t\nReflect the transverse colon cranially to identify the ligament of Treitz and open the mesocolon in the avascular plane to the (patient's) left of the middle mesocolonic vessels.\nApproximately 30 cm from Treitz ligament, divide the jejunum using an endo-stapler. Mark the proximal end using a long suture which is retained. Pass the Roux limb through the defect and placed in close proximity to the MPD. Place the stapled end/stump of the bowel towards the splenic hilum.\nMark the future lateral jejuno-jejunostomy site by a single suture after measuring a distance of 50 cm between the pancreatic anastomosis and the lateral jejuno-jejunostomy site.\nPancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis\n\tNOTE: The Roux limb is opened with monopolar electrocautery.\n\t\nFirst, complete the caudal part of the anastomosis ('inferior border') with a single row running suture until the medial end is reached, then complete the anterior or cranial wall in the same fashion with a new running suture.",
    "NOTE: Both the layers are made using a 3-0 barbed suture (9'' 23 cm, V-20, ½ circle 26 mm needle).\nExamine the lateral pancreatojejunostomy for leaks.\n\t\tNOTE: A single stitch with a monofilament 5-0 suture (5'' 13 cm, RB, ½ circle 17-26 mm needle), can be placed over any suspected wall defects. If one single barbed suture is not enough, use a second which can be tied to the first suture.\nJejunojejunostomy anastomosis\n\t\nAid the side-to-side lateral, isoperistaltic jejuno-jejunostomy anastomosis by measuring 60 cm between the pancreatic anastomosis and the site of this anastomosis.\nAlign both small bowel loops and perform the enterotomies with monopolar electrocautery in each loop.\nThen, create an anastomosis using an endo-stapler. Close the remaining opening using a 3-0 barbed suture (9'' 23 cm, V-20, ½ 22-26 mm needle) single layer.\nDrain placement\n\t\nPlace a single tubular drain next to the LPJ site through the right trocar opening at the anterior axillary line and fix it with a single stitch to the external abdominal wall."
