    "CGNs can be prepared either from postnatal day (P) 5 mouse pups or P6 rat pups. We follow a protocol, described by Bilimoria and colleagues, which uses a mitotic inhibitor to select for postmitotic CGNs13.\nEthics statement:\nAll experiments involving live animals have been conducted according to the animal protocol approved by the \"Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit\" of Lower Saxony, Germany.\nIn vitro assay:\n1. Preparation of DNA Plasmid, Media, and Buffers for the Calcium Phosphate Transfection Method\nDissolve plasmid DNA in sterile, endotoxin-free water; DMEM (high glucose); make 2.5 M CaCl2; make 2x HBSS (dissolve 4 g NaCl, 0.1775 g KCl, 0.095 g Na2HPO4 •7H2O, 0.675 g glucose and 2.5 g HEPES in 250 ml ultrapure water and adjust pH to 7.05, 7.08, and 7.11). Note: When preparing the 2x HBSS solution, test which pH gives best results regarding transfection efficiency of given combination of plasmids.\n2. Transfection of Cultured Neurons\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/51070fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Flowchart of in vitro axon and dendrite growth assay.  Cultured CGNs (24-well plate with glass coverslips), isolated from P6 rat pups, are transfected at DIV 0 or 1 with DNA precipitate containing a fluorescent transfection marker (e.g. GFP). After fixation and immunocytochemistry, neurons are imaged in a blinded manner. Images are imported into ImageJ and processes are measured. Measurements are then processed using a statistical program.\nSeed CGNs (20 x 106 per 24-well plate; BME, 10% calf serum, 2 mM Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (PSG), 25 mM KCl) on nitric acid-washed, polyornithine-coated 12 mm glass coverslips in a 24-well plate with 500 μl of media per well.\nOn day in vitro (DIV) 0 (at least 8 hr after plating) or DIV 1, collect growth media and keep at 37 °C. Wash neurons twice with 500 μl of prewarmed DMEM and add 500 μl of DMEM.",
    "Place neurons in incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 45 min.\nPrepare 40 μl DNA precipitate for each well by mixing: DNA (2-2.5 μg/well, 10% of total DNA should be a transfection marker e.g. GFP to visualize transfected neurons), water (up to 18 μl), add 2 μl of 2.5 M CaCl2, mix well and add 20 μl of 2x HBSS.\n\t\nIncubate DNA precipitate for 5 min at RT.\nAdd DNA precipitate to each well and incubate neurons for 18 min in incubator.\nRemove DMEM/DNA mix and wash neurons twice with 500 μl of prewarmed DMEM.\nAdd collected media from step 2.2 back to neurons. If neurons will be in culture for more than 3 days, supplement media with 25 mM glucose at DIV 3 to replenish carbon source.\nAfter 1-5 days, subject neurons to immunocytochemistry using GFP antibodies.\nImage at least 30 individual neurons per condition in a blinded manner using a fluorescent microscope.\n3. Measure Axons and Dendrites with NeuronJ, an NIH ImageJ Plugin\nImportant: Ensure that Images are scaled correctluy by using appropriate pixel:μm ratio depending on magnification and resolution of image.\nConvert images to 8-bit with ImageJ: Open image, choose 'Image' -> 'Type' -> '8-bit' -> 'Save' image.\nRun NeuronJ plugin and open the 8-bit image.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot1.jpg\nUse the 'Add tracings' option to track the axon: click the left mouse button once at the beginning of the axon and move the mouse along the process. Double click on tip of axon if trace matches axonal shape.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot2.jpg\n\tNote: Should the suggested trace differ from axonal shape, click once on the axonal process to anchor trace, then double click on tip of axon.",
    "Click on 'Measure tracings', choose the 'Display tracing measurements' option and press 'Run'. Axon measurements are all displayed in a new window. For dendrites, choose the 'Display group measurements option' and press 'Run'.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot3.jpg\n\tTotal dendrite measurements are all displayed in a new window. Save them as a separate file that can be opened in any spreadsheet program.\nAlternatively for manual tracing, use Fiji software: Right click on the 'Straight line' option, choose 'Freehand line',\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot4.jpg\n\tkeep the left mouse button pressed and manually trace the process, press 'Ctrl+M' to measure.\nCalculate average axonal/dendritic length per condition and use appropriate statistical test.\nIn vivo electroporation:\n1. Equipment and Preparation of Reagents\nYou need 30 G needles, spacer (1-2 mm), syringe, dead volume reducer (DVR), electroporator, and tweezertrodes, heating pad or infrared heat lamp, gooseneck lamp and isoflurane.\nPut DVR into needle, then attach needle to syringe, and finally put spacer onto needle (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/51070fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of needle. DVR is cut off a 200 μl pipette tip and placed into the needle to reduce the dead volume. Spacer is derived from a 200 μl loading tip and is placed on the end of the needle to regulate the depth of penetration into the cerebellum to approximately 2 mm. Ruler units: cm\nDissolve DNA in PBS/0.03% Fast Green. Note: As a transfection marker, it is advantageous to use a fluorescent protein that is under a neuron-specific promoter (e.g. Synapsin) to visualize neurons only. 25% of the total plasmid amount should be the plasmid encoding the transfection marker.\nMake 70% ethanol.\nMix equal volumes of OCT and 30% sucrose dissolved in PBS.\nFill syringe with 4 μl of DNA (4 μg/μl of plasmid DNA in PBS/0.03% Fast Green).\n2. IVE of Rat Pups\nFlowchart of IVE: see Figure 3\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/51070fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Flowchart of in vivo electroporation. P4 rat pups are anaesthetized with Isoflurane and plasmid DNA encoding a fluorescent transfection marker (e.g. GFP) is injected into the cerebellum, followed by exposure to 5 electrical pulses. Five days later, isolated GFP-positive cerebella are sectioned and subjected to immunohistochemistry. Images are captured using a confocal microscope and analyzed using Imaris software. Data are processed with a statistical program.\nUse P4 rat pups from albino strain (Wistar or Long Evans).\nAnesthetize pups (one after another) with isoflurane in small box (e.g. P1000 pipette tip box) with 200 μl of isoflurane (soaked in tissue) for 1-2 min until pup is no longer moving. Take care that pups do not get into contact with Iiquid isoflurane.  Monitor time closely as individual pups respond differently to anesthesia.\nSterilize back of pup’s head with 70% ethanol.\nFix head of pup between thumb and index finger and use gooseneck lamp to locate cerebellum of albino pup. The transverse sinus sharply demarcates the midbrain (superior and inferior colliculus) from the cortical hemispheres (Figure 3). The cerebellum is located adjacent to midbrain and appears in a darker shade. Use a permanent marker to indicate the cerebellum with a dot. Important: Keep pup in fixed position! Note: Should anesthesia wear off during this procedure, expose pup to isoflurane prior to injecting the DNA.\nInsert needle (Figure 3) and slowly inject 3 μl of DNA into the cerebellum.\nLet the DNA solution diffuse for 30-60 sec.\n\t\nPlace head of pup between tweezertrodes so that the minus pole makes contact with the back of the head (cerebellar region) and that the plus pole contacts the opposite side of the head (Figure 3).",
    "Subject pup to 5 electrical pulses. Adjust voltage to weight of pups to ensure good electroporation efficiency without compromising their survival (Table 1).\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nWeight,Voltage,Pulse,Interval\n8-9 g,160 V,50 msec,950 msec\n9-10 g,165 V,50 msec,950 msec\n> 10 g,170 V,50 msec,950 msec\nTable 1. Electroporation of P4 rat pups.\nLet pups recover on heated pad or underneath an infrared lamp. Return pups to dam. Important: Make sure that heating source does not inflict any burns.\nSacrifice pups 5 days after electroporation by placing them in CO2 followed by decapitation.\n\t\nIsolate the cerebella and screen for GFP-positive ones cerebella using a fluorescent microscope.\nFix cerebella in 4% PFA O/N at 4 °C, then incubate in 30% sucrose at 4 °C until cerebella sink to bottom of tube.\nEmbed cerebella in OCT/30% sucrose and cut 40 μm coronal sections using a cryostat. Note: Section each cerebellum in a blinded manner.\nSubject sections to immunohistochemistry using the GFP antibody. Counterstain with nuclear dye (DAPI or Hoechst 33258) and determine localization of at least 200 transfected neurons per animal.\nFor an in-depth analysis, subdivide the IGL into halves, resulting in an upper IGL facing the ML and a lower IGL facing the white matter and count GFP-positive neurons residing in each half. Note: Count GFP-positive neurons of each section in a blinded manner.\n3. Measuring Dendrite Length, Acquire the Images of the Section in x, y, z Plane Using a Confocal Microscope\nNote: for example, use 40 images for a 40 μm section with a z-stwp of 1 μm.\nOpen image series in the software, Imaris, to generate a 3D image of the dendrites.\nClick on 'Surpass' mode to view the neuron in 3D.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot5.jpg\nSelect 'Add new filament' and click 'Skip automatic creation' to start semiautomatic tracing.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot6.jpg",
    "Note: Analyze each 3D image in a blinded manner\nSelect 'Draw' tab and 'AutoPath'.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot7.jpg\nMove the mouse cursor on the cell body and Shift+mouse right click to select the cell body. Note: Autocalculation by software may require a few minutes.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot8.jpg\nAdd paths to the filament (dendrite) using Shift+mouse left click. Note: Paths can be visualized in real time.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot9.jpg\nGo to filament statistics window and click on 'Detailed', 'Specific values' and 'Filament dendrite length (sum)' for sum of total dendrite length.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51070/screenshot10.jpg\nUse appropriate statistical tests to analyze data.\nSubscription Required.
