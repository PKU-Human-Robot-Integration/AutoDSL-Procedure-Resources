    "Epidermal peel harvest from Arabidopsis thaliana Label a 12-well plate according to the defined time points and genotypes, and add 1 ml of fixative solution (see Recipes) into each labeled well.Collect epidermal peels from the abaxial side of the 5th or 6th leaf using precision tweezers (Figure 1A; Video 1). Usually, 4 replicates from 4 individual plants are harvested per time point and genotype. One well contains 4 epidermal peels. See Notes 1-3 for further details.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Collection of epidermal peels from the abaxial side of an Arabidopsis leaf. This video shows the procedure for collecting epidermal peels from Arabidopsis leaves that are clean from mesophyll cells contamination. Incubate the 12-well plate containing the collected epidermal peels for at least 12 h at 4 °C in the dark. The samples can be stored in fixative solution up to 4 weeks at 4 °C. The epidermal peels are fragile and require careful handling from now onwards. See Note 4. mPS-PI stainingPerform Steps B2-B8 in a fume hood. Remove the fixative solution from the wells using a P1000 pipette (Figure 1B). Collect the waste in a glass beaker and dispose it into the halogenated liquid waste at the end of the protocol. Wash the samples by adding 1 ml of dH2O and slowly shaking the plate on the bench with circular movements. Remove the dH2O. Destain the epidermal peels by adding 1 ml of 80% ethanol and incubating at 65 °C for 5-15 min (Figure 1C). Remove the ethanol and repeat washing step (Step B3). Incubate the samples at room temperature (20 °C, RT) for 1 h in 1 ml of fixative solution. Remove the fixative solution and repeat washing step (Step B3).",
    "Add 1 ml of 1% periodic acid solution to the epidermal peels and incubate the plate for 40 min at RT. Make sure to cover the peels fully with the solution. See Note 5. Remove the periodic acid solution and repeat washing step (Step B3). Proceed carefully as peels are extremely fragile after this step.Stain the epidermal peels by adding 500 µl Schiff reagent (see Recipes) and 50 µl propidium iodide solution (1 mg·ml-1) for 20-40 min at RT. Make sure to cover the plant tissues fully with the solution. The samples should appear pinkish after this step (Figure 1D). Remove the propidium iodide solution and collect it separately in a Falcon tube. Propidium iodide waste should be treated like ethidium bromide waste. Destain the samples in 1 ml of dH2O for 20-30 min at RT.Microscope slide preparationLabel microscope slides according to the defined time points and genotypes. Perform Steps C3-C4 and C6-C7 in a fume hood.Add 70 µl of chloral hydrate solution (see Recipes) onto every microscope slide. Be careful to distribute the solution at the center of the slide to avoid leaking from the borders of the slide.Carefully transfer the stained epidermal peels onto the microscope slide containing the chloral hydrate solution using precision tweezers. Place all four replicates next to each other (as shown in Figure 1E). Peels should be as flat as possible on the slide. Be careful; the peels will rupture easily. Without placing a coverslip, transfer the microscope slides into square Petri dishes and incubate them at RT in the dark for 24 h. Remove as much chloral hydrate solution as possible from the borders of the samples using Kimtech wipes (Figure 1F). Do not touch the samples with the wipes.",
    "Place 2-3 drops of Hoyer’s solution (see Recipes) onto the epidermal peels and add a coverslip. Apply gentle pressure on the coverslip to assure that the peels are flat and even on the microscope slide.Transfer the slides back to the square Petri dishes and store them at RT in the dark for at least 3 days to allow the mountant to set (Figure 1G). See Note 6. The slides can be stored for several months in the dark. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702200222_1213.jpgFigure 1.

Acquire pictures of stomata only from mesophyll-free parts (Figures 2B and 2C) of the epidermal peels. Image stomata always with the same zoom factor (6x, Figure 2A) for data comparison.
