    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nActivation of peptidyl hydrazide\nTiming: 5 h\nThis section describes the activation of peptidyl hydrazides to thioesters by acetylacetone (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), following a similar procedure described by Flood et al.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2366-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Concise protocol of H3Q5ser semisynthesis via EPL-ADD\nSee major step 1–42.\nDissolve 3.0 μmol serotonylated H3(1–14)-NHNH2 (5.0 mg) with 0.2 M pH 3 phosphate buffer with 6M GdmCl (600 μL) in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf (EP) tube.\nAdd 0.12 mmol MPAA (20 mg) to the solution above. The final concentration of MPAA is around 200 mM, and the concentration of peptidyl hydrazide is about 5 mM.\nNote: MPAA cannot fully dissolve in this buffer, and a yellowish slurry will be obtained. But the insoluble parts would not affect the thioester formation.\nNote: MPAA may have a strong odor/smell. Handle it in the fumehood and wear a mask, goggles and gloves. Spray bleach to distinct its odor once spilled or contacted.\nSonicate the solution to facilitate the dispersion of MPAA.\nAdd 4.8 μL 0.5 M acetylacetone (2.4 μmol, 0.8 eq.).\nCritical: The acetylacetone should be added less than 1 equivalent to the serotonylated H3(1–14)-NHNH2. The remaining acetylacetone will react with the C-terminal Cys15 of truncated H3(15-135), causing uneven protein ligation and inseparable impurity in the end.\nIncubate the mixture from step 4 at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for around 5 h.\nMonitor the generation of MPAA-thioester by UPLC-MS.\nAfter completion, the MPAA-thioester is subjected to the next step without purification.\nOptional: The MPAA-thioester of serotonylated H3(1-14) can be also purified by HPLC at this step.\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nExpressed protein ligation\nTiming: 18 h\nThis section describes the expressed protein ligation (EPL) between recombinant H3(15-135) and MPAA thioester of H3(1-14) with serotonylation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Adjust the pH of the MPAA thioester solution above to around 6.0 by 6 M NaOH.\nNote: 6 M NaOH aqueous solution is corrosive and irritative. Wear gloves, goggles, and a mask to avoid direct contact with skin and eyes.\nContinue to refine the pH of the thioester solution from step 8 to 7.0 by 1 M NaOH carefully.\nCritical: Adjusting pH far above 7.0 may cause quantitative hydrolysis of MPAA thioester and self-cyclization. 1 M NaOH solution is recommended instead of the 6 M NaOH solution.\nDilute the solution with 1 mL NCL buffer to around 1.9 mM according to the serotonylated H3(1-14)-NHNH2.\nPipette the MPAA thioester solution to another 2.0-mL eppendorf tube with recombinant H3(15-135) (1.6 mg, 0.11 μmol, 1.0 eq.).\nVortex the mixture until the expressed part is completely dissolved. The final concentration of H3(15-135) is around 1.0 mg/mL (72 μM).\nIncubate the ligation at room temperature overnight (22°C–25°C, 8–12 h).\nPipette 20 μL of the step 13 reaction mixture and dilute it with 80 μL 100 mM TCEP solution.\nNote: Without addition of TCEP solution, the UPLC-MS spectrum may look messy. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nUsing 1-mL syringe, pass the diluted aliquot through PTFE membrane filter (13 mm × 0.22 μm).\nCheck the ligation progress by injecting 5 μL of filtered sample into UPLC.\nCritical: Make sure all the recombinant part is converted to the ligated product. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: This EPL reaction can be left for 48 h under room temperature (22°C–25°C), but it is recommended to proceed to the next step after the completion of the reaction.\nOnce the EPL is completed, the reaction can be subjected to the next step directly.\nExtraction of 4-Mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA)\nTiming: 30 min",
    "This section describes the MPAA extraction procedure to minimize the effect of MPAA in the following desulfurization. This step should be done in fumehood as volatile and flammable organic solvents will be involved (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPipette the EPL solution to a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 230 mg of TCEP·HCl in solid form.\nVortex the mixture until the salt is completely dissolved. The final concentration of TCEP is around 0.5 M.\nNote: Some yellow precipitation from MPAA is normal, and it will be removed in the following extraction.\nAdjust the solution pH to 3 by 6 M HCl.\nNote: Acidic pH facilitates the extraction of MPAA by organic solvent.\nAdd 2 mL ethyl acetate.\nNote: Ethyl acetate is a volatile and flammable liquid. Handle it in the fumehood and wear a mask, gloves, and goggles to avoid any direct contact.\nVortex the bi-layer mixture for a few sec.\nCentrifuge at 2,600 g for 2–5 min.\nUsing a glass pipette, remove most of the upper organic layer carefully.\nRepeat step 22–25 at least three times.\nNote: According to our determination, the residual MPAA concentration is normally below 100 μM after such extraction treatment.\nCritical: Keep all insoluble precipitation during steps 22–26. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nUse N2 or Ar flow to blow off any residual ethyl acetate on the top of the aqueous solution.\nAdd-and-done desulfurization in one pot\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the one-pot add-and-done desulfurization procedure to generate H3Q5ser after the previous expressed protein ligation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nDilute the solution above by adding 1.6 mL desulfurization buffer.\nAdjust the pH to 4.5 by 6 M NaOH. The final concentration of protein is approximately 0.5 mg/mL (36 μM).\nCritical: The pH of the protein solution should be controlled between 4 and 5. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].",
    "Add 48 μL 0.5 g/mL NaBEt4 solution through a pipette. The final concentration of NaBEt4 is around 50 mM.\nEnclose the cap of the centrifuge tube and vortex the reaction mixture for 15–30 s.\nNote: Intensive bubbling generation in this step is normal.\nCentrifuge at 2,600 g for 1 min.\nCheck the desulfurization progress by UPLC as steps 14–16.\nNote: The solution may be cloudy at first due to the formation of triethylborane. It will not affect the analysis and will gradually become clear after a few min.\nNote: See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nPurification of H3Q5ser\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the purification of the final product H3Q5ser.\nDilute the reaction mixture from step 33 to 5.0 mL by 10% (vol/vol) ACN in H2O.\nFilter the solution through 0.22 μM PTFE filter to a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the filtered solution at 2,600 g for 2 min at room temperature (22°C–25°C).\nSet up HPLC parameters according to the table in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nInject 5.0 mL of sample from step 35 into the sample loop of a manual injector.\nTurn the valve position from ‘Load’ to ‘Inject’ to trigger the HPLC UV acquisition.\nNote: Waters HPLC was used at step 39 For other HPLC model, operation may be different and it should be referred to the official manual respectively.\nCollect eluent with strong UV absorption.\nCheck fractions by UPLC to find out the desired product.\nLyophilize pure fractions to obtain the final product as a white powder."
