  "procedures": [
    "All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals under protocols approved by the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences Animal Studies Committee. All reagents and solvents were purchased and used without further purification. NOTA-RGD-peptides were prepared according to literature methods15.\nCAUTION: 68Ga emits both positron and gamma rays. All experiments, including direct or indirect contact with radioactive substances, must be undertaken by trained and permitted personnel only. When handling radioactive materials, proper protective equipment, shielding, radiation dosimeter badge and rings, and a survey meter should be used.\n1. Radiolabeling RGD-peptides with 68GaCl3\nNote: 68Ga (t1/2 = 68 min, β+ = 89%, and EC = 11%) was obtained from the 68Ga/68Ge generator.\nElute the 68GaCl3 from the generator with 4 mL of 0.05 M HCl.\nPurge with nitrogen gas at 80 °C for 30 min to dry 68GaCl3 (333 kBq, 1 mL) in a 5 mL reaction vial.\nAdd a solution of RGD-peptide (100 µg)in 1 M sodium acetate (100 µL, pH 5 - 6) to the reaction vial containing 68GaCl3 from step 1.2.\nHeat the reaction mixture at 80 °C for 5 min. Then, cool it down to room temperature.\nPurify the crude product with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Use the following system: a C-18 column, a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, a gradient slope of acetonitrile of 1.17%/min (5% - 40% in 30 min), and elution components: A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in acetonitrile, B = 0.1% TFA in water.\n\tNOTE: The HPLC is equipped with a photodiode array detector and a radioactivity detector. The 68Ga-RGD-peptide was collected at a retention time of 12.5 min (Figure 2).\nPurify the resulting 68Ga-RGD-peptide using a solid phase extraction system.",
    "Pass the solution through a C18 reverse-phase cartridge and wash with 2 mL of saline.\nElute 68Ga-RGD-peptide with 0.7 mL of 95% ethanol. Remove the solvent at 80 °C under nitrogen gas for 20 min and reconstitute with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use.\nFilter the radiolabeled product through a 0.22 µm sterile filter and formulate in 1 mL of sterile saline solution.\nCheck the radiochemical yield by radio-thin-layer chromatography (TLC).\n\t\nSpot 1 µL on an instant thin layer chromatography plate (ITLC, 10 cm in length). Develop the plate in a chamber containing the eluent (aqueous 0.1 M citric acid, pH 5.0) until 9 cm away from the spot.\n\t\tNOTE: The retention factor for 68Ga-RGD-peptide is 0 and the retention factor for unreacted 68Ga3+ is 1.\nCalculate the final specific activity from the ratio of radioactivity corresponding to the non-radioactivity as MBq/nmol.\n\tNOTE: After the injection of 100 µL of the formulated 68Ga-RGD-peptide to HPLC, the amount of non-radioactive component was calculated from the standard calibration curve using nonradioactive Ga-RGD-peptide.\n2. In Vitro Cellular Uptake\nNote: Uppsala 87 Malignant Glioma (U87MG) human glioblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were grown in 150 mm dishes at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were harvested or split by trypsinization: 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in PBS at 37 °C for 3 - 5 min.\nSeed U87MG cells into 6-well plates at a density of 1 x 106 cells/well.\nIncubate the cells with 68Ga-RGD-peptide (111 kBq) at 37 °C for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Prepare samples in triplicate.",
    "Wash the cells 2x with 2 mL of PBS and harvest by trypsinization. Use 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in PBS at 37 °C for 3 - 5 min.\nCollect the cell suspension (500 µL) and measure in a γ-counter.\nCalculate the percent uptake of the compound by the cells by % (counts in cells/total counts).\n3. In Vitro Serum Stability\nAdd 500 µL of freshly prepared mouse serum, 500 µL of human serum, and 500 µL of PBS. Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 2 h.\nEvaluate by ITLC at the specified time intervals (30, 60, 90, and 120 min). Spot 1 - 2 µL aliquot of the mixture to the ITLC plate (mobile phase: 0.1 M citric acid). Develop the plate as in step 1.7.\n\tNOTE: 68Ga3+ is expected to move with the solvent front, whereas the labeled compound will remain at the origin.\n4. Determination of Lipophilicity\nAdd 68Ga-RGD-peptide (3.7 MBq, 3.7 µL) to the octanol-PBS system (1:1, v/v, total 1 mL).\nMix the vials vigorously for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nTake 100 µL samples from each layer and measure the radioactivity with a γ-counter. The reported log P value is based on the average of three samples.\n5. Tumor Model\nNote: BALB/c nude mice (6 - 8 weeks old, female, n = 23) were used for this study. The mice were subsequently used for PET studies (n = 3) and biodistribution (n = 20) when the tumor volumes reached 200 - 300 mm3 (1 - 2 weeks after implantation).\nLoad tumor cells into 28 G, 1/2 inch insulin syringes.\nInject U87MG cells (5 x 106) in 100 µL of PBS into the left arm region.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane in oxygen gas during cell injection.\n\t\nEnsure that the mouse has been anesthetized by the loss of the pedal withdrawal reflex following pinching with forceps between the toes of the right hind foot. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n6. In Vivo Quantification of αvβ3 Integrin Using PET\nAnesthetize the mice with 2% isoflurane in oxygen.\n\t\nEnsure that the mouse has been anesthetized by the loss of the pedal withdrawal reflex following pinching with forceps between the toes of the right hind foot. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nPlace the head in the center of the PET gantry.\nIntravenously administer the 68Ga-RGD-peptide solution (7.4 MBq, 200 µL) to the xenograft mouse model via the tail vein for 1 min.\nAt the same time, perform a PET scan in list mode (dynamic scan) for 150 min.\n\tNOTE: The raw PET data were reconstructed by a user-defined time frame (i.e., every 30 min). After the PET scan, a micro-computed tomography (CT) scan (50 kVp of X-ray, 0.16 mA) was conducted for attenuation correction.\n7. Ex Vivo Biodistribution\nInject 68Ga-RGD-peptide (0.37 MBq, 200 µL) into the tail vein of the xenograft mouse model. Anesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane in oxygen gas during the injections.\n\tNote: BALB/c nude mice, as described in section 5, were divided into four groups and sacrificed at different time points (n = 5 per group).\nWake the mice immediately after the administration of 68Ga-RGD-peptide and sacrifice them at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min postinjection with carbon dioxide euthanasia.",
    "NOTE: The tissues of interest were extracted. Selected targets were the blood, muscle, heart, lung, liver, spleen, stomach, intestine, kidneys, bone, and tumor.\nWeigh the tissue and measure the radioactivity with a γ-counter.\n\tNOTE: Results were expressed as the percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g).\nSubscription Required.
