    "Preparation of cell lysates for electrophoresisGrow HEK293 (ATCC, catalog number: CRL-1573) cells on a 35 mm dish (2-5 x 105 cells) in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-Glutamine and 100-fold diluted Penicillin-Streptomycin.At 70%-90% confluence, aspirate the culture medium from each well and wash the cells with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS.After aspirating PBS, add 200 μl lysis buffer to each well and collect the cells using a cell scraper on ice.Note: Before harvesting cells, the following chemicals are added to the stock lysis buffer to make the indicated final concentrations: 0.5% DOC; 50 μM PUGNAc; 10 μM TMG; 1 mM PMSF; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After harvesting, vortex the cells vigorously and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and then transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Note: The cell lysates should be stored at -80 °C. Aliquots should be made for multiple assays. Measure the protein concentration of each sample by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.Mix 5x SDS-PAGE loading buffer with each sample (about 10-20 μg) to a final 1x concentration.Boil for 4 min at 100 °C and centrifuge briefly at room temperature (R.T.).Immuno-purification of Myc-tagged proteinsTransfect pcDNA3 plasmids encoding Myc-tagged proteins into cells using the X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Twenty-four hours after transfection, change the culture medium.After an additional incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, wash the cells with ice-cold PBS and harvest them with 200 μl lysis buffer on ice.Centrifuge the cell lysate at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and then transfer the supernatant to a new tube.",
    "Add 30 μl of protein G-sepharose beads (pre-washed with lysis buffer, 50% slurry) to the whole cell lysate and rotate for 1 h at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 3,500 x g for 1 min at 4 °C and then transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Note: The pre-clearing Steps B4-B5 help to lower the background signal in immunoblotting by depleting proteins that nonspecifically bind to beads. Add 1 μg of anti-Myc antibody to the pre-cleared supernatant and incubate for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation.Add 40 μl of protein G-sepharose beads (pre-washed with lysis buffer, 50% slurry) and then rotate for 1 h at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 3,500 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant and wash the precipitated beads with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% DOC.Note: We usually wash the beads by inverting tubes. Repeat the washing Steps B8-B9 three times in total.Add an appropriate volume (approximately equal to that of the precipitated beads) of water-diluted 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer to each sample.After vortexing, boil the samples for 4 min at 95 °C and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min at R.T..Preparation of a WGA-polyacrylamide gel layerClamp two glass plates with clips and put in a horizontal position.Note: To confirm that WGA induces the separation of O-GlcNAc proteins, we recommend making a standard acrylamide gel at the same time. To make the 7.5% acrylamide separating gel solution, mix 5 ml of 30% acrylamide solution, 5 ml of separating gel buffer (see Recipes), 10 ml of deionized water, 90 μl of 10% APS and 30 μl of TEMED by gentle inversion.Note: We usually use mini-size glass plates [100 mm (W) x 100 mm (L) x 1 mm]. Pour the separating gel solution (5 ml/plate) between the two glass plates.",
    "The height of the resulting separating gel will be approximately 5 cm. Layer water-saturated 2-butanol onto the surface of the separating gel to make a horizontal gel surface, and incubate the gel for about 20 min at R.T..Note: The concentration of acrylamide gel should be selected according to the molecular weight of the proteins of interest. The following website is useful for the decision of an appropriate gel concentration: http://www.bio-rad.com/en-jp/category/protein-gel-migration-charts?ID=N3F3TIDN[href=http://www.bio-rad.com/en-jp/category/protein-gel-migration-charts?ID=N3F3TIDN]. After gel polymerization (about 30 min), discard the 2-butanol on the surface of the separating gel and wash the top of the gel several times with deionized water.To make the WGA-polyacrylamide gel solution, mix 0.375 ml of a 10 mg/ml WGA solution (see Note), 0.25 ml of a 30% acrylamide solution, 0.25 ml of separating gel buffer, 0.119 ml of deionized water, 4.5 μl of 10% APS and 1.5 μl of TEMED by gentle inversion.Note: Freshly dissolve the WGA protein (5 mg) in 0.5 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to give a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Freezing and thawing of the WGA solution decrease the separation efficiency of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in the WGA-gel layer. Note the concentration of SDS in gels: Under the condition we used, SDS does not greatly affect the binding affinity of WGA to GlcNAc. Pour the WGA-polyacrylamide gel solution onto the top of the separating gel layer (1 ml/plate). Layer water-saturated 2-butanol onto the surface of the solution as in Step C3. Note: The best experimental conditions for the separation of the O-GlcNAcylated proteins tested in this study are a 9 mm-gel length and 3.75 mg/ml of WGA. Note that these values may vary for the separation of other O-GlcNAcylated proteins.",
    "After gel polymerization, discard the 2-butanol on the surface of the WGA-polyacrylamide gel and wash the top of the gel several times with deionized water.To make the stacking gel solution, mix 1.5 ml of a 30% acrylamide solution, 2.5 ml of stacking gel buffer, 6 ml of deionized water, 90 μl of 10% APS and 30 μl of TEMED.Pour the stacking gel solution onto the top of the WGA-gel layer (2 ml/plate), and immediately insert a gel comb into the stacking gel solution. The resulting stacking gel will be approximately 1 cm.Note: To confirm the WGA-dependent separation of O-GlcNAc proteins, a standard SDS-PAGE should also be performed using the same samples used in the WGA-SDS-PAGE experiment. The WGA and non-WGA gels can be run in parallel. Running of WGA-SDS-PAGELoad the boiled samples (cooled to R.T.) into the wells of the stacking gel.Note: During electrophoresis, the WGA-layer also induces retardation of the mobility of several proteins contained in commercially available molecular weight markers, probably because of their GlcNAc-modification. Because bacterial cells do not express OGT, bacterially expressed recombinant proteins are not modified with O-GlcNAc. Therefore, some bacterially expressed recombinant proteins, such as GST and GFP, may be able to be used as molecular weight markers in the WGA-SDS-PAGE. Run the electrophoresis at a constant current of 10 mA/gel at 4 °C until the BPB dye reaches the bottom of the separating gel.Note: The running time depends on the concentration of polyacrylamide in the WGA and separating gels. After the electrophoresis is completed, wash the separating gel with transfer buffer for 15 min at R.T..Note: The recipe of transfer buffer is described below (see Recipes).",
    "Place two layers of transfer buffer-soaked filter paper underneath the gel, and then a nitrocellulose membrane followed by another two layers of transfer buffer-soaked filter paper on top of the gel.Note: Depending on the molecular weight of the protein of interest, choose an appropriate pore size (0.2 or 0.45 μm) of nitrocellulose membrane. Run the transfer at 4 °C in transfer buffer in the transfer apparatus.Note: It is preferable to use a wet/tank blotting system to avoid heating (at constant-current condition of 0.42 mA for 4 h at 4 °C). Immunoblotting analysis Incubate the nitrocellulose membranes with 4% skim milk in TBST (see Recipes) for 1 h at R.T..Rinse the membrane three times with TBST for 5 min each time.Incubate the membrane in primary antibody solution (1 h at R.T. or overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking).Note: For detection of protein O-GlcNAcylation using anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (e.g., RL2), the primary antibody solution must consist of 3% BSA/TBST to avoid increasing the background signal. Rinse the membrane three times with TBST for 5 min each time.Incubate the membrane in secondary antibody solution (1 h at R.T.).Rinse the membrane three times with TBST for 5 min each time.Visualize the antibody-bound proteins on the membrane by using ECL.Note: Use the appropriate volume of ECL solution according to the manufacturer's manual. Before ECL reaction, extra TBST on the membrane should be removed with paper towel. After incubation with ECL solution, remove the extra liquid as well."
