    "Dilute 25 ml of buffy coat (initial leukocyte concentrate from a whole blood donation) with the same volume of DPBS.   Prepare two 50 ml tubes with 15 ml Ficoll-Paque PLUS. Carefully layer 25 ml of the diluted blood sample on Ficoll-Paque PLUS. Important: when layering the sample do not mix Ficoll-Paque PLUS and the diluted blood sample.   Centrifuge at 400 x g for 25 min at 18-20 °C. Important: brakes off.    Soak up the white interphase between the diluted plasma fraction and the transparent ficoll fraction with a pipette and transfer it into a fresh tube.   Wash twice with DPBS.   Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml DPBS.   In a cytometer tube mix 3 μl of FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody plus 60 μl DPBS and 20 μl of cellular suspension.   Incubate 15-18 min at room temperature.   Add 120 μl DPBS and count the number of CD14+ monocytes by flow cytometry using Perfect-Count MicrospheresTM according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   Plate monocytes at 1 x 106 cells/ml in 60-mm culture plates, in RPMI 1640 medium without serum, and allow to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2.    Remove the non-adherent cells by washing in DPBS. The final population of adherent cells contains 75-80% of monocytes, as demonstrated by flow cytometry of anti-CD14–stained isolates.   Generate monocyte-derived DCs by supplementing the monocyte cultures with 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium plus GM-CSF (800 IU/ml) and IL-4 (500 IU/ml).   At day 3 add 1ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium plus GM-CSF (800 IU/ml) and IL-4 (500 IU/ml).   For DC maturation, at day 5 replace the old medium with fresh complete RPMI 1640 medium plus GM-CSF (800 IU/ml) and IL-4 (500 IU/ml) and stimulate the immature DCs for 48 h with 5 μg/ml LPS.",
    "Harvest the non-adherent cells floating in the culture medium in a 15 ml tube (at day 5 for immature DCs; at day 7 for mature DCs). Add 2 ml DBPS (37 °C), rinse and collect the adhered cells by pipetting. Wash twice more with DPBS and pool both floating and adherent cells. Centrifugue and resuspend the pellet in 500 μl of complete medium.   Prepare two cytometer tubes with 60 μl of complete medium plus 4 μl DQ-OVA (stock: 1 mg/ml) at 37 °C or 0 °C.    Prepare two cytometer tubes with 60 μl of complete medium plus 6 μl Lucifer Yellow CH (stock: 10 mg/ml) at 37 °C or 0 °C.    Add 100 μl of cell suspension (~ 2 x 105 cells/ml) to each cytometer tube.   Incubation time: 15 min for DQ-OVA; 120 min for Lucifer Yellow CH. The fluorescence of OVA labeled with BODIPY FL dye (DQ-OVA) is self-quenched until the OVA is taken up via the mannose receptor and degraded only by endolysosomal proteases. Lucifer Yellow CH (LY) is a hydrophilic tracer for fluid-phase macropinocytosis. LY is not degraded and is nontoxic at concentrations up to 6 mg/ml.    Stop the incubations by adding 1 ml cold FACS buffer.   Wash the cells two times with cold FACS buffer.   Analyze the incorporated fluorescence of both immature DCs (Figure 1) and mature DCs using flow cytometry. Compare the histograms and corresponding mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) between cells incubated at 37 °C (specific uptake) and cells incubated at 0 °C (non-specific uptake: passive diffusion,…).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131115/20131115045214_8431.jpg Figure 1. Analysis of the endocytic activity of immature DCs by flow cytometry. The endocytic activity of monocyte-derived immature DCs was assessed measuring the uptake of the fluorescent reporters DQ-OVA (receptor-mediated endocytosis) and Lucifer Yellow CH (fluid-phase endocytosis). Representative histograms are shown.",
