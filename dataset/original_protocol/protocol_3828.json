    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue cryosectioning\nTiming: 30 min/block\nThe following tissue processing steps are recommended for obtaining optimal frozen sections for confocal imaging.\nSet up the cryostat as described in Materials and Equipment section.\nTransport the OCT frozen tissue block in dry ice to a cryostat.\nAllow tissue block to reach cryostat chamber temperature for approximately 30 min.\nCritical: The sample must be kept frozen solid at all times. Do not let the block thaw or soften.\nUse a razor blade to cut the OCT frozen tissue block to size (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nApply OCT to a specimen disc at 20°C–22°C and place the frozen tissue block on top. Transfer it immediately to the quick freeze shelf inside the cryostat until completely frozen (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: The specimen disc must be at 20°C–22 °C when placing the tissue block. This step is key to guarantee proper adhesion to the tissue block and avoid movements or detachments when sectioning.\nCut sections according to the desired thickness (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. OCT block preparation before sectioning, related to steps 4 and 5\nCritical: Be cautious during sectioning as cryostat blades are very sharp.\nNote: A brush can be useful to flatten the emerging section, in case the tissue sticks to the anti-roll plate when cutting (Troubleshooting 3).\nTransfer the tissue section to a slide at 20°C–22°C by gently touching the frozen tissue with the slide. The sections will immediately melt on the slide due to the temperature difference (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], Troubleshooting 4).\nNote: Try to collect each section in less than 30 seconds to avoid freeze-drying of the tissue.",
    "Note: Minimum two sets of sections are collected, a first set for immunostaining control and a second set for germinal center staining.\nAlternatives: Poly-L-Lysine coated slides improve adhesion of tissues to the slide.\nLeave the slide containing tissue sections air-dry for 20 min at 20–22°C. Insufficient drying may cause the section to detach from the slides.\nSectioned tissues can be stored in an airtight slide holder inside a −80°C freezer until required for the immunofluorescence staining.\nNote: Left-over tissue can be stored back into disposable cryomold with a layer of OCT on top to prevent freeze-drying during storage at −80°C.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Tissue sectioning using a cryostat, related to steps 6 and 7\nImmunofluorescence staining\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis segment describes how to stain spleen sections to identify germinal centers structures with the antibodies optimized for this protocol. If alternative primary and secondary antibodies are used they should be validated first.\nRemove slides from −80°C and air-dry them under airflow for 30 min at 20°C–22°C (e.g., hood, or fume cabinet).\nDraw an unbroken circle around tissue sections with a PAP pen to create a hydrophobic barrier, and leave for 15-30 min until the wax has completely dried (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/745-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Immunofluorescence staining steps\n(A) Hydrophobic barrier around spleen section.\n(B) Slides rehydration in a staining jar.\n(C) Example of humidified chamber containing slides.\n(D) Dark humidified chamber kept in fridge for 12–16 hours.\nCritical: Use PAP pen only with adequate ventilation and read the safety data sheet before use.\nNote: Do not touch or get too close to the tissue with the PAP Pen.\nRehydrate slides: Transfer slides to a staining jar or dish and wash them three times for 5 min with Wash Buffer at 20°C–22°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Note: After rehydration it is important to keep slides hydrated at all times. This can be achieved by using a humidified chamber during the staining procedures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). High background levels can be observed during confocal images acquisition, if tissue is allowed to dry during the staining (Troubleshooting 5).\nMinimize non-specific binding of primary and secondary antibodies by adding blocking buffer for 60–120 min at 20°C–22°C. To prevent interactions with the tissue or with the primary/secondary antibodies, select the appropriated type of normal serum.\nNote: We recommend using clones 8D9 or 8C12 when detecting Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs), as we observed other monoclonal antibodies produced non-specific binding, potentially due to the high levels of Fc receptors present in FDCs. To overcome this issue, we suggest the addition of Fc block into the blocking buffer.\nWash slides with Wash Buffer three times for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nBlock endogenous biotin: to eliminate background caused by endogenous biotin we use a Streptavidin/Biotin Blocking Kit before adding the biotin-labeled probe (refer to Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nIncubate each tissue section with streptavidin solution for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse quickly with Wash Buffer solution.\nIncubate for 15 minutes with the biotin solution at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse quickly with Wash Buffer solution twice.\nNote: These steps should be performed prior to the addition of primary antibodies.\nPermeabilization: add Permeabilization buffer freshly prepared and incubate for 30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCritical: Because the Permeabilization buffer contains a high Triton X-100 concentration, this step should be carefully timed. Otherwise, too much permeabilization can lead to loss or artifactual redistribution of the target (Jonkman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nWash slides with Wash Buffer three times for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.",
    "Primary antibody staining: Prepare primary antibody dilutions (refer to Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and pipette this mix onto the slide making sure each section is completely covered (depending on the size of the hydrophobic circle, 30–60 μL per section is usually enough).\nThe primary antibody cocktail includes: Alexa Fluor 647 rat anti-mouse IgD (1:200), FITC rat anti-mouse Ki-67 (1:100), biotin rat anti-mouse CD21/CD35 (1:400) and unconjugated hamster anti-CD3ε (1:200) in antibody diluent (1% BSA in Wash Buffer solution).\nIncubate the covered slide in a dark humidified chamber for 60–120 min at 20°C–22°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPause Point: This step can be done for 12–16 hours at 4°C.\nNote: Always include controls, e.g., minus primary antibody, secondary antibody alone and/or isotypes control.\nWash slides with Wash Buffer three times for 5 min at 20°C–22°C to remove unbound antibodies.\nSecondary antibody staining: Prepare secondary antibody dilutions (see Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and pipette this mix onto the slide making sure each section is completely covered.\nThe secondary antibody cocktail includes: Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-hamster IgG (1:1000) and BV421-SAv (1:1000), in antibody diluent (2% Normal Goat serum in Wash Buffer solution).\nIncubate the covered slide in a dark humidified chamber for 60–120 min at 20°C–22°C.\nPause Point: This step can be done for 12–16 hours at 4 °C.\nNote: Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies are stored in small aliquots at −20°C. Once thawed, they are kept at 4°C.\nQuickly rinse slides two times with Wash Buffer.\nPour off the Wash Buffer and quickly rinse with 1×PBS.\nWipe off excess 1×PBS without disrupting the tissue (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nMount the tissue with mounting medium (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nAdd a drop of mounting medium directly onto the tissue and gently place coverslip on top using forceps to get rid of any bubbles.",
    "Dry slides at 20°C–22°C until mounting medium has set.\nNote: Be careful to avoid the formation of air bubbles, as this will make imaging more difficult.\nStore dried slides at 4°C for imaging.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Coverslipping slides for immunofluorescence imaging, related to steps 23 and 24\nConfocal image acquisition\nTiming: ~ 5 min/tissue section\nIn this section we describe in detail the microscope settings for experiments aimed at imaging of germinal center structures using the Zeiss LSM 780 system and Zen black edition software. Although each immunofluorescence staining will require some adjustment of these parameters, we outline settings that can be used as a starting point.\nPlace the microscope slide onto the stage of the microscope ensuring the coverslip is facing the objective lens.\nSelect a high Numerical Aperture (NA) plan apochromatic air objective, e.g., 20× 0.8 NA Plan Apo.\nUsing the stage x/y controller (e.g., joystick) position the slide so that the tissue section is directly in front of the objective lens. If the tissue is very thin it can be helpful to mark the location of the section on the slide using a fine-tip pen.\nUsing the “Locate” tab in Zen, select an appropriate filter set to observe the sample by eye e.g., “FITC”. Check that light is coming out of the objective lens (it will appear blue with the FITC filter set). Look down the eyepieces to focus the sample and position to a region of interest.\nNote: Ki67+ cells-FITC labeled can be used to locate the region of interest easily.",
    "Using the “Acquisition” tab, set up the channel configuration (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The four-dye combination Brilliant Violet 421 (BV421), FITC, Alexa Fluor 568 (AF568) and Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) can be imaged using a two-track configuration with minimal risk of bleed-through. Using the Imaging Setup and Channels windows, assign BV421+AF568 to Track 1 and FITC+AF647 to Track 2.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/745-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Confocal settings using of Zen black software for imaging germinal centers\n(A) Channels configuration.\n(B) Scanning parameters configuration.\n(C) Detectors optimization.\nNote: For the fastest acquisition times the system needs to operate in “Line Switching” mode. This will only work if each dye is assigned to a separate detector and no filter/mirror changes are required between tracks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: BV421 may not appear as an option in the dye dropdown in the Imaging Setup window. Select DAPI as an alternative.\nConfigure the scanning parameters in the Acquisition Mode window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]). With a 20× 0.8 NA lens, sufficient sampling will be achieved using a 1024×1024 scan at 1× zoom (pixel size 0.42 μm). Other parameters as follows: Scan Mode = Frame; Line Step = 1; Speed = 7–10 (a higher value indicates a faster speed, which will be possible if the signal is strong i.e., Gain <700); Averaging = 1, 2 or 4 (increasing averaging improves signal: noise, but increases the scan time. If the signal is strong i.e., gain <700, then use a value of 1); Mode = Line; Method = Mean; Bit Depth = 8 bit; Direction = <-> (this indicates bi-direction scanning which halves the time required to take the image but may result in “fringing” artifact. When scanning, look carefully at the image and use the Corr X & Corr Y sliders to remove any artifact).",
    "Optimize the detectors. As an approximate starting configuration, set each of the Channels to 2% laser power, Gain (Master) = 700, Digital Offset = 0, Digital Gain = 1. Deselect one Track and in the remaining active Track ensure only one detector is active. Start the scanning using the “Live” button. Use the fine focus on the microscope to ensure the focal plane is adjusted to give strongest signal. Apply the Range Indicator palette by ticking the Range Indicator checkbox (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]). Adjust the laser power and or/Gain (Master) to give a bright image, but avoid saturation (red pixels). Ideally the laser power should be kept below ~5% to avoid bleaching and the Gain (Master) below ~750 to avoid high noise. Adjust the Digital Offset to maximize contrast in the image, but avoid zero value pixels (blue pixels). Repeat this process for all detectors in all tracks.\nEnsure all detectors and all tracks are turned on.
