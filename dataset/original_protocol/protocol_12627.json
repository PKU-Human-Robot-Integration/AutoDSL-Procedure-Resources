    "1. Preparation\nSample treatment\n\t\nCarefully dissect fresh S. nudus (100 g) and collect the intestine and its inner fluid.\nAdd 300 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (0.02 M, pH 7.4) for homogenization (1,000 rpm, 60 s).\nFreeze-thaw the homogenate 3x.\nCentrifuge the sample (10,956 × g, 0.5 h, 4 °C) and collect the supernatant. Store the sample at 4 °C until further use.\nProtein precipitation\n\t\nMix the supernatant with saturated ammonium sulfate solution (nine volumes) and let the mixture stand for 12 h at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here and continued later.\nCentrifuge (10,956 × g, 0.5 h, 4 °C) to obtain the protein precipitate; store it at 4 °C for later use.\nProtein resuspension\n\t\nResuspend the protein precipitate with 30 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (0.02 M, pH 7.4). Store this crude protein solution at 4 °C for later use.\n2. Affinity chromatography\nSolution filtration\n\t\nFilter the crude protein solution through a 0.22 µm filter membrane. Store this sample at 4 °C for later use.\nColumn packing\n\t\nPack the arginine-agarose matrix affinity chromatography column and lysine-agarose matrix affinity chromatography column by loading an appropriate amount of lysine-agarose matrix medium and arginine-agarose matrix medium into 5 mL empty chromatography columns.\n\t\tNOTE: The column can be stored at 2-8 °C, with the matrix immersed in store buffer (20% ethanol).\nAffinity purification\n\t\nEquilibrate the affinity chromatography column with ddH2O first (1 mL/min, 10 column volumes), followed by Tris-HCl buffer (0.02 M, pH 8.0, 1 mL/min, 5 column volumes).\nLoad the protein solution sample onto the pre-equilibrated column (1 mL/min, 1/3 column volume).\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of sample loading is dependent on the concentration of sFE.\nWash the column with Tris-HCl buffer (0.02 M, pH 8.0, five column volumes).",
    "Elute the column with 0.15 M, 0.25 M, 0.35 M, 0.45 M, 0.55 M, and 0.65 M NaCl (1 mL/min, five column volumes) successively.\nLook for the elution peak that should appear in the 0.15 M NaCl elution, and then collect the fractions in 5 mL tubes.\nConcentrate the elution sample using a 3 kD ultra centrifugal filter (3,944 × g, 1.5 h, 4 °C). Store this sample at -80 °C for later use.\n3. Purity assessment\nSodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel preparation\n\t\nPrepare the SDS-PAGE gel according to Laemmli's method using 5% concentrated gel and 12% separation gel13.\nElectrophoresis\n\t\nMix the sample (15 µL) with 5x SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer (1/4 volume), heat in boiling water for 5 min, load onto the SDS-PAGE gel, and run the gel at 80 V, 60 mA for 1.5 h.\nAnalysis\n\t\nAfter electrophoresis, stain the gel with a Silver Stain Kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol, and observe the stained gel using a chemiluminescent imaging system.\nAnalyze the purity of the target protein using the following formula: purity of target protein = intensity value of target protein/intensity value of total protein.\n4. Fibrinolytic activity evaluation\nFibrin plate preparation\n\t\nPrepare the fibrinogen solution by mixing 25 mg of fibrinogen with 1.25 mL of physiological saline.\nPrepare the thrombin solution by completely mixing 100 U of thrombin with 1.05 mL of physiological saline.\nPrepare the agarose solution by adding 0.5 g of agarose to 22.5 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (0.02 mol/L, pH 7.4). Mix and heat the agarose solution at 100 °C until dissolved completely.\nCool the agarose solution down to around 50 °C and add fibrinogen solution. Then, immediately add the thrombin solution, mix them quickly, and pour them into a 60 mm culture dish.\nLoading",
    "Punch 3 mm wells on the prepared fibrin plates using a sterile borer and fill the wells with 10 µL samples.\nAnalysis\n\t\nAfter 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, measure the fibrinolytic activity by calculating the size of their degrading zones. Fibrinolytic activity = (zone size of the sample/ zone size of urokinase) x 100 U. Zone size = diameter x diameter.\n\t\tNOTE: Physiological saline buffer, crude protein (sample obtained in protocol step 1.3.1), and urokinase were used for the blank, negative control, and positive control, respectively. Compared to urokinase, we found that the fibrinolytic activity of the purified sFE was ~19,200 U/mL.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
