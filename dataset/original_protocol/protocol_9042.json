    "1. Startle-induced Negative Geotaxis Assay\nSelect flies of the desired genotype, separate them by gender, randomly group them in cohorts of 20-30 animals and flip them into new food vials every 2-3 days; test each set of flies (i.e. age-matched cohorts, one cohort/genotype) at least once a week.\nThirty minutes before the negative geotaxis test, anesthetize the flies with CO2 and place them in pre-labeled clear plastic tubes made with two empty food vials (see Materials Table) joined at their openings with clear tape (chamber dimensions: 19 cm x 2.85 cm). In our assays we typically use 25 flies/tube.\nNote. The recovery time from anesthesia can be varied from few minutes to several hours (e.g. O/N) and should be optimized for the specific genotypes tested.\nMark different heights (from 1 to 20 cm) on a piece of blotting paper and tape the paper on a vertical surface, perpendicular to the bench.\nPlace the tubes in front of the paper: the tubes should be all aligned and as close as possible to the paper to allow accurate height measurement.\nPlace the digital camera (see the \"Special Equipment\" Table) in front of the tubes, at a distance of 20-30 cm from the paper, on a stand (e.g. a pipette tip box), select the \"movie\" option and start recording; at this time you should also start a timer to keep track of the time between consecutive trials.\nAllow the flies to collect at the bottom of the tube by tapping the tube for few seconds (e.g. 10 sec). This step should be performed consistently (i.e. same duration, same strength, same operator) throughout the whole experiment.\nRecord flies' movements with the digital camera for 10 sec.\nRepeat steps 1.5-1.7 fourteen times at one-min intervals.\nAnalyze data:",
    "Count the number of flies that are above the 2 cm mark after 10 sec by visual inspection of the recorded movies.\nNote: In our assay conditions the flies' negative geotaxis behavior didn't last beyond the first 10 sec after startling (i.e. flies started moving in all directions 10 sec after startling them). The minimum distance climbed by control flies (i.e. 1 week old flies expressing the THGal4 driver, see legend of Figure 1) in this time window was 2 cm. Thus, we used the 2 cm mark as a reference for analyzing the climbing activities of flies of different ages and genotypes 10 sec after initiating the behavior. These parameters may require adjusting to account for differences in behavior of the flies tested (due for example to different genetic backgrounds or laboratory conditions). Notice that in our assay conditions, all the genotypes tested performed worse or similarly to the flies of the control genotype.\nTake the average of the results from the fifteen trials.\nExpress average as a percentage of the total number of flies in the tube (= % climbing activity); the number of repeats (N) is given by the number of independent cohorts tested for each genotype\nAssess statistical significance between different genotypes over time. This can be accomplished with a Student's t test (when comparing two genotypes) or a 2-way ANOVA analysis followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test (when performing multiple comparisons) using commercial softwares such as GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc.La Jolla, CA, USA).\nNote\nWe perform all our assays at the same time of the day, at RT and under the same light conditions. Keeping the flies in a 12 hr light/dark cycle environment is advisable to control for the effect of circadian rhythms on the flies' locomotor behavior.",
    "2. Tyrosine Hydroxylase Immunofluorescence Assay of Whole Brain Mounts\nSolutions and buffers\nFixative solution: 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)\nWashing buffer: 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS\nBlocking buffer: 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA\nMounting media: Mowiol-Dabco (see protocol described in Harlow E, Lane D., Antibodies- A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 10:418 (1988))\nProcedure\nPut flies in a dissection dish filled with 70% EtOH for about 1 min to remove the cuticle wax.\nTransfer flies to another dissection dish filled with ice-cold PBS.\nDissect the brain:\n \nPlace the fly with the ventral side up (optional: remove wings and legs).\nPull the head away from the body: use one set of forceps to hold on to the body and another one to hold on to the cuticle under the eye to prevent damaging the brain\nRemove the proboscis.\nHold on to the head cuticle on opposite sides of the slit left open after removing the proboscis and pull in opposite directions until the brain is removed from the head capsule.\nRemove all cuticle from the brain.\nRemove all the air-filled tracheal tissue; this will prevent the brain from floating during the following incubation steps.\nCut a few millimeters off the tip of a P-200 pipette tip and equilibrate it with a 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS solution\nUsing the prepared P-200 pipette tip, transfer the brains to a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube filled with 0.5 ml of 4% PFA/PBS and keep on ice until the dissection is complete.\nFix the brains at RT for 20 min: apply a gentle rotation by putting the Eppendorf tubes on a rack and placing the rack on a nutator.",
    "Remove the fixative using a P-1000 micro pipette, add 0.5 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, mix by inversion and let incubate for 1 min; repeat this washing step once.\nRemove the buffer from the second wash, add 0.5 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS and let incubate at RT for 20 min; repeat this step twice.\nRemove the washing buffer and let the brains incubate in blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA) for 1 hr at RT.\nIncubate the brains with a 1:100 dilution of anti-TH antibody (see the \"Table of specific reagents\") in blocking solution, for two days, at 4 °C, with gentle rotation (see step 2.6.).\nRepeat washing steps 2.7. and 2.8..\nEquilibrate the brains with a 1:200 dilution of secondary antibodyin blocking solution, for two days, at 4 °C, with gentle rotation.\nRepeat washing steps 2.7. and 2.8..\nPrepare the mounting slides as illustrated in Figure 2A:\n \nAdd 2 X 25 μl drops of mounting media to a cover glass (24 x 60 mm, no. 1.5).\nPlace two cover glasses (size 18 x 18 mm, no. 2) on the mounting media leaving a gap in the middle of the slide and let dry.\nNote. Check the sample holder on the stage of your confocal microscope. You can make the cover glass the same size of a 25 x 75 mm slide by attaching a 22 x 22 mm 1.5 cover glass to one of the ends (use nail polish and tape).\nRemove the washing buffer, add 50 μl of mounting media and allow the brains to equilibrate with it by pipetting up and down.",
    "Using a cut P-200 pipette tip (see step 2.4) transfer the brains to the slide in the space between the two coverslips and cover them with a coverslip no. 1.5 (see Figure 2A; to orient the brains on the slide see 7).\nNote: the samples are mounted between two cover glasses to allow visualization of both the anterior and the posterior side of the brain.\nFill the whole space between the cover glasses with mounting media; pipette from one corner to remove all the air; let dry and seal with nail polish.\nTo assess the number of dopaminergic neurons in a specific cluster acquire a series of optical sections along the z-axis with a 1.0 μm step-size using a confocal microscope (for the anatomical identification of dopaminergic clusters in the Drosophila adult brain see 7).\nSubscription Required.
