    "This protocol is suitable for culturing cells in four wells of 24-well plates. If preparing multiple samples or plates, the amounts of the reagents should be increased accordingly.\n1. Preparation of the collagen I mixture\nNOTE: Collagen I and basement membrane matrix gel quickly at room temperature. Therefore, collagen should be handled on ice (2 °C to 8 °C). All the tips and tubes used must be prechilled unless otherwise indicated. All the procedures should be performed in a safety hood.\nPlace all the reagents and centrifuge tubes on ice.\nSlowly pipette 0.48 mL of collagen I (5 mg/mL) and 0.1 mL of 10x minimum essential medium (MEM) (with phenol red) into a sterile 15 mL centrifuge tube kept on ice. Mix well by pipetting up and down gently.\nAccording to the color palette of the phenol red indicator, use an appropriate volume of 7.5% (w/v) NaHCO3 (approximately 0.2 mL) to adjust the phenol red indicator to orange, which indicates that the pH value is in the range of 7.0-7.4.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the pH of the medium, a volume of NaHCO3 is used to bring the pH to approximately 7.0-7.4. Additionally, NaOH is used for pH neutralization.\nBring the final volume of the mixture up to 1 mL by adding an appropriate volume of ddH2O. Mix well by pipetting gently up and down to prepare for use.\n\t​NOTE: The final volume of ddH2O will depend on the amount of NaHCO3 or NaOH used in step 1.3.\n2. Preparation of the cell-matrix mixture\nSlowly pipette 0.9 mL of basement membrane matrix into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube on the ice.\nCulture the IDG-SW3 cells in a T25 flask with 4 mL of complete medium (alpha-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) supplemented with 50 U/mL INF-γ at 33 °C.",
    "Once the IDG-SW3 cells reach 90% confluency, remove the medium, and wash the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4 throughout the protocol) with a pipette. Digest the cells with 0.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37 °C for 30 s.\nInactivate the trypsin by adding 3.5 mL of complete medium (alpha-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]). Transfer the 4 mL cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nSpin down the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of the complete medium on ice.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and adjust the final cell density with the complete medium to 4 × 105 cells/mL. Add 0.1 mL of the prepared cell suspension to 0.9 mL of the extracellular matrix from step 2.1. Mix well by pipetting gently up and down.\n\tNOTE: If a cell-free control is needed, add 0.1 mL of the complete medium to 0.9 mL of extracellular matrix as a negative control.\n3. Plating the cell-gel mixture\nGently, mix well the two mixtures from step 2.6 and step 1.4 to 2 mL by pipetting up and down on the ice. Pipette 0.5 mL of the final mixture into each well (four wells of a 24-well plate). Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h to form a cell-gel mixture.\nAdd 0.5 mL of osteogenic medium (complete medium containing 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid and 4 mM β-glycerophosphate, also known as osteogenic induction medium)4 to the cell-gel mixture in each well to start the osteogenic differentiation at 37 °C. Consider this as Day 0.\nEvery 2 days, replace half the medium with fresh osteogenic medium maintained at 37 °C. Continue the culturing for 35 days.",
    "4. Identifying the cell viability and cellular dendrites using a confocal microscope\nCell staining\n\tNOTE: Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM) is a cell-permeant dye that can be used to determine cell viability. Ethidium homodimer-I (EthD-1) does not cross the membrane of intact/viable cells9. Thus, calcein AM/EthD-1 can be used to identify cell viability and cellular dendrites.\n\t\nOn Day 1 and Day 7 of the culture, remove the calcein AM stock solution (4 mM in DMSO) and EthD-1 stock solution (2 mM in DMSO/H2O 1:4 [v/v]) from the freezer, and allow them to warm to room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The mineralized matrix has a strong autofluorescence signal, so the preosteocyte stage without Dmp1 expression within 7 days of culturing4 is more suitable for the observation of cell staining.\nAdd 4 µL of the 2 mM EthD-1 stock solution and 5 µL of the 4 mM calcein AM stock solution to 2 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS), and mix well. This gives approximately 2 µM calcein AM and 4 µM EthD-1 as working solutions.\nPipette 0.5 mL of the working solution into the wells in the 24-well plate. Incubate for 30-45 min at room temperature to stain the cell-gel matrix.\nAfter incubation, add approximately 0.5 mL of fresh D-PBS to a new 35 mm glass-bottom culture dish. Cover the dish to prevent contamination or drying of the samples.\nUsing elbow-tipped forceps, carefully transfer the stained cell-gel matrix from step 4.1.3 into the 35 mm culture dish from step 4.1.4. Avoid damaging or shearing the cell-gel matrix.\nView the labeled cells under a laser confocal fluorescence microscope.\nMicroscope scanning set",
    "Place the 35 mm dish on the stage. Select the regions of the cell-gel matrix to be scanned through the eyepiece using a 10x objective. Higher-magnification objectives are not recommended due to the size of the extended dendrites.\nSelect the optical filters. Calcein can be viewed as green with a standard fluorescein bandpass filter, and EthD-1 can be viewed as red with filters for propidium iodide or Texas Red dye. Select the \"line mode\" for scanning and set the \"pinhole\" to 2 µm.\nSelect a data depth of 8 bit data depth and an image resolution of 1,024 pixels x 1,024 pixels.\nImage using sequential line scanning with the optimal laser and detector settings (keep a minimal laser energy to avoid potential photobleaching).\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal detector setting depends on the final fluorescence signals.\nCollecting a \"z-stack\" of images\n\t\nAccording to the green channel signal, define the top and bottom positions of the cell-gel matrix to be scanned by focusing through the sample while continuously scanning, .\nOnce the top and bottom of the sample have been specified, select the desired scanning frame. Start scanning. The sample will be scanned from the top to the bottom with the selected settings from step 4.2, generating a gallery of images.\nCell viability identification.\n\t\nSelect one slice from step 4.3. The green and red channels indicate live and dead cells, respectively.\nCell dendrite identification.\n\t\nSelect the single green channel to generate 3D reconstructions with the image acquisition software. The depth information is displayed as a series of rainbow pseudocolor images. The dendrites located at the bottom of the gel are displayed in red, whereas those at the top are displayed in blue.\n5. Identifying appearance using a stereomicroscope",
    "On Day 1, Day 7, Day 21, and Day 35 of the culture, remove the culturing medium, and wash the gels in the plate twice with D-PBS. Add 0.5 mL of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in D-PBS to the well to fix the cell-gel matrix in the plate for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove the paraformaldehyde in the well and wash the cell-gel matrix two more times with D-PBS in the plate. Leave 0.5 mL of D-PBS in each well for imaging.\nPlace the plate on the stage and select the optimal position through the eyepiece using a 0.5x objective. Image the full-field view of the cell-gel matrix in the plate individually using \"automatic exposure\" under the bright field.\n6. Identifying mineral deposition with an XRF assay\nOn Day 35 of the culture, check whether the liquid nitrogen is sufficient. Start the XRF system. Open the sample room and transfer the gels with elbow-tipped forceps from the plate to the middle of the sample stage of the instrument. Close the sample room and wait for 30 min to allow the instrument to cool before use.\nSet the \"Exposure time\" to 35 ms, the \"Spectrum range\" to 0-40 keV, and the \"Electric current\" to 770 µA for acquisition setup.\nChoose three to five scanning sites for analysis by moving the sample stage.\nSelect the elements (Ca and P) for detection. Start the detection and export the results.\n\t​NOTE: Ca and P are the most abundant elements in hydroxyapatite.\n7. Identifying functional gene expression\nOn Day 1, Day 7, Day 21, Day 28, and Day 35 of the culture, remove the culturing medium and wash the cell-gel matrix twice with ice-cold D-PBS in the plate.",
    "Transfer the gels with elbow-tipped forceps from the plate to a 2.0 mL tube (according to the culture time, the cell-gel matrix will gradually shrink to approximately 0.1 mL on Day 35). Make sure one gel is placed in one tube. Add 1 mL of phenol-chloroform and two sterile stainless-steel beating beads (4 mm, as a lysing matrix) into each tube. Place the tubes symmetrically into the prechilled sample slot of the mechanical beating homogenizer.\nSet the beating to a frequency of 55 Hz and an amplitude of 1 cm in each 1 min of mechanical beating with a 10 s pause, with six cycles in total. Start the bead-beating.\nExtract the total RNA from the cell-gel matrix using the phenol-chloroform-isoamylachohol method. Reverse-transcribe 2 µg of total RNA to cDNA with random hexamer primers.\nDesign primers targeting β-actin, Pdpn, Dmp1, Sost, and Fgf23 for real-time PCR (Table 2). β-Actin is the housekeeping gene used for normalization. The Pdpn10 and Dmp111 genes are mainly expressed in pre-osteocytes and mineralized osteocytes, whereas Sost12 and Fgf2313 are mainly expressed in mature osteocytes.\nPlace the tube on a thermocycler with the heated lid set to 105 °C and perform PCR amplification using the following PCR cycling settings: 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s for 35 cycles with an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min and a final extension step at 60 °C for 30 s. Analyze the fold changes with the ΔΔCt method.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
