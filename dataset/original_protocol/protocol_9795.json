    "1. Preparation of cell extract\nPreparation of media\n\t\nFor 2xYT media: Add 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl to 900 mL of deionized water and adjust the pH to 7.0 with 5 M NaOH. Raise the solution volume to 1 L using deionized water and autoclave or filter sterilize. Alternatively, purchase 2xYT media.\nFor S30B buffer: Prepare a solution of 14 mM Mg-glutamate, 60 mM K-glutamate, and 5 mM Tris in 2 L of deionized water. Use 2 M Tris to adjust the pH to 8.2, autoclave, and store at 4 °C. Complete the solution by adding dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 1 mM just before use.\nPreparation of cells\n\t\nStreak Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta2 cells or other cell line of choice (see Cole et al.44 for a recent comprehensive review) onto an LB (Lysogeny Broth) agar plate and incubate at 37 °C for 10-14 h.\nUse a single E. coli colony to inoculate 3 mL of 2xYT medium in a 10 mL culture tube. Incubate this tube at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 h.\nUse 50 µL from the 3 mL culture to inoculate 50 mL of 2xYT medium in a 500 mL flask. Incubate this flask at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 h.\nUse 7.5 mL from the 50 mL culture to inoculate each of four 4 L baffled flasks containing 0.75 L of 2xYT medium. Incubate these flasks at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm until they have reached an optical density at 600 nm of 2 to 4, after approximately 3-4 h.",
    "Harvest the cells from each flask by transferring them to 1 L containers and centrifuging at 5,000 x g for 12 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant by decanting into a waste container.\nWash each cell pellet with 150 mL of ice-cold S30B buffer by completely resuspending them using a pipette to disrupt the cell mass, and then collect the cells again by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 12 min. Discard the supernatant.\nWash each cell pellet again in 40 mL of ice-cold S30B buffer by completely resuspending them and disrupting the cell mass using a pipette. Transfer the cells to pre-weighed 50 mL conical tubes and collect the cells again by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 8 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant by decanting.\nWeigh the wet cell pellets. Flash-freeze the cell pellets by placing the tubes directly into liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\nCell lysis\n\t\nThaw the cell pellets on ice.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 1.4 mL of S30B buffer per 1 g of the cell pellet by vortexing.\nLyse the cells by French pressure cell at 640 psi at 4 °C. Collect the lysate in microcentrifuge tubes on ice and add 3 µL of 1 M DTT per 1 mL of lysate immediately after lysis.\n\t\tNOTE: It is best to tap the French press release valve with a small metal rod to maintain even pressure and avoid sudden drops in pressure.\nClear the lysate by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and discard the pellet after pipetting the supernatant to a new ice-cold microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to disrupt the pellet.",
    "Centrifuge the supernatant a second time at 30,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pipette the resulting supernatant into an ice-cold microcentrifuge tube. Discard the pellet.\nIncubate the supernatant in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h.\nClear the supernatant by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and transfer the resulting supernatant to an ice-cold microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to disrupt the pellet.\nCentrifuge the supernatant a second time at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and transfer the resulting supernatant to an ice-cold microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to disrupt any remaining pellet.\nDistribute the supernatant in 100 µL aliquots into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and flash freeze them by placing directly into liquid nitrogen. Store the supernatant at -80 °C.\n2. Linear template preparation\nPrimer design\n\t\nChoose a core sequence as the PCR template. Include at a minimum a reporter sequence, such as sfGFP (superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein), LacZ, or Spinach aptamer. Include other parts that will be fixed across screened variants, such as terminators, promoters or RBSs, as appropriate for the design.\n\t\tNOTE: Inclusion of a terminator is not always required for expression from linear DNA in cell-free systems.\nFor the forward primers, choose a minimum of 20 bp matching the 5ʹ end of the core sequence as the 3ʹ end of the primer. If adding parts to the 5′ end of the construct, design the remainder of the 5ʹ end of the primer to add the genetic parts of interest to the core sequence via PCR amplification (Figure 1A and Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: Since primers above ~60 bp frequently increase dramatically in cost, multiple overlapping primers can be designed to add longer sequences or multiple parts. While multiple primers can be used in a single PCR reaction, performing multiple rounds of PCR is recommended.\nFor the reverse primers, choose a minimum of 20 bp to match the 3′ end of the core sequence as the 3ʹ end of the primer. If adding parts to the 3′ end of the construct, design the remainder of the 5ʹ end of the primer to add the genetic parts of interest to the core sequence via PCR amplification (Figure 1A and Figure 2). Ensure that the reverse primer's annealing temperature is within 5 °C of the annealing temperature of the entire forward primer.\nLinear template amplification\n\t\nDetermine the number of PCR reactions to be performed based on the number of core sequences and calculate the amount of each component required using Table 1.\nPrepare the master mix according to Table 1 and store it on ice. Aliquot 30 or 40 µL (see Table 1) of the master mix into the determined number of PCR tubes and add 10 µL of each variable primer (i.e., primers encoding a part change, see Table 1) at 5 µM to appropriately labeled PCR tubes.\nPlace the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and run the following PCR program: 98 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, XX °C for 20 s, 72 °C for YY min; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Then, hold the reaction at 4 °C.",
    "Where, XX represents the annealing temperature for the primer with the lower annealing temperature and YY represents the extension time calculated for the length of the amplicon based on the manufacturer's recommendations for the high-fidelity polymerase used. Optimize these conditions as needed for different primers and/or templates.\n(Optional) Add 1 µL of DpnI restriction enzyme to digest the original template. Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h. Perform this step only if the original template is plasmid DNA.\nAnalyze 5 µL of each PCR product by gel electrophoresis. Separate the product using a 1% agarose gel at 180 V for 20 min. Check for the correct band size, which will vary with the chosen core sequence and the length of the parts added.\nPurify the linear template using a commercial PCR purification kit or by the preferred PCR cleanup method. If multiple bands were present by gel electrophoresis analysis, either optimize the PCR conditions or purify the correct molecular weight bands using a commercial gel extraction kit as per the manufacturer's recommendation.\nQuantify each DNA template using a spectrophotometer. Assess the DNA template quality by checking that the 260 nm/280 nm ratio is approximately 1.8.\n(Optional) Again separate a portion of the DNA template using a 1% agarose gel at 180 V for 20 min and ensure that any unwanted bands were removed during template purification.\nUse purified DNA templates immediately or store at -20 °C.\n3. Purified protein preparation\nProtein expression\n\t\nFor each protein to be expressed, assemble an appropriate expression construct. Codon-optimize the gene for expression in E. coli. Insert the gene into a pET-22b expression vector or other appropriate expression vector via the preferred plasmid assembly method. Transform the expression plasmid into BL21(DE3) Rosetta2 expression cells or other appropriate cell line.",
    "For each protein, use a single colony to inoculate 3 mL of LB medium in a 10 mL culture tube. Incubate these tubes at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm overnight.\nInoculate a 2 L flask containing 750 mL of LB medium with 1 mL of the overnight culture. Incubate these flasks at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until they reach an OD600 of 0.6-1.0.\nInduce protein expression by adding 0.75 mL of 1 M isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in water to each flask and continue to incubate these flasks at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 4 h.\nHarvest the cells from each flask, using a 1 L centrifuge bottle, by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 12 min. Discard the supernatant.\nTransfer the pellets to a 50 mL conical tube and weigh each pellet. Flash-freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C or proceed to step 3.2.\n\t\tNOTE: 2-5 g of cells per 0.75 mL are expected to result from this step.\nProtein purification by nickel affinity column chromatography\n\t\nPrepare the lysis buffer by combining 50 mM Tris-Cl, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. Adjust to pH 8.0.\nPrepare the wash buffer by combining 50 mM Tris-Cl, 500 mM NaCl, and 25 mM imidazole. Adjust to pH 8.0.\nPrepare the elution buffer by combining 50 mM Tris-Cl, 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. Adjust to pH 8.0.\nPrepare the dialysis buffer by combining 50 mM NaHPO4, 100 mM NaCl, and 2% DMSO. Adjust to pH 7.5.\nThaw the cell pellets by placing the tubes in room temperature water. Add 5 mL of the lysis buffer per 1 g of the cell pellet and resuspend by vortexing.",
    "Lyse the cells by sonication. Separate the cell homogenate so that there is no more than 30 mL per 50 mL conical tube and keep each tube on ice. Lyse the cells using a sonicator with a 0.16 cm diameter probe in 15 s rounds with 30 s breaks, 10 times.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid foaming, as this denatures the protein. The formation of foam can be avoided by keeping the sonicator tip at least 2/3 submerged in the lysate while it is operational. Other methods of cell lysis besides sonication are also possible44.\nClear the lysate by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and place the supernatant into a new 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 1 mL of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin for each 5 mL of supernatant. Divide the cell lysate/Ni-NTA slurry so that there is no more than 36 mL per 50 mL conical tube. Incubate at 4 °C on a tube rotator at 10 rpm for 1 h.\nLoad the resin by decanting the cell lysate/Ni-NTA slurry into a 2 mL bed volume chromatography column and collect the eluant if needed for further analysis, otherwise, discard. Wash the resin with 10 resin bed volumes of wash buffer.\nCollect the protein by adding three resin bed volumes of elution buffer to the column and concentrate the volume to 1.5 mL using a centrifugal concentrator with the appropriate molecular weight cut-off membrane for each protein.\nDialyze the protein against 2 L of dialysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. Dialyze the protein again against 2 L of dialysis buffer overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Quantify the protein using its molar extinction coefficient and absorbance at 280 nm. Analyze the protein for purity by separating it using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Store the protein at -80 °C.\n4. Cell-free protein synthesis\nPreparation of CFPS reaction mixture\n\t\nPrepare the Supplement Mix by following the Amino Acid Solution Preparation, Energy Solution Preparation, and Buffer Preparation steps in Sun et al.42. Store separately or combined at -80 °C in aliquots. Ensure that final concentrations match those described in Sun et al.42 in the Experimental Execution of a TX-TL Reaction section.\nPrepare an additive to protect linear DNA from degradation. If using GamS33,45, prepare via steps in section 3 above, or obtain from a commercial vendor; for other approaches, check the corresponding literature46,47,48. Alternatively, use a CFPS system that does not require additives49.\nPrepare T7 polymerase, repressor proteins, and other additives using the steps in section 3 above or obtain from a commercial vendor.\nDetermine the number of CFPS reactions to be performed and calculate the amount of each component required using Table 2. Modify the concentrations of the components, including adding or removing components as needed, and adjust the amount of water such that the final volume of each reaction mixture is always 10 µL. Similarly, modify the master mix to facilitate dispensing of other components by acoustic liquid handling as desired (see the Discussion section).\nThaw all the components on ice and prepare a master mix by mixing each component as calculated above. Mix all the components thoroughly by pipette. Pay careful attention to avoid precipitation, especially for the amino acid mixture. Keep the master mix on ice.\nChill a 384-well plate on ice and distribute the master mix in 9 µL aliquots into each well.",
    "NOTE: It is possible to distribute these components by acoustic liquid handling, though care should be taken to ensure proper dispensing (see the Discussion section for troubleshooting).\nDistribution of additional components by acoustic liquid handling\n\t\nCalculate the amount of repressor protein (and other optional components) required for all the CFPS reactions.\nThaw the repressor protein on ice and distribute it into an acoustic liquid handling source plate or other appropriate plate. Ensure that the appropriate amount of dead volume required for the type of source plate used is included.\nDistribute the repressor protein in 1 µL volumes into the appropriate wells via the liquid handler. For more information on distribution troubleshooting, see the Discussion section.\nStandard curves\n\t\nInclude a serial dilution of the purified reporter (see section 3 for protein purification)41 or appropriate chemical standard50 on the plate to enable comparison of results with other studies and other labs. Choose a range of concentrations appropriate for the reporter used and expected expression range of the experiments.\nRunning CFPS reactions\n\t\nPre-warm the plate reader to 30 °C. Set the plate reader to read at settings appropriate for the reporter used in the core sequence without shaking steps.\n\t\tNOTE: While 30 °C is used here, 29 °C and 37 °C are also commonly used and work well with this protocol. Other temperatures may be preferred for alternative cell-free reaction preparations. For read intervals, 10 min is sufficient to achieve a good resolution for the representative data presented here; however, other resolutions may be better depending on the reporter protein and the particular CFPS recipe.\n(Optional) Run a test reaction first to set the appropriate gain or sensitivity setting to capture the change in fluorescence without signal overflow.",
    "Seal the 384-well plate with an impermeable plastic sealable lid to prevent evaporation. If possible, on the instrument, set a 1 °C vertical temperature gradient to limit condensation on the seal. Place the 384-well plate on the plate holder and begin reading."
