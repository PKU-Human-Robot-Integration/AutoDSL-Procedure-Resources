    "All animal procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the West China School of Stomatology, Sichuan University. Adult C57BL/6 mice (female) were used for the present study.\n1. Surgical preparation\nGather the necessary surgical instruments for the procedure: germinator, ophthalmologic cautery, microsurgical scissors, microsurgical tweezers, syringes, and needles (26 g x  0.63 inch) (Figure 1A,B) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Prior to the surgical procedure, autoclave the surgical instruments, including the ophthalmologic cautery, microsurgical tweezers, and microsurgical scissors, at 102.9 kPa (1.05 kg/cm2) and 121 °C for 20 min.\nCollect the required surgical supplies: surgical drapes, latex gloves, sterile cotton, sterile sheets, sterile metal foil, foam board as the surgical platform, rubber bands (which can be obtained by tearing a medical latex glove), and tape (Figure 1C) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Use a separate set of supplies for each mouse, including syringes and sterile sheets for the surgical field.\nClean the surgical area and apparatus (light source, foam board, and temperature maintenance device, see Table of Materials) using alcohol wipes. Cover the knobs and handles of instruments that may be required during the procedure with sterile metal foil.\nAseptically open the individual instruments and carefully position them in the surgical area. Activate the germinator (see Table of Materials) and the lights for use during the procedure. Place the ophthalmologic cautery into the germinator and heat it to 250 °C for 20 min.\n2. Surgical procedure\nPerform fixation of the mouse and open the oral cavity following the steps below.\n\t\nSelect a female C57BL/6J mouse weighing 20-25 g and aged 8-12 weeks. House the mouse for 7 days before conducting any procedures.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of Zoletil50 (80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (5 mg/kg) (see Table of Materials). Apply ophthalmic eye ointment to the eye of the mouse. Wait until there is no toe-pinch response.\n\t\t​NOTE: The mouse is ready for the procedure when it is unable to turn over independently.\nSecure the mouse to a foam board lined with sterile sheets. Use tape to tie the mouse to the surgical platform in a supine position (Figure 2A).\nOpen the oral cavity of the mouse. Position two needles (26 g x  0.63 inch) in front of the orbital ear plane and two more behind it. Place a rubber band around the needles and cross the incisors to hold the mouth open. Use microsurgical tweezers to prop open the corners of the mouth (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the hard palate is clearly exposed. Fix the tongue under the rubber band to prevent obstruction of the field of view and burning during subsequent experiments.\nCreate the oronasal fistula (ONF) on the hard palate (Figure 3A-F).\n\t\nRetrieve the ophthalmologic cautery, which has been heated to 250 °C for 20 min. Place the cautery tip 1 mm away from the intersection of the midline of the palate and the line of the first premolar, creating a full-thickness mucosal injury to the hard palate in the midline.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid scalding the mouse's tongue.\nAfter a few seconds, remove the ophthalmologic cautery when the mucosa around the cautery tip turns white.\nPlace the ophthalmologic cautery in the germinator and continue heating it to 250 °C for 10 min. Repeat the previous step to enlarge the wound around the edges until it reaches a length of 2.0 mm and a width of 1.5 mm.",
    "NOTE: Each extension should follow the edge of the last injury. Use a vernier caliper to measure the length and width of the injury. The injury should cover 10% of the palate.\nUse microsurgical scissors to remove any excess denatured soft tissue around the wound. Use sterile cotton to stop bleeding and prevent inhalation asphyxiation of the mouse. Measure the wound to ensure it forms a full-thickness hard palate mucosal injury measuring 2.0 x 1.5 mm in the midline.\n3. Post-operative care\nAdminister Meloxicam to the mouse at the time of postoperative awakening, at a dose of 5 mg/kg/d for 3 days, subcutaneously29.\nPlace the mouse on a temperature maintenance device until it fully regains consciousness.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure that the mouse is positioned in a way that facilitates breathing. Rotate the mice every 10-15 min to prevent blood pooling or collapse of lung lobes. Once the mouse has warmed up, return it to its cage. Provide sterile jelly and irradiated feed at the bottom of the cage for the mice to consume.\n4. Verification of the oronasal fistula creation\nNOTE: The success of the oronasal fistula (ONF) creation is assessed on the 7th day following the surgical procedure.\nPrepare the necessary surgical supplies: rubber band, tape, syringes, surgical drapes, latex gloves, sterile sheets, sterile metal foil, and foam board.\nWear surgical drapes and sterile gloves to maintain aseptic conditions. Disinfect the foam board, light source, and temperature maintenance device with alcohol.\nInduce general anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of Zoletil50 (80 mg/kg). Wait until there is no toe-pinch response. Use the same method as described in step 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 to immobilize the mouse and expose the hard palate.\nPerform anatomical structural verification by ensuring that the septum is still visible at the wound site, indicating successful ONF creation (Figure 4A,B).",
    "Perform functional verification: close the oral cavity of the mouse and inject sterile water into its oral cavity using a sterile syringe. The successful creation of ONF is confirmed when fluid flows from the mouse's nostrils.\nPlace the mouse on the temperature maintenance device (37 °C) until it fully regains consciousness. Rotate the mice every 10-15 min to prevent blood pooling or collapse of lung lobes.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
