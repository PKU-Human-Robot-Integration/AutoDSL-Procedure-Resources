    "Sample preparationSample collectionThe entire protocol uses the L4 stage nematodes as the reference point. Follow the nematode culture and age-synchronization according to earlier reports (Solis and Petrascheck, 2015; Yu et al., 2017). Wash the L4 stage nematodes off each nematode growth medium plate (60 mm) with 1.6 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. After a 30-min settlement by gravity at 4 °C, carefully pipette out and discard the supernatants. Add 500 μl ice-cold PBS, resuspend the pellets with gentle and repetitive pipetting followed by a further 15-min settlement. Then, discard the supernatants, add 500 μl ice-cold PBS, resuspend the pellets with gentle and repetitive pipetting and obtain groups with 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 nematodes in 200 μl PBS in the centrifuge tubes using the following steps.Take the group with 100 nematodes as an example.Count the nematodes in 20 μl PBS under a microscope with three independent trials to estimate the nematode density in the whole tube. Based on the number of worms obtained, calculate and adjust the volume of PBS so that the final density is ~9 to 11 worms per 20 μl. For example, if the number is more than 10, add more PBS accordingly; and if the number is less than 10, perform a 10-min settlement and remove corresponding amount of PBS to achieve the desired density.Transfer 260 μl PBS with the nematodes into new 1.5 ml tubes with pipette, and resuspend the pellets with gentle and repetitive pipetting.Count nematode numbers in 20 μl PBS in three independent trials, with gentle and repetitive pipetting in between, to confirm the nematode density, leaving 200 μl in the tube. If the nematode density is not consistent with the setting, repeat step A1b.",
    "Prepare groups with other nematode numbers through the same way.Sample storageCentrifuge the tubes at 5,000 x g for 5 min (4 °C). Discard the supernatant PBS carefully with pipette and store the pellets at -26 °C overnight or -80 °C for over a week.Sample homogenizationConnect a clean pestle with the motor-driven tissue grinder. Wash the pestle in ice-cold PBS, and clean it with the absorbent paper. Push the pestle tightly against the pellets in the 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Keep the centrifuge tube in an ice bucket (see Figure 1). Start the tissue grinder, grind the pellets for 10 sec with a 2-sec cooling down followed by another 10-sec grinding. Then, use 200 μl ice-cold PBS to wash the residual liquids on the pestle back to the centrifuge tube (see Figure 1), before taking it out of the tube.Centrifuge the tubes at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pipette out 200 μl supernatants from each sample. Aliquot them into four tubes with 50 μl in each for subsequent determination.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815183135_3670.jpgFigure 1. Sample homogenization. The left picture shows that motor-driven tissue grinder homogenizes the pellets in the centrifuge tube in an ice bath, and the right one shows that residual liquids are washed off the pestle with 200 μl ice-cold PBS.Total protein assayMeasure the total protein (TP) in each sample by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits based on BCA methods.Preparation for protein standardsUse the stock protein standard (5 mg/ml) to prepare 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 mg/ml dilutions, 100 μl each using PBS.Preparation for BCA working solutionPrepare BCA working solution with BCA reagent A and B by a volume ratio of 50:1. Total volume of the BCA working solution is calculated according to the amount of tested samples (200 μl per sample).",
    "Determination of protein concentrationFor each protein standard, add 20 μl into a 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Use 20 μl PBS buffer as control.For each nematode sample, add 20 μl from one aliquot into the 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Use up this aliquot to ensure replicate and avoid repetitive freezing-unfreezing of the samples.Then, add 200 μl BCA working solution per well for all the protein standards and nematode samples. Seal the wells by sealing tape to avoid the evaporation of water, and incubate the plate for 30 min at 37 °C.Measure the absorbance at 562 nm (A562) using a microplate reader.Data calculationCalculate the protein contents in the samples according to the standard curve.One presentation of the relation between the nematode numbers and the protein concentrations is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815183327_1560.jpgFigure 2. The relationship between the nematode numbers and the nematode protein concentrationsSOD activity assayMeasure the SOD in each sample by ELISA kits based on WST-8 method. The WST-8 method is based on the colorimetric reaction of WST-8. In the reaction, xanthine oxidase (XO) catalyzes the oxidation conversion of xanthine to yield superoxide anion, which quenches WST-8 to produce water-soluble formazan (a purple dye). As SOD quenches superoxide anion, thus its activity inhibits the overall colorimetric reaction (see Figure 3). Therefore, the inhibition levels are used to indicate the SOD activities in cells, tissues or other biological samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815183542_7847.jpgFigure 3. The colorimetric reaction of WST-8 with the superoxide anion from xanthine, and the SOD activities inhibit the colorimetric reactionPreparation of necessary solutionPrepare the standards and controls, and working solutions according to the manufacturer’s instruction of the ELISA kit.Each sample needs 160 μl WST-8/enzyme working solution and 20 μl reaction initiation solution. Calculate the total amount according to the number of nematode samples plus standards.",
    "For WST-8/enzyme working solution, 160 μl consists of 151 μl SOD detection buffer, 8 μl WST-8 and 1 μl enzyme solution.Prepare the reaction initiation solution, by diluting from the original stock 1:40 in SOD detection buffer (i.e., 1 μl original solution to 39 μl buffer).Determination of samplesAdd 20 μl standards and controls into a 96-well plate with at least two replicates.Add 20 μl nematode samples into the 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Notably, each nematode sample is processed and divided into 4 aliquots after the step of sample homogenization. Use up one aliquot to ensure replicate and avoid repetitive freezing-unfreezing of the samples.Use a multi-channel pipette to add 160 μl WST-8/enzyme working solution into each sample, and then, add 20 μl reaction initiation working solution. The concentrations of standards are 100, 50, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 and 0.625 U/ml.There are two blank controls. For the blank control 1, 20 μl sample are replaced by SOD detection buffer. For the blank control 2, 20 μl sample and 20 μl reaction initiation solution are replaced by 40 μl SOD detection buffer.Incubate the plate for 30 min at 37 °C.Read the absorbance at 450 nm (A450) by a microplate reader.Calculation in SOD activity assayInhibition (%) = (ABlank control 1 - AStandard or Sample)/(ABlank control 1 - ABlank control 2) x 100%. Use the standards with known SOD activities and their inhibitions to establish a standard curve. Then, use the curve to calculate the SOD activities of samples by their inhibitions. One example for the standard curve is shown in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815184050_3003.jpgFigure 4.",
    "The relationship between SOD activities in logarithm and inhibition (%) on WST-8 colorimetric reactionExpress the SOD enzyme activity in each nematode sample as its proportion (P) in the total protein (TP) of the same sample to eliminate the differences of nematode numbers among samples. The normalized SOD activities in the nematodes are listed in Table 1. The proportion values generally range from 4.04 to 4.35. The values in groups with 20 and 50 nematodes are quite greater than the general range. Although these values are within mean value + 3 standard deviation (SD), we recommend not using them to avoid unreliability. These results indicate that at least 100 nematodes should be used to ensure the feasibility and stability in measuring SOD activities.Table 1. Connection between normalized SOD activities and nematode numbersimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815184213_8015.jpgCAT activity assayMeasure the CAT activities in each sample with ELISA kits. The assay principle is based on the reaction of catalase to decompose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The excess H2O2 can form complexation with ammonium molybdate to produce light yellow solution. The solution’s adsorption at 450 nm can be used to calculate the concentration of H2O2 and therefore to indirectly indicate the CAT activities.Reagents preparationAccording to the manufacturer’s instruction of the ELISA kit, prepare all reagents before the assay with careful calculation based on the numbers of samples, standards and controls.Addition of standards or samplesAdd 50 μl standards or samples into a 96-well plate. Use 50 μl PBS as blank controls. All standards, samples and controls are recommended to have at least two replicates. Notably, each nematode sample is processed and divided into 4 aliquots after the step of sample homogenization. Use up one aliquot to ensure replicate and avoid repetitive freezing-unfreezing of the samples. The concentrations of standards are 400, 100, 25, 6.25, 1.5625, 0.4 and 0.1 U/L.",
    "Enzyme conjugationAdd 100 μl of enzyme conjugate to wells containing standards, samples and blanks. Then, seal the wells by sealing tape to avoid the evaporation of water, and incubate the microplate statically for 60 min at 37 °C.WashDiscard the liquid content and tap the assay plate on a piece of absorbent paper to remove residual buffer.Add 350 μl wash solution (1x, which was diluted from the 40x package with PBS) to each well and keep the microplate static for 1 min. Then, discard the liquid content and tap the assay plate on a piece of absorbent paper to remove residual buffer.Repeat the above wash process for four times.Addition of substratesUse a multi-channel pipette to add 50 μl substrate A and 50 μl substrate B to each well. Incubate the microplate at 37 °C in the dark for 15 min.Endpoint measurementAdd 50 μl stop solution to each well. After 1 min incubation, measure the absorbance at 450 nm on a microplate reader within 15 min.Data calculation and presentationCalculate the total CAT activities of samples according to the standard curve (see Figure 5), the method of which is similar to that used by the SOD activity assay. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815184434_8184.jpgFigure 5. The relationship between total CAT activities in logarithm and inhibition (%) on colorimetric reaction between H2O2 and ammonium molybdateExpress the CAT activities in each nematode sample as its proportion (P) in the total protein (TP) of the same sample to eliminate the differences of nematode numbers among samples. The normalized CAT activities in the nematodes are listed in Table 2. The proportion values generally range from 8.74 to 10.36. The values in groups with 20 and 50 nematodes are significantly greater than this range.",
