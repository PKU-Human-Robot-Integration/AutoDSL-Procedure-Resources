    "1. Cell Line and Maintenance\nObtain β-TC6 cells (or other desired adherent mammalian cell line). In preparation for the study, culture, passage, and cryopreserve the cells according to provider instructions.\n2. Assemble the Continuous Feeding System\nNOTE: The continuous feeding system design in the method below was based on similar systems described in literature17–19,21,47–49. Assembly of the system used here is described in detail in a previous publication3.\nCollect the components needed for the feeding system which consists of five primary components: a medium reservoir, peristaltic pump, stirred bioreactor, waste reservoir, and custom designed tubing/sampling set.\n\t\nEstablish the medium reservoir using a 1 L glass bottle, the waste reservoir using a 2 L glass bottle, and the stirred bioreactor using a 250 ml volume glass reactor (off the shelf version).\nUse a digital peristaltic pump or similar pump with an 8 channel pump head to control medium exchange.\nManufacture the reservoir and modified bioreactor lids from hard and autoclavable plastic with stainless steel pipe pass-through ports to provide ventilation through sterile filters, and allow for medium transfer between reservoirs and bioreactors. Alternatively, purchase specialized lids with flow ports from various vendors.\n\t\tNOTE: The bioreactor lid may contain additional pass-through ports for optional instrumentation and monitoring probes (e.g., oxygen monitor).\nAttach an outflow tube (OT) fabricated from porous glass aeration tubes with an average pore size range of 40 µm to 60 µm, and a pore density of 40% to the modified SSB lid. Alternatively, choose another outflow tube based on the specific requirements of the culture.\n\t\tNOTE: Choose the OT pore size to remove only medium and cell debris, leaving cell aggregates in culture (as described in section 6 and publication3 for more details).",
    "Assemble autoclavable perfusion tubing sets from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) tubing connectors and durable peristaltic pump tubing. The length of the section is dependent on the distance between the different components.\n\tNOTE: Take special care when selecting tubing variety to ensure durability and reliability for long term experiments.\nAssemble the tubing set from three parts: a feed line, a waste line, and a sample line.\n\t\nAssemble the feed line using two tubing diameters (L/S 14 and L/S 13). Use the L/S 14 for the primary tubing that will span the distance from the bioreactor to the medium reservoir, and insert a short length of L/S 13 in the middle of the tubing length for the pump section using the appropriate PVDF adaptors.\nUse Standard PVDF hose-barbed tubing adaptors to join two pieces of L/S 14 tubing on either side of the shorter pump section (L/S 13) tubing.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the entire length of tubing could be smaller-diameter L/S 13 tubing, and the entire tubing length could be replaced when the pump-section integrity is in question.\nAssemble the second tubing section for waste removal using larger diameter (L/S 16) tubing and insert a short section of L/S 14 tubing in the middle for the pumping section. This is done in the same way as the feed line assembly using PVDF hose-barbed adaptors, or alternatively using a continuous length of the desired pump tubing size, and replacing as needed.",
    "NOTE: If the same pump and pump head are used for the feed circuit and the waste circuit, the pump section of the waste removal tubing lines must be a larger diameter than the pump section of the feeding line. This ensures that the removal pump rate is faster than the feed rate, and will avoid the potential for large changes in the culture volume, and reduce the risk of overflow.\nAssemble the final component of the tubing set: a sample collection assembly.\n\t\nThis procedure describes a custom assembled sampling port system; alternatively, a sterile sampling port may be purchased from various vendors.\nConstruct the set from three short (~ 6 cm) L/S 14 tubing lengths connected together with a T-type PVDF connector, and two small hose clamps on two of the tubing lengths.\nAttach a sterile gas filter for gas venting to one of the clamped lengths, and the other is used for connection to a sterile sampling syringe (sterile gas filters may need to be added in a bio-safety cabinet following sterilization as many sterile filters are not autoclavable).\nConnect the third end to a stainless steel sample connector attached on the lid of the bioreactor.\nAutoclave the sampling assembly while connected to the bioreactor prior to beginning the experiment (refer to step 3 below).\nUse this assembly to collect sterile samples from the bioreactor as needed without disturbing the continuous feed process.\n3. Autoclave All Materials\nPrepare all bioreactor components for autoclave sterilization.\nCollect individual components for sterilization. Medium and waste reservoirs (assembled from step 2.1.1), 250 ml spinner flask (assembled from 2.1.1), necessary modified lids (assembled from 2.1.3), outflow tube (described in 2.1.4), three tubing sets (assembled in sections 2.2 through2.5), outflow tube (as needed for continuous feeding).",
    "Assemble spinner flask with all components and be sure the outflow tube is firmly attached inside the spinner flask (described in section 2.1.4), and attach the custom assembled sampling port (section 2.5), or other sampling port to the top of the lid.\nWrap the entire spinner flask assembly with autoclave wrap material, and autoclave indicating tape. Be sure that the wrap airtight. NOTE: Aluminum foil or similar material can be used to cover the individual ends of each access port in the bioreactor lid to preserve sterility of the connector/ends when unwrapping and when non-connected to the tubing sets inside the incubator.\nAssemble the modified lids of the medium and waste reservoirs and then attach to the respective glass bottles. Cover them using aluminum foil and autoclave indicating tape.\nIndividually wrap the tubing sets (section 2.2 - 2.5) with autoclave wrap and tape to assist in final assembly. Aluminum foil or similar material can be used to wrap the individual ends of each tubing set to preserve sterility of the connector/ends when unwrapping.\nAutoclave all wrapped items using a standard dry autoclave cycle (e.g., “Gravity” setting with ~ 15 psi at 121 °C for 30 min or more).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not attach sterile filters prior to autoclaving unless they are confirmed to be autoclave safe.\n4. Spheroid Formation\nNOTE: This technique is similar to those described in the literature17–19,21,50–52 for other mammalian cell cultures. All procedures following sterilization should be done in a laminar flow hood and using sterile gloves to maintain sterile conditions for cell culture.\nFor all conditions, culture and expand β-TC6 cells in standard adherent cultures (described by vendor) until sufficient cell quantities are obtained to seed the desired number of bioreactors.",
    "Assemble the continuous feeding bioreactor with outflow tube as shown in Figure 1 and described in section 2, and connect sampling port to sampling lid. NOTE: The outflow tube and sampling port assembly should be added to the bioreactor for continuous feeding prior to spheroid formation, and should be pulled up out of the culture medium until continuous feeding is started.\nSterilize the modified SSB assembly by autoclave (described in section 3).\nAttach sterile vents (0.22 µm or smaller sterile filters) to the appropriate locations on the lids of the spinner flask, and medium and waste vessels.\n\t\tNOTE: This is important to prevent vapor lock, and to allow gas exchange between the incubator (5% CO2) environment and the bioreactor. The gas exchange is necessary to maintain the correct pH when using bicarbonate-buffered media.\nCollect the cells by gentle trypsinization using 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin- 0.53 mM EDTA solution, at room temperature aided by mechanical agitation for 2 - 3 min, and seed into bioreactors at a density of approximately 1.3 x 106 cells/ml in 200 ml culture medium.\n\t\nMove designated flasks out of the incubator and into a Bio-Safety cabinet.\n\t\tNOTE: All cell culture and manipulations should be done in a Bio-Safety cabinet using proper sterile technique.\nRemove culture medium from flasks by aspirating.\nWash cells by pipetting 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (without Ca++ or Mg++), into flask, and rinsing across the cells on the surface, and then aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 3 ml of Trypsin-EDTA solution to each flask that will be collected (typically about 10x 175 cm2 T-flasks).\nAllow harvested cells to incubate at room temperature for 2 - 3 min in bio-safety cabinet.",
    "Agitate gently by hand to loosen cells from flask surface, and collect cells by adding 6 ml of culture medium (with serum) to the flask, and transfer the cells to a 50 ml tube. When one 50 ml tube is full, use another 50 ml tube until all of the needed cells have been collected (approximately one 50 ml tube will be needed for every 5 T-175 flasks collected).\nGently centrifuge (approximately 50 x gravity) the collected cell suspensions to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the remaining medium leaving the pellet intact.\nCollect all of the cells in a single tube by re-suspending the pellets in culture medium (containing serum) using a pipette, and transferring all pellets into the same tube.\nCount the cell density using a standard hemocytometer with trypan blue staining as described in the literature53.\nAdd desired number of total cells to sterile SSB for each condition (1.3 x 106 cells/ml was the targeted starting cell densities for this demonstration).\nAdd medium (with the desired glucose concentration, in this case we used medium glucose levels within the physiological range) to SSB using a pipette to reach the desired total culture volume (200 ml culture volume was used for these studies).\n\t\tNOTE: For these continuous fed SSB studies the cultures were seeded using a modified “low-glucose” version of the culture medium (100 mg/dl). This allowed the cultures to start at the desired target glucose concentration rather than starting with a “high-glucose” medium and waiting for the glucose consumption to bring the glucose levels down into the physiological range to begin feeding. All other medium for feeding in these studies used the standard “high-glucose” medium (500 mg/dl).\nMove SSB with cells to a stir plate inside a cell culture incubator.",
    "Culture cells in the bioreactors without feeding for 3 days at 37 °C, with 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity, and a stir rate of 70 rpm to allow spheroids to form.\n\tNOTE: No significant proliferation should be observed during the three day spheroid formation period.\nAfter spheroid formation, divide spheroids among bioreactors with desired culture conditions.\n5. Continuous Feeding Culture and Adjusted Feed Rate\nAutoclave or gas sterilize all of the components, and assemble in a biological safety cabinet using sterile techniques (steps 2 - 4).\nAfter spheroid formation, remove the SSB from the incubator and assemble the components for the continuous feeding system in a biological safety cabinet.\n\t\nFirst fill the fresh medium reservoir with the desired culture medium, and then connect to one side of the feed line. Also ensure that the fresh medium reservoir is properly vented with a sterile filter.\nConnect one side of the feed line to the feed inlet port on the bioreactor in a sterile manner. A sterile filter should be installed between the feed line and the bioreactor inlet port to filter the medium before it enters the bioreactor.\nConnect the waste line to the bioreactor outflow tube and the medium waste reservoir, and ensure that the waste reservoir is properly vented with a sterile filter.\nMove the assembly out of the biological safety cabinet (this will probably require two people to carry all of the vessels and tubing), and put all components out for long-term culture.",
    "Put the SSB onto the stir plate inside of the incubator using the same culture parameters for spheroid formation (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% humidity and 70 rpm). NOTE: It may be necessary to temporarily disconnect the tubing segments from the bioreactor if the lines need to run through holes in the side of the incubator rather than out through the gasket in the door. This can be done in an aseptic way by wrapping the ends of the tubing sets with aluminum foil prior to autoclaving (step 3), and waiting to attach the bioreactor side of the feed and waste tube sections until the bioreactor is inside the incubator. The tube lines can be put in place, and the aluminum foil can be removed inside the incubator and quickly attached to the bioreactor.\nRun remaining ends of tubing sets (the ones not connected to the bioreactor lid) out through the incubator access port (pass-through), or through a notch in the incubator door gasket.\nOutside of the incubator (in a nearby biosafety cabinet if possible), quickly connect the feed line to the fresh medium reservoir, and the waste line to the medium waste reservoir, and ensure that the waste reservoir is properly vented with a sterile filter. NOTE: To do this in an aseptic manner, remove the aluminum foil from the tubing and vessel connectors and connect to the respective vessels as quickly as possible (especially if this connection needs to be done outside of the biosafety cabinet).",
    "Put fresh medium reservoir (filled with desired feed medium) inside nearby mini-refrigerator. Check to ensure that the feed and waste lines are able to exit the incubator and enter the refrigerator without preventing the doors on each from closing. It is also critical that the feed lines are not pinched closed by the doors of either the refrigerator or the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium used for these studies was the standard high glucose (500 mg/dl) culture medium recommended by the vendor for this cell type. Any high glucose medium could be used based on the specific needs of the cell type being cultured. The glucose concentration of the feed medium should be reasonably higher (2x or more) than the desired concentration in the culture as the feeding system relies on increasing the feed rate of high glucose medium to maintain adequate glucose levels in the cultures while maintaining reasonable feed rates.\nNext, the waste medium reservoir can be put on the bench top outside the incubator in a convenient location.\nNext, place the “pump section” of the feed and waste lines into the pump head ensuring the proper orientation so that the feed lines will pump medium from the fresh medium reservoir into the SSB, and the waste lines will pump medium from the SSB and to the waste medium reservoir.\nTurn the pump on to the desired feed rate.\n\t\nCalculate the feed rate using the adjusted feed rate equation described in the literature3 and in the provided representative results section below.\nUse the most recent cell count information (procedure described in step 5) along with the growth prediction, and the medium glucose measurements to estimate the feed rate needed to maintain the desired glucose concentration in the culture.",
    "NOTE: The cell growth rates and glucose consumption rates will need to be obtained prior to doing these procedures.\nSet the pump speed based on the calculated feed rate.\nRepeat the feed rate calculation and adjust the pump speed for each sampling point (every three days for the described method).\n6. Cell Counts, Viability, and Glucose Concentration Measurements\nCollect samples from each bioreactor every three days, or as desired.\nTake culture samples from continuously fed SSB cultures using the specialized sampling port described above.\n\t\nLeaving the continuously fed SSB inside the bioreactor, attach a sterile syringe (a 5 ml volume syringe was used for these studies) to un-filtered connection of the sampling port.\nMove the sampling tube down into the culture medium.\nUnclamp the tube section going to the syringe, and withdraw the desired total sample volume.\nMove the sampling tube up so that it is no longer submerged in the culture, and continue to withdraw the syringe until air is removed.\nClamp the tube that feeds the syringe, and detach the syringe containing the sample, and set aside.\nPre-load a second fresh sterile syringe with air, and attach to the sterile filter side of the sampling port.\nUnclamp the tube going to the syringe-filter side of the sampling port, and then purge the sampling port by gently expelling the air in the syringe through the sterile filter. This ensures that the sampling port will be clear of any residual medium.\nRe-clamp the tube going to the filter, disconnect the sterile syringe and discard it.\nTake the syringe that contains the cell sample from the culture, and expel it into a 10 ml tube. Sub-samples of known volumes may be taken directly from this tube.",
    "For cell counts, remove a known volume of cells and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube, and gently centrifuge for 1 - 2 min (approximately 50 x gravity).\nTransfer the supernatant to a separate tube for glucose measurements, and re-suspend the pellet with the same volume of trypsin-EDTA solution (0.25% (w/v) trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA), and count in triplicate using a standard hemocytometer with trypan blue staining as described in the literature53.\n\t\nAdd medium (with serum) to the sample for dilution as necessary.\nCount the cells, and calculate the cell viability by recording live (unstained) cells, and dead (stained) cells independently (viability % = live cells / total cells).\nMeasure medium glucose levels in triplicate using a blood glucose meter and single use test-strips.\n\t\nTake glucose measurements as described by the glucose meter instructions substituting the culture medium for blood.\nDip the test strip in the medium to be tested (collected from count samples above), and repeat for the desired number of replicates (three replicates are recommended).\nTest both the fresh medium and waste medium for glucose concentrations.\n\t\tNOTE: For some meters, measurements lower than 20 mg/dl (detectable threshold of the meter), may be observed as an error in the meter output.\n7. Spheroid Settling Rate Measurements\nTo ensure that cell clusters are not being removed by the continuous feeding system, measure the settling rate of β-TC6 spheroids by observing their sedimentation in a large diameter plastic pipette.\nCulture β-TC6 cells in SSB bioreactors to form spheroids as described above.\nAfter 3 days of culture, take 30 ml samples of the spheroid suspension and place in a 50 ml tube.",
    "Gently pipet up and down using a wide diameter 25 ml pipette to distribute evenly in suspension, then stop pipetting with the suspension at a known level in the pipet (e.g., 20 ml mark), and then record the time for all of the spheroids to settle 5 cm.\nRepeat this procedure enough times to attain statistical confidence (usually n > 3).\n\tNOTE: For biological studies, a p value less than 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant when comparing measurements. The standard error of the mean was used for reporting errors, and the two tailed un-paired student-t test was used to compare conditions for the presented data.\nSubscription Required.
