    "The first step in generating SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles involves transfecting third generation lentiviral vectors into HEK 293T cells. A fluorescent viral backbone is used to check infection between the steps microscopically. This protocol was adapted from a previous study (Crawford et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0004]). Other viral vectors, including new SARS-CoV-2 variants, can be used instead of the NR-52314 spike plasmid to study the disease effects during prenatal development.\nThis protocol is designed for a 75-cm2 flask, and it is advisable to use this the first time to become familiar with the protocol. It may be desirable in subsequent runs to scale up in order to produce more virus.\nMaterials\nHEK 293T cells, growing in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks (ATCC, cat. no.

    "1. Remove a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask of HEK 293T cells from the incubator and check their confluency with an inverted phase-contrast microscope. If the confluency is 80% to 90%, aspirate the HEK 293T culture medium from the flask.\n2. Add 2.5 ml of DPBS along the side of the flask and swirl gently.\n3. Remove the DPBS.\n4. Add 1.25 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and place the flask in the incubator for 3 min.\n5. Remove the flask from the incubator and gently tap it 3 to 4 times.\n6. Add 2.5 ml of HEK 293T culture medium and mix gently so the cells come off the flask.\n7. Transfer the cells to a sterile 15-ml conical tube.\n8. Centrifuge 3 min at about 335 × g, room temperature.\n9. Decant the supernatant gently, taking care that the pellet does not mix with the supernatant.\n10. Add 1 ml of medium slowly along the side of the tube and mix to break up the pellet.\n11. Mix 10 µl of this suspension with 90 µl of HEK 293T culture medium in a separate tube.\nThe standard 10-fold dilution is used for this confluency.\n12. Take 10 µl of this suspension and pipet it onto both grids of a clean hemocytometer.\nThis video by Ricardo & Phelan (2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0017]) provides the general steps for using a hemocytometer:\nhttps://www.jove.com/v/752/counting-and-determining-the-viability-of-cultured-cells[href=https://www.jove.com/v/752/counting-and-determining-the-viability-of-cultured-cells]\n13. Count the number of cells in the four quadrants of each grid using a microscope, taking care to count only the live cells which appear round, versus dead cells which are shriveled.\n0.4% trypan blue can be used to stain dead cells before placing them on the hemocytometer. This should be done using a sub-sample of the suspension.",
    "14. Calculate the average of live cell counts from the four quadrants and obtain the cell concentration in the original suspension using the following formula:\n         \ncells/ml = average count × dilution factor (10-fold) × 10,000\n10,000 is multiplied to convert 100 nl (volume in each quadrant) to ml.\n15. Determine the volume of the cell suspension needed to plate 7 × 106 cells in a 75-cm2 culture flask.\n         \nVolume to add to flask (ml) = 7 × 106 ÷ cell concentration from step 14\n16. Add 14 ml of HEK 293T culture medium to a 75-cm2 flask and transfer the calculated volume of cell suspension to the flask.\n17.

When the confluency is about 70%, aspirate the culture medium from the flask.\n21. Add 15 ml of culture medium without penicillin-streptomycin.\n22.

    "The viral pseudoparticles are secreted into the HEK 293T conditioned medium. Since HEK 293T medium is not compatible with the H9 hESC culture, pseudoparticles must be concentrated using polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and resuspended in a suitable medium. This method also allows for the long-term storage of pseudoparticles at −80°C.

    "Cells can be quickly examined via microscopy to verify that transduction has occurred. This protocol then uses flow cytometry to quantify green fluorescence from the viral backbone, which is an indicator of viral transduction efficiency. Pseudoparticle transduction efficiency is checked by test-infecting HEK 293T-ACE2 cells. HEK 293T-ACE2 cells are engineered to express the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Pseudoparticle transduction efficacy is determined by adding different amounts of pseudoparticles to HEK 293T-ACE2 cells and quantifying the percent that are infected using flow cytometry to determine the relative number of cells expressing green fluorescence. The gating strategy is also described to extrapolate transduction efficiency information. Poisson's formula is used to obtain the MOI of the viral pseudoparticle batch (Crawford et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0004]).\nIf studying a different virus, the cell line needs to express the receptor for that virus, which may not be ACE2.

    "The H9 infection assay (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-prot-0005]) is based on plating 24,000 cells/well in a 48-well plate. This cell number was chosen as the appropriate plating density for H9 hESCs after testing at different MOIs. This protocol involves seeding H9 hESCs using ROCKi to improve single-cell survival (Ohgushi et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0014]; Watanabe et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0020]; Weng et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0022]). Many downstream applications, such as direct differentiation, require accurate counting and plating of single hESCs.\nThe pseudoparticle infection assay may be used for numerous applications. This protocol uses drug screening as an example. The test drug, Dyngo4a, targets one of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry pathways; therefore, this treatment requires preincubation of the hESCs with Dyngo4a.

Remove Matrigel from the culture vessel and add mTeSR plus culture medium.\nAdd 1.5 ml per well of a 6-well plate.\nCulturing of H9 hESCs (modified from Lin and Talbot, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0008] and Behar et al. 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-bib-0002].)\n3. Remove a 6-well plate of H9 hESCs from the incubator and check its confluency with an inverted phase-contrast microscope. If the confluency is 60% to 70%, aspirate the mTeSR plus culture medium from the well.\n4. Add 1 ml of DPBS dropwise along the wall of the well gently.\n5. Remove the DPBS.\n6. Add 1 ml of ReLeSR and swirl gently.\nLights should be turned off as ReLeSR is light sensitive.\n7. Remove the ReLeSR and place the plate in the incubator for 4 min.\n8. Remove the plate from the incubator and add 1 ml of mTeSR plus medium dropwise along the wall of the well gently.\nFor clump-passaging, ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 dihydrochloride should not be used.\n9. Gently tap the plate 3 to 4 times.\nUndifferentiated cells will lift off of the plate during this step.\n10. Transfer the undifferentiated cells into a sterile 15-ml conical tube.\n11. Triturate the cells gently, twice with a 1000-μl pipette\nThis step should be performed gently to generate cell clumps, not single cells.\n12. Add 100 μl of cells (1:10 dilution) to each well of the 6-well plate prepared in step 2.\nAdd dropwise over the surface of the culture medium.\n13. Place the plate in the incubator overnight.",
    "14. Check the following day and perform a medium change (2 ml of mTeSR plus medium).\n15. Culture medium should be changed every other day.\nFigure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-fig-0003], D shows an example of a healthy H9 hESC colony.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c1cb0756-80a3-44e3-bb88-0c15ec899289/cpz1759-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nhESC pseudoparticle infection. (A-F) Representative micrographs of H9 hESC colonies during passaging and maintenance. (A, D) A healthy hESC colony showing relatively smooth edges with small tightly packed cells. (B, E) An example of an unhealthy colony with spiky edges, larger cells, and spaces between adjacent cells. Arrows indicate spaces between cells. (C, F) An unhealthy hESC colony with elongated morphology and loose/dying cells. Arrows indicate elongated cells on the edge of the colony which appear to have differentiated. (A-C) Scale bar = 100 µm. (D-F) Scale bar = 10 µm. (G) hESC pseudoparticle infection plate design with infection inhibitor. The “Virus -” controls are used to assess autofluorescence in the “No treatment” and Dyngo4a treatment groups. The virus +/no treatment group is used to assess the level of infection, while the Dyngo4a treatment group measures the effect of the inhibitor on infection. Multiple treatment groups can be added with respective “Virus ±” controls. (H-K) Sample data obtained using the plate design in Figure 3G. Transduction efficiency is obtained by subtracting autofluorescence (Virus - controls: H, J) from the respective treatment groups (I, K) (I-H; K-J). (L, M) Graphs of transduction efficiency and relative infection. Relative infection is obtained by setting the “no treatment” control to 100 and comparing treatment groups to the control.\nProcedure for ROCK inhibitor treatment\n16. Once two wells in a 6-well plate are 60% to 70% confluent, remove mTeSR plus medium from the wells with a 1000-μl pipette.\n17. Wash each well with 1 ml of DPBS.",
    "18. Add 1 ml of gentle cell dissociation reagent to each well and incubate for 8 min at 37°C.\n19. Add 1 ml of mTeSR plus medium to neutralize gentle cell dissociation reagent.\n20. Harvest cells by pipetting up and down with a 1000-μl pipette to ensure a single-cell suspension and transfer cells to a 15-ml conical tube. Rinse wells with an additional 1 ml of DMEM medium and add the rinse to the tube containing the cells.\n21. Centrifuge cells at 335 × g for 3 min, room temperature. During the centrifugation, prepare medium with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\nAdd ROCK inhibitor to mTeSR plus medium, making a 1:500 dilution from the 5 mM ROCK inhibitor stock.\n22. Resuspend cells in 1 ml of mTeSR plus medium with ROCK inhibitor.\n23. Count cells as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-prot-0001] to determine the cell concentration.\n24. Calculate to find the dilution factor necessary to plate 24,000 cells/well in each well of a 48-well plate.\n25. In addition to the wells plated for screening drugs, plate additional control wells with cells to eliminate autofluorescence. These wells should not be infected with pseudoparticles (refer to the plate design in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-fig-0003]G).\n26. Place plate in the incubator for 24 hr to allow cells to attach.\nExample of an application: Drug treatment and infection\nSteps 27-28 may be skipped if drug testing is not a downstream application of interest. Instead, proper controls must be designed accordingly. For instance, if testing transduction efficiency in different cell lines, then two wells (+/- virus) such as in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-fig-0003]G should be plated instead of drug treatment wells (see Critical Parameters).\n27. Prepare drug(s) to be tested in mTeSR plus medium.",
    "Some drugs may need to be reconstituted in a different solvent such as DMSO, ethanol, or methanol. Serial dilution with mTeSR can be performed to reach the final working concentration.\n28. Gently remove the culture medium and add 250 µl of the test drug(s) diluted in mTeSR plus medium. Preincubate cells in the drug for 2 hr.\n29. Obtain frozen aliquots of viral pseudoparticles from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-prot-0003].\n30. Add virus to each well. H9 cells typically yield ∼10% transduction efficiency with a MOI of 0.5.\n         \nvolume of pseudoparticles (ml) = [Number of cells seeded × -Ln {1 - (transduction efficiency ÷ 100)}] ÷ (PFU/ml)\nIf using the same batch, refer to Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.759#cpz1759-prot-0004] step 26 for PFU/ml:\n{24,000 × -Ln (1 – 0.5)} ÷ 4,792,861 = 0.003471 ml or 3.471 µl\n31. Incubate the plate for 24 hr in the incubator.\n32. Gently remove the medium and add 250 µl of the drug(s) diluted in mTeSR plus medium.\n33. Incubate the plate for 24 hr in the incubator.
