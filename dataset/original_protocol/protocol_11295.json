    "This human study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC, Guangzhou, China). The animal study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. Note: all experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines, including the Guideline for occupational exposure protection against blood-borne pathogens.\n1. Sample preparation\nObtain gastric cancer tissues (P0 = passage 0) directly from the operation. The tumor specimen should be larger than 0.5 cm3.\nPrepare 3-4 mL of stock solution: for example, RPMI-1640 medium (1x) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin.\nPut the fresh tumor specimen in the stock-solution at 4 °C for no more than 4 hours.\n2. Establishment of PDX model (Figure 1)\nTo ensure a sterile surgical area, disinfect all materials with ultraviolet light for more than 30 min before transfer into the animal laboratory.\n\tNote: the operation room need to be disinfected with ultraviolet light for  30 min, before we clean the desk with dichloro isocyanuric acid sodium suppositoria disinfectant. Then povidone-iodine is used to disinfect the skin.\nUsing forceps and scissors, carefully dissect the tumor tissues and trim them into several small pieces (approximately 1 mm3 cubes) under sterile conditions.\nAnesthetize female 5- to 7-week-old NOD-SCID-IL2rg (NSG) mice by exposure to 1-1.5% isoflurane with an anesthesia machine.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse until it stops struggling but maintains even breathing.\n\t\tNOTE: The 50 mL tube is a simple equipment that functions similar to an anesthesia machine. The use of veterinary eye ointment to prevent dryness is unnecessary due to the short operation time.\nMake a 1 cm incision on both dorsal flanks using sterile scissors, and implant one tumor piece into each flank of the mouse.",
    "To ensure that the tumor piece does not slip out, use sterile forceps to disrupt the subcutaneous tissue. Then, clip a piece of the tumor tissue, and place it into the deep site.\nClose the implant area by subcutaneous suture with surgical suture needles, and mark the mouse ears with labeled ear tags\nSterilize the wound with iodine.\nGently place the mice in an empty cage after surgery while maintaining sternal recumbency. Pay close attention to the condition of the mice; they wake up and begin to walk approximately 3-4 min later. Place mice that underwent surgery in another new cage separated from those not subjected to surgery.\nAssess tumor size by palpation of the implantation site. Measure the tumors with a Vernier caliper twice a week.\nOnce the tumor reaches 10 mm in diameter, the animal condition worsens, or the tumor ulcerates, euthanize the mouse with an IRB approved method. Reimplant harvested fresh tumor fragments into 2 new mice for passaging, or temporarily store the specimens in PBS on ice for the isolation of primary cell lines.\n3. Tissue cryopreservation\nNOTE: This part primarily references the methods for the Live Tissue Kit Cryo Kit. The main kits and equipment are listed in the Table of Materials.\nEuthanize the mice with an IRB approved method when the tumor is greater than 10 mm in diameter.\nUsing sterile forceps and scissors, slowly isolate the tumor from the mice.\nWash the tumor tissues with DPBS in a 10 cm dish. Dissect and remove necrotic areas, fatty tissue, blood clots and connective tissue with forceps and scissors.\nCut the tumor tissues to a maximum 1 mm thickness with a mold.\nWash the slices with DPBS in a 10 cm dish.",
    "NOTE: The vitrification process involves the use of tubes labeled V1/V2/V3 in steps 3.6-3.8. The main ingredients are DMSO and sucrose.\nTransfer the slices into tube V1 with forceps, and incubate the tube at 4 °C for 4 min. Roll and invert the tube briefly, and place it at 4 °C for another 4 min.\nPour the V1 solution and slices into a 10 cm dish. Transfer the slices into tube V2 with forceps, and incubate tube V2 at 4 °C for 4 min. Roll and invert the tube briefly, and place it at 4 °C for another 4 min.\nPour the V2 solution and slices into a 10 cm dish. Transfer the slices into tube V3 with forceps, and incubate the tube at 4 °C for 5 min. Roll and invert the tube briefly, and place it at 4 °C for at least 5 min. Make sure the slices all sink to the bottom of the tube.\n\t\nIf several slices remain floating, roll and invert the tube briefly, and place the tube at 4 °C again until all slices sink completely; if necessary, discard the floating slices.\nPour the V3 solution and slices into a 10 cm dish.\nCut the tissue holders to the proper length, and place them on sterile gauze. Transfer the slices onto the holders. Wrap the holders with the gauze, and place them in liquid nitrogen using forceps, followed by incubation for 5 min.\nLabel the cryogenic vials with the tissue information.\nTransfer the holders with tissue slices into cryogenic vials, which are stored in liquid nitrogen.\n4. Isolation of primary cells (Figure 2)\nSterilize forceps and scissors with high pressure steam at 121 °C for 30 min.",
    "Resect gastric cancer samples from resected specimens or harvested PDX tissues. Place the tissues on ice, and then, transfer the tissues to a 10 cm sterile culture dish.\nDissect and remove necrotic areas, fatty tissue, blood clots and connective tissue with forceps and scissors.\nWash the tumor tissues once with DPBS containing 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin in a 10 cm dish.\nCut the tumor tissue into 1 mm3 pieces on the lid of the dish; the maximum thickness of each piece should be 1 mm.\nTransfer the tissues into a 50 mL centrifuge tube with approximately 7 mL of type 1 collagenase and trypsin (1:14) solution. Vortex the mixture briefly.\nIncubate the tube in a water bath at 37 °C for 30-40 min. Vortex the mixture every 5 min.\nAdd an equal volume of RPMI-1640 medium (1x) supplemented with 10% FBS to the tube. Vortex the mixture thoroughly.\nTransfer the mixture into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube by slow filtration through a 40 μm filter.\n\tNOTE: Use 40 μm filters to ensure a higher ratio of cancer cells. If necessary, 100 μm filters can be used to preserve more types of cells, such as immunological cells.\nCentrifuge the filtrates at 113-163 x g for 5-7 min at RT. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 5 mL of PBS, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nIf the pellet is red, it contains many erythrocytes. Gently resuspend the pellet with 500 μL of red blood cell lysis buffer. After a 5 min incubation, add 5 mL of PBS, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with culture medium, and transfer the mixture to a sterile 10 cm dish.\nReplace the medium with serum-containing medium every 2-3 days.",
