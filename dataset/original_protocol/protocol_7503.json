    "All sample preparation is performed under sterile conditions. Centrifugation steps are at either 528× g for 5 min (5 acc/1 dec) (A3–B1) or 528× g for 90 s (9 acc/9 dec) for 96-well plates. Slow deceleration is used when centrifugation is performed in Falcon tubes to reduce the disturbance of the infected RBCs pellet.Prepare malaria parasite cell culture Maintain parasite-infected RBC culture at 5% hematocrit (percentage by volume of RBCs in culture) with O+ RBCs in CCM at 37 °C in a low oxygen environment (malaria mix). As an example, a 35 mm × 10 mm tissue culture dish would contain 250 μL of RBCs and 4.75 mL of CCM, yielding a 5% hematocrit culture. O+ RBCs are used as they are compatible with pooled sera from any blood type, avoiding RBC agglutination.Parasitemia (the percentage of infected RBCs relative to total RBCs) should be kept at ≤ 5% and the CCM replaced every 24–48 h. Monitor the parasitemia via thin blood smears and Giemsa staining.Thin blood smears and Giemsa staining: Deposit 1–2 μL of RBCs at one end of a glass microscope slide. Use another glass slide held at a 45° angle to smear the cells across the first slide. Allow to air dry; then, fix the cells by immersing the slide in methanol for at least 5 s. Allow the slide to air dry and incubate the fixed slide in 10% Giemsa stain diluted in water for 5 min. Remove the slide from the stain and wash off excess stain with tap water. Blot the slide dry with paper towels; then, add immersion oil and visualize the cells with a 100× objective on a light microscope. Cell fixation and staining can be done in a non-sterile environment. Parasites will be stained dark purple and RBCs light purple.",
    "Use a physical cell counter to count ≥500 cells to determine the parasitemia, or percentage of cells infected with a parasite, prior to an experiment.Synchronize parasite cultures using the osmolyte D-sorbitol. Parasite-infected RBCs from 20 h post invasion (hpi) are susceptible to hypotonic lysis when incubated in a 5% solution of D-Sorbitol (Ginsburg et al., 1983; Counihan et al., 2017). This physiology is leveraged to synchronize cultures, as ring-stage parasites survive sorbitol treatment.Harvest the culture by centrifugation at 528× g for 5 min (5 acc/1 dec), aspirate the media, and resuspend the pellet in 5% D-sorbitol (w/v) to obtain a 5% hematocrit solution (the original volume of the culture). Incubate the D-sorbitol-treated culture in a water bath at 37 °C for 5–10 min. Harvest the sorbitol-treated culture, aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in CCM to 5% hematocrit, and return the culture to a fresh culturing dish or flask. One sorbitol synchronization will retain parasites that are ~0–20 hpi. Sorbitol-synchronize the parasites again 8 h later to narrow the age range to ~8–20 hpi. For the protocol outlined here, parasites must be synchronized to ~20–32 hpi (i.e., two synchronizations, 12 h apart).Transgenic parasites are maintained in the presence of selection reagent. To generate transgenic parasite cell lines, follow the detailed protocols and recipes outlined in Rug and Maier (2013). Our transgenic parasite cell lines were generated in a CS2 background, an isolate expressing the EMP1 variant VAR2CSA (Duffy et al., 2006). It is recommended to use the parent cell line as a positive control, as we do in this protocol.",
    "CS2 is a clonal parasite line that expresses var2csa as a dominant var gene transcript, allowing us to use an antibody for the encoded antigen (the EMP1 variant var2csa) to assess antigen trafficking to the host cell surface (Elliott et al., 2005; Duffy et al., 2006).Dilute and aliquot cells The infected RBC culture should be at 5% hematocrit with a parasitemia between 3% and 5%. Harvest mid-trophozoite stage cultures (~20–32 hpi) by centrifugation at 528× g for 5 min (5 acc/1 dec).Aspirate the spent media leaving the RBC pellet undisturbed. Resuspend the RBCs in 1% BSA/PBS and dilute as required to obtain a solution containing a 3%–5% parasitemia and 2%–4% hematocrit.Load 20 μL of diluted cells into a 96-well plate in duplicate or triplicate per condition and cell line. At a minimum, you will require a no-primary control (wells incubated with the BSA diluent and that receive the second and third antibody treatments), totalling ≥ 6 wells per cell line if performed in triplicate.Add 100 μL of wash buffer (1% BSA/PBS) to each well. Alternatively, add 100 µL of wash buffer prior to loading cells in step B3. We recommend a multichannel pipette for all subsequent washing steps.Centrifuge the plate at 528× g for 90 s (9 acc/9 dec) to pellet the cells, then aspirate the media using an aspirating tip. We find that the accuracy of aspiration is improved when a sterile pipette tip (no filter) is mounted on the end of the aspirator tip. Touch the tip to the wall of each well to aspirate the supernatant.Cell staining Note: All antisera are diluted in wash buffer (1% BSA/PBS). Resuspend each well with 10 μL of either rabbit polyclonal anti-VAR2CSA antibody (1:100) or 1% BSA/PBS as a control and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.",
    "Add 100 μL of wash buffer (1% BSA/PBS), centrifuge the plate, and aspirate the supernatants. Resuspend each well in 100 μL of wash buffer (1% BSA/PBS), centrifuge the plate, and aspirate the supernatants.Resuspend each well with 10 μL of mouse anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Repeat steps C2 and C3 (wash steps).Resuspend each well with 10–20 μL of goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to a fluorophore (1:100) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.For cell lines expressing GFP, we use Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Hoechst 33342 DNA stain.For cell lines not expressing GFP, we use Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Hoechst 33342 or SYTO-61 nucleic acid stain.Repeat steps C2 and C3.Incubate the cells in the DNA or nucleic acid stain.For Hoechst 33342 staining, add 20 μL of stain (1:2,000) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Wash cells twice (step C5), then wash the cells once in 100 μL of PBS alone. After this final wash, resuspend the cells in 200 μL of PBS (0.2%–0.4% hematocrit final), and then proceed with flow cytometry measurements. We use low hematocrit for these experiments to reduce the likelihood of capillary blockage during flow cytometry.For SYTO-61 staining, incubate cells in 20 μL of SYTO-61 (5 μM in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature (Klonis et al., 2011). Add 180 μL of PBS to dilute the wells to 0.02% hematocrit and incubate the cells for 30 min at room temperature before being measured.Flow cytometry using FACSDiva software The steps below refer to a non-GFP-expressing cell line, labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 tertiary antibody and Hoechst 33342. Perform these steps for one well containing a double-stained positive sample (or well), e.g.",
    ", the positive control, then apply the gating strategy to all wells in the plate.Use a side scatter height (SSC-H) vs. forward scatter area (FSC-A) plot to identify and gate the total RBC population (Figure 2A). Select this population.Then, use a forward scatter height (FSC-H) vs. forward scatter width (FSC-W) plot to gate singlet events (Figure 2B). Select this population.Plot Pacific blue height (DNA stain) vs. FITC height (fluorophore-conjugated tertiary antibody) (Figure 2C). Adjust the voltage of Pacific blue and FITC so that the Pacific blue-H +/- and FITC-H +/- populations can be clearly delineated. In our example plot (Figure 2C), the quadrant divide sits at approximately 103. Once the voltages are optimized, apply these acquisition paraments to all wells in the plate and all biological repeats. As visualized in Figure 1, the Q4 population represents uninfected RBCs, the Q1 population is infected but does not have labeled EMP1 on the surface, and the Q2 population is both infected and presenting EMP1 on the surface.Note: If there is a substantial number of high-FITC events to the right of the main Q2 population, these are likely non-specific events. Consider increasing the volume of wash buffer during the wash steps or the number of washes after the final antisera incubation. Alternatively, use the secondary-only antibody controls as a guide for drawing a right boundary on the FITC+ populations. Update the high throughput sampler (HTS) loader settings (Table 1).Table 1.
