    "All animal experimental protocols were approved by the animal ethics committee of Jichi Medical University and performed in accordance with Use and Care of Experimental Animals guidelines from the Jichi Medical University Guide for Laboratory Animals. Here, we demonstrated miRNA mimic delivery to the kidney resulting in its overexpression using UUO mice. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jichi Medical University [Approval Nos. 19-12 for renal fibrosis, 17-024 for acute kidney infection (AKI), and 19-11 for diabetic nephropathy].\n1. Preparation of PEI-NPs-miRNA-mimic complex\nNOTE: Here, preparation of PEI-NPs-miRNA-mimic13,14,15 and PEI-NPs-control-miRNA (as a negative control) are described for one mouse.\nPrepare the following items:\n\t\nPrepare 10 µL of linear PEI-NPs.\nPrepare 50 µL of artificially synthesized miRNAs dissolved in nuclease-free water at a concentration of 100 µM (5 nmol miRNA dissolved in 50 µL of nuclease-free water).\nPrepare 50 µL of artificially synthesized control (non-target) miRNAs dissolved in nuclease-free water at a concentration of 100 µM (5 nmol miRNA dissolved in 50 µL of nuclease-free water).\nPrepare 5% and 10% glucose solutions. Ensure the availability of 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and a vortex mixer.\nDissolve 10 µL of PEI-NPs in 90 µL of 5% glucose solution in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Then, vortex the tube gently and spin down.\nMix 50 µL of artificially synthesized miRNAs (5 nmol) dissolved in nuclease-free water (100 µM concentration) with 50 µM of 10% glucose solution in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Then, vortex the tube gently and spin down. This process yields miRNA dissolved in 5% glucose solution.\nMix 100 µL of PEI-NPs in 5% glucose solution and 100 µL of miRNA mimic (5 nmol) in 5% glucose solution. Then, vortex the tube gently and spin down.",
    "Incubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature (RT) to prepare a stable complex of PEI-NPs-miRNA-mimic. This solution contains PEI-NPs and miRNA mimic (5 nmol) at a ratio of nitrogens (N) in the polymer to phosphate (P) in nucleic acids (N/P ratio) = 6 (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: PEI-NPs-control-miRNA complex can be prepared using the same process described in steps 1.1-1.5 for all kidney disease mice models described in this manuscript (UUO, diabetic nephropathy, and AKI). One injection volume of PEI-NP-miRNAs-mimic is the same as 5 nmol of miRNAs-mimic conjugated with PEI-NPs at N/P ratio = 6. The injection duration and frequency of each PEI-NP-miRNAs-mimic depends on the disease model in which it is applied.\n2. Confirmation of significant delivery of miRNA mimic to the kidney in UUO mice by PEI-NP via tail vein injection using fluorescent microscopy\nNOTE: Here, the delivery method of artificially purified miRNA mimic to the kidney is elaborated, indicating the establishment of therapeutic methods for various renal diseases. In brief, UUO mice were administered cyanine3 carboxylic acid (Cy3)-labeled miRNA mimic added to 100 µL of PEI-NPs via the tail vein. The delivery to the kidneys was confirmed with fluorescence microscopy. PEI-NPs-cyanine3 carboxylic acid (Cy3)-labeled miRNA mimic (oligonucleotides) for one mouse is described. This method can significantly deliver miRNA mimic to the kidney in several mouse models, such as UUO mice, diabetic kidney disease mice, and AKI mice produced by IRI. Here, we used a UUO mouse model for the video demonstration. The induction method of UUO was described previously elsewhere13. Follow these protocols within six days after UUO surgery.\nPrepare the following items:\n\t\nPrepare 2 µL of PEI-NPs and 100 µL of Cy3-labeled double-strand oligonucleotides [Cy3-labeled miRNA mimic (1 nmol; 10 µM)].",
    "Prepare 5% and 10% glucose solutions. Ensure the availability of 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and a vortex mixer.\nUse a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a small hole in the cap to isolate the tail veins of UUO mice.\nFor fluorescence microscopy, prepare optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, a cryostat, liquid nitrogen, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1.0 mL syringes with a 27 G needle, and silane-coated glass.\n\t\tNOTE: Fluorescein-labeled Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (a proximal tubule marker) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) may be prepared for optional staining of proximal tubules and cell nuclei.\nDissolve 2 µL of PEI-NPs in 98 µL of 10% glucose solution in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Then, vortex the tube gently and spin down.\nAdd 100 µL of Cy3-labeled miRNA mimic to 100 µL of PEI-NPs in 10% glucose solution (prepared in step 2.2). Then, vortex the tube gently and spin down.\nIncubate the mixture for 15 min at RT to prepare a stable complex of PEI-NPs-Cy3-labeled-miRNA-mimic.\nPlace the UUO mouse headfirst in a 50 mL centrifuge tube without anesthesia, and then place the tail through the prepared hole in the cap.\nFill a 1.0 mL syringe with a 27 G needle with 200 µL of PEI-NPs-Cy3-miRNA-mimic complex.\nInject PEI-NPs-Cy3-miRNA-mimic (200 µL) via the tail vein of the mouse using the 1.0 mL syringe with 27 G needle.\n\tNOTE: Wipe the tail vein with cotton wool saturated in ethanol (70%-80%) to dilate the tail vein and disinfect the injection area.\nOne hour after 200 µL of PEI-NPs-Cy3-miRNA-mimic complex injection, anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (4%-5%) using an appropriate anesthetic device for small animals. Confirm the depth of anesthesia with an absence of toe pinch reflex. Maintain the anesthesia with isoflurane (3%) throughout the surgery.",
    "Next, make an incision into the skin, muscles, and ribs with surgical scissors and forceps to expose the heart. After making an incision into the right atrium, inject PBS into the left ventricle to draw out blood throughout the body until the kidney color changes to pale yellow (indicating that the whole mouse body is perfused with PBS).\n\tNOTE: Cardiac perfusion is performed to efficiently remove the blood throughout the body .\nStop isoflurane and remove the kidneys from the mice and wash them with PBS. After that, remove renal capsules from the kidneys and wash the kidneys twice with PBS.\nEmbed the kidney tissue samples in OCT compound and freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nUse a cryostat to prepare sections (5 µm thick). Mount the sections onto silane-coated glass slides and fix them with 4% paraformaldehyde.\n\tNOTE: Kidney tissues can optionally be stained with fluorescein-labeled Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (2 mg/mL) at RT for 2 h for proximal tubules, followed by DAPI (30 nM in PBS) at RT for 15 min for cell nuclei.\nGently wash the slides twice with PBS.\nVisualize the fluorescence staining by fluorescence microscopy at 100x and 400x magnification and appropriate imaging software.\n3. Confirmation of target miRNA alterations following delivery of miRNA mimic to kidney by PEI-NP via tail vein injection\nPerform quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm the target miRNA alternations.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the previously published article for the details of qRT-PCR18,19,20. The qRT-PCR system used to generate the representative results provided below was changed by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR should be conducted in accordance with the latest manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required.
