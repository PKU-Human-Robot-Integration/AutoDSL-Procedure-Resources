    "1. Preparation of buffers and protein solutions\nPrepare the aqueous Inner Non-Polymerization (INP) Buffer in a total volume of 5 mL by mixing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM Dabco, 320 mM sucrose, and 0.2 mM ATP.\nPrepare the Protein Mix (PM) by adding proteins to the INP buffer at 4 °C with the following concentrations: 11.2 µM non-fluorescent G-actin, 2.8 µM fluorescently labeled actin, and 0.24 µM Arp2/3 (Table of Materials). To form an F-actin layer, add 100 nM gelsolin, 4 µM cofilin, and 2.2 µM VCA-His to the PM. As a control experiment, replace PM by 100 µg/mL fluorescent dye (Table of Materials).\nPrepare the aqueous Inner Polymerization (IP) Buffer (aqueous) in a total volume of 5 mL by mixing 100 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM Dabco, 10 mM ATP, and 80 mM sucrose.\nPrepare the Final Buffer (FB) by mixing INP buffer (containing PM) and IP buffer at a volume ratio of 1:1 to yield the inner aqueous solution in a total volume of 30 µL that will be encapsulated within the liposome.\nPrepare the aqueous Outside Buffer (OB) in a total volume of 150 µL by mixing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 2mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 2mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM Dabco, 212 mM glucose, and 0.1 mg/mL β-casein.\n\tNOTE: The osmolarity of the OB can be adjusted with glucose to ensure the osmotic pressure of the OB is slightly larger than that of the FB (20-60 mOsm). The density of the FB should be slightly higher than the OB.\n2. Preparation of liposomes based on the inverted emulsion techniques\nPrepare the lipid-oil mixture",
    "Add 100 µL of 25 mg/mL L-α-phosphatidylcholine (non-fluorescent Egg PC, also called EPC, including 1% DHPE) into a glass vial. Evaporate chloroform with argon gas, leaving a dry solid lipid film (2.5 mg) at the bottom of the vial.\n\t\t\nTo form an F-actin layer, add 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{[n(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid] succinyl} nickel salt (DOGS-NTA-Ni) at a 10:1 ratio of EPC to DOGS-NTA-Ni and mix before the evaporation of chloroform.\nAdd 2 mL of mineral oil and sonicate the lipid-oil mixture at room temperature in a bath for 1 h to re-suspend the lipids.\n\t\tNOTE: The lipid-oil mixture after sonication can be kept for 1 week at 4 °C. Re-sonication is suggested before use.\nPrepare a Final Buffer in oil (FB/oil) emulsion for preparing monolayer lipid droplets containing the protein of interest.\n\t\nTo 100 µL of lipid-oil mixture taken in a plastic tube, add 10 µL of FB. Ensure that FB is in one droplet.\nUsing a glass syringe, draw the lipid-oil-FB mixture and gently aspirate up and down multiple times to emulsify it; draw a small amount of lipid-oil mixture first, and then the FB droplet by placing the tip of the syringe at the periphery of the droplet to break it up into tiny droplets. Repeat the up and down aspiration until a whitish and cloudy emulsion is formed.\nPut 30 µL of OB in a separate plastic tube. Place 30 µL of the lipid-oil mixture on top of OB and let it sit for ~10 mins to develop a lipid monolayer at the interface.\n\tNOTE: If the lipids are charged or the protein is incorporated, the duration of this step should be extended38.\nPrepare the liposomes\n\t\nCarefully add 50 µL of the FB/oil emulsion (step 2.2) to the top oil phase of the tube from step 2.3.",
    "Centrifuge the plastic tube at 100 x g for 15 mins at 4 °C. Vary time and centrifugation speed to optimize for liposome formation.\n\t\tNOTE: After centrifugation, the top oil phase should be clear, and the bottom OB (containing liposomes) should be slightly cloudy.\nCarefully remove the oil phase away by pipette. Aspirate extra volume if needed. Ensure not to put the pipette tip at the side of the tube to avoid creating a meniscus of oil on top of the liposome phase.\nWith a new pipette, slowly stick the pipette tip into the remaining bottom phase and aspirate the aqueous volume to collect liposomes.\n\t\tNOTE: It is better to lose volume than to incorporate the oil. The inclusion of oil will cause liposomes to rupture, and the internal components will be released into the external buffer. Cut the tip of a pipette to reduce shear.\n3. Microscopy observation\nPour 100 µL of OB into the well of an incubation chamber (4-well plate containing 12 mm round coverslips). Gently deposit the collected liposomes (step 2.4.4) into OB, and then place another coverslip on top of the chamber.\n\tNOTE: The OB contains the β-casein to passivate the glass surface and minimize sticking between the liposomes20.\nObserve liposomes with a confocal microscope using a 63x oil-immersion objective. Use 488 nm, 647 nm, and 561 nm laser lines to observe fluorescently labeled lipid, encapsulated fluorescent dye, and encapsulated fluorescently labeled actin, respectively. Capture the frames of interest and save the images in TIFF format.\nProcess and analyze images in ImageJ/Fiji39. For new users of ImageJ/Fiji, an online tutorial is available (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nOpen the TIFF file using ImageJ/Fiji software.",
    "Go to Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast. Adjust the brightness and contrast of the image to the desired scale by adjusting the Minimum and Maximum settings, and the Brightness, and Contrast sliders.\nClick on the Rectangle selection tool in the toolbar and select the region of interest (ROI). Go to Image > Crop to crop the ROI.\nGo to Analyze > Set Scale. In the pop-up window, enter 1.0 in the Pixel Aspect Ratio field and set μm as the Unit of Length. In the Distance in Pixels field, enter the image width in pixels. In the Known Distance field, enter the real image width in microns.\nTo measure the size of the liposome, Using the Oval selection tool in the toolbar, draw a circle along the edge of the liposome. Go to Analyze > Measure to measure the area of the circle, from which the diameter of the liposome can be calculated.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
