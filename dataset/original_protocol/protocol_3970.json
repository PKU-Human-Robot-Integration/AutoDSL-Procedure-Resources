Transfer the spleen to a 15 mL collection tube containing 5 mL of T cell culture medium (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) with forceps.\nPour the spleen with T cell culture medium into a 100 mm Petri dish.\nCritical: To maintain the aseptic condition, work in the tissue culture hood.\nPut a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL conical tube and rinse the cell strainer with 1 mL ice cold 1×PBS (pH 7.4).\nSmash the spleen on the cell strainer using a sterile plunger of a 1 mL syringe and flush the cell strainer with 10 mL ice cold 1×PBS (pH7.4).\nDiscard the cell strainer and centrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant by gently flipping the 50 mL tube. Add 2 mL red blood cell lysis buffer to the tube and resuspend the splenocytes by gentle pipetting. Incubate for 3 min on ice.\nNote: Optimal lysis of erythrocytes is usually achieved by incubating at room temperature. However, for subsequent naive CD4+ T cell purification, the manufacturer suggests that cells always be kept cold. So, we keep the cells on ice.",
    "Add 5 mL of T cell culture medium to stop the lysis of red blood cells and centrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant. Resuspend the splenocytes with 10 mL of ice cold pH 7.4 1×PBS and keep the cells on ice until finishing the cell counting.\nNote: Repeat step 9–10 if the cell pellet is still red.\nTake out 20 μL of the cell suspension, dilute 10 times in 0.1% trypan blue, and determine the splenocyte number with hemocytometer.\nTake 7 × 106 splenocytes prior to naïve CD4+ T cell purification for staining of the compensation control and for the evaluation of naive CD4+ T cells percentage before purification by flow cytometry.\nNeonatal naïve CD4+ T-cell purification via magnetic bead-based negative selection\nTiming: 25–30 min\nThis step contains information on how to purify naïve CD4+ T cells from the splenocyte suspension using a magnetic bead-based isolation kit.

Mix well and incubate for 5 min in the refrigerator (2–8°C).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_936_1.csv\nSterilize with 0.22 μm filter and store at 4°C for up to 1 month.\nAdd 200 μL of purification buffer, 200 μL of Anti-Biotin MicroBeads and 100 μL of CD44 MicroBeads per 10⁸ total cells in sequence. Mix them well and incubate for 10 min in the refrigerator (2–8°C).\nPlace a LS column in the magnetic field of MidiMACS Separator and prepare the LS column by rinsing with 3 mL of purification buffer.",
    "Apply the cell suspension onto the column and collect the flow-through that contain unlabeled cells enriched in naïve CD4+ T cells.\nWash the column with 3 mL of purification buffer. Collect unlabeled cells in the flow-through and combine with the flow-through from step 18.\nDetermine the cell number with hemocytometer. Take 1 × 106 cells for staining to evaluate the purity of naïve CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry.\nAlternatives: Here, we used the magnetic bead-based negative selection isolation kit to purify naïve CD4+ T cells because it is effective and time saving. Magnetic bead-based positive selection isolation kit can also be used for purification. Another alternative approach is to FACS-sort naïve CD4+ T cells that yields slightly higher purity; however, it takes longer time and requires a cell sorter. As few as 0.2 million cells can be used for staining to evaluate the purity.\nEvaluate naïve CD4+ T-cell purity by flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step contains information on antibody staining to evaluate the purity of the isolated naïve CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry. In total, 7 × 106 splenocytes (before purification) and 1 × 106 purified naïve CD4+ T cells will be used.

Discard the supernatant completely.\nCritical: During the following steps, cells have to be protected from light with aluminum foil.\nDuring the spin, prepare Live/Dead Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 staining solution by diluting 1 μL of a concentrated stock with 2 mL of 1×PBS (pH 7.4).\nResuspend the cell pellet in one well as the compensation control for Fixable Viability Dye staining and the two wells for multiple staining with 100 μL of diluted Live/Dead Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780. Resuspend the cell pellet in other wells with 200 μL 1×PBS (pH 7.4) and incubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nDuring the incubation, prepare multiple staining antibody solution as shown in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] and single staining solutions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_936_3.csv\nStore at 4°C for up to 1 month.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_936_4.csv\nPrepare immediately before use.\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.

    "Note: According to the manufacturer’s protocol, it is best to stain with Live/Dead Fixable Viability Dye in azide and protein-free PBS for the brightest staining.\nWash twice by adding 300 μL of FACS buffer, centrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of FACS buffer. Passage the cell suspension through the 40 μm cell strainer on top of the 5 mL Falcon® tube before analysis with Fortessa 405/488/561/640 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer.\nSee Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for the gating strategy of naïve CD4+ T cell analysis with Flowjo software. Purity over 95% is considered acceptable. If the purity is less than 95%, another round of enrichment is suggested.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/936-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

A mouse, rat or hamster origin antibody with APC-Cy7 labeling should be used for the compensation of Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780.\nCritical: Since some surface markers, like CD62L, are temperature sensitive, always keep the plate on ice during the process of staining and use a centrifuge setting at 4°C.\nNeonatal naïve CD4+ T-cell differentiation in vitro\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step contains information on differentiation conditions of neonatal naïve CD4+ T cells.\nCentrifuge the purified naïve CD4+ T cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant completely.\nDuring the spin, wash the αCD3 pre-coated, 48-well tissue culture plate with 1mL 1×PBS (pH 7.4).",

    "Note: Prepare immediately before use and add reagents individually to the culture medium. As human IL-2 stimulates proliferation of mouse T cells at similar concentration, we used human IL-2 in our protocol. Alternatively, mouse IL-2 can also be used at the same concentration. The optimal working concentration of TGF-β should be titrated by the operator, since it can vary among different batches. As naive CD4+ T cells do not express IL-23R and IL-23 promotes maintenance but not commitment to the Th17 lineage (Stritesky et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), add IL-23 after 2 days. Only adding the 5μL of IL-23 to each well with the already existing culture medium containing the other reconbimants/reagents.\nNote: Add IL-23 after 2 days.\nPut the plate into a CO2 incubator and culture for 4 days at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAlternatives: we have employed a suboptimal differentiation condition in our screen for neurotransmitters that can modulate CD4+ T cell differentiation. Standard T cell differentiation can be achieved by adding anti-mIL-4 antibody (10 μg/mL) to Th1 culture, anti-mIFN-γ antibody (10 μg/mL) to Th2 culture, anti-mIL-4 antibody (10 μg/mL) and anti-mIFN-γ antibody (10 μg/mL) to Th17 culture at the beginning of each culture.\nEvaluate T-cell differentiation by cytokine gene expression assays via qPCR\nTiming: 3.5–4 h\nThis step contains information on RNA extraction and quantification of cytokine gene expression by qPCR to evaluate T cell differentiation.\nRNA extraction.
