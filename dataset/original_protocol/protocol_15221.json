    "1. Exposure to Ultraviolet Radiation\n15 min before the exposure, anesthetize a female Sprague-Dawley rat with a mixture of 90 mg/kg Ketalar (ketamine) and 10 mg/kg Rompun (xylazine) by intraperitoneal injection.\nPlace the animal in a rat restrainer and tighten the belts until immobilization of the rat without causing a trunk squeeze 13.\nInstill Mydriacyl (tropicamide), 10 mg/ml, in both eyes of the rat to induce mydriasis.\nPlace the animal so that one eye is positioned against a narrow beam of UVR at 300 nm 14 with 10 nm full width at half maximum and shield the contralateral eye with black tape.\nExpose the rat unilaterally to sub-threshold dose 1 kJ/m2 UVR-B at 300 nm for 15 min 15.\n2. Dissection\nAfter pre-determined post exposure interval (1, 5, 24 and 120 hr), sacrifice the six week old rat (weight < 200 g) by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and dislocation of the cervical vertebrae.\nEnucleate eyes. Thereafter, put the eye cornea down, posterior side up. Then, punch a minimal hole by applying a 27 gauge cannula and push tangentially to the sclera to avoid damaging the lens that is very close to the sclera. Then use a pair of ophthalmic surgery scissors to cut circumferentially just behind the limbus until the posterior portion of the sclera can be lifted off. Then, lift the lens with a blunt curved forceps.\nRemove remnants of the ciliary body from the lens equator under a microscope, keeping the lens in balanced salt solution no longer than 5-10 min.\n3. Quantitative RT-PCR\nPlace a lens into a mix of 350 μl RA1 lysis buffer (NucleoSpin RNA II total RNA isolation kit) and 3.5 μl β-mercaptoethanol in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.\nKeep the lens in this mix during 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Homogenize the lens with a needle until only hard nucleus of the lens is left from the lens (cortex and capsule of the lens are lysed in the lysis buffer). Remove the nucleus from the mix.\nStore samples immediately at -70 °C.\nThaw the samples and follow the protocol \"Total RNA purification from cultured cells and tissue\" (NucleoSpin RNA II total RNA isolation kit).\nStore RNA samples at -70 °C.\nTo verify sufficient removal of DNA from each sample, run a PCR under the following conditions (step 1: 95 °C for 2 min; step 2 for 40 cycles: 95 °C for 20 sec, 55 °C for 20 sec, 72 °C for 20 sec; step 3: 72 °C for 7 min) with p53 DNA specific primers, forward 5'-ACCCTCTGACCTTTTTCCCA-3' and reverse 5'-TGCTGGGATCTTAGGCACTC-3' and Taq DNA polymerase (dNTPack), according to the manufacture protocol. The expected PCR product is 243 base pairs.\nRun a 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis to detect DNA specific PCR product of 243 base pairs. To prepare 1.5 % agarose gel in TBE buffer take 3.75 g of agarose and solve it in 250 ml of TBE buffer. Add ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) 500 μl in 500 ml of 1.5 % agarose gel solution. Heat the mixture in a microwave owen and stir to solve the agarose.\nNone of the samples has to reveal any DNA specific PCR products on 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis.\nMeasure the concentration of RNA samples (1 μl) and the ratio of sample absorbance at 260 nm (RNA) and 280 nm (protein) in a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. If the ratio RNA to protein of RNA sample absorbance is 2.0 or more then the RNA sample is pure. If the ratio of RNA sample absorbance is lower than 2.0, redo RNA purification step 3.5.",
    "Take a volume of RNA sample corresponding to 1 μg and synthesize cDNA following the protocol 1st Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (1st Strand cDNA synthesis Kit for RT-PCR).\nStore cDNA samples at -20 °C (for a period of 1 and more years, store at -70 °C).\nRun quantitative real-time PCR on iCycler MyiQ Single Color Real Time PCR detection system. Load triplicates on 96-well plate with 1 μl cDNA sample, TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix, TaqMan Gene Expression Assay for caspase 3, according to manufacture instructions. Load triplicates on another 96-well plate with 1 μl cDNA sample, TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix, TaqMan Gene Expression Assay for 18s, according to manufacture instructions (TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Protocol). Dilute in series a fraction of cDNA from three randomly chosen non-exposed lenses. Run serial dilutions together with the cDNA from samples in a 96-well plate.\nUse the standard curve method for quantification of the results. The number of cycles at threshold fluorescence is used as the measurement in MyiQ software. A standard curve expressing number of cycles at threshold as function of relative concentration of calibrator is established for the serial dilutions in each plate. cDNA from three non treated lens samples was used for calibration. Relate the threshold number of cycles for each sample to the standard curve to obtain the relative concentration of the sample cDNA measured. Finally, get expression level of the target genes by relating the relative concentration of the target cDNA to the internal control 18s cDNA.\n4. Immunohistochemical Staining\nFixation\n\t\nDissect the eye in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline; pH 7.4).",
    "Put the eye in a tube filled with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) in ice cold for 20 min. Prepare PFA 4 % the day before. Store at +4 °C until use. PFA is fresh for approximately one week.\nRemove PFA with a micropipette. Then, wash with ice cold PBS for 20 min.\nPut the eye in sucrose 30 % at +4 °C over night.\nPut the eye in a cup filled with Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT)-medium (Tissue-Tek). Put the eye in a suitable position for sectioning.\nFreeze in OCT-medium over dry ice.\nStore at -70 °C until use.\nSectioning\n\t\nPosition the eye for cryo-sectioning in an appropriate plane.\nCut three 5 μm thick mid-sagittal sections from a central portion of each lens. Discard at least 6 sections between sequential sections to avoid staining the same nuclei in different sections.\nOnce a section has been cut, gently place a slide on top of it. The section should then stick to the slide.\nLeave the slides to air-dry before use. Slides can be stored at -20 °C until required.\nFluorescence immunohistochemistry\n\t\nLet samples attain room temperature (5-10 min).\nDraw edges around the specimens with a PAP-pen (Invitrogen).\nLet the border dry for a while (10 min).\nLabel the microscope slides.\nRehydrate in 1 × PBS for 15 min.\nPermeabilize in standard block solution for 30 min.\nAdd primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal, cleaved caspase-3 antibody Asp175 9661; Cell Signalling Technology, Inc) diluted 1:3,000 in standard block solution.\nStore in a humidified chamber at +4 °C over night.\nWash in PBS by pipetting (3 × 5 min) or by immersing in a large bath (>15 min, 1-2 changes).\nAdd secondary antibody (anti rabbit secondary antibody with a specific absorption/emission spectrum) diluted 1:300 in the standard block solution.",
    "Wash in PBS by pipetting (3 × 5 min) or by immersing in a large bath (>15 min, 1-2 changes).\nWipe off PAP-pen smears.\nStore in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 3 hr. Avoid exposure to light.\nAdd a drop of Vectashield and place a cover slip on the slide. Avoid making bubbles.\nLet the Vectashield harden (~20 min).\nKeep sections in the dark until analysis.\nAll control sections are processed in the absence of primary antibody.\nLook for the results within a few hours under a fluorescence microscope.\nCount epithelial cell' nuclei from one side nuclear bow to other side nuclear bow of each lens. Apply the standard blue filter to see all lens epithelial nuclei in blue and a standard filter that fits the emission of the secondary antibody to see the caspase-3 positive nuclei in green.\nRecord the number of all lens epithelial nuclei and the number of positive nuclei. Count the cells three times for each section.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
