Normally, triplicates are recommended.\nNote: Since drug treatment (see below) may reduce cell growth, adjustment of the seeded cell number may be needed. We typically set up the cell number to yield ∼80% confluence at the time of cell lysis.\nDay 3–4.\nTreat the cells with the compounds and the same volume of solvent for the control.\nFor MG132:\nTreat the cells with the compound at 5 μM or the solvent DMSO on day 4.\nIncubate them for 10 h.\nFor SSA:\nTreat the cells with the compound at 100 ng/mL or the solvent MeOH on day 3.\nIncubate them for 24 h.\nCell lysis\nTiming: 2 h\nDay 4.\nThis section describes the method of cell harvesting and the preparation of cell lysate.\nAspirate the medium from the wells of a 6-well plate.\nRinse the wells gently with 1 mL of PBS and then aspirate the PBS.",
    "Add 150 μL of PBS and 15 μL of 10× Trypsin-EDTA, incubate for 5 min at 37°C in the CO₂ incubator, and then add 165 μL of warm medium. Tilt the dish and pipet the buffer several times from the pool back toward the top of the dish, scrape down the slope of the dish to ensure that all the cells are detached, and collect them in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes by pipetting.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 800 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant to collect the cell pellet.\nRinse the cell pellet by 400 μL of ice-cold PBS and spin down the cells at 800 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nNote: From here, keep the sample on ice as much as possible until the protein samples are mixed with 1% SDS solution (step 16).\nRemove the supernatant and suspend the cells in ice-cold 125 μL of PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100).\nLyse the cells with the sonicator in “high” intensity mode for 6 min (On: 30 s and Off: 60 s) in a sonication bath containing water with crushed ice.\nNote: Although our setup, including the sonicator (Bioruptor) and buffer (PBS), typically does not form bubbles, foaming generally affects the cell lysis efficacy and should be avoided.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris.\nCollect the supernatant by pipetting into a new 1.5-mL tube.\nCritical: Avoid collection of the supernatant very close to the pellet, as cell debris in the pellet may become trapped on the filter and produce false-positive results.\nProceed to the filter trap assay immediately or flash-freeze the lysate with liquid nitrogen and store at –80°C.\nPause point: The lysate can be stored at –80°C.\nFilter trap assay",
    "Timing: 3–4 h\nThis section describes the method to collect aggregated proteins in the lysate on a filter membrane.\nMeasure the protein concentration in the lysate by Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay Kit with a plate reader according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: The lysate typically contains 1–3 μg/μL of proteins.\nPrepare the sample mix in a new 1.5-mL tube to load onto a slot-blot filtration apparatus as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1853_4.csv\nIncubate the samples at 25°C for 10 min.\nCut the cellulose acetate membrane filter to the same size as the Bio-Dot SF filter paper (11.3 × 7.7 cm).\nSoak three Bio-Dot SF filter papers and a cut cellulose acetate membrane filter in ∼50 mL of 1% SDS solution for 10 min.\nCritical: The thickness and number of filter papers play an important role in supporting the cellulose acetate membrane for tight assembly of cassettes of the slot-blot apparatus and thus for uniform vacuum suction. The thickness and number of filter papers should be optimized to minimize leakage of the samples from one well to another.\nThoroughly clean and dry the slot-blot filtration apparatus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1853-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Assembly of the filter trapping apparatus",
    "Schematic of the assembly of a cellulose acetate membrane and supporting filter papers in a slot blot cassette. Pre-soak both of the membrane and filter papers with 1% SDS solution. Place the cellulose acetate membrane on top of the filter papers. (Left, side view) Arrange this assembly above the bottom part of the slot-blot cassette (Gasket support plate) of the filter trapping apparatus and clamp this setup to the top part of cassette (sample template) with screws and tighten them well under vacuum connected to the vacuum. (Right, top view) Schematic view of the tightened cassette ready for sample loading into its well for the filter trapping experiment.\nPlace the presoaked Bio-Dot SF filter papers on the bottom part of the cassette of the slot-blot apparatus and the presoaked cellulose acetate membrane on top (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Avoid trapping air bubbles between filter paper and the membrane. Use a roller to ensure that there are no trapped bubbles.\nAssemble the cassette, putting the top part in place, and tighten all the screws.\nNote: Screws are tightened in a diagonal manner to equalize the pressure.\nApply vacuum and further tighten the screws. Turn off the vacuum.\nCritical: Retightening of the screws under vacuum prevents sample leakage, which can cause cross-well contamination and halo formation (Sin et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nLoad 100 μL of 1% SDS buffer into each of the wells and apply vacuum suction until the buffer passes through the filter. Wait until draining is complete.\nNote: The well should not be dried before loading the sample. A dried membrane may lead to a nonuniform sample distribution, causing halos during vacuum filtration.\nImmediately, load 120 μL of the samples containing 20 μg of protein (prepared on step 16) for comparison in each sample slot.",
    "Note: Excessive sample loading may lead to halos around the well and inefficient vacuum suction; hence, the optimum concentration of samples should be used according to the well size of the apparatus. In our setup, we often have good results with 5–60 μg of total proteins.\nNote: Load 1% SDS in the empty wells. This is important to ensure uniform vacuum intensity in all the wells.\nApply vacuum to drain the lysate to through the membrane filter. Wait until draining is complete and then turn off the vacuum immediately.\nNote: Usually, the suction of lysate with 20 μg of protein takes a total of 0.5–2 min. We used relatively mild vacuum conditions.\nLoad 100 μL of 1% SDS solution into the wells and apply vacuum to drain the solution. Wait until the solution is completely drained and then turn off the vacuum immediately to avoid overdrying.\nOptional: This wash step may be repeated as necessary when the background signal is too high (see also the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nRemove all the screws of the cassette of the slot-blot apparatus under vacuum. Then, stop applying vacuum. Carefully disassemble the apparatus.\nPlace the membrane on a square petri dish and rinse the membrane with Milli-Q water.\nCritical: Avoid overdrying the membrane, which may lead to deformation of the cellulose acetate membrane and undesired high background staining downstream.\nNote: The apparatus should be cleaned properly with detergent and Milli-Q water for the next use.\nProceed immediately to the next step as described below.\nDetection of total filter-trapped proteins\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the process for detecting the total proteins trapped on the cellulose acetate filter membrane.\nAspirate the Milli-Q water from the dish.\nPour 6 mL of Revert 700 Total Protein Stain onto the membrane.",
    "Incubate at 20°C–25°C with gentle shaking for 5 min.\nAspirate the solution.\nPour 6 mL of Revert Wash Solution onto the membrane.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C with gentle shaking for 2 min.\nRepeat steps 34–36.\nNote: Wash twice with Revert Wash Solution in total.\nAspirate the solution.\nPour 20 mL of Milli-Q water onto the membrane.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C with gentle shaking for 2 min.\nCollect the images using an Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System with the infrared (IR) 680 channel.\nQuantify the Revert 700-stained signal in each sample lane using Image Studio software.

The lysates of HeLa S3 cells obtained after proteasome inhibition by MG132 (5 μM) for 10 h (A) and splicing modulation by SSA (100 ng/mL) for 24 h (B) were used. Titrated amounts of proteins (5, 10, and 20 μg) were tested. Proteins on the membrane were detected by Revert 700 staining. Total protein aggregation at 20 μg protein loading was quantified (right).

    "Mix the transfection reagents as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1853_5.csv\nNote: Bring the Opti-MEM and FuGENE HD to 20°C–25°C before mixing.\nNote: The transfection condition (e.g., the type of transfection reagents, the ratio between the amounts of transfection reagent and plasmid DNA, incubation time, etc.) should be optimized for different cell types, according to the manufacturers’ instructions.\nIncubate the mixture at 20°C–25°C for 20 min.\nAdd to the cell culture in a dropwise manner.\nIncubate cells for 48 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.\nCell lysis\nTiming: 2 h\nDay 4.\nThis section describes the method of cell harvesting and the preparation of cell lysate.\nProceed to cell harvesting from step 4 to step 14.\nPause point: The lysate can be stored at –80°C.\nFilter trap assay\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis section describes the method to collect aggregated proteins in the lysate on a filter membrane.\nProceed to filter trap assay from step 15 to step 30.\nImmunodetection of specific filter-trapped proteins\nTiming: 5–6 h\nThis step describes the process for detecting the specific proteins trapped on the cellulose acetate filter membrane by immunoprobing.\nAspirate the Milli-Q water from the dish.\nPour 6 mL of Odyssey Blocking Buffer (TBS) onto the membrane in a square petri dish.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C with gentle shaking for 1 h.\nNote: The membrane stained with Revert 700 Total Protein Stain (from step 31 to step 42) can be used for this assay. Destain the membrane in enough water for 30 min before blocking with Odyssey Blocking Buffer.\nNote: The blocking buffer and the concentration of primary and secondary antibodies (see below) should be optimized depending upon epitopes, the imaging system, etc.\nOptional: Blocking and antibody incubation could be conducted within plastic hybridization bags.",
