    "1. Husbandry of Tribolium Cultures\nNOTE: Standard conditions are defined as an incubation temperature of 25 °C and 70% relative humidity in a 12 h bright/12 h dark cycle. For more information on Tribolium husbandry, respective guidelines are available64. This protocol requires two different flour-based media, which can be prepared in kilogram quantities and stored for several months.\nPrior to working with flour and inactive dry yeast, store the unopened packages at -20 °C for 24 h and then let them warm up to room temperature. This procedure eliminates potential pathogens.\nPass full grain wheat flour and inactive dry yeast through a sieve with 710 µm mesh size, then prepare growth medium by supplementing the sifted full grain flour with 5% (w/w) sifted inactive dry yeast.\nPass 405 fine wheat flour and inactive dry yeast through a sieve with 250 µm mesh size, then prepare egg-laying medium by supplementing the sifted 405 fine wheat flour with 5% (w/w) sifted inactive dry yeast.\nPass the respective Tribolium culture through a sieve with 800 µm mesh size. Discard the leftover growth medium. Transfer the larvae, pupae and adults to a large glass dish.\nIf no progeny culture exists, transfer around 80 larvae and/or pupae to a new glass bottle to establish a new progeny culture. If no larvae and/or pupae are present, take around 40 adults instead. Add 50 g of growth medium and incubate under standard conditions.\nCollect around 300 adults (500-700 mg) in another new glass bottle to establish the imaging culture. Add 50 g of growth medium and incubate under standard conditions. Allow the imaging culture to settle for at least 24 h in the fresh growth medium before embryo collection.",
    "Replace the growth medium of the imaging culture at least every two weeks, which can be done in conjunction with embryo collection (see 3.2). After two to three months, replace the imaging culture completely by new adults from the progeny culture.\nIf a non-homozygous transgenic line is used, curate the progeny cultures frequently by removing non-transgenic animals. Ideally, generate homozygous lines if the respective transgene is not lethal or causes sterility when present on both chromosomes. Homozygous cultures typically have a higher average fluorescence level and the overall experimental conditions are narrower, since only one genotype is present.\n2. Microscope Setup and Calibration\nNOTE: The Tribolium embryo has an anterior-posterior length of about 600-660 µm and a transversal diameter of about 300-330 µm. Most modern CCD cameras have a sensor chip size of about 9 mm x 7 mm, i.e. a diameter of 11.4 µm, and a pixel-pixel distance of 6.45 µm. When combined with a 10X magnification objective lens, the embryo can be imaged in toto with a pixel pitch of 0.645 µm. Most modern sCMOS cameras have a larger sensor chip size of about 16 mm x 14 mm, i.e. a diameter of 21.3 µm, and a pixel-pixel distance of 6.5 µm. When combined with a 20X magnification objective lens, the embryo can be imaged in toto with a pixel pitch of 0.325 µm.\nAttach the illumination and detection objective lenses to the microscope. Ensure that lasers and fluorescence filters match the fluorophore absorption and emission spectra very well.\nAttach the sample chamber to the microscope. Fill the sample chamber with PBS pH 7.4 or any other appropriate imaging buffer.",
    "Switch on and calibrate the microscope. Comprehensive calibration routines and troubleshooting guidelines for custom-built light sheet-based microscopes (more specifically for the DSLM implementation) have been published previously65. For commercial devices, follow the manufacturer's instructions very carefully. Mishandling might deplete the sample chamber of the medium and cause havoc to the instrument as well as the specimen.\n3. Collection of Transgenic or WT Embryos\nPass the imaging colony through a sieve with 800 µm mesh size. Collect adult beetles in a new glass bottle and add 10 g of egg-laying medium. Incubate the egg-laying culture for 1 h at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity in light.\nPass the egg-laying culture through a sieve with 800-µm mesh size to separate adults from the egg-laying medium, which contains around 30-100 embryos. Transfer adults to a new glass bottle and add either the old or 50 g of fresh growth medium.\nIf observation should start at the uniform blastoderm stage (example dataset DS0002), incubate the egg-laying medium for 15 h at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity. To start at the beginning of germband retraction (example datasets DS0001 and DS0003), incubate embryos for 23 h at 32 °C and 70% relative humidity. If other developmental stages are desired, refer to the respective literature64,65 and adapt incubation time and/or temperature as necessary.\n4. Embryo Dechorionation\nNOTE: The chorion is the outer layer of the eggshell and consists of proteins and polysaccharides. It is strongly light absorbent but not essential for proper development and can thus be chemically removed.\nPass the egg-laying medium through a sieve with 300 µm mesh size. Collect the embryos in a cell strainer with 100 µm mesh size and discard the leftover egg-laying medium.",
    "Prepare a 6-well plate as follows: fill the A1, A2, A3 and B3 wells with 10 mL PBS pH 7.4 and the B1 and B2 wells with 9 mL PBS. Then carefully add 1 mL sodium hypochlorite to B1 and B2. Observe the progress of steps 4.3 to 4.8 under the stereo microscope. CAUTION sodium hypochlorite is corrosive.\nInsert the cell strainer into the A1 well (PBS pH 7.4) and wash the embryos for one minute under gentle agitation. Larger flour particles should detach from the embryos.\nTransfer the cell strainer to the B1 well (sodium hypochlorite in PBS pH 7.4) and shake the plate vigorously for 30 s. The remaining flour particles should detach completely from the embryos.\nTransfer the cell strainer to the A2 well (PBS pH 7.4) and wash the embryos for 1 min under gentle agitation.\nFor dechorionation, transfer the cell strainer to the B2 well (sodium hypochlorite in PBS pH 7.4). Shake the plate vigorously until the chorion ruptures and detaches from the embryos. The chorion looks like a thin, semi-transparent membrane with lacerated edges, while dechorionated embryos have a plain silhouette.\nTransfer the cell strainer to the A3 well (PBS pH 7.4) and wash the embryos for 1 min under gentle agitation. If any chorion fragments are still attached to the embryos after the washing, repeat step 4.6.\nStore the embryos in the B3 well (PBS pH 7.4). Storage for several hours does not harm the embryos, but keep in mind that development continues.\nFor non-homozygous transgenic lines, remove any non-fluorescent embryos if possible. For fixation and staining of WT or transgenic embryos, continue with step 5. For live imaging of transgenic embryos, continue with step 6.\n5. Vitelline Membrane Permeabilization, Fixation, and Staining",
    "NOTE: The vitelline membrane is the inner layer of the eggshell. It is impervious for fluorescent dyes and thus has to be chemically permeabilized before staining.\nFill a scintillation vial with fixation/permeabilization solution (1.5 mL 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 6.9 and 1.5 mL n-heptane). Transfer embryos with a paintbrush to the vials. Cover vials with aluminum foil to protect fluorophores from light and incubate for 30 min on a rocking platform at 50 rotations per minute. CAUTION paraformaldehyde is toxic and corrosive, n-heptane is flammable and toxic.\nRemove fixation solution and treat embryos three times for 15 min in 3 mL 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS pH 7.4 and subsequently once for 15 min in 3 mL 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS pH 7.4 on a rocking platform at 50 rotations per minute. CAUTION Triton X-100 is corrosive.\nRemove permeabilization solution and add 0.5 mL staining solution to the vial. Exemplary staining solutions are provided in Table 2. Stain embryos overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform at 50 rotations per minute. For the dyes proposed in Table 2, washing is not necessary.\n6. Preparation of Mounting Agarose\nAdd 1 g low-melt agarose to 100 mL PBS pH 7.4 and heat the mixture for 2-3 min in a microwave oven at 800 W. If small agarose particles are still present, repeat the heating process in 30 sec intervals until the particles dissolve completely. The mounting agarose does not need to be prepared freshly every time, the solidified agarose can be re-liquefied by heating as described above. This process can be repeated 5-6 times before too much water has evaporated.",
    "Allow the agarose to cool down to approximately 40-45 °C, then fill two 1.5 mL reaction tubes with the heated agarose and keep those tubes at 35 °C in a thermoblock.\n7. Embryo Mounting and Insertion into the Sample Chamber\nOption 1: Agarose column (Figure 3A-C, first column; Table 3, second column)\nFill a 1.0 mL syringe with distilled water and attach it to one of the glass capillary openings by using a small rubber hose. Fill the capillary halfway with distilled water.\nPick an embryo with a paintbrush and place it on the inner side of the other glass capillary opening. Proceed quickly to the next step before the embryo dries out.\nStick the capillary into the liquid agarose and slowly draw a few µL of liquid agarose alongside the embryo into the capillary. Then quickly increase the drawing force so that the embryo is dragged along with the agarose. In the end, a few µL of agarose should be above and below the embryo. Set the capillary aside for a few minutes and let the agarose solidify.\nShorten the capillary with a diamond glass cutter to a length of about 5 mm. The remaining fragment should be completely filled with agarose and the embryo should be within the second quartile.\nInsert the steel cylinder with the pin into the sample chamber, and then stick the capillary fragment on top of the pin. The agarose column should protrude a few millimeters from the capillary fragment with the part that contains the embryo.\nOption 2: Agarose hemisphere (Figure 3A-C, second column; Table 3, third column)",
    "Draw 200 µL of liquid agarose into a 1.0 mL syringe, then use it to fill the steel pipe from the top with agarose until a hemisphere forms at the bottom opening. The hemisphere diameter should be equal to the pipe diameter. Wait a few minutes until the agarose has solidified.\nPick an embryo with a paintbrush and rearrange it on the tip of the brush so that the anterior end becomes accessible. Dip the agarose hemisphere into liquid agarose to cover it with a thin film.\nPlace the embryo with its anterior end upright on the pole of the agarose hemisphere. Turn the steel pipe around and correct the position of the embryo with the brush. If necessary, stabilize the embryo by adding 2 µL agarose to the embryo/hemisphere border. Ideally, less than half of the embryo surface should be covered in agarose and the flanks should be as steep as possible.\nInsert the steel pipe with the hemisphere and embryo slowly into the sample chamber.\nOption 3: Cobweb holder (Figure 3A-C, third column; Table 3, fourth column)\nPick an embryo with a paintbrush and set it aside.\nCover the slotted hole of the cobweb holder with 5-8 µL liquid agarose, then remove most of the agarose until only a thin agarose film remains.\nPlace the embryo onto the agarose film and adjust its position. Carefully move the embryo to the x-axis center of the slotted hole, and align its elongated anterior-posterior axis with the elongated axis of the slotted hole.\nInsert the cobweb holder with the mounted embryo slowly into the sample chamber. Position the cobweb holder so that it does not interfere with the excitation and emission light, i.e. 45° relative to the x- and z-axis.\n8. Light Sheet-based Fluorescence Microscopy",
    "Decide along how many directions (and along which orientations) the embryo should be imaged. Four directions (along the orientations 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°) typically provide a good trade-off between coverage and energy load.\nSet up the number of fluorescence channels. The major parameters for each channel are the laser line, the fluorescence filter, the laser power and the exposure time. For long-term live imaging, it is important that the integrated energy load does not exceed the tolerance of the embryo. An exposure time of 25-50 ms ensures fast imaging, while a laser power between 100 and 300 µW should not affect the viability of the embryo. For fixed samples, exposure time and laser power can be at least doubled.\nFor live imaging assays, configure the time lapse. The complete embryogenesis of Tribolium takes about seven days at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and a little less than three days at 32-35 °C64. Define the temporal interval according to the morphogenetic events that should be observed. For short temporal intervals, consider lowering exposure time and laser power (see 8.2).\nPosition the embryo in transmission light mode along the x- and y-axes into the center of the field of view without exposing it to the laser. Rotate the embryo by 360° in 90° steps to examine the embryo for any damage that could have occurred during the mounting process.\nRotate the embryo appropriately around the y-axis to align the embryonic axes with the microscope axes, for example the lateral axis with the x-axis, i.e. the dorsoventral axis with the z-axis. When using the cobweb holder technique, alignment might not be possible.",
    "In the fluorescence mode, define the z-stack for each direction. Add 25-50 µm as spatial buffer in front of and behind the embryo. Including the buffer, the typical z-stack covers around 350-400 µm for a Tribolium embryo. Also define the z-spacing, which should be four times the lateral spacing, i.e. the spacing along the x- and y-axes66.\nIf two or more embryos are imaged in parallel, restart at 8.4 with the next embryo.\nFor long-term imaging, ensure that the sample chamber is filled with sufficient PBS pH 7.4 or other imaging buffer. Also cover the sample chamber opening.\nStart the imaging process. For long-term live imaging, monitor the correct acquisition along all directions in all channels for all embryos. Occasionally check during the next days that the embryos are alive and in the appropriate position.\n9. Embryo Retrieval and Quality Control\nOnce imaging has completed, remove the sample holder with the embryos from the sample chamber. Only embryos from live imaging assays have to be retrieved. Fixed and stained embryos can be discarded.\nIf a live imaging assay was performed, transfer the embryo to an object slide. For the agarose column technique, extract the embryos from the surrounding agarose with a scalpel, micro-knife or razor blade. For the agarose hemisphere technique, transfer the hemisphere with the flat side to the object slide. Embryo removal is not necessary. For the cobweb holder technique, gently dismount the embryos from the agarose film with a paintbrush. Incubate the object slide in a small glass dish in saturated humidity atmosphere under standard conditions until the larvae hatch.",
    "After hatching, transfer the larvae to individual wells of a 24-well plate and add 500 mg of growth medium to each well. Incubate under standard conditions. Compare the total development time and morphology of the imaged larvae to non-imaged WT and transgenic larvae (see discussion). In assays that characterize WT development, no obvious morphological aberrations should ideally be noticeable.\nOnce the larvae develop to healthy adults, provide them with appropriate WT partners of the same background strain. After two weeks, check for progeny production. Also consider to check the fertility of the progeny by mating them inter pares. Only when the imaged embryos develop into fertile adults that produce fertile progeny, the imaging procedure can be considered non-invasive.\n10. Image Data Processing\nNOTE: For image data processing, the open-source image processing software ImageJ67 or its derivate FIJI68 are recommended. Both versions as well as comprehensive documentation are found at www.imagej.net. The standard file format for LSFM data is the tagged image file format (TIFF). The intrinsic container option allows the storage of image stacks such as z-stacks or time series of z maximum projections within a single file that can be opened in ImageJ or FIJI via drag-and-drop.\nIf necessary, rotate the z-stacks to align the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo with the y-axis (Image → Transform → Rotate). Please note that the rotation parameters have to be set individually for each direction, but not for the time lapse and the fluorescence channels.",
    "Crop the z-stacks along the x-, y- and z-axes so that only minimal background (20 - 40 pixels along the x- and y-axes, 5 - 10 planes along the z-axis) remains (for the x- and y-axes, use the Rectangular Selection Tool, then Image → Crop; for the z-axis, use Image → Stacks → Tools → Slice Keeper). Please note that the cropping parameters have to be set individually for each direction, but not for the time points and the fluorescence channels.\nCalculate the z maximum projection for each z-stack (Image → Stacks → Z Project, choose Max Intensity). Intensity projection calculations are data simplification procedures that remove one spatial dimension.\nFor long-term live imaging data, consider using an ImageJ or FIJI script that performs processing steps 10.1 to 10.3 for all directions, all time points and all fluorescence channels65. Ideally, concatenate all z maximum projections per channel and direction and save them as a time series in one TIFF container. Alternatively, the BigDataViewer69 plug-in for FIJI can be used to navigate through Terabyte-large datasets.\nDepending on the transgenic line and imaging modalities, dynamic intensity adjustments of the time stacks might be desirable due to photo-bleaching and/or fluorophore expression fluctuations. Either the ImageJ- or FIJI-intrinsic Bleach Correction function (Image → Adjust → Bleach Correction, choose Histogram Matching) or dedicated software65 are suggested.\nIf the embryo was recorded and/or along multiple directions and in multiple fluorescence channels, horizontal combination of the directions (Image → Stacks → Tools → Combine) and channel merge (Image → Color Merge → Channels) are recommended.",
    "Registration and fusion of z-stacks acquired along multiple directions70, eventually in combination with deconvolution71, allows the calculation of superior three-dimensional images of uniform quality and isotropic resolution. Both plug-ins are open source and pre-installed in FIJI, but they require the presence of landmarks (fluorescent microspheres, e.g. beads) around the specimen.\nOpen-source software frameworks for large-scale quantitative data extraction and analysis are also available, for example for segmentation and tracking of cell nuclei72 or cell shape recognition73.\nSubscription Required.
