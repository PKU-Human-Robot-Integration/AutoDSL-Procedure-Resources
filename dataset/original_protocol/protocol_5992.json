    "Overall procedureOverall procedure for analyzing cargo density of single-extracellular vesicles is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214011445_5660.jpgFigure 1. Overall procedure for detecting cargo density in single-extracellular vesiclesProduction and purification of extracellular vesiclesCell culture and transfection for producing released extracellular vesiclesHeLa cells or MDA-MB-231 cells are plated onto 35 mm culture dish or 6-well plate and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. When cells are at 70% confluence, remove the medium and wash the cells 2 times each with 2 ml of 37 °C DMEM without FBS and P/S.Replace medium with 1.2 ml of 37 °C DMEM containing 10% extracellular vesicles-free fetal bovine serum and 1% P/S.Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 to 48 h. Note: In case of analyzing the exogenous cargo (e.g., GFP- or mCherry-fused protein), transient transfection needs to be carried out using lipid-based transfection reagent (e.g., FuGENE HD) 24 to 48 h before the replacement with the extracellular vesicles-free medium. Purification of extracellular vesiclesFlowchart of this part is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214011511_9009.jpgFigure 2. Flowchart of isolation of extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) by differential centrifugationCell culture media (1.2 ml) from 90%-95% confluent cells is collected in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 500 x g at 4 °C for 10  min to remove the cell debris using a refrigerated microcentrifuge.Collect all 1.2 ml supernatant and transfer to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g at 4 °C for 20  min using a refrigerated microcentrifuge to separate microvesicles and others.Collect the upper 1 ml of supernatant is directly purified by filtration through a 0.22 μm pore filter and transfer into the ultracentrifuge thick wall polycarbonate tube. Approximately 70 µl of sample is lost after the filtration.",
    "The pellet from Step B2e is diluted in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Microvesicle-enriched fraction).Ultracentrifuge the filtrated supernatant using ultracentrifuge (Optima TL, rotor: TLA-100.3) at 100,000 x g at 4 °C for 70  min. Remove supernatant (approximately 930 µl) carefully.Dilute the pellet in 200 μl of PBS (Exosome-enriched fraction).Note: Alternatively exosomes can be purified using total exosome isolation reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of functionalized glass surfaceFlowchart of this part is shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214011535_6935.jpgFigure 3. Flowchart of preparation of functionalized glass surfacePrepare BSA/BSA-biotin mixture with mixing 5 μl of 10 M BSA and 5 μl of 1 M BSA-biotin in 490 μl of PBS. Cover the glass surface of glass bottom 35 mm culture dish with 400 μl of the BSA/BSA-biotin mixture.Incubate at room temperature for 20-30 min.Prepare 25 mM streptavidin solution by diluting 8 μl of 1 M streptavidin in 312 μl of PBS. Remove excess BSA/BSA-biotin by gently rinsing the glass surface once with 1 ml of PBS.Cover the glass surface with 300 μl of the streptavidin solution.Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Gently rinse the BSA/BSA-biotin/streptavidin-coated glass surface twice each with 1 ml of PBS.Labeling of extracellular vesiclesTransfer the isolated extracellular vesicles (200 μl total) into a glass vial.Add 2 μl of 10 mg/ml DOPE-biotin into the glass vial and suspend to mix.Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add 2 μl of 1 mg/ml DiD into the glass vial and suspend to mix.Note: Because DiD staining is the most critical step for calculating the cargo density, it is important to take exact amount of DiD. Spin down the glass vial in a 50 ml conical tube at 200 x g at room temperature and take it out with forceps.Then incubate at room temperature for 15 min in the dark (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214011554_4395.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Labeling of extracellular vesicles with DOPE-biotin and DiD in glass vial Immobilization of extracellular vesicles on glass surfaceThe DOPE-biotin- and DiD-labeled extracellular vesicles are applied onto the functionalized glass surface using gel loading long tip (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214011611_9866.jpgFigure 5. Immobilization of extracellular vesicles on functionalized glass surface. DOPE-biotin- and DiD-labeled extracellular vesicle solution is applied onto functionalized glass surface and made it flat against the surface tension.Leave to stand at 4 °C for 2-3 h in dark condition.Rinse twice each with 2 ml of PBS.Note: In case of analyzing the transiently expressed exogenous cargo (e.g., GFP- or mCherry-fused protein), skip to “(G) Imaging” immediately.Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous cargo in extracellular vesiclesFix immobilized extracellular vesicles with 4% PFA for 5 min in dark condition.Rinse extracellular vesicles twice with 2 ml of PBS and pipette out all solution.Add 150 μl of PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and incubate at room temperature for 30 min in dark condition.Rinse extracellular vesicles once with 2 ml of PBS and pipette out all solution.Add 150 μl of anti-cargo antibody (e.g., anti-cMet antibody) in PBS and incubate at room temperature for 60-90 min in dark condition.Rinse extracellular vesicles once with PBS and pipette out all solution.Add 150 μl of fluorescent-dye conjugated secondary antibody (e.g., Alexa 488 or Alexa 594) in PBS and incubate at room temperature for 30 min in dark condition.Rinse extracellular vesicles twice each with 2 ml of PBS.Store at 4 °C in dark condition, and observe in 2-3 days.Imaging of fluorescence-labeled cargo and DiD using fluorescence microscopeNote: For this imaging part we will show about the exosome sample as a representative.Turn on the confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510 Meta).Open the Zeiss LSM510 v4.2 operating software.Turn on the appropriate laser (e.g.",
    ", Argon laser for excitation of GFP or Alexa 488, 543 nm wavelength He-Ne laser for excitation of mCherry or Alexa 594, 633 nm wavelength He-Ne laser for excitation of DiD).Select 63x objective lens.Set the glass bottom 35 mm culture dish with immobilized and cargo-labeled extracellular vesicles on the specimen holder.Carefully find the glass surface using visible light under eyepiece viewing.Change the observation status to laser scanning.In the “Scan Control panel”, “Mode”, set the level of zoom to x1 (Default).In the “Scan Control panel”, “Channels”, set the pinhole to “200”. Adjust the focus with DiD channel using “Fast XY”.Collect averaged images (e.g., number is selected to 4 for the average) of DiD and fluorescent cargo (e.g., GFP- or mCherry-fused cargo or immunostained cargo with anti-mouse IgG Alexa 488 or anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 as secondary antibody) and save them as lsm format. The acquired images of exosomes are shown in Figure 6 (in case of endogenous cargo) or in Kajimoto et al. (2013) or (2018) (in case of exogenous GFP- or mCherry-fused cargo).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181214/20181214011631_8106.jpgFigure 6.
