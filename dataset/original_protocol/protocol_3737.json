Aliquot the sample, freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen, then store the tubes at −80°C. The resulted RhoA protein is in the GMPPNP- or GTPγS-bound state.\nNote: For RhoA mutant G14V which has reduced intrinsic GTPase activity and impaired GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, the purified RhoAG14V at step 19 is a mixture of GDP-bound and GTP-bound protein. To remove GTP, extra 10 mM EDTA and 5 mM GDP can be added to the sample after step 16, and let the protein sit at 25°C for 3 h before proceeding to step 17.\nExpression and purification of GST-Rhotekin-RBD\nTiming: 5 days\nPrepare the GST-Rhotekin-RBD protein for GST pull-down and for titration with RhoA for 31P NMR data collection. This procedure is similar to RhoA purification.\nExpress GST-Rhotekin-RBD using steps 3–7 as above.\nPurify GST-Rhotekin-RBD using steps 8–13 as above.\nElute the protein from the GSTrap column using 5 CV GST elution buffer.",

GST-Rhotekin-RBD was titrated to the RhoA or RhoA mutant samples to identify the varying conformation states.\nFor 31P NMR spectra collection, make sure the protein concentration > 0.4 mM. The RhoA proteins are in the Gel filtration buffer. Add 50 μL Deuterium oxide to 450 μL protein sample and transfer the sample to 5mm NMR tubes.

Once the probe temperature is stable, insert the sample and allow the sample temperature to stabilize for 15 min minimum. At each temperature, adjust lock, tune and match on 31P channel, and shimming before starting the data collection. Acquire the data using 1D pulse program “zgpg30” from Bruker pulse library with following parameters: time domain (TD) = 30k, DS = 8, spectral width (SW) = 100 ppm, acquisition time (AQ) = 0.6 s, relaxation delay (D1) = 3 s, and adjusted number of scans (NS) depending on the sample concentration.",
    "Add increasing amount of GST-Rhotekin-RBD to the NMR sample (molar ratios of GST-Rhotekin-RBD : RhoA are 0.5, 1, and 2). After 15 min incubation at 25°C, the sample is concentrated back to 500 μL using Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit (10 KDa MWCO) at a speed of 6,000 × g at 4°C. Collect the 31P spectra after each titration.\nProcess the spectra using the Topspin 4.0 software (Bruker). All spectra are manually phased, baseline corrected, and referenced to the phosphoric acid at 0.0 ppm.\nNote: No extra GDP or GTP analogs should be added to the samples. The spectra of free GDP and GTP analogs should be collected in the same buffer as controls in parallel.\nCrystallization and structure determination of RhoA and mutants\nTiming: 2 weeks to 1 month\nCrystallization and structure determination of the RhoA proteins in both GDP-bound and GMPPNP-bound states (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/661-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Structural determination of RhoAWT and mutant RhoAG14V in GDP-bound or GMPPNP-bound state\nThe crystallization process consists of a broad screening using hanging drop method, generating diffracting crystals, data collection, and structure determination.\nThe crystallization screening is performed using commercially available PEG/ion Screen (Hampton research) and the crystallization conditions for RhoA structures deposited in the PDB (rcsb.org[href=http://rcsb.org]). PEG/ion screen is chosen as previous RhoA structures were all crystallized in conditions containing PEG. For example, RhoAG14V-GTPγS (PDB: 1A2B) was crystallized in 20% PEG 8K, 15% 14-dioxane, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5; RhoA-GDP (PDB: 1FTN) was crystallized in 28% PEG 8K, 0.1 M Na acetate pH 5.7, 0.5 mM Na citrate (Ihara et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Wei et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).",
    "Critical: The Switch I & II regions of RhoA are highly flexible and may adapt a large ensemble of conformations. Crystallization conditions and the resulted crystal packing seem to have a role in selecting a particular conformation of the Switch regions. Therefore, it is important to take into account the effect of crystal packing when analyzing the structures.\nConcentration of the RhoA proteins is around 8–10 mg/mL. Crystals are grown by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 μL protein solution and 1 μL reservoir solution against 700 μL reservoir solution at 4°C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion methods.\nThe RhoA crystals are obtained in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.3, 16%–20% PEG 8K, and 15% (v/v) 1, 4-dioxane. The plate crystal appears in two days, and reach the maximum size in 1–2 weeks. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nLoop the crystals using appropriate size loops under the optical microscope. Transfer the crystals with loops and wash them for several seconds, first in cryoprotect solution containing 0.1 M Tris pH 8.3, 15% (v/v) 1,4-dioxane, 25% (v/v) PEG 8K, and then in cryoprotect solution containing 0.1 M Tris pH 8.3, 15% (v/v) 1,4-dioxane, 30% (v/v) PEG 8K. Loop the crystals again and freeze the crystals mounted on the loops in liquid nitrogen.\nThe frozen crystals are shipped to Beamline 31D at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Use of the Lilly Research Laboratories Collaborative Access Team (LRL-CAT) beamline at Sector 31 of the Advanced Photon Source was provided by Eli Lilly Company, which operates the facility.\nThe datasets were indexed and integrated using Mosflm (Battye et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and Scala (Evans, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",
    "The structure of RhoAWT and RhoAG14V in complex with GDP were determined by the molecular replacement method with the program Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) using a searching model based on the structure of RhoA-GDP (PDB: 1FTN), and the structure of RhoAWT in complex with GMPPNP was determined using a searching model based on the structure of constitutively active RhoA (PDB: 1KMQ).\nRefinement was performed using Phenix (Liebschner et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and models were built with Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) in alternative rounds.\nFinal models and scaled reflection data were deposited to the PDB (rcsb.org[href=http://rcsb.org])\nNote: GDP or GMPPNP was added to the crystallization samples after purification to a final concentration of 5 mM (∼10× of RhoA proteins).\nGST-Rhotekin-RBD pull-down\nTiming: 2–3 days\nDetect the interaction between RhoA and its effector Rhotekin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/661-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Procedure of GST-Rhotekin-RBD pull-down of RhoA and mutants\nThe pull-down reactions are done with both GDP-bound and GMPPNP-bound RhoA proteins.\nPrepare the GST pull-down buffer. Make some GST pull-down buffer supplemented with 10 μM GDP or appropriate GTP analogs. Make just enough amount as DTT is not stable and buffer should be freshly made for every experiment.\n10 μL GSH-agarose beads (20 μL 50% v/v slurry) are needed for each pull-down. Take the beads and wash 3 times with 1 mL GST pull-down buffer.\nCritical: after spinning, carefully remove the wash supernatant with a pipette at an angle to not lose any beads during the wash step.\nAdd 20 μg of the GST-Rhotekin-RBD protein to the 10 μL GSH-agarose beads. Rotate at 4°C for 30 min. Then wash with 1 mL GST pull-down buffer 3 times.",
    "Optional: The GST-Rhotekin-RBD beads can be prepared in one tube for all pull-down reactions in one experiment, then be aliquoted to individual tubes before adding RhoA. The loading of GST-Rhotekin-RBD will be more even in this way.\nWash the beads in each tube with GST pull-down buffer containing either GDP or GTP analog.\nDilute the RhoA samples in both GDP-bound or GTP analog-bound forms to ∼1 mg/mL. Carefully quantify the samples using Bradford assay.\nAdd 5 μg of each RhoA sample to the beads, rotate at 4°C for 1 h in 100 μL GST pull-down buffer containing GDP or GTP analog.\nPause Point: The beads can be kept in rotation at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nWash the beads 2 times with 1 mL GST pull-down buffer containing GDP or GTP analog.\nAdd 20 μL 4× SDS Sample buffer, boil at 95°C for 5 min. Load all the supernatant to 15% SDS-PAGE gel and subject to subsequent anti-RhoA Western Blot analysis (RhoA antibody dilution 1:2000) to detect the RhoA and mutant proteins being pulled-down. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]\nNote: Compared with precasted 4%–15% gradient gels, 15% SDS-PAGE gels give a sharper band for RhoA protein.\nMST binding assay\nTiming: 2–3 days\nMeasure the binding affinity of the interaction between RhoA and Rhotekin-RBD using the microscale thermophoresis (MST), which is an effective technique to quantify biomolecular interactions (Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/661-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Characterization of the Interaction between RhoA and Rhotekin-RBD by MST\nGDP-bound or GMPPNP-bound RhoA proteins are labeled and Rhotekin-RBD is titrated. Data are presented as mean ± SD.",
    "Critical: Before you start, compare the Monolith systems to find the suitable one. Monolith NT.115 gives the most flexibility when it comes to labeling strategy with multiple fluorescent channels, while Monolith NT. Labelfree can measure interactions by detecting the intrinsic fluorescence of your target protein. The label-free option is ideal to characterize interactions under native conditions. However, it requires the other binding partner to have no absorbance at the UV wavelength, making it unsuitable for most protein-protein interactions. For Monolith NT.115, it is important to keep in mind that labeling may interfere with the binding and result in reduced apparent affinity.\nNote: To use the NT.115 model, one binding partner will require a fluorophore label. For protein-protein interactions, NT-647 (RED) dye carrying a reactive NHS-ester group that reacts with primary amines (lysine residues) or a reactive maleimide group that reacts with cysteine residues is often used. Before the experiment, make sure that the concentration of the unlabeled partner is high enough to reach a final concentration at least 10-fold, ideally more above the expected dissociation constant (KD). In this case, labeling RhoA protein at the cysteine residues works well.\nPrepare labeled RhoA proteins using Monolith Protein Labeling Kit RED-MALEIMIDE (Cysteine Reactive) (NanoTemper technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol provided in the kit (not available online). Here is a brief description:\nTake 20 μM, 100 μL of the RhoA protein to be labeled. Exchange the sample into the labeling buffer using column A. (Both labeling buffer and column A are provided in the kit)\nNote: This step can be skipped if your sample is in a suitable buffer (such as HEPES, PBS, Na-Ac) with no imidazole, DTT or β-ME. Buffer exchange using column A is always recommended.",
    "Dissolve the dye in 30 μL DMSO, vortex to mix well. The resulting dye is 470 μM. Dilute the dye to 2-3 fold of the protein concentration using the labeling buffer.\nMix 100 μL of protein and 100 μL of the diluted dye. Incubate for 30 min at 25°C in dark.\nGet rid of the extra dye using column B with MST sample storage buffer (column B is provided in the kit).\nCalculate the concentration of the protein and the dye using Nanodrop to measure the absorption at 280 nm for protein and 650 nm for the dye. The molar absorbance of the dye is 250,000 M-1cm-1. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]\nAliquot into PCR tubes, freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C.\nCritical: Use only highly purified protein samples for labeling.\nNote: Make sure you do not have too little or too much fluorescence intensity. If the florescence intensities of the labeled protein do not match by a factor of 2-3 of the free dye at the same concentration, then the labeling efficiency is low or protein/sample concentration is not in the expected range. Too much florescence may indicate over-labeling or the presence of free dye. Free dye would strongly reduce the signal to noise ratio.\nAssay setup pretest: before you start, make sure that you are using the optimal concentration of the labeled molecule, the correct capillary type and a buffer composition in which your sample is homogeneous.\nFluorescence check\nFill the labeled protein in a standard capillary and start the “capillary scan” with 50% LED power.\nMake sure the reading is between 200–1500 fluorescence counts. To achieve this, sample concentration can be adjusted, or the LED power can be varied between 15% and 95%.\nChoose a concentration of the labeled molecule to achieve optimal fluorescence counts.\nCapillary Check",
    "Prepare the labeled molecules at the concentration determined. Fill 4 standard treated capillaries, 4 hydrophilic capillaries, and 4 hydrophobic capillaries.\nPick the capillary that gives symmetrical fluorescence peak.\nSample quality\nPrepare the labeled sample in the MST binding buffer. Fill at least 4 capillaries.\nPerform the “Capillaries Scan” with the predetermined setting and measure the samples at 40% MST power. The data should have a noise of 4 units or less.\nMonitor for signs of aggregation. Optimize buffer if aggregation is observed. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]\nMST binding experiment: Setting up the MST experiment with fixed concentration of the fluorescent-labeled molecule, titrated with the unlabeled molecule.\nPrepare 16 small micro reaction tubes. Label them from 1 to 16.\nFill 20 μL of the highest concentration of the unlabeled molecule in the first tube 1.\nFill 10 μL of the MST binding buffer in the tube 2–16.\nTransfer 10 μL of tube 1 to tube 2, mix very well by pipetting up and down several times.\nRepeat above step 14 times to get a serial dilution, remove 10 μL from tube 15 after mixing. Tube 16 is the buffer control.\nMix 10 μL of the fluorescent-labeled molecule at double the concentrated determined with the 10 μL titrated samples, mix well by pipetting up and down several times.\nIncubate at 25°C for 30 min, fill the capillaries, and measure the samples with 20%, 40%, and 80% MST power.\nCritical: The buffer in tube 1 and the buffer in tubes 2–16 must be the same to avoid any dilution effects.\nNote: Prepare at least 20 μL of sample and use the small micro reaction tubes provided in the capillary kit to minimize influence of evaporation, losing samples to the plastic reaction tubes, or pipetting errors.\nData analysis\nStart Affinity Analysis Software and load raw data.",
    "Check the “Original Fluorescence” and make sure there is no concentration dependent fluorescence changes. Typically, the intensity should no vary more than 10%. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.15]\nCheck the signal/noise ratio at different MST powers. Use the lowest possible MST power for the analysis, which gives a good signal to noise ratio.\nThe standard analysis mode is “Thermophoresis” or “Thermophoresis with Jump”. If more than one setting shows a result, they should yield similar affinity. The KD can be determined using the KD fit with the default setting.\nData can be exported and loaded to GraphPad Prism for binding analysis if preferred.\nNucleotide dissociation assay\nTiming: 4 h\nCompare the nucleotide dissociation rate among WT and mutant RhoA proteins (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). This protocol is modified based on a previous protocol (Kanie and Jackson, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/661-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Procedure of the nucleotide dissociation and association assays\nBODIPY-FL-GDP and BODIPY-FL-GTPγS are used for the dissociation and the association assays, respectively. These fluorescent analogs show increased fluorescence when bound to proteins. Data are presented as mean ± SD.\nLoad BODIPY-FL-GDP to RhoA proteins\nFor each dissociation sample, prepare 2 μM RhoA proteins and 1 μM BODIPY-FL-GDP in the BODIPY-FL-GDP loading buffer (containing 1 mM EDTA). Make the final volume to be 95 μL. Incubate at 25°C for 2 h.\nAdd 5 μL of 100 mM MgCl2 to each sample to terminate the exchange.\nAdd 100 μL Nucleotide dissociation assay buffer (containing 5 mM MgCl2). Final concentration of RhoA is 1 μM.\nCritical: EDTA is required for efficient BODIPY-FL-GDP loading. After loading, excess Mg2+ is required to stabilize the bound nucleotide.\nNote: A control sample should be prepared in parallel without the protein component.\nAliquot 25 μL/well of BODIPY-FL-GDP loaded RhoA samples to 384-well plate. 6 wells total for each sample.",
    "Prepare 2 μM, 5 μM, and 10 μM GMPPNP in the following GMPPNP sample in the Nucleotide dissociation assay buffer. Aliquot the GMPPNP samples to 96-well plate. The RhoA/free GMPPNP ratio is a key factor that influence the nucleotide dissociation rate. We tested 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 RhoA : GMPPNP ratios in our study.\nOptional: GMPPNP can be prepared in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EDTA to test the dissociation rate in the presence of EDTA. Here, EDTA will have a similar effect as RhoGEFs in accelerating the nucleotide dissociation by chelating RhoA-bound Mg2+.\nBring the 384 plate with BODIPY-FL-GDP loaded RhoA samples and the 96-well plate with different concentration of GMPPNP to an Envision Multimode Plate Reader with excitation/emission wavelength of 485 and 535 nm. Read the 384 plate 3 times and take the average for the baseline fluorescence. The protein-free BODIPY-FL-GDP should be included as control. Troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.17]\nAdd 25 μL/well of GMPPNP at varying concentrations to the BODIPY-FL-GDP loaded RhoA samples using multichannel pipette, 2 wells for every GMPPNP concentration.
