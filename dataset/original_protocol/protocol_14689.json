    "All research protocols described have been reviewed by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was obtained from each patient before surgery and the study was approved by the University of Chicago IRB. A biological safety cabinet type 2 and gloves should be used when handling human tissue for protection and to reduce risk of contaminating cells.\n1. Isolation and Culture of Primary Untransformed Stromal Cells\nHuman tissue collection and preparation.\n\t\nObtain specimens of human omentum, 2 cm3, removed during an abdominal surgery, and immediately immerse tissue in RT phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Figure 2A). A piece of omentum 3 cm x 2 cm typically yields 1 million primary human mesothelial cells (HPMC) and 200,000 primary human fibroblasts or normal omental fibroblasts (NOF).\nSpin down the PBS the tissue was immersed in at 0.5 x g for 3 min as soon as possible after collection (< 2 hr in PBS) and transfer the tissue to fresh 20 ml PBS in a 50 ml conical tube. Cut up tissue into 5mm3 pieces by mincing with scalpels in a 15 cm diameter, sterile culture dish (Figure 2B).\nPrimary human mesothelial cell isolation8\nTo isolate HPMC, transfer the minced tissue into 50 ml conical tubes and wait 1 min for the solid pieces to float to the top (Figure 2C & D). HPMC and red blood cells (RBC) will be present in the liquid on the bottom. Use a pipet to remove the liquid from the bottom of the tube and into a new conical tube. Spin the liquid down at 0.5 x g for 3 min and aspirate the supernatant from the HPMC/RBC pellet.",
    "Repeat the process three times: add 20 ml PBS to the minced tissue, allow tissue to rise, remove liquid from the bottom with a pipette and into the HPMC/RBC tube, spin down, and remove the supernatant. After all spins are completed and the supernatant is aspirated, the pellet will contain HPMC and RBC.\nPlate all cells from the pellet into a 75 cm2 flask in 15 ml of full growth media (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS],1% MEM vitamins [93 mg/L], 1% MEM nonessential amino acids [81.4 mg/L], 1% penicillin streptomycin [Pen-Strep, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin]).\nPerform a secondary PBS wash to isolate additional HPMCs.\n\t\t\nFor the secondary PBS wash, shake the remaining solid tissue at 200 rpm, 37 °C for 10 min in 20 ml of PBS, then wait 1 min for the tissue to float to the top. Remove the liquid from the bottom of the tube into a new tube, centrifuge at 0.5 x g for 3 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nPlate all the HPMC/RBC from the secondary PBS wash in a separate 75 cm2 flask in 15 ml of full growth media.\nTo isolate any remaining HPMC, shake the minced tissue at 200 rpm, 37 °C degrees for 10 min in 20 ml of a 1:1 0.25% trypsin 25 mM EDTA:PBS solution by volume. Allow the tissue to rise, collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube into a new 50 ml tube, and spin down at 0.5 g x 3 min.\n\t\t\nAspirate the supernatant and plate all the HPMC/RBC in a separate 75 cm2 flask in 15 ml of full growth media.",
    "Culture the plated cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified environment. Feed plated cells by adding 15 ml of full growth media on days 3 and 5 without removing the spent media. HPMC can be cultured for 5-7 days before splitting.\n\t\t\nUse low-passage HPMC (up to passage 2) in all experiments to minimize dedifferentiation and modification of original phenotype. Use a wide-field microscope preferably with a 20x objective with plastic differential interference contrast capabilities or 4-20x objective with phase contrast capabilities (phase contrast filters on microscope) for taking all images of cells, and a 10x objective ()in bright field to analyze immunohistochemical 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining.\nConfirm that the HPMC are cuboidal and express cytokeratin 8 and vimentin by performing immunohistochemistry8 (Figure 3A, C, E).\nNOF isolation8\nPrepare 10 ml of a stock of collagenase type III solution (10x) by combining a 1:1:1 mixture of 100x Pen-Strep: 1,500 units activity/ml of collagenase type III: 714 units activity/ml of hyaluronidase in PBS.\nShake the minced omentum tissue that remains after HPMC isolation at 200 rpm, 37 °C for 6 hr in 10 ml of the 10x collagenase type III solution diluted in serum-free media (DMEM with 1% MEM vitamins [93 mg/L], 1% MEM nonessential amino acids [81.4 mg/L], 1% penicillin streptomycin [Pen-Strep, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin]). Digested tissue will look opaque and may have some fibrous debris (Figure 2E).\nCentrifuge the solution containing NOF cells in suspension at 0.5 x g for 3 min at RT, aspirate the supernatant and plate the pellet in a 75 cm2 flask in 13 ml of full growth media.",
    "Remove old media and replace with 15 ml of fresh full growth media after 24 hr. NOF can be cultured for 1-3 days before splitting. Note proliferation of the NOF will cease when the cells reach confluency.\nConfirm that the primary human fibroblasts are flat, elongated cells and express vimentin but not cytokeratin 8 by performing immunohistochemistry8 (Figure 3B, D, F). Use low-passage NOF for experiments (ideally before passage 3) to minimize dedifferentiation and modification of original phenotype. Use a wide-field microscope with a 20x objective with plastic DIC capabilities for taking all phase images of cells, and a 10x objective in bright field to analyze immunohistochemical DAB staining.\n2. Plating the Organotypic Culture8\nRelease NOF from the 75 cm culture flask by rinsing with 10 ml of PBS followed by 3 ml of 0.25% trypsin/25 mM EDTA for no more than 5 min. Neutralize trypsin with at least 3 times the volume of full growth media.\nTransfer trypsinized cells into a 50 ml conical tube and spin down at 0.5 g x 3 min. Remove supernatant and bring cells back up in 5 ml of full growth media. Use a cell counter to count the cells recovered from the culture flask.\nDilute cells in the appropriate volume of full growth media to plate 2,000-4,000 NOF per 100 µl onto a black, clear-bottomed, 96-well plate. Add 0.5 µg/100 µl of rat-tail collagen I to the cell mixture before plating. Let cells sit at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment for at least 4 hr, or until the cells to adhere to the plate surface.",
    "Release HPMC from the culture flask using the same methods described in steps 2.1 and 2.2. Dilute cells in the appropriate amount of full growth media to plate 10,000-20,000 HPMC per 50 µl on top of the NOF already plated with collagen I in 96-well plates. Let the cells sit at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment for at least 18 hr before beginning experiments.\nCulture green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells in full growth media. HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells are fluorescently labeled by expression of a lentiviral vector expressing copepod cGFP (pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1). HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells should be 80-90% confluent on the day of use (logarithmic growth phase). Release cells from the culture plate and count using the same methods described in steps 2.1-2.2 for primary cells.\nAllow ovarian cancer cells to recover in full growth media for 15-20 min at 37°C in a conical tube with the lid loosely sealed.\n3. Adhesion Assay8\nAfter recovery, pellet the ovarian cancer cells by spinning for 3 min at 0.5 x g and then remove the supernatant and dilute the cells in the appropriate volume of serum-free media to achieve a concentration of 50,000 cells/100 µl.\nInvert the 96-well plates with the HPMC/NOF organotypic cultures to remove spent media, and add 100 µl of the cancer cell suspension in serum-free media to each well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment for 30 min to 4 hr.\nInvert the 96-well plate to remove media and non-adherent cells. Use a multichannel pipet at low power to carefully and gently pipet 100 µl of PBS into each well, and invert plate again. Repeat the PBS wash once more.",
    "Invert to remove PBS and add 100 µl 4% paraformaldehyde to each well. Allow the plate to sit for 20 min to fix the cells. After 20 min, invert the plate and add 100 µl PBS.\nNote that the total fluorescence of wells can be reported or the number of cells can be quantified. For quantification, first plate a standard curve in duplicate using HeyA8 cells at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml.\n\t\nMake the standard curve by spinning down 1 million cells, removing media, and allowing them to sit in 1 ml 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min.\nSpin cells again and bring up in 1 ml PBS (recount cells to confirm 1 million/ml concentration). Plate 50,000, 40,000, 30,000, 20,000, 10,000, 5000, 1,000, and 0 cells into each well in duplicate, and add PBS for a final total volume of 50 µl in each well.\nBottom read the culture plate on a fluorescent plate reader (excitation = 488 nm, emission = 528 nm), scaling high wells (50,000 on standard curve). Use the standard curve to calculate how many ovarian cancer cells adhered to the organotypic culture in each well (Figure 4A-C).\n4. Proliferation Assay10\nAfter the ovarian cancer cells recover (see steps 2.5 and 2.6 above), pellet the cells by spinning for 3 min at 0.5 x g and then dilute the cells in the appropriate volume of 1% FBS media (DMEM with 1% FBS, 1% MEM vitamins [93 mg/L], 1% MEM nonessential amino acids [81.4 mg/L], 1% penicillin streptomycin [Pen-Strep, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin]) to achieve a concentration of 4,000 cells/150 µl.",
    "Invert the 96-well plate with the HPMC/NOF organotypic cultures to remove spent media, and add 150 µl of the cancer cell suspension in 1% FBS media to each well. Incubate the plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment for 72 hr.\nBottom read the culture plate on a fluorescent plate reader once a day (excitation = 488 nm, emission = 528 nm) to evaluate the relative proliferation of cells. Continue the assay for 96 hr, changing the media at 48 hr (Figure 5A-C). Be careful not to disturb the culture when changing media (inverting the plate is preferable).\n5. Invasion Assay8\nBefore plating the 3D culture, add 7.5 µg rat-tail collagen I in 200 µl PBS to a 24-well culture plate insert (8 µm pore size). Let the plate incubate O/N, then carefully remove the PBS with a pipet immediately before plating the HPMC/NOF organotypic culture onto the collagen-coated inserts (step 2, above).\nPrepare the ovarian cancer cells as in step 3.1. To plate the ovarian cancer cells onto the organotypic cultures on the inserts, carefully use a pipet to remove excess media from the top of the inserts. Add 100 µl of the ovarian cancer cell suspension in serum-free media to each well.\nAdd 750 µl of full growth media into the well below the insert to induce cancer cell invasion into the organotypic cultures. Incubate the plate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment for 24 hr.\n\tNote: Ovarian cancer cells that invade the organotypic culture will cross the insert and remain on the bottom side of the insert.",
    "After 24 hr, grasp the insert with tongs and briefly rinse it in a beaker of PBS, then move the insert into an empty well. Scrub the top of each insert with both sides of a cotton swab for a total of 1 min. Quickly place the insert into a plate containing 750 µl 4% paraformaldehyde in each well. Allow each insert to sit in paraformaldehyde for 10 min before transferring the inserts into wells filled with 750 µl PBS.\nView the invaded cells (adhered and fixed to the bottom of inserts) with a microscope at 2.5x magnification. When the entire well is within the field of view, adjust the magnification to 10x and take 5 pictures, one near the center and 1 in each quadrant of the well, avoiding taking images that are too close to the edges. Follow the same pattern for each well.\nUse the manufacturer's program to count the number of cells in each image to get an average number of cells invaded per field in each well (Figure 6A-C) according to their protocol.\nSubscription Required.
