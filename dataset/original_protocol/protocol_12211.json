    "All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Netherlands Experiments on Animals Act.\nNOTE: The submerged filter paper sandwich method is modified from 1.\n1. Submerged Filter Paper Sandwich Preparation\nPannett-Compton (PC)-saline27,28\nPrepare stock solutions A (1 L of ultrapure H2O, 121 g of NaCl, 15.5 g of KCl, 10.42 g of CaCl2·H2O, and 12.7 g of MgCl2·6H2O) and B (1 L of ultrapure H2O, 2.365 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 0.188 g of NaH2PO4·2H2O) in clean 1-L bottles. Store them at 4 °C.\nPrepare 1 L of PC-saline by mixing 900 ml of ultrapure H2O with 40 ml of stock solution A and 60 ml of stock solution B (in this order to avoid precipitation). Prepare PC-saline freshly from stock solutions A and B every week.\n\t\tNOTE: Stock solutions can be stored at 4 °C for several months. Autoclaving and/or adding antibiotics or antimycotics are not necessary.\nIncubation of fertilized chicken eggs\n\t\nIn a humidified incubator, lay the eggs on their side and incubate them at 37.5 °C until they reach the desired age.\n\t\tNOTE: Store eggs no longer than two weeks (preferably at 12 - 15 °C) prior to the experiment, as the hatchability will decline significantly\nFilter paper carriers (adapted from 1)\n\t\nIf available, use a laser cutting machine to cut hourglass-shaped filter paper carriers from thick filtration paper (28 mm x 22 mm). Taper the width in the middle from 22 mm to 10.4 mm. Cut out a central elliptical aperture (10.6 mm x 5.5 mm), with the longer axis of the ellipse orientated parallel to the larger side of the filter paper carrier (Figure 1-M).",
    "Optionally, prepare a cardboard stencil with the correct dimensions and transfer its outline and that of the central aperture to thick filtration paper using a pencil. Cut out the filter paper carrier using fine scissors.\nCut two identical filter paper carriers for each embryo to be explanted. Prepare extra filter paper carriers as backup in case an embryo gets lost during explanting.\nTemperature-controlled oil bath (on the day of the experiment)\n\t\nPlace the temperature-controlled beaker in the center of the motorized x-y-stage of the upright zoom microscope and connect the beaker to its temperature controller.\nPut four large stainless steel rings (30 mm outer diameter, 4 mm in height, 1.5 mm wall thickness) into a 6 cm Petri dish to act as weights and place the dish in the middle of the temperature-controlled beaker.\n\t\tNOTE: This Petri dish just serves as a placeholder to adjust the oil level.\nFill the temperature-controlled beaker with 130 ml of light mineral oil. Adjust the oil level if necessary so that it ends about 3 mm below the upper edge of the 6 cm Petri dish.\nRemove the 6 cm Petri dish from the temperature-controlled beaker and set the temperature to 40 °C.\n2. Submerged Filter Paper Sandwich Production\nCulture medium (on the day of the experiment)\n\t\nPour 30 ml of PC-saline (as prepared in steps 1.1.1 to 1.1.2) into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Prepare one 50 ml centrifuge tube filled with 30 ml of PC-saline for every two embryos to be explanted.\nCarefully crack a non-incubated egg into a 10 cm Petri dish.",
    "Harvest thin albumen by moving a plastic transfer pipette along the walls of the Petri dish and sucking in the thin albumen. Collect 30 ml thin albumen in a 50 ml centrifuge tube for each two embryos to be explanted. Make sure to obtain only the thin albumen.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually 3 - 4 eggs allow the harvest of about 30 ml of thin albumen.\nPour 20 ml of thin albumen into every PC-saline filled 50 ml centrifuge tube (as prepared in step 2.1.1).\nMix the PC-saline with the thin albumen by gently inverting the tubes several times. Let it settle for several minutes and check if the mixture, called culture medium from here onwards, is clear. If the culture medium is not clear, prepare fresh PC-saline from the stock solution and harvest fresh thin albumen.\nPlace two small stainless steel rings (20 mm outer diameter, 4 mm in height, 1.5 mm wall thickness, 6.5 mm gap in the ring) as far apart as possible in a fresh 6 cm plastic Petri dish and fill it with 22 ml of culture medium (as prepared in steps 1.4.1 to 1.4.4) using a 25 ml plastic pipette (Figure 1-H). Make sure that debris accumulated on top of the medium remains in the centrifuge tube.\nRemove any debris or bubbles from the medium using a plastic transfer pipette.\nFill a 10 cm Petri dish with 75 ml of PC-saline (to be used in step 2.15).\nRemove an egg from the incubator and let it rest on the bench on its side for 1 min to let the embryo come to the top of the yolk.",
    "Carefully crack the egg into a Petri dish (Figure 1-A). Soak the edge of a piece of fine tissue paper in the thick albumen and center the blastoderm by pulling, if necessary.\nRemove most of the thin and thick albumen from the Petri dish using a plastic transfer pipette (with the tip cut off to facilitate the uptake of the thick albumen).\nCreate a window in the thick albumen around the embryo by gently wiping away the thick albumen with a piece of tissue paper, moving away from the center (Figure 1-B). Prevent the tissue paper from attaching to the vitelline membrane.\nUsing tweezers, carefully place a filter paper carrier on the vitelline membrane around the embryo, with the longer axis of the elliptical aperture parallel to the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (Figure 1-C).\nPinch one tip of the nail scissors through the vitelline membrane close to the filter paper carrier and quickly cut around the whole filter paper carrier (Figure 1-D).\nUsing tweezers, lift the filter paper carrier away from the yolk in an oblique direction parallel to the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (Figure 1-E).\nTurn the filter paper carrier around to have the ventral side of the embryo on top and submerge it in the PC-saline. Immerse the filter paper carrier along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo in an oblique direction.\nGet rid of all the yolk still attached the vitelline membrane and the blastoderm by gently flushing it with PC-saline from a plastic transfer pipette. Keep the entirety of the filter paper carrier submerged at all times (Figure 1-F).",
    "Remove the filter paper carrier from the PC-saline along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo in an oblique direction and get rid of the excess liquid by dabbing the edge of the filter paper carrier on a tissue paper.\nHold the filter paper horizontally, with the ventral side of the embryo facing up, and place another filter paper carrier on top of the first one, using a second pair of tweezers. Their apertures should match exactly, thereby sandwiching the embryo between the two layers of filter paper (Figure 1-G).\nImmediately submerge the filter paper carrier sandwich into the culture medium in an oblique direction along the anterior-posterior-axis of the embryo. Place it in the area spanning the space between the two steel rings (Figure 1-H).\nFix the filter paper sandwich by placing two more steel rings on top of the other two, making sure that the aperture with the embryo remains completely uncovered (Figure 1-I).\nCheck the medium level and make sure that the upper spacer is just submerged in the medium. If necessary, add or remove small amounts of medium.\nCarefully place the Petri dish in the center of the temperature-controlled oil bath and stabilize the dish laterally by placing three large stainless steel rings (30 mm outer diameter, 4 mm in height, 1.5 mm wall thickness) next to the dish in the oil. Make sure that the steel rings touch the sides of the dish (Figure 1-J).\nSlowly pipette approximately 6 ml of light mineral oil on top of the medium with a plastic transfer pipette, so that the medium is covered with a continuous layer of mineral oil (Figure 1-K).\nSet up the time-lapse acquisition.",
    "NOTE: Imaging the embryos as horizontal panoramas of five overlapping sub-images (tiles) allows detailed imaging (5X objective), with a general overview of the morphology29-30. Imaging intervals between 3 and 10 min allow for the detailed tracking of morphological changes31, and the acquisition of small z-stacks (five to seven different planes with a distance of 30 µm) compensates for much of the thickening and turning of the embryo30. Z-planes with the highest contrast can be selected before further processing32 of single frames into time-lapse movies (see the Representative Results section for detailed information on image acquisition).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54636/54636fig1.jpg",
