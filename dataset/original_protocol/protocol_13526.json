    "All experimental protocols were approved by the Lincoln University Animal Ethics committee and are in line with the US National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals in research and the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act (1999). Borderdale sheep were diagnosed at birth14 and maintained at Lincoln University research farms. Three 3-month-old homozygous (CLN5-/-) ewes received a single IVT injection to the left eye, with the untreated right eye acting as an internal control. Electroretinography and pathology data were compared to historical healthy and affected control data. The viral vector used in this study was a self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 9, containing the chicken beta action (CBh) promoter and codon-optimized ovine CLN5 (scAAV9/CBh-oCLN5opt). The viral vector was provided by the University of North Carolina Vector Core, NC, USA.\n1. Presurgery\nAutoclave the surgical kit (Figure 1).\nFast the sheep for 24 h before the surgery.\nRecord live weights prior to surgery.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63823/63823fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Intravitreal surgery kit. Instruments required for IVT surgery include (1) a speculum to hold the eyelids open and (2) a pair of curved-nose forceps to grasp the bulbar conjunctiva and rotate the eye. (3) A straight nose hemostat is also included as an alternative instrument to grip the bulbar conjunctiva and hold the eye in place if it has rolled back into the eye orbit. This kit is autoclaved prior to surgery. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63823/63823fig01large.jpg]\n2. Surgical procedure\nRestrain the animal and, using electronic clippers, shave the wool from one side of the neck over the jugular vein.\nOcclude the jugular vein by applying pressure at the base of the jugular groove and visualize the raised vein.",
    "Draw up the appropriate amount of diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) and ketamine (7.5 mg/kg) into a sterile syringe and attach a sterile 20 G needle. Insert the needle into the jugular vein and gently draw back on the plunger to ensure blood enters the hub and the needle is inside the vein. Once confirmed, induce through intravenous (jugular) administration.\nImmediately after induction, place the animal in dorsal recumbency, extend the neck, and hold the tongue up and forward, using a laryngoscope to visualize the larynx. Perform endotracheal intubation by gently inserting an endotracheal tube (size 6.0-9.0 depending on the size of the sheep) between the vocal cords when the animal exhales. Inflate the endotracheal cuff immediately and secure the tube with a tie around the lower jaw. Confirm air flow through the tube.\nTransfer the sheep to the surgical table and place it in lateral recumbency.\nImmediately connect the endotracheal tube to the hoses of the anesthetic machine for delivery of isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Initially commence with 3%-4% isoflurane and then reduce to 2%-3% for maintenance. Observe the spontaneous ventilation of the sheep.\nMonitor heart (pulse) rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2 levels, and rectal body temperature throughout the procedure. See Table 1 for physiological values for these parameters in anesthetized sheep (variable, but use as guidance).\nPlace a large, sterile, square drape on a surgical operating cart, followed by the sterile instruments.\nPosition a sterile, fenestrated surgical drape over the eye to be injected.\nAseptically disinfect the eye using a sterile 20 mL syringe to irrigate the eye with 1-5% povidone-iodine solution.\nApply 1-2 drops Alcaine 0.5% W/V ophthalmic solution, as a local anesthetic, to the eye.\nFit a Nopa Barraquer-Colibri eye speculum (10 mm) to the eyelids to hold the eye open.",
    "Grasp the bulbar conjunctiva on the dorsolateral aspect of the eye with forceps, and rotate the eye globe ventromedially.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n,Conscious,Anesthetized,Recommended critical intervention point\nHeart rate (beats/min),50-80 (rest) to 280 (active),50-80,\"<50, >100\"\nRespiratory rate (breaths/min),15-40 (rest) to 350 (overheated),10-30,\"<8, >40\"\nOxygen saturation (mm Hg),95-100,98-100,<90\nEnd-tidal CO2 (mm Hg),35-45,35-45,>55\nBody temperature (˚C),38.5-39.5,38.5-39.5,\"<36, >40\"\nTable 1: Physiological values of parameters to be monitored in anesthetized sheep.\n3. Viral preparation\nStore AAV vector aliquots at −80 ˚C until use.\nOn the day of surgery, thaw the required number of vials for IVT delivery on ice.\nImmediately prior to administration, vortex the viral vector aliquot and centrifuge at 400 × g for 10 s to collect the contents.\nDilute each viral vector aliquot in sterile-filtered 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the desired dose in a final volume of 100 µL. Prepare vector dilutions in a sterile 1.5 mL low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tube using sterile filter pipette tips. Dispose of all consumables that have been in contact with the viral vector in disinfectant solution (see the Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: In the original publication15 the dose of the therapeutic agent (AAV9.CLN5) was 1.9 x 1010 viral genomes. The recommended dosage will vary depending on the therapeutic agent being administered; therefore, a dosage has not been included in the standard protocol presented here.\nDraw the full 100 µL of the AAV vector preparation into a sterile, low-dead space 1 mL syringe with a permanently attached 28 G x 1/2 in needle for immediate injection. Ensure the length of time from preparation to injection is less than 2 min.\n4. Viral administration",
    "Insert the needle approximately 7 mm posterior to the sclera on the lateral aspect of the eye and angled posteriorly to avoid the lens (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Administer the single injection of 100 µL as a bolus as close to the retina as possible without disturbing the retinal surface.\nRinse the eye with approximately 10-15 mL of 1-5% povidone-iodine solution followed by 10 mL of saline before removal of the speculum and drape.\nTurn the sheep over and repeat with the other eye if required.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63823/63823fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Ventromedial rotation of the eye globe. (A) Grasp the bulbar conjunctiva with nontoothed forceps and (B) rotate ventromedially (i.e., down and towards the snout) to expose the dorsolateral surface of the eye for injection.

The needle is injected on the dorsolateral aspect of the eye globe, and the full length of the needle shaft (0.5 in/12.7 mm) is inserted into the eye. Note the angle of the needle toward the posterior of the eye to avoid the lens and inject as close to the retina as possible.

Postoperative management\nOn completion of the procedure, stop isoflurane gas inhalation anesthesia, flush the line with 100% oxygen, disconnect the hose from the endotracheal tube, and transfer the sheep to the recovery room.\nPlace the sheep in sternal recumbency, with legs tucked underneath, and monitor until full recovery. Ensure the animal's mouth is clear of any obstructions.\nWhen the swallowing reflex is observed, partially deflate the cuff of the endotracheal tube and gently remove the tube from the mouth.",
    "Administer an intramuscular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory into the biceps femoris muscle of the hind limb, subcutaneous antibiotics on the side of the neck or behind the shoulder, and 0.5% chloramphenicol eye drops to the surface of the eye globe.\nProvide water and food (lucerne pellets and chaff) once the sheep can stand unassisted.\nAdminister 0.5% chloramphenicol eye drops 2-3 per day for 7 days post surgery.\nKeep the sheep indoors overnight before returning to the outdoor paddock approximately 24 h post surgery.\nRecord rectal temperatures daily for 3 weeks. Monitor for any changes in pulse or respiratory rate, food consumption, neurobehavior, body temperature, weight, posture, eye health, and clinical signs of ill-health. Seek appropriate veterinary treatment if there are any indications of adverse events.\n6. Assessing efficacy in vivo\nIf the goal of the IVT injection is to preserve vision, monitor efficacy in vivo by methods such as maze testing or electroretinography (ERG) to assess retinal cell function or optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal structure.\n\t​NOTE: These efficacy measures have been well described following IVT gene therapy11,15,16.\n7. Postmortem tissue analysis\nPerform sheep euthanasia by an approved method at an appropriate endpoint following intravitreal injection surgery.\n\tNOTE: Suggested euthanasia methods, such as intravenous veterinary euthanasia drugs or a penetrating captive bolt to the cervical spine followed by rapid exsanguination, are detailed elsewhere15,16.\nHarvest sheep eye globes using surgical sharp/blunt curved scissors. Cut the lateral and medial canthus to increase the eye socket opening and then systematically cut through the conjunctival folds, connective tissue, muscles, and optic nerve to free the eye globe from the socket.",
    "Immersion-fix intact, enucleated eye globes in 10% formalin for 2 h, followed by postfixation in Bouin's solution for 4 h, making a small (0.5 cm) cut in the sclera to allow sufficient perfusion. Alternatively, immersion-fix the eye globes in Davidson's solution for 48 h.\nProcess sections of eye tissue via routine paraffin wax embedding and sectioning at 3-5 µm.\n\tNOTE: Staining procedures for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical analysis have been described previously15,16.\nAssess the efficacy in postmortem tissue by measures such as total retinal thickness, retinal layer thickness, counts of outer nuclear layer cellular rows, and immunohistochemical staining for retinal cell types, retinal glia, or proteins of interest.\n\tNOTE: For protocols for these analyses, see previous publications15,16.\nSubscription Required.
