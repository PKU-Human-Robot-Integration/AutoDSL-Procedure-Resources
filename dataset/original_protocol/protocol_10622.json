    "1. 4D Time-lapse Imaging Experiments\nThe settings used for image acquisition will differ depending on the equipment used. The ability of confocal microscopy to optically section a sample depends on a number of factors: the wavelength of excitation, pinhole size, numerical aperture of the objective, the refractive index of the sample and the medium in which the sample is embedded. The size of the confocal pinhole selected will determine the thickness of the optical section collected. A smaller pinhole will produce a thinner optical section increasing the z-axis resolution but reducing the amount of light captured. A larger pinhole will increase the thickness of the optical section, reducing z-axis resolution but increasing the amount of light captured.\nAdditional factors to consider during collection of 4D data prior to correction include:\nOptimize scanning speed to remove, or limit, drift during the capture of a single time-point. Therefore the time taken for the image collection should be a small fraction of the interval between time-points.\nPerfectly repeating structures, or grids, are not suitable as structures for registration as it is not possible to determine the required correction. Randomly distributed beads or uneven structures will allow unambiguous registration.\nIf drift is expected, increase the scanning area and upper and lower focus limits in order to ensure the area of interest remains within the image stack.\nIn addition to ensuring there is appropriate spatial resolution to resolve the structures of interest, set the sampling rate to provide temporal resolution for the dynamic events being studied.\n\tNote: The time between image time-points should therefore be at least half the time-interval between regular repeating events and decrease for irregular events.\n2. Opening the Confocal Dataset",
    "The open source package Fiji is a distribution of the ImageJ program, which contains pre-installed plug-ins to perform numerous processes on data collected from microscopy experiments. The software provides easier plug-in update architecture and includes a copy of the Correct 3D drift plug-in used for this protocol. The software supports the import of a vast array of proprietary microscopy image formats through the use of the Open Microscopy Environment’s Bio-Formats import plug-in.\nInstall the Fiji program (http://fiji.sc/Downloads).\nLoad the acquired dataset using the LOCI Bio-Formats Importer plugin.\nIf the dataset is larger than the memory allocated to the program, select the \"Use virtual stack option\" within the Memory management section.\n3. Correcting Drift of a 3D Object in Post Processing\nDuring the course of an extended time-lapse experiment a sample may move even when embedded. To correct any movement and to allow the migration events imaged to be analyzed, post processing of images can be performed. All image post processing must be clearly described in the methodology of any analysis derived from this work.\nOnce the dataset has loaded, run the Correct 3D drift plugin.\nIf there are multiple image channels, select the channel to be used to register the images. This should ideally represent a static structure within the sample rather than any migratory or mobile elements. However, if this is not possible the channel with the least movement should be chosen.\nIf the available RAM on the system used for this analysis is less than twice the size of the original dataset, select the use virtual stack option. This will store the registered hyperstack as an image sequence, rather than saving the file to RAM.",
    "Select a folder for the plug-in to output individual corrected images files. A separate image file will be created for each channel at each z position.\nThe plugin will then conduct a pair-wise phase correlation analysis between each time-point to determine the required correction which is then applied to the dataset.\nSubscription Required.
