The wells should be about 90% confluent after 18–24 h incubation.\nDay 1.\nCulture an appropriate number of cells (minimum 2.4 × 106 cells) for your experiment. Refer to the “Subculture protocol for MRC-5 cells” described in the earlier section for more information.\nSeed MRC-5 cells in Seahorse XF 24-well plates 24 h before the optimization test or study protocol.\nDilute cells to 2 × 105 cells/mL using the EMEM GM.\nAdd 500 μL of cell suspension into each well, amounting to 1 × 105 cells/well.\nTap the sides of the plate gently and let the cells attach in 37°C, 5% CO2 for 18–24 h.\nDay 2.\nCheck viability of cells prior to the start of the experiment. The cells can be visualized using a conventional light microscope.\nEnsure a confluent (>90%) monolayer of cells have been formed. There should be minimal well to well variability as this will affect the quality of your results.\nThe cells are now ready for the optimization or test protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1548-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mitochondrial respiration profile for MRC-5 cells\nDifferent numbers of MRC-5 cells are subjected to the mitochondrial stress test. Results show that a minimum of 5 × 104 cells are required for OCR signals to be detected. Data are displayed as mean ± SD.",
    "Critical: Different cell types have different metabolic activity. If the XF analysis is performed for another cell type, we strongly recommend optimizing the cell numbers by doing an XF analysis on different cell counts. We find that in most cases, using 1 x 105 cells gave the most robust signal. An example of different MRC-5 cell numbers on the mitochondria stress profile is provided (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Note that a minimum of 5 × 104 cells are required for OCR signals to be detected, which is the reason why we have chosen to use 1 × 105 MRC-5 cells for XF analysis.\nNote: We have also optimized the cell densities for A549 and HEK293 cells, where 1 × 105 cells are suitable for XF analysis.\nNote: We have used the 24-well plates for all our experiments as we are able to obtain consistent and reproducible read-outs in our experimental replicates. However, if you want to perform these experiments on a 96-well format, you will have to adapt the volumes and cell numbers accordingly (van der Windt et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Users may also refer to the Agilent website at https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay] for more details.\nNote: If you need to perform pre-treatment of cells before virus infection, you may incubate the chemical or drug with the cells during or after cell seeding.\nVirus infection assay protocol on XF cell culture plates\nTiming: 2 days\nAfter cell seeding and incubation for 18–24 h, the cells are now ready to be infected. This protocol describes the steps involved in infecting MRC-5 cells seeded on 24-well XF Cell Culture Microplate.\nThaw the viruses in a water bath at 37°C and dilute the viruses to the MOI 1.0 using EMEM maintenance media (MM). Keep the virus on ice when not in use.",
    "We recommend 4 replicates for each experimental condition, including negative controls and at least one blank well containing only media. The negative controls should be composed of cells without virus and drug treatment. One plate hence allows testing of up to 6 different experimental conditions.\nDilute viruses to 1 × 107 pfu/mL with EMEM MM.\nInfect MRC-5 at MOI 1.\nRemove 350 μL of EMEM GM and add 100 μL of pre-diluted virus into each well.\nAllow infection to proceed for 1 h in 37°C incubator, 5% CO2. Rock the plate once every 15 min.\nAfter 1 h, remove the virus using serial dilution. This is to prevent the well from drying.\nAdd 250 μL of EMEM MM into each well.\nRemove 400 μL of media and replace with a similar volume. Repeat this step 3 times.\nIncubate the infected cells for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 48 h, proceed with the extracellular flux analysis (either mitochondrial stress test or glycolytic stress test).\nNote: Ensure that the viruses are taken out of the water bath immediately after thawing to prevent virus inactivation.\nNote: It is important to optimize the multiplicity of infection and the duration of infection to ensure that there are no extensive cytopathic effects during the day of XF analysis. For MRC-5, extensive cytopathic effects were noted at 65–72 hours post infection.\nNote: We recommend having at least 4 biological replicates for each experimental condition, although it is theoretically possible to perform them in triplicates. In addition, a negative control without virus and drug treatment should be included, so that we can compare the metabolism profiles between the infected and uninfected conditions. At least one blank well containing only media will also be needed to determine the background signal.",
    "Note: Media should be added or removed carefully to prevent dislodging the adherent cells. We recommend adding or removing media by placing the pipette tip at the side of the walls to reduce turbulence.\nNote: The duration of infection may vary depending on the virus and cell types used. Ensure that the cytopathic effects are not visible during the assessment of extracellular flux, as reduced cell numbers can affect the results and interpretation of the extracellular flux analysis.\nExtracellular flux analysis to monitor mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate\nTiming: 2 days\nTiming: 4–5 h\nMitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell that generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial respiration test utilizes the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as a direct read-out for cell respiration rate. The key respiratory parameters that can be measured are: (i) basal respiration, which is the initial OCR minus the non-mitochondrial respiration, (ii) ATP-linked OCR, which is determined after addition of oligomycin that inhibits ATP synthase, (iii) proton leak, which is the difference between ATP-linked OCR and non-mitochondrial respiration, (iv) maximal respiration, which is induced after addition of carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) that is a potent mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, (v) spare respiratory capacity, which is the difference between maximal respiration and basal respiration and (vi) non-mitochondrial respiration, which is the OCR after addition of rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and antimycin A (complex III inhibitor) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The protocol hence describes the steps required to prepare the drugs and cells for mitochondrial stress test.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1548-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Measurements of the different parameters from the mitochondrial respiration test\nSchematic showing the different respiratory parameters that can be measured by the mitochondrial respiration test. Data are displayed as mean ± SD.\nDay prior to mitochondria stress test seahorse experiment.",
    "At one day before XF analysis, hydrate a sensor cartridge and utility plate for 18–24 h, with 1 mL of XF Calibrant in a non-CO2 37°C incubator. Ensure that the incubator is properly humidified. Users can refer to https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay] for specific instructions on the hydration protocol to use for the different cartridges. Users will have to perform hydration before performing the mitochondrial respiration test or glycolytic stress test.\nDay of assay.\nDilute the drugs from their respective stock concentrations to 10× in Seahorse XF RPMI assay media beforehand.\nRefer to the materials and methods segment for detailed instructions on how to prepare the Seahorse XF RPMI assay media.\nDilute drugs to 10× to a total volume of 3 mL using the following dilution ratios:\nOligomycin: Add 30 μL (10,000×) to 2,970 μL of Seahorse XF RPMI assay media.\nFCCP: Add 30 μL (10,000×) to 2,970 μL of Seahorse XF RPMI assay media.\nRotenone + antimycin A: Add 30 μL of rotenone (10,000×) and 30 μL of antimycin A (10,000×) to 2,940 μL of Seahorse XF RPMI assay media.\nWash cells with Seahorse XF RPMI assay media. Remove 300 μL of media and replace with 300 μL of Seahorse XF RPMI assay media for each wash. Repeat the washes for a total of three times.\nAfter the last wash, top up each well using Seahorse XF RPMI assay media to a final volume of 530 μL.\nObserve cells under the light microscope to ensure that a monolayer of cells is present in all wells, and that no cells were dislodged.",
    "Let the cell equilibrate in the Seahorse XF RPMI assay media for at least 30 min. The plate can be placed in a humidified chamber during transit to a facility. If not, the plate can be placed in a regular incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nPipet the drugs into the drug ejection ports with the volumes as follows:\nPort A: Oligomycin (70 μL).\nPort B: FCCP (75 μL).\nPort C: Rotenone + Antimycin A (85 μL).\nSwitch on the Seahorse XF analyser. In the “Wave” software, select the mitochondria stress test assay template, which will assign ports A, B and C to be oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone + antimycin A respectively. After which, click “Design” to assign the sample positions according to the experimental conditions. A standard seahorse run includes the following steps:\nCalibrate.\nEquilibrate.\nBaseline readings: Loop 3 times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min) and measure (3 min).\nInject port A: Loop 3 times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min) and measure (3 min).\nInject port B: Loop 3 times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min) and measure (3 min).\nInject port C: Loop 3 times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min) and measure (3 min).\nEnd program.\nWhen prompted, place the loaded sensor cartridge with the utility plate into the Seahorse analyser and start the calibration step.\nAfter the calibration step, replace the calibrant plate for the cell plate. Ensure that the cell plate is loaded in the correct orientation.\nAllow the seahorse experiment to run as per preset protocol.\nExtract the results for analysis with the Seahorse Wave Desktop Software. Users can download the software at https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-software/seahorse-wave-desktop-software-740897[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-software/seahorse-wave-desktop-software-740897].

    "Note: Make sure that the sensor cartridge and utility plate are hydrated one day before running the XF analysis.\nNote: Wash the cells gently to minimize the risk of cells lifting off. It is often a good habit to place the pipet tip against the side of the walls before dispensing to minimize disruption of the monolayer. Check that the cells remain intact after the washing steps.\nNote: While it is theoretically possible to perform the mitochondria stress test and glycolytic stress test simultaneously within a single plate, we do not recommend doing so as the media for cell washing and drugs that are used for both tests are different. If both assays are concurrently running in one plate, ensure that the ports A, B and C are loaded with the correct drugs.\nNote: The activity of FCCP may decline upon multiple freeze-thaw cycles. We recommend keeping FCCP in small aliquots to preserve the FCCP activity for longer periods of time.\nNote: You can collect the supernatant before performing the cell washes and perform a plaque assay to ascertain the level of virus infection during the point of XF analysis.\nNote: Normalization is critical in the workflow for analysis of raw data from the XF analyzer. In this protocol we used the number of cells as the method for normalization. However, other methods such as protein concentration and DNA content can be used as well.

    "Besides oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis is the second pathway that supplies ATP to satisfy the energy requirements of cells. This protocol measures the different glycolytic parameters after virus infection, where the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) is predominantly the read-out for excretion of lactic acid per unit time. The key parameters measured are: (i) glucose metabolism, which is the difference between maximum ECAR measurement after glucose addition and non-glycolytic acidification, (ii) maximal glycolytic capacity, which is the difference between maximum ECAR measurement after inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by oligomycin and non-glycolytic acidification, (iii) spare glycolytic reserve, which is the difference between maximal glycolytic capacity and glucose metabolism, and (iv) non-glycolytic extracellular acidification rate which is the glucose metabolism rate after treatment with 2-deoxyglucose, which is an inhibitor of hexokinase II that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). This protocol describes the steps required to prepare the drugs and cells for glycolytic stress test. The results of the glycolytic stress test will complement with the mitochondrial stress test, providing a comprehensive overview of the cellular bioenergetics involved.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1548-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
