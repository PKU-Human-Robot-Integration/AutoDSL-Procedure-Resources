    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConduct Incucyte experiment\nTiming: varies by length of drug treatment, but typically 2–5 days\nIn this step, cell seeding, treatment, and imaging are conducted to generate raw counts of live and dead cells at each timepoint over the course of an experiment. These counts provide the basis for further analysis of cell death kinetics in subsequent steps.\nSeed mKate2+ cells for treatment.\nTrypsinize, quench, and count mKate2+ cells. Resuspend in culture media for seeding at the density determined in pilot experiments.\nSeed cells in appropriate tissue culture vessel, centrifuge 55 × g for 5 s, and place in tissue culture incubator. Allow to adhere 18–24 h.\nApply drug treatment.\nAdd SYTOX Green dye to appropriate culture medium at a concentration of 20 nM.\nPrepare treatment media by diluting compounds of interest in SYTOX Green-containing medium. If desired, perform serial dilutions of compounds to test multiple doses. Include vehicle control treatment(s) as appropriate.\nInvert seeded plate and flick sharply into a basin to remove seeding medium. Working quickly to prevent wells from drying completely, replace with 200 μL of treatment medium.\nBegin Incuycte imaging of plate.\nPlace plate in open slot of Incucyte. Ensure that plate is seated securely in slot and level along all plate edges.\nIn Incucyte Zoom software, select the plate definition for the specific vessel (e.g., Corning 96 well, Cat# 3904) being employed in the experiment from the list of preset option. Add the plate to the repeating scan schedule to scan once every 4 h.\nComplete Incucyte experiment and obtain raw counts for analysis.\nStop experiment at endpoint determined in pilot experiments.\nRun analysis of collected images using cell line-optimized analyzer.",
    "Export time course data for each treatment condition for three object count parameters: SYTOX Green+ objects per mm2, mKate2+ objects per mm2, and overlap objects per mm2.\nPause Point: Data can be further analyzed immediately or stored electronically until a later time.\nAnalyze fractional killing kinetics\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the processing of raw object counts to calculate cell death kinetic parameters. Specifically, raw counts are converted to a lethal fraction (LF) metric as described in (Forcina et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Curve fitting of LF values over the course of an experiment allows for calculation of the death onset (DO) and death rate (DR) parameters. DR values are a useful means to quantify the rate of drug-induced fractional killing (FK), as described in (Inde et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). These parameter values can then be compared between diverse conditions acquired in parallel.\nCalculate and plot LF for each time point in each experimental condition. Refer to “Quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]” for a sample dataset.\nOptional: Examine the overlap+ counts for the tested conditions. For some cell line/drug combinations, or individual timepoints, these may be a substantial fraction of all mKate2+ object. If overlap+ counts are high (> 5% of all mKate2+ counts), generate corrected mKate2+ object counts by subtracting the overlap object count from the corresponding mKate2 object count at each timepoint.\nUsing the raw or corrected mKate2+ counts, calculate LF according to the formula below. MaxSG is the maximum value for SYTOX Green+ counts observed up to the current timepoint. imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/431-Si1.jpg\nUsing GraphPad Prism software, plot the LF data over time in an XY scatter plot",
    "Fit one phase association curve to data. This curve, also referred to as a lag-exponential death (LED) model, includes a plateau phase (up until DO) where little or no death occurs and an exponential phase (after DO) where death begins at a given rate (DR) and then slows over time.\nIn the Prism software, create a new analysis from the data table containing the LF data.\nIn the “Create New Analysis” window, select “Nonlinear regression (curve fit)” under the “XY analyses” category.\nIn the “Parameters: Nonlinear Regression” window, in the “Model” tab, select “Plateau followed by one phase association” under the “Exponential” category.\nAlso, in the “Parameters: Nonlinear Regression” window, in the “Constrain” tab, change the Constraint Type for X0 (corresponding to DR) to “No constraint.”\nClick “OK” to perform the curve-fitting analysis. A new “Results” sheet will appear when the analysis is complete.\nExtract kinetic parameters from fitted curve.\nIn the Results sheet corresponding to the LF data table, confirm a successful curve fit. If the nonlinear regression analysis is unable to determine parameters for the curve, the column will be labeled “Ambiguous” and will not provide 95% CI values. In these cases, often where little death is observed in the treated cells, the exponential curve fit is not appropriate for the data, and DR and DO values should not be used for comparisons with other conditions.\nFor each time course, kinetic parameters correspond to calculated “Best-fit values” for the fitted curves. X0 corresponds to DO in hours; Y0 corresponds to the baseline LF preceding DO; Plateau corresponds to LF at the conclusion of the experiment; and K corresponds to DR."
