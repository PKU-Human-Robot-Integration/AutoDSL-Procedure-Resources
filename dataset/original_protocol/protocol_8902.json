    "1. Sample Preparation: Cell Culture\nGrow four 150 mm plates of A431 cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.\n\t\nGrow the A431 cells to 50% confluency.\nSerum restrict the four plates of A431 cells with serum-free DMEM for 24 h.\nTreat two plates of A431 cells with 33.3 mg/mL of epidermal growth factor for 1 h. Leave the other two plates untreated.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell growth and treatment conditions shown here provide an example; however, this methodology is applicable to many different cell types and treatment conditions.\nPrepare blastR lysis and dilution buffers with inhibitors (Table 1). Combine 2.895 mL of blastR lysis buffer with 15 µL of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, 30 µL of deubiquitinase and deSUMOylase inhibitor, 30 µL of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, and 30 µL of protease inhibitor cocktail.\n\t\nCombine 9.65 mL of blastR dilution buffer with 50 µL of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, 100 µL of deubiquitinase and deSUMOylase inhibitor, 100 µL of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, and 100 µL of protease inhibitor cocktail.\n\t\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for buffer composition and inhibitor information.\nPour off the culture media and place the cells on ice. Then, wash the cells twice with 10 mL of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\nRemove as much PBS as possible prior to adding blastR lysis buffer to maximize cell lysis.\n\t\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for buffer composition.\nAdd 600 µL of blastR lysis buffer for each 150 mm plate. The amount of buffer is based on expected protein yield (Table 2).\n\t\nLyse the cells using a cell scraper. The lysate will become viscous due to nuclear lysis.",
    "Use a snipped 1 mL pipette tip to transfer the crude lysate into a blastR filter that has been placed in a 15 mL collection tube (Figure 1). Here, a 15 mL falcon tube is used.\nUse a supplied filter plunger to completely compress the blastR filter and collect the lysate flow-through, including any bubbles, in a 15 mL tube (Figure 1).\nOptional: Transfer clarified lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge the lysate at approximately 10,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.\n\t\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL falcon tube.\nDilute the clarified lysate with blastR dilution buffer to a final volume of 3 mL for each 150 mm plate. The final volume is based on expected protein yield (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: This step is important as the final buffer composition will affect the IP reaction stringency.\nQuantitate protein concentration (section 2).\n2. Protein Quantitation Assay\nNOTE: Utilize a standard colorimetric protein quantitation assay to determine protein quantitation. Here, protein quantitation is determined using precision red advanced protein assay.\nAdd 1 mL of precision red advanced protein assay reagent to each of two 1 mL cuvettes.\nMix 10 µL of blastR lysis buffer and 40 µL of blastR dilution buffer in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.\n\tNOTE: This will be used for reading the blank protein sample.\nAdd 20 µL of the lysis/dilution buffer mix (from step 2.2) to the first cuvette and mix by inverting two to three times.\nAdd 20 µL of the diluted cell lysate (from experiment) to the second cuvette, mixing as above.\nIncubate samples for 1 min at room temperature.\nBlank spectrophotometer with the lysis/dilution buffer mix sample (from step 2.3).\nMeasure absorbance of the lysate sample (from step 2.4) at 600 nm.",
    "Determine the lysate protein concentration as follows;\nsample reading OD600  x 5 = protein concentration in mg/mL\n\tNOTE: OD readings below 0.05 or above 0.5 are close to the linear range capacity of the protein assay. For readings >0.5, samples can be diluted. For readings <0.05, more lysate can be added to the precision red advanced protein assay reagent (up to 50 µL). See Table 3 for multipliers to convert spectrophotometer readings to mg/mL lysate protein concentration. If there is insufficient protein in one plate, it is recommended to use 2 or more plates per IP. In this case, plates will be harvested in series, transferring the original 300 µL of lysis buffer between plates.\nBased on protein concentration, dilute sample with a buffer mix (1 part blastR lysis: 4 parts blastR dilution) to a desired final concentration (usually 1 mg/mL).\nSnap freeze aliquots of samples that will not be used immediately.\n\t\nStore samples at -70 °C.\nProceed to Section 3.\n3. Immunoprecipitation (IP) Assay\nNOTE: Affinity bead concentrations, lysate concentrations, and incubation times are recommended guidelines, and may be unique for each target protein and specific PTM being investigated.\nInvert stock reagent tubes containing Ub affinity beads, pY affinity beads, SUMO 2/3 affinity beads, and Ac affinity beads several times to make sure that the beads are completely resuspended in the tube.\nFor each IP assay, aliquot bead suspension into separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice (IP tube). Here, add 20 µL of ubiquitin affinity beads, 30 µL of phosphotyrosine affinity beads, 40 µL of SUMOylation 2/3 affinity beads, or 50 µL of acetylation affinity beads to individual 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\n\tNOTE: See Table 4 for the recommended volume of bead suspension to use for each affinity bead.",
    "Invert stock reagent tubes containing ubiquitination IP control beads and IgG control beads several times to make sure that the beads are completely resuspended in the tube.\nAliquot control beads per control reaction to determine non-specific binding (Control IP tube). Here, add 20 µL of Ub control beads, 30 µL of pY control beads, 40 µL of SUMO 2/3 control beads, or 50 µL of Ac control beads to individual 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\n\tNOTE: See Table 4 for the recommended volume of bead suspension to use for each type of affinity bead.\nSave a small amount of lysate (20 µL) to run as a western blot input lysate control. Add 5 µL of 5x sample buffer and boil at 95 °C for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for buffer composition.\nAdd lysate to each IP tube and control IP tube. Here, 1 mg of lysate was used per IP and control reaction, resulting in a total of 8 IP reactions.\n\tNOTE: 1.0 mg of lysate per assay is recommended as a starting point. The amount of lysate required will vary depending upon the abundance of modified target protein.\nIncubate the tubes on an end-over-end rotating platform at 4 °C for 2 h. Here, an ATR tube rotator was used at speed 22.\nCollect beads by centrifugation at 3,000 - 5,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate off as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the beads.\nWash beads in 1 mL blastR Wash Buffer (inhibitors are not necessary at this stage) for 5 min on a 4 °C rotating platform.\nCollect beads by centrifugation at 3,000 - 5,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate off as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the beads.",
    "Repeat the wash step (steps 3.10 - 3.12) two more times.\nAfter the final wash, completely remove buffer supernatant. Minimal disruption of the bead pellet is acceptable (up to a 5% loss). Remove residual supernatant using a fine bore protein loading tip.\nAdd 30 µL of bead elution buffer, and resuspend the beads by gently tapping/flicking the side of the tube. DO NOT use a pipette at this stage.\n\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for buffer composition.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nGently transfer each bead suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge spin column that has been placed in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to snip the end off of the transfer pipette tip for gentler transfer.\nCentrifuge at 9,000 - 10,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature to collect the IP sample.\nAdd 2 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol to each sample and mix well.\n\tNOTE: It is convenient to snap the lid off the spin column and use this to cap the collection tube for further processing.\nPlace samples in a 95 °C water bath for 5 min. Collect sample by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 1 min at RT.\nIf necessary, store samples at -70 °C and stop here, or proceed to running SDS-PAGE, transfer, and western blot analysis (Section 4).\n4. Western Blot Analysis: Identification of Protein of Interest\nSeparate samples by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, according to standard laboratory protocols32.\nUse a primary antibody to detect the post-translationally modified versions of the protein of interest. Here, PD-L1 antibody was used to detect post-translationally modified PD-L1.\nUse ultrasensitive chemiluminescence detection reagent for detection.",
    "NOTE: The chemiluminescent reagent should be used in conjunction with an HRP-labeled secondary antibody capable of detecting the primary antibody.\nUse a volume of 2 mL of chemiluminescent reagent per mini-gel-sized transfer membrane (approximately 8 x 7 cm).\n\t\nAfter incubation with appropriate secondary antibody (60 min at RT is recommended), wash the blot 6 x 10 min in 30 mL of tris-buffered saline with tween-20 (TBST).\n\t\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for buffer composition.\nImmediately before use, mix 1 mL of chemiluminescent reagent A with 1 mL of chemiluminescent reagent B (sufficient for one 8 cm x 7 cm membrane).\nAdd chemiluminescent reagent to membrane and incubate with gentle rocking at RT for 1 - 5 min prior to visualization of protein signal using x-ray film or charge-coupled device (CCD) camera imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: Shorter incubation times in the chemiluminescent reagent may be necessary for highly abundant proteins."
