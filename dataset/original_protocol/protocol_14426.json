    "Ethical approval for this experiment was obtained from the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of the KU Leuven (P065/2013). Animals were treated in accordance with current national guidelines on animal welfare.\n1. Material and the Experimental Animal\nSurgery preparation\nIn the surgical theater cover a table with a sterile drape and prepare one sterile curved trocar (Figure 1, panel A), sterile surgical instruments, sutures, and sterile gauze. Perform the entire surgical procedure in sterile conditions if the experiment includes follow-up. Place all instruments on the table to be ready for use during surgery.\nRemove a sterile rectangular implant and/or an implant with anchoring arms from the sterile package and put them on the table covered with sterile drape (Figure 1B, C, and D).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55706/55706fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Trocar and Implants. (A) Schematic drawing of the trocar. (B) H-shaped polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) implant, with a detail of the central part (panel C). Its shape was inspired by the four-arm meshes currently available for transvaginal prolapse repair. The rectangular body (30 x 40 mm2) is laterally extended by four outstretched arms (150 x 10 mm2). The dimensions of the arms are designed to be long enough to pierce the relevant suspension structures, based on earlier anatomical studies17. (D) The rectangular implant (30 x 40 mm2). Both implants were made of polyvinylidene fluoride; textile characteristics and properties are in Table 1.\nExperimental animal (Ewe, 45-60 kg)\nAdminister premedication of 1 mL of 15 mg/mL atropine sulfate and 1 mL/50 kg of xylazine HCl intramuscularly (i.m.) 30 min before the surgical procedure.\nAfter 30 min, ensure that the premedication has made the sheep lethargic and sleepy.\nInsert an intravenous catheter into the jugular vein and administer 0.075 mL/kg of ketamine 100 mg/mL HCl. Confirm deep anesthesia by observing the lack of reaction to painful stimuli.",
    "Move the animal onto the surgical table and secure its airways by intubation. Maintain the anesthesia with 2.5% isoflurane in 5 L/min oxygen.\nKeep the intravenous line inserted in the jugular vein and supply 500 mL of saline solution at a flow rate of 150 mL/h.\nAdminister prophylactic antibiotics i.m. (amoxicillin clavulanate, 7 mg/kg) and post-operative analgesics (buprenorfin and chlorocresol, 1 mL) or the equivalent according to local protocols.\nPlace the animal in lithotomy position on the end of the surgical table and secure its limbs, with the hips in hyper-flexion, using ropes (Figure 2, panel A).\nManually empty the bladder and rectum by pushing on them trans-vaginally.\nShave the perineum, the medial part of the thigh, and the tail folds and disinfect with polyvidone iodium 7.5% (Figure 2, panel B and C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55706/55706fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Animal Surgery.

    "Prepare personnel for a surgery in sterile conditions. Put on a surgical cap and mouth mask, wash hands for surgery, and put on a surgical gown and sterile gloves.\nCover the animal with a sterile drape and make an opening above the genital hiatus.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nPreparation of the rectovaginal septum\nGrasp the dorsal vaginal wall 3 cm cranial to the hymeneal ring using Allis forceps.\nTake a syringe loaded with 10 mL of saline and fitted with a 22 G needle. Insert it through the vaginal epithelium (approximately 3 - 4 mm deep) and into the midline of the rectovaginal septum, 1.5 cm cranial to the hymeneal ring.\nPerform \"aqua-dissection\" by injecting saline in the rectovaginal septum11.\nMake a 3 cm-long midline incision on the vaginal epithelium, starting caudal to the Allis forceps (step 2.1.1) and ending at the hymeneal ring using a scalpel. Enter the recto-vaginal space through this incision.\nPlace the self-retaining retractor (see the Table of Materials) over the perineum and place four sharp stay hooks in the vaginal incision to keep it open.\nWith your finger, bluntly dissect the recto-vaginal fascia from the vaginal wall laterally towards the pelvic side walls and cranially up to the caudal aspect of the cul-de-sac. Create suitable space for the 30 x 40 mm2 central part of the mesh (Figure 2, panel D).\nPerform haemostasis with haemostatic forceps or a crisscross haemostatic ligature whenever necessary.",
    "NOTE: Small bleeders can be clamped with the hemostatic forceps. This crushes the vessel and initiates the natural coagulation cascade. For stronger bleeding, grasp the bleeding vessel with forceps and place a crisscross ligature, securing it with a square knot. At this point, one can either insert the rectangular implant (step 2.2) or continue with the dissection to insert the implant with anchoring arms (step 2.3).\nFlat mesh insertion\nInsert the vaginal retractor into the vaginal incision to allow a better view of the cranial part of the dissected area.\nSuture the left and right cranial corner of the implant with a simple interrupted 3/0 polypropylene suture on the left and right sides of the most cranial aspect of the dissected recto-vaginal space. Cut the residual suture material. Keep the suture away from the vaginal lumen (i.e., do not penetrate the vaginal wall).\n\t\tNOTE: The implant is always sutured to the connective tissue comprising the recto-vaginal septum. The vaginal wall is not penetrated if the suture material cannot be seen in the vagina.\nAdd one additional simple interrupted suture midway along the cranial aspect of the implant.\nSuture the lateral edges of the implant midway onto the surrounding connective tissue with a simple interrupted 3/0 polypropylene. Keep the implant as flat as possible and tension-free.\nSuture the left and right caudal corners with simple interrupted 3/0 polypropylene sutures on the left and right sides of the most caudal aspect of the rectovaginal space.\nAdd one additional simple interrupted suture midway along the caudal aspect of the implant.\nClose the vaginal incisions with a running 3/0 polyglactin suture.\nInsertion and anchoring of implant with arms (trocar-guided technique).",
    "Continue the dissection of the recto-vaginal space created in step 2.1 cranio-ventrally to reach the medial aspect of the obturator foramen, which can easily be palpated.\nDissect the space caudo-laterally to reach the caudal aspect of the sacrotuberous ligament and the caudally located coccygeus muscle.\nWith a no. 24 blade, make four 1 cm-wide incisions on the vulvar side, cutting through the skin and superficial muscular fascia (Figure 2, panel B and C).\nMake two “ventral” incisions on the medial aspect of the thigh, proximately 4 cm cranial from the caudal border of the sciatic arch (i.e., the inferior border of the symphysis) and 3 cm lateral from the midline (Figure 2, panel C).\nMake two \"dorsal\" incisions at the level of the insertion of the tail folds, 2 cm medial to the tuber ischiadicum, which can be easily palpated (Figure 2, panel B).\nPlace a curved trocar through one of the ventral incisions (Figure 2, panel E).\nPass the trocar through the adductor magnus muscle, the external obturator, and the medial aspect of the obturator foramen.\nControl the progression of the trocar with a finger inserted through the vaginal incision. Guide its tip to the tendinous arc of the levator ani muscle (Figure 2, panel E).\nExpose the guiding wire in the vaginal wall incision and load it with the corresponding ipsilateral cranial mesh arm (Figure 2, panel F).\nPull the trocar loaded with the mesh arm through the above structures. Keep the arm tension-free.\nRepeat the process with the second cranial arm through the ventral incision on the other side of the animal.\nThrough one of dorsal incisions, pass the trocar through the coccygeus muscle, just distal to the sacrotuberous ligament (Figure 2, panel G).",
    "Expose the guide wire through the vaginal incision, grasp the dorsal arm of the mesh, and pull it out. Keep the arm tension-free and repeat on the other side.\nAdjust the position of the mesh by flattening it and applying tension to the arms, but keep the mesh tension-free (Figure 2, panel I; Figure 3).\nFix the body of the mesh with a simple interrupted 3/0 polypropylene suture in the middle of its caudal border, securing it to the surrounding connective tissue.\nCut the arms at the level of the skin and close all skin incisions with simple interrupted 3/0 polyglecaprone sutures (Figure 2, panel H).\nClose the vaginal incision with a running 3/0 polyglecaprone suture.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55706/55706fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Schematic Illustration of the Ovine Pelvis, with the Cranial Arms Passing through the Obturator Foramen and the Caudal Arms Passing through the Tail Folds. The broad sacrotuberous ligament is in blue. The smaller panel illustrates the position of the arms on an animal in recumbent position, just before shortening the excessive amount of material. The main panel shows the same but with the skin and muscles removed.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
