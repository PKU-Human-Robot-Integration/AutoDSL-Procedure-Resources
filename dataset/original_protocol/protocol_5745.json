    "Transformation of E. coli RosettaTM 2(DE3) with pDS015 plasmid and preparation of a glycerol stockAdd 1 ng of pDS015 plasmid DNA directly to 50 µl of chemically competent E. coli RosettaTM 2(DE3) cells.Stir gently to mix and place the tubes on ice for 5 min. Heat the tubes for exactly 30 sec in a 42 °C water bath; do not shake. Immediately place the tube on ice for 2 min.Add 250 μl of room temperature sterile SOC medium (provided by the manufacturer) to the tube. Incubate at 37 °C while shaking at 250 rpm for 60 min.Spread 5-50 μl of the transformation mixture on LB agar plates containing 34 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml of chloramphenicol and kanamycin, respectively. If plating less than 25 μl of the transformation, we recommend adding 50 µl of sterile SOC medium to the transformation mixture before plating to facilitate even colony distribution on the LB agar plate surface.Incubate the LB agar plates overnight at 37 °C.The next day, pick a single colony from the transformation plates using a sterile pipette tip and inoculate 10 ml LB in a 50-ml tube. Incubate the 50-ml tube overnight in a 37 °C shaking incubator shaking at 160 rpm. The next day, add 500 μl of the overnight culture to 500 μl of 50% sterile glycerol in a 2-ml screw-top tube or cryovial and mix gently.Store the glycerol stock at -80 °C for future use.Large-scale expression of FnCas12a in E. coli RosettaTM 2(DE3)Day 1. Preparation of media, buffers and single colonies Prepare 20 ml of LB in a 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask (for starting overnight cultures) (Recipe A1).Prepare three 5-L Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 1.5 L of LB medium (for large-scale propagation and protein purification) (Recipe A1).Prepare antibiotic and stock solutions (Recipes A2 and A3).",
    "Prepare the buffers needed for the purification (Recipes B1-B8).Streak out a glycerol stock of E. coli RosettaTM 2(DE3) transformed with pDS015 on an LB agar plate containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Incubate the LB agar plate overnight in a 37 °C incubator.Day 2. Overnight culture preparation Add 20 μl of the 50 mg/ml kanamycin stock solution and 20 μl of the 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol stock solution to the 20 ml of autoclaved LB medium in a 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask from Day 1. With a sterile pipette tip, pick a single colony of E. coli RosettaTM 2(DE3) transformed with pDS015 from the LB agar plate from Day 1. Use the colony to inoculate the medium containing the kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Loosely close the 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask with a cotton plug.Incubate the bacterial culture at 37 °C for 16-20 h in a shaking incubator (set at 160 rpm).Day 3. Large-scale propagation of cells overexpressing FnCas12a  Take three autoclaved 5-L Erlenmeyer flasks* each containing 1.5 L LB medium from Day 1.To each flask, add 1.5 ml of 50 mg/ml chloramphenicol solution.To each flask, add 1.5 ml of 34 mg/ml kanamycin solution.To each flask, add 15 ml of the overnight culture prepared on Day 2.Incubate the culture flasks at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 160 rpm**.Monitor the OD600 nm of the culture every half an hour. Once an OD600 nm of 0.5-0.6 is reached (this normally takes ~3-4 h), transfer the Erlenmeyer containing the culture to the ice-water bath and incubate (cold-shock) it for 15 min. This step slows down the metabolism of E. coli and triggers expression of cold-shock proteins which may aid FnCas12a folding during expression. To each flask, add 200 μl of filter-sterilized 1 M IPTG solution to the culture to induce expression of FnCas12a.",
    "Transfer the culture to an 18 °C shaking incubator (set at 120 rpm) for overnight expression (~16 h). Notes: *It is also possible to express smaller volumes of cell culture (e.g., a single 1.5 L culture or one or more 750 ml cultures in 2-L Erlenmeyer flasks)**When using a baffled Erlenmeyer flask, reduce the shaking incubator speed to 120 rpm to prevent the formation of foam.  Day 4–Part I. Large-scale propagation of cells overexpressing FnCas12a (continued) Transfer the overnight culture from Day 3 to centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifuging the culture for 15 min at 6,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard supernatant and store the pelleted cells at -20 °C (for use within a week for optimal purification) or at -80 °C (for long-term storage) or proceed directly to purification. The expected yield is ~5 g of cell pellet per liter of cell culture.Day 4–Part II. Purification of FnCas12a–Part I If continuing with a frozen cell pellet, thaw the cell pellet from Day 4–Part I on ice for 30-60 min. If proceeding directly after protein expression, skip this step. Note: All subsequent steps should be performed on ice or at 4 °C.Resuspend the entire cell pellet in Lysis Buffer (~2.5-5 ml Lysis Buffer per gram of cell pellet). Add 1 tablet cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor for every 50 ml. Add lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Incubate the sample on ice for 30 min. If using a French Press for cell lysis: after the lysozyme treatment, pass cell suspension through French Press twice at 16,000 psi. If using sonication for cell lysis: after the lysozyme treatment, lyse the cell suspension by using a sonicator with an appropriate tip and a protocol suitable for lysis of large volume cell suspensions.",
    "For our setup (Bandelin SONOPULS HD with VS 70 T tip), we use the following settings: 10 min total time, 1 sec on, 0.7 sec off, and 20% amplitude. The cell suspension often has a brownish tinge after lysis as shown in Figure 3.Note: Using a French Pressure cell or sonicator gives approximately the same yield–FnCas12a is very stable and little to no protein will be lost during sonication. Keep in mind, however, that sonication is usually less suitable for large volumes, and therefore a protocol suitable for lysis of a large volume of cell suspension should be applied.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180503/20180503042751_8842.jpgFigure 3. After lysis, the cell suspension becomes tinted brown and less viscousPour the lysate into (a) centrifugation tube(s) and centrifuge for 45 min, 4 °C, at 30,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant to (a) clean 50-ml tube(s). This is the ‘cell-free extract’.Note: A sample of the lysed cell pellet may be stored at 4 °C and analyzed later by SDS-PAGE analysis for the presence of FnCas12a to assess its solubility and to determine if cell lysis was successful.Pass the cell free extract through a 0.22 µm membrane filter and save the filtrate into a sterile tube.Using a peristaltic pump, wash a HisTrap HP column with 3-5 column volumes of distilled water to remove the solution in which the resin is stored. Using a peristaltic pump, equilibrate the HisTrap HP with at least 5 column volumes of Lysis Buffer with a flow rate of 2 ml/min.Using the peristaltic pump*, pass the filtered cell free extract with a flow rate of 1 ml/min through the HisTrap HP column and collect the flow-through in (a) 50-ml tube(s) labeled ‘flow-through’**.Notes： *For sample loading, a superloop can be used instead of the peristaltic pump.",
    "**A sample of the flow-through may be stored at 4 °C and analyzed later by SDS-PAGE analysis for the presence of the FnCas12a to determine if the protein bound to the column (if a large fraction of the protein remains in the flow-through, regenerate or replace your column). In some cases, the high amount of proteins can saturate the column. To recover the protein in the flow-through, the flow-through can be (re)loaded onto another or regenerated HisTrap HP column. The next chromatography steps are performed using an ÄKTA FPLC system.Equilibrate the ÄKTA FPLC system with Wash Buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm reaches a steady baseline. Transfer the HisTrap HP column to the ÄKTA FPLC and wash the column using Wash Buffer with a flow rate of 2 ml/min for 10-15 times the column volume or until the absorbance at 280 nm becomes near** stable with the Wash Buffer. Collect the first 3-4 10-ml wash fractions* in separate tubes labeled ‘wash-through #’.Notes:  *The wash-through may be saved and checked later using SDS-PAGE analysis for the presence of FnCas12a to determine if it was eluted off the column during washing.**Even at its low concentration, imidazole in the washing buffer can remove small amounts of the protein of interest. Therefore, start eluting the protein as the absorbance at 280 nm is near stable to avoid unnecessary loss of the protein of interest. Elute the protein using the Elution Buffer with a flow rate of 2 ml/min while fractionating to 1 ml samples, collect the eluate and save the fractions in separate tubes labeled ‘Elution fraction #’. An example of a typical elution chromatogram of FnCas12a purified by Histrap HP (5 ml) affinity purification is shown in Figure 4. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180503/20180503043023_2042.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Representative elution chromatogram of FnCas12a purified by Histrap HP (5 ml) affinity purification. 75 ml of cell-free extract was loaded on the column. Elution fractions were 1 ml and the flow rate was set at 2 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm is expressed in milli-absorbance units for the A280 (blue) and A254 (red). Please note that the A254 is not very informative after niNTA purification, as at this stage, the sample is contaminated with various nucleic acids. The green line indicates the concentration of Elution Buffer (0% at the start of the chromatogram and 100% at the final stage of the chromatogram).Dilute 10 µl of the collected fractions with 4x Laemmli protein sample buffer, heat for 5 min at 95 °C and resolve the samples on SDS-PAGE gel to assess the purity of the sample.Combine the elution fractions in which the protein is present and check the absorbance at 280 nm to estimate the protein concentration. The extinction coefficient of FnCas12a is 145,820 M-1 cm-1. Typical yield at this step is ~25 mg per liter of expression culture**. Note: **The yield is most likely overestimated at this point due to protein and nucleic acid contaminations.Add 2 ml (final 1 mM) of 1 M DTT stock and 4 ml of 0.5 M EDTA stock to 2 L of Dialysis Buffer before use. Increase the volume of the combined protein fractions to 25 ml using the Dialysis Buffer. Add 1 mg TEV per 100 mg of protein. Take a dialysis membrane with an MWCO of 12,400 and soak it in the Dialysis Buffer for 1 min. Use a clamp to close the dialysis membrane on one end to make a bag. Pipet the combined protein sample into the dialysis membrane bag and close the other end with another clamp.",
    "Dialyze the sample overnight at 4 °C with slow stirring against 2 L of the Dialysis Buffer.    Day 5. Purification of FnCas12a–Part II Transfer the protein sample from the dialysis membrane into a 50 ml tube and centrifuge it for 10 min at 4,500 x g at 4 °C to remove potential precipitated proteins. Dilute the sample 1:1 using Sample Dilution Buffer*.Using a peristaltic pump, wash the column with 3-5 column volumes of distilled water to remove the solution in which the column resin is stored.Using a peristaltic pump, equilibrate the Heparin FF column with at least 5 column volumes of IEX-A Buffer with a flow rate of 2 ml/min.Using a peristaltic pump, load the protein sample onto the Heparin FF column.Equilibrate the ÄKTA FPLC with IEX-A Buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm reaches a steady baseline.Transfer the Heparin FF column to the ÄKTA FPLC and wash it with 10 ml IEX-A Buffer at 2 ml/min. Collect the flow-through in appropriately labeled clean tubes. Elute the protein using a linear gradient from 0 to 50% IEX-B Buffer over 60 ml at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, collect the eluate as 1 ml fractions in appropriately labeled clean tubes.

    "Expression and purification of AsCas12a or LbCas12a typically results in slightly higher Cas12a yields.Dilute the samples to a concentration suitable for subsequent experiments (e.g., 10 µM)** and aliquot the protein at a desired concentration and store at -80 °C.Notes: *For LbCas12a, dilute in a 2:1 ratio (protein sample: Dilution Buffer) due to the instability of LbCas12a at lower salt concentrations. **It is recommended to store the protein at ≥ 10 µM and dilute it to the right concentration only just before use. At lower concentrations, a relative high fraction of the protein can be lost due freezing/thawing and non-specific adsorption to the surface of the tube/container used for storage. Day 6. In vitro cleavage assay for confirming the activity of purified FnCas12aNotes: We strongly recommend wearing gloves and using nuclease-free tubes and reagents to avoid RNase contamination.The reaction volume is typically 20 μl but can be scaled up as needed.
