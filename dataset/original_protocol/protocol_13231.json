    "All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The exams can be performed using either a sector array (sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"phased array\") or a low-frequency curvilinear transducer based on the sonographers' preference. For the figures and scans, a curvilinear probe was used for the anterior sagittal views, while a sector array probe was used for the gastric body scans. The commercial details of the probes are provided in the Table of Materials.\n1. Subxiphoid sagittal gastric antrum views (aka \"Subxiphoid Views\")\nSupine view\n\t\nPatient positioning: place the patient in the supine position. If the patient is unable to tolerate being fully supine, up to 30 degrees head up is an acceptable alternative.\nProbe selection: select any low-frequency probe (e.g., curvilinear or sector array) (see Table of Materials).\nMode selection: set the preset to abdominal mode.\nProbe placement\n\t\t\nPlace the probe on the patient's sub-xiphoid region in the sagittal plane (Figure 1).\nOrient the probe marker in a cephalad direction.\nImage optimization\n\t\t\nFan the probe from the patient's left to right until one can visualize the following structures on the screen: (1) liver on the left side of the screen; (2) pulsatile aorta in the long-axis deep in the image; and (2) gastric antrum just caudal and deep to the superficial liver edge (Figure 2).",
    "Ensure the abdominal aorta is positioned at the deeper edge of the image. If the inferior vena cava (IVC) is seen instead, correct the ultrasound beam angle if angled too far towards the patient's right. In this case, visualize the stomach at the pylorus level rather than the antrum. If that happens, adjust by fanning leftward until the aorta becomes visible. This is the appropriate position to analyze the gastric antrum (Figure 3).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If only the stomach is visible at the IVC level and not the aorta, the qualitative sonographic data is still valuable, but remember that this view has lower sensitivity for detecting a \"high-risk\" stomach. In such cases, a volume assessment will probably underestimate gastric volume (Figure 3).\nIdentify the muscularis propria (hypoechoic, thickest gastric wall layer) to ensure focusing on the stomach. Large, dilated bowel can be misidentified as the gastric antrum (Figure 4).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The pancreas may be visible posterior to the gastric antrum (Figure 2).\nImage acquisition: click on Acquire to save a video clip of this sonographic view.\nRight lateral decubitus view\n\t\nPatient positioning: position the patient in the right lateral decubitus (Figure 5).\nProbe selection: follow step 1.1.2.\nMode selection: follow step 1.1.3.\nProbe placement: follow step 1.1.4.\nImage optimization: follow step 1.1.5.\nImage acquisition: follow step 1.1.6.\nQuantitative estimation of gastric volume\n\t\t\nIf the gastric antrum appears to contain only clear liquids, quantify the total gastric volume by obtaining an image of the gastric antrum as described above, with the patient in the RLD position (refer to step 1.2.5).\nWhen a view of the gastric antrum is obtained during its maximal expansion, freeze the image.",
    "Activate the Trace tool and trace out the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum along the outer hyperechoic layer of the wall representing the serosa (Figure 6).\n\t\t\tNOTE: An antral area greater than 10 cm2is unlikely consistent with normal baseline volume and suggests a \"full stomach\".\nClick on Save.\nEstimate the gastric fluid volume using the following formula13: stomach volume (mL) = 27 + 14.6 ACSA (in RLD) (cm 2) − 1.28 x age (years).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: This formula has been validated for clear liquids in the antrum. This formula was also validated in a separate study of morbidly obese individuals14.\n2. Left upper quadrant (LUQ) gastric body views\nIf subxiphoid views are inadequate or inaccessible, proceed to evaluate left upper quadrant views (step 2.2 and step 2.3).\nLUQ coronal gastric body view\n\t\nPatient positioning: follow step 1.1.1.\nProbe selection: follow step 1.1.2.\nMode selection: follow step 1.1.3.\nProbe positioning\n\t\t\nPlace the probe on the left mid-axillary line in the longitudinal plane with the orientation marker pointed toward the patient's head (Figure 7).\n\t\t\tNOTE: With the probe marker oriented in this direction, the thoracic cavity will appear on the left side of the ultrasound scanner and the right side will be the abdominal cavity.\nImage optimization\n\t\t\nIdentify the spleen and left hemidiaphragm. The spleen is identified by its rounded capsular shape. The left hemidiaphragm appears as a hyperechoic line, superior to the spleen, and moves with the normal respiratory cycle.\nOnce the spleen is identified, fan posteriorly to identify the kidney, which will appear as the oblong structure inferior and posterior to the spleen.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The spleen offers less of an acoustic window than the liver does on the right abdomen",
    "Once these landmarks are identified, angle the transducer in an anterior direction to obtain a view of the gastric body (Figure 7).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The anatomic structures will likely shift as the diaphragm moves. If possible, consider asking the patient to briefly hold his/her breath while the scans are being performed.\nAcquire the images following step 1.1.6.\nLUQ anterior transverse gastric body view\n\t\nPatient positioning: follow step 1.1.1.\nProbe selection: follow step 1.1.2.\nMode selection: follow step 1.1.3.\nProbe positioning\n\t\t\nPlace the probe on the anterior surface of the patient's abdomen at approximately the mid-clavicular line, just caudal to the ribs (Figure 8). In order to fully assess the gastric body, it might be necessary to rotate the probe clockwise to an oblique view.\nImage optimization: fan the probe cranial-to-caudal until the gastric body is seen deep into the spleen.\nAcquire images folllowing step 1.1.6.\nSubscription Required.
