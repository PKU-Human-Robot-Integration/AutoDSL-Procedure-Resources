    "1. C2C12 Cell Culture\nMaintain C2C12 mouse myoblasts in a 100 mm plate in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Allow C2C12 passaged cells to become approximately 50 - 60% confluent.\nDiscard the growth medium and wash C2C12 cells with 3 ml room temperature phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Remove the PBS and add 500 µl 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to detach the cells. Place the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 - 5 min.\nNeutralize the trypsin by adding 3 ml growth medium. Pipette 6 - 8 times to suspend the cells. Add 1 ml of suspended cell to a new 100 mm plate and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n2. C2C12 Cell Transfection/transduction and Selection\nC2C12 plasmid transfection\n\t\n24 hr prior to transfection, plate 7.0 x 105 C2C12 cells into one well of a six-well plate for each transfection.\n\t\tNote: This leads to 50 - 60% confluence by the time of transfection.\nAllow the transfection reagent to come to room temperature prior to use.\nAdd 2 µg of plasmid DNA (GFP-CUG5 or GFP-CUG200) into 200 µl pre-warmed serum free medium and vortex briefly. Add 6 µl transfection reagent to the medium and mix immediately for 30 sec using a vortex. Incubate the mixture for 30 min at room temperature.\nChange the media of C2C12 cells to 2.5 ml serum-free growth media. Add the transfection mixture to the cells after incubation. Return the plates to a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator.\nKeep the cells in transfection mixture/serum-free growth media for 4 hr or up to overnight. Change media back to the growth media the next day or when cytotoxicity is apparent.",
    "Note: Cytotoxicity is assessed by microscopic inspection of the cells. Observe the changes in cell morphology and cell detachment. As long as there is no overt cytotoxicity, overnight incubation in serum-free growth media enhances transfection.\nSelect the cells 48 hr after transfection by adding 1.2 - 1.6 mg/ml G418 for ~ 10 days until the control culture (transfected without the plasmids) does not have live cells. Change the media every two days with growth media supplemented with G418.\nMaintain the G418 resistant cells in growth medium and 5% CO2 at 37 °C for subsequent experiments.\nRetrovirus preparation and C2C12 retroviral transduction\n\t\nPrepare HEK 293 culture medium by supplementing DMEM high glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.\n\t\t\nApproximately 24 hr prior to transfection, plate 4.0 x 106 ecotropic HEK 293-based packaging cells in a 100 mm plate (80% confluence at transfection) containing cell culture medium.\nAllow the transfection reagent to come to room temperature prior to use.\nMix 15 µg plasmid DNA (pMSCV-Puro or pMSCV-Celf1Flag-Puro) in 1 ml serum-free growth medium. Vortex briefly. Add 30 µl transfection reagent from step 2.2.2 into the DNA/serum-free growth medium tube, and mix well using vortex. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd transfection mixture dropwise to the ecotropic HEK 293-based packaging cells. Gently swirl the plates and return them back to the 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. After 24 hr, change the media to 10 ml pre-warmed fresh growth medium.\nHarvest the supernatant (containing retrovirus) 48 hr after transfection using a pipette and transfer the supernatant into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Add 10 ml of new warm media to the plate and return it to the incubator. Keep the supernatant at 4 °C.",
    "Note: The media is added gently to the side of the well so as not to disrupt the cell monolayer.\nHarvest the second batch of supernatant 60 hr after transfection and pool it with the supernatant from 2.2.5. Centrifuge at 500 x g, 4 °C for 7 min to remove cellular debris.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 50 ml centrifuge tube. Use retrovirus to transduce C2C12 cells at this point by proceeding to step 2.2.9 or aliquot and store the supernatant at -20 °C for future use.\nThaw the retrovirus from 2.2.7 at room temperature, if a frozen stock is used here.\n\t\tNote: Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nPlate C2C12 cells on the same day of transduction aiming for 30 - 40% of confluence.\n\t\t\nDiscard the growth medium and wash C2C12 cells with 3 ml room temperature PBS. Remove the PBS, add 500 µl 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, and incubate the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 - 5 min.\nNeutralize the trypsin by adding 3 ml growth medium. Pipette 6 - 8 times to suspend the cells. Count cells using a hemocytometer and add 8.0 x 105 C2C12 cells to a 60 mm plate.\nAdd 0.5 ml retrovirus to infect one 60 mm plate of cells in 3 ml growth media. Return the plate to the incubator.\nReplace with 3 ml fresh media supplemented with selection antibiotic (puromycin 1 - 3 µg/ml) 48 hr after infection. Replace 3 ml medium with antibiotic every day for ~ 5 days until the untransduced C2C12 control culture dies out.\nLentivirus preparation and C2C12 lentiviral transduction\n\tNote: Perform all the lentivirus-related procedures in Biosafety Level 2 cabinet and follow biological safety guidelines. Liquid waste containing the virus must be disinfected prior to disposal.",
    "Plate 4.0 x 106 293T cells in a 100 mm plate (~ 80% confluence at day of transfection) with HEK 293 cell culture medium (DMEM high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine) 24 hr before transfection.\nWarm the transfection reagent to room temperature. Mix the lentiviral packaging vectors (4 µg pMD2.G and 6 µg psPAX2) together with 8 µg lentiviral transfer vector (Celf1 shRNA or scrambled control shRNA) in 1 ml serum free cell culture medium. Vortex briefly.\nAdd 36 µl pre-warmed transfection reagent to the DNA/DMEM tube and mix well by vortex. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 min.\nRemove the 293T cells from the incubator and add the transfection mixture to the plate. Gently swirl the plate and return it back to 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. After 24 hr, replace the transfection mixture with 10 ml fresh culture medium.\nCollect the supernatant containing lentivirus 48 hr after transfection and transfer it into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Add 10 ml new warm media to the plate and return it to incubator. Store the supernatant at 4 °C.\nCollect the second batch of supernatant 60 hr after transfection and combine it with the supernatant from 2.3.5. Centrifuge briefly at 500 x g, 4 °C for 7 min.\nTransfer the supernatant into a fresh 50 ml centrifuge tube. If using fresh virus, proceed to step 2.3.9. For future use, store virus-containing supernatant at -20 °C in aliquots of 10 ml.\nThaw the virus from 2.3.7 at room temperature before use, if a frozen stock is used.\n\t\tNote: Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nPlate C2C12-CUG200 cells (obtained in Section 2.1) as described in 2.2.9 on the same day of transduction.\n\t\tNote: Aim for 30 - 40% of confluence.",
    "Add 0.5 ml virus to infect a 60 mm plate of C2C12-CUG200 and return the plate to the incubator.\nReplace the culture medium with fresh media supplemented with the selection antibiotic (puromycin 1 - 3 µg/ml) 72 hr after transduction. Refresh culture media everyday with the selection antibiotic for ~5 days until all untransduced C2C12-CUG200 control culture dies out.\nUse Western blot to verify Celf1 knockdown in GFP-CUG200 transfected cells.\n3. C2C12 Cell Differentiation\nPlate 2 x 106 cells in one well of a 6-well plate in 2.5 ml growth media 24 hr before initiation of differentiation.\n\tNote: The plating density may be adjusted so that full confluence is reached in 24 hr.\n\t\nRinse confluent cells with PBS and add 2.5 ml of low-serum differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% equine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 µM insulin). Replace the medium every two days.\n\t\tNote: Keep stock insulin frozen and add it to the media at each medium change.\nDuring C2C12 differentiation, collect samples for quantitative RT-PCR (see section 4) at the following time points: Day0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. Process the culture for immunostaining at day 6 - 8 (see section 5).\n4. RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR\nUse the manufacturer's protocol for RNA isolation. After isolation, resuspend the RNA pellet in 30 µl RNase-free water and pipet up and down several times.\n\tNote: The samples may proceed to Quantitative RT-PCR or can be stored at -80 °C.\nUse a RT qPCR kit for Quantitative RT-PCR10 and follow the manufacturer's instruction.
