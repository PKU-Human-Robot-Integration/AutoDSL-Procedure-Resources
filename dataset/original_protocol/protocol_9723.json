    "This protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of California at Riverside (UCR) for cell and tissue harvesting. A 12-week-old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat is shown as an example in the video. Younger female and male rats are preferred.\n1. Cell culture preparation\nNOTE: The three culture methods described in this article are generally applicable for different cell types that are adherent. Here, BMSCs harvested from rat weanlings will be introduced as an example for cell culture preparation. Depending on their relevance for specific medical applications, different cell types may be utilized, including primary cells harvested from animals or human donors and cell lines from a cell/tissue bank.\nHarvesting BMSCs from rat weanlings\n\tNOTE: The schematic diagram in Figure 1 shows the steps to harvest BMSCs from rat weanlings.\n\t\nEuthanize the Sprague Dawley (SD) rat by CO2 inhalation.\nRemove the skin and muscle and connective tissues to dissect the femur out of the euthanized rat. Place the femoral bones in a 15 mL conical tube (polypropylene) containing cell culture medium. Place the conical tubes on ice until the time of performing cell extraction.\n\t\tNOTE: Tibia also can be used to harvest BMSCs. The cell culture medium is Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).\nTransfer the bones to a Petri dish in the biological safety cabinet. Cut the ends of the bone using a surgical blade and flush the bone marrow into a 50 mL conical tube (polypropylene) by washing the bone marrow cavity with cell culture media using a syringe with a 25½ G needle.",
    "NOTE: Insert a syringe with an 18 G needle into the media with bone marrow. Slowly and gently, take up and dispense the media to break apart the large chunk of marrow until no visible cell/tissue agglomerates are present.\nFilter the cell suspension using a 70 µm filter, followed by centrifugation at 126 × g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min to get the cell pellets.\nAspirate the supernatant media and replenish with 10 mL of fresh media. Gently pipette up and down to resuspend the cells using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nPipette the suspension directly on the inside bottom of a T-75 flask and add media to bring the volume up to 25 mL. Culture the cells in an incubator in a standard sterile cell culture environment (i.e., 37 °C, humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 95% air).\nAfter 3-7 days, rinse away the nonadherent cells by aspirating the old medium and replenishing with fresh medium. Continue culturing and feeding the cells with fresh medium until they are ready for cell passage, freezing, or use in an experiment.\nCell maintenance\n\t\nChange the cell culture medium regularly to remove cellular waste products and replenish the nutrients approximately every other day until the cells are 90%-100% confluent. At 90% confluency, passage, freeze, or use the cells in an experiment.\nPassaging cells\n\t\tNOTE: Passaging, also referred to as subculturing, is a term that applies whenever cells are transferred from one culture to another. Freshly harvested cells are at passage stage 0 (P0). The amounts of trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (trypsin-EDTA) and media described in this article are for a T-75 flask.\n\t\t\nCheck the cells under an optical microscope to confirm that the cells are 90% confluent.\nAspirate the medium from the cell flask.",
    "Dispense 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the flask using a serological pipette. Gently rock the flask to rinse the cells with PBS; aspirate all the PBS.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step serves as an extra rinse to ensure that no dead cells or cellular waste will be transferred during passaging.\nDispense 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA into the cell flask directly onto the surface of the cells. Gently rock the flask to ensure the entire surface with the cells is covered by the trypsin-EDTA.\nPlace the cell flask with trypsin-EDTA into the incubator for 5 min to allow the cells to detach.\nAfter 5 min in the incubator, check the cells under an optical microscope to confirm that the cells are detached. If some cells have not detached, tap the side of the cell flask gently, and check the flask again.\nAdd 9 mL of fresh medium to the cell flask to dilute the trypsin-EDTA. This provides more accessible proteins for the trypsin-EDTA to bind to instead of lysing the cells.\nPipette out the cells in media and trypsin-EDTA and dispense them into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 126 × g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.\nWithout disturbing the cell pellet, aspirate the medium with trypsin-EDTA.\nAdd 5-10 mL of fresh media to the centrifuge tube and gently resuspend the cells in the medium using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nPipette the cells suspended in medium out of the centrifuge tube and split the volume into 2-3 fresh culture flasks. Add enough medium to bring the total medium volume to 25 mL for each flask.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The split ratio during subculture may vary depending on the cell types and specific growth characteristics.\nCheck the cells under an optical microscope and place them back into the incubator.",
    "Freezing cells\n\t\t\nCheck the cells under an optical microscope to confirm that the cells are 90% confluent.\nRepeat steps 1.2.2.2 to 1.2.2.9.\nAdd 900 µL of fresh medium to the centrifuge tube with a 100-1000 µL micropipette. Slowly and gently resuspend cells in medium using the same micropipette.\nTransfer the 900 µL cell suspension into a cryovial. Add 100 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\nAs soon as possible, place the cryovial into a cylindrical foam container designed to regulate temperature decrease (see the Table of Materials). Place the foam container in the -80 °C freezer.\nThawing cells\n\t\t\nThaw the frozen cells in the water bath. Take a sterile 15 mL conical tube filled with 5 mL of fresh medium, place the cells in the conical tube, and centrifuge at 126 × g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.\nAspirate the medium containing DMSO.\nAdd 5-10 mL of fresh medium to the 15 mL conical tube of cells. Slowly and gently pipette up and down to resuspend the cells.\nPipette the cells suspended in medium out of the 15 mL conical tube and dispense into a new T-75 flask. When dispensing cells, use a sweeping motion to distribute the cells as evenly as possible on the bottom of the cell flask.\nAdd enough fresh medium to bring the total medium volume to 25 mL for each T-75 flask.\nCheck the cells under an optical microscope and place the cell flask back into the incubator.\n2. Sample preparation and sterilization\nSample preparation\n\t\nUse tissue-culture-treated plates such as 6, 12, 24, 48, or 96-well plates for cell culture experiments described in this article. Select the type of tissue-culture plates and the volume of medium in each well based on different experimental designs such as sample dimension.",
    "Sterilize or disinfect all the biodegradable samples before the cell culture.\n\tNOTE: Disinfection is acceptable for in vitro studies when the samples are prone to chemical and/or surface changes under some sterilization conditions involving high heat, oxidizer, and/or radicals. Sterilization or disinfection methods for different sample types vary depending on the different properties of the materials, such as polymers, metals, and ceramics. The process for sterilization or disinfection could involve heat, gas, radiation, chemicals, high pressure, or a combination of these.\n\t\nBiodegradable metals\n\t\t\nIn general, use ultraviolet (UV) radiation to disinfect biodegradable metals for in vitro studies.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For example, Zhang et al. reported that pure magnesium (Mg) and ZC21 Mg alloy samples were disinfected under UV radiation for 4 h before they were utilized in the cell studies1. For in vivo studies, the samples are generally required to be sterilized. For many biodegradable metals such as magnesium or magnesium alloys, autoclaving using steam should be avoided because these samples could be oxidized or corroded in water6. A quartz dish is recommended for UV disinfection because it provides better UV transparency than most glasses and plastics.\nSterilize Mg alloy samples under dry heat in an oven or autoclave at the temperature range of 100-200 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: As some metallic alloys could still become oxidized on the surface at high temperatures in the air, high-intensity radiation may be used as an alternative in some cases. However, high-intensity radiation such as alpha or gamma radiation should be avoided when sterilizing thin metallic foils. It may cause atom displacement within the materials, changing the microstructure of materials.\nUse ethylene oxide (EtO) gas sterilization as an alternative method for biodegradable metals sensitive to heat and radiation26.\nBiodegradable ceramics\n\t\t\nGenerally, disinfect biodegradable ceramics using UV radiation or 70% ethanol solution before in vitro studies.",
    "NOTE: For example, Liu et al. reported that the calcium phosphate samples were disinfected via immersion in 70% ethanol for 1 h and exposure to UV light for 12 h on each side before they were used in in vitro cytocompatibility tests27.\nUse autoclaves to sterilize biodegradable ceramics if high temperature and water vapor do not damage their compostions and microstructures.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some ceramics might be affected by autoclaving. For example, phase change and surface roughening were found when yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramics were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. Additionally, CPCs cannot be sterilized via autoclaving with steam because the samples will react with water.\nUse alternative sterilization methods such as Cobalt-60 radiation for the abovementioned yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramics and CPC samples28.\nBiodegradable polymers\n\t\t\nIn general, disinfect biodegradable polymers using UV radiation or 70% ethanol before using them in cell studies in vitro.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some polymers may undergo chemical changes under UV radiation. For sterilization, gamma-ray treatment such as Cobalt-60 radiation may be used. For example, starch powders were sterilized under Cobalt-60 radiation before being utilized in in vitro cell studies29.\nAutoclave polymer materials that can withstand high temperature and moisture.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For instance, polymers such as polypropylene can be autoclaved as they can tolerate autoclaving temperatures (i.e., 121-134 °C). Some polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) cannot be autoclaved because of their relatively low melting points (i.e., around 60 °C)30.\nUse EtO gas to sterilize polymeric materials sensitive to heat or radiation sterilization.\n3. Cell culture methods\nDirect culture methods\n\tNOTE: The schematic diagram in Figure 2A shows the steps of the direct culture method. In this article, BMSCs were cultured on a Mg-derived plate placed inside the wells of a 12-well tissue-culture-treated plate as an example to illustrate the culture method.",
    "Follow the steps described in steps 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.10 to obtain the cell suspension.\nUse a 90% confluent flask to determine the cell concentration in the cell suspension using a hemocytometer. Dilute the cell suspension using fresh medium to a prescribed cell concentration needed for the cell study in vitro.\n\t\tNOTE: The seeding density of cells is determined by the experimental design. For example, cell densities of 2,000-40,000 cells/cm2 have been used in different cell studies with biodegradable materials.\nPlace the samples (Mg plate) in the center of the 12-well treated tissue-culture plates. Sequentially, rinse the culture plates with 2 mL of PBS and 2 mL of DMEM to calibrate the osmotic pressure under sterile conditions. Add 3 mL of the diluted cell suspension into each well onto the samples of interest.\nCulture the cells in an incubator under standard cell culture conditions for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The culture time may be longer or shorter than 24 h depending on the experimental design.\nDirect exposure cultures\n\tNOTE: The schematic diagram in Figure 2B shows the steps of direct exposure culture.\n\t\nAs described in steps 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, prepare the cell suspension with the required concentrations of cells based on the experimental design for different cell types and intended applications.\nRinse the culture plates with 2 mL of PBS and 2 mL of DMEM sequentially to calibrate the osmotic pressure under sterile conditions. Add 3 mL of the diluted cell suspension into each well. Culture the cells in the humidified incubator under standard cell culture conditions for 24 h or until the cells reach 50-80% confluence.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell confluence level may vary for different cell types and experimental design.\nAfter 24 h, rinse the cells in the well plate with PBS using a pipette to remove floating dead cells.",
    "Place the disinfected or sterilized samples directly on the adhered cells. Add 3 mL of fresh medium into each well.\nCulture the cells under standard cell culture conditions for another 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The culture time may be longer or shorter than 24 h depending on the experimental design.\nExposure cultures\n\tNOTE: The schematic diagram in Figure 2C shows the steps of the exposure culture method.\n\t\nInitial steps for the cell preparation are the same as the exposure culture. As described in steps 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, prepare the cell suspension with the desired cells. Similar to steps 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, seed the cells in the well plate at the desired density and culture them in an incubator under standard cell culture conditions for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, rinse the adherent cells with PBS to remove floating dead cells, followed by the addition of 3 mL of fresh medium into each well.\nAfterwards, place the samples in the well inserts with a membrane pore size of 0.4 µm and place the well inserts with the samples into each well with the cells.\nCulture the cells under standard cell culture conditions for another 24 h.\n\t\t​NOTE: The culture time may be longer or shorter than 24 h depending on the experimental design.\n4. Postculture characterization of cells\nNOTE: For direct culture and direct exposure culture, fix, stain, image, and analyze the cells adherent on both well plates and samples. For exposure culture, analyze the cells adhered to the well-plates.\nCell fixation\n\t\nCollect the postculture medium from each well into a corresponding 15 mL conical tube for further analysis. Collect all the samples after culture for further analysis.\nRinse the cells adherent on both samples and well plates 3 times using PBS.",
    "Add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 10% neutral buffered formalin) into each well plate. Put the lid back on the well plate and allow the PFA to react for 20 min.\nAfter 20 min, aspirate the PFA and dispense it into a waste bottle. Rinse the well plate 3 times using PBS to remove the PFA, and transfer the waste to the waste bottle.\nCell staining\n\t\nPrepare the working stocks of the staining agents following the manufacturers' instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin is used to stain F-actin, and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is used to stain cell nuclei. Staining time may be reduced if the samples degrade rapidly in the staining solutions.\nAdd 200-400 µL of diluted Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin staining agent to each well to cover the cells on the well plate and the sample. Wrap the well plate in aluminum foil to prevent light exposure, and allow the Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin to react for 20 min at room temperature.\nCollect the Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin staining agent and dispense it into the corresponding waste bottle. Rinse the well plate 3 times using PBS to remove the excess Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin, and dispense the used PBS into the corresponding waste bottle.\nAdd 200-400 µL of diluted DAPI to each well to cover the cells in the well and on the sample. Wrap the well plate in aluminum foil and allow the DAPI to react for 5 min at room temperature.\nCollect the DAPI and dispense it into the corresponding waste bottle. Rinse the well plate 3 times using PBS to remove the DAPI, and dispense the used PBS into the corresponding waste bottle.\nCell imaging",
    "After staining, image the cells using a fluorescence microscope. Whenever possible, take phase-contrast images of cells in addition to fluorescence images. Image the cells on the biodegradable samples as soon as possible or immediately after staining to avoid or reduce possible changes caused by the continuous degradation of samples. Store the cells in the well plates in a buffer solution at 2-8 °C after fixation, and image the cells as soon as possible after staining to avoid the loss of fluorescence signals.\nFor direct culture and direct exposure culture, image and evaluate two types of cells: (1) the cells on the samples (in direct contact with the samples) and (2) the cells adherent on the well plate surrounding the samples (indirect contact with the samples), as shown in Figure 3A.\nFor exposure culture, as shown in Figure 3B, use an image guide when taking the fluorescence images of cells to determine if the cell response would be different in response to the dynamic degradation gradient of the samples. Image and analyze the cells located in the area within the inner ring (3.5 mm away from the center) and the outer ring (7 mm away from the center) separately.\n\t\tNOTE: The image guide is used to define the distance between the cells and samples.\nFor each sample and well in the culture plates, randomly take at least five images from each area of interest where the cells are either in direct contact or indirect contact with the samples at a predefined distance.\nImage analysis\n\t\nFor all the cell images obtained from step 4.3, quantify the cell morphology by measuring the cell spreading area and aspect ratio using software such as ImageJ for image analysis.",
    "Count the number of cells in each image area. Calculate the cell adhesion density under direct and indirect contact conditions as the number of cells per unit area.\n5. Postculture analyses of media and samples\nMeasure the pH of postculture medium.\n\tNOTE: Some samples change the pH value of the medium during their degradation. For example, biodegradable metals such as magnesium alloys usually increase the pH value of the medium due to their degradation31. In contrast, biodegradable polymers such as PLGA often decrease the pH value of the medium when they degrade32. Measuring the pH value of postculture medium can indicate the degradation of these samples in vitro.\n\t\nBefore cell fixation, collect the postculture medium as in step 4.1.1.\nMeasure the pH values of the postculture medium in each well immediately after collection, using a precalibrated pH meter.\n\t\tNOTE: The pH of the media may drift over time because of environmental conditions such as CO2 level and temperature, which should be taken into consideration.\nAnalyze the medium compositions for the degradation behavior of biodegradable samples. For some samples that cause a color change of the medium, measure the optical density (O.D.) value of the postculture medium using a spectrophotometer or a microplate reader to determine the degradation behavior. Alternatively, use ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) to analyze the degradation products in the postculture medium.",
    "NOTE: Measuring the degradation products in the post-culture medium is valuable for understanding the degradation behavior of the samples. One of the most common approaches is to measure the ions of interest in the postculture medium using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The ICP-OES can be used to measure the compositions of postculture medium of metals and ceramics but may not be suitable for polymers. Polymers usually consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and accurate quantification of these elements is difficult for ICP-OES.\n\t\nFollowing step 5.1.2 for pH measurement, collect and dilute the medium using a desirable dilution factor for optimal measurements of ion concentrations.\nMeasure the concentrations of the ions of interest in the postculture medium using an ICP-OES.\nPostculture analysis of samples\n\tNOTE: After in vitro cell study, the biodegradable samples may change in dimension, mass, surface morphology, microstructure, and composition. Postculture analysis of samples helps understand the degradation mechanism of samples.\n\t\nAfter cell culture, take the photographs of the samples to show possible changes in sample dimension, color, morphology, and other visible characteristics.\nDry or dehydrate the postculture samples and measure the sample mass, dimension, and volume to quantify any changes in mass, dimension, and volume.\nUse a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to characterize the microstructure and morphology of the samples. Use energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to characterize the composition and phase of the degradation products on the samples. Use FTIR-ATR to detect the chemical bonding on the sample surfaces.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
