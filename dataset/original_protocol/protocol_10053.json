    "All animal experiments were performed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines, with the authorization number: AL/60/67/02/13.\n1. Recipient Preparation\nChemically induce diabetes in recipient rats.\nInject 75 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ, in sterile 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 4) intraperitoneally to rats10.\nNOTE: For the transplantation studies, 6 week-old Lewis strain rats, weighing 150-190 g were used.\nCheck the diabetes status by daily blood glucose measurements during the first four days. Inject long-acting insulin 6 U/day subcutaneously when rats exhibit glycemia over 2 g/L to prevent diabetes complications and weight loss, until insulin pellet implantation. \nInclude rats in the cohort when two measures of tail vein blood glucose are >4-5 g/L for 2 consecutive days, and C-peptide level is <200 pM. Measure glycemia using a glucometer and C-peptidemia by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nImplant insulin pellets under the skin (see 1.2).\nNOTE: Chronic insulin therapy allows better glycemia regulation and avoids diabetic complications (which exacerbate oxidative stress at the transplantation site)11. Furthermore, the therapy conserves the diabetic state along with a normal growth curve (without usual weight loss observed in a diabetic animal). This can result in a bigger omental fat pad, which is ideal for carrying out transplantation.\nImplantation of insulin pellets\nAnesthetize the rat using gas anesthesia (3% isoflurane in 500 mL/min O2) and place the rat in the prone position.\nVerify anesthesia status by checking the absence of reflex (paw pinching). Clean the neck using povidone iodine, and shave the area using a razor blade. Apply povidone iodine again and let it stand for 3 min.",
    "Place 1.5 insulin pellets (3 Units (U)/200 g rat) in a 1:5 diluted povidone iodine solution to sterilize the pellets. Pierce the neck skin using a 16 G trocar and insert the pellet using the furnished guide and stylet. Retrieve the guide and stylet and stitch a single point. Use povidone iodine to clean the stitch.\nNOTE: No post-surgical pain management was necessary as the intervention was comparable to a single subcutaneous (SC) injection.\nLet the rat recover from anesthesia and ensure that rats have access to food to avoid hypoglycemia.\nMeasure the efficiency of pellet by measuring glycaemia decrease after implantation.\nCheck the pellet efficiency by monitoring glycemia level every week for 1 month.\nInclude rats in the cohort when a measure of tail vein blood C peptide level is maintained under 200 pM 1 month after insulin pellet implantation.\nNOTE: Checking C-peptide levels is mandatory to evaluate animals at baseline before transplantation and to confirm their diabetic state. Low C-peptide regeneration always occurs during follow-up. The lowest C-peptidemia is indicative of the lowest regeneration.\n2. hOMING: Intra-omental Matrix Islet Filling\nIslet-matrix mixture preparation.\nPrepare the viscous islet carrier in a laminar flow hood. Dissolve alginate powder in sterile PBS at a concentration of 1.5%. Sterilize the preparation by passage through a 0.22 µm filter. Prepare 400 µL per recipient.\nNOTE: Any kind of hydrogel with a viscosity suitable for injection through a 21 G needle can be used.\nIsolate islet from healthy Lewis rats (200-250 g) as previously described12.\nCount islet number in islet equivalents (IEQ) (one IEQ is considered equivalent to a pancreatic islet with a diameter of 150 µm)13.\nIn a laminar flow hood, prepare aliquots of 7660-islet equivalent (IEQ) in a 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Wash islets aliquots with 500 µL of CMRL (Connaught Medical Research Laboratories) medium free of fetal bovine serum.\nPellet islets by centrifugation (2 min at 500 x g and 4 °C). Discard the supernatant.\nAdd 150 µL of alginate hydrogel carrier over the islets, mix carefully by pipetting up and down and place the mix on ice.\nPrepare an atraumatic 21 G needle and a 1 mL syringe without dead volume by loading 150 µL of empty alginate into the syringe.\nFill the syringe with the mixture of islets and alginate (150 µL, total volume 300 µL). Keep the syringe on ice.\nSurgical procedure\nSterilize surgical instruments using cold sterilization (2% Steranios for 20 min).\nAnesthetize the rat using isoflurane anesthesia and place the rat in the prone position.\nShave the neck area using a razor blade and sterilize the area with povidone iodine. Let the iodine stand for 3 min.\nMake an incision using a scalpel and remove the 1.5 insulin pellets using forceps. Close the skin using one or two single stitch points. Do not remove the rat from anesthesia.\nNOTE: After 1 month, the pellet can be friable as some fibrotic tissue can wrap as pellets; use scissors to properly dissect it.\nPlace the rat in the supine position. Shave and sterilize (with povidone iodine) the peritoneal area. Let the iodine stand for 3 min.\nCreate a 1.5 cm laparotomy just under the sternum using a scalpel. Place wet-sterile gauze around the incised area.\nIdentify the omentum that is the fat pad localized next to stomach. Use forceps to carefully catch the omentum, pull it gently out of the peritoneal cavity, and spread it on the gauze.",
    "NOTE: The omental tissue extends from the spleen to the duodenum and attaches at its mid-point to the stomach. The normal omentum of diabetic rats receiving insulin therapy is approximately 2 cm² when spread on the gauze.\nHydrate the omental tissue well using 2 mL of pre-warmed 37 °C sterile saline. Use small curved forceps to manipulate the tissue and penetrate the omental edge with the needle between the omental layers. Insert the needle entirely.\nStart the injection of the islet preparation slowly and carefully move the needle backward to inject the islets in several places (as lines). Prior to withdrawing the needle, ensure that the hydrogel has stopped exiting the needle to avoid the loss of the dispersed islets.\nRepeat this manipulation as needed to inject the entire contents of the syringe using different entry points to distribute the islets throughout the omental tissue.\nNOTE: In rats, four to five injections are generally needed.\nCheck that islets are not clustered in the syringe at the end of the injections.\nNOTE: If some islets are still visible, it is possible to withdraw the needle from the syringe, fill the syringe directly with 100 µL of empty hydrogel, and reconnect the needle. A second round of injection can be done to flush out the remaining islets.\nUse sterile saline again to hydrate the omental tissue and the wall of the laparotomy. Use forceps to carefully replace omentum in the abdominal cavity.\nInject 2 mL of pre-warmed sterile saline into the abdominal cavity to rehydrate the rat.\nClose the muscle wall using a continuous thread suture. Then stitch the cutaneous layer with single stitch point (point-by-point).\nInject meloxicam (1.5 mg/kg) subcutaneously as an analgesic for 5 days once a day.",
    "Place the rat in a cage on a heating pad until recovery from anesthesia. Repeat the procedure for all the recipient rats.\nMeasure the blood glucose after transplantation every day. If glycemia is >2 g/L, inject 6 U of long-acting insulin subcutaneously once a day.\nAssess graft function by glycemia and c-peptidemia monitoring over 1 or 2 months.\nNOTE: In cases of successful transplantation, glycemia should stabilize within 2-5 days after transplantation, and rats can be taken off insulin.\n3. Omental Graft Explantation\nNOTE: This procedure will permit the confirmation of good graft function. After retrieval of a functional graft, rats should return to a diabetic state. This step is performed after 1 or 2 months of metabolic follow-up.\nAnesthetize the rat with gas anesthesia and place it in the supine position.\nShave the peritoneal area and sterilize it using povidone iodine for 3 min.\nCreate a 1.5 cm laparotomy just under sternum using a scalpel. Place wet-sterile gauze all around the incised area.\nIdentify the omentum, which is next to the stomach. Use forceps to carefully spread it on the gauze.\nUse scissors to excise the omentum. Start from the part that adheres onto the pancreas tail (next to the spleen). If bleeding occurs, use dry sterile gauze to stop it.\nContinue excision along the part attached to the stomach and retrieve the omentum.\nNOTE: At this location, gastroepiploic arteries (Figure 1) can cause a large amount of bleeding if they are accidentally cut. Artery incisions are inevitable to retrieve the graft, but bleeding can be managed using forceps and gauze. If an accidental cut happens, compress firmly with dry gauze and maintain the compression for at least 1 min. The bleeding should stop. If not, use clips or use an electric bistoury to cauterize the vessels.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58898/58898fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Omental artery distribution. For omentum graft explantation, the critical area composed of gastroepiploic arteries is represented in blue. During resection of this part of the omental tissue, attention must be to be paid to the right gastroepiploic artery section. Compression, ligature, or cauterization can be used to limit bleeding.

If not, inject 2 mL of pre-warmed saline, close the rat, and process as previously described.\n  Explanted animals return to a diabetic state. Insulin injection (6 U/SC/day) is then mandatory to assure well-being of animals.\nEuthanize the rat 10 to 12 days after explantation using an overdose of pentobarbital (182.2 mg/kg).\n4. Histological Analysis: Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining\nFix the retrieved omenta using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and embed in paraffin.\nCut sections 4 µm in thickness and apply hematoxylin and eosin stain for morphological evaluation of the transplant.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nDetermine statistical significance using statistical analysis software and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honest significance difference test as a post hoc test. Represent p values as: *p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001."
