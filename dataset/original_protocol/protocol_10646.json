    "1. Plasmid Construction\nNOTE: All genes were amplified under standard PCR reactions using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase per the manufacturer's specifications. Primers used for cloning have been described previously9. All constructs are listed in Table 1.\nTo generate CutA-NpuN (N, Table 1):\n\t\nPCR amplify CutA and NpuN genes from plasmids pET30-CutA-Tip110 and KanR-IntRBS-NpuNC-CFN11, respectively, using the appropriate primers.\nDigest these fragments with the appropriate restriction enzymes and sequentially insert these fragments into the pET26b vector between the T7 promoter and a C-terminal 6xHistidine tag to generate N (Figure 2A).\nTo generate NpuC-S-CutA (C, Table 1):\n\t\nPCR amplify NpuC, CutA and S fragment [AG3(PEG)]10 from plasmid KanR-IntRBS-NpuNC-CFN11, pET30-CutA-Tip110 and pQE9 AC10Atrp12, respectively, using the appropriate primers.\nDigest these fragments with the appropriate restriction enzymes and sequentially insert these fragments into the pET26b vector between T7 promoter and a C-terminal 6xHistidine to generate C (Figure 2B).\nTo generate NpuC-S-SH3lig-CutA (C-SH3lig, Table 1):\n\t\nPCR amplify CutA using primers containing a SH3lig (PPPALPPKRRR) and a flexible linker (GGGGS)2 to generate fragment SH3lig-CutA.\nReplace the CutA gene from C with fragment SH3lig-CutA.\nTo generate SH3-GFP (Table 1):\n\t\nAmplify the SH3 gene from plasmid pJD75713 using the appropriate primers.\nFuse this fragment to the GFP gene and insert it into the pET26b vector between the T7 promoter (Figure 2C) and a C-terminal 6xHistidine tag.\n2. Protein Expression\nTransform 50 μl of chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the appropriate expression plasmid.\nAfter transformation, serially dilute these cells, and plate them on Luria-Bertani (LB)/agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin.\nIncubate plates containing transformed cells at 37 °C for ~15 hr.\nAfter incubation, pick a plate that contains 50-100 colonies and resuspend all colonies in 5 ml of LB broth.",
    "Transfer suspension to 1 L LB broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and grow cells at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Monitor the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600). Grow culture until OD600 ~0.8.\n\t\nFor C and C-SH3lig, induce protein expression by adding isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the culture (1 mM final concentration) and incubate the culture at 37 °C for 4 hr while shaking at 250 rpm.\nFor N and SH3-GFP, cool the culture to ~18 °C by immersing the culture flask in an ice water bath for ~5 min. Induce protein expression by adding IPTG to the culture (1mM final concentration) and incubate the culture at 18 °C for 14-18 hr while shaking at 250 rpm.\nAfter protein expression, centrifuge the culture at 6,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to collect the pellet. Store cell pellet at -80 °C until use.\n3. Protein Purification\nPurification of N (denaturing conditions)\n\t\nResuspend cell pellets in Buffer A (Table 2) at 10 ml/g of wet pellet.\nImmerse the pellet suspension in an ice-water bath and disrupt cells by sonication (Amp 10, with 1 sec pulse and 6 sec pause for 1 min).\nCentrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in Buffer DA (containing 8 M urea) and centrifuge the suspension at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nPass the supernatant through a 5 ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column previously equilibrated with buffer DA.\nWash column with 30 ml of Buffer DA supplemented with 45 mM imidazole. Elute purified protein using 20 ml of Buffer DA supplemented with 150 mM imidazole.\nReduce the urea concentration in the protein sample to <1 mM by either one of the following methods given in 3.1.7.1 or 3.1.7.2:",
    "Dialyze protein in DPBS buffer (Table 2) at 4 °C overnight using tubes with <20 kDa cutoff.\nCentrifuge purified protein in a 30 kDa ultra-filtration spin column at 2,800 x g, 4 °C until the volume is less than 1 ml. Add 14 ml DPBS buffer to the column to dilute the protein sample. Repeat the centrifugation/dilution steps three more times.\nAfter buffer exchange, add dithiothreitol (DTT) to the purified protein (final 2 mM) and concentrate protein to ~100 mg/ml by centrifugation through a 30 kDa ultra-filtration spin column at 2,800 x g, 4 °C.\nAliquot the concentrated protein and store at -80 °C until use.\nPurification of C and C-SH3lig (native condition)\n\t\nResuspend cell pellets in Buffer B (pH 6.0) (Table 2) supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail at 10 ml/g of wet pellet. Use acidic buffer to minimize proteolytic degradation of the target protein.\nDisrupt cell suspension by sonication as described in 3.1.2. Centrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and keep the supernatant.\nPass the soluble lysate through a 5-ml Ni-NTA column previously equilibrated with buffer B.\nWash column with Buffer B supplemented with 45 mM imidazole, and elute the target protein in 20 ml of Buffer B supplemented with 150 mM imidazole.\nFor C, skip to step 3.2.6. For C-SH3lig, carry out an additional ion-exchange purification step to remove partially degraded protein as given in steps 3.2.5.1 to 3.2.5.3\n\t\t\nReduce NaCl concentration in C-SH3lig to <1 mM following the procedure described in 3.1.7.\nLoad the target protein onto a 5 ml anion exchanger beaded agarose matrix column previously equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0).",
    "Elute target protein from the column by running a gradient from a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer to a solution containing the same buffer supplemented with 1 M NaCl. Take samples during protein elution and pool samples with the highest purity based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\nBuffer exchange the purified protein into DPBS buffer, as described in 3.1.7.\nAdd DTT to the purified protein (final concentration 2 mM) and concentrate the protein to ~100 mg/ml using a 30 kDa ultra-filtration spin column as described in 3.1.8. Aliquot and store concentrated protein at -80 °C until use.\nPurification of SH3-GFP\n\t\nResuspend cell pellets using Buffer A at 10 ml/g of wet pellet.\nDisrupt pellet suspension by sonication as described in 3.1.2.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant.\nPass the supernatant (soluble lysate) through a 5-ml Ni-NTA column previously equilibrated with Buffer A.\nWash column with 30 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 45 mM imidazole. Elute purified protein using 20 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 150 mM imidazole.\nBuffer exchange the purified protein into DPBS buffer using an approach similar to that described in 3.1.7 and concentrate the protein to ~150 mg/ml using a 30 kDa ultra-filtration spin column as described in 3.1.8.\nAliquot and store purified protein at -80 °C until use.\nSDS-PAGE analysis of purified samples containing CutA\n\t\nDilute each purified protein in double-distilled water to reduce the concentration of NaCl to ~1 mM. At this NaCl concentration, most of the CutA trimer proteins run as monomers on the SDS-PAGE gels.",
    "Mix samples with 2x SDS sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% Glycerol, 10% w/v SDS, 0.1 % w/v bromo-phenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), incubated at 95 °C for 5 min.\nLoad the samples onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Carry out electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 200 V for ~50 min.\nObserve protein in the gels by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 following the standard protocols (Figure 1C).\n4. Hydrogel Formation\nNOTE: the sample hydrogels made in this study contain 1.6 mM of each hydrogel building block unless noted otherwise. This protein concentration yields a soft and stable hydrogel. CAUTION: Sodium azide (NaN3) is added to the hydrogel to a final concentration of 0.5% w/v to prevent bacterial contamination. NaN3 is highly toxic and must be handled with extreme care as indicated in the Material Safety Data Sheet.\nCalculate the volume for each of the concentrated proteins needed to achieve a final concentration of 1.6 mM in a 100 μl sample hydrogel. For example:\n\tConcentration of N: 100 mg/ml\n\tMolecular weight of N: 26.3 kDa (refer to Table 1)\n\tDesired Volume: 100 μl Desired Concentration: 1.6 mM\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51202/book.JPG\nTo make a 100 μl hydrogel (1.6 mM), mix C (x μl, volume calculated according to 4.1) with 5% NaN3 (10 μl), 100 mM DTT (5 μl) and N (y μl, volume calculated according to 4.1) inside a 2 ml glass vial.\nAdd DPBS buffer ((85 - x - y) μl) to the vial to achieve a final volume of 100 μl, and manually mix all the components via a swirling motion using a pipette tip. Note: The solution becomes very viscous upon mixing.\nCentrifuge the mixture for 2 min at 8,000 x g to remove the air bubbles.",
    "Incubate the mixture at room temperature overnight to allow the intein trans-splicing reaction to reach completion. Confirm hydrogel formation by turning tube upside down. The proteins will not flow if a hydrogel is formed.\nEstimate the intein trans-splicing yield by checking samples (0.5 μl each) collected before step 4.2 and after step 4.5 on a SDS-PAGE gel, as described in 3.4 (Figure 1C).\n5. Immobilization of GFP via Docking Protein (DP) and Docking Station Peptide (DSP) Interaction\nTo make a 50 μl GFP-functionalized hydrogel (1.2 mM), combine C-SH3lig (x μl, calculated according to 4.1) and SH3-GFP (y μl, calculated according to 4.1) at 1:1 molar ratio in a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd 5% NaN3 (5 μl), 100 mM DTT (2.5 μl), (42.5 - x - y) μl DPBS to the same tube. Add N (y μl, calculated according to 4.1) to achieve a 1:1 molar ratio of N and C-SH3lig. Mix the sample by using a pipette tip by a swirling motion.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 8,000 x g for 2 min and incubate the mixture at room temperature overnight in the dark. A hydrogel encapsulating SH3-GFP forms during incubation.\n6. Use of 1.6 mM Hydrogel as an Immobilization Scaffold for Enzymatic Reaction in Organic Solvent\nUse the HRP as a model enzyme. Prepare a stock solution of HRP (28 mg/ml or 0.63 mM) in DPBS.\nTo make a 30 μl hydrogel (1.6 mM) entrapping HRP, combine C (x μl, calculated according to 4.1) with HRP (2 μl), 5% NaN3 (3 μl) and DTT (1.5 μl of 100 mM) inside a 1.7 ml centrifuge tube.",
    "Add N (y μl, calculated according to 4.1) and DPBS (23.5 - x - y) μl. Mix with a pipette tip with a swirling motion.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 8,000 x g for 2 min and incubate at room temperature overnight.\n\tCAUTION: the regents used for the following activity assay are highly toxic. Use specific safety recommendations by the corresponding Material Safety Data Sheets.\nFor enzymatic reaction, submerge the hydrogel in 1 ml of reaction cocktail containing N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine (5.8 mM), phenol (5.8 mM) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (2.9 mM) in n-heptane14. Manually disrupt the gel using a pipette tip to increase the contact surface area of the hydrogel and the solvent.\nDetect HRP product, an indophenol-type dye, by measuring the optical absorbance of samples taken at different times at 546 nm in a plate reader (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
