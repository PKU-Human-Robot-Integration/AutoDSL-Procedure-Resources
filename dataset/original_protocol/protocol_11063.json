    "The protocol describes the preparation of a sufficient quantity of tumor spheroids to mount one 24-well plate (approximately 240-360 spheroids or 10-15 spheroids/well) at 200 µL of agarose gel per well and 500 µL of clearing solution per well. The complete procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.\n1. 2% agarose-PBS gel preparation\nWeigh 0.5 g of low-melting agarose (see Table of Materials) in a glass bottle and add 25 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nMelt the agarose by boiling the solution in a microwave for 30-60 s with the lid closed but not sealed and with constant swirling. Ensure agarose is fully dissolved and the solution does not boil over.\n\tNOTE: Gel can be stored at room temperature; check the volume before use to account for evaporation. Bring to the liquid state (microwave; 20-60 s with swirling) before using.\n2. Preparation of the clearing solution\nWeigh 9 g of N,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis(2-Hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine, 22 g of urea, 44 g of sucrose, 0.1 g of Triton X-100, and 24.9 g of deionized water (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: It is easier to weigh the approximate amount of N,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis(2-Hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine and adjust the weight of other components to obtain the desired concentration.\nHeat the solution in a 56 °C water bath with constant mixing and continue till all the crystals dissolve.\nRest the solution at room temperature to allow the bubbles formed during mixing to rise to the surface. The solution is stable at room temperature for up to 2 months.\n3. Spheroid preparation\nGenerate spheroids using the agarose overlay method as previously described1,3,14.\n\tNOTE: Spheroids generated by other methods are also compatible with this imaging protocol.\nCut the tip of a 1 mL pipette tip using a scalpel to enlarge the orifice.",
    "NOTE: All spheroids were handled with 1 mL or 200 µL pipettes with cut tips.\nUsing the pipette, aspirate the spheroids from the wells and transfer them to a clear 1.5 mL conical tube. Multiple spheroids from the same conditions can be combined in the same tube.\n\tNOTE: Always allow the spheroids to settle to the bottom of the tube to aspirate the medium.\nWash the spheroids in 1 mL PBS twice, add neutral 4% pre-warmed paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution, and incubate the spheroids at 37 °C for 20 min.\nRemove the PFA solution and wash the spheroids twice with 1 mL of PBS.\n4. Spheroid staining\nUsing a pipette, transfer up to 15 spheroids into a 200 µL PCR tube.\n\tNOTE: For fragile spheroids, mount the spheroids in gel (steps 5.1-5.4) before proceeding.\nPermeabilize the cells using 200 µL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Place PCR tubes inside 50 mL screw-cap tubes and incubate the spheroids for 2 h at room temperature with mild agitation.\n\tNOTE: All incubations are done with agitation on a rotor, roller, or shaker (see Table of Materials) unless specified otherwise. This is important to achieve uniform staining. Fixed spheroids in PBS can sometimes stick to the sides of the pipette tip. Rinsing the tip in 0.5% Triton X-100 minimizes the spheroids from sticking to the tips.\nReplace the solution (step 4.2) with 200 µL of Antibody dilution buffer (ABDIL)15 and incubate overnight at room temperature.\nRemove ABDIL, add 75 µL of primary antibody in ABDIL, and incubate at 4 °C for 2.5 days.\nRemove the supernatant and wash with 200 µL of PBS with 0.1% Tween and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-TT) twice and incubate with 200 µL of PBS-TT for 4 h at room temperature.",
    "Remove PBS-TT, add 100 µL of secondary antibody in ABDIL, and incubate at 4 °C for 2.5 days.\n\tNOTE: DAPI or other nuclear dye can be added at this stage. Most dyes require less incubation time than antibodies.\nRemove the supernatant and wash with 200 µL of PBS-TT twice and incubate with 200 µL of PBS-TT for 4 h. The spheroids are ready for mounting.\n5. Mounting\nUsing a 200 µL pipette, transfer fixed and stained spheroids to 500 µL PCR tubes at one tube per condition (approximately 10-15 spheroids).\nReplace the solution with 200 µL of 2% (w/v) liquid agarose gel and centrifuge on the quick spin (at the fixed maximum speed, see Table of Materials) at room temperature for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: Unless mounting immediately, place in a heating block at 50 °C to avoid gel hardening.\nAspirate the spheroids in ~50 µL liquid agarose gel and dispense in well of a 24-well glass-bottom plate.\nBefore the gel hardens, separate the spheroids using a pipette tip in the surrounding gel, and ensure the spheroids are covered with gel. Optionally, place the plate on ice to rapidly set the gel.\n\tNOTE: The number of spheroids per well depends on the size of the spheroids. Spheroids are placed far away from each other so that only one spheroid enters the field of view while imaging. This is important for automated image processing.\nAdd 500 µL of clearing solution (step 2) per well, ensuring the gel is submerged. Incubate at RT for at least 24 h and image the spheroids in the clearing solution. Spheroids are stable in this solution for up to a month at room temperature and when protected from evaporation.\n6. Imaging",
    "Choose an objective with a working distance long enough to encompass the entire spheroid, including the mounting height of the spheroid in the vessel.\n\tNOTE: Objectives with a working distance of 3 mm or longer are required to image the equatorial plane of the spheroids. Higher magnification objectives with higher NA can allow for better resolution, but will limit the maximum depth at which the spheroids can be imaged.\nTo identify the equatorial plane, adjust the focus till the largest surface area is reached in the XY plane and image with the required laser power percentage, detector voltage, gain, and offset settings.\n\tNOTE: The laser power percentage, detector voltage, gain, and offset will vary greatly depending on the fluorophore, staining intensity, laser intensity, detector sensitivity, etc.\nFor 3D images, set the start and end of the spheroids, and choose appropriate signal intensity at various z-depth using z intensity correction settings before imaging.\n\tNOTE: For best image resolution, use the Nyquist sampling rate for x, y, and z (for details, see reference16)."
