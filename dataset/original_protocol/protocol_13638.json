  "procedures": [
    "All procedures used in the present study followed the \"Principles of Laboratory Animal Care\" in agreement with the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the Committee on Ethics and Animal Use in the Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri (UFVJM-protocol number 031/2016). Refer to the Table of Materials for details about all materials used in this protocol.\n1. Experimental design\nUse 48 male, 60-day-old Wistar rats weighing 250 g, on average.\nRandomly divide the rats into three groups: untrained (UN; n = 16); HIIT performed with single daily sessions (1-HIIT; n = 16); and HIIT performed with three daily sessions (3-HIIT; n = 16).\nHouse the rats in individual cages in a controlled environment (22-23 °C, 50% humidity) with an inverted 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 p.m.) with free access to standard laboratory food pellets and water.\nFamiliarize the rats with the treadmill one week prior to initiating the exercise training protocol.\nWeigh the rats using a precision electronic digital weighing scale 48 h before and 48 h after the training protocol.\nPerform the VO2max test with the rats of all groups 48 h before the initialization of the HIIT protocols, at the end of the 4th week of training (to adjust the running velocity), and 48 h after the HIIT protocols.\nEuthanize the rats 24 h after the last VO2max test by i.p. injection of 400 I.U. heparin, and remove and weigh the hearts and left ventricles (see step 5).\n2. Familiarization with the treadmill equipment\nSet the inclination of the treadmill to 0° (flat).\nTurn on the treadmill.\nAdjust the treadmill knob to the speed of 6 m/min.\nAdjust the treadmill shock switch to 0.25 mA.",
    "Hold the animal by the tail and place it on the treadmill for 10 min at 8:00 a.m.\nRepeat this procedure for five consecutive days.\n3. VO2max test\nSoftware adjustments (Figure 1)\n\t\nOpen the Metabolism software.\nClick file to open a new record.\nIn the kind of cages parameter, select Treadmill, 1 cage, and in switching time, select 2 (min).\nIn experiment, select oxymetry | new.\nPress on to enter the number identification and the weight of the animal. Identify the project data. Go to the treadmill controller and set the test parameters.\n\t\t\nStart the test with a velocity of 5 m/min.\nAdjust the treadmill shock switch to 0.25 mA. Press start.\nClick on accept.\nClose the treadmill's acrylic cover.\nEnter the calibration gas reference values.\n\t\tNOTE: The gas reference values are 0 mmHg (CO2) and 20 mmHg (O2). These values are indicated by the manufacturer.\nWait for 10 min.\nTest\n\t\nTurn on the treadmill.\nAdjust the treadmill knob to the speed of 3 m/min.\nAdjust the treadmill shock switch to 0.25 mA.\nSet the inclination of the treadmill to 0° (flat).\nHold the animal by the tail and place it on the treadmill and close the treadmill's acrylic cover.\nIncrease the treadmill speed by 3 m/min every 2 min until exhaustion (established when the animal touches the bottom of the bay five times within 1 min).\nRemove the animal from the treadmill and place it in its cage.\nRecord the maximal velocity (Vmax) reached by the animal.\n\t\tNOTE: For the VO2max calculation, the software calculates the difference between inhaled O2 and exhaled CO2 by the animal at the Vmax, and the final calculation is performed according to the individual body weight of each rat.\n4. HIIT protocols (Figure 2)\nTurn on the treadmill.",
    "Adjust the treadmill knob to the speed of 50% Vmax (warm-up).\nAdjust the treadmill shock switch to 0.25 mA.\nSet the inclination of the treadmill to 0° (flat).\nHold the animal by the tail and place it on the treadmill for 3 min.\nRemove the animal from the treadmill and adjust the treadmill knob to the corresponding velocity of the week (week 1: 85% Vmax; weeks 2-3: 90% Vmax; weeks 4-5: 95% Vmax; weeks 6-8: 100% Vmax).\nPlace the animal on the treadmill for 1 min.\n\t\nEnsure that both HIIT groups exercise 5 days/week for 8 weeks: the 1-HIIT group must perform single daily sessions of 6 bouts of 1 min interspersed with 1 min of passive recovery, and the 3-HIIT group must perform three shorter daily sessions of 2 bouts of 1 min interspersed with 1 min of passive recovery with an interval of 4 h between the bouts.\nFor the 3-HIIT group, perform the training sessions at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m.\nDivide the 1-HIIT group into three groups starting the training sessions at the same hour (i.e., 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m.) as the 3-HIIT group to eliminate any possible circadian effect on exercise training adaptations.\nEnsure that the UN group is placed on the treadmill one day per week for 10 min at a speed of 10 m/min in the same room where the HIIT groups are exercising.\nRemove the animal from the treadmill and place it in its cage for 1 min (passive recovery).\n5. Euthanasia and heart weight record\nAfter an i.p. injection of 400 I.U. heparin, euthanize the rat by decapitation with a guillotine.\nCarefully open the thorax of the rat, remove the heart, wash it with saline solution, weigh it, separate the left ventricle and weigh it.",
    "Discard the animal's carcass in the appropriate freezer.\n6. Statistical analysis\nExpress all data as mean ± standard deviation.\nCheck the normality of data using the Shapiro-Wilk test.\nAnalyze the data using one- or two-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test; set the significance level at 5%."
