    "1. Cell Culture and Transfection\nSH-SY5Y cell culture\n\tNOTE: The experiments have been performed using the human neuroblastoma SH- SY5Y (ATCC# CRL-2266)15. SH-SY5Y cells grow as a mixture of floating clusters and adherent cells. Follow the instructions reported in the protocol (cell density, splitting ratio, etc.) to have cells that grow firmly attached to glass cover, which is crucial for TIRFM.\n\t\nBefore starting, under the laminar flow biosafety cabinet, make the opportune volume of sterile phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS) and culture medium.\n\t\t\nMake 50 ml of PBS with concentrations of 150 mM NaCl, 24 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Filter the solution.\nMake 50 ml of cell medium from Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), and sodium pyruvate (1 mM). Filter the solution.\nRemove complete growth medium and wash the cells with 3 ml of PBS.\nIncubate cells with 2 ml of 0.05% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (for 6 cm Petri dish) for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and detach cells using pipette.\nInactivate trypsin by adding 2 ml of DMEM, and collect cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant, add 1 ml of DMEM to the pellet and pipette the solution up and down sufficiently to disperse cells into a single cell suspension.\nSplit them 1:4 in a new 6 cm diameter Petri dish containing 3 ml of complete medium. Maintain cells in culture in 6 cm diameter Petri dishes, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Sub-culture once a week or when they have covered 80 - 90% of the surface area.\nSH-SY5Y cell plating for imaging",
    "For TIRFM experiments, plate cells onto glass covers. Employ glass covers with 0.17 ± 0.005 mm thickness and a 1.5255 ± 0.00015 refractive index. Before starting, prepare the glass coverslips as follow:\n\t\t\nClean glass covers with 90% ethanol, O/N.\nRinse them thoroughly in distilled water (three changes of distilled water). Dry glass covers in a drying oven.\nPlace covers in glass Petri dishes and sterilize in a preheated oven at 200 °C for 3 hr.\nThe day before transfection, place each coverslip in a 3.5 cm Petri dish, add 1 ml of culture medium and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nTrypsinize cells as described in steps 1.1.3 - 1.1.5, suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of complete medium and count. Calculate the correct volume of cell suspension to add to each Petri dish to yield 3 x 105 cells/well. This density is required for optimal cell growth and efficient transfection. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator O/N.\nSH-SY5Ytransfection by polyethylenimine (PEI)\n\tNOTE: To visualize synaptic vesicles dynamics, pCB6 vector containing synapto-pHluorin has been used. The synapto-pHluorin has been generated by in frame fusion of a pH-sensitive variant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)16 and the vesicular membrane protein synaptobrevin 2. The construct has been extensively employed to investigate synaptic vesicle properties within neurons9.\n\t\nBefore starting transfection, make 10 ml of the following solutions. Keep the solutions as maximal as 1 month.\n\t\t\nMake a 150 mM NaCl solution. Adjust to pH 5.5 with 0.01 N HCl.\nMake a PEI solution at 10% polyethylenimine (PEI; 25 kDa linear) in 150 mM NaCl solution. The pH of solution rises to 8.8. Adjust pH to 7.8 with 0.01 N HCl.",
    "24 hr after plating, remove the medium and refresh with 1.5 ml of complete medium. Keep the cells at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nUnder the laminar flow biosafety cabinet, in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, add 3 µg of plasmid DNA to 25 μl of 150 mM NaCl solution and 100 μl of PEI solution per 3.5 cm Petri dish.\nVortex for 10 sec, then incubate the DNA/PEI mixture for 30 min at RT.\nCarefully add the DNA/PEI mixture to the Petri dish containing coverslips with cells and gently shake to equally distribute the reagent in the Petri dish.\nAfter 4 hr change the medium and incubate the cells O/N at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Perform imaging experiments 24 - 48 hr after transfection.\n2. Cell Imaging by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM)\nImaging set-up\nPerform TIRF imaging with the set-up described in Figure 1. It comprises a motorized inverted microscope (Figure 1, inset A), the laser source (Figure 1, inset B) and the TIRF-slider (Figure 1, inset C). Reach TIRFM illumination through a high numerical aperture (NA 1.45 Alpha Plan-Fluar) 100X oil, immersion objective.\nFor TIRFM illumination, employ a multi-line (458/488/514 nm) 100 mW argon-ion laser. Using a mono mode fiber, introduce the linearly polarized laser light into the beam path, via the TIRF slider. Insert the TIRF slider into the luminous field diaphragm plane of the reflected-light beam path.\n\t\t\nFor wide field illumination, connect the microscope to a conventional mercury short-arc lamp HBO white light. A polarization-maintaining double prism in the slider ensures the simultaneous combination of TIRF illumination and white light.",
    "Filter the laser light with an excitation filter (band width 488/10 nm) mounted on a filter wheel, introduced into the laser path. Employ a high speed, software-controlled, shutter to allow fast control of laser illumination. For pHluorin analysis, mount a band pass 525/50 nm emission filter. Capture digital images (512 x 512 pixels) on a cooled Fast CCD camera with the Image ProPlus software.\nAchieving TIRF illumination (Figure 2)\nTurn on the lasers, the computer, the camera, the filter wheel, and the shutter controllers; then, wait 20 min before starting the experiment as the lasers need to warm up and stabilize.\nBefore imaging, make the opportune volume of the following solutions.\n\t\t\nMake 50 ml of Krebs (KRH) solution at 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (buffered to pH 7.4), 2 mM CaCl2, and 6 mM glucose.\nMake 10 ml of KCl-KRH solution (pH 7.4) at 80 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM HEPES (buffered to pH 7.4), 2 mM CaCl2, and 6 mM glucose.\nRemove the glass cover with transfected cells and insert it in the appropriate imaging chamber. Assemble the chamber and add 500 µl of KRH solution in the center of the glass.\nAdd oil over the objective. Place the imaging chamber on the stage of the microscope and position the objective under the glass coverslip. Position the safe cover over the sample.\nIn epifluorescence mode, focus on the coverslip (upper surface) and choose transfected cells placed in the chamber center. Select cells whose fluorescent signal can be clearly recorded using an exposure time below 80 msec.\nUnder software control, switch to TIRF illumination in live mode.",
    "To set the TIRF configuration, check the position of the beam that emerges out of the objective, on the sample cover (Figure 2B). When the beam is positioned in the center of the objective lens (Figure 2A, left), a spot is visible in the center of the TIRF sample cover (Figure 2B, left) and the cell is imaged in epifluorescence mode (several focus planes, high background fluorescence; Figure 2C, left).\nTo reach the critical angle, move the focused spot in the Y direction (forward or backward; Figure 2B, center) using the angle adjustment screw on the TIRF slider (Figure 1C). When the beam converges on the sample plane at an angle larger than the critical angle (Figure 2A, right), the spot disappears and a straight, thin, focused line is evident in the middle of the sample cover (Figure 2B, right).\nTo fine-tune the TIRF angle use the cell sample (Figure 2C). Watch the fluorescence image on the video, at this stage, an epifluorescence-like image is still visible. Gently, move the screw until TIRF condition is achieved: only one optical plane of the cell is in focus (i.e., the plasma membrane in contact with the cover-slip), this results in a flat image with high contrast (Figure 2C, right).\nSample imaging\nSet the single-channel time-lapse experiment. To minimize photobleaching, capture the image using low exposure time and high gain. Appropriate exposure times are between 40 - 80 msec. Acquire images at 1 - 2 Hz sampling frequency. Vesicle kinetics may be better appreciated sampling at higher frequency (10 Hz). The regular time of observation is usually 2 min.\nAdd 500 µl of KRH solution and record cells in TIRFM mode. This is the resting condition. Save the time sequential images.",
    "Focus on the same cell and record under the same conditions of resting (laser power, time exposure, frame number). After five frames, add 500 µl of KCl-KRH solution and keep KCl in the chamber. This is the stimulated condition; save the time sequential images.\n3. Image Analysis and Data Processing\nNOTE: To analyze images, macros have been developed in the lab, based on existing functions of the image analysis software; similar macros are available online (URL provided in Table of Materials and Equipment).\nFluorescence intensity quantification\nUse a “Sequence fluorescence intensity” macro for fluorescence intensity quantification in a region of interest (ROI) of the image, over the course of the movie.\nOpen the time-sequential images. Go to the macro menu and select 'Sequence fluorescence intensity'. In the 'Analysis' window appears “select the ROI”.\nChoose one of the selection tools in the menu to create the ROI. Place 3 ROIs in regions of the cell membrane without spots (background ROI). Employ this “background ROI” to evaluate the photobleaching and to set the threshold for fusion event analysis (Figure 3A).\nPhotobleaching correction and threshold determination (Figure 3B)\nTo evaluate the photobleaching, open the fluorescence intensity rows “background ROIs”, (Figure 3Ba). Normalize the fluorescence intensity values in each frame to the initial intensity value (F0) (F/F0) (Figure 3Bb). Average the values.\nHighlight the average data and create a line plot using the chart menu options.\nFrom the data analysis menu, select “trendline” to open the plot analysis dialog. Select the type of regression. Set “exponential” regression. Then select “display equation on chart”. In the graph window, the exponential equation appears and the parameter values are automatically assigned, (Figure 3Bc).\nApply the exponential correction to the intensity values in each frame as follow:\n\t\tFn (corrected) = Fn / exp(-n * a)",
    "Fn = experimental fluorescence intensity measured at frame n; n = number of frames; a = bleaching factor (constant expressing the rate of intensity loss due to photobleaching; Figure 3Bd).\nTo set the threshold, open a normalized and corrected “background ROI”, calculate the average fluorescence signal and its standard deviation (SD). The average value plus 3 SD represents the threshold (Figure 3Be). Use this threshold for data analysis.\nSelection of fusion events using a semiautomatic procedure\nOpen the time-sequential images with image analysis software. Apply a Gaussian filter to the active image sequence.\nAnalyze images using the tool “count objects” or a macro which allows the selection of an object whose pixels have average fluorescence intensity within a defined range. Set the intensity range manually, using the threshold function (go to the bar menu, set measure → threshold to highlight the area of interest). An adequate threshold is 30% over the local fluorescent background signal.\nApply a macro “Filters objects” to select only objects meeting the following criteria:\n\t\t\nApply ranges option (min and max inclusive) for aspect. Aspect reports the ratio between the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipse equivalent to the object. Aspect is always ≥1. Adequate values are min = 1, max = 3.\nApply ranges for diameter. Diameter reports the average length of the diameters measured at two degree intervals joining two outline points and passing through the centroid of the object. Set the range in pixels (or in µm, if using a calibrated system).\nDefine the optimal range in preliminary experiments: select manually the spots of interest and then measure their diameter using the plot profile function.\nSelect “display objects”: selected objects will appear superimposed to the TIRFM image (Figure 4B).",
    "Include in the analysis only those spots that show a short (one to three frames) transient increase in fluorescence intensity, immediately followed by a marked loss of signal (transient spots). Employ the circular selection to create a ROI approximately one-spot diameter radially around the selected vesicle/spots (experimental ROIs). Perform this step manually.\nWith the ROIs selected, calculate the average fluorescence intensity of each ROI over the course of the movie.\nData analysis (Figure 3C-D)\nExport the time-course of the fluorescence changes measured in each “experimental ROI” to a spreadsheet; (Figure 3Da). Normalize the intensity value in each frame to the initial fluorescence intensity (F/F0), (Figure 3Db).\nApply the exponential correction to the intensity values in each frame as reported in step 3.2.4 (Figure 3Dc).\nTo calculate the total number of fusion events (peak number), the time each fusion occurs (peak width) and the amplitude of fluorescent peak (peak height and AUC) apply logical functions using spreadsheet or math packages. An example of fusion event analysis using logical formulas is reported in Figure 3Dd and 3De.\nAssume the increase of fluorescence intensity exceeding the threshold (average background fluorescence intensity ± 3SD) as vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane and the resulting peak as a fusion event.\nCalculate the peak width as difference between the last and the first x value of each peak. Multiply this value for 1 / (sampling frequency). Consider this value as the time of vesicle fusion and adhesion at the plasma membrane before vesicle re-acidification and recycling (Figure 3Dd).\nCalculate the whole-cell AUC as a sum of values over threshold. Consider this value as net fluorescent change during the recording time due to the spontaneous (resting) or evoked (stimulated) synaptic activity.",
    "Calculate the peak height as the difference between the maximal y value of each peak and the threshold. Consider this value as indicative of the fusion type (single vs. simultaneous/sequential fusion or transient vs. full fusion).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
