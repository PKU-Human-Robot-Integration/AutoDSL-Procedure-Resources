    "NOTE: Ethics Statement: All procedures conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press, 8th edition, 2011),  and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin. All surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (through inhaling, flow rate 2 ml/min), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Animals were euthanized in a chamber gradually filled with CO2.\n1. Induction of General Anesthesia and Skin Incision\nUse male C57BL/6 mice with an age of 12–16 weeks and weight of 23–28 g. Anesthetize the animal by isoflurane through a closed-circuit anesthetic apparatus. Confirm proper anesthetization by pinching its toe. Apply some artificial tears ointment on eyes to prevent dryness.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position with the left hind limb slightly abducted and the knee joint slightly flexed. Shave the hair around the left upper thigh region and disinfect the skin with Chlorhexidine, applied three times using sterile cotton tipped applicators. Use a hot bead sterilizer to keep the instruments sterilized during the surgery.\nPlace a sterilized gauze drape over the left leg. Make a 1.5 cm straight, longitudinal skin incision on the left medial thigh from the knee joint to the groin (Figure 1A).\n2. Exposure of Femoral Artery and Branches\nNOTE: Figure 1B shows the gross vasculature anatomy in the upper thigh. The superficial femoral artery (SFA) can be observed through a dissecting microscope when the skin incision is properly made along the midline of the medial thigh.\nOpen up the thin fascia overlying the SFA with fine tweezers and then loop the SFA with 9-0 nylon suture.",
    "NOTE: In this process, the femoral nerve is easily put aside, but the adjacent femoral vein requires close attention because its wall is so thin that it easily perforates and bleeds. The key technique is to focus on the artery itself; as long as the dissection is carried out close to the artery, any accidental vein damage is avoidable.\nOnce the SFA is looped, hold the suture with mosquito forceps and pull it slightly downward. This maneuver makes further dissection easier, but to avoid damaging the artery do not pull too forcefully.\nContinue dissecting the artery proximally to expose and loop the common femoral artery (CFA) with 9-0 nylon suture.\n\tNOTE: Usually, looping the CFA at a point distal to the epigastric artery (Figure 1B) is enough for wire insertion. Hold the CFA suture loop with mosquito forceps in the same way.\nPull the CFA suture loop upward and the SFA suture loop downward to uncover the bifurcation of SFA and deep femoral artery (DFA). The DFA, the major branch of the CFA, goes toward the thigh muscle (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: The wire will be inserted from the DFA later.\nLoop the DFA with extra caution because the adjacent vein is tangled beneath the artery. In case of bleeding from the vein, a 30- to 60 sec simple compression with gauze is usually sufficient to produce hemostasis.\nOnce the DFA is looped with 9-0 nylon suture, make sure all three suture loops are at their correct positions (Figure 2A).\nProceed with the dissection of the DFA distally to ligate the artery at a point as far as possible from the bifurcation. Cut extra suture but leave a certain length so that the two ends can be held with mosquito forceps, which stabilize the DFA making the wire insertion easier.",
    "3. Creating Wire Injury\nInsert Wire via DFA\n\t\nStrain the CFA, SFA, and DFA sutures to establish a temporary hemostat.\nMake a small hole in the DFA with microscissors. Insert the tips of the curved microtweezers to dilate the hole large enough for a wire with a 0.015 inch diameter (Figure 2B demonstrates the size difference between the artery and the wire).\n\t\t\nBefore making a hole in the DFA, loosen the CFA suture loop and gently clamp/squeeze the DFA several times with dull-tipped microtweezers. This maneuver expands the arterial diameter remarkably to ease the wire insertion. Moistening the wire thoroughly with PBS is also important for a smooth insertion.\nWhen making a hole in the DFA, do not crop the arterial wall, but make a small v-shaped nip and pinch the flap with sharp-tipped microtweezers for manipulation.\nInsert the wire through the adequately-dilated hole on the DFA. Gently advance the wire toward the iliac artery while loosening the suture loop around the CFA. 5–8 mm is enough to cover all the CFA length in most cases (Figure 2C). Do not insert the wire forcefully as an arterial perforation usually results in loss of the mouse. Shortening the wire to about 15-mm in length helps with handling.\nLeave Wire inside for 1 Min\n\t\nAfter inserting the wire to the optimal length, leave it for 1 min to overstretch the arterial wall. Moisten the wire and arteries with PBS to prevent drying. Another 9-0 nylon suture can be placed around the DFA proximal to the wire-insertion point during this waiting time. This suture will be used later to close the hole on the DFA following removal of the wire.\nRetrieve Wire and Resume the Blood Flow",
    "Hold the wire with vessel cannulation forceps, and pull it back gently; the wire should be retrieved smoothly. To overcome any resistance, usually caused by adherence of the wire to the arterial wall, pulling back the wire with gentle rotation is helpful. Again, a forceful maneuver could result in animal loss.\nAfter retrieving the wire, ligate the DFA at the point of bifurcation with 9-0 nylon suture. Do not ligate too close to the bifurcation, which would jeopardize the blood outflow to the SFA.\nLoosen the SFA and CFA suture loops to resume the normal blood flow. Note that the CFA is well-expanded by wire insertion (Figure 2D).\n4. Skin Closure and Postoperative Care\nControl bleeds. Minor oozing can be stopped by simple compression; some major arterial bleeds will require stitches with a 11-0 nylon suture. These sutured arteries will eventually result in arterial occlusion.\nClose the skin wound with skin staplers (usually 3–4 staples). Keep the wound area sterilized by applying Chlorhexidine surgical solution.\nApply post-surgery treatments. Control the pain of the mouse with subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine. Keep the mouse on the warming pad until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. House it in a clean cage without company of other animals until fully recovered.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
