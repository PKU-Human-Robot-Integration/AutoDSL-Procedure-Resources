    "Preparation of the cellsGrow the cells of interest in the recommended culture media at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air.The day before the experiment, remove media from the cells and wash with PBS (see Recipes). Add appropriate volume of trypsin (1-2 ml for 100 mm Petri dish or T-75 flask). Incubate at 37 °C for 2 to 15 min. Note: The incubation time varies between cell lines. Incubate until you can see the cells detaching from the surface.Add complete media to the cells to inhibit the trypsin.Note: The volume of media to add to the cells depends on the number of samples to be created. Keep in mind that you have to divide this volume by the number of samples you want to create. Pipette the cells into 60 mm Petri dishes with a total of about 5 to 6 ml of media. Notes: The number of plates needed depends on the kind of experiment you want to perform. You always need at least one Petri plate for negative control, but it is better to have all samples in triplicate. You will need three plates for each time point or three plates for each daunorubicin concentrations to be tested.You must seed your cells so the confluence on the day of the experiment is below 50% as higher confluence will artificially reduce daunorubicin uptake.Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air.Treatment of the cells with daunorubicinRemove the culture media from the cells. Note: Cells can be washed, but this does not seem to affect the overall results. However, if cells were treated with additional compounds prior to daunorubicin treatment, a washing step with UB should be added.Add 5 ml of UB to the cells.Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air for at least 5 min.",
    "Prepare a daunorubicin dilution of 255 µM in UB by diluting the stock concentration of 8.87 mM by 35-fold.Add 100 µl of 255 µM daunorubicin to the 5 ml of UB to have a final concentration of 5 μM. Notes:  To test different concentrations of daunorubicin, add the required volume of diluted daunorubicin keeping in mind to adjust the volume of UB added to the cells before. Trying various concentrations may be a good thing in order to determine the best concentration for your experiment. The reference concentration should be 5 µM.Keep in mind that you will need an untreated cell sample for all the manipulations.Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air for the required time. Note: Daunorubicin uptake can be detected after a few minutes, but longer exposure time may increase the difference between samples. Therefore, a time-dependent curve may be necessary in order to determine the best time point for your experiment. An exposure time between 30 to 60 min would be the best starting point.Once the incubation at 37 °C is finished, depending on the cell type they may start to detach from the plate. If this is the case, collect the cells by up and down pipetting to detach all the cells and put them in Eppendorf tubes. Pellet the cells at 5,000 x g for 1 min using any standard Eppendorf centrifuge and remove the supernatant. Wash the cells with 1 ml of cold PBS.Note: If the cells did not detach from the plate, remove the UB containing the daunorubicin and wash the cells with cold PBS. Add 0.5 ml of trypsin and wait for the cells to detach. Add 0.",
    "5 ml of cold PBS and collect all the cells in an Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 1 min. Remove supernatant.To the cell pellets, add 100 µl of 4% PFA and incubate for 10 min at room temperature or 60 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge 5,000 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant.Add 100 µl of PBS.Note: From this point, you can go to either Procedure C (FACS analysis), Procedure D (Epifluorescence Microscopy) or Procedure E (Fluoroskan analysis).FACS analysis of the treated cells (need roughly 100,000 cells for the analysis)Take one FACS tube for each sample you have and put 250-500 µl of PBS in each tube. Note: The amount of PBS you put in the tube depends on the number of cells you have. More PBS you put, more time it will take to reach the required number of events on the FACS. However, you need sufficient volume to make your adjustment on the machine.Add the cells prepared in Procedure B to the PBS in the FACS tube. Note: You can always keep some cell suspension to perform epifluorescence microscopy and Fluoroskan analyses as in Procedure D and Procedure E, respectively, but this would depend on the size of the cell pellets in Procedure B. Keep in mind that it will take longer to read 10,000 events if there are less cells in the FACS tube.Turn on the FACS and the computer and make sure the valve is closed so the FACS Flow tank is under pressure.The tanks are in the ‘drawer’ of the machines. There are two tanks, the right one is the FACS Flow, the left one is for the wastes. The valve is at the back between the tanks. Open the software of the FACS (here we are using CellQuest Pro).",

On the second graph, change the x axis name to daunorubicin.Note: This is like doing ‘copy/paste’, but it doesn’t work to duplicate graph in CellQuest Pro and this is why one must use ‘duplicate’ function. Graphs could also be created one by one, but this requires changing the ‘plot type’ each time.In the ‘Cytometer’ tab, click on ‘Detector/Amps’. Change the fluorescent one to ‘Log’ mode (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913022801_6984.jpgFigure 5. Showing the detector controls. Change the scale type and adjust voltage of detectors.Click on the quadrant tool and create quadrants in the daunorubicin graph placing the vertical line around 10 and the horizontal line around the middle of the graph (Figure 6).These will constitute thresholds. You can change these settings according to your sample if required. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913022838_9005.jpgFigure 6. Showing the quadrant.

The Browser in ‘Setup’ mode. This allows you to analyze cells without saving any data.Change the voltage of the detectors to have almost all the cells in the lower left quadrant. (Figure 9)Notes:  Using SSC as y axis, place the horizontal line of the quadrants such as to exclude cells with a very high SSC value which have high chances of being dead cells. Thus, the upper quadrants will exclude the dead cells.Another option to exclude dead cells from the analysis is to create a gate on the graph displaying FSC and SSC of the cells (P1 and P2). Dead cells will have a very low FSC and a high SSC. To do so, on the FSC-SSC graph, use the gate tools to select the living cell population. In the menu of the daunorubicin graph, go to ‘Gate’ and select ‘R1’ or the appropriate gate. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913023128_4555.jpgFigure 9. Adjust detectors voltageClick on the ‘Set Up’ check box to remove the check and write the name of your first sample in the sample text box (Figure 10).You can also use the patient text box to write part of the name that will not change often. As an example, if you are doing time dependent curve with two cell lines, write the cell line’s name in the patient text box and the time point in the sample text box (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913023214_6732.jpgFigure 10. Preparing the acquisitionPlace the sample to be analyzed on the machine and click on ‘Acquire’ (Figure 11).",
    "You can see the number of events per second and the total number of events by displaying the ‘Counters’ window in the ‘Acquire’ tab. The speed of the machine can be changed from slow to medium to high directly on the machine. Having 1,000 events per second is the best.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913023252_0105.jpgFigure 11. AcquisitionChange your tube and repeat the acquisition for all your samples.Once you have analyzed all your samples, you can display them in the graph by clicking on the graph and then, in the ‘Plot’ tab you can change data displayed (Figure 12).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913023329_5331.jpgFigure 12. Navigation between samplesTo analyze the data, multiply the mean daunorubicin fluorescence in the lower right quadrant by the percentage of cells in that quadrant displayed in the quadrant stats window (Figure 13).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913023405_0526.jpgFigure 13. Calculation of the average fluorescence of the sampleNote: If you are using cell line transfected with a fluorescent marker, for example, studying the effect of overexpression of a particular protein tagged with GFP, create another graph and change the x axis of that graph for P3 (FL1 530/30). Create a gate using the gating tools to select only the GFP positive cells using a non-transfected cell sample as negative control to set the threshold. Next, within the menu of the graph that displays the daunorubicin fluorescence, go to Gate and select R1. This way, the graph displaying the daunorubicin will only display GFP positive cells. This can be very useful if you are doing transient transfection. However, you might need to increase the number of events to get enough GFP positive cells in the daunorubicin graph. To do so, go in the Acquire tab and click on acquisition and storage. There you can set the even count.",
    "There could be GFP leak on the FL2 detector, as such using P5 (FL3) may be an option. You can also use the compensation menu in the cytometer tab to reduce the effect of the GFP on the FL2 and the effect of the daunorubicin on the F1.Epifluorescence microscopyPut 3 μl of mounting medium with DAPI on a microscope slide.Note: Mounting medium with DAPI can be replaced by 50% glycerol solution containing 1 to 10 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342.Add 2 μl of cell suspension from Procedure B.Put a cover slip on the sample and fix it with nail polish.Note: Slides can be stored at 4 °C in the dark for one to two weeks.Visualize the cell with an epifluorescence microscope using DAPI filter to visualize nucleus and Red filter (Texas RED) to visualize daunorubicin at 60x or 100x. Note: The protocol here describes the procedure for an Olympus B53 upright epifluorescence microscope working on Cellsens. DAPI filter is working also for staining with Hoechst 33342.To visualize daunorubicin you must excite with a wavelength going from 480 nm to 560 nm. Excitation through a FITC or Texas RED filter should work. The emission of daunorubicin can be detected from 575 nm to 680 nm (Texas RED/mCHerry filter). Using a Texas RED filter set would be the best, otherwise different filters for emission and excitation could be required.Using a control sample, set the light intensity and the exposure time so the daunorubicin is clearly visible, but not saturated (Figure 14).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913023651_4678.jpgFigure 14. Example of images to be obtainedTo adjust the light intensity, use lamp device connected to the microscope.The adjustment of the exposure time is done on the computer in the ‘exposure window’ (Figure 15).To use this method in a quantitative way you must not change these parameters for the daunorubicin visualization.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913024142_9792.",
    "jpgFigure 15. Adjusting the exposure timeAdjust these parameters (light intensity and exposure time) also for nucleus.These settings can be changed from one sample to another unless you want to study the chromatin itself. The staining of the chromatin by DAPI or Hoechst can be compromised by high amount of DNR onto the DNA.If using GFP or another color, set the light intensity and exposure time for this color as well.Take pictures of all samples for all colors. To do so, you must click on ‘Snap’ (Figure 16).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913024227_7956.jpgFigure 16. Camera controls.

To display it, if it is not, click on the live button.Important Note: Microscopes have ‘modes’ so they display through the ocular, the camera or both. When you take picture, make sure the ‘mode’ is one that is using the camera. On Olympus B53, this can be by pulling or pushing a metal stick on the right side of the oculars.Some microscopes such as ZEISS Z2 use special software that can also serve to edit the pictures to create TIFF files with colors and a merge pictures. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913024334_8048.jpgFigure 17.
