    "All procedures were performed in accordance with ethical guidelines at the Medical University of Vienna.\n1. Sample Preparation\nPreparing embryos and embryo tissues (up to 5 x 5 x 5 mm3 )\nFix the embryos or parts of the embryos in 4% PFA/PBS or Bouin's fixative at 4 °C for at least 16 - 24 h under constant rocking.\n\t\tNOTE: Embryos of several species and of various developmental stages can be used, such as 48-h zebrafish, 19-h chick and quail, and also prenatal mouse embryos, which were used here (see Representative Results). The specimens were harvested and transferred into PBS at room temperature for staging, before they were put into fixative. If necessary, trim the specimens with micro-scissors or scalpels prior to fixation to fit into the embedding molds.\nRemove the fixative and wash the embryo tissue in PBS at 4 °C under constant rocking for 24 h (2-3 changes).\nDehydrate the samples in 70%, 80%, 90%, 96% ethanol at 4 °C for 2 - 3 h each. Place tubes containing the samples on a rotator.\n\t\tNOTE: For small samples (< 2 x 2 x 2 mm3), the time a sample rests in each ethanol may be reduced to 60 min. For large samples (> 5 x 5 x 5 mm3), it may be extended to 4 h.\nPerform the following infiltration steps under a fume hood wearing protective gloves.\n\t\t\nPrepare the infiltration solution by adding 1.25 g benzoyl peroxide (plasticized catalyst) and 0.4 g eosin to 100 mL of solution A (for more details, see Table of Materials). Stir this in a beaker on a magnetic stirring plate at 4 °C until eosin and catalyst are fully dissolved (2 - 3 h).",
    "Place the samples for 12 - 24 h in the infiltration solution. Keep it at 4 °C under continuous rocking or rotation. Replace infiltration solution with fresh solution after 3 and 12 h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Extend infiltration time to 48 h for large embryos (> 1 cm crown/rump length).\nPreparing adult tissues samples (up to 5 x 5 x 7 mm3 )\nFix the tissues in 2% PFA/PBS containing 4% carbolic acid at 4 °C for at least 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Tissue sample stemming from skin, liver, pancreas, kidney, thyroid, heart, striated muscle, brain, nerves and tumor models of several neonatal and adult humans, rodents, pigs, fruit flies, and zebra fishes can be fixed in this solution and then processed for HREM imaging (we demonstrate the fixing of the samples; see Representative Results). Excise the tissue samples with scalpels, scissors or biopsy punches and directly transfer them into fixative. For fixation of nervous tissue use 4% PFA/PBS.\nRemove the fixative and wash the tissue under running tap water for 3-6 h.\nDehydrate the samples by subsequently placing them in 70%, 80%, 90%, 96% ethanol, mixed with 0.4 g eosin per 100 mL (2 - 3 h each). Keep the solutions with samples at 4 °C under constant rocking or on a rotator.\n\t\tNOTE: For small samples (< 2 x 2 x 2 mm3), the time a sample rests in each ethanol may be reduced to 60 min. For large samples (> 5 x 5 x 5 mm3), it may be extended to 4-8 h.\nPerform all the following infiltration steps under a fume hood wearing protective gloves.",
    "Prepare the infiltration solution by adding 1.25 g benzoyl peroxide (plasticized catalyst) and 0.4 g eosin to 100 mL of Solution A (for more details, see Table of Materials). Stir in a beaker on a magnetic stirring plate at 4 °C until the eosin and catalyst are fully dissolved (2 - 3 h).\nPlace samples in infiltration solution for 24 - 36 h. Keep it at 4 °C under continuous rocking or rotation. Replace infiltration solution with fresh solution after 3 and 12 h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For large samples (> 5 x 5 x 5 mm3) extend infiltration time to 48 h.\nPreparing other organic material\n\tNOTE: Trim skin substitutes and paper to the desired size with ordinary scissors. No fixation is needed.\n\t\nSkip fixation, washing and dehydration steps.\nPerform all the following infiltration steps under a fume hood wearing protective gloves.\n\t\t\nPrepare the infiltration solution by adding 1.25 g benzoyl peroxide (plasticized catalyst) and 0.4 g eosin to 100 mL of Solution A (for more details, see Table of Materials). Stir in a beaker at 4 °C on a magnetic stirring plate until eosin and catalyst are fully dissolved (2 - 3 h).\nPlace samples in infiltration solution for 3 - 12 h. Keep it at 4 °C under continuous rocking or rotation. Replace infiltration solution with fresh solution after 1 and 2 - 4 h.\n2. Embedding\nNOTE: Perform all steps under a fume hood wearing protective gloves.\nPrepare fresh infiltration solution as described above (step 1.1.4.1). Add 4 mL Solution B (for details, see Table of Materials) to 100 mL infiltration solution to prepare the embedding solution.",
    "NOTE: If precise orientation of the specimen in the embedding molds is required and to allow the embedding of several samples in parallel, slow the polymerization of the stock solution by putting the beaker into an ice-bath.\nUse molding cup trays (for details, see Table of Materials) with molds having a routine volume of 6 x 8 x 5 mm3 or 13 x 19 x 5 mm3, or customized molds with volumes of up to 8 x 10 x 15 mm3 (Figure 2).\nFill the molds with embedding solution and transfer the sample into the mold using a spoon. During transfer ensure that the sample is fully covered with embedding solution to avoid air trapping.\n\tNOTE: This can be done at room temperature, if started immediately after collecting the samples and the embedding solution from the refrigerator.\n\t\nOrient the sample inside the mold using needles or forceps.\nAs soon as embedding solution starts to become viscous, place a block holder (see Table of Materials) on top of the mold and add embedding solution through the central hole of the block holder until the base of the block holder is covered with 1 - 2 mm of embedding solution.\nSeal the molding cup tray by covering it with liquid paraffin wax and wait until it has hardened. Alternatively place a second molding cup tray upside-down on the molding cup tray with samples and seal it with adhesive tape to air-proof.\nAllow blocks to finish polymerization by storing the sealed molding cup trays for 1 - 2 days at room temperature.",
    "For post-polymerization processing, place the molding cup trays with the polymerized blocks in a standard laboratory oven and bake at 70 - 80 °C for a minimum of 1 - 2 days until they become dark red. Collect the trays from the oven and remove the blocks from the mold.\n\tNOTE: Baking can be done under normal environmental conditions. The covering molding cup tray, which ensures airproof sealing in the first phase after embedding, can be removed to allow for checking the color of the resin after 10 h. Immediately after baking, the resin is soft and the blocks can be easily removed from the molding cup tray. Within 2 - 3 h they are hard and can be stored at room temperature for several months.\n3. Data Generation\nNOTE: The HREM prototype18,25 used here comprises the following items: (i) Rotary microtome with a block holder that stops after each cut at its upper turning point. (ii) Standard, non-disposable microtome knife, hard metal, profile D (for details, see Table of Materials). (iii) Head of fluorescence compound microscope with objective revolver and a GFP-filter cube (excitation 470/40; emission filter 525/50) in its optical axis. The optical axis is arranged perpendicular to the freshly cut surface of a block mounted on the microtome and is held by a device that allows up- and downward movement. (iv) Motorized cross table carrying the microtome. The table can be shifted in the direction of the optical axis and laterally. (v) Digital video camera attached to the fluorescent compound microscope. (vi) Monochrome light source (470 nm). (vii) Computer connected to the camera, with data generation software (for details, see Table of Materials).\nProcedure\nIndicate the region of interest.\n\t\t\nUse standard laboratory light source (see Table of Materials) for directing white light obliquely to the block surface.",
    "Identify the outlines of the embedded material as it projects to the block surface. Indicate the region of interest and later field of view on the block surface using a pen or razor blade.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step is mandatory to define the extent of the field of view prior to sectioning.\nDefine the field of view.\n\t\t\nMount the resin block with sample on the microtome.\nMove the block holder to its stopping position (upper turning point of block holder excursion).\nStart the digital camera and data generation software, and acquire a live image.\nChoose an objective lens, with an appropriate magnification to cover the region of interest indicated on the block surface.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Objectives with magnifications 2.5X, 5X, 10X, 20X and numeric apertures between 0.07 and 0.40 are commonly used.\nMove the optic up- and downward and the microtome laterally using the motorized cross table until the region of interest matches with the field of view displayed on the computer screen.\nFocus.\n\t\t\nPerform step by step manual sectioning until first structures of the sample become visible.\nArrange the block surface in the focus plane of the optic, by moving the microtome in the direction of the optical axis.\nChoose section thickness; section thicknesses from 0.5 to 5 µm are recommended.\nData generation and processing\nStart software routine that orchestrates sectioning and image capturing. Follow the documented instruction of the imaging capturing software.\nStop software routine and put a scaling slide in front of the block surface as soon as the sample is completely sectioned.\nCapture an image interactively for later calibration.\n\t\tNOTE: This must be done every time an objective is used in a newly arranged set up.\nConvert the image series to 8 bit gray-scale images in.jpg format.\nLoad image series into 3D visualization software and adjust contrasts.",
    "NOTE: Image conversion and 3D visualization can be done with various commercially or freely available standard software packages, following the instructions of the respective software."
