    "All animal experiments described were approved by the NIH Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC). See the Table of Materials for details related to all the reagents and materials used in this protocol. Refer to published guidelines19 for more details on retrovirus-producer cell culture and maintenance procedures. See Figure 1 for an overview of the protocol.\n1. Starting the culture of OP9-DL4 cells (Day 1)\nThaw OP9-DL4 cells rapidly by holding the vial and gently shaking in a water bath at 37 °C. Immediately transfer the cells to a centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of the OP9 medium (MEM-alpha medium, 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine) to remove the cryoprotectant agents.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of OP9 medium.\nPlace 5 mL of OP9 medium into a T25 flask, and add the resuspended cells to this flask. Culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAfter 2–3 days, subculture the cells using a 1:3 split (passage the cells every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).\n\tNOTE: Split the OP9-DL4 cells before they reach confluency. The OP9-DL4 flask must be 80%–90% confluent on days 6–7 and on days 8–9+ for co-culture with thymocytes. Hence, it is important to plan how many OP9-DL4 cells will be required on those days while splitting the OP9-DL4 cells.\n\t\nDiscard the medium from the flask, and wash the monolayer with 1x PBS. Discard the PBS, add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin, and incubate for 1–5 min at 37 °C, or until the cells have dislodged from the flask. Thump the flask to dislodge the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: (Optional) The progress of cell dissociation can be checked by microscopy.",
    "Add 5 mL of OP9 medium to inactivate the trypsin, and resuspend the cells by rinsing the cell-covered surface of the flask during resuspension.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspend in 3 mL of OP9 medium (for a 1:3 split).\nPlace 1 mL of the cell suspension into a T25 flask that already contains 5 mL of fresh OP9 medium. Freeze/discard the remaining cells.\n\t\t\nTo freeze the OP9-DL4 cells, resuspend the cells in 90% FBS/10% DMSO at a ratio of 1 mL of freezing medium to one vial of cells.\nFreeze in 1 mL cryovials at −80 °C or in liquid nitrogen, depending on the future requirements. Store in liquid nitrogen for prolonged storage.\n2. Starting the culture of the retrovirus-producer cell line (Day 1)\nThaw the retrovirus-producer cell line rapidly by holding the vial and gently shaking in a water bath at 37 °C. Immediately transfer the cells to a centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of retrovirus-producer cell medium (RPC: DMEM, 10% FBS) to remove the cryoprotectant agent.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of RPC medium.\nPlace 5 mL of RPC medium into a T25 flask, and add the resuspended cells to this flask. Culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPassage the cells every 2–3 days at a 1:5 to 1:8 split.\n\t\nThump the flask to dislodge the cells, and resuspend the cells by pipetting aggressively.\n\t\tNOTE: These cells can be removed from the flask surface by aggressive pipetting without trypsin. Alternatively, trypsinize (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA) until the cells easily detach and can be readily pipetted into a single-cell suspension.",
    "Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min, and resuspend in 5 mL of RPC medium (for a 1:5 split).\nPlace 1 mL of the cell suspension into a T25 flask that already contains 5 mL of fresh RPC medium. Freeze/discard the remaining cells. Freeze the retrovirus-producer cells in the same way as described for OP9-DL4 cells (steps 1.4.4.1–1.4.4.2).\n3. Beginning the culture of the retrovirus-producer cells in 6-well plates (Days 4–5)\nSeed the retrovirus-producer cells 18–24 h prior to transfection at 70%–90% confluency in each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate in 2 mL of RPC medium,and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Transfect two wells of the retrovirus-producer cells for every 2–5 × 105 to 1 × 106 thymocytes that will be transduced.\n4. Transfecting the retrovirus-producer cells to generate the retrovirus containing the genes of interest (Days 5–6)\nReplace the medium with fresh RPC medium 1 h before transfection.\nPrepare lipofection mixtures (for each well of a 6-well plate—scale up as needed): Dilute 4 µg of DNA (2 µg of helper plasmid (pCL-Eco) and 2 µg of transfer plasmid (pMIG) in 250 µL of reduced-serum medium. Mix gently.\nMix 10 µL of transfection reagent with 250 uL of the reduced-serum medium from step 4.2. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nAfter 5 min of incubation, combine the diluted DNA with diluted transfection reagent (total volume = 500 µL). Mix gently, and incubate for 20–25 min at room temperature.\nAdd the 500 µL of DNA/transfection reagent mixtures gently to the well containing the retrovirus-producer cells by dropping onto the cells with a circular movement. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth, and incubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 16–24 h.",
    "NOTE: Subconfluent cells (80%–90%) are best suited for transfection and potentially generate the highest viral titer. As the retrovirus-producer cells dislodge very easily from the flask, avoid sudden movements when handling these cells.\n5. Changing the retrovirus-producer cell medium (Days 6–7)\nReplace the old medium approximately 16 h after transfection with 2 mL of fresh RPC medium. Continue to incubate cells at 37 °C for 20–24 h.\nEvaluate the transfection efficiency under a fluorescence microscope (optional).\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, GFP-positive cells are the cells of interest (see Figure 2). This step depends on the retrovirus vector selected to use in this protocol (whether a reporter gene is present in the backbone).\n6. Thymocyte preparation and depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells (Days 6–7)\nHarvest the thymus from a 4–6 week old C57BL/6 mouse. For more details on thymus harvesting, refer to Xing and Hogquist20.\n\tNOTE: Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\nPrepare a thymocyte single-cell suspension by placing the thymus in 5 mL of PBS in a Petri dish. Using sterile glass slides, place the thymus between the frosted surfaces of the slides, and gently rub the slides together, rolling the thymus between the two slides. Rinse the glass slides to collect the cells, and discard the remnant thymic stromal tissue.\n\tNOTE: The estimated yield from one thymus is 90 × 106–100 × 106 cells, and approximately 1% of the cells will remain after CD4 and CD8 depletion. Use thymus tissue from younger mice for a better yield of cells, since the cellularity of the mouse thymus in the first weeks after birth increases quickly, reaches a plateau at 4–6 weeks of age, and progressively involutes subsequently21. Count the cells using an automatic blood cell counter or any alternative method.",
    "Filter the thymic suspension through a 30 µm or 40 µm filter by pipetting 5 mL of the thymic suspension through a cell strainer. Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant, and lyse the red blood cells with ACK lysis buffer by adding (depending on the sample size) 1 mL of buffer per tube for 1 min. Add 5 mL of cell depletion buffer (500 mL of PBS [pH 7.2], 0.5% BSA, 2 mM 0.5M EDTA, pH 8.0) to deactivate the ACK lysis buffer, centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min, and resuspend in 1–5 mL of cell depletion buffer for counting.\n\tNOTE: Set aside the following on ice before depletion (pre-depletion): 70 µL of cell suspension to count (vary this depending on the counting cell method chosen) and 200 µL of cell suspension to determine the efficiency of depletion by staining for CD4 and CD8 and analyzing by flow cytometry22,23.\nCount the cells, and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min. Resuspend the cells at 1 × 107/80 µL of cell depletion buffer. Add 10 µL each of CD4 and CD8 microbeads per 1 × 107 cells. Mix well, and incubate for 15 min in the dark in the refrigerator (2–8 °C).\nPrepare a depletion column by rinsing it with 2 mL of depletion buffer and discarding the flowthrough.\nWash the cells from step 6.6 by adding 1–2 mL of depletion buffer per 1 × 107 cells, and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend up to 1.25 × 108 cells in 500 µL of depletion buffer. Apply the cell suspension to the column, and collect the flowthrough (unlabeled cells). Wash the column 2x with 1 mL of buffer, and collect the flowthrough.",
    "NOTE: Only add new buffer when the column reservoir is empty. Set aside the following on ice after depletion (post-depletion control): 70 µL of cell suspension to count (vary this depending on the counting cell method chosen) and 1,000 µL of cell suspension to determine the efficiency of depletion by staining for CD4 and CD8 and analyzing by flow cytometry22,23.\nStain the depletion efficiency controls by splitting the 200 µL of cells collected before depletion into four FACS tubes: unstained, CD4 single-stained, CD8 single-stained, and CD4/CD8 double-stained (use the unstained and single-stained samples to set up the flow cytometry parameters). Use the 1,000 µL of cells collected after depletion to stain for CD4 and CD8 and compare with the double-stained sample collected before depletion (see typical depletion results in Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Adjust the volumes for flow cytometry staining according to the antibody manufacturer’s recommendation (e.g., 1 µL of anti-CD4-FITC + 0.5 µL of anti-CD8-PE per 1 x 106 cells in 50 µL of buffer).\n7. Culturing thymocytes on OP9-DL4 cells (Days 6–7)\nPlace 2–5 × 105 to 1 × 106 post-depletion thymocytes into a T25 flask of 80%–90% confluent OP9-DL4 cells in OP9 medium containing cytokines (10 ng/mL recombinant IL-7 and recombinant hFLT-3). Culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Grow for approximately 24 h on OP9-DL4 cells.",
    "NOTE: This duration is required to make the T cells transducible (see a typical result in Figure 4). Reserve one T25 flask of the co-culture of thymocytes and OP9-DL4 cells to be used as a control (untransduced). The untransduced thymocytes will be stained together with the transduced thymocytes (step 9.1) as a negative control to evaluate the transduction efficiency. Untransduced thymocytes can also be used to measure the effect of the transgene expression on cell differentiation. Discard the cytokine-containing medium after 1 month.\n8. Harvesting the retrovirus from the supernatant and using it to transduce the thymocytes (Days 8–9)\nCollect the supernatant containing the retroviruses from the transfected cells by tilting the 6-well plate and positioning a 3–5 mL syringe at the bottom of the plate while pulling the plunger to aspirate the supernatant. Replace the medium with 2 mL of fresh RPC medium. Continue to incubate the cells at 37 °C for 20–24 h for the second transduction in step 8.9.\nFilter the retrovirus supernatant through a 0.45 µm syringe filter, and collect the filtrate in a 50 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Do not freeze the retroviral supernatant. Use a freshly made virus preparation for transduction.\nCollect thymocytes from the OP9-DL4 culture by aggressive pipetting to remove the thymocytes and OP9-DL4 cells from the flask surface. Filter the cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer to remove most of the OP9-DL4 cells, and collect the filtrate in a 50 mL tube.",
    "NOTE: OP9 cells are very adherent. Although aggressive pipetting may remove some of the OP9-DL4 cells from the flask, the disruption of the OP9-DL4 monolayer during this process is minimal, and the OP9-DL4 cells that come off will be filtered out with the 40 µm cell strainer, since the OP9-DL4 cells are much larger than the primary thymocytes. If the OP9-DL4 cells are still 80%–90% confluent, remove the thymocytes, and re-plate them in the same OP9-DL4 flask. Alternatively, a new OP9-DL4 flask must be prepared.\nCentrifuge the thymocytes in the filtrate from step 8.3 at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nIn the 50 mL tube, resuspend the thymocytes in 0.5–1 mL of OP9 medium + cytokines (see step 7.1). Add 1–2 mL of RPC medium containing the virus (twice as much RPC medium as thymocyte medium). Add hexamethrine bromide (10 µg/µL stock concentration) to yield 8 µg of hexamethrine bromide/mL of total cell suspension.\nSpinoculate by centrifuging the cells at 850 × g for 1 h at room temperature.\nResuspend the cells in 6 mL of OP9 medium + cytokines per flask (see step 7.1), and add the suspension back onto the OP9-DL4 cell monolayer.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, have new OP9-DL4 flasks ready to receive the transduced thymocytes. If the thymocytes are to be placed back into a used OP9-DL4 flask, make sure to add fresh OP9 medium to the OP9-DL4 cells during the 1 h of thymocyte spinoculation to keep the cells healthy and ensure 80%–90% confluency.\nIncubate at 37 °C overnight.\nRepeat steps 8.2–8.7 using a new well of the retrovirus-containing cell supernatant.\n9. Maintaining transduced thymocytes on OP9-DL4 culture for 2–5 days or freezing as needed (Day 9+)",
    "Assess the thymocyte differentiation by flow cytometry by staining thymocytes for T cell development markers such as CD4, CD8, CD25, and CD4423. See typical thymocyte differentiation results in Figure 5."
