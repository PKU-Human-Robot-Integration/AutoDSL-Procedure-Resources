    "The present study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pittsburgh. Eight (sham n = 4 and MI n = 4) 1-year-old female C57BL/6J mice weighing 24-30 g were used for these experiments. Approximately 100% and at least 80% of mice survived in the first 24 h and 28 days, respectively.\n1. Preparation and endotracheal intubation of the mice\nPreheat a bead sterilizer (see Table of Materials) to 250 °C and place autoclaved surgical instruments in it for a few minutes.\nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber with 3% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen for 5 min.\nEnsure the depth of anesthesia in the mouse by checking the response to a firm toe pinch.\nWeigh the mouse to estimate the dosage of the pre-operative analgesic drug, buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg). Inject the drug intraperitonially.\nTrim the fur on the left side of the thorax using an electric razor.\nDisinfect the surgical site with povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol thereafter three times.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position on an inclined board. Secure the head and limbs of the mouse using an elastic band attached to the upper incisors and adhesive tape, respectively. Apply sterile ophthalmic lubricant on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nOpen the jaw and gently pull the tongue out of the oral cavity.\nIdentify the opening of the larynx by illuminating the oropharynx using a laryngoscope (see Table of Materials).\nCut off about 0.5 cm from a 24 G catheter needle and insert the blunt needle into the plastic shield. Direct the blunt needle with the plastic shield into the trachea. Take out the needle, leaving the plastic shield into the trachea.",
    "Set the ventilator (see Table of Materials) to a respiratory rate of 137 beats per min (optimized for the mice used in this study) and tidal volume 0.18 cc. Connect the respirator tubes to the catheter shield and confirm correct intubation by looking for a synchronized chest movement with the ventilator.\nDisconnect the respirator tube from the catheter shield and place the animal in the supine position on a preheated temperature-controlled surgical board. Reconnect the mouse to the ventilator.\n2. Permanent ligation of the left coronary artery\nDisinfect the surgical site with povidone-iodine and 70% alcohol. Apply a sterile drape having a quarter-sized hole in the center to secure the surgical site. Gently lift the skin using a pair of forceps and make a small (1.5-2 cm) cutaneous transverse incision along the line between the left pectoralis major and minor muscles using a pair of surgical scissors.\n\tNOTE: Scissors were used to make the incision as it provides the required control over the depth and direction of the cut.\nSeparate the underlying pectoralis muscles with forceps and dissecting scissors. The muscles were separated using retractors attached to elastic bands.\nMake an incision in the third intercostal space with a pair of micro scissors following the natural angle of the ribcage. At this phase, extreme caution must be exercised to prevent injury to the heart and lungs.\nGently stretch the ribs apart using retractors to expose the left ventricle. Move the pericardial fat aside and locate the LCA, which runs from the edge of the left atrium towards the apex of the heart.\nPass an 8-0 nylon suture under the LCA with the help of a needle holder. Ligate the LCA with a double knot followed by a second knot (a modified surgeon's knot).",
    "NOTE: Blanching of the lower left ventricle confirms a successful LCA ligation.In addition to this, troponin measurement, ECG monitoring (ST elevation), echo/in vivo cardiac-gated MRI, or micro-CT images are also advised to confirm the comparable MI lesions.\nRemove the retractors and insert a 22 G catheter needle into the chest cavity. Remove the needle, leaving the tip of the plastic shield in the thoracic cavity. Close the ribcage using a 4-0 nylon suture.\nConnect a syringe to the 22 G plastic shield and slowly remove excess air trapped in the thoracic cavity by gently pressing the chest to establish a negative air pressure. Remove the plastic shield.\nClose the skin with a 4-0 nylon suture.\nSwitch off the isoflurane supply. At this stage, the mouse is on the ventilator supplying oxygen.\n3. Post-operative care\nSwitch off the ventilator once spontaneous breathing starts.\n\tNOTE: The procedure takes about 30-35 min per animal from preparation of the mice up to this step.\nKeep the mouse under a heat lamp and monitor it until it is awake. The animal should not be left unattended until it has recovered enough consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nAfter surgery, place the animal is in a separate cage and return it to the original cage with other animals only after it fully recovers.\nMonitor the mouse daily for any sign of pain or discomfort.\nContinue intraperitoneal injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) every 6-8 hours for an additional 2 days following the surgery.\n4. Echocardiographic Evaluation\nNOTE: Echocardiography was performed to evaluate the parameters of heart failure on day 28 after MI.",
    "After 28 days following the surgery, anesthetize the mice with 3% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen, apply sterile ophthalmic lubricant on the eyes, and remove chest hair using hair removal cream. Disinfect the chest area with povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol three times.\nSecure the anesthetized mice atop the imaging platform (see Table of Materials) in the supine position and maintain a steady level of anesthesia throughout the procedure using a nose cone connected to the anesthetic system (1%-2% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen).\nTape the four paws to the ECG electrodes with electrode gel (see Table of Materials). Monitor the temperature of the animal by inserting a rectal probe (see Table of Materials).\nApply the scanning gel (see Table of Materials) to the chest, place the transducer vertically, lower it to the parasternal line (parallel to the thorax), and rotate 35° anticlockwise to obtain the parasternal long axis view of the left ventricle.\nTap the B-mode imaging button on the imaging software (see Table of Materials) to get a complete long axis view of the heart. Adjust the gate size and brightness and save the images using Save Clip or Save Frame for later measurements16.\nSwitch to M-mode (motion-mode) and place the M-mode axis at the level of the papillary muscle. Adjust the gate size and tap the M-mode Start button. Save the images using Save Clip or Save Frame16,17.\nAs the 4D mode image acquisition process is automated, verify that the ECG and respiration signals are active (Figure 1) before acquiring the data.",
    "Start acquiring the data in B-Mode. Open the 4D scan panel and initiate the 3D motor. Set the image parameters in the 4D scan panel and tap the Scan button to begin the scanning. After reviewing the images in the 2D view, load the images into 4D mode using the Load into 4D button.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
