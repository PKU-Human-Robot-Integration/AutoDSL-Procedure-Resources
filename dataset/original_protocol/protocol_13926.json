    "The protocol in the present study consists primarily of the following two aspects: 1) resistance force of the acetabular labrum with pull-probing and 2) measurement of the reaction force on the mimic cartilage sample with push-probing.\n1. Resistance force of the acetabular labrum with pull-probing\nPhantom preparation for the measurements with pull-probing\n\t\nFix a phantom hip, which consists of the left pelvis and femur bone, major muscles of the hip, acetabular labrum, hip capsule, and articular cartilage of the hip joint on a standard fixation device5.\nAbduct and internally rotate the femur bone slightly to distance it from the pelvis, generating joint space mimicking hip arthroscopy.\nCamera preparation for arthroscopy\n\t\nPrepare a 4 mm 70° autoclavable direct view arthroscope and connect a portable arthroscopy camera. Connect a portable arthroscopy camera light source to the 70° arthroscope. Connect USB cables from the arthroscopy camera and the light source to a PC. Then, open advanced screen recording software for the arthroscopy view on the PC.\nPreparation of portals\n\tNOTE: The preparation is followed by the standard conventional hip arthroscopy method7.\n\t\nInsert a cannulated needle and guide wire into the hip joint from the tip of the greater trochanter to make a normal anterolateral portal.\nInsert a 5.5 mm cannula with an obturator along the line of the guide wire.  Then, remove the obturator, and insert the 70° arthroscope with the portable arthroscopy camera along the cannula, thus generating the first portal.\nConfirm whether the capsular triangle between the labrum and femoral head7 is seen in the view from this portal. Next, make the second portal as a modified anterior portal7.\nCapsulotomy, opening the hip capsule",
    "When the anterior portal has been generated, retain the arthroscope in the anterolateral portal. Insert a 4.5 mm cannula with an obturator along the guide wire, remove the obturator, and then insert an arthroscopic scalpel from the anterior portal. Perform a peri-portal capsulotomy around the anterior portal, moving the scalpel medially and laterally to generate more space for the anterior portal in the hip capsule.\nPlace the arthroscope into the anterior portal. Rotate the camera view of the arthroscope until seeing the cannula at the anterolateral portal. Insert the arthroscopic scalpel from the anterolateral portal. Perform a transverse interportal capsulotomy, which connects between the two portals from approximately 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock. Then, leave this capsulotomy 5 mm from the labrum, measuring approximately 15 mm in length.\nSetup of the probing device\n\t\nConfirm the connection between the power supply unit and PC with a USB cable. Switch on the power supply unit. Open the software for the probing device, which is described in the Introduction.\nInput the matrix data for the first time, which is pre-calculated during calibration of the strain gauge sensor. Recalibrate if the measured value is not same as the default weight value when placed at the tip of the probe.\nReset the measuring force value to zero immediately before each measurement. In addition, confirm whether the foot switch connected with the recording system of the probing device works well.\nMeasurement of resistance of the acetabular labrum while pull-probing\n\t\nPlace the arthroscope into the anterolateral portal. Insert the probing device from the anterior portal and go further into the hip joint until the tip of the device is below the inner side of the acetabular labrum.",
    "Zero the setting as above. Pull the tip of the probing device out in the direction of the joint (this is the first surgical step as “Labrum intact”) (Figure 3).\nRemove the probing device from the anterior portal and then insert the arthroscopic scalpel into the joint. Then, detach the anterior-superior labrum longitudinally (by 10 mm) from the acetabular rim sharply using the scalpel.\nSwitch from the scalpel to the probing device in the anterior region. Hook the labrum along the probe axis at the same position of the labrum to measure the resistance force of the labrum (this is identified as the second step, “Labrum cut”). Again, remember to zero the setting before this measurement.\nInsert an anchor set for the labrum repair into the anterior portal. Place the anchor at the tip of the anchor set at the acetabular bony edge. Insert the suturing instrument into the anterior portal after removing the anchor set. Tighten the labrum at the acetabular edge. Repeat this repair procedure once more for making the second stitch.\nMeasure the resistance force of the labrum by again hooking the labrum along the probing axis (this is as the third step, “Labrum repair”). Remember to press the foot pedal when recording each surgical step.\n2. Measurement of the reaction force to mimic cartilage samples with push-probing\nNOTE: In the second study, a vertical resistance force on each mimic cartilage surface was measured (Figure 4A) with push-probing on the cartilage surface at a 30° tilt to the horizontal line and identified as one element of the mechanical properties of articular cartilage.\nPreparation of the samples for measurements with push-probing.\n\t\nPrepare the cartilage samples. In the current study, five kinds of mimic cartilage samples were used, which were made from poly-vinyl alcohol hydrogels8.",
    "Reshape the samples from the bulk size of the provided samples to 15 mm x 20 mm x 3 mm as a mimic cartilage plate. Place each sample on a base plate, which has a tiny stopper toward the side of the push-probing.\nMeasurement of cartilage resistance with push-probing\n\t\nHold and fix the position and orientation of the probing device in which the tip of the device almost touches the surface of the mimic cartilage sample while maintaining a 30° tilt to the horizontal line.\nAfter zeroing the setting, push and pull the tip of the probing device on the mimic cartilage sample three times by pressing the foot pedal.\nRepeat this measurement step for the five samples after putting on each of the plates.\nMeasurement of cartilage resistance by a classical indentation device\n\t\nMeasure the conventional elastic modulus and stiffness of each sample using a classical indentation device (Figure 4B).",
    "NOTE: The customized device for the classical indentation test to measure the elastic modulus of the mimic cartilage sample in the current study had a spherical indenter with a 1 mm diameter tip and an electromechanical actuator (resolution, 5 µm). The actuator, indenter, and load cell were assembled using custom 3D-printed brackets by PLA filaments on a 3D printer (Figure 4B) to function as a conventional uniaxial indentation system. Each sample was placed on the baseplate of the indentation device. The midpoint of the sample was aligned with the indenter tip. The indenter tip was brought into initial contact with the sample using a preload of 0.02 N. The indenter tip was then compressed 150 µm into the cartilage surface. The force and displacement were recorded during the indentation. The linear portion of the indentation force-displacement curve was used to calculate the stiffness and the elastic modulus as reported by Hayes et al.24 using the thickness of the sample. The data by this device was not validate, but the mechanical values of cartilage samples by this device were confirmed previously; the elastic modulus was 0.46 MPa (0.27 MPa standard deviation (SD)), which is consistent with that found in several previous literature studies11,16,19.\nCalculate the coefficient value between the maximum value of the vertical reaction force with push-probing and the elastic modulus by the classical indentation device."
