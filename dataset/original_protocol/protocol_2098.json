Use 1–1.5 mL of coating solution in each well and leave the plate to coat for 2 h at 15°C–25°C or at least 1 h in the incubator at 37°C.\nNote: Keep the Matrigel solution cold until it is distributed in the well plate to avoid gelling. Agitate the plate side to side and front to back to get and even coating.\nPrepare 2 mL mTeSR media per well of a 6-well plate to be seeded and add 0.2 μL/mL of Thiazovivin stock solution.\nTo passage the feeder-free H9 ESCs, begin by warming 0.5 mM EDTA to 37°C in a dry bath.\nWash one well of a 6-well plate containing 80% confluent feeder-free ESCs with 1 mL of EDTA.\nAdd 1 mL of EDTA and incubate for 2–3 min.\nCarefully aspirate the EDTA and add 1 mL of the prepared mTeSR media containing Thiazovivin. Agitate the plate to lift cells into suspension. Carefully wash the well with the cell suspension while maintaining cell aggregates (avoid breaking into single cells).\nTake a 10 μL sample from the cell suspension and mix it with 10 μL Trypan Blue, by vigorous trituration to break up cell clusters.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nTransfer a volume corresponding to 5,000 cells/well to be seeded to the prepared mTeSR media. Triturate gently to ensure a homogeneous cell density without breaking the colonies down to single cells.",
    "Aspirate the coating solution and seed the cells in the Matrigel-coated wells. Distribute the aggregates by agitating the plate side to side and front to back.\nIncubate the cells for eight days at 37°C, changing the media every 1–3 days. Colonies should be 1–2 mm in diameter (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and be well-separated before initiating differentiation.\nCritical: The colonies should be sparse with good space between individual colonies >50 colonies/well to avoid colonies merging before zone 3. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for colonies after 1 week of differentiation.\nNote: Stem cells should be karyotyped every 10–15 passages, to test for chromosomal duplications, insertions, deletions, and translocations that can impact the differentiation of the cells.\nInitiate SEAM differentiation, Day 0.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1687-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. SEAM cultures\n(A) Human ESC colony before initiating SEAM differentiation, scale bar=1 mm.\n(B) SEAM colonies 6 days after initiation of differentiation viewed from the bottom of the well, showing a denser middle zone and cells growing out in concentric circles around the middle zone.\n(C) Mature SEAM colonies at 52 days after initiating differentiation, viewed from the top. The middle zone (zone 1, (Z1)) is dense and appear white, with the pigmented cells of zone 2 (Z2) around.\n(D) Schematic overview of the four zones of a mature SEAM colony.\n(E) SEAM colony stained with DAPI showing the different cell density and cell size of zone 1, 2 and 3, scale bar = 500 μm.\n(F) Bright field image of the images in (E), with visually pigmented cells in zone 2. Scale bar = 500 μm.\nWarm the SEAM-media to 37°C.\nAspirate half the media in each well and replace it with warm SEAM-media, 1 mL/well.\nInitiate SEAM differentiation Day 2.\nWarm the SEAM-media to 37°C.",
    "Aspirate half the media in each well and replace it with warm SEAM-media, 1 mL/well.\nSEAM maturation Day 4–54.\nAspirate total volume of media in each well every other day and replace it with fresh SEAM-media, 2 mL/well.\nNote: Early after the initiation of differentiation, colonies should expand and become more circular, with a denser middle and a more see-through outer zone occupied by larger cells, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. After approximately 25 days of differentiation, pigmented cells should become visible in zone 2, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C. Further descriptions of the expected SEAM morphology can be found under Expected Outcomes.\nCritical: When the culture matures and becomes confluent, extracellular matrix starts forming and some cultures will tend to lift from the plate. Be careful when moving the plate and feeding the cells; avoid agitating the plate to lift cells and collapse the culture (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] under Trouble shooting).\nIsolation and culture of adult human ocular cells\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nCoat four wells of a 24-well plate per donor tissue type to be cultured with Synthemax-II-SC according to the manufacturer guidelines.\nPrepare one 15 mL centrifuge tube for every tissue type to be processed, except retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), with 3 mL 2.5 mg/mL collagenase II, 0.6 μL thiazovivin (40 nM) and 9 μL DNase 1 (1 μU/mL), and heat to 37°C.\nPrepare 5 mL trypsin EDTA with 40 nM thiazovivin and 3 μL/mL DNase 1 and heat to 37°C.\nPrepare 30 mL TAB 2 media with 10% additional hi-FBS and 40 nM thiazovivin and heat to 37°C.\nIf receiving a whole globe, sterilize the globe by submersion in a 30% solution of betadine and then rinsing with sterile PBS twice, before proceeding to dissection under sterile conditions. If receiving a cornea rejected for transplant proceed directly to dissection (step 10b).",
    "Isolation of sclera, cornea, and limbus.\nSeparate the anterior parts of the eye from the posterior part, by making a pars planar circular cut roughly 2 mm posterior to the limbus (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1687-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Using a sterile nylon paint brush, brush RPE off from the Bruch’s membrane and collect in a conical tube. (D) Separate the Bruch's membrane and choroid from the scleral wall with forceps.\n(E) Separate the iris from the ciliary body using forceps, cut into small pieces and place into collagenase solution.\nMake a circular cut separating the sclera from the limbus and cornea (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B Left) and place the scleral tissue in a clean petri dish with sterile PBS to prevent tissue from drying out.\nMake a circular cut separating the limbus from the clear tissue of the cornea (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B middle) and place the limbus and cornea into separate clean petri dishes with sterile PBS to prevent tissue from drying out.\nAspirate the PBS.\nCut the different tissues in to small pieces using a scalpel or a pair of scissors.\nTransfer the tissue pieces to the prepared tubes containing collagenase 2 solution. Close The lids loosely to allow gas exchange and incubate at 37°C in the incubator for 2 h, triturating with a p1000 pipette after 1 h of incubation.",
    "Add 300 μL hi-FBS to each tube and triturate with a p1000 pipette to mix.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 2 mL TAB2 media with 10% FBS and 40 nM thiazovivin. The cell suspension is divided into four wells of a Synthemax-II-SC coated 24-well plate, 500 μL/well.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in the incubator 5% CO2, 20% O2.\nIsolation of iris.\nCut the ciliary marginal zone from the choroid at the top of the globe, like how the cornea and limbus were separated from the globe in step 10. Transferer the iris and ciliary marginal zone into a clean petri dish with sterile PBS to prevent tissue from drying.\nSeparate the iris from the ciliary marginal zone by grabbing the iris with an angled pair of tweezers and the ciliary marginal zone with a pair of blunt tweezers, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E, and pull the tissues from each other.\nPlace the iris in a clean petri dish.\nCut the tissue into small pieces using a scalpel or a pair of scissors.\nTransfer the tissue pieces into the prepared tube containing collagenase 2 solution.

The cell suspension is divided into four wells of a Synthemax-II-SC coated 24-well plate, 500 μL/well.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in the incubator 5% CO2, 20% O2.\nIsolation of RPE.",
    "Carefully fix the choroid to the sclera by insertion of 3–4 equally spaced 27-gauge needles around the opening of the globe.\nLift out the lens and vitreous. If the retina is not attached to the vitreous, carefully detach the retina from the underlying pigmented cell layer and discard (See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] if retina does not detach).\nAdd approximately 3 mL warm trypsin with 40 nM thiazovivin and 3 μL/mL DNase 1 is carefully, filling to globe to roughly 1 mm below the rim of the choroid-RPE (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIncubate the globe for 45 min.\nCarefully detach the RPE cells from the choroid by gentle agitation with a sterilized brush (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Pigmentation in the trypsin should be clearly noticeable when removing the solution from the eye cup and placing it into media.\nTransfer the suspension to a centrifuge tube and add 1/10 of the total volume (roughly 300 μL) hi-FBS to inactivate the trypsin.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in 2 mL TAB2 media with 10% FBS and 40 nM thiazovivin. The cell suspension is divided into four wells of a Synthemax-II-SC coated 24-well plate, 500 μL/well.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in the incubator.\nIsolation of choroid.\nGently wash the choroid with sterile PBS to limit RPE contamination.\nPeel the choroid from the globe with the blunt tweezers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) and transfer to a clean petri dish.\nCut the tissue in to small pieces using a scalpel or a pair of scissors.\nTransfer the tissue pieces to the prepared tube containing collagenase 2 solution. Close the lid loosely to allow gas exchange and incubate at 37°C in the incubator for 2 h, triturating with a p1000 pipette after 1 h of incubation.",
    "Add 300 μL hi-FBS to the tube and triturate with a p1000 pipette to mix.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 2 mL TAB2 media with 10% FBS and 40 nM thiazovivin. The cell suspension is divided into four wells of a Synthemax-II-SC coated 24-well plate, 500 μL/well.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in the incubator 5% CO2, 20% O2. (See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: The cells should be left to adhere for at least 48 h without disturbing the plate. After this point the media should be exchanged with fresh TAB2 media every 2–4 days.\nNote: When expanding the cells, 10% hi-FBS can be added to increase cell proliferation rate. Once confluent, media should return to lower FBS concentration (2%–5%).\nNote: When cells are confluent, they can be used for experiments or be further expanded by lifting with trypsin and replating onto Synthemax-II-SC coated plates. All cell types are passaged as described below.\nExpansion of cells.\nAspirate the media and wash cells once with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL trypsin to each well to be lifted. Incubate cells with trypsin until they round-up and processes are visibly detaching.\nInactivate the trypsin by adding 0.5 mL 10% hi-FBS in PBS to each well.\nAgitate plate to lift cells and transfer cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and pellet cells by centrifugation, at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in TAB2 with 10% hi-FBS and 40 nM thiazovivin and replate cells 1:4 in Synthemax-II-SC coated plates.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in the incubator 5% CO2, 20% O2.",
    "Note: Cells should be used at low passage numbers (1–4) to avoid morphological and phenotypic changes. Cell identity can be verified with tissue type specific antibody stains, shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]. RPE cells should have cobblestone morphology and pigmentation. Scleral cells will be elongated, and cornea and limbus cells will look like fibroblast cells with patches for cobblestone morphology.\nInfection of SEAM cultures and ocular cells with SARS-CoV-2\nTiming: 24 h\nThis protocol describes how to inoculate SEAM-cultures with SARS-CoV-2 and maintain the cultures during infection. The same approach is applied when inoculating adult donor cells. When inoculating adult donor cells, serum-reduced SEAM media is swapped for TAB2 media, start at step 16.\nPrepare 50 mL serum reduced SEAM media.\nMix 47 mL GMEM with 1 mL knockout serum replacement, 0.5 mL GlutaMax, 0.5 mL non-essential amino acids, 0.5 mL penicillin-streptomycin solution, 0.5 mL sodium pyruvate and 19.2 μL β-mercaptoethanol stock (143 mM) to give a final concentration of 55 μM.\nFilter the media through a 0.2 μm sterile filter and store at 4°C until use, use within 1 month.\nNote: Infections must be performed in media with maximum 2% serum. For infection of adult donor cells, infections should be carried out in TAB2-media. TAB2-media has 2% serum as standard and can be used directly.\nWarm the serum-reduced SEAM-media to 37°C in a dry bath.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, prepare virus inoculum by diluting SARS-CoV-2 virus stock to 1 M.O.I. in 500 μL SEAM-media per 6-well to be infected.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, aspirate the media from the SEAM culture and replace with the prepared SARS-CoV-2 inoculum. In control wells, replace the media with serum reduced SEAM media without SARS-CoV-2.",
    "Place the SEAM-culture plate in the incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C, 5% CO2, 20% O2 for one hour and gently rock the plate every ten minutes to allow for even distribution of virus inoculum across the SEAM cultures.\nAfter one hour, move the plate back to the biosafety cabinet. Aspirate the inoculum and replace with 2 mL serum-reduced SEAM-media. Incubate the plate at 37°C until the experimental endpoint.\nProceed to qPCR, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), Plaque assay, or immunohistochemistry protocol.\nNote: In all cases except for the plaque assay, quantification of infection was done 24 h post infection. For the plaque assay samples were taken at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h post infection, see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nCritical: All work with SARS-CoV-2 virus must be carried out in a biosafety level 3 facility. When handling the virus, follow all CDC and institutionally approved guidelines. All waste material must be inactivated in an approved disinfectant and autoclaved before discarding.\nImmunohistochemistry\nTiming: 51 h\nThis protocol describes how to stain infected cells in 12-well plates, to evaluate infection and expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE2. The protocol can be used for cell type identifying markers and in SEAM cultures as well.\nFix cells with 4% PFA.\nAspirate the media from the infected cells and control cells.\nWash cells 3 times with 1 mL/well PBS.\nRemove PBS and add 1 mL of ice cold 4% PFA in PBS to each well. Seal the plate with parafilm and fix for a sufficient amount of time, following a protocol approved by your institution to ensure that the virus is completely inactivated, for our institution this is 24 h, at 4°C.\nAspirate the PFA solution and wash the cells 3 times with 1 mL/well PBS.",
    "Stain the cells with mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2-S and rabbit anti-ACE2.\nBlock for unspecific antibody binding.\nPrepare blocking buffer, (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nAspirate PBS and add 0.5 mL blocking buffer to each well. Leave cells to block for 1 h on a bench rocker at 15°C–25°C.\nAdd primary antibodies.\nPrepare staining buffer.\nPrepare dilutions of primary antibodies in staining buffer, 0.25 mL/well; mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 (1:100), rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:100).\nAspirate blocking buffer and incubate cells with primary antibodies on bench rocker at 4°C 12–18 h.\nWash and add secondary antibodies.\nAspirate the buffer and wash the cell by adding 0.25 mL/well fresh staining buffer and incubate on bench rocker for 5 min at 15°C–25°C. Repeat for a total of 3 washes.\nPrepare secondary antibodies diluted in staining buffer, 0.25 mL/well, goat-anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (1.1000) and goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-647 (1:500), lastly add the nuclear stain, DAPI (1:1000).\nAfter the last wash, aspirate the buffer and add 0.25 mL staining buffer with secondary antibody stains to each well. Incubate for 1 h on bench rocker at 15°C–25°C. Protect the plate from light to avoid bleaching of the fluorophores from this step onwards.\nAspirate the buffer and wash 3 × 5 min with PBS.\nAfter the final wash step, add PBS to cover cells. If proceeding directly to imaging, add minimal volume of PBS to cover cells for improved contrast in bright field images.\nOptional: For better, high-resolution imaging, SEAM cultures, and cells intended for immunohistochemical investigation, can be grown on glass bottom plates or cover slips.\nPause point: Stained cells can be stored in sealed plates at 4°C for up to two months. When storing cells, add PBS to prevent the plate from drying and 0.1% Na-azide to prevent bacterial growth.\nMeasuring infection in by qPCR\nTiming: 5.5 h",
    "This protocol describes how to quantify expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult donor ocular cells. This analysis is performed on fully confluent cells grown in 24-well plates and infected with 1 M.O.I. of SARS-CoV-2 24 h prior to starting this step of the protocol. The same protocol can be used for quantification of infection in SEAM cultures, adjusting the volumes to accommodate the larger well format in the lysis step.\nRNA extraction using TRIzol, adapted from Pub. No. 0001271 B.0.\nAspirate cell media and wash 3 times with 0.5 mL PBS.\nLyse cells by adding 500 μL TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) to each well and triturate the cells vigorously to lyse all cells before transferring the cell lysate to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate for 5 min at 15°C–25°C.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C for at least 1 year.\nAdd 100 μL chloroform to each tube, cap the tube thoroughly, and vortex the samples for 30 s.\nIncubate samples for 5 min at 15°C–25°C.\nPrecipitate the organic phase by centrifugating at >12,000 × g for 15 min.\nTransfer the aqueous phase (the top phase) to a new tube.

    "Preparation of single-cell library according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cat. No: CG000331 Rev C, 10 Genomics). Data analysis can be performed in R using the Seurat package (Stuart et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). A code workflow is available on NCBI GEO GSE165477.\nCritical: The subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 all have unique 5′ ends but share the same 3′ end. Hence, it is crucial to use a library prep kit that is based on 5′ capture of transcripts such as Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Kit v2 (10×, cat no. RN-10000265) in order to be able to distinguish between viral gene transcripts (Cohen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: The 10× protocol provides several possible pause points so that library preparation can be split up over several days if needed.\nPlaque assay\nTiming: 4 days\nPlaque assays are performed to show that a viral infection is productive and that there is true replication of the virus in the infected cells. Here we describe how to perform a plaque assay on infected SEAM cultures to show productive infection in the eye organoids; however, plaque assays can be carried out on any cell type grown and infected in vitro. The plaque assay protocol is also used to titer the concentration of infectious virus used for infection experiments.\nSeed Vero E6 cells at 400,000 cells/well in a 12 well plate and incubate cells at 37°C 5% CO2 12–18 h.\nFrom the infected SEAM cultures, take 1 mL of the used media from each well and transfer to a clean 1.5 mL tube, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1687-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(C) Make dilution series of media sample and add samples to Vero E6 cells in culture.\n(D) Add overlay media and incubate for 2–3 days.\n(E) Fix plate and stain with crystal violet, infected colonies will be visible as white dots.\nSpin the samples for 5 min at 300 × g to pellet any cells and transfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5 mL tube, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nMake a logarithmic dilution series of the conditioned media samples.\nTo make a 10-1X sample, take 100 μL conditioned media and dilute it with 900 μL Modified DMEM, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C.\nTo make a 10-2X sample, take 100 μL of the 10-1X sample and dilute it with 900 μL Modified DMEM.\nContinue as described above until a dilution of 10-6.\nInoculate the Vero E6 using conditioned media samples.\nAspirate the media and replace with 900 μL modified DMEM.\nAdd 100 μL diluted infected sample media in each well.\nAllow virus adsorption by incubating for 1 h at 37°C 5% CO2, agitating the plate every 10 min.\nAdd solid overlay.\nAspirate the inoculation media.\nAdd 1 mL/well overlay media, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D.\nIncubate for 48–60 h at 37°C 5% CO2.\nNote: Make overlay media with oxoid agar fresh every time.\nFix the plates by adding 1 mL/well 4% PFA and incubate for a sufficient amount of time to ensure complete inactivation of infectious virus approved by your institution.\nRemove the fixative and stain each well by adding 1 mL/well crystal violet solution in 20% ethanol and incubate for 15 min at 15°C–25°C.\nAspirate the staining solution and determine viral titers (PFU/mL) by counting white colonies of dead cells in each sample, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E (see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] under troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])."
