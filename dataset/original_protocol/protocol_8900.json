    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) regulations on mice ~3-5 months old. The author declares no competing financial interests.\n1. Animal Perfusion and Tissue Preparation\nTiming: 30-60 min per mouse + post-fixation (a few hours to overnight).\nWeigh the animal and anesthetize using ketamine (80-200 mg/kg) and xylazine (7-20 mg/kg) or 2.5% avertin (0.5 ml/25 g body weight IP).\nWait a few minutes for anesthesia to take complete effect.\nPinch the toe and tail of the animal to make sure that the animal is fully anesthetized.\nPerfuse the animal first at RT with 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer (PB) or 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) for 5-10 min until the blood is completely removed from the tissue.\nSwitch the perfusion to fixative solution: 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB (or 0.1 M PBS) and continue perfusion with 4% PFA for 30-40 min at a speed of 3 ml/min.\nDissect the organ/s of interest carefully without damaging, e.g., avoid puncturing and squeezing the tissue that is being dissected.\nRemove the extra tissue surrounding the organs (connective tissue, meninges or dura matter) in a petri dish filled with PBS.\nPost-fix the organs in 4% PFA for a few hr or overnight at 4 ºC. Avoid long post-fixation because PFA might quench the signal or increase the autofluorecense overtime10 especially for GFP channel (which is a lesser problem in red and far red channels).\nWash the organs 2-3x with PBS at RT just before starting the clearing procedure.\n2. Tissue Clearing\nTiming: 2-3 hr for small organs and 1-4 days for large organs.",
    "Notes: The fluorescent labeling of the tissues by transgene expression, viral transfection, dye tracing or antibody labeling should be completed before clearing. All tissue clearing steps are performed at RT. The clearing solutions THF, DBE, BABB (1 part benzyl alcohol and 2 part benzyl benzoate) and dichloromethane are toxic and inhalation (conduct experiments in properly ventilated fume hood) and direct contact with skin should be avoided (use nitrile gloves).\nPrepare 50% (vol/vol), 70%, and 80% THF dilutions in distilled water in separate glass bottles as follows: For 50% THF, e.g., mix 25 ml THF and 25 ml of distilled water in a glass bottle with volume of larger than 50 ml.\nMix solutions by gently shaking the bottle for a 1-2 min.\nLabel the glass bottle clearly.\nSecurely close the bottles and keep the working solutions in a dark cabinet. For the best results, do not use the same working solutions longer than 1-2 weeks. Therefore, order the clearing solutions as the smallest volume available to be able use fresh stock reagents.\nFill the glass vials (e.g., 2-3 ml) with the first clearing solution, 50% THF, and transfer the organs from PBS into glass vials to start clearing.\nSecurely close the glass vials with their lids and use a rotator (e.g., a wheel stirrer) for stirring.\nUse aluminum foil to cover and keep the glass vials in dark. Start the rotator to stir the samples in the glass vials for the indicated time (Table 1) at a constant speed (~30 rpm).\nRemove the clearing solution and add the next one in the protocol when the time in Table 1 is completed.\nCollect the clearing waste into glass waste containers that are kept in a hood.",
    "Repeat previous step for each clearing solution in the protocol until the end. Use a new pasteur pipette when a new clearing solution is added (e.g., changing from THF to DBE).\nAt the final clearing step with BABB or DBE, the incubation times can be extended or shortened until the samples become completely transparent in visible light (or yellowish/transparent if it is a very large tissue like brain).\nKeep the cleared organs in the final clearing solution at all times including the imaging steps.\n3. Preparing Cleared Organs for Imaging\nTiming: 5-15 min.\nNote: Image the cleared organs as soon as a complete clearing is achieved. To this end, follow the next steps to prepare the samples for light-sheet microscopy (e.g., ultramicroscopy) or confocal/multi-photon microscopy imaging.\nNote: Cleared organs will loose their fluorescence strength over time (particularly fluorescent proteins e.g., GFP; antibody labeling is more resistant and may even give better results with longer incubations). For imaging, various fluorescent microscopy techniques can be used as long as proper handling of the organs in the clearing solution is achieved.\nFor light-sheet microscopy\n\t\nPlace or mount the sample appropriately.\nFix the cleared organ by manually turning the screw of the sample holder4.\nDip the sample into the imaging chamber (preferably made of glass) of thelight-sheet microscope that is filled with BABB or DBE, whichever was used at the final clearing step.\nFor multi photon/confocal microscopy\n\t\nMount the sample on an imaging slide (or an imaging chamber) with the final imaging solution to be able to image with a multi photon or confocal microscopy, which typically use oil or water immersed objectives.\nUse dental cement to make a border around the tissue.\nFill the pool with BABB or DBE just before dental cement gets fully rigid.",
    "Note: The dental cement solidifies quickly; practice a few times to get familiar with it before trying the actual samples.\nImmediately place the cleared sample in the middle of the pool and cover it with a cover glass.\nPress the cover glass until it is completely sealed by dental cement and touches at the surface of the cleared organ, which will allow reaching the maximum imaging depth by confocal/multi-photon microscopy.\n\t\tNotes: This ensures that no clearing solution will be spilled during the imaging. Avoid dipping the imaging lens directly into clearing solution, which can harm the lens unless it is resistant to BABB/DBE or has a protective cover.\n4. Imaging Cleared Organs\nTiming: 15-45 min.\nCollect a z-scan covering the entire cleared tissue (if the used lens allows) at the best resolution that the microscope can deliver.\nZoom in on the regions of interest to collect higher resolution images.\n5. Examination of the Data with Software Amira\nLoad the image series to software Amira with ResolveRT module.\nEnter the correct voxel sizes in “Image Read Parameter” window and press ok.\nSelect the “Multi Planer View” sub-application. Then use the “Thickness” slider to choose the optimum threshold for the gray values, adjusting the 2D and 3D values.\nVisualize the sample by browsing the slices in different 2D orientations and using crop-corner module in 3D view.\n\tNote: A detailed troubleshooting guide of the protocol can be found in Ertürk et al4."
