    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRNA is highly sensitive to RNases. RNases can be present on your skin and surfaces.\nTo avoid RNase contamination of your samples and to reduce their activity as much as possible, please adhere to the following tips:\nCritical: Wash surfaces, pipettes, tube racks, and pipette boxes before starting using Vikron, 1% bleach or RNase Away and do not touch anything without gloves from here on.\nCritical: Keep everything cold.\nCritical: Use pipette tips with filters.\nCritical: Use DNase/RNase free 1.5 mL tubes, water and PBS.\nCritical: Frequently change gloves to ensure they are clean.\nTissue dissection and homogenization (day 1)\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nIn this step, we describe how the brain region of interest, striatum in this case, can be dissected and homogenized (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1670-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Step-by-step illustration of the RiboTag immunoprecipitation protocol\nLN – Liquid nitrogen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1670-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Step-by-step dissection protocol with pictures illustrating how to extract mouse stritatum, hippocampus, and cortex\nThe scale bars represent 6 mm.\nCull and decapitate the mouse following institutionally approved procedures. Extract the brain and put it on a petri dish filled with RNase free PBS under the dissection microscope.\nDissect the area of interest. For striatum:\nCut the brain sagittally in two halves (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nFor each half, remove the thalamus and hippocampus. When the striatum is exposed, scoop the striatum to detach it from the cortex. This can be achieved with fine curved forceps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove the corpus callosum that may have remained bound to the striatum until is clean (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPut the two striata from a mouse into the Dounce homogenizer and homogenize the samples at 2%–10% weight/volume, i.e., 1 mL of S-HB solution for two striata from the same brain (30 mg).",
    "Homogenize first with pestle “A” up and down 10 times.\nHomogenize then with pestle “B” for 15–20 times.\nNote: In between homogenization steps the Douncer can be kept on ice to avoid heating of the sample due to the friction.\nNote: Homogenization steps can be repeated if the tissue does not appear to homogenize, as long as the sample stays cold.\nTransfer the homogenized sample to a 1.5 mL tube labeled with the sample ID.\nCritical: Between samples, clean the Douncer with RNase free water 3 times (5–10 strokes per pestle each time) to avoid contamination between samples.\nCritical: During tissue dissection and homogenization, speed is very important. RNAs are exposed to RNases as soon as the mouse is culled. Even though the homogenization buffer contains RNase inhibitors, the probability of RNA degradation increases with time. The homogenized samples should be kept on ice until the entire group is processed. We recommend spending no more than 90 min for the dissection and homogenization step to preserve RNA integrity.\nSample processing (day 1)\nTiming: 4.5 h\nOn day 1, the sample processing involves clearing the homogenized samples from brain debris, collecting a whole tissue (INPUT) sample for RNA extraction, e incubating the rest of the sample with anti-HA antibody and magnetic beads to pull down cell specific RNAs on Day 2 (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). 1.5 mL collection tubes for this step can be labeled in advance as IP+HA, INPUT, IP+BEADS, one of each per sample.\nCentrifuge the samples in 1.5 mL tubes at 4°C/10,000 g/10 min.\nTransfer supernatant to the tube labeled IP+HA.\nINPUT SAMPLE.",
    "Take 5%–10% of the supernatant in the tube IP+HA and transfer it to the INPUT sample tube. If the striata were homogenized with 1 mL of S-HB, 50–100 μL can be transferred to the INPUT tube.\nNote: With 5% of the supernatant for the INPUT sample, we usually obtain 4 times the RNA yield of its corresponding IP sample. If more INPUT RNA is needed, up to 10% of the supernatant can be taken. We do not recommend taking more than 10% since it would decrease significantly the IP RNA amount.\nAdd 400 μL of Lysis Buffer (1:100 β-mercaptoethanol:RLT buffer from RNeasy kit).\nVortex 10–30 s.\nFreeze in liquid nitrogen or dry ice and store at −80°C.\nIP SAMPLE.\nAdd 5 μL of anti-HA antibody to each IP sample (in the IP+HA tube), this is a ratio of ∼1:200 vol/vol and 1 μL of antibody for 6 mg of tissue.\nNote: We typically use mouse anti-HA from BioLegend but rabbit anti-HA from Cell signaling also works (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nIncubate for 4 h at 4°C on a gentle spinner at 20 revolutions per minute (rpm; for Miltenyi tube rotator).\nPierce beads preparation (about 30 min before the 4 h IP+HA incubation ends):\nVortex the bead stock vigorously before using to homogenize the beads.\nAdd 200 μL of beads to the IP+BEADS 1.5 mL tubes.\nPlace the tubes on the magnet and discard the storage buffer solution.\nAdd 800–1,000 μL of HB to the beads immediately.\nVortex 10–30 s.\nIncubate the beads at 4°C on a gentle spinner for 10 min at 20 rpm.\nPlace the IP+BEADS tube on the magnet and discard the buffer.\nQuickly add the IP+HA sample to its corresponding IP+BEADS tube.\nIncubate 14–16 h at 4°C on a gentle spinner at 20 rpm.",
    "Critical: Do not let the beads dry between washes.\nNote: Protocol could be optimized for shorter incubation times. However, RNA amount and quality should be checked first.\nSample processing (day 2)\nTiming: 1 h\nOn day 2, the IP samples will be washed several times before mixing them with the lysis buffer for RNA extraction (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPlace IP+BEADS tubes on the magnetic rack.\nDiscard the supernatant; the HA-ribosome/RNA complex will be bound to the beads.\nWash the beads adding 800 μL of high salt buffer to each sample immediately after removing the liquid.\nIncubate at 4°C on a gentle spinner for 10 min.\nRepeat the washes a total of 3 times.\nPlace tubes on the magnetic rack.\nDiscard the high salt buffer.\nAdd 350 μL of Lysis Buffer (1:100 β-mercaptoethanol:RLT buffer from RNeasy kit) to the beads of each sample immediately.\nVortex vigorously for 30 s (to break apart the antibody-bead-protein bond).\nFreeze in liquid nitrogen or dry ice and store at −80°C.\nCritical: Do not let the beads dry between washes.\nRNA purification\nTiming: 1 h\nRNA purification will be performed following QIAGEN recommendations. It can be done any time after the samples processing steps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Nonetheless, to ensure RNA integrity, we recommend not to keep the samples longer than 3 months in the −80°C freezer.\nThaw the INPUT and IP+BEADS samples on ice.\nCritical: For the IP RNA, remove the beads (now unbound from the ribosomes and RNA) placing the tubes on the magnetic rack and use the supernatant for RNA purification with RNeasy Micro QIAGEN kit.\nProceed with the RNeasy Micro QIAGEN kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/gb/resources/resourcedetail?id=e112adfa-cc06-4e29-87f8-4820062ae44e&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/gb/resources/resourcedetail?id=e112adfa-cc06-4e29-87f8-4820062ae44e&lang=en]).",
    "Critical: Purified RNA should be stored at −80°C and freeze/thaw cycles should be avoided to preserve RNA quality and avoid degradation. Before freezing we recommend to set aside an aliquot of the sample for quality assessment, the volume will depend on the assay used (see below). This way the sample that will be used for the translatome assessment does not need to be thawed until the day of the experiment.\nRNA integrity evaluation\nTiming: 1 h\nRNA integrity assessment is needed to ensure that RNA has not degraded during the purification protocol (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], and Schroeder et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] for more information). This is important because if the RNA molecules are fragmented, the amplification necessary for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or RNA-seq experiments will be affected by the shortened RNA length and consequently the gene expression results will be less accurate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1670-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example of IP RNA integrity assessment by Agilent Bioanalyzer\n(A and B) Examples of good quality, high RIN RNA with electrophoresis gel picture at the top and electropherogram at the bottom.\n(C) Example of poor quality, medium RIN RNA with electrophoresis gel picture at the top and electropherogram at the bottom.\n(D) Example of bad quality, low RIN RNA with electrophoresis gel picture at the top and electropherogram at the bottom. Automatic detection of the lower band, and 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands are highlighted with a blue line.\nRNA integrity and abundance can be assessed using for example an Agilent Bioanalyzer.",
    "Note: This instrument performs a miniature electrophoresis with 1–2 μL of the RNA sample to determine its integrity based on the electrophoresis band pattern that is analyzed by the software. It provides an RNA integrity number (RIN) and an estimation of the RNA concentration. The RIN scale goes from 0, highly degraded RNA, to 10, RNA with high integrity. RNA samples with RIN > 8 are ideal for qRT-PCR or RNA-seq experiments (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCell specificity assessment\nTiming: 1–2 days\nWe recommend checking the cell specificity of the RNA purified if the protocol is performed for the first time, you are investigating new brain regions, or using new CRE mouse lines (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). To check RNA cell specificity, qRT-PCR can be used. To this aim, specific primers targeting RNAs enriched in the cell of interest and primers targeting RNAs enriched in potential contaminating cells should be used (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1670-Mmc1.xlsx]). Input sample can be used as a control for non-enrichment of cell-type RNAs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1670-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example of cell specificity assessment by qRT-PCR in Aldh1l1-CreERT2::RiboTag brain samples\n(A) RNA expression as 2-Δ Ct (gene of interest) – Ct (Rplp0) of different cell markers in the IP fraction shows enrichment of the astrocyte marker Aldh1l1. Parametric data. RM one-way ANOVA (p=.008) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (∗p < .05).",
    "(B) RNA expression as 2-Δ Ct (gene of interest) – Ct (Rplp0) of different cell markers in the INPUT fraction shows no enrichment of the astrocyte marker Aldh1l1 over other cell markers. Nonparametric data. Friedmand test (p=.001) followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test (∗p < .05). Aldh1l1: astrocyte, NeuN: neuron, Iba-1: microglia, Olig2: oligodendrocyte markers. All markers were normalized to the housekeeping ribosome-protein encoding gene Rplp0. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. The quantitative data for this figure can be found in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1670-Mmc1.xlsx].\nTranscribe complementary DNA (cDNA) from the purified RNA using SuperScript™ IV Reverse Transcriptase following manufacturer instructions (https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/SSIV_Reverse_Transcriptase_UG.pdf[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/SSIV_Reverse_Transcriptase_UG.pdf]). With this enzyme we reverse transcribe 20 ng of RNA.\nOnce the cDNA is generated, make a 1:10 dilution of the cDNA stock.\nUse 5 μL of the cDNA stock for each qRT-PCR reaction.\nNote: If the amount of RNA is not sufficient to complete the qRT-PCR experiment, Ovation PicoSL WTA System V2 cDNA amplification kit can be used for transcription and amplification, instead of the SuperScript transcriptase, following the manufacturer instructions (https://www.tecan.com/hubfs/HubDB/Te-DocList/UG_Ovation_PicoSL_WTA_System_V2.pdf[href=https://www.tecan.com/hubfs/HubDB/Te-DocList/UG_Ovation_PicoSL_WTA_System_V2.pdf]).\nqRT-PCR can be performed in any qRT-PCR system. To measure the amplification of cDNA during qRT-PCR you can use Fast Sybr Green Master Mix or similar and follow manufacturer protocol (https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_046776.pdf[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_046776.pdf]).\nFor the reaction to take place, Fast Sybr Green Master Mix can be mixed with 5 μL of the 1:10 diluted cDNA stock per reaction and a pair of gene specific oligonucleotides (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1670_4.csv",
    "Note: The amount of cDNA used for the reaction may vary depending on the level of expression of the gene that will be assessed. If the gene normally has low expression levels, you may need to add more cDNA in order to detect it with qRT-PCR. We recommend performing tests with different dilutions of cDNA before the final experiment, to assess the best amount for your application.\nAlternatives: Taqman probes can be used as an alternative to Sybr Green and oligonucleotides.\nCell specific gene expression is calculated relative to the housekeeping Rplp0 based on their Ct values using the formula: 2-ΔCt (ΔCt = Ct (gene of interest) – Ct (housekeeping gene) (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: Relative cell enrichment calculations, e.g., expression of an astrocyte gene/neuron gene, can be misleading because they indicate enrichment of a marker over another cell marker but do not show if the level of expression of genes from the non-targeted cell are considerable. Instead, we recommend assessing and presenting the expression of cell-specific genes relative to one or two housekeeping genes. They can also be presented as a ratio of enrichment in the IP vs its corresponding INPUT samples. This cell specificity assessment should not be taken as a substitute for testing with immunohistochemistry, detailed above (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Immunohistochemistry of the HA tag and a marker targeting the cell of interest and other unrelated cell types is necessary to assess cell specific RiboTag expression.\nFor the statistical analysis of the qRT-PCR results:\nCheck if your replicates follow normal distributions with a normality test (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).\nCheck if the variance is homogeneous between conditions with tests that assess homogeneity of variance (e.g., Brown-Forsythe test).\nIf data are normally distributed and variances are homogeneous between conditions, use repeated measure (RM) one-way ANOVA test.",
    "If not, use Friedman’s test.\nIf c or d show statistical significance, differences between specific groups can be assessed with post-hoc tests like Tukey’s or Dunn’s respectively.\nNote: Since several genes are measured in the same sample it is important to take into account the matching effect between them. Both RM one-way ANOVA and Friedman’s test compare the means of three or more matched groups."
