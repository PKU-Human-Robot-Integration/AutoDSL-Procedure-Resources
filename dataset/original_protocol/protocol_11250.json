    "Human tissue samples were obtained with the approval of the Research Ethics Board of the Hospital Ramón y Cajal, Madrid.\n1. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare 0.2% gelatin solution: add 1 g of gelatin to 500 mL of PBS. Autoclave the solution and keep at 4 °C. Filter with a 0.22 µm filter before use.\nPrepare 1% glutaraldehyde: Add 1 mL of 25% glutaraldehyde stock solution to 24 mL of PBS. Filter with a 0.22 µm filter before use.\nPrepare 1 M ethanolamine: prepare ethanolamine solution with sterile H2O. Filter with a 0.22 µm filter before use.\nNOTE: As ethanolamine is provided with a security cap, a needle and syringe will be needed.\nPrepare ascorbic acid: add 0.1 mL of 50 mg/mL stock solution ascorbic acid (light-sensitive) to 100 mL of medium.\nPrepare lysis buffer: prepare PBS 0.5% Triton 100X with 20 nM of NH4OH. Add NH4OH right before use.\nPrepare PBS Pen/Strep: dilute Pen/Strep stock solution to 100 U/mL Pen and 100 µg/mL Strep.\nPrepare DMEM with 10% FBS: Add 10% FBS to 500 mL of DMEM. Supplement with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 0.1 mg/mL Normocin and 0.25 µg/mL amphotericin B.\nPrepare 2% BSA heat denatured: add 2 g of BSA to 100 mL of sterile water. Warm in boiling water for 7 min.\nPrepare FBS with antibiotics: supplement FBS with 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 µg/mL gentamicin and 2.5 g/mL amphotericin B.\n2. Cell Culture Preparation\nImmortalized fibroblasts cell line\n\t\nCulture recombinant telomerase transfected immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (BJ-hTERT, ATCC CRL-4001) in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintain at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nEndothelial cells\n\t\nCulture human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, ATCC PCS-100-013) in EBM-2 medium containing 2% FBS and maintain at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nFibroblast primary culture",
    "NOTE: For CAF establishment and culture, the protocol previously published by our group was followed6.\n\t\nBriefly, cut tissue samples into small pieces of approximately 2-3 mm3 and seed in FBS with high concentration of antibiotics.\nWhen the first fibroblasts appeared, replace medium with FBM medium for cell maintenance.\nNOTE: Depending on tissue origin, cell cultures can be contaminated easily. Wash samples in PBS supplemented with antibiotics, with highly contaminated tissue (e.g., colon6) and shake for 30-45 min.\n3. Fibroblast-derived 3D Matrices (Adapted from Castelló-Cros and Cukierman16)\nAdd 2 mL of 0.2% gelatin solution to each well of a 6-well plate and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C.\nAspirate gelatin and wash it in 2 mL of PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of 1% glutaraldehyde and incubate for 30 min at RT. Glutaraldehyde will cross-link gelatin.\nAspirate glutaraldehyde and wash wells in 2 mL of PBS for 5 min. Repeat 3 times.\nAdd 2 mL of 1 M ethanolamine and incubate for 30 min at RT. Ethanolamine will act to block the remaining glutaraldehyde.\nAspirate ethanolamine and wash wells in 2 mL of PBS for 5 min. Repeat 3 times.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS. If the medium immediately turns pink, remove the medium, wash in 2 mL of PBS and add again 1 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS.\nSeed 1 mL of fibroblast suspension, with 5 x 105 cells in each well. Total volume in each well will be 2 mL.\nCulture cells until 100% confluence is reached. Then remove the medium and replace with DMEM with 10% FBS with 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid and additional treatment if used.\nReplace medium with fresh DMEM with 10% FBS and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid every 2 days for 6 days.",
    "NOTE: If additional treatment is used (e.g., PDGF-BB, TGF-β and/or other grow factors), add them the same days as ascorbic acid treatment is added.\nTwo days after the last ascorbic acid treatment, remove the medium and wash in 2 mL of PBS.\nSlowly add 1 mL of lysis buffer, pre-heated at 37 °C, to each well. Incubate for 5-10 min at RT until fibroblasts are lysed (observable under the microscope).\nCarefully and without removing lysis buffer, add 2 mL of PBS. Then aspirate approximately 2.5 mL of PBS. Repeat twice for a total of three washes.\nEventually, remove 2.5 mL of PBS and add 2 mL of PBS with Pen/Strep (100 U/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively). Seal with film and keep at 4 °C for up to 3 months.\nNOTE: Depending on the experiment, long-term storage of the generated matrices may affect results. We recommend using matrices as soon as possible, and even more so if the experiment involves cell seeding, due to possible protein degradation. If matrices are used for structural assays, such as collagen observation, matrices can be fixed and stored for longer periods. This protocol is indicated for a 6-well culture plate. Other plates can be used, but reactive volumes and cell suspension concentration need to be recalculated according to well area.\n4. Tube Formation Assay\nGrow HUVEC cells in EBM-2 2% FBS until maximum confluence.\nReplace medium with EBM-2 without FBS for 8 h.\nPrepare matrices before seeding cells.\n\t\nRemove matrices from the refrigerator and place for 1 h at RT.\nBlock matrices by adding 2 mL of heat-denatured 2% BSA. Incubate 1 h at 37 °C.\nAspirate BSA and wash in 2 mL of PBS.",
    "Seed 2 x 105 HUVEC cells in FBS-depleted medium on each well of a 6-well plate previously coated with 3D fibroblast-derived matrices.\nIncubate endothelial cells at 37 °C for 16 h.\nExamine tube-like structure formation under a standard bright field microscope at 20-40x magnification.\nSubscription Required.
