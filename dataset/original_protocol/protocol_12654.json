  "procedures": [
    "All methods involving zebrafish were carried out using ethical standards approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UC Davis.\n1. Chromosome spreading procedure\nNOTE: The following protocol is designed to create 4-6 slides, with hundreds of spread meiotic nuclei per slide. The numbers of testes used will depend on the size of the fish. Expect to use 20 animals at ~60 days post fertilization (dpf) and 15 animals at ~6 months post fertilization (mpf). For large zebrafish (e.g., 12 mpf) 10 animals should be sufficient. Be aware that testes of some meiotic mutants (e.g., spo11-/-) will be somewhat smaller3. In this protocol, one pool of testes is considered as a single sample. It is recommended that no more than 4 samples are prepared in parallel.\nMake the following solutions before starting the spreading procedure\n\tNOTE: It is convenient to prepare the following solutions in the quantities specified for use in future spreading experiments.\n\t\nPrepare a 0.1 M sucrose solution by dissolving 3.42 g of sucrose in 100 mL of distilled water. Bring the sucrose solution to pH 8 using 1 M Tris-HCl that is also at pH 8. Then filter sterilize the sucrose solution. Store at room temperature.\nMake a 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) stock solution to a final concentration of 1.37 M NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 73 mM Na2HPO4 and 27.6 mM KH2PO4 in 1.8 L of distilled water. Stir until dissolved, then adjust pH to 7.3 using NaOH and autoclave. Store at room temperature.\nMake a 400 µg/mL DNase I solution in sterile distilled water. Store at -20 °C. It is recommended to prepare 5 mL of this solution and then store as 100 µL aliquots.\nMake the following solutions on the day of the spreading protocol",
    "NOTE: For time efficiency, it is best to make the collagenase solution immediately after dissecting all testes and then make the trypsin and trypsin inhibitor solutions during the time that the samples are being treated in collagenase.\n\t\nDissolve 4 mg of collagenase in 200 µL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) per sample (2% w/v collagenase final concentration). Keep on ice until needed. The collagenase will dissociate the testes.\nDissolve 1.4 mg of trypsin in 200 µL of DMEM per sample (0.7% w/v trypsin final concentration). Keep on ice until needed. The trypsin will help dissociate the cells.\nDissolve 10 mg of trypsin inhibitor in 500 µL of DMEM per sample (2% w/v trypsin inhibitor final concentration). Keep on ice until needed. Trypsin inhibitor prevents trypsin from degrading the cells.\nPrepare a 1% formaldehyde solution (from a 16% pre-made solution) with 0.15% Triton X-100 in sterile distilled water. Keep on ice until needed. The 1% formaldehyde can be prepared while the testes are being treated with trypsin and DNase I (i.e., during step 1.4.7 of the spreading procedure).\n\t\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde is hazardous.\nDissection of testes from adult male zebrafish\nEuthanize male zebrafish (> 60 dpf) by submerging them in ice water. The fish can be kept in ice water until ready to dissect, however they should be dissected as soon as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: The wild-type strain AB is used for this procedure, but other wild-type strains should also be amenable. The longest time we have kept fish in ice water prior to dissecting is 3 h without any noticeable effect on the protocol.\nDecapitate one fish at a time with small scissors and then use micro scissors to cut along the ventral midline to expose the body cavity.",
    "Dissect the testis using forceps (see Table of Materials) at 1.65x magnification under a microscope. Carry out the dissections in a silicone-coated Petri dish with covered by a shallow pool of 1x PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The testis is located in between the swim bladder and the intestine and will appear lighter than muscle tissue (Figure 2A). The testis should have 2 lobes when removed from the zebrafish (Figure 2B).\nRemove as much fat and surrounding tissue from the testis as possible. Then add each dissected testis directly into a 5 mL tube with 2 mL of DMEM and keep on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 should be mastered prior to doing any experiments.\nDissociation of testes cells\nPre-warm 100 mL of 0.1 M sucrose solution to 37 °C.\nAdd 200 µL of collagenase solution to the 5 mL tube with the testes. Mix the solution by inverting it several times.\nGently shake the testes in an incubator shaker horizontally at 100 rpm at 32 °C for 50 min to an hour until the DMEM is cloudy and the testes are in small chunks. Rapidly invert the tube every 10 min to facilitate dissociation.\nTo wash out the collagenase, add DMEM to a final 5 mL volume and invert the tube a few times. Pellet the testes at ~200 x g for 3 min at room temperature. Remove 3 mL of the supernatant so that only 2 mL remains.\n\t\tNOTE: The addition, removal, and transfer of DMEM is done with plastic transfer pipettes for the entirety of the chromosome spread procedure.\nRepeat step 1.4.4 twice more for a total of 3 DMEM washes. Do not resuspend the pellet between DMEM washes. After the last DMEM wash, remove 4 mL of the supernatant so that only 1 mL remains.",
    "Add 1 mL of DMEM for a total volume of 2 mL and add 200 µL of the trypsin solution and 20 µL of DNase I solution. Invert the tube a few times to mix the solution.\nHorizontally shake the tube at 32 °C for 5-15 min at 100 rpm until the DMEM solution contains only a few clumps. Rapidly invert the tube every 5 min to facilitate dissociation.\n\t\tNOTE: The clumps should be considerably smaller after shaking.\nAdd 500 µL of the trypsin inhibitor solution and 50 µL of DNase I solution. Invert the tube a few times to mix, then briefly spin down at ~200 x g for 3 min at room temperature to remove liquid or clumps that may adhere to the tube cap or the side of the tube.\nPlace the tube on ice and resuspend the cell suspension by repeatedly pipetting up and down with a plastic transfer pipette for 2 min to facilitate dissociation of any remaining clumps. Do not let the cell suspension go into the bulb of the transfer pipette. After the 2 min, pipette the suspension back into the 5 mL tube.\nPre-wet a 100 µm cell strainer with DMEM and place it on top of a 50 mL tube on ice.\nTransfer the cell suspension through the strainer one drop at a time using a plastic transfer pipette. Ensure that the cell suspension does not go into the bulb of the transfer pipette.\nTransfer the filtrate using a plastic transfer pipette to a new 5 mL tube and add DMEM to a final volume of 5 mL. Be sure to collect the pooled cells attached to the underside of the filter with a clean plastic transfer pipette. Pellet the cells at ~200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Remove as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 5 µL of DNase I solution directly into the pellet. Then mix the pellet with the DNase I solution by gently scraping the outside bottom of the tube 4-5 times along an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube rack. Scraping too harshly can result in a reduction of recovered spreads.\nAdd DMEM to a final volume of 5 mL and mix the solution by inverting the tube several times. It is common for clumps to still be present after the first DNase I treatment.\nPellet the cell suspension at ~200 x g for 2 min at room temperature.\nRepeat steps 1.4.13-1.4.16 an additional 1-3 times until the resuspended pellet does not clump upon addition of DMEM. After the last spin, remove as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: Expect a reduction in pellet size with every DNase I treatment; exceeding 4 total DNase I washes may result in significant loss of cells. If no pellet is visible after the DNase I treatments steps, do not proceed with the procedure. Discard any unused DNase I.\nAdd 1 mL of 1x PBS and resuspend the pellet by gently scraping the outside bottom of the tube along an empty 1.5 mL tube rack.\nPellet the cell suspension at ~200 x g for 5 min then remove as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nCut ~3 mm from the end of a 200 µL pipette tip to widen the aperture and resuspend the pellet in ~80 µL of 0.1 M sucrose solution by pipetting up and down with the cut pipette tip. Let the cell suspension sit at room temperature for 3 min.\nSpreading chromosomes on glass slides",
    "Coat one slide with 100 µL of 1% formaldehyde with 0.15% Triton X-100 with the side of a pipette tip. Then add 18 µL of the sucrose cell suspension onto the center of the slide in a straight line perpendicular to the long edge. Tilt the slide back and forth (~60°) to facilitate spreading of the cell suspension to all corners.\nPlace the slides flat down in a slightly cracked open humidity chamber (Figure 3) to prevent the formaldehyde solution from drying. Place the humidity chamber in a dark drawer overnight.\nRemove the lid from the humidity chamber and allow the slides to fully dry.\nPlace the slides in a Coplin jar then fill the Coplin jar with distilled water and incubate for 5 min with gentle shaking at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The slides can be placed in the Coplin jar in a zigzag pattern to maximize the number of slides per Coplin jar. Make sure there is space for liquid to pass between all the slides.\nPour out the water and fill the jar with 1:250 wetting agent (see Table of Materials). Wash 2 times for 5 min each with gentle shaking at room temperature.\nAllow the slides to fully dry and store at -20 °C until they are stained.\n\t\tNOTE: The longest we have stored slides without any noticeable degradation of the chromosomes is ~2 months.\n2. Telomere PNA probe staining\nNOTE: Telomere repeats can be stained using fluorophore-conjugated telomere PNA probes that hybridize to leading strand telomere repeats (CCCTAA). PNA probes have a neutral backbone, which increases hybridization affinity to negatively charged DNA, resulting in little to no background. The telomere probing step is optional. To proceed to antibody staining, rehydrate slides in 1x PBS as indicated in step 2.2.2., then proceed directly to \"Primary antibody staining\".",
    "Make the PNA probe reagents before starting the telomere staining\n\tNOTE: It is convenient to prepare the following solutions in the quantities specified for use in future experiments. Storage conditions are noted below.\n\t\nPrepare 2 L of 20x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) solution with a final concentration of 3 M NaCl and 0.3 M sodium citrate. Autoclave and store at room temperature.\nMake 50 mL of pre-hybridization solution containing transfer RNA to a final concentration of 50% formamide, 5x SSC, 50 µg/mL heparin, 500 µg/mL transfer RNA, 0.1% Tween 20 and add 460 µL of 1 M citric acid to bring the solution to pH ~6. Store at -20 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formamide is hazardous. Prepare the solution in a fume hood.\nMake 50 mL of pre-hybridization solution prepared in the same way as in step 2.1.2 without adding transfer RNA. Store at -20 °C.\nPNA telomere probes TelC-Cy3 and TelC-Alexa647 are prepared as 50 µM stocks in formamide as per manufacturer's instructions. Store the PNA probes as 8 µL aliquots at -80 °C.\nMake at least 1 mL of 100 mg/mL stock solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in sterile distilled water. Store at -20 °C. If preparing more than 1 mL of stock BSA, store the solution as 1 mL aliquots.\nUsing a 2 mL tube, prepare 2 mL of hybridization solution by adding 27 µL of 100 mg/mL BSA and 8 µL of 50 µM PNA probe to 1.965 mL of pre-hybridization solution containing transfer RNA. Store in the dark at -20 °C.\nPNA telomere probe staining\nPreheat the hybridization oven to 82 °C.\nRe-hydrate slides with 500 µL of 1x PBS per slide for 5 min in a humidity chamber at room temperature. Remove the PBS by tapping the side of the slide on a paper towel.",
    "Heat the slides and the 2 mL tube containing the hybridization solution directly on a metal surface in the heated hybridization oven for 2 min.\nWhile keeping the slides on the metal surface, add 100 µL of the hybridization solution per slide and then cover the slides with plastic coverslips (~25 mm x 75 mm) cut to shape out of an autoclave bag. Let slides sit at 82 °C for 10-12 min.\nPlace the slides in a humidity chamber in the dark at 37 °C for 16-24 h. From this point forward and for the primary and secondary antibody staining, the slides must be kept in the dark to avoid photobleaching of the fluorescence signal. After the incubation period, the reagents for antibody staining can be prepared during step 2.2.9.\nRemove the coverslips with a pipette tip.\n\t\tNOTE: To facilitate removal of the coverslip, ~50-100 µL of the hybridization solution with no transfer RNA can be gently dispensed between the slide and the coverslip as the coverslip is being lifted.\nPipette 500 µL of pre-hybridization solution with no transfer RNA onto each slide and place the slides in the humidity chamber for 15 min at room temperature. Remove the solution by tapping the side of the slide on a paper towel.\n\t\tNOTE: The pre-hybridization solution with no transfer RNA is not pre-heated prior to being added onto each slide.\nPipette 500 µL of 50% pre-hybridization solution with no transfer RNA in 1x PBS to each slide and place the slides in the humidity chamber for 15 min at room temperature. Remove the solution by tapping the side of the slide on a paper towel.\nTransfer the slides to a Coplin jar and wash 3 times in 1x PBS with gentle shaking for 15 min per wash at room temperature.",
    "Remove the slides from the Coplin jar and remove excess PBS by tapping the side of the slide on a paper towel. Then proceed to step 3.2 \"Primary antibody staining\".\n3. Antibody staining\nNOTE: Antibodies raised to known meiotic proteins can be used for immunofluorescence detection in spread chromosome preparations. Secondary antibodies conjugated to different fluorophores allows for multiple proteins to be stained simultaneously, if the primary antibodies were raised in different animals.\nMake the following solutions on the day of the primary and secondary antibody staining\nMake 1 L of PBT with 1x PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in distilled water. Store at room temperature. This can be prepared ahead of time and in large quantities for future spreading experiments.\nPrepare 500 µL of antibody block per slide to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL of BSA and 2% goat serum in PBT.\nTo make 100 µL of primary or secondary antibody mix per slide, add the appropriate antibodies at the correct concentration (see Table of Materials) into the antibody block.\n\t\tNOTE: Antibody concentration may need to be determined empirically. In the discussion, we include a list of antibodies we have tried with success (with dilution/concentrations) and those we have tried without success.\nPrimary antibody staining\n\tNOTE: Rabbit anti-human SCP3 and chicken anti-zebrafish Sycp1 are typically used for primary antibody staining.\n\t\nAfter removing excess PBS from the slides, add 500 µL of antibody block per slide and place the slides in a humidity chamber at room temperature for a minimum of 20 min.\nRemove the antibody block by tapping the side of slide on a paper towel.",
    "Add 100 µL of primary antibody mix in antibody block per slide and cover the slides with a plastic coverslip made from an autoclave bag. Place the slides in a humidity chamber overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the coverslips with a pipette tip and wash the slides 2 times for a minimum of 5 minutes each with 1x PBS in a Coplin jar with gentle shaking at room temperature.\nRemove the PBS by tapping the side of the slide on a paper towel.\nSecondary antibody staining\n\tNOTE: Conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-chicken antibodies to different fluorophores are used for staining at a 1:1000 concentration.\n\t\nAdd 500 µL of antibody block per slide and place the slides in the humidity chamber at room temperature for a minimum of 5 min.\nRemove the antibody block by tapping the side of the slide on a paper towel.\nAdd 100 µL of secondary antibody mix in antibody block per slide and cover the slides with a plastic coverslip made from an autoclave bag. Place the slides in a humidity chamber for 1 h at 37 °C.\nRemove the coverslips with a pipette tip and wash the slides 3 times for a minimum of 5 min each with 1x PBS in a Coplin jar with gentle shaking at room temperature.\nRinse the slides one time for a minimum of 2 min with distilled water in a Coplin jar with gentle shaking at room temperature.\nAir dry the slides tilted, to facilitate drying.\nPlace 20 µL of anti-fade mountant with or without DAPI (see Table of Materials) as 3 evenly spaced dots on glass coverslips (24 mm x 60 mm).\nPlace the slides face down on the glass coverslips then seal the coverslips with nail polish on the edge overlapping the frosted end of the slide.",
