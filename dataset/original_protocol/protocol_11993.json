    "Mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room at 23 ±1 °C with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Animal care protocols and experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation at Aichi Medical University and were approved by the incumbent Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Culture Medium and Dishes\nTo prepare basic culture medium, add fetal bovine serum (FBS, 5% v/v), FSH (100 mIU/mL), LH (10 mU/mL), and penicillin-streptomycin (penicillin, 100 U/mL; streptomycin, 100 mg/mL) to minimum essential medium alpha (MEM-alpha) and mix in 50 mL tubes.\n\tNOTE: Total volumes of required culture media vary between experiments, but 1 mL of culture medium is generally sufficient for 3.5 cm glass-bottom culture dishes.\nPour 1 mL aliquots of mixed culture medium into 3.5 cm glass-bottom culture dishes and set place 30 mm cell culture inserts into dishes. Pre-warm media and dishes in an incubator (5% CO2 and 37 °C).\n2. Preparation of Ovarian Tissue\nPre-warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (−) and MEM-alpha containing 5% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in an incubator (5% CO2 and 37 °C).\n\t​NOTE: About 3 mL aliquots of PBS (−) per ovary are sufficient for use during ovary dissections, and 1 mL aliquots of MEM-alpha are sufficient for transient storage of single ovaries in 3.5 cm dishes.\nExcise ovaries from 4-week old female ICR (named after Institute of Cancer Research) mice and trim the tissues surrounding the ovary using scissors and tweezers under a stereoscopic microscope. Reserve the removed ovaries in culture medium (see step 2.1) until use.\nPlace single ovaries onto filter paper moistened with pre-warmed PBS (−) (see step 2.1) and slice into 4 pieces using a microtome blade under a stereoscopic microscope.",
    "NOTE: Ovaries of 4-week old ICR mice are about 2 mm in diameter. The number of pieces depends on the ovary size; however, about 500 µm thick pieces allow for proper follicle observations (in pieces thicker than 500 mm, tissue transparency is decreased; in pieces thinner than 500 mm, many antral follicles are broken and lost).\nAfter dissection, place the sliced ovary specimens into pre-warmed culture medium in 3.5 cm dishes (see step 2.1).\n3. Ovarian Tissue Culture\nDrop approximately 0.5 µL of culture medium per sliced ovarian tissue on the cell culture insert where the ovarian tissue will be set using a micropipette.\nPlace each sliced specimen into a drop of culture medium on the cell culture inserts using tweezers.\nCulture the ovary tissues in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nReplace the culture medium with fresh pre-warmed medium every 2 days.\n\t​NOTE: The schedule for medium changes for the culture of ovary sections from 4-week old ICR mice is presented in Figure 1.\n\t\nTo reproduce the LH surge, treat cultured 4-week old ICR mice ovaries with the medium containing 100 mU/mL FSH and LH for 12 h every 4 days (Figure 1).\n4. Microscope Images of Cultured Ovaries\nStart imaging the cultured ovaries after day 1 when the tissues have adhered onto the cell culture inserts, and perform confocal or inverted microscope analyses at 24 h intervals to allow sufficient follicle growth between time points.\n\tNOTE: Confocal microscopy is superior to inverted microscopy for observing follicles in whole cultured ovaries.\n5. Time-lapse Imaging of Cultured Ovaries\nOptimize the time-lapse imaging conditions, including laser intensities and exposure times, for the imaging system (Table 1).",
    "Select paired ovary specimens from single mice for use as treatment and control groups. Vary laser intensities and exposure time to achieve the best images (Table 1).\nCompare follicle growth under each culture condition by measuring follicle areas in images of control samples at 24 h intervals and in time-lapse imaging samples (see step 6). Concurrently, count the number of ovulated oocytes in each ovary set and choose the optimal time-lapse imaging conditions.\nCapture images at 30 min intervals using the time-lapse imaging system under the determined conditions (Table 1).\n6. Follicle Growth Analysis\nTo analyze the follicle development, measure the follicle areas in the captured images using ImageJ software (http://resbweb.nih.gov/ij/).\nInitially, set the scale of the image by clicking \"Set Scale\" under \"Analyze\" in the tool bar. Enter the side lengths of the captured image and the corresponding numbers of pixels in the blank fields of \"Known distance\" and \"Distance in pixels\", respectively.\nClick \"Free hand\" in the tool bar and outline the follicles in the captured bright field images.\nClick \"Measure\" under \"Analyze\" in the tool bar.\n\t\tNOTE: If other measurement data are desired, click \"Set measurement\" under \"Analyze\" in the tool bar, and check the appropriate boxes in the list.\n7. Analysis of Follicle Development Using Transgenic Mice\nCollect ovaries from postnatal days 0 and 4 (P0 and P4) female transgenic mice containing the transgenes Oog1pro3.9 and R26-H2B-mCherr, and culture on inserts as described in steps 1.1–3.2, except do not slice the P0 and P4 ovaries.\nReplace the culture medium with fresh, pre-warmed medium in 3.5 cm dishes in an incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C every 2 days.",
    "NOTE: The concentration of LH in the culture medium of P0 and P4 ovaries can remain constant because LH surges do not occur in P0 and P4 mice.\nSet the microscope to visualize only AcGFP1-positive primary follicles in cultured P4 ovaries (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: Only primordial and primary follicles are present in P4 female mouse ovaries.\nCapture images of cultured P0 Oog1pro3.9/R26-H2B-mCherry transgenic mice ovaries at 30 min intervals using the settings used for P4 ovaries (see step 5.2).\nTrace and analyze follicle development using AcGFP1 and H2B-mCHerry signals.\nSubscription Required.
