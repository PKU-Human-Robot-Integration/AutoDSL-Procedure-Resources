    "In order to induce sexual reproduction in A. fumigatus, the complementary mating partners must be exposed to the correct growth conditions. Arguably the most important of which is the incubation of A. fumigatus on oatmeal agar (OMA), which provides the nutrients required for production of cleistothecia. Although commercially available, best results are obtained by preparing new batches of OMA from fresh materials. A protocol is shown below for the preparation of a 2-litre batch of oatmeal agar.\nMaterials\nTap water\n80 g Irish pinhead oatmeal (Odlums)\n40 g agar\n5-liter flask\nHeat plate with magnetic stirrer\nAluminum foil\nTwo layers of cheese cloth\nFour 1-liter Schott bottles\nMagnetic fleas\nAutoclave for sterilization\n9-cm petri dishes\n1. Add 2 liters of tap water to a 5-liter flask.\n2. Add 80 g Irish pinhead oatmeal (Odlums) to the flask.\n3. Bring to the boil using a hotplate, stirring continuously with a magnetic flea to ensure the oatmeal does not burn.\n4. Cover the top of the flask with foil to prevent water loss.\n5. After the water has reached boiling temperature, lower the temperature of the hotplate so the mixture is bubbling gently and cook for 45 min—be careful that the oatmeal does not boil over.\n6. Once cooked, filter the oatmeal solution through two layers of cheese cloth to remove the majority of solids. This will leave a cream-colored viscous liquid. To ensure faster filtration, remove any solids that may build up in the cheese cloth.\n7. Restore volume to 2 liters with tap water and mix the solution. Typically, 10% of the volume is lost during cooking.\n8. To each 1-liter Schott bottle add 10 g agar.\n9. Add 500 ml of the oatmeal liquid into each bottle.",
    "10. Make sure the oatmeal and agar have mixed thoroughly. To do this, place a magnetic flea inside each Schott bottle and stir for 5 min. Once mixed, remove the flea.\n11. Autoclave the bottles, ensuring the lid is loosely sealed, for 30 min at 117°C, followed by ambient rather than forced cooling (this is essential to prevent boiling over of the viscous media from the bottles). Autoclaved media can be stored for up to 3 months.\n12. Prior to crossing work, pour 25-ml aliquots of oatmeal agar into 9-cm petri dishes for each cross to be performed (ensuring each cross is performed in triplicate).\nFrom a 2-liter batch of oatmeal agar, the user will be able to produce ∼80 oatmeal agar 9-cm petri dishes. If more or less is required, adjust the quantities as needed. Note that in the authors’ experience, most consistent and reliable results are obtained using Irish pinhead oatmeal (Odlums, Ireland) to make the OMA, but that other sources of oatmeal (e.g., Quaker Oats) can also be used successfully.",
    "In order to perform a sexual cross between two isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, two complementary mating partners of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genotype must be present due to the heterothallic nature of this species. It is therefore necessary to determine the mating type of an isolate of A. fumigatus prior to setting up crosses. For some isolates, genome information will be available, allowing screening for the presence of the MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 genes reported by Paoletti et al. 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-bib-0021] which determine mating-type identity [GenBank accession numbers AY898660 and AY898661 (MAT1-1), and XM_749896 (MAT1-2)]. Alternatively, a multiplex PCR assay can be performed to determine the mating type of the isolates, based on the protocol of Paoletti et al. 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-bib-0021] as follows. For each strain of A. fumigatus used, DNA extraction can be performed following the guidelines of the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega).\nMaterials\n50 ng template DNA\nPrimers AFM1, AFM2, and AFM3\ndNTPs\nRed Hot Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Thermo Scientific) or another suitable enzyme\nNuclease-free water\n1.5% (w/v) agarose gel\n1× Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer solution\nEthidium bromide\n100-bp DNA ladder\nWizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) or similar\nThermal cycler for PCR\n1. The reaction volume for the multiplex mating-type assay is 25 µl, containing: 50 ng template DNA of the A. fumigatus isolate being tested; 50 ng of primer AFM1; 50 ng of primer AFM2; 100 ng of primer AFM3; 200 µM of each dNTP; 1 U of Red Hot DNA Polymerase; 1× Red Hot DNA polymerase reaction buffer; and made up to 25 µl with nuclease-free water. The details of the primers used are shown in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-tbl-0001].\nTable 1.\n                Primers for Aspergillus fumigatus Mating-Type Assay (Paoletti et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-bib-0021])\ntable:\n﻿Primer,Sequence,Target Region\nAFM1,5′-CCTTGACGCGATGGGGTGG-3′,MAT1-1 idiomorph\nAFM2,5′-CGCTCCTCATCAGAACAACTCG-3′,MAT1-2 idiomorph\nAFM3,5′-CGGAAATCTGATGTCGCCACG-3′,‘Common’ flanking region\n2. The PCR cycle parameters are as follows:",

The products of this multiplex PCR assay can then be visualized using gel electrophoresis (1.5% w/v agarose gel in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer) stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 µl/ml). The amplicon size can then be estimated using a 100-bp DNA ladder.\nThe expected product size of MAT1-1 isolates is 834 bp, while MAT1-2 isolates have an amplicon size of 438 bp.",
    "Once mating type has been determined and two isolates of different mating type have been chosen for the sexual cross, the use of the following protocol for the inoculation of the two complimentary A. fumigatus isolates helps to ensure maximum number of cleistothecia are formed. Note that it is recommended to include a control cross between known fertile mating strains in addition to crosses with new test isolates.\nMaterials\nSpore suspensions (5 × 105 conidia ml−1) of each isolate of A. fumigatus\nSterile 0.05% Tween 80\n25 ml oatmeal agar 9-cm Petri dishes (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-prot-0001])\n10-µl inoculation loop\nHemacyometer or other suitable cell counter\n2-µl pipettes\nSterile pipette tips (use in steps 1 and 2 below)\nClass II sterile hood (use in steps 1 to 3 below)\nParafilm (or Nescofilm) to seal petri dishes\n30°C incubator in darkness\n1. Prepare 1 ml spore suspensions of each isolate (5 × 105 conidia ml−1) in 0.05% Tween 80 from 7- to 10-day-old grown cultures—using the 10-µl inoculation loop and sterile 0.05% Tween 80 solution with spore counting by a hemacytometer method or similar (Aneja, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-bib-0003]).\n2. Inoculate two 1-µl aliquots of each spore suspension (using a 2-µl pipette) onto the oatmeal agar surface ∼4-cm apart and perpendicular to aliquots of conidia of the opposite mating type. It is useful to keep a record of which mating partners are inoculated at the defined points, using for example red/blue marks or numbers (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2f1e110c-1a86-4cc7-a9f6-2014ab4e4de7/cpmc87-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nOatmeal agar plates, marked with the points of inoculation. Blue for MAT1-1 and red for MAT1-2.",
    "3. Seal inoculated petri dishes with one layer of Parafilm (or Nescofilm) and incubate inverted for 3 month at 30°C in complete darkness. Best results are obtained when plates are incubated in single depth rather than being stacked on top of each other.\n4. Periodically examine the cultures over the course of 3 months to ensure the oatmeal agar does not dry out (resealing breaks in the Parafilm, as necessary).",
    "After the 3-month incubation period, examine each sexual cross for production of cleistothecia, visible as white-cream colored hyphal spherical structures (150- to 6000µm diameter, darkening on maturity). Typically, these will appear at the barrage zones between two complementary mating partners, and may be scattered individually or group in small clusters (Figs. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-fig-0002]A-C). These sexual structures contain the progeny from the A. fumigatus sexual cycle. Note that cleistothecia may be submerged under asexual conidiophores and hard to detect by eye. Inspection under a dissecting microscope is therefore often necessary to identify the cleistothecia, and the careful use of dissecting needles to tease apart tissues in the barrage zone can reveal the presence of cleistothecia that are not immediately apparent.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84f89fac-2f99-4a88-aa3e-217675a6b414/cpmc87-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nAspergillus fumigatus sexual development. (A) Crossing plate following three months incubation at 30°C in darkness. Cleistothecia formation (white arrowed) can be observed at the barrage zones where the isolates of complementary mating type meet. (B) Group of cream-colored cleistothecia of A. fumigatus (arrowed) covered by white mycelia, following removal of most superficial conidia by hoovering. (C) Individual cleistothecium of A. fumigatus (arrowed) following dissection from underlying tissues, ready for transfer for ascospore isolation.\nFurthermore, if it is necessary to accurately count the number of cleistothecia then the use of a “hoovering” technique is recommended (Sugui et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-bib-0025]). This involves use of a blue sterile pipette tip (1000-µl) linked to a vacuum line, with a trap vessel in between containing isopropanol together with 10 µm filter(s) to catch fungal material (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-fig-0003]). The pipette tip is carefully held above the barrage zone of the crossing plate, and the surface “hoovered” under gentle vacuum to remove conidia and hyphae obscuring the cleistothecia, taking care not to hoover up the cleistothecia themselves.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c0b6434e-b224-45d2-8d35-956169867229/cpmc87-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Note particularly: (A) A 1000-µl pipette tip, allowing precise targeting of conidia; (B) Conical flask containing 2% trigene disinfectant, killing conidia that have been hoovered; (C) Conical flask containing isopropanol, killing any remaining conidia from (B); (D) Final tube connected to a 10-µm filter (not shown), in order to trap any leftover conidia, leading to the vacuum tap. The airflow is in the direction of A-D in all circumstances.\nMaterials\n0.05% Tween 80\nIsopropanol for sterilization\nCrossing plate containing cleistothecia (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-prot-0003])\nSterile water\n4% water agar plates\n2% w/v malt extract agar (MEA; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-rec-0002])\nClass II sterile hood\nSterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nFine-point needle\nBunsen burner\nDissecting microscope\nVortex mixer\nHeat block\n28°C incubator in darkness\n1. Transfer 100 µl sterile 0.05% Tween 80 into sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n2. Using a sterile fine-point needle, sterilized using the isopropanol and Bunsen burner, isolate a cleistothecia from the crossing plate (from Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-prot-0003]). This is done most easily by observing cultures under a dissecting microscope when picking up cleistothecia.\n3. Wash the cleistothecia of adhering conidia by rolling the cleistothecia through 20 µl sterile water on a 4% water agar plate.\n4. Using a needle, transfer the washed cleistothecia into the 2-ml microcentrifuge tube (from step 1), and crush the cleistothecia in the 100 µl of 0.05% Tween 80. Ideally 5 to 10 cleistothecia will be used at this stage, although a minimum of one cleistothecia is possible.\n5. Adjust the volume of the 2-ml microcentrifuge tube, adding 1.9 ml of 0.05% Tween 80.\n6. Vortex the solution for 1 min in order to ensure all the ascospores have been released and asci sufficiently disrupted.",
    "7. Heat for 1 hr at 70°C to kill remaining conidia and mycelial tissues.\n8. During this time, pour 25 ml of 2% malt extract agar (MEA) plates ensuring enough are poured to allow for triplicates of each ascospore solution.\n9. Spread plate aliquots of 100 µl of heat-treated ascospores onto 2% (w/v) malt extract agar (MEA) plates and incubate for 36 hr at 28°C (use triplicate technical repeats of the ascospore suspension because the spread plated ascospores may be too dense or dilute on particular replicates).\nCAUTION: When isolating cleistothecia from A. fumigatus sexual crosses, wear a safety mask to minimize the risk of inhalation of conidia and avoid air currents that might cause conidia to become airborne.",
    "After 36 hr incubation, the ascospores will have begun germinating. This protocol will describe isolation procedures to enable single ascospore progeny to be isolated for further studies.\nMaterials\nPlate with germinating ascopores (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-prot-0004])\nIsopropanol for sterilization\n25 ml 2% MEA plates\nClass I sterile hood\nDissecting microscope\nFine-point needle\nBunsen burner\n1.

Once single germinating ascospores have been identified, use a sterile fine-point needle, sterilized using the isopropanol and Bunsen burner, to carefully cut out the single germinating ascospore. Alternatively, a LaRue lens cutter or similar single-spore device may be used.\n3. Place germinating ascospore on the center of a 25 ml 2% (w/v) MEA or ACM plate.\n4. Incubate at 28°C in darkness or diffuse light until fully grown.",
    "Once individual ascospore progeny from the A. fumigatus have been isolated, it is often valuable to validate that sexual recombination has occurred. Various methods are available, but a relatively straightforward method is to perform DNA fingerprinting of the offspring using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR), as described by Murtagh, Dyer, McClure, and Crittenden (1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-bib-0018]). For each ascospore progeny of A. fumigatus used, DNA extraction can be performed following the guidelines of the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega).\nMaterials\n0.1 to 1 ng genomic DNA from each isolate ascospore\n10 base-pair RAPD primer\ndNTPs\nDyNAzyme II DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Scientific) containing:\n               \nDyNAzyme II DNA polymerase\n1× DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase buffer\nNuclease-free water\n1.5% (w/v) agarose gel\n10× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer solution\nEthidium bromide\n1-kb DNA ladder, optional\nWizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) or similar\nThermal cycler for PCR\n1. The reaction volume for the RAPD-PCR assay is 25 µl, containing: 0.1 to 1 ng template DNA from ascospore progeny (note the relatively low amount of DNA template); 50 µmol of a single 10-base-pair primer; 500 µM of each dNTP; 1 U of DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase; 1× DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase buffer; and adjusted to 25 µl with nuclease-free water. Details of recommended primers for validation of A. fumigatus sexual recombination are shown Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.87#cpmc87-tbl-0002].\nTable 2.\n                Primers for RAPD-PCR Diagnostic\ntable:\n﻿Primer,Sequence\nA-05,5′-AGGGGTCTTG-3′\nJ-01,5′-CCCGGCATAA-3′\nW-10,5′-TCGCATCCCT-3′\nW-19,5′-CAAAGCGCTC-3′\nX-05,5′-CCTTTCCCTC-3′\n2.

    "3. The products of the RAPD-PCR assay can be visualized using gel electrophoresis (1.5% w/v agarose gel in 10×Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer). Due to the high number of products that may be generated from the RAPD-PCR, electrophoresis gels should be run for an extended period to ensure full resolution of products (approx. 2.5 to 4 hr). For this reason, the gel must be stained with ethidium bromide post-electrophoresis. Depending on the primer used for the RAPD-PCR assay, the expected products will vary and product sizes should be estimated using a 1 kb DNA ladder. The parental RAPD profiles are then compared to the progeny RAPD profiles."
