    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis section lists the major steps, provides step-by-step details and timing for each major step. Please note that there are stopping points designated in the 10x Chromium protocol but for the purpose of reproducibility, suggested stopping points are noted based on previous successful runs.\nNote: For details on the execution of the single-cell suspensions from muscle, please refer to Liu et al. 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. For complete details regarding the generation of single-cell droplets, cDNA synthesis, amplification and library preparation for scRNA-seq, please refer to the 10x Chromium protocol which can be found at: https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/4tjk4KvXzTWgTs8f3tvUjq/2259891d68c53693e753e1b45e42de2d/CG000183_ChromiumSingleCell3__v3_UG_Rev_C.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/4tjk4KvXzTWgTs8f3tvUjq/2259891d68c53693e753e1b45e42de2d/CG000183_ChromiumSingleCell3__v3_UG_Rev_C.pdf]\nFor details regarding the Seurat package used from exploration of single-cell data, please refer to satijalab.org/seurat/ and the “Quantification and Statistical Analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]” section.\nMuscle Dissection and Digestion—Day 1\nTiming: 4 h\nInjured and non-injured tibialis anterior (TA) muscles are dissected and digested to generate single-cell suspensions.\nNote: This protocol is adapted from Liu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nNote: If there are >9 mice (>3 samples), it is recommended to have multiple people working together as sample processing can be time-consuming and this may affect the digestion times of other samples.\nBefore starting, prepare muscle dissociation buffer and have dishes with 1× PBS on ice ready for each sample. Reagents should be ice cold and samples kept on ice unless otherwise specified It is also important to maintain sterile techniques throughout the entirety of this procedure.\nDissect TA muscles from injured and/or non-injured mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nSpray mice with 70% EtOH.\nGently remove skin to reveal TA muscle.\nRemove membrane (epimysium) that covers the TA muscle by gently poking along the fibula (without disrupting the muscle) with tweezers until membrane can be removed.\nCut the distal tendon of the TA using a pair of micro surgical spring scissors.",
    "Using tweezers, hold the severed tendon and gently pull the TA muscle up toward the knee.\nCut the proximal tendon as close to the knee as possible and place the muscle in 1× PBS on ice.\nCritical: keeping the tendon intact will prevent muscle hypercontraction and make it easier to cut the muscles for digestion.\nUsing a vacuum, aspirate 1× PBS and rinse dissected muscles three more times with 5 mL 1× PBS to remove any additional fur.\nTo cut the muscle, hold the tendon with a pair of tweezers and cut the TA parallel to the muscle fibers (such that the TA is cut into small fascicles and held at the tendon).\nCritical: do not mince into small pieces as this may lead to over-digestion.\nThe tendon can be cut away after the TA has been cut.\nPlace the TA muscles in a 15 mL conical tube with 5 mL muscle dissociation buffer.\nCritical: keep on ice while other samples are prepared such that all samples are digested at the same time.\nWrap the cap with paraffin to prevent leaking and incubate all samples at 37°C for 1 h with gentle shaking (100 rpm).\nFill tube with ice cold wash medium to stop digestion.\nCentrifuge samples at 525 × g at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 5 min to pellet sample and remove debris.\nRemove supernatant to leave 4 mL.\nAdd 0.5 mL stock collagenase type II (stock at 1,000 U/mL; final at 100 U/mL) and 0.5 mL stock dispase (stock at 11 U/mL; final at 1.1 U/mL) to each tube and gently resuspend pellet.\nWrap cap with paraffin and incubate samples at 37°C for 30 min with gentle shaking (100 rpm).",
    "Gently run sample through 18-gauge needle on a 10 mL syringe 10–12 times to break up any remaining muscle pieces.\nCritical: Avoid making bubbles when running samples through the needle and syringe, remove any pieces that are too large to fit through the needle and perform these steps slowly as force can damage the cells.\nFill tube with ice cold wash medium to stop reaction.\nCentrifuge samples at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 5 min at 525 × g.\nRemove supernatant leaving ~4 mL medium and gently resuspend pellet.\nRun sample through pre-wet 40 μm filter and rinse filter with additional 10 mL ice cold wash medium.\nCentrifuge samples at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 5 min at 525 × g.\nRed blood cell lysis:\nCompletely remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 2 mL red blood cell lysis solution at room temperature (15°C–25°C).\nIncubate at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for a maximum of 3 min.\nFill tube with 1× PBS to stop red blood cell lysis.\nCentrifuge samples at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 5 min at 525 × g and proceed with staining.\nNote: Pelleted cells should now appear white, with little to no red (i.e., blood cells) present.\nStaining for Cell Viability—Day 1\nTiming: 30 min\nLive/dead viability stain to ensure live cells are sorted for downstream processing.\nCritical: Live/dead viability dye is light sensitive and therefore samples should be protected from light and kept on ice unless otherwise specified to maintain reagent stability and cell viability.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend sample in 3 mL 1× PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL cell suspension to fresh tube (for no-stain control) and 0.5 mL 0.1% BSA (to final concentration of 0.05% BSA) and leave on ice.",
    "To remaining sample, add 2.5 μL Zombie Violet viability dye (dilution of 1:1,000) and wrap with aluminum foil to protect from light.\nIncubate sample at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 20 min on orbital shaker at 50 rpm.\nAfter 20 min, fill tube with 1× PBS and centrifuge sample at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 5 min at 525 × g.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend sample in 2 mL 0.05% BSA solution and proceed with FACS.\nFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting—Day 1\nTiming: 20 min/sample (total time depends on sample number)\nFluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to exclude debris, clumped cells, and generate single-cell suspensions for scRNA-seq.\nNote: This is generally performed by a core facility or with prior expertise. The general gating strategy is described below.\nUse the forward and side scatter to select based on size of cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/99-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative Fluorescence Activated Cell-Sorting Data\n(A) No stain control sample. FSC-A and SSC-A are used to initially gate cells (Gate 1, red outline). Cells are further refined based on SSC-H vs. SSC-W (Gate 2, red outline) and subsequently FSC-H vs. FSC-W (Gate 3, red outline). Baseline fluorescence of cells (no stain) in live/dead Violet-A channel vs SSC-A is used to select cells for stained sample (No stain, black outline).\n(B) Live/dead stained sample. Same gating strategy as outlined for (A). Note: no stain and Gate 4 (live cells) are the same but appearance is affected by the automatic scaling of the X-axis. This representative sample is from mice at 5 days post injury.\nSSC, side scatter; FSC, forward scatter (-A, area; -H, height; -W, width).\nDetermine gate for live/dead viability stain based on no-stain control (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).",
    "Live/dead viability dye will be excluded from the cytoplasm of live cells but will bind the membrane of both live and dead cells. Therefore, dead cells and debris will appear much brighter than live cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCollect 100,000 live cells into a 2 mL sterile, low binding microcentrifuge tube containing 450 μL 0.05% BSA solution. Keep it on ice.\nCritical: Microcentrifuge tube must be placed in a cooled (4°C) collection tube holder during sorting. Sorted samples must be kept on ice to maintain cell viability while other samples are processed. Once all samples are sorted, proceed with loading the samples onto the 10x Chip (steps 26–30) immediately.\nGeneration of Single-Cell Suspensions and cDNA Synthesis—Day 1\nTiming: 4 h\nNote: This portion outlines general steps that are detailed in the 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′ v3 kit. This is not meant to replace the protocol but rather highlight ideal stopping points, outline tips, and provide quality control examples from successful runs.\nCritical: It is important to maintain nuclease-free, sterile conditions throughout this process.\nGeneration of single-cell droplets, in-drop reverse transcription, and initial cDNA amplification.\nCentrifuge sorted cells for 5 min at 525 × g at room temperature (22°C–25°C) and resuspend in 200 μL 0.05% BSA solution.\nUse a hemocytometer or automated cell counter to confirm the density of cell suspension and viability.\nCritical: It is imperative to evaluate the morphology of cells immediately prior to loading onto the 10x Chip. Cells can be assessed under a microscope to ensure they are rounded, and no cells appear stuck together.\nCritical: Researchers should also confirm that cell viability is >80% as assessed by trypan blue staining.",
    "The 10x protocol outlines the targeted cell recovery and the respective cell stock density; for example, for a desired 10,000-target cell recovery, the cell density ranges from 900–1,200 cells/μL (see protocol for specific details).\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions for the generation of Gel Bead-In Emulsions (GEMs) using the 10x Chromium system.\nThe specialized 10x vortex Adapter (Product # 330002) attachment to vortex the Single Cell 3′ Gel Beads is not necessary; using a 3-inch platform and holding the GEMs while vortexing is sufficient.\nProceed with the in-GEM reverse transcription (RT) per the manufacturer’s instructions.\nIt is recommended to use a nearby PCR machine, as excessive movement with the GEMs may comprise their integrity and affect overall data quality.\nAfter RT, follow the 10x protocol instructions for cDNA clean-up and initial amplification.\nThe 10x protocol contains pictures of what the samples should look like after the addition of the recovery reagent. There is sometimes a cloudy appearance to the aqueous phase. If brief centrifugation does not clear it completely, it is OK to proceed.\nWhen removing the recovery reagent, only remove the 125 μL recommended by 10x Chromium even if this leaves pink recovery reagent.\nProceed with the final clean-up after the initial cDNA amplification and send samples for quality control (QC) analysis via TapeStation or Bioanalyzer.\nThis is an ideal stopping point. Representative traces from successful runs are shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/99-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Note: peaks at 35 and 10,380 bp are spike-in controls.\nQC, quality control; DPI, days post injury; FU, fluorescence units; bp, base pairs.\nPause Point: The 10x Chromium protocol also suggests that GEMs can be stored at 4°C for 12 h or for 72 h at −20°C after the RT if necessary.\nLibrary Preparation and Sequencing—Variable Timing\nTiming: Variable\nNote: Again, this portion outlines general steps that are detailed in the 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′ v3 kit. This is not meant to replace the protocol.\nNote: The timing of this is variable. Library preparation is relatively quick (< 2 h), but the turn-around time for sequencing will depend on the respective core or company the samples are sent to.\nLibrary Preparation and Next-Generation Sequencing\nRefer to 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagents Kits User Guide for details on amplification, library construction and QC. Representative traces from successful runs are shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D.\nSamples are ready for high-throughput sequencing and the 10x Chromium protocol outlines specific requirements depending on sequencing platform used. Generally, 50,000 reads/cell yields best results."
