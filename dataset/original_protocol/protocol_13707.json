    "The investigations described conformed to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council and were approved by the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. When performing the experiments, lab coats, disposable nitrile gloves, and goggles are required for safety purposes.\n1. Preparation of solvents and estimation of naringenin required for in vivo application\nPrepare the following solvents: Tween-80 (final concentration range: 0.5%-1%), DMSO, glycerin (final concentration range: 15%-20%), ethanol (final concentration range: 12% for intramuscular injection)22, and 0.9% PS.\nEstimate the amount of naringenin required based on the dose, number of mice, and injection frequency.\n\t\nOrder 10 mice (C57BL/6, male, 5 weeks old, SPF) to administer naringenin 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Keep mice in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: The dose required for intraperitoneal injection is 20 mg/kg b.w.23.\nWeigh 160 mg of naringenin based on the following calculation: 20 mg/kg x 0.02 kg/mouse x 10 mice x 5 days/week x 8 weeks = 160 mg.\nCalculate the concentration of naringenin to be injected in vivo.\n\t\nPrepare the recommended volume based on the bodyweight of the mice. The recommended volume of naringenin applied to each mouse is 1% of body weight (0.3 mL). In this experiment, 0.2 mL per mouse was used.\nCalculate the total volume: 0.2 mL per mouse x 10 mice x 5 days/week x 8 weeks = 80 mL.\nCalculate the concentration of the Naringenin in stock: 160 mg/80 mL solvents = 2 mg/mL.\nCalculate the volume for each day: 0.2 mL per mouse x 10 mice = 2 mL.\n2. Dissolution\nEthanol solution\n\t\nTo prepare naringenin solution at 2 mg/mL, weigh 3.52 mg of naringenin and add it into a 2.0 mL tube.",
    "NOTE: To achieve a concentration of 2 mg/mL, the total volume required will be 1760 µL (calculation: 3.52 mg/1760 µL = 2 mg/mL).\nQuickly spin down (2000 x g for 30 s) to make the naringenin powder settle at the bottom of the tube (Figure 1A).\nAdd 8.8 µL of 100% ethanol to the tube to prepare a 0.5% (v/v) solution with respect to the total volume required2. Naringenin does not dissolve completely (Figure 1B).\nContinue to add 79.2 µL of 100% ethanol to the tube to prepare a 5% (v/v) solution with respect to the total volume required (calculation: (79.2 µL + 8.8 µL) / 1760 µL x 100% = 5%). Naringenin does not dissolve completely (Figure 1B).\nAdd 1672 µL of 0.9% PS to the tube containing 5% ethanol as described in step 2.1.4. This will produce an emulsion (Figure 1D). Centrifuge (2000 x g for 30 s) the solution to check whether naringenin is completely dissolved in the solution.

Naringenin solution administration\nHandling and restraint\n\t\nSpray the cage and hands with 70-75% alcohol before opening the lid. Lift the mouse by the base of the tail and place it on a solid surface to position its tail gently back.\nGrasp the scruff of the neck behind the ears with the left thumb and index finger and position the tail between the little and the ring finger. Keep the mouse in a supine position with its posterior end slightly elevated.\nInjection\n\t\nGrasp the back skin of the mouse so that the abdominal skin is taut.\nPush the needle (insulin syringe) in at an angle of 10° between the needle and the abdominal surface, in the lower right or left quadrant of the abdomen to avoid hitting the bladder, liver, or other internal organs.",
    "Run the needle subcutaneously in a cranial direction for 3-5 mm, and then insert it at a 45° angle into the abdominal cavity.\nWhen the needle passes through the abdominal wall and the resistance disappears, perform an aspiration to confirm that no reflux material is withdrawn. Then, slowly push the solution.\nAfter the injection, slowly pull the needle out and rotate it slightly to prevent leakage. The recommended volume is 50-100 µL/10 g.\nDispose of leftover Naringenin in a biohazard container.\n4. Blood glucose test\nNOTE: Test the blood glucose 1 day prior to the injection and 1 and 2 months after the injection.\nFast the mice for 15 h before the blood glucose test. Water can continue to be provided.\nOpen the test strips and mark the date. Once opened, use the test strips within 3 months. Store the test strips at 2-30 °C. Tightly close the lid after removing the strip to prevent the formation of moisture.\nPlace the animal into the induction chamber. Turn on the vaporizer at an induction level of 4% for isoflurane and 4 L/min for oxygen. After the animal is fully anesthetized, maintain the anesthetic with the nose cone and the anesthetic delivery at a level of 1.5% for isoflurane and 0.4 L/min for oxygen.\nWipe the tail with cotton balls/swabs soaked in 70%-75% alcohol.\nStarting from the lowest point of the tail, make a small puncture on the lateral tail vein with a 25G needle prick and squeeze out a drop of blood.\nWipe the drop of blood with a tissue paper.\nSqueeze out another drop of blood and collect it on the edge of a test strip.\nRead and record the result displayed on the glucose meter.",
    "To stop the bleeding, pinch the tail of the mouse with a sterile gauze and wipe the area with 75% alcohol.\nAdditional samples may be obtained by a similar technique moving up the tail cranially.\n5. TRAP staining\nSlides preparation\n\t\nPerform fasting blood glucose tests on the mice once a week. When the blood glucose levels are ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (indicative of successful type II diabetes mice model24), euthanize the mice using CO2, followed by cervical disclocation, and collect the Lumbar 4th-6th (L4-L6) (no euthanasia is performed while fasting blood glucose test).\nFix the L4-L6 samples with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h (ensure that the volume of paraformaldehyde is >20x the volume of the tissue), and then wash for 2 h in continuous flow of tap water.\nTo decalcify the samples, immerse them in a 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution for 2 weeks at RT in static condition until the samples are softened. Ensure that the volume of the decalcifying solution is 20-30 times the volume of the tissue/sample. Change the EDTA solution every other day.\nDehydrate the sample using a dehydrator.\n\t\t\nPlace the specimens in tissue processing embedding cassettes.
