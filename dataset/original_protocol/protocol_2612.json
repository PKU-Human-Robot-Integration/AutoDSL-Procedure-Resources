    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSensory Stimulation Procedure\nTiming: 3 h\nThe procedure below describes how to expose mouse subjects to the appropriate olfactory stimuli. We usually use 8 to 12 weeks-old C57BL/6J mice, but other ages and strains may be used depending on the experimenter’s interests.\nNote: The two stimulation windows (both of which are 20 min long) are separated by a 60 min period. The long separation between both stimulation events was found to be of sufficient duration to allow the discrimination of cells which express c-Fos mRNA (activated during the second exposure window) and cells which express c-Fos protein (activated during the first exposure window), such that no mRNA deriving from the first exposure is still present when the animal is euthanized (80 min after the end of the first stimulation period) and little to no c-Fos protein has yet been synthesized as a result of the second exposure event (which is 20 min long and not of enough duration for c-Fos protein to be produced at high levels) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPreparation of exposure cages\nFor each mouse to be exposed, prepare three exposure cages (numbered #1, #2, and #3), as follows:\nCage #1 is prepared by transferring a third of the soiled bedding from the subject’s home cage to a new clean deodorized cage (see Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section for steps on how to prepare deodorized cages). Do not overlay cage #1 with food compartment/grid or water bottle. Keep cage closed with a lid until ready to be used in step 2.\nCage #2 is prepared exactly like cage #1.",
    "Cage #3 is the animal’s home cage, with the remaining one-third of soiled bedding. This cage will contain the animal to be exposed at the beginning of the procedure. When ready to start the exposure sessions, remove the food compartment/grid and water bottle.\nTransfer cages #1 to #3 to a dark procedure room (preferably under red light illumination for ease of handling), without disturbing the animal with loud noises or sudden movements. The entire exposure session should be performed in the dark.\nExposure to first stimulus\nTransfer the animal to cage #1 and habituate it to the procedure room for 1 h.\nSlowly open the cage lid and insert the first olfactory stimulus source into the cage, on the side opposite to where the animal is located when the lid is opened.\nThe type of olfactory stimulus obviously depends on the experimenter’s interests. Suitable olfactory stimuli include medical gauze or cotton ball scented with liquid stimuli (urine, saliva, purified odorants, or pheromones, as well as recombinant proteins diluted in buffer), gauze scented with bodily secretions (fur, skin, feces scents), bodily shedding (feathers, fur, shed skin pieces, etc.), scented bedding (from conspecifics or from another species’ cage), or another animal (female or competitor male mouse, or an anesthetized predator).\nIf using stimulus sources composed of several individual pieces (of scented gauze or bodily shedding, for example), attach them to a binder clip to prevent them from dispersing about the cage.\nIf behaviors are to be scored later, the experimenter may decide to film the exposure session. More information can be found in our recent publication on behavioral assays in the study of olfaction (Papes et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nClose back the lid and let the exposure proceed for 20 min, without disturbing the subject during this time window.",
    "Note: If the olfactory stimulus is deposited on a solid substrate (cotton ball or medical gauze), control animals should be exposed to clean cotton ball or medical gauze. When the stimulus is liquid, control animals may be exposed to the solid substrate containing an equivalent volume of a behaviorally neutral odor diluent (e.g., PBS or mineral oil).\nRest period\nTransfer the animal back to cage #3 (home cage) at the end of the first exposure session.\nLet the animal stay undisturbed and unstimulated for 60 min.\nCritical: It is important not to insert scented material back into cage #3, because this is intended to be a rest period where the animal is kept without further olfactory stimulation (and preferably without visual and gustatory stimulation either). For example, avoid bringing scented bedding or pieces of bodily shedding together with the animal when it is transferred back to cage #3 in this step.\nExposure to second stimulus\nTransfer the animal to cage #2.\nImmediately insert the second olfactory stimulus source into the cage, on the side opposite to where the animal is located.\nClose with a lid and let the exposure proceed for 20 min, without disturbing the animal during this time window.\nCritical: Proceed to the following section immediately. After the second exposure window is finished, the animal must be perfused with fixative solution to stop the expression of c-Fos mRNA and protein. This is especially critical to prevent further c-Fos protein translation or c-Fos mRNA degradation in cells activated during the second exposure session.\nBrain Dissection and Sectioning\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "After the animal is exposed, it must be immediately anesthetized and subjected to cardiac perfusion with fixative solution, followed by dissection of the desired brain structures and sectioning under a vibratome. At the end, the experimenter will have produced thick sections suitable for the in situ hybridization and immunostaining steps to follow (staining as free-floating sections).\nRemove the animal from cage #2 after the second stimulation session is ended and inject it intraperitoneally with an anesthetic combination composed of ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (2–4 mg/kg body weight), dissolved in 50–100 μL of PBS, with the help of a 1 mL syringe.\nAfter the animal is checked to be deeply anesthetized, dissect to open the rib cage and expose the cardiac chamber using appropriate dissection tools. Inject the ventricle with 20 mL of cold PBS and then with 40 mL of cold 4% paraformaldehyde fixative (prepared in PBS).\nCritical: This step must be conducted by an experienced experimenter with sufficient prior training in performing cardiac perfusion, to minimize the time between the end of exposures and the onset of fixation.\nOptional: Alternatively, the animal could be decapitated with the aid of a mouse guillotine (provided it is permitted in the experimenter’s IACUC-approved animal protocol), followed by brain dissection and fixation by immersion.\nDissect the brain out using appropriate dissection tools and technique, exposing either the entire brain or the experimenter’s region of interest.\nImmerse the dissected brain or brain region in enough volume of 4% paraformaldehyde fixative in a plastic 6- or 12-well tissue culture plate. Make sure the specimen is fully submerged in fixative solution. Cover the plate with a lid and place it at 4°C for fixation (12 to 16 h).",
    "Critical: All solutions used from this step until step 33 must be RNase-free. See notes at the beginning of the Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nOn the following day, remove the fixative solution with the help of a p1000 pipetman or 5 mL serological pipette.\nNote: Avoid the use of a vacuum line for steps requiring changes of solution, as they may cause loss of specimens or sections.\nAdd enough volume of 20% sucrose (in PBS) and incubate at 4°C for 2–3 days. It is normal for the specimen to float once it is initially incubated in this solution. Equilibration in sucrose solution hardens the neural tissue and improves sectioning at later stages.\nCheck that equilibration in sucrose solution has been successful by verifying that the specimen has sunk to the bottom of the well.\nRemove sucrose solution and add enough volume of cold PBS.\nCritical: The specimen must be immediately embedded in agarose for vibratome sectioning. If short-term storage is absolutely needed, it should not be extended beyond a couple of days. Also, preservatives based on sodium azide must never be used at this step, as it chemically interferes with tyramide labeling in later stages of this protocol. Thimerosal preservatives are compatible.\nBefore embedding the specimen in agarose, trim it with a razor blade or scalpel and isolate the region of interest. Small specimens embed more efficiently and improve vibratome sectioning. We usually position the brain ventral side up and slice it coronally at two positions while keeping the brain stable with forceps. One cut is made at the level of the optic chiasma and another at a position immediately rostral to the cerebellum.\nOptional: Alternatively, the brain may be cut using stainless steel or acrylic brain matrices (slicers).\nEmbed the specimen containing the region of interest in agarose:",
    "Prepare the agarose embedding solution by mixing 100 mL of 1× PBS, 3.5 g of agarose, and 8.0 g of sucrose pellets. Dissolve sucrose on a heated plate or in a microwave oven until the solution is homogenous and clear. Do not let the solution boil.\nLet the clear solution cool down at 23°C–26°C until it is close to gelation.\nPour the embedding solution onto a plastic histology mold, enough to produce a 0.5–1.0 cm high block.\nQuickly blot the desired specimen dry with Kimwipes and place it in the embedding mold while the agarose solution is still liquid, with the help of forceps. Push the specimen all the way down so it touches the bottom of the plastic mold.\nThe specimen orientation inside the embedding mold depends on the experimenter’s interests but, usually, the side facing down will be the first to be sectioned at the vibratome.\nCritical: Drying the specimen is important because wet pieces will not adhere well to the agarose gel matrix, making vibratome sectioning difficult and producing sections of variable thickness.\nSection the block on a vibratome:\nOnce the block has solidified, remove it from the plastic mold and trim it with a razor blade such that the agarose margins are approximately 3–5 mm from the specimen edges.\nGlue the trimmed block to the vibratome stage with fast drying Super Glue.\nSection through the block on a Leica VT 1000S vibratome (or similar instrument), under PBS, to produce 40 μm sections (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).",
    "Note: This protocol has been optimized for 40 μm sections, which must be stained as free-floating sections in subsequent steps. Despite the difficulties inherent to dealing with staining of free-floating sections on a multi-well plate, this procedure has many advantages. First, it increases the number of cells for which the entire nucleus is stained, which is important because the two c-Fos mRNA nuclear foci are not always within the same cutting plane, and therefore the identification of c-Fos-positive cells after in situ hybridization requires that the entire nucleus be stained and imaged. Second, for brain areas that occupy a thick volume, staining of 40 μm sections is ideal since it allows the experimenter to visualize stained cells in the context of neighboring cells and structures inside the imaged area. Third, free-floating sections allow cRNA probes to penetrate the section from both surfaces, increasing staining efficiency, especially for deeply located cells. Lastly, free-floating section staining can be better achieved by using 40 μm section as opposed to thinner sections, which curl up more frequently and are harder to handle. Despite these advantages, it is possible to use this protocol to stain 12–20 μm cryostat sections collected onto glass slides, provided the necessary adaptations are included in the protocol. An extra advantage of using cryostat sections is that they could be stored at −80°C for up to 1 year without significant loss of RNA content. However, be aware that, due to low cRNA probe penetrability, use of cryostat sections may result in inefficient in situ staining on the side of the section facing the microscope slide. Moreover, thinner sections contain fewer layers of cells stained at their entirety. Finally, cryostat sections collected onto glass slides may trap air bubbles underneath the section, increasing in situ hybridization staining background.",
    "Gently pick each section from the vibratome reservoir with a fine paintbrush and transfer to the wells of a multi-well plate containing PBS. To keep track of section order along the direction of cutting (rostral-caudal, lateral-medial, or dorsal-ventral), it is advisable to collect each section into an individual well of a multi-well plate. Alternatively, collect sets of sections into each well. Sections may be stored for up to 2 days in PBS at 4°C.\nPause Point: If short-term storage is needed, it should not be extended beyond a couple of days. Also, preservatives based on sodium azide must never be used in this step, as it chemically interferes with tyramide labeling at later stages. Thimerosal preservatives are compatible.\ncRNA Probe Hybridization and Signal Development\nTiming: 4 days\nThe first steps in our staining protocol include in situ hybridization to detect c-Fos mRNA, which is expressed in neurons activated during the second window of sensory stimulation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This phase includes pre-treatment of histological sections, probe hybridization, washes, probe immunodetection, and signal development.\nPre-treatment of sections. Fill the required number of wells in an RNase-free 12-well plate with RNase-free PBS. Under a stereomicroscope, choose suitable sections and transfer them to the plate with a paintbrush. Place a maximum of three sections per well.\nRemove PBS and wash sections twice with 1× PBS, for 5 min each, under gentle agitation on a plate rocker.\nNote: For all washes and incubations of thick vibratome sections on a 12-well plate, use 500 μL of liquid, unless specified otherwise in the protocol. If using well plates with other number of wells, adjust the volume accordingly. Using more than 500 μL of liquid for the 12-well plate may lead to leaking or poor agitation of sections. For all changes of solution, use a p1000 pipetman.",
    "Remove PBS and add 4% paraformaldehyde (prepared in 1× PBS) and treat sections under agitation for 20 min.\nWash sections twice in 1× PBS under agitation, for 5 min each.\nPermeabilize the sections with 0.2 M HCl (prepared in RNase-free ultrapure H2O) under agitation, at 23°C–26°C for 10 min.\nWash sections twice in 1× PBS under agitation, for 5 min each.\nInactivate endogenous peroxidases by incubating sections in 0.1% H2O2 (prepared in RNase-free 1× PBS) for 30 min at 23°C–26°C under agitation, in the dark.\nNote: During this incubation step, prepare hybridization solution for steps 28 and 29. For the pre-hyb phase (step 28), calculate the volume needed by multiplying 300 μL by the number of wells to be stained, and dispense the calculated volume in a conical tube, plus some additional extra to account for pipetting errors due to solution viscosity. Heat the tube at 58°C until ready to use. For step 29, aliquot hybridization solution as 300 μL fractions in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and heat them up to 85°C for 15 min prior to use. Each fraction is enough for one well (probe/condition combination) in the hybridization step.\nWash sections twice in 1× PBS under agitation, for 5 min each.\nTreat sections with acetylation solution:\nIn a glass graduated cylinder, prepare acetylation solution by mixing 20 mL of 0.1 M triethanolamine-HCl pH 8.0 (freshly prepared right before the beginning of the protocol; see Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section for details) with 50 μL of acetic anhydride.\nAdd 1 mL of acetylation solution per well.\nPipet an additional 2 μL of concentrated acetic anhydride per well.\nGently mix on a plate rocker for 10 min (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nWash sections twice in 1× PBS under agitation, for 5 min each.",
    "Transfer the plate to a humidified chamber and place it at 58°C. Water bath or hybridization oven may be used at this and following steps.\nNote: Humidified chambers are commercially available and should be completely sealed to avoid evaporation during the long pre-hyb and hybridization steps. It is also possible to construct a humidified chamber by attaching railings made of serological plastic pipettes to the bottom of a Tupperware plastic container (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Lay pieces of Kimwipes wetted with 5× SSC solution at the bottom of the container to create a humidified atmosphere with similar vapor pressure as the hybridization solution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/227-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Critical Equipment and Setup during Dual Staining Protocol\n(A) Home-made humidified chamber (top), showing railings constructed with serological pipettes attached to the bottom of a plastic container (bottom).\n(B) Wetted Kimwipes placed under the railings (top) and positioning of 12-well plate inside humidified chamber (bottom).\n(C) Lateral view of 12-well plate inside humidified chamber (top) and heated oven for high temperature incubations during the in situ hybridization phase of the dual protocol (bottom).\nEquilibrate sections to the pre-hyb temperature by incubating in 1× PBS at 58°C for 5 min.\nPre-hybridization. Pre-hybridize sections with at least 300 μL of pre-warmed pre-hyb solution at 58°C for 1 h, in a humidified chamber. Place the plate on the railings and close the plate lid before sealing the chamber (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and C) (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nNote: For all changes of solution at 58°C, remove the plate from the humidified chamber and place it on top of a heated block, returning it to the sealed chamber immediately after the change has been made.",
    "Ten minutes prior to the end of the previous incubation step, mix pre-warmed hybridization solution with the two 1 kb digoxigenin-labeled cRNA riboprobes to detect c-Fos mRNA (see Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section for details). The concentration of each probe in the working hybridization solution should be 400 ng/mL. Quickly mix by inversion and place the tube containing probes and hyb solution at 85°C and denature for 5–10 min.\nHybridization. Remove pre-hyb solution from each well and add probe-containing working hybridization solution (300 μL per well). It is best to perform solution changes by removing and adding liquid to one well at a time.\nCritical: Make sure the sections lay flat at the bottom of each well for the hybridization step. Curled or folded sections result in artifactual staining. If necessary, unfold the sections with a paintbrush.\nReturn the plate to the humidified chamber, close the plate lid, seal the chamber, and place it back at 58°C. Perform hybridization for 16 h (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nWashes with solutions of increasing stringency:\nPre-warm 2× SSC, 0.2× SSC, and 0.1× SSC to 55°C (see Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section for details on how to prepare wash solutions).\nLower the temperature of the humidified chamber to 55°C by transferring it to another bath or oven for 15 min.\nRemove hybridization solution from each well at a time and add 500 μL of pre-warmed 2× SSC wash solution.\nIncubate for 30 min with occasional manual agitation.\nPerform sequential washes in 0.2× SSC and 0.1× SSC at 55°C, for 20 min each.\nRemove the humidified chamber from the bath or oven. Replace solution in each well with 0.1× SSC at 23°C–26°C. Incubate for 3–5 min to equilibrate sections to 23°C–26°C.",
    "Permeabilize in PTw solution at 23°C–26°C for 10 min. Perform these and subsequent washes and incubations under gentle agitation.\nEquilibrate sections in TN buffer by performing two washes at 23°C–26°C for 5 min each.\nBlock sections in TNB buffer at 23°C–26°C for 3 h.\nProbe immunodetection. Incubate sections in TNB buffer containing horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:400; Merck/Roche) at 4°C for 2 days in a sealed humidified chamber.\nNote: The immunodetection step can be performed with 300 μL of antibody solution. If using limited volumes, make sure the agitation process does not lead to curling up of sections inside the well. The humidified chamber must contain Kimwipes wetted with PBS or water. Make sure the solution inside each well does not evaporate during this long incubation step.\nSignal development:\nWash each well six times in TNT buffer, for 5 min each, under gentle agitation at 23°C–26°C. During washes, prepare enough volume of tyramide-biotin solution, by mixing amplification diluent (Perkin Elmer) with H2O2 (to reach a final concentration of 0.0015%) and tyramide-biotin (1:50; Perkin Elmer). If using 30% H2O2 as a concentrated stock, it is advisable to generate intermediate dilution steps to reach the desired 0.0015% concentration with great precision.\nCritical: The tyramide-biotin solution must be prepared fresh immediately before the following step.\nIncubate sections in tyramide-biotin solution for 15 min at 23°C–26°C.\nNote: If using a small volume of solution at this or subsequent signal development steps (less than 150 μL), overlay a round piece of Parafilm, cut to the size of the well, onto the sections to ensure that they are submerged in liquid (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nWash 6 times in TNT buffer, for 5 min each, under gentle agitation at 23°C–26°C.\nIncubate sections in TNB buffer containing peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:100; Perkin Elmer) at 23°C–26°C for 1 h.",
    "Wash 6 times in TNT buffer, for 5 min each, under gentle agitation at 23°C–26°C.\nDuring washes in the previous step, prepare enough volume of tyramide-Alexa 555 fluorescent development reagent, by mixing 1× amplification diluent (Thermo) with H2O2 (to reach a final concentration of 0.0015%) and tyramide-Alexa 555 (1:100; Thermo).\nIncubate sections in tyramide-Alexa 555 solution for 15 min at 23°C–26°C in the dark.\nNote: From this point on, perform all steps without exposure to direct light (for example, in a dimly lit room) and cover the plate with aluminum foil during the incubations and washes.\nWash 6 times in TNT buffer, for 5 min each, under gentle agitation at 23°C–26°C.\nPause Point: It is recommended to proceed to the next step (c-Fos protein immunostaining) immediately after c-Fos mRNA signal development. However, if necessary, a brief pause (up to 2 days at 4°C) may be introduced at this step. Staining resulting from tyramide labeling is chemically stable and concerns about mRNA integrity are no longer necessary.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S2. Use of Parafilm in Incubation Steps with Small Volumes (Refer to Step 38 in the Step-By-Step Protocol)\nVideo showing details on how cut Parafilm pieces may be laid inside each well containing a small volume of incubation solution. This is especially important for steps with antibody and tyramide solutions, which may be limited reagents in our dual staining protocol.\nc-Fos Immunostaining\nTiming: 2.5 days",
    "After fluorescent detection of c-Fos mRNA by in situ hybridization with DIG-labeled cRNA riboprobes, sections are subjected to regular immunostaining to detect c-Fos protein, indicative of neuron activation relative to the first window of sensory stimulation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). This phase in the protocol includes blocking, incubation with primary anti-c-Fos antibody, incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody, nuclear counterstaining, and section mounting onto glass microscope slides.\nPermeabilize sections in 0.3% Triton X-100/1× PBS for 10 min.\nBlocking. Perform a first blocking step in 1% blocking reagent (Thermo) for 1 h at 23°C–26°C under gentle agitation.\nPerform a second blocking step in 0.3% Triton X-100/1% BSA/1× PBS for 30 min at 23°C–26°C under gentle agitation.\nPrimary antibody incubation. Incubate in anti-c-Fos antibody solution [0.3% Triton X-100/1% BSA/1× PBS containing anti-c-Fos antibody (1:1500; Ab2; Millipore)] for 2 days at 4°C, under gentle agitation.\nWashes. Wash sections three times in 0.1% Triton X-100/1× PBS, for 15 min each.\nSecondary antibody incubation. Incubate in anti-rabbit secondary antibody solution [0.3% Triton X-100/1% BSA/1× PBS containing Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500; Thermo)] for 3 h at 23°C–26°C, under gentle agitation.\nOptional: (instead of steps 39–44). Alternatively, instead of using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody, it is possible to perform tyramide signal development for c-Fos immunodetection. Tyramide signal amplification boosts up staining after c-Fos detection. This is rarely necessary, even though it may be used if the experimenter has performed the protocol as indicated and concluded that the resulting c-Fos immunostaining is weak. This outcome is usually due to sub-optimal c-Fos antibody or failure to comply with the strict timing guidelines described in our protocol. Should tyramide amplification be applied, use the following procedure after step 38:\nIncubate sections in 3% H2O2/1× PBS for 1 h to inactivate peroxidases from previous steps.",
    "Incubate sections in 0.1 M HCl/0.9% NaCl for 15 min.\nWash 6 times in TNT buffer, for 5 min each.\nPermeabilize sections in 0.3% Triton X-100/1× PBS for 10 min.\nPerform a first blocking step in 1% blocking reagent (Thermo) for 1 h at 23°C–26°C under gentle agitation.\nPerform a second blocking step in 0.3% Triton X-100/1% BSA/1× PBS for 30 min at 23°C–26°C under gentle agitation.\nIncubate in anti-c-Fos antibody solution [0.3% Triton X-100/1% BSA/1× PBS containing anti-c-Fos antibody (1:1500; Ab2; Millipore)] for 2 days at 4°C, under gentle agitation.\nWash sections three times in 0.1% Triton X-100/1× PBS, for 15 min each.\nWash sections for an additional 15 min with 1× PBS to remove Triton X-100.\nIncubate with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody in 1% blocking reagent (1:100; Thermo) for 1 h at 23°C–26°C.\nWash three times with 1× PBS, for 15 min each.\nDuring washes in the previous step, prepare enough volume of tyramide-Alexa 488 fluorescent development reagent, by mixing amplification diluent (Thermo) with H2O2 (to reach a final concentration of 0.0015%) with tyramide-Alexa 488 (1:100; Thermo).\nIncubate sections in tyramide-Alexa 488 solution for 5–10 min at 23°C–26°C.\nNote: If using a small volume of solution at this step (less than 150 μL), overlay a round piece of Parafilm, cut to the size of the well, onto the sections to ensure that they are submerged in liquid (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nWash three times with 1× PBS, for 15 min each.\nCounterstain with TO-PRO-3 iodide solution (1:1,000; Thermo) in 1× PBS for 15 min.\nOptional: If the confocal microscope used for imaging the sections contains a UV laser, sections may be alternatively counterstained with DAPI or Hoechst 33342.\nWash twice in 1× PBS, for 5 min each.\nSection mounting:",
    "Pipet 1 mL of 1× PBS onto a glass microscope slide (SuperFrost; Thermo) and use a fine paintbrush to transfer each stained section to the pool formed by PBS. Unfold the sections and apply pressure to make them sink to the bottom of the pool and adhere to the glass slide.\nCarefully remove PBS from the microscope slide using a p1000 pipetman, making sure the sections are not disturbed and not made to overlap with each other.\nRemove the excess of liquid by tilting the slide and gently touching a piece of Kimwipes.\nPipet 100–150 μL of ProLong Gold antifade mounting reagent (Thermo) and carefully and slowly overlay with a 24 x 60 mm glass coverslip, without introducing air bubbles.\nMaintain the slides at 23°C–26°C or at 4°C for at least 12 h in a dry container protected from light. This step will allow ProLong to harden before subjecting the slides to microscopy imaging.\nMicroscopy Imaging",
    "After sections are stained and mounted onto a glass microscope slide, they may be imaged using a suitable instrument. Considering that the sections in this protocol are thick (40 μm), a confocal microscope or equivalent imaging technique is required. We usually perform collection of images as a z-series with either a 40× or a 63× planar objective, under oil, on a confocal microscope. Each optical section should be very thin (less than 0.5 μm thick). Individual optical sections are informative because they can reveal fine details of the location of c-Fos mRNA staining inside the nucleus. Such staining usually appears as two foci of red fluorescence (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). However, because these foci are rarely on the same optical plane, it may be required to produce maximum intensity projection images across the z-series to visualize both foci and the eventual co-localization with c-Fos protein derived from immunostaining, which is expressed across the entire nucleus of the activated neuron (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9], and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11])."
