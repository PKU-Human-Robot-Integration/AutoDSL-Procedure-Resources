    "The experiments involving animal work are performed with all necessary approvals from the Laboratory Animal Welfare Ethics Committee of Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine (R52021-0506). Female and male C57BL/6J mice aged between 8-10 weeks were used in the study.\n1. Preparation of the simplified anesthesia equipment (OPTIONAL)\nNOTE: This is an optional pre-operative set up and can be replaced with titratable anesthesia as mentioned in section 2. The institutional animal ethics committee and veterinarian(s) should be consulted prior to adapting this set up in animal procedures.\nTake a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and make a cut perpendicular to the long axis of the tube about 3 cm from the opening.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the cut is greater than half of the circular circumference of the tube lumen so that the valve can be successfully inserted.\nDrill holes (diameter, 2 mm) at the centrifuge tube wall between the cut and the tube opening.\nCut a suitably sized piece of the valve from a plastic sheet and insert the valve into the cut on the tube wall.\n\tNOTE: The valve can be used to control the release rate of isoflurane by changing the depth of the insertion.\nInside a fume hood, cut open the bottom of the tube and connect it to the oxygen supply. Place a cotton ball near the bottom end of the tube, add load 0.5 mL isoflurane (as obtained, see Table of Materials) onto the cotton ball, and close the valve.\nTest the anesthesia efficacy by masking the mice with tubes prepared as described above. Monitor the breathing rate and anesthesia depth by toe pinch response.",
    "​NOTE: A breathing rate less than 10 times/10 s suggests excessive anesthesia, and the insertion depth of the valve should be adjusted. For all the procedures involving anesthesia, a gas filter filled with activated charcoal sheets must be used (Figure 1A-i), and surgery should be performed within a hood.\n2. Operative preparation and anesthesia\nPrepare and sterilize all the required instruments on the day of surgery, including a pair of forceps, a micro-mosquito hemostat, a pair of surgical scissors, two pairs of needle holders, 4-0 silk surgical suture, 6-0 silk surgical suture, a gas filter, and a light source (see Table of Materials) (Figure 1A).\nPut on a surgical mask and sterile gloves.\nApply the depilatory cream to the mouse chest and wait for 1 min. Gently wipe off the depilatory cream and hair with wet gauze.\nHold the mouse with the dominant hand after depilation. Induce anesthesia via inhalation of vaporized isoflurane (4%) with oxygen supply (1L/min) and maintain at 2-3% isoflurane.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by the lack of toe pinch response.\nApply sterile eye cream to both eyes to prevent corneal dryness.\nSecure the mice on a surgery platform in the supine position. Apply povidone-iodine swabs (see Table of Materials) to the chest three times and cover the disinfected chest with a sterile drape.\n3. Induction of myocardial infarction\nChange the contaminated gloves to ensure sterility.\nMake a 0.5 cm skin cut along the line connecting the xiphoid and armpit after local block with lidocaine.\nBluntly separate the pectoral major and pectoral minor muscles using forceps and a micro-mosquito hemostat to expose the fourth intercostal space.\nOpen the fourth intercostal space using a micro-mosquito hemostat.\nExternalize the heart by pushing the heart toward the fourth intercostal space with the index finger of the left hand.",
    "Secure the heart with the left hand, and ligate the left anterior descending branch with a 6-0 suture 3 mm from its origin.\nPlace the heart back into the thoracic cavity quickly.\n\tNOTE: It is safe to externalize the heart for less than 30 s.\nEvacuate the air out of the thoracic cavity by a gentle press of the chest cavity manually.\nClose the muscle layer over the ribs with a 6-0 silk suture.\nClose the skin with a 4-0 silk suture.\nPlace the mice on a pad (37 °C) immediately after the operation.\nInject buprenorphine (0.05-0.1mg/kg) subcutaneously every 4-6 hours to reduce post-operative pain for up to 72 hours.\nReturn the operated mice to cages when fully recovered.\n\tNOTE: The mice will be fully recovered within 3-5 min after surgery.\nCarefully monitor the mice and provide wet food for up to 7 days.\n4. Harvesting the tissues\nSacrifice the mice at different time points after MI establishment by cervical dislocation.\nSecure the sacrificed mice on the surgery platform in the supine position.\nMake a ventral incision (~3-4 cm) in the upper abdomen. Cut off the ribs from both sides of the thorax cavity, and remove the diaphragm.\nPerfuse the heart with 10 mL cold phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS, 4 °C) through intraventricular injection.\nCollect the heart by cutting off the aortic root and immediately store the heart at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: According to the authors' experience, it is feasible to perform TTC staining within two weeks of storage.\nStain the heart with 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC).\n\t\nSlice the frozen heart into 1 mm thick sections on ice using razor blades.\nIncubate the prepared heart slices in 1% TTC solution (dissolved in 1x PBS) at 37 °C for 10-15 min.",
    "NOTE: After 15 min incubation, discard the TTC solution and immerse the stained heart slices into 1x PBS.\nPhotograph the slices using a digital camera.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
