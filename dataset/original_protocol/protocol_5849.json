    "Measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a VP-ITC Microcalorimeter (Malvern Instruments Ltd). The volume of both the reference and the sample cell was 1.4 ml.The solutions containing the titrant (CPP) and the titrated (14-3-3c) molecules have to be identical to avoid heat changes due to the dilution of the titrant into the sample cell. The following table describes the appropriate dilutions required to prepare the solutions containing the titrant (CPP) and the titrated (14-3-3c) molecules at 500 μM and 50 μM concentration respectively:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731002009_2438.jpgAs highlighted in the table, since CPP stock is in MilliQ water, in preparing 14-3-3c dilution it is necessary to use the same proportion of MilliQ water used in the preparation of the CPP dilution to have identical solutions for both titrant (CPP) and titrated molecule (14-3-3c). Prior to loading MilliQ water and sample solutions into the machine, load them into the 3 ml plastic tubes (see equipment) together with stir bars 7 mm and degas them for 5 min by using the Vacuum pump (ThermoVac). This instrument is indeed designed to allocate the 3 ml plastic tubes and favorite the degassing by combining the vacuum with a gently stirring.Centrifuge both protein and titrant at 16,000 x g, for 5 min, at 4 °C.Filling procedure of reference/sample cell (Video 1):Insert the 2.5 ml glass syringe until you gently touch the bottom of the cell with the tip of the syringe.Inject slowly and constantly the solution, removing, at the same time, the needle from the cell. In this way, the cell is filled from the bottom to the top, and the operation avoids the formation of bubbles.",
    "Position the tip of the syringe on the ledge present just below the visible portion of the cell port and draw the liquid to remove the excess of liquid from the cell. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Filling procedure of reference/sample cell. The video shows the steps necessary for the proper loading of the solutions into the reference/sample cells (see Steps 5a-5c). For simplicity, the video describes only the filling of the sample cell.Fill the reference cell with MilliQ water.Fill the sample cell with the protein (in this case 14-3-3c, 50 μM).Note: In order to obtain a reliable measurement, both reference and sample cells must be precisely filled. This operation can be performed by loading a larger volume of solution (2 ml recommended) compared to the maximum capacity of the cells. Often, the low yield of purified protein limits this operation. Nevertheless, use at least 1.6 ml to be sure to appropriately load the sample. The proper loading of the solutions is a critical step in order to avoid the formation of bubbles, which severely impair the measurements. The volume of the injection syringe is 300 μl. Thus, to appropriately load the titrant, prepare at least 500 μl of the titrant sample.Load the titrant (in this case CPP, 500 μM) into the injection syringe with the following procedure (Video 2):Connect the plastic tubing of a filling syringe to the filling port of the injection syringe.Place the titrant sample in a glass filling tube, and insert it into the pipette stand of the machine.Slowly withdraw the plunger of the filling syringe to draw up the solution containing the titrant.Purge the bottom \"close fill port\" as soon as the titrant solution begins to exit the filling port.Perform a refill step in order to remove any air bubbles from the injection syringe.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.",
    "Filling procedure of the injection syringe. The video shows the steps necessary for the proper loading of the titrant into the injection syringe (see Steps 9a-9e).Titrate CPP using injection volumes of 10 μl. The spacing between consecutive injections is 150 sec. A total of 29 injections are performed.Note: The volume of the first injection is 2 μl, 1/5 of the settled injection volume. This is needed to equilibrate the interface between the tip of the injection syringe and the surrounding solution of the sample cell. The heat change caused by this first injection has to be discarded during data analysis. Because of this first 2 μl injection, a total of 292 μl of titrant out of the 300 μl loaded into the syringe will be used and 8 μl will be left into the syringe after the experiment. It is worth noting that the concentration of the titrant and the titrated molecules, as well as the injection volumes and the spacing time between consecutive injections, is appropriate for the molecules used in this protocol. These parameters must be optimized for every sample.Note: In the initial phase of setting parameters, a 10-fold difference in the concentration between the titrant and the titrated molecule should be maintained. This usually ensures a complete saturation of the binding reaction for those interactions having a binding affinity in the nM to μM range. If there is evidence that the binding affinity of the system under study is in the hundred μM to mM range, however, the fold difference of the concentration between the titrant and the titrated molecule should be increased.  Moreover, the spacing should be set at 180 sec, which is usually a long enough time to ensure the complete recovery of the heat baseline upon titrant injection.",
    "In case your measurement requires a different time to return to the baseline, adapt the spacing time to your system. Data extrapolated from measurements performed with different spacing times can be combined, as long as the baseline is completely recovered and the concentration of titrant/titrated molecules and the injection volumes are the same."
