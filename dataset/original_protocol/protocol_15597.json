    "1. Creating transgenic strains\nUsing a cloning method of choice8,9, clone expression vectors to contain the Pflp-18 or Prig-3 promoter (for AVA-specific signal in the ventral nerve cord), followed by the Ca2+ indicator of choice, and then a 3' UTR (see the discussion for more information)10. A list of plasmids and their sources can be found in Supplemental Table 1.\nFollow the established protocol for the creation of transgenic strains via the microinjection of a DNA mix (<100 ng/μL; see Supplemental Table 1 for the concentrations of each plasmid) containing the Ca2+ indicator transgene (~20 ng/μL) and the rescue DNA lin-15+ (selection marker) into the gonad of a 1 day old adult C. elegans10 (genotype: lin-15(n765ts); phenotype: multi-vulva)10,11.\n\tNOTE. Maintain lin-15(n765ts) parents at 15 °C to suppress temperature-sensitive mutation.\nMaintain the injected parents at 20 °C until the F1 progeny reach adulthood to allow for transgenic selection using the absence of the multi-vulva phenotype.\nClonally passage13 adult F1 progeny that do not have the multi-vulva phenotype as this indicates the expression of the extrachromosomal array containing the Ca2+ indicator11.\nAssess the expression of the Ca2+ indicator in the F2 or F3 progeny that do not have the multi-vulva phenotype by mounting and imaging 1 day old adults as described later in section 3.\n\tNOTE. A relatively high expression of the indicator is required for the rapid acquisition of images as described here (see the discussion for more detail).\nPerform experiments on subsequent generations of the transgenic strains with an optimal expression of the Ca2+ indicator (see the discussion for more detail), maintaining the strains under standard conditions (20 °C on NGM plates)12.\n2. Optical setup\nUse a microscope capable of long-term time-lapse imaging.",
    "NOTE. The representative data were acquired using an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with 488 nm and 561 nm excitation lasers.\nUse a low-magnification objective (i.e., 10x/0.40) for the crude localization of the worm.\nTo achieve subcellular resolution, switch to and localize the neurons using a high-magnification objective.\n\tNOTE. A 100x/1.40 NA oil objective was used to acquire the representative data in this study.\nAcquire the images using an ultra-sensitive camera capable of rapid image acquisition (>50 fps).\nUse a standard emission filter for the Ca2+ indicator of choice (i.e., a 525 nm ± 50 nm emission filter for GCaMP6f and mitoGCaMP).\nAdd a Z-drift corrector (ZDC) for the acquisition of image streams longer than 10 s, as the desiccation of the agar pad during the imaging session causes the neurite to drift out of focus within several seconds.\n\tNOTE. If a microscopy set-up does not allow for ZDC, or if long (>20 min) imaging periods are desired, then apply a border of silicon grease or melted petroleum jelly around the agar pad to slow the desiccation.\n3. Preparation of worms for imaging\nPreparing the agar pads\n\t\nMake 3 mL of 10% agar by dissolving molecular grade agar in M912 in a 13 mm x 100 mm glass culture tube and microwaving for several seconds (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE. Molten agar can be kept on a heat block for up to 1 h or can be made fresh each time agar pads are needed.\nPlace a microscope slide between two additional slides that each have two layers of laboratory tape (see Figure 1A-i).\nCut the tip of a 1,000 μL pipette tip (without a filter), and use it to pipette a small drop of agar onto the center coverslip (Figure 1A-i).",
    "Flatten the agar by pressing another slide down on top of the agar (Figure 1A-ii).\nAfter cooling, cut the agar into a small disc using the opening of a 13 mm x 100 mm glass culture tube (Figure 1A-iii), and then remove the surrounding agar.\nPreparing the worm-rolling solution\n\t\nDissolve muscimol powder in M9 to create a 30 mM stock. Separate into 50 μL aliquots, and store at 4 °C.\nThaw a new aliquot of 30 mM muscimol every 3-5 days (and store at 20 °C while in use).\nDilute a 30 mM muscimol stock in a 1:1 ratio with polystyrene beads to make the rolling solution.\nPositioning a worm for imaging\n\t\nPlace 1.6 μL of the rolling solution onto the center of the agar pad.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of liquid should be adjusted for imaging younger (less) or older animals (more).\nUsing the preferred worm pick (i.e., a glass or platinum wire pick)13, transfer a worm of the desired age without the multi-vulva phenotype11 into the rolling solution on the agar pad (Figure 1A-iv).\n\t\tNOTE. The representative data are from 1 day old hermaphrodites (GCaMP6f strain = FJH185; mitoGCaMP strain; FJH597; see Supplemental Table 1), which can be identified by the presence of only one row of eggs. See the discussion for more detail on working with worms of different ages.\nWait for ~5 min for the muscimol to reduce the worm movement, and then drop a 22 mm x 22 mm coverslip on top of the agar pad, physically restricting the worm movement.\nFor imaging neurites in the ventral nerve cord, roll the worm into the orientation shown in Figure 1B,C by lightly sliding the coverslip.",
    "NOTE. To visualize the ventral nerve cord, position the worm with the head upward, and roll the worm until the intestine is on the right side of the proximal portion and the left for the distal portion of the worm (from the viewer's perspective). Invert this orientation (Figure 1C) for imaging neurites in the dorsal nerve cord.\nMounting the worm on a microscope\n\t\nPlace a drop of immersion oil onto the coverslip before mounting it onto the microscope stage.\nFind the worm using a low-magnification objective (10x) objective in brightfield.\nSwitch to the 100x objective, and adjust the focus.\nLocate the AVA neurite using the illumination of the GCaMP or mitoGCaMP with the 488 nm imaging laser.\n\t\tNOTE: Use small adjustments to prevent squishing the worm or pulling off the coverslip.\n4. Acquisition of high-resolution image streams\nIn vivo GCaMP imaging\n\t\nSet the exposure time to 20 ms.\nAdjust the imaging laser and acquisition settings until the basal GCaMP fluorescence is in the mid-range of the camera's dynamic range14. Refer to the discussion for suggestions on optimizing the imaging parameters using other microscopy setups.\n\t\t​NOTE. For the optical setup used in this study, set the 488 nm imaging laser to the following output settings: laser power = 50% and attenuation = 1. Modify the additional acquisition settings as follows: EM gain = 200 and pre-amplifier gain = 1.\nAfter the AVA neurite is located using the GCaMP fluorescence at 100x magnification, set the ZDC (see Table of Materials) to a range of ±30 μm, and initiate continuous autofocusing. Manually correct the focal plane as needed before imaging.\nAcquire a stream of images at 100x magnification. Durations as long as 10 min can be achieved with the setup used in this study.\nIn vivo mitoGCaMP imaging",
    "Follow steps 4.1.1-4.1.2 as needed to acquire the basal mitoGCaMP fluorescence in the mid-range for the camera's dynamic range14.\n\t\tNOTE. For the optical set-up used in this study, set the 488 nm imaging laser to the following output settings: laser power = 20% and attenuation = 10. Modify the acquisition settings to the following: EM gain = 100 and pre-amplifier gain = 2.\nAfter the mitochondria in the AVA neurite are located using the mitoGCaMP fluorescence, set the ZDC as described above in step 3.3.\nAcquire a stream of images at 100x magnification.\n5. Image stream analysis\nOpen the image stream in an appropriate image software for analyzing the pixel values in an image series (see Table of Materials).\nUsing the Polygon Selection tool, define the subcellular region of interest (ROI) containing GCaMP or mitoGCaMP.\nClick on Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager. In the ROI Manager, click Add and then More > Multi Measure. In the Multi Measure window, click OK to automatically collect the average, minimum, and maximum pixel intensities of the ROI defined above for each frame of the image stream for further analysis.\n\tNOTE. It is recommended that the average pixel intensity (Favg) is normalized to the minimum intensity (Fmin) for each ROI using the ratio Favg/Fmin to account for fluorescence differences due to positioning in the z-plane. Discard the image streams with worm movement during imaging since this would also affect the fluorescence measurements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
