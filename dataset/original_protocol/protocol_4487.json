    "Arabidopsis thaliana seeds have to be washed and sterilized superficially before sowing. For this purpose, approximately 200 seeds are placed in a 1.5 ml microtube, and 1 ml of washing solution is added. Shake seeds for 30 min at room temperature in a shaker (Kühner shaker). Remove washing solution. Add 1 ml of sterilization solution. Shake again for 10 min at room temperature. Remove sterilization solution and wash seeds by tube inverting four times with sterile distilled water. Finally, seeds are placed in 1.5 ml microtubes and kept in stratification at 4 °C in the cold chamber for 3 days in order to break seed dormancy and synchronize the germination.Place Arabidopsis seeds inside Phytatray II boxes with 50 ml of liquid MS media on a sterile gauze sheet over a sterile stainless steel screen (Figures 1 and 2) in a laminar flow cabinet, using an aqueous agarose solution (0.15%) to sow seeds individually. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150706/20150706200556_0118.jpgFigure 1.

Pictures showing the hydroponic cultures in the Phytatray II boxes For the propagation of the T. harzianum strain, incubate a fungal plug of 5 mm of diameter, grown and sporulated on a petri dish with PDA, at least 7 days at room temperature, to achieve full coverage of the plate surface with spores. To harvest the spores, add 5 ml of sterile distilled water to the plate. Filter this suspension in 1.5 ml microtubes with glass wool, placed on 15 ml tubes, in order to remove traces of mycelium (Figure 3 and 4). Spores are maintained at 4 °C no more than 1 week. Finally, determine spore concentration in a Thoma cell counting chamber by pipetting 100 μl of a 1:100 dilution, using the following formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",

Harvest of T. harzianum sporesUse spores of T. harzianum (107 spores) to inoculate 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml of PDB. Maintain cultures at 25 °C and 200 rpm for 48 h. Harvest mycelia (approximately 250 mg) by filtration (filtration system: vacuum/pressure pump PALL, safety glass, rubber plugs, vacuum flask pirex and magnetic filter funnel). Wash the mycelia through the magnetic funnel with 100 ml of sterile water (Figure 5). Use the washed mycelia to inoculate the Phytatray boxes containing Arabidopsis plants grown for 21 days. Inoculate mycelia by lifting the stainless steel screen where the Arabidopsis seedlings are, with the help of sterile forceps (Figure 6). Place mycelia on MS media and shake (shaker Certomat® R) in order to promote dispersion.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150706/20150706200657_3043.jpgFigure 5.

Procedure to inoculate the mycelia into the Phytatray boxesFinally, keep hydroponic cultures for 20 days at 80 rpm and 22 °C in a plant growth chamber with 40% humidity under long daylight conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) (light intensity of 80 to 100 µE/µm2/s). Afterwards, roots are recovered using sterile scissors on a laminar flow cabinet. Wash the roots with sterile water to remove mycelia traces. Dry the roots on filter paper and finally freeze them in liquid nitrogen. Lyophilize using a Lyophilizer Virtis Advantage until the water from the roots is entirely removed. Collected samples are ready for nucleic acid extraction or qPCR procedures. Success of root invasion is analyzed by qPCR. The corresponding protocols are described in Alonso-Ramírez et al. (2014)."
