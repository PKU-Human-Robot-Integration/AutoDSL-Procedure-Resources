    "The eggs and unhatched embryos are cared for and treated ethically and humanely. All protocols for unhatched embryo use were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.\n1. Eggs and Preparation of Expression Constructs\nEggs:\nIncubate 3 - 4 dozen fertilized chicken eggs (Gallus gallus) lying flat on their sides at 37 °C.\n\t\t\nAfter 24 hr of incubation, pull 3 cc of albumen with a syringe from the round back end of the egg and seal the hole with clear tape. This creates an air chamber between the embryo and the eggshell, allowing for ease of access to the embryo without the embryo sticking to the shell when cutting the window for access on top of the egg 19.\nAt 117 hr of incubation time, stage the embryos according to Hamburger and Hamilton 20 developmental stages at E4 (HH24-25) (See Figure 1D).\nExpression Constructs:\nPrepare the plasmid DNA using reagents and the protocol provided by the manufacturer of a commercially available preparation kit. At the final step of preparation, elute the DNA into 500 µl TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer provided in the kit into a 1.5 ml tube.\nEthanol precipitate the DNA to concentrate it by adding 50 µl of 3 M Sodium Acetate and 1 ml of 100% Ethanol to the tube. Place the tube at -20 °C O/N.\nCentrifuge the tube for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and air-dry the pellet for 10 min at RT. Dissolve the pellet in 15 µl TE buffer, which should yield a concentration of ~4 µg/µl.\n\t\tNOTE: The control expression constructs used here are pMES-IRES-GFP10, which is driven by a chicken β-actin promoter, or pCI-H2B-IRES-RFP10, which is driven by the CMV promoter.",
    "2. Chicken In Ovo Micro-electroporation and In Ovo Cell Proliferation Assay\nIn Ovo Micro-injection of Expression Construct and Micro-electroporation:\nPull the glass capillary tubes into fine needles using a micro-pipette puller with the following optimized parameters for a 2.5 x 2.5 mm Box Platinum Heating Filament: Pressure = 500, Heat = 600 °C, Pull = 64, Velocity = 105, and Time = 150 msec (see Table 1).\nSet up the Left- and Right-handed micro-manipulator stages flanking the microscope (see Figure 1A). The Right-handed micro-manipulator holds the glass capillary needle and the Left-handed micro-manipulator holds the electrodes (Figure 1A).\nPrepare the finely pulled glass capillary needle for micro-injection by cutting the tip of the needle with a forceps while working under the microscope.\nFill the needle manually by hand using the micro-manipulator with 2.5 µl of plasmid DNA tinted with 0.1% Fast Green while working under the microscope.\nPlace the egg lying on its side within a mold/egg holding device (see Figure 1A). Cut a round window on top of the egg using scissors 19 (Figure 1A).\nWhile working under the microscope, carefully open the two membranes overlaying the embryo using forceps.\nWhile working under the microscope, deliver approximately ~0.5 µl of plasmid DNA to the right otic vesicle lumen by micro-injection manually using the right hand by using the micro-manipulator and by micro-electroporation.\n\t\t\nTo do so, micro-inject the right otic vesicle lumen with the DNA with the Right-hand micro-manipulator (Figure 1B-D) while at the same time using the left hand holding a forcep to steady the head of the embryo, because the head of the embryo dips at stage E4. Do not micro-inject past the otic vesicle lumen, because this will damage the otic vesicle.",
    "Immediately after micro-injection, while working under the microscope, use the Left-hand micro-manipulator to place the positive (anode) 2 mm platinum electrode anterior-ventral to the right otic vesicle and the negative 2 mm electrode (cathode) in parallel 1 mm apart (see Figure 1 C). Deliver 4 pulses at 12 V with 100 msec duration and 200 msec spacing. The left otic vesicle serves as an internal untreated control.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Clean the electrodes in between electroporations with a cotton-tipped swab dipped in 1x PBS.\nIn Ovo Cell Proliferation Assay:\nImmediately after electroporation add 50 μl of 0.25 mg/ml EdU in 1x PBS by manually dropping the 50 μl EdU solution onto the whole embryo in ovo using a pipette. Seal the eggs with tape and return to the incubator for 18 - 96 hr.\nCarefully remove the tape and check the embryos for fluorescent GFP or RFP signal within the otic vesicle after 18 - 24 hr using a standard fluorescent microscope (see Figure 1 E-E'). If fluorescent signal is present, at this point harvest the embryos for analyses or reseal with tape and return it to the incubator for harvesting and analyses at later stages (see Figure 1 F-P'').\n\t\tNOTE: Expression of GFP signal with the pMES-IRES-GFP construct is evident 6 - 7 hr after electroporation 10.\n3. Embryo Harvesting and Tissue Processing for RNA In Situ hybridization and Immunohistochemistry\nHarvest the embryos using forceps. Rinse the embryo in cold 1x PBS. Remove the heads of the embryos, by cutting the head by its neck using forceps, and place the heads into 4% paraformaldehyde O/N at 4 °C. Puncture the brain using a forcep to allow penetration of the 4% paraformaldehyde inside the head.\nDehydrate the heads in 30% sucrose (in 1x PBS) O/N at 4 °C.",
    "Mount the heads in cryoprotective medium by rapid freezing in a slurry of dry ice and methylbutane (2-Methylbutane). Alternatively, rapid freeze the heads in cryoprotective medium with liquid nitrogen. Store the mounted heads at -80 °C.\nCryosection the heads into 12 µm thick tissue sections and collect all the inner ear-containing tissue sections onto superfrosted microscope glass slides.\nPerform standard RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry as previously described 4,21, and analyze for EdU cell proliferation following the protocol provided by the manufacturer of the kit.\n\tNOTE: Hair cells can be identified using rabbit polyclonal α-MyosinVIIa (Myo7a) antibody (1:1,000, Proteus Biosciences) and fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody (1:250, Goat anti-Rabbit AlexaFluor 488; Invitrogen).\n4. Image Capture and Processing\nTake images with digital imaging equipment. Image immunohistochemistry results with a standard fluorescent microscope and results of the in situ using a standard wide-field microscope (ranging from 5x to 40x in magnification).\nProcess the images using image processing software.\nSubscription Required.
