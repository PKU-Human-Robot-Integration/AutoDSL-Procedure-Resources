    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart one: Growth during NO exposure\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis is the main NO-exposure experiment. Bacterial cells are grown in the presence or absence of the NO donor. The GFP+ Phmp::mCherry strain will identify bacteria that are responding to the NO treatment, since Phmp should drive mCherry expression in the presence of NO, while the untreated control will serve as the baseline for background mCherry expression. Every two hours after treatment, aliquots of samples are measured for absorbance (A600 nm) to assess bacterial growth or growth inhibition by NO treatment. Additionally, aliquots are taken for fixation. These fixed samples will be used for microscopy imaging in Major Steps Two and Three.\nFrom the o/n cultures, dilute bacterial cells 1:50 into fresh LB or fresh LB + DETA NONOate prepared earlier (See preparing the working stocks[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\nFor Yptb growth, we typically start with 3 mL LB per tube.\nAdd 60 μL of overnight (o/n) culture to 3 mL LB or LB + DETA NONOate.\nCollect cells for the t = 0 timepoint.\nAliquot 500 μL from each culture tube.\nFor each sample, put 200 μL into a 96-well plate and 300 μL into a microcentrifuge tube. Place the microcentrifuge tube on ice.\nPlace the culture tubes from step 1 at 37°C with rotation at 50 rpm in a rotor (or in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm), to begin incubation of the samples.\nAdd LB only (without bacterial cells) into one well of the 96-well plate to use as a blank.\nTake the 96-well plate from step 2ai. Check the OD600 of the t = 0 samples in a plate reader, using a well containing LB without bacteria as a blank. Save and record these values.",
    "Any resulting OD600 value from the blank well should be deducted from the sample values in order to get the true absorbance value.\nA typical OD600 of the t = 0 sample is ∼0.02.\nTake the entire 200 μL out of each well and transfer into the corresponding microcentrifuge tube with the other 300 μL saved on ice (this ensures there are enough bacterial cells in the samples to analyze for microscopy, especially at t = 0 and since samples will be growth arrested in the presence of NO).\nBased on the typical growth of Yptb, we estimate there to be approximately 1–5 × 107 total CFUs (colony forming units) in this 500 μL sample. 1 × 107 CFUs being on the low end for a growth arrested or 0 h timepoint sample and 5 × 107 CFUs being on the high end for a 4 h timepoint sample that is growing very well.\nFix the collected samples with 4% PFA (See preparing the working stocks[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\nCentrifuge samples in the microcentrifuge tubes at in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm (20,627 × g) for 1 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant by aspirating.\nResuspend each pellet with 200 μL of 4% PFA.\nAllow fixation 12–16 h at 4°C in the dark (or by covering tubes with aluminum foil).\nEvery 2 h, repeat steps 2 and 3 above, until 4 h.\nCheck the plate reader raw data to make sure the cells incubated in LB + DETA NONOate are growth-arrested compared to the samples grown in LB only (lower A600 nm, no change in values between t = 0 and t = 4 h). For problems, refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] section below.",
    "Incubate the culture tubes from step 1 with rotation (50 rpm in a rotor, or in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm) at 37°C for a total of 4 h.\nSummary comment: At the end of this experiment, you should have samples collected and fixed at t = 0, 2, and 4 h for both treated (LB + DETA NONOate) and untreated (LB only) groups.\nCritical: Yptb starts to recover from in vitro NO exposure around 4 h and tends to start normal growth at this timepoint. If working with other pathogens, prior growth curves with the preferred NO concentration may be needed in order to determine the length of time it takes for your pathogen of choice to recover and start normal growth after NO exposure.\nPause point: Collected cells can be fixed and incubated at 4°C for a maximum of 7 days. Prior to day 7, proceed to Major Step Two. All samples from a single biological replicate should be processed on the same day, together.\nNote: A plate reader is not necessary to measure A600. Any other means of measuring A600 will suffice, as long as an appropriate volume of sample is taken. Avoid taking large amounts of samples (>500 μL) as this will decrease the total volume left in the culture and can affect the growth of the bacteria.\nPart two: Agarose pad preparation\nTiming: ∼3 h, for three biological replicates; approximately 1 h/biological replicate/6 samples (1–7 days after NO experiment)",
    "In this step, cells that were fixed from the NO exposure experiment will be processed on microscope slides with agarose pads in preparation for the microscopy in Major Step Three. Agarose pads are used here to immobilize bacterial cells for imaging, to ensure bacterial cells have not moved between capturing images in different fluorescent channels. Otherwise, bacterial cells in liquid suspension can move (e.g., with Brownian motion), thus preparation of the agarose pads is an important step prior to imaging (Major Step Three). Please keep in mind that the agarose pad preparation is time sensitive; agarose pads will begin to evaporate and need to be used within 4 h of preparing.\nPrepare the agarose.\nDissolve 1% agarose in PBS (typically 10 mL PBS + 100 mg agarose) using a microwave.\nPlace the beaker containing the agarose solution on a heat block set at 70°C. This prevents the agarose from solidifying.\nUse the smallest volume of beaker possible, to ensure that more of the agarose solution is being heated on the heat block.\nPrepare microscope slides by adding two strips of labeling tape on top.\nThe distance between the two strips of tape should not be bigger than the width of the cover slip being utilized (see Graphical Abstract).\nFirmly press down on the strips of tape to ensure they are fully adhered to the slide.\nPlace the slides on the 70°C heat block (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for an example heat block). This ensures that the slide is warm enough for the agarose to spread on the surface.\nCut the end off of a 20–200 μL pipet tip to make a beveled edge (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2069-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Agarose pad preparation",
    "(A) The end of the pipet tip is cut off to make a beveled edge. The pipet is set to 50 μL so that approximately 20 μL will be pipetted with the beveled edge pipet tip.\n(B) Glass microscope slides are prepared with pieces of tape evenly distanced apart (such that a coverslip can lay evenly on top of the pieces of tape) and set on a hot plate. Approximately 20 μL of agarose is pipetted onto the glass slide in between the pieces of tape. A coverslip is immediately placed on top so that the agarose spreads evenly underneath the coverslip between the pieces of tape and allowed to cool for 20 min at room temperature.\n(C) After the agarose solidifies, the first coverslip can be taken off with a razor blade, in preparation for adding the fixed bacterial cells on top of the agarose pad with a fresh coverslip.\nSet the pipet volume to 50 μL (with tip cut off, this will pipet approximately 25 μL).\nPipet the 1% agarose from the beaker.\nImmediately add the agarose in between the tape strips, and immediately add the coverslip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAllow agarose to spread on the slide surface (∼3–5 s) before removing the slide from the heat block.\nLet the agarose solidify at room temperature on a bench for ∼20 min.\nUse a razor blade to peel off the coverslip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), then carefully pull off the tape strips. For problems, check out the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] section below.\nClean any excess agarose off of the slide.\nIt may be necessary to cut off the edges of the agarose pad to even out the sides. It is best to have the agarose pad as flat and even as possible.\nPrepare the fixed bacterial cells.",
    "Take out the fixed cells from the 4°C fridge.\nCentrifuge samples in a tabletop microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm (20,627 × g) for 1 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant by aspirating.\nResuspend cells in 50 μL of 1× PBS (depending on the growth of your particular bacterium, the volume used to resuspend cells can vary in order to have an optimal density of bacterial cells when imaging; see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] below).\nAdd 5–8 μL fixed bacteria (from steps 3–4) to the center of the agarose. We estimate the concentration of the fixed bacterial sample to be approximately 1–5 × 106 CFUs total.\nAdd a fresh coverslip on top.\nThe cells are now ready to image. Proceed immediately to Major Step Three.\nCritical: After adding the bacterial cells on top (after step 11e), the agarose pads can dry out after a couple of hours (∼4 h). Once prepared, microscope imaging must be done within that window. Otherwise, the agarose pad preparation steps will have to be redone. It is best to have the agarose pad as flat and even as possible. Unevenness will make it difficult to focus on the bacteria when imaging as some bacteria may be in a different plane of view.\nOptional: Fixed cells resuspended in PBS (step 11) can be kept at 4°C for a few days, in case samples need to be re-imaged.\nPart three: Microscopy and single cell analysis\nTiming: ∼2 h, depending on number of samples (imaging must be performed immediately after agarose pad preparation)",
    "In this step, samples from the NO exposure experiment will be imaged via fluorescence microscopy. Here, we will describe single cell analyses of these images to determine individual cells’ fluorescent expression; GFP expression will be constitutive and consistent across cells, while mCherry expression is dependent on the levels and length of NO exposure.\nUnder 63× oil immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture), take 5 images at distinctly different fields of view.\nFor single cell analysis specifically, it is useful to choose fields of view that already have single cells or cells that are more spread apart (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For problems, check out the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] section below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2069-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative images\n(A) Representative image of a dense area of bacterial cells. Using image analysis software, bacterial cells will be identified by their constitutive GFP signal and size. A size selection criterion of 1 μm2–6 μm2 is typically used to select for single cells. White arrows point to an aggregate of multiple bacteria (left) and two bacteria in a doublet (right), indicating bacteria that would be excluded from analysis since they are not single cells.\n(B) Representative image of an optimal density of bacterial cells. Almost all cells in this field of view, other than a few doublets, will be included in the analysis. Scale bars: 20 μm.\nWe use a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescent microscope with Colibri.2 LED light source and an ORCA-R2 digital CCD camera, but alternative fluorescent microscopes with the appropriate channels could be used.\nWith the strain used here, the DIC, GFP, and mCherry channels need to be utilized.\nUse the DIC to focus on bacterial cells. Avoid scanning and focusing using one of the fluorescent channels, since this could potentially lead to photobleaching.",
    "When capturing images, keep exposure times of the fluorescent channels consistent between samples and replicates. Exposure times we have used in the past include: 75 ms for GFP and 240 ms for mCherry. However, users need to keep in mind this is only a starting point, and they may need to use different settings.\nLook through both mCherry+ and mCherry- samples beforehand to determine optimal exposure times and minimize pixel saturation or background signal. The same mCherry and GFP exposure times need to be used for all imaging. GFP signal should be consistent throughout the samples, unless a sample has very high cell density. Higher cell density correlates with higher fluorescent signals, and is not optimal for single cell analyses (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPause point: Images can be saved and stored at this point, with the next step of single cell analysis completed at another time.\n.Perform single cell analysis using Volocity software.\nIn order to open images on Volocity software, CVI images from Zeiss software must first be converted into ZVI images.\nTo identify bacteria specifically as objects (Find Objects), use the constitutive GFP signal as a reference, and specify size range of the objects from 1 μm2 to 6 μm2, anything larger or smaller must be excluded. This highlights single cell bacteria only and excludes doublets or cells in groups (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nDIC cannot identify bacteria as objects well, and using mCherry as the reference for identifying bacterial cells as objects prevents identification of samples grown without the NO donor (no mCherry expression), or cells that had low NO exposure.",
    "It is important to have all bacteria within the field of view appropriately focused on, otherwise fluorescence values will be impacted. If the agarose pad is uneven and causing bacteria to be in different planes of view, the image can be cropped to select for only bacteria that are appropriately focused and in the same plane of view.\nRecord the mean single cell GFP and mCherry signals for each image. If you are using Volocity software (https://www.volocity4d.com/[href=https://www.volocity4d.com/]), this can be compiled using the Measurement item function, and exported into a single excel spreadsheet.\nGraph and perform further statistical analyses as needed (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nOptional: Analyses can also be performed differently, using other software such as Zen, ImageJ, or MicrobeJ. Please see an alternative method of analyzing the captured images using the free software program, MicrobeJ, below.\nThe following is an alternative method of analyzing the captured images using MicrobeJ (Ducret et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nOpen images in ImageJ/Fiji in their raw format (our images taken with Zeiss are in CZI format). This will open the ‘Bio-Formats Import Options’ tab where you can select how the image will be imported. We recommend selecting ‘split channels’ and keeping all other default options. This will split the image into the individual channels (for our images, ‘C=0’ corresponds to GFP, ‘C=1’ corresponds to mCherry, and ‘C=2’ corresponds to DIC).\nIn MicrobeJ under the ‘Images’ tab, change ‘Image’ to ‘Channel(s)’. This allows MicrobeJ to recognize each channel appropriately. We recommend assigning ‘C=1’ to ‘Ch. 1’ for mCherry and ‘C=0’ to ‘Ch.2’ for GFP. To the right of these dropdown menus, click the camera icon. This merges the images into a hyperstack and allows you to analyze all channels at once.",
    "Identify individual bacterial cells under the ‘Bacteria’ tab. In the leftmost dropdown menu, select the channel associated with GFP (Channel 2). This makes the identification of bacteria more consistent across samples since all samples will have constitutive GFP.\nImmediately to the right, in the next dropdown menu, select “Dark” instead of “Bright” to indicate that the background is darker than the objects (“Bright” is used for phase contrast images, which have a lighter background in comparison to fluorescence images).\nIn the first dropdown menu below, change ‘Medial Axis’ to ‘Fit Shape’, this should automatically switch the adjacent dropdown (fit mode) to ‘Rod-Shaped’ which is suitable for detecting Yptb cells, but other “fit modes” are available for other bacterial shapes.\nSet area (μm2) to 1–6 and click the blue play button at the bottom of this dialog box to test the current settings. Collected cells will be outlined in green and excluded cells will be outlined in red. This should select for single cell bacteria, but the area can be set differently depending on the size of your particular bacterium.\nIf the area parameters are unable to exclude some bacteria that are clumped together or in doublets, there is an ‘Experiment Editor’ function (utilized by clicking on the pencil icon located in the bottom right) that will allow you to select individual objects and exclude them from analysis. However, this function is best used only after you are ready to run all of the parameters (see step h) i. below).\nUnder the ‘Options’ box, immediately to the right, select “Intensity” to measure the mean signal intensity for each channel.\nClick the blue play button in the very bottom right corner to run all of the settings, then display the results table using the icon in the far right bottom corner.",
    "If some bacteria need to be excluded from analysis use the ‘Experiment Editor’ function and select bacteria that are in clumps or doublets and remove them using the trash can icon in the bottom right. Once finished, click the results icon at the top within the ‘Experiment Editor’ tab. This will generate a results table with only the bacteria that you want to include in the analysis. If you click the results icon within the ‘Bacteria’ tab, the bacteria you selected for exclusion with the ‘Experiment Editor’ will still be included.\nIn the ‘Result’ tab, ‘Bacteria’ should be listed and a table showing the measurements for each single bacterium should be displayed.\nTo measure the mean mCherry intensity for each cell, type the following formula into the boxes above the table “mCh int mean = bacteria.INTENSITY.ch1.mean”. This will generate a new column in the table named “mCh int mean” with the mean fluorescence intensity of mCherry for each individual bacterial cell.\nTo measure the mean GFP intensity for each cell, type the following formula into the boxes above the table “GFP int mean = bacteria.INTENSITY.ch2.mean”. This will generate a new column in the table named “GFP int mean” with the mean fluorescence intensity of GFP for each individual bacterial cell.\nRecord these values and perform further analyses as needed (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nNote: Intensity values range from 0-16383 for a 16-bit image. If the image is overexposed, all cells will have a maximum intensity value of 16383. When taking images, choose exposure times carefully to prevent pixel saturation (see step 12. c. iii).",
    "Critical: Unevenness in the agarose pad will impact analysis. MicrobeJ is sensitive to bumps in the agarose pad and will attempt to identify curvature in the agarose pad as bacteria. Additionally, MicrobeJ will be unable to identify bacteria adequately if cells are in different planes of view. To circumvent this, use ImageJ to draw a box around only the bacteria that are appropriately focused on and in the same plane of view. Only bacteria within this box will be identified and measured for fluorescence intensity."
