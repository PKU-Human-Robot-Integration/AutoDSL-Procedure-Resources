    "1.   Animal Housing and Acclimatization Procedures\nMale Long Evans rats, weighing 300-325 g at the time of arrival in the vivarium, are housed individually in standard plastic cages containing recycled paper pellet bedding, with wire grid lids to accommodate water bottles and food.\nRats are maintained on a reverse light-dark schedule (lights on 19:00 to 07:00), in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium.\nFood and water are available ad libitum in the home cages throughout the experiment.\nRats are allowed to acclimatize to the vivarium and housing conditions for one week prior to surgery. During this time rats are left undisturbed with the exception of routine cleaning, feeding, and monitoring of weight.\n2.   Intravenous Catheterization Surgery\nUnder isoflurane gas anesthesia, and using standard aseptic surgical techniques, rats are prepared with silastic catheters in the right jugular vein.  The catheter exits into a modified cannula (Plastics One) at the surface of the skull, and the cannula is mounted to the skull with jewelers' screws and dental cement.  For details of the surgical procedures, see 7, 8.\nAt the end of the surgery, catheters are flushed with approximately 0.2  mL of a solution containing 50% heparin (1000 IU) and 50% dextrose (25 g/50  mL).  A plastic blocker is placed over the opening of the cannula to protect the catheter from external debris, and to maintain catheter patency.\nAt the time of surgery, and again on the day after surgery, rats are administered 5 mg/kg, SC, of the analgesic Ketoprofen.",
    "Rats are allowed at least seven days to recover from surgery before experimentation.  During this time, rats are left undisturbed in the home cages, with the exception of routine cleaning and feeding, and daily monitoring of weight and general health.  On the last day of the recovery period, catheters are flushed with the heparin/dextrose solution (Section 2.2) to verify catheter patency.\n3.   Behavioral Procedures\nAll behavioral procedures are carried out using equipment supplied by Med Associates Inc. (St Albans, VT).  The equipment, housed in a dedicated room, includes a set of standard operant chambers, each contained within a sound-attenuating enclosure. Each operant chamber is equipped with two retractable levers, both elevated 6.5 cm above a stainless steel rod floor.  A white stimulus light is located just above one lever, and responses on that lever (the so-called \"active\" lever) result in the simultaneous illumination of the stimulus light and activation of an infusion pump (Razel Scientific Instruments, St. Albans, VT).  The pump is situated on a shelf just outside the operant chamber, but within the sound-attenuating enclosure. The other lever (the so-called \"inactive\" lever) is left extended in the chamber throughout all experimental procedures; responding on this lever is without consequence.  Finally, each chamber is equipped to deliver constant-current, intermittent, inescapable, electric footshock through a scrambler to the steel rod floor.  All experimental conditions (e.g., stimulus presentations, drug infusions, shock delivery), as well as data recording and consolidation, are accomplished via interfaces between the test chambers and a central computer operating Med Associates software (MED-IV).",
    "The experiment is carried out in 5 phases:  1) Habituation; 2) Cocaine SA; 3) Drug-free period; 4) Extinction, and 5) Testing for reinstatement. In all phases (except for the drug-free period), rats are transferred for daily sessions from the housing room to the operant test chambers.  Animals are transferred individually, in small plastic containers.  Food and water are not available in the operant chambers.\nHabituation\nTwenty-four hours preceding the first cocaine SA session (see Section 3.2.), rats are allowed to habituate to the operant chambers during a single 2-h session; during this session the active lever is retracted.\nCocaine SA training\nBefore each daily training session, rats are weighed in the housing room.  Subsequently they are transferred to the operant chambers.\nUpon being placed in the operant chambers, a spring and tubing assembly (extending from the drug infusion pump) is connected to the skull-mounted cannula.\nRats are allowed to self-administer cocaine HCl during daily 3-h sessions, for a total of 8-10 days (either consecutively or with two intervening \"days off\" between sessions 5 and 6).\nSA sessions alternate between the morning (9:00-12:00) and afternoon (13:00-16:00).  The timing of SA sessions is alternated because the procedures in subsequent phases of the experiment (i.e. extinction and testing) occur at both times of day for all animals (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5); thus, this arrangement prevents any confounding effects of the time of day on subsequent drug-seeking behavior.\nEach training session is preceded by a 5-min acclimatization period, during which animals are placed in the operant chambers with the active lever retracted.",
    "At the beginning of the training session, the active lever is extended into the chamber and the stimulus light (located above the active lever) is illuminated for 30 s.  In addition, the house light is activated at this time, and remains illuminated throughout the session.  Together, these events signal the availability of cocaine.\nDuring the session, responses on the active lever are reinforced by a 3-s infusion of cocaine (0.23 mg/65 Î¼L, i.v.) on a fixed-ratio-1 schedule of reinforcement.  Concurrent with activation of the infusion pump and drug delivery is a 20-s activation of the stimulus light above the active lever.  This 20-s light presentation corresponds to a \"time-out\" period during which additional active lever responses are recorded but not reinforced.\nAnimals are allowed a maximum of 50 infusions per 3-h session.  We routinely impose this criterion in our work and, in our experience, have found that it greatly reduces, if not eliminates, incidents of deaths due to overdose.\nAt the end of each daily session, rats' catheters are flushed with 0.2-0.3  mL of heparin-dextrose solution (see Section 2.2) and the rats are returned to their home cage.\nDrug-free period\nAfter the final cocaine SA session, rats are left undisturbed (with the exception of routine cleaning, feeding, and monitoring of weight) in their home cage for a minimum of seven days.\nExtinction of cocaine-trained behavior\nRats are transferred to the operant chambers between 09:00-10:00 for extinction training.\nThe spring and tubing assembly is connected to the skull-mounted cannula.\nConsistent with the conditions for SA training, each day of extinction training is preceded by a 5-min acclimatization period, during which animals are placed in the operant chambers with the active lever retracted.",
    "Rats are then given four 60-min extinction sessions, separated by 30-min intervals.  Each 60-min session is initiated by the same events that occur at the start of training sessions (i.e., illumination of the house light, extension of the active lever, and 30-sec illumination of the stimulus light above the active lever).  Throughout the sessions, all conditions that were present during SA training are maintained (i.e., response-contingent illumination of stimulus light for 20 sec and 3-s activation of the infusion pump), except that active lever responses are no longer reinforced with cocaine infusions.  During the 30-min intervals that separate each 60-min extinction session, the active lever is retracted and the house light is extinguished.\nAt the end of the last 60-min session, rats are returned to their home cage.\nSteps 3.4.1. to 3.4.5. are repeated for 3 consecutive days.\nReinstatement of cocaine-trained behavior by footshock stress\nRats are transferred to the operant chambers between 09:00-10:00\nUpon being placed in the operant chambers, the spring and tubing assembly is connected to the skull-mounted cannula.\nConsistent with the conditions for training and extinction, a 5-min acclimatization period is provided, during which rats are placed in the operant chambers with the active lever retracted.\nRats are then given two 60-min extinction sessions (see 3.4.4.) separated by a 30-min interval, identical to those given during the extinction phase.\nIf after the second 60-min session the total number of responses on the previously active lever is less than 15, animals are given a test for reinstatement after an additional 30-min interval.  In this 30-min interval, footshock or sham footshock (i.e., no footshock) is administered (see 3.5.6.).  If a criterion of 15 or fewer responses on the active lever is not achieved after the second session, an additional extinction session(s) is given prior to testing for reinstatement.",
    "Ten minutes after the second 60-min extinction session (or after any additional 60-min extinction session(s) required to establish the extinction criterion of 15 or fewer responses), animals are exposed to 20 min of intermittent electric footshock stress (or sham footshock) in the operant chamber.  Footshock is given during a time when the active lever is retracted and house and stimulus lights are extinguished.  Footshock is delivered according to a variable time schedule at a mean interval of 40 s (10-70 s range). Each shock is delivered at an intensity of 0.9 mA, and is 0.5 s in duration. These parameters of footshock are based on extensive pilot work carried out in our lab to establish reliable reinstatement of cocaine seeking, with the minimum intensity and duration of footshock exposure. Under these parameters, animals exhibit a reflexive jumping response to the 0.5 s shock, and occasionally emit a brief vocalization.  Although animals are observed throughout the shock period, the intensity of shock is not of sufficient magnitude to induce more pronounced signs of distress.\nImmediately following termination of the footshock session, the active lever is extended and rats are allowed to lever press under extinction conditions (i.e., responses are not reinforced with cocaine, but do continue to result in illumination of the stimulus light and activation of the infusion pump).  This period of time is defined as the test for reinstatement and is typically 1-3 hours in duration. Most responding occurs in the early part of the test session (first 30 min- 1 h), and subsequently extinguishes over more extended test periods.  Thus, a 1 h test is sufficient to capture the reinstatement effect, with longer test periods providing a more complete extinction profile of the effect.",
    "When a repeated measures design is employed, each rat is tested under footshock and sham footshock conditions. Steps 3.5.1. to 3.5.8 are repeated on a subsequent test day, and the alternate test for reinstatement (footshock or sham footshock) is administered.\n4.  Representative Results:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2265/2265fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Stylized response profiles for activity on the active and inactive levers during self-administration training, extinction, and reinstatement testing.\nFigure 1 presents stylized operant response profiles, typical of those obtained during the various phases of the experimental protocol described herein.\n1.  Active lever responses\nCocaine SA training.  Figure 1 (left panel) shows a typical cocaine SA training curve that includes both number of infusions and total number of active lever presses.  Rats generally acquire cocaine SA within 1-3 sessions and, once the behavior is established, maintain a stable rate of drug intake (typically less than 20% between-session variance) over subsequent sessions.\nExtinction of cocaine-trained behavior. It can be seen in Figure 1 (middle panel) that on Day 1 of Extinction, when responses are non-reinforced for the first time, total number of responses on the active lever is initially higher than at the end of the training phase (corresponding to a so-called \"extinction burst\"); gradually, over the four extinction sessions, responding decreases.  On Days 2 and 3 of extinction, some recovery of responding (relative to that observed during the last session of the previous day) may be observed; however, responses are generally fewer than at the start of the previous day of extinction, and extinction generally proceeds more rapidly over the four sessions for that day.",
    "Reinstatement of cocaine seeking. It can be seen in Figure 1 (right panel) that 20 min of exposure to intermittent footshock induces an increase in non-reinforced responding on the active lever, relative to that observed at the end of the preceding extinction session.  Footshock also induces an increase in responding relative to that observed under conditions in which sham footshock is administered.  Thus, the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by footshock stress can be expressed either as:  1) the increased number of non-reinforced responses after exposure to footshock, relative to responses in the extinction session before footshock or 2) the increased number of non-reinforced responses after footshock relative to sham footshock.\n2.  Inactive lever responses\nIt can be seen in Figure 1 (red line) that, throughout all experimental phases, there are very low response levels associated with the inactive lever.  However, a modest increase in responding on this lever is sometimes observed following exposure to footshock stress. Even in cases in which such an increase in responding occurs, the increase in active lever responding tends to be proportionately much greater."
