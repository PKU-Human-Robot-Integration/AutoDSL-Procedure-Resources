    "1. Exploring factors containing a gene of interest\nOpen a web browser and go to http://corex.isi.edu, the CorExplorer home page.\nOn the right side under Quick Links, click on the + expand button next to Ovarian (TCGA-OV) to see a summary of the CorEx factor graph that was trained on the TCGA ovarian cancer data (shown in Figure 1). Optionally, click on others to compare.\nOnce finished inspecting the factor graphs, click on Lung (TCGA-LUAD) to access the CorExplorer page for lung cancer RNA-seq.\n\t\nExplore the CorEx factor graph for a gene of interest using the CorExplorer ‘Factor Graph’ window.\n\t\t\nMove the mouse cursor over the factor graph display window. Zoom into the factor graph using the mouse scroll wheel or trackpad to see details of the graph such as the most important genes in each factor and the connections between nodes at different layers. Alternatively, click and drag to move the view area or any node.\nTo find a target gene (here we'll use BRCA1), click on the Gene dropdown menu at the top of the factor graph window. Type ‘BRCA1’ to select it in the dropdown list and press Return to make the view zoom to factor 26, the factor with which BRCA1 is most strongly correlated.\nReposition the mouse over the graph display and scroll to zoom out to see the Level 2 node, L2_8, and its associated factors that are neighbors to factor 26. Note that only genes with weight greater than the threshold indicated on the Min link weight slider are shown.\nTo see all of the genes associated with the factor, click on the L1_26 node and select Load additional genes in the pop-up window. When the word ‘Done’ appears, close the pop-up window.",
    "Now go back to the header section above the factor graph window and grab and drag the Min link weight modifier. Now, as the link weight slider is moved down to 0.05, other genes in factor L1_26, including BRCA2, will appear in weight order. Optionally, reposition nodes by grabbing and dragging to improve layout.\nDetermine how stratification of patients with respect to the factor affects survival by querying in the survival window.\n\t\t\nIn the survival window, uncheck Sort by p-val, then select factor 26 in the Single Factor dropdown menu in order to show survival curves for factor 26.\nScroll down the survival graph to show the number of patients at risk along the x-axis.\nFind associations with biological function by querying within the Annotation window.\n\t\t\nIn the annotation window, to sort the Factor dropdown menu by factor number rather than False Discovery Rate (FDR), uncheck FDR sort.\nScroll and click to select factor 26 in the annotation window dropdown to show enrichment annotations for the factor.\nScroll down the annotation list until DNA repair is visible and click on it to immediately see associated genes highlighted in yellow on the graph display. See the middle panel of Figure 2.\nNote that factors disappear or appear as different GO terms are selected, according to whether or not they are enriched for genes with the selected annotation, e.g. ‘intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage.’\nExplore the factors further by adding windows with different functionality.\n\t\t\nFrom the top menu bar, add a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) window by selecting PPI from the Add Window dropdown, then click the Add button to add a PPI graph window to the display area. In the PPI graph window, choose factor ‘Layer1: 26’ to show the protein-protein interactions. Note the density of connections.",
    "From top menu bar, instead of PPI, select Heatmap from the Add Window dropdown, then click the Add button to add a heatmap window to the display area. In the heatmap window, choose factor ‘Layer1: 26’ to show the gene expression patterns.\nGrab and reposition the heatmap window so that the survival window is also visible. Along the top of the heatmap, observe how the orange/blue/grey colored bar corresponds to patient risk strata on survival graph. Results are shown in the bottom of Figure 2.\n2. Filtering and interpreting CorEx factors using gene weight, survival, and annotation data\nFilter for factors of interest using survival and cluster quality.\n\t\nFrom the Dataset dropdown menu at the top, select TCGA_OVCA to go to the CorExplorer page for the TCGA ovarian cancer RNA-seq.\nOnce the page has loaded, note from the survival window that the factor with the largest survival differential for different strata is 114.\nAt the top of the factor graph window select ‘Layer1: 114’ from the Factor dropdown.\nGrab the link weight slider with the mouse and move it up to 0.5. Note that the large number of genes in factor 114 (1609), with none having weight >0.35, indicates a relatively weak clustering.\nNext, expand the list of factors in the survival window and select the next best factor in the survival window dropdown, factor 39, to show its associated survival curves.\nSelect factor 39 in the annotation window by clicking on it. The significant GO and KEGG annotations are shown.\nTo gain a better understanding of the biological role of genes in factor 39, interpret the factors using neighborhood annotation information as follows.",
    "At the top of the factor graph window, select factor ‘Layer1: 39’ in the factor dropdown. Then, move the mouse over the factor graph window and zoom out to reveal the entire L2_14 cluster with 6 factors: 14, 32, 39, 42, 52, and 82 (shown in Figure 3).\nTo understand the relative significance of the factors linked to the L2_14 node, start by viewing survival differentials for each of the L2_14 factors. Uncheck Sort by p-val in the survival window and then click on each of the factor numbers in succession. Doing this, note that only factors 14, 32, and 39 display a survival association.\nNow from the top menu bar, select PPI from the Add Window dropdown once again. Press Add to add a PPI graph window to the display area. In the PPI graph window, select factor ‘Layer1: 52’ to show the protein-protein interactions that are significant. An example layout of windows at this point is shown in Figure 3.\nClick the View at StringDB link at the bottom of the PPI window to link out to the StringDB online database. Click Continue from the first screen, then select the Analysis tab below the network graph as before to get an online GO analysis for the PPI network genes. The top cellular component is ‘MHC class II protein complex.’\nReturn to the CorExplorer tab and PPI window and select factor 32, this time from the factor dropdown. Click the link View at StringDB out to the StringDB analysis. The top cellular component is ‘MHC class I protein complex,’ in contrast to class II for factor 52 in the previous step!",
    "Finally, go back to the PPI window and select ‘Layer1: 39’ from the factor dropdown menu at the top. Click the link View at StringDB to link out to the StringDB analysis.\nClick Continue from the first screen, then select the Analysis tab below the network graph to get an online GO analysis for the PPI network genes. Observe that the top molecular function is ‘CXCR3 chemokine receptor binding.’\n3. Using survival and database annotations to look for promising therapeutic combinations\nSwitch to the TCGA melanoma CorExplorer by selecting TCGA_SKCM from the Dataset dropdown menu.\nNote that the factor with the largest survival differential is factor 171. Examine the factor 171 annotations by scrolling and note that ‘immune response’ and ‘cytokine-mediated signaling pathway’ are near the top (as they were for the top ovarian factor).\nTo find a complementary factor, examine the top survival-associated factors along with their top annotation terms. To do this, click on the Dataset overview link in the top menu bar to open a separate tab containing a table with dataset processing details as well as a summary of top factors according to p-value of the survival differential. Note that the first non-immune factor is 88.\nReturn to the TCGA_SKCM browser tab.\nSelect factor 88 in the survival, annotation, and graph windows. The top several GO terms are related to ‘rRNA processing’ and ‘mitochondrion organization,’ confirming it as distinct from the immune-related factors.\nIn the survival window, on the paired factors dropdown, select ‘88_171’ to see how survival is improved for patients in the middle stratum for the combined 171 and 88 expression factors. Annotation and survival comparisons are illustrated in Figure 4.\n4. Finding commonalities and differences of gene expression variation across tumor types using the Search page",
    "Click on the CorExplorer heading to return to the front page.\nClick on Search on the top menu bar to go to a page allowing searching over all the datasets on the CorExplorer site.\nIn the Gene search box, enter ‘FLT1’ (VEGFR1) and hit Return or press Search. FLT1 is found with a relatively high weight in the following factors: OVCA - 76, LUAD - 162, SKCM - 195 and SKCM - 184, as well as COAD - 112 and COAD - 74.\nAlternatively, search for a related GO term across all the datasets. Try this in the ‘GO Search’ box by typing ‘angiogenesis’ and hitting Return or pressing Search. All FLT1 factors, with the exception of SKCM-195, are listed as statistically enriched for ‘angiogenesis’ genes–factor 195 does, in fact, have the annotation, but below the default 10-8 threshold. Search results for this and the prior step are shown in Figure 5.\nAs further examples, in the GO search box, first type ‘epidermal growth factor receptor.’ Only LUAD is enriched for this term, a well-known stratification factor for lung cancer. Next, type ‘mesenchymal’ in the search box. This term is enriched in gene expression groups for OVCA, where it is a well-studied stratification factor."
