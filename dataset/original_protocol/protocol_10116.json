    "All testing conducted with mice was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Duke University. Personnel responsible for testing and scoring must be blinded to animal genotype or experimental condition until gait analysis and scoring of papers has been completed for the entire cohort.\n1. Testing material preparation\nConduct testing with a tunnel built from 3 pre-cut clear acrylic panels that are 0.375 inches thick. Assemble tunnel by gluing panels together with a sealant that specifically bonds acrylic and will not emit odors when dried.\n\t\nFor standard C57BL/6 mice, use the following tunnel measurements: 2.5 in. wide, 3 in. high, and 13 in. long. Mice must be able to comfortably walk through the tunnel and take enough steps (>4) so that gait can be measured.\nConstruct the goal chamber with pre-cut gray acrylic panels 0.375 inches thick, glued together with the same sealant as used on the tunnel. The interior measurements of the chamber are 4 in. wide, 4 in. long, and 3 in. tall. Match the opening of this chamber to the opening of the tunnel (2.5 in. wide x 3.0 in. tall). Because the mice naturally prefer darkened spaces to well-lit spaces, use material that is opaque and dark in color.\nUse paper for tracking steps that is thick and smooth (watercolor paper works well). Cut individual papers strips to be slightly wider and longer than the width and length of the tunnel. If using the tunnel dimensions described here, cut papers to 15 in. long by 3.5 in. wide.\nUse two contrasting colors (e.g., green and purple) of non-toxic washable water-based paint. Assign one color for hind-limbs, the second one for forelimbs. Mice will lick the remaining paint from their feet after testing, so the selected paint must be completely non-toxic.",
    "Use two round barrel paintbrushes, one for each paint color (~0.5 cm in diameter, tapered/pointed brush tip).\nSelect a ruler with markings down to millimeters, and a caliper with measurements down to 0.1 mm. Pencil is recommended to write on the scoring papers.\nOptional: For animals with high anxiety or low motivation, provide a behavioral incentive in the goal chamber. This can include small amounts of sterilized sunflower seeds (placed in the home cage 2 days prior to testing to allow habituation). On the day of testing, place sunflower seeds inside the goal chamber to encourage mice to walk through without stopping.\n2. Data collection\nIf testing is performed in a separate room, acclimate the mice to the new room for 30 minutes and then start the behavioral assays. Additionally, because mice are naturally nocturnal, ensure all mice are fully awake and alert for at least 5 minutes before testing.\nPrepare the testing setup by positioning the tunnel over the paper and marking the paper with mouse ID and testing date. Position the goal chamber at the end of the tunnel, connecting both open ends. Add sunflower seeds at the end of the tunnel (inside the goal chamber) for motivation if needed.\nRemove the mouse to be tested from its cage and grip it firmly by its scruff, making sure to grip the tail to stabilize movement of its hind limbs.\nPaint forepaws so the entire underside of all toes and the center of the foot are fully covered in paint. Repeat this with a contrasting color of paint on its hind paws. Wipe off any paint that the mouse gets on other parts of its body with a clean damp cloth to prevent smudges that may interfere with data collection.",
    "NOTE: Mouse handling must be performed by experienced researchers to minimize animal stress.\nPlace the mouse at the start of the tunnel and allow it to walk all the way into the goal chamber, and then retrieve the mouse, gently wipe off its feet with a water-dampened cloth, and return it to its home cage.\nAllow paper with footprints to dry fully before scoring. Wipe down the testing area and tunnel with ethanol or an equivalent cleaning solution in between each animal.\n3. Scoring criteria\nUse steps that are consistently spaced with clear, non-smudged footprints for scoring. Figure 1B is a good example of a footprint sequence that can be scored. In order to generate sufficient scoring data, there must be at least 2 consecutive steps from each foot, but 4-6 steps per foot is recommended. Do not include the first and last footprints on the paper, as they are unlikely to represent normal gait because the mouse is changing its walking speed.\nUse stride length, stride width, and toe spread as three different measures of gait that can be analyzed using this method.\n\tNOTE: Stride length and width require clear sequential prints where the forefoot region is well defined in paint. Toe spread does not require sequential prints for scoring, only clear prints of the first and last toes on a single foot. However, if a given footprint is not included in measurements of stride length or width, it cannot not be scored for toe spread. All three measures are assessed in centimeters.\n\t\nDefine stride length as the distance between two sequential footprints created by the same foot (i.e., one stride) (Figure 1A, 1B).",
    "With a pencil, draw a 2-4 mm circle around the fore-foot region of both forelimb footprints (identified by assigned color above) in a single stride and draw a line between them using a ruler.\nRecord the distance between two prints from the middle of each circle (i.e. center of each foot pad) as Right-Fore 1 (RF1) or Left-Fore 1 (LF1).\nRepeat for all steps that can be scored (RF2, LF2, RF3, LF3 and so on).\nRepeat for right and left hind-limb footprints.\nAverage all individual recorded stride distances for each limb. For statistical analysis, individual cohort members can be averaged together.\nDefine stride width as the measure of distance between left and right forelimbs or hind-limbs (Figure 1A, 1B).\n\t\t\nTo assess this distance, draw and measure a line from the circled forefoot region of one hind-limb that intersects perpendicularly with the line for stride length on the contralateral hind-limb.\nRepeat this for all hind-limb prints that can be scored, and then average the measurements. The method of calculation for stride width is the same for fore- and hind-limbs.\nDefine toe spread as the distance between the first and last toes on a single fore- or hind-limb footprint (Figure 1A, 1B).\n\t\t\nUse calipers to measure the distance between the tip of the first toe print and the tip of the last toe print.\nRepeat for all hind-limb prints that can be scored and average the measurements. The method of calculation for toe spread is the same for fore- and hind-limbs.\nIf the paper cannot be scored, allow the animal to rest for 10 minutes before trying again.\nSubscription Required.
