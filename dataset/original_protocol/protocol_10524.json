    "NOTE: All animal surgeries were approved by the local veterinary staff and animal use committee prior to commencing the experiments.\n1. Preparation of Electrospun Polycaprolactone Scaffolds\nWeigh and dissolve medical grade ester terminated poly (ε-caprolactone) in granule form in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol to create a 10% w/w solution of the PCL polymer. Let the solution stir using a stir plate for at least 3 hr to ensure a homogenous solution.\nElectrospin the PCL solution to create a cuff of highly aligned PCL fibers for scaffold fabrication.\n\t\nPrepare the electrospinning setup in a chemical fume hood with the fan on at all times. This consists of a large acrylic box that will serve as an isolated vacuum medium for the electrospinning process and has entry points for the source PCL solution driven by a voltage source, the motor-powered collecting mandrel, and a vacuum port. Clean the acrylic box thoroughly with ethanol and cover all surfaces with Parafilm sheets to remove any impurities that may compromise the quality of the electrospun product.\nLoad approximately 3 ml of the above solution into a 10 ml syringe with a blunt ended 18 G, 1 ½ inch needle. Remove any air bubbles by pushing the syringe up. Lock solution into a programmable syringe pump. Insert the needle through a small hole into the acrylic box while leaving about ½ inch of the needle outside of the acrylic box for attachment of the voltage source wire.\nUse a 30 mm rotating lathe mandrel as the collector for the highly aligned PCL fibers; cover the mandrel tightly with a thin strip of aluminum foil. Lock the mandrel into the motor on the opposite side of the box about 15 cm away from the syringe needle.",
    "Insert the plastic hose into the vacuum port and connect to the fume hood vacuum source. Turn on the vacuum source and cover the acrylic box with a lid.\nSet the infusion rate of the programmable syringe pump to 2.5 ml/hr. Turn on the motor to operate the mandrel at 3,450 rpm and attach the positive lead of the voltage source to the needle tip outside of the box using an alligator clip.\nOnce infusion of the PCL solution has begun, turn on the voltage source and set to a 20 kV operating voltage.\nInfuse the solution for 12 min to create a homogenous cuff from 0.5 ml of the PCL solution.\n\t\tNOTE: On average, each cuff has enough electrospun material to create two six-strip sheets, which can be used to create a total of three four-layered scaffolds.\nLaser cut the PCL cuff to form multiple small sheets on a VersaLaser Cutter 2.3 operated at low-vacuum setting, 10.0 keV landing voltage, 6.4 mm working distance, and probe diameter of 3.0.\n\tNOTE: In this example, a computer aided design was used to instruct the cutter to yield multiple sheets of 1.5 mm x 35 mm x 150 µm scaffolds with evenly distributed 150 µm diameter holes at 15% pore area.\nPlasma etch the PCL scaffolds using a plasma cleaner to induce hydrophilicity of the PCL surface with ion acceleration. Set the vacuum to 450 mTorr and the treat the scaffolds for 30 sec at high power (29.6 W).\nBathe the scaffolds in 70% ethanol in a sterile environment.\nCoat the individual scaffolds with collagen to facilitate cellular adhesion and proliferation in vivo.",
    "Create a collagen coating solution by diluting a 8:1:2.5 sterile solution of Purecol collagen 3 mg/ml standard solution, 10x PBS and 0.1 N NaOH 1:9 in 1x PBS at 4 °C. Mix thoroughly to ensure solution homogeneity.\nCoat individual 1.5 mm x 35 mm x 150 µm scaffolds with a thin layer film of the above collagen solution. Allow to dry for 24 hr in a sterile environment.\nUsing 5-0 Vicryl sutures, stack and affix four individual 1.5 mm x 35 mm x 150 µm scaffolds using a Krackow stitch to create a final 0.6 mm thick, multi-layered, collagen-coated scaffold that is ready for implantation.\n2. Rat Surgery Protocol\nInduce anesthesia by placing rat in inhalation chamber and delivering 2% isoflurane with 2 L/min oxygen. Confirm the rat is adequately anesthetized by applying pressure to hind foot and evaluating for any response.\nOn the non-sterile back table, subcutaneously inject 25 mg/kg ampicillin and 0.03 mg/kg buprenorphine.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes. Clip the fur from the operative hind limb and prep the surgical site with three alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine and 70% ethanol.\nTransfer the rat to the operating table, on a heated pad to prevent hypothermia. Secure nose cone, and maintain anesthesia through the procedure with 2% isoflurane in 2 L/min oxygen, delivered nose cone. Drape in a sterile manner, leaving the operative limb exposed. \nBefore starting the surgery, first confirm adequate anesthetization by lack of a response to hind foot pressure.\nMake a 2 cm long vertical incision medial to the knee, centered at the level of the patella. Retract the skin laterally until the incision is centered over the knee.",
    "Use a scalpel to make a medial parapatellar arthrotomy by cutting just medial to the patella and extending proximally to the level of the musculotendinous junction of the quadriceps and distally to the level of the patellar tendon insertion on the tibial tubercule. Take care not to cut the patellar or quadriceps tendons.\nRelease patella laterally by making a 1 cm vertical incision through the knee capsule just lateral to the patellar tendon.\nEnsure the knee is extended. Take a pair of fine scissors and pass under the patella from lateral to medial. Spread the scissors a couple times so that the extensor mechanism can be translated to either side.\nWhile flexing the knee, translate the patella laterally to expose the inside of the knee joint. Ensure clear visualization of the intercondylar notch and femoral condyles. Using a scalpel, transect the ACL and PCL in the notch.\nLoad power drill with a 1.6 mm k-wire. Place k-wire tip on ACL origin in the intercondylar notch. Drill superolaterally and visualize the exit point on the lateral aspect of the femur, removing any soft tissue as necessary with a scalpel. Pass the k-wire in and out a few times to ensure clear passage for the graft.\nPlace the k-wire on the ACL footprint on the tibial plateau. Drill anterolaterally and visualize exit point on the anterolateral proximal tibia. Use scalpel to clear soft tissue as necessary so that the point where the k-wire exits the tibia is fully visualized.\nPass a shortened Keith needle (ideally no more than 2 inches long) through the femoral bone tunnel. Thread the two suture ends from one end of the graft through the eye of the Keith needle. Use the needle to pull one end of the graft through the femoral tunnel.",
    "Repeat the prior step to pass the other end of the graft through the tibial tunnel.\nUse 4-0 Vicryl suture to affix the femoral end of the graft to surrounding periosteum or other soft tissue with a figure-of-eight stitch. Manually tension the graft with the knee in extension. Affix the tibial end of the graft to surrounding periosteum or other soft tissue with a figure-of-eight stitch.\nUse a scissor to cut off excess graft on both ends, leaving 1-2 mm on each end past the figure-of-eight stitch.\nExtend the knee and reduce the patella. Using 4-0 vicryl, place a single figure-of-eight stitch to close the medial joint capsule, preventing lateral subluxation of the patella.\nClose the skin with a running subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl or Vicryl suture, with care not to suture the underlying muscle or have any visible suture once the skin is closed.\nInject rats subcutaneously with buprenorphine every 12 hr for a total of three days postoperatively. Check surgical site for any drainage or wound dehiscence at the time of injection. Limping and some swelling are normal in the first few days after surgery, but promptly address any postoperative concerns in conjunction with veterinary staff.  The animal may be return to social housing at 2 weeks postoperatively, when surgical incisions are completely healed.\n3. Data Collection Protocol\nAt the time of sacrifice, asphyxiate rats individually in a closed CO2 chamber followed by thoracotomy.\nHarvest both the surgically reconstructed and contralateral limbs by separating at the hip joint.\n\t\nFor the reconstructed limbs, remove all soft tissue, including the posterior cruciate ligament and the remnants from the surgically disrupted native ACL, by fine dissection to isolate only the femur, tibia, and graft.",
    "For the contralateral limbs, remove all soft tissue except the native ACL as well as the femur and tibia by fine dissection.\nUse a rotary tool such as Dremel, to remove all but ¾ to 1 cm of bone from each end of the femur-graft-tibia complex.\nDuring this process and throughout biomechanical testing, regularly and frequently spray the ligamentous regions with normal saline to prevent desiccation of the harvested knee which may falsely alter results.\nFor histological analysis, fix each knee individually in 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 25 °C for 48 hr. Next, submerge the knee in a solution of Immunocal reagent for complete decalcification; this process is dependent on the calcific contents of the sample and may take up to five days. Check individual samples daily to assess progress as incomplete decalcification can lower sample quality. Once complete, perform sectioning, slide mounting, and staining as desired.\nPerform biomechanical testing to assess the functional capacity of the tissue engineered ligament.\n\t\nSecure the femur and tibia by wrapping 28 G galvanized steel wire around the epiphysis of each bone separately. This is to prevent inaccurate biomechanical testing data from premature tensile failure of the sample at the bone rather than at the ligament of interest.\nPot the femur into a mixture of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement. To do this, mix the two cement components and immediately use the viscous mixture to secure the femur into the metal, completely encasing the diaphysis of the bone in the cemented pot with the epiphysis and attached ligament protruding freely. Allow spontaneous free radical polymerization to gradually transform the mixed viscous components to a doughy material and eventually into a solid hardened matrix.",
    "NOTE: This process takes several minutes and can be monitored by manually assessing the temperature of a bolus made from the remaining cement; the temperature should transiently increase during the exothermic polymerization reaction and subside to RT after the material solidifies.\nRepeat the same process above for cementing the tibia, except while maintaining the knee ligament at 20° flexion for ideal mechanical testing.\nMount the cemented femur-graft-tibia complex onto a tensile testing apparatus, and prepare to record load and displacement as a function of time from the beginning of tension to failure. In this example, we used an Instron Model 5564 with a 1 kN load cell.\nPre-tension the graft to 2 N at a ramp rate of 0.5 N/min and then test the graft to failure at a strain rate of 0.5 mm/sec. During the process, be sure that the ligament is failing at the mid-substance and that the bony femur and tibia are secure and not prematurely failing, which may inaccurately assess biomechanical properties of the tested ligament.\nUse the generated load-displacement curves to compute the failure load and stiffness of the tested ligament.\nSubscription Required.
