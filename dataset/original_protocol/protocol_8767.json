    "Research on Drosophila melanogaster was in compliance with the University of Alberta’s research guidelines.\n1. Fly Collection\nCollect 20 flies using CO2 (g) anesthetization and place in a 25 mm x 95 mm collection vial containing food.\nStore vials containing flies horizontally to avoid trapping flies in any liquids that may accumulate in the bottom the vial.\nIncubate flies for at least 21 hr at 22 °C at 45% humidity in an incubator for approximately for 15 hr. Set the incubator with a 12 hr light : dark cycle.\n2. Climbing Assay\nThe following morning, transfer 20 flies from a single vial into a 250 ml glass graduated cylinder. Mark the position of the cylinder to keep it constant everyday. Use one glass cylinder per genotype to prevent cross contamination between the genotypes. Wash at the end of each experiment and rotate them between genotypes.\n\t\nConduct the experiments in ambient light (or red light if there is a potential defect in vision) at temperature and humidity of 22 °C and 40% respectively. To avoid circadian rhythm confound, always perform experiments at the same time of day.\nSeal the top of cylinder with a barrier film (wax film) to prevent the escape of any flies (Figure 2).\nSet up the video camera on a tripod. Focus camera on the 190 ml line of the 250 ml graduated cylinder (17.5 cm).\nCount the number of dead flies at the bottom of the cylinder and in the food vials. Record this number as the mortality.\nVery lightly tap the cylinder against a closed cell foam pad repeatedly with enough force to displace the flies to the inner bottom surface. Tap 5 - 10 times while using the other hand to press record on the camera.\nPress the “Record” button on the camera.",
    "Start the video camera recording and tap the cylinder six times in a distinct non-rhythmic pattern.\nConduct each trial for 2 min from the time the flies are last tapped and record the number of flies crossing the height of 17.5 cm (190 ml) at each time point chosen (quantify every 10 sec). Note: The ml marking on the cylinder will vary from one cylinder model to another depending on diameter. To avoid error, measure the height on each cylinder used.\nOnce the trial has ended, dispose of flies in 95% ethanol.\nRepeat steps 2.1 to 2.9 until all the replicates have been tested with fresh flies every time.\n\tNote: Although 5 replicates may be enough with a mutation having a strong effect on locomotion, 10 biological replicates of 20 flies (200 flies) is recommended to detect smaller differences.\nUpon completion of the experiment, wash the cylinders in the lab dishwasher and dry O/N to be re-used.\n3. Analysis\nAnalyze videos of each fly trial. Each 10 sec, record the total number of flies that pass the target line.\n\t\nIf a fly climbs back down or falls, record that fly as -1 and count the next fly to cross the target line as the same number as the fly that climbed back down or fell. For example, if the 15th fly falls below the target line, the next fly to cross the line (the 16th fly) is considered the 15th fly and not the 16th.\nSubtract the mortality from the total number of flies (20) to obtain the number of flies that remain in the trial. At each time point, obtain the fraction of flies above the target line.\nPlot each percentage at each time point (see Figure 3).",
    "Analyze the performance at the 120 sec data point and perform student t-test when 2 groups are present or ANOVA and a post-test for multiple comparisons (with Bonferroni modification for planned and Tukey for unplanned comparisons). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests17 is also performed to ascertain normality and equal variance but also to compare the distributions of the mutant group to the control.\nTo present the data over aging, plot the percentage of flies climbing at 120 sec with flies of different ages (2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks) to see if there is a progressive deficit (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
