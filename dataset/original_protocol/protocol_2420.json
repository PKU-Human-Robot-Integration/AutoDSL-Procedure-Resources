It usually takes 3–4 days post seeding till organoids reach proper size and 70%–80% confluency (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2056-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Collection and digestion of genetically modified organoids\n(A) Representative scheme summarizing the multistep process of preparation and digestion of genetically modified organoids prior to transplantation.\n(B) Representative microscopic images of ∼70% confluent APTKA organoids prior to collection and Accutase-dissociated organoids resuspended in 20% Matrigel/PBS. Scale bars represent 200 μm.\n3–4 days post seeding, carefully aspirate the culture medium of APTKA or APTK organoids.\nTo depolymerize the BME, add 1 mL Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) to each well.\nWith a 1 mL pipet tip, mechanically disrupt the organoids BME drops into smaller clusters of cells by pipetting up and down.\nIn a 15 mL falcon tube, pool 4 wells of organoids embedded in 800 μL BME and pipette up and down 12 times using a 1 mL pipet tip. Incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nAdd 4 mL PBS and centrifuge at 120 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nFor further dissociation, after centrifugation, remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL pre-warmed Accutase cell dissociation reagent by pipetting up and down with a 1 mL pipet tip for 12 times.\nIncubate the disrupted organoids in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min.\nTo obtain a homogenous cell suspension, further disrupt the organoids for a final time by pipetting up and down for 12 times using 1 mL pipet tip. Pool the organoids in one 15 mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 188 g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 8 mL Ad-DF+++ and centrifuge at 188 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 8 mL PBS and centrifuge at 188 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend organoids in diluted 20% Matrigel-PBS solution and keep the solution on ice until transplantation.\nNote: The final concentration of the cell suspension should correspond to 1–2 × 106 single cells per 100 μL, however, it is not necessary to completely digest organoids into single cells because long digestion times may lead to cell death. The number is an approximation and serves as guidance. We observed that cell clusters engraft as well as single cells.\nCritical: Healthy organoids of 70%–80% confluency should be used, typically 3–4 days post seeding and overgrown confluent organoids should be avoided (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: To avoid cells aggregation and clumps, pipette up and down the prepared cells suspension or flick the tube before intralumenal transplantation (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Resuspension of the cells in diluted 20% Matrigel-PBS solution is essential as cells resuspended only in PBS solution will not be successfully transplanted. Post-organoids preparation, directly proceed into intralumenal transplantation to avoid organoids death.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Orthotopic transplantation of organoids, related to steps 12–18\nOrthotopic transplantation of organoids\nTiming: 5–10 min per mouse\nTaking advantages of the previously published dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) endoluminal protocol (O'Rourke et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), we perform intrarectal injections of prepared organoids 2 days after termination of DSS administration (experimental day 7) on anesthetized mice.\nApply a small amount of eye ointment Bepanthen on the mouse eyes to protect the cornea.",
    "Prior to transplantation, anesthetize mice with 2% isoflurane and gently flush the colon with minimum volume of 20°C–25°C PBS (∼ 200 μL) for emptying luminal fecal contents.\nTo proceed into organoids transplantation, anesthetize mice with intraperitoneal injection of Anesthesia solution: 10 μL/g of mouse.\nOptional: Intraluminal transplantation can be performed under isoflurane, yet transplantation works better when mice are allowed to sleep longer.\nSee Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nCool down the catheter on ice and keep it cold during the procedure.\nKeeping the mouse in prone position, gently insert the cold catheter at 2 cm depth into the colon and infuse 100 μL of cells dissolved in 20% Matrigel-PBS.\nNote: For a smooth intrarectal injection, the catheter tip can be sparingly coated with Vaseline.\nOptional: For intrarectal injections, 200 μL pipet tip can be used instead of the catheter.\nTo prevent leakage of luminal content, immediately seal the anus with Vaseline.\nOptional: To seal the anus, tissue adhesive can be used instead of Vaseline, but it must be removed after about 4–6 h post transplantation.\nAllow the mouse to recover under red lamp or use hot water blanket, warm fluid bag or gloves filled with warm water.\nTumor imaging and monitoring\nTiming: 5–10 min per mouse\nDetermine progression of endoluminal tumor growth and evaluate tumor size weekly starting around 3 weeks post-transplantation using the small animal endoscopy system (Karl Storz Endoscope, El Segundo, CA, USA) on mice under Ketamine/Xylazine anesthesia. Assess tumor volume (mm3) per animal by measuring the longest and shortest diameter of the visible rectal tumor. Successful transplantation will lead to a single distal tumor per mouse at a maximum depth of 2 cm from the anus.\nAnesthetize mice with Anesthesia solution (10 μL/g of mouse) and apply eye ointment on the mouse eyes to protect the cornea.",
    "See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nTo remove luminal fecal content, flush the colon with 20°C–25°C PBS (2 mL).\nGrasp the camera head in a manner that will allow you to cover the port opposite the air infusion intake with a finger to insufflate the colon as the telescope is inserted (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: Alternatively, set an appropriate flow rate for the air pump and close the port that you would cover with your thumb.\nCritical: The flow rate should be ∼2 to 3 bubbles per second when the endoscope is inserted into a 50 mL conical tube of H2O.\nKeep the mouse in prone position, with one hand hold the dorsal fur and with the other hand carefully insert the HOPKINS telescope (1.9 mm outer diameter, length 10 cm; Karl Storz) covered with an endoscopic sheath into the rectum up to 2 cm depth.\nKeep the colon inflated and start recording as you slowly withdraw the endoscope. Distal and richly vascularized endoscopic lesions, 3–6 weeks post-transplantation, confirm successful engraftment and tumor growth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2056-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Methods video S2. Tumor imaging and monitoring, related to steps 19–24\nImage-guided radiotherapy using the small animal radiation research platform (SARRP)\nTiming: 2–5 min per mouse\nThe small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) provides a combined use of a precisely aligned defined beam and a volumetric treatment-time imaging system (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We irradiate tumors that reached required size (∼2/3 of lumen). If the tumors had not reached the required size, we perform another colonoscopy few days later. All tumors grow to the required size between 3–6 weeks after orthotopic transplantation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2056-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bars represent 200 μm.\nAnesthetize mice with 1.5% isoflurane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPrepare a 2 mm-diameter PVC probe with an endoluminal 1 mm-diameter radiopaque line to insert intrarectally and advance its tip up to the lower margin of the rectal cancer, based on the endoscopy measurements described above (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Acquire onboard cone-beam computer tomography (CBCT) images (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C–3F) by rotating the mouse between the stationary x-ray source and a 2-dimensional digital flat-panel detector in a horizontal setup applying a tube voltage of 60 kVp, 0.8 mA and 720 projections acquired over 360°. CBCT acquisition is referred to as ‘RT planning CBCT image’.\nReconstitute CBCT images using SARRP’s MuriSlice™ software reconstruction algorithm to 0.16 mm isotropic voxels and transfer RT planning CBT images to Muriplan™ treatment planning software (SARRP, Xstrahl, Surrey, UK).\nPerform segmentation (definition of grey values for each tissue type: air, lung, tissue, fat and bone) and contouring of the target region and organs at risk.\nPlan irradiation dose and its associated collimator, gantry and couch angles based on the isocenter (defined by the tumor diameter, and distance between lower tumor margin and anus) which is used to define the center of rotation for administration of either a vertical beam or a conical arc, operated at a 60-degree oblique angle.\nTo verify treatment planning compute isodose lines (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D–3F) and a dose volume histogram (DVH).\nExecute radiotherapy (RT) planning with fractionated single doses of 2.0 Gy using a 10-mm collimated arc beam operating at 220 kVp, 13 mA applied five times a week to reach a total dose of 10 Gy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G)."
