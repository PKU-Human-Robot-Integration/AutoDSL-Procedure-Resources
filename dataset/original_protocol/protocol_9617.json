    "The European directive 20170/63/EU for the care and use of laboratory animals was adhered to and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Valencia (Law 86/609/EEC and 214/1997 and Code 2018/VSC/PEA/0122 Type 2 of the Government of Valencia, Spain).\n1. Tracheal decellularization\nNOTE: The decellularization method has been reported elsewhere20.\nEuthanize donor male adult New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) weighing 3.5-4.1 kg with 133 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium, using a 200 mg/mL injection through the marginal ear vein.\nWhile ensuring aseptic conditions, perform a central longitudinal cervicotomy, dissect the cervical muscles, and approach the trachea. Dissect the organ circumferentially and longitudinally. Finally, transect under the first ring and just above the carina.\nWith a scalpel, section the tracheas into 2 cm pieces. With scissors, remove the surrounding connective tissue and inner mucosa layer6.\nSubmerge the specimens in 12 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5% penicillin-streptomycin, and 5% amphotericin B.\nSubject the tracheas to constant stirring with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 5 weeks at room temperature. Replace the decellularization solution weekly after a 2 h osmotic shock, by means of immersion of the trachea in distilled water.\nCryogenize the specimens using a 12 mL mixture of 80% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a freezing container at -80 °C.\nWhen the tracheas are going to be used (after 13-15 days), thaw them in a water bath at 37 °C and wash them by submerging them in PBS after thawing is complete.\n2. Sterilization\nIrradiation",
    "Place batches of four tracheal pieces measuring 2 cm each in a 20 mL of methacrylate in T25 culture flask filled with PBS until a total volume of 30 mL is reached. Take care to prevent bubbles from forming, which could cause energy diffusion in the air-liquid interface.\nConduct irradiation using a linear accelerator, with photons of a nominal energy of 10 MV flattening filter free beams. Apply a dose rate of 2,400 monitor units per minute at the isocenter, placing the tracheas at a source-surface distance of 100 cm to be irradiated, with a depth of field of 2.5 cm for a radiation field of 10 cm x 10 cm-so as to cover the entire container-corresponding to a dose of 24 Gy/min.\nEscalate the doses with each four piece batch; four pieces will be subjected to 0.5 kGy, four to 1 kGy, four to 2 kG, etc., until sterilization is reached.\nCulture\n\t\nIntroduce the pieces into 30 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with inactivated 10% FBS without antibiotics or antifungals.\nCulture them in a standard tissue incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 weeks and inspect them every 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The contamination parameters are changes in the pH of the culture medium and, accordingly, changes in the color and turbidity of the medium. The tracheas were harvested from germ-free lagomorphs, which were not ill and, thus, expected to be devoid of anaerobic bacteria in their tracheas.\n3. Histological analysis\nNOTE: Stain the pieces using hematoxylin and eosin21, Masson's trichrome, and orcein22.\nDAPI staining\n\t\nDetermine the tissue viability using DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). This blue-florescent stain binds strongly to adenine- and thymine-rich regions in DNA sequences, and therefore allows for DNA to be viewed via fluorescence microscopy.\nEmbed the tissue samples in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound.",
    "Cut the samples using a cryostat.\nWash the sample to be dyed three times in distilled water to remove the OCT. Place in mounting medium that includes a 30 nM solution of DAPI.\nVisualize fluorescence using fluorescence microscopy.\nDNA content analysis\n\t\nCut segments of trachea measuring approximately 3 mm long using a scalpel.\nIncubate for 2 h in proteinase K (Table of Materials).\nExtract the DNA with a DNA extraction kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nBy means of spectrophotometry, determine the concentration of DNA by measuring the absorbance at 260/280 using a spectrophotometer.\nMeasure the size of the extracted DNA samples using capillary chromatography with a bioanalyzer.\n4. Biomechanical study\nNOTE: Tracheal resistance to longitudinal and transverse forces is measured through axial tensile and radial compression tests23.\nTracheal measurement\n\t\nMeasure the tracheal length, wall thickness, and external diameter using a Vernier caliper.\nCalculate the average values from three random measurements of each of the variables.\nIn the radial compression tests, calculate the anteroposterior diameter by detecting the point at which the plate comes into contact with the specimen.\nPerform all tests at room temperature.\nTensile tests\n\t\nConduct tensile tests on a traction desktop universal testing machine (UTM) displacement control, equipped with a 100 N load (0.1 N force resolution, 0.001 mm of position, and 0.1 s). The testing machine is equipped with force and position sensors, and is connected to a computer with software specifically designed by the manufacturer23.\nRecord data every 0.4 s and export to a spreadsheet.\nConstruct tensile jaws adapted to the mean caliber of the rabbit tracheas from pure monolayer, non-toxic crystal polyvinyl chloride (PVC) hollow tubes with an external diameter of 1 cm and a wall thickness of 1.5 mm.\nSection the conducts into 3 cm long segments.",
    "Drill 12 preformed holes for the termino-terminal suture, 2 mm from the edge of the jaws and separated by a distance of 2.5 mm, to prevent bias due to the sutures.\nAttach the PVC glass tubes to the rabbit trachea by termino-terminal anastomosis with a continuous suture through alternate preformed holes (every 5 mm), 2 mm away from the edge of the trachea and with a 6-0 nylon monofilament suture.\nStretch all the pieces at a displacement rate of 5.0 mm/min.\nRecord the variables maximum stress (σmax, in N/mm2) and strain (εmax, with no units), together with the energy stored per unit of trachea volume (W/Vol, in mJ/mm), and Young's modulus (E, in MPa).\nRadial compression tests\n\t\nPerform radial compression tests on a compression desktop UTM, equipped with a 15 N load cell (force resolution 0.001 N, position 0.001 mm, and time 0.1 s) to obtain force data (N), position (mm), and time (s). Record data and export to spreadsheet at 0.5 s intervals.\nPlace the tracheas with the membranous area resting on the lower plate. The plate gradually rises up toward the top plate at a constant speed of 5 mm/min.\nCalculate every unit per unit of length of the sample (f in N/mm), stiffness (R in Mpa·mm), and the energy per unit of surface area (W / S in mJ/mm2) needed to completely occlude the trachea.\n5. Surgical technique\nNOTE: The surgical technique has been widely reported elsewhere20.\nPlace a sterile intraluminal PVC stent, size 14 Fr (which allows it to slide freely without compressing the walls), with a 3-4 mm margin at each end.\nFix the stent with a single 6-0 nylon monofilament stitch through the intercartilaginous space of the first cartilage.\nProceed to anesthetize the rabbits.",
    "Pre-medicate the subjects (3.65-4.05 kg male New Zealand white rabbits) with intramuscular analgesics (35 mg/kg ketamine) with a sedative, muscle relaxant, and analgesic (2.5 mg/kg xylazine).\nShave the incision zone out of the operating zone and clean the surgical area to remove the hair.\nAdminister analgesics plus antibiotic prophylaxis: 0.05 mg/kg intramuscular buprenorphine and 10 mg/kg enrofloxacin.\nPut a venous catheter in the marginal ear vein of each rabbit.\nInduct anesthesia with an intravenous 10 mg/kg bolus of propofol.\nMonitor the animal's vital signs using a three-lead electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive pressure measurement. Every 30 min, apply physiological serum to the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nVerify the anesthetic plane using the toe pinch method.\nMaintain anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane at 1.5%-2% of the minimum alveolar concentration without losing spontaneous ventilation and provide thermal support to the rabbit with a heating pad.\nDisinfect the incision zone several times in a circular motion with an iodine-based scrub. Under aseptic conditions at all times and with sterile material, make a longitudinal 3 cm central thoracic incision, and harvest bilateral pedicled flaps composed of pectoral fascia and a muscular component.\nWrap the tracheas with the flap in four rabbits, one on each hemithorax (thus, a total of eight tracheas).\nWhen the surgery is completed, reverse the anesthesia by interrupting isoflurane administration.\nPostsurgical period\n\t\nKeep the animals in the operating room until they have completely recovered from anesthesia. When they have completely recovered, return them to their environment with other rabbits.\nTreat the rabbits with antibiotics (0.5 mL/kg of 2.5% enrofloxacin) and analgesics (5 mg/mL meloxicam; 0.05 mL/kg metacam) every 24 h for 5 days.\nLeave the implants in situ for the desired time.",
    "Prior to euthanasia, pre-medicate the rabbits with intramuscular analgesics (35 mg/kg ketamine) and a sedative, muscle relaxant, and analgesic (2.5 mg/kg xylazine). Then euthanize the rabbits with 133 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium using a 200 mg/mL injection through the marginal ear vein and harvest the tracheas.\nPerform biomechanical and histological tests on the tracheas.\n6. Statistical analysis\nAdjust all the models by the Bayesian method on R software, Version 3.5.3 R Core (R Foundation for Statistical Computing. 2019).\nAnalyze the study variables, except f and R, using multiple linear regression models.\nFor the f and R variables, apply mixed linear regression models. In these models, in addition to the variables of interest related to the treatment and condition of each trachea, introduce the percentage of occlusion as a monotonic effect and an independent term per trachea as a random factor.\nSubscription Required.
