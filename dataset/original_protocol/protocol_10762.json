    "NOTE: The water used in all the protocols has a resistivity >18 MΩ.cm.\n1. Native Collagen Fibrils\nCombine 6 μl of water, 20 μl of 200 mM Na2HPO4 adjusted to pH 7 with HCl and 10 μl of 400 mM KCl in a microfuge tube and mix.\nAdd 4 μl of collagen monomer (~3 mg/ml in 0.01 N HCl) to the microfuge tube and mix. The solution should be clear and colorless.\nPlace the microfuge tube containing the reaction mixture in a heat block that has been pre-warmed to 37 °C and leave for 3 to 4 hr. At this point, the solution should be slightly cloudy and contain mainly native collagen fibrils.\n2. Fibrous Long Spacing Collagen\nDialyze 1 ml of collagen monomer (~3 mg/ml in 0.01 N HCl) using 12-14 kDa MWCO membrane against 400 ml of water, changing the water four times over a period of 24 hr at room temperature. The dialyzed collagen monomer that is not used right away can be stored at 4 °C for future use.\nCombine 20 μl of water, 20 μl of 3 mg/ml α1-acid glycoprotein in water and 20 μl of dialyzed collagen monomer in a microfuge tube. The solution should be clear and colorless.\nLeave the microfuge tube containing the reaction mixture at room temperature for 30 min. At this point, the solution should be cloudy and contain predominantly FLS collagen fibrils.\n3. Segmental Long Spacing Collagen\nCombine 67 μl of water, 60 μl of 100 mM glycine-HCl buffer at pH 3.3 and 40 μl of 10 mg/ml ATP in water in a microfuge tube and mix.\nAdd 33 μl of collagen monomer (~3 mg/ml in 0.01 N HCl) to the microfuge tube and mix. The solution should be clear and colorless.",
    "Leave the microfuge tube containing the reaction mixture at room temperature for 2 hr. At this point, the solution will still appear clear, but should contain mostly SLS collagen.\n4. AFM Characterization\nCleave the surface of a piece of mica attached to an AFM substrate by covering the mica surface with a piece of sticky tape and then peeling it away. Check the tape afterwards to confirm that an entire layer of mica was cleaved in order to reduce irregularities on the surface and ensure that the old sample is removed if the mica is being reused.\nApply 20 μl of the collagen fibril solution to the freshly cleaved mica substrate. Leave for 5 min.\nGently rinse off solution of collagen fibril with water. It is advisable not to apply the water directly onto the center of the mica substrate but at the edge and to allow it to flow across the sample.\nDry the surface under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. It is advisable to direct the stream at the edge and not at the center of the mica substrate.\nUnder an optical microscope at 200× magnification, the native and FLS collagen samples should show clumps of fibrils. SLS collagen will not be visible.",
    "The unique characteristics of the three different collagen structures are observable by AFM. Generally, we image native collagen fibrils with an AFM in intermittent contact mode using silicon AFM probes, whereas FLS and SLS collagen fibrils we typically image with an AFM in contact mode using silicon nitride AFM probes. We do this because of time and cost considerations. Silicon AFM probes are usually sharper than silicon nitride AFM probes, which make them particularly useful for imaging the narrower banding structure of native collagen fibrils. However, silicon AFM probes are much more prone to contamination by collagen samples than silicon nitride AFM probes and need to replaced frequently. Therefore, we reserve the use of silicon AFM probes mostly for imaging native collagen fibrils where resolution is a greater necessity and we operate in intermittent contact mode to prolong their lifetime of usefulness.\nWe recommend an initial 100 × 100 μm2 scan which should show at least a few collagen constructs. From there, zoom in to scan sizes of 10 × 10 μm2 and then 2 × 2 μm2 to observe the banding periodicity of native and FLS collagen, or the finer features of an SLS collagen. It is also a good idea to check at least two other regions on the collagen sample to verify that the initial scans are representative."
