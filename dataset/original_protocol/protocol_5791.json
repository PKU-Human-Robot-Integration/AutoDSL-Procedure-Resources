    "An overview of the entire protocol is given in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614002142_3248.jpgFigure 1. Schematic workflow illustrating the determination of the total metal concentrations in whole cells and thylakoids, and the more detailed analysis of metal allocation into photosynthetic complexes of Synechocystis. Capital letters (A-E) indicate the corresponding procedures in the protocol.Whole cell preparationInoculate Synechocystis strains in 0.5 L of BG11-G growth medium (see Recipes), in 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks. Inoculate at least three independent cultures for each strain (biological replicates) to a final 0.05 OD750, following standard microbiological practices. Incubate the cultures at a light intensity of 50 µmol photons m-2 sec-1, and shake the flasks on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm until the cultures reach the late exponential phase (0.8-0.9 OD750). Applying these growth conditions the cultures should reach the desired density in about 5 days.Before collecting the cultures, measure the OD750 for each culture.For each culture, keep aside 50 ml culture for protein concentration determination in whole cells samples (Steps A8-A13). Pellet the remaining culture, centrifuging at 5,000 x g for 10 min (at room temperature), using the 250 ml bottles suitable for the type 19 rotor of the Beckman Coulter centrifuge. Repeat the centrifugation step to pellet the rest of the culture volume.Wash the cell pellet with 50 ml of EDTA washing buffer (see Recipes), pellet the cells at 5,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant and repeat this washing step two more times (Note 1). The supernatant from the first wash will appear slightly colored (with a yellow-orange shade), whereas the supernatant of the third wash should be clear (Figure 2).",
    "Wash the pellet with 50 ml of Tricine buffer (see Recipes), pellet the cells at 5,000 x g for 10 min, discard the supernatant and repeat this washing step two more times. Before the last centrifugation step, split the cell suspension into two parts, and pellet both cell fractions by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. One cell pellet constitutes the whole cell preparation ready to be analyzed (see Procedure C). The pellet for the whole cell preparation can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer until analysis. The second cell pellet is directly further processed to obtain thylakoid membranes (Steps B1-B6).Note: The metal concentrations will be normalized on protein concentrations. Hence, protein concentration per cell number needs to be determined. For accurate determination of protein concentration in whole cell samples, complete cell rupture is essential. Treat the cells collected at Step A4 according to Steps A6-A7 and re-suspend the cell pellets to OD750 1 in Tricine buffer (see Recipes).Add 1 ml of lysozyme solution (see Recipes) to the cell suspension and gently shake it at room temperature for 30 min. In our hands, this step helps the subsequent rupture.Repeatedly rupture the cells in a microfluidizer processor, following manufacturer instruction. Seven to eight cycles are usually sufficient to obtain complete cell rupture.Examine the cells rupture under a light microscope to confirm complete rupture of the cells. Measure the protein concentration of the samples using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (see Materials and Reagents) for colorimetric detection and quantitation of total protein. The determined protein concentration indicates the µg of proteins in 1 ml of cell lysate, and hence the µg of proteins in 1 ml of culture at 1 OD750.",
    "Calculate the protein concentration of the whole cell fraction collected in Step A7 by multiplying the protein concentration obtained in Step A12 with the OD750 value measured in Step A3 and by the initial culture volume of the collected cells, which in this case was 225 ml (500 ml of initial culture in Step A1 minus the 50 ml put aside in Step A4, and divided by 2 according to Step A7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614011435_8619.jpgFigure 2. Cell pellet washed three times with EDTA washing buffer. Cell pellets harvested as described in Step A5 are washed three times with the EDTA washing buffer (Step A6). The supernatant of the first wash has a distinct yellow-orange color (1st) which should fade during the second (2nd) and third (3rd) wash. A clear conical tube containing EDTA washing buffer (B) is shown for comparison.Thylakoids preparation (Note 2)Note: In the following steps, samples must be kept on ice, and it is recommended to perform all steps in dim green light to protect the photosynthetic complexes. All centrifugation steps are conducted at 4 °C. Re-suspend the cell pellets prepared in Steps A1-A7 in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (see Recipes) and transfer the cell suspension to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube holding 1 ml of glass beads.Rupture cells in the beads mill, using cooled racks (leave the racks 15 min at -20 °C). The beads mill disrupts the cells through high-speed shaking with glass beads. Cell disruption is performed during six cycles of beads beating, where each cycle involves 1 min of beads beating followed by 1 min of incubation on ice.Separate unbroken cells and glass beads by centrifugation for 2 min at 16,000 x g.Transfer the supernatant to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and pellet thylakoid membranes for 1 h at 16,000 x g.",
    "Wash thylakoids two times in 500 µl of Tricine-NaF buffer (centrifuge for 20 min, 16,000 x g) and determine protein concentration using the BCA assay kit. Centrifuge thylakoids for 20 min, 16,000 x g and carefully discard the supernatant. The pellet is either digested for determination of total metal analysis (Procedure C) (Note 3) or re-suspended in storage buffer, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C for up to 3 months until preparation for SEC-ICP-QQQ-MS analysis (Procedure D).Determination of total metal concentrations in whole cells and thylakoid membranesNote: Clean consumables and clean lab procedures must be used in all the following steps. It is recommended to include at least one certified reference (apple [Malus domestica] leaves, NIST 1515; National Institute of Standards and Technology) and one true blank in each digestion run. Thaw the pellets of whole cells and thylakoid membranes (prepared as described in Procedure A and B, respectively) and add 70% (v/v) HNO3 (see Note 4) directly to each sample in the Eppendorf tubes. Samples are pre-digested for two hours (leave the Eppendorf tubes open, loosely covered by a plastic bag to minimize contamination).Carefully transfer (by pipetting) the pre-digested samples to 8 ml Teflon digestion tubes. Add 15% (v/v) H2O2 (in a HNO3 to H2O2 ratio of 2.5 to 1, according to Step C1) (see Note 5). Digest the samples using a pressurized microwave system (e.g., Milestone, according to the detailed description reported in Hansen et al. [2013]). Transfer samples to a clean tube, rinsing the Teflon digestion tubes with Milli-Q water at least three times. Dilute samples to a final concentration of 3.5 % HNO3 (v/v) using Milli-Q water (see Note 6).",
    "Prepare the calibration standards for the external calibration of the metals of interest (covering a linear range of at least three orders of magnitude and 8 to 10 calibration points).Analyze the samples including calibration standards by ICP-MS.Thylakoid preparation for SEC-ICP-QQQ-MS measurements Note: In the following steps, samples must be kept on ice, and it is recommended to perform all steps in dim green light to protect the photosynthetic complexes. All centrifugation steps are conducted at 4 °C. Thaw the thylakoid membrane samples on ice and in darkness.Take a homogeneous sub-sample (in this example: corresponding to 300 µg of protein, see Step B5) (pipette gently up and down, avoid vortexing). Pellet the thylakoid membranes in a microcentrifuge by centrifugation at 7,000 x g for 2 min.Discard the supernatant and re-suspend (by gently pipetting up and down) the thylakoid membranes in 150 µl ice-cold solubilization buffer (freshly prepared, see Recipes) to a final protein concentration of 2 µg/µl.Add an equal volume of detergent solution (150 µl, see Recipes) to a final protein concentration of 1 µg/µl and solubilize the thylakoid membranes on ice and in darkness for 10 min.Solubilized proteins (supernatant) are separated from insoluble material (pellet) by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min. The solubilized proteins (supernatant) are immediately collected, and passed through a 0.45 µm nylon membrane filter using 1 ml syringes, into HPLC microvials. Keep samples on ice and in darkness until the subsequent speciation analysis (Procedure E).SEC-ICP-QQQ-MS measurements: Determination of metal binding in photosynthetic complexes (speciation analysis)Note: During speciation analysis, the HPLC autosampler and column compartment are kept cold at 6 °C. This part of the protocol is based on the method developed by Schmidt et al.",
    "(2015) Equilibrate the HPLC system and the size-exclusion column with the mobile phase buffer (see Recipes) for at least 1 h. Inject 50 µg of freshly solubilized thylakoid proteins onto the size-exclusion column, using the HPLC system.Perform isocratic protein fractionation and elution using mobile phase buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 35 min.For the online detection of metals bound in photosynthetic protein complexes, the column outlet is directly coupled to the ICP-QQQ-MS (Note 7).Time-resolved chromatograms with multi-element detection are recorded (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614012158_2338.jpgFigure 3. Multi-metal chromatogram. Size-exclusion profiles recorded for the non-oxide ions 24Mg+ and 55Mn+ and the oxide ion 72FeO+. Individual Mn and Fe subfractions are assigned according to Gandini et al. (2017), the Mg profile is illustrated as a proxy for chlorophyll."
