The mammalian expression\n      plasmid for Fv-clasp (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) is constructed using\n      a pcDNA3-based vector, containing a signal sequence from mouse IgH,11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\n      and a C-terminal 6xHis-tag.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] The VH\n      and VL are constructed in separate vectors. We fused an\n      EGFP to the C-terminus of SARAH in the VH vector using AgeI\n      site (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). For single domain antibody (nanobody\n      or VHH), we directly fused the EGFP to the C-terminus of nanobody (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2940-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1.

    "Harvest the supernatant of the transfected cells 3–4 days after the\n        transfection. Use one 15 mL falcon tube to collect the supernatant from\n        one dish.\n      \nNote: Centrifuge the culture supernatant\n      at 200×g for 3 min to spin down and remove the cell debris.\n    \n        Collect the 6×His tag fused recombinant antibodies with Ni-NTA agarose\n        (QIAGEN, 30210).\n        \n            Prepare the agarose beads by washing 3 times with 1 mL TBS (repeat\n            following steps ii to iiii for 3 times).\n            \n                Thoroughly suspend Ni-NTA agarose beads in stock and immediately\n                transfer an appropriate amount of Ni-NTA resin to a 1.5 mL tube.\n                Fifty μL of agarose beads are used for the purification of one\n                antibody.\n              \nAdd 1 mL TBS buffer.\n                Centrifuge at 500 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\n                \nNote: The maximum resin\n                  pressure resistance is 2.8 psi.\n                \n                Remove the supernatant.

Moreover, it enables to detect\n        a minor fraction of probes with a wide range of detection limits (koff, 10−4–102 s−1).

Then, wash the cell 3 times with\n                PBS buffer.\n              \n                Acquire the time-lapse images for EGFP regression.\n                \nNote: The time-interval,\n                  exposure time and laser power for acquiring EGFP regression\n                  should be kept the same as those used for fluorescent\n                  antibodies.\n                \n                Calculate the intensity of EGFP in each frame.\n                \nNote: Background should be\n                  subtracted from the fluorescent intensity.\n                \n                Fit the regression curve of EGFP fluorescent intensity using a\n                one-phase-decay model. The best fitted K value represents the\n                photobleaching rate (Kp).\n              \n            Calculate the dissociation rate (koff) by subtracting\n            Kp from KR.\n          \nSite-directed mutagenesis\nTiming: 4 days – 2 weeks\n    \n      To accelerate the dissociation rate of the recombinant antibodies, several",
    "conserved amino acids located at the base of antibody CDR loops are\n      identified as candidate sites for Ala (A) or Gly (G) substitution.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n      This section outlines the principles for selecting the combination of\n      substitution sites and includes the method for site-directed mutagenesis.\n    \n        Align the antibody sequence and identify the candidate sites for\n        mutagenesis (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for\n        the alignment of antibody sequence).\n      \nNote: Candidate sites are: H27, H28, H32,\n      H59 and H102 for antibody VH; L32, L49 and L96 for antibody\n      VL; Nb27, Nb28, Nb32, Nb37, Nb59 and Nb102 for nanobodies.\n      These candidate sites are highly conserved in antibodies and\n      nanobodies.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n        Generate 3–5 antibody mutants with a single amino acid substitution at\n        candidate sites.\n        \nNote: As a starting point, we\n          recommend trying the following substitutions: H/Nb32A, H/Nb59A, Nb37A,\n          L32A, L49A and L96A. Mutations at these sites could effectively\n          accelerate the dissociation rate but occasionally lead to the loss of\n          antigen recognition.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] A concise\n          protocol for DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis is described as\n          follows.\n        \n            Design the forward and reverse primer for the reaction.\n            \nNote: The primer sequences should\n              be complementary to each other. The primer should be 14–18 base\n              pairs (bp) long on both sides of the mutation site, and terminate\n              with a G or C. The melting temperature (Tm) should be between\n              55°C–65°C.\n            \n            Introduce the point mutation by PCR reaction:\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2940_14.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2940_15.csv\n            Digest methylated plasmid template with DpnI (New England Biolabs,\n            R0176S) for 90 min.\n          \n            Transform the mutated plasmid into competent E. coli DH5α.\n          \n        Purify the antibody mutants and measure the dissociation rates using the\n        procedures described in steps 3–15.\n      \nNote: As an example, single point\n      mutations HY32A and LY49A in 12CA5 antibody (anti-hemagglutinin [HA] tag)\n      fragments increase the dissociation rate by 36 folds and 2.4 folds,\n      respectively (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: Some antibodies may lose the antigen",
    "recognition after the mutagenesis. The substitution sites in those\n      antibody mutants should be avoided in the following steps which combine\n      multiple point mutations.\n    \n        Combine two point mutations in VH and VL to\n        further increase the dissociation rate (e.g., H32A + L49A in\n        Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n      \n        Introducing an additional H/Nb27G, H/Nb28A or H/Nb102A substitution\n        could further increase the dissociation rate with a high probability\n        (e.g., H28A + H32A + L49A in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n      \nNote: The desired half-life for antibody\n      probes in IRIS super-resolution imaging is typically between 1–10 s. In\n      general, it is recommended to only introduce 1–5 point mutations to the\n      antibody as introducing too many mutations sometimes results in increased\n      noise levels."
