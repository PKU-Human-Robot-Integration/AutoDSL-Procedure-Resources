    "1. Scaffold Manufacture and Bio-functionalization of Scaffolds\nTo fabricate PU scaffolds (pore size 100-250 mm, porosity 90-95%) in the form of Petri dish disks, use the thermally induced phase separation13  process by preparing a polymer solution (5wt% in Dioxan) followed by freezing and subsequent solvent sublimation (Figure 1A).\nCut the scaffold disk into cubes of 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm prior to coating with ECM proteins (Figure 1B).\nPre-wet the scaffolds by immersing them in ethanol (70%) for 1 min and then transfer into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. Then centrifuge for 10 min at 3630 x g and add the protein solution.\nCentrifuge the scaffolds in the protein solution at 1420 x g for 20 min.\nIn order to unblock the surface pores, and allow the cells seeded to penetrate deeper into the scaffold, centrifuge the scaffolds one more time at 910 x g for 10 min in PBS.\nSterilize the scaffolds using a combination of 8 min exposure at 230 v, 50 Hz, 0.14 A, UV lamp, with immersion for 2 h in Ethanol (70%). After that, wash the scaffolds twice in PBS before adding Iscove's Modified Dulbecco Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin (P/S). Place the scaffolds in a humidified incubator for 3 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 prior to use. Sterile scaffolds are placed in a 24 well-tissue culture plates (one scaffold per well).\n2. Mononuclear Cell Isolation and Scaffold Seeding\nExtract human MNC from cord blood or leukemic bone marrow samples, using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (35 min at 1500 rpm) (Figure 1C).\nResuspend MNC in IMDM containing 30% FBS and 1% P/S.\nSeed 100μl of MNC suspension (2 × 106 cells/scaffold) onto the scaffolds using a micro-pipette.",
    "Incubate the seeded scaffolds at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 10 minutes for the cells to settle into the scaffolds.\nTop up each well up with 1.5 ml of IMDM containing 30% FBS and 1% P/S and place well plates in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the duration of the experiment.\nThe seeded scaffolds undergo daily change of all media.\n3. In situ Cell Proliferation and Morphology: MTS, SEM and Cytospins\nMTS assay: Remove from culture one un-seeded and two seeded scaffolds and place in a clean new 24 well-plate. Add 1 ml of media and 200 μl of the MTS solution and incubate for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n \nTake 8 x 100 μl samples from the supernatant; place in a 96-well plate and measure absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM): At different time points of the culture, remove the scaffolds seeded with MNC from the media, and fix with 2.5% PBS-buffered glutaraldehyde solution for 40 min at 4 °C, then wash twice with PBS.\n \nDehydrated the scaffolds in a graded series of ethanol (25, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%), each for 10 min and dry in an aseptic environment for 4 hours.\nSection specimens and then sputter-coat them with gold in an argon atmosphere for 2 min prior to SEM evaluation, use an acceleration voltage of 20 kV.\nCytospins: Collect 2.0 x 104 cells/slide by aspirating the cells from the scaffold at different time points in the culture.\n \nCentrifuge the cells onto a glass slide for 3 min at 1500 rpm.\nStain the slides with Wright-Giemsa Stain Modified and observe by using an optical microscope. F-view Soft Imaging System can be used to take pictures.\nWash slides prior to microscope observation.",
    "Multiphoton analysis: Fix scaffolds at different time points with ethanol vapor (70%) overnight and then dry and store at -20 °C until further analysis. Prior to visualization with the multiphoton microscope section the scaffold into 30 μm-thick slides and wet with PBS.\n \nBlock the seeded scaffolds in PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the scaffolds overnight at 4 °C in darkness with a 1:50 dilution of primary monoclonal antibody: mouse anti human CD71.\nWash samples three times in PBS and stain with the secondary antibody: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 for 1 h at room temperature in darkness.\nWash samples three times with PBS and observe with a confocal microscope using a water emission x60 objective lens.\nFluorophore Alexa Fluor 488 is excited at 488 nm by the pulsatile lasers. Volocity 5.3.2 software can be used for subsequent image analysis.\n4. Flow Cytometric Analysis of the Cellular Population\nBefore cellular analysis in the flow cytometer (FC), label the cells of interest with the corresponding immunofluorescence antibodies for detection. A number of samples are prepared according to the selected antibodies for detection. For MNC detection the following combination of antibodies are used: CD45-FITC/CD71-PE/CD235a-PE-Cy5.\nAspirate the cells from the scaffold at different time points and centrifuge. Dissolve a cell pellet of around 1x106 cells in 100 μl FC buffer (PBS + 0.1% sodium azide) and add 10 μL of each antibody fluorescence dye. Incubate the cells for 30 min at 4 °C, wash twice with PBS and finally re-suspend in FC buffer.\nLoad the sample into the flow cytometer stained with the isotype control to set the \"negativity\" of the antibody expression and calibrate the detection channels with the flow cytometer control.",
    "Read the sample stained with the three different antibodies and finally represent the data in using the WinList software.\n5. Representative Results\nAn example of hematopoietic cellular growth kinetics without the addition of exogenous growth factors is shown in Figure 2. Due to the heterogeneous nature of hematopoiesis, two different cells: normal and abnormal hematopoietic cells are illustrated. In Figure 2A, cellular proliferation of human CBMNC is evident after 28 days in culture. Figure 2B shows the growth kinetics in the mimicry using human primary leukemic cells. Cellular proliferation is assessed using the MTS assay which measures cellular metabolic activity in relation to absorbance. In both cases, the cells proliferated and established in the model. Differences in growth kinetics are observed; normal hematopoietic cells establish the culture faster than the leukemic cells.",
    "The morphology of the harvested cells even after 28 days of culture in the absence of exogenous growth factors was typical of normal hematopoietic cells (Figure 3A) and leukemic cells (Figure 3B). Central sections of the scaffolds were analyzed by SEM after the scaffolds were removed from the culture and showed the spreading of the seeded cells throughout the scaffold, establishing themselves in clusters and in \"niche-like\" structures (Figure 3A' &B'). Figure C shows the pore size and distribution in an unseeded scaffold used as a control. Multiphoton microscopy after 28 days was used to highlight the distribution of the cells within the 3D scaffold in situ and it showed the presence of erythroid islands in central sections of the scaffold (Figure 4) by the expression of the marker CD71 which is positive in erythroblasts. This proves the importance of mature and maturing cells during erythropoiesis. Finally, flow cytometry graphs of the cells prior seeding shows the difference in the phenotype of hematopoietic cells, where Figure 5A represents normal hematopoietic cells: human CBMNCs and Figure 5B illustrates abnormal hematopoietic cells: primary leukemic cells. Levels of CD235a + and CD45+ corresponding to erythrocytes and leukocytes respectively are higher in the normal sample than in the leukemic highlighting the hemoblastic nature of the leukemias.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3654/3654fig1.jpg",
