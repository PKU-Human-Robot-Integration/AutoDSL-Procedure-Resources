    "Plant material and pretreatment of specimensYoung plants of Vallisneria of 20-30 cm long were purchased at a tropical-fish store and cultured to be grown over 100 cm in buckets (20 L) filled with tap water and with a layer of soil at the bottom (Figure 1A). The plants were grown under 12 h light/12 h dark regime at 20-24 °C. The light source was a bank of 20 W fluorescent lamps (50 μmol m-2 s-1).Preparation of crude microsomal (CM) fraction and plasma membrane-enriched (PM) fractionAt the end of the light period, 40 g of the healthy fresh leaves were harvested into tap water and kept in complete darkness for 12-16 h. Note: Before use, snip off unhealthy part from the leaves.The leaves were chopped on ice with a blade (Figure 1B). These small leaf pieces were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Figure 1C) in 120 ml of a homogenizing medium. The homogenate was filtrated through six sheets of gauze (Figure 1D) and centrifuged (8,000 x g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (Figure 1E) was ultracentrifuged at 156,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended with a Teflon homogenizer in Buffer B (Figure 1F), followed by another ultracentrifugation at 156,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet (Figure 1G) was washed with buffer A and then re-suspended into a small volume (usually 6 ml) of the fresh buffer A, designated as a CM fraction. When the CM fraction was directly used for phosphorylation assay, it was washed and suspended with buffer B, not buffer A. A highly purified PM fraction was isolated from the CM fraction by applying aqueous polymer two-phase partitioning (Figure 1H-I) using Dextran from Leuconostoc ssp. Mr ~500,000 and polyethylene glycol (Yoshida et al., 1983; Takagi et al.",
    ", 1988; Harada et al., 2002). After the final ultracentrifugation of the polyethylene-glycol-enriched upper phase, the pellet was washed with buffer B and then re-suspended into a small volume of the fresh buffer, designated as a PM fraction.Note: All the procedures were carried out on ice at 0-4 °C under dim red light (0.1 μmol m-2 s-1). The total protein contents in the CM and PM fractions were determined by Bradford assay. The CM and PM fractions were kept in darkness on ice until use. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151103/20151103025832_0529.jpgFigure 1.

In vitro phosphorylation assayThe CM and PM fraction were suspended in the reaction mixture as described below.Reaction mixture (17.5 μl for each reaction)table:",
    "﻿0,1\nCM and PM fraction containing 20 μg protein,x μl\n5x phosphorylation buffer,4 μl\n1% Triton X-100,1 μl\nDeionized water,17.5-x μl\nThe reaction mixture put into a 0.2 ml tube was irradiated with blue light (450 nm) for a defined period of time (usually 0-300 sec) using a lighting system equipped with a fiber scope, a cut off filter, and an interference filter (Figure 2A). Immediately after the end of the irradiation, the reaction mixture was mixed with ATP mixture (2.5 μl) containing radioactive ATP and incubated for 2 min to allow phosphorylation reaction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4x SDS buffer (7 μl).Note: Steps C1-3 were carried out on ice under dim red light (0.1 μmol m-2 s-1) in the dark room to avoid any non-specific excitation of photoreceptors by background light.  The sample was boiled for 2 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 10.0% (w/v) gel. Separated polypeptides on the gel were stained once with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the protein profiles (Figure 2B, the left panel). Note: In each lane, 20 μg of proteins were loaded.Autoradiography was carried out by exposing the de-stained and dried-up gels to an imaging plate for 0.5-1 h at room temperature (Figure 2B, the right panel). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151103/20151103025916_8250.jpgFigure 2.
