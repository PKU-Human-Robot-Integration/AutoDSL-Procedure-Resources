    "The animal anatomic segments, normally intended for human consumption, were purchased at a local butcher's shop ( Figure 1). Therefore, they could be easily transported and stored with no specific restrictions or sanitary regulations.\n1. Cleaning the swine upper airways\nWith the help of a dissecting scalpel, Adson forceps and Metzembaum scissors, clean the trachea and larynx from excess surrounding tissues (lateral muscles, excess of tongue), by cutting and dissecting.\nRemove tissue until the larynx cartilages are almost exposed and the tracheal rings are easy to palpate.\nRemove the hyoid bone and surrounding soft tissues: find the eminence of the greater horn and follow the horn with the blade, then pass to the contralateral one and repeat the same operation until the whole part is removed.\nCut the trachea at its distal side approximatively at 15 cm from the larynx using a dissecting knife.\n\tNOTE: The removed part, composed by mediastinal organs, will be used for the next step in the procedure.\n2. Preparing the thyroid\nTake the previously discarded mediastinal organs and search for the thymus.\n\tNOTE: The thymus is usually located on the frontal portion of the mediastinum right over the right atrium. Adult pigs may have a very small thymus.\nWith dissecting forceps, detach the thymus from the surrounding tissue.\nCarve the just obtained pig thymus into a butterfly shape to recreate a simulated thyroid.\n\t\nWith a dissecting knife, cut a flat slice of thymus 1.5 cm thick.\nWith Metzembaum scissors, cut the slice in a butterfly shape with two 3 cm x 2 cm lobes connected by a hystmus.\n\t\tNOTE: The overall dimensions of the thyroid should be 3 cm long, 6 cm large and 1.5cm thick.\n3. Suturing the thyroid to the tracheal wall.",
    "NOTE: For the next step, use the previously prepared upper airways and the simulated thyroid.\nPlace the simulated thyroid between the first and third tracheal ring.\nTake a needle holder and surgical forceps. Grab a 2/0 silk suture.\nSuture the thyroid with two lateral horizontal mattress stitches passing in each lobe and in the lateral portion of the trachea.\n\tNOTE: The horizontal mattress stitch wraps more tissue than the normal stitch. This is important when suturing soft tissues, as pig thymus, that tends to tear up.\nPass the needle only in the superficial part of the trachea to prevent the possibility of seeing the thread in the tracheal lumen if performing fibroscopy.\n\tNOTE: Identification and preservation of the thyroid gland avoiding postoperative bleeding represent crucial surgical steps during tracheotomy procedure.\n4. Preparing the esophagus\nUse the esophagus, which is located on the backside of the trachea, to simulate the neck fascia and muscles.\nRemove the esophagus from its larynx connection by cutting it with a scalpel or with surgical scissors.\nCut and open the esophagus on its length with surgical scissors.\nHold the muscle and mucosa with toothed forceps to help the cutting procedure. The result of this operation will be a rectangle of muscle covered by esophagus mucosa.\n5. Suturing the esophagus to the trachea\nPlace the just obtained layer of muscles on top of the trachea and larynx with the mucous membrane face up. The aim is to cover the larynx: from the thyroid cartilage summit to the last tracheal rings.\nSuture the opened esophagus with at least 6 simple stitches:\n\tOne on the proximal side of the model, on the summit of the Thyroid cartilage.\n\tOne on the distal side of the preparation, on the frontal portion of the last tracheal ring.",
    "At least one on each side of the trachea.\n\tOne on each side of the lower lateral portion of the thyroid cartilage where cricothyroid muscles are.\nMark a line on the esophagus mucosa with white India ink to simulate the linea alba.\n\tNOTE: Identification and proper dissection through the linea alba is an important step during tracheotomy procedure (Figure 2).\n\t\nTo do so, use white India ink and an insulin syringe.\nWithdraw some ink and then track a line on the simulated fascia by scratching it with the needle while spilling little drops of ink.\nRemove the excess of ink gently with a small swab.\n6. Preparing the foam base for the model\nCut a square of foam of 3 cm x 10 cm x 15 cm.\nShape a furrow 2.5 cm large and 10 cm long in the center of the foam.\n\t\nTo do this, fold half of the square of foam so that it creates a longitudinal hump on one side.\nCut 1 cm of the hump off all its length with scissors.\nUnfold the foam square and trim the just formed furrow smoothly.\n7. Stapling the model to the wooden tablet\nTake a wooden tablet of the same dimensions of the foam.\nPlace the foam square on the wooden tablet and insert the model in the foam furrow.\nWith a wood stapler, place a clip on the end of the trachea, on the remaining lateral muscles of the thyroid cartilage and on the epiglottis.\n8. Preparing the skin\nTake the pig skin collected from the butcher shop and cut it in a square shape big enough to cover the whole model. Usually, a square of 25 cm x 20 cm is sufficient.\nCut the skin with a dissecting knife and cover the model with it.",
    "9. Stapling the skin to the wooden tablet\nTake the stapler and fix the skin to the tablet with about 10-15 clips. Place them on the vertical sides of the tablet\nTrim the excess skin on each side of the tablet with the help of a knife.\nUse cocker forceps to firmly hold the skin to allow a safer cutting.\nSubscription Required.
