    "1. Seeding MCF10A cells in lrECM\nMaintain MCF10A cells (adherent breast epithelial cells) in the growth medium. Passage the cells every 4 days.\n\tNOTE: Composition of growth medium: high glucose DMEM without sodium pyruvate containing horse serum (5%), insulin (10 µg/mL), hydrocortisone (0.5 µg/mL), epidermal growth factor, EGF (20 ng/mL), of cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL) (see Table of Materials).\nThaw lrECM (see Table of Materials) on ice 20 min before the start of the experiment. The day of seeding the cells is generally considered Day 0.\nFor trypsinizing the cells, aspirate the medium, and wash with 2 mL of PBS. Add 900 µL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for ~15 min or till the cells are completely trypsinized.\nPrepare a bed of lrECM in eight wells of a chambered cover glass slide (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nWhen the cells are trypsinizing, coat each well with 60 µL of lrECM and place it in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for a maximum of 15 min.\nPrepare the cell suspension following the steps below.\n\t\nFollowing the complete dislodging of cells, add 5 mL of re-suspension medium to quench trypsin activity and spin the cells at 112 x g for 10 min at 25 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Composition of re-suspension medium: high glucose DMEM without sodium pyruvate, supplemented with horse serum (20%) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL).\nAspirate the spent medium and re-suspend the cells in 2 mL of assay medium. Mix the suspension well to ensure the formation of a single cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Composition of assay medium: high glucose DMEM without sodium pyruvate, supplemented with horse serum (2%), hydrocortisone (0.5 µg/mL), cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), insulin (10 µg/mL), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL).",
    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer and calculate the volume of cell suspension needed to seed 6 x 103 cells in each well.\n\t\tNOTE: It is generally preferred to include one extra well in the calculation to account for any pipetting errors.\nAccording to the number of wells required, dilute the cell suspension in overlay medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Overlay medium composition for a single well is as follows: 400 µL of assay medium, 8 µL of lrECM (2% final), and 0.02 µL of 100 µg/mL of EGF (5 ng/mL final).\nPerform seeding of the cells.\n\t\nAdd 400 µL of the diluted cell suspension to the prepared lrECM beds (step 1.4), carefully ensuring not to disturb the lrECM bed. Incubate at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\n2. PAF treatment\nAdd PAF 3 h following the seeding of cells. Prepare a 100 µM stock of PAF in PBS and add the required volume of 0.2 µL in each well (which corresponds to 200 nM).\nAdd the same concentration of PAF during every media change.\n3. Re-feeding with fresh media\nReplenish the cells with fresh medium every 4 days (i.e., Day 4, Day 8, Day 12, and Day 16).\n4. Immunofluorescence study to detect phenotypic changes induced by prolonged PAF exposure\nAfter 20 days of culturing, carefully pipette out the medium from each well and wash the wells with 400 µL of pre-warmed PBS.\nFix the acinar structures by adding 400 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (freshly prepared by diluting 16% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS) and incubating for 20 min at room temperature.\nRinse the wells once with ice-cold PBS and permeabilize with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "After 10 min, immediately but carefully pipette out the Triton-X 100 solution and rinse with 400 µL of PBS-glycine (freshly prepared by adding a pinch of glycine in 1x PBS). This is repeated thrice for 15 min each.\nAdd 400 µL of the primary blocking solution comprising 10% goat serum (see Table of Materials) in immunofluorescence (IF) buffer and incubate at room temperature for 60 min.\n\tNOTE: Composition of IF buffer: 0.05% sodium azide, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% Triton-X 100, and 0.05% Tween (20 in 1 PBS).\nRemove the primary blocking solution, add 200 µL of 2% secondary blocking antibody (F(ab')2 fragment of antibody raised in goat against mouse antigen, see Table of Materials) prepared in primary blocking solution, and leave it for 45-60 min at room temperature.\nPrepare the primary antibody (see Table of Materials) in 2% secondary blocking antibody solution in a 1:100 dilution. After removing the secondary blocking solution, add the freshly prepared antibody and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nThe previous step may elicit liquefaction of the basement membrane. Before proceeding with the experiment, wait until the slide reaches room temperature. Carefully pipette the primary antibody solution and wash it thrice with 400 µL of IF buffer.\nDuring the last wash with IF buffer, prepare a 1:200 dilution of the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (see Table of Materials) in the primary blocking solution. Incubate the slides in the secondary antibody solution for 40-60 min at room temperature.\nRinse the slides with 400 µL of IF buffer for 20 min, followed by two washes with PBS for 10 min each.\nCounter-stain the nuclei with PBS containing 0.5 ng/mL of nuclear stain (see Table of Materials) for 5-6 min at room temperature. Wash the slides thrice with 400 µL of PBS to remove excess stain.",
    "Carefully pipette out the entire PBS and ensure removal of the residual solution. Add one drop of mounting reagent (see Table of Materials) into each well and allow it to stand at room temperature overnight.\nStore the slides at room temperature and image the slides as soon as possible.\nImage under 40x or 63x magnification on a confocal microscope (see Table of Materials), taking optical Z-sections of 0.6 mm step size (NA = 1.4).\nOpen the acquired images with an image processing software (see Table of Materials). Demonstrate the morphological differences using 3D projections.\n\tNOTE: The centermost optical Z-section can be best used to show differences in the localization of polarity markers. These can be quantified manually to represent the percentage of spheroids showing that specific staining pattern.\nTo illustrate differences in the expression of proteins, perform a semi-quantitative analysis measuring the mean grey value or calculating corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF)23. Represent the data as violin or dot plots.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
