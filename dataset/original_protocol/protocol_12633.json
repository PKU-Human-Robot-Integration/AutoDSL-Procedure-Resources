  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: Throughout this protocol Caenorhabditis elegans is referred to as “worm” or “worms”. A variety of C. elegans strains can be ordered through online databases or by directly contacting labs that use the model organism. Part I of this protocol (sections 1−3) describes cDNA preparation through the Worm-to-CT protocol. Part II of this protocol (sections 4−13) describes running high-throughput RT-qPCR using nanofluidics, adapted from a protocol developed by Fluidigm16. This protocol applies to the use of the two types of nanofluidic chips defined earlier, the single-array chip, which can monitor 96 targets into 96 samples (9,216 RT-qPCR reactions total), or the multi-array chip, which functions as subunits of 12 target x 12 samples. Every multi-array chip contains six independent arrays that can be run together or separately. For instance, using a whole multi-array chip can monitor 72 targets x 12 samples (or vice versa), or 36 targets x 24 samples (or vice versa). For further information regarding any of the materials used in this protocol, refer to the Table of Materials.\n1. RT-qPCR primer validation",
    "NOTE: Real-time primers were designed based on the recommended properties originally issued by MIQUE guidelines17. To make primers specific for processed RNA, products were designed such that the two primers bound to either side of at least one splice junction. Requirements for suitable primers included 20%−80% guanine and cytosine content, a melting temperature of 58−60 °C, a difference in melting temperature between primer pairs of ≤0.5 °C and a product length of 70–120 bp. The sequence of the primers generated can be found in Supplemental Table 1. Open source code for the scripts used to generate the primers can be found at https://github.com/s-andrews/wormrtpcr. Primer pairs for transcripts with splice sites were designed so that they lie in two exons flanking an intron but were not designed to be splice-variant specific, using NCBI Primer Blast software18. For this study, the primer sets were blasted against the C. elegans genome to test for any off-target complementarity.\nRetrieve primers from the database of RT-qPCR primers (Supplemental Table 1). Alternatively, design qPCR primer pairs using online tools such as NCBI Primer Blast18.\nPerform a qPCR standard curve to monitor specificity and PCR efficiency for each pair of primers using standard bulk qPCR techniques19 and following MIQUE guidelines17,20.\n\tNOTE: Only primer pairs with R2 > 0.98 and PCR efficiency between 85% and 115% should be used. The sequence, PCR efficiency, and R2 for the primers used in this study are detailed in Table 3.\n2. Worm lysis through Worm-to-CT\nPick the worms from their bacterial lawn onto a fresh, unseeded NGM plate and allow the worms to move around the plate for 5 min to remove most of the bacteria from the worm through its movement.",
    "NOTE: The bacterial lawn and growing conditions will differ depending on the experimental design. The experiments presented here require 6 cm NGM plates seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli with worms of interest grown to stage L4.9 in a 20 °C incubator.\nIn an RNase-free hood, prepare a master mix consisting of 12.5 µL of 2x RT buffer, 1.25 µL of 20x RT enzyme buffer, and 0.25 µL of nuclease-free water per sample. Add 14 µL of master mix to 11 µL of each sample from step 2.8.\nPlace the lid of a PCR strip upside down on the platform of the dissecting scope and add 10 µL of the lysis mix to domed PCR tube caps under a compound microscope.\n\tNOTE: With only one or two samples, it is better to use a PCR strip containing at least four tubes, as this reduces the risk of the caps blasting open in the subsequent freeze-thaw steps. Alternatively, rubber bands can be used to hold the caps in place. In that case ensure caps are properly closed every time the tubes are transferred.\nPick the worms from the plate into each slot of the lid containing the lysis mix by “scooping” them (i.e., catching the worms underneath with the pick) to avoid bacterial contamination. Close the tubes and spin them down for 5 s using a tabletop microcentrifuge (Table of Materials) before placing them in a Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: Between 15 and 30 worms should be used for bulk experiments and 1 worm for single-worm measurements.\n\tCAUTION: When handling liquid nitrogen wear Cryo-Gloves as well as protective eyewear and adhere to standard clothing regulations, because contact with the skin or eyes can cause serious frostbite injury.",
    "Freeze-thaw the PCR tubes 10x by transferring them between liquid nitrogen and a ~40 °C water bath. Leave the tubes in the liquid nitrogen for a minimum of 5 s to ensure the samples are completely frozen. Leave the tubes in the water bath until the samples thaw. Do not leave in for a longer period, as this leads to RNA degradation.\n\tNOTE: Tubes can be left in liquid nitrogen for an extended period of time, as samples are frozen to approximately -200 °C, reducing RNA degradation. This should not, however, be a protocol stopping point, because liquid nitrogen evaporates rapidly.\nMix the samples on a thermal mixer (Table of Materials) set at 4 °C for 20−30 min rotating at ~1,800 rpm.\nWhile the samples are being mixed, thaw the stop solution on ice.\nSpin the samples down using a tabletop microcentrifuge (Table of Materials)  and add 1 µL of stop solution to each tube.\n\tNOTE: The samples can be left at -80 °C for up to 1 week before reverse transcribing the RNA (section 3).\n3. Reverse transcription\nNOTE: For reverse transcription of single worms, the results shown here were generated using the reagents provided with the nanofluidic chips (option 2 in Figure 1). The reagents highlighted in option 2 of Figure 1 were also used for reverse transcription of pooled samples. Either method works interchangeably for the different sample types.\nReverse transcription of single worms\n\t\nIn an RNase-free hood, add 1.25 µL of reverse transcription mix (Table of Materials) to a fresh PCR tube.\n\t\tNOTE: A 96 well PCR plate and an automatic pipette can be used if there are many samples. The manufacturer's protocol states that 1 µL can used per sample.",
    "Take 5 µL of the lysis solution and stop solution mix from step 2.8 and add it to the fresh PCR tube containing the reverse transcription mix.\n\t\tNOTE: The manufacturer's protocol states that 1 µL of RNA (2.5 pg/μL–250 ng/μL) can be used per reaction. A negative RT control per plate can be added by replacing the reverse transcription mix with 5 µL of lysed sample and 1.25 µL of RNAse-free water.\nRun the samples using the following reverse transcription program on a thermocycler: 25 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 30 min, 85 °C for 5 min and 4 °C for ∞.\n\t\tNOTE: The cDNA produced can be stored at -20 °C before proceeding to amplification and data collection using high-throughput qPCR.\nReverse transcription for bulk samples (15−30 worms)\n\t\nIn an RNase-free hood, prepare a master mix consisting of 12.5 µL of 2x RT buffer, 1.25 µL of 20x RT enzyme buffer, and 0.25 µL of nuclease-free water per sample. Add 14 µL of master mix to 11 µL of lysis solution and stop solution mix from step 2.8.\n\t\tNOTE: When dealing with a large number of samples this can be performed in 96 well plates. \nRun the samples through a thermocycler using the following reverse transcription program: 37 °C for 60 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and 4 °C for ∞.\nDilute the produced cDNA 1:4 in nuclease-free water.",
    "NOTE: Generally, the products come to a final volume of 25 µL, in which case 75 µL should be added. However, due to condensation the final volume can vary. Therefore, adjust accordingly to make a 1:4 ratio in the final solution. This dilution step does not apply if performing qPCR on single worms. The cDNA produced can be stored at -20 °C before proceeding to amplification and data collection using high-throughput qPCR.\n4. Preparing the multiplex primer mix\nPrepare a forward/reverse (F/R) primer stock for each pair of primers at 50 µM final concentration. Mix the same volume of forward and reverse primers at 100 µM each.\nCombine 1 µL of 50 µM F/R primer stock for each primer pair to be tested. Add the DNA suspension buffer up to a total volume of 100 µL.\n\tNOTE: The stock primer concentrations here differ from those described in the manufacturer’s protocol16 but retain the same final concentration of 500 nM.\n5. Target specific preamplification\nPrepare a master mix containing 1 µL of preamplification mastermix (Table of Materials), 0.5 µL of the pooled primer mix (step 4.2), and 2.25 µL of nuclease-free water per reaction with a 10% overall surplus volume.\nIn a 96 well plate, aliquot 3.75 µL of the master mix into as many wells as required for the number of samples to be run.\nAdd 1.25 µL of the cDNA solutions of interest generated at step 3.1.3 or 3.2.3 to each well.\nCover the plate with 96 well sealing tape, briefly vortex, and centrifuge with a tabletop plate spinner. Transfer to a thermocycler and run the following program: 95 °C for 2 min, 15 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing/extension at 60 °C for 4 min, and 4 °C for ∞.",
    "NOTE: The manufacturer recommends from 10−20 cycles for the preamplification reaction16. This protocol recommends 10 or 15 cycles depending on the expression levels of the target genes.\n6. Exonuclease I treatment\nNOTE: This is to remove unincorporated primers from preamplification.\nPrepare an exonuclease I mix containing 0.2 µL of exonuclease I reaction buffer (Table of Materials), 0.4 µL of exonuclease I at 20 U/µL (Table of Materials), and 1.4 µL of nuclease-free water per sample. Keep all reagents on ice, especially the exonuclease I.\nRemove the 96 well plate (step 5.4) from the thermocycler, centrifuge with the tabletop plate spinner, and carefully remove the seal. Add 2 µL of the exonuclease I mix to each preamplification reaction. Reseal, centrifuge, and place the 96 well plate back into the thermocycler using the following program: 37 °C for 30 min, 80 °C for 15 min, and 4 °C for ∞.\nTake the samples out of the thermocycler and dilute them 1:5 by adding 18 µL of 1x Tris EDTA buffer (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: It is possible to keep the cDNA samples at -20 °C for later use. The manufacturer’s protocol suggests potential dilutions of 5x, 10x, or 20x at this stage16, depending on the expression level of the targets of interest.\n7. Preparing the assay mixes\nNOTE: Assay mixes can be prepared in 384 well plates, as the wells have the same spacing as the nanofluidic chips, making loading easier.\nPreparing assay mixes for a multi-array chip\n\t\nPrepare a master mix consisting of 2 µL of 2x assay loading reagent (Table of Materials) and 1.6 µL of DNA suspension buffer (Table of Materials) for each well according to the prepared plan. Aliquot 3.6 µL of this master mix per well into a 384 well plate.",
    "Add 0.4 µL of the 50 µM F/R primer stock prepared in step 4.1 to the appropriate wells according to the prepared plan.\n\t\tNOTE: This provides a total of 4 µL of assay mix per well, with a surplus of 1 µL.\nPreparing assay mixes for a single-array chip\n\t\nPrepare a master mix consisting of 3 µL of 2x assay loading reagent and 2.4 µL of DNA suspension buffer for each well according to the prepared plan. Aliquot 5.4 µL of this master mix per well into a marked 384 well plate.\nAdd 0.6 µL of the 50 µM F/R primer stock to the appropriate wells according to the prepared plan.\n\t\tNOTE: This provides a total of 6 µL of assay mix per well, with a surplus of 1 µL.\n8. Preparing the sample mixes\nNOTE: Sample mixes can be prepared up to 1 day in advance and stored at 4 °C.\nPreparing samples for a multi-array chip\n\t\nPrepare a sample master mix consisting of 2 µL of 2x fluorescent probe supermix with low ROX (Table of Materials) and 0.2 µL of sample reagent (Table of Materials) per sample. Dispense 2.2 µL of this mix into the marked 384 well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: The manufacturer recommends not vortexing the sample reagent16.\nPipette 1.8 µL of each preamplified, exonuclease I treated sample from step 3.2.3 into the appropriate wells according to the prepared plan.\n\t\tNOTE: This gives a total of 4 µL, with a surplus of 1 µL.\nPreparing samples for a single-array chip\n\t\nPrepare a sample master mix consisting of 3 µL of 2x fluorescent probe supermix with low ROX (Table of Materials) and 0.3 µL of 20x DNA-binding dye sample loading reagent (Table of Materials) per sample. Dispense 3.3 µL of this mix into the marked 384 well plate.",
    "Pipette 2.7 µL of each preamplified and exonuclease I treated sample from step 6.3 into the appropriate wells according to the prepared plan.\n\t\tNOTE: This gives a total of 6 µL, with a surplus of 1 µL. If there are any wells to be run without a sample these must be loaded with sample master mix and 2.7 µL of water instead of cDNA. This is recommended for both chip types. The machine needs low ROX in every inlet in order to detect the chip’s grid.\n9. Priming the nanofluidic chip\nNOTE: A multi-array chip only needs to be primed on the first run. If there are subsequent runs of the same chip this stage can be skipped. These steps are the same for both chip types.\nSlowly and carefully, inject the full 150 µL of the control line fluid from the syringes included into the accumulators of the chip. Ensure that no control liquid touches the chip by holding the chip at a 45° angle and holding the tip of the syringe away to avoid spillage.\nRemove the blue protective film from the bottom of the chip.\nPlace the chip into the nanofluidics PCR priming machine (Table of Materials), with the barcode facing outwards. Run the ‘Prime (153x)’ script, which takes ~15–20 min.\n\tNOTE: Turn on the nanofluidics thermocycler (Table of Materials) at this stage, because the camera takes about 10 min to cool down to below 0 °C.\n10. Loading the nanofluidic chip\nRemove the barrier plugs sequentially as loading takes place. This reduces the chance of misloading wells.",
    "Transfer either 3 µL for a multi-array chip or 5 µL for a single-array chip of each primer assay mixes and sample mixes to the corresponding inlets of the nanofluidic chip according to the prepared plan. Make sure not to introduce bubbles, which can cause the total volume transferred to be smaller than desired.\n\tNOTE: If there are any wells that will be run without a primer it is important for these to be loaded with master mix, substituting the primer volume with water. This applies to both chip types. At this stage, it can be easier to place the chip on a dark surface, which will allow the wells to be seen more easily.\n11. Running the nanofluidic chip\nNOTE: The first time running a multi-array chip, set up the tracking file by selecting Tools | Flex Six Usage Tracking, click New, enter a file name, and select a location before clicking Done.\nOpen the data collection software. Click Start New Run. Place the loaded chip into the nanofluidics thermocycler with the barcode facing outwards.\nChoose the project setting if applicable, then click Next | Load. If loading a multi-array chip, select the partitions (arrays) to be run.\nSelect the application Reference Probes, then change the application type to Gene Expression, and change the passive reference to ROX. Select the Single Probe Assay, change the probe type to Eva Green, and click Next.\nSelect the thermal cycling protocol GE FLEX six Fast PCR+Melt v1 to run a multi-array chip, or the protocol GE 96.96 Fast PCR+Melt v2 to run a single-array chip.\nConfirm that Auto Exposure is selected and click Start Run.\n12. Post chip run\nNOTE: This section is only necessary for multi-array chips when not using the entire chip.",
    "Take the chip out of the nanofluidics thermocycler and load into the nanofluidics PCR priming machine and run the Post Run (153x) script, which lasts 5 min.\nLabel the plugs used for personal reference.\n\tNOTE: The chip can now be stored at room temperature and the remaining arrays on the chip can be run within 2 months.\n13. Data cleanup and analysis\nOpen the data in the ‘Real-Time PCR Analysis’ software (Table of Materials). Check the melting peak temperature for every primer pair tested. Eliminate results exhibiting more than one melting temperature peak, for a given primer pair.\n\tNOTE: Multiple peaks only appear occasionally, presumably when primer pairs forms dimers, or from interactions of target primers with other primers in the pooled primer mix.\nExport the data as a ‘heatmap’ spreadsheet file and eliminate failed samples or primers.\nAnalyze data using the standard Delta-Ct method21. For statistical evaluation perform one-way ANOVA on relative expression levels."
