    "The experimental protocols received approval from the Ethics of Animal Experiment Care Committee of Inner Mongolia Medical University (YKD202301172) and adhered to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal care and ethics. The license number for our animal center is NO.110324230102364187. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, each 8 weeks old (200 g ± 20 g), were acquired and housed in a controlled environment with a temperature of 22°C ± 2°C and humidity of 55% ± 15%. The rats were subjected to a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle for 1 week prior to experimentation.\n1. Establishment of CUMS rat model\nGrouping\n\t\nDivide the 24 rats randomly into 2 groups: the control (CON) group, which will not be exposed to isolation or stress, and the model (MOD) group. Each group contains 12 rats.\nHouse the rats in standard cages measuring 55 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm, with 6 rats per cage. Retain the cage assignment throughout the acclimatization period unless otherwise indicated.\nFill each rearing cage with fresh bedding and replace it twice a week.\nConduct a 1-week acclimatization period. Allow the rats unrestricted access to food and water, except during CUMS stressor application. Maintain a constant environment with a temperature of 22°C ± 2°C, humidity of 55% ± 15%, and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle from 08:00 to 20:00, unless otherwise stated.\nPrior to initiating the experiment, handle the rats daily to acclimate them to the researcher and to minimize additional stress during the experimental phase.\nIsolation with chronic unpredictable mild stress\n\t\nConcurrently place the MOD and CON groups in separate rooms. House the MOD group rats individually, while keeping the CON group rats together. Maintain all other conditions constant.",
    "Implement a 28-day stressor regimen25. To prevent habituation and to ensure stressor unpredictability, administer one random stressor per day, avoiding the use of the same stressor on consecutive days.\nRandomly apply one of the following nine stressors26,27 on different days: 24 h water deprivation, 24 h food deprivation, wet padding, cage incline, inversion of the light/dark cycle, cold exposure at 4 °C, heat exposure at 45 °C, 1 min tail clamping, or 15 min shaking at 160 rpm. The specific design is outlined in Table 1.\nDuring the application of stressors, restrict access to food and water for the MOD group, except during the inversion of the light/dark cycle.\nStress methods\n\t\nInitiate the experiment by applying depression stimuli in conjunction with 28-day isolation to all rats, excluding the control group. House these rats in individual cages. Refer to Table 2 for conditions related to depression stimuli.\nTo perform the tail clamp method, secure the tail of a rat from the MOD group and measure the clamping time for a duration of 1 min (n = 12).\nIn the water deprivation method, withhold water from a MOD group rat by removing its feeding bottle and record for 24 h.\nIn the food deprivation method, withhold food from a MOD group rat and record for 24 h.\nFor cold stimulation at 4 °C, place a rat from the MOD group in a bucket of cold water and record for 5 min. Ensure that the water temperature remains consistent throughout the test. At the conclusion of the experiment, dry the rat with a blower and return it to its original cage.\nTo administer 45 °C heat stress, place a MOD group rat in an oven and record for 5 min, ensuring that the temperature remains stable throughout the test.",
    "In the inversion of the light-dark cycle, envelop the cage in a black cloth for 1 hs to simulate daytime darkness. Subsequently, illuminate the cage for 12 h during the night to mimic daylight. Record the rat for 24 h.\nFor the wet padding experiment, introduce 200 mL of water into a cage containing 100 g of padding. House a MOD group rat in the wet cage and record for 24 h. Following the test, dry the rat with a blower and return it to a cage with fresh wood shavings.\nIn the cage incline method, situate a MOD group rat in a cage tilted at a 45° angle against a wall and record for 24 h. Use the cage frame structure to adjust the angle and secure the cage in place.\nFor high-speed shaking, place a MOD group rat in a mechanical shaker set to 160 rpm and record the rat for 15 min. Behavioral testing methods are subsequently utilized to evaluate the successful establishment of the model.\nAfter applying stressors, relocate the MOD group cages from the CUMS room back to the housing room. During the 4-week stress exposure period, maintain the CON group in their home cages situated in the housing room.\nPrecautions during experiments\n\t\nTransfer cages of the MOD group back to the general housing room after applying the stressor in the CUMS room.\nAnimal monitoring during CUMS modeling\n\t\t\nDuring tail clamping, the animal is likely to struggle due to the induced stimulation. Throughout this period, continuously monitor the clamp. If it becomes dislodged, pause the timer, reapply the clamp, and then resume the timer for 1 min.\nDo not administer water and wet bedding simultaneously, as the wet bedding already contains water.",
    "The animal's body temperature and ambient room temperature may raise the water temperature during cold water swimming. Therefore, adjust by adding ice water or ice cubes to maintain a constant water temperature.\nObserve the rats at 30 min intervals during the application of stressors, except during diurnal reversal. Pay special attention to signs of unusual distress, such as shivering, lethargy, or lack of movement. If such symptoms are observed-particularly potential hypothermia during 4 °C cold water swimming and wet bedding-immediately remove the rat from the stressor.\nConduct daily inspections for wounds or other physical or behavioral abnormalities in each rat. If any abnormalities are observed, consult the laboratory veterinarian to determine whether the rat should be excluded from the experiment.\nWeigh each rat every 3 days. If an animal loses more than 20% of its pre-feeding basal body weight, it must be excluded from the experiment.\n2. Behavioral tests\nTo begin, administer the depression stimuli in conjunction with isolation for 28 days to all rats, excluding the control group. House the rats in individual cages. Refer to Table 2 for specifics on the depression stimuli conditions.\nFor the open field test, partition a black box into 25 square sections of equal area. Install a video tracking analysis system in the box. Place the rat in the central square and monitor its horizontal and vertical activities for a duration of 5 min.\n\tNOTE: The dimensions of the box are 500 mm x 500 mm x 300 mm. Activity data will be gathered using the video tracking system to assess anxiety-related behaviors in the rodents when exposed to a novel environment.",
    "Subsequently, tally the number of squares traversed by the rat, using all paws, to quantify horizontal activity. Count instances of standing and grooming as indicators of vertical activity. After each test, sanitize the box using 75% alcohol to eliminate any residual rat odors for subsequent tests.\nNext, anhedonia is assessed through the sucrose preference test. Place two bottles on the cage lid: bottle A contains pure water, while bottle B contains 1% sucrose solution. Allow ad libitum access to both solutions for the rat. Weigh the bottles before and after consumption to calculate the 60 min sucrose preference rates on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. The formula is as follows:\n\tSucrose consumption = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65889/65889eq01.jpg × 100%\nTo measure spatial memory and learning abilities, employ the Morris water maze test. Divide the pool into four quadrants, numbering them from one to four. Place a submerged resting platform 1 cm below the water surface in the third quadrant.\nIntroduce milk to the pool to increase water opacity and maintain a water temperature of approximately 23 °C throughout the experimental procedure.\nPlace each rat in various quadrants of the maze, allowing them 120 s to locate the hidden platform. The rats must rely on spatial memory and learning skills to remember the platform's location. Once they learn the platform's location, they can swim directly to it. Record the latency time using the Morris water maze video tracking system.\nPosition the rat at a fixed location in the pool. If the subject fails to locate the hidden platform within 120 s, record the latency as 120 s.\nFinally, remove the hidden platform, place the rat back into the water, and record the number of zone-crossings over a 120 s period.\n3. Statistical analysis",
    "To assess significant differences in biochemical parameters, employ one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan's post hoc test. Present the data as mean ± standard error (SE) and regard a p-value of less than 0.05 as statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
