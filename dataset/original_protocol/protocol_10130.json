    "All methods described here have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of Boston Medical Center.\n1. System Setup\noSLO System\n\t\nUse a supercontinuum laser source as the system laser source.\n\t\t\nSeparate the visible light range (450-650 nm) from higher wavelength range (650-2000 nm) by a dichroic mirror (DM1). Expand the spectrum with a pair of dispersive prisms after the beam passing through a polarization beam splitter (PBS).\nPlace a slit to select the excitation wavelength range (475-495 nm). Use a reflective mirror to reflect the filtered beam back to the prism pair and then couple the light into a single mode fiber (SMF 1).\nUse a spectrometer to confirm the wavelength selection at the output of the single mode fiber.\nConnect the single mode fiber to two cascaded optical fiber couplers as shown in Figure 2. One of the fiber output port from the second fiber coupler delivers the light to the oSLO system.\nCollimate the laser first in the oSLO system.\n\t\t\nDeflect the laser by a galvanometer mirror (GM1). Relay the laser to a second galvanometer mirror (GM2) by a 1:1 telescope system, and further relay to the pupil of the eye by a 3:1 telescope system.\nInstall a dichroic mirror (DM2) within the 3:1 telescope system to reflect the fluorescence signals.\nMount the 3:1 telescope system and the dichroic mirror (DM2) on a customized dove tail slider to offset the optical axis and create the oblique scanning illumination as shown in Figure 3. Use a caliper to precisely control the offset length as desired.\nFluorescence imaging optical path.\n\t\t\nReflect the fluorescence by the dichroic mirror and relay to the third galvanometer mirror to de-scan the slow scanning.",
    "Relay the light to an imaging objective lens by another 1:1 telescope system. Install the above optics on a translation stage.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Two additional translation stages are installed under the third galvanometer mirror (GM3) to provide redundancy in the degrees of freedom for optimizing the imaging.\nMount a final imaging system on a stage that has three degrees of freedom (rotation, and two axis of translation). Use a planar camera to capture the cross-sectional fluorescence images.\nOptical Coherence Tomography System\n\t\nUse the same supercontinuum laser source as the system laser source.\n\t\t\nSeparate the near infrared (NIR) range (650-900 nm) from the remaining light (650-2000 nm) by another dichroic mirror (DM3). Use a long pass filter to further limit the bandwidth to 800-900 nm. Couple the beam into a single mode fiber (SMF 2).\nConnect the single mode fiber to the other input port of the two cascaded optical fiber couplers to combine with the blue oSLO excitation. Direct the light from the second output port of the second fiber coupler to the OCT reference arm, which has a variable neutral density filter (VNDF), dispersion compensation plates and a reflective mirror.\n\t\tNOTE: The light returned from the reference arm and the eye recombines at the second optical fiber coupler and is delivered to the OCT spectrometer to collect the signal.\nData Acquisition\n\t\nUse a data acquisition system software written in LabVIEW and modified from the scanning protocol of OCTA7,8,9,10. For each B-scan, an 80% duty cycle saw tooth with 500 steps is output by an analog output board (AO1) to control the x' fast scanning mirror, GM2.",
    "Trigger the line scan camera at each step to acquire data for the OCT only when the mirror is in the forward scanning direction. Set the exposure time for the line scan camera to be 17 µs.\nTo acquire the OCTA signal, repeat the measurement 5 times at the same B-scan location.\nSet the AO output rate at 100 kHz, and the OCT A-line rate at 50 kHz. Control the y' slow scanning mirror, GM1, by a ramping waveform. Synchronize the de-scanning mirror, GM3, with GM1 to de-scan the slow scanning.\nTrigger the planar camera by another analog output board (AO2) to capture one fluorescent image at each y' location. Crop the imaging size or bin the neighbor pixels to increase the speed and sensitivity as desired.\n2. System Alignment\nAdjust the slit in the oSLO light source to select the blue excitation wavelength. Use a spectrometer to monitor the spectral range to be around 475-490 nm.\nAdjust the dove tail mount slider to shift the optical axis by ~5 mm. This will result in an offset at the rat pupil by ~1.7 mm, resulting in an oblique angle of ~15° on the retina.\nAdjust the translation stage of the fluorescence detection optics by the same 5 mm.\nAdjust the final fluorescence imaging system to be ~30°.\nMeasure the optical power using a power meter. Make sure the blue oSLO excitation power is ≤0.2 mW and the OCT laser power ≤0.8 mW, which will not cause retina damage.\n\tNOTE: Based on the ANSI standard, the maximum permissive exposure (MPE) to the retina is at the level of ~2mW7,8 in visible light range. According to the formula by Delori et al.9, the MPE for the near infrared light is about two times higher than the visible light, at about 4 mW.",
    "3. In Vivo Animal Experiment\nTransfer a 12-weeks male Long Evans rat into the induction chamber. Anesthetize the rat with 4.5% isoflurane in oxygen for 10 minutes with a flow rate of 2 L/min by an isoflurane vaporizer.\n\t\nConfirm depth of anesthesia as determined by a lack of withdrawal reflex during an interdigital pinch.\nAfter the induction, place the rat on a 5-axis (x, y, z translations, yaw and pitch) holder. Provide supplemental heat by use of a heated stage, circulating warm water blanket or other suitable method in a prolonged experiment. Maintain the anesthesia at 1.5% of isofluorane with a flow rate of 2 liter/minutes during the remaining part of the experiment. When not using an induction chamber with active exhaust, the induction chamber should be placed on a backdraft or downdraft table or under a snorkel to scavenge isoflurane.\nDilate the pupil with 1% Tropicamide ophthalmic solution for 2 minutes. Apply 0.5% Tetracaine HCl ophthalmic solution on the rat's eye for additional local anesthesia, if necessary. Keep the eye moisturized with commercial artificial tears at least once every minute during the experiment.\nInject fluorescein salt (10% w/w) or FITC (10% w/w) diluted in sterile saline (0.1-0.3 mL) through the tail vein with a 1 mL syringe and a 29G needle.\nTurn on the laser source. Place a neutral density filter to attenuate the blue light excitation during alignment. Measure the power of the OCT light to be ~0.8 mW, and the blue light <0.01 mW to avoid the formation of cataracts.",
    "Start the galvanometer scanning and alignment mode. Adjust the height of the eye ball to make a stationary laser spot on the cornea. Adjust the rat eye position to make the rim of the pupil roughly perpendicular to the laser, and offset the laser to the apical center of the eye to about ~1.5 mm.\nFurther adjust the animal holder until OCT images reach optimal quality. In the x' fast scanning direction, make sure that the cross-sectional B-scan image appears flat. When switching to the y' slow scanning direction, make sure the cross-section B-scan image appears tilted, due to the oblique scanning.\nRemove the neutral density filter to the blue light excitation and monitor the real time feed from the camera. Cross sectional fluorescent image should appear showing blood vessels appearing in different depths.\n\t\nAdjust the focus of the final fluorescence imaging system to reach the optimal focus. Allow fine adjustments of the eye position in the lateral plane to reach optimal oSLO image quality.\nAfter the alignment, start to acquire simultaneous OCTA and volumetric fluorescein angiography (vFA).\nConstruct the volumetric images for both OCTA and oSLO by Matlab. The algorithms are previously described in detail10. Generate depth-resolved retinal vasculatures by image segmentation.\nAfter completing the imaging, turn off the laser, release the animal and apply some ophthalmic ointment on the eyes, and then place the animal in a recovery box.\nDo not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency or as per institutional policy.\nSubscription Required.
