    "Expansion and quantification of MNV.CR6 virus stockNote: Culture and infect cells under a biosafety hood in a BSL-2 laboratory. Split the RAW264.7 cells using a cell scraper, once a week at a 1:10 ratio in a T150 flask containing 40 ml of 10% media. Maintain the cells in a CO2 incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Infect the RAW264.7 cells with MNV.CR6 after 2 or 3 days of incubation i.e., when the cells are nearly confluent but not overgrown. Do this as follows:Aspirate the growth medium from cells, wash with DPBS and aspirate the DPBS.Add 1 ml of MNV.CR6 to the cells and distribute evenly, incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Add 20 ml of 2% media and place the flask back in the incubator until the full cytopathic effect is observed (± 2-3 days post-infection).Repeat two freeze-thaw cycles (-80 °C vs. 37 °C), then collect the supernatants containing the virus after centrifugation (10 min, 1,500 x g) and store in aliquots (500-1,000 µl) in cryotubes at -80 °C. Determine the viral titer by endpoint titration as previously described in Reed et al. (1938). This procedure is based on the detection of cytopathic effect (CPE) by microscopy. Note: Titration can be performed with a higher dilution series or extended over a second 96-well plate when the viral stock is strong. Thaw MNV.CR6 stock at room temperature.Add 100 µl of 2% DMEM in all wells of a 96-well plate.Add 50 µl of pure virus stock in the wells B2-G2 of the second column of the 96-well plate.Homogenize the virus and medium with a multichannel pipette.Take 50 µl of the mixture and transfer into the next well.Repeat Steps A4d-A4e until reaching column 9 of the 96 well-plate.Homogenize the virus and medium in row 9 and discard 50 µl.",
    "Add 10,000 RAW 264.7 cells/well in a final volume of 100 µl in 2% DMEM, to the inner 60 wells. Incubate for 72 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Compare the wells with infected cells (columns 2-9) to the wells with non-infected cells (columns 10-11) and evaluate for cytopathic effect (CPE) microscopically. Calculate TCID50 using the Reed-Muench formula (Reed et al., 1938).Oral gavage of MNV.CR6 in miceNotes: Handle infected animals under a biosafety hood in an A-2 animal facility under conditions as close as possible to a specific pathogen free (SPF) facility.Use a protective bench coat to prevent viral contamination of the biosafety hood.Replace gloves between different experimental groups.For all experiments the mice were age- and sex-matched, mice were 8-12 weeks of age.Tag an ear of each mouse with a unique number. Thaw virus and dilute in 2% media to 106 CCID50 (50% cell culture infectious dose) of MNV.CR6. Give each mouse 200 μl of virus via oral gavage (see below).Fill the syringe and feeding tube with virus and remove all air bubbles.Carefully pick up the mouse by the base of its tail, place onto a wire cage.With the other hand, restrain the mouse by holding the scruff between thumb and forefinger. Place the tail between the little finger and ring finger to stretch the mouse (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180502/20180502204510_0636.jpgFigure 1. Correct hand position to hold a mouse for oral gavageNow gently insert the feeding tube vertically down into the esophagus and administer virus in a steady motion (Figure 2). Any resistance felt indicates improper placement of the feeding tube, in which case take out the feeding tube and re-position.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180502/20180502204546_2518.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Vertical insertion of the feeding tube in the esophagus of the mouseAdministration of small molecule inhibitorsNotes:  Handle infected animals under a biosafety hood in an A-2 animal facility under conditions as closely as possible to an SPF facility.Use a protective bench coat to prevent viral contamination of the biosafety hood.Replace gloves between different experimental groups.  Subcutaneous injection of 2’-C-Methylcytidine (100 mg/kg/day) Dissolve 2CMC in sterile saline.Fill the syringe with virus and remove all air bubbles.Hold the mouse by the base of its tail and place it onto a wire cage. Insert the needle parallel to the skin on the back of the mouse. Make sure you are just under the skin (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180502/20180502204830_5056.jpgFigure 3. Subcutaneous injection in the back of the mouseInject the mouse with 2CMC via the subcutaneous route in a steady motion with a volume (~200 µl) that has a final concentration of 100 mg/kg/day.Oral gavage of favipiravir (T-705) (200 mg/kg/day) Dissolve T-705 in 0.4% CMC.Administer the appropriate volume of T-705 via oral gavage with a volume (~200 µl) that has a final concentration of 200 mg/kg/day. Follow up and stool collection Notes: Handle infected animals under a biosafety hood in an A-2 animal facility under conditions as close as possible to an SPF facility.Use a protective bench coat to prevent viral contamination of the biosafety hood.Decontaminate boxes, forceps and scale between different experimental groups.Evaluate the general condition of the animal on a daily basis and check the overall health (weight, behavior, fur). If an animal reaches the defined humane endpoints (loses more than 15% of body weight in 1-2 days or an overall of > 20% in body weight or displays obvious signs of suffering [lethargy, squinted eyes, dehydration, hunched back]), it has to be humanely euthanized according to the European guidelines (Dir. 2010/63/EU).",
    "Place each mouse individually in a clean plastic container awaiting the defecation. Use a forceps to collect one piece of feces and place it in a labeled 1.5 ml tube (Figure 4). Repeat for all mice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180502/20180502205529_7089.jpgFigure 4. Collection of a stool sample in a labeled tubeScore the feces samples for consistency according to the table below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180502/20180502205827_9561.jpgStore stool samples in a -20 °C or -80 °C freezer.Viral RNA extraction from stool samplesNote: Handle infectious samples under a biosafety hood in a BSL-2 laboratory. Extract the viral RNA using the RNeasy mini kit of QIAGEN:Add 400 µl of RLT buffer to each feces sample.Vortex the samples very well until the feces sample is completely homogenized.Spin the tubes for 3 min at 10,000 x g. Transfer 350 µl of the supernatants to a new 1.5 ml tube and add 350 µl of 70% ethanol. Continue according to manufacturer’s protocol.Elute the viral RNA in 50 µl RNase free water. Store the viral RNA in a -20 °C freezer.Quantification of viral RNA by RT-qPCRNote: Prepare the mixtures for the RT-qPCR in a PCR workstation. Prepare the correct concentrations of primers, probe and the standard dilution (108 to 100 RNA copies). Thaw viral RNA samples and components of the one-step iTaq Universal Probes kit.Prepare for each sample a one-step RT-qPCR mix, a total of 16 µl containing: 10 µl iTaq Universal Probes reaction mix, 0.5 µl of iScript advanced reverse transcriptase, RNase free water, 900 nM of MNV primers and 200 nM of MNV probe. Gently vortex and briefly centrifuge the mix.In each well of the 96 RT-qPCR well plate, pipet 16 µl of the mix (using a multipipette) and add 4 µl of viral RNA. Close the RT-qPCR plate properly with a plastic seal.",
    "Place the RT-qPCR plate in a LightCycler and run with the following cycling conditions: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 10 min, initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 sec, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 sec. For the absolute quantification, use a 10-fold dilution series of the MNV DNA standard with known concentration.c"
