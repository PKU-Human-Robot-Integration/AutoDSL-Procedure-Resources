    "1. Propagation and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells\nPreparation of media for cell growth and maintenance\n\t\nPrepare complete, high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate) supplemented with a final 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic (10,000 units/mL penicillin, 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL Amphotericin B), and varying amounts of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (see Table of Materials). FBS amounts in differentiation media vary between final 10%, 5%, or 2% (v/v) FBS.\nCell maintenance\n\t\nMaintain the cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and place them at 37 °C and 5% CO2, then seed in DMEM containing 5% (v/v) FBS for differentiation. Frozen cell stocks were stored in FBS with 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 1-2 x 107 cells/mL.\nPreparation of retinoic acid (RA)\n\t\nDissolve 7.51 mg all-trans-RA (see Table of Materials) in 5 mL of freshly prepared 95% ethanol to obtain 5 mM stock solution. Verify concentration with absorbance at 350 nm (ɛ = 44,300 M-1 cm-1), obtained from the product information sheet from the manufacturer's protocol81, using a dilution of the stock solution at 5 µM in ethanol. Store 5 mM stock protected from light at 4 °C for up to 6 weeks.\nPreparation of poly-D-lysine for coverslip coating\n\tNOTE: The poly-D-lysine (PDL) product protocol, found under the Documents & Downloads section of vendor site82, provides information for coating a variety of culture vessels.\n\t\nThis protocol includes volumes based on a 2-well chambered vessel with an area of 4 cm2 per well with sterile #1.5 borosilicate coverglass bottoms (see Table of Materials). Dilute the stock solution of PDL twofold to 50 µg/mL with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS; no calcium, no magnesium).",
    "NOTE: #1.5 or #1.5H coverglass are both acceptable thicknesses, which are essential for image quality. Other thicknesses will induce spherical aberration and should be avoided.\nCoverslip coating with PDL\n\tNOTE: Coverslips can be exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for 10-15 min in a biosafety cabinet for further sterilization.\n\t\nApply 1.2 mL of 50 µg/mL PDL solution to each well of sterile chambered coverslips in a cell culture cabinet and incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Remove the PDL solution and rinse thrice with 3.6 mL distilled water. After completing the final wash, allow the coated chamber to dry for 2 h exposed to air before rinsing and using immediately or storing with an air-tight container at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Rinse the coverslips thoroughly as excess PDL can be toxic to cells.\nDifferentiation of SH-SY5Y cells with RA\n\tNOTE: Do not use cells above passage 15. Cells are passaged at 80%-90% confluency. Differentiation procedures differ but follow similar steps. Additional differentiation from neuroblastomas to mature neurons is obtained with further treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)68,83,84,85, but was not performed in this protocol.\n\t​OPTIONAL: Establish cells for at least 24 h prior to seeding on coverglass. To prepare cells from frozen stocks, rapidly thaw 1 mL frozen vial of cells and add to 9 mL prewarmed media supplemented with 10% FBS, then spin down at 350 x g for 10 min (at room temperature) and discard supernatant to remove DMSO. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of prewarmed media and seed cells in a T-25 flask. Once cells reach 80%-90% confluency, passage cells by counting and seeding them for differentiation when applicable.\n\t\nDay 0: Seed cells.",
    "Seed the cells onto a chambered coverglass from frozen stocks or a working flask. Use a seeding density of 1.5 x 104 cells/cm2.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: A single well in a standard 2-well chambered coverglass with 4 cm2 of culture area will require 6.0 x 104 cells. Cells that will remain undifferentiated should be seeded with DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, and cells that will be differentiated should be seeded with DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS.\nDay 1: Start RA differentiation treatment.\n\t\t\nPrepare DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic, and a final concentration of 10 µM RA or ethanol of the same additive volume to serve as the vehicle control for this differentiation procedure. Remove the media in the chambered coverglass used for seeding, rinse with 1x PBS, and add the new DMEM to the wells.\nDay 3: Replace media with fresh RA- or ethanol-containing media.\n\t\t\nRemove media from Day 1 and replace with fresh media supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic, and either 10 µM RA or 95% ethanol of the same additive volume to serve as the vehicle control for this differentiation procedure. Remove the media in the chambered coverglass used for seeding, rinse with 1x PBS, and add new media to the wells.\nDay 6: Perform the imaging of the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell differentiation times vary by protocol, but six days of exposure to RA is sufficient to induce a neuron-like phenotype in SH-SY5Y cells86.\n\t\t\nPerform live imaging, with details in Sections 3 and 4 (Figure 2).\n2. Primary rat hippocampal neuron culture\nMaterials preparation for rat hippocampal neuron isolation.\n\t\nPrepare fresh supplemented DMEM.",
    "Filter-sterilize a mixture of DMEM (high glucose, no sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate solution, and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 U/mL). Store for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C.\nPrepare fresh supplemented neuron growth media.\n\t\t\nFilter-sterilize a mixture of neuron growth media supplemented with 2% (v/v) B27 supplement, 0.25% (v/v) glutamine supplement, and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (see Table of Materials). Store for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C.\nPrepare primary hippocampal neuron culture.\n\t\nPrepare primary hippocampal neuron culture following previously published work87 and from the product protocol on the manufacturer's site from which the dissected E18 rat hippocampus is obtained88 (see Table of Materials). This protocol results in a mostly neuronal population with <2% astrocytes.\n\t\tNOTE: The hibernate media with which this tissue is shipped will be used for future steps in this protocol. Do not discard it.\nPrepare materials and media for tissue dissociation.\n\t\t\nFlame a Pasteur pipette to decrease the aperture diameter and store it in foil to prevent contamination until use. Prewarm the prepared DMEM, 1X Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS), and neuron growth media to 37 °C. Add 2 flakes of DNAase with sterile tweezers to a 15 mL conical tube.\nPerform tissue dissociation.\n\t\t\nRemove as much of the hibernate media the dissected E18 rat hippocampus is stored in as possible before placing the tissue into the 15 mL conical tube containing DNAase and incubating briefly at 37 °C. Add 900 µL of 1X HBSS followed by 100 µL of 0.5% trypsin. Incubate the tissue at 37 °C for 15 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: PDL coated plates can be removed from storage and placed in an incubator until use during this incubation time.\nPerform tissue homogenization and cell counting.",
    "Following incubation with trypsin, remove the media and add 1 mL prewarmed hibernate media-DNAase from the previous step to the tissue and homogenize with the Pasteur pipette. The media will look opaque and then gradually clear as homogenization continues.\nAdd dissociated neurons to a new tube with 4 mL prewarmed DMEM and then count the cells using a cell counter.\nPerform cell plating and growth of primary cells.\n\t\t\nPlate cells at a density of approximately 1.65 x 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM. For a 2-well chambered coverglass (4 cm2), seed 65,000 – 70,000 cells per well with 2 mL DMEM. Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h before checking for adherence. Once cells begin to adhere, remove 1 mL of media and replace it with the same volume of hibernate media, then gently agitate to mix. Once the media is mixed, repeat this process and remove half of the media present and replace with the same volume of neuron growth media, then gently mix.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The day of plating is considered day in vitro (DIV) 0, and cells are ready to image at DIV 7 (Figure 2).\n3. Preparation of cells for live cell imaging\nNOTE: Cell types and origin (i.e., cultured and primary cells) can differ in staining requirements; see published reports for more details62,63.\nPreparation of PKmito Orange\n\tNOTE: Other dyes that generally stain the IMM have been reported64,65,66 and are commercially available. PKMO is the only one used in this protocol.",
    "Resuspend powder PKMO (see Table of Materials) in DMSO as per the manufacturer's instructions89. Aspirate the media from cells and wash in prewarmed phenol-red free media. Prepare a stock of PKMO in prewarmed, phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS or 10% (v/v) depending on differentiation state, HEPES to a final concentration of 20 mM, and 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic before staining the cells following the manufacturer's instructions. This formulation, without PKMO, is the live cell imaging media.\nCell staining with PKMO\n\t\nIncubate the cells with the dye at 37 °C and 5% CO2, for 30 min. Wash cells thrice with live cell imaging media, and for the final wash incubate for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAdd fresh, prewarmed live cell imaging media. The cells are now ready for imaging.\n\t\t​NOTE: Acute treatments (e.g., drugs and/or stressors), when used, are added before live imaging; see the Discussion section and Supplementary Figure 1.\n4. Imaging live cells by STED microscopy\nNOTE: This protocol uses a STED system built around an inverted microscope, with the system specified in the Table of Materials. This system is equipped with pulsed excitation lasers (561 nm laser with nominal power ~300 µW) and a pulsed 775 nm STED depletion laser (nominal power 1.2 W), a continuously adjustable galvano scanner, and a 615/20 nm filter-based avalanche photodiode detector (APD). A 100x/1.40 oil immersion lens for STED is used here. Lightbox software is used for image acquisition. All details provided are related directly to this software and system setup.\nGeneral guidelines and steps for imaging\n\t\nUse a stage-top incubator or environmental chamber to maintain cell viability, but short-term room-temperature experiments are also acceptable. These steps are specific to the STED setup described above.\nSelect the laser and filter sets for imaging.",
    "Use parameters for an orange dye by selecting the dye(s) used in the staining from the Dye List, or the one with spectral properties closest to the dye(s) used. Make these active by double-clicking or dragging them to the sample list, where it says “Drag dye(s) here.”\nSelect a region to image.\n\t\t\nIn an overview, create a region of interest (ROI) around a mitochondrion of interest by selecting the rectangular ROI button and clicking and dragging to shape the region. The ROI can be resized and rotated using the ROI corners or curved edges that appear while hovering the mouse over a corner.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A summary of the suggested imaging parameters can be found in Table 1. These parameters were empirically adjusted using those previously reported for this STED setup and dye combination63.\nSet up gating.\n\t\t\nNext to the General menu, select the Gating menu or click and hold to add the menu to the view. It is recommended that STED detector gating be adjusted to 1-1.05 to 7.8-7.85 ns, as presented here. Gating times can vary and be as short as 1-1.05 to 7-7.05 ns.\nAdjust the intensity appropriately according to the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Generally, the excitation power used for STED is 2-3 times the power used for confocal, so a sample requiring 5% excitation laser power for confocal can use 10%-15% excitation laser power during STED acquisition.\n\t\t\nSet the excitation laser for STED to 15%-20% and the STED depletion laser to 20%-25% with 10 line accumulations. Use a pixel dwell time of 4 µs with a pixel size of 20-25 nm. The pinhole was kept at 1.0 AU for cultured cells and 0.7 AU for primary rat hippocampal cells in order to improve optical sectioning in the more densely packed mitochondria.",
    "NOTE: Confocal and STED images can both be acquired for side-by-side comparison (Figure 3A, B, Figure 4A) or only STED can be acquired.\nAdditional information for time series/z-series\n\t\nSelect the time series.\n\t\t\nSelect the Time drop-down menu. Define the number of iterations (5 used here) and time interval (25 or 30 s used here) desired for a timelapse (Figure 3C, D, Figure 4B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the interval is shorter than the acquisition time, the iterations will continue without any delay. When performing a timelapse, engaging a perfect focus unit or similar focus tracking is highly recommended to avoid potential drift.\nSet the volume range.\n\t\t\nSet the z-volume range as desired by enabling the Volume option and adjusting the two ends of the range. Step sizes used in this protocol for 2D imaging were 150-200 nm. Recommended step size with respect to Nyquist sampling required for deconvolution of raw STED can be calculated with online tools90.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The STED depletion laser power and the number of planes imaged can increase dye photobleaching and light exposure to the cell to harmful levels. Check for signs of phototoxicity and photodamage after acquisition.\n5. Processing and analytical tools for mitochondrial ultrastructure\nNOTE: Image processing (i.e., deconvolution) is optional but typically used when making and analyzing STED images for publication. Deconvolution to improve contrast and reduce noise is highly suggested for optimal segmentation of individual cristae, as described below (Figure 2).\nSTED image deconvolution\n\tNOTE: The software used for deconvolution in this protocol is provided in the Table of Materials.\n\t\nSet the microscopic parameters of the image.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that microscope metadata is entered correctly in the image Microscopic Parameters. This includes mounting medium refractive index; immersion medium; pixel size; excitation, emission, and depletion wavelengths; and any other relevant information. Templates with these parameters can be saved for reuse.\nDeconvolute raw STED images with the software algorithm.\n\t\t\nAccess to automated deconvolution algorithms in deconvolution software allows hands-off deconvolution image processing. Select the Express button and set the deconvolution type to Fast, Standard, Aggressive, or Conservative for varying degrees of deconvolution power. Representative images using Express Deconvolution with Aggressive settings are shown (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5).\nSave the images from the deconvolution software in ICS2 format.\nFor manual deconvolution, perform the following steps.\n\t\t\nBriefly, when performing manual deconvolution, save the deconvolution wizard templates for consistency and have the option to load a template upon starting the wizard. Use measured point spread function (PSF) information if generated with acquisition setup and parameters.\nCrop raw STED image, if needed, before having the deconvolution software auto-stabilize the image. Add-ons to deconvolution software packages allow specific compensation of possible imaging artifacts such as thermal drift and chromatic aberrations.\nNext, generate a logarithmic histogram to manually or automatically perform background subtraction. Select the classic maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) deconvolution algorithm.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For deconvolution, the key values to adjust are the signal-to-noise ratio threshold, the number of iterations, and the quality threshold. These values can be adjusted, and the deconvolution can be previewed to determine optimal settings.\nSegmentation and particle analysis\n\tNOTE: This protocol uses FIJI (Is Just ImageJ), an open-source software (see Table of Materials), for segmentation and analysis. Other comparable software, including CellProfiler, Icy, Ilastik, and QuPath, is available for these purposes.\n\t\nPrepare images for segmentation.",
    "Open the .obf raw STED images or .ics2 files from the deconvolution software by going to File → Open or clicking and dragging the files to the ImageJ toolbar. From here, any processing that makes images easier to segment can be performed before segmentation.\nTo keep changes consistent, record functions using Plugins  → Macros  → Record and copy and paste key commands into a new macro, from Plugins  → New  → Macro. Ensure to select the image to process before running the macro.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Commonly acceptable alterations for quantitation of size and shape include cropping, projecting a z-stack, and background subtraction with smoothing disabled. Alterations should be performed consistently among images within a data set and reported.\nAdjust Trainable Weka Segmentation Settings\n\t\tNOTE: Additional details with step-by-step instructions for using the semi-automated segmentation tool and downstream analyses for mitochondria have been published91.\n\t\t\nOpen the deconvolved STED images in the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS)92 plugin, located under Plugins → Segmentation → Trainable Weka Segmentation. In the segmentation Settings, select the Gaussian blur, membrane projections, and Sobel filter features. The membrane thickness default is 1, and the membrane patch size default is 19.\nLabel either class 1 or 2 as the \"Cristae\" and the other as the \"Background\" (Figure 2). Models can also be saved with the Save classifier button. Select the Load classifier to reuse these settings for other images.\nPerform TWS class traces.\n\t\t\nUse the line tool or other shapes to highlight some of the cristae or background. At least some background selections should include spaces between the cristae. Draw a line over the structure to assign to either class, then select the Add to button on the right-hand side for either cristae or background. Double-click on a trace to remove the structure from that label.\nPerform TWS classification training.",
    "Select the Train classifier button on the left-hand side to generate a map based on the information provided to the plugin. The overlay of segmented classes can be toggled on and off with the Toggle Overlay button, and the opacity of the overlay can be adjusted in Settings. The classifier can be retrained with additional labels. Once satisfied, select the Get Probability button.\nMeasure the particles.\n\t\t\nUsing the cristae probability map, threshold the image to generate a mask and then go to Analyze → Analyze Particles. Generally, the default threshold type can be used and the range adjusted to ensure the entire cristae are accounted for. The measurements provided by analyzing particles can be adjusted by Analyze → Set Measurements.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Examples of size and shape parameters such as area, perimeter, circularity and aspect ratio of the cristae are measured and displayed based on the selected measurements (Figure 2, Figure 5A, Supplementary Table 1).\nOPTIONAL: Select the raw STED image with the same dimensions as the deconvolved image and apply the ROIs from the manager, then select Measure in the ROI manager to obtain intensity values.\nObtain line plots.\n\t\t\nLine plots were generated from the deconvolved STED images. Draw a multi-point line, adjust the line thickness to several pixels wide to average out noise, and spline the line to fit the mitochondria (Figure 2, Figure 5B). The resulting line plot generated is used to measure peak-to-peak distances to report the periodicity and distribution of cristae over a certain range.",
    "NOTE: Relatedly, cristae density can be reported as the count of independent cristae within a given area as determined by measuring the outer part of the mitochondria. The mitochondrial area can be determined by applying a filter to the deconvolved or raw STED image to generate a mask. Ensure that the mask accurately fits the outline of the mitochondria before measuring the area."
