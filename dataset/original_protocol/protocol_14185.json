    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of Pittsburgh.\n1. Isolation of Rat Glomeruli\nTo prepare a sterile 1% isolation buffer, add 5 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to a 600 mL beaker.\n\t\nAdd 500 mL of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the beaker and stir with a magnetic stirring rod until all BSA is dissolved.\nSterile filter the 1% BSA/PBS buffer in a cell culture hood.\n\t\t​NOTE: The sterile 1% BSA/PBS buffer can be kept at 4 °C for up to a week.\nObtain 2 to 4 Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150 to 200 g each.\n\t\nEuthanize rats via carbon dioxide inhalation using a chamber in which 100% carbon dioxide is introduced at a rate of 10-30% of the chamber volume per minute. Observe animals for cessation of respiration and faded eye color before removal from carbon dioxide.\nPrepare the skin over the anterior abdomen with 70% ethanol and utilize hair clippers to remove hair, if desired. Make a midline incision in the skin using surgical scissors or scalpel. Make another midline incision through the muscle layer to expose internal organs. Extend the incision superiorly through the diaphragm and sternum or rib cage as a secondary method of euthanasia.\nIsolate and remove both kidneys and place into a sterile 50 mL plastic conical tube with 30 mL of Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS) on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Several rats can be euthanized in the same chamber and all of the kidneys can be placed in the same conical tube.",
    "Keep the kidneys on ice and transport to a sterile cell culture hood. Transfer the kidneys to a sterile Petri dish containing 5 mL of HBSS, also over ice, and remove and discard perirenal fat with scissors and sharp forceps. If still present, also remove and discard the capsule surrounding the kidney by making a small superficial incision and then use sharp forceps to gently pull it away from the organ.\n\tNOTE: Always keep kidney isolates on ice and practice sterile technique throughout. A piece of sterile gauze can be placed in the Petri dish as a textured surface to hold the kidney in place during manipulation.\n\t\nCut kidneys in half lengthwise (midsagittal section) and remove and discard the medulla (which is darker in color) with a scalpel in a second Petri dish with 5 mL of HBSS.\nTransfer the remaining pieces, which are predominantly kidney cortex, into a third Petri dish with 5 mL of HBSS and mince with a sterile razor blade until the pieces are less than 1 mm in size, or until a paste is formed.\nWet the top and bottom of a 180 µm sieve with 1% BSA/PBS over a 500 mL waste beaker. This step is critical as it coats the sieve with protein and reduces adherence of glomeruli, which will improve yield.\nPlace the minced cortex on a small edge of the sieve and use the textured plunger flange (the side opposite the rubber seal) of a 10 mL syringe to mush the tissue through the sieve into a bottom pan sitting on ice. Rinse periodically with HBSS but use as little as possible to avoid sample dilution.",
    "NOTE: Do not exceed 30 mL of buffer total, so only 25 mL more can be used here. The reason for placing the minced tissue on only one edge of the sieve is to reduce adherence of glomeruli by limiting exposure to part of the sieve rather than the entire sieve surface area.\n\t\nTo facilitate this, reuse the fluid collecting in the bottom pan to rinse the sieve. Once sieving is complete, carefully wash the bottom of the sieve once more with 1% BSA/PBS buffer from the bottom of the pan to capture any glomeruli that may be loosely adhered.\nCollect all of the fluid in the bottom pan into several 10 mL syringes equipped with 20 G needles and pass it through the needle at least 2 additional times. On the last collection, keep the glomeruli-containing fluid in the syringe until ready to pass it through the 90 µm sieve.\nWhile the fluid is stored in the syringes, wash the bottom pan by flushing with 1% BSA/PBS into waste beaker and wet the top and bottom of a 90 µm sieve with 1% BSA/PBS. Place the sieve on top of the bottom pan on ice.\n\t\nApply the sample in the syringes to one edge of the sieve and mush through the sieve with another syringe flange as describe above. Wash with solution from the bottom pan to collect everything on one edge of the sieve.\nOnce sieving is complete, carefully wash the bottom of the sieve as in step 1.5.1. Collect all the fluid in the bottom pan in a 50 mL plastic conical tube.",
    "Wash the bottom pan with 1% BSA/PBS into a waste beaker and wet the top and bottom of a 75 µm sieve with 1% BSA/PBS. Place the sieve on top of the bottom pan on ice.\n\t\nApply the sample to one edge of the sieve. Liquid should flow through easily. Rinse through the top with at least 20 mL of 1% BSA/PBS into waste beaker. Carefully wash the bottom of the sieve as well. The glomeruli will remain on the top of this 75 µm sieve.\nUse HBSS to collect glomeruli in a Petri dish by rinsing through the sieve upside down. Use as much HBSS as needed here. Collect into one or more 50 mL plastic conical tube(s) on ice.\nCentrifuge at 1800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, remove supernatant carefully with a pipette, and resuspend pellet in 10 mL of cold HBSS. Combine the samples if multiple conical tubes were collected in 1.7.2. Repeat the centrifugation step.\nResuspend the glomeruli in 5 mL of HBSS until ready to proceed to the next step.\nIf desired, take a count of the total glomeruli. For this, take a 10 µL sample with a pipette and place the drop on a glass slide. View under a microscope, count the glomeruli in the field and multiply by 500 to get total yield.\n\tNOTE: Purity may be determined by counting the number of tubules seen in the field and dividing by total number of glomeruli and tubule structures. There should be > 95% glomeruli in the visual field.\n\t\nIf there is significant tubular contamination, repeat steps 1.6.1 onward, and make sure to wash thoroughly when completing step 1.7.1. This is the step in which tubular contamination is most likely to occur.\n2. Injury of Glomeruli",
    "Collect the glomeruli in a 15 mL plastic conical tube and spin down at 200 x g. Resuspend in an appropriate amount of HBSS based on the total yield so that there are approximately 9,000 glomeruli per well. Pipette 450 µL of sample into each well of a 24-well plate, or any plate format that fits the downstream assays required.\n\tNOTE: Pipetting up and down to mix glomeruli in buffer ensures a homogeneous solution. The glomeruli are very sticky and heavy and will stick to each other as well as settle at the bottom of a solution quickly and onto the sides of the tube.\nTo make 6 mg/mL protamine sulfate (PS) solution, first dissolve 1 g of PS into 10 mL of dH2O heated to 40 °C in a 15 mL plastic conical tube and vortex thoroughly. Take 30 µL of the solution and add to 470 µL of dH2O.\n\tNOTE: This will produce a 6 mg/mL solution, and when 50 µL are added to the well as described below, the final concentration is 0.6 mg/mL.\n\t\nIn duplicate, add 50 µL of protamine sulfate (this is a 1:10 dilution) to each well of one group, while supplying another group 50 µL of HBSS (negative control).\nIncubate the plate for 4 h at 37 °C.\nSpin down contents of each well in a microcentrifuge tube (4000 x g, 4 °C, 10 - 15 s) and wash twice with 1 mL of PBS each.\nAspirate off the final wash and resuspend in 300 µL of PBS. Split into three aliquots to be prepared for protein isolation, transmission electron microscope (TEM) visualization, and immunofluorescence staining (IF).\n3. Preparing Glomeruli for Analysis",
    "Spin down the contents of the three aliquots (4000 x g, 4 °C, 10 - 15 s) and aspirate off remaining buffer and proceed to sample analysis by TEM, IF, or protein isolation.\nProcessing for TEM\n\t\nFix glomerular pellets in 150 µL of cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.01 M PBS. Remove the fixative carefully from the pellet using a Pasteur pipette, making sure not to disrupt the pellet, then rinsed it with PBS and post-fix it in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1% potassium ferricyanide.\nDehydrate the sample through a graded series of ethanol (30, 50, 70, 90, 100, 100, 100%) and propylene oxide then embed in epoxy embedding material.\nCut semi-thin (300 nm) sections on an ultramicrotome. Stain with 0.5% Toluidine Blue in 1% sodium borate and examine them under the light microscope.\nCut ultrathin sections (65 nm), stain them with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and examine on a transmission electron microscope.\nProcessing for IF\n\t\nAdd 150 µL of a 12% gelatin in PBS solution and immediately place on dry ice to form a pellet. Soak the pellet in 500 µL of 2% paraformaldehyde/1x PBS in a microcentrifuge tube overnight at 4 °C.\nPlace the pellet in a base mold and embed by adding optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium over dry ice. Cut 5-10 µm sections on a cryotome and proceed with immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry or standard histological stains.\nFor Protein Isolation\n\t\nAdd 150 µL of RIPA buffer to centrifuged glomerular pellet with 1.5 µL of protease inhibitor and dounce with tissue homogenizers.\nProceed to protein quantification and immunoblotting or other protein analysis."
