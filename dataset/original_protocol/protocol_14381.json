    "1. Preparation\nAssemble the imaging chamber, which consists of two parts.\nPlace a 25-mm cover glass (Figure 1A-1) at the bottom part of the chamber (Figure 1A-2) and screw the top part into the bottom part (Figure 1A-3). Do not tighten too hard, as the glass can break. Autoclave the entire chamber (Figure 1A-4).\nPrepare cell culture medium by supplementing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) without phenol red with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1 mM L-glutamine under sterile conditions. Store at 4 °C and warm to 37 °C before use.\nMaintain the cells with cell culture medium in culturing flasks using standard cell culture techniques.\n\tNOTE: Here, two mouse cell lines, melanoma B16BL611 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and two human melanomas, BLM and 1F612, were used.\nMake 0.1% gelatin by weighing and dissolving gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C overnight. Sterilize the solution by filtering it through a 0.22-µm filter and store it at 4 °C.\n2. Plate Cells\nRemove the imaging chamber from the sterilization bag in a laminar flow cabinet, carefully tighten the chamber, and place it in a petri dish.\n\tNOTE: To avoid contamination, keep the imaging chamber in a petri dish until the chamber can be placed under the microscope.\nCoat the glass of the imaging chamber with 1 mL of 0.1% sterile gelatin for 20 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: This will allow better cell attachment.\nRemove the medium from the cell culture flasks (see steps 1.2 and 1.3), wash once with 1x PBS, and detach the cells using 0.25% trypsin. Inactivate the trypsin by adding cell culture medium, collect the cells, spin them down at 1,100 x g for 5 min, and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of cell culture medium.",
    "Dilute 20 µL of cell suspension with 20 µL of trypan blue (which will be taken up by dead cells). Count the number of living and dead cells using a hemocytometer; the number of dead cells should not exceed 10%.\nAspirate the gelatin and plate the cells in a dilution that allows for a maximum of 70% coverage within 24 h. For example, use a dilution of 5 x 104 or 10 x 104 cells in 1 mL. Allow the cells to adhere at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 24 h.\n3. Time-lapse Microscopy (Figure 2)\nNOTE: Here, a confocal microscope with a custom-made stage holder was used, although most manufactures offer a range of incubators for live-cell imaging that are also suitable to investigate nanoparticulated drug delivery.\nEvaluate the cells under a microscope for confluency, cellular morphology, and contamination. Place the chamber back in the CO2 incubator.\n\tNOTE: The confluency should not exceed 70%. If the cellular morphology is inconsistent (i.e., the cells do not adhere) or contamination is detected, discard the imaging chamber.\nSwitch on the confocal microscope (Figure 1E-1), fluorescent light (Figure 1E-2), and computer (Figure 1E-3).\nConnect the lens heater to the objective and set it to 35 °C (Figure 1E-4 + insert).\nPrepare the incubation unit, as shown in Figure 1B.\n\tNOTE: This unit consists of a heated stage (Figure 1B-1), a flow stage with a connector for the CO2 tubes (Figure 1B-2) and CO2 probe (Figure 1B-3), and a red closing patch (Figure 1B-4). This patch is used to temporarily close the unit until the imaging chamber is placed.",
    "Place the incubation unit on the microscope stage and connect the in- and out-flow CO2 tubes (Figure 1E-5). Open the main CO2 valve (Figure 1E-6) and switch on the CO2 controller (Figure 1E-7). Check that the controller is set to 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: For humidity, CO2 passes through a humidifier (Figure 1E-8). For hypoxia experiments, a separate O2 regulator (Figure 1E-9) is included in the setup.\nSet the stage temperature to 37 °C (Figure 1E-10). For hyperthermia experiments, set the temperature to 42 °C. Allow the incubation unit to reach the selected temperature and CO2 percentage.\nTake the imaging chamber from the main CO2 incubator and transport the chamber in a petri dish to the microscopy room.\nPlace the imaging chamber (Figure 1A-4) in a custom-made, 35 mm-diameter stage holder (Figure 1A-5) and close the chamber with a custom-made sealing lid (Figure 1A-6).\n\tNOTE: The lid allows CO2 to pass and prevents evaporation and contamination.\n\t\nOpen the incubation unit, replace the red patch with the imaging chamber, and close the unit (Figure 1C). Do this as fast as possible to prevent the cooling down of the cells. Make sure that no cables are stuck between stage and the microscope.\nLeave the unit to acclimatize for 30 min.\nOpen the software and switch on the lasers.\n\tNOTE: Here, 488 nm argon, 543 nm helium-neon, and 633-nm helium-neon lasers were used.\nMake a new database by clicking \"New\" under the File tab. Name and save the database.",
    "Set the configuration by clicking \"Config\" under the Acquire tab. Select \"Channel mode\" and \"Single track\" to evaluate a single fluorophore or \"Multi track\" for several fluorophores. Select the appropriate band-pass filters matching the fluorophore (e.g., 560 to 615 nm band-pass filter for dox and Dox-NP; see the Representative Results for more examples). Select the bright-field channel in one of the tracks.\nSet the scan control by clicking \"Scan\" under the Acquire tab. Set the frame size (1,024 x 1,024), scan speed (optimal), scan direction (8-bit, single), and scan average (4) by clicking \"Mode.\" Set the pinhole (200 µm), gain and offset (e.g., 580, 700, and 835; see Figure 3), and laser power (488 = 10%, 543 = 100%, 633 = 100%) by clicking \"Channels.\"\nSave these settings by clicking \"Config\" in the Configuration tab and save them in the configuration database.\nSet the time-lapse by clicking \"Multi Time X\" (Figure 1D) in the Macro tab. Click \"Single location\".\nTo keep the cells in focus, select the automated focus in the macro by clicking \"Auto Focus.\"\n\tNOTE: Autofocus is achieved with the 633-nm laser using the reflection of the glass as a reference point.\nApply the saved configuration by clicking \"Single track\" or \"Multi track,\" scrolling to the required configuration in the configuration database, setting the time interval (e.g., 15 min), number of scans (e.g., 97) and clicking \"Load Config.\"\n\tNote: Using these settings, a time-series of 97 x 15 min = 24 h will be made.\nName the time-lapse in the \"Base File Name\" and select the database (made in step 3.11) by clicking \"Image Data Base\" to save the time-lapse. Set a temporary folder by clicking \"Tmp Image Folder.\"\n\tNOTE: If the system stops or crashes for any reason, the images are located in this folder.",
    "Open the incubating unit, lift the imaging ring, add a drop of immersion oil to the objective, and close the unit as fast as possible. Focus and select a position in the imaging chamber.\n\tNOTE: This position contains cells in a monolayer, with a minimum of 70% confluency, allowing for the imaging of individual cells.\nCheck the configuration settings for the background and correct if necessary.\n\tNOTE: The background can be corrected by reducing the gain or laser power. Any change in the configuration needs to be saved (see step 3.17) and loaded (see step 3.18) again in the macro.\nIn the laminar flow cabinet, dilute free drug or nanoparticles at a concentration of 5 µg/mL drug or 0.05 µmol of lipids in cell culture medium. Filter through a 0.22-µm syringe filter if the drug/nanoparticles are not sterile.\nOpen the incubating chamber, lift the sealing lid, remove the medium from the cells, add 1 mL of diluted drug/nanoparticles, and close the unit as fast as possible.\nFocus on the cells and start the time-lapse by clicking \"Start Time\" in the Multi Time X macro.\nCheck regularly to see if the cells are still in focus or use the autofocus (see step 3.16). The program automatically saves the time-lapse in the database; do not close the database while the program is running.\n4. Data Analysis\nDepending on the original research question, use software programs such as ImageJ for data analysis (see the Results section for examples)."
