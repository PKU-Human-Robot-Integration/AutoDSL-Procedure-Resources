    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: The process of patient recruitment will vary significantly from project to project. Readers should look for ways to adapt the process we describe below to their specific needs.\nIdentifying case-control association between PUM1-spanning copy number variations (CNV) and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD)\nTiming: Months\nTo validate the connection between loss-of-function (LOF) in PUM1 and neurodevelopmental disease (NDD), we screened several public and private consortia (Decipher, nstd102, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) (Firth et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Kaminsky et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), in-house databases (Baylor Genetics), and the published literature (Gennarino et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Riggs et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) for individuals for putatively pathogenic variation in PUM1 (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Our search criteria were limited to individuals with deletions <20 Mb in size and sufficient clinical characterization to establish a diagnosis of NDD. We identified 9 individuals with de novo heterozygous deletions involving PUM1 that ranged in size from 0.6 to 5.60 Mb (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). All deletions overlapped the entire PUM1 locus on chromosome 1.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1410-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Comparison of constraint metrics and mutation intolerance scores among genes in the deleted regions\n(A) Alignment of deletions from nine patients on chromosome 1p35.2; Mb, megabases. Dashed lines indicate the minimal region spanning PUM1, figure adapted from Gennarino et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\n(B–F) Bar graphs of constraint metrics and variant intolerance algorithms: (B) EvoTol (C) ExAC pLI, (D) RVIS (E) ExAC missense Z-score and (F) pcGERP. The dotted red arrow delineates the recommended threshold beyond which (pink shaded region) variants are predicted to be deleterious. Genes for which scores were not predictable or not available are denoted as not applicable (n/a).",
    "Although all 9 deletions encompassed PUM1, each deletion also spanned adjacent genes (15 in total) which could create additive effects beyond the activities of PUM1. We evaluated the disease association for each gene using the three databases, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (Amberger et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, The Jackson Laboratory), and DisGeNET (Pinero et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), and, with the exception of FABP3, found no association with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We then further showed that PUM1 was the gene most likely to cause the disease features by comparing population-based constraint and tolerance metrics:\nAssess population constraint metrics and mutation tolerance sensitivity scores for all genes encompassed in the overlapping region of deletions\nTiming: Hours\nIn this step, users will use a series of web-based tools to obtain constraint metrics and dosage sensitivity scores for a group of genes within a shared region encompassed by large deletion variants identified in patients. Comparing pathogenicity metrics will assist users in distinguishing which among the deleted candidates is the most likely shared causal gene in all patients.\nObtain pre-calculated scores using each of the URL provided below:\npLI and Missense Z-score\nGo to URL: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/[href=https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/]\nChoose ExAC in the dropdown menu\nEnter single Entrez gene ID\nScores provided under “Constraint”\nRepeat for each respective gene\nEvoTol (evolutionary intolerance) (Rackham et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17])\nGo to URL: http://www.evotol.co.uk/[href=http://www.evotol.co.uk/]\nEnter comma delimited list of Entrez gene ID for all genes of interest\n“EvoTol percentile” scores will be tabulated and graphed.\nNote: Score may not be available for genes that are not expressed above\nRVIS (residual variation intolerance score) (Petrovski et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26])\nGo to URL: http://genic-intolerance.org/[href=http://genic-intolerance.org/]\nEnter comma delimited list of Entrez gene ID for all genes of interest",
    "RVIS scores provided with percentiles in parentheses Each gene can be assessed as to whether its score falls within the predicted range for pathogenicity. For instance, genes with pLI scores ≥ 0.9 are interpreted as extremely intolerant to loss-of-function (Lek et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Samocha et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). A description of each score and recommended pathogenicity thresholds are provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. In addition, the scores for all genes can be directly compared to one another and ranked relative to each other, especially in situations where multiple genes are predicted to be pathogenic.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1410_1.csv\nAbbreviation: pLI, probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant; EvoTol, Evolutionary Intolerance; RVIS, Residual Variation Intolerance Score; pcGERP, protein-coding Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling; MAF, minor allele frequency.\nReturning to the example in Gennarino et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], PUM1 was determined to be the most likely causal gene within the deleted regions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) because (1) its loss of function measures consistently surpassed the pathogenicity threshold, and, more importantly, (2) its effect was greater than that of any of the other 15 deleted genes (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1F).\nIdentifying NDD patients with pathogenic missense variants in PUM1\nTiming: Months\nHere we used the publicly accessible GeneMatcher website (https://genematcher.org/[href=https://genematcher.org/]) (Sobreira et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). The site allows users (clinicians, patients/families and researchers) to post a gene of interest and upload corresponding data such as clinical and demographic features. A match occurs when any of the following criteria are shared between two or more entries: (1) OMIM number, (2) gene symbol, (3) genomic location, or (4) phenotypic features. This search yielded three additional missense variants: two simplex cases, and a large family with multiple members segregating with a late-onset cerebellar ataxia. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to submit to GeneMatcher:\nGo to URL https://genematcher.org/account/[href=https://genematcher.org/account/] and create a new user account",
    "There are no email domain restrictions but it is recommended to provide academic institution-based credentials.\nLogin to the system portal with account credentials\nIn the user account homepage, click the “Create a new submission” link under the “Submissions” tab\nUnder this “New submission” page, the match criteria for your gene can be specified\nUnder section “Results (human genes only, maximum of 10 genes only)”, we recommend providing a gene symbol without specifying the variant\nNote: Setting the minimum amount of match criteria at this stage is recommended. For novel genes, limiting criteria such as the type of variation, mode of inheritance, etc. are likely unknown, and overspecification will restrict the identification of cases.\nGene “Match” notifications with information to contact submitters will be sent to the email address listed on the user account after which correspondence to discuss collaboration can begin.\nUsing GeneMatcher, the c.3439C>T (p.Arg1147Trp) and c.3415C>T (p.Arg1139Trp) missense variants were identified in two patients. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and pre-/post-processing and genomic alignment (hg19) had already been performed. These two PUM1 variants were identified as the most likely cause of disease in each patient by systematically eliminating variants that are likely benign. Variants found in the probands with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >1% in gnomAD (Karczewski et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or ExAC (Karczewski et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) were filtered out, and remaining variants were prioritized based on pathogenicity prediction algorithms.",
    "The c.3103A>T (p.Thr1035Ser) variant required additional familial segregation analyses because it fell below established pathogenicity criteria and was associated with a milder, late-onset phenotype of ataxia rather than NDD (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Direct Sanger sequencing of Exon 19 in 7 family members across two generations showed segregation between the disease phenotype and the variant in all except one member, suggesting incomplete penetrance (Gennarino et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). (We have since recruited additional patients with late-onset ataxia who bear the p.(Thr1035Ser) variant, which confirms its pathogenicity.) In addition, mildly hypomorphic variants such as p.(Thr1035Ser) may also sporadically appear in population databases (gnomAD) of “healthy” individuals in cases where disease-onset occurs late in life. For some genes, this is not an uncommon occurrence (Kryukov et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), although such variants are still typically “ultra-rare” in the general population. Nevertheless, such situations should be carefully considered when assessing the pathogenicity of novel disease variants.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1410-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pathogenicity scores for disease-associated PUM1 variants\nCADDv1.6, REVEL, M-CAP and Eigen pathogenicity scores of p.(Arg1147Trp) (red arrowhead), p.(Arg1139Trp) (pink arrowhead) and p.(Thr1035Ser) (blue arrowhead), relative to the distribution (boxplot) of PUM1 singleton (ultra-rare) variant scores found in gnomAD (gray circles). The dotted red arrow delineates the recommended threshold beyond which (pink shaded region) variants are predicted to be deleterious.",
    "Pathogenicity prediction scores were helpful in distinguishing p.(Arg1147Trp) and p.(Arg1139Trp), but p.(Thr1035Ser) was inconsistent (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Using singleton missense variants (allele count = 1) extracted from the gnomAD database, we determined the pathogenicity score distribution of ultra-rare missense variants in PUM1 within which the p.(Thr1035Ser) variant falls. Prediction scores for all PUM1 missense variants were obtained using the genetic annotation program ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). The follow is a step-by-step protocol for running ANNOVAR using either a Windows or Apple iOS operating system. We encourage users to adapt the provided script to their own needs and refer to https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/[href=https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/] for additional resources.\nUse ANNOVAR and dbnsfp (version 4.2a) dataset to annotate genetic variants with pathogenicity scores\nTiming: Hours to days\nIn this step, PC/Apple iOS users will use the Perl programming language based genetic annotation program, ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) (through an installed or intrinsic Perl interpreter), to obtain functional and pathogenic predictions for a list of variants found in patients. Rather than downloading the entire dataset of numerous functional prediction scores for annotation, which would require local disk space beyond the average capacity of individual work stations (>100 TB), annotations will come from a “lightweight” but comprehensive dataset, dbnsfa (Li et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Liu et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (∼50–60 Gb), containing all potential nonsynonymous and splice-site SNVs in the human genome.\nNote: the scripts provided for annotating the p.(Arg1147Trp), p.(Arg1139Trp), p.(Thr1035Ser) and gnomAD singleton variants are for demonstration purposes. Users should modify and adapt this script according to their own needs.\nInstall (or activate) Perl language interpreter\nWindows/PC users:\nVisit the URL: https://strawberryperl.com/[href=https://strawberryperl.com/] and install program according to operating system (64 bit or 32 bit)\nVerify installation:\nperl -v\nApple iOS users: a Perl interpreter comes pre-installed.
