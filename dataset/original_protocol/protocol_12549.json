    "1. Isolation of small extracellular vesicles\nNOTE: Perform all centrifugation in steps 1.1-1.11 at 4 °C.\nPreparation of sEVs-free fetal bovine serum (FBS): Centrifuge FBS overnight at 110,000 × g at 4 °C through an ultracentrifuge (see Table of Materials) to remove endogenous sEVs. Collect the supernatant, filter sterilize it with a 0.2 µm ultrafiltration membrane, and store it at -20 °C.\nPlate about 3 x 107 immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) on a 150 mm culture dish and add 20 mL of DMEM culture medium (see Table of Materials).\nBefore collecting sEVs, discard the medium. Wash the cells once with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; Table of Materials) and replace it with a medium containing 10% sEVs-free FBS.\nAccording to the needs of the experiment, collect the cell supernatant and transfer it to 50 mL centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge the cell supernatant at 300 × g for 10 min to remove the cells, discard the pellet, and transfer the supernatant to new 50 mL centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 2000 × g for 10 min to remove dead cells, discard the pellet, and transfer the supernatant to new high-speed centrifuge tubes (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 10,000 × g for 30 min through a high-speed centrifuge to remove cell debris and microvesicles, discard the pellet, and transfer the supernatant to new ultracentrifuge tubes (see Table of Materials). The volume of the open ultracentrifuge tubes is 38.6 mL; place 35 mL of cell supernatant in each tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 110,000 × g for 70 min in a swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge(see Table of Materials) to obtain crude sEV pellet.",
    "Discard the supernatant, and wash the sEVs-enriched pellet with 1 mL of PBS. Centrifuge at 110,000 × g for 70 min on a Tabletop ultracentrifuge (see Table of Materials). Discard the supernatant and add 1 mL of PBS to an ultracentrifuge tube.\nThen pipette the precipitate continuously, transfer the 1 mL of PBS to another ultracentrifuge tube, and so on, until all ultracentrifuge tubes are mixed by pipetting.\nDiscard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of PBS, which is sEVs.\nMeasure the total protein of sEVs using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) method, following the steps below (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nPreparation of protein standard: Add 1.2 mL of protein preparation solution into a standard protein tube (30 mg of BSA) to fully dissolve it to prepare protein standard solution (25 mg/mL). Then dilute it with PBS to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.\nAdd 0 µL, 1 µL, 2 µL, 4 µL, 8 µL, 12 µL, 16 µL, and 20 µL of the protein standard into the 96-well plate, and add PBS to make up 20 µL. At the same time, add 18 µL of HEPES lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100) and 2 µL of sEVs samples to the sample wells to be tested.\nPrepare the required BCA working solution as per the manufacturer's instructions, add 200 µL of BCA working solution to each well, and place at room temperature (RT) for 20-30 min.\nMeasure the absorbance at 562 nm wavelength with a microplate reader, and calculate the total protein concentration of sEVs according to the standard curve and the dilution factor.",
    "NOTE: The sEVs extracted from 40 mL of supernatant by this protocol can be used for subsequent identification of protein markers (western blot). However, sEVs extracted from 200 mL of cell supernatant can be used for both morphological observation (transmission electron microscopy, TEM) and particle size analysis (nanoparticle tracking analysis, NTA). Specifically, for sEVs harvested in step 1.11, resuspend with 100 µL of PBS. Take 20-30 µL for morphology observation (TEM) and resuspend the remaining sample in 1 mL PBS for particle size analysis (NTA). All centrifuges are pre-cooled in advance. For step 1.8, these ultracentrifuge tubes must be strictly balanced and at least three-quarters full. If not, add medium to makeup. For step 1.11, the sEVs can be stored at 4 °C for a short term (12 h); otherwise, they must be stored at -20 or -80 °C to avoid protein degradation that interferes with the extraction of peptides. However, for samples used to observe the morphology and measure particle size, it is only recommended to store at 4 °C for a short term (12 h).\n2. Observation of morphology of sEVs by transmission electron microscopy\nPlace a drop of fresh sEVs sample (about 20-30 µL) on the parafilm, place the number side of the copper mesh on the sEVs droplet, and let it absorb for 3 min.\nAbsorb the excess liquid with filter paper, and then place the copper grid on a drop of distilled water and wash it twice.\nAbsorb the excess liquid with filter paper. Then place the copper grid on the 0.5% uranyl acetate droplet for negative staining for 5 s.\nRepeat step 2.2.\nPlace the prepared copper mesh on the sample rod and insert it into the sample stage.",
    "Adjust the magnification to 20,000x-25,000x to find the sample to be tested. Then adjust the magnification to 100,000x and adjust the appropriate position and grayscale to observe under a transmission electron microscope (TEM; Table of Materials). The accelerating voltage for acquiring images is set at 80 kV.\n\t\tNOTE: For step 2.1, if the concentration of sEVs samples is low (<50 µg/µL), the adsorption time can be extended to 5 min or even longer. Alternatively, for step 1.10, a smaller volume of PBS (50 µL) can be used for resuspension. For step 2.3, the negative staining time should not be too long; otherwise, it is difficult to observe the three-dimensional (3D) structure of sEVs.\n3. Measurements of particle size distribution and concentration of sEVs by nanoparticle tracking analysis\nFor the sEVs harvested in step 1.11, dilute the solution to 1 mL for nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). First, clean the instrument with distilled water until there are no impurities in the field of vision. Then use a 1 mL sterile syringe to push the sample slowly (injection volume: 0.5-1 mL).\nAnalyze the samples through supporting software (see Table of Materials). Specifically, click Start Camera and adjust the Camera level to an appropriate size (generally an intensity of 14-16 units), then select the measurement method, Standard Measurement (3 or 5 times), and click Run to collect the particles.\nAfter collecting the particles, the computer can observe the moving sEVs particles. At the same time, set the detection threshold (generally 5) to analyze the particle size distribution so that the final counted particles are all moving sEVs rather than the background. After analyzing the particles, save and export the analysis results.",
    "After use, wash the instrument with distilled water until there are no obvious particles in the field of vision, and turn off the laser.\n\tNOTE: Unlike sEVs samples for TEM, sEVs samples for NTA should not be too concentrated and require larger sample volumes (at least 1 mL). Additionally, alternative methods can be used to analyze the size distribution of sEVs, such as flow cytometry and tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), etc. The recommended number of particles/frames for NTA measurements (NanoSight LM10) is 40.\n4. Detection of protein markers of sEVs by western blot\nNOTE: According to the Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2018 guidelines17,18, 5 categories of proteins are recommended for the characterization of sEVs. Evaluate at least one protein marker of each category 1 to 4 for sEVs preparation.\nFor the sEVs harvested in step 1.9, carefully pipette the supernatant, and add 15 µL of HEPES lysis buffer for 5 min. Then add an equal amount of loading buffer and cook in boiling water for 15 min.\nIn this protocol, the loading of sEVs' protein was 8-10 µg. Electrophorese the proteins in 10% gels at a constant voltage of 80 V (about 30 min).\n\t\nWhen the sample enters the separating gel, adjust the voltage to 120 V (about 45 min). After the sample is 2-3 cm away from the bottom of the glass plate, disconnect the power supply and cut off the sample strip for electroporation. The composition of electrophoresis solution is described in sub-step 4.2.1.1.\n\t\t\nTo prepare 5x electrophoresis solution, weigh 15.1 g, 5 g, and 94 g of Tris, SDS, and glycine, respectively, and dilute to 1 L with deionized water. When it is used, it needs to be diluted 5 times with water.",
    "Assemble the electroporation device and put in sufficient electroporation solution (about 1 L), and electroporate the protein on the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane with a constant current of 90 mA on ice for 3.5 h.\n\tNOTE: To prepare 10x electroporation solution, weigh 30.25 g and 144.1 g of Tris and glycine, respectively, and dilute to 1 L with deionized water. When it is used, it needs to be prepared at a ratio of 7:2:1 of deionized water: methanol: electroporation solution.\nAfter electroporation, place the NC membrane in blocking solution (2.5 g of skimmed milk powder in 50 mL of Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1-2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C. The composition of TBST is described in sub-step 4.4.1.\n\t\nTo prepare 10x TBST, weigh 60.56 g and 175.32 g of Tris and NaCl, respectively, and then add 10 mL of Tween-20 and 34 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Adjust pH = 7.6 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and makeup to 2 L with deionized water. When it is used, it needs to be diluted ten times with water.\nIdentify the protein markers by three sEVs' markers (cluster of differentiation 9 [CD9]; β-actin; tumor susceptibility gene [TSG101]) and one non- sEVs' marker (glucose-regulated protein 94 [GRP94]).\n\t\nPipette 2 µL of the above antibodies and dilute at 1:500, then incubate the NC membranes at RT for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The diluent is the blocking solution in step 4.4.\nAfter incubation with the primary antibody, wash 3 times with 1x TBST on a shaker for 10 min each time.\nPlace the NC membrane in the diluted secondary antibody (1:500) and shake slowly on a shaker at RT for 45-50 min. Wash it 3 times with 1x TBST on a shaker for 10 min each time.",
    "Mix the chemiluminescent substrates A and B (see Table of Materials) at 1:1, add the mixed reagent to the NC membrane, and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nImage the NC membrane using a blot imager (see Table of Materials)\n\t\nOpen the Image Lab software, and select New Experimental Protocol.\nSelect the application Blotting-colorimetric, cancel Highlight, click Run Experimental Protocol, acquire the marker, and save it.\nThen re-select the application program Blotting-chemi, and set the Total number of images and Exposure time to 30 s and 300 s, respectively.\nClick Run Experimental Protocol, acquire the images, and save it. Finally, remove the NC membrane and turn off the computer.\n\t\tNOTE: For step 4.6, the incubation time of the secondary antibody should not exceed 50 min; otherwise, the background will be too dark.\n5. Extraction of sEVs' peptides\nWash the sEVs twice by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g at 4 °C for 70 min, and add 500 µL of PBS (see Table of Materials) to resuspend them, and add 5 µL of 100x protease inhibitor (see Table of Materials).\nPlace the sample for ultrasonic crushing (see Table of Materials). Settings for ultrasonic homogenization are as follows: power: 40 W, total time: 10 min, ultrasonic time: 3 s, and interval time: 5 s.\nCentrifuge the crushed mixture at 13,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAfter centrifugation, add dithiothreitol (DTT; Table of Materials) to the supernatant to a final concentration of 50 mmol/L, and incubate in a water bath at 56 °C for 30 min.\nSubsequently, add 50 µL of iodoacetamide (IAA; Table of Materials) to the supernatant at a concentration of 1 mol/L and leave it to react at RT for 20 min in the dark.",
    "Centrifuge the mixture at 13,700 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and collect the supernatant, the crude peptides extract. Store it at -20 °C for later use.\nUltrafilter the obtained peptides crude extract with a 10 kDa ultrafiltration tubes19 (see Table of Materials) to remove proteins, and centrifuge at 13,700 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Collect the effluent and dry it in a vacuum centrifugal concentrator (see Table of Materials) at 45 °C.\nDesalt the dried samples following steps 5.8.1-5.8.8. Use mass spectrometry-grade pure water as a solvent for the reagents.\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to each sample to completely dissolve the dried peptides.\nAdd 100 µL of 100% acetonitrile (ACN) to each desalting column, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at RT, and discard the effluent. Then add 100 µL of 50% ACN, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min, and discard the effluent.\nAdd 100 µL of 0.1% TFA to each desalting column, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min, and discard the effluent.\nRepeat step 5.8.3.\nPipette the peptides dissolved in step 5.8.1 into the desalting column, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min, and recover the effluent. Repeat the sample loading step to let the peptide sample adsorb into the desalting column.\nRepeat step 5.8.3 twice.\nAdd 50 µL of 50% ACN (containing 0.1% TFA) to the desalting column, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min, and collect the effluent (peptides) in a new mass spectrometry-grade centrifuge tube.\n6. Drying the desalted peptides\nDry the desalted peptides in a vacuum centrifugal concentrator (Settings: V-AQ mode, temperature: 45 °C, and time: 50 min ) and use them for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.",
    "NOTE: The extraction process of sEVs' peptides should be performed on ice as much as possible to avoid protein degradation. All reagents used were prepared with mass spectrometry-grade water to avoid plastic contamination. For step 5.8, desalting results in the inevitable loss of the peptide samples. This loss can be reduced by repeating steps 5.8.5 and 5.8.7.\n7. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis\nNOTE: Analyze the peptides' sample by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), specifically the Orbitrap Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer connected with an EASY-nLC 1000 nano-high-performance LC system (see Table of Materials).\nSeparate the samples on a C18 analytical column (1.9 µm of grain diameter, 15 cm length x 150 µm inner diameter) at a flow rate of 60 nL/min with a 65 min gradient: 4%-15% for 4 min, 15%-28 % for 28 min, 28%-40% for 10 min, 40%-69% for 10 min, 95% constant for 7 min, 95% decreased to 6% for 1 min, and constant for 5 min (solvent A, water containing 0.1% formic acid [FA]; solvent B, 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% FA, v/v).\nIonize the eluted peptides in a nano-electrospray ionization (nano-ESI) sprayer at 320 °C capillary temperature and spray voltage of 2.2 kV.\nCollect the mass spectral data using data-dependent acquisition mode with a resolving power of 120,000 for full-scan mode and 15,000 at MS/MS mode.\n\t\nPerform full scans in the orbitrap from scan range 250 m/z to 1800 m/z and isolation window with 1.6 m/z.\nSelect the top 20 intense ions for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 29% and measure in the ion separator.",
    "NOTE: Typical mass spectrometric conditions were as follows: Automatic gain control (AGC) targets were 3 x 106 ions for full scans and 2 x 105 for MS/MS scans; the maximum injection time was 80 ms for full scans and 19 ms for MS/MS scans; and dynamic exclusion was used for 13 s.\nSubscription Required.
