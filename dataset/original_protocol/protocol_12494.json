  "procedures": [
    "1.\tThe Experimental Setup\nUse for each resident a cage with a floor space of about half a square meter. Offensive aggression is a highly active form of behavior that requires sufficient space for its full expression. The cage should be made of sanitizable material. \nHouse each resident with a female for at least one week before the start of the experiments, which will facilitate the development of territoriality. At the same time this will prevent social isolation, which is known to be stressful for social animals and may lead to reduced welfare and aberrant forms of social behavior. \nUse companion females that are sterilized by ligation of the oviducts. In this way, the female stays hormonally intact and will be regularly receptive without becoming pregnant and developing maternal aggression. \n2.\tProcedure\nHouse the resident male and the companion female together in the resident cage for at least one week prior to testing. \nDo not clean the bedding of the cage during that initial week or prior to later testing, since territoriality is strongly based on the presence of olfactory cues. These cues are both important for the resident in establishing its own territory and for the intruder to know that it is in the home cage of the resident. Please, notice that this deviation from the general animal care taking procedures may require special permission from the authorities. \nRemove the companion female from the residential cage one hour before the test. \nIntroduce an unfamiliar male into the home cage of the resident at the start of the test. Preferably, the intruder should be slightly smaller than the resident and should not have been used in previous interactions with the same resident. \nRecord the behavior of the resident, preferably using a light sensitive video camera.",
    "A test duration of 10 min is usually sufficient for the expression of the full offensive behavioral repertoire. For the purpose of standardization one may consider to continue recording for ten minutes after the first attack. \nAfter completion of the test, remove the intruder male from the cage and reunite the resident male with its companion female. \nAlthough aggression may occur at all times of day, it is best to test only during the dark phase; the rats' main activity phase. \nTesting can be performed once or twice per day. The level of aggressive behavior often increases across the first couple of tests but generally stabilizes after three to four tests. \n3.\tOffensive Aggressive Behavior\nIn principle, any strain of rats can be used as residents. However, strains may differ considerably for their absolute level of aggressive behavior. Moreover, there may be a considerable individual variation within strains. \nStandardize intruders as much as possible in terms of strain, age and weight. Use rats of a non-aggressive strain that are slightly lower in body weight than the resident male.    \nDetermine in the resident male the duration and frequency of the following behavioral parameters:    \n    \nAttack latency: the time between the introduction of the intruder and the first clinch attack\nMove towards\nSocial exploration        \nAno-genital sniffing        \nRearing        \nLateral threat        \nUpright posture        \nClinch attack        \nKeep down        \nChase        \nNon-social explore        \nRest or inactivity \nAnalyses    \n    \nThe behavioral parameters recorded should cover 100% of the observation time. This facilitates an unbiased interpretation of the results, i.e. when one behavior goes up, another has to go down.        \nData reduction can be obtained by calculating scores of different behavioral categories; particularly:\n        \nTotal offense score: sum of lateral threat, upright, clinch, keep down and chase\n \tSocial exploration score: sum of social explore, ano-genital sniffing and social groom",
    "Data can be expressed as percentages of the total observation time \n4.\tViolence\nFollow the protocol explained under section 2 \nBehavioral tests and criteria:    \n    \nDetermine in the resident male the attack latency. A very short latency is a first indicator of violence.\nCalculate for the resident male the ratio between the frequencies of lateral threat and clinch. A ratio below 1 shows that animals attack without any introductory behavior and forewarning which is a reliable indicator of violence (out of control). \nBite target sites:        \n        \nBites attacks targeted at vulnerable body parts such as the throat, belly and paws are a sign of violence.            \nBites targeted at the snout of the opponent indicate defensive behavior of the actor.\nOut of context tests:      \n        \nUse an unfamiliar female as intruder. Attack of a female is a sign of violence.\nUse an anesthetized male as intruder. Attack of an anesthetized male is a sign of violence.\nTest the aggressive behavior of the resident in a novel environment. The absence of a change in aggression compared to the home cage is a sign of violence.\n          The endpoint of this test is the first attack or ten minutes when the resident does not attack.          \n5.\tDefensive Behavior \nSelect a number of well trained, highly aggressive, non-violent resident males \nFollow the protocol as explained under section 2 \nDetermine in the intruder the duration and frequency of the following behavioral parameters (in addition to 3c):    \n    \nSubmission latency        \nSubmissive posture        \nMove away        \nFlight        \nDefensive upright posture\nFreeze        \nNon-social explore        \nRearing \nAnalysis    \n    \nData reduction can be obtained by calculating a defense score, which is the sum of the amount of time spent on flight, defensive upright posture, submission and freeze \n6.\tSocial Stress\nFollow the protocol as explained under section 5\nFor intermittent social stress, repeat the protocol",
    "For chronic social stress, keep the intruder in the resident's cage, but separated from the resident by a wire mesh screen\n  \nContinue step b and/or c for as long as the scientific questions and hypotheses require."
