    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nOn the day of recording/sample collection you should have all solution stocks and aliquots already prepared and all materials cleaned and stored in single-use bundles.\nUse clean gloves during all steps of all procedures. Change gloves often, especially after cleaning surfaces and/or components and, crucially, before loading ICS into the recording pipette and before retrieving the pipette for transferring the sample into the collection tube.\nMaintaining strict cleaning and de-contamination standards is crucial for the successful collection of high-quality Patch-seq samples.\nNote: it is best to split the daily solution preparation and slicing between two people. This coordination facilitates the timely preparation of material, aids in avoiding cross-contamination (e.g., the internal solution is prepared and handled by a person that has not been in contact with mouse tissue on the day) and minimizes the time elapsed from slicing to recording and sample collection.\nDaily Pre-recording Electrophysiology Rig Cleaning and Preparation of Materials\nTiming: 30 min\nCirculate 50 mL of 70% EtOH in DEPC H2O along the perfusion system.\nNote: Over time this can weaken the adhesive that seals the recording chamber to its coverslip base. Be aware of this potential issue, and re-seal the chamber when required.\nCirculate 50 mL of RNase-free DEPC H2O along the perfusion system.\nWipe all surfaces with RNaseZap and rinse with 70% EtOH in DEPC H2O. Pay special attention to the handles, knobs, buttons, keyboards, and mouse that are regularly touched before and during cell extraction.\nWash the electrode holder.\nDisconnect the electrode holder and disassemble it.\nRe-chlorinate the silver wire in bleach for 20 min. Clean with RNaseZap three times. Rinse with molecular biology grade, nuclease-free H2O three times. This last wash is crucial as any trace of bleach or RNaseZap can affect cell viability during recording.",
    "Thoroughly clean all the parts of the electrode holder with RNaseZap three times. Rinse with molecular biology grade, nuclease-free H2O three times. Air dry inside the PCR cabinet, under UV light for >30 min (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: keeping the electrode wire and electrode holder exceptionally clean is absolutely necessary for collecting good quality samples.\nPull recording pipettes.\nWipe all surfaces of the pipette puller thoroughly with RNaseZap and rinse with 70% EtOH in DEPC H2O.\nPull glass capillaries to the desired size and shape specifications and place in a clean box with a lid.\nNote: For standard borosilicate glass (OD 1.5 mm, ID 0.84 mm, filamented) we used a 2-step pull on an upright puller (Narishige PC-10, load weight: 250g, heat for each step: step 1, 59.6; step 2, 44.9. pull length, 6 mm), which generated pipettes with ~5–6 MΩ resistance and gave identical results for autoclaved versus non-autoclaved glass. Be aware, however, that these parameters will need careful adjustment for individual experimental requirements. Unless we encountered any serious and/or unforeseen issues with pipette resistance or puller settings, we usually pulled all the pipettes used during the whole recording session before starting.\nCritical: keep the pulled capillaries in the plate with the lid on. Avoid contact with air as much as possible. Always handle capillaries with new, clean gloves.\nReplace the filter on the patching mouth suction tube (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nWipe Gilson (or other brand) pipettes that will be used for loading the ICS into the recording pipettes with RNaseZap and rinse with 70% EtOH in DEPC H2O.\nPrepare 1× Solutions for the Day\nTiming: 30 min\nStarting from single-use stocks and aliquots.\nPrepare sucrose slicing solution.",
    "Add the dry weight of sucrose (20 g), glucose (0.45 g) and NaHCO3 (0.504 g) to 230 mL of ddH2O on a stirring plate and wait until everything dissolves.\nBubble with carbogen for ≥10 min to equilibrate the pH.\nAdd 20 mL of the 10× sucrose stock solution and place on ice. Continue bubbling.\nPrepare 1× aCSF with channel blockers.\nDilute a 50 mL 10× aCSF aliquot in RNase-free H2O to approximately 450 mL.\nAdd 1 mL of MgSO4 1 M, 1 mL of CaCl2 1 M and 13.5 mL of 20% glucose.\nComplete to 500 mL with RNase-free H2O.\nBubble with carbogen for ≥10 min to equilibrate the pH.\nAdd 50 μL each of NBQX, APV, and SR-95531 to 50 mL of aCSF to be used for perfusion during recordings. Continue bubbling.\nNote: Antagonists for the main ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors are included in the aCSF to ensure that the electrophysiological properties recorded from patched cells are truly intrinsic to those neurons, and are not influenced by tonic network activity. If synaptic factors are of interest in particular experiments, some or all of these blockers should be omitted as appropriate.\nPrepare ICS with RNase inhibitor.\nNote: These steps must be performed in a separate pre-amplification area, in a PCR cabinet or hood.\nAdd 2 μL of RNase inhibitor (20 Units/μL) to a 250 μL aliquot of 1× ICS (final concentration of RNase inhibitor is 0.16 Units/μL).\nRinse a new, sterile 1 mL syringe with molecular biology grade, nuclease-free H2O three times.\nUsing the syringe, filter the ICS through a 0.22 μm filter into a new microcentrifuge tube.\nKeep the ICS on ice.\nPrepare the Sample Collection Tubes for Flash-Freezing\nTiming: 45 min",
    "Prepare freezing plate. Clean the metal plate three times with RNaseZap. Rinse with 70% EtOH in DEPC H2O. Air dry inside the PCR cabinet, under UV light for >30 min.\nPrepare the collection tubes. Pipette 2 μL of RLT plus lysis buffer into PCR tubes. Store in a clean box with a lid, at 22°C–24°C, until sample collection.\nCritical: The collection tubes MUST be compatible with downstream sample processing, as all cDNA synthesis and amplification steps should be carried out in the same tubes, without transferring the sample.\nNote: These steps must be performed in a separate pre-amplification area, in a PCR cabinet or hood.\nNote: The RLT plus lysis buffer precipitates readily, so these aliquots need to be prepared on the day of use.\nNote: the use of a strong lysis buffer is a requirement for accessing the mRNA content inside the nucleus. Its use in this protocol is made possible by the incorporation of mRNA capture steps into the sample processing pipeline (step 23).\nWipe an ice bucket with RNaseZap three times and rinse with 70% EtOH in DEPC H2O. Load with dry ice and place the clean, dry metal plate on top. Place the lid on.\nPatch-Clamp Recordings\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following is a brief description of the process of obtaining whole-cell recordings, focusing on the need to minimize sources of contamination during Patch-seq. More detailed accounts of the technical aspects of whole-cell recordings are available elsewhere (Molleman, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Ogden, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Segev et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nThe recording protocol needs to be previously optimized to ensure the required functional parameters are obtained in the shortest period of time, to minimize mRNA degradation. As a general rule, do not spend more than 10 min on this step after membrane rupture.\nPrepare acute slices for electrophysiological recordings.",
    "With appropriate ethical approval, obtain acute slices of the CNS region under study. We use a standard acute slicing protocol (Galliano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). For the purposes of Patch-seq the only specific modification is the preparation of clean aCSF (see Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Dissection and slicing occur in ice-cold oxygenated sucrose solution. Slices are then kept in clean, oxygenated aCSF at 32°C–34°C for 30 min, before being maintained in oxygenated aCSF at 22°C–24°C for the remainder of the experiment. Individual protocols should be optimized for the requirements of particular animal models, tissues, equipment, or experiments.\nPerfuse the aCSF extracellular recording solution (containing the channel blockers) through the system and wait for the recording chamber to equilibrate to the correct temperature.\nTransfer a brain slice from your recovery chamber to the recording chamber and fix in place with a harp.\nLoad 2 μL of ICS (with RNase inhibitor) into a pulled glass capillary using a gel loading tip.\nNote: If the gel loading tip does not have a filter place a P10 filter tip between the pipette and the gel loading tip. We found that the Eppendorf gel loading tips (Microloader™, cat. no. 5242956003) and the ClearLine P10 filter tips (cat. no. S1120-3810) are perfectly compatible.\nNote: gel loading tips affect the accuracy of volume measurements. If you need to pipette exactly 2 μL, because the samples will be processed by an automated pipetting station, you can accurately measure the 2 μL using a standard P10 filter tip, place the drop on the back of a microcentrifuge tube lid and aspirate it with the gel loading tip.\nObtaining a whole-cell recording.",
    "Note: Obtaining high-quality whole-cell somatic recordings from small neurons usually requires the use of small-tipped, relatively high-resistance pipettes. Typically, we record from olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons using pipettes with resistance of ~4 MΩ. For Patch-seq recordings, we had to adjust this to ~5–6 MΩ (see Cell extraction). This made obtaining good quality recordings a bit more cumbersome due to higher access resistance, but ensured that the pipette tip was just the right size for cell collection.\nKeeping positive pressure on the pipette, lower the electrode into proximity with your chosen cell (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 1).\nZero the voltage offset on the amplifier.\nMove the pipette into contact with your cell and remove the positive pressure.\nNote: Traditionally this involves lowering the pipette vertically or obliquely toward the surface of the cell until a dimple in the cell membrane is observed. With very small cells the positive pressure from the pipette tip may be enough to significantly distort or even blow the soma away upon approach. Carefully adjusting the level of positive pressure, approaching the cell from the side or at an angle, and/or swiftly switching off the positive pressure when close to the cell soma can help successful seal formation.\nOnce a giga-Ohm seal is formed, use negative pressure to break into the cell and establish a whole-cell patch configuration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 2).\nPerform the desired electrophysiological experiments (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 3).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/219-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic Timeline for Patch Recordings and Cell Extraction",
    "Corresponding representative seal test protocols are shown for each step. Step 1: A clean, unobstructed pipette is lowered into the vicinity of the target cell. Step 2: A giga-ohm seal is formed between the pipette and cell. Step 3: The cell membrane is ruptured yielding electrical access to the inside of the cell. At this point the membrane properties of the cell can be interrogated (e.g., inset trace, showing cell response to 500 ms of depolarizing current injected in current-clamp mode). Step 4: Negative pressure is applied, drawing the cell contents into the pipette and forming a strong seal onto the cell nucleus. Step 5: The pipette is slowly retracted from the tissue bringing the cell nucleus with it. Seal test recordings shown here were obtained by holding the cell at −60 mV and stepping the membrane voltage sequentially to −50 mV and then −70 mV for 10 ms before returning to the holding potential. Scale bar, 10 ms and 1 nA for #1; 10 ms and 200 pA for #2–5; 100 ms and 25 mV for inset in #3.\nEvaluate recording parameters online (e.g., leak current, resting potential, etc.). If recordings meet quality thresholds, proceed with sample collection.\nNote: Criteria will vary according to individual experimental demands, but should be kept consistent across a study; with the small cells and small pipettes in play here, ours were access resistance ≤33 MΩ with no change >25% across a recording, and holding current ≤100 pA.\nCell Extraction\nTiming: 10 min\nTo maximize single-cell sample purity this procedure must be carried out entirely under good electrical seal (usually >1 GΩ). Ideally, it should not take longer than 10 min, to minimize mRNA degradation.",
    "Note: The specific technique described here, including the “corking” approach, requires some optimization with regards to pipette size, negative pressure applied, and movement of the pipette away from the tissue. Although it might take a little practice, following the steps below is crucial for ensuring successful, clean collection of the recorded interneuron’s intracellular contents. In particular, collection of the cell nucleus significantly increases the cDNA yield (Cadwell et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]). Ensuring a good “cork” of the nucleus in the pipette tip allows the nucleus to be collected with a small-tipped pipette without losing the high-resistance seal which optimizes sample purity.\nCollect the cell content, including the nucleus, using the recording pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], steps 4 and 5).\nApply negative pressure until the cell has reduced significantly in size. This may take up to several minutes, and with small-tipped pipettes it may require constant suction far stronger than that required to initially obtain a gigaseal. If electrical seal begins to fail, release pressure and allow the cell to recover.\nWhen most of the cell contents have been suctioned into the pipette, begin to manipulate the pipette into proximity with the nucleus. Identifying the nucleus’ location is helped by its generally darker appearance and its more solid presence; it does not move or distort as readily as the plasma membrane in response to pipette manipulations. Continue to apply negative pressure and monitor electrical resistance to observe a change in access resistance when the seal is formed on the nucleus.",
    "Slowly begin to move the pipette away from the tissue. Raise the pipette vertically from the slice in stages, allowing time at each step for the electrical seal to stabilize. If the previous steps were successful the nucleus should be seen accompanying the pipette tip (“corking”), if this is not the case, lower the pipette again in line with the cell body and repeat steps a-b (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCritical: Due to the small size of olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons, in order to obtain a significant amount of mRNA for proceeding with cDNA synthesis and sequencing library preparations, we needed to ensure that we collected the cell nucleus.\nNote: we optimized this step for consistently obtaining a nucleus “cork” during cell extraction. We achieved this by using smaller tip pipettes (~5–6 MΩ) for recording so the nucleus was slightly bigger than the tip and so would generally not be sucked into the pipette.\nFinally, as the pipette is extracted from the tissue along with the cell body/nucleus, it may still be connected to the tissue via intact but stretched neuronal processes. Significant care is required here to prevent rupture of the cell and loss of electrical seal due to the tearing of these processes. Move the pipette slowly away from the tissue until the nucleus/soma can be confidently seen to be separated from the slice. Only after this is confirmed is it safe to remove the pipette from the solution. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]; Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13], and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]).\nCheck that there is no debris attached to the outside of the pipette (Troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).\nTransfer the cell to the collection tube.\nRemove the glass capillary, or detach the entire pipette holder assembly from the headstage (this will depend on the holder specifications).",
    "Note: Removing the glass capillary from the pipette holder does not affect the small volume of liquid at the tip. It is safe to remove it from the holder.\nQuickly bring the tip of the recording pipette to the bottom of a PCR collection tube, containing 2 μL of lysis buffer.\nCritical: It is essential that the tip of the capillary does not touch anything before contacting the lysis buffer. Special attention must be paid to avoid touching the walls of the collection tube (Troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.19]).\nGently break the tip of the capillary against the bottom of the collection tube.\nApply positive pressure to expel the whole of the pipette content into the lysis buffer. Avoid making bubbles.\nNote: If in the previous step the glass capillary was removed from the pipette holder, a mouth pipetting assembly can be quickly placed on the top of the glass capillary to apply positive pressure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nQuickly place the tube on the metal plate sitting on dry ice to flash-freeze the sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAssign a sample collection score to the cell, based on successful collection of the nucleus, extraction time, quality of seal, presence of debris on the outside of the pipette and successful depositing into lysis buffer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]; Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13], 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15], 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17], and 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.19]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/219-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Scoring System for Assessing Cell Extraction",
    "Perfectly extracted cells must meet all the criteria outlined: successfully extracted nucleus, seal maintained throughout the whole extraction process, no debris observed on the outside of the pipette, no contact of the tip of the pipette with any surface before it reaches the lysis buffer in the collection tube, and less than 10 min duration for the entire extraction process. Assign a score to each cell and only process for sequencing cells with “perfect” or “very good” scores. Cells with “good” scores can also be sequenced if, for example, sample numbers are low or there is particularly interesting physiology.\nStore samples at −80°C until processing.\nCollect negative controls during each recording/collection session.\nLoad a pipette with ICS and lower to the tissue as if aiming to perform a recording.\nAfter making contact with the tissue, retract the pipette and transfer the contents to a collection tube.\nFlash-freeze the sample and store at −80°C until further processing.\nPause Point: Frozen samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months before further processing.\nmRNA Capture and scRNA-Seq\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThe focus of this protocol is on Patch-seq sample collection: the steps required to obtain high-quality material for sequencing after whole-cell recordings in small interneurons. We do not aim to provide a comprehensive description of the downstream procedures needed to generate and analyse scRNA-seq or other -omic data. Detailed protocols for this are published elsewhere (Macaulay et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Picelli et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.21], 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.23], and –13[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.25]). Instead, here we briefly outline a possible workflow based on our own experiments.\nFollow the G&T protocol to capture poly-adenylated mRNA (Macaulay et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).",
    "Note: Although this adds a significant number of steps to sample processing, it presents a number of advantages. First, this step is necessary for removing any traces of the RLT plus lysis buffer. Second, it helps in controlling the total volumes of subsequent reactions. Third, it generates a separate gDNA fraction that is available for pursuing questions at the genomic level.\nNote: before starting the G&T procedure, add 1 μL of spike-in RNA (typically, 1:1–2 million dilution, but this will depend on the cell type) to each sample. These artificial RNAs will serve to control for technical artifacts during cDNA synthesis, library preparation and sequencing (Jiang et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nPerform cDNA synthesis and amplification following the Smart-Seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nQuantify and quality control the cDNA using standard procedures (e.g., Qubit and bioanalyzer) and by running qPCRs for relevant marker genes.\nNote: extensive cDNA quality control (Qubit + bioanalyzer + qPCRs; Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) is highly recommended during the initial troubleshooting stages, when Patch-seq workflows are being established anew. This will provide the necessary feedback for outlining the cell collection scoring criteria.\nPrepare sequencing libraries by tagmentation using the Illumina Nextera XT kit and introduce sample indexes.\nQuantify and quality control the pooled libraries using standard procedures (e.g., Qubit, bioanalyzer, and qPCR quantification).\nSequence the libraries on the appropriate Illumina platform (e.g., HiSeq2500). Typically, samples are pooled to obtain ~2 million reads per cell. For cell types with complex transcriptomes (e.g., neurons) this sequencing depth will ensure quantitative gene expression data for >5,000 genes, comprising highly, averagely and lowly expressed genes, and ensuring these include genes coding for ion channels and transporters which are of particular interest for experimental questions addressed using Patch-seq protocols.\nDemultiplex, QC, map and quantify the sequencing reads following standard protocols (Vieth et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).",
    "Perform sample-level QC to identify successfully sequenced samples and eliminate low-quality cells (see examples in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).
