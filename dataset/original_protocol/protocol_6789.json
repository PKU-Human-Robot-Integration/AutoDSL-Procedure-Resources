    "Cell cultureFirst cultivate fibroblasts at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 and 90% humidity in an appropriate cell specific medium with or without test substances.After an appropriate incubation period, remove the cells with Trypsin-EDTA and transfer   3.0 × 106 cells into a new 1.5 ml reaction tube.Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 1,200 × g and 4 °C and resuspend the resulting pellet in 1 ml 1× PBS (washing step).Isolation and lysis of mitochondriaTake 3.0 × 106 fibroblasts in 1× PBS and centrifuge it for 5 min at 1,200 × g and 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the resulting pellet in 200 µl CHAPS lysis buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 3 μl of 2 M tri-sodium citrate dihydrate and incubate on ice for 45 min.Homogenize the sample with a syringe and a cannula (diameter = 0.9 mm) on ice by pipetting up and down ten times.To completely separate the mitochondria from the remaining cell structures, centrifuge the samples again for 10 min at 1,200 × g and 4 °C.Transfer the supernatants with the mitochondria into a new 1.5 ml reaction tube (pre-cooled on ice).Lyse the isolated mitochondria in a further lysis step on ice with pulsed ultrasound at 20 watts for 1 min (0.5 s pulse on, 1.0 s pulse off).After a further centrifugation step for 45 min at 21,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatants can be stored on ice until further use within a few hours. Keep supernatants at -20 °C for overnight or longer storage.Preparation of the reporter oligonucleotidesMix 5 µl of each of the single-stranded reporter oligonucleotides CN-8-oxoG ([6FAM]CCATAATAATAATAAC[8-oxo-dG]CAATAATAATAATACC[6FAM]) (100 µM) and CN-CTRL ([6FAM]CCATAATAATAATAACGCAATAATAATAATACC[6FAM]) (100 µM) each in a separate 0.",
    "2 ml reaction tube with 10 μl of the BHQ-1-tagged complementary strands ([BHQ1]GGTATTATTATTATTGCGTTATTATTA TTATGG[BHQ1]) (100 μM) (all Sigma Aldrich GmbH) and 35 μl NEBufferTM2. A schematic representation of the reporter oligonucleotides can be seen in Figure 1.Incubate the oligo mixtures for 15 min at 95 °C in the thermocycler, followed by cooling down of the finished constructs in the freezer at -20 °C (annealing during cooling phase–annealing temperature = 50 °C). The subsequent storage of the finished constructs take place at -20 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3954/bioprotoc-11-06-3954-g001.jpgFigure 1. Basic principle of the assay. A double-stranded nucleotide strand carrying an 8-oxoG base (shown in red) is used to detect the activity of hOGG1. The strand with the damage carries at both ends a 6-FAM molecule as a fluorescence reporter and on the opposing quencher are added at both ends. In the uncut reporter oligonucleotide both strands are hybridized with each other whereby the fluorescence signal of the 6-FAM molecules is intercepted by the quenchers. If the strand with the damage is cut, the two nucleotide strands dissociate from each other and the fluorescence signal can be measured.Base excision repair assayPipette the samples and controls into a white 96-well plate as shown in Table 1, homogenizing the samples by pipetting up and down (two wells are required per approach – one for CN-8-oxoG and one for CN-CTRL).Table 1.

Excitation of the 6-FAM molecule occurs at 465 nm and detection of the fluorescence signals in the wavelength range of 483-533 nm (Figure 2A).To determine the resulting oligonucleotide fragments, perform a melting curve analysis at a temperature of 95 °C to 20 °C after completion of the real-time activity measurement (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3954/bioprotoc-11-06-3954-g002.jpgFigure 2.
