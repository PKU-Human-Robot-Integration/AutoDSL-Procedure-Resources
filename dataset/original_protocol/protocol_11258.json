  "procedures": [
    "Orthotopic pancreatic tumors were generated as previously described10 in accordance with the U.K. Home Office Animal and Scientific Procedures Act 1986 and the European Directive 2010/63/EU. All mice were monitored perioperatively for signs of pain or suffering, including but not limited to weight loss (> 15 % in 72 h or 20 % in any given period), piloerection, narrowing of eyes, raised gait, hunched appearance, as well of signs of wound infection including bleeding, redness and ulceration. Tumor growth was monitored by palpation, and additional clinical signs such as labored breathing, jaundice and cold extremities were also monitored in order to assess if signs of endpoint had been reached. All procedures should be carried out in sterile conditions. All reagents used prior to flow cytometry staining should be prepared in sterile conditions.\n1. Preparation of tumor cells for injection\nTake an aliquot of basement membrane from -20 °C and place on ice at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Basement membrane concentration may vary from batch to batch; therefore, lot specific basement membrane batches must be tested in vivo to ensure reproducibility. A new batch of basement membrane is thawed on ice at 4 °C overnight then aliquoted in user-defined aliquots, on ice, and then further stored in -20 °C until required. This minimizes the pipetting and freeze-thawing when using basement membrane.\n\t\nPlace sterile PBS at 4 °C overnight to chill.\nPlace sterile 200 µL and 1000 µL pipette tips at -20 °C overnight to chill.\nUse tumor cells that are mycoplasma free, grown for at least 2- 10 passages post-thawing and in log-phase of growth prior to harvest. This protocol uses the female murine C57BL/6 KPC-derived cell line: TB32048 provided as a generous gift by the lab of David Tuveson.",
    "When tumor cells are required for harvest, remove medium from the flask and wash cells twice in PBS (pre-warmed to 37 °C).\nAdd 2x trypsin (pre-warmed to 37 °C) to the flask for 10 min at 37 °C (to a T175 flask, add 5 mL).\nAfter 10 min, add an equal volume of complete medium (10% FBS, 1x penicillin, 1x streptomycin in DMEM) to the flask and dissociate cells by gently tapping the flask and resuspending well in medium.\nTransfer the cells into a tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and room temperature (RT).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in complete medium for cell counting.\nCentrifuge cells again for 5 min at 300 x g and RT, and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in pre-chilled PBS to achieve a concentration of 1x106 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: This stock concentration is prepared to achieve a final injection concentration of 1000 cells in 5 µl. We found injection of a lower number of cells in a low injection volume minimized cell leakage and therefore increased reproducibility however, tumour growth may be cell-line dependent therefore users should optimize each cell line.\nAlongside this, place a pre-aliquoted basement membrane aliquot, on ice, into the hood.\n\t\nThe ratio of the final solution of basement membrane, PBS and tumor cells in PBS prepared for injection is 5:3:2. Therefore to a 500 µL aliquot of basement membrane add 300 µL of pre-chilled PBS using a pre-chilled 1000 µL pipette tip.\nAdd the PBS directly to the basement membrane aliquot to minimize pipetting.\nKeep the p1000 set to 300 µL and resuspend the PBS and basement membrane, making sure to keep the tube on ice to preserve the basement membrane in liquid state.",
    "When finished ejecting all the basement membrane from the p1000 tip, leave the tip in the tube to allow any basement membrane/PBS to come down the pipette tip.\nAfter 5-10 min, eject more basement membrane from the p1000 tip back into the tube and leave the tube to sit on ice.\nTake 200 µL of resuspended tumor cells in PBS and add directly to the basement membrane using a pre-chilled 200 µL pipette tip.\n\t\nTake a fresh pre-chilled p1000 pipette tip, set the pipette at 300 µL and resuspend 30-40 times. A larger pipette tip, set on a low volume, is preferable as basement membrane can travel up the tip and touch the pipette tip filter during resuspension.\nThe tumor cells are ready for injection. Keep tumor cell/basement membrane on ice during surgery.\n2. Orthotopic injection of tumor cells\nAcclimate the mice in the animal facility for 7 days.\n\t\nAround 2 h prior to surgery, shave the left-hand side of abdomen and back, then administer pre-operative analgesic subcutaneously under the scruff of the neck (Buprenorphine at 50-100 µg/kg).\nPrepare surgical field, with a heat mat to lay mouse on and drapes for surrounding equipment and over mouse. Sterilize all surgical tools; prepare enough sets of tools for each mouse.\nPlace the mouse in a 5% isoflurane with O2 chamber until unconscious.\nTransfer the mouse, lying on its back, onto a heat mat and maintain anesthesia using a mask, usually at a lower 2-3% isoflurane.\nConfirm deep anesthesia; as identified by loss of the pedal-withdrawal reflex when the hind paw is pinched and monitor breathing rate remains constant.\nCover the body in drape, with only the shaved portion exposed. Ensure the mouse is securely in the anesthesia mask.",
    "Using a sterile cotton bud, add iodine solution in a circular motion over the shaved area: starting from the center and circling out to the edge. Repeat process again with fresh cotton bud and iodine.\nUse scalpel to make a 1 cm incision directly above the pancreas/spleen location (upper-left quadrant). Sterile scissors may also be used to make the incision, if preferred.\n\t\nPull the skin apart using forceps. With new forceps, locate the peritoneal wall and use scissors to make another 1 cm incision through the peritoneal wall.\nExtract the pancreas, which may come with the spleen, from the body using the second pair of forceps.\nGently invert the vial of tumor cells/basement membrane several times to mix.\nPrepare the glass syringe with 5 µL containing 1,000 tumor cells in basement membrane and place on the heat mat for a few seconds to allow it to warm.\n\t\tNOTE: The brief warming of the syringe will allow the basement membrane to start solidifying, in order to make it easier to inject without leaking. However, this must be kept brief, if left too long the basement membrane will solidify completely and will not be injected. The use of a glass syringe allows a low volume to be precisely injected.\nHold the pancreas at the tail to extend it and insert the needle directly into the center of the pancreas, parallel to the pancreas itself with an effort to avoid visible blood vessels.\n\t\tNOTE: The center of the pancreas has a large area and it is easiest to inject. However, the head or tail of the pancreas may also be specifically injected if preferred.",
    "Slowly inject 5 µL of basement membrane into the pancreas and hold the needle steady in the pancreas for at least 30 s after injection to allow the basement membrane to solidify and prevent leaking. The basement membrane should be visible as a small clear bubble will have formed; however, it may not be visible.\n\t\tNOTE: Larger volumes of tumor cells/basement membrane can be injected; however, the exact volume must be tested to ensure leakage does not occur.\nRemove the needle from the pancreas and wait to confirm no bleeding has occurred. Gently insert the pancreas back into the abdominal cavity, taking care not to touch the basement membrane bubble.\nPull the peritoneal wall together and perform a single suture, or two interrupted sutures if needed.\nPull the two sides of the skin incision together and perform multiple interrupted sutures as needed or insert two surgical clips.\nAdminister another subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine into the scruff.\n\t\nTransfer the mouse into a heated 37 °C cage for at least 30 min post-surgery to maintain body temperature before transferring back into a fresh cage.\nPrepare a mash diet available in the cage, to ensure rehydration and body weight.\nRe-administer post-operative analgesia as recommended and watch closely for signs of wound opening, pain or infection and weight loss. If using surgical clips, these can be removed 7-10 days later using a clip remover.\nAfter around 14 days the scar tissue will have healed sufficiently to begin palpating the abdomen. Monitor tumor size closely via palpation until mice reach endpoint.\nAt endpoint the mouse is culled via cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The skin and peritoneal cavity are opened using scissors and the pancreas tumor excised using forceps to hold the tumor, and scissors to remove surrounding tissue.\n3. Digestion of pancreatic tumors",
    "Place the dissected pancreatic tumor, metastatic site tumors, or healthy pancreatic tissue in ice-cold PBS, and store on ice.\n\t\nUse forceps to transfer the tumor onto a Petri dish.\nAdd 5.0 mL of digestion medium (2 mg/mL Collagenase, 0.025 mg/mL DNase RPMI) into a 50 mL tube; store on ice to prevent enzyme activity commencing.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol uses Collagenase Type V, which has an activity of ≥1 units/mg FALGPA and > 125 collagen digestion units (CDU)/mg solid. Collagenase and DNase aliquots can be stored at -20 °C and thawed on ice before use. When both are completely solubilized in sterile RPMI, they can be passed through a 0.2 µm filter to remove contaminants. Collagenase must be completely solubilized before filtering to avoid loss of material.\nTake a small aliquot of this solution to cover the tumor on the Petri dish.\nUse sterile scalpel and forceps to cut the tumor into small pieces, roughly less than 3 mm in length.\nScrape the tumor pieces into the tube and gently invert the tube until all the pieces are submerged in digestion media. Store on ice if other tumor samples need to be prepared in a batch.\nTransfer onto a shaking device for 20 min at 37 °C. Make sure all pieces of tumor are submerged and not stuck to the edge of the tube. If shaking is not possible, then vortex the sample every 5 min to aid digestion.\n4. Preparation of single-cell suspension from digested tumor\nImmediately after the digestion step, place the tube on ice to slow enzyme activity.\n\t\nAdd EDTA to achieve a final concentration of 20 mM and briefly vortex sample to mix. This will further slow enzyme activity.\nOpen the tube and rinse any tumor digest off the lid of the tube with fresh RPMI medium.",
    "Prepare a 70 µm strainer (the µm size of the strainer can be altered as desired) on a 50 mL open tube, on ice.\nPre-wet the filter with medium.\nResuspend the digested cells and wash the sides of the tube using a 25 mL stripette, or larger. The wider opening of the stripette is important to allow the thick digest to pass easily.\nTransfer all of the digest, using the 25 mL stripette, onto the strainer.\nMash the tumor on top of the filter using a 1 mL syringe plunger. Mash only directly up and down to minimize shear stress to cells.\nContinuously wash cells through the strainer with RPMI. Make sure to wash with enough force to push cells through.\nIf there is still material to mash, but the RPMI stops flushing through, the strainer will be saturated. Therefore, transfer the sample into a new filter and continue.\n\t\tNOTE: Eventually only extracellular matrix components will remain in the filter, all single cells should have passed through.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 x g and 4 °C.\n\t\nCarefully resuspend the cell pellet in complete RPMI and pass directly through another filter to remove any extracellular matrix or large cell clumps that cannot be adequately resuspended.\nAt this point, if no stimulation is required, immediately stain the isolated cells for flow cytometry analysis by skipping to Step 6.1. Alternatively, resuspend them in freezing medium (10% DMSO in FBS) and store at -80 °C followed by long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.",
    "NOTE: The freezing step can allow purification of immune cells at a later date; however, the quantification of immune cell subsets may require optimization to confirm that cell numbers and phenotype is not affected by the freeze/thaw process. The ex vivo T cell stimulation is best performed on fresh tumor samples. At this point the sample can be further purified by bead-based dead-cell removal or immune cell enrichment assays if required.\n5. Preparing cells for ex vivo stimulation\nCount the cells to achieve a concentration of 2 x 106/ 100 µL in complete medium (RPMI 10 % FBS, 1X penicillin and 1X streptomycin).\n\tNOTE: The high number of total cells plated ensures that there will be adequate T cells within this sample to analyze. However, the number can be scaled up or down depending on sample availability and the rare nature of T-cell subsets of interest.\n\t\nPlate 100 µL of cells in a U-bottomed 96-well plate.\nAdd 100 µL of complete medium containing a 2x preparation of PMA/ ionomycin (to achieve a final concentration 0.081 µM and 1.34 µM, respectively, as recommended by the manufacturer).\n\t\tNOTE: If measuring degranulation/exocytosis, also include here a fluorescently conjugated anti-mouse CD107a in the media. A control sample that does not contain CD107a must also be performed.\nPlace in 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nAdd 20 µL of a 10x preparation of brefeldin A and monensin (to achieve a final concentration 1.06 µM and 2.0 µM, respectively (as recommended by the manufacturer) in complete media.\n\t\tNOTE: Brefeldin A and monensin are protein transport inhibitors and thus block extracellular release of cytokines, etc. permitting their detection by flow cytometry. If measuring cytokine release into the supernatant by ELISA or similar methods – then this step can be skipped.",
    "Place the plate in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for further 4 h.\n6. Extracellular and intracellular staining for flow cytometry\nRemove the plate and resuspend each well to transfer all material to a V-bottomed plate, placed on ice.\n\tNOTE: Epithelial cells, macrophages and other adherent cells may not be fully retrieved by resuspending. However as the downstream analysis is only on T cells, this is not a problem.\n\t\n6.1.1 Centrifuge the plate for 5 min at 300 x g and 4 °C (use these conditions for subsequent steps unless stated).\nRemove the supernatant by flicking the plate upside down in one sharp movement.\nResuspend in 50 µL of a fixable viability dye, prepared in ice-cold PBS. When resuspending, set the pipette to a lower volume to avoid making bubbles.\n\t\nIncubate for 20 min at 4 °C, in the dark.\nWash step: Add 100 µL of FACS buffer, centrifuge and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend each well with 50 µL of anti-CD16/CD32 (2.5 µg/mL) in FACS buffer (0.5 % BSA, 2.0 mM EDTA in PBS) to block non-specific binding of detection antibodies to Fc receptors.\n\t\nIncubate for 15 min at 4 °C, in the dark.\nAdd directly to each well a 2x mastermix of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse CD45, CD3, CD4 and CD8 (further extracellular markers can be added as desired) in FACS buffer.\n\t\nIncubate for 30 min at 4 °C, in the dark.\nWash step: Add 100 µL of FACS buffer, centrifuge and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 100 µL of 1x Intracellular (IC) fixation buffer and incubate for 30 min at RT, in the dark.\n\t\nPrepare the centrifuge at RT.",
    "Add 100 µL of FACS buffer, centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and RT and remove the supernatant. Repeat with 1x permeabilization buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g; then remove the supernatant.\nAdd 50 µL of 1x mastermix of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse IFNγ, TNFα, and other intracellular markers prepared in 1x permeabilization buffer.\n\t\nIncubate for 1 h at RT, in the dark.\nAdd 100 µL of permeabilization buffer to wash. Then centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and RT and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 100 µL of FACS buffer to wash, centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g and RT and remove the supernatant.\nAfter this final centrifugation, resuspend cells in a volume compatible for the flow cytometer. It may vary depending on the size of FACS tubes.\n\t\nTransfer this volume into appropriate FACS tubes for acquisition.\nCover from light and store in the fridge and acquire the samples within 24 h."
