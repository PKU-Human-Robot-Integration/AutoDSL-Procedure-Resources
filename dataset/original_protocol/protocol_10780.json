    "1. Liposome Preparation\nRetrieve a 20 mL glass vial with a Teflon-lined cap.\nClean all glassware and syringes with chloroform prior to use to prevent contamination.\nTransfer 100 μL of reagent grade chloroform to the glass vial using a 250 μL air-tight glass syringe.\nAdd 30 μL of reagent grade methanol to the same glass vial using a 100 μL air-tight glass syringe.\nTo prepare a 2 mM 7:1.5:1.5 phosphatidylcholine (POPC): phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE): cholesterol lipid solution, transfer 216 μL of 10 mg/ mL POPC, 42 μL of 10 mg/mL POPE and 20 μL of 11 mg/mL cholesterol solutions in CHCl3 to the 20 mL glass vial.\nEvaporate the organic solvents using slow-flow argon or nitrogen gas until a thin film of lipids is observed on the bottom of the vial.\nPlace the uncapped glass vial in a vacuum desiccator for at least 30 minutes to remove residual solvent.\nTransfer 2 mL of buffer, previously passed through a 0.2 micron filter, to the glass vial to hydrate the lipids.\nIncubate the mixture at 4 °C overnight and use within 48 hours.\n2. Freeze-and-thaw: For Liposome Sizes of 30 - 100 nm Only\nFreeze liposome suspension in liquid nitrogen for 15 seconds.\nThaw liposome suspension using a heating block at 42 °C temperature for ~3 minutes.\nRepeat steps 2.1 and 2.2 for a total of 5 cycles.\n3. Extrusion\nFollow the Avestin instructions to correctly assemble the Liposofast LF-50 extruder, using the instrument outline in their guide book.\nPlace the large hole support screen (with circular holes) in the support filter base, followed by the circular sintered dish (without holes), one drain disc (25 mm in diameter), and one polycarbonate membrane (25 mm in diameter).",
    "Place the small, black O-ring on top of the membrane to secure it to the support filter base.\nAttach the top filter extruder by tightening 4 screws in the 4 corresponding holes.\nAssemble the filter extruder unit to the underneath the large extruder barrel. Add the liposome solution to the cylinder barrel. Place the following on top of the extrusion barrel in order: large circular O-ring, narrow cap, large circular O-ring, circular cap.\nAttach the gas regulator to the extruder barrel top and close all valves to prevent air leakage, including the pressure relief valve. Place a 20 mL glass vial or 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask under the extruder filter unit. A safety valve is connected to the regulator and will release if pressure exceeds 600 psi. Turn on the nitrogen gas and open the gas valve connected to the extruder.\nIncrease nitrogen pressure to 25 psi for 400 nm liposomes, 125 psi for 100 nm liposomes, and 400-500 psi for 30 nm liposomes.\nWatch the liposome suspension as it ejects into the container while being pushed by the nitrogen. Keep the nitrogen flowing until you no longer observe any liquid passing through the extruder filter into the glass vial.\n4. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Analysis\nPrepare 50 μL of a 20 μM liposome solution.\nTurn on the power source and the lamp source.\nOpen the DynaPro software.\nSet the software to the MS/X algorithm model to detect liposomes of 30 nm and 100 nm and MS800 algorithm model to detect >100 nm liposomes.\nConnect to the hardware.\nPipet 14 μL of liposome sample into the quartz cuvette and insert into the cell holder.\nPress start.\nPress stop after ~20 - 30 acquisitions.\nAnalyze the average liposome diameter peaks recorded on the histogram.\n5. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)",
    "Prepare a 500 μL, 0.1 μM liposome solution.\nRinse the sample compartment with water and ethanol.\nDry the sample compartment with a lint-free paper towel.\nTurn on the laser power source and the computer.\nDeliver 300 μL of 0.1 μM liposome solution to the sample compartment.\nOpen the Temperature control and the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software.\nPress Capture button to turn on the laser.\nUse the horizontal and vertical adjustments to move the stage and adjust the microscope focus.\nSet the desired temperature (20 °C) and recording time (at least 30 seconds).\nPress the Record button to take multiple picture frames of the liposome particles for a specified amount of time. Analyze the peaks corresponding to the diameter liposome sizes on the histogram as it tracks the motion of each particle.\n6. Representative Results",
    "A scheme outlining the extrusion method is presented in Figure 1. To obtain optimum results, preparation of liposomes with diameters of 30 nm requires a high pressure of ~ 500 psi and diameters of 100 nm requires a pressure of 125 psi to achieve a rapid filter rate. For diameters of 400 nm, a low pressure of ~ 25 psi is recommended to achieve a slower filter rate, which allows the vesicles to elongate and form larger, homogeneous liposomes. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the optimal pressure for producing consistent sub-micron vesicle sizes. We varied the pressure as well as the number of extrusion passes through polycarbonate filters with pore sizes of 30, 100, and 400 nm and discovered appropriate pressure for each desired size. For 30 nm pores, pressure below 500 psi will reduce the flow rate, causing elongation and thus larger vesicle sizes. For 100 nm pores, a steady flow was achieved at 125 psi. For 400 nm pores, low pressure (25 psi) allows the vesicles to elongate into larger vesicle sizes. A slow drop-wise filtration flow is optimal to create larger sub-micron vesicles13.",
    "We performed DLS to determine the liposome sizes extruded through three different diameter sizes, i.e. 30, 100 and 400 nm. DLS is an established method that collects scattered light to determine the particle diameter. We extruded hydrated liposomes of 2 mM through a polycarbonate 30 nm membrane at 500 psi with 5 passes through the filter pore; a 100 nm polycarbonate membrane at 125 psi with 5 passes through the filter pore and a 400 nm polycarbonate membrane at 25 psi with 2 passes through the filter pore. The diameters of the liposomes and measured by DLS for 30, 100 and 400 nm pore sizes were 66 ± 28, 138 ±18 and 360 ± 25 nm (Figure 2). A suspension of 50 nm polystyrene beads was used as a calibration standard as shown in Figure 2, where it recorded a diameter of 47 ± 16 nm. The percent polydispersity shows that there is no overlap within liposome sizes. It is typical to observe diameters higher than 30 nm when using DLS analysis due to the known bias this instrument has towards larger particles12. Light scatter intensities from large and small particles are collected simultaneously from one detection method and thus harder to resolve liposomes in suspension12. Despite this instrumental limitation, the calibration curve describes a near linear correlation.",
    "NTA is a new technology that measures the size of each particle from direct observations of diffusion in a liquid medium, independent of particle refractive index or density. This high-resolution technique can be used to supplement the measurement of liposomes with DLS. The NTA recorded diameters of 95 ± 48 and 356 ± 51 nm, two 100 nm and 400 nm polystyrene solutions were used for calibration. Lipid solutions of 30 nm and 100 nm were observed to have a more comparable diameter relative to the DLS as shown in Figure 3, producing average sizes of 29 ± 14, 95 ± 17 and 359 ± 73 nm. The NTA may be a more general characterization technique to quantify microscopic particles since its sensitivity allows it to measure particles of 50 - 1000 nm. The calibration curve shows a linear correlation between the polycarbonate membrane pores versus the recorded NTA diameter.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nLiposome Sizes,Detection Threshold,Expected Minimum Particle Size (nm)\n30 nm,11,30\n100 nm,11,100\n400 nm,21,400\nTable 1.

    "Figure 2.  Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) data describing the quantitative liposome sizes following extrusion. (a) Bar graphs are shown to describe the diameters of the three liposome samples. A calibration standard of 50 nm polystyrene (PS) beads was used as a reference. The average liposome diameters are indicated above the bar for each sample.

    "Figure 4.  Negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showing each liposome size (500 μM) followed by extrusion. Carbon Formvar mesh grids were negatively discharged prior to sample staining, where 1% Uranyl acetate in water was used to stain the samples prior to drying and imaging at 34,000× magnification. Sizes 30, 100, and 400 nm are clearly distinct from each other. The magnification was set to 25,000×. The scale bar represents 0.5 μm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4151/4151fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.  A time-course experiment was conducted with three liposome sizes. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was measured for each liposome solution immediately following extrusion. All liposome solutions were stored in 4 °C overnight. Their diameters were recorded by the DLS after an overnight incubation. Little to no change was observed after a 16-hour incubation period.Subscription Required.
