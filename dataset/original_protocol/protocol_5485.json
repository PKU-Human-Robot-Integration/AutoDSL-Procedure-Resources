    "Cell culture and maintenance To distinguish between MSCs and ECFCs after co-culture, ECFCs were GFP-tagged using manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.systembio.com/products/imaging-and-reporter-vectors/bioluminescent-imaging-vectors/bliv101-cmv-gfp-t2a-luciferase/[href=https://www.systembio.com/products/imaging-and-reporter-vectors/bioluminescent-imaging-vectors/bliv101-cmv-gfp-t2a-luciferase/] System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Alternatively, ECFCs can be identified from MSCs through their high expression level of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) also known as CD31.   Preparation and application of coating solution    Coat tissue culture flasks/plates with fresh collagen type-I coating solution (working concentration of 1x, see Recipes) for 3-4 h under a laminar flow hood at room temperature. It is recommended to prepare the coating solution fresh and decap the culture vessels during coating step for optimal performance.    Then discard the coating medium thoroughly and gently wash the flasks/plates with PBS (see Recipes). Repeat washing step twice.  Note: The coated flasks/plates can be kept at 4 °C for maximum 1 month.    In vitro culture and freezing of placental ECFCs and BM-MSCs    Upon defrosting, culture ECFCs (about 6.0 x 103/cm2) and BM-MSCs (about 4.0 x 103/cm2) in EGM2 (see Recipes), and DMEM + 10% FBS respectively.   Change media twice per week and split the culture 1:3 when cultures reach approximately 90% of confluency. Discard the medium and gently wash the flasks with PBS. For subculturing, add TrypLE-express and incubate for 3-5 min, and then inactivate with full culture medium. Spin down the cell suspension at 330 x g for 5 min and then discard the supernatant and resuspend in fresh media.   For future applications freeze the cells using the freezing media (90% FBS and 10% DMSO, see Recipes).      In vitro co-culture assays   Direct co-culture of MSCs and ECFCs To investigate the effects of MSCs co-culturing on ECFCs survival in stress conditions (here serum deprivation conditions), MSCs and ECFCs are co-cultured together in EBM-2 alone (Figure 1A).    Culture 2.5 x 105 MSCs and 2.",
    "5 x 105 ECFCs together in collagen coated T75 flasks with EGM2.   After 4 h and once cells attached, discard the supernatant and wash the cells using EBM-2 (without addition of serum or growth factors) to completely remove any serum leftovers and feed the cells with EBM-2. As a control, 2.5 x 105 ECFCs are cultured in collagen-coated T75 flasks containing EBM-2.   After 48 h, detach cells using TrypLE-express dissociation reagent and count them.   Wash the cells with PBS, and resuspend them in FACS buffer (cell concentration: 1.0 x 105 to 5.0 x 105 in 100 µl FACS buffer, see Recipes) and transfer to 2 ml microtubes and then stain with mouse PE/Cy5 conjugated anti-human CD90 antibody (1:100 dilution), CD31 antibody (1:50 dilution) and 7-AAD (1:50 dilution) at 4 °C.   After 20 min, add 1 ml FACS buffer to each microtube and centrifuge cells at 400 x g for 4 min and resuspend cells in 200 µl of FACS buffer.   Use the Gallios flow cytometer and measure the percentage of ECFCs (GFP+CD31+CD90-) and calculate ECFCs number using appropriate flow cytometry analysis software (Kaluza).    (Optional) To assess the impact of MSCs on ECFCs in normal culture conditions, in separate experiments culture 2.5 x 105 MSCs and 2.5 x 105 ECFCs together in collagen-coated T75 flasks containing EGM2 for 48 h, and calculate the ECFC number as before (Figure 1B).  Note: As a control, culture 2.5 x 105 ECFCs alone in collagen-coated T75 flasks containing EGM2 for 48 h.    Indirect co-culture of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) and ECFC To assess the impact of cell-cell contact on ECFC survival, indirect co-culture experiment is performed using Transwell chambers with a 0.4-mm pore size membrane (Figure 1C).    Culture 0.5 x 105 MSCs on the top and 0.",
    "5 x 105 ECFCs in the bottom of Transwell chambers in separate plates with EGM2.   After 4 h, transfer the upper compartment on the top of ECFC cultures wells and change the EGM2 with EBM-2 and incubate in normal culture conditions: 5% CO2 20% oxygen 37 °C Humidity is maintained by putting a dish with sterile water   After 48 h, remove the Transwell, detach ECFCs using TrypLE-express dissociation reagent and count the number of viable ECFCs by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer. Note: Use ECFCs on the bottom of Transwell chambers as control culture and leave the top compartment cell-free.      Preparation and application of MSC-derived conditioned medium (MSC-CM) To investigate the contribution of MSC-secreted factors on ECFCs, ECFCs are cultured in the presence of MSC-CM (Figure 1D).   Culture 5 x 105 MSCs in a T75 flask with EBM-2 and incubate in normal cell culture conditions.   After 48 h, collect the supernatant and centrifuge at 330 x g for 5 min to remove any dead cells.   Filter the supernatant through a 0.22 µm filter to remove any remaining cell debris. The MSC-CM can immediately be used.    In the meantime, culture 5.0 x 105 ECFCs in EGM2 in a T75 tissue culture flask. After 4 h, remove the medium and wash the cultures with PBS and culture ECFCs with MSC-CM and incubate in normal culture conditions.   After 48 h, remove the supernatant and then count the number of viable ECFCs by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer. As control culture, use ECFCs in EBM-2 and EGM2.  Note: MSC-CM can be stored at -20 °C prior to use.   The MSC-CM can be concentrated using a centricon column. Under the laminar hood assemble the Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-3 membrane column according to manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Add 15 ml MSC-CM to the loading chamber (top) of the column. Centrifuge at 4 °C at 4,000 x g for 30 min. Concentrated MSC-CM can immediately be transferred on top of the ECFCs or can be stored at -20 °C after collection. 50 folds of concentrating are recommended.   In the meantime, culture ECFCs in collagen-coated 6-well plates (5 x 104/well) with EGM2 and place in the incubator. After 4 h, remove the medium and wash the plates with PBS and deliver concentrated MSC-CM on top of ECFCs.   After 48 h, count the number of viable ECFCs by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer. As a control, culture ECFCs in EBM-2 and EGM2.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171017/20171017012449_7874.jpg Figure 1.

Harvesting the MSC conditioned medium (MSC-CM) and deliver on ECFC cultures.     Immunostaining analysis   Co-culture 5.0 x 103 of MSCs and 5.0 x 103 of ECFCs in collagen-coated culture slides with EGM2 and incubate in normal condition. Change the media every second day.   After 4 days, discard the media, wash the cultures using DPBS and fix using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (see Recipes) in PBS (the homemade PBS is used for immunostaining experiments) for 20 min at 4 °C.  Note: For CD31 immunostaining, either use 2% PFA for 15 min at 4 °C or apply freezer cold acetone for 10 min at 4 °C.   Permeabilize cells with PBS/Triton X-100 (0.1%) (see Recipes) for 10 min at room temperature (RT).  Note: Excess incubation with PBS/Triton X-100 (0.1%) can damage cell morphology.",
    "To block nonspecific protein-binding sites, wash the slides with BSA blocking solution (see Recipes) for 20 min at RT.   Then, incubate slides for 2 h at RT with primary antibodies against CD31 (1:50), CD144 (1:100) and CD90 (1:100) diluted in antibody diluting solution (PBS/BSA [3%]/Tween [0.1%], see Recipes).   Wash the slides with 300 µl of PBS/Tween (0.1%) solution for 5 min. Repeat three times.   Then, incubate slides for 45 min at RT with 250 µl secondary antibodies diluted in antibody diluting solution (PBS/BSA [3%]/Tween [0.1%]).   Wash the slides with 300 µl of PBS/Tween (0.1%) solution for 5 min. Repeat three times.   Take off the upper compartment of culture slide according to manufacturer’s instruction.   Put one drop of Prolong Gold reagent with DAPI in each well of the 8-well plate, and cover the 8 wells with coverslip and observe under an Axio microscope.      Preparation of primed-ECFCs   Co-culture 2.5 x 105 of MSCs and 2.5 x 105 of ECFCs in collagen-coated T75 tissue culture flasks with EGM2 and incubate in normal condition. Change the media every second day (Figure 2A). Figure 3 shows representative images of ECFC alone or co-cultured with MSC in EGM2 for 4 days.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171017/20171017013123_7379.jpg Figure 2.

The top panels: merged phase contrast and fluorescent images; the down panels: phase contrast images. Scale bars = 100 µm.    After 4 days discard the media, wash the cultures using DPBS and detach cells using TrypLE-express dissociation reagent and count them.",
    "Spin down cells at 330 x g for 5 min, and resuspend them in 100 µl ice-cold FACS buffer and stain with mouse PE/Cy5 conjugated anti-human CD90 antibody (1:100 dilution) and 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, 1:50 dilution) and V450 conjugated anti-human CD31 antibody (1:50 dilution) at 4 °C.   After 20 min, centrifuge cells at 330 x g for 4 min and resuspend cells in 100 µl of ice-cold FACS buffer.  Note: When performing flow cytometry, single stained samples are important to determine the levels of staining and compensation, so staining of MSCs alone for CD90 antibody, and ECFCs for CD31 is recommended. Dead cells can result in false positives results due to autofluorescence and increased level of non-specific binding. So, application of live/dead markers to eliminate dead cells is also recommended.   Filter the cells through a 40 μm cell strainer to reduce cell aggregates before running samples through a FACS machine. Sort the GFP+CD90-CD31+ cells (primed-ECFCs) in ice-cold FBS in Falcon round-bottom polypropylene tubes.  Note: Sorted cells in PBS (or PBS with BSA/FBS) have limited viability, so sorting in FBS is recommended.    These cells can be then subjected to tube-formation assay, limiting dilution assay and gene expression analysis.    In separate experiments, and as control culture ECFCs alone in a T75 flask with EGM2 for 4 days and sort the GFP+CD90-CD31+ cells.  Note: Change the medium at day 2.      Tube-formation assay   Thaw MatrigelTM one night before use at 4 °C.   Pre-chill the 24-well plates and the pipet tips at 4 °C for 2-3 h.   Aliquot 100-150 μl of MatrigelTM per well of the pre-chilled 24-well plate on ice (Figure 2B).  Note: Make sure the MatrigelTM is evenly distributed over the wells and try to avoid air bubble formation inside the gel. MatrigelTM must not dry.",
    "Leave the coated plates in an incubator (humidified 37 °C incubator) and allow gel to polymerize for 30 to 60 min.   Transfer the ECFCs harvested from sort (primed-ECFCs) to 15 ml tubes and spin down at 330 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in fresh EGM2. Count the cells and dispense 400 μl of primed-ECFCs (1.0 x 104) into the MatrigelTM-coated wells. Use 1.0 x 104 non-primed ECFCs as a control.   Place the plates in the IncuCyte® live-cell analysis system, and capture phase contrast and fluorescence images every 2 h for 48 h. Count capillary-like structures. Figure 4 shows representative images of primed ECFCs seeded on MatrigelTM.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171017/20171017013705_9767.jpg Figure 4. Representative images of primed-endothelial colony forming cells seeded on MatrigelTM after 24 h (left: phase contrast, right: phase contrast merged with fluorescent). Scale bars = 100 µm.      Single cell assay   Coat desired number of 96-well plate with 50 μl coating solution for 3-4 h under the laminar flow hood and make sure the coating solution is evenly distributed over the wells (Figure 2B). It is recommended to prepare the coating solution fresh and decap the plates during coating step for optimal performance.   Discard the coating medium thoroughly and gently wash the flasks with PBS. Repeat washing step twice.  Note: The coated 96-well plate can be kept at 4 °C for maximum 1 month.   Prior to cell culture, aliquot 100-150 μl of EGM2 into each well of 96-well plate.   Seed one single primed or non-primed ECFCs (GFP+CD90-CD31+) in each well by using the BD FACSAria sort machine. Incubate plates in normal cell culture conditions and change the media with fresh EGM2 twice a week by removing half of the medium and replacing it with fresh EGM2.",
    "After 2 weeks, visualize the cells under a light microscope and count/score colonies. Endothelial colonies can be scored as endothelial clusters (ECs; < 50 cells), low proliferative potential EPCs (LPP; 50-2,000 cells), and high proliferative potential EPCs (HPP; > 2,000 cells) (Figure 5).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171017/20171017013806_8438.jpg Figure 5.
