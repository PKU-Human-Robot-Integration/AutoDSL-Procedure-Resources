    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExposure of larvae to metronidazole to induce epithelial cell loss\nTiming: 30 min to 2 h hands-on time (depending on the number of larvae and experimental groups), followed by 5 h of incubation time (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAddition of MTZ to Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a, Tg(UAS-1b:nsfB-mCherry)c264 larvae causes a NTR-dependent conversion of MTZ to a cytotoxic agent, which induces the rapid elimination of apoptotic surface epithelial cells by extrusion, a mechanism used to remove unfit or aberrant cells.\nCarefully transfer larvae to 12-well suspension culture plates using a 1-mL Pasteur pipette.\nNote: If sufficient numbers of larvae are available, we recommend using 15 larvae per well (experimental group). However, do not exceed a number of 15 larvae per well as overcrowding of wells complicates manipulations and survival monitoring, and may result in increased mortality.\nHold the plate at an angle of about 30° and carefully remove the medium with a 1-mL microliter pipette. Do not touch or aspirate the larvae.\nNote: No more than 100 μL of medium should remain in the well in order to ensure adequate MTZ exposure.\nAdd 1 mL of MTZ-supplemented E3 medium to the wells. Use plain E3 medium for control groups that shall retain epithelial homeostasis.\nIncubate plates for 5 h at 28°C on a nutator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nOptional: For therapeutic studies, drugs modulating epithelial restorative capacity (e.g., recombinant human epigen) and/or antifungal prophylaxis can be added to the medium during MTZ exposure.\nCritical: All experiments should include control larvae without epithelial cell loss. These may be either wild-type larvae or Gal4 enhancer trap larvae incubated in E3 medium lacking MTZ. In our experience, MTZ toxicity is not an issue as we did not observe noticeable morbidity or mortality upon exposure of larvae to concentrations of up to 10 mM MTZ.",
    "Critical: The duration of MTZ exposure is critical for the extent of epithelial cell loss elicited. Do not exceed 5 h of MTZ exposure to prevent excess mortality of infected larvae and death of uninfected control animals. If necessary, the extent of epithelial damage caused by the cell loss can be fine-tuned by adjusting the MTZ concentration and/or shortening the exposure period.\nNote: Extrusion and the extent of associated tissue damage can be assessed by using the Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a, Tg(UAS-1b:nsfB-mCherry)c264 line in conjunction with other transgenic lines such as, Tg(UAS-1b:Lifeact-EGFP)utm1; Tg(krt4:GFP); and Tg(-8.0cldnb:lynEGFP) zf106 that allow for independent visualization of both the surface epithelial cells and cell-cell contacts. For additional details about quantification of the resulting epithelial tissue damage, please see (Wurster et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nInfection of larvae after induced epithelial cell loss\nTiming: 30 min to 2 h hands-on time (depending on the number of larvae and experimental groups), 16 h of incubation time (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nInduction of epithelial cell loss by MTZ treatment of Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a, Tg(UAS-1b:nsfB-mCherry)c264 larvae renders the animals susceptible to fungal infection. While larvae with epithelial homeostasis are highly resistant to opportunistic fungi, larvae with epithelial cell loss can be infected with agents of mucormycosis or other pathogenic fungi by adding spores to the medium. Unlike injection-based infection assays, this technique allows for rapid infection of hundreds of larvae by simple media changes.\nHold the 12-well plate at an angle of about 30° and remove the supernatant from each well with a 1-mL microliter pipette. Avoid touching or aspirating the larvae. Approximately 100 μL should remain in the well.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh E3 medium.\nRepeat the wash cycle two more times and add 1 mL of fresh E3 medium.",
    "Add 100 μL of a 6×107 R. arrhizus spore suspension to all wells that need to be infected (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2D).\nNote: Considering a remainder of 100 μL E3 medium in the wells after the last wash step, addition of 1 mL of fresh E3 medium and the 100-μL volume of the spore inoculum itself, this inoculum results in our recommended standard spore concentration of 5×106/mL. However, we have previously shown that the infection severity can be easily adjusted by using up to 10-fold lower or higher spore inoculums (as seen in Figure 1L in (Wurster et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nCritical: All experiments should include control groups of uninfected larvae with epithelial homeostasis and induced epithelial cell loss, respectively, as a sentinel for non-infection-attributable baseline mortality. A standard experimental design is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1193_5.csv\nIncubate plates for 16 h (± 1 h) at 28°C on a nutator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nOptional: For defining interactions of fungal spores with the damaged epithelium, anesthetized (tricaine-S) infected and non-infected larvae can be mounted in a 4-well MatTek dish and high-resolution imaging can be performed using laser scanning or spinning disc confocal microscopy as in (Atieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) or anesthetized larvae can be mounted in 24-well plates on soft agar and imaged using the IncuCyte ZOOM microscope system (Wurster et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPost-infection monitoring and treatment\nTiming: 3 days\nWe recommend a 16-h infection period to allow for spore adhesion to exposed extracellular matrix in larvae with induced epithelial cell loss and subsequent initiation of tissue invasion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Thereafter, non-invasive spores loosely attached to the larval epidermis are removed by a thorough washing routine and antifungal treatment may be initiated.",
    "After the 16-h infection period, remove the medium from each well, as described above, and add 1 mL of fresh E3 medium.\nRemove dead and moribund larvae from each well using a Pasteur pipette and tabulate the number of fatalities.\nConsider preserving the removed larvae for fungal burden determination (as described below).\nNote: Dead larvae can be commonly recognized by pale color and curled tails (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). If uncertain, lack of heart pulsation may be verified with a stereomicroscope. With high-inoculum infection, it is not uncommon to even find some heavily disintegrated larvae. Moribund larvae are defined as displaying no swimming motions even after gentle probing with a Pasteur pipette.\nPerform at least 3 additional wash steps with 1 mL of fresh E3.\nMake sure to remove about 90% of the medium in each wash step to ensure complete removal of residual spores.\nOptional: After the last wash step, (investigational) antifungal drugs may be added to the well. We recommend performing a) in vitro-efficacy testing against the studied fungus and b) toxicity testing in uninfected larvae with and without induced epithelial cell loss prior to the actual experiment. This will allow for selection of at least two potentially effective and non-toxic concentrations for in vivo efficacy studies. Even with prior toxicity testing, an uninfected toxicity control with and without induced epithelial cell loss should be part of each in-vivo experiment to monitor toxicity (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nCAUTION: Some antifungal agents (e.g., amphotericin B) are photosensitive and should be stored in a light-protected manner.\nNote: We do not recommend adding antifungal treatment during the 16-h infection period. Otherwise, effective drug concentrations would solely inhibit or kill the spores in the aqueous environment and no information would be obtained regarding antifungal in-vivo activity against the invasive fungal morphotypes.",
    "Incubate plates at 28°C on a nutator.\nRemove and count dead and moribund larvae at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection.\nConsider preserving the removed larvae for fungal burden determination.\nAt 72 h post-infection, euthanize the remaining larvae by addition of ice-cold E3 medium and either preserve them for fungal burden determination or dispose them in an appropriate bio-safety container.\nCAUTION: The use of older larvae (≥ 8 dpf) may be associated with enhanced institutional and veterinarian oversight. Using our 72-h post-infection monitoring scheme, experiments are terminated on day 7 post-fertilization. Of note, our definition includes the 16-h exposure time as part of the 72-h monitoring window (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Otherwise, the monitoring period would extend into day 8 post-fertilization.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1193-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Experimental timeline for induction of epithelial cell loss, fungal infection, treatment, and monitoring of larval zebrafish\nFour days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae expressing the genetically encoded enzyme NTR in the surface epithelial cells, which upon exposure to metronidazole (MTZ), induces epithelial cell extrusion and apoptosis, are seeded in 12-well plates (up to 15 larvae per well). Larvae are treated with 10 mM MTZ for 5 h, washed (W), and incubated in fungal spore suspensions for 16 h. Survival is monitored for 72 h post-infection. Dead or moribund larvae are collected at 16, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection and preserved for fungal burden determination. Larvae surviving for 72 h post-infection are euthanized (E) and preserved for fungal burden determination. Treatments modulating epithelial cell loss and/or antifungal prophylaxis may be added during MTZ exposure (treatment period 1, T1). Antifungal therapy may be added after the 16-h infection period (T2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1193-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Monitoring R. arrhizus infection after induced cell loss in larval zebrafish",
    "Four days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae in plain E3 medium (A) and E3 medium inoculated with 5×106/mL R. arrhizus sporangiospores (B). Individual larvae in plain (C) and R. arrhizus-infected medium (D).\n(E) Representative example of a zebrafish larva that has succumbed to infection. Note the adherent fungal spores and hyphal elements and change in color of the body of the larva, two attributes associated with mortality.\nFungal burden determination by quantitative PCR\nTiming: 1 day (after collecting the larval samples during post-infection monitoring)\nTo quantify fungal tissue burden in R. arrhizus-infected larvae, we recommend using a well-established quantitative 18S PCR assay (Ibrahim et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). In addition to increasing mortality, verification of inoculum-dependently increasing fungal tissue burden is a suitable way to validate the infection assay when training new experimenters. Furthermore, we have shown that effective antifungal therapy significantly reduces fungal tissue burden in zebrafish larvae with induced epithelial cell loss (Wurster et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), suggesting that fungal burden determination is a suitable assay to corroborate therapeutic efficacy of investigational antifungal treatments in this in vivo platform.\nCollect dead and moribund larvae at 16, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection as well as the surviving larvae euthanized at 72 h post-infection in 2-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nWash the collected larvae three times with 1 mL of cold E3 medium in order to remove loosely attached spores from the larval epidermis.\nAfter the last wash step, remove the supernatant and add 500 μL of fresh E3 medium.\nStore the samples at −80°C until further use.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 12 months.\nOn the day of DNA extraction, thaw and combine all samples from different collection time points for each experimental cohort.\nCentrifuge the samples for 5 min at 5000 g.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of filter-sterilized cold E3 medium.\nTransfer the suspension to a 2-mL screw-cap cryovial containing 15 acid-washed glass beads (3 mm, Sigma-Aldrich).\nHomogenize samples with two 15-s bursts in a bead beater (e.g., Mini Bead Beater, Bio-Spec, Bartlesville, OK) and immediately place the homogenates on crushed ice.\nIsolate genomic DNA from an aliquot of the larval homogenate (80 μL) using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\nPause point: Isolated DNA can be stored at −80°C for several years.\nAnalyze each sample in triplicate by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers and dually labeled hybridization probes specific for R. arrhizus 18S rRNA genes according to a previously published protocol (Ibrahim et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nInterpolate the cycle threshold of each sample from a seven-point standard curve prepared by spiking batches of 15 uninfected larvae with known concentrations of sporangiospores of the R. arrhizus strain used for the infection experiment (102 to 108 spores / mL larval homogenate).\nNote: To quantify fungal tissue burden after yeast infection, qPCR can be replaced by a simple colony formation assay. To that end, aliquots of homogenized larval tissue are diluted 1:100 with sterile E3 medium and 10-μL aliquots of the dilution are streaked on yeast extract, peptone, dextrose (YPD) agar. Colonies are counted after 24 h of incubation at 37°C."
