  "procedures": [
    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Netherlands Experiments on Animals Act and in accordance with the European Council (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animal use for scientific purposes.\n1 . Embryo preparation protocol\nIncubation of the fertilized chicken eggs\n\t\nStore freshly fertilized chicken eggs at 15 °C for up to one week.\nTo incubate the fertilized eggs, place them vertically with the pointy side down into a 37 °C, humidified incubator. Turning the eggs during incubation is not necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: Write the starting date of incubation of top of the egg using a permanent marker.\nPreparing up to 5-day (120 h) old embryo's (HH stage 26-28)22\nPreparation of working area\n\t\t\nWarm up a heating plate to 37 °C.\nPlace a metal egg holder (Figure 1A,B), a metal weighing boat holder (Figure 1C,D), and a 10 mL Erlenmeyer filled with PBS on the heating plate.\nFill a weighing boat (85 mm × 85 mm × 25 mm) with a 10 mm layer of ultrasound gel and place the filled weighing boat in the prewarmed metal weighing boat holder.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Filling the weighing boat with ultrasound gel will raise the embryo and CAM. This can be beneficial for the injection or imaging of the embryo and CAM but is not necessary for taking the embryo and CAM out of the eggshell.\nPrepare a few pieces of tape (around 3 cm length) with part of one end folded back on itself so that does not stick anymore.\nTaking the egg content out of the eggshell\n\t\t\nTake a 5-day old incubated fertilized egg and transfer it to the prewarmed metal egg holder (Figure 1A,B). Make sure to keep the egg in the same orientation (i.e., date on top).",
    "NOTE: It is important to keep the egg in the same orientation to keep the air sac and the embryo and CAM at the same position in the top of the egg.\nUse the pointy back of a tweezer (or similar; Figure 1E) to make a small indent on the very top of the egg (where the date is written) (Figure 2A).\nUse the pointy back of the tweezers to make a second indent on the side of the egg around 2/3 down the egg (Figure 2B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to make the indent too big and create a hole. If by accident a hole is created, seal the hole with tape and do not make another indent.\nUsing the larger tweezers (Figure 1E), take out a small piece of eggshell from the indented area on top of the egg (with written date). Make sure the air sac in the top of the eggshell makes contact with the air outside the egg, but do not penetrate the shell too deep.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: If the shell is penetrated too deep when making the top indent, the embryo and CAM could be damaged and the embryo will not survive the removal from the shell. It is important that the small hole on the top creates air contact between the inside and outside of the egg. If this is not done, a vacuum will be created in the next steps of the procedure which will result in large air bubbles getting trapped under the CAM making the embryo and CAM useless. To check the position of the air sac inside the egg, a light source can be used since its position is not always exactly at the top and can also be more to the side.",
    "Use a 5 mL syringe and 19 G needle to penetrate the shell through the second indent on the side 2/3 down the egg and withdraw ~2 mL of egg white (Figure 2C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Make sure the needle is pointing down towards the bottom of the egg to prevent the chance of damaging the embryo and CAM. This step creates a larger air pocket in the top of the egg needed for removal of the egg content. If a hole is accidentally created instead of an indent in step 1.2.2.3, puncture the tape with the needle for the withdrawal of the egg white. Reseal the puncture with another piece of tape.\nTake out the needle and use tape to seal the gap on the side (Figure 2D).\n\t\t\tNOTE: To prevent egg white from leaking out of the egg, the top hole can be closed using a finger before taking the needle out. If egg white keeps leaking out with the tape already in place, first remove the egg white with a piece of tissue to make sure the tape sticks properly.\nEmpty the syringe by adding the egg white to the weighing boat.\nUse the large tweezers (Figure 1E) to enlarge the small opening on the top of the egg (Figure 2E). When looking inside the egg through the opening on the top, the embryo and CAM are visible. Keep locating the embryo and CAM while taking away as much of the eggshell as possible (Figure 2F) .\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Keep on moving the egg to maintain maximum visibility on the position of the embryo and CAM inside the shell. Make sure the edge of the opening in the shell does not go lower than the CAM. Besides this, do not penetrate the inner membrane and prevent sharp edges.",
    "After creating the opening, turn the egg 180° and place the egg back in the egg holder in such a way that the created opening at the top of the egg is now facing towards the bottom. The embryo will float up and will become invisible from the bottom (Figure 2G) which takes 1-2 min. Make sure the whole embryo and CAM (including all the vessels) have disappeared and only yolk is visible before proceeding to the next step (Figure 2H).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: If the embryo is still visible from the bottom after 2 min, turn the egg clockwise for 1-2 min. This will help the embryo and CAM to float up.\nRemove the tape from the side opening. Look whether the inside of the egg now bulges out of the bottom opening. If this is the case, proceed to the next step. If not, use the needle on the syringe to puncture the opening on the side once more to release the vacuum in the egg. Make sure to point upwards with the needle to prevent the chance of puncturing the yolk sack. Continue until the egg bulges out of the bottom opening.\nWhile holding the bottom of the egg close to the weighing boat in the metal weighing boat holder (Figure 1C,D), gently but quickly make a horizontal scratch in the membrane over the entire width of the opening using one of the sharp points of the small tweezer (Figure 1F) and gently drop the egg content into the weighing boat (Figure 2I).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: If the egg content does not come out, use the needle on the syringe to puncture the side opening again with the needle pointing upwards.",
    "If the embryo is in the weighing boat sideways, it will usually go up by itself. If this does not happen, use a piece of tissue paper to reposition the embryo. Put one side of the tissue paper on the embryo, drag the tissue paper to the other end, and release the tissue paper with a few drops of ~30 µL of PBS (37 °C) using a plastic Pasteur pipet.\nVisually check whether the embryo is alive by ensuring the heartbeat is still present, the CAM vessels are intact and there is no bleeding, and there is no leakage of yolk. If one of these things is not correct, discard the embryo and CAM because it will not be viable.\nMake sure the embryo and CAM are kept at 37 °C and do not dry out because this will make the CAM vessels deteriorate and eventually the embryo will die. To prevent this, regularly put small drops of ~30 µL of 37 °C PBS on the embryo and CAM.\nPreparing 6 to 7-day (144-168 h) old embryo's (HH stage 28-32)22\nPreparation of working area\n\t\t\nPrepare the stage as described in section 1.2.1.\nTaking the egg content out of the eggshell\n\t\t\nTwo hours in advance of the experiment, take a 6 to 7-day old incubated egg and rotate the egg 180° inside the incubator so that the top of the egg is facing towards the bottom. After 1 h, rotate the egg back to its original position and leave for another 1 h.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Rotating the egg 2 h in advance of the experiment will make it easier to take the egg content out of the shell.\nAfter rotating, take the egg from the incubator.\nPerform step 1.2.2.2 until step 1.2.2.4.",
    "Use a 5 mL syringe and 19 G needle to penetrate the shell through the second indent on the side 2/3 down the egg and withdraw between 5-6 mL of egg white. Make sure the needle is pointing down towards the bottom of the egg.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: With the 5 mL syringe we used, it is possible to withdraw up to 6 mL so only one penetration is needed.\nTake out the needle and use a piece of tape to seal the gap on the side (Figure 2D).\nEmpty the syringe by adding the egg white to the ultrasound gel in the weighing boat.\nUse the large tweezers (Figure 1E) to enlarge the small opening on the top of the egg (Figure 2E). Try to make the opening as big as possible but make sure the edge of the opening in the shell does not go lower than the CAM. Besides this, do not penetrate the inner membrane and try to prevent sharp edges.\nFill a syringe with ~1 mL more of 37 °C PBS than the withdrawn volume during step 1.3.2.4.\nTake off the tape from the side gap, penetrate the gap with the filled syringe, and empty it into the shell. Make sure the needle is pointing down towards the bottom of the egg.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Since egg white has a higher viscosity (~160 cP)27 than PBS (~1 cP), substituting the egg white with PBS reduces both tension and stress on the embryo and CAM while taking the egg content out of the shell.\nTake out the needle and quickly reseal the gap with a piece of tape (Figure 2D).",
    "Turn the egg 180° and place the egg back in the egg holder in such a way that the created opening at the top of the egg is now facing towards the bottom. Turn the egg clockwise until the whole embryo and CAM (including all the vessels) have disappeared and only yolk is visible.\nPerform step 1.2.2.10 until step 1.2.2.14.\nPreparing 8-day (192 h) old embryo's (HH stage 32-35)22\nPreparation of working area\n\t\t\nWarm up a heating plate to 37 °C.\nPlace a metal weighing boat holder (Figure 1C,D) and a 10 mL Erlenmeyer filled with PBS on the heating plate.\nTake a shallow container of 170 x 110 x 70 mm, or similar, and fill the container with 1 L of 37 °C PBS.\nPlace a weighing boat (85 × 85 × 25 mm) in a 90 mm diameter Petri dish. Place the Petri dish and the weighing boat at the bottom of the container and make sure they are completely submerged.\nTaking the egg content out of the eggshell\n\t\t\nTwo hours in advance of the experiment, take an 8-day old incubated egg and rotate the egg 180° inside the incubator so that the top of the egg is facing towards the bottom. After 1 h, rotate the egg back to its original position and leave for another 1 h.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Rotating the egg 2 h in advance of the experiment will make it easier to take the egg content out of the shell.\nTake an 8-day old incubated egg from the incubator.\nHold the egg horizontally and use the pointy back of the large tweezer (Figure 1E) to make a small indent 1/2 down the egg. Continue making small indents in a ring pattern 360° round the eggshell. Use a spacing of ~10 mm between the indents.",
    "​NOTE: During this procedure, small cracks can start to form between the indents.\nAfter creating the small indents all around the shell, make one bigger hole by cracking the shell between two small indents using the pointy back of the large tweezer.\nCompletely submerge the egg in the 37 °C PBS and keep it submerged for 5 min. After 5 min, keep the egg close to the weighing boat inside the container. Put the top of both thumbs in the large hole and gently open the egg. The egg will crack along the small indents.\nWhen the crack is formed all the way around the eggshell, gently try to pull the two eggshell pieces apart and keep on gently moving the two pieces back and forth until the egg content is separated from the shell. Then, gently drop the egg content into the weighing boat.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: By moving the two pieces of eggshell back and forth, more PBS will flow into the eggshell, which will help in separating the egg content from the shell. Sometimes, a bit of egg white will stick to the inside of the eggshell. When this happens, use the tweezers to separate the egg white from to shell.\nSlowly raise the Petri dish containing the weighing boat and egg content from the PBS. When out of the PBS, slightly tilt the weighing boat to remove the excess PBS.\nPlace the weighing boat containing the egg content into the metal weighing boat holder and move to the desired experimental setup.\n2. Selected Applications\nInjecting microbubbles and/or other solutions into the CAM vessels\n\t\nPreparing the injection setup\n\t\t\nPull glass needles from glass capillary tubes using a micro forge (Figure 3A) or buy pulled glass capillary needles.",
    "In case the tip of the glass capillary needle is not beveled, break off a small part of the tip of the needle. Fill the glass needle with mineral oil and place it in a micro-injection system. Make sure there are no air bubbles in the mineral oil in the glass needle.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The mineral oil is added as per instruction of the manufacturer of the injection system we used.\nEmpty the pulled-glass capillary needle as far as the micro-injection system allows and partly refill the glass needle with air.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The small bit of air will prevent the mixture of the mineral oil and the to-be-injected solution.\nPut 10 µL of the desired solution, in this protocol microbubbles, on a piece of waxy film (Figure 3B). If more than one solution is needed, solutions can be mixed before pipetting7.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Before filling the needle with microbubbles, leave the microbubble drop on the waxy film for ~1 min so that the microbubbles will float to the top of the drop and get concentrated. For the F-type custom-made ultrasound contrast agent28, this concentration step will increase the to-be-injected microbubble concentration with ~30%. The post-injection concentration in the chicken embryo blood will be between 32 x 103 microbubbles/µL for 5-day old embryos and 19 x 103 microbubbles/µL for 6-day old embryos.\nFill the glass needle with the microbubble and/or other solution by positioning the glass needle tip into the drop on the waxy film. When aspirating microbubbles, make sure to position the needle tip in the top of the liquid drop to aspirate the microbubble enriched solution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Before injecting microbubbles, raise the tip of the glass needle to its highest point and wait for ~2 min. This will ensure the microbubbles will concentrate into the tip of the glass needle.",
    "Injection into the CAM vessels\n\t\nBefore injection, look at the CAM under a stereo microscope and select the best vessel to inject. Always inject into one of the veins of the embryo. These are the vessels in which the blood flow moves towards the embryo. Veins are lighter in color than the arteries due to the oxygenated blood29. In addition, veins are always on top of the artery with two exceptions namely the anterior and posterior vitelline veins (i.e., the less branched veins, indicated with asterisks in Figure 6A,B) which do not have an artery in their surroundings.\n\t\tNOTE: Injecting into one of the branches will limit the obstruction of the blood flow during injection. Good injections sites have been indicated with arrowheads in Figure 6A,B. It is crucial to inject into the vein, since this will force the injected substance to flow towards the embryo. Besides this, injecting into the artery will result in a massive bleeding when removing the glass needle which will kill the embryo.\nPosition the glass needle and the embryo in such a way that the glass needle tip and the selected vein are in the same focal plane and in the same line of direction. Try to position the needle as horizontal as possible parallel to the selected vein. The needle tip should touch the vessel wall.\n\t\t​NOTE: By positioning the glass needle as horizontal as possible, the chance of piercing through the entire vessel is lower.\nAfter positioning, slowly advance and penetrate the vessel wall with the glass needle. During penetration, the CAM will first be pushed away by the movement of the glass needle. Keep advancing the glass needle until the vessel wall is penetrated.",
    "NOTE: If by accident the vessel is pierced through and through, slowly retract the needle to get back into the lumen. When back inside the lumen, slightly lift the needle up and move forward along the vessel to reposition the needle.\nAfter penetration, slightly retract the glass needle to better position the tip inside the vessel lumen and move the glass needle sideways to check it is not attached to the vessel wall. Slowly inject a small amount of the solution to confirm that the tip is positioned inside the vessel lumen (Figure 3C).\nMake sure the injected solution follows the blood flow. If it does not, slightly move the glass needle and keep injecting small amounts until the glass needle is positioned correctly17.\nWhen the desired amount is injected, leave the glass needle in the vessel for ~15 s to prevent a massive bleeding. Then, move the glass needle a little bit sideways, up and down, and back and forth a few times to allow a gently retraction of the glass needle.\n\t\t​NOTE: Some bleeding is normal. For every injection use a new glass needle because the glass needle gets easily clogged with and blunt from egg white.\nMicroscopy imaging of the embryo and/or CAM vessels\n\t\nPreparing holder with acoustic membrane\n\t\t\nTake a cell culture chamber consisting of a square plastic holder with two parallel 50 µm thick acoustically transparent polycarbonate membranes26, further referred to as holder with acoustic membrane. Close both ports with a lid.\nUse a scalpel to remove one of the two membranes from the holder with acoustic membrane.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: To remove the membrane, cut the membrane just next to the glue line on the plastic. Be careful not to slip off from the edge to prevent damage to the other membrane.",
    "Prepare ~15 mL of 2% agarose in demi water solution by heating to between 80-95 °C in a small glass beaker. Cool the glass beaker with the dissolved agarose solution under a running cold-water tap.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the agarose is too hot it will melt the acoustic membrane which will create an uneven surface.\nWhen the solution is cooled down to around 37 °C, slowly pour the solution in the holder with acoustic membrane until it fills up the entire holder. Slightly tilt the holder with acoustic membrane so the agarose layer will distribute evenly inside the plastic frame (Figure 4A). Make sure the agarose layer is flat and let the agarose set at room temperature.\nRemoving embryo and CAM from yolk sack and placing on holder with acoustic membrane\n\t\t\nTake out the egg content out of the egg as described in section 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.\nIf needed, inject the CAM with microbubbles and/or other solution(s) as described in section 2.1.2.\nFill a 1 L Petri dish with ~500 mL of 37 °C PBS and place the holder with acoustic membrane with agarose on the bottom of the dish. Make sure the agarose layer is facing up.\nUse small scissors to quickly cut into the membrane of the yolk sack, also called Vitellus membrane, around the entire CAM while the egg content is in the weighing boat (Figure 4B). Keep the scissors in the same position and rotate the weighing boat while cutting for better precision and more speed.",
    "NOTE: From the moment the first cut is made, the yolk will start to leak. This reduces the visibility of the embryo and CAM. Try to cut all the way around the CAM within 6-7 cuts. This should not take much longer than 20 s. The small tweezers (Figure 1F) can be used to hold the edge of vitelline membrane and prevent cutting into the CAM.\nUse a tablespoon to scoop up the cut-out membrane containing the embryo and CAM from the weighing boat. Slowly raise the spoon from the weighing boat and visually inspect whether the cut-out membrane containing the embryo and CAM are still attached to the remainder yolk sack membrane. When this is the case, use the scissors to make an extra cut. While scooping, slightly tilt the spoon to get rid of as much yolk as possible but do not let it dry out. Transfer the cut-out membrane containing the embryo and CAM to the 1 L Petri dish, submerge in the 37 °C PBS, and remove the spoon.\nWhen the membrane containing the embryo and CAM is submerged in the 37 °C PBS, use the small tweezers (Figure 1F) to grab one edge of the membrane and gently swirl around the membrane to get rid of the yolk that is still attached.\nWhen all the yolk is removed, use the small tweezers to move the membrane containing the embryo and CAM and position it above the holder with acoustic membrane.\nUse one insect specimen pin to pin down the membrane containing the embryo and CAM in one corner. Avoid piercing the vessels in the CAM and only pin down the membrane.\nUse a second insect specimen pin to pin down the membrane containing the embryo and CAM on the diagonally opposite corner.",
    "Slowly lift the holder with the acoustic membrane containing the embryo and CAM from the 37 °C PBS. Slightly tilt the holder to get rid of most of the PBS.\nUse the small tweezers (Figure 1F) to stretch and evenly distribute the membrane containing the embryo and CAM over the holder with acoustic membrane and pin down the rest of the membrane. Make sure the membrane containing the embryo and CAM is slightly stretched to assure it is flat (Figure 4C).\nPlace the holder with acoustic membrane with the pinned down membrane containing the embryo and CAM into a microscopy setup which is kept at 37 °C.\nPlace a coverslip or an acoustically and optically transparent membrane (depending on the desired objective and use of ultrasound or not) on top of the region of interest on the embryo or CAM (Figure 4D) to allow optical visualization.\nUltrasound imaging of the chicken embryo and/or CAM vessels\n\t\nUltrasound imaging from the side of the chicken embryo and CAM vessels\n\t\t\nTake out the egg content as described in section 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4. However, do not use a standard weighing boat. Instead, use a custom-made weighing boat with one acoustically transparent wall.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The standard weighing boat was adjusted by cutting off one side of the weighing boat and replacing it with a window of polyester foil which was glued together using epoxy glue.\nSubmerge the preferred ultrasound transducer in a 37 °C water bath and position in the desired spot with the required standoff distance.\nPlace the weighing boat in the water bath in such a way that the transparent wall is facing the transducer. Make sure the weighing boat is deep enough to be level with the transducer but avoid water getting into the weighing boat (Figure 5A).",
    "If desired, add another setup to the top of the embryo or CAM vessels, like a microscope or a laser (Figure 5A).\nUltrasound imaging from the top of the embryo and CAM vessels without acoustic interference\n\t\t\nFill a 2 L beaker glass with 37 °C PBS. Place a 500 mL beaker glass upside down on the bottom of the 2 L beaker glass. Avoid air inside the 500 mL beaker glass.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The 500 mL beaker glass is meant to raise the weighing boat containing the egg content closer to the PBS surface. By substituting the beaker for objects with other sizes, the distance between the transducer and the egg content can be varied.\nPlace the filled 2 L beaker glass with the 500 mL beaker glass inside in a 37 °C water bath.\nTake out the egg content as described in section 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.\nWet the egg content with 37 °C PBS and cover the embryo with clear cling film. This can be done to keep the embryo in the same position and prevent it from rotating or floating away.\n\t\t\tNOTE: By wetting the egg content with PBS, it will become less sticky which makes it easier to cover the egg content with clear cling film.\nPlace the weighing boat with the egg content in a 90 mm diameter Petri dish and slowly submerge the Petri dish in the PBS (Figure 5B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Using two clamps on the sides of the Petri dish opposite to one another makes it easier to submerge the Petri dish.\nPosition the ultrasound transducer with the desired standoff distance.\nUltrasound imaging of the chicken embryo and CAM vessels with a movable transducer\n\t\t\nTake out the egg content as described in section 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.",
    "Prepare a 2% agarose solution in demi water by heating the solution up to between 80-95 °C in a small glass beaker. Cool the glass beaker with the dissolved agarose solution under a running cold water tab.\nPour the agarose solution into a flat container to create an about 1 mm thick agarose pad. When completely cooled down and set, cut the agarose pad to the desired size using a scalpel.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The thickness of the agarose pad can be changed to obtain the desired focal distance necessary for correct functioning of the ultrasound transducer.\nPlace the agarose pad on top of the embryo and CAM (Figure 5C). Add a few drops of ~30 µL of 37 °C PBS onto the top of the agarose pad to create a thin PBS layer between the agarose pad and the transducer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Using PBS will prevent the transducer from sticking to the agarose pad. This is beneficial when, for example, using a motor to mechanically move a two-dimensional transducer to make a three-dimensional scan (Figure 9B)11. When the transducer does not need to be moved, the PBS can also be substituted with ultrasound gel.\nPosition the desired ultrasound transducer."
