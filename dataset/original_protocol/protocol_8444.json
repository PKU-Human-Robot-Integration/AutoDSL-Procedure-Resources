    "Animal care and handling followed the institutional guideline of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST).\nNOTE: The procedure for acquiring the VEP signal from a mouse in vivo consists of four steps: (1) sensor assembly, (2) animal preparation, (3) VEP measurement, and (4) signal processing.\n1. Sensor Assembly\nPrepare sixteen pins for one non-invasive electrode.\n\tNOTE: Each pin-type electrode consists of three parts: a probe head plunger, an internal spring, and a barrel as shown in Figure 1a. The length of each pin is 13 mm, and the adjustable spring pre-load length is 1 mm.\nCut two pieces of glass fiber substrates (thickness: 1.5 mm) with the size of 15 mm × 17 mm (width × height).\n\tNOTE: The non-conducting fiberglass substrate functions as an insulator, which separates the multiple signals acquired simultaneously from the mouse's scalp.\nMake sixteen holes of diameter 1.2 mm each using a precision engraving machine, as shown in Figure 1c.\n\t\nSpread out the probe coordination evenly at an interval of 2 mm onto the flat substrate: +7/0, +2/-2, +2/0, +2/+2, 0/-4, 0/-2, 0/0 (bregma), 0/+2, 0/+4, -2/-3, -2/-1, -2/+1, -2/+3, -4/-2, -4/0, -4/+2 (anteroposterior/lateral with basis of bregma, in mm)24,25,26.\nStack two substrates and apply one drop of fast-acting adhesive glue between substrate layers, producing a double-layer of 3 mm thickness supporting sixteen stable and parallel electrodes during signal acquisition.\nAssemble the sixteen electrodes onto the substrate one-by-one manually.\n\tNOTE: The smaller hole diameter stops each electrode at the same length. Each hole diameter is slightly smaller than the thickest diameter of a barrel within the single pin (1.3 mm) which enables the tight fixing of electrodes without any loosening.\nSolder and link each electrode's ending solder-cup part to the touch proof connector.",
    "Cover and hide the naked junctions with heat-shrink tubing for electrical insulation.\n2. Animal Preparation\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine:xylazine 100:10 (100 mg/mL:10 mg/mL) mixture with the amount of 10 µL/g of body weight.\n\tNOTE: Check the animal's anesthesia is adequate by pulling one leg or tweaking the tail before starting preparation.\nApply eye ointment to keep the mouse's cornea moist with a cotton swab.\nRemove the hairs around the head and shoulders with a hair-clipper, and then spread commercially available depilatory cream and keep it on this area for 3-4 min.\nRemove the applied depilatory with a spatula, and then wipe up the rest with wet wipes applying water several times.\n3. VEP Measurement\nNOTE: The whole VEP measuring process took place in a dark Faraday cage (width × depth × height: 61 × 61 × 60 cm).\nMount the mouse's head onto the stereotaxic frame by placing ear bars into the mouse's ear canals and tightening them precisely in place.\nMount the sensor into the custom-made electrode holder (Figure 1b) and fix the sensor holder onto the stereotaxic frame, as shown in Figure 1d.\nLocate the flexible EEG sensor, considering both the reference electrode position and the bregma position27. After that, very carefully lower the sensor in the vertical direction so that the arrayed electrode plungers contact the mouse's scalp evenly onto the curved margin.\n\tNOTE: The lowered distance is smaller than 1 mm, which is the adjustable length of the plunger.\nCheck that the impedances are within the proper range from 100 kΩ to 2 MΩ. Reposition the electrode when any impedance value of the pin is out of the range28.\nPosition the photo stimulator 20 cm away from the mouse's eyes.",
    "Before starting the experiment, adapt the mouse for 10 min in the dark cage for dark visual adaptation.\n\t\nSet the parameters of the experimental devices as follows: Sampling frequency: 500 Hz; Notch filtering: 60 Hz; Inter-stimulus interval: 10 s; Flash duration: 10 ms; number of flash stimuli: 100 trials/subject.\n\t\tNOTE: The flash light is a white light LED illumination which has 550 ± 20 % lx with a distance of 20 cm.\n4. VEP Responses Signal Processing Procedures\nEpoching\nFor continuously measuring serial data, extract each epoch to create single-trial VEP segments from the pre-stimulus period (-300 ms) to the post-stimulus period (600 ms), based on the flash stimulus onset.\n\t\tNOTE: Since we repeatedly provide flash stimulation over 100 trials for each subject, a total of 100 VEP epochs for each mouse are extracted in this step. EEG epoching is a process in which specific time-windows are extracted from the continuously measured EEG signal data.\nRe-reference (average reference)\nCompute the average of EEG signals across all fourteen electrode channels at each time point and then subtract the averaged value from each channel. Repeat this procedure for all the VEP epochs.\nPerform band-pass filtering of signal from ~1-100 Hz using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.\nBaseline correction\nCalculate the average of the EEG signals in the pre-stimulus period (baseline period, -300 ~ 0 ms) for each channel, then subtract this average from each point in the waveform (-300 ~ 600 ms). This adjusts the amplitude axis of VEP responses to facilitate the observation of brain wave changes after stimulation. Repeat this step for all of the VEP epochs.\nGrand VEP Responses",
    "Average the single-trial VEP epochs to create single-subject averaged VEP waveforms for each channel. Then, calculate the grand ensemble average of VEP responses for each channel with respect to all the subjects.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
