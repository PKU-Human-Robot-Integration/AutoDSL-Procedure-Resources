Confirmation of successful labeled probe will be ensured in this section.\nPrepare the PCR reaction as follows in 200 μL PCR tubes (Principle behind each setup is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2033-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Workflow for Part II\nBiotin-labeled Probe Preparation (Timing ∼ 4 h). A set of probe samples with small volumes (20 μL) should be prepared for pre-test condition to test out the optimal conditions for probe generation. This should include a probe sample, a positive control sample, and a negative control sample. While the probe sample contains all the required ingredients (including primers, polymerase, PCR buffer, dATP, dTTP, dGTP and biotin CTP), the positive control contains everything except for biotin CTP, and negative control contains everything except for plasmid DNA. Following PCR procedure, probe sample should be biotin-labeled while controls should not. Resolving the PCR products on gel to visualize should obtain a clear band slightly bigger in bp size comparing with the positive control, where negative control should show blank.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2033_10.csv\nCritical: It is important to make sure that the reverse primer is added at least at a 4:1 ratio to the forward primer to ensure the formation of a desired circ-probe product. DO NOT use 1:1 primer ratio in this reaction.\nCritical: The Biotin-16-dCTP could be changed to Biotin-16-dGTP or Biotin-16-dATP or Biotin-16-dTTP. This depends on which nucleobase presents the most in the probe sequence.\nNote: We provided in the table as volume for easier preparation. The recommended minimal concentration of template plasmid should be 200 ng/μL.",
    "Mix the reaction mixture by tapping the tube for 5 s and centrifuge the PCR tubes for 5 s using minicentrifuge to settle the reaction mixtures at the bottom of the tubes.\nSet up the Mastercycler program as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2033_11.csv\nResolve the PCR products on an ethidium bromide stained 2% agarose gel for 30 min at 100 volts and visualize with an ultraviolet transilluminator.\nNote: Positive control fragment should show a strong single band at the expected size (188 bp); Target fragment should show a clear single band at the expected size (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], slightly larger than positive control owing to biotin label); Negative control fragment should show blank. (? troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nOptimize the best conditions for probe generation and prepare the probes in larger volume according to the experimental design.\nNote: A volume of 200 μL is suggested for most conditions.\nPrepare both the oligo probe and the circular RNA probe as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2033_12.csv\nCritical: It is important to make sure that the reverse primer is added at least at a 4:1 ratio to the forward primer to ensure the formation of a desired circ-probe product. DO NOT use 1:1 primer ratio in this reaction).\n©CAUTION: 50 μL is usually the maximum volume for a thermal cycler to react. Make sure to aliquot the prepared 200 μL PCR mix into 50 μL per tube.\nSet up the Mastercycler conditions as step 3, or an alternative condition based on the pre-test results.\nStore the biotin-labeled probes at −20°C or −80°C for longer storage, or use the probes immediately for the pull-down assay.\nPause point: The probe can be stored at −20°C for 3 months or −80°C for longer periods.\nReaction lysate preparation\nTiming: ∼2 h",
    "In this section, you will prepare samples which you would like to explore binding partners of your target circular RNA.\nAs the circular RNA and protein yield varies between the cell lines, users should adjust the number of cells needed to extract at least 500 μg proteins for each pull-down assay. For users who would like to subject the pull-down products for Mass Spectrometry as further application, at least 10 mg proteins for each pull-down assay should be prepared to ensure that at least 1 mg proteins should be pulled down and sent for mass spectrometry analysis.\nCritical: It is important to make sure that the protein concentration meets the requirements for further application. Please consult with Mass Spectrometry Centre for minimum concentration requirement for detection. This might be different for different machines.\nNote: The co-IP buffer is prepared in DEPC water. All experimental consumables including tubes and tips should be all RNase-free. We did not add additional RNase inhibitors. However, if the further application focus on detecting following RNA binding partners, adding RNase inhibitors is necessary in addition to proteinase inhibitors. See following specific steps for Note.\nPrepare cell or tissue samples following a. Cell lysates or b. Tissue lysates.\nCell lysates.\nDiscard the culture medium with suction system in 10-cm dishes of ∼90% confluent cells of interest. Wash three times with PBS and collect them using a cell scraper.\nPellet the cells in a 1.5 mL tube by centrifuging at 25°C for 5 min at 500 ×g. If dealing with the cells with poor adhesive ability, collect the cells using the cell scraper first, pellet the cells as described in this step, disrupt and wash the cells with PBS. Repeat this cycle for 3 times.",
    "Fully discard PBS. Add 400 μL per tube of ice-cold co-IP buffer (1% proteinase inhibitor added).\nNote: Add RNase inhibitors according to manufacturer’s guidelines RNase inhibitor in addition to proteinase inhibitor.\nPipette the samples up and down for 10 times and ensure that the pellets are fully disrupted.\nTissue lysates.\nHomogenize the tissue samples in 700 μL ice-cold co-IP buffer (1% proteinase inhibitor added) until no obvious tissue chunks are seen. This step needs to be performed on ice. An ice bucket is optimal. A homogenizer is recommended in this process. If using handheld mechanical homogenizer, please follow these cleaning up steps to avoid cross contamination:\nPrepare two sets of 15 mL tubes. The number of tubes in each set should equal to the sample size.\nPrepare 7 mL 3% H2O2 (30% H2O2 dilute in DEPC water) in each tube in one set of 15 mL tubes. Prepare 7 mL DEPC water in each tube in the other set. Set all the tubes on ice.\nPut the tip of the homogenizer in 3% H2O2 tube, switch to “ON”, hold for 5 s, and switch to “OFF”. Repeat twice.\nPut the tip of the homogenizer in DEPC water tube, switch to “ON”, hold for 5 s, and switch to “OFF”. Repeat twice. Use Kim wipes to gently dry the tip. Check carefully if any tissue debris gets stuck in the tip.\nNote: Handheld mechanical homogenizer could be substituted with any other kind of homogenizer. Please follow manufacturer’s instructions for the cleaning up steps. Alternatively, if no homogenizer is available, use mortar and pestle instead. To achieve optimal grinding results, put the tissue samples in the mortar, add liquid nitrogen to freeze the samples for a few seconds, and grind. Add ice-cold co-IP buffer and proceed to the next steps.",
    "Sonicate the samples at 4°C at a constant full speed for 10 s for 3 times (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Branson Sonifier 250, Duty cycle “constant”, Output control “4”, press “Hold” for 10 s, break 1 min, repeat for 3 times). Ensure that the liquid is clear and no obvious cell clusters are seen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2033-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Workflow for Part III, IV, V\nLysates preparation, Pull-down Procedure, and Further Application (Total Timing ∼ 6 h). Prepared lysates should be incubated with pre-treated probe (Pre-treat the probe for 95°C 10 min, immediately followed by 0°C ice-water mixture treatment for 5 min) for 2 h at 25°C. The incubated probe-lysates mixture should be subjected to another incubation with washed streptavidin beads for 1 h at 25°C. The probe-lysates-beads mixture should be washed at least 6 times with co-IP buffer and a change to new set of tubes should be ensured at the time of last wash. Further wash should be conducted based on the application needs.\nCentrifuge the lysates at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to get rid of the cell debris.\nCollect supernatant in a new set of 1.5 mL tubes. Discard the pellets.\nDetermine the protein concentrations by the Bradford protein assay following the manufacturer’s instructions using disposable cuvettes and a spectrophotometer at 595 nm wavelength. (? troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nEqualize the concentrations of the protein samples in all the experimental groups using co-IP buffer (1% proteinase inhibitor added).\nNote: Add RNase inhibitors according to manufacturer’s guidelines RNase inhibitor in addition to proteinase inhibitor.\nSave 4% of the total lysates as Input in a new set of 1.5 mL tubes. (? troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nSubject the rest of the protein samples directly into the pull-down process.\nPause point: Protein samples can be stored at −80°C for up to one week.\nCircular RNA pull-down",
    "Timing: ∼ 4 h\nThis section is the pull-down process where circular RNA probe will pulldown the target circular RNA, and further pulldown the binding partners in your interested samples.\nPre-treatment of the Probe (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]②):\nAliquot amount of probe from stocking on a 2 μg- per-1 mg total protein base to a 1.5 mL tube.\nSeal the mouth of the tube with a parafilm to prevent accidental collapse in the subsequent water bath heating step.\nNote: A thermomixer is substitutable for the heating process. However, water bath incubation is highly recommended to achieve optimal outcomes.\nPut the tube in a 95°C water bath for 10 min. Use a tube holder to hold the tube vertical to ensure that the liquid surface is under water bath.\nImmediately take the tube out from water bath and put the tube on icing water (0°C) for 5 min.\nCritical: This step needs to be done very quickly to ensure that the probe stays single-stranded and does not anneal back to form a double-stranded structure.\nAdd the probe into lysates prepared from step 9.\nIncubate the probe-lysate mixture at 25°C on a shaker for 2 h.\nBead Washing is performed as follows (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]③):\nTake out the desired amount of streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads from 4°C fridge (at a 50 μL-per-1 mg total protein base) and resuspend the beads by brief vortexing for 30 s.\nWash every 50 μL Dynabeads in 1.5 mL tube as follows (proportionally increase the amount of buffer in each of the following steps based on the requirement):",
    "Briefly centrifuge the tube in a minicentrifuge to ensure the contents stay at the bottom of the tube. Put the tube with beads on a magnetic rack. Let it stand for 2 min to allow the magnetic beads to settle to one side of the tube.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the beads with 1 mL 1× Washing buffer. Mix the beads well by tapping the tube.\nBriefly centrifuge the tube, magnetize the beads and discard the supernatant. Add 50 μL 1× Washing buffer to the beads and repeat the washing step.\nWash the beads with 50 μL Buffer A twice.\nWash the beads with 50 μL Buffer B once.\nMagnetize the beads, discard the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 50 μL Buffer B. Beads are ready to be used for further steps.\nAdd washed beads to the probe-lysate mixture in step 19.\nMix the beads by inverting the tube for 10 times.\nIncubate the mixture at 25°C for 1 h with gentle shaking.\nBriefly centrifuge the tube, magnetize the beads and discard the supernatant. Start beads washing.\nWash the beads with 200 μL of ice-cold co-IP buffer (1% proteinase inhibitor is NOT required).\nBriefly centrifuge the tube, magnetize the beads and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 25 and step 26 for 6 more times.\nAdd 200 μL of ice-cold co-IP buffer to the magnetic beads. Pipette it up and down until fully mixed (DO NOT shake the tube to avoid any waste of sample on the tube lid) and transfer the mixed solution into a new tube.\nCritical: Change to a new set of tubes can largely reduce nonspecific binding.\nLet the tube stand on the magnetic rack for 2 min. Discard the supernatant and the beads are ready to be used for further applications.\nFurther application",
    "Timing: variable\nThis section is the final step of the pulldown procedure where you will gather results from your pulldown process.\nFollow Option a or b if one wishes to study the circular RNA-protein interaction. Follow option c if miRNA sponge mechanism or detection of any RNA is the subject.\nFor detection of circRNA pulling down protein binding partners by Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, wash the beads twice with PBS.\nCritical: Mass Spectrometry centre usually requires a detergent-free condition. Therefore, PBS wash steps are necessary.\nDiscard PBS as much as possible. Store the beads in −80°C. Send the beads out on dry ice for mass spectrometry detection. Alternatively, elute the beads with 50 μL ddH2O at 60°C for 10 min. Send the eluted sample for mass spectrometry detection.\nFor detection of the circRNA pulling down specific protein, add 40 μL of 1× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol to the magnetic beads. Heat the samples at 95°C for 10 min and proceed to western blotting.\nFor RNA detection, add 300 μL Trizol to the beads. Vortex to ensure maximum elution. Leave on ice for 5 min.
