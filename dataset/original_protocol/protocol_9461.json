    "1) Preparation of Drosophila melanogaster neuronal muscular junction (NMJ)\nPrepare standard Drosophila saline (130 mM NaCl, 36 mM sucrose, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.3 4.\nDissect the preparation in saline (1.1). The Drosophila larvae is pined dorsal side-up in a Sylgard dish; the dorsal side is sectioned longitudinal, and the internal organs are removed. The preparation is then stretched and pined. Several ventral muscles can be then used.\n2) Stimulation and FM staining\nIt is advisable to do all the following steps in low light conditions, in order to protect FM dyes from bleaching.\nFor chemical stimulation of the nerves, high potassium buffer is used. Prepare Drosophila saline (see 1.1) containing 90 mM of KCl and 10 μM of FM1-43 dye. Keep the solution protected from light.\nBath the preparation with the previously prepared buffer for 1 minute at room temperature. \nWash with standard Drosophila saline (1.1) to remove extracellular FM1-43 dye. Proceed rapidly to fixation.\n3) Fixing\nBath the preparation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45 minutes at room temperature. For good preservation of morphological features, glutaraldehyde is preferred to paraformaldehyde.\nWash once with PBS and then leave the preparation submerged for 15 minutes in 100 mM of NH4Cl. This step is done in order to quench the free aldehyde groups of the remaining glutaraldehyde fixative. \nWash the NH4Cl solution out with normal PBS.\n4) Photoconversion\nIncubate the NMJ preparation for 30 minutes at 4°C in PBS containing 1.5 mg ml-1 of diaminobenzidine (DAB). \nPosition the sample under the fluorescent microscope. Find and focus the fluorescent signal using a relatively low magnification water immersion objective (20x 0.5 NA).",
    "Illuminate the sample with the maximum lamp intensity until the FM dye is completely bleached (Figure 1C). To control if photoconversion has occurred, is advisable to check at the sample under transmission light before and after the FM dye-bleaching step. If photoconversion takes place, a dark brown precipitate is expected (Figure 1C). The illumination time is variable, depending upon the illumination strength and also upon the DAB penetration into the preparation. For most preparations, we found illumination times of ~30-45 minutes to be optimal when using a 20x objective. Shorter illumination periods are used for higher magnification objectives (60x).\nFor illumination we prefer to use a mercury lamp, with a lamp housing containing a back mirror, which collects the back-scattered light beams, and therefore increases total intensity.\n5) Processing the sample for EM\nOsmication\n \nPrepare a solution with one volume of osmium tetroxide in tree volumes of water (approx. 300 μl per sample). Work using osmium tetroxide must be done under the hood, using gloves and aye protection equipment.\nIncubate the preparation in the osmium tetroxide solution for 1 hour at room temperature (Under the hood).\nWash extensively with PBS (4-5 times 5 minutes) and transfer each samples to a clean glass flask.\nDehydration\n \nPrepare separate solutions containing 30, 50, 70 90, 95 and 100% of ethanol.\nAdd 1 ml of 30% ethanol to each sample for 5 minutes.\nAdd 1 ml of 50% ethanol to each sample for 5 minutes.\nAdd 1 ml of 70% ethanol to each sample for 5 minutes.\nAdd 1 ml of 90% ethanol to each sample for 5 minutes.\nAdd 1 ml of 95% ethanol to each sample for 5 minutes (repeat 3x).\nAdd 1 ml of 100% ethanol to each sample for 5 minutes (repeat 3x).\nEmbedding and further processing",
    "Mix 1 volume of Epon resin with one volume of ethanol. Add it to the preparation under continuous rotation (2-4 hours).\nPlace the preparation in 100% Epon in open flasks, allow the remaining ethanol to evaporate (4-6 hours).\nPlace the preparation in moulds at 60°C for 36 hours.\nElectron microscopy processing. Process the preparation in 50-80 nm thin sections, using standard ultramicrotomy procedures.\nElectron microscopy imaging\n \nThe preparation is imaged using conventional EM procedures.\n6) Representative Results\nThe expected results are outlined in Figures 1C and 2. The illumination procedure results in the formation of brown DAB precipitate, which will be visible in both fluorescence and transmission imaging. The first occurrence during illumination is the disappearance of fluorescence associated with the FM dye staining. The background fluorescence induced by the aldehyde fixative, in contrast, will be visible throughout the experiment. The bleaching takes place typically in ~10-20 minutes after the start of illumination. Typically no photoconversion product can be observed at this time point.",
    "Illumination should be continued, and after ~10 minutes the preparations will turn to a brown shade due to DAB accumulation (Fig 1Civ) It is unclear why DAB precipitation and FM dye bleaching do not take place simultaneously; it is possible that a relatively large amount of oxidized DAB needs to accumulate before aggregation and precipitation, and that therefore this reaction is slower than the bleaching process. At this stage, however, the preparation is not ready for electron microscopy processing, as the DAB precipitation is likely incomplete. We prefer to wait 5-10 minutes longer, during which the preparation (presynaptic nerve terminal) assumes a dark-brown (or black) color, indicative of complete conversion. A slight conversion of the general surface of the preparation (for example, of the muscle fibers in a neuromuscular junction) can be observed at this stage. It is most likely related to a conversion of DAB induced by autofluorescence (and/or fixative fluorescence), and it is not detrimental to the procedure.\nThe preparation is then processed for electron microscopy, and should be checked for the presence of dark (labeled) vesicles. As we have demonstrated before 5,6, these vesicles are much denser than non-labeled ones, and are therefore easily distinguished (Figure 2B). To increase the chance of distinguishing well the different types of vesicles, no contrast-enhancing post staining of the sections should be performed (no uranyl acetate or lead citrate staining); the osmium staining is sufficient to observe most cellular elements, and is not as dark as DAB precipitate.",

(A) The image shows a nerve terminal containing synaptic vesicles, but not of them are photoconverted; this might be caused by not having enough illumination or poor diaminobenzidine penetration in the tissue.
