    "Neuronal differentiationNeurons are differentiated according to previously published protocols (Shi et al., 2012; Nadadhur et al., 2017), shortly:hiPSCs are passaged onto Geltrex-coated 12-well plates in 1 ml TesRE8 medium with 10 μM RI per well.Refresh all medium every day.After 2 days (or when cells are 100% confluent), add 1 ml neural maintenance medium (NMM) with vitamin A + 1 μM Dorsomorphin + 10 μM SB431542.Refresh all medium every day until Day 12.Note: Between Days 8 and 12 a uniform neuroepithelial sheet should appear (see Figure 1). Prepare a PLO/mLaminin coated 6-well plate as described in the Recipes.Collect neuroepithelial rosette cells (NES cells) by manually cutting them (see description in note) and plate them in the 6-well plate. Note: Prepare fresh pre-warmed NMM with vitamin A + 1 μM Dorsomorphin + 10 μM SB431542 + 10 μM RI. Remove the medium from the 12-well plate, wash the wells with PBS once and add 1 ml of the freshly prepared medium. Sterilize the microscope area with 70% Ethanol and cut the rosettes using a 10 μl tip to mark their borders and to lift them up. Collect the floating rosettes with a 5 ml pipette and move them to the PLO/mLaminin coated 6-well plate with NMM with vitamin A + 1 μM Dorsomorphin + 10 μM SB431542 + 10 μM RI. All rosettes from 1 well of a 12-well plate are plated in 1 well of a 6-well plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190828/20190828191715_9825.jpgFigure 1. Brightfield picture showing neural rosette structures that form between Days 8 and 12. Scale bar = 200 μm.On Day 13, change the medium to 2 ml pre-warmed NMM with vitamin A + 20 ng/ml bFGF + 20 ng/ml EGF.",
    "Every day remove 1 ml of medium and add 1 ml pre-warmed NMM with vitamin A + 40 ng/ml bFGF + 40 ng/ml EGF. When confluent, passage the cells with TrypLE in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio as described in the note below.Notes: Cells can be kept in NES cell stage for 1-4 passages.  Growth factor concentration is double when only half the medium is changed: together with the medium left in the well the concentration will be similar to the concentration in Step A7. TrypLE passage: Remove all medium from the well and add 300 μl pre-warmed TrypLE. Swirl it around the well and incubate for 2 min at room temperature (RT). Add 600 μl of pre-warmed DTI or medium to stop the reaction and collect the cells into a tube containing 5 ml NMM. Spin down at 300 x g for 5 min at RT and re-suspend the pellet in desired medium. To start the neuronal induction, plate the NES cells after a TrypLE passage in a PLO/mLaminin-coated 12-well plate in pre-warmed 1 ml NMM + 20 ng/ml bFGF + 20 ng/ml EGF per well.When cells reach 80%-90% confluence, switch half of the medium (500 μl/well) to pre-warmed N2 medium + 800 ng/ml hSHH.Note: This is considered Day 1 of the differentiation protocol. Until Day 4, refresh half of the medium (500 μl/well) daily with pre-warmed N2 medium + 800 ng/ml hSHH.On Day 5, switch half of the medium (500 μl/well) to pre-warmed NB medium + 40 μM VPA.Until Day 7, refresh half of the medium (500 μl/well) daily with pre-warmed NB medium + 40 μM VPA.Prepare PLO/mLaminin-coated 12-well plates before Day 8 as described in the Recipes.On Day 8, passage the neural progenitors with accutase 1:2 or 1:3 to a new well (see note for explanation).",
    "Plate cells in pre-warmed 1.5 ml NB medium + 20 ng/ml BDNF + 10 ng/ml GDNF + 10 ng/ml IGF1 + 1 μM cAMP.Accutase treatment: Remove all medium, add 300 μl of accutase per well of a 12-well plate and return the plate to the incubator for 5-7 min. By gently tapping the plate, the cells will visibly come off. At this point, collect the cells in a tube, add 5 ml fresh pre-warmed medium, spin at 300 x g for 5 min at RT and re-suspend the pellet in the desired medium. Resuspend carefully; do not break clumps into single cells. Until Day 18 refresh medium three times a week by removing 1 ml of medium and adding 1 ml of pre-warmed NB medium + 30 ng/ml BDNF + 15 ng/ml GDNF + 15 ng/ml IGF1 + 1.5 μM cAMP. On Day 12, prepare a 12-well sandwich plate as described in the note, Figure 2 and Video 1. Coat the plate with Geltrex as described in the Recipes. Plate 25,000 primary rat astrocytes in each well containing pre-warmed DMEM/F12 medium with Glutamax + 10% FBS + 1x NEAA + 1x Pen/Strep.Note: Sandwich plate preparation: Take a 12-well plate and heat up a sterile syringe needle in flame. Punch in 4 corners of each well to make uniform small bumps in the plastic bottom of the well. These bumps will help suspend a coverslip on them, separated by a small distance from the cells in the bottom of the well. See Figure 2 and Video 1. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Sandwich plate Before Day 18, prepare the desired amount of 12-well plates containing 18 mm diameter coverslips and coat with PLO/laminin as described in the Recipes.",
    "Note: Coverslips can be stored by sealing the plate tightly with parafilm for maximum 1 week at 4 °C. On Day 18, make a single-cell suspension of the neurons using accutase as described in the note. Plate 1.5 million cells per 12-well plate on the pre-coated PLO/mLaminin coverslips in pre-warmed 1 ml NB medium + 20 ng/ml BDNF + 10 ng/ml GDNF + 10 ng/ml IGF1 + 1 μM cAMP.Note: Remove all medium, add 300 μl of accutase per well of a 12-well plate and return the plate to the incubator for 10-15 min. By gently tapping the plate, the cells will visibly come off. Dissociate the cells in the accutase using a 1000 μl pipette very slowly and pipet into a 15 ml tube with 5 ml of neurobasal medium. Spin at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. Remove supernatant and very gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of NB medium and try breaking the clumps of cells very gently using a 1000 μl pipette (pipet up and down maximum 3-4 times). Then leave the tube for 2-5 min to let the big clumps settle down at the bottom. Take the supernatant into another tube; thrash the pellet (the big clumps will not have mature cells but mainly proliferating precursor cells). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190828/20190828191814_0954.jpgFigure 2. Sandwich plate preparation. A. Take a 12-well plate and a sterile syringe needle. Flame the needle until it is hot. With the hot needle, make a bump on 4 sides of the well (B-D). The astrocytes will be plated on the bottom of the plate, and a coverslip with neurons can be inverted on top. The coverslip will lean on the bumps. See also Video 1.",
    "On Day 19, turn the coverslips with adhered neurons upside down over the bumps on the astrocyte plates. Note: By now, the astrocytes should have reached 80% confluence in order to support the neurons.  Change half of the medium (500 μl/well) twice a week with pre-warmed NB medium + 40 ng/ml BDNF + 20 ng/ml GDNF + 20 ng/ml IGF1 + 2 μM cAMP.On the day before the second refresh (Day 24/25), add 1 μM AraC to cultures to stop proliferation.Next day (Day 25/26) refresh half of the medium (500 μl/well) with pre-warmed NB medium + 40 ng/ml BDNF + 20 ng/ml GDNF + 20 ng/ml IGF1 + 2 μM cAMP.Keep cultures until Day 37 (see Figure 3), while refreshing medium twice a week as described in Step 21.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190828/20190828191848_7868.jpgFigure 3. Brightfield picture of Day-37 neurons prior to co-culture showing neuronal network formation in sandwich culture. Scale bar = 100 μm.OPC differentiationOPCs are generated according to previously published protocol (Izrael et al., 2007), shortly:hiPSCs are passaged with EDTA and plated on an anti-adherent 6-well plate in 3 ml pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RI + 20 ng/ml T3 per well for embryoid body (EB) formation (see Figure 3).Note: Use 2 wells of iPSCs for 1 well of EBs. The next day (Day 1), refresh ⅔ of the medium: swirl cells to the middle of the wells and carefully aspirate 2 ml of medium. Add 2 ml of pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RI + 20 ng/ml T3.On Day 2, refresh ⅔ of the medium as described in Step B2 with pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RA.",
    "Repeat every other day.On Day 10, plate EBs on Geltrex-coated plate as described in the note. If EBs become very dark, or decrease in density, plate EBs sooner than on Day 10, but not before Day 4. In our experience, Day 8 is mostly ideal (see Figure 4).Note: Plate EBs on geltrex coated plate by collecting the medium with EBs in a 15 or 50 ml tube. Leave the tube for 2-3 min to let the EBs settle. Carefully aspirate most of the medium, and resuspend EBs in the appropriate amount of desired medium (1 ml for a 12-well plate; 2 ml for a 6-well plate). On Days 4-9, EBs are plated in pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RA + 20 ng/ml T3. If EBs are plated on Day 10, NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 20 ng/ml T3 should be used instead.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190828/20190828191918_9445.jpgFigure 4. Brightfield pictures showing embryoid body formation (A) and outgrowth of cells from embryoid bodies after plating on a geltrex-coated plate (B). Scale bars = 500 μm.On Day 10, switch all medium to pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 20 ng/ml T3.From now on: refresh ⅔ of the medium every other day and split cells when they reach 90% density to a new Geltrex-coated plate using accutase. Note: Add RI to medium after passaging to help the cells recover. On Day 18, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7.",
    "On Day 37, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 5 ng/ml bFGF + 5 ng/ml EGF + 1 μg/ml mLaminin + 50 μg/ml Vit C; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7.On Day 39, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 5 ng/ml bFGF + 5 ng/ml EGF + 1 μg/ml mLaminin + 50 μg/ml Vit C + 50 ng/ml noggin; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7.On Day 42, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 1 μg/ml mouse laminin + 50 μg/ml Vit C + 50 ng/ml noggin; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7.Keep OPC cultures in the medium of Step B11 until Day 65 (see Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190828/20190828191952_5355.jpgFigure 5. OPC differentiation. At the end of the OPC differentiation protocol, cells show a glial morphology (A, Day 45) and express OPC markers like OLIG2 (B, Day 65). Scale bars = 100 μm.Neuron-OPC co-cultureAt day 1 of co-culture, move the Day 37 neurons and plate Day 65 OPCs on top:Take a new 12-well plate. Pick the Day 37 neuronal coverslips up with a forceps from the rat astrocyte plate and plate in a new 12-well plate (with neurons on top, so flip coverslip compared to how it was on astrocyte plate).Note: No coating is necessary for the new plate as the neuronal coverslips already contain the coating.  Add 1 ml of pre-warmed neuroglia co-culture medium. Get a plate with Day 65 OPCs.Remove medium and wash plate once with PBS.Remove PBS and add 750 μl accutase to every well (6-well plate).Incubate the plate for 5-10 min at 37 °C.Check if cells are detaching from the plate by gentle tapping; if not, incubate longer.",
    "When cells are detaching, collect cell suspension in a 15 ml tube with 9 ml pre-warmed DMEM/F12.Spin down 5 min at 300 x g at RT.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of pre-warmed neuroglia co-culture medium.Remove 10 μl of cell suspension for cell count.Plate 4 x 105 OPCs per coverslip on a 12-well plate. Refresh ½ of the medium twice a week: remove 500 μl of medium and add 500 μl of new pre-warmed neuroglia co-culture medium.At Day 28 of co-culture, fix cells with 4% PFA for 15-20 min and use coverslips for immunostaining immediately (see Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190828/20190828192027_2085.jpgFigure 6.
