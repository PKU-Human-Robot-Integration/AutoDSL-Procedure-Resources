    "All animals were generated and maintained according to the Home Office and Institutional guidelines (HO# P135148E). All rats were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and given ad libitum access to food and water.\n1. Transcardial perfusion of chilled ACSF\nPrior to all experiments, place ~200 mL of sucrose-ACSF (Table 1) in the freezer at -20 °C (until semi-frozen, for slicing) and a further ~100-200 mL of filtered sucrose-ACSF on ice (for perfusion), bubbling with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2).\nCollect an adult rat from its home cage and place it for ~30 minutes in a holding cage in the procedure room to acclimatize to noise and light levels.\nPrepare the dissection tools (Figure 1A), the perfusion area and the injectable anesthetic (approx. 1 mL of 200 mg/mL sodium pentobarbital for a final concentration of 100 mg/kg).\nPrepare an appropriate anesthesia chamber by placing a small swab of tissue paper or cotton wool inside. Introduce 1-2 mL of volatile isoflurane anesthetic to the absorbent material in the chamber.\nPlace the rat in an anesthesia chamber to sedate. Monitor breathing until the breathing rate drops to ~1 shallow breath per second.\nAt this point, start bubbling semi-frozen sucrose-ACSF with carbogen on ice for use during slicing.\nWeigh the rat and note its weight.\nTerminally anesthetize the rat by injecting the prepared sodium pentobarbital into the intraperitoneal cavity. The dose of sodium pentobarbital should be 100 mg/kg, calculated from the previously taken weight and stock concentration of drug. Place the rat in a holding chamber and allow 0.5-5 minutes for the onset of terminal anesthesia.",
    "Confirm cessation of reflexes: test both corneal blink (touch the pupil) and hind-paw pinch (lift the leg and pinch the hind-paw) reflexes using a blunt probe (i.e., rounded forceps). Once reflexes have ceased, pin the rat to the polystyrene or cork surgical board using hypodermic needles.\nOpen the chest cavity and place the cannula at the base of the left ventricle of the heart. Puncture the right atrium and immediately start perfusion with the ice-cold (0-1 °C) sucrose-ACSF (using a peristaltic pump at 50 mL/minute).\nOnce full exchange of fluids and cooling of the body has occurred (<5 minutes), remove the cannula and pins, and then decapitate using a guillotine.\nCarefully and rapidly remove the skull using bone scissors and Rongeur bone tools (Figure 1A,1B).\n\t\nStart by making 2x bilateral cuts through the foramen magnum using the bone scissors and remove the skull to the lambda suture with the Rongeurs. Cut carefully along the midline suture with the bone scissors to just behind the eyes.\nMake 2x bilateral cuts through the skull, perpendicular to the midline. Using the Rongeurs, open the skull along the midline. Take extra care to remove pia mater using fine scissors or a hooked needle.\nScoop the brain out of the skull using a blunt spatula, severing the cranial and optic nerves with side to side compression. Place the brain into carbogenated, semi frozen (0– 1 °C) sucrose-ACSF for 1-2 minutes prior to slicing.\n2. Preparation of brain slices from dorsal hippocampus\nRemove the perfused brain from the semi-frozen (0–1 °C) sucrose-ACSF and place in a glass Petri dish lined with filter paper. Place the brain onto its ventral surface.",
    "Using a scalpel (No. 22 blade), remove the posterior portion of the brain at ~10° from vertical to create a flat surface to glue the brain to the stage (Figure 1C).\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue to the stage of the vibratome. Spread the glue to make a thin film approximately 50% larger than the cross-sectional area of the cut surface of the brain.\nLift the brain out of the glass dish onto a spatula, cut side down, using a paintbrush to guide the tissue. Blot the brain with a piece of tissue to remove excess ACSF and slide the brain, cut surface down, onto the center of the glue. Using a Pasteur pipette, add 1-2 mL of ice-cold sucrose-ACSF over the brain to remove glue away from brain block.\nPlace the brain into the slicing chamber and flood with semi-frozen sucrose ACSF. Use a spoon or spatula to keep excess ice away from brain block, and then carbogenate (Figure 1D).\nMove the blade of the vibratome into position: ~1 mm from the dorsal surface of the brain and vertically ~1 mm anterior to bregma. Ensure that the blade is fully submerged, and remove bubbles using a paintbrush.\nStart slicing the brain. To trim down to the dorsal hippocampus, use a speed of 0.1-0.2 mm/s, with a horizontal blade movement of 1-1.5 mm and a reciprocal oscillatory rate of ~90 Hz. When slicing the dorsal hippocampus, reduce the speed to 0.05-0.1 mm/s.",
    "Collect slices of dorsal hippocampus (nominally 3-4 full slices or 6-8 hemisected slices) per brain. If longitudinal slices of ventro-medial hippocampus are required, continue slicing. Once the dorsal hippocampus has been sliced, there is no need cut extra tissue beyond approximately the position of the 3rd ventricle. Stop the vibratome, separate the slice with a bent hypodermic needle, and collect in the base of the slicing chamber.\n\tNOTE: Slices can be 250-500 µm thick, depending on experimental requirements. For recordings from the dorsal hippocampus, typically use 400 µm thick slices to preserve as much of the local network, whilst allowing the suitable microscopy conditions.\nTrim the slices to contain only the hippocampus and overlying cortex under a dissecting microscope. Transfer slices to the pre-warmed 35 °C chamber with the anterior surface facing up.\nDetermine the storage chamber based on the experiment to be performed. To obtain high quality whole-cell patch-clamp or extracellular field recordings close to the slice surface in submerged recording chambers, store in submerged chambers. Alternatively, store in a liquid/gas interface chamber for recordings of oscillatory network activity or interface extracellular field recordings.\nFor submerged storage conditions, allow slices to recover at 35 ºC for 30 minutes from the time of the last slice entering the storage chamber. This allows for reactivation of metabolic processes and re-sealing of cut neurites. After 30 minutes, transfer the storage chamber to room temperature.\n3. Recording the dorsal hippocampal neurons\nFabricate recording patch pipettes from capillary glass. This protocol uses 1.5 mm outer diameter, 0.86 mm inner diameter borosilicate glass with filament, which yields a tip resistance of 3-5 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution (Table 1). Keep intracellular solutions chilled on ice to prevent degradation of energetic components and filtered prior to use (syringe filter, pore size: 0.2 μm).",
    "Carbogenate recording ACSF and pre-warm in a water bath (35-40 ºC). Deliver the carbogenated and pre-warmed ACSF to the recording chamber via perfusion tubing assisted by a peristaltic pump. Start perfusion several minutes prior to transferring a slice into the chamber.\nStop the perfusion and transfer a brain slice to the recording chamber with the anterior surface facing up. Hold the slice in place with a platinum ring with single fibers of silk attached to form a “harp” shape. Position the slices so that stratum pyramidale of CA1 runs perpendicular to the axis of the first recording pipette.\nRestart the flow of carbogenated and pre-warmed (35-40 ºC) recording ACSF (Table 1) at an optimal rate of 6-8 mL∙min-1.\n\tNOTE: High flow rates (6-8 mL∙min-1) are optimal for maintaining network activity in slices32. Lower flow rates (i.e., 2-3 mL∙min-1) can be used to maintain slice stability for imaging experiments or where biologically relevant network activity is not required.\nAssess slice quality using infrared differential inference contrast (IR-DIC) optics with 40x objective magnification (visualized with a CCD camera). Assume good slice quality if a large number of ovoid-shaped, moderately contrasted CA1 PCs can be seen in str. pyramidale at depths of 20-30 μm below a smooth and lightly dimpled surface (Figure 2A). Poor quality slices contain large numbers of highly contrasted, shrunken or swollen cells, with an uneven slice surface.\nFill patch pipettes with an intracellular solution (e.g., based on an intracellular [Cl-] of 24 mM) to allow comparison with other published data.",
    "Perform whole-cell patch-clamp recordings as previously described22. Exclude cells from analysis if the membrane potential (VM) on break-through is more depolarized than -50 mV, the series resistance is >30 MΩ; or the series resistance changes by >20% over the course of the recording. Under these recording conditions, series resistance is typically in the range of 8 – 25 MΩ and stable for up to 1 hour.\nTo examine CA1 intrinsic excitability from the dorsal hippocampus, test intrinsic physiological properties with whole-cell recordings with the following protocols in current-clamp configuration:\n\t\nFrom the resting membrane potential with no bias current applied, apply small (-10 pA, 500 ms) current steps repeated 30 times.\nFrom -70 mV with bias current applied, apply hyper to depolarizing current steps of 500 ms duration (-100 to +400 pA, 25 pA steps) with 3 repetitions of a family of traces.\nApply a sinusoidal wave of 100 pA peak-to-peak amplitude, with variable frequency from 0.1 to 20 Hz. Repeat 3 times.\nApply a 5x 2 nA, 2 ms stimuli to drive action potentials at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 Hz. 10 sweeps per frequency.\nFrom a -70 mV voltage-clamp, apply 5 minutes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) for recording.\nTo reseal cells for histological analysis following successful recording, produce outside-out patches by slowly retracting the patch pipette. When an increase in series resistance is observed from experimental levels to >1 GΩ as measured by a -5 mV test pulse, raise the holding potential to -40 mV and retract the pipette fully.\nPerform additional recordings in the same slice to satisfy the required statistical power of the experimental design.\nRemove brain slices containing recorded neurons from the recording chamber, place in 24-well plate, replace the ACSF with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) and leave overnight.",
    "The next day, replace the PFA with 0.1 M phosphate buffer and store until histological processing. Visualize cells with fluorescent-conjugated streptavidin as previously described22.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
