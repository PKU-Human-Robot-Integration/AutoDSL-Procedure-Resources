    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol was developed specifically for robust ChIP-seq of small cell population such as isolated hepatic macrophages. This framework can easily be extended for other liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) including sinusoidal endothelial cells, stellate cells, alternative lineages of immune cells or other low-abundance cell populations such as virus-infected cells and non-infected bystander cells or primary neurons.\nOptimized on-bead ChIP-seq\nTiming: 2 days\nHerein is described an improved ChIP-seq library generation protocol used successfully in our labs to generate high-quality libraries for diverse chromatin immunoprecipitation products (Carlin et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Heinz et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Nott et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Seidman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nOptional: Fix cells\nThe linked protocol, “Purification of Hepatic Non-Parenchymal Cells or Nuclei,” provides fixed material that can directly be used for ChIP as detailed from step 12 onward. If starting with unfixed cells from tissue culture, first perform steps 1–11 to fix protein-DNA interactions.\nHarvest cells:\nIf suspension cells: transfer cell suspension to 15 mL or 50 mL conical, depending on volume.\nIf adherent cells: harvest cells by trypsinizing and neutralize trypsin with 4 volumes of FBS-containing media, transfer cell suspension to 15 mL or 50 mL conical, depending on volume.\nPellet cells by centrifuging for 8 min at 300 × g at 20°C. Aspirate or decant supernatant.\nOptional: Dual crosslinking with DSG and formaldehyde:",
    "While cells are in the centrifuge, for each 1 million cells, freshly prepare a minimum of 1 mL of a 2 mM DSG solution in PBS. To do so, first warm up the glass vial of DSG to 20°C–25°C before opening (to avoid water condensation into the vial). On an analytical scale, pour at least 0.654 mg DSG for each 1 million cells onto a fresh weighing paper, transfer the DSG to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and dissolve in 3.92 μL anhydrous DMSO per 0.654 mg DSG (adjust the amount of DMSO to the amount of DSG in the tube). Place 1 mL PBS per 1 million cells in a microcentrifuge tube or conical (according to the PBS volume). Using a micropipette, swiftly “shoot” 3.92 μL of the DSG/DMSO solution into the PBS, immediately close the tube, and invert multiple times to rapidly disperse the DSG. If this is done too slowly, the DSG will form a white precipitate, and the DSG/PBS preparation procedure will need to be repeated.\nAspirate or decant supernatant, and wash cells once by resuspending in 10 mL PBS and centrifugation for 8 min at 300 × g at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in at least 1 mL DSG/PBS solution per 1 million cells.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 30 min while rotating the tube overhead at 8 rpm.\nPer 1 million cells, add 27.78 μL 37% formaldehyde to each 1 ml cell suspension in DSG/PBS, invert tube 5–6 times to mix, and incubate for an additional 10 min at 20°C–25°C while rotating the tube overhead at 8 rpm.\nSkip to step 5.",
    "While cells are in the centrifuge, for each 1 million cells, freshly prepare a minimum of 1 mL of a 1% formaldehyde solution in PBS: to each 1 mL PBS, add 27.78 μL 37% formaldehyde.\nResuspend the cell pellet in the 1% formaldehyde/PBS solution, and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min while rotating the tube overhead at 8 rpm.\nQuench the crosslinking reaction by adding 1/20th volume of 2.625 M glycine and 1/20th volume 10% BSA (50 μL each per each 1 mL crosslinking reaction), and mix by inverting 3–4 times.\nPellet cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 1,000–1,500 × g at 4°C.\nCritical: Fixed cells are more buoyant than unfixed cells and refractory to the higher centrifugal force needed to pellet them. The added BSA helps prevent the more hydrophobic fixed cells from sticking to the tube wall, which otherwise would lead to sample loss when aspirating the supernatant. If possible, perform the centrifugations in steps 6–11 in a swing bucket rotor to further minimize cell loss, especially when working with less than 1 million cells.\nAspirate and discard supernatant, then resuspend fixed cells in 1 mL ice-cold 0.5% BSA/PBS per 1 million cells.\nPellet cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 1,000–1,500 × g at 4°C.\nAspirate and discard supernatant, resuspend fixed cells in 1 mL ice-cold 0.5% BSA/PBS and transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (if not already in one).\nPellet cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 1,000–1,500 × g at 4°C.\nAspirate and discard supernatant, and place the cell pellet on ice.\nOptional: snap-freeze the cell pellet in dry ice/methanol bath or liquid nitrogen and store indefinitely at −80°C.\nPrepare necessary buffers for chromatin fragmentation\nTiming: 10 min",
    "Freshly prepare 1 mL complete Resuspension Buffer per sample by adding 10 μL protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC, 100×) and 10 μL PMSF (100×) to 980 μL Resuspension Buffer stock per sample (1× PIC, 1× PMSF final). Mix by vortexing and keep on ice.\nCritical: Add PMSF immediately prior to use!\nFor sonication using a Covaris sonicator, prepare 100 μL complete Lysis Buffer per sample by adding 1 μL PIC (100×) and 1 μL PMSF (100 mM) and 0.5 μL DTT (100 mM) to 97.5 μL Lysis Buffer stock per sample (1× PIC, 1× PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT final). Mix by vortexing and keep on ice.\nCritical: Add PMSF immediately prior to use!\nFragment fixed chromatin by sonication\nTiming: 1 h to 1 day, depending on number of samples and method of chromatin fragmentation\nNote: This step requires optimization depending on the user’s access to equipment. Here we describe fragmentation using a Covaris E220, which is available at many core facilities. Alternatively, a probe sonicator may be used effectively with proper experience (see sonicator[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.5] section for more details). Many additional platforms are available, and the goal is to sufficiently fragment chromatin to an appropriate size without overheating the sample.\nSuspend 0.1–5 million fixed cells or nuclei in 1 mL ice-cold Resuspension Buffer.\nPellet at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant, taking care to not lose material from the cell or nuclei pellet.\nSuspend the pellet in 80 μL ice-cold Lysis Buffer and transfer the lysate to Covaris sonication tubes on ice.\nNote: If using a probe sonicator, cells will need to be resuspended in a larger volume of Lysis Buffer (400 μL - 500 μL, see sonicator[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.5] section).",
    "Load the sonication tubes into the Covaris 96 place microtube holder chromatin by sonication using the Covaris E220.\nLoad and then run the desired user-optimized fragmentation protocol at 4°C.\nWe have found success for sonication of macrophage nuclei in Lysis Buffer using the following settings: 18 cycles at 60 s, duty factor at 5.0%, peak power of 140 W, cycles per burst 200.\nWe have found success for sonication of macrophage, microglia and neuron nuclei in alternative lysis and washing buffers described in Brigidi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Eichenfield et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], Gosselin et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], and Heinz et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]. Changes in sonication buffers require optimization of sonication conditions.\nWhile the sonication protocol is running, prepare the antibody-bead complexes.\nTransfer a total of 10–20 μL protein A and/or protein G Dynabeads per sample into a microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: The choice of protein A and/or protein G Dynabeads, and the volume to use, is dictated by the antibody used for ChIP. Protein A binds rabbit antibodies with highest affinity, while protein G has higher affinity for mouse, rat, goat, and sheep antibodies. We have found success in coupling 2 μg of a validated ChIP antibody with 20 μL of magnetic beads. If the ChIP method utilizes a cocktail of antibodies, we have found success using 1–2 μg of each antibody with a total volume of 20 μL of magnetic beads.\nNote: For many difficult or low complexity ChIP-seqs, we have found that optimization and utilization of antibody cocktails (mixture of multiple antibodies recognizing different epitopes for an individual ChIP target) have provided both optimal signal:noise and peak complexity. Sometimes this approach has proved to be the difference between many difficult ChIP-seqs working or not.

    "Wash the required bead volume twice with 1 mL of TE + 0.5% BSA + 0.1% Tween 20 by collection on an Dynamag-2 Magnet (or similar).\nSuspend the washed magnetic beads in 200 μL TE + 0.5% BSA + 0.1% Tween 20 and add the necessary antibodies. Incubate with rotation for about 30 min at 20°C–25°C, then rotate at 4°C until the sonications are complete.\nCollect the antibody-bound magnetic beads on the magnet and discard the supernatant. Add 100 μL Lysis Buffer per sample, mix well by pipetting 20 times.\nRecover sonicated chromatin on ice and transfer to a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tubes.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at more than 16,000 × g at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant into a 0.2-mL PCR tube strip.\nSet aside 1% of the sonication product (for 0.5 to 1 million cells, or 1 – 2 μL for larger cell numbers) for each sample to use as the “ChIP input.” Store at 4°C for up to 2 days.\nCritical: Do not forget to set aside sample prior to immunoprecipitation for the “ChIP input,” which is used to identify ChIP-seq signal enriched over background.\nNote: Different cell lines may have copy number variants, and sonication efficiency of hetero- and euchromatin does change slightly with different sonication conditions and lysis buffers. A minimum of one “ChIP input” sample per cell type and sonication condition is required to control for differences between cell types, and sonication efficiency with different fixation and lysis conditions. “ChIP input” samples generated from the same cells stimulated with various stimuli typically do not differ significantly from each other. Therefore, a single “ChIP input” sample is usually sufficient to serve as control for multiple ChIP experiments done in the same cell type and with the same fixation/lysis/sonication conditions.",
