    "Principle The copper-catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, also known as azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition, is a ‘Click Chemistry’ reaction (Wang et al., 2003). Click Chemistry is a set of simple chemical reactions driven by a high thermodynamic driving force, which proceed to completion at room temperature, usually without the formation of side products. The CuAAC reaction combines an alkyne-tagged molecule with an azide-tagged molecule in the presence of copper (I) to give rise to a 1-4 cycloaddition product via a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. CuAAC is a bio-orthogonal reaction, which implies no effect of other chemical reactions or metabolites within cells. 17-ODA acts as a mimic of endogenous palmitic acid, but it is ‘clickable’ unlike natural fatty acids (capable of undergoing a click reaction) due to the presence of a terminal alkyne moiety.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4002/bioprotoc-11-09-4002-g001.jpgFigure 1. CuAAC click reaction between the fluorescent reporter Oregon Green 488 Azide and 17-Octadecynoic Acid Alkyne (17-ODA). The reaction occurs between the azide and alkyne moieties to give a 1-4 cycloaddition reaction.DHHC-PATs cannot discriminate between alkyne fatty acids and natural endogenous fatty acids. Hence, they label the intracellular palmitoyl proteins when mimics such as 17-ODA are supplied exogenously in the growth medium (Hannoush and Arenas-Ramirez, 2009; Gao and Hannoush, 2014; Siddiqui et al., 2020).Parasite culture and metabolic labelingThe 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum is cultured as per the modified method of Trager and Jensen’s method (Trager and Jensen, 1976; Radfar et al., 2009). The culture is started with a synchronized early ring-stage frozen glycerol stock with at least a 10% parasitemia (Parasitemia refers to the number of infected/parasitized red blood cells per 100 red blood cells).",
    "The 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum is cultured on O+ human red blood cells (Packed red blood cells obtained from healthy blood donors) in complete RPMI medium (see Recipes), since the malarial parasites grow inside red blood cells. The culture is maintained below 5% parasitemia and 1-2% hematocrit (Hematocrit value is the percentage of red blood cells (v/v) in the culture medium) by splitting the culture and reducing parasitemia when required. The hematocrit is maintained at 1-2% by adding fresh red blood cells to the culture. The parasite is cultured under 5% carbon dioxide or a gas mixture composed of 96% nitrogen, 3% carbon dioxide, and 1% oxygen. The amount of culture required for this experiment is small, and a 150-mm cell culture dish has enough material to obtain parasites for metabolic labeling and Click Chemistry.The parasite culture is synchronized by sorbitol treatment, which brings about osmotic lysis of the trophozoite and schizont stages of the parasite but spares the early ring stages. The culture suspension is centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf 5180R centrifuge using a swing-bucket rotor. The pellet is treated with a 5% solution of sorbitol in water, usually in 5–10-fold excess of the culture pellet volume, and gently resuspended in sorbitol solution and allowed to incubate for 10-15 min at room temperature. This suspension is centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant is discarded until a clear solution is obtained.It is good practice to label distinct homogenous stages of intra-erythrocytic development of the parasite with a clickable fatty acid probe (17-ODA) using sorbitol-synchronized parasite cultures. Sorbitol treatment of a mixed culture eliminates the late trophozoite and schizont stages but spares the ring stages, ensuring a homogenous population of parasites (see Figure 2a-2c).",
    "Note: Sorbitol treatment is most effective when the culture contains a mixed population of rings, trophozoites, and schizonts. See Recipes to make the sorbitol solution. Giemsa staining of parasite smears allows judgment of the state of synchronization for the parasite culture before and after sorbitol treatment. For labeling, parasites are maintained at a parasitemia of 5% and a hematocrit value of 1%. Parasites at the ring, trophozoite, or schizont stage (42-44 h post-invasion or h.p.i) are incubated in a 6-well plate in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 17-ODA, a clickable surrogate of palmitic acid. The optimal 17-ODA concentration requires optimization. We found 100 µM to be the optimal concentration of 17-ODA that yielded the best labeling of intra-erythrocytic malarial parasites.Note: Usually, a concentration of 25-50 µM is sufficient for other cell types, but the asexual stages of malarial parasites develop inside red blood cells and may therefore require a higher concentration of 17-ODA in the culture medium for efficient labeling. The ring/trophozoite/schizont cultures are allowed to incubate at 37°C for 8-10 h in complete RMPI medium supplemented with 17-ODA, which allows metabolic labeling of cellular palmitoyl-proteins with 17-ODA. After incubation, the culture medium and parasitized red blood cells are aspirated from 6-well plate wells, transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge for 10 min (see Figure 2e).Note: It is advisable to reserve a well for parasite cells incubated in culture medium lacking 17-ODA. The smears prepared from this well can serve as a control for the specificity of the click reaction.",
    "Smear preparation and sample fixationThe infected and uninfected red blood cells are visible at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube as a loose pellet (at 1% hematocrit, the total pellet volume is 1 ml packed red blood cells containing 5% infected cells if the parasitemia is 5% in 100 ml culture; 20 µl in 2 ml). The supernatant is aspirated using a pipette and discarded, and the pellet is washed twice with DPBS (Dulbecco’s Modified PBS). The culture pellet is gently resuspended in RPMI (1:1 v/v; pellet: RPMI); 10-20 µl suspension is used to make smears (see Figure 2e).Note: Smears should also be made from uninfected red blood cells incubated in 17-ODA-supplemented medium to observe the background signal due to fluorescence. Preparing thin smears ensures an even distribution of cells. The slides are marked accordingly to indicate the sample, and allowed to air dry inside a laminar flow biosafety hood for 20-30 min. Over-drying of smears is not recommended and once dried, smears are fixed using chilled methanol in a Coplin jar for 10-15 min. The slides are removed after 15 min and air-dried again.The smears are placed into small Petri dishes and washed three times with 1× PBS while shaking gently. The smears are washed again with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for permeabilization. The permeabilized, fixed smears are now ready for Click Chemistry to be performed.In-situ Click Chemistry in malarial parasite cellsThe Click reaction with Oregon Green 488 Azide proceeds in the dark at room temperature. Metabolic labeling with 17-ODA labels the parasite proteins with 17-ODA due to DHHC-PAT activity (Siddiqui et al., 2020).",
    "The CuAAC click reaction causes chemo-selective ligation between chemically complementary azide and alkyne functions, since the fatty acid probe (17-ODA) is thio-esterified to palmitoyl proteins (Figure 2f, reaction is shown in the box) and alkyne function is available to undergo a click reaction. A click reaction combines the fluorescent reporter Oregon Green 488 Azide with the alkyne function of 17-ODA and renders 17-ODA-labeled palmitoyl proteins fluorescent (Figure 2f).The click reaction cocktail is prepared as follows. For 100 μl reaction cocktail, add the following components sequentially to 94 μl filtered PBS: 2 μl Oregon Green 488 Azide (Invitrogen, final concentration of 0.1 mM), 2 μl 0.1 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) solution, and 2 μl 0.1 mM CuSO4 solution. The click reaction cocktail should cover the entire surface of the smear.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4002/bioprotoc-11-09-4002-g002.jpgFigure 2. Layout of the protocol.

Confocal imaging of smears for each parasite stage is performed and raw data are acquired. (h). The raw data are processed and analyzed to quantitate the fluorescence in different asexual stages of the parasite.Notes: This image was created using BioRender. The sequence in which reagents for the click reaction are added is crucial and should be adhered to during the reaction.",
    "Always prepare fresh TCEP and CuSO4 for each experiment and use immediately. Each slide is placed in a small Petri dish for incubation, with two small pieces of tissue paper or cotton soaked in water placed alongside to retain moisture and prevent drying of the smears during the incubation period.Oregon Green 488 Azide is fluorescent and should be protected from light; therefore, the reaction is allowed to proceed for 40 min in the dark at room temperature.After incubation, each slide is washed with 10-15 ml filtered PBS in a Petri dish with gentle rotation. This is performed two or three times to remove any ingredients of the click reaction that are non-specifically bound to the smear/slide surface. In particular, non-specific binding of Oregon Green 488 Azide to the smear or slide surface may lead to a high background fluorescence and must be removed by gentle and repeated washing.The excess liquid on the slide surface should be aspirated using a pipette, and the remaining moisture should be wiped with KimwipesTM without touching or abrading the smear.Slide mounting and fixationWear powder-free gloves when touching the coverslips or slides from this stage onward. The slides are mounted with DAPI ProLongTM Gold Antifade Mountant; 20-30 µl is poured on the smear and a coverslip gently placed on top, which should be pressed gently on the smear to avoid the formation of air bubbles.Note: It is advisable to use tweezers to hold the coverslips. Coverslips should be immersed in 70% ethanol overnight to render them sterile and dirt-free. Coverslips tend to stick together; make sure only one coverslip is picked up. The excess mountant is gently wiped off the slide using KimwipesTM, and the edges of the coverslips are sealed to the slide surface using nail polish.",
    "The nail polish is allowed to dry and slides are then stored in the dark at 4°C until image acquisition.Note: It is recommended that the image acquisition be performed within a day or two to obtain the best results. Data acquisition and analysisAny confocal microscope can be used for capture and acquisition of fluorescence.The raw data are processed using the NIS image analysis software. Since the fluorescence due to Oregon Green 488 Azide corresponds to palmitoylated proteins, fluorescence is a direct measure of palmitoyl-transferase activity at a given stage.It is recommended to score a minimum of 10-20 parasite cells corresponding to each stage (rings, trophozoite, and schizont) for each experimental replicate. Data from three experimental replicates are required to obtain a mean fluorescence value with standard deviation and statistical significance.Fluorescence intensity for each cell is determined by drawing an ROI (Region of Interest) around each fluorescent cell using the NIS image analysis software toolbox and measuring the fluorescence intensity. Such an analysis is also possible using the open source software, ImageJ or Fiji.Note: It is essential to use the same ROI to measure the fluorescence intensity for each cell from a replicate. Fluorescence intensities for cells from a given stage are required to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity and standard deviation. However, it is important to note that each cell’s fluorescence intensity should be corrected by subtracting the average background fluorescence intensity.For this purpose, an average background fluorescence intensity is calculated by measuring the fluorescence intensities of uninfected red blood cells (labeled with 17-ODA).Corrected fluorescence intensity is determined by subtracting the average background from the fluorescence intensity of each cell.",
    "Note: The average background fluorescence intensity may vary among experiments and replicates; therefore, it is recommended to use the background fluorescence value for a given sample/slide to calculate the corrected fluorescence values for cells on the same slide/smear. We calculated the average fluorescence intensity across the various asexual stages of the parasite and found that palmitoylation increases as the parasite transitions from the ring to the schizont stage (see Figure 3). The highest fluorescence is observed for the schizont stages of Plasmodium falciparum, which suggests that PAT activity is highest during this stage (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4002/bioprotoc-11-09-4002-g003.jpgFigure 3.
