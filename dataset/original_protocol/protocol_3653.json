    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImplantation of tumor tissue in humanized mouse\nTiming: 40 min\nWe purchased humanized mice from Jackson Laboratory.\nNote: Following is the description of how humanized mice were generated at the Jackson laboratory. Immunocompromised mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc<scid> Il2rg<tm1Wjl>/SzJ, NSG mice) were engrafted human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Shultz et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). CD34+-purified HSCs from human fetal liver were purchased from Stem Express and intravenously injected into 3-week-old female NSG mice (105 cells per mouse) 4 h after total body irradiation (140 cGy) using RS-2000 irradiator (Rad Source). The engraftment levels of human CD45+ cells were determined 12 weeks post-HSC transplantation by flow cytometric quantification of peripheral blood. Humanized NSG mice that had over 25% of human CD45+ cells in the peripheral blood were considered as engrafted and humanized. Twelve weeks after engraftment, mice were delivered in two shipments and raised in the animal facility of DNA Link, Inc. Immune cell component of the humanized mice was confirmed from the Jackson Laboratory at arrival (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_578_2.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_578_3.csv\nNote: All items must be autoclaved or sterile to maintain an environment for immunocompromised mice and prevent any infection. Using sterile surgical and protective equipment is essential.\nRemove hair from the dorsal flank (implantation site) of the mouse with an electric clipper.\nPlace mice in the anesthesia chamber. Prepare a mixture of oxygen/isoflurane with approximately 2% isoflurane in a gas stream.\nPrepare 100 mL of serum-free and 1% penicillin/streptomycin RPMI-1640 media.\nNote: Depending upon your experimental size and number of sections, you can adjust (increase/decrease) the final volume of media. The media can be stored at 4°C for up to twelve months.\nThaw the cryopreserved tumor tissues in a heating bath at 37°C for approximately 2 min. Mix the thawed contents with 10 mL of serum-free RPMI-1640 medium.",
    "Place the tissue in a sterile cell culture dish (10 cm diameter) on ice. Add 5 mL of 1% penicillin/streptomycin RPMI-1640 medium to keep the tissue moist and prevent it from shrinking.\nMince the tissue into approximately 1 mm3 with a sterile blade such that the tissue pieces can be transferred to a 13-gauge trocar needle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/578-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Surgical procedure of tissue implantation and schematic plans of immunotherapy\n(A) Image of minced tissue (1 mm3).\n(B) Placement of the minced tissue into the trocar needle.\n(C) Injection of the minced tissue into the mouse.\n(D) Making a shape to keep the formation using a pair of forceps.\n(E) Shape of the implanted tissue.\n(F) Schematic immunotherapy plans of each group.\nAnesthetize the humanized mice by isoflurane in the anesthesia chamber.\nAfter anesthesia, pierce ears with ear-punch for identification.\nPlace the minced tumor pieces in the syringe of the 13-gauge trocar needle using a pair of small iris forceps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nSterilize the entire shaved area with 70% ethanol to the extent that the hair around it gets wet.\nInsert the trocar needle subcutaneously 1.5 to 2 cm into the mouse flank using a pair of large straight forceps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: The trocar needle should be inserted in one direction smoothly. If you move the needle during insertion, the hemisphere shape is likely to be scattered.\nPush the plunger of the trocar needle to engraft the tumor fragments and slowly pull out the needle. After this, hold the skin with a pair of large straight forceps so that the tumor pieces placed in “proper position” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). The proper position is the point of 1.5 cm ahead from the insertion of the needle. Make the tissue approximately 0.5 cm diameter to prevent it from scattering.",
    "Disinfect the skin of the tumor-implanted site with 70% ethanol transfer the mouse to a warm pad, and observe until the mouse wakes up from anesthesia (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nMeasure the size of tumor volume using caliper after 2 weeks of engraftment, and passage the tumor to another mouse when tumor volume reaches about 500 mm3. Repeat steps 1 to 13 for passaging a tumor.\nEngraft the PDX tumor to 14 mice by following steps 6 to 11, and make groups for antibody treatment in two weeks.\nAnti-IL-34 antibody and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in PDX model\nTiming: 4 weeks\nBegin antibody treatment when the passaged tumor volumes reach 70–120 mm3 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nIntraperitoneally inject 12.5 mg/kg (250 μg) of anti-human IL-34 antibody (E0320E7, BioLegend; as mentioned above) and combination of anti-IL-34 antibody and anti-PD-1 antibody to the respective groups three times a week for 4 weeks.\nFurther, intraperitoneally inject 10 mg/kg (approximately 200 μg) of the anti-PD-1 antibody as the first dose and inject 5 mg/kg every 5 days until the study endpoint.\nIn addition, intraperitoneally inject saline twice a week to the control group until the study endpoint. The volume is the same as the antibody solution.\nMeasure the tumor size with a caliper twice a week until the endpoint.\nCalculation: Tumor size (mm3) = (length × width2) /2\nCollect the tumors with resection at day 28 after transplantation.\nSample preparation for histopathological analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nAfter the endpoint, dissect tumor tissues and fix in 10% formalin solution for 12 to 24 h at 22°C–26°C for histological analysis. Fixation volume should be 5 to 10 times of the tissue volume.\nWash the sample with PBS once for 30 min.\nDehydrate the sample as follows:\nSoak in 70% ethanol two times at 22°C–26°C for an hour each.",
    "Soak in 90% ethanol one time at 22°C–26°C for an hour.\nSoak in 95% ethanol one time at 22°C–26°C for an hour.\nSoak in 99% ethanol one time at 22°C–26°C for an hour.\nSoak in 100% ethanol three times at 22°C–26°C for an hour each.\nSoak into xylene three times at 22°C–26°C for an hour.\nInfiltrate with 60°C paraffin four times for an hour.\nEmbed the tissues into paraffin blocks.\nTrim the paraffin blocks and cut at 4 μm using a microtome and blade. We skip the detailed description of the sectioning step in this protocol.\nPlace the paraffin ribbon in a water bath at approximately 40°C–45°C and mount the sections onto individual slides.\nAir dry the slides for 30 min and place them in an oven at 45°C–50°C for 8–12 h."
