  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of Akron.\n1. Using the Superior Rectus Muscle Landmark to Identify Retinal Orientation\nNOTE: The superior rectus muscle is a landmark for the dorsal retina (Table 1). If the experiment does not require the marking of the dorsal retina, skip step 1 and continue to step 2.\nFollow your approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol for mouse euthanasia.\nTo identify the general orientation of the globe, make a burn mark on the dorsal cornea directly between the nasal and temporal canthi near the cornea-sclera border immediately after euthanasia (Figure 1A). Make the burn mark by heating up a cautery pen for ten seconds and then touching the tip of the pen to the dorsal cornea for less than a second.\n\tNOTE: Holding the cautery pen to the cornea for too long will cause the globe to puncture.\n\tNOTE: While some cautery pens do emit light, the cautery pen listed in the Table of Materials does not emit any light when heated, making it a safe option for dark-adapted experiments.\nFor enucleation, use curved forceps to gently push the eye out of its socket and grip the globe from underneath. Do not cut the optic nerve to remove the globe; instead, slowly lift the globe from its socket while simultaneously moving it gently from left to right until the globe is released from the socket.\n\tNOTE: This motion will allow the rectus muscles to remain attached to the globe when the globe is finally removed completely from the socket. The optic nerve will also often remain attached to the globe.",
    "Transfer the globe with the attached rectus muscles in a Petri dish containing dissection medium. Make sure to keep track of which eye is the left eye and which is the right eye.\n\tNOTE: The dissector should use an appropriate dissection medium that aligns with their experimental protocol.\nUnder the dissection scope, visually locate the dorsal corneal burn and identify the superior rectus muscle with which it is associated (Figure 1A).\nUsing dissection scissors or a 20 G (0.9 mm x 25 mm) needle (see Table of Materials), puncture the cornea at the burn mark. Make a deep relieving cut into the globe toward the optic nerve to bisect the superior muscle. An isolated and reconstructed retina with this cut is shown in Figures 1B and 1C.\nBegin to isolate the retina by using two sets of forceps (see Table of Materials) to gently tear the hole made with the puncture in step 1.6 until part of the retina is exposed.\n\tNOTE: It is important that this be done gently, as tearing too forcefully can cause the relieving cut to tear further.\nUse forceps to tease apart the retina from the sclera until the sclera has been completely removed. Remove the iris, lens, vitreous, and any remaining structures with forceps until the retina is completely isolated.\n\tNOTE: The protocol may be paused here. If the tissue is going to be fixed for s-opsin immunohistochemistry, continue to step 3.5.\n2. Using the Choroid Fissure Landmark to Identify Retinal Orientation\nNOTE: The choroid fissure is present on the sclera on the back of the eye, and runs from the temporal pole to the nasal pole (Figures 2B and 2C; Table 1).\nFollow approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol for mouse euthanasia.",
    "To identify the general orientation of the globe, make a burn mark on the dorsal cornea directly between the nasal and temporal canthi near the cornea-sclera border immediately after euthanasia (Figure 2A). Make the burn mark by heating up a cautery pen for ten seconds and then touching the tip of the pen to the dorsal cornea for less than a second.\n\tNOTE: Holding the cautery pen to the cornea for too long will cause the globe to puncture.\nEnucleate the eye and transfer the globe in a Petri dish containing dissection medium. Make sure to keep track of which eye is the left eye and which is the right eye.\n\tNOTE: The dissector should use an appropriate dissection medium that aligns with their experimental protocol.\nVisually locate and identify the choroid fissure on the back of the eye (Figure 2B, 2C).\n\tNOTE: The choroid fissure is also visible inside the eyecup under infra-red light20.\nOrient the globe in the Petri dish so that the dorsal burn is located at the superior pole, as it would be if the eye were still in the mouse.\n\tNOTE: The presence of the dorsal burn allows for the identification of the nasal and temporal side of the globe, as long as whether it is a right or left eye has been documented: If it is a right eye, the nasal choroid fissure will be to the right of the burn and the temporal choroid fissure will be to the left of the burn. If it is a left eye, the temporal choroid fissure will be to the right of the burn and the nasal choroid fissure will be to the left of the burn.",
    "Using dissection scissors or a 20 G (0.9 x 25 mm) needle (see Table of Materials), make one puncture in the globe where the dorsal burn is located.\nMake a shallow relieving cut toward the optic nerve where the dorsal corneal burn is located. This cut will be perpendicular to the choroid fissure, allowing for identification of the dorsal retina after isolation (Figure 2D).\nMake the following two deep relieving cuts toward the optic nerve: one by lining the blades of the dissection scissors up with the temporal choroid fissure line on the back of the eye, and one by lining the blades of the dissection scissors up with the nasal choroid fissure line on the back of the eye. These cuts are shown on an isolated and reconstructed retina in Figure 2D and 2E.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, a deep cut can be made at the temporal choroid fissure and a shallow cut can be made at the nasal choroid fissure, making the dorsal corneal burn cut unnecessary. This allows for accurate orientation of the retina with fewer relieving cuts.\nBegin to isolate the retina by using two sets of forceps (see Table of Materials) to gently tear the hole made with the puncture in steps 2.7 and 2.8 until part of the retina is exposed.\n\tNOTE: It is important that this be done gently, as tearing too forcefully can cause the relieving cut(s) to tear further.\nUse forceps to tease apart the retina from the sclera until the sclera has been completely removed. Remove the iris, lens, vitreous, and any remaining structures with forceps until the retina is completely isolated.\n\tNOTE: The protocol may be paused here. If the tissue is going to be fixed for s-opsin immunohistochemistry, continue to step 3.5.",
    "3. Labeling the S-opsin Gradient in the Mouse Retina\nNOTE: The s-opsin photopigment expression is asymmetrically distributed to the ventral retina1, making it an excellent marker for the ventral half of the retina. This method is only useful for fixed and immunostained tissue (Table 1). The following steps can be applied to retinas that have been dissected using any of the aforementioned methods.\nFollow approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol for mouse euthanasia.\nImmediately after euthanasia, enucleate the eye and place the globe in a Petri dish with dissection medium. Make sure to keep track of which eye is the left eye and which is the right eye in order to identify retinal orientation after the retina is dissected.\n\tNOTE: The dissector should use an appropriate dissection medium that aligns with their experimental protocol.\nBegin to isolate the retina by using two sets of forceps (Table of Materials) to gently tear a hole in the cornea until part of the retina is exposed.\n\tNOTE: It is important that this be done gently, as tearing too forcefully can cause the retina to tear.\nUse forceps to tease apart the retina from the sclera until the sclera has been completely removed. Remove the iris, lens, vitreous, and any remaining structures with forceps until the retina is completely isolated.\n\tNOTE: The protocol may be paused here. If using the retina for an ex vivo experiment, conduct the experiment before performing the following steps.\nUsing dissection scissors, make four relieving cuts in the retina so that it will lie flat. Mount the retina ganglion cell-side up on nitrocellulose membrane (Table of Materials) by gently pressing each corner of the retina onto the membrane with forceps.",
    "NOTE: The location of the relieving cuts can be arbitrary when using the s-opsin gradient for retinal orientation.\nUsing forceps, transfer the mounted retina to the first well in a 24-well plate (Table of Materials) filled with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (Table of Materials) for fixation. Place the 24-well plate on an orbital shaker at room temperature (Table of Materials) and fix the retina for exactly 40 min.\n\tNOTE: All of the following wash and incubation steps should be completed with the 24-well plate on an orbital shaker.\nWash the retina for 15 min at room temperature by transferring it to the second well filled with 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS. Repeat this step twice by sequentially transferring the retina to the 0.1 M PBS-filled third and fourth wells.\nTransfer the mounted retina to the fifth well containing 1 mL of blocking solution (1.7% Triton X-100 and 5.2% donkey normal serum in 0.1 M PBS; see Table of Materials) and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nAdd the rabbit anti-s-opsin primary antibody (see Table of Materials) to the blocking solution at a concentration of 1:500 and incubate for three days at 4 °C.\nWash the excess primary antibody from the retina six times by sequentially placing it in six wells filled with 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS for 10 minutes each at room temperature.\nPlace the retina in a well with fresh blocking solution (1.7% Triton X-100 and 5.2% donkey normal serum in 0.1 M PBS) and add donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-594 secondary antibody (see Table of Materials). Incubate the retina with the secondary antibody overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Wash the excess secondary antibody from the retina six times by sequentially placing it in six wells filled with 1 mL of fresh 0.1 M PBS for 10 min each at room temperature.\nUsing forceps, transfer the mounted retina to a Petri dish containing 0.1 M PBS. Release the retina from the nitrocellulose membrane by gently inserting the tips of forceps between the retina and the membrane until the retina is no longer attached.\nMount the retina on a glass microscope slide by gently prodding it with forceps until the retina sticks to the glass and remove the slide from the Petri dish.\nCover the retina on the slide with Aquamount and cover it with a #1.5 coverslip. Place the slide in a slide tray (see Table of Materials) and allow it to sit at room temperature for an hour.\nReturn the slide to the refrigerator and store in a slide tray (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C when not in use. After the slide has been coverslipped for 24 hours, use nail polish to seal the sides of the slide to prevent desiccation.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Using Reconstructed Retinas Immunostained with S-opsin to Identify Retinal Orientation\nVisualize the s-opsin gradient with either a confocal microscope or an epifluorescent microscope with a camera attachment (see Table of Materials) and image the retina so that the entire retina is visible in one image (Figures 1B, 2D, 3A, and 3D). This can be done by imaging the retina in sections at low magnification and then stitching the images together.\nName the retinas so they are identifiable. For example, name the first retina to be reconstructed \"Retina1\".\nDownload and install ImageJ at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html.",
    "Create an individual folder for each retina that needs to be reconstructed, but leave the folders empty. For example, create a folder titled \"Retina1\". All files needed to reconstruct this retina will be placed in this folder in the subsequent steps.\n\tNOTE: The only files these folders should contain are the files that are to be analyzed by Retistruct. Any files other than the ones detailed below will make the retina unable to be opened by the Retistruct software.\nOpen the image of the retina in ImageJ by selecting File → Open and then choosing \"Retina1\".\nWithout making any changes to the image, save it as \"image.png\" to the folder titled \"Retina 1\" by selecting File → Save As → PNG.\n\tNOTE: The file must be named \"image.png\" in order for the Retistruct software to recognize the file as a retina for reconstruction.\nUse the Segmented Line Tool to outline the edges of the retina. By clicking on two adjacent spots on the border of the retina, the segmented line tool will essentially \"connect the dots\" between the two adjacent spots, creating an outline. Repeat until the entire retina has been outlined. Save the retina outline as \"outline.roi\" to the folder titled \"Retina1\" by selecting Analyze → Tools → ROI manager → Add[t] → More → Save.\n\tNOTE: The edge of the retina can be identified where the s-opsin staining transitions to the background.\nUse the Segmented Line Tool as instructed in step 4.7 to outline the border of the optic disc. Save the optic disc outline as \"od.roi\" to the folder titled \"Retina1\" by selecting Analyze → Tools → ROI manager → Add[t] → More → Save.",
    "NOTE: The optic disc is identified as the small hole in the middle of the retina, and will vary based on the quality of dissection.\n\tNOTE: All of the files needed for Retistruct reconstruction (\"image.png\", \"outline.roi\", and \"od.roi\") should now be saved the folder \"Retina1\".\nTo download, install, and open the Retistruct program, follow the instructions outlined in the Retistruct user guide found in the Supplementary Materials section of Sterratt, et al.24\nOnce the Retistruct window has appeared, click the \"Open\" icon at the top left of the window and select the directory folder \"Retina1\".\nAn image window will pop up indicating that no scale bar exists. Click \"Close\" and an image of the retina will appear in the box. Visualize the outline of the retina by clicking the \"Properties\" button in the top right of the window and change outline color to a visible color (Figure 5A).\nIMPORTANT: Specify whether the retina is from a right eye or left eye in the panel on the left (Figure 5A).\nClick the \"Add Tear\" button on the left and specify where a tear or cut is in the retina by clicking on the three vertices of the tear (Figure 5A). This will create lines that connect the three vertices of the cut. Repeat for all cuts in the retina.\nSpecify the dorsal retina by clicking on an arbitrary point of the retinal outline. An uppercase letter \"D\" will appear at that point on the outline (Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: The dorsal retina will be the darker half of the retina, opposite the s-opsin gradient. However, marking the dorsal retina in Retistruct is not a reliable method for identifying the dorsal half of the retina, so the marking of \"dorsal\" can be arbitrary in this step.",
    "Reconstruct the retina by clicking the \"Reconstruct Retina\" button at the top left of the screen (Figure 5B). A polar plot of the reconstructed retina will appear with the cuts visible in the same color as the outline (Figure 5C).\nClick the \"Save\" button on the right of the screen so that the reconstructed retina and all of the data associated with it is saved in the \"Retina1\" folder directory (Figure 5D).\nSave the reconstructed retina by clicking the \"PDF\" button in the right-hand panel (Figure 5D). A box will appear asking for size specifications. The default size is acceptable for the following steps. This action will save the reconstructed retina as \"image.polar.pdf\" in the \"Retina1\" folder directory.\nOpen \"image.polar.pdf\" in a Paint program (or other image manipulation program) and use the \"Paint Bucket\" tool (or similar) to change the background of the reconstructed retina to black. Save the reconstructed retina as a .tif file, such as \"Retina1_reconstructed.tif\" in the \"Retina1\" folder directory.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nDownload the MATLAB code for rotating the retina called \"Retina_Rotator.m\" (see Supplementary Materials). Place the code file in its own folder with no other files in the folder.\nOpen MATLAB, version 2007b or later. Double click on the code file to open it in MATLAB. In the command window, type \"Retina_Rotator\" and then hit the enter key. A search window will appear.\n\tNOTE: The code is specific for .tif files. If the file to be rotated is not in the correct format, the code will not rotate the retina correctly. See steps 4.17 and 4.18. for saving the reconstructed retina in the proper format.",
    "Open the file to be rotated. For example, choose \"Retina1_reconstructed.tif\". The code will then analyze the reconstructed retina and will automatically save the rotated retina as \"Retina1_reconstructed_rotated.tif\" in the folder where the original file is located.\nAfter the code has finished analyzing the retina, a window will also appear showing the images of the retina before and after rotation for comparison (Figures 3B and 3C; Figures 3E and 3F).\n\tNOTE: This code rotates the reconstructed retina so that the ventral (brightest) half is on the bottom and the dorsal (dimmest) half is on the top, thus accurately orienting the retina according to the s-opsin gradient1. If whether the retina is from a right eye or left eye has been documented, the location of the nasal and temporal poles can also be extrapolated from this method of orientation (Figure 3)."
