    "All experiments follow the University of Illinois, Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. This is a terminal procedure. \n1. Reagent Preparation\nPrepare artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) to contain 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM Glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 2 mM CaCl2·2H2O in ddH2O. Sterile filter and freeze in individual-use aliquots. Warm aCSF in a water bath to 39 °C before use.\nWarm low melting-point agarose (2%) in aCSF until fully dissolved in a water bath set to 65 °C. During the laminectomy, cool the melted agarose aliquot to 39 °C in a water bath, so that it can ready at close to physiologic temperature for step 5.2.\n\tNote: The agarose solution can be stored at -20 °C in single-use aliquots.\nPrepare sterile 50 mg/mL carprofen in bacteriostatic water. Store at 4 °C.\nClean cover-glasses with 70% ethanol, three washes of ddH2O, and store dry in a dust-free container.\n2. Backplate 3D Printing\nUse 3D CAD software is used to create a model to the dimensions shown in Figure 1. The interior is an ellipse widest at the bottom surface with respect to the printer and cut with a lofted cut to a smaller ellipse forming a lumen at the opposite surface. Two projecting arms with holes to accept screws extend laterally, for attachment to the backplate holding fork. From this 3D structure, create a triangulated 3D mesh file (.STL file).\n\tNote: See Figure 1B‒D and Supplementary Files 1 and 2.\nUpload the triangulated 3D mesh file to a 3D printer.\nPrint backplates using a 0.4 mm hot-end nozzle and a 0.2 mm layer height. Select nozzle temperature of 205 °C, bed temperature of 45 °C, and printing speed of 45 mm/s.",
    "Assess the resultant 3D printed backplates visually for structural integrity (Figure 1E); gross structural failure (absent lumen, collapsed wall) indicates printing defects (Figure 1F).\n3. Surgical Preparation\nPreheat the heating pad.\nLoad isoflurane into the delivery syringe while working in a chemical fume hood. Attach the delivery syringe to the isoflurane unit.\nSelect an 8‒12-week-old mouse. Weigh the animal. Induce anesthesia using 2% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Inject carprofen at 5 mg/kg subcutaneously.\nPosition the nose-cone and deliver isoflurane at 2% with a flow rate of 150 mL/min for maintenance of a surgical plane of anesthesia (Figure 2A‒E). Wrap the heating pad with a disposable absorbent pad for ease of cleanup.\nPosition an animal on the heating pad at the surgical station and install the nose cone. Lubricate the thermometer with petroleum jelly and insert it 5 mm into the rectum. Tape the thermometer probe to the tail for stability. Apply ophthalmic ointment to eyes of the mouse.\nTo maintain hydration, apply 200 µL of lactated Ringer’s solution by subcutaneous injection every 30 min until termination of the experiment.\nSpray the dorsum with 70% ethanol, remove fur with clippers, and clean the site with povidone-iodine.\n4. Laminectomy\nPosition the animal between the ear bars; these maintain the head position of the mouse with respect to the nose-cone.\nConfirm that animal is deeply anesthetized as assessed by lack of interdigital pinch reflex and steady respiratory pattern.\nMake a 1.5 cm rostral-caudal incision at midline over the lower thoracic/upper lumbar region using #11 blade (Figure 2). Separate the skin by grasping it with blunt toothed forceps and/or gloved fingers. Use forceps to separate and peel back any remaining transparent connective tissue underneath the skin. The superficial musculature should now be exposed; displace this with a foam surgical spear.",
    "Use foam surgical spears (or a curette) to clear away the remaining, deeper musculature of the target vertebra (thoracic 12). To create a seat for the backplate, also clear away muscle from the posterior aspect of thoracic 11, and the anterior aspect of thoracic 13. Control any bleeding by applying gentle pressure with a surgical spear or use a minimal pulse with a cautery gun. Continue to remove the remaining muscle away from the tendons using forceps\nOnce muscles are removed, carefully detach the tendons by cutting with forceps. There should be plenty of space for visualizing and manipulating the cord when this step is complete. Check that the dura matter of the inter-vertebral space, the semi-transparent laminar bone, the central superficial blood vessel underneath the bone, and anterior radiating artery are now clearly visible.\nWet the region with warm aCSF. Use the microdrill to repetitively thin the laminar bone using straight strokes parallel to the long axis of the spinal cord (Figure 2, Figure 3). If desired, utilize a gliding stage to rotate the surgical platform for enhanced ergonomic comfort (for example, a right-handed operator may rotate the surgical platform counterclockwise for the drilling step).\n\tNote: The gliding stage used is constructed of an upper aluminum plate that slides ±15 mm with respect to the fixed base plate.\nGently grasp the superficial spinous process with forceps and lift the vertebra; the bone should lift away easily. If there is resistance, repeat bone thinning with the drill and if necessary use iris scissors, being careful to aim the scissor tips upward to avoid damaging the tissue.\n\tNote: In order to maintain the dura intact, it is essential not to tug on the bone.",
    "Use #4 forceps to clear away any bone shards. Use a surgical spear to apply gentle steady pressure to control any bleeding. Rinse tissue with warm aCSF. Do not allow the tissue to dry out.\n5. Cover-glass Implantation\nGently apply a 3 mm borosilicate cover-glass to the exposed cord.\nEnsure agarose is cooled to 39 °C. Using a small spatula, apply warm 2% agarose/aCSF to the edge of the cover-glass and allow capillary action to draw it under the surface.\n\tNote: At temperatures below 39 °C, the agarose may start to gel. If this occurs, rewarm using a water bath or microwave. Some operators prefer to first apply one drop of agarose and lay the cover-glass on top.\nApply tissue adhesive to the exposed bony articular processes of the intact adjacent vertebra at thoracic level 11 vertebral spine and thoracic level 13 vertebral spine. Apply additional tissue adhesive in a ring around the laminectomy site, over the adjacent tendon and transverse process.\n\tNote: Tissue adhesive is required for proper adherence of the dental cement in the subsequent steps. The articular processes form a natural seat on which the backplate can rest stably (Figure 3). Adhesion to the articular processes will form the strongest points of attachment.\nMix dental cement with accelerant in a porcelain mixing tray. Utilize a small spatula to transfer dental cement onto the tissue adhesive layer. Use dental cement to adhere the backplate to the surgical field, centered over the window. Allow 10 minutes for the dental cement to cure.\n\tNote: The firm adhesion of the backplate to the anterior and posterior articular processes provides the fundamental structural stability of the implant.\nUse additional dental cement to fill in the interior base of the backplate, and the underside of the backplate : tissue interface.",
    "Note: The extra application of dental cement improves adherence and reduces risk of leakage of microscope objective immersion fluid (saline) out the bottom of the backplate.\nAdvance the forked backplate holder to the appropriate position over the window. Secure the backplate into the backplate holder with screws.\n\tNote: This protocol utilized a custom-machined backplate holder (Figure 2G‒H).\nApply saline to the backplate to test for leakage. If any fluid leaks, dry the area and apply more dental cement.\n6. Imaging Preparation\nTransfer the animal on the surgical platform to the optical table.\n\tNote: Our surgical platform, backplate holder, and isoflurane nose-cone holder can be transported between surgical and two-photon imaging stations as one unit, while applying continuous isoflurane anesthesia (Figure 2D,H). Similar units can be assembled from holding forks, beams, and supportive pillar posts obtainable from commercial sources (e.g. ThorLabs). For intravital microscopy, there should be at least 11 inches of clearance between the microscope objective and the optical table to accommodate the height of the surgical platform.\nAffix the surgical platform to the optical table using a stainless-steel mounting post and counterbored clamping fork.\nApply fresh saline into the well of the backplate. Lower a water-immersion lens into the well.\nUse transmitted or epifluorescence light to identify the area of interest and focus. Switch to laser scanning mode and perform in vivo imaging according to the appropriate two-photon laser excitation wavelength, dichroics and bandpass filters for the fluorophores present in the tissue6.\nSubscription Required.
