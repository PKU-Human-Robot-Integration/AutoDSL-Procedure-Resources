    "1. Dissection of Brains from Adult Medaka\nAnesthetize adult male or female (Figure 1A) by immersing in 5 ml MS-222 (150 mg/L, pH 7.4); wait a couple of minutes after gills movements have ceased before decapitating. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of California-Los Angeles.\nDecapitate the fish in fish saline at the caudal end of the operculum with scissors in a 60-mm diameter Petri dish.\nTransfer fish head to a 35-mm diameter Petri dish, half filled with fish saline and lined with Sylgard that has a depression in it to position and secure the head for brain dissection. Position and secure the head dorsal-side up with insect pins.\nCarefully cut the dorsal part of the skull around its perimeter with fine scissors and gently remove it with forceps, exposing the dorsal part of brain completely including the anterior part of the spinal cord.\nLift the spinal cord gently with fine-tip forceps and sever the bilateral connective nerves with fine-tipped scissors: cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and optic nerves on the ventral side of the brain, and the olfactory nerves at the anterior part of the brain.\nPlace the fully dissected brain in a fresh Petri dish filled with fish saline, and check carefully under the microscope to ensure the whole brain is intact (including the pituitary gland) without any cuts or punctures. Damaged brains are not used for experimentation.\n2. Mounting the Brain in a Recording Chamber\nPlace a small drop of cyanoacrylate or some other fast-acting glue with a needle into the center of the recording chamber and spread the glue about 1 cm2.\nQuickly transfer the brain and glue it down in a ventral-side up position.",
    "Add 1 ml of fish saline so that it fills the recording chamber and covers the brain. Continuously perfuse the brain with aerated fish saline at a rate of at least 200 μl/min.\nUsing the fine-tip forceps carefully remove the meninges over the surface of the recording area of the brain.\n3. Electrophysiology\nLoose patch recording of action potential firing\n\t\nGlass microelectrodes (6-10 MΩ) are constructed from borosilicate glass pipettes (1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments) using an electrode puller (e.g. Sutter P-87), and back filled with the loose-patch recording solution half-way up the electrode.\nUsing an upright fluorescent microscope with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, find the GFP-expressing TN-GnRH3 neurons through 10x (Figure 1B), then 40x water immersion objectives (Figure 1C). They are located at or near the ventral surface of the olfactory bulbs, just anterior to the telencephalon.\nSwitch to a video monitor that is providing real-time images from the microscope to locate the TN-GnRH3 neuron cluster (Figure 1C).\nPosition the microelectrode into the bath so that the tip of the electrode is above the neuron target. Apply constant slight positive pressure to the microelectrode so that it doesn't become clogged, and gently approach the target neuron with the tip of the electrode.\nCheck and monitor the electrode resistance in voltage-clamp mode using AxoGraph software and amplifier Axoclamp 200B with Axograph software (Axon Instruments). When you can see from the video monitor that the tip of the electrode is on the surface of the neuron and from the AxoGraph display that the resistance changes slightly, release the positive pressure and apply slight negative pressure if necessary to make a low resistance seal on the neuron (<100 MΩ).",
    "Switch to current-clamp mode, and record the membrane voltage continuously without any current input, adjusting the scale of voltage and rate of recording if necessary. Data is collected and analyzed by Powerlab software (ADInstruments Inc.).\nRecord baseline electrical activity in normal fish saline for about 5 min before any treatment (Figure 2A). Bath perfusion of drugs, hormones, peptides, etc. added to fish saline continues at the rate of 200 μl/min, followed by a washout period in normal fish saline 5, 6, 11.\nWhole cell recording of membrane potential\n\tThe whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology procedure is the same as that of the extracellular loose-patch recording procedure described above, from steps 3.1.1 - 3.1.4. Then the procedures deviate accordingly:\n\t\nCheck and monitor the electrode resistance in voltage-clamp mode. When you can see from the video monitor that the tip of the electrode is on the surface of the neuron and from the oscilloscope that the resistance changes slightly, release the positive pressure and apply a little negative pressure to make a high resistance seal on the neuron (~ 3 Giga Ω). Apply gentle suction by mouth to rupture the patched membrane; you will see a sudden drop of the resistance to about 120-250 MΩ.\nSwitch to current-clamp mode, and record the membrane voltage continuously without any current input, adjusting the scale of voltage and rate of recording if necessary.\nRecord baseline electrical activity in normal fish saline for about 5 min before any treatment, as described above in 3.1.7 (Figure 2B).\nSubscription Required.
