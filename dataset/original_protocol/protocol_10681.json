    "1. Preparation\nDesign and fabricate an assembly to accommodate a tri-leaflet valve geometry. This will at minimum include a valve holder to suture-in the valve leaflets and a tube to house the valve holder and surrounding accessories to secure the assembly onto the pulse duplicator system. In our case, we utilized a commercially available pulse duplicator system available from ViVitro Labs Inc. (Victoria, BC). Valve holder design as well as pre and post assembly configurations are depicted in Figure 1.\nThe entire loop will need to be primed prior to usage. This involves two steps: i) cleansing of the entire loop system using soap solution and water, including replacement of any degraded tubes prior to use and ii) calibration of instruments connected to the loop, namely the pump being used, the flow probe, and the pressure transducers (generally measured at atrial, aortic and ventricular locations). Calibration can initially be performed using 1% saline solution and should be repeated prior to using blood-analog glycerin solution.\n2. Native Aortic Valve Dissection\nObtain 4 fresh pig hearts with the aorta intact from a USDA approved slaughter house (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval may be required). In our case, our dissection protocol was approved by the IACUC at Florida International University (Protocol Approval Number: 11-020). Rinse the heart with deionized water and place it in a receptacle filled with the 1% antimycotic/antibiotic and sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and transport on ice to the hydrodynamic testing laboratory.\nPlace hearts in a dissecting pan and carefully remove the pericardium. Position the heart such that ventral side is facing you. Visually inspect and identify the four chambers of the heart and locate the aortic arch on the intact aorta.",
    "Separate the heart into two halves by cutting across horizontally at approximately 0.75 in below the annulus, i.e. the junction between the aorta and the left ventricle. Carefully isolate the intact aorta still attached to the left ventricular tissue segment.\nExamine the aortic valve located in the aortic root, the region between the ascending aorta and the lower annulus, ensuring that there is no damage or any signs of calcification.\nSplit the aorta at ~1 in above the annulus and separate the left ventricular tissue segment below the annulus to isolate the aortic valve (Figure 2a).\n3. Polymer and Native Valve Suturing Process\nPlace the heart valve inside the valve holder such that the base of each valve aligns with the base of the post holder. Secure the valve in place at each post temporarily with a paper clip, but be careful not to damage the commissures or the cusps.\nInsert the suture in the needle. Begin suturing at the bottom of the valve holder by passing the needle through the first hole, from the outside to the inside such that the needle may be easily pulled from the bottom. In a looping fashion, start suturing the valve vertically up the posts of the valve holder.\nProgress with suturing (Figure 2b) along the circumference of the holder and secure with additional suture around the tips of the holder posts. Paper clips (Figure 2c) can be removed when the valve is completely secured using sutures to the 3 posts and at the circumference of the valve holder (Figures 2d and 2e).\n4. Hydrodynamic Evaluation \nNote: Actual protocol will vary depending on specific pulse duplicator system being used. All information caontained herein used the ViVitro Pulse Duplicator Sysytem (ViVitro Labs, Inc., Vancouver, BC).\nBi-leaflet valve",
    "Set heart rate of pulse duplicator system to 70 beats/min.\nSelect a flow waveform to drive the pump (in the case of the ViVitro system the S35 waveform was chosen for all hydrodynamic tests). The specific waveform utilized in our experiments is illustrated by Lim et al. (2001)17.\nTurn on amplifier and piston pump. Warm up for 15 min.\nPlace bi-leaflet valve (Figure 2f) in the aortic position.\nSmear vacuum grease on all junctions of the device where leaks could occur.\nPour glycerin/saline liquid in the atrial compartment. Note that the pulsatile duplicator system runs on 2 L of liquid with: 35%/0.7 L glycerin and 65%/1.3 L of saline solution. The saline solution is prepared using common salt well-dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 9 mg/ml (weight/volume).\nTurn on the flow transducer that has been placed in the aortic position.\nCalibrate the pump.\nProceed with the flow transducer calibration followed by the pressure transducers. Similarly to the pump, simply follow the instructions given by the ViVitest software (ViVitro Labs Inc.) for each flow and pressure under the calibrate tab.\nOnce calibration is complete, start the pump at a low rpm until the fluid fills the aortic compartment. Check for leaks. Use additional vacuum grease if necessary.\nTurn the two stop-cocks (aortic and ventricular transducers) to open position.\nIncrease the rpm of the pump until the stroke volume reaches 80 ml/beat.\nPermit the system to run for 10 min until flow has stabilized. Flow stabilization can be verified by observing the flow and pressure waveforms displayed in the screen. Low to none variation between cycles is a good indicator of system stabilization.\nIn the ViVitest software select acquire mode.\nClick on collect 10 cycles.",
    "From the analyze mode, click on table and save the file. Also save an image of the waveforms using the photo-snap option in ViVitest.\nNative and Polymer valves\n\t\nFor polymer and animal valves, follow the same steps 3.1.1 - 3.1.3 from the bi-leaflet valve instructions.\nPlace the valve holder with the sutured valve inside the glass tube from the custom made assembly. Sandwich the tube with the top and bottom pieces and secure in-place with lateral screws and nuts.\nPlace assembly between the aortic chamber and the original aortic valve holder.\nContinue with steps 3.1.5 - 3.1.16 from the bi-leaflet valve instructions.\n5. Post Processing\nFlow and Pressure Waveforms\n\t\nAverage the data collected for each of the waveforms collected, i.e. aortic pressure (AP), ventricular pressure (VP), and flow rate (Q).\nFor each group of valve (polymer, porcine native aortic valve and bi-leaflet), plot the corresponding AP, VP and Q versus time relationships on the same plot.\nFor the AP, superimpose normal, native aortic valve18, and bi-leaflet prosthetic valve19 plots from the literature for validation purposes.\nHydrodynamic metrics\n\t\nFor each valve tested, the following hydrodynamic metrics should be computed: a) Forward flow pressure drop and maximum transvalvular pressure (TVP), b) the aortic root mean square (RMS) forward flow rate, c) aortic forward flow, closing, leakage and total regurgitant volume, d) valve end orifice area (EOA), e) transaortic forward flow, closing, leakage and total energy losses.\n\t\t\nForward flow pressure drop is computed from TVP readings and can be categorized into 3 time intervals, P: interval that starts and ends with 0 TVP, F: interval with forward flow and H: interval starting with 0 TVP and ending with 0 flow. Maximum TVP is the maximum pressure gradient recorded across the valve from the aortic and ventricular pressure readings.",
    "The RMS forward flow rate (Qrms) provides a useful metric for quantifying the magnitude of forward flow rate as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50335/50335eq1.jpg\n\t\t\tWhere 'n' is the total number of time points collected, 'Qi' is the instantaneous flow rate measurement collected in order 'i'.\nThe aortic forward, closing and leakage volumes are computed based on the following time intervals, Forward: beginning of forward flow through the valve (to), to the end of forward flow (t1); Closing: from t1 till the instance of valve closure (t2); Leakage: from t2 till the end of the cardiac cycle (t3). Total regurgitant volume is simply the sum of closing and leakage volumes.\nThe EOA based on blood properties can be computed for the 3 intervals, P, F and H from the mean TVP during each of these periods as20:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50335/50335eq2.jpg\nEnergy losses are defined as follows21:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50335/50335eq3.jpg\nSubscription Required.
