    "This procedure is in accordance with Yale IACUC requirements. Scientists should make sure that IACUC guidelines are approved and followed according to their institutional requirements.\n1. Section 1. Preparation of DNA, Solutions, and Glass Pipettes\nGenerate high purity (OD 260/280 > 1.80) high concentration (μg/μl > 2.5) endotoxin-free DNA.\nPrepare 0.9% saline solution and sterile filter through a 22 μm filter.\nPlace 10 cm fire polished borosilicate glass capillary tubes (O.D.: 1.5 mm, I.D.:1.10 mm) into a Model PP-830 Narishige PC-10 glass pipette puller with a kanthal wire. Set puller to a one step weighted pull at 70.5 °C. Break tips with circular forceps and inspect under a dissecting microscope for jagged edges. Bevel tips and place under a UV lamp for 15 min. Pulled pipettes should be marked at 2 mm from the edge of the tip.\nPrepare 0.1% weight/volume fast green solution by mixing sterile filtered 0.9% saline solution with dry fast green.\n2. Section 2. Animal Preparation, Glass Pipette Loading and Plasmid Injection\nRemove postnatal day 0-1 pups individually from cages, place onto a glass Petri dish pre-chilled to 4 °C, and then place on wet ice.\nAfter approximately 5 min, determine the state of anesthetization by utilizing the foot pinch response. If no movement occurs, subject pups to intraventricular injection.\nIt is important to note that the combination of fast green, DNA, and saline solution can result in rapid evaporation, crystallization, and blockade of glass pipettes. Therefore, generate a stock solution and aliquot 1-2 μl onto parafilm immediately prior to injections.\nAspirate the entire aliquoted volume with the pulled glass pipette.\nHold the head of the pup between your thumb and index finger of your less dominant hand.",
    "Turn on lamp and hold head of pup just outside of light beam. If needed, put saline on head to reduce the amount of light reflected by pup. The ventricles should now be illuminated.\nWith your dominant hand, insert the needle into lateral ventricle closest to you (Figure 1A and 1B). The site of injection should be approximately equidistant from the lambdoid suture and eye and 2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture. Insert pulled pipette to the 2 mm mark for a P0 pup, which should ensure penetration into the lateral ventricle. Coincidentally, you may see back filling of CSF into the pipette from the release of intracranial pressure. To reduce intracranial pressure, which assists in injection of plasmid, loosen your grip on the head of the pup.Step 2.8. Inject approximately 0.5 μl of plasmid into lateral ventricle using an air-pressured injector (Picospritzer, Parker).\n3. Section 3. Electroporation and Recovery\nSet the voltage of the electroporation generator for 5 square pulses, 50 msec/pulse at 100 volts, with 950 msec intervals. The spatial specificity of plasmid electroporation is dictated by the directionality of charge transfer. Close attention should be given to the placement given the heterogeneity of stem cell populations along the SVZ8. Differences in the rates of proliferation and cell fate have been identified for ventral-dorsal and rostral-caudal locations9,10 .\nOnce the plasmid is injected, dip tweezer electrodes into PBS. This step is to maximize charge transfer and to prevent burns caused by resistivity.\nPlace the positive electrode on the dorsal lateral wall of the pup near the ear ipsilateral to the site of plasmid injection (Figure 1C and 1D). Place the negative electrode on the contralateral hemisphere ventral lateral to the pup's snout.",
    "Initiate current transfer by pressing the pulse footswitch pedal and sweep the electrodes from dorsal to lateral using ~25 ° angle intervals.\nPlace electroporated pups onto a heating pad for 5 min. Gently rotate pups every 30 sec with mild stimulation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
