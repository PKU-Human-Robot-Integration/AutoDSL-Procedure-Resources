    "1.\tPreparation\nPrepare Xylazine-ketamine solution (Ketamine is a controlled substance. Detailed records should be kept and solutions stored in a safe, locked location).\nClean and sterilize equipment.\nPrepare surgery area by wiping with aseptic agent and then covering with sterile paper toweling, and set up the micromanipulator.\n2.\tPreparation of Cells for Transplant\nCells should be resuspended to a concentration of 100,000 cells/É l and, although only 250,000 cells are transplanted per mouse, an\nexcess of cells is required for syringe loading purposes (prepare at\nleast 300,000 cells per mouse receiving cells).\nWash cells to be transplanted 3 times in HBSS in a 50 ml conical vial.  Count the cells before the final spin.\nAfter the final spin down, decant HBSS and leave vial in upside down position to prevent droplets from reaching the pellet.\nDry inside walls with a UV-irradiated, sterile Kimwipe.  Do not allow the pellet to dry.\nHolding the tube upright, slowly and very delicately resuspend the cells in half the final desired volume of HBSS.\nMeasure the total volume by pipetting the majority of the suspension into a pipette tip and then adjusting the dial on the pipetter until the entire suspension is in the pipette tip. This will tell you how much more HBSS is needed for the desired concentration.\nBring volume to the desired amount by adding HBSS.\nPlace back on ice.  Check viability of cells if they must be on ice for longer than 2 hrs.\n3.\tPreparation of mice for surgery and transplantation\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg) in ~100 μl doses or an equivalent anesthetic. The entire procedure from surgical prep to suturing will take 30-40 minutes.\n(Optional: apply numbered, colored tape to the tail of each mouse to ensure identification)",
    "Shave the dorsal area of the mouse from the lower back to the neck, and extending 2 cm bilateral from the midline, with electric clippers. The hair should be cut as close as possible (it may be necessary to go over the area several times).\nTo remove the remaining hair, apply a thin layer of hair removal cream (Nair) with a gauze tipped applicator.\nAfter 1-2 minutes, wipe Nair off with gauze wetted lightly with soapy water. The prepared area should be clean bare skin without any stray pieces of hair that could get into the wound during the subsequent surgical procedure.\nSterilize the prepared area with iodide solution.\n4.\tLaminectomy\nFrequently change and/or sterilize gloves throughout the procedure.  Position the mouse dorsal side up with head pointing to the left (if you are right handed). Drape animal to ensure sterility and that only the shaved area is exposed. Make a vertical incision (˜1.3cm) over the laminecomy site spanning from about thoracic vertebrae T8 to T12.\nWith the graefe forceps held in the left hand, firmly secure the spinal column at T9 (Figure 1A) and lift the mouse up to exaggerate the spinal curvature.\nUse the scalpel to score the junction between T10 and T11, the space between the two spiny protrusions. Further expose the junction by carefully scrapping the muscle layer away to expose the bone (see Figure 1B,C).\nUse the scissors to further clear muscle away from the lamina and around the pedicle with small snips. This will open up a small space between the vertebrae. Slowly and delicately insert one blade of the scissors into this gap and snip the pedicle. Make sure the curvature of the scissors is always positioned laterally, away from the cord.  Repeat on the other side. (see Figure 1D,E)",
    "Lift the lamina to expose the cord and carefully snip it off.  Be sure not to leave any free or jagged bone fragments behind. (see Figure 1F)\nPrior to injection, clean any blood away with sterile cotton swabs.\n5.\tInjection of cells\nAttach the needle with needle nut to the Hamilton syringe and clean them by flushing several times with water, then 70% ethanol, and finally HBSS. Insert plunger after each fill with water, 70% ethanol, or HBSS.\nPrepare the Hamilton syringe for cell loading by removing the plunger and loosening the needle nut and pulling the needle away from the syringe to prevent backpressure. Ensure that careful handling of the needle and nut are done with sterile gloves.\nLoad 15μl of cells into pipette tip and press the tip tightly into the back end of the syringe to load the cells into the syringe.\nInsert the plunger about 5mm and then tighten the needle nut.\nDepress plunger until some of the cell suspension is seen exiting the needle.\nMake sure there are no bubbles in the syringe and lay the syringe down in the horizontal position to prevent the cells from making a gradient by gravity.\nGrab hold of the laminectomized mouse by the spinalis dorsi muscle connecting the spines of T8 and T9 (Figure 2B, C).\nClamp the hemostat to the left (vertical) micromanipulator arm so that the mouse’s front paws are in the air and its rear paws lightly touching a platform of sterile paper towels as in Figures 2A and 2B.\nAttach the syringe to the right micromanipulator arm (at a 70° angle) and slide the syringe to the lowest position possible before clamping.\nStabilize the mouse by pinning its tail against the paper towels and slowly lower the syringe (Figure 2B).",
    "Lower the needle towards the cord and insert the needle 1mm into the opposite hemisphere through the dorsal midline (Figure 2C).  The tip of the needle should be in the gray matter close to the central canal.\nSlowly inject 2.5μl of cells. Inject at a rate of 1μl / 5 seconds.  After injecting the cells, wait a 10 seconds and retract the needle a tenth of a turn at a time every 10 seconds until the needle is out of the cord.  Pay attention to possible efflux of cell suspension.\nQuickly retract the syringe and detach it from the micromanipulator arm.  Lay the syringe down horizontally.\nRelease the mouse and transfer to suturing table.\nRepeat steps 5.7-5.14 for each mouse until the syringe is emptied. Sterilize tools (in the sterilizer) and the needle (by wiping with ethanol) between animals.  Discard cells and reload if clumping is visible.\nClean the syringe as in step 5.1 between loads.\n6.\tSutures and post-op care\nSuture the incision.  Suture needle is inserted into the superficial fascia on both sides of the incision.  The thread is strung through, pulling superficial fascia together (Figure 3A), thereby covering the exposed spinal cord at the site of removed lamina.  Do not suture the cutaneous muscle attached to the skin or the skeletal muscle of the back.   Pull the entire thread through, leaving approximately 1/2\".  Using the needle holder, three knots are formed and thread is trimmed as close to the knot as possible.\nClose the incision by applying two to three staples (depending on size of incision) to the skin (Figure 3B).  Carefully pull skin away from the mouse to avoid stapling the underlying muscle.\nUsing a 26G3/8 needle inject 0.5ml Lactated Ringers sub-cutaneously in the lower back away from the incision.",
    "Place mouse back in its cage. To ensure it is able to breathe\ncomfortably while under anesthesia, the mouse should be placed on its\nside in the cage, avoiding contact between the surgery site and cage\nbedding. Cages should be placed on heating pads. \nMice are monitored after anesthesia wears off to ensure bleeding subsides, sutures remain closed, and that mice return to pre-surgery mobility.\nTreat mice one time with the analgesic buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) following surgery.\nEnsure impaired mice have sufficient access to food and water: water bottles are fitted with extended 3.5 inch spouts and mice that are unable to walk are hand fed water and/or high-calorie dietary supplement (Nutri-Cal, Tomlyn).\n7. Representative Results:\nDesired results will be identifiable by the lack of efflux of the cell suspension during the injection and by the intact appearance of the spinal cord following the procedure. To this end, it is vital to have bright and direct lighting on the mouse’s spine during the laminectomy and during the injection.  Optimal lighting is facilitated by fiber optic lighting (Figure 2A).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2834/2834fig1.jpg\nFigure 1- Laminectomy.
