This method results in the expression of TF activity reporter constructs in the neurons of a wide area of telencephalon such as the cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The detailed procedures of in utero injection of viral vectors at a similar embryonic stage have been described before (Dong et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Briefly,\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1911-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expected expression of reporter constructs\nThe fluorescent image of the brain sections of mice injected with LV-based reporter at E15, immunostained with an antibody recognizing the Ref gene (anti-Flag-tag, green), shown with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (magenta). The higher magnification images within the dotted squares are shown on the right.\n(A) Sagittal brain section of an 8-week-old mouse.

Scale bar, 1,000 μm (left) and 500 μm (right).\nAnesthetize a pregnant mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 500 μL anesthetic (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nConfirm the surgical level of anesthesia. Check the absence of reflection to pinching the paw with forceps.\nDisinfect the abdomen of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nCut the skin along the midline (2–3 cm) with sterilized scissors.\nGently take the embryos out from the abdomen, and hydrate them and the abdominal cavity with warm PBS.",
    "Use a flashlight to visualize the embryos and the ventricle of interest, where the injection needs to be administered. If the embryo is not in the optimal position, carefully relocate the head of the embryo with your fingers.\nInject the virus solution loaded in the injection needle into the lateral ventricle of each embryo. Approximately 1 μL of the viral mixture is pressure-injected into each embryo by the glass injection needle.\nPut the embryos back into the abdomen of the female. Fill the abdominal cavity with warm PBS.\nSuture the abdominal and skin incision.\nHeat the body with a heating pad until recovery from anesthesia and return to the home cage.\nNote: Inject a similar amount of virus into every embryo. Since it is hard to non-invasively quantify the amount of viral infection after birth, failure or variation of viral infection among the siblings will lower the quality of TF-activity measurement and their comparison between the condition.\nNote: Analgesic reagents such as medetomidine or butorphanol are included in the anesthesia used in this protocol.\nCritical: The anesthetic time depends on the anesthesia used. The duration of anesthetic time of the medetomidine-midazolam-butorphanol mixture used in this protocol is reported to be around 40–50 min (Kawai et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Practice well to conduct the entire procedure within this time period. Other anesthesia, such as isoflurane, can be used instead. To prevent damage to the embryos and the dam, constantly apply warm PBS to the embryos to avoid dehydration.\nPreforming behavioral stimulation on mice\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "This step describes the timing and tips of sacrificing animals for sample preparation. Because our procedure relies on measuring and comparing the TF-activity among different animals across the different conditions, it is important to control the basal activity of mice and their brains. Irregular or aggressive behavior immediately before the sample preparation may cause undesired impacts on the TF-activity measured from such animals. For example, keeping mice individually housed before and during an experiment and performing an experiment at the same time of day for all the subjects will aid the quality of data obtained.\nThe experiment procedure of sample preparation changes according to what kind of TF activity the experimenter tries to assess. In one case, if the experimenter intended to measure the basal activity of TFs, it is required to keep the animals in a calm situation in their home cages before sacrificing them. In another case, if the experiment is intended to assess the change of TF activity upon experimental stimuli or induced behaviors, it is required to perform the behavioral experiment at exactly the same timing for every animal and wait for the time necessary to reflect the change of TF activity on the expression of Rep. Since each TF has its own time course of activation, which may depend on activation timing and the speed of signal transduction within the cell and so on, it is required to determine and be strict to the timing of behavioral experiment and sample preparation.\nAfter the pups are born, execute experiments needed at the desired age.\nBefore the experiments, keep the mice individually housed for 2–3 days.\nSubject behavioral experiment to each mouse.\nWait for the time required to reflect on the TF-activity change.\nSacrifice the mice and promptly proceed to the subsequent RNA purification process.",
    "Critical: This process should be performed after confirming that mice are expressing TF activity reporter constructs in the desired cell population. To assess this, we recommend performing immunostaining of brain sections obtained from some siblings. The transfected population can be efficiently evaluated by using the antibodies against the immunostaining tags included in the Ref genes (i.e., Flag, HA, V5, Myc, C-tag, Strep-tag).\nNote: The time required to reflect the TF-activity differs across TFs. To measure the basal activity change of TF-activity according to chronic manipulation, such as gene knockout and chronic administration of reagents, no particular experimental stimulation is required. Nevertheless, keeping the mice in the same condition for the same duration before the sample preparation will aid the reproducibility of data.\nPurifying RNA from a tissue sample\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step describes the procedure for purifying RNA to measure the TF activity. Obtaining total RNA of mice expressing TF activity reporter requires homogenization and purification process; this protocol uses a guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). In this protocol, we use a homemade RNA extraction solution, but a commercially available reagent (e.g., TRIZOL, TRI reagent) can be used instead.\nPrepare RNA Extraction Solution for homogenizing tissue samples. The contents of this solution are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. The addition of chloroform at step 20 is required for phenol-chloroform extraction of RNA.\nKeep a screw cap tube with 800 μL PBS on ice.\nEuthanize the mouse according to institutional guidelines.\nDissect the brain into ice-cold PBS.\nDissect the desired brain region under a microscope and collect the tissue (50–150 mg) into the ice-cold PBS in the screw tube.",
    "Replace PBS with 1 mL of room temperature RNA extraction solution and put a 5 mm stainless bead within the tube for homogenizing the tissue.\nShake the tube with a beads mill homogenizer for 30 s at 3,800 rpm.\nCritical: To prevent artificial TF-activity change or RNA degradation, always keep the brain and dissected tissue on ice. Promptly proceed with the procedure from the euthanizing of the mouse until the homogenization in RNA extraction solution. We recommend performing this procedure individually for each euthanized animal, paying attention that all the animals are processed at the same time course.\nPause point: Homogenized tissue can be stored at –80°C for years before the RNA purification.\nKeep the samples at room temperature.\nAdd 0.3 mL of chloroform to the homogenized tissue and stir vigorously with a beads mill homogenizer or a vortex mixer for more than 30 s.\nStore the samples for 3 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 20°C.\nCollect ∼500 μL of the supernatant into a new tube.\nNote: The opaque middle layer between chloroform and the transparent upper layer contains DNA. Keep the middle layer untouched during the collection of the supernatant from the upper layer. To increase the purity of RNA, the process of chloroform-liquid separation should be repeated one more time. The amount of supernatant collected in the second separation should be less than ∼300 μL.\nAdd an equal volume of 2-propanol and precipitate the total RNA by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash the precipitated RNA with 75% ethanol and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDry the RNA pellet and dissolve it with RNase-free water at 55°C.\nStore the RNA at –80°C.",
    "Critical: The recommended RNA concentration is less than 1 μg / μL. Too much total RNA lowers the efficiency of RT-PCR.\nNote: All the reagents must be RNase-free. For making solutions, use RNase-free water, such as diethylpyrocarbonate treated water.\nPause point: RNA solution can be stored at –80°C for years.\nRT-qPCR for purified RNA\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step describes the procedure for efficiently synthesizing cDNA of the TF activity reporter gene from the isolated RNA. RT-PCR was performed with ReverTra Ace with gDNA remover kit. To efficiently reverse transcribe the virus-vector-derived reporter genes (Reps and Refs), we use gene-specific primers targeting the sequence common to all Ref and Rep (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) in addition to RT-primers included in the kit.\nRemove contaminating genome DNAs in the RNA samples by gDNA Eraser included in the kit. Detailed volume and reaction time are described below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1911_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1911_9.csv\nPerform RT-PCR on the RNA samples. Detailed volume and reaction time are described below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1911_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1911_11.csv\nNote: The resultant cDNA can be diluted to 5 × with RNase-free water and used for the subsequent qPCR analysis.\nPause point: The cDNAs can be stored at –80°C for months. Avoid repeated freeze and thaw.\nQuantify the expression of Rep and Ref by qPCR.\nCreate calibration curves using stepwise dilutions of plasmid DNA of known concentration containing the sequence of the target genes; Reps and Refs.\nPrepare qPCR reaction master mix without cDNA according to the following table and dispense 8 μL of the master mix into a PCR plate.\nAdd 2 μL of cDNA to each well.\nMix the solution well.\nPerform qPCR.\nNote: This protocol uses the intercalation method with absolute quantification. Detailed volume and reaction time are listed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1911_12.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1911_13.csv",
    "Critical: qPCR to quantify each of the paired genes of Ref and Rep must be conducted simultaneously on a single PCR plate. If multiple TF activity reporters were expressed in the same sample, it is necessary to confirm that the primer-set amplifies the target sequence without nonspecific amplification. For such confirmation, perform PCR on negative control samples that include all the plasmids conveying all the Reps and Refs but the target ones.\nFor each Ref and Rep, calculate the TF activity by normalizing the Rep expression quantity by that of the corresponding Ref for each sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Summarize the activity data to obtain the TFAP, which aids a comprehensive understanding of the activities of multiple TFs in the mouse brain.\nCritical: Absolute quantification is necessary to determine the exact amount of cDNA of the target molecule. We typically obtain 1,000–10,000 molecules of Ref genes per 2 μL of cDNA used for qPCR. A low amount of Ref gene expression will distort the calculation of TF activities."
