    "All experiments were approved by the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST license No. 2108002). All animal studies were conducted according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Male and female C57BL/6J and Mitfmi-vga9/+ mice were used in this study. C57BL/6J mice (n = 7) were used as a control. The wild types were commercially obtained (see Table of Materials), but all mutant mice (n = 7) were bred and raised at animal facilities in the Biomedical Center at the University of Iceland. In the present study, 3-month-old animals were used; however, the protocol applies even to 1 month and older animals.\n1. Experimental preparation\nPrepare the anesthesia mixture. Take one ampule of a 2 mL ketamine stock solution (25 mg/mL) and 250 µL xylazine stock solution (2%) to prepare a working solution of ketamine/xylazine mixture (25 mg/mL ketamine and 20 mg/mL xylazine) (see Table of Materials).\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of the ketamine/xylazine mixture, with a volume of fluid that is four times the mouse's body weight; for example, a mouse 20 g in weight needs 35 µL of xylazine/ketamine working solution to obtain a working dose of xylazine (4 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine (40 mg/kg body weight) mixture.\nDilate the pupils with an eye drop of 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride and 1% tropicamide immediately following anesthesia.\nWait until the animal is fully anesthetized and its pupils are widely dilated.\nPrepare fluorescein salt solution. Add 9 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1x) to 1 mL of fluorescein solution (100 mg/mL stock concentration) (see Table of Materials). The final concentration working solution is 10 mg/mL.\n2. In vivo imaging of retinal vasculature using a rodent retinal imaging system",
    "Administer fluorescein working solution intraperitoneally (5 µL/g body weight) to the anesthetized animal.\nApply a drop of 2% methylcellulose gel to the corneal surface and then place the animal on the positioning stage of the imaging system (see Table of Materials).\nPosition the retinal imaging fundus camera lens to touch the mouse's cornea directly and gently. To place the optic nerve head in the middle of the visual field, slightly adjust the alignment.\nSwitch to the green fluorescent channel on the fundus camera.\nFocus on the retinal vessels to take images.\nTo find the ideal time point, take a number of photos at 1, 3, 5, and 10 min (but no longer than 10 min) following the fluorescein injection.\n\tNOTE: The FA treatment must be completed within 10 min, as after that time the fluorescein may become too diffused, and the vessels become undetectable.\nOn completion of imaging, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\n3. Analysis of the retinal vessel's diameter\nOpen the MATLAB program (see Table of Materials).\nDownload and save the \"fundusDiameter.m\" code (see Supplementary Coding File 1, Supplementary Coding File 2, and Supplementary Coding File 3).\nOpen the folder where the code was saved. Drag the code and drop it over the Current Folder in MATLAB.\nDrag and drop the FFA image (fundus fluorescence angiography image) or images one wishes to analyze over the Current Folder in MATLAB.\nPress the Run tool from the MATLAB toolbar.\nA pop-up window will appear. Write the file name of the image of interest in the Enter filename box and press OK.\n\tNOTE: Do not change or modify the rest of the parameters.",
    "Select the center of the optic disc, and then select the edge of the optic disc. The software now calculates the intensity of pixels in the mouse fundus images in a circle with a radius that is twice that of the optic disk, clockwise from the optic disk's center (Figure 1).\nNext, ensure that the software plots the mean vessel diameter (in pixels) of each vessel in the fundus as a function of vessel number (Figure 2).\nFollowing that, ensure that the software transfers the measurement data for each vessel into an Excel document, where the mean, median, and standard deviation of these values are calculated (Table 1 and Table 2).\nMove the values from the results table to a spreadsheet program by selecting all the values in the table. Paste the values into the spreadsheet.\nPlot the graphs and perform statistical analysis using the data pasted into a spreadsheet program of choice (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
