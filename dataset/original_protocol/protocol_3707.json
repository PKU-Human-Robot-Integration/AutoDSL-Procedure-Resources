    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal anesthesia and analgesia\nTiming: [15–20 min]\nPrepare a solution of Xylazine/Ketamine (2 mg·mL−1 and 10 mg·mL−1, respectively) diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCl. Warm the solution on the heating pad.\nPrepare a solution of buprenorphine (0.3 mg·mL−1) diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCl. Warm the solution on the heating pad. Alternatively, ketoprofen (0.5 mg·mL−1) can be used for analgesia.\nAnesthetize the timed-pregnant mouse via an intra-peritoneal injection of Xylazine/Ketamine solution (10 mg·kg−1 and 100 mg·kg−1, respectively). The anesthesia provides about 30 min to complete the procedure. Alternatively, gas anesthesia using isofluorane can be used. This type of anesthesia enables a faster recovery of the mouse. However, keep in mind that the constraints of using gas anesthesia with a mask on the mouse may complicate the manipulation of the embryos.\nInject subcutaneously the anesthetized mouse with the analgesic solution (0.0125 mg·kg−1 buprenorphine).\nCritical: Insert the needle in the middle of the abdomen, between the lower nipples, at a depth of about 6 mm. The intraperitoneal injection should be done with the needle at 45° to the skin to avoid damaging the embryos.\nPreparation of the surgery\nTiming: [5 min]\nCut as short as possible (0.5 mm maximum) the tip of a capillary using the Dumont forceps oriented in order to obtain a beveled tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Fill the capillary with the DNA solution, using a mouth aspirator tube. A microinjector can also be used for this step.",
    "Critical: Cut the capillary tip as thin as possible to keep it sharp and able to easily penetrate the amniotic sacs. However, too thin capillaries clog easily. Too thick capillaries create a hole in the amniotic sac that will lead to a leak of the amniotic solution and lead to the death of the embryo. This step needs to be calibrated and adjusted based on the settings used to pull the micropipettes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Before injecting the DNA in the embryo’s retina, make sure that the capillary is not clogged by ejecting some of the DNA solution out of the micropipette.\nPrepare the mouse for the surgery.\nUsing the hair trimmer, shave the lower part of the mouse abdomen. Shave an area of about 2 cm long and 1 cm large, and try not to rip the nipples.\nPlace the mouse on the surgical drape, with the abdomen towards the experimenter. Apply ocular protecting gel.\nDisinfect the abdomen with povidone iodine first and then 70% ethanol. Place a gauze pad as surgical drape on top of the shaved abdomen. By using a Pasteur pipette, help the gauze pad adhering to the shaved abdomen by wetting it with warmed 0.9% NaCl (30°C).\nSurgical procedure\nTiming: [20 min]\nExposing the embryos.\nPerform a midline laparotomy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) by doing a longitudinal incision of about 1.5 cm long through the linea alba. First cut the skin and then cut the muscle. Do not cut past the lower nipples. Cut as straight as possible to easily affix both parts of the muscle and skin together during the suturing and help the scarring. After this step, the uterine horns are exposed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/633-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustrations of the key steps of the surgical procedure\n(A) Skin and muscle incision.",
    "(B) To inject the plasmid in the eye, the capillary should be almost parallel to the uterine wall, with a small angle, in order to facilitate the capillary’s piercing the uterine wall, the amniotic membrane and the side of the eye. The closer the eye is to the uterine wall, the easier it is to pierce the eye with the capillary.\n(C) The negative electrode is placed on the eye to be electroporated, covering the ventro-temporal (VT) region, and the positive electrode is placed on the other side of the head. The surface of both electrodes should entirely touch the uterine wall.\n(D) The negative electrode is placed on the VT retina, covering almost half of the eye. Scale bar: D, 2 mm.\nVery gently, pull one uterine horn out of the abdomen cavity, by grabbing the uterine horn in between embryos. Importantly, rough manipulation and pulling of the last embryo (most distal from the ovary) can trigger abortion after the surgery. Be extra careful not to pinch any of the embryos, they are often in very close contact with the muscle (Troubleshooting 2).\nCritical: Keep all the embryos wet during the entire surgery using warm and sterile 0.9% NaCl delivered with a Pasteur pipette.\nDNA injection in the eye.\nUsing the 2 pairs of standard forceps, gently grab the first embryo and immobilize it with one pair of forceps (ring forceps can also be used here). Gently position the embryo so the eye gets in close apposition with the amniotic membrane and uterine wall.",
    "Using the capillary filled with DNA, pierce the uterine wall, the amniotic sac and the eye in one time (Troubleshooting 3). Fill the eye with 1 μL of the DNA solution. Avoid injecting with the capillary perpendicular to the eye, instead inject with the capillary almost parallel to the uterine wall, with only a small angle, and pierce the eye through the side of the eye (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Resistance will usually be felt when piercing the eye, while no resistance will be felt while piercing the embryo outside of the eye. The eye turns green in case of successful injection (Troubleshooting 4). If the capillary is in the amniotic sac but not in the eye, fast green will be observed in the amniotic sac.\nElectroporate the retina.\nImmerse the electrodes in highly conductive, multi-purpose ultrasound transmission gel (AquaSonic 01-08).\nPlace the head of the embryo between the electrodes.\nAlways approach the paddles from the back of the embryo.\nPlace the negative electrode on the ventro-temporal part of the injected eye; and the positive electrode on the other side of the head. Adjust the angle between the electrode and the head axis so that the ventro-temporal retina is between the cathode and the anode (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nApply five electric pulses of 45 V during 50 ms every 950 ms using the paddle of the preprogrammed electroporator.\nCritical: It is crucial to stay still (embryo and electrodes) during the electroporation. Any shift would result in a wider electroporated area, or a missed VT targeting (Troubleshooting 5).",
    "Repeat steps 8 and 9 for all of the embryos. Repeat these steps for the second uterine horn. To assess the survival rate, take note of the total number of embryos electroporated. Since it can be hard to recognize a non-electroporated embryo from an electroporated embryo, start with the first embryo (the closest to the ovary) and then electroporate them in order, from the closest to the most distant from the ovary.\nCritical: Wet profusely all the embryos with warm and sterile 0.9% NaCl after the electroporation of each embryo.\nCritical: It is critical to avoid any damage to the placenta during the manipulation of the embryos, or to inject through a blood vessel. During the electroporation, the experimenter should gently hold the embryos with the electrodes with minimal force.\nClosing the abdominal cavity.\nGently place the uterine horns back in the abdominal cavity.\nFill the abdomen with warm and sterile NaCl 0.9%.\nClose the muscle with continuous sutures.\nClose the skin with lock-stitch sutures.\nIf the mouse endures pain during the sutures, apply oxybuprocaine as local anesthetics.\nApply povidone iodine to the sutures.\nCritical: The mouse should not have its abdomen open for more than 30 min to ensure a high survival rate of the embryos, and for anesthesia constraints.\nPost-surgical care\nTiming: [3 days]\nLeave the mouse in an incubator at 30°C until it wakes up before placing it back to its cage. The cage should not be cleaned at least two days before and five days after the surgery, so that the mouse recovers in a familiar environment. Leave the embryos to develop normally.",
    "Minimize mouse disturbances and check for signs of pain during the first 48 h after the surgery (hunched position, reduced activity, squinted eyes). If signs of pain are detected, inject the analgesic solution (0.0125 mg·kg−1 buprenorphine). If the analgesia does not improve the mouse welfare, proceed to euthanasia.\nCarefully check for the suture integrity until the skin is properly closed. Re-suture if needed (although repeated anesthesia can be detrimental for the embryos’ survival).\nExpected outcomes\nThis protocol for ventro-temporal retinal in utero electroporation enables the expression of a gene of interest in both ipsilaterally projecting RGCs and their neighbors projecting contralaterally. A survival rate of 50% or more is expected from a trained experimenter. One of the key points is the survival of the pups after birth since cannibalism is not uncommon. This survival rate is obtained with C57BL/6NRj pups and Swiss foster dams. Among the surviving pups, about 60% are expected to exhibit electroporated RGCs specifically in the ventro-temporal retina when using the CAG promoter. An extensive training might be necessary to reach this success rate.\nUsing pan-cellular promoters (e.g., CAG) will not exclusively target RGCs, but all retinal cell types. The successful targeting and efficiency of the electroporation can be assessed by dissecting and imaging the retina and retinal brain targets (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). A successful electroporation labels cells in the VT retina (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). A longer incision in the ventral retina can be made during the dissection to orient the retina. Optic chiasm dissection and imaging validate the targeting of ipsi- and/or contralaterally projecting RGCs. The projections of the electroporated RGCs can be visualized at the optic chiasm level (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) and in their brain targets, in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D–3G).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/633-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) Drawing depicting the localization of the projections of electroporated RGCs in the mouse visual system, following this protocol. In this example, post-natal injections of cholera toxin β subunit conjugated to different fluorophores were performed in each eye to visualize the axons of electroporated RGCs (in green) in the visual targets and compare their position with the projections of all RGCs of the electroporated eye (blue) and with the projections of the opposite retina (red).\n(B) Electroporated RGCs are found in the ventro-temporal retina, projecting their axons to the optic disc.\n(C–G) (C) At the level of the optic chiasm, some electroporated visual axons avoid the midline (ipsilaterally projecting); while others cross the midline (contralaterally projecting axons). This protocol for ventro-temporal retinal electroporation targets axons projecting to the ipsilateral visual nuclei: (D) the dorso-lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN) and (F) the superior colliculus (SC). A subset of axons projecting to the contralateral visual nuclei are also electroporated: (E) dLGN and (G) SC. Scale bars: 100 μm.\nThis protocol can be combined with post-natal injections of cholera toxin β subunit conjugated to different fluorophores in each eye to visualize the entire visual projections of both eyes. This technique enables assessing the position of axonal projections of the electroporated RGCs in the visual targets (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D–3G). The procedure can be adapted to target other retinal quadrants, by adjusting the position of the electrodes."
