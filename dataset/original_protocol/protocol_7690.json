    "Adapter pair preparationMix the two adapter oligonucleotides to a final concentration of 250 ng/μl.Incubate them at 95 °C for 5 min and then at room temperature for 10 min.Restriction/LigationAdd to a 0.2 ml tube: 1 μl of 10x ligase buffer, 1 μl of 0.5 M NaCl, 1 μl of the adapter pair 120 units of T4 ligase, 2 units of HpaII or MspI, 300-500 ng of genomic DNA and ddH2O to a final volume of 10 μl.Mix well and incubate at 37 °C for 2-3 h.Dilute reaction 1: 10 by adding 90 μl of ddH2O.This reaction can be stored at -20 °C.Pre-selective amplificationAdd to a 0.2 ml tube: 2 μl of 10x Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 2 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.8 μl of dNTP mix, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, 1 μl of 50 ng μl-1 adapter-specific pre-selective primer, 1 μl of 50 ng/μl transposon-specific primer, 4 μl of Restriction/Ligation reaction products (cut with HpaII or MspI) and ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μl.Use the thermal cycler to PCR with the following program:94 °C for 3 min94 °C for 30 s60 °C for 30 s72 °C for 1 min Return to step b 29 timesRun 10 μl of the resulting products on a 1.5% agarose gel to validate amplification.Dilute the remaining 10 μl with 190 μl of ddH2O.This reaction can be stored at -20 °C.RadiolabelingFor 20 reactions, add to a 0.2 ml tube: 6 μl of ddH2O, 6 μl of transposon-specific primer, 2 μl of 10x PNK buffer, 1 μl of PNK and 5 μl of radiolabeled ATP.Mix well and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h and then at 70 °C for 10 min.Selective amplificationAdd to a 0.",
    "2 ml tube: 2 μl of 10x Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 2 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.8 μl of dNTP mix, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, 1 μl of 50 ng μl-1 adapter-specific selective primer, 1 μl of radiolabeled (or fluorescently labeled) transposon-specific primer, 3 μl of pre-selective amplification PCR products and ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μl.Use the thermal cycler to PCR with the following program:94 °C for 2 min.63 °C for 30 sec (decrease temperature by 1 °C every cycle until 56 °C).72 °C for 1 min. Return to step b 32 times.Run the resulting products on a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel (for radio-labeled products, see Figure 2 for an example); or add 0.5 μl of GS-500 ROX-labeled size standard, 1-2.5 μl of PCR product (add less PCR product if fluorescence intensity is too high) and complete to 13 μl with formamide (for fluorescently-labeled products only).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130527/20130527061718_6541.pngFigure 2. An example (Yaakov and Kashkush, 2011) of an autoradiogram showing TMD products for 6 DNA samples representing two parental plants (P1 and P2) and their allopolyploid offspring (S1-S4). The TE analyzed is a Stowaway-like miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE), called Thalos. Arrow (a) shows a change in methylation between S1 and S2, as only the MspI band is present in P1 and S1-S2, but both HpaII and MspI bands are present in S3-S4. The disappearence (b) or appearance (c) of bands can also be seen, which may arise as a result of complete methylation of the restriction site, or a mutation in the restriction or primer binding sites.",
    "The total percent methylation of all sites for a given sample analyzed can be calculated by dividing the number of polymorphic sites (those resenting bands for only one restriction enzyme) by the total number of sites (presenting bands for one and both restriction enzymes)."
