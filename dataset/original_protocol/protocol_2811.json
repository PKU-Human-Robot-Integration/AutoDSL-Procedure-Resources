    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The preliminary steps presented above are crucial to generating a truly\n      photoreceptor-directed stimulus. The method of silent substitution can be\n      applied under a wide range of experimental conditions107[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib107]\n      once it has been confirmed that the generated stimulus is isolating the\n      response of a single photoreceptor class. What follows in this section is\n      an exemplar melanopsin-directed silent substitution experiment which puts\n      together a selection of the preliminary steps discussed above and applies\n      it to a melanopsin-directed temporal grating stimulus with temporal white\n      noise in the inter-stimulus interval. A toolbox has been developed in\n      MS-Excel to support this protocol and is available for download via the\n      QUT Research Data Finder[href=https://doi.org/10.25912/RDF_1670844246774].11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nPre-experiment preparation\nTiming: 1 day (excluding institutional\n      approvals)\n    \nInstitutional Approvals: Perform experimental protocols in\n        accordance with institutional research ethics approvals.\n      \nReport participant demographics: To facilitate replication of\n        results, report the relevant factors from the criteria listed below in\n        the methodological description of the experiment:\n        \n            State the recruitment method and inclusion and exclusion criteria\n            for healthy and disease groups.\n            \nNote: This may require an\n              ophthalmic and/or medical examination with reference to the\n              participant inclusion criteria. If applicable, include details of\n              the randomisation to groups/treatments. Basic demographics can\n              include age, information on the sex and specific relevant clinical\n              features, for example presence/absence of ocular disease, systemic\n              disease, sleep, mood disorders, genotypes or other disease or\n              co-morbidity characteristics relevant for the research\n              question/outcomes.\n            \n            Specify the clinical instruments (model and manufacturer) used for\n            the participant classifications, for example, for visual acuity,\n            contrast sensitivity, color vision, fundus photography, OCT,\n            intraocular pressure, clinical grading scales, and documentation of\n            medications (e.g., dosage, frequency).\n          \n            Determine the sample size needed based on the experimental design.\n            \nNote: Power analyses can inform\n              the minimum number of participants required for the statistical",

The\n              effects of individual differences on the experimental outcomes can\n              be examined by including a comprehensive classification and\n              measurement of participant performance on as many dimensions as\n              are feasible.\n            \nInstrumentation\nTiming: Refer to before you begin\n      timings for each step\n    \n      The instrumentation for this example is the 5-primary photostimulator\n      introduced by Cao et al.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] The protocols apply to\n      5-primary displays designed to generate structured images:17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]\n        Choose a set of 5-primary lights as per steps 1–4 (Toolbox[href=https://doi.org/10.25912/RDF_1670844246774]: “Trimmed LED Spectra”)11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]: [peak\n        wavelengths (full widths at half maximum) at 456 nm (10 nm), 488 nm\n        (11 nm), 540 nm (10 nm), 594 nm (14 nm), and 633 nm (15 nm)].\n      \n        Calculate the 5 × 5 A-matrix using the corneal melanopsin, rhodopsin and\n        CIE 10° standard observer L-, M-, and S-cone photoreceptor spectral\n        sensitivities (Toolbox[href=https://doi.org/10.25912/RDF_1670844246774]: “Standard Observer (CIE)”) and the measured 5 primary spectral\n        outputs (Toolbox[href=https://doi.org/10.25912/RDF_1670844246774]: “A matrix”).11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\n(Equation 15)\nβ\n⇀\n=\n[\n2.04\n27.0\n0.04\n0.00\n0.00\n0.12\n12.5\n11.5\n6.26\n0.80\n0.11\n7.04\n10.2\n8.25\n8.81\n0.41\n31.0\n7.76\n1.63\n0.04\n0.53\n39.3\n4.31\n0.45\n0.01\n]\np\n⇀\n        Develop the system to present a uniform image to the observer.

To eliminate the effects of pre-light exposure to indoor\n        (artificial) or outdoor (daylight) illumination, each observer adapts in\n        the dark-room for 15 min prior to commencement of the test sessions.\n      \nNote: Experiments of rod mediated vision:\n      Dark adapt for 30–40 min depending on the pre-light exposure conditions.101[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib101]\n      Follow with a pre-adaptation to the background field before commencing the\n      test protocol (e.g., 2 min for a 2000 Ph Td/4360 Sc Td adapting field).\n    \n      The duration of pre- adaption is dependent on the viewing conditions and\n      must be sufficiently long to allow maximal sensitivity for all\n      photoreceptor pathways. It is good practice to conduct pilot experiments\n      to determine the effect of dark-adaptation times on the outcome measures,\n      and to optimize them to minimize the protocol duration.",
    "Critical: Any assumption that rods are\n      saturated for the light levels should be verified with additional\n      psychophysical, pupillography or electrophysiological measurements under\n      the viewing conditions.\n    \n        Report the laboratory measurement conditions including the room\n        illumination (Lux), pre-dark or pre-light adaptation duration (or no\n        adaptation) to the room illumination and/or background adaptation\n        stimulus levels (scotopic, mesopic, photopic). When relevant, report the\n        environmental conditions (time-of-day, temperature, humidity).\n      \n        Observer tasks: It is important for participants to have a clear\n        understanding of all experimental tasks, including the observer\n        calibration. Visual and non-visual sensitivity can be affected by the\n        measurement conditions of the laboratory; identify and control potential\n        factors affecting internal and external validity. Effects of observer\n        anticipation and habitation should be minimized. Randomize the order of\n        presentation to limit the effects of fatigue and learning across\n        multiple testing sessions. Ensure sufficient practice; exclude the data\n        from the practice sessions.\n      \nStimulus presentation\n        The stimulus characteristics and experimental paradigm will depend on\n        the research question. For this example, we present a\n        melanopsin-directed stimulus as a 1 s duration, 1 Hz temporal sinusoidal\n        waveform (Toolbox[href=https://doi.org/10.25912/RDF_1670844246774]: “Stimulus”)11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] with temporal white noise\n        presented in the inter-stimulus interval (2 s). The participant views\n        the stimulus through the artificial pupil.\n      \n        The mean adapting chromaticity is metameric to an equal energy white\n        spectrum (\nS M L R i\n=\n[\n1 , 1\n/ 3 ,\n2 / 3\n, 1 , 1\n]\n ) (Toolbox[href=https://doi.org/10.25912/RDF_1670844246774]:\n        “A matrix”).11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\n        At this point the system is functional for generating\n        photoreceptor-directed stimuli. From here the experimental procedure and\n        recorded data is dependent on the aims of the psychophysical,\n        electrophysiology (including ERG and VEP) and pupillometry experiments."
