    "All animal experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Protocol # 3609). Anesthesia was administered for all imaging and surgical procedures. All animals were housed in accordance with approved IACUC protocols.\nNOTE: The experimental design of this protocol is shown in Figure 1. Purchase six-week-old rats with their ovaries surgically removed and feed them an LCD consisting of 0.01% calcium and 0.77% phosphate. After a period of 4 months of an LCD, drill a critical-size vertebral defect in the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebral bodies (L4-L5). Following surgery, image the rats on day 1 and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 after defect establishment. Locate defect margins on the day 1 scan, reorient to a standard position, and define a cylindrical volume of interest (VOI). Automatically register the subsequent µCT scans (i.e., for weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) of each rat to the standard position defined for the corresponding day 1 scan. Apply the day 1 predefined VOI to the registered scans. Assess the bone volume density and apparent density of the VOIs.\n1. Induction of Osteoporosis\nPut six-week-old athymic ovariectomized rats on 4 months of an LCD consisting of 0.01% calcium and 0.77% phosphate.\nSwitch back to a normal diet.\n\tNOTE: These rats will be referred to as \"osteoporotic rats\" hereafter.\n2. Vertebral Defect Model\nNOTE: The timing is 40 - 50 min per animal.\nAutoclave all surgical tools prior to surgery.\nIn the case of multiple surgeries, sterilize all surgical tools.\nWash the tools and place them in a sonicator bath for 5 min. Place them in a hot bead sterilizer set to 250 °C for 20 s. Allow the tools to cool down for 5 min.\nInduce anesthesia.",
    "Place the osteoporotic rat in the induction chamber attached to an anesthesia machine with a central scavenging system. Induce anesthesia using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen and maintain via nose cone at 2 - 3% isoflurane. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nApply a toe-pinch stimulus to ensure adequate plane of anesthesia. If no response is noted, initiate the procedure.\nPlace the anesthetized rat in dorsal recumbency on a heating pad (37 °C) and stretch the limbs using a magnetic fixator retraction system (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: The temperature of the heating pad is important for the prevention of hypothermia, since an anesthetized rat is unable to regulate its body temperature.\nShave the abdominal area using an electric shaver. Swab it with iodine-based antiseptic and chlorhexidine gluconate 0.5% followed by 70% ethanol.\nInject the rat with carprofen (5 mg/kg bodyweight (BW), subcutaneous (SQ)) before beginning the surgical procedure.\nUse a sterile scalpel to cut the skin. Begin the incision 1 cm below the xiphoid process and cut through the midline (~5 - 8 cm) (Figure 2B).\nUse surgical scissors to make an incision of the aponeurosis through the linea alba to access the abdominal cavity (Figure 2C).\nExpose the abdominal cavity using retractors (Figure 2D).\nDeflect the intestines to the right of the rat to expose the abdominal aorta and the left kidney (Figure 2E). Palpate the lumbar spine before proceeding to expose it. To avoid dehydration, use sterile soaked gauzes with sterile saline solution to wrap the internal organs.\nUse thermocautery to expose in layers the anterior aspect of lumbar vertebral bodies L4-5 and isolate them from the surrounding connective tissue and muscles (Figure 2F-G).\n\tNOTE: Thermocautery should be used to control bleeding during the dissection.",
    "Use a sterile cotton swab saturated with sterile saline to remove blood and residual tissue from the L4 vertebrae. Use a sterile Trephine drill bur (~2 mm in diameter) to drill a 5 mm-deep bone defect in the center of the exposed anterior aspect of the vertebral body (Figure 2H-I).\n\tNOTE: Apply minimal pressure to drill through only the ventral cortex and underlying trabecular bone; avoid drilling through the dorsal cortex. Note that the vertebrae of osteoporotic rats are very fragile. Use a cotton swab to clean the defect and apply pressure to stop bleeding, if present.\nRepeat step 2.11 on the L5 vertebra to create a total of 2 defects per rat (Figure 2J).\nReturn the intestines to the abdominal cavity.\nUse a vicryl synthetic absorbable surgical suture (3-0 vicryl undyed 27\" SH taper) in a continuous pattern to suture the aponeurosis (Figure 2K).\nClose the skin using a 4-0 monofilament nylon non-absorbable suture in a simple interrupted pattern (Figure 2L).\nApply 100 µL of topical skin adhesive on top of the skin sutures and between them to ensure the complete closure of the skin.\nInject the rat with warm (37 °C) lactated ringer's solution (1CC/100 g BW, SQ) to prevent hypothermia and dehydration.\nInject the rat with buprenorphine (0.5 mg/kg BW, SQ) prior to the surgery and every 8 - 12 h for post-op pain relief as needed.\nDo not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Also, do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\nAfter the animal has recovered on the heating pad, return it to its cage.\n\tNOTE: House the rats individually (i.e., in separate cages) to prevent rat-to-rat mutilation of the sutures and wound.",
    "Place chow soaked in water in a Petri dish on the cage floor for a few days post-op to help the rats reach the food.\nAdminister carprofen (5 mg/kg BW, SQ) 24 h post-surgery for pain relief every 24 h as needed.\nRemove the skin sutures while the animal is under 2% isoflurane anesthesia 10 - 14 days post-operation.\n3. MicroCT Scanning\nNOTE: The timing is 30 - 40 min per animal.\nOn the day following the surgical procedure, place the osteoporotic rat in the induction chamber attached to an anesthesia machine with a central scavenging system. Induce anesthesia using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen and maintain via nose cone at 2 - 3% isoflurane.\nScan the rat using an in vivo µCT scanner. Repeat scanning for the longitudinal analysis of bone regeneration.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that all animals are scanned using the same settings (i.e., X-ray energy, scanning medium, intensity, voxel size, and image resolution) and in a similar orientation. For example: X-ray energy, 55 kVP; current, 145 µA; voxel size, 35 µm; increments, 115 µm; and integration time, 200 ms; with the samples in PBS. Refer to Bouxtein et al.34 for further explanations and considerations involved in rodent µCT scanning for an assessment of bone microstructure. Ideally, the highest scan resolution available would be used for all scans; however, higher-resolution scans require longer acquisition times, generate large data sets, and expose the animals to more ionizing radiation. The latter may introduce unwanted effects, including decreased fracture healing.Therefore, the tradeoff between additional data and scan time should be carefully considered.\n4. Vertebral Separation\nNOTE: The timing is 20 - 30 min per sample.",
    "Contour the vertebra of interest, as demonstrated in Figure 3A-I.

Check that the VOI and defect are concentric.\n6. MicroCT Analysis\nNOTE: The timing is 10 - 20 min per sample.\nSend the VOI for evaluation using a µCT evaluation program (Figure 6).",
    "NOTE: Make sure to use the same parameters when analyzing all VOIs. Make sure the threshold is set high enough to omit background noise with minimal loss of bone. If a radiopaque biomaterial is used, a number of strategies could be used to analyze bone formation. If there is a difference in density between the biomaterial and bone tissue, the biomaterial could be segmented out35,36. Otherwise, the investigators could qualitatively evaluate the differences in bone formation between experimental groups.\n7. Euthanasia\nPPlace the osteoporotic rat in the induction chamber attached to an anesthesia machine. Induce anesthesia using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen.\nMaintain anesthesia via nose cone and perform euthanasia by incising the chest cavity to produce a bilateral pneumothorax37.\nSubscription Required.
