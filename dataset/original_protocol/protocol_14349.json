    "All procedures were performed using cadaveric rabbit eyes within intact outbred rabbit heads. All Institutional and National guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.\n1. Preparation of Solutions\nSMG preparation for TXL:\n\t\nPrepare 1 mL of 0.2 M concentration of sodium bicarbonate solution (NaHCO3) solution using 0.0165g of NaHCO3 powder dissolved in 1 mL of the distilled water.\nDissolve 0.1016 mg of powdered sodium hydroxymethylglycinate (SMG) in 1 mL of the distilled water to get a final concentration of 800 mM SMG. Adjust sodium bicarbonate solution to a final concentration of 0.1 M NaHCO3 and 400 mM SMG. Concentrations of SMG depending on the cross-linking effect desired. In the protocol described here we used 40, 100, and 400 mM SMG.\n2. SubTenon's Injection for TXL using SMG\nFill two 1 mL insulin syringes (25G needles) with 400 µL control and SMG solution, respectively.\nPlace the rabbit's head in a profile plane with the help of a cushion. Styrofoam or a paper stack can be used to fix the head in an optimal position.\nRetract the eyelids with a pediatric eye speculum.\nMeasure the initial intraocular pressure (IOP) using an applanation tonometry device.\nMark the site of intended injection on the upper middle part of the limbus with a tissue marker.\nRetract the conjunctiva surrounding the site of injection with a conjunctival forceps (or any forceps with serrated round tip) and insert the needle through the conjunctiva, entering Tenon's capsule just slightly beyond the marked limbal site (i.e., 2-3 mm from the limbus). A small incision in the conjunctiva can also be made with iris scissors in order to facilitate the passage of the needle through Tenon's capsule.",
    "Once within Tenon's capsule, make sure that the needle is freely mobile by moving it side-to-side. During this time, the globe should not move. This confirms proper placement of the needle above the sclera in the sub-Tenon's (sT) space.\nInject the solution from the syringe and discard the needle. Immediately following injection, the fluid will accumulate in the sT space creating an anterior bulge seen through the conjunctiva (i.e., chemosis).\nRepeat the IOP measurement in order to confirm that it did not change due to an inadvertent perforation of the globe.\nRemove the lid speculum, and perform digital massage through the closed eyelids for about 2-3 min.\nLeave the head for an incubation period of 3.5 h (room temperature = 18 °C), prior to moving to the next step.\n3. Tissue Preparation\nRetract the eyelids using the eyelid speculum in order to optimize access to the globe. Select the optimally sized speculum according to the size of the eye.\nSeparate the conjunctiva surrounding the limbus. If it has already been incised near the site of injection, circumferentially expand the borders so it would contain an inoculum size of approximately 1x1 cm.\nCut the extra-ocular muscles at their sites of scleral insertion.\nElevate the eyeball with forceps, pushing it from the posterior side. This provides access to the posterior globe and will facilitate cutting of the optic nerve with ophthalmic artery and vein located near the posterior pole of the globe.\nCut out the corneoscleral complex, with the outer border including the marked injection site. The stain should still be visible on the remaining part of the sclera.\nRemove the corpus vitreus and all layers attached to the inner side of the sclera by applying traction with tissue forceps.",
    "NOTE: Further steps depend on the following procedures being performed: 4.-DSC analysis, 5.-SHG microscopy.\n4. For Regional DSC Analysis\nFor the treated eye: cut out four scleral sectors from the remaining scleral cup with the scissors so that the site of the injection is located in the upper sector and aligned centrally. Cut the remaining 3 sectors from both lateral sides (i.e., nasal and temporal), and the bottom.\n\tNOTE: the numbering of the sectors (1-4) which are further divided into squares (1-16) is demonstrated in Figure 1A.\nCut the scleral sectors (1-4) into smaller squares (1-16) of approximately 4 x 4 mm each. Sector 1 should be divided into 9 squares (make the exact site of injection an individual square [square 2]). Divide sectors 2 and 3 into 2 squares each (squares 10-11 and 12-13) and sector 4 into 3 squares (squares 14-16).\nAssign a number to each square, as shown in Figure 1A, in order to localize the distance of the analyzed tissue from the location of the injected area.\nFor the control eye: after dividing the tissue into four scleral sectors (similar to the treated tissue) cut out square pieces of tissue from the following locations: 3 squares from the top sector (sector 1), 1 from each side (sectors 2 and 3), and 1 from the bottom sector (sector 4).\nScrape off the remaining retinal and choroidal layers and wash twice with fresh PBS each time, leaving the pieces submerged in solution for approximately 10 s at a time.\n5. For SHG Imaging\nCut the upper part of the sclera using scissors to create a 1 x 1 cm area with the site of injection aligned centrally.",
    "Scrape off the remaining retinal and choroid layers and wash twice with fresh PBS each time leaving the pieces in solution for approximately 10 s.\nPlace the tissue in 1 mL tubes filled with PBS solution for transportation to the imaging facility. All the procedures, following the incubation time and beginning with the dissection of the eyeball should be performed within an hour.\n6. Microscopy Protocol\nNOTE: This protocol for imaging back-scattered SHG signal from collagen of sclera tissue is tailored for the laser scanning microscope.\nMicroscopy set up\nTo maximize the signal and resolution when performing SHG microscopy use an objective lens optimize to transmit infrared light and with a high numerical aperture (NA). Our objective is Nikon Apo LWD 25x/NA1.1 water immersion.\nAdjust the correction collar of the lens to match the depth of the sample, in this case that is the thickness of the coverslip, 0.17 millimeters.\nMount the 25x objective lens and add a generous amount of lubricating water-based gel to cover the imaging surface before mounting the sample. The water-based gel will not evaporate during the experiment and hence will maintain image quality.\nPlace the scleral tissue from a 1 mL tube with PBS without drying between two 25-mm round coverslips (episcleral side down) providing maximal contact between the episclera and the coverslip surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The tissue can also be placed uncovered on the coverslip. A good amount of PBS should keep the tissue hydrated during imaging. In this case, add the tissue piece and the PBS after assembling the cellchamber.",
    "Assemble the cell chamber by placing a 25-mm round coverslip, single or in a sandwich technique, on the bottom part of the chamber and screw the top part down in order to create a sealed round chamber. Do not screw down tightly when a top coverslip is used, in order to avoid artificially flattening and damage the tissue.\nMount the cell chamber with the tissue sample on the microscope stage.\nSet the microscope for eye view with transmitted light on.\nPosition the stage and adjust the height of the objective such that the lower surface of the sample is in focus, as determined by bright field inspection through the eye piece.\nTurn off all lights except the computer monitor and block as much light from the monitor as possible with aluminum foil sheets draped on the microscope stage. Minimizing any stray light reaching the detectors will ensure low-noise acquisition, as the GaAsP NDD detectors have high sensitivity.\nIn the Ti Pad panel of the software, check that the lens definition is correct.\nIn the A1 Compact GUI panel, choose the IR laser for imaging, select the NDD detectors and choose the DAPI channel that is equipped with a 400-450 nm bandpass filter.\nIn the A1 MP GUI panel, set the wavelength of the infrared laser to 860 nm and open the shutter.\nSet laser scanning conditions in the A1 Compact GUI panel as follows. Select: (a) Galvano scanner, (b) Unidirectional scanning, (c) Pixel dwell time 6.2 µs, (d) Frame size 1,024 x 1,024 pixels, (e) Line averaging 2x",
    "NOTE: The Galvano scanner and unidirectional scanning ensures precise point by point alignment. A size of 1,024 x 1,024 for the full field of view translates into a pixel size of 0.5 μm /pixel. Line averaging will reduce the shot noise in the image.\nSet imaging conditions in A1 Compact GUI panel by adjusting laser power and detector gain. Open the Look Up Table panel (LUTs) that displays a histogram of pixel intensity values in the current image. Turn on live imaging in “Find” mode and maximize the detected range of pixel values by adjusting laser power and detector gain. Avoid saturation. Typical values are 2.5% laser power, from a total of 2.35 W at 860 nm, and 100 HV (detector gain).\nNOTE: For this setup, the laser power measured with an internal power meter is 5.2 mW. Every time an experiment is performed, re-adjust the laser percentage such that the internal power measurement is constant at 5.2 mW between imaging sessions. Care should be taken when setting laser power. The Chameleon II laser is a 3 W laser at 800 nm and a 10% or higher power could potentially induce tissue damage.\nImage acquisition\nIn preview mode, scan the tissue area using the XYZ Overview tool.\nSet the imaging to lower resolution (256 x 256 pixels and no line averaging) to speed up the acquisition of images in this mode.\nCapture 5 x 5, 3 x 3, or single fields of view to cover the entire surface of the tissue. At each location, before the overview capture, turn on the live \"Scan\" mode and bring the tissue into focus. Note that different regions of the tissue will have slightly different positions in the axial direction.",
    "Find a flat area where the collagen fibers are seen in the entire field of view and double-click that position in the overview tool to move the stage to that particular location.\nTurn on live \"Scan\" mode, adjust the Z position of the objective such that the bottom plane is in focus and, in the Ti Pad, use the Z drive to move the optical plane 10-15 μm above this bottom layer.\nAcquire an image at high resolution with 1,024 x 1,024 pixels and 2x line averaging, using the \"Capture\" button.\nSave the location in the XYZ Overview using the \"+\" button. This ensures that the same area of tissue is not recaptured.\nFor each piece of tissue capture 10 images of non-overlapping fields of view.\n7. DSC Protocol\nNote: Proceed to this step as soon as tissue preparation is complete, for regional DSC analysis, or after tissue imaging when SHGM is performed.\nPrepare DSC pans, weighed and labeled.\n\tNOTE: This step should be done before tissue dissection in order to minimize tissue desiccation.\nDry each scleral square with an absorbent tissue and lay it flat on the bottom of a DSC pan using toothed forceps.\nWeigh the pan with the tissue inside and lid crimped and covered to obtain the tissue wet weight (mass of the samples should be in the range of 5 to 11 mg).\n\tNote: Seal each pan using the crimper before proceeding to the next tissue sample. The pans are hermetically sealed, preventing any water loss prior to thermal analysis.\nOnce the sample is crimped, place it on its designated location on the DSC tray. There should be 6 samples for the control and 16 for the treated eye.",
    "Create a method using instrument managing software, specifying the weight of the tissue, and run the thermal analysis using the following parameters: Temperature range of 40 to 80 °C, Heating rate: 1 °C/min, Heat flow: 17.37 mW, Gas (N2) flow: 19.8 mL/min, Gas pressure: 2.2 bar.\nOnce completed, analyze the data for each sample by extracting the transition temperature peak at which thermal denaturation occurs using the instrument managing software.\n8. Image Analysis\nSHG Signal\nSelect at least 5-10 of the most representative images from each treatment and its control, such that the area of the image is occupied by mostly collagen fibers.\nUpload each image in ImageJ software and measure the average pixel intensity by selecting Analyze> Measure for the active image.\nThe values extracted are reported as the mean pixel intensity and can also be shown by plotting the histogram of intensities by selecting from the menu Analyze > Histogram.\nUsing an Excel sheet, create a table to document all measured data accordingly to the sample ID.\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensity for each treatment and control condition.\nUsing student's t-test, compare differences for all pairwise comparisons of concentrations (i.e., 40 mM SMG vs. 0 and 400 mM SMG vs. 0). [P≤0.05].\nWaviness\nSelect an image that displays collagen fibers. At least 10 images per sample should be analyzed (including a control sample for each concentration - at least 40 in total).\nOpen ImageJ>Plugins> NeuronJ. NeuronJ requires prior installation.\nUpload all imagesby dragging into an opened NeuronJ window.\nCreate tracing lines along the fibers, following the contour of the fibril with the mouse (pen drawing tablets could be used), click M to measure the distance of total fiber length.",
    "Select \"Option\" to draw a tangential straight line and connect the beginning and the end of the previously drawn fiber contour. Now click M to measure the end-to-end length.\nRepeat the same procedure on at least 10 fibrils per image.\nCollect those two measurements from each of 10 fibrils and input the data into an excel spreadsheet, expressing total fiber length (contour) and end-to-end length (straight connecting line) as Length [curve] and Length [linear], respectively.\nCalculate the waviness index (W) using the formula: W= Length [curve]/ Length [linear].\nCalculate the % of waviness comparing data from the images of treated samples(SMG) with the images from control samples using the formula: (W[SMG] - 1) / ( W[control] - 1 )\nPerform a pairwise t-test for waviness index (W) in order to determine statistical differences (p-values) of collagen fiber morphology between different treatment conditions and control.\nSubscription Required.
