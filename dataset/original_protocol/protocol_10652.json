    "1. Stencil Preparation\nPrepare a stencil on Parafilm to layout the location of each explant, following the desired geometry (Figures 1A and 1B). Space each explant approximately 1-2 mm apart. This distance corresponds to an ideal spacing for generating fiber alignment between explants. Attach the stencil underneath the area of the coverglass where the sample will be prepared with tape.\n2. Sterilization\nThoroughly clean all components of the bioreactor using 70% ethanol and sterilize for 2-3 hr under UV light prior to experimentation. If an alternative vessel is being used in lieu of a bioreactor then proper sterilization techniques should be used. See step 4.12 for comments on using a glass bottom Petri dish.\n3. Fibrin Gel Preparation\nAfter the components of the bioreactor have been sterilized, cast a thin layer of fibrin gel on the surface of the coverglass. Details for preparing fibrinogen and thrombin stock solutions for making 6.6 mg/ml fibrin gels are described in Sander et al.13 A similar protocol by Ye et al.19 for making 3.3 mg/ml fibrin gels can also be viewed on the JoVE website.\nPrepare a solution of fluorescent microbeads in DMEM at a concentration of 10 million beads/ml. The beads will be used to help track gel displacements. To achieve this concentration, combine 0.017 ml of microbead stock solution and 0.149 ml of DMEM into a microcentrifuge tube.\nSonicate this suspension for 10 min to disperse the beads and homogenize the solution.\nFibrin Solution — In a 15 ml c-tube, mix 0.22 ml of fibrinogen stock solution with 0.44 ml of 20 mM HEPES buffer. Add the 0.1667 ml of DMEM with microbeads created in step 3.1.",
    "Thrombin Solution — In a separate 15 ml c-tube, mix together 0.0328 ml of thrombin stock solution, 0.131 ml of 20 mM HEPES buffer, and 0.00246 ml of 2 M CaCl2.\nCarefully mix the thrombin solution (step 3.4) with the fibrinogen solution (step 3.3) by pipetting up and down 5-10x until the solution is evenly distributed. Avoid introducing bubbles as much as possible. To reduce the amount of bubbles produced, be careful not to fully discharge the pipette while mixing.\nThe addition of thrombin will cause the solution to gel quickly (~30 sec). Pipette the mixed solution onto the coverglass as soon as possible. Allow the gel to polymerize at RT.\nSeal up the bioreactor, insert the heating blocks, and connect the thermocouples to the temperature controller. Incubate the gel at 37 °C for 15-30 min.\n4. Cell Explant Preparation\nRemove medium from the T-75 flask containing the human dermal fibroblast cells.\nCarefully rinse the surface with approximately 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove serum proteins. Add 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 3 min, or until cells have lifted.\nAfter the cells have been lifted, spin the suspension down in a centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in a volume of DMEM that will allow a final concentration of 20 million cells/ml.\nWhile the cells are spinning down in the centrifuge disconnect the bioreactor from the heating blocks and the thermocouples. Transfer the bioreactor to a biosafety cabinet and carefully remove the lid following asceptic techniques.\nCreate explants by pipetting 0.3 µl of the cell suspension onto the polymerized fibrin gel, following the pattern on the stencil. Each explant should contain approximately 6,000 cells. Make sure that low volume micropipette tips are used (0.1-10 µl).",
    "Allow cells to settle and attach to the fibrin matrix for 1 hr at 37 °C.\nWith the bioreactor still open, add approximately 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.1% amphotericin B, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin directly into the bioreactor chamber. DMEM is bicarbonate buffered and requires 5% CO2 to maintain a neutral pH. Since the bioreactor is not supplied with CO2, condition the medium in an incubator with 5% CO2 for 2-3 hr before use. Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor that is widely used to reduce the rate of fibrin degradation20.\nReseal the bioreactor. Use a syringe to deliver an additional 5 ml of CO2 conditioned medium via the barbed fitting on the inlet port. Dispense the medium slowly and make sure the entire volume of the bioreactor chamber is filled. Carefully remove bubbles that form in the bioreactor.\nSupply fresh, 5% CO2 conditioned medium to the bioreactor throughout the experiment in order to maintain pH, supply nutrients, and remove waste products. Setup a syringe pump with a 10 ml or 30 ml syringe filled with 5% CO2 conditioned medium. Connect the syringe directly to the inlet port on the bioreactor lid with Luer-lock fitted sterile tubing. Remove the male fitting and attach the tubing to the barbed fitting on the bioreactor (see Figure 1C).\nSet the perfusion rate to 0.01 ml/min. Connect modified pieces of tubing to both outlet ports and place the ends into a 100 ml beaker to collect waste.\nUse a lab jack to set the heights of the inlet and outlet feeds so that a pressure differential does not develop in the bioreactor (consult Figure 1D for reference).",
    "If a bioreactor is not available, prepare samples in 35 mm glass bottom Petri dishes with glass tops. Use one with a coverslip size that is optimized for the specific set of objectives to be used. Samples that are prepared in Petri dishes should be maintained in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNote: Polystyrene depolarizes light and will interfere with DIC imaging, so glass tops should be used if DIC imaging will be conducted. Phase contrast is a suitable alternative imaging modality. Transferring dishes between the incubator and microscope will make image registration difficult. If images are not properly registered then the strain calculated in Section 6 will not be accurate.\n5. Time-lapse Imaging\nOnce the sample has been prepared, reseal the bioreactor, reconnect the heating blocks and the thermocouples, and set the bioreactor temperature to 37 °C.\nSet the bioreactor onto the microscope mounted motorized stage. Position the 20X DIC objective under the view-port. A lower magnification objective is acceptable, particularly if a precision motorized stage is not available. Ensure that the polarizer, analyzer, and prism are all in place. Alternatively, samples can also be imaged using phase contrast.\nOpen the imaging software.\nFocus the objective on the area between the three explants.\nSave the coordinates (x, y, and z) of this location in the imaging software.\nIn order to image the entire area between and around the explants select the option to acquire a large image and specify the size of the area. This will allow the acquisition of multiple images around the specified area and create a tiled image that represents a larger region of the sample.",
    "Set the exposure time and light intensity to the lowest values possible to avoid cell death caused by phototoxicity, while still providing sufficient resolution to discriminate between cells, microbeads, and fibrin fibers.\n6. Strain Tracking\nFor details and instructions on the strain tracking software (Figure 2) used see Raghupathy et al.21 The algorithm is a custom MATLAB code that can be downloaded from http://www.license.umn.edu/default.aspx[href=http://www.license.umn.edu/default.aspx]. Note that DIC images often have enough texture for strain tracking. The microbeads are included to serve as a check on the calculated strain fields. If strain tracking will be done it is critical that the images obtained are taken at the exact same location so that the images are registered. Unregistered images will produce spurious strains.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
