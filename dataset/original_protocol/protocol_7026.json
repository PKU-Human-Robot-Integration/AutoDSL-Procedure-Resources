    "Larval fillet preparation for obtaining intact lymph gland (LG)Whole LG preparations can be obtained for the first, second, and third instar larvae, as well as for pupae, using this method of dissection. Fly breeding and crosses were performed using standard protocols. Larvae were reared to the appropriate stage on standard cornmeal agar medium, under non saturating density. Figure 1A shows the relative size of the first, second, and third instar larvae.Using a fine paint brush, transfer the larvae to a cavity dish/Petri plate containing water, then rinse the larvae to get rid of any food particles.Transfer the larvae to a clean cavity dish and place on ice for 20-30 min to immobilize the larvae. Immobilization (optional) helps to pin the larvae (see Step A4).Place cooled larva with the dorsal side up on the Sylgard dish and view it through a stereomicroscope at magnification 4× (zoom range 0.8-4×), focusing on the dorsal cuticle. All subsequent steps are to be performed while viewing larval tissue under the microscope.Restrain larva by inserting insect pins firmly through it, near the anterior and the posterior spiracles, and through the Sylgard dish (Figure 1B). Add a drop of PBS (approximately 200 µl) to prevent the larva from desiccating.Using fine dissection scissors, make a small incision in the cuticle on the right side near the posterior end. Insert the scissors into the incision end and slit the cuticle laterally (Figure 1C and 1D).Lift the loose end of the cuticle with the help of fine forceps, extend it to the left side, and cut along the left lateral edge of the cuticle (Figure 1E).Carefully remove the viscera. Locate the LG that is attached to the brain lobes in the anterior region flanking the dorsal vessel, followed by rows of pericardial cells at the posterior end (Figure 1F).",
    "Side illumination with dual goose-neck light source can help distinguish the refringent LG.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4204/bioprotoc-11-21-4204-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of larval LG dissection. (A) Representative image of first, second, and third instar larvae. (B-F) Stepwise schematic representation of LG dissection from wandering third instar larvae. BL: brain lobes, VNC: ventral nerve cord, LG: lymph gland, and PC: pericardial cells. The number of pericardial cells may vary between LG lobes. Larvae and LG images are not depicted to scale but enlarged for clarity.Add a fresh drop of PBS and gently remove it to get rid of any tissue debris. Repeat if required.Replace PBS with 200 µl of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, see Recipes) and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Remove the fixative and wash three times with PBS. Carefully remove the pins, slowly lift the LG preparation (with the underlying ventral cuticle) from the posterior end, and transfer to a 96-well plate or a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for immunostaining or in situ procedures.Pupal fillet preparation for obtaining intact lymph gland (LG)Whole LG can be prepared from 0 to 20 h after pupa formation (APF). In our experience, most lobes histolyze by 15 h APF (Rodrigues et al., 2021).Place pupa on the Sylgard dish with the dorsal side facing up. All subsequent steps are to be performed while viewing the pupal tissue under the stereomicroscope.Insert a fine insect pin firmly near the anterior spiracle through the Sylgard dish (Figure 2A). Add a drop of PBS (approximately 200 µl) to prevent the pupa from desiccating.Using fine dissection scissors, cut horizontally along the posterior spiracles (Figure 2A).Insert the scissor into the incised end and make a slit laterally along the right side of the cuticle, followed by an incision along the anterior part as shown by the dotted lines (Figure 2B).",
    "Lift the loose end of the cuticle and carefully extend it to the left side, and cut along the left lateral edge of the cuticle along the dotted lines (Figure 2B).Carefully remove the visceral organs without damaging the LG (Figure 2C). The cardiac tube and pericardial cells are a good landmark to locate the remaining LG lobes (Figure 2D). Add a fresh drop of PBS to remove any tissue debris and repeat if required.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4204/bioprotoc-11-21-4204-g002.jpgFigure 2.

The number of pericardial cells may vary between LG lobes. Pupa and LG images are not depicted to scale but enlarged for clarity.Follow Step A9 onwards of larval LG dissection and proceed for immunostaining or in situ procedures.Neutral red staining of lymph gland (LG) for easier visualizationDissect and fix larval or pupal LG as described above. Wash thrice in PBS for 8-10 min each.Add 100 µl of 0.2% neutral red solution (0.2% neutral red in PBS) and incubate at room temperature for 5-7 min or till LG is visibly stained.Wash off neutral red with PBS. Brain lobes and LG lobes should be easily visible. First, second, and third instar, and pupal LG can be easily identified by neutral red staining (Figure 3A-3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4204/bioprotoc-11-21-4204-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "Scale bar: 100 μmImmunostaining of lymph gland (LG)All steps are performed by placing the 96-well dish on a flat-bed rocker.Wash 10-12 fixed LG preparations in a 96-well dish in 200 µl of PBS, three times for 10-15 min each.Add 200 µl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (0.1% PTX, see Recipes) as a permeabilizing agent to the LG preparations incubate for 15-20 min.Discard PTX and add 100 µl of 20% normal goat serum in PBS as a blocking agent for 30 min.Remove the blocking agent and add 40 µl of primary antibody at the desired concentration diluted in PBS (or blocking agent). Incubate at 4°C overnight.Remove the primary antibody and wash the LG preparations with PBS three times for 10-15 min each.Discard PBS, add 100 µl of 20% normal goat serum, and incubate for 30 min.Replace with 40 µl of secondary antibody (usually 1:400) in PBS and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.Remove secondary antibody and wash in 200 µl of PBS, three times for 10-15 min each. Proceed to the mounting step (see below, procedure section F).In situ hybridization of lymph gland (LG)Wash 15-20 fixed LG preparations in a microcentrifuge tube in 500 µl of PBS, three times for 10-15 min each.For long term storage, wash LG preparations in methanol four times and store in methanol at -20°C. To resume the experiment, rinse the samples once with a mixture of methanol and PBS (1:1) and three times in PBS.Wash LG preparations in 500 µl of 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (PBS-T), three times for 10-15 min each (see Recipes for 0.1% PBS-T).Equilibrate LG preparations in 500 µl of equal volumes of 0.1% PBS-T and hybridization buffer (HB) (see Recipes for hybridization buffer).Discard the PBS-T-HB solution and pre-incubate in 500 µl HB for 1 h at 65°C.",
    "Remove HB and replace with 200 µl HB with 1 µl of Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe (Dilution of the probe needs to be adjusted empirically depending on the probe concentration and level of expression of the gene of interest). Hybridize overnight at 65°C.Remove HB carefully and wash the LG preparations in 500-800 µl of HB for 1 h at 65°C.Wash LG preparations in 500-800 µl equal volumes of 0.1% PBS-T and HB for 30 min at 65°C, followed by three quick washes in 0.1% PBS-T at room temperature.Follow up with three washes in 0.1% PBS-T for 10 min each at room temp.Block non-specific binding with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or normal goat serum (NGS) in 0.1% PBS-T for 30 min.Incubate with anti-DIG antibody coupled to Alkaline Phosphatase diluted (1:1,000) in the blocking solution for 2 h at room temp.Remove the anti-DIG blocking solution mixture, followed by three quick rinses in 0.1% PBS-T. Then, wash in 0.1% PBS-T, three times for 10 min.Equilibrate for 10 min in 500 μl freshly prepared staining buffer (SB) (see Recipes).Visualize with NBT/BCIP in 1 ml SB (6.5 μl NBT + 3.5 μl BCIP) at room temperature or 37°C until staining is visible (Figure 4).Wash three times in PBS and mount the LG preparations as indicated (see below, procedure section F).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4204/bioprotoc-11-21-4204-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Mounted LG preparation shows expression of Latran as revealed by NBT/BCIP.Mounting intact lymph gland (LG)Place the fixed and stained larval fillet preparation in a coverslip bottom 35 mm Petri dish.",
    "These can also be made by punching a hole of 1 cm diameter in a 35 mm Petri dish and gluing a coverslip to the bottom of the dish (Figure 5). Add a small drop (10-20 µl) of 70% glycerol with DAPI (1:500) or mounting medium to prevent the samples from desiccating.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4204/bioprotoc-11-21-4204-g005.jpgFigure 5. LG preparations mounted in a 35 mm coverslip bottom dish. Seven third instar larval LG preparations stained with neutral red at a 35 mm coverslip bottom dish. Black dotted lines indicate LG lobes. LG: lymph gland, and PC: pericardial cells.Using a pair of forceps, hold the filleted cuticle at the anterior end. With another fine forceps, carefully detach the brain lobes from the rest of the cuticle. The LG is attached via the ring gland to the brain lobes and flanks the dorsal vessel (Figure 1F). This procedure will partially dislodge it from the cuticle.Next, using a pair of forceps, hold the cuticle at the posterior end and, with another forceps, carefully detach and slide the posterior part of the dorsal vessel along with the pericardial cells onto the coverslip. The tissue is very fragile, and the whole procedure must be done gently while viewing through a stereomicroscope.Once the LG is loosened from the anterior and the posterior ends, carefully move the LG away from the ventral cuticle. Do not directly lift or hold the LG. When moving the LG, grasp the brain lobes at the anterior end and the pericardial cells at the posterior end.Multiple lymph glands can be mounted in this way in a single dish (Figure 5) and can be subjected to high resolution imaging analysis."
