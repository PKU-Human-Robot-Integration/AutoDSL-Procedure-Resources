    "Set up equipment (Figure 1). Clean the light-dark chamber with 70% ethanol/water solution on all surface areas and wipe clean. Make sure doorway between light side and dark side is closed. Turn on houselight. Turn on shocker and adjust for pre-determined shock intensity (see below). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602180801_5196.jpgFigure 1. Example of a light-dark boxPlace mouse in light chamber of the light-dark box. Wait approximately 60 sec for mouse to acclimate to light side. Mice will freely explore the entire light side. Before opening the door, ensure the mouse is facing away from the door (at least 45°) and at least 5 cm from the door. This prevents impulsive entry upon door movement. Note that the door will make an audible click upon opening.Raise the door separating the dark side from the light side of the light-dark box. Start the timer to measure cross-over latency, defined as the duration after door opens for mouse to enter the dark side of the light-dark box. Crossover is defined by full body entry (including tail). Stop the timer when the mouse enters the dark side of the chamber. Note: Mice may enter halfway and dart back into the light side. This is more likely after repeated daily trials. Do not lower the door until the mouse has fully crossed over. Once the mouse has crossed over, lower the door. After repeated trials, most non-experimental mice (e.g., wild-type C57BL/6J with no manipulation) will reach criterion. Criterion typically consists of 300-600 sec in the light side without any crossover. The determination of the criterion is entirely dependent on the experiment. Once an animal has reached criterion it is manually removed from the light side (no footshock is given). It no longer undergoes additional testing and crossover latency is considered maximal for remaining sessions.",
    "After a specific amount of time in the dark side (see below), apply a single foot-shock to the grid floor. The amount of time and the shock intensity will determine (affect) cross-over latency in subsequent trials (see Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602180835_3717.jpgFigure 2. Hypothetical effects of varying delay to shock and shock intensity in the TDPA task. A. Increases in delay to shock (2 sec-10 min) reduce latency to crossover. B. Increases in shock intensity (0.0-1.6 mA) increase latency to crossover. Allow the mouse to remain in the dark chamber for 30 sec after the foot shock to associate the environment with the aversive stimulus, then remove mouse to home cage.All the urine and fecal boli must be removed from both sides of the chamber, and the chamber cleaned entirely with 70% ethanol to remove any residual smell from the first mouse. Afterwards, the next mouse may be submitted to the test.Repeat procedure until all mice have been tested.Repeat procedure each day for 5 daily sessions.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
