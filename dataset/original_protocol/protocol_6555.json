Save the GenBank (.gb) file cDNA transcripts to your computer using the appropriate naming convention (Figure 2).Species code _ approved gene name _ reference code.e.g., saha_CD200_ENSSHAT00000000104-201 (Ensembl).e.g., saha_CD200_X1_XM_023500980.1 (GenBank).See the species table below for appropriate species code.First two letters for the Latin genus and species.e.g., Tasmanian devil: Sarcophilus harrisii (saha).Ensembl uses three letter species codes (sha), but we recommend the four letter code (saha).Ensembl codes start with ENS, then the species code, then either G for gene or T for transcript.e.g., ENSSHAG00000000091e.g., ENSSHAT00000000104An NCBI account can be created to save your transcripts online.The FASTA (.fa or .fasta) sequences are also ok, but the GenBank (.gb) have additional useful information.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701190556_8977.jpgFigure 2.

    ", conserved signal peptide and transmembrane domainDesign expression vectorChoose an expression vector (aka plasmid) for the gene.Here we will demonstrate the process by inserting the Tasmanian devil CD200 analyzed above into our pAF164 vector. The FAST protein vectors were constructed using Sleeping Beauty plasmids available from Addgene and the Erik Kowarz lab[href=https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/9749/] (Kowarz et al., 2015). We will cut the saha_TNFRSF9_ XM_003765221.2-ECD DNA sequence out of the pAF164 vector using restriction enzymes, and then use Gibson Assembly (e.g., NEBuilder) to insert the saha_CD200_X1_XM_023500980.1-SigP-ECD.***Critical step***If you are making a soluble protein, then you need to include only the coding region for the SigP and ECD of your protein (e.g., SigP-ECD) into your expression vector.If you are making a full-length cell surface protein, then you want to include the whole ORF for your gene (e.g., SigP-ECD-TMD-ICD) in your expression vector but make sure to remove the stop codon at the end of the ORF so that the ORF continues to the 3'-end of the fluorescent protein coding sequence. In SnapGene, set the origin of the plasmid to the first base at the 5'-end of the ORI. This creates a standard reference point for all the plasmids in our library.Open the SnapGene file and place the cursor between the first base of the 5’ ORI and the base directly preceding the 5’ base.View → Set origin.Find the location of the coding sequence to be replaced (TNFRSF9-SigP-ECD) (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191339_3973.jpgFigure 9.

We often use the hamster interleukin 2 (mau_IL2_NM_001281629) SigP because we produce our proteins using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, so the hamster SigP works well. The SigP of the protein is usually cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum by a signal peptidase, and thus is generally not included in the mature secreted protein and should not alter downstream function. Basically, a strong SigP will yield a higher protein concentration at the end of this process.mau_IL2_NM_001281629_SigP DNA: atgtacagcatgcagctcgcatcctgtcttgcactgacgctcgcactccttgtcagcagtmau_IL2_NM_001281629_SigP protein: MYSMQLASCLALTLALLVSSimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191415_8208.jpgFigure 11.

If you GOI does not have a SigP, then you might consider using the SigP from a different gene. We usually use the hamster IL-2 SigP because it works well in the CHO cells that we use for producing soluble proteins.Switch back to the pAF164 plasmid file.Rename the file so you do not destroy the previous file.pAF176_OFP is the devil CD200-mOrange FAST proteinPaste the copied saha_CD200_X1_XM_023500980.",

New CD200 expression vector (pAF176). The POI is highlighted in blue. Note that the stop codon at the 3'-end of the fluorescent protein should be the only in-frame stop codon in the entire ORF (5'-end SigP to the 3'-end of mOrange).Update the pAF176_ORF feature to run from the ATG start codon at the start of the SigP to the TAG stop codon at the end of mOrange (Figure 13).For pAF176 with saha_CD200_X1_XM_023500980.1 fused to mOrange, the exact DNA locations should be 4246 to 5745. This should yield a 1497 bp ORF and a 690 amino acid protein. Note that the number of base pairs in an ORF should always be divisible by three because each amino acid requires a three base pair codon. If your ORF is not divisible by three, then the protein might be out-of-frame and will not produce the correct protein.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191451_3075.jpgFigure 13. Update ORF to match the ATG start codon for the newly inserted geneExamine the updated pAF176 sequence to make sure the complete ORF is in frame. For example, the ORF for the saha_CD200_X1_XM_023500980.1 mOrange FAST protein N-terminus (i.e., CD200 start) should have MELQV (Figure 14) and the C-terminus (i.e., mOrange end) should have DELYK*. The '*' indicates the stop codon.***Critical step: Make sure there are no early stop codons in your sequence. This can arise by including the ICD of your GOI in the construct, which will result in the linker and fluorescent reporter protein not being translated.***imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191510_8048.jpgFigure 14. N-terminus of the new ORF. If you are using Tasmanian devil CD200, then make sure that the N-terminus matches the MELQV amino acid sequence shown here.",
    "If you have inserted a different gene, the sequence will be different, but the start location should be the same (position 4246 if you have “Set origin” correctly in Step B2b).At this point you have a full in silico plasmid construct. Next, we need to develop a method to get the actual DNA for our GOI into this construct. There are two options. The first and easiest method is to order a synthetic double stranded DNA block (e.g., gBlock) from a commercial supplier (e.g., IDT DNA). If you are confident that you know the exact sequence for your GOI, then we recommend this option. If you are not 100% confident about your DNA sequence, then it might be better to use PCR to amplify your GOI. Both methods require that the DNA sequence to be inserted into the expression vector has at least 20 bp overlaps with the insertion site in the expression vector. In the supplied pAF164 vector, we have annotated the overlap regions as \"Gibson_5'_overlap\" and \"Gibson_3'_overlap\". The pAF176 vector that contains the devil CD200 sequence is available from the authors of this protocol if you want to use it to practice replicating a working construct before embarking on your own sequences.gBlock method: Highlight the Gibson_5'_overlap + SigP + ECD + Gibson_3'_overlap and create a new feature called pAF176_gBlock.The gBlock should be 778 bp for this example.PCR method: Create a forward and reverse primer to amplify the insert from cDNA from your species (Figure 15).The primers will contain 18-30 bases that match the 5'-end of your GOI. The annealing (i.e., melting) temperature for the match to your GOI should be at least 55 °C. For the pAF176 construct, the match to saha_CD200_X1_XM_023500980.1 can be 21 bp (~57 °C): atggagctgcaagtacatgag.",
    "The primers also need to contain extensions to add the vector overlap regions during each cycle of PCR amplification.Use the cursor to highlight the 5'-end of the Gibson_5'_overlap through the end of your intended match for your GOI primer (59 bp total): gtgaaaactaccccaagctggcctctgcggccgccaccatggagctgcaagtacatgag.Note that the general principles of primer design should be adhered to, but we find that most primers will work on the first try. We try to have our primers end in a C or G and avoid having the primer end in duplicates (e.g., GG or CC) or triplicates, but these are acceptable if the GOI has long repeats and there is no other option.Repeat steps i-iv for constructing the reverse primer for the 3’-end of your GOI.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191533_8217.jpgFigure 15. Gibson assembly primers. Forward primer for amplifying GOI, flanking the region and providing sequence overlap with the vector backbone.Order the gBlock or primers from a commercial supplier and proceed to Procedure C.Assemble the expression vectorNotes: We will essentially use the Gibson Assembly process (Gibson et al., 2009), but we generally use the NEBuilder kit.The full set of primers, gBlocks, and plasmids are available in the supplementary material from the publication associated with this protocol (Flies et al., 2020).Prepare the DNA insert for assembly into the expression vector using Gibson assemblyexp_ID_1: Insert_PCR tab in the (experiments spreadsheet[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200426/Experiments spreadsheet.xlsx])Before opening the vials containing gBlocks or primers, spin the vials at 10,000 x g for one minute to ensure all lyophilized DNA is at the bottom of the vial.Dilute the gBlock and/or primers to 100 μM in sterile deionized distilled water (ddH2O). TE buffer can also be used, but ddH2O has worked well for us.If you are inserting a gBlock into the expression vector, then skip to Step C14.Perform touchdown PCR to amplify and extend your target GOI.",
    "The extension primers will have a low annealing temperature (~60 °C) during the initial amplification because only about ~50% of the primers bind to the target DNA (Figure 16). After the target DNA has been amplified the primer annealing temperature will be higher (e.g., 68 °C). To account for the potential trade-off between target specificity and the difficulty of amplifying rare target transcripts we use a touchdown PCR. We start at a high annealing temperature and decrease the temperature by 1 °C for each of the first ten cycles. Then we run an additional 25-35 cycles at a higher annealing temperature to increase specificity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191608_4767.jpgFigure 16. Overlap extension PCR to add the 5’ and 3’ overlaps onto the GOI for assembly into the expression vectorSet up PCR reaction using high-fidelity polymerase. We use New England Biolabs Q5® Hot Start High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix.While the PCR is running pour a 1% TAE agarose gel with nucleic acid stain.When the PCR is finished, dilute 20 μl of reaction mix with gel loading buffer.Add ~20 μl of reaction + bromophenol blue gel loading buffer to the appropriate lanes on the gel.Note: You will need a deep well to add a 20 μl volume, but it is good to use as much DNA as possible because DNA recovery from gels can be low. Run for ~30 min at 100 V in 1x TAE buffer.Visualize the gel on a blue light transilluminator.If a blue light transilluminator is not available, a UV light source can be used. Care should be taken to limit DNA exposure to UV light as this can damage DNA and be a considerable source of downstream cloning problems. Use a sterile razor blade or plastic cutting instrument to cut around the target DNA band.",
    "Make sure not to cut directly on the glass of your UV/blue light as this can damage the glass. Use a new blade for each band to prevent carry over of DNA between samples.Purify the DNA using a commercially available DNA gel purification kit.Quantify the DNA on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer using the A280 DNA setting.Dilute the DNA to 10 ng/μl using TE and store the DNA at -20 °C until needed.Prepare the plasmid DNA for assembly into the expression vectorexp_ID_2: Plasmid_Digest (experiments spreadsheet[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200426/Experiments spreadsheet.xlsx])Thaw plasmid pAF137 (or other vector as needed) and store on ice.Thaw restriction enzymes on ice (e.g., NotI-HF, SmaI).Note: XmaI and SmaI both have the same recognition site, but SmaI yields a blunt cut and is thus less likely to re-anneal during the Gibson assembly process. Mix the DNA and restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer’s instructions.***Critical step: Incomplete digests are a major source of downstream issues so ensuring a clean digest is critical.***After we have confirmed a clean cut by using the digest in a successful assembly, we keep the digest and reuse for future assemblies.Option 1: Prepare a 1% agarose gel with nucleic acid stain capable of holding 60 μl of reaction mix + bromophenol blue loading buffer. We generally accomplish this by placing a piece of tape between two of the teeth in the comb when setting the gel.Option 2: Use 2-4 wells to load the entire 60 μl volume. You will have to cut several bands from the gel instead of one band if you use option 2.Add the digested DNA to gel. Always include undigested plasmid as a control and a DNA ladder to estimate the size of bands.Run for ~30 min at 100 V in 1x TAE buffer.Visualize the gel on a blue light transilluminator (Figure 17).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701191725_8202.jpgFigure 17.",

Either set a microfuge heat block for 42 °C or prepare a water bath at 42 °C. We have achieved more consistent results using a water bath. If a water bath is not available, you can use any liquid container, fill it with warm water and adjust the temperature to 42 °C immediately prior to the heat shock step.Transfer the bacteria vials from the ice to 42 °C for 30 s.Transfer back to ice for at least two min.Add 950 μl of SOC media to each tube.Close the tubes tightly.Transfer tubes to an orbital shaker, set to at least 180 rpm.

Mixing two colonies will lead to failure. Also, the colony might have to be used to start a new culture if other problems arise, so leave enough bacteria in the colony to inoculate a new culture.Try not to get agar on the tip, as too much can overload the PCR. Even a single bacterium should have enough DNA for the PCR. Insert the pipet tip with the bacteria into the appropriate “bacteria tube” that contains 10 μl of sterile PBS. Pipet up-and-down several times and drag the tip around the tube to ensure that some of the bacteria remain in the PBS and some of the bacteria remain on the tip. These tubes are the bacterial stock for seeding an overnight culture if the colony PCR yields positive results.Directly transfer the tip with the bacteria to appropriate colony PCR tube. Pipet up-and-down several times and drag the tip around the tube to ensure that some bacteria are transferred into the colony PCR tube.Discard the tip into bleach and repeat for each additional colony.Run the PCR reaction for 30-35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55 °C.

For example, in Australia there are many Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) collection points where DNA with sequencing primers can be dropped off. Sequencing results are usually returned within 1-2 days. If your institution has a DNA sequencing machine, contact the manager of the machine to get the correct protocol and advice.

The Sleeping Beauty transposon system (learn more at https://blog.addgene.org/sleeping-beauty-awakens-for-genome-engineering[href=https://blog.addgene.",
    "org/sleeping-beauty-awakens-for-genome-engineering]) within the FAST protein vector should be effective in many different cell lines, but considerations should be made when selecting a cell line to make your protein. The all-in-one vector contains the transposon cassette (i.e., the POI to be expressed in the cell line) and the transposase (i.e., the enzyme that inserts the cargo into the genome of the cell), so you only need to transfect one plasmid rather than separate plasmids for the transposon and transposase. Once inside the cell, the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) will drive high expression of the transposase enzyme. The transposase enzyme then binds the inverted terminal repeats of the transposon cassette and cuts the cassette out of the plasmid. The remaining plasmid DNA is then degraded. The cassette is inserted between 'TA' dinucleotides in the host cell genome, so the insertion site could be almost anywhere, and multiple copies can be integrated into a single cell. Excess transposase should be degraded over time as part of the normal cell regulatory processes.  Cassettes that successfully integrate into the genome are permanently integrated. As the insertion site can be anywhere in the genome that contains a 'TA' dinucleotide, the insertion site could affect cell function. For example, if the cassette inserts into the coding region of a host cell gene that is critical for cell division, the host cell will no longer divide and should eventually die. Alternatively, the cassette could insert into an inactive region of the genome (e.g., highly methylated), which could lead to reduced expression of the POI. However, we have performed RNAseq on a few of our Sleeping Beauty cell lines, and the transcript for the GOI is generally among the most highly expressed transcripts in the cell (i.e., the cells are making a lot of this RNA).",
    "We use CHO cells for making most of our secreted proteins. We also use CHO cells for initial testing of cell surface proteins because these cells are reported to not express Fc receptors, which could bind to FAST proteins with a Fc region and to secondary antibodies in downstream experiments. CHO cells are used to make most proteins for clinical use and yield protein glycosylation patterns similar to other mammalian cell lines (Zerbino et al., 2018). A basic adherent CHO-K1 cell line can be used for all aspects of this protein production. We have switched to a suspension ExpiCHO cell line that can be grown at high density (5 x 106 cells/ml) in protein-free media. We suggest starting with a low passage CHO-K1 cell line to keep things simple and cheap.  When you move into functional testing of your proteins you will likely want to use a cell line from your study species. We have made dozens of devil facial tumor cell lines using this system. We have also transfected human (e.g., HEK-293, K562) and dog (A-72, DH82) cell lines. A similar Sleeping Beauty system has been used to make chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) for human clinical trials, so the system should work for immune cells, however we have not attempted this yet.  After a quick batch of protein, you can collect the culture supernatant for 3-7 days after transfection and use it to test your protein. A good yield of protein will require high transfection efficiency (i.e., at least half of the cells in the flask have the transposon cassette integrated into the genome). Your GOI and subsequent POI can be expressed directly from the plasmid if it fails to integrate into the genome. However, the non-integrated plasmid DNA will be degraded within a few days.",
    "We generally create stable cell lines instead of collecting protein from the initial transfection. Unless your transfection is 100% efficient, which is very unlikely, you will need to either sort your cells or use drug selection to make a stable cell line. Sorting cells based on the fluorescent protein expression is fast because the sort can be done the next day, but we have observed high cell death when we sort cells soon after the transfection. Thus, we add a high concentration of a selection drug (e.g., hygromycin) as soon as the fluorescent reporter is visible by microscopy or by taking an aliquot of your cells and running them through a flow cytometer. We have used hygromycin, geneticin (G418), blastomycin, and puromycin for selection. All of these selection drugs work, but we have found that the hygromycin selection is fast and complete. As many of these drugs kill cells by damaging DNA, expression of your drug resistance gene needs to be high to avoid unnecessary DNA damage. This is critical if you are making a cell line for functional testing.  We use polyethyleneimine (PEI) at a 3:1 ratio with DNA (3 μg PEI for each 1 μg DNA) for most of our transfections. It is among the cheapest of transfection reagents, can be freeze/thawed many times, and can be stored for long periods of time at -20 °C. Our transfection efficiency is generally 5-30%, which is considered low by some standards, but the rapid proliferation of the CHO cells allows us to develop a fully selected cell line within 5-10 days in most cases. Prepare the PEI transfection reagent using the heat method (see manufacturer for alternatives)Protocol from Polysciences Inc.

Whilst thawing, label a microfuge tube for each plasmid.Prepare a master mix of PEI in PBS at 60 μg/ml in a microfuge tube (or 15 ml tube for larger transfections).Make 1.2x the total amount needed to ensure there is enough master mix.

Incubate the cells with transfection reagents in cRF10 for 3-24 h.Day 4: Drug selection and monitoring Replace the media with 2 ml of warm cRF10 the next morning. If toxicity is a problem, then change the media after 3-6 h.Examine the cells using a fluorescent microscope or via flow cytometry to determine transfection efficiency.If your plasmids do not contain a fluorescent reporter, then include a standard fluorescent protein vector (e.g., GFP) as a positive control to help monitor transfection success.For flow cytometry, we often collect the floating cells and run through the flow cytometer. This will consist mainly of dead cells but should provide a yes/no answer as to whether the transfection was successful.Add selection reagent (i.e., hygromycin at 800 μg/ml) as soon as the reporter is visible or after 24 h.Monitor daily and record fluorescence and confluence.Massive cell death should occur within 1-3 days if using a high dose of hygromycin. Remove the floating cells every other day and replace with fresh cRF10 with 800 μg/ml of hygromycin.Small colonies of cells should start forming in 2-5 days.Allow dividing colonies to reach at least 20 cells before using TrypLE to detach the cells.When the cells are actively proliferating in high dose hygromycin, then passage the cells using TrypLE as described above in the Day 2 steps.When all cells express the reporter protein (i.e.",
    ", drug selection is complete), or when all cells appear healthy in the flask, then the hygromycin dose can be dropped to 100-200 μg/ml.Expand the cells and freeze.3-5 vials are enough unless you will be using these cells regularly.For cells secreting recombinant proteins, we generally purify one large batch of proteins that lasts for several years.Note: If your vector was used to make surface protein or other non-secreted protein, then you can skip the remainder of Part D. Make sure to freeze at least two vials of cells at a minimum of 1 x 106 cells at -80 °C.Days 10-18: Collect supernatant for testing Passage cells to a low density (1 x 105 cells/ml) in cRF5 in T75 flasks.The selection drug can be omitted at this step as long as you have a frozen stock in the freezer.We have maintained Sleeping Beauty-transfected cells without ongoing drug selection for 3 months and observed minimal decrease in the expression of target proteins.Allow cells to proliferate to > 90% confluence.Collect supernatant.Centrifuge at > 3,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Collect the supernatant and use a 20 ml syringe with a 0.22 μm PVDF filter to remove cellular debris.Store the supernatant at 4 °C and use within 28 days.We have observed that some FAST proteins are still capable of binding their expected receptor after 2 months in supernatant at 4 °C. However, protein stability is variable, so it is best to test the protein immediately after collection of supernatant. Adapt cells to protein-free media to produce high quantities of pure proteinCells can be used from the steps above or thawed from a frozen vial.Ensure the cells are fully-drug selected and cultured in cRF5.Ongoing drug selection is optional at this point. We generally maintain a low concentration of drug (e.g.",
    ", 100 μg/ml of hygromycin).When cells are in log-phase proliferation and 30-50% confluence, remove half of the cRF5 from the flask and replace with warm CHO EX-CELL protein free media.Any protein-free CHO cell specific media should work here, but we have had good results with CHO EX-CELL media. Note that this CHO EX-CELL media requires addition of 4x the amount of L-glutamine than for RPMI.Alternatively, proteins can be purified from cRF5 supernatant. The HisTrap columns should purify only the His-tagged proteins, with minimal carryover of the FBS components (e.g., bovine serum albumin). Ensure the drug used for selection of the cell line (e.g., hygromycin) does not contain a His-tag.Repeat Step D61 except replace all the media with CHO EX-CELL protein-free media.There is often a decrease in cell viability at this stage. Ensure that you have a large batch of cells with greater than 90% viability to continue.If you are using a suspension culture system, such as a spinner flask or propeller flask, then you will need to seed the cells at a high density (minimum of 5 x 105 cells/ml).Collect supernatant from this point forward.Centrifuge supernatant and store at 4 °C as described above.Filtration can be omitted here; the purified proteins will be filtered later.Expand the cells into 3 x T175 flasks by seeding 5 x 106 cells/flask with 30 ml of CHO EX-CELL media.Allow the cells to proliferate to ~80% confluence.***Critical step: Do not let the cells exceed 80% confluence, as they need to be rapidly proliferating at all times following transfer to protein-free media.*** Continue passaging cells until at least 200 ml of supernatant has been collected.Note: Cell lines do not always adapt well to the protein-free media. If you have repeated problems expanding the cell line, then you might want to purify the proteins from cRF2.",
    "5 media instead of protein-free media. Centrifuge all supernatant and store at 4 °C.Purify protein within 24 h to minimize aberrant protein aggregation and degradation. Many proteins will be stable for longer periods of time, but the best practice is to purify the proteins soon after collection.Protein purificationThe six histidine residues (6xHis) included in the linker peptide between the POI and the fluorescent reporter in the FAST protein allows for easy purification of protein secreted from eukaryotic cells. The basic protocol is to centrifuge your supernatant to remove debris, then use a peristaltic pump to apply your supernatant to an affinity column. The 6xHis-tag binds to Ni2+ ions in the column, and the proteins are then eluted using high concentration of imidazole, which competes with the 6xHis for binding to Ni2+ ions.  Most medium and large institutions will likely have a protein purification system available. We suggest asking around to see what you can find. Otherwise, a basic peristaltic pump will suffice. Plastic tubing can be found a home improvement or home brewing shop. The connector parts for the purification should come with the protein columns that you purchase. Determine what speed on the pump is required for a flow rate of 1 ml/min. You can do this by placing the output tubing into a graduated cylinder and measuring how long it takes to run 10 ml of water through the column. Adjust the pump and repeat as many times as needed until you are confident that you have an accurate flow rate. Note that when the column is connected the flow rate can vary slightly. Also determine the volume of liquid that your tubing holds from intake to output. This helps with the elution step, so you don't collect unnecessary flow through into your protein collection tubes.",
    "After you calibrate the flow rate to 1 mL/minute, then plug the pump into a simple electrical outlet timer, which will allow you to walk away while you run large supernatant volumes through the column.  The manufacturer's protocol for HisTrap excel columns is currently found here[href=https://www.gelifesciences.com/en/au/shop/chromatography/prepacked-columns/affinity-tagged-protein/histrap-excel-p-00310].Prepare all necessary solutions listed in the Recipes spreadsheet[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200426/Recipes spreadsheet.xlsx].5 M imidazole.HisTrap excel equilibration buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4).If several purifications are planned, then prepare a 10x HisTrap excel equilibration buffer.

Dilute your supernatant 1:1 (v/v) with equilibration buffer. The pH should now be ~7. If the pH is not between 6 and 8, then adjust with a weak acid or base.Place the output tubing into a waste collection vessel.If the tubing in the pump or your protein purification machine has not been used for several weeks or was not cleaned properly after its last use, then wash the tubing with 1 M NaOH. Set the pump to draw the NaOH solution into the tubing.",
    "After running enough NaOH solution into the tube to fill the tubing, you can stop the pump and let it soak for 1-24 h. Then empty the tube out and rinse with sterile water.Note: Make sure all of the NaOH is removed from the tubing before using it for protein purification. Fill the pump tubing with sterile ddH2O.Note: Make sure the tubing intake is completely submerged in all solutions throughout this process; air bubbles in the tubing or column can ruin your purification and protein. Remove the stopper plug from the top of your column.Set the pump to run at a low flow rate (< 1 ml/min) and allow the ddH2O to drip onto the intake port on top of the column to force out the air. A small volume of the ddH2O should overflow the column as this helps to ensure there is no air in the intake port.Stop the pump.Twist the tubing connector into the column, making sure there is no air trapped in the column.***Critical step: Ensure that no air bubbles enter the column.*** Remove the snap-off end of the column outlet.Transfer the intake tubing into the equilibration buffer.Equilibrate the column with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer at 1 mL/minute.Stop the pump.Note: Be gentle with the tubing so that air does not enter the tubing during the transfer. Submerge the intake tubing to the bottom of your sample vessel.Note: If the sample is in a graduated cylinder (make sure it is clean), then you will know precisely your sample volume and can set the timer accordingly. Transfer the output tubing into a clean \"flow through\" collection vessel. If for some reason your purification fails, then you can re-run the flow through to salvage the protein.",
    "Set the timer to run ~80% of the sample volume through the column.Start the pump.Start the timer.Make sure you monitor the tube during the transition from equilibration buffer to the sample. If you observe bubbles in the tubing, then disconnect the tubing from the column and allow the bubble to be forced out. Then re-connect the tubing and column using the \"drop-to-drop\" method described above.Make sure to monitor the pump as the timer approaches its stopping point. If your flow rate was faster than expected, then you could end up sucking air into the column and ruining your protein.Re-start the pump if you have sample left in your vessel and let it run until your sample is nearly gone. It is better to leave a few mL of your sample in the vessel than to try to get every drop and risk introducing air into the column.Stop the pump.Submerge the intake tubing into the wash buffer vessel.Start the pump.Run 20 column volumes of wash buffer through the column.Stop the pump.Submerge the intake tubing into the 0.5 M imidazole elution buffer.Start the pump and run several mL into the flow through container.Note: The volume to run into the flow through is determined by the volume that your tubing holds (i.e., a long tube needs more solution to flow through it to clear the tube). Transfer the output tubing into your first protein collection microtube and collect ~1 ml.Repeat this until you have collected at least 10 ml and are confident that all of your protein has been eluted.Check the protein collection tubes.Note: If you are purifying a FAST protein, then you simply place your tubes on a blue light and see if they fluoresce (Figure 19).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701192553_9282.jpgFigure 19.

Columns can be stored for several months (potentially years) until you need to re-use it.",
    "It is best to use a different column for each different protein, but with proper elution and washing of the columns you should be able to use the same column for different proteins if you are on a limited budget. Re-using a column for a different protein should be reported in experimental methods.At this point your tubing should be clean. You can connect the intake tubing to the output tubing to create a circular system. If you are confident that your tubing will not leak, then you can store it with ethanol inside for a day or two or rinse with water for long term storage.Protein dialysis Prepare 3 L of autoclaved PBS.Store the PBS on ice or at 4 °C until the PBS is cold.Wet your dialysis cassettes with cold, sterile PBS.Transfer your PBS to a clean 1 L beaker.Drop a sterile magnetic stir bar into your PBS cover with aluminum foil and store the beaker on ice or at 4 °C.Combine the solutions from your protein collection tubes that contain a reasonable yield of your POI. Basically, if there is no protein in some of the tubes, then you don't need them.Transfer your combined protein solution into the dialysis cassette.Float the cassette in the cold PBS.Place the container on a magnetic stirrer in a refrigerator or cold room.Set the magnetic stirrer to a low rpm, just enough so that the PBS is clearly moving in a circular motion around the container.Stir for at least one hour; overnight is OK as long as the temperature is 4 °C.Transfer the cassette to a new beaker with fresh, cold PBS.Stir again for at least one hour.Protein filtration and aliquoting***Critical step: Perform these steps in sterile laminar flow biosafety cabinet (BSC).",
    "The centrifugation steps will take place outside the laminar flow BSC, but the tubes should always remain closed when outside of the BSC.***Place a sterile 50 ml collection tube in a sturdy rack in the BSC.Remove the plunger from a 20 ml syringe in the BSC.Connect a 0.22 μm PVDF filter to a 20 ml syringe filter.Note: Be careful not to touch the outlet of the filter, as the bottom half of the filter needs to remain sterile. Add ~5 ml of cold, sterile PBS into the syringe to pre-wet the filter.Pipet your dialyzed protein into the PBS within the syringe.Place the plunger back into the syringe and gently expel the solution through the filter into the 50 ml collection tube.Note: Some residual liquid will be retained in the filter, resulting in reduced protein recovery. Flushing the filter with additional PBS can reduce protein loss. Transfer the sterile protein solution into a protein spin filter unit (e.g., Amicon ultra).We generally use an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units, Ultra-15, MWCO 10 kDa. Most fluorescent proteins are > 20 kDa and our POIs are also generally > 20 kDa, so a large cut-off weight is acceptable without a risk of losing the purified protein. However, our proteins are produced in cell culture using protein free media, and His-tag purified, so using a 10 kDa cut off should result in minimal protein loss and > 90% pure protein.Add cold, sterile PBS to fill the spin filter to full capacity (15 ml).Centrifuge the unit according to the manufacturer's instructions.Ensure the solution remains cold at all times.30 min at 3,000 x g should result in concentration of the solution from a ~15 ml volume to < 3 ml.Top up to 15 ml again with cold, sterile PBS for a second wash.",
    "Centrifuge for 30 min at 3,000 x g.Place the unit back into the sterile BSC.Highly concentrated FAST proteins should be visible even with only visible light excitation at this step (Figure 20).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701192621_3203.jpgFigure 20. Concentrated FAST proteins. Image of FAST proteins in centrifugal concentration tubes. Highly concentrated FAST proteins can be seen even using visible light. From left to right are mCherry, mCitrine, mOrange, and mCherry.Transfer the concentrated protein to a microfuge tube placed on ice.Measure the protein concentration as described above in Procedure D–Protein Purification.Blank with cold PBS this time instead of elution buffer.Enter the exact extinction coefficients determined in Section A, step 9b into the spectrophotometer.Record absorbance ratios.If the concentration is too low, centrifuge the filter unit again to achieve a smaller volume. Then take another aliquot and measure.Repeat until the protein concentration is at least 0.5 mg/ml.Concentration should be in the 0.5 mg/ml to 2.0 mg/ml range to ensure the spectrophotometer is accurate.Optional step: Dilute your protein to 1 mg/ml or 0.5 mg/ml with cold, sterile PBS. This makes for easy calculations for downstream experiments.Aliquot your protein into sterile 1.5 ml snap cap microfuge tubes and store on ice.10 μl/tube is ideal, as you can thaw a fresh batch each time you need the protein.If storage space in -80 °C freezer is limited, then you can aliquot 50-100 μl/tube.Label your tubes with the protein name, date, and concentration.Freeze at -80 °C until needed.If you will use the protein within the next week, you can store an aliquot at 4 °C.Most of our proteins seems to tolerate a few freeze/thaw cycles, but it is best to thaw only once and use the entire aliquot.Test the recombinant proteinThere are many ways to test your protein.",
    "SDS-PAGE and western blots can be used to confirm protein size and epitopes and detailed protocols are available elsewhere (Consortium, 2018). However, if the ultimate goal is to determine receptor-ligand interactions and the protein has been well-studied in other species, then proceeding directly production of a cell line that expresses the receptor to test binding via flow cytometry can be the most efficient approach. This is the approach we will describe here in Procedure E.  If your protein is likely to have a functional effect on certain cell types, then functional testing is also a good option. For example, if you made a recombinant interferon-gamma cytokine, then you could treat primary cells or cell lines from your species of interest with a range of doses and assess MHC-I and PD-L1 upregulation via qPCR. This should give you an answer within one week on whether or not your protein is functional. Additionally, check the products available from commercial suppliers of human and mouse recombinant proteins. In many cases you can attempt to replicate their validation methods for your species.  If you made an expression vector for the receptor (e.g., CD200R1) for your soluble POI (e.g., CD200), then proceed with Procedure E. If you have not made a cell line with you target receptor yet, then repeat Procedures A-D, with the exception that when you design your insert you will need to keep the TMD and ICD of your target receptor GOI/POI.Flow cytometry to test receptor-ligand interactionexp_ID_7: Flow_Cytometry (experiments spreadsheet[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200426/Experiments spreadsheet.xlsx])Purpose:To test the binding of FAST proteins to cell lines transfected with receptors expected to bind to the POI (e.g., CD200-mOrange or CD200-mTagBFP bind to CHO.CD200 cell lines).Overview:A single-step assay that adds FAST proteins to live target cells.",
    "The soluble protein can bind the surface receptor and remain on the surface of the cell or enter the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lysosomal degradation of the captured protein is blocked via the use of chloroquine or ammonium chloride, which allows fluorescent signal to accumulate over time and yield a stronger signal. The cells are washed a single time prior to analysis via flow cytometry.Note: If you only have a single FAST protein (e.g., CD200-mOrange), then you won't have a proper negative control (e.g., mOrange only). However, by testing the single FAST protein against several cell lines you can determine if your protein binds specifically to the expected cell line. For example, test the CD200 FAST protein against wild type (CHO), vector only (CHO.pAF112), CD200R1 (CHO.pNP1), and PDL1 (CHO.pAF146) cell lines. If the CD200 FAST protein binds only to CHO.pNP1, then a strong inference can be made that the expected protein interaction occurs.  Thaw your original CHO cell line that secreted the FAST proteins for each color used. These can be used as single-color positive controls for setting up the flow cytometer. These can be thawed the day before the assay in cRF10 and used the next day.  In this assay we will prepare a \"quick load\" plate that contains the FAST proteins at their final staining concentration. This allows the use of a multichannel pipet for quick transfer of the treatment to the target cells and reduces variation in staining time.See \"exp_ID_FlowCytometry\" for fillable Plate layoutMaterials and reagents needed for Procedure E: T75 sterile tissue-culture treated cell culture flask with vented cap–1 for each cell line used1x U-bottom 96-well plate (sterile with lid)1x U-bottom 96-well plate (sterile with lid) for aliquoting treatments for rapid loading of warm treatments (i.e.",

These wells heat the fastest and have the highest evaporation rate. Transfer 5 ml of cRF5 to a 5 ml tube.Add 5 μl of 100 mM chloroquine to achieve a 100 μM concentration of chloroquine in cRF5. Chloroquine is added to block acidification of the lysosome, which allows internalised fluorescent proteins to accumulate and yield a stronger signal (Qureshi et al., 2011).Transfer 1.4 ml of cRF5 with 100 μM chloroquine into microfuge tubes (1 for each FAST protein).Transfer the appropriate volume of FAST protein into the microfuge tube.Aliquot 110 μl of diluted FAST proteins into the appropriate wells of a U-bottom 96-well plate.Aliquot 110 μl of PBS into all other wells. This is performed to maintain humidity and temperature in wells without cells.Note: You will transfer 100 μl from this plate to the assay plate below. Store the quick load plate at 37 °C with the lid on until needed (no more than an hour or two).Preparation of adherent target cell lines Decant media from target cells in T75 flasks into a waste reservoir containing bleach.Notes: Final concentration of bleach in the reservoir at the end of the experiment should be > 10%.If using a different target cell line that is not adherent (i.e.",

These gates can be adjusted as needed based on the fluorescent output of your single-color controls.Run your single-color controls and adjust voltage and compensation as needed. This requires an experienced flow cytometry user.Adjust gates as needed.Note: If analyzing unfixed cells, it is important to use unfixed single-color controls as fixation may alter the background fluorescence of cells.
