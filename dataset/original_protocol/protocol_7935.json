    "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at American University.\n1. Preparing the Solution Tanks\nObtain six tanks, two for each experimental group (glucose, mannitol, and water). Label one of the two tanks ‘housing tank’ (it will house the fish) and label the other ‘solution tank’ (it will hold the solution).\n\tNOTE: The mannitol treatment group is the osmotic control, and the water treatment group is a handling/stress control. It is important to keep the tanks, airlines/airstones, lids, and cleaning supplies separate for each treatment group\nUse a 2 L tank if the total number of fish used is less than 20. Use a 4 L tank if the total number of fish used is more than 20.\n\tNOTE: Use an N of 5-10 per treatment group per sampling time point.\nKeep the tanks in a water bath at 28-29 °C to maintain water temperature.\nOn Day 1, place the fish into their respective treatment solutions (glucose, mannitol, water) for 24-hours (‘Water to Treatment’). On Day 2, transfer the fish from their treatment solutions to water for 24-hours (‘Treatment to Water’). On Day 3, transfer the fish from water to treatment solutions (‘Water to Treatment’). This alternating exposure continues for the remainder of the experiment (Figure 1). Transfer water-treated control fish from water to water daily.\nEnsure that the fish are fed and transferred within the same 2-hour window each day throughout the duration of the experiment.\n2. Preparing the fish\nUse adult zebrafish (4 months – 1 year)5.\nFeed the fish ground Tetramin flakes daily upon arrival to the lab.\nRecord the pH and the temperature of all the tanks and record the general condition of the fish.\n3. Transferring fish",
    "Transfer fish in each treatment group from the housing tank to the corresponding solution tank using a standard fish net.\nPlace the tank containing the fish back in the water bath, replace the airstone and tank lid. This tank is now the ‘housing tank’ and the tank that previously held the fish is now the ‘solution tank’.\nDiscard the old solution and clean the tank, along with the tank lids, airlines, airstones, and nets to prevent buildup of glucose and mannitol.\n\tNOTE: Do not wash items with soap. Use water and a dedicated scrub brush/sponge for each treatment condition to properly clean the tanks.\nDry the newly cleaned ‘solution tanks’ with a paper towel. Prepare the solutions for the following day using this tank. Ensure the other items are dried and separated by appropriate treatment groups.\n\tNOTE: Keep a log of what solutions the fish are being transferred out of and into each day, as well as the solutions that are prepared for the following day. For example: Fish transferred from glucose to H2O, new 1% glucose solution prepared for tomorrow.\n4. Post-transfer solution preparation\nPreparing sugar solutions\n\t\nFill each solution tank with 2 L (or 4 L) of System Water (system water is defined as water that has been treated with the correct ratio of salt solution and is at the same temperature as stock and treatment tanks).\nMeasure the correct amount of glucose and mannitol (see step 5 below) using a top loading scale and separate weigh boats for each chemical.\nAdd the weighed glucose or mannitol aliquot to the appropriate, cleaned solution tank, which contains only system water.\nStir the glucose and mannitol solutions with separate glass stir rods until the sugars are completely dissolved.",
    "Return solution tanks to the water bath and cover with their corresponding lids.\nPreparing water solutions\n\t\nFill experimental tanks (2 L or 4 L) with System Water.\nReturn these ‘solution tanks’ to the water bath and cover with their corresponding lids.\n5. Changing percentages\nMaintain the fish in a 1% solution during the first 2-weeks of treatment: 40 g of glucose or mannitol in a 4 L tank.\nMaintain the fish in a 2% solution during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment: 80 g of glucose or mannitol in a 4 L tank.\nMaintain the fish in a 3% solution for the final 4 weeks of treatment: 120 g of glucose or mannitol in a 4 L tank.\n6. Measuring blood glucose levels and collecting tissue\nAnesthetize fish 2 at a time in a 0.02% Tricaine solution.\nDecapitate the fish directly behind the gills using a razorblade.\nMeasure blood sugar value.\n\tNOTE: We use a blood glucose meter (e.g., Freestyle Lite) to measure blood glucose and place the test strip directly on the exposed heart (cardiac blood sample).\nDissect the wanted tissue from the fish (brain, muscle, etc.).\nStore collected tissue by flash freezing on dry ice and storing in a -80 °C freezer, fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde, or placing in a buffer solution for immediate use.\nSubscription Required.
