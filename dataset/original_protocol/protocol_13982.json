    "The clinical protocol follows the ethical guidelines of the University Hospital at Zurich. All methods and techniques are based on the described approach of CMT in the NICU and are recommended to be provided by music therapists specially trained in CMT (CMT training or the Rhythm Breath and Lullaby training with CMT modules39,40,41). CMT can be delivered when the infant is clinically stable, as defined by nurses and doctors of the neonatal team, 2-3 times per week, for approximately 20 min each session.\n1. Preparation\nBefore initiating music therapy, conduct an in-depth assessment with team members of the unit (e.g., doctors, nurses, psychologists) and as soon as possible with the parents to identify the needs of the infant and parents. Based on these needs create therapeutic objectives oriented towards the principles of neonatal music therapy and family-integrated care approaches42,43,44.\nIntroduce music therapy to the parents. Assess their needs, resources, musical heritage, and culture. Assess what song or music they wish for as well as their natural vocal range. Assess if they already provided music to their infant during pregnancy, and if so, integrate this music in the therapy procedures referred to as \"song of kin\"45.\nSupply the parents with empowering intercultural music material (e.g., the lullaby book \"Wiegenlieder für die Kleinsten. Ausgewählte Lieder von Eltern für Eltern frühgeborener Kinder\" [Lullabies for the most little ones. Songs of parents for parents of preterm infants])46. Parents of preterm infants sang all the international songs in this book and framed each song with their written experiences on why and how they sang to empower and to motivate other parents to sing for their infant as well47. Alternatively, provide further information (e.g., a flyer) to motivate parents to engage in vocal interaction with their infant.",
    "Continue to assess the infants' and parents' needs during their clinical trajectory over time by attending interdisciplinary neonatal rounds and or meetings regularly and by intensifying the dialogue with the parents. Continue to adapt to these families' needs to facilitate a needs-, and resource-based therapeutic process.\nIdentify a reasonable time frame with the neonatal staff and the parents in which to conduct the music therapy session to minimize the chance of interfering with healthcare routines, treatments, emergencies, infant resting periods, and needs of the parents.\nDiscuss with neonatal staff and/or parents if the session should take place at the incubator or bedside only with the infant or together with the parents. For example, when the parents spend a lot of time in the NICU and enjoy the shared sessions, conduct as many joint sessions as possible, mostly and preferably during KC. When parents have less time, fewer possibilities to visit, or are not accountable, offer music therapy with other caregivers or just the infant as well.\nBefore providing CMT, seek the latest meaningful clinical information on the infant and its family as well as approval of the neonatal team. Tune the monochord in the key of the unit (the most dominant and frequent monitor beeping tone of the unit) if the instrument is needed for the session48.\nBefore conducting each music therapy session and entering the patient zone, disinfect hands, arms, and the instrument by following the hygiene guidelines of the neonatal unit and the individual infant. Disinfect and prepare a chair at the bedside of the infant or next to the parents.\n2. Creative Music Therapy with the Preterm Infant at the Bedside or Incubator",
    "When the infant tolerates touch, start with initial touch by touching the infant at the head and feet and change it into therapeutic touch by lightly laying one hand on the chest or the back49,50. While touching the infant connect with the infant, notice any increased or decreased muscle tension, any voluntary or involuntary movement, and support the breathing movements and patterns by adapting the pressure and weight of the hand on the chest or back to these patterns.\nAfter a period of observation, start with infant-directed humming entrained to the infant's breathing pattern, incorporating the infant's signs of mimicry and movements to attune to the infant's needs and to support or regulate breathing. Fade in the music: Start with a few long and calm notes proceeding in small steps with a high degree of repetitions and continuity.\nDevelop the melody slowly over time. Often this occurs synchronously: for example, when the infant's eyebrows lift, move the melodic pitch and tempo upwards16. In contrast, when the infant is overly aroused, reduce the melody's span of pitches and pitch range and shift it downwards, slow the tempo, and repeat the closing notes to soothe the infant.\nHum to sooth and sing to activate, synchronize and interact with older infants, or infants who open their eyes and mouth and/or start \"mouthing\" (i.e., shaping their mouth to make \"oh\" and \"ah\" sounds and tongue play) and/or move their fingers or arms smoothly50.\nHum and sing simply in lullaby style in order not to overwhelm the infant: Keep the voice calm, slow, simple, predictable, repetitive, and contingent with the pitch range of children's songs based on the guidelines of neonatal music therapy24,43,44. Hum with flowing breath and a free natural voice full of overtones and total ease.",
    "Incorporate the \"song of kin\"25 in lullaby style in the individualized, attuned improvisation. If necessary, attune to environmental sounds to integrate and thereby mitigate disturbing noises such as a monitor beeping50 oriented towards environmental music therapy approaches4,48.\nAfter ~15-20 min (adapt the duration to the individual needs of the infant) fade the humming or singing slowly out by reducing the notes, the tempo, the rhythms, and conclude by repeating the last note51.\nHold the infant some seconds longer before removing hands slowly and cautiously.\n3. Creative Music Therapy with the Parents During Skin-to-skin Care\nAssess the current needs of the parents (e.g., assess if they would like to listen and relax during the music therapy session or if they would like to sing along).\nInvite the parents to sit or lie down comfortably. Position the monochord next to the side chair of the parent with the infant in KC. Place the instrument next to the elbow or arm of the parents so that the relaxing vibrations can transmit to their body.\nIf appropriate, invite the parents to breathe in and out deeply. Invite the parents to close their eyes, to focus on their breathing, and afterward to focus on feeling their infant. Alternatively, invite the parents to observe and interact with their infant, as they prefer. This procedure may be appropriate as preparation for the joint music therapy session and/or during the session accompanied by monochord sounds and singing and/or speaking.\nAfter a short period of observing the parent-infant dyad, start with long, calm sound waves on the monochord, entrained to the infant's breathing pattern (e.g., three sets of infant inhalations and exhalations = one long continuous strum on the monochord). Fade the sound in smoothly.",
    "After a while (~90 s) hum along with the monochord sound, as described above, or accompany and support the parental humming/singing for their infant.\n\t\nAttune and tailor the humming and singing to the affects, rhythms, and needs of the infant and environmental sounds as described above and additionally to the parents' needs (compare previous publication23,47).\nHum or sing within the parents' vocal range to facilitate parental humming or singing. To honor the family's musical and cultural heritage integrate their favorite music in the singing23,25.\nAfter ~15-20 min (adapt the duration to the individual needs of the infant), fade the humming or singing slowly out by reducing the notes, the tempo, the rhythms, and repeating the last note. Continue to play the monochord for 1 or 2 min more and fade the monochord sound smoothly out. Hold the moment of reverberation and silence some seconds longer before removing the instrument slowly and cautiously.\nIf appropriate, ask the parents how they experienced the music therapy session for themselves and how they perceived their infant's reactions. If appropriate, share perceptions of the infant's behavioral state and reactions (e.g., smiling, finger movements, if occurred). Give feedback about observations and thereby encourage and value observed appropriate parental and infant behavior as well as appropriate parental-infant interactions to promote parental self-efficacy and parent-infant attachment.\nEncourage the parents to use their voice to connect with their infant in their daily NICU routine. Encourage the parents to use infant-directed speech with \"motherese\"52,53 and humming and singing, as preferred by the parents.",
    "When therapeutically indicated, invite the parents to engage in song writing, a widely used music therapy method to express and validate experiences, to externalize emotions and thoughts54, and to intensify and personalize the parent-infant interactions in neonatal music therapy in particular30,55,56. Invite the parents to write about their musical experiences in their dairy (or the diary pages of the lullaby book \"Wiegenlieder für die Kleinsten\") and to quote their song.\n4. Creative Music Therapy with Additional Family Members\nPrepare and adapt to the current needs of the infant and parents as described above, but assess the needs of siblings, grandparents, or other significant caregivers, if and how they wish to participate in the music therapy sessions. Assess well-known family songs and model the song in lullaby style for the preterm infant.\nAssess the context, history, and heritage of the chosen songs and invite the family to share their associations and emotions regarding the chosen music. Sing the song for or with the family based on the infant's and family's current needs. Sing and or accompany as described above or let the family members sing for the infant and accompany or listen and coach them. Encourage the family to use infant-directed speech or singing when they visit the infant as well.\n5. Follow-up\nMake a new appointment with the parents, if appropriate. Upon exiting the patient zone, disinfect following the neonatal hygiene guidelines.\nDocument the sessions as described elsewhere16. Give feedback to and discuss with neonatal staff and parents (if available). Attend integrative rounds and continuously assess the needs of the team and parents to incorporate these needs in the therapeutic process.",
    "Write a final patient report before hospital discharge and advise parents on how to use music at home, including written recommendations. If appropriate, give the parents a call 2 weeks after discharge to inquire how they are doing and to recommend further musical support."
