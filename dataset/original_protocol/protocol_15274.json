  "procedures": [
    "1. Isolation of the Cardiac Nuclei\nCoat ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Centrifuge Tubes #363664) with 10 ml of 1%BSA/PBS coating solution. Cap the tubes and let them rotate for 30 min in a tube rotator. Remove the coating solution and let the centrifuge tubes air dry (one tube per mouse heart is required for the analysis of single mouse hearts, alternately up to 5 mouse hearts or 1 g of heart tissue from a different species (e.g. human) can be processed in one tube).\nAll following steps should be performed on ice. Dissect the left ventricle from fresh or snap-frozen mouse heart with a scalpel. Note, this protocol is optimized for mouse heart but can also be adapted to rat or human heart. Alternatively, use up to 1 g of heart tissue from a different species.\nTrim the specimen into small cubicles with a scalpel.\nTransfer the tissue pieces into a 50 ml Falcon tube filled with 15 ml of lysis buffer.\nHomogenize the heart tissue with a T-25 Ultra-Turrax probe homogenizer (IKA) at 24,000 rpm for 10 sec.\nDilute the homogenate with equal volume of lysis buffer to 30 ml.\nUse a glass douncer (40 ml) to further homogenize the tissue and free the nuclei. Perform eight strokes with a large clearance pestle.\nPass the crude nuclei isolate through a 100 μm and 70 μm nylon mesh cell strainer (BD Biosciences), consecutively.\nSpin down the crude nuclei isolate in a refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C) at 700 x g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant carefully by inverting the tubes and wipe the inside of the tube with paper towel. Be careful not to disturb the nuclei pellet.",
    "Dissolve the crude nuclei isolate in 5 ml of sucrose buffer by pipetting the solution several times up and down. Add a further 25 ml of sucrose buffer to the dissolved pellet.\nAdd 10 ml of freshly prepared sucrose buffer to the coated ultracentrifuge tube (see step 1.1).\nCarefully overlay the added 10 ml of sucrose buffer with the resuspended nuclei pellet dissolved in sucrose buffer from step 1.9.\nBalance the centrifuge tubes before placing them into a JS13.1 free swinging rotor and place the rotor into a high-speed centrifuge (Beckman Avanti S-25).\nSpin the nuclei sample at 13,000 x g at 4 °C for 60 min.\nWhen the spin has completed, remove the tubes carefully from the rotor and discard the supernatant by inverting the tubes and wiping the remaining debris from the inside of the tubes with paper towel.\nDissolve the nuclei pellet in 1 ml of nuclei storage buffer (NSB plus buffer). Note: NSB plus contains 1.5 mM spermine as a DNA stabilizer.\nProceed with step 2.1, immunostaining of cardiomyocyte nuclei.\n2. Immunostaining for Flow Cytometry\nPrepare the negative control for immunostaining. Take an aliquot of 20 μl out of the nuclei sample and add 980 μl of NSB plus buffer.\nAdd anti-pericentriolar material 1 antibody (rabbit anti-PCM-1, Atlas Antibodies) to the nuclei sample in a dilution of 1:500 to immunolabel cardiomyocyte nuclei. Add the isotype antibody in the same dilution as the anti-PCM-1 antibody to the negative control, prepared in step 2.1.\nIncubate negative control and sample tube at 4 °C overnight.\nWash negative control and sample at least once with NSB plus buffer (spin down tubes in a refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C) at 700 x g for 10 min. Discard supernatant and dissolve the nuclei pellet in 1 ml of NSB plus buffer).",
    "Add anti-rabbit fluorescent secondary antibody (FITC or APC) to negative control and sample tube in a dilution of 1:1000.\nIncubate negative control and sample tube at 4 °C for 1 h.\nWash negative control and sample at least once with NSB plus buffer (spin down tubes in a refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C) at 700 x g for 10 min. Discard supernatant and dissolve the nuclei pellet in 1 ml of NSB plus buffer).\nProceed with the flow cytometric analysis and sorting.\n3. Flow Cytometry\nCoat nuclei collection tubes (Falcon 15 ml) with 1%BSA/PBS solution before you start flow cytometry sorting as described in step 1.1.\nFilter the sample and the negative control through a 30 μm cell strainer and load first the negative control to the flow cytometer (BD Influx). Define the first and second gate to define nuclei and singlets (single nuclei), based on forward scatter (FSC), forward scatter pulse width (FS pulse width) and side scatter (SSC) (Fig. 2a and b). Adding a DNA stain (DRAQ5 (1:500)) to the sample can help to identify the nuclei population initially.\nLoad the immunolabeled sample and define the third gate to isolate cardiomyocyte nuclei (PCM-1-positve) from non-cardiomyocyte nuclei (PCM-1-negative). Start the sorting (Fig. 2c and d).\nOptional: In order to analyze the nuclear DNA content (ploidy) and to perform cell cycle analysis add an appropriate DNA stain to the nuclei (e.g. Hoechst 33342 or DRAQ5) (Fig. 2e).\nAfter flow cytometry sorting, place the nuclei on ice and re-analyze to determine the sorting purity (Fig. 3a and b).\nSpin down the sorted nuclei in the collection tubes at 1500 x g in a refrigerated centrifuge for 15 min.\nDissolve the nuclei pellet in a buffer compatible with the downstream application.\n4. Representative Results",
    "Nuclei morphology and integrity can be assessed by DNA stains and visualized by microscopy (Fig. 1). Successful PCM-1 labeling can be assessed by epifluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2c and d). PCM-1-positive and negative populations should be well separated from each other (Fig. 2c and d). In murine left ventricle about 30% of all nuclei should be cardiomyocyte nuclei (Fig. 2d). Sorting purity can be assessed by re-analyzing the sorted nuclei (Fig. 3a and b). Both nuclei populations should have a sorting purity exceeding 95%.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4205/4205fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. PCM-1 identifies cardiomyocyte nuclei.  Cardiac nuclei (a) are stained with antibodies to PCM-1 (b) and to Nkx2.5 (c) in an adult mouse heart. (d) PCM-1-labeled nuclei are surrounded by cardiomyocyte cytoplasm (myosin heavy chain (MHC)) and express the transcription factor Nkx2.5, documenting the accurate identification of cardiomyocyte nuclei by PCM-1 staining (scale bars 20 μm and 10 μm (d, inset)). (e) Cardiac nuclei isolates visualized with the DNA stain DRAQ5. (f and g) Cardiomyocyte nuclei are labeled with antibodies against PCM-1 (scale bar 10 μm). Note, the epinuclear staining pattern of PCM-1 in myocyte nuclei in tissue section and in isolated nuclei (arrows).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4205/4205fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

(b) A second gate identifies single nuclei by FSC and FS pulse width5. (c, d) Fluorescent gating allows the separation of cardiomyocyte nuclei (PCM-1-positive) and non-cardiomyocyte (PCM-1-negative) nuclei from heart tissue. (e) Mouse cardiomyocyte are mostly (>80%) diploid (2n), only a small subset is tetraploid (4n)6. Note, human cardiomyocytes contain a higher frequency of polyploidy nuclei (>2n)7,8.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4205/4205fig3.jpg",
