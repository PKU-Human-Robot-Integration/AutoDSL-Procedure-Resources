    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLysosomes are artificially damaged by treating with L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester (LLOMe), which becomes membranolytic when LLOMe is cleaved by cathepsin D.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Galectins recognize such lysosome membrane damage, mostly Galectin-3 (Gal3), which binds to N-glycans of proteins by translocating from the cytoplasm to the lysosomal lumen. Thus, we can monitor lysosomal membrane damage, repair, or clearance by observing Gal3 puncta after the washout of LLOMe. Here, we describe two methods to monitor Gal3 puncta using immunostained cells and cell lines stably expressing GFP-Gal3. Our recent studies also show the method and example results.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nInduction of lysosomal damage and detection of the endogenous Galectin-3\nTiming: 2 days\nCell culture.\nPlace sterile coverslips into a 6-well plate (5 coverslips/well).\nCoat the coverslips with Cellmatrix Type I-C diluted 10 times with sterile water and incubate the plate for at least 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the coverslips with PBS twice.\nPlate the cells onto the coverslips (1.0–2.0×105 cells/well). The total culture medium should be around 2 mL.\nCritical: Optimize the cell number for your experimental setup. Cells should be at 70%–80% confluency the next day. It is difficult to recognize the cells with CellPathfinder (See step 8) if the cells are almost confluent.\nIncubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h at 37°C.\nInduction of lysosomal membrane damage.\nAdd 2 mL of LLOMe containing culture medium at 1 mM final concentration.\nNote: Optimize the LLOMe concentration for your cell lines.\nIncubate the cells for 1 h at 37°C.\nRemove the LLOMe solution, and then wash the cells gently with 2 mL of PBS twice.\nAdd 2 mL of fresh culture medium.\nIncubate the cells for 1 or 10 h at 37°C.\nNote: Optimize the incubation time for your experimental setup.",
    "Wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS twice.\nFor fixation, remove PBS, add 1 mL of 4% PFA and incubate the cells for 20 min at 20°C–25°C under aluminum foil.\nNote: PFA solution should be equilibrated to 20°C–25°C before use.\nWash the cells with 2 mL of PBS twice.\nPause point: After the PFA fixation, the samples can be stored in PBS at 4°C for a week.\nImmunostaining for endogenous Galectin-3.\nPermeabilize the cells with 50 μg/mL digitonin-PBS solution for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the samples with PBS twice.\nFor blocking, incubate with 0.2% gelatin-PBS for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the samples with PBS twice.\nIncubate the cells with 40 μL/coverslip of anti-Galectin-3 primary antibody solution diluted at 1: 1,000 with 0.2% gelatin-PBS solution for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: You should include anti-LAMP1 or LAMP2 antibody to stain lysosomes as a control. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nPause point: The samples can be incubated at 4°C for 14–18 h.\nWash the samples with PBS for 5 min three times.\nIncubate the cells with 40 μL/coverslip of the secondary antibody solution diluted at 1: 500 with 0.2% gelatin-PBS solution for 40–60 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: The samples should be under aluminum foil to prevent bleaching.\nWash the samples with PBS for 5 min three times.\nDrop 5–10 μL/coverslip of the mounting medium with DAPI (e.g., VECTASHIELD H-1200) onto glass slides and mount the coverslips at cell surface-down.\nRemove the excess mounting medium with filter papers and seal the coverslips with nail polish.\nPause point: After mounting, the samples can be stored in a black box at 4°C for a month.\nInduction of lysosomal damage and detection of GFP-Gal3\nTiming: 2–10 days\nCell culture (in case you need to establish cell lines stably expressing GFP-Gal3).",
    "Note: Go to step 5 if you have cells stably expressing GFP-Gal3.\nNote: Check the biosafety level of your laboratory to produce infectious retrovirus.\nNote: Transient highly overexpression may induce protein aggregates. These GFP-positive aggregates cannot be distinguished with GFP-Gal3-positive damaged lysosomes after LLOMe treatment. Thus, we recommend using stably mild-expressing cells in which GFP-Gal3 should be distributed to cytoplasm without puncta. However, transient expression can also be used if GFP-Gal3 is distributed to cytoplasm in plasmid-transfected cells.\nCell plating.\nPlate PlatE cells at 2.0 × 106 cell/dish in a 6 cm dish with culture medium described in Materials. The total culture medium is 2 mL.\nIncubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h at 37°C.\nTransfection for retrovirus production.\nTube 1: Mix 3 μg of pMRX_IRES-puro_GFP-Gal3 and 3 μg of pVSVG in 250 μL of OPTI-MEM.\nTube 2: Add 16 μL of PEI to 250 μL of OPTI-MEM and mix well.\nMix tube-1 and tube-2 and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDrop 500 μL of the mixture into 2.5 mL fresh culture medium.\nGently shake the dish to mix and incubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 24 h at 37°C.\nChange to fresh culture medium and incubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 24 h at 37°C.\nNote: The culture medium contains retrovirus. Cells and the medium must be handled in a biosafety cabinet.\nRetrovirus infection.\nOne day before infection, plate HeLa cells at 1.0 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate.\nNote: If cell confluency on infection day is 100%, transduction efficiency becomes quite lower. The ideal confluency on the infection day is around 50%–80%.\nAt 48 h post-transfection, the culture medium is filtered with a sterilized 0.45 μm PVDF filter to remove cell debris.",
    "Pause point: The virus-containing medium can be stored at −80°C for a month, although the virus titer may decrease 10–100-fold.\nMix 200–500 μL of virus-containing medium with 2 μL of 4 mg/mL polybrene.\nDrop the mixture into 2 mL of fresh culture medium in the 6-well plate.\nIncubate the cells with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 14–18 h.\nCell selection.\nReplace to medium containing 3 μg/mL of puromycin.\nIncubate and select the cells.\nNote: Cells without an infection should die after 3–5 days in a culture medium containing puromycin.\nNote: You do not need to pick up single clone if you have stably mild-expressing cells in which GFP-Gal3 should be distributed to cytoplasm without puncta.\nCell culture.\nAdd 100 μL of culture medium into each well of 96-well glass bottom plate.\nNote: More than 3 wells for one sample condition are needed to analyze statistically.\nPlate 100 μL of cell suspension into a 96 well-plate at 4,000 cells/100 μL and leave the plate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C until cells sink to the bottom.\nIncubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h.\nCritical: After this plating step, cell distribution can be problematic. Take a close look at the cell distribution before you start the next experiment. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nInduction of lysosomal membrane damage.\nAdd 100 μL of LLOMe containing culture medium at 1 mM final concentration.\nNote: Optimize the LLOMe concentration for your cell lines.\nIncubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nRemove the medium and wash the cells with 200 μL of PBS twice.\nCritical: DO NOT pipette vigorously. Add or aspirate the liquid gently not to detach the cells.\nAdd 200 μL of fresh medium to the cells.\nIncubate the cells for 1 or 10 h at 37°C.",
    "Note: Optimize the incubation time for your experimental setup.\nWash the cells with 200 μL of PBS twice.\nFor fixation, remove PBS, add 100 μL of 4% PFA and incubate the cells for 20 min at 20°C–25°C under aluminum foil.\nNote: PFA solution should be equilibrated to 20°C–25°C before use.\nRemove 4% PFA and wash the cells with 200 μL of PBS twice.\nPause point: After PFA fixation, the samples can be stored in PBS at 4°C for a week.\nNote: The plate should be covered with aluminum foil to avoid bleaching.\nRemove PBS, add 100 μL of DAPI solution diluted at 1: 2,000 with PBS, and incubate the samples for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: The plate should be covered with aluminum foil to avoid bleaching.\nRemove the DAPI solution and wash the cells with 200 μL of PBS twice.\nPause point: The samples can be stored in PBS at 4°C within a week.\nCritical: The plate should be covered with aluminum foil to avoid bleaching.\nAcquisition of microscope images with CellVoyager CQ1\nTiming: 1–2 h\nCellVoyager CQ1 enables us to acquire massive datasets semi-automatically at high speed.
