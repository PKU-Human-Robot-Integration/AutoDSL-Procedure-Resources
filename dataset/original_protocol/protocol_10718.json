    "1. Biaxial Loading Bioreactor Design\nThe bioreactor employs two stages manufactured by Thor-labs (Newton, MA) for precision-guided laser applications for applying uniaxial or biaxial mechanical strain to engineered tissues, with great precision of loading dose (amplitude and frequency) and application to a wide variety of tissue culture conditions from single to 24 well plates (Figure 1).\nBi-axial loading is accomplished by two TravelMax stages (LNR50SE). These stages are mounted orthogonally in an XZ configuration. The horizontal stage provides dynamic shearing motions by oscillating along the X-axis. The vertical stage provides dynamic compressive loading by oscillating along the Z-axis. These stages have a 50 mm travel range and are driven independently by stepper motor actuators (DRV014), controlled by a closed-loop stepper motor driver (BSC102) that features micro-stepping capabilities, enabling step sizes of less than 50 nm.\nThe device is mounted on a rigid 25 cm x 30 cm x 12.5 mm aluminum base plate that is used as a platform for assembly of machine components and for mounting of tissue culture plates. Adjustable kinematic stops are used to lock tissue culture plates in place on the aluminum base plate. These kinematic stops have fine adjustment screws to allow for precise alignment that is otherwise not achievable by hand. The modular design of the base plate allows for flexible placement of these kinematic stops to accommodate plates of different sizes and shapes (Petri dishes vs. multi-well plates).\nA custom-machined polysulfone loading platen is coupled to the bi-axial moving platform via a precision-machined right angle bracket. Polysulfone material was chosen due to its biocompatibility, ease of machining, and ease of sterilization.",
    "Movements of the stages are controlled by Thor-labs' Advanced Positioning Technology (APT) software. The stepper motor driver is used in combination with the software that permits the adjustment of load parameters of frequency and amplitude of both shear and compression independently and simultaneously.\nPositional feedback is provided by linear optical encoders that are attached to each moving platform and are integrated with the software. The encoder system has a bidirectional repeatability of 0.1 μm and a resolution of 20 nm, translating to a positional accuracy of less than 3 μm over the full 50 mm of travel. These encoders provide the necessary position feedback to the drive electronics to ensure true nanopositioning capabilities and a direct readout of the absolute position.\nIn order to provide the force feedback necessary for detecting contact between platen and samples and evaluate loading responses, a precision miniature load cell (Honeywell Model 31) is positioned between the loading platen and the moving platform (Figure 2). The load cell has high accuracies of 0.15% to 0.25% full scale. The display unit (SC500) for the load cell can also provide load measurements of up to 5 decimal places. Additionally, it has an RS-232 port to allow for data collection on a computer.\n2. Cell-Seeded Agarose Constructs\nPrepare 4% agarose: Add 0.8 g agarose to 20 ml DMEM (no additives) in a 50 ml flask, boil, and then keep in 70 °C oven until use.\nAdjust volume of cell suspension for double amount of the desired cell seeding density. This suspension is mixed with equal volume of 4% w/v agarose to create a 2% agarose gel at the desired seeding density.\nPlace both the cell suspension and one 10 ml pipette in the incubator.",
    "Set up gel casting system. One 1.5 mm and one 0.75 mm spacer plate should be put together to create a 2.25 mm thick gel. Other size spacer plates may be used to create different gel thicknesses. The gel casting system is not large enough to hold these plates together, so they must be securely taped to prevent leaking.\nThe next step is to quickly mix the cell suspension with the previously prepared agarose and pipette into the gel mold before the agarose solidifies. Remove the liquid agarose from the oven and place a sterile thermometer in it. The agarose must cool to 42-43 °C before mixing with cells. Warm up the cell suspension to 37 °C. Once the agarose hits 43 °C, quickly pipette up the desired amount and then immediately pipette the cell suspension up and down a few times to mix. Then immediately pipette the entire mixture into the gel mold.\nAllow the gel to solidify for 10-15 min and then carefully tilt it to a horizontal position.\nRemove the top glass plate and punch disks with the biopsy punch. Disks can be picked up with a small sterile spatula. In our experience, a 9 ml gel was large enough to make more than a hundred 5-mm-diameter discs.\n3. Culture the Disks\nPlace one disk in each well of a 24 well non-tissue culture treated plate.\nAdd 2 ml of serum-free chondrogenic differentiation medium to each well.\nPut plates in incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nFor media changes, replace 1 ml per well every 2-3 days.\n4. Immobilization of Samples for Mechanical Loading\nPrepare 4% agarose (no cell suspension added) and the gel should be thinner than the samples themselves (to prevent interference during loading). The recommended thickness is 1.5-1.9 mm (for 2.25 mm thick samples).",
    "Once gelled, punch 16 mm diameter disks for 24 well plates. In each disk, punch one 5 mm hole for the sample to be placed in. If desired, punch another 5 mm hole on the edge of the disk for the pipette to be placed during media changes.\nOnce agarose wells have been made, place in 24 well plate, as shown in Figure 3.\nOnce the agarose wells are in the 24 well plate, press fit samples in each well. The sample should protrude from the top of the agarose well.\n5. Mechanical Loading\nSterilize platen (Figure 2).\nSecure aluminum plate to load cell. Secure loading platen/load cell/aluminum plate assembly to the stage.\nTurn on stepper motor controller (switch in back).\nTurn on PC and open \"APT User\" program (Figure 4).\n \nLeft screen controls horizontal stepper motor. Right screen controls vertical stepper motor. In each screen, \"Graphical Control\" tab allows for manual positioning and \"Move Sequencer\" tab allows for automation. All units are mm.\nGo to \"Graphical Control\" tab on both screens and press \"Home/Zero\" button. Both stepper motors have a range of 50 mm. Pressing \"Home/Zero\" will send both stepper motors to the zero position (top- and right- most positions).\nPrepare the samples in the 24 well plate for loading by removing some media from each well. No more than 1 ml of media should be left in each well to prevent overflow during loading. Be sure that enough media is left in the well to keep the sample covered.\n \nNote that the incubator is kept in low-humidity conditions to prevent instrument failure.\nPlace 24 well plate in bioreactor and carefully line up with the platen.",
    "The plate is secured to the bioreactor using four adjustable kinematic locators. To make it easier to line up the platen, the two left locators have been pre-positioned. Tighten the two right locators so that the plate is secure. Make sure to line the plate up flush with the front of the bioreactor base.\nIn \"Graphical Control\" tab, a specific stepper motor position can be manually entered by clicking on the position box. Use this capability to slowly lower the platen and move it horizontally to line up with plate.\nOnce the platen is close to coming in contact with samples, start to bring the platen down in very slow increments (0.1 mm) until you reach the predetermined starting position (see part 6).\nOnce the starting position is reached, go to \"Move Sequencer\" tab and load the desired move sequence by pressing \"Load.\" Then press \"Run\" to start. (Figure 5) See part 7. Writing a Dosing Protocol.\nWhen finished loading, manually raise the platen. If any samples are stuck to the platen, carefully put them back into the appropriate well using a sterile spatula.\nRemove 24 well plate from bioreactor and replace the media.\nCarefully remove the platen from the load cell and then turn off instruments.\n6. Calibrating Loading Platen\nTo ensure that the proper strains are applied to samples, each platen must be carefully calibrated prior to starting an experiment.\nPerform steps 5.1 to 5.8.\nManually put horizontal stepper motor at the 25 mm position.\nCarefully lower platen until it just barely comes in contact with the base of the bioreactor. Load cell will show increased loads at this point. Take note of the exact position of the vertical stepper motor (be as precise as possible, as all compression strain measurements will be computed from this value).",
    "Record the position. This value will be used to write a dosing protocol based on sample dimensions and desired strains.\n7. Writing a Dosing Protocol\nThe bioreactor is capable of applying both compressive and shear strain, either simultaneously or individually. Three main parameters must be decided: tare compressive strain, dynamic strain amplitude, and loading frequency.\nA tare strain is applied in order to prevent liftoff of the platen from the sample.\nSample dynamic strain amplitude and loading frequency are chosen.\nIn this study we define compressive and shear strain as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50387/50387eq1.jpg\nExample Biaxial Dosing Protocol\nSample thickness: 2.25 mm\nTare Strain (Compression): 10% of the sample thickness (0.225 mm)\nDynamic Strain Amplitude (Compression): 10% (+/- 5% of the sample thickness)\nFrequency (Compression): 1 Hz\nDynamic Strain Amplitude (Shear): 25% of the sample thickness (0.5625 mm): Shear stress is\napplied to the sample by the platen moving horizontally.\nFrequency (Shear): 0.5 Hz\nTypical dosing protocol is 3 hr of loading per day.\nIn this example, dynamic and shear loading is applied simultaneously rather than sequentially. We believe this pattern better mimics the complex loading environment in the human knee.\nOnce a dosing protocol has been selected, a compression move sequence program must be written.\nThe move sequence is exactly what it sounds like, a list of positions that the stepper motor will move to at a specified acceleration and maximum velocity.\nCompute desired vertical positions based on dosing protocol and platen calibration value (from part 6).\nExample computations for Platen 1 are provided below:\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n,Difference from Calibration Value,Vertical Position\nPlaten Calibration Value (touches bottom of bioreactor),0 mm,29.7700 mm\nPlaten makes contact with Sample (2.25 mm sample),4.4140 mm,25.3560 mm\nStrain (5% Thickness ),4.3015 mm,25.4705 mm\nStrain (10% Thickness ),4.1890 mm,25.5810 mm\nStrain (15% Thickness ),4.0765 mm,25.6955 mm",
    "Once positions are computed, experiment with acceleration and maximum velocity values to get the correct frequency. The number of cycles should be chosen, accordingly (e.g. 10,800 cycles for 3 hr at 1 Hz).\nExample Dynamic Compression Move Sequence Program (10% tare compression, 10% dynamic strain amplitude, 1 Hz) (Figure 5)\nDynamic shear move sequence program: The number of cycles should be chosen according to the desired frequency and duration (e.g. 5,400 cycles for 3 hr at 0.5 Hz).\nExample Dynamic Shear Move Sequence Program (10% tare compression, 0.5625 mm (25% of the thickness) dynamic shear strain amplitude, 0.5 Hz) (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
