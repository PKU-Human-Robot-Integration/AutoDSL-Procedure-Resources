Dry slides especially around where you will write with immedged pen and then place on upside down 96 well plates.\n  Perform the following incubations on the slide itself.  Make sure that slides lie flat and solutions do not flow over the Immedged line.  Draw a boundary using Immedge pen or place gaskets around sections before starting incubations.
