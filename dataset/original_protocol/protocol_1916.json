Setup for transcardial injections of algae suspensions into the vascular system of Xenopus laevis tadpoles\nThe spatial arrangement of the binocular, micromanipulator, light source and chamber, holding the animals during the injection have been optimized for visibility and accessibility of the tissue for the injection.\nPrepare a plain and clean metal support plate of about 50 × 40 cm (e.g., magnetic or with drill holes) underneath a binocular (e.g., Olympus SZX7) with a zoomable lens (2.5× to 20×).\nSolidly mount a tripod with a 3-axes micromanipulator (e.g., Bachhofer, Reutlingen) on a base plate next to or on the main plate.\nAttach a holder for electrodes with a diameter of 1.5 mm, equipped with a connector for applying pressurized air onto the micromanipulator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nFix an incompressible polyethylene tube (Inner diameter: 2 mm) to the electrode holder and connect with a pressure injection device (e.g., PDES-02T; npi electronics, Tamm, Germany or FemtoJet 4i; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).\nConnect the pressure injection device (PDES-02T) with a BNC cable to an electrical pulse generator (e.g., Pulse master A300; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA) equipped with a remote control to individually trigger single pulses.\nAdjust the pressure magnitude to 1 bar and the pulse duration to 100 ms.\nPlace a container (20 × 10 × 5 cm), covered with a flat surface in the center of the base plate (see above) underneath the binocular (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]); the container (ice box) has to be filled with crushed ice prior to the injection procedure (see below).\nPlace a fiber optics adjacent to the setup to provide appropriate illumination for the surgery and injection.",
    "Note: Any pressure injection device will suffice for the procedure as long as the injector allows providing short, temporally modifiable pulses in the range of 50–500 ms and a pressure of 0.5–2 bar.\nProvision of algal suspensions for transcardial injections.\nFor cyanobacteria, bring the culture to the required cell-density of 1010 cells · mL-1 by step-wise centrifugation (see above, 5 min, 3,000 g, 20°C).\nFor C. reinhardtii, bring the culture to the required cell-density of 1010 cells · mL-1 by step-wise centrifugation (see above, 5 min, 150–290 g, 20°C).\nResuspend the algae and cyanobacteria in frog Ringer solution at the target concentration in a small lockable container, enwrapped with aluminum foil to prevent excessive light exposure.\nNote: 5 mL of concentrated suspension are sufficient for easy handling and multiple refills of the injection microcapillaries.\nTranscardial injection of microalgae in Xenopus laevis tadpoles\nTiming: 1 h (step 7)\nTiming: 1 h (step 8)\nTiming: 15 min (step 9)\nTiming: 10 min (step 10)\nTiming: 30 min (step 11)\nThis major step describes the surgery of Xenopus tadpoles to access the heart and the actual transcardial injection of the suspension of microalgae.\nPreparation of the anesthetics.\nFreshly prepare the anesthetics by dissolving 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methanesulfonate (MS-222; Pharmaq Ltd., UK) in a volume of 50 mL cold frog Ringer solution.\nThe anesthetics can be stored at 4°C in darkness for up to two weeks.\nPreparation of the fixative.\nFreshly prepare paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixative, by adding PFA powder to 50 mL of 0.1 M · L-1 phosphate buffer.\nGently stir the solution on a heat plate at 62°C.\nAdd a few drops of 1 N NaOH to completely clear the solution.\nCool down the PFA fixative to 20°C and adjust the pH with HCl to 7.3–7.4 before usage.",
    "Note: The preparation of the PFA solution has to be performed under a hood to meet the safety instructions for the handling of this compound.\nAnesthesia of mid-metamorphic tadpoles.\nPlace the tadpole in the 0.05% MS-222 solution until the animal is deeply anesthetized (lack of a tail pinch-induced reflex), which takes about 5–10 min.\nTransfer the anesthetized tadpole into the Sylgard-lined circular dish (diameter: 5 cm), filled with cold (∼10°C) frog Ringer solution and 0.05% MS-222 to maintain the deep anesthesia throughout the injection procedure.\nMechanically secure the anesthetized tadpole at the level of the rostral tail and the head ventral side up with U-shaped pins to the floor of the Sylgard-lined dish.\nNote: The procedure here is described for Xenopus laevis tadpoles at developmental stages 52–53 (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Therefore, indicated times and volumes have to be individually adjusted when using younger (smaller) or older (larger) larvae. The mechanically secured tadpoles must be completely submerged and covered by frog Ringer solution for at least 1–2 mm above the tissue.\nPre-injection surgery.\nFill the container underneath the binocular with crushed ice to ensure a continuous cooling of the frog Ringer solution during the injection procedure (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPlace and firmly fix the Sylgard-lined dish with the anesthetized and mechanically secured tadpole onto the flat surface above the container (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nUse the fiber optics to illuminate the preparation and to optimize the visibility of the tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nGently remove the skin above the heart with a microscissor and forceps, such that the beating heart becomes freely accessible.\nNote: Avoid excessive amounts of light to prevent light-stimulation of the algae.\nInjection of the microalgae.",
    "For physiological experiments: Open the container with the concentrated suspension of microalgae and fill 10 μL of the algae suspension with a 10 μL pipette into a long 20 μL tip without air bubbles. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nFor imaging experiments of algae inside blood vessels: Mix 8 μL algae suspension with 2 μL of Isolectin GS-IB4 obtained from Griffonia simplicifolia Alexa FluorTM 488 conjugate and fill the solution bubble-free into the microcapillary.\nInsert the microcapillary into the electrode holder, mounted onto the 3-axes micromanipulator.\nAdvance the microcapillary until entering the Ringer solution above the tadpole and position the tip close to the surface of the beating heart.\nGently hold the beating heart steady with fine forceps, guide and insert the microcapillary with the 3-axes micromanipulator into the ventricular chamber of the heart.\nLet the algae-filled microcapillary recover inside the heart for 1 min.\nManually trigger single pulses (100 ms, 1 bar) with the remote control in synchrony with the heartbeat (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Transcardial injection of C. reinhardtii, related to step 11\nIf no algae are injected, increase the pulse duration up to 200 ms and/or the pressure up to 2 bar; if this is still unsuccessful, exchange the microcapillary for another one with a larger diameter. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nRepeat (∼5 pulses per minute) until the volume of 10 μL has been injected; each pulse injects an approximate volume of 0.1–0.2 μL.\nThe injection of air into the heart with the last pulse must be avoided.\nAfter the last pulse, gently remove the microcapillary and let the tadpole recover for 5 min before continuing the procedure with the euthanasia of the animal.",
    "Critical: The success of the injection becomes apparent by the pulsed ejection of the microalgae into the bilateral aortic arches (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) and the gradually increasing green color of the heart (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and the rest of the animal (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3F) during the procedure.\nNote: The most critical aspect of the injection procedure is the quality of the microcapillary, which must have a sufficiently large tip diameter to prevent clogging, in particular when injecting the larger C. reinhardtii algae. If the microcapillary is clogged and an ejection of the algae suspension is impossible, the first option is to increase the pressure stepwise up to 2 bar and the pulse duration up to 200 ms.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1511-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
