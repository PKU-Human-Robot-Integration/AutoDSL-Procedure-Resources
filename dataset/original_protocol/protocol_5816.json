    "Preparation of female mice that are older than 2 weeks for mammary gland whole mountsNotes:  Any mouse strain can be used. We routinely use C57Bl/6 and FVB mice that we breed in our animal facility. These mice are also available from commercial breeders (TACONIC model # B6-F and FVB).Rat mammary glands can likely also be used but fixation, staining, de-staining and de-hydration times need to be increased.To study mouse mammary gland branching during gestation, the beginning of pregnancy has to be known. To obtain timed pregnancies, breed one adult male with two 6-8 weeks old females. Add the females to the male cage at the end of the day and inspect females for copulation plugs the following morning. Remove both females from the male cage. Mice that show a copulation plug are potential pregnant and should be housed separately. The day the copulation plug is observed is day 1 of the pregnancy. Images of copulation plugs are available online e.g., Reproductive Biology of Breeding Mice[href=https://www.womenshealth.northwestern.edu/sites/womenshealth/files/ckfinder/userfiles/files/JaxLab Breeding PPT.pdf] (Soper, The Jackson Laboratory). To isolate the mammary gland, sacrifice the mouse at the desired day of gestation using CO2 inhalation. Using small scissors, make one skin incision across the abdomen and a second incision down the midline. The skin can now be peeled back and the mammary gland becomes visible underneath the skin.Use small scissors to remove the mammary gland from the skin. Please see provided video (Video 1) for details.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Skin incision, removal of the mammary gland and spreading of the tissue onto glass slides  Transfer the gland to an electrostatically adherent microscopy slide and use blunt end forceps to spread out the gland over the glass slide as much as possible without tearing apart the tissue.",
    "Lay slide with the tissue side facing up on a flat surface for 5 min to allow the tissue to partially dry and stick to the glass surface.Submerge the slides in sufficient amount of Carnoy’s solution to cover the entire mammary gland and store inside a chemical hood for 18-24 h at room temperature.Tissue staining, de-staining, dehydration, and mounting has to be performed inside a chemical hood.Transfer the slides into Carmine alum solution and store in the solution 24 h-3 days, depending on the thickness of the mammary gland, at room temperature. Staining is completed when red dye penetrated entire tissue and unstained areas are visible. The Carmine alum solution can be used up to three times.The Carmine alum will stain the epithelial structures of the gland. To remove excess dye submerge the slides in de-staining solution at room temperature. Change the solution every 30 min until solution remains clear. The time required for de-staining varies and depends on the thickness of the mammary gland but 3 h is sufficient for most samples.Dehydrate mammary glands by submerging slides for 5 min each in 70, 80, 95 and 100% ethanol, then submerge slides in xylene overnight at room temperature.Slides can be stored submerged in xylene in glass containers or be mounted with Permount SP15. Glass containers with slides and xylene need to be stored inside a chemical hood. Evaporated Xylene needs to be replaced from time to time to prevent samples from drying out. Therefore, mounting slides with Permount is a better alternative for long-term storage.To mount samples: lay slides tissue side up on a flat surface inside a chemical hood. Cover the sample with sufficient Permount SP15 to cover the mammary gland tissue. Slowly lower a cover glass on top of the mammary tissue and apply light pressure.",
    "Lay slides tissue side up on a flat surface inside a chemical hood. Let slides dry for 24 h. Permount will shrink while drying, exposing outer edges of the mammary gland tissue and making it necessary to add more Permount. Add Permount underneath the coverslip edges using a glass Pasteur pipette with a rubber ball. Lay slides tissue side up on a flat surface inside a chemical hood and inspect slides again after 24 h. Continue adding Permount for 3-7 days or until mammary gland tissue remains covered with Permount. Store mounted slides laying flat inside a chemical hood for one week. Slides can be stored inside a plastic slide box.Images of the mammary gland can be taken with a digital camera attached to a dissecting microscope."
