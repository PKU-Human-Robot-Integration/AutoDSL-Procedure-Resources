As a proof-of-principle, we use human FANCD2 as a target to study its interacting proteins. The human FANCD2 cDNA was cloned into the pOZ-N retroviral expression vector, which contains a Flag and HA tag at the N-terminus. The pOZ vector contains long terminal repeats to control the integration and expression of target proteins and also a bi-cistronic transcriptional unit for co-expression of interleukin-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα) as a selection marker. We normally select for cells or cell clones expressing levels of exogenous proteins comparable with those of endogenous the proteins, to decrease the likelihood of protein-protein interaction being driven by overexpression of the target protein of interest. It should be noted, that while transcription of many genes are cell cycle dependent or regulated in response to cell state or external stimuli, transcription via the described vehicle is more constitutive. Therefore, alternative methods for generating stable or inducible expression can be used. We have successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce the FLAG-HA tag into the FANCD2 gene in its chromosomal location, an approach, which might be suitable for other genes (Lopez-Martinez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nA schematic of this protocol is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/481-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of protocol\nPreparation of retrovirus with packaging cells\nTiming: 30 min",
    "We use Phoenix-A cells (Phoenix-AMPHO or Phoenix-Amphotropic), a derivative of human 293T cells, for retrovirus packaging, yet supplemented with further Gag, Pol and Env viral proteins via transfection. Phoenix-A cells are grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. We normally keep the cells in culture for less than 2 months.\nFor one transfection, seed 120,000 cells in one well of a 6-well plate or a 6-cm dish (roughly 10% confluency).\nCritical: It is important to plate an appropriate amount of cells. Too few cells will yield low titer virus stock, and too many cells will deplete the nutrition in the medium, which negatively affects the viral transduction to follow.\nPrepare the transfection mixture in two separate microcentrifuge tubes. Tube No 1: Target plasmids and two helper plasmids\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_481_7.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_481_8.csv\nPipette the DNA mixture in Tube No 1 into Tube No 2, invert 5 times, and incubate at 20–25°C for 15–30 min.\nPipette the whole transfection mixture drop-wise into the well with Phoenix-A cells.\nGently rock the plate to help the transfection mixture disperse into the medium.\nLet the cells grow for 66–72 h.\nHarvest the retrovirus and pass the supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter.\nCritical: The color of the medium should be red/orange but not yellow. The Phoenix-A cells can be harvested and lysed for assessing expression level of protein of interest by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antibodies.\nPreparation of IL-2Rα antibody conjugated magnetic beads\nTiming: 30–60 min and 30 min\nFor using the IL-2Rα antibody conjugated magnetic beads in cell selection in the next section, the preparation is done in a sterile environment, e.g., laminar flow hood.\nPrepare 30 mL of 0.1% FBS in PBS (referred to as PBS/FBS).",
    "Aliquot 1.8 mL of Dynabeads Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Magnetic Beads into three 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (600 μL each).\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand for 2 min and gently remove the supernatant. Remove the tubes from the magnetic stand, and gently resuspend the beads with 1 mL PBS/FBS.\nRepeat the magnetic capturing and washing (step 10) twice. After the last wash, gently resuspend the beads with 600 μL PBS/FBS.\nDissolve 200 μg of lyophilized anti-IL-2Rα antibody (whole vial) with 600 μL of PBS/FBS. Transfer 20 μL to a separate tube, this is the “input” sample for later SDS- PAGE analysis of samples.\nAdd 200 μL of anti-IL-2Rα antibody to each tube of beads.\nIncubate the tubes on a slow rotator in the cold room for 12–16 h.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand for 2 min and gently transfer the supernatant to a 15-mL tube. This sample is considered “flow though.” Remove the tubes from the magnetic stand, and gently resuspend the beads with 1 mL PBS/FBS.\nRepeat the magnetic capturing and washing (step 15) three times, though without keeping the supernatant.\nFor each tube, resuspend the beads in 1 mL PBS/FBS supplemented with 50% glycerol. These are the “coupled beads.” Aliquot the beads in 200 μL per 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Store the beads at −20°C.\nAnalyze “input,” “flow through” as well as “coupled beads” by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie stain. IgG should be present in “input” and “coupled beads” samples, but not in the “flow through” sample.\nNote: Excessive freeze-thaw cycles will lead to dissociation of the IL-2Rα antibody from the magnetic beads.\nTransducing HeLa S3 cells with retrovirus and sorting for transduced cells\nTiming: 10–15 min and 1.5 h",
    "DMEM supplemented with 2.5%–10% FBS is used when HeLa S3 cells are grown as semi-adherent monolayer in cell culture dishes in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. We normally keep the cells in culture for less than 2 months.\nSupplement the retrovirus stock with 4 μg/mL of Hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene).\nDetach the HeLa S3 cells by treating the cells with PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, and pellet down roughly 200,000 cells in a 15 mL tube (188 × g, 20°C, 5 min).\nResuspend the cells with the virus stock and plate them in a 9 cm dish.\nLet the cells grow in the virus stock overnight (less than 24 h).\nNote: Polybrene is toxic to the cells. It is important to not leave the cells in medium with retrovirus and polybrene for longer than 24 h. Longer incubation can lead to increased cell death.\nCollect and centrifuge the supernatant (188 × g, 20°C, 5 min).\nNote: Normally there will be a portion of cells that remain partially adhered.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet with fresh supplemented DMEM, and plate the cells back in the 9 cm dish. Allow to grow in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 till the HeLa S3 cells reach 60%–80% confluency (66–72 h).\nDetach the transduced HeLa S3 cells by treating the cells with PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, and centrifuge (188 × g, 20°C, 5 min).\nNote: If trypsin was used, it is important not to over-trypsinize the cells. IL-2Rα, which is localized on the cell surface and used for sorting in the following step, could be damaged leading to ineffective sorting.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 1 mL fresh supplemented DMEM in a 1.5 mL microtube.",
    "Add 10 μL of 50% slurry IL-2Rα antibody conjugated magnetic beads (prepared in steps 8–18) to the cells and leave the tube on a roller at 20–25°C for 1 h.\nCritical: The incubation is to allow the IL-2Rα antibody conjugated magnetic beads to properly bind to the recombinant IL-2Rα on the cell surface. Do not leave the tube rolling for more than 1 h.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic stand for 2 min, and gently remove the supernatant. Remove the tube from the magnetic stand, and gently resuspend the cells with the beads with 1 mL fresh DMEM.\nCritical: Do not pipette vigorously or vortex the tube. The IL-2Rα antibody conjugated magnetic beads could detach from the cells due to shear force.\nRepeat the magnetic capturing and washing (step 28) twice.\nResuspend the cells with 1 mL supplemented DMEM and plate them into a 9 cm dish containing 9 mL of supplemented DMEM.\nAlternatives: the cells can be diluted with conditioned medium and plated on 96-well plate as single cell in each well to select for individual clones.\nNote: Due to the bi-cistronic expression of both the target gene and IL-2Rα, the number of magnetic beads bound to the cell surface could be used to assess the expression level of target gene prior to immunoblot analysis. It should be noted, that the ideal level of expression of the FLAG-HA-tagged protein is typically such that the level is comparable to that of the endogenous protein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Overexpression of the tagged protein can lead to abnormal cellular localization, spurious protein-protein interaction, and other artifacts.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/481-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Expression of FLAG-HA-tagged FANCD2 in HeLa cells\nFLAG-HA-tagged FANCD2 is expressed at levels comparable to endogenous FANCD2 in HeLa S3 cells. Immunoblot analysis.\nPreparation of nuclear extract from HeLa S3 cells",
    "Timing: 4.5 h\nThis part of the protocol is a modified version of an original protocol of cellular fractionation developed by the laboratory of Robert Roeder (Dignam et al., 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We introduced a DNA digestion step with Benzonase nuclease to reduce chromatin mediated interaction, and to permit purification of complexes associated with chromosomes. Furthermore, we introduced a formaldehyde fixation step adapted from other cell systems (Aparicio et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) to preserve weak protein-protein interactions, which otherwise could be lost during the purification. HeLa S3 cells are grown as suspension cultures in spinner flasks in an incubator at 37°C (no CO2 regulation required) using Joklik’s Modified MEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids (100× dilution) and penicillin-streptomycin (100× dilution). HeLa S3 cells are normally grown in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS in dishes as described in the previous section. To set up larger cultures in spinner flask, HeLa S3 cells from an 80% confluent 15 cm dish are detached and centrifuged as described in the previous section. The cells are resuspended in 50 mL supplemented Joklik’s medium and grown in a 125 mL spinner flask in a 37°C incubator. The color of the medium should change to orange (but not yellow) over time, and the culture is expanded by adding in equal volume of fresh supplemented Joklik’s medium to the same flask (or transferred to a larger spinner flask). The volume of the culture will double each day until the desired scale is reached. We optimized each step in the following nuclear extract preparation and purification of protein complexes with 1 L starting culture. Once optimal purification results were achieved, we scaled the experiment to 6 L culture. The following steps indicate volume used for 1 L starting culture.",
    "Note: The fractionation procedure is carried out at 4°C or on ice throughout. All the buffers are pre-chilled to 4°C and freshly supplemented with 0.2 mM PMSF and 2 mM β-ME.\nTreat the cells with 160 ng/mL Mitomycin C for 16 h.\nNote: This step is optional. The Mitomycin C treatment is to induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in the genome and to activate the ICL repair pathways. Alternative treatment, or using unperturbed cells, could be relevant.\nHarvest the cells by centrifuging the culture (1,800 × g, 4°C, 5 min) and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cell pellet by resuspending it with 50 mL cold PBS, centrifuge (1,800 × g, 4°C, 5 min) and discard the supernatant.\nEquilibrate the cell pellet with hypotonic buffer by resuspending the cell pellet with 2 mL of hypotonic buffer. Centrifuge (1,800 × g, 4°C, 5 min) and discard the supernatant.\nCritical: Do not leave the cells incubated in the hypotonic buffer at this step. Otherwise, the cells will start swelling, which will affect the efficiency of fractionation.\nResuspend and incubate the pellet in 4 mL (twice pellet volume) of hypotonic buffer on ice for 10 min.\nNote: The cells will be swollen at the end of the incubation. It is important to observe the changes of cell size under a microscope to confirm the efficiency of hypotonic treatment.\nTransfer the solution into a pre-chilled glass Dounce homogenizer on ice.\nUse a B type, tight pestle, with a clearance of 20–56 μm, to press up and down promptly and steadily for 10–20 cycles on ice.",
    "Critical: Dounce homogenizers can vary slightly, and different cell types will require varying amount of cycles. It is important to collect samples of cells before and after homogenization, and examine these under a microscope to evaluate the efficiency of cell membrane rupture, which should be above 90%. Continue homogenization until sufficient cell breakage is achieved. Insufficient rupture will lead to the cytoplasmic fraction from unbroken cells contaminating the nuclear fraction. On the other hand, excessive homogenization will result in breakdown of the nuclear envelope, leading to the loss of soluble nuclear proteins from nuclear fractions.\nCentrifuge the solution to pellet nuclei (3,300 × g, 4°C, 15 min).\nRemove the top lipid layer by inserting a clean pipette tip into the solution, which the lipid layer will adhere to.\nCytoplasmic fraction: Collect the supernatant as the cytoplasmic fraction and supplement with 11% of the volume of 10× S-100 buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_481_9.csv\nCentrifuge the cytoplasmic fraction (17,000 × g, 4°C, 30 min) and remove the lipid layer as described above.\nNote: The cytoplasmic fraction can be dialyzed against the desired buffer if needed for subsequent purification. In this protocol, we focus on isolating nuclear protein complexes.\nNuclear fraction with Benzonase digestion and formaldehyde fixation: Resuspend the nuclei in 1 mL (half of pellet volume) low-salt NE buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and 75 unit/mL Benzonase, and leave it incubating on ice for 30 min.\nNote: The amount of Benzonase added and the incubation time can be adjusted if needed. Digestion of chromosomal DNA can be monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nSupplement the mixture with formaldehyde to final concentration of 1% and incubate at 20–25°C for 4 min to crosslink the nuclei.\nNote: The nuclei solution will turn opaque and slightly clumpy after crosslinking.",
    "Quench the formaldehyde by adding 150 μL (1/20 volume) of 2.5 M Glycine pH 7.5 to the mixture.\nCentrifuge the mixture (3,000 × g, 4°C, 10 min) and discard the supernatant.\nWash the crosslinked nuclei by resuspending the nuclei with 10 mL (10 times pellet volume) of PBS, centrifuge (3,000 × g, 4°C, 10 min) and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 46 twice to wash the nuclei two more times.\nResuspend the crosslinked nuclei with 1 mL (same pellet volume) of high-salt NE buffer.\nNote: The protein complexes are now crosslinked and stabilized, so we can use extraction condition with high stringency without disrupting protein complexes.\nSonicate the crosslinked nuclei for 20 min (with 1 s on/off intervals) at 4 W power in an ice/water slurry bath.\nNote: The sample would normally turn clear after sonication, and the pellet from centrifugation (step 52) is small.\nNote: In addition to the Benzonase digestion, this sonication step renders chromatin DNA to smaller fragments.\nLeave the sonicated nuclei incubating on ice for 30 min.\nDilute the lysate 5-fold with 8 mL low-salt NE buffer supplemented with 125 mM NaCl and 1% Tween 20.\nNote: This dilution step is to lower the concentration of SDS from 0.15% to 0.03% and NaCl from 1 M to 300 mM to make it compatible with anti-FLAG M2 agarose used in the next stage.\nCentrifuge the solution (17,000 × g, 4°C, 20 min) and collect the supernatant as nuclear extract.\nPause Point: The protein complexes should be preserved by formaldehyde crosslinking (step 43). The nuclear extract can be snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for purification later.\nImmunoaffinity purification",
    "Sequential affinity purifications usually yield proteins of higher purity or, in this case, more pure protein complexes. However, the handling during sequential purification usually leads to loss of some interacting proteins, especially those with weaker affinities. With our modified nuclear extraction protocol, we are able to perform the sequential affinity purifications with higher stringency to reduce non-specific binding to the antibodies and matrixes while retaining the specific protein complexes. In this protocol, we purify FANCD2 sequentially via the FLAG and HA tags engineered at its N-terminus. Though using this protocol, we typically observe negligible level of contaminants (Socha et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), we recommend performing a parallel “mock” purification from cells not expressing a FLAG-HA-tagged protein, to assess the level of background binding proteins.\nThe purification is carried out at 4°C or on ice throughout.\nFLAG tag affinity purification\nTiming: 5 h\nAdd 250 μL bed volume of anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads to the 10 mL nuclear extract, and incubate the tube on a rotator at 10 rpm for 1.5–2 h at 4°C.\nNote: The amount of anti-FLAG M2 agarose used in the purification is determined empirically by monitoring the depletion of FANCD2 from the nuclear extract during purification. We use 250 μL bed volume of anti-FLAG M2 agarose for a 1 L HeLa S3 culture. When targeting different proteins with distinct expression level, it will require optimization.\nNote: Prior to use, the anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads are washed with 5 column volume (c.v.) of 100 mM glycine pH 2.5, 10 c.v. of ddH2O and 10 c.v. of buffer A. The glycine wash is to remove antibodies not crosslinked to the agarose matrix.\nNote: Anti-FLAG purification is performed in batch mode to improve the binding efficiency.",
    "Centrifuge the mixture (1,000 × g, 4°C, 5 min) and collect the supernatant as flow- through fraction of anti-FLAG purification step.\nResuspend the beads with 1 mL Buffer A and transfer the beads to a clean gravity-flow chromatography column.\nCarefully apply 10 mL Buffer A to wash the beads and repeat the washing step two more times.\nNote: The washing of the beads is more efficient if allowing most of the buffer to drip through before applying more buffer.\nCap the outlet and apply 250 μL (equal volume of the anti-FLAG beads) of Buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL FLAG peptide. Seal the top with parafilm and leave the column on a roller at 4°C for 1 h.\nNote: We perform the elution in batch because it allows FLAG peptide to compete away FLAG-tagged FANCD2 from anti-FLAG beads efficiently, helping to keep the volume of eluate low, thus more concentrated.\nCollect the FLAG eluate and repeat the elution (step 57) once more.\nNote: An extra elution can be performed, while we usually observe a decrease in concentration.\nPool all FLAG eluates.\nHA tag affinity purification\nTiming: 5 h\nOverall, the HA tag affinity purification is carried out similarly to the FLAG tag affinity purification described in the previous section with minor modifications. We generally use less anti-HA Sepharose beads comparing to the anti-FLAG M2 agarose used in the previous section. We use 0.5 mg/mL HA peptide for elution.\nAdd 60 μL bed volume anti-HA Sepharose beads to the FLAG eluate from the previous step, and incubate the tube on a rotator at 10 rpm for 2 h at 4°C.\nNote: Similarly to step 53, the necessary amount of anti-HA Sepharose needs to be determined empirically.",
    "Note: Prior to use, the anti-HA beads are washed and equilibrated as described for the anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads in step 53, the second Note.\nNote: We perform the anti-HA purification in batch because it provides better binding efficiency.\nCentrifuge the mixture (1,000 × g, 4°C, 5 min) and collect the supernatant as the flow-through fraction of the anti-HA purification step.\nResuspend the beads with 1 mL Buffer A and transfer the beads to a clean gravity-flow chromatography column.\nCarefully apply 5 mL Buffer A to wash the beads and repeat the washing step two more times.\nNote: The washing of the beads is more efficient if allowing most of the buffer to drip through before applying more buffer.\nCap the outlet and apply 60 μL (equal volume to the anti-HA beads) of Buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL HA peptide. Seal the top with parafilm and leave the column on a roller at 4°C for 1 h.\nNote: We perform the elution in batch because it allows HA peptide to compete away HA-tagged FANCD2 from anti-HA beads efficiently, which helps to keep the volume of eluate low with good concentration.\nAlternatives: the protein complexes can be eluted from the anti-HA Sepharose matrix with 0.1 M Glycine pH 2.5, followed by pH neutralization of the eluate by adding 1/5 volume of 1.5 M Tris pH 8.8 immediately after collecting the eluate. It is faster and more efficient using Glycine for elution. However, it could also elute proteins bound non-specifically to the matrix.\nCollect the HA eluate and repeat the elution (step 64) once more.\nNote: An extra elution can be performed, though we usually observe a decrease in the overall concentration as a result.\nReversion of formaldehyde crosslinks and sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis\nTiming: 3.5 h",
    "We reverse the formaldehyde crosslinks and alkylate our sample with Iodoacetamide prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Different mass spectrometry processes may require samples being processed differently after reversal of formaldehyde crosslinks.\nSupplement the HA eluate with 0.1% SDS and 5 mM DTT and incubate the sample at 95°C for 20 min to reverse the formaldehyde crosslinks.\nAlternatives: the HA eluate can be supplemented with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, incubate the samples at 95°C for 20 min, and load the samples onto SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie or silver staining for analysis.\nDilute the sample ten-fold with milli-Q water supplemented with 5 mM DTT and cool the sample on ice for 5 min.\nNote: The dilution is to prevent SDS from precipitating on ice at higher concentration. If some precipitants are formed, one could slightly warm up the sample till the precipitants are dissolved again.\nSupplement the sample with 15 mM Iodoacetamide and incubate the sample at 20–25°C protected from light for 20 min.\nNote: Iodoacetamide is light sensitive. It is important to protect the sample from light.\nSupplement the sample with 10 mM of DTT and incubate the sample at 20–25°C protected from light for 15 min.\nNote: The concentration of DTT at this step is 15 mM.\nSupplement the sample with 10% TCA by mixing equal volume of sample with 20% TCA and incubate the sample on ice 2–16 h, protected from light.\nCentrifuge the sample (17,000 × g, 4°C, 30 min) and discard the supernatant.\nRinse the pellet with −20°C 100% acetone gently, centrifuge the sample (17,000 × g, 4°C, 10 min) and discard the supernatant carefully.\nLet the pellet air-dry at 20–25°C.\nAnalyze the precipitated protein complexes by MS/MS."
