Transfer mature adult females (5–8 days old) from 6-8 bottles (see above) into the embryo collection cage (one cage per treatment). Use Yeast Extract–Peptone–Dextrose (YPD) plates to close the cage.\nNote: We use YPD plates to promote egg laying without supplementation of yeasts.\nKeep the flies on CO2 anesthetizing flypad for 1.5 min.\nRemove the cage from the anesthetizing apparatus and let the flies lay eggs on the YPD plate for 45 min - 1 h at 25°C.\nNote: This step (synchronization) allows flies to release the old eggs and avoid larval hatching prior to removal procedure of gut bacteria (step 3). Lack of synchronization can lead to bacterial contamination of the germ-free vials.\nRepeat steps 1 b and c (2nd synchronization).\nOptional: Change the laying plate to a new YPD plate for a 2nd round of laying.\nAnesthetize the flies in the cage, replace the synchronization plate to a new YPD plate and incubate for ∼3 h at RT to get the desired number of eggs.\nNote: The time of egg laying depends on the fly’s stock.\nDiscard the flies or keep them for recolonization treatment (see below).\nRemove flies that are stuck to the agar.\nPrepare control flies (flies with native bacteria intact).\nAdd double distilled water (DDW) to the plate with eggs (from step 1) and gently detach the eggs from the surface using a paint brush.",
    "Rinse the eggs, transfer them to the cell strainer (100 μm) and keep the strainer in the plate with DDW during the transfer procedure (step 2 c).\nNote: To maximize the collection of eggs from the plate, repeat steps 2 a, b.\nPick up (∼20–30) eggs on the tip of the paint brush and gently transfer them to the surface of sterile food in vials.\nNote: To prevent egg drying during the transfer, the strainer should be kept wet inside the 35 mm tissue culture plate.\nRemove gut bacteria by dechorionation to generate germ-free (GF) flies.\nAdd 3% sodium hypochlorite solution to the plate with eggs (from step 1), gently detach the eggs from the surface using a paint brush and incubate the eggs for 2 min.\nCollect the cells by transferring them through the cell strainer (100 μm).\nCollect the remaining eggs from the plate by washing the plate again with 70% ETOH and place the strainer into a 35 mm plate with 70% ETOH.\nIn the biological safety cabinet prepare one culture plate (35 mm) with sterile 70% ETOH and 3 culture plates (35 mm) with sterile DDW.\nTransfer the strainer with the eggs into a biological safety cabinet.\nUse forceps to place the strainer into a new culture plate with 70% ETOH.\nWash the eggs three times with sterile DDW. Each time transfer the cell strainer to a new plate with DDW.\nUse the paint brush to gently transfer dechorionated (∼20–30) eggs onto the surface of sterile food.\nRecolonize the eggs with native gut bacteria.\nPrepare vials with GF eggs, as described in step 3.\nTransfer five males (from step 1 d) to the vial with GF eggs.",
    "Let males “contaminate” the food with native gut bacteria for 1–2 days at 25°C, 60% humidity, 12 h light:12 h dark cycle controlled incubator and then discard them.\nIncubate all the vials (control and GF with and without recolonization) at 25°C, 60% humidity, 12 h light:12 h dark cycle controlled incubator and follow fly development (larval development, pupariation, and eclosion).\nNote: In GF flies, we expect a developmental delay of 1–2 days.\nTwo days after eclosion transfer newly emerged flies (day 0–2) into new vials and incubate for 5 more days at 25°C, 60% humidity in a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle controlled incubator.\nNote: GF flies should be transferred in the sterile conditions.\nOptional: Combine flies from 2 vials in 1 new vial.\nNote: It is recommended to keep the original vials for later test of germ-free conditions (step 8).\nCollect flies and tissue for subsequent analyses.\nCollect separately males and females into 2 mL Eppendorf tube, weigh and freeze immediately in a dry ice/liquid nitrogen.\nFor metabolic profiling: 40–50 flies per sample;\nFor targeted metabolomics: 10 flies per sample.\nTransfer to −80°C for storage.\nDissect ovaries:\nFor metabolic profiling: 40–50 ovaries per sample. Freeze immediately on dry ice.\nFor targeted metabolomics: 10 ovaries per sample. Freeze immediately on dry ice.\nFor staging: collect 15–20 ovaries to ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and proceed to DAPI staining (steps 9–21).\nCheck germ-free conditions of the food by plating food samples from the used vials on YPD plates.\nOptional: Confirm germ-free conditions using PCR with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers (for example, 8F and 939R oligonucleotides, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The PCR is performed on fly homogenate. Product size ∼940, annealing step at 60°C.",
    "Optional: Confirm the expected delay in larval development under germ-free conditions. Note that the removal of gut microbiota by dechorionation typically results in delayed pupation which depends on the choice of diet (Fridmann-Sirkis et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nAnalysis of ovarian development\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step enables evaluation of ovarian development by staging ovarian egg chambers. Number of mature oocytes in the ovary indicates the status of the oogenesis process.\nDissect 15–20 pairs of ovaries from each treatment and transfer them to the Eppendorf tube with 0.5 mL of PBSx1.\nLet the ovaries settle down and aspirate PBS.\nAdd 3.7% formaldehyde (FA) to fixate the ovaries and incubate for 20 min at 25°C with shaking (∼25–27 rpm).\nNote: Fixation solution must be prepared freshly before each use.\nLet the ovaries settle down, discard FA and wash twice with 1.5 mL PBS.\nPause point: The procedure can be paused at this point and the sample can be kept in 4°C for a few days.\nDiscard the PBS and incubate the ovaries with 0.5 mL 1% Triton (in PBS) for 30 min.\nWash twice with PBS. Discard the last wash and add 1 mL PBS.\nCollect the ovaries with Pasteur pipette and place them on microscope slide.\nPlace the ovaries in the center and carefully dry the liquid around them using disposable wipers.\nAdd one drop of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI.\nArrange the ovaries on the slide for imaging using forceps.\nUse pin holders to gently separate the ovarioles from each other, keeping the ovary intact and cover the slide with coverslip.\nTake images of the DAPI-stained ovaries using fluorescent inverted microscope (4× magnification).\nEvaluate ovarian development by scoring the number of egg chambers at different stages in each ovary (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Elgart et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Gnainsky et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1520-Fig1.jpg",

Data are represented as mean ± SEM.\nQuantitative analysis of energy-carrying molecules\nTiming: 4 days: 21 h for step 22, 21 h for step 23, 40 min for step 24, and 7.5 min per sample for step 25\nThis step aims at analyzing the microbiome impact on energy production by measuring the levels of energy-carrying molecules using quantitative LC-MS/MS. The protocol below describes the specific steps for ATP and ADP measurements (we also used this protocol for GTP and GDP).\nNote: Prepare fresh solutions on the day of use. Calculate the required volumes, taking into consideration the number of samples, dilutions, washes, etc.\nPreparation of sample extracts.\nAdd 1 mL of 70%-aqueous methanol (MeOH) to frozen flies/tissue (from step 7).\nNote: 70%-MeOH should be pre-chilled to ∼4°C before use (on ice or in a refrigerator).\nHomogenize tissue using handheld pestle motor mixer on ice for 1–2 min.\nPrepare 1 mM aqueous solution of internal standard 13C10-ATP.\nAdd 5 μL 1 mM aqueous solution of internal standard 13C10-ATP to each extract.\nAgitate the mixture in Thermo Mixer C at 9°C and 1,000 rpm for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min to pellet proteins and cell debris, and transfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, without disturbing the precipitate.\nEvaporate the supernatant using a speedvac.\nNote: To remove MeOH usually takes ∼2 h.\nFreeze the residual aqueous solution by immersing Eppendorf’s bottom in liquid nitrogen for 1 min.",
    "Place frozen sample in the freeze dryer for complete evaporation overnight (∼18 h).\nPause point: Evaporated extract can be stored at −80°C for at least two weeks.\nAlternatives: MeOH evaporation can be performed by a stream of nitrogen gas at 25°C.\nCritical: Organic solvents, such as MeOH are highly toxic. The use of these agents should be performed in a fume hood. During speedvac evaporation of these organic solvents, the exhaust of the vacuum pump should be drawn to the fume hood or to exhaust of a proper scavenging line.\nPurification of extracts by Solid-phase extraction (SPE).\nNote: Purification of nucleotides on polymeric weak anion column is required to remove all other components of the sample that significantly reduce signal intensity in mass spectrometer (matrix effect).\nPrepare following solutions:\n1 mM aqueous solution of internal standard 13C10-ATP.\nDDW.\nMethanol (MeOH).\n50%-aqueous MeOH.\nFormic acid/MeOH/DDW (2:25:73 v/v/v).\nAmmonia/MeOH/DDW (8:25:67 v/v/v).\nNote: Ammonia is 25%-aqueous ammonia solution.\nAmmonia/MeOH/DDW (8:50:42 v/v/v).\nCondition SPE column.\nPlace the column on a vacuum manifold.\nAdd 1 mL MeOH and let it flow through the column at a rate of about 1 mL/min.\nAdd 1 mL formic acid/MeOH/DDW (2:25:73, v/v/v), and let it flow at the same rate.\nWash the column with 1 mL DDW at the same rate flow.\nPurify the sample.\nAdd 200 μL water to re-suspend the sample pellet, vortex shortly. Load the suspension onto the SPE column, let it flow through at about 0.5 mL/min.\nWash the column with 1 mL water, then with 1 mL 50% MeOH at about 1 mL/min.\nElute the sample with 1 mL ammonia/MeOH/water (8:25:67, v/v/v), and then 1 mL ammonia/MeOH/water (8:50:42, v/v/v) (see preparation in 23 a), collecting the eluates.\nEvaporate the collected elutes as described in steps 22 g–i.",
    "Critical: Use flows as drops and not as stream to avoid reduction in metabolite recovery and purification quality.\nNote: If there is no liquid flow in steps b and c, use a slight vacuum suction to initiate the process.\nPause point: Evaporated extract can be stored at −80°C for at least 2 weeks.\nGenerating a standard curve.\nPrepare Mobile phase A: 10 mM ammonium acetate and 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.65 (adjusted with 10% acetic acid).\nPrepare Mobile phase B: acetonitrile.\nPrepare ATP and ADP standard solutions for the standard curve:\nDissolve pre-weighted amounts of ATP and ADP in DDW to get 1 mg/mL solutions of each.\n50 μg/mL (Stock solution): Mix 5 μL of each 1 mg/mL solution with 95 μL DDW.\n25 μg/mL (Solution I): Dilute 50 μL of each 50 μg/mL stock solution with 50 μL DDW.\n2.5 μg/mL (Solution II): Dilute 10 μL of each 25 μg/mL solution with 90 μL of DDW.\n0.25 μg/mL (Solution III): Dilute 10 μL of 2.5 μg/mL solution with 90 μL of DDW.\n10 μg/mL standard solution: Add 40 μL of Solution I to 50 μL of mobile phase A (step 24), add 10 μL of 1 mM internal standard 13C10-ATP (step 23 a i).\n5 μg/mL standard solution: Add 20 μL of Solution I to 70 μL of mobile phase A (step 24), add 10 μL of 1 mM internal standard 13C10-ATP (step 23 a i).\n1 μg/mL standard solution: Add 40 μL of Solution II to 50 μL of mobile phase A (step 24), add 10 μL of 1 mM internal standard 13C10-ATP (step 23 a i).",
