    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing the enteric bacterial challenge\nTiming: 10 min\nPreparation of the bacterial suspension for inoculation into the mouse formula is based on the intestinal microbiota obtained from the enteric contents of an infant with the most severe form of NEC, NEC totalis (Good et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Mihi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The enteric bacterial stock was generated by overnight (16 h) culturing of the fecal slurry in the resected intestinal tissue from an infant with NEC totalis. The bacteria culture was then centrifuged, resuspended in 50% glycerol, aliquoted in cryovials and stored at −80°C.\nThe day before initiating the model, use a sterile pipette tip to scrape approximately 10 μL of an enteric bacterial glycerol stock from a frozen cryovial.\nPlace the sterile pipette tip containing the bacterial aliquot into a 15-mL culture tube containing 2 mL of LB Broth. Culture the bacteria overnight (16 h) in an orbital shaker at 37°C with agitation speed at 150 rpm.\nA control culture tube with 2 mL of sterile LB broth should also be cultured simultaneously in the orbital shaker to ensure there is no concern for bacterial contamination of the LB broth.\nPreparing the formula and allocating pups into experimental groups\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following morning, transfer 100 μL of the bacterial culture into four T75 culture flasks each containing 20 mL LB broth.\nCulture this inoculum for a minimum of two hours in an orbital shaker with agitation speed at 150 rpm at 37°C.\nAt 7 AM on the first day of the model, in the animal facility, weigh the postnatal day 4 pups to be included in the model and randomly assign the animals into two experimental groups: dam-fed and formula-fed.",
    "For the dam-fed group, allow the mouse pups to remain with the mother for the full duration of the model. These pups will be served as dam-fed negative controls.\nFor the formula-fed group, separate the pups from the mother into a new cage and place the cage into a pre-warmed infant incubator at 37°C. This group will be housed in the incubator for the full duration of the model.\nUse a spectrophotometer to measure the density of the two-hour bacterial culture at 600 nm (OD600nm). Add 1 mL of sterile LB broth into a 1 cm cuvette and measure the OD600nm to serve as the blank. In a separate 1 cm cuvette, add 1 mL of the inoculum and measure the OD600nm.\nNote: The OD600nm value should be 0.6 ± 0.02, corresponding with the exponential phase of bacterial growth.\nNote: If the OD600nm is greater than 0.6, use LB broth to dilute the culture until the diluted culture results in a goal OD600nm. If the OD600nm is less than 0.6, continue to culture the inoculum until the OD600nm reaches 0.6.\nOnce the inoculum has achieved the goal OD600nm, transfer 20 mL of the inoculum from each culture flask into separate 50-mL conical tubes and centrifuge at 3000 × g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the bacterial pellets each in 1 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a 50-mL conical tube.\nAdd 4 mL of the total resuspended bacteria into 20 mL of NEC formula (comprised of a 2:1 ratio of Similac Advance formula to Esbilac puppy milk) in a 50-mL conical tube.",
    "Using the average weight of the pups from the morning, add 5 μg/g lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the NEC formula. LPS serves as a ligand for innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 signaling, which has been shown to be required for the development of NEC via impairment of the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (Mihi and Good, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: The addition of both enteric bacteria and LPS to the NEC formula is necessary for the induction of NEC-like pro-inflammatory response in this model.\nNote: This NEC formula with LPS contains the volume to be used for 6 feeds per 24-h period, with the first feeding timed for 10 AM on day 1 of the model and newly made formula at 10AM on days 2–3 of the model.\nInduction of experimental NEC\nTiming: 3 days\nPerform scheduled feedings of the mouse pups beginning at 10 AM on Day 1 of the model. Fill a 1-mL syringe with NEC formula and attach it to a 1.9 French single-lumen PICC line.\nProvide the mouse pups with oral gavage feedings of the NEC formula.\nGently hold the pup by grasping the loose skin at the base of the neck and use forceps to grasp the distal end of the PICC line to gently introduce 2 cm of the PICC into the oropharynx and esophagus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1169-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of insertion of the PICC line into the oropharynx and esophagus for delivery of NEC formula\nUsing forceps, the PICC line is gently inserted 2 cm for delivery of NEC formula into the stomach of the mouse pup. Figure created with biorender.com[href=http://biorender.com].\nThere should be no significant resistance with the insertion of the PICC line.\nSlowly dispense 80 μL of NEC formula into the stomach.",
    "Then slowly withdraw the PICC line from the oral cavity.\nMonitor the animal for increased respiratory effort or emesis associated with a malpositioned PICC line.\nNote: In our model, mouse pup feedings occur at 7 AM (starting on model day 2), 10 AM, 1 PM, 4 PM, 7 PM and 10 PM. Repeat step 12 at each of these time points.\nTwice daily, immediately following the 1 PM and 7 PM feedings, subject the mouse pups to hypoxia.\nPlace the pups in a hypoxia chamber connected to a gas tank containing 95% nitrogen and 5% oxygen for 10 min.\nCarefully monitor the mouse pups for signs of apnea, cyanosis or pale discoloration, or abdominal distension in between feeds. Pups that present with these signs should be immediately euthanized per IACUC policy.\nAt 3 PM on model days 1 and 2, prepare the bacterial culture for the next day, as described in steps 3 and 4, in order to prepare and provide NEC formula for the full duration of the model.\nOn model days 2 and 3, at 7 AM, obtain the daily weight of each pup to identify the daily average weight of the pups in each group and then provide oral gavage feeding using the formula prepared from the day prior.\nBe sure to first invert the 50-mL conical gently several times while avoiding the formation of air bubbles in the formula.\nPrepare the new daily NEC formula as in steps 6–10. Perform scheduled oral gavage feedings and hypoxia exposure per steps 11–13 to complete the 72-h mouse model of NEC.\nSacrificing animals and harvesting tissue\nTiming: 10 min per animal",
    "On the morning of model day 4, obtain the daily weight of each pup. Euthanize the pups in accordance with IACUC and institutional policies. Make a vertical incision along the abdominal wall to expose the gastrointestinal tract.\nLocate and resect the intestine from the duodenum to the distal rectum. Place the intestine in a petri dish containing ice-cold PBS. Isolate the desired segments of the intestine for tissue collection and processing.\nNote: This model focuses primarily on pathology within the ileum. The terminal part of the ileum, which is approximately 3 cm from the cecum, is resected. A small piece of the terminal ileum (1 cm) is placed in RNA-laterTM for transcriptional analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Another small piece of terminal ileum (1 cm) is snap-frozen in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and kept frozen at −80°C for protein analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: For analysis of intestinal microbial communities, mouse fecal contents can be collected for 16s rRNA microbial analysis (Mihi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Locate and resect the intestine at the proximal colon, adjacent to the cecum and place the tissue on a clean surface. Using forceps, gently press on the exterior of the colon to allow fecal contents to pass along to the distal end of the intestinal lumen for collection. Fecal samples should be snap-frozen in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and stored at −80°C for later 16s rRNA microbial sequencing (Mihi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Mouse pups subjected to experimental NEC will exhibit an intestinal microbiome with an overabundance of Gammaproteobacteria species similar to human infants with NEC (Mihi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Nolan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1169-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(A–C) During postmortem dissection, segment (A) of the terminal ileum is collected for transcriptional analysis, segment (B) is collected for protein analysis and segment (C) is resected for histological study. Figure created with Biorender.com[href=http://Biorender.com].\nPreparation of intestines for cross-sectional histological analysis\nTiming: 5 min per animal\nThe remaining segment of the terminal ileum (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) is flushed with PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) using a 24-gauge gavage needle.\nThe tissue segment is transected longitudinally using fine scissors, doused in 4% PFA, and transferred to a container for immersion in 4% PFA for fixation. After 24 h at 4°C, discard the PFA and wash with PBS twice for 15 min.\nDiscard the PBS and then dehydrate with 50% ethanol for 15 min and then 70% ethanol for storage prior to embedding.\nNote: The fixation, wash and dehydration steps should be carried out at 4°C on a rocker.\nThe intestinal specimens are then carefully embedded in agar first and then paraffin. Tissue sections are cut on a microtome at 5-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological study.\nTissue processing for transcriptional analysis\nTiming: 4 h\nFor RNA isolation from the transected terminal small intestine, add 1 mL TRIzolTM to the resected intestinal tissue stored in RNA Later (Invitrogen).\nAdd one steel bead per tube and homogenize the tissue using the Qiagen TissueLyser for 7 min at 50 oscillations per second.\nOnce the tissue is completely homogenized, remove the steel bead, and add 200 μL of chloroform.\nVigorously invert the tube ten times and allow the samples to incubate at 68–77°F (20°C–25°C) for five minutes.\nCentrifuge the samples for 10 min at 18,000×g and 4°C.\nThe solution will separate into three layers: a top aqueous layer, a white middle layer, and a bottom pink layer of Trizol.",
    "Transfer 500 μL of the aqueous layer into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 500 μL of isopropanol and 3 μL glycogen, and gently invert the sample 10 times.\nIncubate the samples at -20°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the samples for 10 min at 18000×g and 4°C. Decant the supernatant and add 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol to each sample.\nCentrifuge the samples for 5 min at 18000×g and carefully decant the supernatant.\nCentrifuge the samples again for 1 min at 18000×g. Remove the remaining ethanol with a fine-tip pipette and allow the samples to air dry for at least 15 min.\nWhen the pellet appears transparent, add 50 μL of RNase-free water and allow the pellets to hydrate for approximately 10 min.\nVortex the samples and measure the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer before storing the samples at −80°C.\nUse the Qiagen QuantiTec Reverse Transcription Kit to synthesize the complementary DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol: https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=f0de5533-3dd1-4835-8820-1f5c088dd800&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=f0de5533-3dd1-4835-8820-1f5c088dd800&lang=en].\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is performed using IQ SYBR Green Supermix and CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories).\nThe CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System utilizes a two-step amplification process by heating the samples to 95°C for five minutes, then alternating between 95°C for ten seconds and 55°C for 30 s, repeated for 40 cycles as described in the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000068707.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000068707.pdf].\nThe primers are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], and a melting curve was added to the amplification protocol to ensure the absence of primer dimer formation or multiple amplicons.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1169_1.csv\nThe expression of genes assessed by qRT-PCR was quantified relative to the housekeeping gene RPLO."
