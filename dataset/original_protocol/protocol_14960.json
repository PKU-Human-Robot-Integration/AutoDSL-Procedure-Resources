    "Ethics statement\nThe experiments reported in this video were conducted in accordance with national guidelines for the use of experimental animals and the protocols were approved by the German governmental committees (Regierung von Oberbayern, Munich, Germany). 10 week old, male C57Bl/6J mice are used in this study. The animals were housed under controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C), with a 12 hr light-dark cycle period and access to pelleted food and water ad libitum. Analgesia and sedation protocols are described as approved by the local governmental committee but might differ from protocols used in other laboratories.\n1. Preparation of the Material and Instruments\nConnect the heat blanket in order to maintain the operation area warm and maintain the mouse body temperature during anesthesia (37 °C).\nPrepare autoclaved scissors, forceps and cottons, dexpanthenol eye ointment and suture material. Prepare a syringe with saline solution (without needle) to maintain the operation area hydrated. Prepare the anesthesia gas (70% N2O + 30% O2 + isoflurane).\nInject analgesics intraperitoneally: Metamizol 200 mg/kg, Carprofen 4 mg/kg and Buprenorphin 0.1 mg/kg.\nPlace the mouse into the induction chamber with an isoflurane flow rate of 4% to anesthetize it until spontaneous movement of body and vibrissae stops.\nTransfer the mouse in lateral position with its nose into the anesthesia mask and maintain isoflurane concentration at 4% for approximately another minute, then reduce and it at approx.1.5% to maintain appropriate anesthesia.\nApply dexpanthenol eye ointment on both eyes. \n2. Distal MCAO Model\nMake a 1 cm skin incision between the ear and eye using little operation scissors after aseptical preparation of the surgical site using skin disinfectant.\nSeparate the skin and localize the temporal muscle.\nSelect in the high frequency generator the coagulation function, bipolar mode, select 12 W and connect the electrocoagulation forceps with the cable.",
    "Add a drop of saline and use the forceps to detach the temporal muscle from the skull in its apical and dorsal part, thereby, making a muscle flap without totally removing the muscle.\nIdentify the MCA below the transparent skull, in the rostral part of the temporal area, dorsal to the retro-orbital sinus (Figure 2A). If the MCA bifurcation is not visible (due to an anatomical normal variation) identify the vessel most rostral.\nAdd some saline on the skull and thin out the bone with the drill right above the MCA branch until it has a thin and translucent texture (Figure 2B).\nCarefully withdraw the bone above the artery with a very thin forceps.\nSelect bipolar mode in the high frequency generator at 7 W. Coagulate the artery with the electrocoagulation forceps proximal and distal to the bifurcation (Figure 2C). When the bifurcation is not visible due to an anatomical variant, coagulate the correctly identified MCA branch (see above) at two sites of approx. 1mm distance. It is not necessary to grasp the artery with the forceps for coagulation, touching the artery carefully with the forceps on both sides from above is sufficient and induces less mechanical damage.\nWait 30 sec and gently touch the artery with a blunted forceps to check for any blood flow due to spontaneous recanalization. In case of recanalization repeat the electrocoagulation once.\nRelocate the temporal muscle to its position, covering the burr hole.\nSuture the wound and place the animal in a nursing box at 32 °C to recover from anesthesia and return it to the cage. In general it takes 5-10 min for the animal to recover from anesthesia.\nInject postoperative analgesia (i.p.) after 24 hr and then daily until the fifth postoperative day: Carprofen 4 mg/kg.\n3. Sham Operation",
    "Perform all procedures identically to the operation described above – including thinning of the skull and its removal – except for not coagulating the exposed artery.\n4. Cylinder Test13\nPlace the animal in a transparent acrylic glass cylinder (diameter: 8 cm; height: 25 cm) in front of two mirrors and videotape for 5 min. Adjust the camera centrally in front of the two mirrors and the cylinder to obtain an optimal video (Figure 3A).\nFor assessment of independent forelimb use, score (1) contact of the cylinder wall with one forelimb during full rear and (2) landing with only one forelimb on floor after full rear. Count at least 20 contacts for one forelimb using slow motion or frame-by-frame function of the Video Lan Client (VLC) freeware software (http://www.videolan.org/vlc[href=http://www.videolan.org/vlc]).\nFor baseline analysis before surgery: perform the test twice per mouse, with a 1 hr break between trials. Forelimb use is expressed as a ratio of right/left-sided, independent forelimb use.\nAfter the MCA coagulation: perform the test again twice per mouse, with a 1 hr break between trials as indicated above.\n5. Perfusion\nAnaesthetize the animals (e.g., by ketamine and xylazine 120/16 mg/kg body weight, respectively).\nFix the animal in a supine position and open the abdominal cavity with a median cut. Remove rips and sternum. Make a small incision in the right atrium. Insert a perfusion cannula in the left ventricle and slowly perfuse with 20 ml of saline.\nDecapitate the animal, open the calvaria and gently detach the brain from the base of the skull.\nFreeze the brains in -40 °C cold isopentane for 10 min. Afterwards remove the brains from the isopentane and store until further analysis at -80 °C.\n6. Infarct Volumetry",
    "Cryosectioning: Cut the brains serially on a cryostat to 20 µm thick sections every 400 µm on slides and store the slides at -20 °C.\nCresyl violet (CV) staining:\n\t\nPrepare the staining solution: Mix 0.5 g of CV acetate in 500 ml H2O. Stir and heat (60 °C) until crystals are dissolved. Let the solution cool and store in a dark bottle. Reheat to 60 °C and filter before every use.\nDry the slides at RT for 30 min. Then place them in 95% ethanol for 15 min and then in 70% ethanol for 1 min and afterwards in 50% ethanol for 1 min.\nPlace the slides in distilled water for 2 min, refresh distilled water and place them in for 1 min. Afterwards place the slides in staining solution (60 °C) for 10 min and wash them twice in distilled water for 1 min.\nPlace the slides in 95% ethanol for 2 min. Then place them into 100% ethanol for 5 min, refresh the 100% ethanol and place them in for 2 min. Afterwards cover the slides with mounting medium.\nAnalysis:\n\t\tScan the slides and analyze the indirect infarct volume by the Swanson method14 to correct for edema:\n\t\t(Ischemic area) = (Cortex area of contralateral side) – (Non-ischemic cortex area of ipsilateral side) (Figure 4A)."
