  "procedures": [
    "The Institutional Review Board of the University approved this research.\nNOTE: An example of mixed methods using the enactive phenomenological protocol.\n1. Exclusion Criteria\nUse a questionnaire before the experiment in order to exclude some participants, as necessary, on the following criteria: smoking (over five cigarettes per day), drinking (over two glasses of alcohol per day), taking medication, using drugs, having an endocrine problem, experiencing chronic stress (e.g., as determined by the French version of the Perceived Stress Scale [PSS])33, and experiencing psychological distress (e.g., as determined by the French version of the General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12])34.\n2. Preliminary Instructions\nNOTE: The following preliminary instructions need to be given 1 day before the experimentation.\nTell the participants not to take any medication, perform physical exercises, or consume alcohol the day before the test.\nTell the participants to wake up at least 3 h before the test.\nTell the participants to not drink or eat anything, smoke, or brush their teeth 1 h before the test.\n3. Pretest Measurements\nNOTE: The protocol presented in this section was used in the earlier publication mentioned in the introduction13. Prestress measurements can be done after an inactive wait of 45 min10; also, the first point of measure can be done 20 min before the TSST35.\nFirst saliva collection\n\tNOTE: Salivary cortisol is commonly used as a physiological marker of stress with the TSST9,36.\n\t\nUse the passive drool method: ask the participant to tilt their head forward to allow saliva to pool in their mouth, and instruct them to guide it into a small polypropylene tube.\nFreeze the tube immediately at -20 °C.\nFirst questionnaire collection\nMeasure the participant's anxiety. Ask them to fill out the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)37 questionnaire.",
    "NOTE: STAI is an example of a questionnaire that can be used to measure anxiety. It is a Likert scale with a range of four options (1 = not at all, 4 = very much so); using this range, participants were asked to respond to 12 items (e.g., \"I feel tense\"). A composite variable was constructed with the scores of all items.\nMeasure the participant's emotional state. Ask them to fill out the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)38 questionnaire.\n\t\tNOTE: SAM is a Likert scale that uses a nonverbal pictorial technique with nine figures to evaluate pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Participants have to circle a figure for each item.\nThen, bring the participant into the TSST room.\n4. Performance of the TSST or the TSST-G\nNOTE: Different aspects of the TSST have already been described in other JoVE articles10,12,39.\nProtocol context\nPosition the participant in the protocol room on a red cross drawn on the floor.\nQuestion the participants one by one for the TSST.\nUse a group of participants (e.g., six participants separated by little walls to limit social and visual interaction13) for the TSST-G.\nEnsure that the experimenters (two or three) are neutral and look like scientists with white lab coats.\nExplain that the committee members are specialists in nonverbal behavior analysis and all actions are filmed for future analysis.\nMock job interview\nAsk the participant to imagine a job of their choice.\nGive the participant 3 min of preparation time (10 min for the TSST-G).\nSpecify that preparation notes cannot be used during the interview.\nGive the participant 5 min of presentation time (2 min for the TSST-G, performed in random order) in front of the committee to explain why they are the best candidate for this job.",
    "Tell the participant to continue when they stop talking by saying \"You still have time remaining.\"\nRemain silent for 20 s when that participant stops talking for the second time.\nAsk standardized questions if the participant does not resume speaking (e.g., \"Please list your weaknesses.\").\nMental arithmetic task\nAsk the participant to count aloud backward from 2023 in steps of 17. For the TSST-G, the numbers are different for each participant.\nExplain the participant they must calculate as quickly and correctly as possible.\nPoint out each mistake and tell the participant to start all over again.\nMake sure the task lasts 5 min (80 s for the TSST-G, performed in random order).\n5. Posttest Measurements\nNOTE: Then, collect a second saliva sample and let the participant complete questionnaires in another room (same process as the first collections, described in section 3 of this protocol).\nSecond saliva collection\n\tNOTE: The measurement of cortisol levels is repeated (6 to 9 times) to analyze the cortisol response.\n\t\nFollowing the passive drool method, collect saliva from the participant into a small polypropylene tube, as described previously (step 3.1.1).\nFreeze the tube immediately at -20 °C.\nSecond questionnaire collection\nMeasure the anxiety. Ask the participant to fill out the STAI37 questionnaire.\n\t\tNOTE: STAI is a Likert scale with a range of four items (1 = not at all, 4 = very much so); using this range, participants responded to 12 items (e.g., \"I feel tense\"). A composite variable was constructed with the scores of all items.\nMeasure emotional states. Ask the participant to fill out the SAM38 questionnaire.\n\t\tNOTE: SAM is a Likert scale that uses a nonverbal pictorial technique with nine figures to evaluate pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Participants have to circle a figure for each item.\n6. Qualitative Investigations",
    "Use a wide-angle camera to record the participant's behavior and their interaction during the TSST or the TSST-G.\nConduct enactive interviews to access the participant's experience.\n\t\nPerform the interview as soon as possible after the performance of the TSST or the TSST-G to ensure the participant still remembers (preferably within 48 h).\nExplain that the participant must relive the past activities, helped by their own audio-visual record of the TSST or the TSST-G. Avoid stating the precise aim of the experiment to the participant.\nSelect an experienced rater who is used to conducting enactive interviews.\nConfront the participant with their own recording to help them relive the experience as close as possible.\nAsk directive questions to help the re-emergence of the past experience. For instance, point at an image from the video and ask: \"What are you doing here?\"\nHelp the participant to remember with questions focused on the video to allow them to describe, comment on, and show their lived experience step by step: \"What is happening here on the video?\"\nInvestigate the experience's components as intentions and perceptions by asking: \"What were your intentions here?\", \"What did you perceive at this precise moment?\"\nStop the participant if they use global discourse, a posteriori analysis, or generalization, or when they digress from the precise moment that is being discussed, as suggested for phenomenological research40.\nAsk follow-up questions based on the participant's response. For example, when the participant says: \"I am out\", ask \"What does 'I am out' mean?\" and, then, continue to investigate what happens from the participant's point of view.\nRespect the time sequence of the video and avoid changing the time-flow to access the dynamics of the experience step by step.\nAllow the participant to pause the video when they want to describe their own experience.",
    "7. Data Analysis\nPerform a saliva analysis.\n\t\nDetermine the participant's cortisol level by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using assay kits (see Table of Materials).\nMeasure the concentration related to the absorbance at 450 nm with a 96-well microplate spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials).\nCalculate the intra-assay precision with the average value of individual variability for all of the duplicates within each microplate.\nObtain concentrations of unknown samples (nmol/L) with a four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit, following the ELISA kit protocol recommendations, based on cortisol standards (82.77, 27.59, 9.19, 3.06, 1.02, 0.33 nmol/L).\nPerform a statistical analysis using repeated measures ANOVAs with a level of significance at p < 0.05.\nCalculate the effect sizes with a partial eta squared.\n\t​NOTE: Eta squared is a statistical measure of effect size for use in ANOVA.\nPerform a phenomenological analysis.\n\t\nTranscribe all the enactive interviews with the maximum of detail, such as verbal clutter, demonstration, hesitation, etc.\nConstruct a two-part table that outlines the time flow, transcription, and a report of the behaviors and discussion helped by the recordings (Table 1).\nIdentify components of the experience, beginning with the elementary units of meaning corresponding to the smallest units of activity meaningful to a participant.\nIdentify perception, analyzing the meaningful sensation, sentiment, and informational aspects (visual, acoustic, or kinesthetic) in the situation.\nIdentify intention, analyzing the participant's concern in the situation.\nCategorize sequences by grouping units of meaning related to the same story.\nFor each participant, identify their typical experience descriptively, statistically, generatively, and significantly21 (e.g., typical action, typical intention, and typical perception).\nIdentify the typical experiences of all the participants, finding similarities between each typical experience.\nConstruct tables of typical experience for all the participants, using the following values: timeline, typical sequences, typical perceptions, typical actions, and typical intentions.",
    "Normalize the formulation of each category using a group of words to express the typical sequence, an \"ing\" for the typical action, and an infinitive verb for the typical intention.\nCompare the TSST and the TSST-G using the two tables of typical lived experience.\nPresent the common aspects of experience during both protocols.\nPresent the singular aspects of experience during each protocol.\nPerform a case study analysis to understand the local processes, for example, the four lowest and highest cortisol responders.\n\t\nIdentify the components of the experience (see the preceding protocol).\nRebuild the meaningful experience for each participant following the TSST or the TSST-G steps.\nCompare the mixed methods.\n\t\nCompare the quantitative and qualitative results conducting analyses and interpretation separately (cortisol, state anxiety, emotional states, experience data).\nVerify whether the quantitative analysis' results of the stress dynamics are similar to those of the qualitative analysis.\nAnalyze whether what happened in the participants' experiences can help in understanding quantitative stress variation.\nSubscription Required.
