  "procedures": [
    "This protocol was approved by the institution's human research ethics committee; written consent was obtained for acquiring and publishing anonymized images. Never substitute a traditional maneuver, such as auscultating, for an ultrasound image (they can be done simultaneously or alternately by different operators). The consolidated core steps for a critically Ill newborn are a rapid series of supportive actions that need to be remembered as the POCUS team assesses the patient. Always have a second member of the POCUS team securing the endotracheal tube (ETT). Adapt the scanning to the patient's needs without interfering with resuscitation maneuvers.\n1. Ultrasound preparation, specification, and settings14\nDisinfect the transducer and connecting lines to prevent healthcare-associated infections.\n\t​NOTE: Always disinfect the equipment before and after use in case of an emergency.\nPrepare an HEUE or HHD depending on the situation. See Table 1 for general settings.\nClick on image store after each step on the console or menu on the electronic tablet. Ensure that the imaging obtained is linked to the patient identifier once the emergency is under control.\n2. Newborn handling\nCall for help, access the equipment needed for clinical support, and provide warmth (use prewarmed gel).\nAssess airways: Position the infant's head in a neutral position, clear the airway of secretions, and nest the infant whenever possible.\nOxygen: Administer oxygen as needed to maintain an SpO2 of 90%-95%, or an FiO2 of 100% if the infant is in cardiac arrest.\nMonitor the newborn: Place a pulse oximeter on the infant's right hand, attach cardiopulmonary leads, and use a blood pressure monitor and a cuff of the correct size.\nObtain the HR, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and axillary temperature8. Obtain point-of-care blood gas analysis (PCBGA) with glucose and calcium.",
    "NOTE: Glucose and calcium disturbances may present as hemodynamic decompensation. The transition from carbohydrate-dependent to fatty acid-dependent metabolism occurs in the first few weeks of life15. In premature infants, contraction depends on the flow of extracellular calcium into the cell as the sarcoplasmic reticulum is physically apart from the L-type channels, the transverse tubules are not present, and the myocytes have a higher surface area to volume ratio16.\n3. Verify intubation using the HEUE/HHD in cricothyroid membrane view\nHEUE/HHD\n\t\nSelect the linear array probe (HEUE 8-18 MHz, HHD 7.5-10 MHz), and press Small Parts on the console or the menu on the electronic tablet.\nPlace the linear transducer, with the notch facing to the right, anteriorly on the neck at the level of the cricothyroid membrane (have a second person take care of the airway). Adjust the scanning depth to 2-4 cm.\nLocate the two thyroid lobes at the level of the cricoid. Identify the outline of the ETT (double rail image, also described as the \"comet head and tail\")17; observe the ETT in situ, generating a posterior shadow (air-mucosa interface with posterior reverberation and shadowing artifacts). Observe the esophagus on the left of the screen (usually collapsed).\n\t\tNOTE: If the esophagus is dilated with a posterior shadow, this may correspond to esophageal intubation (\"double tract\" sign) or a nasal or oral gastric tube (Figure 2).\nVerify the depth of the ETT with the weight + 6 formula18.\nPerform a longitudinal lung ultrasound (LUS); check for adequate bilateral pleural sliding, the presence of parenchymal signs (B-Lines, consolidation), and the absence of a lung pulse (explained later in the text).",
    "​NOTE: If the patient is being intubated at the time, ultrasound may help in identifying the correct position of the tube after the procedure as previously described, or it can help to observe the tracheal and surrounding tissue movement associated with intubation, the double rail image depicting the ETT in the trachea, and the appearance of the posterior acoustic shadowing in real time. If the patient does not have a nasal or oral gastric tube, and the \"double tract\" sign is identified, this reflects esophageal intubation.\n4. Verifying the ETT depth (HEUE) with the aortic arch suprasternal view\nSelect the phased array probe (6-12 MHz).\nPress Neonatal Cardiac mode.\nAdjust the scanning depth to 4-6 cm so the complete aortic arch is seen, and open the complete sector width, as it is needed to identify the ETT and aortic arch in one plane.\nObtain a suprasternal view with the notch by looking at 1-2 o'clock and moving clockwise on a coronal plane until the view of the ETT and the aortic arch is seen.\nMeasure the distance from the ETT tip, and ensure it is 0.5-1 cm from the upper border of the aortic arch (Figure 3).\n\t\nOnly if the conditions permit, have an experienced sonographer (as additional skills are required) verify the depth by ultrasound. The aortic arch is considered an orientation point to locate the carina. If a deep tube is identified (<1 cm or <0.5 cm in premature infants), alongside the presence of a lung pulse, verify the insertion depth clinically, and then perform gentle movements of 0.2 cm and verify bilateral pleural sliding.",
    "​NOTE: This method has been validated in several studies19,20. Video 1 depicts a suspected PTX where a lung pulse was encountered; when verifying the depth, a deep tube was identified and retracted. The lung pulse disappeared, and a PTX was diagnosed. Parenchymal signs appeared after chest tube placement.\n5. Cardiac arrest assessment based on HEUE with subcostal views, an HHD in parasternal long axis view, and an HEUE/HHD LUS\nNOTE: While the attending team is performing neonatal resuscitation according to the ILCOR recommendations, the POCUS team prepares the ultrasound equipment. Intubation may be verified by documenting the endotracheal tube in situ and assessing the depth with the weight + 6 formula. Ultrasound may be used to identify the HR21, qualitatively assess the contractility, and rule out PCE/CT.\nHEUE: Subcostal views are performed as they can be obtained without interfering with chest compressions.\n\t\nSelect the phased array probe (6-12 MHz). Press Neonatal Cardiac mode, click on the up/down button, use the liver as an acoustic window, and ensure that the right atrium is at the bottom of the screen.\nAdjust the scanning depth to 6 cm and the sector width so that part of the liver and the complete heart are seen. Obtain a subcostal long axis (notch: 5 o'clock), utilizing the liver as an acoustic window to the heart.\nScan from posterior to anterior recognizing (1) the superior vena cava (SVC), (2) the right and left atriums, (3) the left ventricle and aortic valve, and (4) the crossing right ventricle and pulmonary valve (Figure 4). On B-mode imaging, identify the HR, and qualitatively assess the contractility and the absence of PCE/CT.",
    "Place the transducer under the xiphoid region with the notch facing 3-5 o'clock, and sweep from side to side to scan the diaphragm and the bottom of the lungs,using the liver as an acoustic window (Figure 5). Assess for PCE/CT and PE.\nPerform LUS searching for parenchymal signs (B-lines, consolidation) during ventilation to rule out PTX (see later in the text).\nHHD: Parasternal long axis view and LUS\n\t\nSelect the linear array probe (7.5-10 MHz). Press Small Parts on the menu on the electronic tablet.\nAdjust the scanning depth to 4-6 cm. Alternating between chest compressions if needed or after returning to circulation, obtain a parasternal long axis view with the linear handheld probe. Point the notch to the left shoulder, and then rotate clockwise to 3-4 o'clock until the right ventricle is on top of the screen and the descending aorta is at the bottom.\nIdentify (1) the right ventricle, (2) the interventricular septum, (3) the aortic valve, (4) the left ventricle, (5) the mitral valve, (6) the left atrium, (7) the pericardium, and (8) the descending aorta (Figure 6). Assess the HR, contractility, and the presence of PCE/CT.\nPerform LUS searching for parenchymal signs (B-lines, consolidation) during ventilation to rule out PTX (see later in the text).\nDuring cardiac arrest, obtain views twice in relation to neonatal ressucitation22.\n\t\t\nAfter performing corrective steps to improve the mask ventilation performance, and if still encountering an HR of <100, perform CU to detect the HR and effective cardiac output and ensure a real asystole.\nAfter advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions and adrenaline dose, perform CU to rule out PCE/CT and hypovolemia, and perform LUS to detect PTX (see later).",
    "​NOTE: The descending aorta is a key landmark for distinguishing a left pleural effusion from a pericardial effusion in long axis view. Fluid anterior to the descending aorta (toward the top of the screen) is pericardial effusion, and fluid posterior to the descending aorta is likely pleural effusion23. It may be impossible to obtain a parasternal view in severe cases of pneumomediastinum.\n6. Hemodynamic instability (hypoperfusion, hypotension, with or without respiratory deterioration)24\nHemodynamic instability assessed using HEUE in subxiphoid long axis, four chamber view.\n\t\nSelect the Phased array probe (6-12 MHz).\nPress Neonatal cardiac mode, click on the up/down button, use the liver as an acoustic window, and ensure that the right atrium is at the bottom of the screen.\nAdjust the scanning depth to 6 cm and the sector width so part of the liver and the complete heart are seen.\nObtain a subcostal long axis view (notch: 5 o'clock) utilizing the liver as an acoustic window to the heart.\nScan from posterior to anterior recognizing (1) the superior vena cava (SVC), (2) the right and left atriums, (3) the left ventricle and aortic valve, and (4) the crossing right ventricle and pulmonary valve (Figure 4). On B-mode imaging, identify the HR, and qualitatively assess the contractility and the absence of PCE/CT (Figure 4).\nPress color on the console; adjust the velocity to a scale of 70-80 cm/s. Observe the crossing of the great vessels and adequate outflow without aliasing and acceleration.",
    "Click on 2D, and obtain a four-chamber view with the notch of the transducer directed toward the left axilla at the 2-3 o'clock position as viewed from the apex. Identify (1) the right atrium, (2) the tricuspid valve, (3) the right ventricle, (4) the interventricular septum, (5) the left atrium, (6) the mitral valve, and (7) the left ventricle (Figure 7). Subjectively evaluate the contractility by examining the change in ventricular cavity size during systole.\nClick on the M mode button. To evaluate the contractility, using the track ball, place the cursor on the tricuspid and mitral annulus to calculate the tricuspid and mitral annular systolic excursion (TAPSE/MAPSE), and compare it to the nomograms according to gestational age25,26.\nAssess the cardiac filling and fluid status. Differentiate a normal filled heart versus an underfilled one by evaluating the end diastolic area, where obliteration of the cavity (empty \"kissing\" ventricles) suggests hypovolemia, whereas an overloaded heart often appears dilated with poor contractility.\nDetermine further management with a hemodynamic/pediatric cardiology consult27. Rule out PCE/CT by looking for a large pericardial effusion (circumferential) with altered contractility, which is indicative of PCE/CT.\nHHD with parasternal long axis view\n\t\nSelect the linear array probe (7.5-10 MHz). Press Small Parts on the menu on the electronic tablet.\nAdjust the scanning depth to 4-6 cm. Obtain a parasternal long axis view with the linear handheld probe. Point the notch to the left shoulder, and then rotate clockwise to 3-4 o'clock until the right ventricle is on top of the screen and the descending aorta is at the bottom.",
    "Identify (1) the right ventricle, (2) the interventricular septum, (3) the aortic valve, (4) the left ventricle, (5) the mitral valve, (6) the left atrium, (7) the pericardium, and (8) the descending aorta (Figure 6). Subjectively evaluate the contractility by examining the change in the ventricular cavity size during systole.\nAssess the cardiac filling and fluid status. Differentiate a normal filled heart versus an underfilled one by evaluating the end diastolic area, where obliteration of the cavity (empty \"kissing\" ventricles) suggest hypovolemia, whereas an overloaded heart appears dilated and often has poor contractility.\nDetermine further management with a hemodynamic/pediatric cardiology consult. Rule out PCE/CT, as indicated by fluid anterior to the descending aorta.\n\t\tNOTE: See the representative results for notes on assessing the cardiac function. Figure 8 shows images of systolic right atrial collapse and diastolic right ventricular collapse during PCE/CT28.\n7. Exclusive respiratory symptoms (normal blood pressure and perfusion)\nUsing HEUE/HHD for LUS, longitudinal and transversal scans. Lung ultrasound semiology has been described by Liu and collaborators (Table 2)29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45\nSelect the linear array probe (HEUE 8-18 MHz, HHD 7.5-10 MHz). Press Small Parts on the console or on the menu on the electronic tablet. Turn off harmonics.\nAdjust the scanning depth to 4-6 cm. Divide the thorax into six regions using the anterior and posterior axillary lines, as well as the parasternal lines. Identify the following: a) the anterior region from the parasternal line to the anterior axillary line, and then use the intermammary line to divide into the upper and lower anterior regions; b) the lateral region from the anterior to posterior axillary line.",
    "Perform a longitudinal scan with the notch facing up (perpendicular to the ribs) and with medial to lateral slide in both the anterior and posterior regions. Obtain clips of 6-10 s. Rotate the transducer 90° (notch to the right) to scan from top to bottom through the intercostal spaces.\nAssess pleural sliding to search for a PTX. Identify the to-and-fro motion of the pleural line, which synchronizes with the respiratory movement. The presence of parenchymal signs (B-lines, consolidation) rules out PTX. Perform M-mode to search for the \"Bar code\" sign (Figure 9).\nRotate the transducer 90°, and place the transducer between the second and third intercostal spaces to obtain the anterior superior transverse plane with the notch pointing to the right. The sternum and mediastinal structures (the thymus, SVC, aorta, and pulmonary artery and branches) are observed in a healthy newborn (Figure 10).\nOn longitudinal lateral scans, identify the presence of a PE, which is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity (Figure 11).\n\t\t​NOTE: On some HHDs, the harmonics function allows the user to increase the frequency from 7.5 MHz to 10 MHz so that it can be maintained in preterm infants. Ultrasound allows the detection of pleural fluid in amounts as small as 3-5 mL, which cannot be identified by radiographs. Be mindful of the ultrasound depth, as modern machines allow great amplification, and the amount of fluid might be overestimated.\n8. Drainage (HEUE/HHD)\nNOTE: In all cases, use sterile technique.\nPerform emergency procedures if there is significant hemodynamic instability, impending deterioration, or cardiac arrest.\nUse an 18-20 G needle or an angiocatheter connected to a 20 mL syringe and a three-way stopcock. Keep the newborn comfortable, and ensure adequate pain control if possible. Swab the area with chlorhexidine.\nPCE/CT46",
    "Place a high-frequency linear transducer horizontally in the subcostal area with the marker pointing caudally.\n\t\t​NOTE: The optimal place for echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis is the largest, shallowest fluid pocket with no intervening vital structures.\nPalpate the xiphoidal process, and insert the needle (visualized piercing the pericardial sac) just below it at an angle of 30° to the skin, with the needle tip pointing toward the left shoulder. Once a flashback is obtained, stop advancing the needle, and continue to aspirate the maximal amount of fluid using the syringe.\nPTX33​\n\t\nIdentify a suitable puncture point away from the sliding portion if a lung point is present, ensuring that only an A-line pattern with no pleural sliding exists (\"Barcode sign\" in M-mode). Adopt a supine, prone, or side position, allowing the air on the affected side to rise.\nInsert the needle into the intercostal space at the superior margin of the lower rib to avoid damage to the neurovascular bundle. Evacuate the pleural air by needle aspiration, and consider the placement of a chest tube based on the situation.\nPE41\nIdentify a suitable puncture point; choose the deepest pool of fluid. Adopt a supine or lateral position, with the upper part of the body slightly elevated, allowing fluid to accumulate due to gravity at the lowest point of the pleural space.\nInsert the needle into the intercostal space at the superior margin of the lower rib to avoid damage to the neurovascular bundle. Evacuate the pleural fluid by needle aspiration, and consider the placement of a chest tube based on the situation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
