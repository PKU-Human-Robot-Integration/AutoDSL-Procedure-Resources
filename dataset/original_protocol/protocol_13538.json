    "All animal procedures in this study were approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Small intestine convenience samples from a preterm non-human primate (NHP, 90% gestation, olive baboon, Papio anubis) were obtained following euthanasia for a separate study (Protocol #101523-16-039-I).\n1. Establishment of apical-out enteroid NEC-in-a-dish model\nPreparation of media and enteroid treatments\n\tNOTE: Once prepared following standard aseptic technique, the media can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\n\t\nPrepare antibiotic-free media (AFM) by mixing 50 mL of human organoid growth media with 50 mL of organoid supplement (see Table of Materials). Prepare 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid/1x phosphate-buffered saline (EDTA/PBS) by adding 100 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to 9,900 µL of PBS.\nChill Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium/nutrient Ham's mixture F12 + 15 mM HEPES Buffer (DMEM/F12) at 2-8 °C.\nPrepare TNF-α stock solution by suspending 100 µg of TNF-α powder in 1 mL of 1x PBS. Further dilute the TNF-α stock to 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL concentrations using AFM as the solvent. Prepare LPS stock solution by suspending 2 mg of LPS in 1 mL of 1x PBS. Further dilute stock LPS to 100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL using AFM as the solvent.\nReversing the polarity of 3D enteroids",
    "NOTE: The following procedure is intended for the reversal of a single 24-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate into two 24-well ultra-low attachment tissue culture plates. The tissue culture plates should be warmed to 37 °C for at least 30 min prior to use. The derivation of basolateral-out 3D enteroids was achieved as described previously by many groups35,36, with slight modifications for media (detailed above). The general enteroid derivation procedure does not differ from that of humans. In brief, excised tissue is washed, cut into small fragments, and incubated in cell disruption buffer. The cell solution is then run through a 70 µM cell strainer, resulting in crypts that are plated at a high density.\n\t\nAspirate media from each well of a 24-well plate of established 3D basolateral-out enteroids.\nAdd 500 µL of 5 mM ice-cold EDTA/PBS to each well of the 24-well plate and gently mechanically disrupt the basement membrane extract/ECM dome by pipetting up and down with a p200 pipette a minimum of 5x-6x.\nTransfer the contents of four wells to a 15 mL conical tube and add 8 mL of ice-cold EDTA/PBS to the conical tube. Transfer the remaining 20 wells in the same manner.\nIncubate 15 mL conical tubes at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating platform or shaker at 330 rpm. After the 1 h incubation, centrifuge the conical tubes at 300 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove and discard the supernatant from each tube.\nCombine and wash the cell pellets with 5 mL of DMEM/F12 and distribute the cell suspension into two 15 mL conical tubes.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 300 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and add 12 mL of AFM to each tube, ensuring the cell pellets are resuspended.",
    "Pipette 500 µL of the enteroid suspension into each well of two 24-well ultra-low attachment plates.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2-5 days or until enteroids have reversed polarity.\nTo check enteroid reversal, first establish the confirmatory immunofluorescent staining and the average time to reversal (~3 days), then confirm the polarity reversal using a basic light microscope visualization. Apical-out enteroids are very cellular in appearance, while basolateral-out enteroids are often dominated by the presence of a large central lumen or budding (see Supplementary Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Once the procedure has been standardized, the conversion rate to apical-out typically exceeds 95%. The use of apical-out enteroids is intended as a terminal experiment, though it is theoretically possible to passage apical-out enteroids into a small number of basolateral-out enteroids.\nApical-out NEC-in-a-dish\n\tNOTE: Once the enteroids have reversed polarity, use the cultures in subsequent experiments quickly, as their longevity in apical-out conformation has not been confirmed beyond 3-4 days. For the following NEC-in-a-dish model, the enteroids were treated for 24 h, then collected immediately afterward and preserved for downstream experiments.\n\t\nOnce the enteroids have visually reversed polarity with at least 95% efficiency, remove the plates from the incubator and collect eight wells of a 24-well plate into a 15 mL conical tube. As the apical-out enteroids are in suspension, simply pipette the enteroid/media solution. Centrifuge the 15 mL tube at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nOnce the cells are pelleted, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 4 mL of AFM mixed with the desired volume (10 µL here to match the highest treatment volume added) of 1x PBS (control).",
    "Pipette 500 µL of enteroid/PBS/AFM suspension into eight wells of a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate and incubate the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nRepeat Steps 1.3.1.-1.3.3. for TNF-α (20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL) and LPS (100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL) treatments at normoxia. For all hypoxia treatments, repeat Steps 1.3.1.-1.3.3., but place the plate in a separate incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 1% O2 for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Step 1.3.4. can be done simultaneously with Steps 1.3.1.-1.3.3, but, for clarity, the procedure above was separated by treatment in order to reduce complexity.\n2. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy\nPreparation of staining solutions\n\t\nPrepare 0.1% Triton X-100 by mixing 7 µL of Triton X-100 in 1x PBS to a final volume of 7 mL. Prepare PBST (PBS-Tween) by adding 30 µL of Tween-20 to 1x PBS to a final volume of 30 mL.\nPrepare 10% normal donkey serum (NDS)/PBST by adding 700 µL of NDS to 6.3 mL of PBST. Prepare 1% NDS/PBST by adding 70 µL of NDS to PBST to a final volume of 7 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Donkey serum was used here to correlate with the secondary antibody host. However, the blocking serum species should match the secondary antibody species in order to properly block non-specific binding.\nStaining (Day 1)\n\t\nTransfer the contents of four wells of a 24-well plate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat for all desired wells/treatments, with each treatment in a separate tube. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Once the enteroids are pelleted, remove the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellets in 300 µL of 4% formaldehyde fixative for 30 min at room temperature (RT). After 30 min, centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 500 µL of sterile, RT 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and add 500 µL of 0.1% Triton X-100, and let sit for 1 h at RT.\nAfter 1 h, centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Wash with 500 µL of 1x PBS and place the tubes on a rotator or shaker at 200 rpm for 15 min at 2-8 °C. Repeat this a total of 4x.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Add 500 µL of 10% NDS/PBST and incubate at RT for 45 min. During the incubation, prepare primary antibody solutions by combining 20 µL of recombinant anti-villin antibody, 10 µL of E-cadherin antibody, and 1970 µL of 1% NDS/PBST for eight wells of a 24-well plate.\nAfter the 45 min incubation, centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Place the tubes on ice. Remove the supernatant and replace with 250 µL of primary antibody solution. Incubate the tubes overnight at 2-8 °C.\nStaining (Day 2)\n\t\nCentrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Add 250-500 µL of PBST to each tube, depending on the size of the pellet, and place on the rotator or shaker at 200 rpm for 1 h at 2-8 °C. Repeat the PBST wash 4x.",
    "Prepare secondary antibody solution by adding 52 µL of Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) to 50% glycerol and 5.2 µL of donkey anti-mouse fluorescent green 488 secondary antibodies to 5142.8 µL of 1% NDS/PBST.\nFollowing the last PBST wash and centrifugation, remove the supernatant from the tubes. Dispense 200 µL of secondary antibody solution to each tube and incubate in the dark overnight at 2-8 °C.\nMounting stained apical-out enteroids (Day 1)\n\t\nBring glycerol-based mountant containing blue nuclear dye to RT over 1 h.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Remove 100 µL of the supernatant and resuspend the cells in the remaining ~100 µL of supernatant. Transfer the cell suspension to 0.5 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes in a mini centrifuge for 20 s to pellet the cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 100 µL of far-red nucleic acid stain. Incubate the tubes at RT for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes in a mini centrifuge for 20 s to pellet the cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 100 µL of 1x PBS. Repeat for a second wash.\nCentrifuge the tubes in a mini centrifuge for 20 s to pellet the cells and remove 70 µL of the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in the remaining volume of PBS and transfer the contents to a labeled coverslip (24 mm x 60 mm).\nApply 75 µL of mountant directly onto the specimen and remove any bubbles with a pipette tip. Allow the coverslips to cure overnight (18-24 h) at RT in the dark.\nMounting stained apical-out enteroids (Day 2)",
    "After curing overnight, apply a thin layer (~15 µL) of glycerol to the coverslips. Mount the coverslip to the glass slide and gently press into place. Tap to remove any bubbles between the coverslip and the slide.\nAllow the coverslip to set at RT in the dark for a minimum of 2 h, before imaging at 20x magnification with a confocal microscope. For microscopic visualization of enteroids using various confocal acquisition methods, refer to Lallemant et al.37.\nImmunofluorescent quantification\n\tNOTE: This method determines the corrected total fluorescence by removing the background signal using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).\n\t\nOpen the confocal images in ImageJ and outline the desired area with the region of interest (ROI) tool.\nSet user-defined parameters by navigating to Analyze > Set Measurements. Select Area > Integrated Density > Mean Grey Value under the settings tab.\nNavigate to Analyze > Measure. A pop-up window will appear containing the measurements. Copy and paste these measurements into a spreadsheet.\nTo subtract the background signal, select a small non-fluorescent area of the image. Navigate to Analyze > Measure for that region. A pop-up window will appear containing the measurements. Copy and paste the output into a spreadsheet.\nMultiply the area of the selected cell by the average fluorescence of background readings, and subtract the sum from the integrated density to calculate the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF). Repeat the steps above for all images of interest, while maintaining records in a spreadsheet or statistical software package (see Table of Materials).\n3. Apical-out NEC-in-a-dish cell viability\nEnteroid treatments\n\t\nEstablish apical-out NEC-in-a-dish model for 24 h, as in Step 1.\nThaw cell viability assay reagent overnight at 4 °C. On the day of assay, bring the reagent to RT 30 min before use. Invert the reagent to mix.",
    "Before performing the assay, remove 100 µL of media from each well, leaving the remaining 400 µL. Add 400 µL of cell viability assay reagent to each well.\nVigorously mix well the contents on a plate shaker at RT for 5 min at 200 rpm to induce cell lysis. Following shaking, incubate the plate at RT for an additional 25 min.\nAfter 25 min incubation, mix the contents of one well via pipetting and transfer 200 µL of the 800 µL to a single well of a 96-well, opaque, polystyrene, clear-bottomed plate. Repeat for the remaining 600 µL, creating four technical replicates per well. Transfer the remaining contents of each well of the 24-well plate into a 96-well plate in this manner.\nUsing a plate reader capable of luminescence, record values at 0.25 ms integration and compare the relative values among treatments. Alternatively, compare treatment luminescence to an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) standard.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
