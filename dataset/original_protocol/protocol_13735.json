    "The protocols described below comply with the ethics guidelines of the Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz EKNZ.\n1. Preparation of Epstein Barr immortalized B-lymphocyte cell lines11\nAfter informed consent, collect 30 mL of whole blood in EDTA-treated sterile tubes from the proband carrying a RYR1 mutation and from healthy family members with no mutation.\n\tNOTE: Keep all solutions sterile and work in a tissue culture hood.\nIsolate mononuclear cells from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation media (e.g., Ficoll-Hypaque, .077 g/L).\n\t\nPlace 30 mL of sterile blood in a 50 mL conical sterile tube.\nPlace the tip of a Pasteur pipette containing the density gradient centrifugation media at the bottom of tube and layer 20 mL sterile of density gradient centrifugation media solution slowly underneath the blood.\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 900 x g at 18°-20°C, with no break.\n\t\t​NOTE: The mononuclear cell layer appears as a cloudy ring at the interphase between the density gradient centrifugation media layer and the top layer containing platelet enriched plasma.\nWith a sterile pipette gently remove the interphase layer containing mononuclear cells (approximately 3-5 mL) and transfer the solution to a clean 50 mL sterile conical tube.\nAdd 20 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to rinse cells, centrifuge for 10 min at 600 x g at room temperature and resuspend the pellet in PBS. Repeat for a total of three times; this ensures that all the media is removed.\nAfter the last wash, resuspend cells in 1-2 mL of tissue culture medium (RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin). Place mononuclear cells (approximately 1 x 106 cells) in a T125 tissue culture flask containing 20 mL of tissue culture medium.\nInfect mononuclear cells with Epstein-Barr virus.",
    "Use supernatants from B95.8 cell line cultures (containing 102-103 transforming units/mL stocked at -80 °C) as a source of EBV.\nResuspend 1 x 106 mononuclear cells from step 1.5 in 20 mL of tissue culture medium and expose them to 2 mL of supernatant from the B95.8 cell line in the presence of cyclosporin A (0.2 µg/mL final concentration) for infection.\nPlace the flask in a 37 °C cell culture incubator and allow the cells to grow. After one week change the culture medium.\n\tNOTE: Once B-cells start proliferating they form recognizable clumps and grow rapidly so that the cultures can be expanded and frozen.\nExtract the genomic DNA from the EBV immortalized B-lymphocyte cell lines11 to confirm the presence or absence of the given mutation.\n2. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements\nNOTE: Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration of the EBV-transformed B-lymphocyte cell lines can be monitored in cell populations, with a spectrofluorometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer and cuvette holder set to 37 °C. Alternatively Ca2+ changes can be monitored in single cells by fluorescence microscopy. In both cases cells are removed from the tissue culture flask, washed twice with Krebs Ringer's solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM NaHPO4, 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4 containing 1 mM CaCl2) and counted .\nFor experiments in cell populations using a spectrofluorometer11,13,14\nResuspend cells at a final concentration of 1 x 107 cells/ mL in Krebs Ringer's solution and incubate at 37°C for 30 min with a final concentration of 5 µM Fura-2/AM.\nCentrifuge cells at 900 x g for 10 min and resuspend them in Krebs Ringer's solution at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL.",
    "Measure fluorescence changes (ratio 340/380 nm) using a spectrofluorometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer set at maximal velocity and set to 37 °C.\nJust before the experiment spin cells at 900 x g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and quickly resuspend the pellet in 1.5 mL of Krebs Ringer's solution with 0.5 mM EGTA but no added Ca2+.\nPlace cells in a 3 mL glass spectrofluorometer cuvette and record the fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm excitation, 510 nm emission).\nAchieve a stable base line (approximately 30 seconds), add the selected concentration of RyR1 agonist (4-chloro-m-cresol, or 4-cmc) and record the calcium transient.\n\t\t​NOTE: A 300 mM stock solution of 4-cmc made in DMSO is use used as a starting reagent. This solution can be made in advance, aliquoted and stored at -20 °C for several months.\nPerform experiments for different 4-cmc concentrations.\n\t\tNOTE: Include 75 µM, 150 µM, 300 µM, 450 µM, 600 µM, 750 µM to 1 mM to generate a dose response curve of agonist versus change in [Ca2+]. The different 4-cmc concentrations are obtained by adding the appropriate volume of 4-cmc from the stock solution, directly into the cuvette containing the Fura-2 loaded cells. For example, for a final concentration of 300 µM 4-cmc, 1.5 µL of the stock solution are added to the cuvette containing 1.5 mL of cells in Krebs Ringer's solution. For lower agonist concentrations, the 300 mM stock solution should be diluted to 75 mM with DMSO and the appropriate volume added to the cuvette containing 1.5 mL of cells in Krebs Ringer's solution.\nAdd 400 nM thapsigargin to cells to calculate the total amount of Ca2+ present in intracellular stores. Record the peak Ca2+.",
    "Plot the peak calcium induced by a given 4-cmc concentration versus the peak calcium induced by thapsigargin, which is considered 100% and construct a 4-cmc dose response curve comparing cells from a proband and healthy relative\nFor experiments on single cells13\nDilute poly-L-lysine 1:10 in sterile H2O and pre-treat the glass coverslips for 30 min. Allow to air-dry under a sterile tissue culture hood.\nRe-suspend EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes to a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL in Krebs Ringer's solution containing 1 mM CaCl2 and add a final concentration of 5 µM Fura-2/AM.\nPlace 1 mL of cells on the poly-L-lysine treated coverslips and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator for 30 min to allow the EBV cells to stick to the glass coverslip during loading.\nPlace the coverslip in the perfusion chamber and start perfusion (at a rate of 2 mL/min) with Krebs Ringer's solution containing 1 mM Ca2+.\nUse an inverted fluorescent microscope (equipped with a 40x oil-immersion objective (0.17 numerical aperture), filters (BP 340/380, FT 425, BP 500/530) to record on-line measurements, with a software-controlled charge coupled device (CCD) camera attachment.\nAcquire Images at 1 s intervals at a fixed exposure time (100 ms for both 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths. Use imaging software to analyse changes in fluorescence. Measure the average pixel value for each cell at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm13.\nTo achieve cell stimulation, use a cell perfusion stimulator with 12 valves and add different concentrations of 4-cmc. The flush valve contains Krebs Ringer's solution with no added Ca2+ plus 100 µM La3+ to monitor calcium release from intracellular stores only.\nConstruct a dose response curve of 4-cmc versus change in [Ca2+], as described above.\n3. Preparation of human myotubes from muscle biopsies10,12,15",
    "NOTE: Different methods have been used by different laboratories to obtain satellite cell-derived myoblasts and myotubes. Below is the description of the method used in Basel.\nRinse muscle biopsy with sterile PBS to remove excess blood and cut into small fragments of about 0.5-1 mm.\nPrepare 6 well tissue culture dishes with insert. Add 1.5 mL of human muscle growth medium to each well and 0.5 mL of human muscle growth medium to each insert.\n\tNOTE: The growth medium is made up as follows: 500 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, or DMEM (4.5 mg/mL), containing 10% horse serum, 5 ng/mL insulin, 3 mM glutamine, 600 ng/mL penicillin G and streptomycin, and 7 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Commercially available skeletal muscle growth medium can also be used.\nPlace 2-3 small muscle fragments into each insert (Figure 1A) and place culture dishes into the cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C). After approximately 8-10 days satellite cells can be seen growing out of and surrounding the muscle biopsy, attached to the insert (Figure 1, B and C, arrows).\nRelease a sufficient number of cells from the biopsy (after approximately 10-14 days), trypsinize as follows:\n\t\nRemove all culture medium, rinse the cells once with 1 mL of PBS, add 0.5 mL of trypsin/EDTA solution (0.025% trypsin and 0.01% EDTA) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 1 mL of growth medium to the cells to neutralize the effect of trypsin and transfer the satellite cells into a new T25 cell culture flask; add 3 mL of growth medium and place the cells in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nChange the growth medium the next day to remove the EDTA and subsequently change the medium once per week.",
    "When myoblasts are approximately 75% confluent, trypsinize and transfer them onto laminin-treated glass coverslip.\n\tNOTE: As a proportion, cells growing in one T25 flask should be transferred onto one 43 mm diameter laminin-treated glass coverslip. The glass coverslip should be placed within a 60 mm diameter tissue culture plate containing 3 mL of growth medium.\nGrow cells on the glass coverslip in growth medium in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) changing the medium once per week. At 90% confluency, switch to differentiation medium made up as follows: high glucose DMEM (4.5 mg/mL), 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 0.15 mg/mL creatine, 5 ng/mL insulin, 200 mM glutamine, 600 ng/mL penicillin G and streptomycin, and 7 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Commercially available differentiation medium may also be used. Change the differentiation medium once per week.\nAfter 7-10 days in differentiation medium, multinucleated myotubes are visible. Assess for changes in [Ca2+] within one week, as described below.\n4. [Ca2+]i ratio measurements determined with Fura-2\nLoad glass coverslip grown myotubes with Fura-2/AM (final concentration of 5 µM) diluted in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. Briefly, remove the differentiation medium from the glass coverslip grown cells and add 2 mL fresh differentiation medium. Add 10 µL of Fura-2 AM from a stock solution of 1 mM and incubate 30 min in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nTransfer glass coverslip to the perfusion chamber and rinse cells with Krebs Ringer's solution containing 2 mM CaCl2.\nPerform on-line [Ca2+] measurements as described above in the EBV single cell section with the use a 20x water immersion FLUAR objective (0.17 numerical aperture).\nSubscription Required.
