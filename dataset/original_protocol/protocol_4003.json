    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: 1 h\nGeneration of homemade endotracheal intubation tube\nPrepare 18, 20, 22, and 24-gauge intravenous cannulas (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and cut the part which is placed in blood vessels into 1.5–3 cm lengths.\nPass a thinner cannula through a thicker cannula and combine them into a single cannula. To make it easier to use, the total length of the combined cannula should be around 5 cm.\nAttach the connecting parts for anesthesia apparatus.\nTo prevent air leakage from the connection site between the combined cannula and the connection parts for anesthesia apparatus, seal the connection site between them with an ultraviolet hardening type adhesive (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1E).\nAnesthesia and tracheal intubation\nTiming: 10 min\nWeigh the mouse to determine the dosage of anesthetic drugs. The surgical setup is depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/966-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Setup for the operation\n(A). An example of surgical setup. a and b, needle holders; c, strait nipper; d, curved scissors; e and f, micro scissors; g–l, various forceps; m, rib retractor; n, pean forceps.\n(B) Anesthesia apparatus.\n(C) Anesthesia induction chamber.\n(D) Ventilator.\n(E) ECG plate.\n(F) Surgical microscope.\n(G) Heating lamp.\n(H) Mice warmer.\nAnesthetize the mice with an intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg pentobarbital/kg of body weight for intubation.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by pinching the tail.\nNote: When the mouse responds to the pain stimuli, use isoflurane at an appropriate dosage (1–4%) and oxygen with a flow rate of 0.5 L/min in an induction chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) connected to an anesthesia machine (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nGrasp and raise the tongue with a blunt tweezer and intubate with a homemade endotracheal intubation tube (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1E).\nNote: To clearly see the epiglottis, project a flashlight around the throat from above.",
    "Connect the cannula to the ventilator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) and check the chest movement to ensure proper intubation.\nNote: If the abdomen is swollen, esophageal intubation is suspected, and intubation should be repeated according to step 8.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on the electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring pad using adhesive tapes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Connect the endotracheal intubation tube to an inhalation anesthesia apparatus and ventilator. Anesthesia is maintained with isoflurane (1–4%) in 100% oxygen with a flow rate of 0.5 L/min.\nSet the ventilator tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, ventilation rate of 100 strokes/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 cm H2O.\nNote: From now on, work under a microsurgery stereomicroscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F), and the mice were warmed with a heating lamp during operation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nPause point: 10–30 min.\nApply hair removal cream from the throat to the precordial region and gently shave the mouse’s fur with a razor.\nSurgical procedure for ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery\nTiming: 15–20 min\nPick the skin on the xiphoid process, making a small incision following a longitudinal incision from the xiphoid process to the sternocleidomastoid muscle using small scissors.\nNote: To avoid excessive bleeding, proceed without incision of the fascia. In case of bleeding, apply gentle pressure to the bleeding point with rolled Kimwipes.\nUsing small scissors, peel the connective tissue under the thymus to make a space between the thymus and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nCut fascia and pectoralis muscles along the left side of the sternum from the base of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the sixth rib.\nTo create a space for a rib cut nipper, make a small hole using forceps on the left side of the sternum at the third intercostal space (the space between the third and fourth ribs).",
    "Note: Make sure not to hurt the heart or lungs when making a hole. (See the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section)\nCut the third, fourth, and fifth ribs with a rib cut nipper. Simultaneously, you can cut the third to fifth intercostal muscles. Release the uncut intercostal muscles using forceps.\nGently set the rib retractor into the space and spread the ribcage.\nNote: At this time, the pleura tears together.\nUsing a tweezer and micro scissors, carefully remove the pericardium and left lower part of the thymus from the ventral side of the heart to easily show the left atrium.\nPlace small pieces of rolled Kimwipes below the left ventricle to make it easier to ligate the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.\nLocate the ligature suture points. Although the running pattern of LAD varies, as a standard, we use points 2–3 mm below the line connecting the lowest point of the left atrium and the left ventricular apex (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/966-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of the ligation point\nRV, right ventricle; LV, left ventricle; LA, left atrium.\nUse a needle holder to pass an 8-0 polypropylene suture at the ligation point. Gently pull the suture to avoid excessive injury to the heart tissues. Tie the ligature using forceps with two knots in the same direction (also referred to as the surgeon’s knot).\nNote: At this step, the ligature is not completely tied.\nConfirm the color change of the left ventricle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and ST-elevation with an ECG monitor (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C). The lower left part of the left ventricle will turn pale after ligation within 10 s (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/966-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

A 1 horizontal scale represents 0.05 s, and 1 vertical scale represents 0.5 mV. aVL, Lead augmented vector left; aVR, Lead augmented vector right; aVF, Lead augmented vector foot.\nCritical: Sometimes, it is difficult to confirm the color change after ligation. ECG can help confirm whether LAD ligation is performed properly. This step is important because the LAD coronary artery running pattern varies among individual mice. We use 0.2–0.5 mV ST elevation in I, II, Lead augmented vector left (aVL), and Lead augmented vector foot (aVF) leads and mirror image change in Lead augmented vector right (aVR) lead as a reference.\nTie the ligature using forceps in a two-way alternate direction with several knots.\nNote: At this point, the ligature is completely settled.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "Turn off inhaled isoflurane.\nCheck whether the operated mouse comes out from anesthesia by pinching its tail.\nInterrupt temporarily ventilator and confirm the spontaneous breathing of the mouse by checking the regular movement of the thorax.\nStop ventilator and remove the intratracheal cannula.\nRemove adhesive tapes from the limbs.\nFor postoperative analgesia, inject an opiate drug buprenorphine (0.1 mg/g) intraperitoneally .\nPlace the mouse in a warm machine at 30°C for at least 30 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H). Monitor the mouse for any life-threatening condition, such as excessive dyspnea or hemorrhage.\nNote: We considered operated mice as fully recovered status when they moved around voluntarily. Even if mice did not move voluntarily, we returned mice to normal cages within 40 min.\nNote: Apply predefined interruption criteria when necessary to avoid excess suffering (e.g., uncontrolled bleeding or labored breathing).\nMonitor the mouse daily for the first 3 days. After the first 3 days, check the mice every 7 days. Provide it with a soft diet (ordinally food mixed with water) and water ad libitum.\nNote: Apply predefined interruption criteria when necessary to avoid excess suffering (e.g., continuous crouching, 25 % or more weight loss within 1 week, or labored breathing).\nFor Histological analysis, hearts were collected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 16–20 h at 4°C, embedded in paraffin. The sections (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, or Masson’s staining solution and aniline blue for Masson-trichrome staining."
