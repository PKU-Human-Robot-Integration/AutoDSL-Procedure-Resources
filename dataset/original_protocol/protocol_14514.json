    "1. Prenotification of the ED\nAfter the ED nurse hears an alarm, go to the computer screen immediately.\nCheck the information above the incoming patient via the online platform (e.g., IVENA Ehealth)7. Find that the system announces a 66 year-old male patient with the tentative diagnosis of a stroke within the time window (stroke <6 hr) with the estimated time of arrival.\nPre-notify the resident of the SU via phone call.\nAs the SU resident hears the mobile phone ringing, have the SU resident take the phone call. Have the SU resident go to the ED at the estimated time of arrival.\n2. Patient Arrives in the ED\nBring the patient to the ED via paramedics. Have paramedics enter the ED with the patient on the stretcher and report to the stroke nurse and SU resident.\nSU resident: Perform a first initial check including the FAST-Test8 (F: facial droop, A: arm weakness, S: speech difficulties, T: exact time of symptom onset or time last seen well). Ask the patient or the paramedics about the intake of blood thinners. Find out about the characteristics and evolution of the symptoms, in order to exclude very obvious stroke mimics or patients that present beyond the therapeutic time window or have overt contraindications to thrombolysis. If the patient or the paramedics cannot answer these questions, contact relatives if available.\n\tNOTE: The initial check reveals that the patient is a thrombolysis candidate.",
    "ED nurse: Trigger the Stroke Team alert by a speed dial collective call, which simultaneously informs all members of the Stroke Team via their institutional mobile phones. Enter the insurance data of the patient into the hospital information system and perform the registration procedure. Check whether the patient has been treated at the hospital before and print out the latest discharge letter and laboratory values from the electronic hospital information and hand them to the SU resident.\nHave all Stroke Team members answer their phones to hear an automatic voice message saying \"stroke within time window\". Have all Stroke Team members immediately go to their workplaces as defined by the algorithm: ED resident, SU resident and senior neurologist meet at the emergency department, laboratory technician goes to the laboratory, radiology resident and technician meet at the CT scanner.\n3. Rapid Blood Sampling and Clinical Examination\nED resident: Obtain an intravenous access and perform blood sampling, either through an adaptor to the venous access or with a butterfly cannula, for coagulation parameters INR (prothrombin time in international normalized ratio), activated prothrombin time (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT) (3 ml, citrate plasma), hematology (1.6 ml, EDTA plasma), and clinical chemistry (7.5 ml, lithium heparinate plasma)9.\nSU resident: Inform the patient that he is examined for the suspicion of an acute stroke. Take a brief history including the questions on symptom onset, symptom evolution, prior disabilities, current medication intake (especially blood thinners), allergies and preexisting medical conditions. Ask whether the patient has had prior radiologic exams with contrast agents. When the patient cannot answer these questions, ask the relatives when available.\n\t\nPerform a focused neurological exam on the basis of the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)10. Free online-trainings of the NIHSS are available in several languages11.",
    "Senior neurologist: Review the patient's case and decide upon the appropriate imaging modality for the patient depending on the presenting symptoms and the time window. Preferentially consider Computed Tomography (CT) for patients with unequivocal stroke symptoms and a stroke onset clearly within the therapeutic time window because of speed and easy access. Preferentially consider Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for patients beyond the therapeutic time window or with unknown onset of stroke symptoms or patients with an atypical clinical presentation.\nMark the blood samples as \"vital\" with pink coding caps and bring them to the laboratory. Reserve one centrifuge for Stroke Team samples. The complete analysis that is performed on an automated hemostasis analyzer, an automated hematology system, and an automated analyzer for clinical chemistry requires 15-20 min.\nBring the patient to the CT scanner. The patient is still lying on the ambulance stretcher and is accompanied by the paramedics, the residents from the ED, the SU, and the senior neurologist from the SU.\nAt the CT scanner, meet the resident specializing in neuroradiology and the radiology technician.\n4. Cranial CT Scan and Acute Therapy\nTransfer the patient to the CT and connect a line with contrast agent (e.g., Ultravist-300) for the CT angiography to the venous access via Luer lock connection.\nED nurse: Arrive at the CT scanner and bring along a stretcher with a thrombolysis kit (containing 10 mg rt-PA + aqua ad injectabilia, blood pressure medication suitable for intravenous (IV) application [e.g., urapidile], IV anti-vomiting medication [e.g., granisetron], IV sedative [e.g., lorazepam], 10 ml syringes and 0.9% NaCl solution to flush the venous access), monitoring equipment and portable oxygen.",
    "Radiology technician: Perform a cranial CT (to exclude intracranial hemorrhage) and CT angiography (to screen for LVO). Stroke-CT includes unenhanced CT with a slice thickness of 5 mm and CT angiography depicting brain supplying cervical and intracranial arteries.\nNeuroradiologist: Directly review the cranial CT. Unenhanced CT must exclude intracranial hemorrhage and intracranial tumor. For mechanical thrombectomy, CT angiography must prove proximal vessel occlusion, and infarct core on unenhanced CT should not be larger than Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS)12 of 5.\nSenior neurologist: Voice the decision to treat the patient with IV rt-PA.\n\t\nIf the patient can reliably exclude the intake of blood thinners and prior problems with hemostasis, do not await coagulation parameters and administer the rt-PA bolus before the acquisition of the CT angiography.\nIn case of an aphasic patient or an active oral anticoagulant therapy, await the laboratory values (15-20 min) and perform the CT angiography first.\nED nurse: Prepare the appropriate dose for the rt-PA bolus and call the colleagues in the ED to prepare the remaining 90% of the dose for infusion via a pump over 1 hr. rt-PA is given at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg body weight. Have a table with appropriate doses for all body weights between 40 kg and >100 kg in discrete steps of 5 kg ready to prevent calculation errors. Patients weighing 100 kg and more should receive a total dose of 90 mg.\nSU resident: Administer the bolus of rt-PA (10% of the total dose) intravenously over 1 min directly on the CT table.\nStroke team: Transfer the patient to the ED stretcher.\n\tNOTE: The paramedics leave the scene.\nLaboratory technician: Call the SU resident and disclose the coagulation parameters such as International Normalized Ratio (INR), thrombocytes, Thrombin Time (TT) and activated prothrombin time (aPTT).",
    "Neuroradiologist and senior neurologist of the SU: Examine the CT angiography for LVO. If LVO is present, directly notify the neuroradiologist, and the department of anesthesiology of the planned intervention.\nStroke team: Transfer the patient back to the ED or directly to the angiography suite in case of LVO.\nAdminister the remaining 90% of the rt-PA in the ED or in the angiography suite. Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and neurological function on the NIHSS every 15 min and treat severely elevated blood pressure with IV medication (e.g., urapidil) to a target value below 185/90 mmHg.\nSU resident: Go to a computer and check the remaining laboratory parameters in the hospital information system.\n5. Simulation-based Stroke Team Training\nStroke Team trainers (2): Invite all new staff members that are involved in the care of acute stroke patients to the Stroke Team training, which is offered once a month.\nBefore the training starts, prepare the remote-controlled manikin. Connect it to a real monitor, fill it with artificial blood (sugar-free red tea for example). Place the manikin on a stretcher with a head deviation to the left and a plegic position of the right arm and leg.\n6. The Theoretical Course\nSit a group of 4-10 staff members and medical students around a table. Invite everyone to introduce themselves, describe their professional background and share their experience in stroke care as well as the expectations towards the training.\nStroke Team trainer 1: Give an oral presentation supported by illustrative slides, which covers the most frequent stroke symptoms and their detection by the FAST8 score, the basic principles of stroke pathophysiology and the current treatment modalities (IV thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy) as well as the Stroke Team algorithm of the hospital.",
    "Teach how to do a concise NIHSS exam and let the group practice on each other.\n\tNOTE: At the end of the theoretical part which takes approximately 60 min, and in which the participants should understand the importance of the \"time factor\" and the significance of efficient teamwork, go to the ED.\n7. The Hands-on Stroke Team Simulation\nStroke Team trainer 2: Allocate the participants their roles in theStroke Team algorithm and advise them to treat the manikin as if it were a real patient.\nTell the participants that a stroke patient is awaited. Leave them enough time to clarify a few questions and get together as a team.\nBring the manikin into the ED, acting as a paramedic.\nReport that the patient is a 72 year-old female who collapsed during lunch and showed a loss of speech and a right-sided hemiparesis. State that the exact time of symptom onset is unknown, but there is the telephone number of the patient's daughter. Show the containers of aspirin and a beta blocker collected at the patient's home.\nStroke team: Perform the Stroke Team algorithm on the manikin while Stroke Team trainer 1 notes the procedural times and positive and negative elements of the performance.\nStroke Unit resident: Take the history from the paramedic and the daughter via the telephone and examine the NIHSS. Ask for the time of symptom onset, the intake of additional blood thinners, the preexisting medical conditions, especially recent operations, preceding hemorrhagic events and malignant diseases. Delegate some of the tasks (e.g., taking the history from the daughter by phone) to the team.\n\tNOTE: The phone call reaches Stroke Team trainer 1.",
    "Stroke Team trainer 1: Report that the symptoms began abruptly an hour ago, that her mother certainly did not take additional blood thinners (\"… neither warfarin nor any of the new ones that her doctor proposed because her husband died from a brain bleeding when taking warfarin and she would not have that.\"), has recently been short of breath when climbing the stairs but is otherwise healthy except for a mild arterial hypertension.\nED resident: Establish venous access, take a blood sample and cap it as 'vital', ensure that the blood sample is brought to the laboratory and order the imaging in the hospital information system.\nStroke Team trainer 1: Display a systolic blood pressure of 210 mmHg.\nStroke team: Decide if and how to treat this blood pressure, which is a contraindication to thrombolysis, communicate with the nurse and administer the right dose of a suitable IV drug.\nTransfer the patient to the CT scanner.\nRadiology technician: Perform a head CT of the manikin.\nStroke Team trainer 1: Confront the neuroradiologist with a printed CT scan of a stroke patient brain without intracranial hemorrhage, without LVO and without early infarct signs.\nNeuroradiologist: Analyze the scan and convey the findings clearly to the residents of the stroke unit and the ED.\nStroke team: Decide to treat the patient with thrombolysis and administer the bolus.\nStroke Team trainers: Conduct a feedback session with discussion after the simulation.\n\t\nStroke Team trainer 1: Name the door-to-needle time that was achieved during the training session which is usually  20-30 min and lower than expected by the participants.",
    "Stroke Team trainer 2: Conduct two rounds of feedback to each individual team member. Start the first one with the questions \"What was done well? What would you personally do the same way in your next Stroke Team operation?\" followed by a second round with the question \"What did not work so well? What would you personally do differently next time?\" and conclude with a feedback round to the complete team: \"What are the essential factors for a successful Stroke Team operation?\"\nSubscription Required.
