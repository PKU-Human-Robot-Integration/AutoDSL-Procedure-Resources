    "Obtain native frozen skin tissue sections Rinse skin tissue three times with cold PBS.Fix tissue with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 24 h.Perform dehydration with 10 mL of 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C until the tissue sinks to the bottom.Freeze at -80 °C and then embed the skin tissues. Apply a layer of OCT compound in the groove of the embedding mold and place the tissue section down into the groove. Fill with embedding agent (OCT compound) and put the sample on the freezer until the embedding agent solidifies.Cut 20-μm-thick sections of native skin tissues. Place the MembraneSlidesTM (with the MMI logo face up) close to the slice, which will stick to it. Reverse the MembraneSlidesTM, gently press them at the corresponding position below the slice with your fingers, and the sample will completely adhere to the MembraneSlidesTM.Mount sections on MMI MembraneSlidesTM and store at -20 °C.Obtain decellularized frozen skin tissue sections Rinse skin tissue three times with cold PBS containing 0.1% EDTA.Perform delipidation by treating tissue with 25 mL of delipidation solution (see Recipes) for 4 h in a shaker at 37 °C until the tissue segments become oyster white.Gently scrap the surface of the skin with the back of the scalpel to remove the epidermis.Rinse the decellularized dermal scaffolds with 3.4 M NaCl (see Recipes) at 37 °C for 1 h.Wash the samples with DNase-RNase solution (see Recipes) at 37 °C for 1 h.Rinse skin tissue three times with cold PBS.Fix tissue with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 24 h.Perform dehydration with 10 mL of 30% sucrose solution in a 15 mL centrifuge tube at 4 °C until the tissue sinks to the bottom.Freeze and embed the skin tissues as in step A2.Cut 20-μm-thick sections of decellularized skin tissues as in step A3.",
    "Mount sections on MMI MembraneSlidesTM and store slides at -20 °C.Laser capture microdissection (LCM) of frozen skin sections Open LCM system. Install MembraneSlides and IsolationCaps transparent.Switch to 4× objective and start slide scan and navigation.Switch to 10× objective for subsequent dissection.Set laser position indicator. Click the button to fire the laser and check whether the laser position matches the green cross. If not, click “CellCut” – “Laser” – “Set Laser Position” and click at the location where the laser is emitted.Calibrate the parameters for the laser. Select the freehand tool, draw a long line on the empty area without tissues on the slides, and cut. Adjust “Cut velocity,” “Laser focus,” and “Laser power” to make the cutting line clear and precise.Move to the target position, draw cut lines, and start cutting. Increase the cut velocity, cut power, and number of cuts appropriately to get the best cutting efficiency.Pick up the sample under manual mode. Click the collecting button to attach the cutout to the EP tube cover and check if the tissue was successfully collected. If not, repeat collection or try to adjust the position of the EP tube and even recut.Repeat steps C6 and C7 to isolate stratum corneum, granulosum-spinosum, basal layer, superficial dermis, and deep dermis on native sections and basement membrane on decellularized sections successively.Check the entire slice to ensure that the target area is cut and collected.Label the samples and store them at -20 °C for subsequent MS analysis."
