    "The protocol section that uses human monocytes obtained from healthy volunteers follows the guidelines of the Children's Hospital Los Angeles Human Research Ethics Committee and has been approved by the Institutional Review Board under the Human Material Protocol number: CCI 08-00208.\n1. Preparation of Cancer Cell Lines with Tetracycline-regulated shRNA Expression\nCloning of shRNA PAI-1 into Tet-pLKO-puro vector8,9\nDesign shRNA oligomers that contain AgeI and EcoRI cleavage site at the 5' end, the sense sequence, a 6 nucleotide loop, and the antisense sequence.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical oligonucleotides are designed as follows: Forward oligo: 5' CCGG - 19 - 21 bp sense - CTCGAG - 19 - 21 bp antisense - TTTTT, Reverse oligo: 5' AATTAAAAA- 19-21 bp sense - CTCGAG - 19 - 21 bp antisense 3'. Detailed protocol for the oligomer design can be found in 8. In this study 3 shRNA sequences against PAI-1 were tested for the strongest silencing effect: shRNA 132, shRNA 2, shRNA 333, and scrambled33 are included in Table 1.\nAnneal the shRNA oligomers and scrambled shRNA oligomers.\n\t\t\nReconstitute oligonucleotides to 100 µM in water and mix 1 µL Forward oligonucleotide, 1 µL Reverse oligonucleotide, and 8 µL H2O.\nTo anneal the oligonucleotides, mix the following: 1 µL oligonucleotide mixture, 5 µL buffer 10 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) pH 7.5, 50 mM Sodium Chloride (NaCl), 10 mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2), 1 mM dithioerythritol (DTE), and 44 µL H2O.\nIncubate the mixture in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler at 95 °C for 5 min, switch off the instrument, and wait until room temperature (RT) is reached.\nPrecipitate annealed oligonucleotides by adding 5 µL 3 M Sodium Acetate pH 5.2 to 50 µL annealed oligonucleotides.",
    "Add 100 µL cold 100% ethanol (EtOH) and incubate for 30 min at -80 °C. Centrifuge in a benchtop centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C.\nRemove supernatant, add 500 µL cold 70% EtOH, centrifuge for 30 min, remove supernatant, and dissolve pellet in 20 µL H2O.\nAssess the concentration of annealed oligonucleotides by spectrophotometry, measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Dilute oligonucleotides to the final concentration of 1 ng/µL.\nPrepare Luria Bertani (LB) medium and LB agar plates.\n\t\t\nFor LB medium, dissolve 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl in 1 L of water. Adjust pH of the medium to pH 7.0 using 1 N NaOH and autoclave.\nFor LB agar plates, add 15 g/L of agar into LB medium. Autoclave and cool down to approximately 50 °C. Add antibiotic and pour the plates.\nStreak bacteria transduced with Tet-pLKO-puro vector (see the Table of Materials) on LB agar plate supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin and incubate overnight (O/N) at 37 °C.\nInoculate 100 mL LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin (LB/ampicillin) with 1 colony from the plate and grow O/N with shaking at 37 °C.\nIsolateTet-pLKO-puro from 100 mL bacterial culture using a plasmid isolation kit.\nPrepare the restriction reaction for the Tet-pLKO-puro vector with EcoRI and AgeI restriction enzymes as follows: 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL AgeI, 5 µL 10x buffer, 1 µL plasmid DNA (1 µg), 42 µL H2O. Incubate 1 h at 37 °C. To obtain enough of cleaved vector, prepare up to 5 x 50 µL reactions.",
    "Use 1% agarose gel to purify cleaved vector from the agarose gel using a DNA purification kit. To increase the yield of DNA, minimize the agarose to DNA ratio in the gel by using an agarose gel comb for large wells and by carefully removing most of the agarose from the band using a scalpel.\nPrepare the ligation reaction mix as follows: 1 ng annealed oligonucleotides, 50 ng cleaved vector, 2 µL 10x ligase buffer, 1 µL ligase, and water up to 20 µL. Ligate the vector with annealed shRNA oligonucleotides at 16 °C O/N.\n\t\t\nPrepare in addition, a negative control reaction without oligonucleotides to account for uncleaved, partially cleaved, and self-ligated vector that will result in false positive colonies.\nUsing standard transformation techniques, transform ligation mixtures into chemically competent bacterial cells designed to prevent homologous recombination of lentiviral vectors containing direct repeats.\nGrow bacteria on plates with ampicillin O/N at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: If growth of satellite colonies occurs, repeat the transformation and grow bacteria at 30 °C to slow down the growth and thus prevent satellite colonies.\nTo verify successful ligation, pick between 10 - 20 single colonies, inoculating 2 mL LB/ampicillin cultures and an ampicillin plate as a stock plate (to be used as a positive clone later). Grow liquid cultures with shaking O/N at 37 °C. Incubate the plate O/N at 37 °C.\nSeal the plate with parafilm and store at 6 °C.\nIsolate plasmid DNA from liquid cultures using a plasmid isolation kit.",
    "Perform restriction analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies using XhoI enzyme. For each clone, prepare the following reaction mix: 0.5 µL XhoI, 2.5 µL 10x buffer, 1 µL plasmid DNA (0.5 µg), and 21 µL H2O. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Analyze the result of the restriction reaction by running the reaction on a 1% agarose gel.\n\t\tNOTE: Restriction analysis of the WT vector cleaved by XhoI will generate 3 fragments: 8,447, 1,800, and 200 bp. The stuffer sequence in Tet-pLKO-puro vector of 1,800 bp is not present in positive clones containing shRNA-PAI-1 and the XhoI digest will result in DNA fragments of the size: 8,447, 190, and 130 bp. As shown in Figure 1, the 2,000 bp fragment is not found in DNA isolated from ampicillin resistant colonies number: 3, 8, and 11. Depending on the design of oligonucleotides, the length and number of obtained fragments in DNA from positive colonies may vary.\nVerify the proper insertion of the shRNA sequences into the Tet-pLKO-puro vector by sequencing8,9.\nInoculate 100 mL LB/Ampicillin culture with the colony containing the correct clone and grow O/N at 37 °C.\nIsolate plasmid DNA using a plasmid isolation kit.\nGeneration of lentivirus particles.\nCoat a 15 cm tissue culture dish with Poly-L-Lysine by covering the surface of the dish with sterile water solution of 0.01% Poly-L-Lysine and incubating at RT for 15 min. Remove the solution by aspiration and air-dry the dishes.\nSeed 5 x 106 Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK293) cells in the Poly-L-Lysine-coated 15 cm dish, and culture in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin mix (Pen/Strep) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until they reach 70% confluency.",
    "To produce viral particles, transfect HEK293 cells with 25 µg pLKO-Tet-On-shRNA, 25 µg psPAX, (packaging plasmid), and 5 µg pMD2.G plasmids (envelope expressing plasmid) using transfection reagent.\n\t\tNOTE: psPAX and pMD2.G plasmids are a gift from the Didier Trono lab (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland).\nInduce HEK293 cells the next day by changing the medium to DMEM supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, and culturing for 8 h.\nWash the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and add 25 mL of fresh DMEM medium containing 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.2. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, carefully collect virus-containing medium by pipetting; avoid spills.\nFilter the collected medium through a 0.45 µM syringe filter to remove HEK293 cells. The medium containing viral particles can be used immediately or stored at -80 °C for later use.\nGeneration of stably transfected cell lines\nSeed HCT116 colon cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at 50,000 cells/well in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Pen/Strep in a 12-well plate. Incubate at 37 °C at 5% CO2 until cells are 60 - 70% confluent.\nWash cells with PBS and add 1 mL of virus-containing medium to cancer cells and incubate O/N at 37 °C at 5% CO2. As a control, add 1 mL of fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep to 2 wells with cancer cells.\nCarefully remove virus-containing medium by aspiration. Wash the cells with PBS and change the medium to DMEM with 10% (v/v) tetracycline-free (Tet-free) FBS and 1% Pen/Strep.\nAfter 72 h, wash cells with PBS and change the medium to DMEM 10% Tet-free FBS 1% Pen/Strep, 1 µg/mL puromycin for selection of virus-transfected cells.",
    "Depending on the cell line used, adjust the puromycin concentration for optimal selection by testing the range of puromycin concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 µg/mL) in non-transduced cells and choosing the lowest concentration where no control cells survive after 3 days of culture.\nSelect virus-transduced cells by culturing cells in the presence of puromycin for 3 - 14 days. As controls, prepare two additional wells with non-transduced cells, one with medium containing puromycin and one without puromycin. Observe partial killing of the cells by puromycin in the well with virus-transduced cells compared to control wells.\n\t\tNOTE: Non-transduced cells will not grow in the presence of puromycin.\nVerify the efficiency of the conditional KD in the puromycin-resistant HCT116 colon cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The effective concentration of doxycycline will vary with the cell line used and must be titrated (typically from 100 ng/mL to 2 µg/mL).\n\t\t\nDetermine the doxycycline concentration that is not toxic for the cells but effective in downregulating the expression of the protein of interest. In this protocol, 1 µg/mL was successfully used in vitro.\nCulture the cells for 72 h in the presence and absence of 0.1, 1, and 2 µg/mL doxycycline. Verify the level of expression of the downregulated protein (here, PAI-1) in the cell lysate by Western blot analysis. Compare HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells conditionally expressing shRNA to scrambled control cells.\nPreparation of conditioned medium\nSeed 1 x 106 of cells stably transfected with doxycycline regulated pLKO-shRNA containing lentiviruses in 10 cm dishes.\nGrow cell lines in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium with 10% Tet-free FBS and 1% Pen/Strep in the absence and presence of 1 µg/mL doxycycline for 72 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2, adding fresh doxycycline daily.",
    "NOTE: RPMI medium is compatible with culture conditions of monocytes. Doxycycline is a light sensitive compound. Protect the cell cultures from light by covering with aluminum foil and avoid working under direct light exposure.\nCollect the medium by pipetting, filter through 0.45 µm filter, and freeze at -80 °C in aliquots.\n2. Isolation of Monocytes from Human Blood\nIsolate monocytes from human peripheral blood.\n\tNOTE: Human primary monocytes are isolated from 7 mL of white blood cells concentrated in a leukocyte filter obtained from healthy platelet donors. Depending on the donor, one leukocyte filter produces between 1 x 109 and 2 x 109 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), approximately 10% of which constitute monocytes.\n\t\nPrepare the workstation in the laminar flow cabinet.\nSterilize scissors and the laminar flow cabinet with ultraviolet light (UV) for 30 min.\nSpray the leukocyte filter with 70% EtOH and air-dry inside the laminar flow cabinet.\nCut both ends of the leukocyte filter with scissors and empty the content of the filter into a 50 mL tube.\nDilute to 90 mL by adding PBS containing 1% (v/v) FBS (PBS/FBS).\nPrepare 3 x 50 mL tubes with 15 mL density gradient solution. Layer slowly 30 mL of PBS/FBS diluted blood over the density gradient solution using a pipette controller set on gravitational flow to avoid mixing of the layers.\nCentrifuge in a swing rotor at 400 x g at RT without brakes for 25 min.\nDispose the top layer and transfer the middle layer containing PBMCs to a fresh 50 mL tube.\nAdd PBS/FBS up to 50 mL and centrifuge at 120 x g at RT for 10 min. Remove the supernatant containing platelets.Repeat this step two more times.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 50 mL of PBS/FBS and count the PBMCs using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge at 120 x g at RT and resuspend the pellet in PBS/FBS containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (PBS/FBS/EDTA) to a final concentration of 5 x 107 cells/mL.\nUse a negative selection kit to enrich monocytes by depletion of non-monocytic cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The negative selection kit uses a cocktail of antibodies (CD2, CD3, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56, CD66b, CD123, and glycophorin A) against T cells, NK cells, neutrophils, B cells, granulocytes, and erythrocytes. The antibody complexes bind to the surface of these non-monocytic cells and to the dextran magnetic particles. When the tube is placed in a magnet, the beads adhere to the walls of the tube and remove the non-monocytic cells from the solution.\n\t\t\nAdd 50 µL the antibody cocktail to 1 mL of 5 x 107 PBMCs/mL, mix with a pipette, and incubate for 10 min at RT. Add 50 µL magnetic beads to the PBMCs with the antibody cocktail, mix with a pipette, and incubate for another 10 min at RT.\nAdd PBS/FBS/EDTA up to 25 mL and place the PBMC mixture in a magnet that can accommodate a 50 mL tube. Incubate for 10 min at RT. Magnetic beads will adhere to the walls of the tube and sequester the non-monocytic cells from the solution.\nUsing a 25 mL pipette, remove the solution containing monocytes from the tube in the magnet. Be careful to not touch the sides of the tube with the pipette.\nCentrifuge the solution at 250 x g at RT, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet containing monocytes in RPMI medium containing 10% Tet-free FBS and 1% Pen/Strep.\n3. Boyden Chamber Migration Assay",
    "Prepare 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution by dissolving 1 g of BSA in 100 mL of ultrapure water, and filter through a 0.2 µm pore size to sterilize.\nIncubate the porous membrane inserts in 1% sterile BSA solution O/N for improved adherence of macrophages to the membrane. For monocytes/macrophages, use 5 - 8 µm pore size inserts.\n\t\nFill a sterile tissue culture dish with 1% BSA solution and place the inserts in the dish. Apply 200 µL 1% BSA solution inside the inserts.\nWash the inserts twice by placing them in a dish filled with sterile PBS and applying PBS inside the filter.\nSeed 40,000 HCT116 or MDA-MB-231 cells in 0.5 mL RPMI medium containing 10% Tet-free FBS and 1% Pen/Strep per well, in a 24-well plate, in triplicate. Alternatively, place 0.5 mL of previously generated conditioned medium in the well as a source of chemoattractant.\nOn the next day, plate 8,000 monocytes in the prepared insert in 0.3 mL volume of the RPMI medium containing 10% Tet-free FBS and 1% Pen/Strep, in triplicate, and incubate at 37 °C at 5% CO2.\nCollect the inserts after 48 h.\n\tNOTE: The length of an experiment must be optimized depending on the specific conditions and cells used, by performing a time-course experiment where inserts are collected at different incubation times.\n\t\nShake off the excess medium and precisely swipe the inner surface with a cotton-tipped applicator to remove cells that did not migrate.\nStain the outer side of the inserts using the Wright-Giemsa method.\nCarefully mount 3 inserts/glass slide in a high viscosity microscope immersion oil, making sure that the side of the filter with migrated macrophages faces up.\nImage the slides using a light microscope with 20X objective.
