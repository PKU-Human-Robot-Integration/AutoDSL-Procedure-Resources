    "Dissection of BSCNote: Carry out the dissection process in a fume hood safety cabinet under sanitary conditions to minimize cross-contaminations.Harvest BSC from the thoracic region (T2-T11) of Holstein-Friesian cattle.Cut muscle, fat, and other meningeal tissues from the spinal cord using a scalpel.Rinse the tissue 3 times each with 200 ml of Milli-Q water in order to decrease connective tissue and blood contamination.After removing soft tissues, cut the spinal cord into several pieces on a glass petri dish (see Figure 1, Step 1).Producing strategy of viscous gel from BSCNotes:  Carry out the tissue homogenization process at room temperature (RT) in an ice bath (prepared in a metal pot) to prevent over-heating of the mixture and the degradation of biomolecules.  Homogenization step (Step B4) should be repeated at least three times. Mince the BSC tissue (purged from external contaminants) in small pieces of approximately 2 x 2 cm dimensions. Place BSC tissues into a glass Erlenmeyer flask using surgical equipment such as laboratory forceps made of nickel-plated steel, and stainless-steel micro spoon spatula.Weigh small pieces of BSC (approx. 5 g and in the wet form) using an analytical balance, and then place into 20 ml of 0.1 M NaOH solution.Homogenize BSC tissue pieces in 20 ml of 0.1 M NaOH solution using a homogenizer for 5 min at 10,000 rpm.Adjust the final volume of the gel solution to 30 ml with 0.1 M NaOH solution using a glass graduated measuring cylinder (see Figure 1, Step 2).Fabrication of 3D-CBS (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190925/20190925210305_1598.jpgFigure 1. 3D-dCBS fabrication processPipette 200 μl of the gel solution into each well of a 48-well plate to prepare 3-dimensional (3D) bovine spinal cord extracellular matrix-based scaffolds (referred to as 3D-CBS).Incubate the plate at 4 °C for 4 h for the maturation of the gel solution.",
    "Then, freeze the 48-well plate in an ultra-low temperature freezer at -80 °C overnight.Finally, freeze-dry homogenized BSC matrix overnight using a -55 °C lyophilizer (see Figure 1, Steps 3 and 4).Crosslinking process of 3D-CBS (Figure 1)Weigh 25 mg of lyophilized 3D-CBS to prepare crosslinked scaffolds.Place each 3D-CBS into a 15 ml falcon tube including 6 ml of ethanol 99.9% at RT for 15 min while gently shaking at 120 rpm using orbital shaker incubator. Carefully decant the ethanol solution and crosslink each 25 mg of 3D-CBS with 5.37 ml of crosslinking (EDC/NHS) solution at RT for 10 min using the orbital shaker incubator.Afterward, rinse the scaffolds with 200 ml of Milli-Q water at RT for 2 h in a 250 ml borosilicate laboratory bottle with screw cap.Finally, freeze crosslinked 3D-CBS in a 48-well plate at -80 °C and freeze-dry overnight using a -55 °C lyophilizer (see Figure 1, Step 5).Notes: Whereas the dimensions of non-crosslinked 3D-CBS are h=3 mm and Ø=8, the crosslinked ones are h=1.2 mm and Ø=6. Whereas mass of non-crosslinked 3D-CBS is approx. 25 mg, the crosslinked one is approx. 15 mg. Decellularization process of 3D-CBS (Figure 1)Note: Carry out the process in the orbital shaker incubator at RT. Soak crosslinked 3D-CBS in 200 ml of hypertonic solution [50 mM Trizma® hydrochloride, 5 mM EDTA-Na2 (pH 8.0)] containing 1% SDS at RT for 72 h.After being treated with the hypertonic solution, rinse the scaffolds 8 times each with 250 ml of Milli-Q water for 24 h in a 250 ml borosilicate laboratory bottle with screw cap.Following the washing step, treat 3D-CBS with 50 ml of an enzyme solution containing deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and ribonuclease A (RNase A) at 37.5 °C for 24 h in the shaker at 120 rpm.",
    "Rinse 3D-CBS 3 times each with 250 ml of Milli-Q water and decontaminate with 200 ml of 4% ethanol and 0.1% peracetic (decontamination solution) acid for 5 h at RT. Repeat the washing step (Step E4).Finally, freeze the scaffolds at -80 °C ultra-low temperature freezer and lyophilize overnight again to achieve 3D decellularized BSC ECM-based scaffolds (3D-dCBS) (see Figure 1, Step 6).Note: Mass of 3D-dCBS is approx. 2.5 mg."
