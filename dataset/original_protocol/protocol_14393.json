    "The protocol and examples described here were approved by Boston University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB, protocol #H-25644) and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent before participation.\n1. Preparation of Solutions and Micro-glass Cannulas\nPrepare the 4-2-hydrosyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acidic saline (HEPES) solution. For 1 L, dissolve 8.059 g NaCl, 0.298 g KCl, 0.296 g MgSO4•7H2O, 0.235 g CaCl2•2H2O, 0.16 g KH2PO4, 0.01 g EDTA, 1.081 g D-Glucose, and 2.383 g HEPES acid in 950 mL of deionized water. Make up the volume to 1 L with deionized water. Adjust pH to 7.4 using NaOH. HEPES buffer can be stored up to 7 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare the 20x Salt Buffer Stock. For 1 L, add 143.8 g NaCl, 7.0 g KCl, 5.9 g MgSO4, and 7.4 g CaCl2•2H2O into 900 mL of distilled water. Make up volume to 1 L with deionized water. Store stock solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare the 20x Buffer Stock. For 1 L, add 26.8 g NaHCO3 and 0.2 g EDTA·2H2O into 900 mL of deionized water. Make up volume to 1 L with deionized water. Store stock solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare the KREBS Solution to be used during the physiological experiments. For 1 L, add 900 mL of deionized water, 50 mL of 20x Buffer Stock, 50 mL of 20x Salt Buffer Solution, 0.99 g D-Glucose and 0.16 g KH2PO4. Adjust pH to 7.4 using HCl. To maintain pH of the buffer, stir constantly and cover with paraffin or bubble continuously.\nCheck the pH every 20 min. Make the KREBS solution fresh daily.",
    "Make micro-glass cannulas with an internal diameter of 40 - 240 µm using a commercially available needle/pipette puller. The size of glass cannulas is determined by the size of the internal diameter of isolated blood vessels (50-350 µm). Alternatively, purchase micro-glass cannulas of the pre-determined size.\n2. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare the acetylcholine (Ach, 10-2 M, stock solution). Dissolve 18.29 g in 10 mL deionized water. Store 1 mL aliquots of stock solution (10-2 M) at -80 °C. On the day of the experiment serially dilute to obtain the following working concentrations: 10-5, 10-6, 10-7,10-8, 10-9 M.\nPrepare the papaverine (2 x 10-2 M, stock solution). Dissolve 0.07517 g in 10 mL deionized water. Prepare 10 µL aliquots of stock solution and store at -80 °C. Serially dilute to obtain 10-4, 10-5, 10-6, 10-7, 10-8 M on the day of the experiment.\nPrepare the endothelin-1 (ET-1, 2 x 10-5 M, stock solution). Dissolve 50 µg endothelin-1 in 1 mL of 1% BSA/PBS. Store 1 mL aliquots of stock solution (2 x 10-5 M) at -80 °C. On the day of the experiment dilute to obtain a working concentration of 10-10M on the day of experiment.\nStore reagents in either -20 °C or up to -80 °C depending on type of freezer available, but not longer than 6 months.\n3. Adipose Tissue Collection and Vessel Preparation\nRecruit obese men and women (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m², age ≥18 years) enrolled in the bariatric surgery program at Boston Medical Center (BMC). A total of 40 subjects participated in these experiments.\nCollect subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples during planned bariatric surgeries by the surgeon performing the operation.",
    "Harvest the subcutaneous adipose tissues from the lower abdominal wall and visceral fat from the greater omentum, respectively. Typical fat tissue sample size varies from 3 - 10 mg of tissue.\nPlace tissues immediately in cold HEPES buffer solution with a pH of 7.4 and store at 4 °C for up to 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Additionally, adipose arterioles can be obtained from lean individuals as well during other types of surgeries such as hernia repairs or plastic surgery, and can also be biopsied from the subcutaneous depot via trans-cutaneous abdominal fat pad biopsy6.\nUsing a tissue dissection microscope, micro-scissors and micro-forceps, carefully remove surrounding fat and connective tissue from the small adipose arterioles (50 - 350 µm intraluminal diameter, 2 - 3 mm in length).\nTie off all branches on the arterioles using tiny nylon or silk sutures before cannulating on the glass capillary pipettes. Carefully dissect the arterioles since even minor damage of the arteriole wall causes significant functional changes.\nMinimize vessel exposure to light and heat as it may cause vasodilation. Since it can be sometimes difficult to distinguish arterioles from venules, identify the size and smooth muscle tone of vessels by nipping the tips of the vessels. Arterioles are usually smaller and demonstrate greater tone compared to venules.\nPrepare the organ chamber. Slowly fill the glass capillary pipettes and rubber tubing with KREBS solution using a 10 mL syringe.\nOnce rubber tubing is filled and glass capillary pipettes are submerged in KREBS solution within the organ chamber, cannulate the arterioles securely on the secured pipettes and tie both ends of the arteriole with nylon or silk suture knots carefully.\nFill up the organ chamber with KREBS solution up to 2 mL.",
    "Secure the organ chamber onto a stage with the inverted microscope (magnification 10X/0.25 objective) and video camera.\nTurn on the edge detection software that is streamed in real-time at a sampling rate of 1 kHz (1 frame/s).\nConnect one side of the pressurized tubing to the KREBS solution filled pressure reservoirs free of microbubbles, as bubbles can introduce experimental error. Connect the other side of pressurized tubing to the organ chamber.\nConnect the KREBS solution filled pressure reservoirs to the pressure transducer with clean tubing.\nControl intra-luminal flow by regulating the height of these two reservoirs; thus, when reservoirs are placed at the same height, no intra-luminal flow will occur.\nOnce all these processes are complete, turn on heating block and software program to maintain temperature at 37 °C. Continuously perfuse the vessel with KREBS solution and aerate with a gas mixture of 5% CO2, 21% O2 and 74% N2 7,8 throughout the entire experimental procedure.\nTo achieve desired pressure inside the lumen of the isolated vessels gradually increase the intraluminal pressure (5 mmHg, every 5 min) via the pressure control unit in the myo-interface panel, doing so at a slow rate to avoid endothelial layer damage.\n\tNOTE: Once the pressure reaches 60 mmHg, a 20-30 min equilibration period is required to stabilize the vessel. All vascular function studies are performed at 60 mmHg and 37 °C at pH 7.4.7\n4. Assessment of Adipose Microvascular Function\nNOTE: In general, adipose arteriole endothelial-dependent vasodilation can be elicited in response to physiological (flow-induced) and pharmacological stimuli (Ach-induced).\nFlow-mediated, endothelial-dependent vasodilation\nFollowing pressurization, record the diameter of the adipose arteriole at rest (Di). This is referred to as the resting baseline diameter.",
    "Pre-constrict blood vessels to ~55% of the resting baseline diameter (Dp) by adding 1 µL of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10−10 M) directly to the bath and wait 5 min for effect. Repeat this process until reaching the desired ~55% pre-constricted state.\nFollowing pre-constriction, induce continuous flow into the intraluminal space of adipose tissue arterioles, in equal and opposite directions so that a pressure difference can be developed across the vessel without altering the mean intraluminal pressure of 60 mmHg.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, if one reservoir moves up by 10 cm in height, the other one needs to be moved down by 10 cm to alter pressure gradients and thus change intraluminal flow rate. If more accurate flow rate measurements are desired, a quantitative flow-meter system can be applied to the experimental set-up.\nMeasure flow-mediated dilation 3 - 5 min after the initiation of the flow induction. The levels of intraluminal flow (pressure gradients) can be in the range of 0 - 100 cmH2O. Increase each increment of pressure gradient by Δ10 cmH2O every 5-6 min, up to a maximum of 100 cmH2O.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to induce stable laminar flow in the lumen, both micro glass cannula tip sizes need to be very close to inner diameter of arterioles; otherwise, it will produce turbulent flow inside of lumen and induce unwanted measurement errors.\nFollowing the flow- mediated dilation assessment, return pressure reservoirs to the same height (60 mmHg).\nThen, wash arteriole and chamber by immediately removing solution from chamber and replace with fresh KREBS solution. This is done with caution as to not disrupt the suspended arteriole within the chamber.\nRepeat this process 3 - 4 times for 20 - 30 min, or until the isolated vessel returns to the resting baseline diameter.\nAcetylcholine-mediated, endothelial-dependent, vasodilation",
    "When the adipose arteriole has returned to the resting baseline diameter, pre-constrict vessel ~55% by administering endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10−10 M) directly to the bath, as described above in section 4.1.2.\nFollowing pre-constriction, sequentially administer increasing doses (2 µL) of acetylcholine which is a receptor-mediated, nitric oxide agonist (Ach, 10-9 to 10-5 M) directly to the bath. Record the change in arteriolar diameter 5 min after administration of each dose.\nOnce the vessel has reached a plateau following administration of the final Ach dose, wash the vessel 3 - 4 times with KREBS solution. Allow 20 - 30 min for vessel to recover and return to resting baseline diameter. To help maintain pH in the organ camber, change KREBS solution every 15 min.\nIncubate the arteriole with Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10-4 M), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase for 30 min, and then repeat 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 to characterize the relative contribution of nitric oxide to Ach-mediated vasodilation.\nAssess endothelium-independent vasodilation (vascular smooth muscle function) and vessel viability by a sequential administration of increasing doses of papaverine (10-8 to 10-4 M) directly to the bath. If the vessel diameter does not return to, or exceed the resting baseline (Di) diameter in response to papaverine (i.e. appropriate vasodilation), consider the vessel non-viable and discard data points.\n5. Data Analysis and Calculation\nCalculate the vascular reactivity. Use percent vasodilation for data expression to account for baseline differences in vessel diameter and calculate using the following equation:\n\t% vasodilation = (DT-Dp/Di-Dp) ×100\n\twhere DT is the recorded diameter at a given time point (maximum diameter), Dp is the diameter recorded after the addition of the vasoconstriction agent (i.e. ET-1 induced constriction diameter), and Di is the diameter recorded immediately before the addition of the vasoconstriction agent (resting baseline diameter).9",
    "Define vasodilation and vasoconstriction sensitivity (dose-response) to an agonist as the concentration of Ach, papaverine, or ET-1 that elicits 50% of the maximal response (EC50) which can be defined by a sigmoidal parameter and plotted, as described previously.10\n\tNOTE: The inter-observer reproducibility studies of vasodilation of adipose microvessels has a high correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.99 (n = 10 vessel experiments) in our laboratory.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nExpress continuous measurements as mean ± SEM. These tend to be normally distributed. Analyze vascular reactivity in adipose arterioles by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA.\nAlternatively, compare the area under the curve (AUC) of the plot for cumulative vasodilation to dose-responses between treatment groups. In all cases, consider P <0.05 statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
