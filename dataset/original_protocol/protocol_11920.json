    "All the experiments should be carried out following the local governmental and institutional guidelines of ethical handling of laboratory animals.\n1. Preparations Prior to the Day of Bone Culture\nSet up timed mouse matings to obtain fetuses and pups from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and onward.\nNOTE: The culture of long bones can be successfully applied to different mouse strains; in the present protocol, outbred Swiss Webster wild-type mice are used.\nPrepare dissection medium (adapted from Houston et al.15): dilute α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) 1/13 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) and filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm, 33 mm diameter syringe filter. Store aliquots at -20 °C.\nThe day before extraction of the fetuses, prepare the serum-free bone culture medium composed of DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, 40 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 0.05 mg/mL ascorbic acid, and 1 mM betaglycerophosphate. Filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm, 33 mm diameter syringe filter and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nOn the day of the culture and prior to mouse culling, prepare 24-well plates and 60 mm dishes with dissection medium and keep them ice cold. Prewarm the bone culture medium in a 37 °C water bath. Spray 80% (v/v) ethanol on the tools (tweezers and small scissors) to be used for fetus handling. Transfer a binocular scope to a Class II biosafety cabinet.\n2. Culture of Fetus and Newborn Tibia and Femur\nCull the pregnant mouse through cervical dislocation at the desired gestational stage (ranging from E14.5 to E18.5). If newborn pups are used, remove them from the mother one by one and cull by decapitation.\nPlace the mouse on her back and sterilize the abdominal region by spraying 80% (v/v) ethanol on its surface.",
    "Cut the skin and the abdominal muscle with small scissors to access the uterine horns.\nExtract the uterus from the abdominal cavity with the help of tweezers and small scissors, removing the mesometrium and cutting the base of the horns. Place the uterus in a 60 mm Petri dish with ice-cold dissection medium and keep the culture dish on ice during the whole procedure.\nTransfer the Petri dish with the uterus to the biosafety cabinet and work there from now on.\nSeparate individual fetuses with scissors by cutting between the sacs.\nTransfer individual sac under a dissection stereomicroscope in a clean 60 mm dish with dissection medium and open them up with tweezers to separate the fetuses from the placentas and clean them from membranes.\nNOTE: Work with one embryo at a time, while keeping the rest on ice.\nDecapitate the fetuses and transfer the body to a clean new 60 mm dish with a 1 mL cut sterile pipette.\nRemove the skin of the fetuses or pups with tweezers starting from the back and peeling it out till the toes.\nSeparate the hindlimbs from the body by cutting with the tweezers close to the spine and transfer them to a clean dish with ice-cold dissection medium.\nSeparate the tibia from the femur with tweezers by carefully introducing them between the surface cartilage of distal femur and proximal tibia.\nRemove the hip bones from the proximal femur and the calcaneus bone and the fibula from the tibia.\nCarefully remove the soft tissue from the femur and the tibia by nipping and pulling it off.\nNOTE: It is important to remove as much soft tissue as possible, taking special care in removing the tissue that connects the two cartilage poles, but avoiding damaging the cartilage, the perichondrium, and the bones.",
    "Place the four bones (left and right tibias and femurs) in the first well of the 24-well plate with a plastic 1 mL sterile pipette. Alternatively, to compare the effect of different treatments on left and right limbs, place contralateral limbs in different wells.\nNOTE: Extra care should be taken when the bones are transferred to the wells, as they can easily stick to the pipette.\nProceed the same way with as many fetuses as necessary.\nNOTE: Change the dish with the dissection medium as soon as it gets too clouded, as it is important to see clearly the dissected bones.\nWhen all the desired bones are transferred to the wells, remove the dissection medium with a plastic 1 mL sterile pipette and take extra care not to aspirate the bones.\nDepending on the purpose of experiment, pictures can be taken of the bones before removing the dissection medium, as timepoint zero of the experiment. Take pictures with a microscope attached to a digital camera and annotate the exposure and scale used. To ensure easy and reliable measurements, take pictures with good contrast to distinguish the mineralized part.\nAdd 1 mL of culture medium to each well. If any treatment is intended on the bones (doxycycline, tamoxifen, growth factors, etc.), it should be added now.\nTo observe the effect of growth inhibition in the culture conditions, treat the left tibias with retinoic acid (RA, 500 nM), while incubating the right tibias with an equivalent volume of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], final concentration 0.1%) as a control.\nLeave the bones to grow for two days or more in a cell culture incubator under standard cell culture conditions (at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator).",
    "To assess proliferation, add 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) or 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to the medium at a final concentration of 10 µM 1−2 h before fixation.\nNOTE: The stock concentration of EdU is 20 mM.\nCAUTION: EdU and BrdU are thymidine analogues and can be toxic and mutagenic.\nThaw 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and fix the bones by immersion in PFA in individual 2 mL tubes.\nCAUTION: PFA is toxic and designated as a probable human carcinogen. Avoid breathing paraformaldehyde powder and vapors. EdU and BrdU are thymidine analogues and can be toxic and mutagenic.\nAfter a brief 10 min fixation in PFA at room temperature, transfer bones to PBS for picture acquisition at final timepoint. Then place bones back into PFA for overnight fixing at 4 °C.\nAfter fixation bones can be processed for desired downstream applications.\n3. Measurement and Analysis of the Full Length of the Bone and of the Mineralized Region\nUse an image editing software to measure the length of the bones, taking into account the scale of the image. Measure both total length of the bone and the mineralized region. Start the measurements from the first dark cells at one end until the last ones at the other end.\nNOTE: The mineralized region is characterized by the darker color and is easily distinguished from the cartilage.\nTo calculate the growth rate, defined as the average increase in length per day, divide the difference between the final length of the bone and the initial one by the number of days in culture.\nSubscription Required.
