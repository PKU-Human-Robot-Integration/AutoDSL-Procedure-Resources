    "Preparation of hiPSC-derived neuronsForebrain neurons were differentiated from hiPSCs as described previously (Xu et al., 2017).Aspirate old medium from wells of hiPSCs maintained in a 6-well plate.Add 1 ml dispase (1 mg/ml) into wells and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.Add 2 ml DMEM/F12 into wells and transfer the lifted cell clumps into a 15 ml centrifuge tube using a 5 ml plastic pipette. Spin down cells at 160 x g for 3 min at room temperature.Remove and discard the supernatant.Re-suspend and rinse the cell clumps twice with 10 ml of DMEM/F12 to remove the remaining dispase.Note: It is important to completely remove dispase via multiple washes. Failure to remove dispase will affect cell reattachment when plated.Re-suspend cell clumps using 10 ml N2B27 medium (see Recipe 1) supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632, and culture them on uncoated 10 cm Petri dishes for 8 h at 37 °C. Collect cell aggregates and plate them on dishes pre-coated with 10 μg/ml poly-L-ornithine and 10 μg/ml laminin in N2B27 medium supplemented with 100 nM LDN193189, 10 μM SB431542, and 2 µM XAV939. From Day 5, 200 ng/ml SHH is added to the differentiated cells.Change medium every other day. On Day 15, passage cells with a cell lifter at a split ratio of 1:1. Note: These cells will be referred to as neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Expand the NPCs in N2B27 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml BDNF, 2 µM XAV939, and 200 ng/ml SHH for five days. For neuronal differentiation, the NPCs are cultured in N2B27 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml BDNF and 20 ng/ml GDNF, 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, and 0.5 mM dbcAMP.Exchange 50% medium every three days.Note: Neurons at days of 46 to 50 were dissociated and re-plated on MEA plate.",
    "MEA plate coatingCoat MEA plate with PEI solution just before the day of seeding neurons according to Axion’s cell culture protocol on MEA plate.(https://www.axionbiosystems.com/sites/default/files/resources/icell_neuron_culture_protocol.pdf[href=https://www.axionbiosystems.com/sites/default/files/resources/icell_neuron_culture_protocol.pdf]).Prepare 0.1% PEI solution by diluting 50% PEI solution in borate buffer (see Recipe 3). Filter the 0.1% PEI solution through a 0.22 µm filter. Note: 0.1% PEI solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month.Add 200 µl of 0.1% PEI solution to each well of the MEA plate and incubate plate at room temperature for 1 h.Aspirate the PEI solution from the MEA plate.Rinse each well 4 times with 500 μl sterile water.Air-dry the MEA plate with the lid off in tissue culture hood overnight. Note: It is essential to allow the MEA plate to air-dry overnight to achieve optimal cell adhesion.Seeding neuronsAspirate medium from neurons, and add 1 ml DMEM/F12 to wash neurons once at room temperature.Aspirate DMEM/F12, add 0.5 ml accutase into neurons, and incubate for 5 min in a 37 °C incubator.Add 2 ml DMEM/F12 into cells, and gently pipette up and down several times. Transfer cell suspension into a 15 ml centrifuge tube, and wash plate once using 2 ml DMEM/F12 to transfer all cells into 15 ml centrifuge tube.Re-suspend cells and take 10 µl for viable cell counting using a cell counter.Note: Gentle pipetting is essential to increase cell viability.Spin cells at 201 x g for 4 min at room temperature.Aspirate the supernatant above the cell pellet without disturbing the pellet.Dilute the laminin solution in complete N2B27 medium to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. Note: Thaw laminin stock at 4 °C and don’t vortex laminin solution.Re-suspend the cell pellet using 10 µg/ml laminin solution to a final concentration of 28,000 viable cells/µl.",
    "Seed a 5 µl droplet of the suspension (140,000 cells) directly on the center of each PEI coated well over the recording electrode area. Note: Do not let the tips to touch the MEA plate bottom.Add sterile water to the area surrounding the wells of MEA plate to prevent substrate evaporation (Figure 2A). Note: MEA reservoir water is no longer required following the media addition in step C13.Incubate the MEA plate with the seeded neurons at a 37 °C incubator for 1 h. Note: Do not allow the cell suspension droplets to dry before adding additional complete N2B27 medium.Gently add 100 µl complete N2B27 medium down the side of each well of the MEA plate (Figure 2B).Repeat step C13 four more times to reach a final volume of 500 µl/well.Incubate MEA plate at a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.Next day, aspirate spent medium and add 1 ml fresh N2B27 medium or Brainphys medium (see Recipe 2) supplemented with 20 ng/ml BDNF, 20 ng/ml GDNF, 0.5 mM dbcAMP, and 0.2 mM ascorbic acid.Note: The neurons can be viewed using a phase contrast microscope (Figures 2D-2E).Exchange 50% medium every 2-3 days by aspirating 500 µl of spent medium from each well and adding 500 µl of fresh complete medium. Note: To avoid any influence of immediate medium change on neuronal activity, start recording not earlier than 1 h after the last media change.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171114/20171114181011_9478.jpgFigure 2.

Scale bars = 100 μm.MEA recordings and data acquisitionTurn on the Maestro MEA system using the power switch on the back of the Middleman.Power on AxIS software and click on the temperature icon to 37 °C.Set up experiment in AxIS (Figure 3):Adjust Maestro acquisition settings by selecting neural mode from the configuration. Set analog settings, choose ‘Neural: spikes (1,200 x Gain, 200-5,000 Hz).Use ‘Median’ Referencing to reduce noise in neural mode.Select data streams for recording.Choose recording duration. Note: Neuronal activity is very variable and typically needs at least 5 min for adequate statistics.Add experiment descriptions, notes, and plate maps.Place the MEA plate in the plate cavity (Figure 2C). Note: Do not touch the metal bottom part of MEA plate.Equilibrate the plate on the Maestro for 5-10 min.Click ‘play’ to start the voltage offset and wait until it is complete.Press ‘Start Schedule’ to record data.Data will be automatically saved once the recording is done.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171114/20171114181241_3464.jpgFigure 3. A snapshot of experiment setup in AxISTTX treatmentTetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent neurotoxin, inhibits the firing of action potentials in neurons by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes and blocking the passage of sodium ions into the neuron. Here, we test whether hiPSC-derived neurons can respond to TTX treatment (Figures 4 and 5).Dissolve TTX at a pH of 7.4 in sodium acetate buffer to get 1 mM stock solution.Record baseline for MEA plate before adding TTX.Add 0.5 µl TTX into MEA wells to get a final concentration of 1 µM TTX.Incubate cells for 5 min.Record data after TTX treatment.Wash out TTX using BrainPhys medium and incubate plate overnight.Record neuronal activity after TTX washout.",
    "Data filtering and data extractionSince raw data was sampled at 12.5 kHz, it can be analyzed offline both in the low-frequency band (10-300 Hz), representative of local field potential (LFP) signal (Buzsáki et al., 2012), as well as high-frequency band, representative of action potential (AP) (Quian Quiroga and Panzeri, 2009). For our current study, we chose to focus on the extracellular AP quantification and high-pass filter the data. Filtering of data and spike detection (as timestamps) was performed using AxIS, according to the following steps:Recorded raw data files (.csv) were opened in AxIS. Data were band-pass filtered in the range 200 Hz-3 kHz using the AxIS digital filter to yield multi-unit data. Neuronal spikes were detected using a threshold set to 6 times standard deviation (6SD) above the mean noise level (Pouzat et al., 2002; Obien et al., 2014). A new file (.spk) was obtained for each recording day containing information such as spike timestamps and waveforms, as well as electrode (channel) and well indices.Multiunit spike data were subsequently imported into NEX, which contains a toolbox to identify AxIS .spk data formats. From NEX, spike data was exported into MATLAB as timestamps, and grouped per channel per well.In MATLAB, each individual recording was saved as .mat file, and later loaded for analysis."
