    "1.  Obtaining Pre-injury Neuropsychological Baseline Profile on Subject\nPrior to subject arriving for testing, ensure all equipment is functioning properly and ready for testing and that the room is free from unnecessary distractions.\nAfter reviewing parental and subject consent, measure and record subject's height, weight and head circumference.\nAdminister balance assessment while subject is standing on force plate in the following order of conditions: A1 - on force plate, eyes open; A2 - on force plate, eyes closed; A3 - on force plate while wearing the visual conflict dome. \nPlace AirexBalance-pad on top of force plate and repeat administration of balance assessment conditions (A1-A3) having the subject stand on top of the AirexBalance-pad and force plate combined.\nMeasure and record hand grip strength and administer the grooved pegboard test for both the left and right hands.\nAdminister the jump test on the jump mat, first from a squat position then the counter-movement, completing 3 trials for each position.\nConduct leg maximal voluntary contraction test using the force plate and strength bar.\nAdminister neuropsychological test battery in the following order according to Assessment Manual Instructions: Post-concussion Symptom Scale-Revised; Child Mood Checklist Self-Report; Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire; Rey Complex Figure Test: Copy Trial; Verbal Fluency Test; Rey Complex Figure Test: Immediate Recall Trial; Verbal Working Memory Task; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; Rey Complex Figure Test: Delayed Recall Trial; Rey Complex Figure Test: Recognition Trial; Stroop Color and Word Test; Symbol Digits Modalities Test; Children's Color Trails Test; Visual Working Memory Task; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test: Delayed Recall; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test: Recognition Trial; Children's Paced Auditory Serial Attention Task (see Figure 1 for an illustration of the Verbal and Visual Working Memory tasks).\nScore neuropsychological tests following the corresponding test manual instructions where appropriate.\nEnter all test scores into database.",
    "2.  Acquiring Structural and Functional MRI Baseline Images on Subject\nPrior to the testing session, conduct an MRI screening interview via telephone to ensure participant can safely undergo an MRI.\nUpon arriving for their test session, review consent/assent form with the subject and their parent(s), repeat the MRI screening, provide a thorough orientation and overview of the MRI machine and experiment in an age-appropriate manner.  Ask if the subject has any questions. \nHave subject remove all metal jewelry, accessories and objects from pockets.\nDemonstrate how subject is to respond to stimuli presented during the working memory task through the use of Lumitouch paddles (an MRI-safe 'mouse' with left and right buttons only). \nHave the subject insert ear plugs. \nHave the subject lie down on scanner bed. \nPosition the head in the head coil and stabilize the head using foam inserts and a reminder strap across forehead. Should the participant require corrective lenses to see the computer screen, fit them with MRI-compatible goggles with the appropriate prescription strength.\nMove the scanner bed into the scanner.\nPlace video screen outside bore of scanner and orient subject to mirror on head coil where the working memory task will be projected.\nObtain T1 weighted structural image using 3D spoiled gradient with inversion preparation (3D SPGR-IRprep) (see Table 1 for a complete description of scan parameters).\nAdminister the working memory task and collect functional MRI images using single-shot T2*-weighted imaging with spiral in/out readout7. \nObtain FLAIR image.\nObtain PD/T2 weighted image using dual-echo fast spin echo (2D-FSE-XL) using ASSET.  ASSET is turned off if white matter hyperintensities are seen on FLAIR image. \nObtain T2*-weighted structural images using gradient-recalled echo (GRE).\n Obtain 2 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets (3 if time permits) using single shot echo-planar imaging with dual-spin echo.\nRemove subject from scanner.",
    "3.  Recording the Force and Direction of Hits to the Head using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System\nObtain a proper fit for the hockey helmet on subject's head.\nRemove batteries from helmet and charge fully, then return to helmet.\nEnsure that the helmets and HIT system are transmitting and receiving data, respectively, prior to collecting game data.\nCollect data during game play, recording each hockey period's stop and start time.\nSend data for processing via sync mechanism to Simbex using internet connection.\n4.  Performing Post-mTBI Neuropsychological Follow-up Testing\nOn the same day as an injury report is received, complete the Hit Injury Report Form with the parent to obtain clinical and functional details regarding the injury.\nAdminister the PCS-R to subject and determine current severity of symptoms.\nApproximately day 1 post-injury: administer PCS-R. If symptoms are unresolved (i.e. have not returned to baseline levels), do not administer full neuropsychological test battery. \nIf subject's symptoms permit, complete the balance assessment (refer to 1.3 and 1.4) and jump test (refer to 1.6). \nIf subject's symptoms permit, administer leg maximal voluntary contraction test (refer to 1.7). \nIf subject's symptoms permit once physical testing is completed, administer the verbal and visual working memory task.\nContinue to administer the PCS-R until symptoms have resolved (i.e. return to baseline levels) according to the schedule outlined in Table 2. \nApproximately day 5 post-injury: administer PCS-R. If symptoms are unresolved repeat testing sequence above (refer to 4.3 to 4.6).\nIf symptoms are still unresolved after 7 days post-injury, continue to administer PCS-R weekly until symptoms resolve. \nFor subjects whose symptoms have resolved, repeat steps 1.2 to 1.9. \nProceed to structural and functional MRI follow-up scanning session (refer to Section 5).\n5. Acquiring Structural and Functional MRI Post-mTBI Follow-up Images",
    "Schedule subject for follow-up scanning session within 72 hours post-injury. \nRepeat steps 2.2-2.16 listed above.\nIf symptoms are unresolved at the time of the first follow-up scanning session, schedule a second follow-up scanning session once symptoms are resolved and repeat steps 2.2-2.16 as listed above.\n6.  Performing Matched Control Subject Neuropsychological Follow-up Testing\nExamine ages (i.e. years and months) of all subjects enrolled in experiment and generate a list of potential age and gender-matched control subjects according to birthdates corresponding to within 3 months in the same calendar year for each mTBI subject.\nContact control subjects and schedule testing session.\nReplicate testing protocol to the matched mTBI subject with respect to the timing and number of follow-up sessions. Repeat steps 1.2-1.16 above, as indicated.  For example, if the mTBI subject's symptoms were resolved within 24 hours and they only completed one follow-up testing session that included the entire neuropsychological battery, then replicate this protocol with the matched control subject.\nProceed to structural and functional MRI follow-up scanning session (refer to section 7).\n7.  Acquiring Structural and Functional MRI Matched Control Subject Images\nRepeat steps 2.2-2.16 listed above.\nIf the control subject is matched to a mTBI subject who completed two follow-up scanning sessions due to unresolved symptoms, schedule a second testing session matching the time interval between sessions (i.e. number of days) and repeat steps 2.2-2.16 as listed above.\n8.  Data Analyses\nCalculate descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) for magnitude and number of hits to the head for each player as obtained from the HIT system, normalizing data per player per game.\nCalculate the change score from baseline for each neuropsychological test score across all mTBI and matched control subjects.",
    "Perform a matched samples t-test with group as the between subjects factor (i.e. mTBI versus control) and change in neuropsychological test performance as the dependent variable to analyze the effect of mTBI on neuropsychological function.\nUse the clinical PD/T2-weighted image sets to generate whole-brain volumetric measures to measure global swelling in the brain immediately post-mTBI. \nFor each mTBI subject, the T1-weighted images are used to calculate focal changes in tissue volume using two complimentary calculations of nonlinear deformation fields.  First, register baseline scans to each of the follow-up scans.  Second, calculate the deformation between consecutive pairs of scans, to capture short-term scan-to-scan differences. \nCorrect the DTI data for eddy-current distortions and head motion, and reorient the gradient directions prior to calculating the diffusion tensor parameters. For mTBI versus non-mTBI group studies, use the method of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), recently introduced by the Oxford group8.\nIdentify any white matter hyperintensities on the FLAIR images and microbleeds on the GRE images to separate regions of normal appearing white matter from those that have experienced damage post-mTBI9.  Use these locations to extract quantitative measures derived from DTI (fractional anisotropy, FA, mean diffusivity, D, and radial diffusivity, DR).\nFor the DTI analyses, correlate TBSS voxel values with the HITS telemetery data (i.e. magnitude and number of hits to the head), using the multivariate Partial Least Squares analysis method10 - 13.  Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a multivariate technique that can identify whole-brain patterns of activity that vary with experimental conditions or behaviour. \nPre-process fMRI images via spatial coregistration to an early fiducial volume from the first imaging run to correct for head motion, followed by a 3D Fourier transform interpolation.",
    "Spatially normalize motion-corrected images to an in-house fMRI spiral template using a 12-parameter affine transform with sinc interpolation and smooth with a Gaussian filter of 6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. \nRemove the initial five image volumes in each run, in which transient signal changes occur as brain magnetization reaches a steady state.\nPerform univariate analyses using Statistical Parametric Mapping 2 (SPM2) where vectors identifying the image corresponding to the onset time of each event are convolved with the hemodynamic-response-function (HRF) and entered into a voxel-wise multiple linear regression 14. \nCompute parameter estimates for each of the covariates which reflect changes in BOLD signal per event-type, relative to baseline. \nUse voxel-level t-statistics to perform contrasts comparing activity brain regions that are differentially engaged across tasks (e.g. working memory versus control task) and groups (e.g. mTBI versus controls).\nCombine information from the HIT system (i.e. average magnitude of head impacts for each player) with structural and functional neuroimaging data.  To assess these interrelations, use PLS analysis. \nUse the average magnitude of head impacts for each player to run a behavioural PLS which will relate the average magnitude to differences in brain activity patterns during performance on the working memory task.\n9. Representative Results\nHead Impact Telemetry System",
    "Table 3 depicts quantitative data recorded for corresponding impacts illustrated in Figure 2. Peak linear acceleration is the maximum linear acceleration of a player's head during impact. The units are g's. A g is the acceleration of gravity at sea level (9.8 meters per second squared). Peak rotational acceleration is the maximum rotational acceleration of a player's head during impact. The units are radians per second squared. Azimuth is a measure of impact location. Azimuth is defined from -180° to 180° with 0° at the back of the head and positive azimuth to the right side of the head.  Elevation is the other measure of impact location. Elevation is defined from 0° (horizontal plane passing through the head center of gravity) to 90° (crown of the head).\nFunctional MRI\nFigure 3 depicts serial fMRI results from a) concussed athletes with symptom resolution and b) with no symptom resolution.
