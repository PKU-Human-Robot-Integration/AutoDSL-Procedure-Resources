  "procedures": [
    "All experimental procedures with animals were performed at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). The care of animals and experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the UTHSC, which is an institution accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.\n1. Enrichment of tissues and cells using methyl-β-cyclodextrin saturated with cholesterol\nNOTE: The cholesterol enrichment protocol below is suitable for tissues, cells, and cell lines. As an example, we describe the steps performed for enriching mammalian cerebral arteries. Representative results are provided for both cerebral arteries (Figure 1) and neurons (Figure 4).\nPreparation of MβCD saturated with cholesterol\n\t\nWeigh 0.064 g of MβCD and dissolve it in a flask containing 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to obtain a final concentration of 5 mM MβCD. Stir the solution with a stir bar to ensure that the MβCD is fully dissolved.\nWeigh 0.0024 g of cholesterol powder and add it to the same flask to obtain a 0.63 mM cholesterol concentration. Then stir the solution vigorously. Use a spatula to break up as many cholesterol chunks as possible (some chunks will remain until incubation).\nCover the flask with at least two layers of paraffin film and shake slowly (~30 oscillations/min) in a 37 °C water bath overnight. This step is critical.\nAfter 8-16 h, cool the solution to room temperature (RT), and then filter it through a 0.22 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter into a glass bottle.",
    "NOTE: To reach different cholesterol concentrations in solution, adjust the amounts of both cholesterol and MβCD by simple proportion. It is important to maintain the MβCD:cholesterol molar ratio at 8:1 to obtain saturation of methyl-β-cyclodextrin carrier with cholesterol. The cholesterol-enriching solution can be used immediately or over the course of several days if stored at 4 °C. However, the cholesterol-enriching ability declines over time as the cholesterol aggregates appear, and the solution becomes cloudy.\nTreatment of cerebral arteries with MβCD saturated with cholesterol\n\t\nEuthanize a Sprague Dawley rat (250-300 g) by placing it in a chamber with 2% isoflurane. Then, decapitate the anesthetized rat using a sharp guillotine or a large sharp pair of scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: If performing these procedures regularly, it is useful to develop a schedule for guillotine sharpening. Also, a separate pair of scissors should be dedicated for rodent decapitation. Rodent decapitation is a terminal procedure; therefore, the instruments do not have to be sterile. Cleaning with soapy water after each use is sufficient.\nPosition the rat's head facing forward, away from the researcher. Place the pointed part of a medium sized pair of scissors between the skull and the brain stem, and cut laterally on both sides.\nUse forceps to pry the top skull open by pulling up on the base of the skull where the lateral cuts were made and carefully remove the brain. Make sure to cut the optical nerves that hold the brain within the skull.\nPut the brain in a beaker with PBS on ice after removal.\n\t\tNOTE: The brain can be stored on ice for 4-6 h at 4 °C.\nIn a nonsterile environment transfer the rat brain to a waxed dissection bowl with enough PBS to submerge it. Pin the brain down to keep it from moving.",
    "NOTE: Step 1.2.5 can be carried out at RT if performed quickly. Otherwise, it needs to be done on ice.\nUse sharp forceps and small surgical scissors to dissect the cerebral arteries and their branches that form the Circle of Willis at the base of the brain under the microscope in PBS at RT. Be gentle when dissecting to ensure that the artery tissue is not stretched or cut. This step is critical.\nBriefly rinse the artery segments (up to 1 cm long) in PBS either in a 96 well plate or in a 35 mm dish to remove the leftover blood, and then place them for 10 min into enough of the cholesterol-enriching solution (prepared in step 1.1) to cover the entire artery segments. Use a 35 mm dish if there is an ample amount of cholesterol-enriching solution and a 96 well plate if the arteries are small or if there is a shortage of cholesterol-enriching solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The same approach can be used to enrich other tissues and cells with cholesterol using a 60 min incubation time. For example, this approach has been previously used for cholesterol enrichment of mouse cerebral arteries35,45, hippocampal neurons32, atrial myocytes37, and HEK 293 cells39. The minimal incubation time needs to be determined for each tissue or cell type based on the validation of cholesterol enrichment at different time points with a cholesterol-sensitive assay (e.g., the biochemical determination of the amount of cholesterol in the tissue by staining with the cholesterol-sensitive fluorescence dye filipin).\nStain the artery tissue with the steroid-sensitive fluorescence dye filipin to determine any alterations in cholesterol levels.",
    "NOTE: In the Representative Results section, we demonstrate the results of two approaches to assess changes in cholesterol levels: a biochemical assay performed through the application of a commercially available cholesterol oxidase-based kit (see Table of Materials) and staining with the steroid-sensitive fluorescence dye filipin. The first approach can be performed by following the manufacturer's instructions. The protocol for the latter approach is provided below.\n\t\nUsing a fresh bottle of filipin powder, prepare a 10 mg/mL stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This step is critical.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting solution is light-sensitive. If prepared correctly, the filipin stock solution is yellowish. Some filipin powder may stick to the bottle cap. Therefore, it is important to rinse the bottle and cap with DMSO solvent to retain the entire amount of filipin. Once prepared, filipin stock must be used within several days. Filipin completely loses its fluorescence ability after 5 days, even when stored in the dark at -20 °C.\nRemove the artery segments from the cholesterol-enriching solution and wash them 3x with PBS for 5 min.\nFix the artery segments in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice.\n\t\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is light-sensitive. Therefore, work must be carried out in the dark.\nPlace the artery segments into 0.5% Triton in PBS at RT for 10 min to permeabilize the tissue and facilitate dye penetration.\nWash the artery segments 3x with PBS for 5 min on a shaker. This step is critical.\n\t\tNOTE: When the Triton has been completely washed out, there should not be any bubbles on the surface of the PBS solution.\nDilute the filipin stock solution in PBS to a final concentration of 25 μg/mL. Remove the arteries form the PBS solution and place them in the diluted filipin solution for 1 h in the dark. This step is critical.",
    "Wash out the filipin by rinsing the artery segments 3x with PBS for 5 min on a shaker. This step is critical.\nRinse the artery segments briefly with distilled water, absorb excessive liquid with a paper napkin, and mount the arteries on a slide using commercially available mounting media (see Table of Materials).\nCover the artery with a coverslip avoiding rolling or twisting of the artery and set the slides to dry in a dark area at RT for 24 h.\nAfter the mounting media dries, seal the coverslip edges with clear nail polish, and leave the nail polish to dry for 10-15 min. Store the slides in the dark at -20 °C.\nEquilibrate the slides to RT before imaging.\nImage the tissue with a fluorescence microscope or a fluorescence reader with the excitation set at 340-380 nm and emission at 385-470 nm.\n\t\tCAUTION: Filipin photobleaches quickly; thus, samples have to be imaged promptly.\n2. Enrichment of Xenopus oocytes using cholesterol-enriched phospholipid-based dispersions (liposomes)\nPreparation of solutions\n\t\nTo prepare a stock solution of cholesterol, dissolve 10 mg of cholesterol powder in 1 mL of chloroform in a 10 mL glass beaker or bottle. Transfer the solution into a 1.5 mL capped glass bottle.\n\t\tCAUTION: In view of the toxicity and rapid evaporation of chloroform, work in the hood and keep reagents on ice.",
    "Prepare a 150 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HEPES, pH = 7.4 buffer for cholesterol-enriched phospholipids. To do so, dissolve in an Erlenmeyer flask 5.5905 g of KCl and 0.6057 g of Tris in double-distilled water to a total of 0.5 L volume. In another flask, dissolve 5.5905 g of KCl and 1.19155 g of HEPES in double-distilled water to a total of 0.5 L volume. Mix the two solutions together in a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask, and adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the resulting 150 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HEPES solution at 4 °C.\nTo prepare ND96 pre-medium oocyte culturing (low K+, low Ca2+) buffer, combine 1 mL of 2 M KCl, 1 mL of 1 M MgCl2, 45.5 mL of 2 M NaCl, and 5 mL of 1/1 M NaOH-HEPES in a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask. Add 900 mL double-distilled water and adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Transfer the solution to a 1 L cylinder and bring the volume to 1 L with double-distilled water. Then add 1.8 mL of 1 M CaCl2 and filter the solution.",
    "NOTE: Slight variations in the ratios between the components used to make an ND96 solution do not seem to be critical for cholesterol enrichment, possibly because the ND96 solution is not used during the enrichment step itself but for storage. An example is a 1 L solution that has a slightly lower concentration of sodium and chloride ions, and is made by combining 2 mL of 1 M KCl, 1 mL of 1 M MgCl2, 82.5 mL of 1 M NaCl, 5 mL of 1 M HEPES, and 1.8 mL of 1 M CaCl2 (Ca2+ is omitted to obtain a Ca2+ free solution). Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.4 with NaOH. Store the resulting ND96 oocyte culturing solution at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPreparation of the phospholipid-based dispersion with cholesterol liposomes\n\t\nIn a 12 mL glass tube, combine 200 μL of each of the following 10 mg/mL chloroform-dissolved lipid solutions: L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine, and cholesterol.\nEvaporate the chloroform in the hood to dry slowly under a stream of nitrogen. This step is critical.\nSuspend the lipids in 800 μL of buffered solution consisting of 150 mM KCl and 10 mM Tris-HEPES at pH = 7.4, and cover with paraffin film.\nSonicate gently at 80 kHz for 10 min until a milky mixture is formed. This step is critical.\n\t\tCAUTION: When sonicating, the dispersion in the glass tube should vibrate gently, forming small waves. Drops of dispersion should not be jumping within the tube.\nEnriching Xenopus oocytes with cholesterol",
    "NOTE: Frog oocyte-containing ovaries can be obtained from two sources: First, Xenopus laevis female frogs can be housed for the purpose of in-house surgery. This procedure must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Second, whole ovaries can be purchased from commercial suppliers. As an alternative to purchasing or isolating whole ovaries and then digesting them as described in steps 2.3.1-2.3.4, individual oocytes are available commercially for purchase. If the latter are used, steps 2.3.1-2.3.4 can be skipped.\n\t\nKeep the freshly obtained ovaries at ~14 °C in an ND96 solution. Under these conditions, the ovaries can be stored for up to 1 week.\nTo obtain individual oocytes, disrupt the ovarian sac in multiple places using sharp forceps. Place the ovary chunks into a 60 mm plate, with 5 mL of Ca2+-free ND96 supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL collagenase. Shake on an orbital shaker at 60 oscillations/min for 15 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: This step will ensure the digestion of the ovarian sac. To preserve enzymatic activity, avoid storing collagenase containing ND96 for extended periods of time (>1 h). Even brief storage should be performed at cool temperatures of under 15 °C.\nUsing a transfer pipette with a wide tip, vigorously pipette the oocyte-containing solution up and down approximately 5-10x to separate individual oocytes. At this step, the solution will turn dark.\nQuickly rinse the oocytes with Ca2+-free ND96 until the solution becomes transparent.\nTransfer individual oocytes to Ca2+-containing ND-96 solution supplemented with 2 mg/mL of gentamicin using a transfer pipette with a narrow tip.",
    "NOTE: This step is essential when it is necessary to store the oocytes. Individual oocytes can be stored in an incubator for several days at 14-17 °C. However, dead oocytes that are whitish must be removed at least once a day to avoid contamination of the solution with toxic chemicals.\nTransfer 90 μL of the cholesterol-enriched phospholipid-based dispersion into one well of a 96 well plate.\nTransfer up to six oocytes from the ND96 medium to the well with as little medium as possible. This step is critical.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not expose the oocytes to the air during the transfer to keep the oocytes intact.\nPlace the 96 well plate on a three-dimensional platform rotator to provide a small orbital motion to the oocytes in the cell for 5-10 min.\nAdd a drop of ND96 into the well, and transfer the cholesterol-enriched oocytes from the 96 well plate to a 35 mm plate with ND96 for immediate use. This step is critical.\nUse a commercially available cholesterol oxidase-based kit (see Table of Materials) to assess changes in cholesterol levels by following the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
