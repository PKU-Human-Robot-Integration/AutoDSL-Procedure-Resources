  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The NLR-seq protocol consists of three consecutive steps: 1) extraction of high-molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA; 2) ultra-long DNA library construction, which includes fragmentation of the HMW DNA into the desired sizes and ligation of sequencing adapters to the DNA ends; and 3) loading of the adapter-ligated DNA onto the arrays of nanopores (Figure 1).\n1. HMW DNA extraction\nReagent setup. Make 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (1,000 mL) by adding 100 mL of PBS (10x) to 900 mL of water and mix well. Make lysis buffer (50 mL) by adding 43.5 mL of water to a 50 mL tube. Add 500 μL of Tris (1 M, pH 8.0), 1 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl) (5 M), 2.5 mL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.5 M, pH 8.0) and 2.5 mL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (10%, wt/vol) to the tube and mix well.\n\tNOTE: This PBS buffer can be stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months. The premade lysis buffer can be stored at RT for up to 2 months.\nCheck the cell mortality and count the cells. Ensure that the live ratio is > 85% and the total cell number is 30 x 106.\n\tNOTE: The cells used in this protocol are from the HG00733 cell line, a human lymphoblastoid cell line of Puerto Rican origin widely used in the 1000 Genome consortium for structural variation analysis (see table of materials for ordering information), which belongs to International Genome Sample Resource.\nCollect the cells by centrifuging at 200 x g for 5 min at RT. Discard the medium and resuspend the cell pellet (30 x 106 cells) with 5 mL of 1x PBS buffer. Centrifuge again at 200 x g for 5 min at RT and discard the supernatant.",
    "NOTE: 25-35 x 106 of cells are acceptable for this approach. Further variation in the amount of cells used will need further optimization. The cell pellet can be stored at −80 °C for up to 6 months.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of 1x PBS buffer. If using a frozen cell pellet, wash with 5 mL of 1x PBS buffer. Centrifuge the solution at 200 x g for 5 min at RT, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 200 μL of 1x PBS buffer.\nPrepare 10 mL of lysis buffer in a 50 mL tube. Add the 200 μL cell suspension to the lysis buffer and vortex at the highest speed for 3 s. Incubate the solution at 37 °C for 1 h.\nAdd 2 μL of RNase A (100 mg/mL) to the lysate. Gently rotate the 50 mL tube to mix the sample. Incubate the solution at 37 °C for 1 h.\nAdd 50 μL proteinase K (20 mg/mL) to the lysate. Gently rotate the 50 mL tube to mix the sample. Incubate the solution at 50 °C for 2 h. During incubation, gently mix the sample every 30 min.\nRemove the 50 mL tube from 50 °C and let stand at RT for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL of the phenol layer of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, vol/vol/vol) to the lysate and rotate the tube on a rotator mixer (see Table of Materials) at RT in a fume hood at 20 rpm for 10 min. Wrap the tube cap with parafilm to prevent leakage during rotation.\nPrepare two 50 mL gel tubes (see Table of Materials) by centrifuging at 1,500 x g for 2 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: The gel forms a stable barrier between the nucleic acid-containing aqueous phase and the organic solvent.",
    "Pour the sample/phenol solution into one of the prepared 50 mL gel tubes from Step 1.10. Centrifuge the solution at 3,000 x g for 10 min at RT.\nPour the supernatant into a new 50 mL tube. Add 10 mL of the phenol layer of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, vol/vol/vol) and rotate the tube on a rotator mixer at RT in a fume hood at 20 rpm for 10 min.\nRepeat step 1.11 once with the second prepared gel tube.\nPour the supernatant into a new 50 mL tube. Add 25 mL of ice-cold 100% ethanol and gently rotate the tube by hand until the DNA precipitates (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The precipitation approach helps to stabilize the HMW DNA.\nBend a 20 μL tip to make a hook. Carefully take out the HMW DNA with the hook and let the liquid drop off.\nPlace the HMW DNA into a 50 mL tube containing 40 mL of 70% ethanol. Wash the DNA by gently inverting the tube 3 times.\nRepeat step 1.15 once to collect DNA from the 70% ethanol tube.\nPlace the HMW DNA into a 2 mL tube containing 1.8 mL of 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the washed HMW DNA at 10,000 x g for 3 s at RT. Remove as much of the residual ethanol as possible by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Do not disturb the DNA pellet when pipetting the residual ethanol.\nIncubate the 2 mL tube at 37 °C for 10 min with the lid open to dry the sample.\n\t\nIf continuing with step 2.1 (with mechanical shearing and 1D Ligation Sequencing Kit), add 1 mL of TE (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to the 2 mL tube.",
    "If continuing with Step 2.2 (with transposase-based fragmentation and Rapid Sequencing Kit), add 200 μL of 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) with 0.02% Triton X-100.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not disturb the DNA pellet. Letting the tube stand at 4 °C in dark for 48 h will help the sample fully resuspend. The HMW DNA can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. Longer storage time or other storage conditions may introduce more short fragments.\n2. Ultra-long DNA library construction\nNOTE: There are two ways to construct the ultra-long DNA libraries based on two different shearing methods coupled with nanopore sequencing kits. A mechanical shearing-based library produces data with an N50 of 50-70 kb, taking about 8 h for the library construction. A transposase fragmentation-based library produces an N50 of 90-100 kb data, taking only 90 min for the library construction. The mechanical shearing protocol gives higher yield from the same DNA input using identical versions of sequencing adapter and quality of nanopore flow cells.\nMechanical shearing-based library construction\n\t\nThaw and mix the reagents from the ligation kit (see Table of Materials). Thaw FFPE DNA repair buffer and end repair/dA-tailing buffer on ice, then vortex and spin down to mix. Thaw adapter mix (AMX) and adapter bead binding buffer (ABB) on ice, then pipette and spin down to mix. Thaw running buffer with fuel mix (RBF) and elution buffer (ELB) at RT, then vortex and spin down to mix. Thaw library loading beads (LLB) at RT and pipette to mix before use.\n\t\t\nOnce thawed, keep all kit components on ice. Take out the enzymes only when needed. Bring the magnetic beads to RT for use.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For recommendations on the magnetic beads to use see the table of materials.",
    "Check the quality and quantity of the HMW DNA from step 1.21.1. Pipette out 20 μL of DNA into new 1.5 mL tubes from three different locations in the HMW DNA tube using P200 wide bore tips. Take 1 μL from the three aliquots to detect the concentration using a fluorometer and the quality using a UV reading. Check multiple times to confirm the results.\n\t\tNOTE: The expected results are shown in Figure 3A. The OD260/280 value is approximately 1.9 and the OD260/230 value is approximately 2.3.\nTransfer the remaining 940 μL of HMW DNA into a 50 mL tube cap with a P1000 wide bore tip.\nAspirate all DNA into a 1 mL syringe without the needle.\nPut the 27 G needle onto the syringe and eject all DNA into the cap gently and slowly (~10 s). Take off the 27 G needle from the syringe.\nRepeat steps 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 for 29 times for a total of 30 passes through the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: The sheared HMW DNA can be stored at 4 °C in the dark for up to 24 h. Quality control (QC) is highly recommended by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, but it is costly and time consuming. If performing QC on an automated pulse field gel electrophoresis machine use a 5-150 kb protocol for a 20 h run. The expected results are shown in Figure 4.\nPrepare the DNA repair reaction in a 0.2 mL tube by adding 100 μL of sheared HMW DNA (20 μg), 15 μL of FFPE DNA repair buffer, 12 μL of FFPE DNA repair mix, and 16 μL of nuclease-free water.

The library can be stored on ice for up to 2 h until loading for sequencing if needed.\n3. Sequencing on the nanopore device\nCheck the nanopore sequencing device (see Table of Materials). Make sure both the software and hardware are working and there is enough storage space.\nCheck the flow cell. Open a new flow cell and insert the flow cell into the nanopore device. Check the box of the location the flow cell was inserted into (X1-X5). Select the correct flow cell type. Click on the Check Flow Cells workflow. Click on the Start Test button to start the flow cell QC analysis.\n\tNOTE: If the reported total active pore number is less than 800, use a different new flow cell for sequencing.\nPrepare the priming buffer. For a mechanical shearing-based library, add 576 μL of running buffer with fuel mix (RBF) and 624 μL of nuclease-free water into a 1.5 mL tube. Vortex and spin down to mix the priming buffer.
