    "All participants provided written informed consent. Life Laboratory participants are asked to live their lives as they normally would to allow longitudinal observational study of their life activities and patterns for the rest of their lives. They may withdraw at any time if they wish. The study protocol was approved by the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) Institutional Review Board (Life Laboratory OHSU IRB #2765).\n1. Preparation\nPrior to deployment, add all equipment to the Console inventory system online. Assign a name to each device or sensor along with its serial number and MAC address, allowing it to be stored within the Console inventory system.\nPlace a QR code tag on each piece of equipment, enabling specific assignments of home location for the sensors and devices when deployed in home.\nBefore deployment, all sensors and devices that are to be installed will be assigned to the home by scanning the QR code on the sensor or device. This will bring up a website that allows sensor or device assignment to that specific home.\nInstall the hub computer with a SD card which contains the hub configuration management tool.\nPack all the now inventoried sensors and equipment, hub computer with installed SD card into an installation kit (box) for home deployment.\nVerify that the participant's home has an Internet service provider.\n2. Home Deployment\nSet up the hub computer by inserting the wireless dongle and the primary ZigBee coordinator dongle into the hub computer. Insert the Ethernet cable into the hub computer. Lastly, plug the hub computer's power cord into a centrally located room's power socket and connect the Ethernet cable to the home's Internet connection.\n\tNote: The configuration management tool will ensure that it is using the most current version of the software.",
    "Connect an Internet enabled device (laptop, tablet, cell phone) to the hub computer'swireless network to access the local control panel website. The control panel website will show the status of the hub computer, as well as any sensors installed in the home (Figure 3).\nRun the software configuration tool, ensuring the appropriate software is installed. Do this by navigating to the control panel and running Update.\nNavigate to the control panel to check that the hub computer is communicating with the main servers. Make sure that the services that allow data to be collected from each installed device and sensor are up and running.\nAdd the sensors to the home, beginning with the motion sensors. Start by opening the sensor placement website from the control panel.\n\tNOTE: If the home requires more than 16 motion sensors, connect a router dongle into the hub computer and add it to the home or personal area network, also called the \"PAN.\" Once the extension dongles (if needed) are added to the PAN, remove them from the hub computer and plug them into outlets spread throughout the home, creating a network around the home that will send the motion sensor data to the hub computer.\nIn the sensor placement website, create a virtual floor plan of the home, including all the rooms and egress doors. Make sure to select the Sensor Line as one of the areas that is added to the floor plan. Add virtual representations of sensors to the floor plan. Lastly, link the virtual representations of home areas to other each other - in a way that reflects the physical layout of the home - and to the virtual representations of the sensors.",
    "Add each successive sensor to the PAN - known as the Personal Area Network - by using the sensor placement tool and physically pressing a button near the sensor's battery. Then, start attaching each sensor to the room or area in the home that is represented in the virtual floor plan.\nContinue attaching the physical sensors to the walls of the home. Place each wall sensor at head height in each room (kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms) ensuring that the sensor only captures the activity in that room and does not pick up the activity from another area (for example, avoid someone walking down a hallway being picked up by the sensor in a room next to the hallway).\n\tNOTE: The sensor placement tool allows you to identify and create pathways between rooms.\nInstall a row of four restricted field (ceiling) sensors in a straight walkway (hallways or other areas where the participants must walk past each of the four sensors without a change in pace) on the ceiling to capture walking speed.\n\t\nSpace these walking speed sensors 61 cm (2 feet) apart.\nRecord the exact distance between the restricted field sensors in the sensor placement website.\nInstall door sensors on each egress door, again using the floor plan on the sensor placement website to indicate their physical location.\nAdd the pillbox to the PAN, confirming that the device has been assigned to the home inventory. Then activate the device by opening one of its lids. Because the pillbox communicates with the hub computer, ensure it is close enough to the hub computer for its signal to be detected.\n\tNote: The pillbox is frequently kept in the kitchen or bathroom based on participant preference.",
    "To setup the scale, navigate to the scale page, located within the Devices tab in the control panel.\n\t\nOn the scale, press the side power button for 10 seconds. The scale should display a confirmation message.\nOnce the scale shows up in the list of devices, click the Setup button on the right side of the control panel to start the setup process.\nEnter the participant's height and weight when prompted in the control panel.\nIf the participant does not have a pacemaker, toggle the Pacemaker button in the control panel notifying the scale that it can collect bioimpedence data.\nPlace the scale in a location that has a flat, solid surface easily accessible to the participant (typically in a bathroom).\nHave the participant weigh themselves, confirming the scale is recording their initial weight which is entered into the control panel.\nSet up the wrist worn wearable device by opening the wearable control panel setup page and pressing the reset button located on the back side of the device ten times.\n\t\nAfter the device shows up in the list of devices in the control panel and click the Setup button on the right side of the control panel to start the setup process.\nOnce the account is set up, calibrate the time by using the wheel tool on the setup page.\nFinalize the setup by synchronizing the wearable with the hub computer. Click the Sync button in the control panel to confirm that the device is connecting properly and the time is set to the same time as the hub computer.\nIndicate in Console on which wrist the wearable is intended to be worn by the participant.",
    "NOTE: Different devices may require different procedures depending on the manufacturer. Additional sensors and devices may also be deployed and integrated into the data stream such as computer use software and driving sensors. Procedures for adding these are given next.\nInstall the commercial computer use monitoring software on the participant's computer and record their e-mail address. These e-mail addresses are used to send and receive weekly online health and activity surveys.\n\t\nVerify that the participant's computer operating system is compatible with the commercial computer use monitoring software.\nInstall the software on the participant's computer using the installation program hosted on a USB flash drive.\nVerify that the software is operational on the computer by opening the Task Manager and checking that the software is in the list of Applications.\nIn the Console inventory system, associate the software program with the participant's profile.\n\t\tNOTE: See the Table of Materials for the specific computer use software used (other commercially available monitoring software can be substituted).\nSetup a driving sensor for participants\n\t\nVerify that the participant's car was made after 1996 and that the car is supported by the driving sensor device software.\nInstall the driving monitoring device's app on a mobile device and use the app to setup the adapter.\nWith the car turned off, plug the adapter into the car's on-board diagnostic (ODB) port.\nWait for the app to recognize and connect to the adapter. This should take 2 - 4 min.\nInsert the car key into the ignition. (If the car has keyless ignition, press the car's start button). Turn the key to the position where it switches on the electric power without starting the engine.\nWait for the app to finish setting up the adapter.",
    "In the Console inventory system, add the participant's account information from the app in order to allow the adapter's data to be transferred to the ORCATECH servers using the commercial software's application programming interface (API).\n\t\tNOTE: See the Table of Materials for the specific driving monitoring device used.\n3. System Confirmation\nOnce all devices are in their final places in the home, confirm that the hub computer is working properly by navigating to the control panel. Check that the hub computer can communicate with the main servers to transfer data and the services to collect the data for each device type are running.\nReview if data is streaming from each device by navigating to the data collection page on the control panel.\nWalk near the motion sensors installed in each room in the home in order to confirm each sensor is collecting data about recent movements. Check the motion sensors by viewing the live graph of the motion sensor data activated by walking through the home.\nCheck the pillbox by opening and closing each of the compartment doors of the pillbox a few times. Review the data collection page on the control panel to see if this recent activity was measured and collected.\nCheck the scale by weighing yourself or the participant. Confirm this data is properly synched and transmitted by navigating to the Synched column within the scale Devices page in the control panel.\nCheck if the wearable device is properly synched and transmitting data by navigating to the Synched column within the wearable Devices page in the control panel.\nSubscription Required.
