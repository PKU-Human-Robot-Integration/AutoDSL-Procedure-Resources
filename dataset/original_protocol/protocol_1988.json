    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal dissection and retinal explant preparation\nTiming: 10–15 min for each pair of eyes; 2–3 h for dissecting a cohort of approximately 15–30 eyes\nThis section describes the detailed procedure of dissecting the retina and flatmounting the explant in culture. The techniques outlined can be adapted to retinal tissue derived from other species.\nEuthanize 6- to 12-week-old mice using either deep anesthesia with intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine or CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation, in accordance with AVMA Guidelines for Euthanasia of Animals.\nNote: Consistency in animal age ensures homogeneity in retinal tissue architecture and transplantation results.\nEnucleate eyes by clasping behind the globe using Dumont #7 curved forceps and applying brisk outward force.\nImmediately place eyes in ice cold DPBS. Transport enucleated eyes to the dissection hood for explantation.\nCritical: Euthanize one animal at a time. A skilled dissectionist can flatmount retinas from one pair of eyes in approximately 6–10 min. During retinal dissection, an assistant can expedite the process by euthanizing and enucleating the next animal.\nExplant the retina from the globe. Begin by using a 30-gauge needle to puncture the sclera at the limbus and then use Vannas scissors to incise the sclera just posterior to the limbus circumferentially (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1D; Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1586-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Retinal dissection from an enucleated mouse eye\n(A) An enucleated mouse eye submerged in PBS.\n(B) Grasp the sclera or a stump of residual extraocular muscle with Dumont Forceps #5 and secure the eye in position. Create a puncture in the sclera across the globe using a 30-gauge needle.\n(C) The dotted circle indicates the scleral puncture.",
    "(D) Grasp the anterior sclera at the edge of the puncture with the Dumont Forceps #5 and create a circumferential incision parallel to and just posterior to the limbus with Vannas scissors.\n(E) Remove the cornea from the posterior eye cup by holding the eye at the limbus with forceps.\n(F) Use a second pair of forceps to hold the posterior cup at the optic nerve to create traction.\n(G) While securing the optic nerve with forceps, pull away the crystalline lens with a second pair of forceps.\n(H) An inside view of an isolated posterior cup shows the neuroretina surrounded by retinal pigmented epithelium and sclera.\n(I) Use a pair of forceps to grab the scleral edge and begin folding back the sclera from the retina.\n(J) Continue to use both pairs of forceps to peel back the sclera from the retina and work circumferentially around the limbal edge.\n(K) Evert the sclera to prolapse the retina.\n(L) Continue to gently separate the retina from the sclera.\n(M) The scleral cup is now completely everted and only attached to the retina at the optic nerve head.\n(N) Secure the sclera with forceps and create four radial incisions within the retina.\n(O) Even with relaxing cuts, the retina still retains a folded shape at this stage.\n(P) Make the final radial incision in the retina. Relaxing incisions are 90 degrees apart.\n(Q) Detach the retina from the sclera by axotomizing RGCs at the optic nerve head with the Vannas scissors.\n(R) Aspirate the free-floating retina using a P1000 pipette with a widened tip.\n(S) A view showing the retina inside the P1000 pipette tip.\n(T) Transfer the retina onto the center of a culture insert and position the retina with the inner retina facing up.",
    "(U) Aspirate the excess PBS around the retina. The retina edges will start unfolding and flattening.\n(V) An alternative method of unfolding the edge is by using a bent vascular probe to engage the overlying fluid and use surface tension to draw the folded retina peripherally.\n(W) Use the surface tension between the vascular probe and the folded surface to flatten out the retina.\n(X) The flatmounted retina on the culture membrane. Scale bar, 2 mm.\nSeparate the anterior and posterior segments of the globe (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nRemove and discard the anterior segment including the crystalline lens (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nGrasp the sclera of the posterior segment with #5 forceps and evert the posterior eye cup by applying pressure to the optic nerve posteriorly (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H–1M).\nNote: This will separate the neural retina from the retinal pigmented epithelium (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: Small amount of RPE remain attached to the retina will not affect the explant culture or subsequent imaging.\nCritical: To avoid explant culture contamination, perform dissection in a sterilized hood. Additionally, sterilize all dissection tools prior to use and between animals.\nCritical: Avoid iatrogenic damage to the retinal tissue during dissection, as it induces surface disruption and glial reactivity. Do not touch the retinal tissue with dissecting instruments. Instead, peel the non-retinal tissue away from the neural retina to achieve retinal isolation.\nPrior to separating the retina from the eye cup, create 4 radial relaxing incisions in the retina from the periphery halfway to the optic nerve with Vannas scissors (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]N–1P), which are necessary to mount the semispherical retina onto a flat membrane. Then, detach the retina by cutting the optic nerve posterior to the retina using Vannas scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Q) (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Carefully transfer the free-floating retinas in PBS onto organotypic culture inserts using a sterile P1000 pipette with tip widened by cutting with a straight razor (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]R and 1S).\nOrient the retina inside a culture insert with the RGC layer (RGCL) facing up (photoreceptors against the membrane). The retina naturally curls with the photoreceptor side outward, and the retinal vessels are visible on the RGCL side.\nUsing a P200 pipette, slowly aspirate excess PBS until the retina is flatmounted on the dry filter (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]T and 1U).\nUse surface tension between the pipette tip or vascular probe and the retinal tissue to draw the edges of retinal explant out such that they lie flat, rather than folded (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]V and 1W). Avoid touching the retinal tissue directly with the pipette tip or vascular probe (Methods videos S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: The natural curvature of the retinal tissue creates a tendency for the tissue to fold inward. The inner retinal surface (RGCL/vitreous side) must face up when flattened (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]X).\nCritical: Cell and tissue culture inserts are available with several options for membrane composition. We have found that hydrophilic PTFE membrane with 0.4 μm pore size (PICM0RG50) works well for culturing organotypic retinal explants.\nApply Whatman paper to the undersurface of the organotypic membrane to remove residual fluid and create suction to adhere the retinal tissue to the membrane.\nPlace the culture insert with the flatmounted retina in the 6-well plate.\nNote: Avoid introduction of air bubbles underneath the filter during this step.\nThe culture media underlying the filter feeds the organotypic retinal explants, which remain under a thin air-fluid interface.\nPlace the culture plate back in the incubator.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Flattening the retina with vascular probe; related to Step-by-step method details, step 5\nPronase treatment and enzyme inhibition\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the preparation of the Pronase enzyme to be used on flatmounted retinal explant. The enzyme should be prepared prior to dissection; it is stable for several hours at room temperature (20°C).\nWork with one 6-well plate at a time in the dissection hood while the rest of the plates remain in the incubator.\nUsing a P10 pipette, dispense 5 μL of 0.6 U/mL Pronase on to the surface of each retina.\nDirectly visualize the enzyme application onto the retinal surface using a dissecting microscope as a centrally-placed droplet will remain confined to the retina due to the surface tension of the air-fluid interface (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nStart a timer for 60 min once the first retina receives the enzyme.\nReturn the completed 6-well plate back into the incubator before taking out the next plate for enzyme treatment.",
    "Critical: To dry the external surface of the pipette tip prior to each application, gently wipe the tip with Kimwipe in a single forward motion. Failure to do so will result in the droplet adhering to the side of the pipette tip instead of dispensing onto the retinal surface. While contamination from this step is rare, use a new box of Kimwipe for each experiment to limit contamination. Avoid touching the surface of the Kimwipe that will contact the pipette tip.\nCritical: The pipette should be angled as vertically as possible (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B), with pipette tip aimed at the optic nerve head to ensure equal distribution of the droplet on the retinal surface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1586-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pipetting technique\n(A) Position the pipette tip over the optic nerve head.\n(B) Pipette a droplet directly over the retina; the dotted line demarcates the edge of the droplet.\n(C) The droplet distributes evenly around the central retina. Scale bar, 2 mm.\nPrepare the Inhibitor Solution during enzymatic ILM digestion. The complete list of ingredients is in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nNote: Since the Inhibitor Solution contains bovine serum albumin (BSA), it should be made fresh, immediately prior to use.\nFilter the final Inhibitor Solution with a 0.22 μm syringe filter.\nKeep the solution at room temperature (20°C) until use.\nAfter 1 h of enzyme treatment, add 300 μL of the Inhibitor Solution to the surface of each retina.\nNote: This volume of fluid will not remain confined to the retinal surface and will spill over onto the filter.\nSpace out the timing of Inhibitor Solution treatment to ensure that each individual retina has completed the 1-h enzymatic digestion.\nAfter Inhibitor Solution has been added, place the plates back in the incubator for 15 min.",
    "Critical: Reduce surface tension on the retina by ensuring the Inhibitor Solution completely submerges the retinal tissue. Failure to do so may result in partial or complete detachment of the retina from the membrane.\nFill the culture inserts with BSS (2 mL) to dilute the enzyme and inhibitors.\nAdd BSS to all the culture inserts before moving to the next step.\nDry the inside and the bottom of the culture membrane by removing the BSS and blotting the underside with Whatman paper.\nAfter properly drying, the culture insert membrane becomes firm and taut, and can be placed in a fresh set of 6-well plates with 1.5 mL of culture media in each well.\nPlace the plates with the culture inserts back in the 37°C incubator until the next day.\nNote: As with using Kimwipe, Whatman paper does not require sterilization prior to use. However, practice proper antiseptic technique when handling fresh Whatman paper.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S6. Pipetting pronase or RGCs onto organotypic retinal explants; related to Step-by-step method details, step 8\nRetinal ganglion cell transplantation and co-culture\nTiming: 2 h for RGC transplantation; 1 week for the culture\nThis section describes the technique of transplanting retinal ganglion cells on organotypic retinal explants, as well as the proper maintenance of the coculture.\nOn the morning after explantation, replace 750 μL of the media in each well (underneath the membrane) with fresh media.\nNote: This should be done several hours before RGC transplantation to allow the culture media to equilibrate inside the incubator.\nDilute donor RGCs to the desired concentration in Retinal Explant Culture Media.",
    "Pipette 3 μL of the cell suspension onto each recipient retina using the technique detailed above in step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 8. We have found that 2 × 104 RGCs per retina works well for downstream quantitative applications.\nPlace the culture plates back in the incubator.\nNote: Optimize the total number of donor cells transplanted based on individual donor source and cell survival. Limit the transplant volume to 3 μL, as larger volumes may result in the cell suspension rolling off the retinal tissue, giving inaccurate survival counts and enabling RGCs to access the subretinal space.\nNote: When deriving donor RGCs through differentiation of pluripotent cells, we recommend using the lowest passage numbers possible. We typically differentiate RGCs from stem cells that have been passaged fewer than 10–15 times.\nExchange retinal explant culture media every other day after RGC transplantation. Media is exchanged by replacing half of the volume (750 μL) in each well with fresh culture media.\nUsing the cells from the same preparation as step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 13, separately culture 8 × 103 RGCs in 150 μL of Retinal Explant Culture Media per well in the precoated 96-well plate from the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section. Place the culture plate back in the incubator.\nAllow the cells to settle onto the plate overnight (12 h).\nOn the following day, obtain microscopy images of the cell culture focusing on endogenous tdTomato expression using an epifluorescent microscope. Alternatively, cells can be quantified using a vital dye such as Calcein. Count the number of cells in each well to calculate survival rate.\nImage the cell culture daily to examine RGC viability longitudinally.\nRetinal tissue immunofluorescent staining\nTiming: 4–7 days for immunohistochemistry\nThis section describes the process of tissue fixation and immunohistochemistry of the cultured explants.",
    "Fix the retinal explants directly in the culture inserts by transferring inserts to new 6-well plates containing 3 mL per well of 4% cold PFA and adding 5 mL of 4% cold PFA directly into the culture insert.\nNote: Add PFA to the culture insert slowly to avoid detaching the retinal explants. Maintain at 4°C for 1 h.\nWash the explants by removing the PFA and replacing with 5 mL of PBS per well, and then remove the PBS. Fixed retinal explants can be stored in PBS at 4°C for 1–2 weeks prior to downstream histologic applications.\nRemove PBS from the culture inserts and cut the explants attached to the underlying membrane out of the culture insert by creating a circumferential incision in the membrane around the retinal tissue using a crescent blade.\nNote: This step is best performed under a dissecting microscope. Take care to leave a margin on the membrane such that the membrane containing the explant can be picked up with forceps and transferred without touching the retina.\nFor flatmount immunofluorescence and microscopy, transfer the retinas attached to the culture membrane into a prelabeled plate and submerge in PBS.\nImmunofluorescent staining can be performed in 48-well plate, which minimizes the amount of antibody required.\nAlternatively, retinal explants at this step can be transferred to OCT and frozen for cryosectioning per standard protocols.\nTo label donor RGCs, perform wholemount immunofluorescent staining for RFP.\nWash the retinas with PBS for 10 min while rocking at 80 revolutions per minute.\nBlock and permeabilize the tissues with 500 μL of blocking buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (20°C) while rocking.",
    "Remove blocking buffer and immerse the retinas in 500 μL of primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 2–5 days at 4°C while rocking. The length of primary antibody incubation should be titrated for specific antibodies.\nWash the retinas in PBS for 15 min while rocking; repeat 3 times.\nIncubate the retinas in 500 μL of secondary antibodies in diluted blocking buffer overnight (12 h) at 4°C while rocking.\nWash the retinas in PBS for 15 min while rocking; repeat 3 times.\nCounterstain the nuclei with DAPI in PBS for 15 min.\nWash the retinas with PBS for 15 min.\nMount the retinas on the membranes onto glass slides.\nAdd mounting medium (Dako, Denmark) and coverslip over the retinas. Keep the slides in the dark to dry until imaging. When dry, store in the dark at 4°C prior to imaging.\nPerform low magnification wholemount confocal tiled imaging on each retina. See detailed procedure on confocal microscopy.\nPerform high resolution stacked confocal images for three-dimensional volumetric analysis. See detailed procedure on confocal microscopy.\nPerform computational volumetric and topographic analyses on donor cell survival and integration. See detailed procedure the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section.\nConfocal microscopy\nTiming: 1–3 days\nThis section describes the methods for capturing images on a Zeiss 880 confocal microscope. Other microscope models may have different settings.\nWholemount tiled confocal imaging.\nNote: The superficial surface of the mounted retinal tissue is not necessarily parallel to the horizontal plane and tends to be slanted and irregular. Thus, capturing a wholemount retinal surface requires imaging tiled z-stacks.\nUse low magnification objectives (10× or 20×) to survey and scan across the retinal surface.\nManually focus the objective and identify the most superficial area on the entire retina. Set this vertical position as the top of the z-stack.",
    "Manually focus the objective and identify the deepest region of interest on the entire retina. Set this vertical position as the bottom of the z-stack.\nSet the laser power and gain for optimal exposure. We recommend keeping the acquisition settings for master gain and digital gain constant at 650 and 1, respectively, while adjusting the laser power. Using the staining protocol above, a laser power between 1-3 would yield the optimal exposure.\nCenter the microscope view at the optic nerve head and acquire tiled z stacks.\nNote: The tile dimensions sufficient to capture the entire retina are typically 6 × 6 tiles for the 10× objective at 1.0× digital magnification and 11 × 11 tiles for the 20× objective at 1.0× digital magnification. A 512 × 512 pixel dimension for each tile provides sufficient resolution to quantify donor RGC cell bodies and visualize neurites. The z-stack interval can be set to 2.5–3.5 μm, since lower magnification objectives have larger depth of field and depth resolution is not a focus of this imaging modality.\nDetailed analysis of individual neurons demonstrating neurite integration with high-resolution and high-magnification confocal imaging (Zhang et al., 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nIdentify a region or a cell of interest with a 40× or 63× objective.\nSet the top and bottom slices of the z-stack to capture the entire donor RGC from the soma to the deepest neurite branch. The bottom slice should extend through the outer nuclear layer to capture the entire host neural retina for characterization of laminar stratification.\nAcquire fluorescent channels of interest. Our examples include acquisition of at least the tdTomato and DAPI signals.\nNote: Tiling may be required to capture the entire neurite extensions.",
    "Note: Acquire high image resolution images to enhance downstream 3D rendering and analyses. Optimize image quality by increasing line averages and decreasing scanning speed. Pixel dimensions of 2048 × 2048 are preferred."
