    "All devices used herein are FDA approved and the protocol contained herein constitutes the standard of care at our institution. As such, no IRB approval was needed for the detailing of this protocol.\n1. Pre-implantation phase\nCreate an anatamo-electro-clinical (AEC) hypothesis.\n\tNOTE: Creation of the AEC hypothesis relies on the coordination of multiple non-invasive techniques for identifying the potential EZ. A team of experts, including epileptologists, radiologists, and epilepsy surgeons will typically convene a meeting to discuss the clinical data for each patient in order to create the AEC hypothesis, which serves as the initial hypothesis for the patient’s EZ. The details of how this is accomplished is beyond the scope of this article.\nIdentify the best methodology for invasive monitoring depending on the location of the AEC hypothesis. Table 1 lists the different scenarios for which SEEG is preferred over subdural grids (SDG) with or without depth electrodes for invasive monitoring.\nAfter a patient is deemed a candidate for SEEG evaluation, create an implantation strategy.\n\tNOTE: The implantation strategy should adequately cover the area identified as a part of the AEC hypothesis as well as the wider epileptogenic network in general and neighboring areas of eloquent cortex. This monitoring aids the surgeon in defining the borders of the resection.\n\t\nObtain a pre-operative volumetric MRI and CTA.\nTransfer the images in DICOM format to the stereotactic robot’s native planning software and perform imaging fusion (T1+Gadolinium MRI fused with CTA).\n\t\tNOTE: Imaging fusion is performed automatically by the robot’s software. One need only select the studies that need to be fused.\nPlan the trajectory of each individual electrode array within the 3D reconstruction of the MRI-CTA fusion, making sure to maximize sampling from a multitude of areas, including superficial, intermediate, and deep cortical and subcortical areas within the AEC hypothesis.",
    "Define each trajectory by manually selecting the surface entry point and deep target point for each electrode.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Generally, it is best to initially use a working distance of 150 mm from the drilling platform to the deep target point and then adjust the depth to maximally reduce the working distance in order to improve implantation accuracy.\nVerify each implantation trajectory.\n\t\t\nReview each electrode in the 3D MRI-CTA fusion reconstruction individually to make sure that the trajectory does not compromise any vascular structures, adjusting any trajectories as needed.\nReview the overall implantation schema in the 3D MRI reconstruction, assessing for any trajectory collisions.\nVerify that the surface entry points are all at least 1.5 cm apart on the skin surface, as anything closer than this would be prohibitive to implantation later.\n2. Operative technique\nIn the OR, prepare the patient and place them supine while preparing the stereotactic robot for surgery.\n\t\nIntubate under general anesthesia according to the recommendations of the anesthesiologist. Use propofol for sufficient anesthesia and verify by adequate electrophysiological recordings as certified by a clinical epileptologist.\nFix the patient’s head using a three-point fixation head holder.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a standard 4-point Lexell frame. Occasionally one of the front posts will be removed in order to facilitate registration of the robot to the patient, as described later. Therefore, the fixation is referred to as 3-point.\nPosition the robot at the head of the patient, such that the distance between the base of the robotic arm and the midpoint of the cranium is 70 cm. Lock the robot into position and secure the three-point head-holder to the robot.",
    "NOTE: Do not make any more adjustments to the position of the patient or the robot after this time. Any further adjustment after this point will potentially result in implantation inaccuracies.\nUse the semi-automatic laser based facial recognition system to register the preoperative volumetric MRI with the patient, following all prompts given by the robot.\n\t\t\nCalibrate the laser using the set distance calibration tool.\nSelect the preset anatomical facial landmarks manually with the laser. Registration is then completed as the robot automatically scans the facial surface.\nConfirm the accuracy of the registration by correlating additional independent surface landmarks with the registered MRI.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The planned trajectories are then automatically verified by the robot software.\nPrepare and drape the patient in standard sterile fashion.\nDrape the robotic working arm using sterile plastic.\nAttach the drilling platform, with a 2.5 mm working cannula, to the robotic arm.\nImplant the bolts along their designated trajectories.\n\t\nSelect the desired trajectory on the touch screen of the robot.\nStep on the robot pedal to initiate movement of the robotic arm to the correct trajectory. When the correct position is reached, the arm is automatically locked by the robot.\nInsert a 2 mm drill through the working cannula and use it to create a pinhole through the entire thickness of the skull.\nOpen the dura with an insulated dural perforator using monopolar cautery at a low setting.\n\t\tNOTE: Opening the dura can be particularly challenging in small children. Because the dura is not completely adherent to the internal layers of the skull, it is very easy to displace rather than open the dura without noticing.\nScrew guide bolt firmly into each pin hole.\nMeasure the distance from the drilling platform to the guide bolt using a sterile ruler.",
    "NOTE: This is a fixed distance related to the length of the drilling adapter.\n\t\t\nSubtract this measured distance from the value of the distance “platform to target” used in planning the trajectory.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Remember that the recommendation is to always use the standard 150 mm platform to target distance unless a need arises to change this distance. Using this standard will simplify this step in the OR.\nRecord and note the result as it will be used later as the final length of the implanted electrode.\nMeasure and note the final length of the electrode and ensure that it matches the newly calculated length for the bolt. Ensure the electrode and bolt have matching labels to prevent confusion later during electrode implantation.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1 – 2.2.7 for every bolt (i.e., implant all bolts) and mark all electrodes accordingly.\nChange surgical gloves and open a new sterile field.\nImplant all electrodes to the target depth via the implanted bolts.\n\t\nInsert a 2 mm diameter stylet through the guide bolt to the intended depth of the final electrode as calculated after implantation of the bolt previously.\nImmediately insert the electrode through the bolt after removing the stylet and screw the electrode into the bolt for fixation.\nEnsure that the electrode is appropriately labeled.\nRepeat steps 2.4.1 – 2.4.3 for every electrode.\nConnect the electrodes to the clinical electrophysiology hardware.\nWrap the patient’s head using standard head bandaging technique.\nSubscription Required.
