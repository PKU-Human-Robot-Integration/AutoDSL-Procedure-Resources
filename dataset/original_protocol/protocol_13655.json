  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were performed according to the University of Texas Medical Branch's Committee on the Use and Care of the animals. CBir1 TCR Tg mice were provided by Dr. Charles Elson of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. CBir1 TCR Tg mice can be female or male but should be at 8-12 weeks. Rag1-/- mice on the C57BL/6 background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory10. Rag1-/- mice must be gender and age-matched, and either male or female can be used but should be at 8-12 weeks. The entire protocol is summarized in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of the recipient mice\nPrepare Rag1-/- mice on the C57BL/6 background, bred in the same specific pathogen-free animal facility. Calculate the number of mice per group by power analysis11.\n\tNOTE: Rag1-/- mice do not have mature T cells and B cells10.\nMark the mice by ear punch.\nWeigh the mice on the same day of T cell transfer.\n2. Preparation of the reagents and solutions\nNOTE: The reagents used are toxic, or biohazard and their handling need precautions and safety measures.\nPrepare Washing Buffer: add 5 mL of 100x Penicillin-Streptomycin into 500 mL of RPMI 1640 medium. Mix it thoroughly and store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare Tris-NH4Cl Lysis Buffer.\n\t\nPrepare Solution Part A. Dissolve 2.06 g of Tris base in 100 mL of double-distilled water (ddH2O) and adjust the pH value to 7.2 with HCl.\nPrepare Solution Part B. Dissolve 7.47 g of NH4Cl in 800 mL of ddH2O.\nMix A and B thoroughly. Measure the pH and adjust it to 7.2 if not.\nAdjust the total volume to 1000 mL. Autoclave and then store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare the Isolation Buffer.",
    "Add 2.5 g of BSA and 500 µL of EDTA (0.5 M, pH 8.0) into 500 mL of 1x PBS. Mix it thoroughly.\nFilter the solution through a 0.22 µm vacuum-driven disposable bottle top filter (see Table of Materials). Store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare FACS Buffer. Add 1 mL of FBS and 50 µL of EDTA (0.5 M, pH 8.0) into 50 mL of Washing Buffer (prepared in step 2.1). Mix thoroughly and store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare Complete Medium. Add 5 mL of FBS in 45 mL of Washing Buffer. Mix thoroughly and store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare EDTA-PBS Buffer.\n\t\nCalculate the volume of the EDTA-PBS Buffer needed. Volume (mL) = mouse number x 20.\nAdd appropriate volume of FBS, EDTA, and HEPES in the PBS (2% of FBS, 0.5 mM of EDTA, 10 mM of HEPES in PBS) (see Table of Materials).\nMix it thoroughly and pre-warm in a 37 °C water bath.\nPrepare the Digestion Buffer.\n\t\nCalculate the volume of the Digestion Buffer needed. Volume (mL) = mouse number x 10.\nAdd appropriate volume of FBS, Collagenase IV, and DNase I in Washing Buffer (2% of FBS, 0.5 mg/mL of Collagenase IV, and 10 U/mL of DNase I in Washing Buffer) (see Table of Materials).\nMix it thoroughly and pre-warm in a 37 °C water bath.\nPrepare Percoll Solution.\n\t\nPrepare 100% Percoll. Add 5 mL of 10x PBS in 45 mL of original Percoll (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 2% FBS in Washing Buffer. Add 1 mL of FBS in 49 mL of Washing Buffer.\nCaulculate the volume of 40 % Percoll Solution and 75 % Percoll Solution. Volume of 40% Percoll Solution (mL) = mouse number x 4; Volume of 75% Percoll Solution (mL) = mouse number x 2.",
    "NOTE: The reagents/solutions prepared in steps 2.1-2.5 will be used in steps 3-4, and those prepared in steps 2.6-2.8 will be used in step 9. All the reagents/solutions used in step 9 should be freshly prepared. Making 5 % extra Buffer is recommended for all the steps.\n3. Isolation of splenic CBir1 TCR Tg CD4+ T cells\nEuthanize CBir1 TCR Tg mouse/mice by a cervical dislocation with CO2 euthanasia (30%-70% gas-air displacement rate). Wet the mice with 70% ethanol.\nPerform a ~1 cm left abdomen incision, pull the skin away from the abdominal muscle tissue, make a ~3 cm incision in the abdominal muscle tissue, and remove the spleen with sterile scissors and forceps. Place the spleen in a culture dish containing 5 mL of pre-cold Washing Buffer (prepared in step 2.1).\nGrind the spleen with the rough surface of two sterile glass slides. Transfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL centrifuge tube by passing through a 100 µm cell strainer (see Table of Materials). Rinse the glass slides and culture dish with 5 mL of pre-cold Washing Buffer and transfer the Washing Buffer into the tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 350 x g for 8 min at 4 °C.

    "Stain the surface markers with 10 µL of anti-mouse CD4-APC, 10 µL of anti-mouse CD25-Percp/Cy5.5, and 10 µL of anti-mouse CD62L-PE13,14 (see Table of Materials). Mix gently and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.\nWash the cells with 2 mL of pre-cold FACS buffer. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 350 x g for 8 min at 4 °C. Aspirate all the supernatantsusing a 3 mL Transfer Pipette.\nRepeat Step 4.4.\nResuspend the cells to the concentration of 40 x 106/mL in pre-cold FACS buffer.\n\tNOTE: To prevent the sorter from clogging, pass the cells through a 70 µm strainer.\nAdd 0.1 µg/mL of DAPI.\n\tNOTE: DAPI is used for excluding the dead cells.\nPrepare 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing 4 mL of Complete Medium (prepared in step 2.5) for collecting the sorted cells.\nLoad the cells onto the sorter. Sort single viable naϊve CD4+ T cells (DAPI- CD4+ CD25- CD62L+ cells) in purity mode (Nozzle size: 70 µm; Pressure: 70 PSI; Event rate: 8000-12000 events/s; Efficiency: higher than 90%) (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Naϊve CD4+ T cells express high expression of CD62L and lack the activation marker CD2513,14.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 350 x g for 8 min at 4 °C. Aspirate all the supernatants using a 3 mL Transfer Pipette.\nResuspend the cells in 500 µL of 1x PBS.\nCount cells following step 3.6\n\tNOTE: ~5 × 106 cells can be obtained from one donor mouse in this step.\n5.

    "Intravenously transfer 200 µL of the cell suspension into the tail vein of Rag-/- mice using a 1 mL insulin syringe (27 G) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Cells from one donor mouse are enough to transfer to around five recipient mice.\n6. Monitoring clinical signs during colitis progression\nWeigh the mice every week and increase the observation to twice a week once the mice start losing >5% of original weights.\nObserve mice response/move when gently stimulated.\nObserve other clinical abnormalities. i.e., posture and stool consistency.\n7. Colon collection and histopathological scoring\nSacrifice the recipient mice by a cervical dislocation with CO2 at a time point of the weight loss >20% of original weight or 6-weeks post cell transfer. Wet the mice with 70% ethanol.\nPerform a ~1 cm ventral midline skin incision, pull the skin away from the abdominal muscle tissue, make a ~3 cm incision in the abdominal muscle tissue, identify the cecum, and remove the entire colon with sterile scissors and forceps. Wet the colon with pre-cold PBS in a culture dish.\nIncise the colon lengthwise and rinse it with pre-cold PBS. Cut 1/3 of the colon longitudinally.\nPlace the colon strip in a paper towel with the luminal side facing upward.
