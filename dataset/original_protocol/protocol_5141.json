    "Labelling the protein with fluorescent dyeThe instructions for this step are based on using a dye and consumables supplied from NanoTemper. The NanoTemper dyes (namely RED, BLUE, and GREEN) are available with either an NHS-ester group that reacts with primary amines on for example lysines, or a maleimide group that reacts with sulfhydryl groups on e.g., cysteines. Other dyes may also be used, or alternatively proteins that have a fluorescent tag, in which case no further labelling should be required. Note that your dye (or tag) of choice must be compatible with the filters that are installed in the instrument and that the dye, once bound to the protein, should not block any potential binding sites.Note: When labelling one of your proteins with a fluorescent dye, you first need to determine which of the two proteins you want to label. It may be useful to consider that you will only use a very small amount of the labelled protein and that, depending on the KD, you might have to use much more of the unlabelled protein (at least 20x the KD). Our measured binding affinities were in the 20-50 μm range and in order to have a satisfying binding curve the protein concentrations in the capillaries were approximately 20 nM of labelled NrdI, and 1 mM FNR in capillary 1 to 15 nM in capillary 16 with a 1:1 dilution series. We chose to label NrdI since we were testing its binding affinity to three other proteins (FNRs). NrdI was labelled with the RED-NHS dye, as it contains eight lysines and no cysteines. Based on the NrdI crystal structure (Røhr et al., 2010) we do not expect any of the lysines to be in the proximity of the binding site.",
    "Note: We have used buffer A (see Recipes) as our labelling buffer. When using the NHS-based dyes, the protein should not be in a buffer that contains primary amines, as these might compete with the protein in the labelling reaction. Similarly, when using the maleimide-based dyes, the protein cannot be in a buffer that contains sulfhydryl groups. Also, the reducing agents DTT and β-mercaptoethanol should not be used with either dye (TCEP may be used for both dyes). If the protein is dissolved in a buffer that contains any of the above-mentioned reagents, a buffer exchange step is required prior to labelling. NanoTemper provides a labelling buffer in the labelling kit that may be used, as well as a spin column for buffer exchange.Dilute the protein stock to a concentration that is lower than your expected KD using labelling buffer. NrdI was diluted to 25 μM and a final volume of 188 μl.Note: NanoTemper recommends using a protein concentration between 2 and 20 μM and a volume of 100 μl.Dissolve the dye in 100% DMSO (30 μl). Vortex well and ensure that all the dye is dissolved.Dilute the dye with labelling buffer to a concentration that is 2-3x the concentration of your protein. Here, the NT-647 dye was diluted to 75 μM and a final volume of 188 μl.Mix the protein and the dye solution in a 1:1 volume ratio and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Note: This is the suggested reaction condition as described in the NanoTemper labeling kit manual, but varying the dye:protein ratio or the incubation time might increase the labeling yield.In the meantime, wash the gel filtration column that is supplied in the kit.",
    "Pour off the storage solution and equilibrate the column with 3 x 3 ml buffer A using gravity flow.Add the protein/dye mix to the centre of the resin in the column. When the sample has completely entered the column bed, add buffer to adjust the total volume of applied sample to 500 μl (We added 500 - (2 x 188) = 124 μl buffer). Do not collect the flow through.Elute the labelled protein with 600 μl buffer A and collect the flow through in a clean tube.Note: It is also possible to collect smaller fractions (e.g., 4 x 150 μl) and check the fluorescence intensity of each fraction in order to find the fraction that contains the labelled protein. Note that free dye might elute at the end.Perform a capillary scan (cap scan) and check the fluorescence intensity of the labelled protein. Note: The degree of labelling should also be determined (see Notes).Aliquot the protein in 20 μl fractions, flash freeze in liquid N2 and store at -80 °C. The fluorescently labelled NrdI protein was used within 4 months.KD-measurementSpin down protein stocks at 15,000 x g for 5 min.Dilute the fluorescently labelled protein with buffer A to a concentration that gives a fluorescence count between 200 and 1,500 (the detection limits of the instrument). Remember that the protein will be diluted 1:1 in the actual experiment and that you might have to increase the concentration of the labelled protein to remain within the detection limit. The fluorescently labelled NrdI protein was diluted 1:25.Note: You can adjust the counts by either changing the LED-power or the concentration of your fluorescently labelled molecule.",
    "Perform a cap scan to ensure that the concentration is within the detection limits and that the protein is not sticking to the capillary walls (sticking is evidenced by shoulders or double peaks in the cap scan traces instead of a smooth, symmetrical curve) (Figure 1). Note: If the protein is sticking to the capillaries, you may want to try adding detergents or additives such as Tween-20, BSA, or Pluronic F-127, changing the pH or ionic strength of your buffer, changing to a different buffer, or using the premium coated capillaries.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412190406_8737.jpgFigure 1. Cap scan of 1:25 dilution NrdI in standard capillaries at 20% LED-powerNumber 16 microtubes 1-16.Note: The tubes are provided with the capillaries.Pipet 10 μl buffer A in tubes 2-16.Note: Use a 10 μl pipette in steps B5, B6, and B7 to improve accuracy.Pipet 20 μl of the unlabelled protein into tube 1. Remove 10 μl, and add these to tube 2. Mix by pipetting up and down several times. Remove 10 μl and add these to tube 3. Mix well. Continue like this for all the tubes. In tube 16, remove 10 μl and discard the liquid. You should now have 10 μl in all the tubes.Note: The unlabelled protein must also be in the assay buffer to avoid any buffer dilution effects. You may want to use a new pipet tip for each transfer to ensure consistent volumes in the serial dilution.Add 10 μl of the fluorescently labelled protein to all the tubes and mix well. Use a new pipet tip each time.Note: Do not use less than 20 μl total volume of reaction mixture so that sticking and evaporation issues are minimised and pipetting errors are reduced. Incubate the reaction mixtures for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Load the samples into the capillaries and place the capillaries in the sample holder. Note: Be careful not to touch the capillaries in the middle and avoid any bubbles in the middle of the capillary. Put the sample holder in the MST-instrument. Perform a cap scan of all the capillaries and run the MST-experiment. The NrdI-FNR interaction was measured using 20% LED-power and 40% MST-power.Note: The LED-power can be adjusted up to 95%, whereas the MST-power should ideally not be increased to over 40%."
