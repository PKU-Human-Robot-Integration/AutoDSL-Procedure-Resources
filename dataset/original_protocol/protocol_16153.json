    "IMPORTANT NOTE: It is necessary to ensure that the pre-amplification and post-amplification processes (steps 18 to 31) are performed in separate laboratories with dedicated sets of instruments (including separate single-channel and multichannel pipets) maintained in each area or, if this is not possible, at separate workstations with dedicated instruments within the same lab.\nGenomic DNA extraction\n1. Remove culture medium from a growing hPSC culture.\nAim to have no more than ∼2.5 × 106 cells, as using too many cells can overload the columns, resulting in poor DNA yields.\nWe use the same protocol for ESCs and iPSCs. In our work, the previously established hPSC lines Shef6 (Aflatoonian et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-bib-0001]), MIFF1 (Desmarais, Unger, Damjanov, Meuth, & Andrews, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-bib-0007]), and H7 (WA07) (Thomson et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-bib-0024]) were used.\n2. Add 5 ml DMEM/F12 or similar basal medium. Swirl around and then remove medium.\n3. Add 1 ml TrypLE Express and incubate cells for ≤4 min at 37°C.\nThe length of incubation depends on various factors, including cell confluency. After 2.5 min, check your cells under a microscope and gently tap to see if they are coming off the flask surface readily. If not, place them back in the incubator for another 30 s and keep checking them under the microscope and gently tapping the flask. Instead of using TrypLE or other enzymatic methods, cells can be simply scraped off the flask surface using a rubber policeman or similar cell scraping tools.\n4. Add 9 ml DMEM/F12 or similar basal medium to cells and gently pipet up and down a couple of times.\n5. Transfer cell suspension into a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and then pellet cells for 4 min at 270 × g at room temperature.\n6. Carefully remove supernatant, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet.",
    "7. Add 200 µl PBS to cell pellet and flick tube to resuspend the pellet.\n8. Add 200 µl Buffer AL (from the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit) and vortex to mix thoroughly.\nThis protocol describes genomic DNA extraction using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, but alternative commercial kits for genomic DNA extraction may be also suitable.\n9. Add 200 µl ethanol and vortex to mix thoroughly.\n10. Transfer mixture into the DNeasy Mini spin column and then centrifuge 1 min at 6000 × g at room temperature in a microcentrifuge.\n11. Remove DNeasy Mini spin column and discard collection tube, including the flow-through.\n12. Place DNeasy Mini spin column into a fresh collection tube and then add 500 µl Buffer AW2 and spin down 3 min at 20,000 × g at room temperature.\n13. Remove DNeasy Mini spin column and discard collection tube.\n14. Place DNeasy Mini spin column into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n15.

Quantify amount of DNA using Qubit or similar fluorometer.\nDNA samples can be stored ≤2 months at 4°C or ≤2 years at −20°C.\nAmplification of DNA\n18. Preheat hybridization oven to 37°C.\n19. Thaw MA1, MA2, and MSM reagents from the InfiniumTM Cyto-SNP 850K DNA analysis kit and allow them to reach room temperature. Once thawed, mix each solution by inverting it 10 times and briefly spin down.\nWhole-genome amplification of DNA is carried out in the first step of the InfiniumTM Cyto-SNP 850K DNA analysis to amplify the genome. This PCR-based step aims to increase the DNA amount in a relatively unbiased manner.",
    "20. Prepare multi-sample amplification (MSA) plate by pipetting 20 µl MA1 into an 0.8-ml storage plate.\n21. Add 4 µl of DNA sample (diluted to 50 ng/µl) to the MSA plate.\nDNA with a concentration <50 ng/µl should be run neat. DNA with a concentration >300 ng/µl should be diluted 1:4 with molecular-grade water and re-quantified. DNA with a concentration <15 ng/μl should not be used.\n22. Add 4 µl of 0.1 N NaOH to each well containing DNA.\n23. Use an adhesive plate lid to seal MSA plate.\n24. Mix contents of the wells by vortexing the plate at 1600 rpm for 1 min, followed by a brief centrifugation of 10 to 15 s at 280 × g in a microplate centrifuge.\n25. Incubate plate at room temperature for 10 min.\n26. Remove seal from the plate.\nThe seal can be reused as long as it is kept upside down and undisturbed.\n27. Transfer 68 µl MA2 to each well containing DNA sample.\n28. Transfer 75 µl MSM to each well containing DNA sample.\n29. Reseal plate with an adhesive plate lid.\nIf using the original adhesive, ensure that the orientation of the seal is the same as in the original application.\n30. Mix contents of the wells by vortexing the plate at 1600 rpm for 1 min, followed by a pulse centrifugation of 10 to 15 s at 280 × g.\n31.

Once thawed, mix FMS solution by inverting the tube 10 times.",
    "DNA fragmentation is carried out to generate fragments of 200 to 300 bp from the genomic DNA amplified previously. DNA fragments of 200 to 300 bp show better hybridization efficiency compared to unfragmented DNA.\n34. Take out plate from the hybridization oven and briefly spin down for 30 s at 280 × g.\n35. Remove seal from the plate.\nThe seal can be reused as long as it is kept upside down and undisturbed.\n36. Transfer 50 µl FMS into each sample-containing well.\n37. Seal plate using the original seal, placing it in the same orientation as previously applied.\n38. Mix by vortexing plate for 1 min at 1600 rpm, followed by spinning for 5 s at 280 × g.\n39. Place plate on the heat block at 37°C for 1 hr.\nAt this point, the protocol can be paused for up to 24 hr by placing the plate at −20°C. Before use, thaw plate at room temperature. Once thawed, spin down plate for 5 s at 280 × g.\nDNA precipitation\n40. Bring PM1 to room temperature and invert it a few times to mix.\n41. Cool down centrifuge to 4°C.\n42. Transfer 100 µl PM1 to each sample well.\n43. Seal and vortex plate (1600 rpm for 1 min).\n44. Incubate plate on the heat block at 37°C for 5 min.\n45. Pulse-centrifuge for 10 to 15 s at 280 × g.\n46. Add 300 µl of 100% 2-propanol to each well.\n47. Seal plate with a new, dry adhesive plate lid.\n48. Invert plate 10 times to mix the contents of the wells.\n49. Incubate plate at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuge 20 min at 3000 × g, 4°C.",
    "The pellet formed upon centrifugation is prone to dislodging; thus, it is important to continue immediately to the next step.\n50. Remove seal from the plate and quickly invert plate over a sink or paper towels to remove the supernatant.\n51. Remove excess liquid by blotting onto an adsorbent pad or paper towels.\n52. Firmly tap inverted plate to decant the liquid from all wells.\n53. Air-dry pellets by placing the inverted plate on a tube rack. Leave plate at room temperature for 1 hr.\n54. Check that a blue pellet is present in each well containing a sample.\nThe protocol can be paused here. If pausing the protocol, the plate should be sealed and stored in a −20°C freezer for ≤24 hr.\nResuspending the DNA\n55. Preheat heat block to 95°C and hybridization oven to 48°C.\n56. Preheat heat sealer for 10 min.\n57. Transfer 46 µl RA1 to each well containing a DNA pellet and apply foil heat seal to the plate.\n58. Roll heat sealer over the plate.\n59. Place plate in the hybridization oven and incubate it at 48°C for 1 hr.\n60. Vortex at 1800 rpm for 1 min followed by pulse-centrifugation for 10 to 15 s at 280 × g.\n61. Repeat step 60 until pellets are fully resuspended.\nProceed to Basic Protocol 2 or pause by sealing the plate and storing in a −20°C freezer for ≤24 hr or in a −80°C freezer for ≤1 week.",
    "This protocol describes hybridization of the samples (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0001]) on SNP arrays, followed by extension/staining, washing of unhybridized or nonspecifically hybridized DNA, and, finally, scanning.\nFirst, fragmented DNA samples hybridize to the BeadChips containing locus-specific 50-mers. BeadChips are then washed to prepare them for the staining process. The extension step of the protocol entails first washing away unhybridized or nonspecifically hybridized DNA fragments. The hybridized DNA fragments are then used as a template for single-base extension of the oligos on the BeadChips to incorporate fluorescent labels. Stained BeadChips are washed and coated to protect the fluorescent dyes. Finally, the BeadChips are scanned.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0001])\nMSA plate (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0001])\n95% formamide/1 mM EDTA (see recipe)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nHybridization chambers\nHybridization chamber gaskets\nHybridization chamber inserts\nVertical wash vessels\nStaining racks\nTe-Flow flow-through chambers (Tecan, cat. no. 760 800)\nChamber rack\nTest tube rack\nVacuum desiccator\nScanners (e.g., NextSeq550 or iScan System)\nLoading DNA onto BeadChips and hybridization\n1.

Denature DNA by incubating the plate at 95°C for 20 min.\n4. While the plate is incubating, assemble hybridization chamber by placing the hybridization chamber gasket into the hybridization chamber.\n5. Dispense 200 µl PB2 into top and bottom humidifying reservoir of the hybridization chamber and then place lid on the hybridization chamber to prevent evaporation.\nA closed hybridization chamber can be left closed at room temperature for up to 1 hr.",
    "6. When the 20-min incubation of the plate is over, remove plate from the heat block and let it cool down by leaving it at room temperature for 30 min. Pulse-centrifuge for 10 to 15 s at 280 × g.\n7. Unpack BeadChips and then place them into a hybridization chamber insert, with the barcode ends aligning.\n8. Remove seal from the plate and pipet 26 µl sample from plate onto the appropriate section of the BeadChip.\n9. Allow DNA to disperse over the whole surface.\n10. Inspect BeadChip for bubbles or areas not coated in liquid. If bubbles are present, try to remove them by gently agitating insert. If some areas are not coated in liquid, add leftover sample from MSA plate.\n11. Place inserts into the hybridization chamber, taking care that the barcode of the chip is positioned over the barcode on the hybridization chamber.\n12. Close lid of the chamber and secure it with four clasps.\n13. Place hybridization chamber in the hybridization oven and incubate at 48°C for 16 to 24 hr.\nWashing BeadChips\n14. Prepare a vertical wash vessel and fill it with 310 ml PB1.\n15. Insert a staining rack into the vertical wash vessel.\n16. Remove hybridization chambers from the hybridization oven and allow to cool for 25 min.\n17. Take BeadChips out of the hybridization chambers and remove seal. Quickly place them into staining rack in PB1, taking care that the BeadChips do not dry out.\n18. Wash BeadChips thoroughly by lifting the staining rack up and down 10 times and then soaking the. BeadChips in PB1 for a further 5 min.\n19. Repeat step 18 in a second, clean staining rack in PB1.\n20. Assemble TE-Flow flow-through chambers and leave them in PB1 until ready to load into chamber rack.",
    "Continue to extend and stain the BeadChips.\nExtending and staining BeadChips\n21. Pre-heat chamber rack to 44°C and then place each TE-Flow flow-through chamber assembly on chamber rack.\n22. Add 150 µl RA1 to flow-through chamber reservoir and incubate for 30 s. Repeat 5 times.\n23. Add 450 µl blocking buffer (XC1) to flow-through assembly. Incubate for 10 min.\n24.

    "39. Wash BeadChips thoroughly by lifting the staining rack up and down 10 times and then soaking BeadChips in PB1 for a further 5 min.\n40. While the BeadChips are soaking, prepare another vertical wash vessel and fill it with 310 ml XC4, taking care that the XC4 is used within 10 min.\n41. Move staining rack with the BeadChips from the PB1-filled wash vessel to the XC4-filled wash vessel.\n42. Wash BeadChips thoroughly by lifting the staining rack up and down 10 times and then soaking BeadChips in XC4 for a further 5 min.\n43. Remove staining rack from the wash vessel and place it on a test tube rack in the horizontal position.\nTry to do this movement in a smooth and uninterrupted manner. Ensure that the BeadChips and their barcodes are facing upward.\n44. Transfer test tube rack with the horizontally- placed BeadChips into a vacuum desiccator.\n45.

Scan BeadChips using a scanner.\nLaser light within the scanner excites the fluorophore of the incorporated single base on the BeadChips. The output files, typically in genotype call (GTC) file format, are used in BlueFuse Multi software to perform the analysis (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0003]).",
    "SNP array analysis is carried out to examine the presence of gains or losses of genetic material in samples of interest from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0002]. Our analysis is based on BlueFuse Multi v4.4 (BlueGnome) software. Analysis of each sample starts with the genome view, giving an overall view of the whole genome of each sample. This is used to assess the level of noise within the data and perform quality-control (QC) checks. For samples that pass QC checks, the analysis view is used to visualize the calls assigned by the software, using the karyotype chart and the CGH table. The karyotype view presents an ideogram with losses represented by red bars and gains by green bars, alongside the chromosomal region in which they arise. The CGH table lists the CNVs and gives details of the size and the chromosomal coordinates of its location.\nMaterials\nBlueFuse Multi (BlueGnome) software\n1. Use BlueFuse Multi (BlueGnome) software to analyze sample data from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0002].\nThis software uses the GRCh37 genome build.\n2. Use SNP report to check the QC metrics for the run, e.g., using the following metrics to check whether they fall within the acceptable range:\n         \na. SD autosome/Robust: measures amount of variation from the average. This parameter should be in the range of 0.05 to 0.11.\nb. DLR = derivative log ratio: measure of consistency or noise. This parameter should have a value of <0.2. Samples with a high DLR tend to have poor properties.\nc. Median LogR deviation: measures variation in the log ratio between adjacent SNPs. <0.30 = pass, <0.20 to call CNVs.\nd. Median call rate: median of the bin call rates. The value of this parameter should be >0.98.",
    "Samples that do not pass QC should not be analyzed. To improve quality, try running a higher concentration of DNA or re-extracting DNA from a fresh sample. DNA quality should be checked prior to analysis using, for example, a Qubit fluorometer.\n3. Use analysis view to check calls in karyotype view using the karyotype chart (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0001]) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) table (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7505821a-1c72-4c1a-9233-d31103166470/cpz1606-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSNP array analysis is carried out using BlueFuse.

Zoom into regions with potential CNVs for a closer look.\n5. Analyze each call identified by software in turn by clicking on the call region on the CGH table and inspecting the LogR ratio track (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0002]) and BAF chart (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b63794cb-ab9b-4c1b-9b73-a54999ff87c4/cpz1606-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nZoomed-in view of (A) LogR ratio and (B) BAF tracks of a gain on chromosome 1 from a CGH table.\n6.

Zoom in to highlighted region. Count number of SNPs. Note that 7 SNPs are required for a real call.\n7. Check for normal variation.\nCommon SNPs are identified as those that are seen at a high frequency (>1.0%) among reference databases. These can be ignored.",
    "8. Assess any calls using inbuilt decision tracks. Obtain information about genes present in the regions gained or lost using the UCSC genome browser (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0003]).\nTo compare the resolution of SNP arrays to that of conventional G-banding, we processed DNA samples for SNP arrays from two hPSC lines that had previously been tested for genetic abnormalities by G-banding karyotyping. A detailed protocol for G-banding is provided in the Current Protocols article Laing, Halliwell, & Barbaric (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-bib-0016]).\nShef6 is an hESC line (Aflatoonian et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-bib-0001]) that appeared diploid by karyotyping when 20 metaphases were analyzed (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0004]). However, SNP array analysis using BlueFuse Multi produced 28 calls. Manual inspection of the calls revealed no relevant genes in any of the regions, except the gain identified at 20q11.21 (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0004] and 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0004]), a recurrent gain in hPSCs, containing BCL2L1 (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0004]).\nMIFF-1 cl.33 is a subline of human iPSC line MIFF-1 (Desmarais et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-bib-0007]).

    "When using a method for detection of genetic changes, it is critical to know the sensitivity of the method, i.e., the ability to detect genetic changes when they are present at a low level of mosaicism in culture. The Support Protocol details the assessment of SNP array sensitivity for detection of mosaicism in hPSC cultures. Preparing mosaic samples with defined percentages of variant cells requires extraction of genomic DNA from pure populations of wild-type and variant cells and then mixing these populations to obtain increasing percentages of variant cells.\nMaterials\nSee Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0001] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0003].\nPreparing mosaic samples with defined percentages of variant hPSCs\n1. Extract genomic DNA from a culture that is 100% diploid and 100% variant (e.g., as determined on parallel cultures by G-banding or another suitable whole-genome method), processing samples for genomic DNA extraction using the protocol outlined in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0001].\nIt is important to use cells that have been verified as wild-type or variant, ideally at the same passage number or as close as possible to the passage number at which they were verified. This minimizes the possibility that 100% wild-type and variant samples are mosaic themselves.\n2. Mix genomic DNA of wild-type and variant cells to obtain the following percentages of variant cells in the mosaic sample: 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%.\n3. Process samples for SNP arrays using the protocols outlined in Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0002].\nData analysis for mosaic samples\n4. Using Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-prot-0003], analyze 100% variant and 100% wild-type diploid samples first to give a baseline of any common SNPs that are markers of each cell line (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0006] to 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0006]).",
    "When analyzing known mosaic samples, note that it is difficult for the software to call mosaic changes, and these can often be called as multiple smaller regions of losses or gains. Thus, visual inspection of each chromosome is typically required to determine the presence of mosaic regions. Mosaic gains are identified by elevations of the LogR ratio and splitting of the BAF chart. In our triplicate samples, mosaicism of 1q gain could be clearly seen when variants were present at 20% of cells in a sample (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0007] to 7C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0007]), but manual inspection could detect mosaicism at 10% (Fig. 8A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0008] to 8D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0008]). This assay could not detect mosaicism at 5% or 1% (Fig. 9A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0009] and 9B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0009]). Similarly, analysis of a mosaic sample harboring multiple abnormalities, including trisomy 12, gain of 17q, and gain of 20q (Fig. 10A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0010] to 10D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0010]), could detect mosaicism when variant cells were present at 20% mosaicism (Fig. 11A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0011] to 11C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0011]), with some alterations also seen upon manual inspection of samples with 10% mosaicism (Fig. 12A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0012] to 12C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.606#cpz1606-fig-0012]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a559cbf-d57f-4764-ae03-3f0297e53f78/cpz1606-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nSNP array analysis of a pure population of variant hPSCs harboring a gain of chromosome 1q.
