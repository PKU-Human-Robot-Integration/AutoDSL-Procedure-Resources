    "1. Setting up gP2S for work\nLog on to gP2S. Upon successful login, the main screen is shown.\n\tNOTE: In the top right corner, the user name is shown - click on this to log out. The left-hand-side navigation bar consists of a project selector (top), a set of navigation items listing the experimental entity types that define the cryoEM workflow (Samples, Grids, Microscopy Sessions, Processing Sessions, Maps, and Models), and a link to the Settings section of the application.\nBefore any experiments can be logged, populate the Settings section with information about the Projects, Equipment, Consumables, Software and Protocols that are in use at the cryoEM facility. Settings can be updated at any time by adding new tools and projects and by editing the existing entries; however, just like all entities in gP2S, Settings entities cannot be deleted once they are created.\n2. Configure at least one project\nNavigate to Settings > Projects.\nClick on Create New Project.\nType in a Project label.\nClick Save.\n3. Configure at least one Surface Treatment Machine.\nNOTE: Surface treatment machines are used to modify the surface properties of EM grids - most commonly they are glow dischargers or plasma cleaners.\nFrom the Equipment section, choose Surface Treatment Machine.\nClick Create New Machine.\nEnter a label, which will serve to identify the machine later on.\nProvide its Manufacturer, Model and Location.\nClick Save.\n4. Register at least one Grid Type.\nNOTE: Grid Types are meant to identify models of grids (e.g., \"2-µm holey carbon film on 300-mesh copper grids\"), not specific batches or lots of grids\nFrom the Consumables section select Grid Type.\nClick on Create New Grid Type.\nEnter a Grid Type label, Manufacturer and Description.\nClick Save.\n5. Register at least one Vitrification Machine\nFrom the Equipment section, select Vitrification Machine.",
    "Click on Create New Machine.\nProvide its Manufacturer, Model and Location.\nClick Save.\n6. Register at least one Blotting Paper\nFrom the Consumables section select Blotting Paper.\nClick on Create New Blotting Paper.\nType in a Blotting Paper label, Manufacturer and Model.\nClick Save.\n7. Register at least one Cryo Storage Device\nFrom the Equipment section, select Cryo Storage Device.\nClick on Create New Storage Device.\nEnter the device's Manufacturer, Model and Location.\nSet the toggle switches to specify whether the added storage device features cylinders, tubes and/or boxes.\n\t​NOTE: If it does, gP2S will let users specify relevant cylinder, tube and/or box identifiers later on when users log the storage locations for individual grids. With the above pieces of Equipment and Consumables set up, it is possible to create three types of Protocols - Surface Treatment, Negative Stain and Vitrification.\n8. Register at least one Surface Treatment Protocol\nFrom the Protocols section, select Surface Treatment.\nClick on Create New Protocol.\nEnter a label to identify the Protocol.\nSelect one of the Surface Treatment Machines.\nSpecify settings used during this protocol: duration, current and polarity of the discharge, and pressure as well as any additives in the atmosphere.\nClick Save.\n9. Create at least one negative stain protocol\nFrom the Protocols section, select Negative Stain.\nClick on Create New Protocol.\nEnter a protocol label.\nDescribe the stain by giving values for its Name, the pH, and concentration of heavy metal salt.\nSpecify the incubation time of stain before blotting.\nEnter free-text description of the protocol.\nClick Save.\n10. Register at least one grid-freezing protocol\nFrom the Protocols section, select Vitrification.\nClick on Create New Protocol.\nEnter a protocol label.\nChoose the relevant Vitrification Machine from the drop-down list.\nChoose the Blotting Paper used in this protocol.",
    "Then, provide the remaining experimental information: relative humidity, temperature, blot force, number of blots, blot time, wait time, drain time, number of sample applications.\nEnter a free-text description.\nClick Save.\n\t​NOTE: After configuring the Protocols, it is possible to create both cryo and negative-stain grids. To use gP2S to record the next steps in the workflow, starting from Microscopy sessions, it is necessary to configure a Microscope, an Electron Detector and a Sample Holder.\n11. Register at least one microscope\nFrom the Equipment section, select Microscope.\nClick Create New Microscope.\nType in a Microscope label.\nProvide its Manufacturer, Model and Location.\nSelect which acceleration voltages are configured and usable on this microscope, out of the preset list of 80, 120, 200 and 300 kV.\nSpecify the list of condenser (\"C2\") and objective apertures installed. NOTE: for each type, up to 4 aperture slots can be configured, one of which is designated as the default aperture for this microscope. In the case of the objective apertures, indicate that one or more of the slots are taken up by a phase plate, in which case the diameter parameter is disabled.\nIndicate whether this microscope is equipped with an autoloader or requires a side-entry holder.\nIndicate whether the microscope is fitted with an energy filter.\nProvide default values for extraction voltage, gun lens setting, spot size, and energy filter slit width (if relevant). The provided values will be used when users create Microscopy Sessions.\n12. Register at least one electron detector\nFrom the Equipment section, select Electron Detector.\nClick on Create New Electron Detector.\nEnter a label, manufacturer and model.\nSelect from a drop-down list the Microscope onto which this detector is mounted.\nAdd at least one magnification calibrated for this microscope-detector combination:\n\t\nUnder magnifications, select Add New.",
    "Provide both nominal and calibrated magnification values.\nRepeat these steps for all magnification settings expected. These magnification settings will later be available in a drop-down selector for users logging Microscopy Sessions.\nUse checkboxes to specify whether the detector is capable of electron counting, dose fractionation, and super resolution.\nFinally, provide additional specifications of the detector: counts-per-electrons factor (the average number of counts registered by incident electron), the linear dimension of each pixel (in µm), and the numbers of rows and columns of pixels.\nClick Save\n13. If there are one or more microscopes that require side-entry sample holders, register available sample holders in gP2S.\nFrom the Equipment section, select Sample Holder.\nClick on Create New Holder.\nEnter a label, manufacturer, model and location.\nSpecify the maximum tilt (in degrees) for the sample holder.\nUse the checkboxes to specify whether it is capable of holding cryogenic EM grids, and whether it is capable of dual-axis tilting.\nFrom a drop-down list, select all microscopes with which this holder can be used.\n\tNOTE: this will ensure that only relevant holders are listed when users register Microscopy Sessions using side-entry microscopes.\nClick Save.\n14. Specify the pattern that gP2S will follow in setting the directory name associated with each Microcopy Session.\nNOTE: It can be very useful to have gP2S automatically generate a directory name for the storage of image data recorded during a Microscopy Session. This ensures systematic, information-rich naming of storage directories. Specify the pattern that gP2S will follow in setting the directory name associated with each Microscopy Session.\nFrom the Admin section, select Settings.\nEdit the directory name pattern string.",
    "​NOTE: this string may contain the following variables: project label, Grid ID, Grid label, Microscopy Session label, Microscopy Session ID, Microscopy Session start date, Microscopy Session start time, and Microscope label, delimited by ${}. Other than these variables, directory name patterns may contain most characters. The default directory name pattern, for example, is ${GridLabel}_${MicroscopyStartDate}_${ProjectLabel}_${MicroscopeLabel}_grid_${GridID}_session_${MicroscopySessionID}. Now, sufficient Settings are configured to enable the registration of experimental entities up to and including Microscopy Sessions.\n15. Register image processing software available to the users.\nNOTE: This will enable the registration of Processing Sessions and later entity types (Maps and Models).\nSelect Image Processing.\nClick on Create New Image Processing Software.\nType in the name of the software\nList all versions available to users:\n\t\nUnder software version(s), select Add New.\nEnter the software version.\n\t\tNOTE: This will enable users to specify exactly which version of the software they used to reach their results when registering Image Processing Sessions. This completes the necessary configuration of gP2S. Users should now be able to accurately capture key metadata describing their electron microscopy experiments, as described in the following section."
