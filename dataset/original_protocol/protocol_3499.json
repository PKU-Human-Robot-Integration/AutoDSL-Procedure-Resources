    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of the cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step is critical for proper tumor seeding and tumor growth. A final quality check on the cells to be implanted should also be performed at this point before proceeding to surgery.\nCollect all cells from one of the culture dishes you prepared the day before.\nSpin down cells at 1,500 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nNote: An accutase step might be required at this point in some cell lines (see preparation step 7b).\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of cell culture medium.\nPipette up and down to homogenize the cells into a single-cell suspension.\nCount cells (see also preparation step 7e).\nSpin down the appropriate volume of cell suspension containing the required number of cells at 1,500 × g for 5 min.\nNote: The cell number is determined based on the number of mice to be implanted in the next 3 h (e.g., 10 mice) and the number of tumor cells to be implanted per mouse (e.g., 50,000 cells/mouse). We recommend preparing 1.5 times this amount per aliquot (see also preparation step 10).\nResuspend the cells in the appropriate volume of cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) needed to achieve the desired concentration.\nWe typically inject 2 μL of cell suspension in the brain of mice.\nNote: Injecting a high volume of cell suspension is not recommended as this would result in reflux and increase the chance of having an extracranial growth.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a small tube.\nPrepare additional resources.\nPrepare a small tube of ethanol (70%) to rinse the needle in between implantations.\nPrepare a small tube of 1× PBS to rinse the needle in between implantations.",
    "Note: The cells should not be kept on ice for an extended period of time (typically no longer than 3 h). It is recommended that you prepare fresh aliquots of cells every 3 h to ensure that the viability of the injected cells is not compromised. For each new aliquot, one of the plates prepared the day before can be used (this also facilitates counting as the concentration of the cell suspension should be similar).\nStereotactic implantation\nTiming: 30 min per mouse, overlap possible\nIn this step, the actual implantation takes place. The implantation must take place under sterile conditions and must adhere to guidelines outlined in a protocol approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nAnesthesia and preparations\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane.\nTurn on the heating pad.\nOnce the mice are deeply anesthetized, place and fix the animal under the small animal stereotaxic frame. Note that this surgical set up has to be connected to an isoflurane chamber and the animal has to remain under anesthesia for the duration of the surgery.\nAdminister analgesics.\nIncision and localization of the injection site.\nDisinfect the skin.\nIncise the skin of the head with a scalpel over a length of 0.5–1 cm along the midline.\nClean incision site with a sterile cotton tip.\nIdentify the bregma.\nPoint the needle tip to the bregma, then set x, y, and z coordinates to zero.\nNavigate to +0.5 anterior-posterior, +2.0 medio-lateral. Mark with a sterile pen.\nInjection\nTake the needle out of the stereotactic frame.\nFill the needle with 2 μL of cell suspension.\nFirst, rinse the needle with ethanol and PBS.\nMake sure to mix the cell suspension before taking out the cells by gently tapping the tube with your finger.\nAvoid having air bubbles in the syringe.",
    "Find the previously marked location on the skull and use a drill with a 0.45 mm burr drill bit (Stoelting) to pierce through the bone. Make sure not to exert too much pressure, in order to minimize the risk of causing brain injury once the drill head has penetrated the bone.\nReinsert the needle and navigate to −2.5 mm depth (dorso-ventral).\nReinserting the syringe into the stereotactic frame might lead to a small drop of the cell suspension on the tip of the needle. Make sure to remove this to minimize the risk of tumor seeding and growth along the injection route.\nStart the injection with 0.2 μL/min using a micropump installed into the stereotactic frame. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: clogging of the needle.\nRemoval of the needle\nVisually confirm that all the cell suspension volume has been injected.\nAfter 60 s, start retracting the needle 0.3 mm every 30 s. This is important to prevent any reflux of the cells toward the skull.\nClosing the wound\nSeal the bone with bone wax.\nClose the wound with surgical glue, stiches, or clamps.\nPost procedure\nAdminister analgesics.\nPlace the mouse on a heat pad for recovery while closely monitoring for any signs of distress or difficulty breathing. Return the animal to its cage once it has recovered for anesthesia.\nImaging: monitoring of tumor growth by imaging Fluc bioluminescence activity\nTiming: 20 min per cage, overlap possible\nThis step of the protocol enables the monitoring of tumor initiation and growth. The speed at which the cells engraft and grow in the mouse model varies considerably between different cell lines. Detectable tumors can develop within days or can take up to several weeks.",
    "Tumor growth can be monitored by imaging Fluc bioluminescence activity using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera such as the Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System (PerkinElmer), after intraperitoneal injections of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg body weight). The Fluc signal, which is, in this case, a surrogate marker for tumor volume is quantitated using the Living Image software 4.3.1 (PerkinElmer).\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane.\nInjection of D-luciferin\nInject D-luciferin solution (reconstituted at 25 mg/mL in sterile PBS, administer 150 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally.\nWait 5–10 min to ensure proper biodistribution of the injected substrate into the animal. Acquire images (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nQuantify the signal intensity with an appropriate software.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: no signal\nNote: For detailed information on bioluminescence imaging in mice, its limitations, and potential troubleshooting steps, see Badr (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nNote: The intensity of the bioluminescence signal can vary depending on the number of cells implanted as well as the transduction efficiency of the cells. Note that it is possible to perform cell sorting based on mCherry expression in order to achieve a pure population of luciferase-mCherry positive cells. We recommend starting the treatment once the bioluminescence signal from the brain tumor is at least 1.5-fold higher as compared to the background signal.\nDrug delivery: intranasal delivery of experimental compounds\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step, to overcome obstacles by various barriers of the CNS blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood–cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers, the molecule of choice is delivered via nose-to-brain route by intranasal (IN) administration. The IN route of administration provides a non-invasive method for delivering therapeutics directly to the CNS. Several therapeutic compounds or biological agents such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, nanoparticles, viral vectors, and stem cells can be delivered via the IN route (Dhuria et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Oberoi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Bruinsmann et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "This alternative drug delivery method has also other advantages over systemic administration such as an increased targeting to the brain and a reduced systemic toxicity.\nPrepare the compounds for administration to the desired concentration. Make sure that the final volume does not exceed 10 μL for each nostril.\nDissolving the drug in a 20% solution of (2-hydroxypropyl)- β-cyclodextrin can improve drug solubility, thus enhancing brain uptake after IN administration.\nDrug administration\nAnesthetize mice with inhaled isoflurane.\nConfirm that the animal is deeply anesthetized by applying a firm toe pinch.\nHold the anesthetized mouse with a skin grip while immobilizing the head and forelimbs (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/419-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Proper handling of the mouse prior to IN injection\nThis picture shows how to hold the mouse in a half-sitting position with one hand.\nPosition the head-back in supine position with a 70°–90° tilt to maximize drug absorption from the nasal cavity and uptake into the brain, and to minimize drainage into the trachea and esophagus (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/419-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Administering the drug\nThis picture depicts the correct positioning of the pipette tip in order to administer the drug via the IN route. Make sure not to insert the pipette tip into the nostril or allow the pipette tip to touch the nostrils.\nUsing a pipette (P20), administer a small drop onto one nostril over a period of 30–60 s, thus allowing the drop to be snorted into the nasal cavity (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Check if normal breathing is restored before proceeding to the next step.\nRepeat the previous step onto the contralateral nostril.\nRepeat all the steps, alternating the nostrils until the 10 μL dose/nostril is completed.",
    "Allow the mice to recover and regain consciousness over a heated pad before returning them back to their cages. The entire procedure takes ∼30 min to be completed.\nCritical: Do not allow the pipette tip to touch the nostrils (Dhuria et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Mouse are obligatory nose breathers (Kling, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Grimaud and Murthy, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]); inserting the pipette to administer the medication can cause unnecessary animal distress. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Difficulty breathing or liquid leaking out of the nose immediately after injection\nCritical: Timing can be critical for the IN delivery. When a relatively high volume of liquid is injected too quickly, the result may be a difficulty in breathing (Dhuria et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (which might cause the mice to wake up earlier; Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Mouse waking up during IN injection) or liquid leaking out of the nose immediately after injection. You should allow sufficient time for the mouse to sniff one drop at a time, before administering the next (Dhuria et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). On the other hand, if IN delivery is performed over an extended period of time, the anesthesia will wear off, and the mouse will wake up. Therefore, make sure the animal is deeply anesthetized prior to starting the IN administration of the drug. The aforementioned timeframe should serve as a reference point and can be adjusted according to individual experimental requirements. The maximum absorbance capacity of a mouse’s nasal cavity is 0.032 cm3 (Dhuria et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]); working in a range of 10–30 μL volumes decreases the chances of lethal nostril occlusion.\nFor further reading on IN delivery techniques we refer to Dhuria et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Lochhead and Thorne, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Ullah et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12].\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Poor drug delivery to the brain"
