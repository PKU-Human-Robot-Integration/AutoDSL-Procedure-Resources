    "This protocol was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office.\nInstructions were written specific to commercially available devices and their related software for data collection (see Table of Materials).\n1. Set up of the sleep monitoring devices prior to the participant visit\nConnect a fully charged actigraphy device to the docking station and open the actigraphy software. Initialize actigraphy device to record for the desired timeframe14. Use the following parameters.\n\t\nSelect the 30 second epoch length from the drop-down menu for epoch duration. This allows for comparison to 30 second epochs on the single-channel EEG and HST recordings.\nSelect activity and light logging mode from the drop-down menu for logging mode. The light logging mode allows measurement of light exposure at night.\nCollect actigraphy data for the duration of HST and single-channel EEG device recordings. Measure actigraphy for approximately one week for this protocol.\nConnect a charged, single-channel EEG device to computer. Open device software and select data management and edit patient data prior to the start of the recording15.\nFor home sleep testing, insert batteries and data card into the HST device. Connect HST device to computer and power the device on.\n\t\nOpen device software and select Device Configuration from the menu. Choose the appropriate study montage10.\nSelect Auto Start. Enter times for auto start and stop beginning 2 hours prior to and ending 2 hours after the participant's habitual bedtime to ensure the entire sleep period is recorded.\nChoose the option to automatically record for 2 consecutive nights. Click on the good study indicator tab and choose 6 hours.\nUse a Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) adapter kit in place of the thermistor and pressure transducer to monitor airflow if the participant wears PAP.\n2. Participant visit for instruction on wearing the sleep monitoring devices",
    "Instruct participant to wear the actigraphy device on the non-dominant wrist for the duration of the study with the exception of bathing or swimming.\n\t\nAsk the participant to press the event button at the bedtime and wake time to set a lights-out and lights-on marker on the actogram.\nComplete the sleep log every morning upon awakening. Instruct the participant to document the following:\n\t\tBedtime and wake-up time;\n\t\tHow long it took to fall asleep;\n\t\tNumber of nighttime awakenings;\n\t\tOccurrence of unusual events that may impact sleep.\nPlace the device on the participant's wrist during the visit and provide detailed written instructions to the participant.\nInstruct the participant regarding the Home Sleep Test Device (HST) and review the education manual.\n\tNOTE: Following the educational session, participants were given the opportunity to independently apply the device using the manual and then receive verbal feedback from a study team member.\n\t\nPosition the blue belt with the holster around the chest directly under armpits with the buckle almost centered.\n\t\t\nCenter holster on the chest and tighten the belt until it is snug enough so that the holster will stay in the center of chest when moving during the night. Point the arrow on the belt buckle facing down.\nPlace the black lanyard strap around the neck and tighten until it is comfortably snug. Place the other blue belt around the waist and tighten the belt until it is snug enough that it does not slide when moving during the night. Point the arrow on the belt buckle facing down.\nSnap the white box into the holster on the chest belt. Ensure that there are 2 clicks as the box goes into the holster. Orient the label of the HST device outward.",
    "Open the device by sliding the button at the top of the device. Refrain from pressing the power button since the device is set to auto start and stop. Look at the device window.\n\t\tNOTE: All the sensors will stop flashing when they are either plugged into the device or placed on the body.\nInstruct participant that the line connected to the mouth (purple rectangle) will flash the entire time if used with PAP.\nPlug the chest (thoracic) wires into the ports on the bottom of the chest belt buckle. Repeat this step and plug abdominal wires into the ports on the bottom of the abdominal belt buckle.\nIf PAP is worn, skip steps the following sub-steps.\n\t\t\nPlace the prongs of the white wire (thermistor) in the nose and wrap the wire around ears. Pull the plastic piece up toward the neck to secure.\nPosition the second set of prongs (clear nasal cannula) in nostrils and wrap tubing around ears. Ensure that the two prongs from the cannula fit just inside the nose and position the longer prong in front of the mouth, trim to fit area by mouth opening.\nSlide up the plastic piece toward the neck to secure. Use a small piece of tape to affix both sets of tubing to each cheek.\nRun the long red and white leg wires through each pant leg along the side to avoid them getting tangled during the night. Use sticky patches to attach a red and white wire to each leg.\nPlace a hand on the shin and flex one foot up and down to locate the anterior tibialis muscle on the outside (lateral front) of the lower leg and place patches directly on the muscle at least 2 finger widths apart from one another.",
    "Apply tape over each sticky patch sufficient to cover patch, wire, and skin to secure. With knee bent (to give plenty of slack in the wires), tape the wire above each knee to prevent the wires from getting tangled.\nUse an oximeter to measure oxygen levels throughout the night.\n\t\t\nPinch the top of the oximeter to open the clip. Match up the picture of a fingernail on the outside of the clip to the fingernail of middle or index finger and place the oximeter on index or middle finger.\nWrap tape around the outside of the oximeter clip to secure. Place a piece of tape over the oximeter wire to attach it to hand just above the wrist. Tuck the extra oximeter cable in the chest belt to avoid getting tangled in the wire.\nLook at the man on the display screen and confirm that no signals are flashing. Once all sensors are on properly and lines are solid (unless using PAP), close the device.\nInstruct the participant that if the yellow light on the outside of the device starts flashing during the night, the device has lost a signal. If this happens, open up the device to check the display window to determine which signal has been lost. Once identified, reattach the sensor(s) that has come off.\nPress the circular event button on the outside of the device at lights out and again at lights on. Open the device and check the good study indicator circle.",
    "NOTE: Participants are asked to call the study team in the morning if the good study indicator does not display a complete study. The device is set to record a second night for this reason. If the participant is willing to wear the device a second night, then discuss troubleshooting measures over the phone and encourage the participant to call again at night with any questions or concerns.\nAfter waking up in the morning for the last time, make an entry in the sleep log.\nIf participant wears PAP, attach a PAP titration kit to the device to measure PAP flow. Do this by twisting it into the connector designated for the nasal cannula. Ask the participant to attach the PAP mask to one side of the titration kit adaptor and the hose to the other side of the adapter. Provide a picture to the participant and demonstrate this during the office visit. Inform the participant that all masks and hoses are universal and will fit the provided kit.\n\tNOTE: If the hose does not fit in the adapter, ask participants to feel the end of the hose for a hard-plastic piece. If the mask adapter is still in the hose, the PAP kit adapter will not fit until it is removed.\nInstruct participant regarding single-channel EEG device11 and review the education manual.\n\t\nPlace the device over the participant's head to demonstrate proper placement. Instruct the participant on how to adjust the headgear for proper fit and where to affix the electrodes on the forehead for accurate placement.\nProvide charging instructions and a demonstration in the office.\nProvide extra electrodes to participant in case they are needed.\nAsk participant wearing PAP to bring his current mask to the visit as a mask fitting may be required.",
    "Check PAP masks for a forehead component. If present, provide a loaner mask for the duration of the study to ensure proper fit of the single-channel EEG device.\nEducate the participant about the application of the mask and headgear. Allow participant to apply the mask and adjust the headgear as needed. Instruct participant to apply the device before the mask at night. This will allow removal of mask without dislodging the device.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Hard-of-hearing participants are encouraged to call the helpline when attaching the single-channel EEG so that the research coordinator can confirm the single-channel EEG is properly initialized.\n3. Data Download and Processing\nPlace the actigraphy device on the docking station to connect to computer for download.\n\t\nOpen software and retrieve data14. End the recording and put watch to sleep until next use.\nLaunch actogram to view recording. Use a previously described protocol for reviewing and scoring actigraphy device and sleep log data16.\n\t\t\nRemove all automatically scored intervals and manually score sleep interval using sleep log bedtime and wake time17.\nIf the reported times are misaligned with actigraphy by more than 30 min and the event marker button was pressed within 30 min of activity changes, score the sleep interval using the event markers.\nSet the following data processing parameters prior to generating reports.\n\t\t\nSet Wake Threshold to low with a value of 20.\nSet Immobile Minutes for sleep onset and sleep end to 10.\nGenerate a clinician's report and convert data to analysis software (e.g., Excel) for further analysis.\nConnect the single-channel EEG device to computer, open portal and select data management to upload study15.",
    "Convert the study to a European Data Format (EDF) files in the portal. Select Record, click on Actions and Reports and choose Export EDF File. Download EDF file to computer. If needed, use a split EDF tool to timestamp and split multiple studies on a saved file.\nSet sleep tags using the sleep log bedtimes and wake times.\nScore EDF study using AASM scoring criteria5 and generate a report using any sleep system software.\nConnect the HST device to computer, open software, click on File and Import to upload study to database.\n\t\nVisually inspect the data after download to ensure that there are at least 4 hours of scorable data.\nScore study in the HST database using AASM scoring criteria18. To generate a report, click on Report and choose Generate PSG Report.\n4. Quality assurance procedures\nNOTE: All recordings are reviewed by a registered sleep technologist and a board-certified sleep physician. Specific markers of quality assurance are reviewed as follows:\nReview the actograms to ensure the lights out and lights on times are set accurately to the sleep log times or the event markers per protocol.\nReview the single-channel EEG recording while referencing the sleep log and actigraphy. Recordings are rejected for the following reasons: there is >10% artifact present in the single-channel EEG recording and movement on actogram does not align with artifact; or the EEG recording started 30 minutes late or ended 30 minutes early in comparison to the actogram.\nReject HST recordings if there is <4 hours of scorable data. A board-certified sleep physician reviews each study epoch by epoch to ensure accuracy of scoring.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
