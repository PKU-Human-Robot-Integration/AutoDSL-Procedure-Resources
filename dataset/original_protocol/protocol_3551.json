Procedures for cell lines and clinical samples can be performed at same time or different times.\nHarvest and pellet cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB0231) when cell confluency reaches about 90%.\nNote: One 10 cm plate of cells or 10 million cells are sufficient for one pull-down experiment. CRITICAL: Do not let the cells overgrow or reach 100% confluency, some cell lines change morphology and other characteristics if overgrown.\nCritical: All the procedures should be performed on ice.\nRemove the cell culture medium and wash the cells with pre-chilled cold PBS buffer once, then add another 1 mL cold PBS, gently harvest cells form the plate using a cell scraper and transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,800 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell pellet.\nPause Point: The cell pellets can be stored at this point at −80°C up to 1 year.\nResuspend the cells in 0.75 mL resuspension buffer.\nAdd 0.75 mL 2× lysis buffer and mix thoroughly in the same 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. 0.5% detergent CA630 will dissolve cell membranes and release cytoplasmic protein.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 20 min in 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant that contains soluble protein to a new centrifuge tube and discard the pellet.\nDetermine protein concentration by BCA assay.\nProtein extraction from human breast cancer tissue\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section details how to extract proteins from clinical tissue. These procedures can be performed at same time or different times.",
    "Slightly thaw the clinical tissue specimen on ice, and cut out ~0.2 g of the tissue using a scalpel blade or surgical scissor for one experiment.\nNote: This method is only valid for breast cancer tissue, other types of tissues may use alternative method to extract total protein. A variety of methods are applicable, including sonication, French pressure cell, grinding, glass bead vortexing, detergent lysis, or frozen tissue crushing (Scopes, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: All steps should be performed in cold room and samples should sit on ice.\nNote: Clinical tissue specimen was stored in −80°C freezer, it is very hard to cut the tissue when it is frozen. Let it thaw on ice for about 5 min or until it gets softer.\nCut the tissue into small pieces using surgical scissor on a clean plate.\nTransfer the tissue into a pre-chilled 1 mL glass cylinder of Dounce homogenizer. Add 1 mL 1× lysis buffer.\nHomogenization is performed by 10–15 passes of tight pestle up and down.\nTransfer the sample solution to a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 20 min in 4°C.\nKeep the supernatant and repeat the centrifugation, the supernatant contains soluble protein.\nProtein concentration is determined by BCA assay.\nIntronic splicing enhancer (ISE) pull-down\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the method of the intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) pull-down. Please see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for a step-by-step protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/473-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Step-by-step protocol of ISE pull-down\nAfter BCA protein concentration measurement, 1 mg of protein solution (0.2–0.5 mL lysate contain 1 mg total protein) extracted from cell lines or clinical tissue will be used for each pull-down with non-ISE control probe or ISE probe, so at least 2 mg of protein are required for one set of experiment.",
    "Add 10 μL biotinylated non-ISE control RNA probe or ISE probes (0.75 μM) to protein solution and incubate at 4°C for 2 h or overnight. A short incubation time (e.g., 2 h) can significantly reduce no-specific binding, and incubation overnight will get maximal recovery of target protein and low abundant interactors. With a negative control such as non-ISE control RNA to rule out non-specific binding proteins , an overnight incubation is recommended for this pull-down experiment.\nAdd 50 μL NeutrAvidin agarose and incubate for an additional 2 h at 4°C.\nNote: Wash the agarose twice with PBS and twice with cell lysis buffer before adding to the protein solution.\nCritical: Be careful when removing wash buffer, try not to lose bead and use pipet tips with a narrow end if possible.\nGently spin down the agarose at 500 × g for 1 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant. The ISE RNA-protein complex is captured by the agarose.\nWash the agarose 3 times with 1 mL lysis buffer to remove non-specific binding proteins.\nNote: It is very easy to lose agarose beads during the wash steps, use extra caution when removing the wash buffer.\nWash the agarose additional 5 times with 1 mL resuspension buffer to minimize the amount of residual detergent.\nTransfer 10% of the beads into a new sample tube and elute this 10% of beads with 50 μL SDS sample buffer by boiling at 95°C for 5 min for immunoblotting and the rest of the 90% of beads will be processed for MS analysis in the next step.",
    "Note: Detergent needs to be removed prior to MS analysis, because it contaminates the HPLC column and MS instrument and also suppresses the signal of peptide. Resuspension buffer does not contain any detergent, can solely be used as wash buffer without PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail.\nCritical: In the final wash, after adding wash buffer, transfer buffer and agarose beads to a new, low-retention tube, then spin down the beads again and remove the wash buffer completely by using a long gel loading tip which has an outer diameter<0.3 mm to prevent loss of beads.\nPerform western blotting to check the known interactors of ISE probes in the pull-down product before going for MS analysis.\ne.g., Known interactors including ESRP1 (~7 0kDa), ESRP2 (~90 kDa), TJP3 (~130 kDa), QKI (~40 kDa), LYAR (~45 kDa), SNRPB2 (~26 kDa), SRPK1 (~95k Da), SNRPA1 (~28 kDa), could be separated well on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. For further details, please refer to (Wang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])\nSample preparation for mass spectrometry\nTiming: 2 days\nThis protocol describes trypsin digestion on agarose beads and peptide desalting for LC-MS/MS. Please see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for the step-by-step protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/473-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flowchart of sample preparation for on-beads trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis\nOn-beads tryptic digestion for LC-MS/MS. Add 125 μL trypsin digestion buffer containing 5 ng/μL trypsin and 1 mM DTT to the 90% of beads from step 22 and incubate with beads at room temperature on a mixer for 30 min. Trypsin will quickly digest the large protein complex into peptides.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 1 min at room temperature to bring down the beads, transfer the supernatant that contains pre-digested protein or peptides to a new, low-retention tube.",
    "One additional elution is applied by adding 250 μL elution buffer containing 5 mM Iodoacetamide (IAA) and incubated on a mixer for 10 min at room temperature in dark.\nNote: IAA is light sensitive, to keep the reaction in dark, wrap the rack or cover of the mixer with aluminum foil.\nSpin down the beads, then transfer the supernatant/elute to a new tube.\nRepeat the elution with IAA one more time and combine all supernatants/elutes in one tube.\nProteins were digested overnight at room temperature.\nPause Point: Samples at this point can be stored at −80°C freezer for up to one year.\nPeptide cleanup and desalting with C18 StageTips, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for the setups.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/473-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The preparation of StageTips\nProduction a single layer C18 StageTips with 200 μL low-retention tips as described in previously published protocol (Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). In practice, StageTips are made by placing a small portion of C18 materials in a clean 200-mL pipette tip. The C18 material is stamped out using a blunt-ended syringe needle and then released inside a 200-mL pipette tip using plunger. Adding an adapter and collection tube will automate all the steps on a bench top centrifuge (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: One layer of C18 materials cut by the needle has a capacity up to 30 μg of peptide, use multiple layers if more material is loaded.\nAcidify (pH~3) the peptides in the elute with 3 μL (0.5%) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). pH measurement is not necessary here.\nMix them well and centrifuge at 12000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet any precipitation after the pH change. Keep the supernatant.",
    "Conditioning and equilibration of the spin StageTips. Wet the StageTip once with 50 μL methanol and centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 1 min to let it pass through the C18 material. Discard the liquid in the collection tube.\nCritical: Caution: Methanol is toxic and flammable.\nWash the StageTip once with 50 μL buffer B and spin at 5,000 rpm for 1 min and discard the liquid.\nEquilibrate the StageTip twice with 50 μL buffer A and discard the liquid. The StageTips is now conditioned and ready for use.\nTo perform peptide binding, replace a new collection tube and load the supernatant from step 33 on to the StageTip and centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 2~3 min. Retain elute as flow through fraction.\nReplace a new collection tube. Wash the StageTip with 200 μL buffer A and spin at 5,000 rpm for 3 min and discard the liquid.\nRepeat step 38 twice and discard the liquid.\nReplace a new collection tube, load 100 μL buffer B on to the StageTip to elute the peptide by spinning at 5,000 rpm for 2–3 min at room temperature.\nNo need to replace collection tube, repeat the elution one more time and combine the peptides from all elution.\nConcentrate and dry the eluate of a reversed-phase StageTip using a freeze dryer or SpeedVac. It takes approximately 1 h to finish the process.\nPause Point: Dried peptides can be stored at −80°C indefinitely.\nNote: As in step 37, the flow through fraction can be retained just in case. Dried peptide at the bottom of the tube may not be visible depends on the amount of the peptide content.\nAlternatives: C18 ZipTip Pipette Tips can replace the use of C18 Stage Tips.",
    "Critical: Always use low-retention tubes and tips without additives or coatings for maximum recovery of samples for all sample preparations for mass spectrometry.\nCritical: Do not keep the organic solvent in the tube for too long, which will lead to plastic polymer contamination to the samples. Use glass tubes or vials instead for long term storage.\nMass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes LC-MS/MS sequencing of tryptic peptides from ISE pull-downs\nDissolve the dried peptide samples in 30 μL 0.1% formic acid, vortex for 1 min and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 25 μL the peptide sample to a glass sample vial.\nInject 4 μL sample into the C18 column and peptides were first loaded on to a 2 mm × 0.5 mm reverse-phase (RP) C18 trap column at a flow rate of 1 μL/min, then eluted and fractionated on a 25 cm C18 RP column (360 μm × 75 μm × 3 μm) with a gradient at a constant flow rate of 250 nL/min over 180 min linear gradient showing below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_473_7.csv\nThe Velos LTQ Orbitrap was operated in the positive-ion mode with a data-dependent automatic switch between survey Full MS scan (m/z 300–1,800) (externally calibrated to a mass accuracy of <5 ppm and a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400) and CID MS/MS acquisition of the top 15 most intense ions.
