    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nEstablishing Organoids Using Cancer Tissues\nTiming: ∼2 h\nCut tissue samples into small pieces (∼10-30 mg) using a disposable sterile scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/24-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Small Pieces of Resected Tumor Tissues\nTransfer one of the cut tissues into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and then add digestion buffer (∼200 μL). Mince the tissue using sterile ophthalmic scissors in the tube. The other pieces of tissue can be utilized for extraction of DNA and RNA or histology.\nAdd digestion buffer (∼800 μL) and incubate at 37°C for 1 h using a shaking heat block (∼800 rpm).\nAlternatives: A shaking water bath can be used instead, but we have had cell culture contamination by using a shaking water bath several times. Thus, we highly recommend the shaking heat block.\nPause Point: You can leave the experiments for 1 hour.\nSettle under gravity for 1 min and collect supernatant in another 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nOptional: the pellet can be used for re-process for a second organoid culture establishment by repeating steps from 1c. We have succeeded in establishment of BTC organoids by a second establishment once, whereas a first establishment was failed.\nCentrifuge the collected supernatant at ∼500 g for 3 min at 24-26°C.\nRemove and discard supernatant and wash pellet with 1 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge at ∼500 g for 3 min at 24-26°C.\nRemove supernatant and add Matrigel on ice. Remove all supernatant (PBS) as possible, as remaining of PBS results in dilution of Matrigel. Matrigel should be ice-cold. We usually add 20 μL Matrigel for approximately 5 X 103 cells. Cells and Matrigel should be mixed well by pipetting several times in the tube on ice. Avoid bubbles in Matrigel when pipetting.",
    "Plate cells suspended in Matrigel on a culture plate. We usually plate ∼20 μL suspension of cells and Matrigel in a 48-well plate to form dome (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Any types of plates can be used, as no specific treatment on a plate is necessary. Incubate at 37°C for 15 min to solidify Matrigel dome.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/24-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Matrigel Dome\nOverlay culture medium and incubate at 37°C in a standard incubator (5% CO2). Medium should be prewarmed at 24-26°C before use. We usually add 250 μL culture medium in a 48-well plate for initial plating. After 3-4 days of culture, we add more 250 μL culture medium (total 500 μL). You can observe the growth of organoids after ∼5 days.\nPassage of Organoids\nTiming: ∼1 h\nWe typically incubate organoids for 7-10 days between initial plating and passage.\nRemove culture medium.\nAdd 500 μL TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per well at 24-26°C and mix with Matrigel dome well by pipetting several times to generate a single cell suspension.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nCollect in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at ∼2000 g for 3 min at 24-26°C.\nRemove and discard supernatant. Matrigel is disintegrated and removed.\nWash pellet with 1 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge at ∼2000 g for 3 min at 24-26°C.\nRemove supernatant and add Matrigel on ice as described in step 1 h.\nPlate cells suspended in Matrigel on a culture plate and incubate to allow Matrigel to solidify, overlay culture medium and incubate at 37°C as described in steps 1i and 1j.\nWe typically passage BTC organoids once every 7-10 days and split cells at ratios 1:5-1:10. We have maintained BTC organoids stably for > 1 year without morphologic alterations.",
    "Note: Passage interval depends on the growth of cells. When organoids are confluent in Matrigel (i.e., there is no space for organoids growing), they should be passaged.\nOnce organoids can be cultured stably and passaged several times, they can be used for analysis and/or experimentation.\nQuality Control of BTC Organoids\nWhen establishing organoids using surgically resected BTC tissue specimens, careful validation that the established organoids are cancer-derived is important. For example, you should check the following points.\nCancer organoids and non-cancer organoids exhibit completely different morphology as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Non-cancer organoids show a simple large cystic morphology with a thin monolayer, whereas cancer organoids exhibit irregular morphologies including a cystic structure and a solid structure that recapitulate the pathological features of the original primary BTCs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/24-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Morphologic Features of Cancer and Non-cancer Organoids\nScale bars, 1000 μm. IHCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; PDA, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; GBC, gallbladder cancer; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma; BDC, bile duct cancer.\nCancer organoids can be cultured stably for > 1 year. There is no significant difference in the morphological changes in cancer organoids between early (< 2 months) and late (> 4 months) passages (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). On the other hand, non-cancer organoids show more elevated proliferation activity at the early stage than cancer organoids, but cease proliferation at around passage 15 as shown in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. See also Figure 3 in our original paper (Saito et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/24-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Culture Courses of Cancer and Non-cancer Organoids\nNon-cancer organoids for which long-term culture is not possible do not harbor any driver gene mutations, whereas cancer organoids for which long-term culture is possible harbor mutations of driver genes such as TP53 and KRAS. See Figure 5D in our original paper (Saito et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "The success rates for establishment of organoids derived from BTCs in our study (Saito et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) were relatively low (IHCC: 50%, GBC: 20%) in comparison to those for colon cancer organoids described previously (van de Wetering et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). We consider that establishment of organoids using BTC tissues is relatively difficult for the following reasons:\nThe size of surgically resected BTC tissue samples is generally small (especially GBC and BDC).\nBTC tissues contain a number of stromal cells such as fibroblasts, blood vessels and immune cells other than cancer cells. Thus, it is often difficult to resect substantial amounts of BTC cells without contamination by non-cancer cells.\nThe frequency of driver gene mutations such as TP53 and KRAS in BTCs is relatively low in comparison to other cancers such as colorectal cancer (Jain et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])."
