    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGenerating BicC mutant flies by genetic crossing and culturing of control wild types\nTiming: 2–3 weeks, excluding stock amplification\nNote: Like control OreR flies,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] stable mutant lines can be maintained and amplified in culture vials or bottles.29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] Also see note below. In contrast, sterile mutants, e.g., the BicC mutants, must be constantly generated by genetic crossing. To minimize interference from possible second side mutations, use trans-heterozygote flies whenever possible. For BicC, unmated females harboring chromosomal deletion Df (2L) RA5 (Δ) encompassing the BicC gene, in trans to the Curly of Oyster (CyO) balancer are crossed to males from two hypomorphic alleles, also in trans to CyO: BicCYC33/CyO and BicCIIF34/CyO, to obtain BicCΔ/YC33 and BicCΔ/IIF34 progenies.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Unmated maternal Df (2L) RA5/CyO flies and paternal BicCYC33/CyO and BicCIIF34/CyO flies are collected from amplified stocks. Note, the BicC flies grow best in wide culture vials.\nCritical: In drug and survival assays, genetic crosses must be set up in culture vials with empirically titrated numbers of females and males to obtain reliably healthy progeny from each genotypic combination. Typically, 12 BicCΔ/CyO females and 7 BicCYC33/CyO or BicCIIF34/CyO males are crossed in each vial, with yeast sprinkled on top. Especially helpful for sickly mutants, yeast supplementation supports fly health and fertility. To obtain similar numbers of progeny BicCΔ/YC33 and BicCΔ/IIF34, crosses are established in a 40/60 ratio respectively. To obtain equivalent amounts and quality of control OreR flies, simultaneous and parallel cultures in identical yeasted vials are prepared with five females and three males and handled identically to the BicC crosses.\nNote: All genotypes tested should be cultured and handled simultaneously and in identical conditions.",
    "Note: About 30% of the wild type stocks and lines in the Bloomington Stock Center collection harbor the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis.30[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29] Wolbachia alters the reproductive fitness, male survival, fly immunity, behavior, activity levels, longevity, several metabolic pathways, and may have dramatic effects on mutant phenotypes.31[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30],32[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31],33[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32],34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33],35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34],36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35],37[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36],38[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37] Wolbachia can be cured by treating flies with tetracycline (250 μg/mL in food, for two generations), taking into account that this treatment may have long-lasting effects.39[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]\nStock Amplification.\n3–4 weeks prior to the planned experiment, amplify stocks.\nTransfer adults every 3–4 days to build up enough collection vials.\nNote: For BicC mutants, 50 vials of the maternal line BicCΔ/CyO and 20 vials of the paternal lines BicCYC33/CyO and BicCIIF34/CyO yield enough flies to seed 120 crosses in 3–5 days. Staggered cultures allow continued collection to maintain a constant pipeline of genetic crosses.\nNote: working with large cultures such as those described here increases the risk of contamination and may amplify the results of events of genetic drift and reversion. Ensure proper handling to prevent the former and regularly monitor to spot the latter. Organizing the amplified stock vials in sets of identical racks with “lineage tracing” allows to effectively purge all vials related to such events while minimizing consequences for the yield of the pipeline.\nGenetic Crossing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The described conditions yield comparable amounts of BicC mutants and OreR wild type flies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3186-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Producing test fly populations\n(A) Genetic crossing and phenotypic selection to isolate BicC transheterozygote mutants. The Punnett square depicts the progeny genotypes and viability from crossing maternal Df(2L)RA5/CyO (ΔBicC, deletion, curly wings) and either one of paternal lines BicCYC33/CyO and BicCIIF34/CyO (BicC ∗, hypomorphs, curly wings). The BicC progeny from this cross (ΔBicC/BicC∗) is straight winged.\n(B) Continuous culturing to yield OreR flies or stable mutants.",
    "From the amplified Df(2L)RA5/CyO maternal line, collect 1200 unmated females.\nFrom the amplified BicCYC33/CyO paternal line, collect 200–280 males (enough for 40 crosses, see note below).\nFrom the amplified BicC IIF34/CyO paternal line, collect 300–420 males (enough for 60 crosses, see note below).\nFor each yeasted vial, add 12 Df(2L)RA5/CyO unmated females and 5–7 male flies from the respective paternal lines.\nSet up control vials with 5 OreR females and 3 males.\nIncubate at the desired temperature and lighting conditions for ten days, or the developmental period of the specific genotypes used.\nTransfer adults to fresh yeasted vials on day four, day seven, day ten and then discard.\nFly collection and sorting.\nTwo days after the progeny flies begin to eclose, recover the desired phenotypes.\nNote: For BicC, straight winged individuals are sorted and housed into food vials. This yields populations of 0–2 days old individuals that are optimal for most assays.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]\nContinue collecting eclosed flies from the vials every 2 days.\nTo prevent recovery of second-generation individuals, do not harvest from the same vial beyond 9 days.\nNote: Staggered cultures and proper scaling yield a sustainable culturing pipeline producing adults for a medium throughput drug and phenotypic testing to be used by multiple people. Adoption of standard labeling and operating procedures for all laboratory personnel minimizes confusion and the potential consequences of incorrect population aging or inconsistent culturing conditions.\nAging\nWhen aging the progeny flies, maintain them in batches of up to 50 flies per large vial and transfer to fresh food every 2–3 days to keep them well fed until the desired age for testing is reached.\nSupplementary yeast (3-4 2 mm diameter pellets) sprinkled on top of the food vial may support health of aging mutant flies.\nNote: Excess yeast may affect lifespan and egg laying.40[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]",
    "Note: Considerations about population size and potentially compromised survival of sickly mutants are vital to plan a reliable yield of the fly pipeline to sustain the throughput of the planned drug testing assays.\nCompound administration\nTiming: up to 1 month\nDepending on the experimental conditions, tested compounds can be administered mixed with food or through a self-feeding protocol using capillaries. Here we discuss typical set ups and possible modifications.\nCompound added food 30 min set up, 3 h to overnight (12–16 h) for compound diffusion. If using capillary feeding, skip directly to 7.\nSmall (2 mL) vials.\nAdd up to 20 μL of compound or vehicle to each vial and let diffuse into the food for at least 3 h.\nAdd up to 25 testing flies (here, 25 BicC or OreR control females plus 5–7 males of the same genotype to simulate normal conditions).\nEvery 3 days, transfer the flies into identical new vials until either testing time or, for survival assays, until all flies are dead.\nUsing populations of ∼20 flies per each time point and drug concentration, and a time course format, establish effective drug dosage and treatment length by performing the desired readout assay, e.g., the cystic index described in the phenotypic assays[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] section.\nPerform the drug assay with large population size for statistical confidence (n = 150-200).\nLarge (10 mL) vials.\nAdd up to 200 μL of compound or vehicle to each vial and allow diffusion for at least 3 h.\nAdd up to 50 testing flies and proceed as in 6a iii-v.\nPerform a drug consumption control assay.\nUse colored food vials as in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and culture as in 6a i-ii.\nMonitor the fly abdomen every day using a stereomicroscope.\nRecord consumption. See the four notes below.",
    "Note: Ingested dye will be visible through the semi-transparent cuticle and can be photographed.\nNote: Depending on the food consumption and dye, stain intensity and contrast change over time. Daily monitoring for three days typically allows to find the clearest pattern. Once ingested by live flies, food coloring eventually diffuses in the entire body and reduces overall contrast. Flies can also be frozen and photographed later.\nNote: Although this is a qualitative assay, it could be made semi-quantitative using dyes the consumption and excretion of which can be measured spectrophotometrically (e.g., FD&C Blue 1,41[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib40] Orange 4,42[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib41] Orange G and Yellow 1043[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib42]). Alternatively, food could be spiked with radioisotopes, in which case the labeled flies must be strictly contained.44[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib43]\nNote: a comparative review of food intake assays45[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib44] and a table of timespan and temporal resolution of food intake assays46[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib45] have been published recently.\nCapillary feeding 60–90 min. Capillary feeding (CAFÉ)47[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib46] assay set up, based on Stuivenberg et al. (2022)20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] with modifications.\nPrepare the vial caps:\nUse a pair of scissors to cut a hole through the center of a vial plug, either cotton or foam.\nCut off the terminal third of a 20-200 μL micropipette tip and insert it through the holed vial plug.\nWedge an uncut yellow tip to secure the capillary inside the cut pipette housing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3186-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Capillary feeding setup\n(A) Preparation and setting of the capillary feeding.\n(B) Tilting the vials in racks prevents capillary leakage and approximates the natural feeding stance.\nPlace the plug on a large agar vial.\nCapillary filling.\nUse capillaries of the following specifications: 75 mm, I.D: 1.1–1.2 mm, Wall: 0.2 ± 0.02 mm.\nPrepare aliquots of compound solutions at the desired concentration(s) and vehicle control in 5% sucrose.",
    "Touch one end of the capillary tube to the surface of the solution and tilt to stream mixture into the capillary until full.\nCarefully blotting the tip on a paper towel, remove solution until approximately 40 mm of solution is left in the capillary. Using a ruler, measure the exact length of the liquid column in each loaded capillary and record it.\nSlide the loaded capillary tube through the cut pipette tip till its end hits halfway down the vial.\nAdd 25 test flies. Here, 25 flies (0–2 day old) of each sex are used in sextuplicate to yield test populations of 150 flies of each sex and genotypes.\nPrevent leakage from the capillary end and approximate the natural feeding stance, by tilting the vials 45 degrees (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIncubate at the desired temperatures and light conditions.\nEvaporation control. Set up an identical vial with no flies and a capillary loaded with the vehicle control solution. Incubate alongside the test vials in identical conditions.\nEvery 24 h, record the liquid left in the capillary and refill it to reconstitute a 40 mm liquid column.\nFor each vial, determine the 24-h consumption by subtracting the remaining volume in the capillary of the test vial from the remaining volume in the capillary of the evaporation control.\nNote: The agar vials are normally replaced every 3–4 days to ensure optimal moisture, or more often should there be larval interference.\nNote: Each trial is minimally done at least in triplicate. Flies are typically 0–2 days old at the start but can be aged as described in the next section.\nOptional: To facilitate data collection in survival assays, making a preset spreadsheet file allows to monitor the experiment in real time.\nPhenotypic assays\nTiming: up to 2 months",
    "Several drug treatment readouts are possible, which will depend on the studied mechanisms and phenotypes. Here we discuss three common assays with the relative statistical analyses: cystic index, survival, and negative geotaxis.\nNote: Microdissection enables direct monitoring of the organs of interest for phenotypic analysis. Here we describe the cystic index, as in Millet-Boureima et al., Millet-Boureima et al., and Gamberi et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] based on the study of the Malpighian tubules, which are analogous to the tubular portion of the human nephron.48[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib47] If not performed, skip directly to step 9.\nMicrodissection and cystic index (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3186-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Typical experimental design to test the biological activity of a molecule (e.g., rapamycin)\n(A and B) For both food-added (A) and capillary-fed compounds (B), at least triplicate vials are prepared for each time point and condition (e.g., drug concentration in dose response assays, right). All genotypes, conditions and controls are assayed synchronously and in identical conditions. Three exemplary readout assays are shown.\n(C and D) Cystic index of Malpighian tubules of BicC flies treated with AVPI as in Millet-Boureima et al. (2019)1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] or vehicle. (C) Nested plot quantification and (D) micro photographs showed reduced cysts (arrows) upon treatment.\n(E) Example of negative geotaxis (or climbing) assay to compare the fitness of mutant and control genotypes over time, with bar graph representation.\n(F) Survival assays compare survival of drug- and vehicle-treated populations over time.\nSet up parallel populations of flies for all tested conditions, food and supplementation and incubate until the testing age is reached (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nMicro-dissect the Malpighian tubule pairs in a concave well containing PBT (1× phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 0.01% Tween-20).\nPlace a ∼50 μL drop of PBT on a microscope slide and align the tubules.",
    "Photograph the tubules ex vivo through a stereomicroscope equipped with cold lights and a camera. We find that double illumination from the top and bottom yields optimal contrast (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Other types of illumination can be used.\nScore and record the cysts and their location from triplicate or quadruplicate sets of 50 females in large vials for both control and drug treatments (n = 150-200, Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nNote: More studies have been published on Malpighian tubules from females than from males, which constituted the original reference for our Drosophila PKD model.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] However, male Malpighian tubules can also be tested.\nAssign cysts to the anterior and posterior tubule pair.\nFor both the anterior and posterior pair separately, assign cysts to the tubular region i.e., proximal (15% of tubule length), intermediate (55%) and terminal (30%) (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3186_2.csv\nExamples of negative geotaxis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E) and survival assay (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F) are also shown.\nPerform statistical analysis (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section).\nNote: Relying on a natural Drosophila reflex for which flies climb on the wall of a container after mechanical stimulation, the assays below entail tapping the flies to the bottom of a graduated container and measuring the distance they climb upwards during a set time.49[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib49],50[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib50] The resulting performance value is used as a proxy for neuromuscular fitness in different conditions, age, and genotypes. If not performed, skip directly to step 10.\nNegative geotaxis (climbing) assays (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nThe day before testing, place sets of five to ten appropriately aged flies each into one culture vial and incubate as usual. Prepare separate test populations of female and males.\nFor regular assays we use triplicate vials with fifty flies. Pilot experiments can be carried out with 25 individuals.",
    "Mark ten centimeters from the cap on the side of a graded 15 mL conical tube.\nUse a funnel to transfer the flies from the culture vial to the graded conical tube without using fly anesthesia to minimize stress triggers.\nPlace the tube on the bench, cap side down.\nAcclimate the flies for 1 min.\nGently tap the vial on a rubber fly mat three times to collect all flies on the cap, which acts as a starting line.\nStart a timer and record the number of flies reaching a 10 cm threshold in 10 s.\nNote: This can be done manually with small batches of 5-10 flies, or it could be video-recorded and analyzed.50[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib50]\nTransfer the flies into a new food vial and either culture until tested again or discard.\nNote: To monitor changes of the motor ability over time, the test may be repeated weekly throughout the fly survival51[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib51],52[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib52] (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nAnalyze and plot the data as described in the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section.\nNote: Certain genotypes may show fatigue (fewer flies cross the line) or learning (more flies cross the line) during the assay replicas. It is therefore important to examine the trend of the repeats and evaluate the suitability of averaging all results or compare the plotted results separately from each replica.\nCritical: Because activity may respond to circadian cues40[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39],50[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib50] and nutritional state,53[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib53] the climbing assay should be performed at the same time of day and vials from the same batch of food should be used for all flies tested.\nNote: Survival assays are used to monitor longevity in populations of different genotypes, conditions, and/or drug treatment, compared to control.40[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39] If not performed, skip directly to the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section.\nSurvival assays (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).",
    "Set up parallel populations of 50 flies each in large culture vials with the chosen food and supplementation.\nRecord the starting date and fly age, and all experimental conditions and factors that may help result interpretation.\nNote: Vials may include either normal or specialized food (e.g., compound and vehicle treatment,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] high salt,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] or no food for desiccation,29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] etc.)\nFrom now on, manage the populations in parallel, identically, and simultaneously. Males and females can be mixed in known amounts, aware that mating can affect egg laying and longevity.40[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]\nEvery three days record the number of surviving flies, ideally at the same time of the day. Record males and females separately. Also note any occurrence that may affect the results and help data interpretation (e.g., accidental deaths of flies trapped in food).\nNote: For conditions reducing survival to 24 h (e.g., desiccation) monitor every 1–2 h.\nCalculate the percentage survival for each vial.\nContinue monitoring as in 10d-e. every three days until all flies in the testing populations have died.\nPerform statistical analysis as discussed in the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section below.\nNote: Wet vials (from improper food preparation or larval activity) may trap adults on the food surface and increase casualty deaths. Use quality food and transfer flies avoiding tapping too harshly. For lines with high egg-laying, consider transferring adults more frequently (e.g., every 2 days), recording this change to aid result interpretation."
