    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell seeding – Day 0\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe steps below describe the seeding of BV2 cells in preparation for de novo protein synthesis detection using bioorthogonal labeling and click chemistry the following day. For quantification by microscopy, seed BV2 cells into 8-well chamber slides. For flow cytometry and Western blotting, seed them into 6-well plates.\nCritical: Cell culture work should be performed in a sterile cell culture biosafety cabinet. All bottles and equipment should be wiped with 70% w/w ethanol before use and a sterile workflow should be adhered to throughout experimental procedures.\nNote: The total number of cells required determines the flask size needed to grow your stock culture. A T25 flask is sufficient for experiments using up to 10 × 8-well chamber slides, and a T75 is sufficient for experiments using 8 × 6 well plates. While handling these numbers is possible, we do not recommend using more than 4 × 8-well chamber slides or 4 × 6-well plates at a time, as this will increase timing and thus variability in sample processing.\nFor microscopy only: prepare 8-well chamber slides by coating with PDL for 1 h prior to seeding cells:\nAdd 200 μL 0.5 mg/mL PDL to each well and place in a 37°C incubator for at least 1 h.\nFollowing the incubation period, remove PDL and wash 3 × 3 min each with PBS. Remove PBS after the last wash, and place back in 37°C incubator until use.\nCritical: PBS washes are necessary, as monomeric PDL is toxic to cells.\nPlace culture medium and 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA in 37°C water bath 10–15 min prior to beginning work.\nDetach cells from the T25 or T75 culture flask using the following steps:",
    "Remove medium and wash briefly with 5 mL (T25) or 10 mL (T75) PBS at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove PBS and add pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA depending on the flask size:\n1 mL for T25 stock culture flasks.\n3 mL For T75 stock culture flasks.\nIncubate cells in a 37°C incubator for 3 min.\nFollowing 3 min incubation, tap sides of flask and check under microscope to ensure all cells have detached.\nNote: If cells are not all detached, continue tapping the flask edges, or incubate for 2 or more minutes. Do not allow cells to sit in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for longer than 10 min. Alternatively, detachment can be forced by more vigorous aspiration and release (i.e., by pipetting) of the Trypsin-EDTA over the cells.\nAdd 1 mL (for T25) or 3 mL (for T75) pre-warmed culture medium to inhibit trypsin.\nCollect cells from flask into a 15 mL tube by pipetting.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 3 min.\nRemove medium without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend in 1 mL fresh culture medium.\nPerform cell counts to determine cell numbers / mL via preferred cell counting method (i.e., a cell counting chamber or an automated cell counting machine).\nSeed cells as follows:\nFor microscopy experiments using 8-well chamber slides, seed 25,000 cells/well.\nFor flow cytometry and Western blot experiments using 6-well plates, seed 350,000 cells/well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2814-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Seeding of BV2 cells on Day 0 and imaged on Day 1\n(A) To achieve appropriate cell densities on Day 1, cells need to be seeded the day before (Day 0) at 25,000 cells per well in 8-well chamber slides, or 350,000 cells/well in 6-well plates.\n(B) Bright field microscopy image showing the density of BV2 cells on Day 1.",
    "Critical: Differences in cell density will influence protein synthesis levels. To ensure cell numbers are consistent across wells, thoroughly mix cell suspension before seeding. Tilt the chamber slides or plates to disperse cells homogeneously (do not swirl). Ideal cell density is presented in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. For further help, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPlace seeded cells in a 37°C incubator and leave them to grow overnight (16–20 h).\nAHA labeling – Day 1\nTiming: 30 min labeling period + 30 min prep\nand/or\nTiming: 4 h labeling period + 30 min prep\nTo investigate the process of protein synthesis in BV2 cells, we have used either a 30 min or a 4 h AHA-labeling period. The shorter 30 min time point is useful for studying processes in microglial cells that are fast, for example phagocytosis. The longer time 4 h point allows for observation of protein synthesis and the derived effects later than the 30 min time point. Longer AHA-labeled proteins could help also increase the contrast between background and FUNCAT signal, thus increasing the sensitivity of the method if needed.\nAs controls, we use methionine and/or AHA supplemented with anisomycin (a protein synthesis inhibitor). These controls are used to ensure successful bioorthogonal labeling and click chemistry. Other protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide can also be used.\nThe following steps provide the details of how to perform AHA-labeling of proteins synthesized within a 30 min or 4 h time period (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2814-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental timeline for 30 min or 4 h AHA-labeling",
    "Seed cells on Day 0 at the required density. The following day, label newly synthesized proteins via AHA incorporation for either 30 min or 4 h, using appropriate controls (i.e., methionine, and/or AHA with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin). Fix cells or collect proteins at the end of the AHA-labeling period.\nWarm culture medium in a 37°C water bath 10 min prior to beginning the experiment.\nThaw 0.4 M AHA, 0.4 M methionine, and 10 mM anisomycin (if required).\nPrepare experimental medium as follows:\nFor 8-well chamber slides; 300 μL medium per well:\nFor AHA labeling, add 3 μL 0.4 M AHA per 300 μL medium to obtain a working concentration of 4 mM.\nFor methionine control, add 3 μL of 0.4 M methionine per 300 μL medium for a working concentration of 4 mM.\nFor AHA and anisomycin controls, add 3 μL of 0.4 M AHA to obtain a working concentration of 4 mM AHA and 1.2 μL of 10 mM anisomycin per 300 μL medium for a working concentration of 40 μM anisomycin.\nFor 6-well plates; 1 mL medium per well:\nFor AHA labeling, add 10 μL 0.4 M AHA per 1 mL medium to reach a working concentration of 4 mM.\nFor methionine control, add 10 μL of 0.4 M methionine per 1 mL medium for a working concentration of 4 mM.\nFor AHA with anisomycin controls, add 10 μL of 0.4 M AHA plus 4 μL of 10 mM anisomycin per 1 mL medium for a working concentration of 40 μM anisomycin.\nNote: To minimize pipetting errors during the treatment of multiple wells, always prepare a master mix solution (10% in excess) from which appropriate volumes are added to wells.",
    "Note: We have found that 4 h anisomycin treatment is toxic to BV2 cells, but can be used for 30 min.\nRemove medium from wells and replace with experimental medium containing either methionine, AHA with anisomycin, or AHA (prepared in step 13).\nIncubate in 37°C incubator for either 30 min OR 4 h depending on desired labeling period.\nNote: For labeling of other cell types or different treatment conditions, these labeling periods may require further optimization (see limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]).\nIMPORTANT: Depending on the experimental design, proceed to either A) Microscopy-based quantification of FUNCAT signal[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] OR B) Flow cytometry-based quantification of FUNCAT signal[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] OR C) Western blotting-based quantification of FUNCAT signal[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5].\nMicroscopy-based quantification of FUNCAT signal\nTiming: Day 1 - 4 h\nTiming: Day 2 + (for steps 30 to 31)\nThe following steps describe how to perform cell fixation and copper (I)-catalyzed click chemistry to visualize newly synthesized proteins using FUNCAT and microscopy after AHA-labeling. Microscopy data is quantified as mean FUNCAT signal per cell.\nWarm medium in 37°C water bath.\nRemove AHA/methionine/anisomycin-containing medium from wells and add 300 μL pre-warmed fresh medium. For AHA with anisomycin treated cells, add to a concentration of 4 mM AHA and 40 μM anisomycin to the fresh medium to ensure a sustained protein synthesis inhibition.\nPlace back in a 37°C incubator for 10 min.\nNote: This 10 min post-treatment incubation with fresh medium is performed to decrease intracellular free AHA and therefore increase signal to noise ratio.\nRemove medium and wash briefly once with PBS.\nRemove PBS and add 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in PBS); incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nDuring 15 min incubation, prepare Microscopy FUNCAT blocking buffer.",
    "Critical: PFA can severely irritate and burn the skin and eyes, may cause irritation of the nose, mouth, throat, and lungs if inhaled. Always wear appropriate PPE.\nRemove PFA and wash twice with 1× TBS for 5 min each at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: From this point, we use TBS rather than PBS, however, continued use of PBS could be also compatible.\nPause point: If needed, leave at 4°C overnight (16–20 h) in TBS.\nPermeabilize and block with Microscopy FUNCAT blocking buffer for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash 3 times with 1× TBS for 5 min each at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDuring washes, prepare click chemistry reaction solution using Invitrogen Click-iT® Cell Reaction Buffer kit and Alexa Fluor 647 alkyne according to the following table, in the exact order of reagents presented.\nNote: Calculate your required master mix volume for 100 μL per well plus 10% excess (i.e., for 12 samples, prepare a total of 1.32 mL master mix):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2814_14.csv\nCritical: Use click chemistry reaction solution within 15 min of preparation.\nCritical: Copper (II) sulphate (CuSO4) can cause serious skin and eye irritation and is harmful if swallowed or inhaled. Always wear appropriate PPE.\nRemove the wash solution and add 100 μL click chemistry reaction master mix solution per well; shield from light and incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a gentle rocker (20 rpm) for 1 h.\nOptional: If performing immunostaining after the click reaction, wash three times with 1× TBS, permeabilize and block for 30 min, incubate with primary antibody overnight (16–20 h) at 4°C and 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with the secondary antibody, as required, before proceeding to step 27. This will add an extra day to the protocol.",
    "Wash 3 times with 1× TBS for 5 min each at room temperature (20°C–25°C). Following the last wash, add 1:20 Alexa fluor 488 phalloidin to visualize the cell outline and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash 3 times with 1× TBS for 5 min each; in the second wash, add 1:10,000 DAPI (1 μg/mL stock) to label cell nuclei.\nRemove frame of the well-chambers and gently tap to remove excess liquid; add 3 drops of DAKO mounting medium. Coverslip and seal.\nNote: The number of days/h required for imaging and analysis will vary depending on the experimental set up.\nImage DAPI (405), Phalloidin (488), and FUNCAT (647) channels at an appropriate magnification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2814-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. A guide for imaging BV2 cells using a confocal microscope at 63× magnification\n(A) To decrease sampling bias, we recommend taking multiple images (≥ 9) from different areas of each well, such as in this grid example – red squares depict imaging acquisition areas. This is to ensure a representative capture of the whole well.\n(B) Representative image of BV2 cells at 63× magnification with FUNCAT fluorescence in magenta.\nNote: To visualize FUNCAT in BV2 cells, we use 63× magnification and a confocal microscope (but other microscope types and a lower magnification can also be used). Imaging within one week is also recommended. Make sure to record and keep all microscopy parameters consistent between images and microscopy sessions. Ensure even sampling within wells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Note: Depending on the specifications of the microscope and objectives used, imaging at higher magnification will increase the signal-to-background ratio. However, it is important to note that under identical laser settings, higher magnification objectives can lead to photobleaching. As such, we use a low laser intensity setting. We suggest always to adjust the acquisition setting accordingly on their microscope.\nQuantify FUNCAT fluorescence for each individual cell using the IMARIS software (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) by using the Phalloidin fluorescence to create a surface of the area of the cells. IMARIS calculates the average fluorescence intensity of the FUNCAT signal (the measure of newly synthesized proteins), within each Phalloidin positive cell surface.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2814-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Quantifying FUNCAT fluorescence in BV2 cells using IMARIS\n(A) Create cell surface using the channel for the cell outline marker, phalloidin (in this case, green). Apply appropriate cell surface and threshold values to capture the whole cell.\n(B) If cells are touching, joining the surfaces of two cells, separate them using the ‘Cut Surface’ function.\n(C) Ensure that all cells are properly separated.\n(D) Export data as excel file.\nConvert raw image files to IMARIS format (.ims) using IMARIS Convertor software.\nIn IMARIS, use the phalloidin channel to create a surface of the cells in the image (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) with the Surface function, using appropriate surface detail and threshold values.\nUse the default ‘Number of Voxels Img = 1’ function and adjust the threshold to remove unwanted small background surfaces.\nIf cells are touching (and therefore surfaces are joined), select the point to be cut using ‘SHIFT + click’, and then separate cells using the ‘cut surface’ IMARIS function (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C).",
    "Export data to an excel file using ‘average values’ in the Details tab (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Fluorescence intensity in the FUNCAT channel per cell can then be extracted from this table and analyzed.\nNote: We suggest only quantifying cells with one nucleus (visualized using DAPI). Phalloidin and FUNCAT fluorescence without DAPI are likely cells that have burst or been lysed during the click chemistry and washing process (these should be very minimal). Cells with multiple nuclei may represent a certain stage in the cell cycle, with potentially altered protein synthesis.\nNote: The excel file will contain quantifications for many parameters. Intensity quantification is provided as mean, max, and sum for each channel.\nCritical: Take note of the channel used for FUNCAT (this information can be found in the Display Adjustment panel), as this is required for obtaining the correct channel fluorescence intensity values from the data output.\nAlternatives: This protocol uses IMARIS to quantify FUNCAT fluorescence, however any program capable of quantifying fluorescence intensity (e.g., FIJI/ImageJ software) can be used with appropriate adjustments.\nFlow cytometry-based quantification of FUNCAT signal\nTiming: Day 1 - 4 h\nTiming: Day 2 - 1 h (for step 48)\nThe following steps describe how to perform fixation and copper (I)-catalyzed click chemistry to visualize newly synthesized proteins using FUNCAT and flow cytometry after AHA-labeling. This protocol is specific for the use of 2 × 6-well plates (i.e., 12 wells in total).\nWarm medium in a 37°C water bath.\nRemove AHA/methionine/anisomycin-containing medium and add pre-warmed fresh medium. For AHA with anisomycin-treated cells, add anisomycin into fresh medium to ensure continued protein synthesis inhibition.\nPlace back in a 37°C incubator for 10 min.\nNote: This 10 min chase with fresh medium is performed to decrease intracellular free AHA and therefore increase signal to noise ratio.",
    "Remove medium and wash briefly once with PBS.\nRemove PBS and add 500 μL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to each well; incubate at 37°C for 3 min.\nCritical: It is essential for all cells to detach from the well surface. For issues with cell detaching, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAdd 500 μL fresh medium to each well; collect total 1 mL cell suspension into respective 1.5 mL tube.
