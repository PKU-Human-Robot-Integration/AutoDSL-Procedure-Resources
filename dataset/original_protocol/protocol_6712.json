    "Mouse Brain Collection and FixationAnesthetize the mouse with an intra-peritoneal injection of Ketamine/Xylazine mix (100 mg/kg Ketamine mixed with 10 mg/kg Xylazine in isotonic saline solution; contact local animal ethical committee for drug use and animal procedures). In our case, all mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with relevant national and international guidelines (European Union rules; 2010/63/UE), and have been approved by the local ethical committee in France (CIEPAL NCE/2014-209 and NCE/2019-548).For postnatal/adult mice, perfuse them intracardially with 4% PFA; for embryonic stages, recover embryos on ice-cold PBS from the uterus of the anesthetized mother.Decapitate adults/embryos and dissect the brains; for early stage embryos (embryonic age < 15.5 days), brain dissection is not mandatory, but highly recommended to reduce background signal on skin and other tissues surrounding the brain.Keep brains in ice-cold PBS in 12-well plates during and after collection.Post-fix brains for 2 h in 4% PFA at 4 °C (gentle agitation on shaker).Wash the brains 3 times for 10 min each in PBS at 4 °C (on shaker).Store brains at 4 °C until further treatment (few days); for long-term storage (few weeks), supplement PBS with 0.05% Sodium Azide.Embedding in Agar for vibratome sectioning (thick sections: 50-200 μm)Prepare a solution of 4% agar in PBS.Boil in the microwave until homogenization.Keep the 4% agar in a water bath at 50 °C.Add 4% agar to a 12-well plate.Remove the brain from PBS with perforated spoon and dry it on a paper towel.Quickly immerge the brain in agar and correctly position it with forceps before agar polymerization.Store the brain at 4 °C for short term or immediately proceed with sectioning.Cutting vibratome thick sectionsTrim the agar surrounding the brain and fix it on the vibratome with glue.",
    "Add ice cold PBS to the vibratome and keep it cold by adding ice around the mould for cutting.Cut 50-200 μm thick sections.Use a brush to gently collect the sections from the vibratome before moving them to a 12-well plate; keep the plate on ice-cold PBS.Create series of sections representing the whole cortex or brain by distributing similar sections on subsequent wells.You can add up to 3-4 sections in each well.Immunostaining on vibratome sections (50-200 μm)Remove the PBS by carefully aspirating it with a pipette tip, without touching the sections (repeat for following passages).Incubate the sections in Blocking solution (10% GS, 3% BSA, 0.3% Triton) over-night (O/N) at 4 °C by adding 1 ml for each well.The following day add 500 μl of primary antibodies by diluting them to the appropriate concentration with the antibody solution (3% GS, 3% BSA, 0.3% Triton).Incubate the sections with primary antibodies O/N at 4 °C.The day after, wash the sections 3 times for 1 h each in PBS, followed by 3 short washes for 10 min each in PBS (all washes are performed at room temperature (RT), on shaker).Prepare secondary antibodies by diluting them to 1/500 in the antibody solution (3% GS, 3% BSA, 0.3% Triton).Incubate the sections with 500 μl of diluted secondary antibodies O/N at 4 °C by shaking.The following day wash the sections in PBS as described in Step D5.Incubate the sections in 1 μg/ml Hoechst in PBS for 1 h.Carefully move the sections using a brush from the wells to a slide covered with PBS.Aspirate the PBS with a pipette tip and let the sections dry.Add 3 drops of mounting solution (80% glycerol, 2% N-propyl gallate, 1 μg/ml Hoechst) to each slide.Cover the slides with cover slips and seal the edges with nail polish.",
    "Leave the nail polish to dry for 5 min at RT.Store the slides until imaging at -20 °C.Cryopreservation and Freezing brains for thin sectioning at the cryostat (thin sections: 10-20 μm)Prepare 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose in PBS.Put the brains (dissected and post-fixed as detailed in Procedure A) in 10% sucrose, keep at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Wait to equilibrate (usually 8-12 h) until they sink to the bottom of the wells.Repeat Step E2 with sucrose 20% and then 30%. Increasing sucrose concentration in a gradual way is key for preserving optimal histology.Remove all sucrose from the brains by shaking them with a Pasteur pipette in OCT in a 6 cm Petri dish.Transfer the brains in OCT in Peel-A-Way® boxes.Snap freeze them on dry ice.Store them at -80 °C until sectioning.Cutting sections at the cryostat (10-20 μm)Equilibrate the brains at -20 °C for 30 min at the cryostat.Cut 20 μm thin sections for postnatal brains and 12-16 μm for embryonic brains.During cutting, collect series of sections on cryostat slides.Let the slides dry O/N at RT.Store them at -80 °C until use.Immunostaining on cryostat sectionsDefreeze the sections for 1 h at RT.Put the slides on a vertical slide box for boiling.If your antibody needs unmasking, boil the slides for 15 s in an unmasking solution (0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6).Boil them a second time for 1 s with fresh unmasking solution (0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6).Cool the sections on ice for 10 min.Move the slides to a vertical slide box for washingWash the sections 3 times in PBS for 10 min each at RT (on shaker).Create a humidified chamber by adding water or PBS in a plastic box where the slides can lay horizontally.",
    "Lay your slides horizontally and avoid the sections to dry by immediately adding the blocking solution (10% GS, 0.3% Triton in PBS).Block the sections in blocking solution for 1 h at RT by adding 1 ml for each slide.Prepare 200-300 μl of primary antibodies for each slide by diluting them to the appropriate concentration with the antibody solution (3% GS, 0.3% Triton in PBS).Add 200-300 μl of the diluted primary antibodies to the slides and cover them with cover slips to homogeneously distribute the antibody.Incubate the sections with primary antibodies (ON at 4 °C).The following day move the slides to the vertical slide box containing PBS.Wash the sections 3 times for 10 min each in PBS at RT while shaking.Prepare 200-300 μl of secondary antibodies per slide by diluting them to 1/300 in the antibody solution (3% GS, 0.3% Triton).Lay the slides horizontally again in the humidified chamber.Add 200-300 μl of the diluted secondary antibodies to the slides and cover them with cover slips to homogeneously distribute the antibody.Incubate the sections for 2 h at RT with diluted secondary antibodies.Move the slides to the vertical slide box containing PBS.Wash the sections 3 times for 10 min each in PBS at RT while shaking.Lay the slides horizontally after taking away extra PBS.Add 3 drops of mounting solution (80% glycerol, 2% N-propyl gallate, 1 μg/ml Hoechst) to each slide.Cover the slides with cover slips and seal the edges with nail polish.Leave the nail polish dry for 5 min at RT.Store the slides at -20 °C until imaging.ImagingTake images of your area and layer of interest with the appropriate magnificationFor thin sections:Acquire plane images with a 10x/20x magnification using a fluorescent optical microscope.For thick sections: Acquire Z-stack images using a confocal microscope.Acquire Z-stack images using a confocal microscope.",
