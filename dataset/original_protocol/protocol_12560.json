    "Euterpe precatoria seeds were kindly donated by the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (Manaus, Brazil), and Euterpe edulis seeds were kindly donated by the Silo - Arte e Latitude Rural (Resende, Brazil) after the industrial depulping process. The seeds were maintained in sealed plastic boxes at room temperature.\n1. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectroscopy (MALDI-IMS)\nSeed sectioning protocol\n\t\nAllow three seeds from each species to sit in deionized water for 24 h.\nThe next day, turn the cryostat (see Table of Materials) on and let it reach -20 °C.\nTake the wet seeds out of the water. Cut the seeds in half using a microtome blade (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare a fresh, warm (10%) gelatin solution (see Table of Materials).\nPlace half of the seed on a mold and fill it with fresh-made gelatin. Freeze at -80 °C for 2 h before taking to the cryostat.\nAttach the embedded seed to the cryostat support using an optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT, see Table of Materials) and leave for 10 min inside the cryostat for OCT hardening.\nAdd copper double-faced adhesive tape (see Table of Materials) to an indium tin oxide-coated glass slide (ITO slide; see Table of Materials).\nProduce 20 µm thick sections from each species and place them on the copper double-faced adhesive tape adhered to the ITO glass slide.\n\t\t​NOTE: At this point, the slices collected on the slides can be stored in a -80 °C freezer; alternatively, proceed to matrix deposition. The slides must be placed in a holder slide box, flushed with gaseous N2, and sealed with film to prevent sample oxidation (see Table of Materials).\nMatrix deposition\n\t\nPlace the slide containing slices in a vacuum desiccator until it reaches room temperature.",
    "Make teaching marks using a correction pen in each slide corner. Scan the slide using a table scanner. Set to the resolution of 4,800 ppi.\nUse an analytical balance to weigh 30 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB; see Table of Materials) and prepare 1 mL of 1:1 methanol:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Table of Materials) solution to dissolve the DHB.\nFill a 1 mL glass syringe (see Table of Materials) with DHB solution and place it in a syringe pump (see Table of Materials) set to a flow rate of 0.8 mL/h.\nUsing PEEK tubing, connect the syringe to an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) needle (see Table of Materials).\nConnect N2 to the APCI needle and set it to a 12.5 psi flow rate.\nAttach the APCI needle to the xy motion platform (see Table of Materials). Ensure that the tip of the APCI needle is 4 cm above the slide.\nUsing the drawing software (see Table of Materials and Supplementary Figure 1), set the xy motion platform to follow the template. The template consists of horizontal parallel lines spaced by 1 mm.\nTo achieve matrix deposition, wait for the xy motion platform to repeat the template 20 times.\n\t\t​CAUTION: Matrix deposition must be carried out in a chemical fume hood.\nImaging acquisition\n\t\nPlace the slide in the mass spectrometer (see Table of Materials).\nUse correction pen marks to set teaching points on the referenced software (see Table of Materials).\nSet the laser power (60%), laser focus (medium), number of shots (100), and polarity in the software (see Table of Materials). Set 99% data reduction factor and save the FID file for posterior data calibration. Save the method.",
    "Delimitate the area to be analyzed using the add polygon measurement region tool from the mass spectrometer software. Edit the measurement region parameters indicating the method saved in the previous step and the raster width to 100 µm (Supplementary Figure S4A).\nStart imaging acquisition.\nData analysis\n\t\nUse matrix cluster and known contaminants to create a mass list in the referenced software (see Table of Materials) in the calibrant tab (Supplementary Figure S4B).\n\t\t\nOpen the data to be calibrated in the referenced software (see Table of Materials). In the calibration tab, open the mass list created and open a dialog box by right-clicking and choose the set lock masses option (Supplementary Figure S4C).\nSelect Gaussian window mode with 0.5 Gaussian broadening and 3.5 Line broadening. Leave online calibration unchecked. Select mode (single), threshold (1,000), and mass tolerance (5 ppm). Calibrate data with process and save the 2D data tool (Supplementary Figure S4C).\nAfter calibration, export the data to SCiLS lab or other compatible software and set the desired m/z value threshold (range chosen: 150 to 2,500).\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the file size or the computer's characteristics, this might take some time.\nChoose a normalization method between total ion count (TIC) or root mean square (RMS).\n\t\tNOTE: For this analysis, TIC was chosen.\nIf the analytes to be mapped are known, plot each m/z value for each analyte and save the generated images and the spectral average plot.\n\t\tNOTE: In this work, m/z values from hexose oligomers were chosen by considering the potassium adduct.\n2. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)\nSeed sectioning protocol\n\t\nAcquire a thin seed slice in a sectioning saw machine (see Table of Materials).\nCut the seeds with the following parameters: 500 RPM cutting speed, 100 N load charge, and 15 HC Diamond Wafering Blade (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: Handle the manual removal of fibers from the seeds due to the necessary adhesion to the hold in the precision vises attached to the goniometer. Clean the blade before use, cutting a section of the seed to prevent adding undesirable minerals during the analysis.\nClear the samples with compressed air to remove all the particle residues from the cut (see Table of Materials).\nFix a seed section in carbon double-sided conductive tape (see Table of Materials) in the support.\nAnalysis conditions\n\t\nAttach the support with a seed section inside the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with EDS (see Table of Materials).\nAcquire electron micrographs on a model microscope with 20 kV acceleration and a spot size of 4.0, using secondary electron signals (see Table of Materials), backscattered electrons (solid state detector fixed on the polar piece), and mixtures of these two types of signals (MIX), building artificially colored images.\nFor the acquisition of EDS spectra, use a spectrometer (see Table of Materials) coupled with the aforementioned SEM. The condition configuration of the image acquisition from EDS is the same as the SEM.\nSet tilt degrees, elevation, and azimuth at 0.0, 35.0, and 0.0, respectively.\nData acquisition\n\t\nSet three different areas with 91x magnification of the seed section to acquire data.\nIdentify the peaks in the spectrum upon termination of acquisition or during acquisition. Use the Confirm Elements step button to identify the peaks manually.\nSet the acquisition time to 60 s for each selected area. Set the process time to five; the parameters are available for a process time of one to six.\n\t\tNOTE: The signs of the elements are constant and add up, while the noises are random and deleterious. The longer the processing time, the lower the noise.",
    "The default settings to display significant quantitative results are above two sigmas (standard deviation). Set two sigmas to zero to reduce undesirable results.\nNormalize each intensity of the elements; this is a standardized parameter in the software (see Table of Materials).\nTo analyze the data, export it in a DOC file.\nData analysis\n\t\nEnsure the accurate measurement of peak intensities for quantitative elemental analysis.\nOverlapping peaks require deconvolution for better peak separation; subtract a noisy background when required.\nWhen there is no overlapping, increase the gain to amplify the signals and improve the spectrum quality.\nSubscription Required.
