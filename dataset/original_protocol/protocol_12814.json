    "1. Traditional Method for Scoring C. elegans Longevity\nPreparation of reagents\nIdentify genes to be inactivated via feeding-based RNAi. Purchase transformed stocks of HT115 E. coli2 containing the RNAi clone of interest. Alternatively, subclone the cDNA of the gene of interest into the multicloning site of the L4440 plasmid.\n\t\tNOTE: HT115 is an RNase III-deficient E. coli strain with IPTG-inducible T7 polymerase activity, which is used to prevent degradation of dsRNA within the bacteria. For lifespan studies that do not use feeding-based RNAi, either HT115 or OP50 E. coli on standard NGM plates can be used.\nPrepare 3–6 (or more) 6 cm RNAi plates per test condition (Supplemental File 3 for recipe). Store RNAi plates at 4 °C before seeding with bacteria for up to several months.\nGrow transformed E. coli overnight (16–20 h, 37 °C shaking incubator at 180–220 RPM).\n\t\tNOTE: HT115 E. coli is grown in LB with ampicillin (50 mg/mL). Standard OP50 E. coli is not antibiotic resistant and is grown without ampicillin. Culture volume depends on the # of plates, but is typically between 8 and 100 mL of LB, depending on the experimental design.\n\t\t\nConcentrate bacteria by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 15–20 min in a benchtop centrifuge. Aspirate the supernatant, and re-suspend the pellet at 1/10th starting volume (i.e. 10x) in LB with ampicillin for HT115 (or without ampicillin for standard OP50).\nAliquot 200 µL of concentrated 10x bacteria to each 6 cm plate. Prepare 3–4 replicates per test condition, with 2 extra backup plates, to be used in case of contamination. When preparing plates, label them so the experimenter scoring the assay is blind to the experimental conditions, using a color code or similar coding scheme. Ensure that the code is recorded.",
    "Allow open plates to dry in a clean environment such as a laminar flow bench until all liquid has been absorbed or allow covered plates to dry on the bench overnight. Monitor plates while drying to ensure that the agar is dry without over-drying.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Over-drying the plates leads to cracking of the agar that will cause C. elegans to burrow into the agar. Wet the agar surfaces also promote burrowing.\nStore dried plates within a worm box overnight (up to 24 h) at room temperature to allow induction of dsRNA production. After 1 day at RT, store plates at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks in a sealed zip-lock bag (to prevent plates from drying out). Before use, return plates to room temperature within the zip-lock bag to prevent condensation from introducing airborne fungal contaminants.\nSynchronization of C. elegans with hypochlorite treatment \n\tNOTE: See Supplemental File 3 for M9 and hypochlorite solution recipes.\n\t\nCollect gravid adult animals with M9. Use a plugged glass pipette to move to 2x 15 mL tubes.\nSpin tubes for 30” at ~2,000 rpm. Check for a pool of at nematodes at the bottom of the tube. Aspirate the supernatant. Wash two times with M9 solution, repeating spin and aspiration.\nRe-suspend C. elegans in 4 mL of M9. Add 2 mL of hypochlorite solution. Immediately vortex for ~3 min, with periodic vigorous shaking. After 3 min, look for a cloud of eggs under a dissecting microscope. Vortex an additional 10–20 s if eggs have not been released after 3 min.",
    "NOTE: Timing the hypochlorite treatment is essential. Eggs within the gravid adults are what survive treatment. After ~3 min the gravid adults break open and the eggs spill out. However, if eggs are in hypochlorite solution too long after release they will die. Conversely, if gravid adults are not left in hypochlorite solution long enough, no eggs will be released.\nQuickly wash with M9 solution twice as in step 2.1.2.\nRe-suspend C. elegans egg pellet in 3 mL M9 and transfer to a new 15 mL tube. Allow embryos to hatch overnight in 3 mL of M9 solution with rotation at 20 °C.\nCalculate the density of L1 animals (or embryos) per µL by dropping 10 µL of L1 solution 3x on a 6 cm plate and count the number of L1 animals to calculate the average number of L1s/µL.\n\t\tNOTE: L1 animals will settle over time. Therefore, L1 solutions should be periodically mixed.\nSeed 50 L1 animals per plate. Invert plates and seal with a rubber band. Place plates in a plastic worm box. Seal box in a large zip-lock bag. Move to a 20 °C incubator.\nPreventing progeny production by the addition of 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) \nGrow animals until L4 stage at 20 °C. Check to see whether synchronized animals have developed to L4 approximately 40 h after seeding (step 2.1.7).\n\t\tNOTE:C. elegans developmental time will vary at different temperatures12 and growth rates of mutant animals for which rates have not been characterized must be empirically tested.\n\t\t\nAdd 160 µL of 50x FUdR to each 6 cm plate with L4 animals.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to add FUdR at the L4 stage. For convenience, make 1,000x stocks of FUdR by dissolving 1 g FUdR into 10 mL ultrapure H2O. Filter-sterilize stock FUdR with a 0.2 µm filter and a 10 cc syringe. Aliquot ~1 mL of stock into sterile 1.5 mL tubes. Freeze and store at -20 °C.\nInspect plates for the presence of male C. elegans. Remove all males.\n\t\tNOTE: Lifespan is typically measured for hermaphrodites and not males. Hermaphrodites that mate live shorter than unmated animals, even in the presence of FUdR13. Males are smaller and thinner then hermaphrodites and can be easily identified by a distinctive hooked tail14.\nPut box back into the zip-lock bag. Return to 20 °C incubator.\nScoring viability\nScore viability daily by gently touching the animal on the head with a platinum wire or eyelash. Score animals that fail to move as dead and remove them from the plate (Figure 2A). Record the number observed dead for each condition for every observation time point.\n\t\tNOTE: To reduce the risk of scoring bias, the experimenter must remain blind to experimental conditions and similarly must not reference the results from previous time points during scoring.\nCensor animals that rupture, die from other obvious development defects, or crawl up on the side of the dish: remove these animals and record the number at each observed time point for consideration in the statistical analysis. Additionally, if males are found, remove them and record the number observed.\nRepeat from step 1.4.1 daily until no animals remain alive.\n\t\tNOTE: Should the lawn of E. coli diminish significantly or fungus begins to grow upon the plate, transfer all remaining animals to a fresh plate with the appropriate RNAi and FUdR.\nData analysis- plotting and statistics",
    "Input or open recorded observation data in software supporting survival analysis with the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator15 and log-rank test16 (See Supplemental File 3). Be sure to include censored animals. Do not include males that were observed, if any.\n\t\tNOTE: Data formats may vary between software, but a common format is to record each individual animal observed on a separate line. The experimental timepoint at which an animal was observed as dead is the “event” time. If censored, the “event” time is the timepoint at which the animal was censored. There is usually a field or checkbox to indicate censored observations.\nPlot Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Select fewer than six conditions for a single plot if many conditions were assayed to improve readability.\n\t\t\nCheck for data issues that are visually apparent- missing observations, unexpected control results, etc. — and address these before statistical analysis.\nUse the log-rank test function in your software to perform pairwise statistical comparisons. Ensure that any available options for treatment of censored results are set appropriately for right-censored data.\n2. Replica Set Method for Scoring C. elegans Longevity\nNOTE: While the traditional method requires 3–6 plates per condition (see 1.1.2. above), the Replica Set method requires many more (see step 2.2.2 below). The traditional method follows animals on the same plate throughout an experiment (Figure 2A). In contrast, with Replica Set animals are only scored once: many identical replicates are set up at the beginning of the experiment so that one replicate is scored at each time point (per trial) (Figure 2B).\nLibrary setup.",
    "NOTE: Additional detail on handing RNAi clones is covered here, as the Replica Set protocol is amenable to the simultaneous scoring of many RNAi clones, and can be scaled to well over 100 clones at a time. Collections of RNAi clones are preserved as glycerol stocks maintained in a 96-well format plate. Replica Set experiments use 24-well plates. Each well is a different test condition, which may correspond to a collection of RNAi clones, different chemical treatments, animal strains, and so forth.\n\t\nAssemble the layout of the sublibrary for collections of RNAi clones, such that the following conditions are met:\n\t\t\nEnsure that within a 96-well collection, well A1 is an empty vector negative control.\nInsert an additional empty vector control randomly within every 24 wells.\nSplit the 96-well plate into blocks of 24 wells, such that each 24-well plate has at one randomly inserted negative control (Figure 2C).\nInsert a positive control randomly within every group of 24-wells (Figure 2C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The positive control is dependent on the experimental question. For example, when looking at a collection of RNAi clones that increase lifespan, daf-2(RNAi) is frequently included. Conversely, when looking at shortened lifespan, daf-16(RNAi) is frequently used. \nPreparation of replica sets\n\tNOTE: The number of replicates needed is equal to the minimum number of time points (Figure 2B). One must know a posteriori how long to measure lifespan prior to the start of the experiment, as well as scoring frequency (e.g. a replica set experiment running 40 days with every other day scoring requires preparing a minimum of 20 replica sets for each condition at the start of the experiment). It is advisable to make ~5 extra backup sets (see 2.2.2 and 2.2.2.3 below).",
    "To create a fresh stamp of the RNAi sublibrary, inoculate 200 µL LB+Amp per well in a 96-well format (600 µL plates) using a 96-pin plate replicator by the following steps:\n\t\t\nSterilize 96 pin plate replicator by sequentially immersing the pins in 50% bleach, ultrapure H2O, and ethanol. Keep the pins immersed for at least 30 s for the bleach and ethanol steps.  After immersion in ethanol, flame the tips briefly. Repeat.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be sure to rinse off all bleach, and do not leave the pins exposed to bleach for extended periods, as bleach can corrode the stainless-steel pins.\nCarefully remove adhesive foil cover from frozen 96-well glycerol stock library plate and gently but firmly grind tips of the sterilized plate replicator into the wells of the still frozen glycerol stocks. Inoculate 200 µL LB + Amp cultures and seal the inoculated plate with a permeable membrane. Allow cultures to grow overnight on the benchtop.\nSterilize the plate replicator as in step 2.1.1, carefully remove the seal from the liquid culture plate after overnight growth and immerse tips of the replicator pins. Apply the tips with even pressure to a rectangular LB amp+tet agar plate, and transfer bacteria from the pins to the plate gently with a small circular motion, ensuring that adequate space is left between adjacent spots. Allow colonies to grow overnight on the agar plate at 37 °C. See Supplemental File 3 for preparation of LB + Amp/Tet plates.\nPrior to use, store agar plate at 4 °C inverted (lid side down), wrapped in paraffin film.",
    "NOTE: Storing colonies lid side up will allow condensation to cross-contaminate RNAi clones! Colonies of E. coli can be stored for 2–8 weeks at 4 °C, depending on particular RNAi clones, as RNAi clones retain efficacy in inducing dsRNA after IPTG induction for variable lengths of time. For small collections of RNAi clones, RNAi efficiency should be empirically determined by RT-qPCR to confirm knockdown. \nCalculate the minimum number of 24-well plates necessary for one trial of the experiment: (# plates per replica set) x (expected # time points). Ensure that a few extra replica sets are included for handling issues such as contamination (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: The total number of RNAi clones determine the number of 24-well plates to make one set of replicas for each time point (Figure 2C).\n\t\t\nPrepare 24-well plates, as step 1.1.2 (Supplemental File 3 for recipe). Label plates when preparing them so the experimenter scoring the assay will be blind to the experimental conditions, using a color code or similar coding scheme.\nInoculate one set of 1.5 mL LB + Amp cultures for every 10 replicas (see 2.2.2). Inoculate cultures in 96 well deep-well plates using the plate replicator (as in 2.1.3) and bacterial colonies from 2.1.4 (Figure 2C, left). Seal with breathable membrane, grow 20 h ( 37 °C) with shaking.\nSeed 120 µL of an overnight culture to each plate using a 6-well multichannel pipette with adjustable tip spacing (Figure 2C, right). Dry plates uncovered in a laminar flow hood until all liquid has been absorbed. Do not over-dry. Store plates overnight at room temperature.\nSynchronization of C. elegans using hypochlorite treatment \nCalculate the minimum number of animals needed for the experiment: minimum # of L1s needed = (15-20 animals/well)(24 wells/plate)(X plates/replica set)(Y replica sets).",
    "NOTE: The Replica Set method requires more animals than the traditional method. One 10 cm plate full of gravid worms can provide 20,000–50,000 L1 animals depending on the density of gravid adults. Similarly, twenty 6 cm plates yield around ~30,000 L1 animals. Plan to prepare an egg preparation that doubles the minimum number of animals needed. If the population in preparation has starved, re-feed or chunk to a new plate and allow at least three generations on food before proceding17,18. Be sure to freeze back leftover L1s.\nFollow steps 1.2 to 1.2.6  as in the traditional method to obtain synchronized L1 animals. Seed 15–20 L1 animals into each well using a 6-well adjustable-spacing pipette and reagent reservoir, similar to 1.2.7. Periodically mix L1 solution prevent settling of animals.\nPrevention of progeny production by the addition of 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR)\nFollow step 1.3.1.  Prepare sterile 50x FUdR stock (see step 1.3.1.1).\nWhen animals reach L4, add 25 µL of 50x FUDR to each well of a 24-well plate using a 6-channel adjustable-spacing pipette.\nScore viability\nRemove one set of replicate plates and flood wells with the M9 solution, record total animals per well, and then gently touch non-moving animals on the head with a worm pick (Figure 2B). Animals failing to move are scored as dead. Discard scored plates. Record viability daily.\n\t\tNOTE:  Animals that rupture, show gross morphological defects, failed to develop, or crawled up on the side of the well are to be censored by excluding them from both the dead and total values.\n\t\t\nRecord the number of animals that are censored within each well at each time point separately from the other values.",
    "Do not score wells that do not have food or are contaminated (e.g. fungus or slime); such wells are considered censored. Also, censor a well if all of the animals display morphological or developmental defects. Record the censoring event for this RNAi clone/well at this time point.\nAfter scoring a replicate plate, discard it. Continue scoring a new replicate set each day until all animals across all wells are dead. To reduce the risk of scoring bias, the experimenter must remain blind to experimental conditions and similarly must not reference the results from previous time points during scoring.\nIf all animals within a well were dead at a given time point, then after that day’s scoring, examine whether all animals have been scored as dead for two consecutive time points for a given well. If so, scoring viability is no longer needed for that well in subsequent time points.\nConduct additional independent experiment trials. Track the results of successive trials separately from those in previous trials, with the trial number noted.\n3. Graph Data\nNOTE: With the Replica Set method a curve fit is applied to approximate the mean and maximum lifespan. The parameters for assessing C. elegans mortality fit a logit curve19.  As most survival tools do not support logit curve fitting, a new program was developed for plotting logit curves (for Replica Set); Kaplan-Meier curves (for the traditional method) are also supported.\nGet started with the software. Download the release zip file for the current version (See Materials Section). Extract the zip file to a folder. See the \"readme\" file in the extracted folder for additional installation instructions.\nStart the plotting interface. Find the location of the \"code\" directory in the folder extracted from the zip file (e.g.  “/Users/UserName /Desktop/WormLife/code”).",
    "Enter the following commands in the R console, substituting for the folder path just identified. Press enter or return after each entered line: 1) setwd(“/Users/UserName/Desktop/WormLife/code”), 2) source(“plotGUI.R”), 3) openMain().\nAllow time for the interface to load in a new window, bringing up the default screen as shown in Figure 3A. Let the R run in the background.\nFormat data as comma-separated value (CSV) or tab-separated value (TSV) files. Specify columns and names, dependent on the type of analysis. See Supplemental File 4 (Replica Set) and Supplemental File 5 (traditional/Kaplan-Meier) for pre-formatted example data.\n\tNOTE: Data must be specified in a \"long\" format, i.e. one row per strain/treatment per time point per trial. CSV files are recommended for best compatibility between platforms.\n\t\nRemove rows corresponding to observations that were skipped or censored. Check for the absence of missing or non-numeric values, as it may result in an error when the data is imported.\nFor traditional Kaplan-Meier style analysis, do not pool data from independent trials- plot them separately. For Replica Set analysis, pool data from multiple trials, and then investigate using the \"TrialView\" functionality (see 6.3.3.4).\nUsing the plotting interface\nLoad a data file (\"import\" under the \"File\" menu) using the dialog box. To open \".csv\" files, change the file type in the drop down to \".csv\" (the default is “.txt/.tsv”), navigate to the folder with the data file. Here the file is the Replica Set example data (Supplemental File 4).\n\t\tNOTE: Importing a file when a dataset is already open will replace the current dataset.\nSelect a file to import to start the import wizard, which walks through identifying the columns of the selected file (Figure S1A for Replica Set). If the input data corresponds to a replica-set experiment, choose \"Logit\" for study type.",
    "NOTE: The import workflow is different between Replica Set (Figure S1A) and traditional (Kaplan-Meier) (Figure S1B).\n\"Plot data\". Select “Add Line” to begin plotting data. (A line corresponds to one set of conditions. There are features to help with experiments where many conditions were tested).\n\t\t\nPlot the control conditions- in the case of the example data N2 (WT) with L4440 (empty vector) RNAi are appropriate. Select \"Add Line\" under the \"Graphs\" menu to initiate the Add Line wizard: select the condition to plot and the graphical parameters for representing the line.\n\t\t\t\nTo add a curve for a different condition manually, repeat the steps in 3.3.3.1\nTo change color or plot symbol for a line, select \"Modify Line\" under the \"Graph menu\".\nTo remove a line without clearing all lines, select \"Delete Line\" under the \"Graph menu\".\nTo clear all lines in the current plot, select \"Clear Line\" under the \"Graph menu\".\nTo override the automatically selected maximum x-axis (time) value, use \"Set X scale\" under the \"Graph menu\".\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The y-axis (surviving fraction) always displays 100% (top) to 0% (bottom) in increments of 20%. The x-axis is always displayed in increments of 5. Axis labels are not plotted to enable flexibility in labeling after saving plot images.\nTo save JPEG-format images of the currently displayed plot, use the \"Save Plot\" option in the \"File menu\"; only the current plot is saved.\nFor creating individual plots for many different conditions in one experiment, the software allows defining and plotting a \"series\".\n\t\t\tNOTE: The implementation of the series concept improves efficiency when working with large experiments.\n\t\t\t\nIf starting with a blank plot workspace, add lines corresponding to control conditions that are to be consistent across all plots in the series (see 3.3.3.1).",
    "Define the series with “Define Series” in the Graphs menu. Select a condition corresponding to the line to display first in the series; only one can be selected. Choose graphical parameters (line color and plot symbol) for the line, as in 3.3.3.1.\nReview the plots for the different test conditions. Switch the display of the “series line” between conditions using the left/right arrow buttons found on the sides of the main plot window as well as in the top menu bar (Figure 3A-C).\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: If the selected series line is the same condition as one of the previously added control/reference lines, the new line may appear overlaid.\nDefine the series to make certain other functions available (Save Series Plots and Trialview- see 3.3.3.4 for the latter). After defining a series, use the “Save Series Plots” option from the “File” menu to save individual plot image files for each plot in the series in a new folder.\nTrialview — visualizing results from independent trials of a Replica Set experiment. If multiple trials were run for one or more of the sample groups, plot the data from the individual trials and the pooled data from all trials separately to evaluate the consistency between independent trials (See Figure 3D).\n\t\t\t\nSet up a series as described in 3.3.3.3. The different trials will be plotted for each of the “varying” sample groups in a different image over the respective trials for the specified reference/control samples.\nTo save the TrialView images, go to \"Print TrialViews\" in the Data menu; a JPEG image will be output for each plot in the series.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The example results in Figure 3D is for a case with two trials.",

Visually inspect curves to ensure reasonable fit of the data, then select the \"Summary Table\" option in the Data menu to save a table of median lifespan values (time at 50% survival on logit curve) for each sample type. \nStatistical evaluation of data generated via the Replica Set method\nFor statistical analysis between two groups from a Replica Set experiment, modify and run an R script, provided in the release zip file (see “WormLife statistical analysis template script.R”).\n\t\tNOTE: Proficiency in R is not required to run the script. Additional documentation is in comments in the file. The script is ready for analysis of the example Replica Set data. User-generated data in the appropriate format (see Supplemental File 4) can also be analyzed.\n\t\t\nOpen the script file in R (R GUI or RStudio).\n\t\t\tNOTE: This will display the script without running it.\nModify the locations of necessary files to match the location on your computer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These file paths must be \"fully qualified\" (i.e. should include the complete file location, including folders).\n\t\t\t\nModify the paths (file/folder locations) for \"wlDir\" (location of the directory), \"dataFile\" (the Replica Set data file to analyze), \"compFile\" (specification of comparisons to run, if applicable), and \"outputPath\" (location where result files will be written to).\nSet the column names in the \"Specify columns in data file\" section if column names in the file to be analyzed are different from the example file.
