    "The Multiple Integration Element \\(MIE) was derived from a polylinker<sup>4</sup> and allows for several approaches for multigene assembly. Single or multiple genes can be inserted into the MIE of any of the ACEMBL vectors by a variety of methods. For this, the vector needs to be linearized, which can be carried out efficiently by PCR reaction with appropriate primers, since the vectors are all small \\(2-2.6 kb). Alternatively, if more conventional approaches are preferred i.e. in a regular wet lab setting without robotics, the vectors can also be linearized by restriction digestion, and a gene of interest can be pasted in by ligation. The following protocols describe these approaches in detail.\n**Single gene insertion into the MIE by SLIC** \n1. Primer design\n  \nDesign primers for the SLIC procedure containing the regions of homology which result in the long sticky ends upon treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the absence of dNTPs<sup>3</sup>:\nPrimers for the insert contain a DNA sequence corresponding to this region of homology \\(adaptor sequence), followed by a sequence which specifically anneals to the insert to be amplified. Useful adaptor sequences for SLIC can be taken directly from the ACEMBL Manual deposited at the EMBL Grenoble homepage: \"http://www.embl.fr/research/services/berger/ACEMBL.pdf\":http://www.embl.fr/research/services/berger/ACEMBL.pdf.\nIn case the gene of interest is amplified from a vector already containing expression elements \\(e.g. the pET vector series), the &#x201C;insert specific sequence&#x201D; can be located upstream of a ribosome binding site \\(rbs). Otherwise, the forward primer needs to be designed such that a ribosome binding site is also provided in the final construct.\nPrimers for PCR linearization of the vector backbone are simply complementary to the two adaptor sequences present in the primer pair chosen for insert amplification.\n2.

Primer design\n  \nFor conventional cloning, if the gene of interest is to be PCR amplified, design PCR primers containing chosen restriction sites, preceded by appropriate overhangs for efficient restriction digestion \\(c.f. New England Biolabs catalogue). This region is followed by &#x2265; 20 nucleotides overlapping with the gene of interest that is to be inserted.\nMIEs are identical in all the ACEMBL vectors. They contain a ribosome binding site preceding the NdeI site. Therefore, for single gene insertions, a ribosome binding site \\(rbs) does not need to be included in the forward primer. \nIn case multigene insertions are planned, primers need to be designed such that a rbs is at the beginning of the gene and a stop codon at its end. Therefore, in particular for polycistron cloning by restriction/ligation, it is recommended to construct templates by custom gene synthesis. In this process, the restriction sites present in the MIE can be eliminated from the encoding DNAs. \n2.

    "Culture plasmids and select correct clones based on specific restriction digestion and DNA sequencing of the inserts.\n**Note:** One can likewise perform the integration by sequence and ligation independent cloning \\(SLIC). It is recommended to carry out linearization of the vector by digestion with HE, if heterologous genes are already present, to avoid PCR amplification over encoding regions. The fragment to be inserted is generated by PCR amplification resulting in a PCR fragment containing a 20-25 base pair stretch at its 5&#x2019; end that is identical to the corresponding DNA sequence present at the HE site counted from the site of cleavage towards 5&#x2019; \\(site of cleavage is position -4).

The LoxP site itself is comprised of two 13 bp recombinase-binding elements arranged as inverted repeats flanking an 8 bp central region where cleavage and ligation reaction occur. As all ACEMBL plasmids contain a single LoxP site, they can be fused in a _Cre_-dependent reaction.

Optional: load 2-5 &#xB5;l of the reaction on an analytical agarose gel for examination. \n  \n**Note:** Heat inactivation at 70 &#xB0;C for 10 minutes before the gel loading is strongly recommended.\n4. For chemical transformation, mix 10-15 &#xB5;l De-Cre reaction with 200 &#xB5;l chemical competent cells. Incubate the mixture on ice for 15-30 minutes. Then perform heat shock at 42 &#xB0;C for 45-60 seconds.\n  \n**Note:** Up to 20 &#xB5;l De-Cre reaction \\(10% of total volume of transformation reaction) can be directly transformed into 200 &#xB5;l chemical competent cells. For electrotransformation, up to 2 &#xB5;l De-Cre reaction could be directly mixed with 100 &#xB5;l electrocompetent cells, and transformed by using an electroporator \\(e.g. BIORAD _E. coli_ Pulser) at 1.8-2.0 kV.\n**Note:** Larger volume of De-Cre reaction must be desalted by ethanol precipitation or PCR purification column before electrotransformation. The desalted De-Cre reaction mix should not exceed 10% of the volume of the electrocompetent cell suspension. \nThe cell/DNA mixture could be immediately used for electro-transformation without prior incubation on ice.\n5. Add up to 400 &#xB5;l of LB media \\(or SOC media) per 100 &#xB5;l of cell/DNA suspension immediately after the transformation \\(heat shock or electroporation). \n  \n6. Incubate the suspension in a 37 &#xB0;C shaking incubator \\(recovery).\n  \n**Note:** For recovery of partially deconstructed double/triple fusions, incubate the suspension in a 37 &#xB0;C shaking incubator overnight or for at least 4 hours.",
    "For recovery of individual educts such as single ACEMBL vectors from pACKS plasmid, incubate the suspension in a 37 &#xB0;C shaking incubator \\(1-2 h).\n7. Plate out the recovered cell suspension on agar containing the desired \\(combination of) antibiotic\\(s). Incubate at 37 &#xB0;C overnight.\n  \n**TROUBLESHOOTING**\n8. Colonies after overnight incubation might be verified directly by restriction digestion at this stage \\(refer to steps 12-16).\n  \n**Note:** Especially recommended in the case that only one single educt or partially deconstructed multifusion plasmid is desired.\nFor further selection by single antibiotic challenge on a 96 well microtiter plate, continue with step 9.\n**Note:** Several different single educts/partially deconstructed multifusion plasmids can be processed and selected on one 96 well microtiter plate in parallel.\n9. For 96 well microtiter plate analysis inoculate four colonies each from agar plates containing a defined set of antibiotics into ~500 &#xB5;l LB media without antibiotics. Incubate the cell cultures in a 37 &#xB0;C shaking incubator \\(1-2 h).\n  \n10. During the incubation of colonies, fill a 96 well microtiter plate with 150 &#xB5;l antibiotic-containing LB media or coloured dye \\(positional marker) in the corresponding wells \\(**Fig. 2**).\n   \n**Note:** Compare **Figure 2** as well as the ACEMBL Manual: \"http://www.embl.fr/research/services/berger/ACEMBL.pdf\":http://www.embl.fr/research/services/berger/ACEMBL.pdf for the arrangement of the solutions in the wells, which are used for parallel selection of single educts or partially deconstructed multifusion plasmids. The concept is that every cell suspension from a single colony needs to be challenged by all four antibiotics separately for unambiguous interpretation.\n11. Add 1 &#xB5;l aliquots from the pre-incubated cell cultures \\(step 9) into the corresponding wells. Then incubate the 96 well microtiter plate in a 37 &#xB0;C shaking incubator overnight at 180-200 rpm. \n  \n**Recommended:** Use parafilm to wrap the plate to prevent dehydration.",
    "The remainder of the pre-incubated cell cultures can be kept in 4&#xB0;C fridge for further inoculation if necessary.\n12. Select transformants containing desired single educts or partially deconstructed multifusion plasmids according to the combination of dense \\(growth) and clear \\(no growth) cell cultures from each colony. Inoculate 10-20 &#xB5;l cell cultures into 10 ml LB media with corresponding antibiotic\\(s). Incubate in a 37 &#xB0;C shaking incubator overnight.\n  \n13. Centrifuge the overnight cell cultures at 4000 g for 5-10 minutes. Purify plasmid from cell pellets. \n  \n14. Determine the concentration of purified plasmid solutions by using UV absorption spectroscopy \\(e.g. NanoDropTM 1000). \n  \n15. Digest 0.5-1 &#xB5;g of the purified plasmid solution in a 20 &#xB5;l restriction digestion \\(with 5-10 unit endonuclease). Incubate under recommended reaction condition for ~2 hours. \n  \n16. Use 5-10 &#xB5;l of the digestion for analytical agarose gel \\(0.8-1.2 %) electrophoresis. Verify the plasmid integrity by comparing the actual restriction pattern to predicted restriction pattern in silico \\(e.g. by using VectorNTI, Invitrogen, or any other similar program).\n  \n17. Optional: Possibly, a deconstruction reaction is not complete but yields partially deconstructed fusions which still retain entities to be eliminated. In this case, we recommend to pick these partially deconstructed fusions containing and perform a second round of _Cre_ deconstruction reaction \\(repeat steps 1-8) by using this construct as starting material.\n  \n**Note:** In our hands, two sequential deconstruction reactions were always sufficient to recover all individual modules."
