Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] provides an overview of the procedures. Please note: the separation buffer, cell culture water and 10× DPBS will need to be chilled to 4°C before commencing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3158-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram showing the general processes in derivation of human monocyte-derived macrophages\nIsolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells using density centrifugation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nEmpty 50 mL of buffy coat blood into a square 100 mm Sterilin dish.\nAdd 50 mL DPBS (1:1 dilution with blood), swirl to mix.\nAdd 15 mL Lymphoprep to each of four 50 mL SepMate PBMC Isolation Tubes.\nNote: SepMate tubes help to minimize the potential mixing between the Lymphoprep and blood layers during addition and centrifugation. These tubes are optional. A normal sterile 50 mL conical tube can also be used without compromising the experimental outcome. If smaller 15 mL conical/SepMate tubes are used instead, the volumes of blood and Lymphoprep should be reduced accordingly.\nGently layer 25 mL of blood/PBS mix onto Lymphoprep. Minimize any mixing between the blood and Lymphoprep layers.\nNote: This is best achieved using the gravity mode of an electric pipettor and leaning the serological pipet at an angle).\nTransfer the SepMate tubes into a suitable centrifuge that allows for adjustable speeds (e.g., Beckman Coulter Allegra X-30 Benchtop Centrifuge).\nCentrifuge (800   ×   g) at 20°C–25°C for 30 min, with deceleration set to “Off” or “Slow”.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3158-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Density centrifugation separates the buffy coat blood into distinct layers\nNote: If a normal sterile conical tube is used instead of the SepMate tubes, the deceleration break must be set to “Off”.",
    "Note: After centrifuging, the blood samples will separate into distinct layers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nRemove the top plasma layer (∼12 mL) and discard, be careful not to disturb the white blood cell (peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC) layer.\nTransfer and combine the PBMC layers (from 4 SepMate tubes) into two sterile 50 mL conical tubes.\nNote: Avoid collecting the “red” layer as much as possible).\nWash the cell by adding ice-cold cell culture water to the 45 mL mark, invert to mix continuously for 1 min.\nNote: This will enable hypotonic lysis of contaminating red blood cells.\nQuickly add 5 mL cold 10× DPBS and mix to restore tonicity.\nCentrifuge at 800   ×   g (10 min, 20°C–25°C).\nCarefully pour off supernatant and discard.\nRepeat Step i to l 2–3 times until no more red blood cells are visible in the pellet.\nIsolate CD14+ monocytes using magnetic separation.\nResuspend the cell pellet (in each of the 2 conical tubes) in 2.5 mL cold Separation Buffer\nBreak the cell pellet as much as possible by gently pipetting up and down.\nCombine the resuspended cell pellets (5 mL in total).\nPass the combined cells through a cell strainer (40 μm) placed over a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd a further of 10 mL Separation buffer to wash the filter for maximum cell recovery.\nCount cells using a hemacytometer or automatic cell counter (e.g., LUNA-II Automated Cell Counter by Logos Biosystems).\nTotal cell number = cell concentration (per mL)   ×   5 mL.\nDetermine the following volumes required:\nSeparation buffer volume: 80 μL/107 cells.\nCD14 microbeads volume: 20 μL/107 cells.\nCentrifuge cells (800   ×   g) at 20°C–25°C for 6 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in calculated volume of the separation buffer (from 2.h(i)).",
    "To the cell solution, add the required volume of CD14 microbeads (from 2.h(ii)) (under dimmed lighting).\nCover the cell tubes with aluminum foil and incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nWhile waiting, set up a MACS separator.\nNote: Different MACS separators are available from the supplier with variable throughput (refer to manufacturer’s instructions for separator specific protocols).\nUsing MidiMACS as an example, insert a LS column into a MACS separator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3158-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Set up of MACS separation using a MidiMACS Separator from Miltenyi Biotec\nNote: Ensuring the column is vertical and pushed in all the way.\nFollowing 15 min incubation, add 30 mL of Separation Buffer to the conical tube containing labeled cells.\nGently pipette up and down to wash the cells.\nCentrifuge cells (800   ×   g) at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nWhile waiting, prime the LS column using 3 mL of separation buffer.\nNote: A beaker/empty conical tube can be placed beneath the column to catch the flow-through.\nAfter centrifugation, resuspend the cell pellet in Separation Buffer (500 μL per 108 cells, based on the counting result from 2.g).\nNote: Any cell clump can be removed by passing the cell solution through another 40 μm cell strainer. This is a necessary for samples with high cell numbers. Cell clumps can lead to blockade of LS columns.\nLoad the cell solution to the LS column. Any CD14+ cells will bind to the column, while the remaining cells will flow through.\nNote: According to the manufacturer’s specification (https://static.miltenyibiotec.com/asset/150655405641/document_5be6o7abnt1kd79gscorsrvd2t?content-disposition=inline[href=https://static.miltenyibiotec.com/asset/150655405641/document_5be6o7abnt1kd79gscorsrvd2t?content-disposition=inline]), a maximum number of 108 labeled cells in up to 2 × 109 total cells can be handled by each column.\nAfter all the cell solutions have flowed through, add 3 mL Separation Buffer to the column to wash the column.",
    "Repeat the wash two more times to remove any residual non-CD14+ cells.\nFor elution, detach column from magnet and place over a clean sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 5 mL of separation buffer; attach the column plunger (included) to the column and firmly apply to immediately flush out labeled cells.\nCount cells using a hemacytometer or automatic cell counter to determine the total cell number.\nNote: Trypan blue dye exclusion can be used to assess cell viability. However, some reversible membrane damage may result from the centrifugation and separation process, resulting in cells stained with trypan blue, despite remaining viable.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] As such, the number of viable cells may be under-estimated.\nDifferentiate human CD14+ monocytes in culture into monocyte-derived macrophages.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging (800 × g, 5 min, 20°C–25°C).\nResuspend cells (∼1.2 × 106/ mL) in complete IMDM medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 15 ng/mL rhM-CSF).\nAdd cell solution to sterile 100 mm square Petri dishes (12 mL per dish). An approximate number of 1.2–1.5 × 107 can be added to each dish.\nNote: The seeding density can be adjusted based on the differentiation outcome.\nTransfer the dishes to a cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) and culture for 7 days.\nNote: No medium change or supplementation is required during this period. However, if the culture medium is turning visibly acidic (in the later stages of differentiation, day 5–7), add additional fresh complete medium containing 15 ng/mL rhM-CSF (3 mL per dish).\nHarvesting of human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs).\nHarvest the cells when most of the cells attach to the plate (ranging from Day 5 to Day 7 post seeding).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3158-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of differentiated human macrophages from two separate donors",
    "A clear difference in cell morphology can be seen between donors (inverted microscopy, 10×). Scale bars represent 20 μm.\nNote: Upon differentiation, HMDMs increase in size and display an irregular (“fried-egg”) morphology and adhere to the dish. This can be observed from Day 3 and continue up to Day 7. The rate of differentiation and the cell morphology varies between individuals, and significant variations in morphology are often expected between donors (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The efficiency of differentiation varies between donors. In general, we obtain an efficiency between 30%-50% of plated cell number.\nTo harvest HMDMs, aspirate the medium containing non-adherent cells, and then gently add DPBS (5 mL/dish) to wash the adherent macrophages.\nUpon removing DPBS, add 5 mL/dish complete IMDM medium (without rhM-CSF).\nGently lift the cells using a cell scraper.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a sterile 50 mL conical tube, then add a further 5 mL to the dish to wash the residual cells off the dish.\nMix the cell solution by pipetting up and down, and then perform a cell count using a hemacytometer or automatic cell counter.\nNote: Once differentiated, we recommend harvesting the cells and using them for experiments within 3 days. Prolonged culture will reduce cell viability and cause changes in cell morphology and potentially function.\nAlternative: Culturing of transfected CHO cells stably expressing human C3aR or C5aR1\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the general culture and maintenance of commercially sourced CHO cells stably expressing human C5aR1 (CHO-C5aR1) or C3aR (CHO-C3aR).\nMaintain CHO cells (both CHO-C3aR and CHO-C5aR2) in complete Ham’s F-12 medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 400 μg/mL G418) in T75 or T175 cell culture flasks.\nPassage the cells routinely when they reach 80%–90% confluency.",
    "Note: In general, for both CHO-C5aR1 and CHO-C3aR, perform a 1:5 passage every two days or 1:10 passage every 3 days.\nThe general procedure of cell passage in a T75 flask is as follows:\nRemove cell medium by aspirating.\nAdd 4 mL DPBS to gently wash the cells, discard.\nAdd 4 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Incubate the flask at 20°C–25°C for 5 min to detach the cells.\nAfter incubation, add 6 mL of complete F-12 medium to neutralize the trypsin\nNote: the FBS in the medium will stop Trypsin from further action)\nTransfer 2 mL of the cell mixture to a new T75 flask containing 10 mL fresh F-12 medium (i.e., 1:5 split). The remaining (8 mL) cell solution can be discarded or seeded into microplates for assays.\nNote: G418 is used as a selection antibiotic to maintain C3aR and C5aR1 expression in CHO cells. The identity of the required antibiotic varies between expression plasmids and systems (check with the manufacturer for specifics). If the cells are to be seeded for assays with no passaging required, after Step 3.d., the cell solution can be counted using a hemacytometer or automatic cell counter and used.\nSeeding of CHO cells or HMDMs for assays\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nThis step describes seeding cells into 96-well microplates for assay.\nUsing cell solutions obtained in the above sections (refer to HMDMs—Step 4.f., CHO cells—Step 3.d), perform a cell count using a hemacytometer or automated cell counter (with trypan blue dye exclusion to account for viable cells only). Then, pellet the cells by centrifugation (400 × g, 20°C–25°C, 5 min).\nResuspend the cell pellet in complete F-12 medium (for CHO cells) or complete IMDM medium (for HMDMs, supplemented 15 ng/mL rhM-CSF).",
    "We recommend using the following cell concentrations for plating: 500,000 cells/ mL for HMDMs, 400,000 cells/ mL for CHO-C5aR1 and 500,000 cells/ mL for CHO-C3aR.\nUse a multichannel pipette to transfer 100 μL cells/ well into a tissue-treated clear-bottom 96-well plate. This will give a final concentration of 50,000 cells/ well for CHO-C3aR and HMDMs, and 40,000 cells/well for CHO-C5aR1.\nNote: The optimal seeding density varies between cell types and will need to be optimized. In general, for an immortal dividing cell line, seeding cells at full confluency encourages contact inhibition, helps to dampen background ERK signaling and thus reduces well-to-well variations.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h for the cells to settle.\nSerum starvation of seeded HMDMs or CHO cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes serum starvation of seeded cells (CHOs or HMDMs).\nAfter the cells have adhered to the plate, use a multichannel pipette or vacuum aspirator to gently remove the complete culture medium, avoiding disturbing the cell monolayer.\nAdd 100 μL per well of serum-free IMDM (for HMDM) or F-12 (for CHO-C5aR1/C3aR). No additional supplements are required for these media.\nIncubate at 37°C/5% CO2 for 8–16 h.\nNote: Serum starvation helps to reduce background ERK signaling and reduce potential interference by other proteins in the serum. The optimal duration of serum starvation will need to be empirically determined for each cell type. In general, a serum-starvation duration of 6–18 h is effective for most cell types. A minimum duration of 4-h starvation can be used for HMDMs and CHO cells. As a longer seeding + starvation time may also increase well-to-well variation due to possible edge effects and differential cell proliferation (for CHO cells),5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] we do not recommend keeping cells in serum-free medium for longer than 24 hrs.\nPerforming the pharmacological assay",
    "Timing: 30 min to 1.5 h\nThis section describes the general steps involved in performing the pharmacological assay. This includes preparation of ligand dilutions, pre-treatment with inhibitors, stimulation with agonists and cell lysate preparation. The overall assay scheme is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3158-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram showing the general procedure of AlphaLISA SureFire Ultra p-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) assay conducted in adherent cells\nImportantly, this protocol describes the general procedure only of ligand testing using the phospho-ERK1/2 assay; the specific ligands used will depend on the specific aim of the experiment: whether it is conducted in CHO-C3aR/C5aR1 or HMDMs, to test for agonists or antagonists.\nDetermine the suitable agonist/antagonist to be used for the assay.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3158_4.csv\nNote: Human C5aR1 and C3aR demonstrate high degree of structural similarity and ligand promiscuity,13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] as such, we recommend all potential hits for human C5aR1 to be counter-screened against human C3aR and vice versa. This test should be performed first prior to other more comprehensive selectivity screens.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3158_5.csv\nNote: Alternative specific C5aR1 inhibitors (e.g., Avacopan, PMX205, JPE-1375, etc.) can also be used. A list of potent and commonly used C5aR1 inhibitors can be found in our previous publication1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and the IUPHAR/BPS Complement Peptide Receptor Guide to Pharmacology database.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] SB290157 is the only commercially-available C3aR inhibitor and has acknowledged off-target activity,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] however, in HMDMs at this concentration, it acts as a full-antagonist for C3aR.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]",
    "Note: We have successfully utilized this assay to a wide range of ligands to measure agonist/antagonistic activities on CHO-C5aR1, CHO-C3aR and HMDMs, among others. The details can be found in our prior publications.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Based on our work, we recommend the following ligand concentrations and treatment schemes in CHO cell lines (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Any hits can then be progressed for validation in HMDMs. However, HMDMs express a multitude of receptors (both C3aR and C5aR1, among others). As such, it is important to verify in HMDMs, whether the induced ERK signaling is driven through the receptor of interest, like C5aR1 or C3aR (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nPrepare ligand dilutions and set up a source plate.\nWarm up the dilution buffer (for CHO cells: serum-free F-12 + 0.1% BSA; for HMDMs: IMDM + 0.1% BSA), which is used to prepare serial dilutions for all ligands.\nNote: 0.1% BSA is added to the diluent as a stabilizer, which helps to minimize ligand loss due to nonspecific binding to the microplate (this is especially important for C3a and C5a). The requirement of additional stabilizer varies depending on testing ligands. 0.5% gelatin can also be used in place of BSA.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nPrepare all ligands at the final concentration (1×) to be added to the cells.\nNote: For a 96-well plate, triplicates of 50 μL/well is typically used for the assay. Taking into account the dead volume, we recommend having at least 180 μL per concentration/condition.\nIf required, prepare serial dilutions for the test ligands.\nNote: For example, prepare a working solution of 10 μM as the highest concentration, and then serially dilute 1/10 by sequentially transferring 20 μL of ligand solution to 180 μL of diluent for the next concentration. Pipette up and down to mix well following each transfer.",
    "Note: The highest concentration of ligand tested will need to be adjusted based on the ligand solubility and maximum DMSO content allowed (Refer to “Preparation of compounds for screening” above).\nTransfer all dilutions into a 96 well polypropylene V-bottom source plate and pipette out in layout used for assay.\nNote: Alternatively, all dilutions can be directly performed in the V-bottom source plate using a multichannel pipette for automation and/or increasing throughput.\nCover the plate with lid or sealing film to minimize evaporation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3158_6.csv\nNote: The above serial dilution procedure can be used for both agonist and antagonist testing. If pre-treatment with inhibitors is performed, agonists (e.g. C5a or C3a) will need to be prepared at 10 X concentration and added on top of the inhibitors. For instance, to screen for C3a inhibitors, a 10 X concentration (3 nM) of recombinant/purified human C3a (1×: 0.3 nM, 10×: 3 nM) can be prepared and used to stimulate the cells following inhibitor pretreatment. We recommend using EC80-90 concentrations of agonist to give sufficient assay window whilst minimizing the deviation of IC50 values from Ki of the compound (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]\nPre-treat cells with antagonists (if applicable).\nTake out the cell plate from the incubator, use a vacuum aspirator or multichannel pipette to gently remove the serum-free medium, avoid touching the cell monolayer.\nUse a manual or electronic multichannel pipettor to add 45 μL/well of known inhibitor or testing compound (from the source plate) into the cell plate.\nReturn the plate to the tissue culture incubator and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nNote: A 30-min pre-treatment is generally sufficient for small-molecule and protein/antibody testing ligands. This duration can be altered if the binding kinetics of the testing compound is known to be slower/faster.\nStimulate cells with agonists.",
    "For an inhibition assay, where pretreatment with inhibitors has been conducted (Step 2 above): directly add 5 μL/well of 10 X agonist (C5a or C3a) to the cells, without removing the pretreatment solution.\nFor agonist assay (no pretreatment performed): use a vacuum aspirator or multichannel pipette to gently remove the serum-free medium. Then, transfer 50 μL/ well of the testing agonist solution to the cells.\nReturn the cell plate to the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) and incubate for 10 min (stimulation).\nNote: This step can also be performed at 20°C–25°C.\nWhile waiting, prepare 1 X Ultra lysis buffer by mixing 1 part of 5 X Ultra lysis buffer (supplied in the kit) to 4 volumes of deionized water, invert to mix.\nUpon 10 min stimulation, take out the cell plate from the incubator.\nQuickly remove the ligand treatment solution using a multichannel pipette or vacuum aspirator and then add 50 μL /well of 1× lysis buffer.\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker and shake for 15 min (450 rpm, 20°C–25°C).\nThe plate can now be used for detection in the next step.\nNote: Alternatively, for detection at a later time. The plate can be sealed using a plate sealer or parafilming the sides and storing −20°C or below.\nCritical: Anaphylatoxin mediated pERK signaling is highly time sensitive,17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] we recommend obtaining all the required equipment, reagents, ligands and buffers before commencing the assay. It is important to keep the stimulation duration consistent across experimental repeats.\nDetection of phosho-ERK1/2 in cell lysate\nTiming: 1 h (addition of reagents) to 17 h (incubation)\nThis section describes the detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the cell lysate using the AlphaLISA SureFire Ultra p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) Assay Kit.",
    "If the samples had been frozen, thaw the cell lysate by gently shaking the plate on an orbital shaker.\nNote: Allow 30 min to ensure all samples have been completely thawed and warmed to 20°C–25°C before commencing detection.\nCalculate the volume of the reaction mixes (2.5 μL per sample) needed for the assay. The required volumes can be calculated as:\nVolume\nof\nacceptor\n/\ndonor\nmix\nrequired\n=\nNumber\nof\nwells\n(\nsamples\n)\n×\n2.5\nμ\nL\n×\n110\n%\n(\nto\nallow\nfor\ndead\nvolume\n)\nNote: We have halved the per well reaction volume of this assay from that specified in the manufacturer’s protocol (https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/MAN_AlphaLISA_SureFire_Ultra.pdf[href=https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/MAN_AlphaLISA_SureFire_Ultra.pdf]). Based on our experience, this does not compromise the assay performance in a 384-well ProxiPlate. However, if other microplate types (e.g., standard 384 Opti-plate) or a one-plate protocol are to be used, we recommend using the assay volume as per the manufacture’s recommendations.\nPrepare AlphaLISA acceptor and donor mixes (under dimmed lighting), as per Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3158_7.csv\nNote: Store the reaction mixes at 20°C–25°C while performing the sample transfer.\nUse a multichannel pipette to transfer 5 μL of cell lysate from each well of the 96-well cell plate to a 384-well ProxiPlate.\nNote: This protocol adopts a 2-plate assay scheme (cell treatment and detection are conducted in two separate plates). If a 1-plate protocol is preferred instead (i.e. both cell treatment and detection are performed in the same plate), this step of lysate transfer can be omitted.\nPrepare the detection assay control samples as follows and add to the ProxiPlate in triplicates: negative control - 1× lysis buffer only, positive control - phospho-ERK positive control lysate (supplied by the kit).\nAdd 2.5 μL/well of Acceptor mix followed by 2.5 μL/well of the Donor mix.",
    "Note: The reaction mixes should be added separately in the sequence of Acceptor mix then Donor mix. The reaction mixes should not be mixed before adding to the cells.\nGently tap the plate to ensure proper mixing.\nSeal plate with TopSeal-A plate seal and cover with aluminum foil to protect from light.\nIncubate the plate for at least 2 h (up to 16 h) at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Based on our experience, 2-h incubation is generally sufficient for CHO cells, for HMDMs, we recommend incubating the plate for at least 3 h (up to 16 h) before reading.\nWithout removing the TopSeal-A film, place the plate in an Alpha-capable plate reader (e.g., a Tecan Spark M20).\nNote: Allow the plate to equilibrate to the plate reader temperature for at least 5 min prior to reading.\nRead the plate using standard AlphaLISA settings.\nNote: If the instrument does not have dedicated settings for AlphaLISA, a AlphaScreen script can be modified and used by changing the detection wavelength bandwidth to be centered around 615 nm."
