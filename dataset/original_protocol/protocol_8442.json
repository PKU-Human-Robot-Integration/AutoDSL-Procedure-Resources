    "1. Design of Transgenic Drosophila Expressing mEos2-Tagged Proteins\nSelect the protein to be tagged with the mEos2 protein. To increase the imaging success rate, select proteins with a transmembrane domain in the neuronal plasma membrane14 (e.g., Syntaxin-1A), proteins on synaptic vesicles or autophagosomes26,27 (e.g., Synaptobrevin-2), or cytosolic proteins with close interaction with neuronal plasma membrane proteins (e.g., Munc18-1).\nConstruct transgenes encoding the mEos2-tagged protein (Figure 1). Design the forward and reverse primers for the protein and mEos2.\n\tNOTE: The mEos2 coding sequence can be amplified from the pmEos2-N1 plasmid, which is designed to fuse to the C-terminus of the protein of interest. Cloning can for example be performed by in vivo recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the pFL44S-attB-MCS-w+ vector14,28, alternately other cloning methods could be used such as Gibson assembly protocol29.\n\t\nLinearize the vector with BamHI and XbaI and co-transform into ura3- yeast cells together with the PCR fragments encoding mEos2 and the protein of interest. Inject Drosophila embryos with the construct to generate a transgenic fly line30.\nRear the transgenic fly cultures on standard yeast and molasses medium or some other suitable substitute contained in plastic vials. To ensure healthy and fairly large synaptic boutons31, avoid overcrowding flies in the vials, and flip flies to new vials after each day of egg-laying; this ensures the third instar larvae are well fed and reach proper size by the time they commence wandering on the medium. Raise the transgenic fly at room temperature (25 °C).\n\tNOTE: Larger synaptic boutons tend to yield larger quantity of proteins visualized during imaging.\n2. Dissection of Third Instar Larva",
    "Make a cylindrical or semicylindrical shaped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) base ≤20 mm in diameter and ≤20 mm in height using an appropriate silicone elastomer kit (Figure 2A). Mix silicone elastomer with a silicone hardening agent at a ratio of 10:1.\n\t\nStir the mixture thoroughly for 5 min. Pour the mixture into a mold with the dimsensions listed above. Let it harden in an oven at 100 °C for 45 min. The PDMS base will serve as the foundation on which to carry out dissection. Ensure the PDMS base fits into the well of a glass-bottomed culture dish.\nSelect a wandering third instar larva from the vial wall. Use an optical stereo-microscope at 4.5 magnification to visualize the larva placed on the PDMS cylindrical base with the dorsal side up.\nUse curved and angled tweezers to stick minutien pins on the head over the mouth hooks, between the two extending anterior spiracles, and on the tail over the anus, between the two posterior spiracles. Add 40 µL of Schneider's insect medium at room temperature onto the immobilized larva.\n\tNOTE: Hemolyph-like solutions (HL3 or HL6) may also be used in the place of Schneider's solution32,33.\nProvide access through the dorsal side of the abdominal body wall of the larva by use of a minutien pin to incise into the midline of the wall.\nUse spring scissors to cut the body wall open from the incision point. Cut along the midline in the anterior-posterior direction34.\nUse fine forceps and spring scissors to disembowel the larva: remove the internal organs including the salivary glands, trachea and gut. Wash the larva twice with Schneider's insect medium.\nWith fine forceps, hold the two body wall flaps, gently stretch them out, and stick two minutien pins on each side. This should produce a hexagon-shaped preparation (Figure 2A).",
    "Detach the brain from the ventral nerve cord using spring scissors to decrease the possibility of muscle movement during imaging; this also serves to hold the preparation flat against the imaging dish. Use the curved tweezers to push all six minutien pins into the PDMS base.\n\tNOTE: Only a small portion of the pins should be embedded within the abdominal wall.\nTo confirm that the larva has survived the dissection procedure, slightly poke the ventral nerve cord, this should elicit a peristaltic contraction of the larva abdominal wall.\n3. Slightly Oblique Illumination Single-Particle Tracking Microscopy\nInvert the dissected larva-PDMS base onto a glass-bottomed culture dish. Fill the imaging dish with 2 mL of room temperature Schneider's insect medium (Figure 2B).\nLocate motor neurons in the second and third segments with synapses on abdominal muscles 6 and 735 using the 63x/1.2 NA water-immersion objective on a fluorescent total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope.\nUse the eyepieces of the microscope to locate the dissected larva; identify muscle 6 by use of bright field illumination.\nUse the microscope acquisition software (see Table of Materials), in TIRF configuration; slide the collimator camera angle to 1° to increase the penetration depth, otherwise move out of TIRF critical angle to achieve oblique illumination.\nSwitch the 488 nm laser on to visualize mEos2 in green. Use a low laser power (less than 5% of 22.8 mW) to avoid bleaching the green fluorescence. Locate the neuromuscular junctions (which look like beads on a string) and acquire a low resolution TIRF image.\nSimultaneously switch on the 405 nm laser (photoconverts mEos2 from green to red species) and the 561 nm laser (image the photoconverted red mEos2) to stochastically localize single mEos2 fluorescent proteins.",
    "NOTE: Use of low 405 nm laser power is recommended (0.005 to 0.9% of 4.78 mW) as this allows for a relatively constant photoconversion rate during movie acquisition. Use between 50 and 75% of the 561 nm laser (20.1 mW), as this is sufficient to acquire fluorescence from the red mEos2 species without adversely affecting the morphology of the muscle tissue surrounding the neuromuscular junction.\nFor each neuromuscular junction chain, acquire a time series composed of 15,000 frames or more at 33 Hz. Save as.czi format in order to preserve the accompanying meta-data for possible reference.\nUse ImageJ to convert '.czi' movie files to '.tiff' files.\nAnalyze the acquired movies with suitable single-molecule tracking analytical software11,14,36 such as TrackMate on FIJI/ImageJ37 (see Table of Materials). Locates the 'x' and 'y' coordinates of each localization by the Gaussian fit of the intensity point spread function (PSF).\n\tNote: Troubleshooting: If green fluorescence is not observed or is too dim at the neuromuscular junction upon exposure to the 488 nm laser, briefly switch on the photoconverting and imaging lasers (405 nm and 561 nm), as this helps to produce more of the red species of mEos2. Then switch back to the 488 nm laser and take a TIRF image.\n4. Single-Molecule Localization in Fixed Larvae\nTo measure the protein nanocluster size via PALM, replace the Schneider's insect medium after dissection with a fixative - 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nIncubate the larva for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove the dissection pins and place the fixed larva in a 1.7 mL clear snap-lock microcentrifuge tube.\nDissect and fix as many other larvae as needed, then wash them three times with PBS.\nReplace the PBS with block buffer (a solution of PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 3% normal goat serum).",
    "Wash the larvae with PBS three times, then incubate with the necessary primary antibody (diluted in the block buffer solution).\nIncubate overnight at 4 oC.\nWash the larvae three times with PBS, then incubate with the necessary secondary antibody (diluted in the block buffer solution).\nWash the larvae three times with PBS, attach the larva back onto the PDMS base, and image as previously described for single-molecule tracking."
