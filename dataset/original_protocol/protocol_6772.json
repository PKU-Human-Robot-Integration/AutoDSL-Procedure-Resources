    "Cell culture and plasmid transfectionAll steps involving cell culture must be performed in a laminar flow hood.Seed 3 × 104 HeLa cells in a 6-well plate containing 2-3 small coverslips using 2 ml DMEM complete medium per well. Prepare 1 well per time point (see Note 1).Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.After 24 h incubation, set up PEI transfection reaction. Per well:200 µl OptiMEM2 µg RUSH construct, e.g., pIRESneo3-SS-Str-KDEL-MMP2-SBP-EGFP15 µl 50mM PEI solutionVortex the transfection reaction and incubate it at room temperature for 20 min.Add dropwise to the cells and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for at least 16 h. Avoid incubation periods longer than 24 h. If they are necessary, change cell medium after 24 h.RUSH experimentAfter incubation, prepare 2 ml of DMEM complete with d-biotin to a final concentration of 40 µM per well. Prepare enough volume according to the number of wells to analyze (for example, for 4 wells (2 ml medium per well), prepare 9 ml of DMEM complete + 7.2 µl d-biotin 500 mM). Keep it warm at 37 °C.Remove medium from cells either by aspiration with a micropipette or with a vacuum pump and wash once with 1× DPBS.Add 2 ml DMEM complete without biotin to all the time points except the latest one (see Note 2). For example, for MMP2 four time points are analyzed (0, 15, 30 and 45 min). Add medium only to the wells labeled as 0, 15 and 30 min.Add 2 ml DMEM complete + biotin (from Step B1) to the latest time point (for MMP2, to the well labeled as 45 min. Figure 3, “start of the experiment”).Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "The incubation time is determined by the trafficking kinetics of each construct and in order to facilitate the experimental handling we recommend to start adding biotin first to the well that needs to be incubated the longest time (45 min for MMP2) and then continue with the earlier time points (30 and 15 min, see scheme in Figure 3).Important:Here is recommended to take the cells out of the incubator at least 2 min before triggering cargo trafficking in the next time point (for MMP2, the plate is taken out of the incubator 13 min after adding biotin to the previous well, namely, 2 min before starting the next time point. See note 2 for a more detailed explanation). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210301/20210301230230_3277.pngFigure 3. Scheme depicting the handling times during time intervals for the RUSH experiment. The scheme depicts the handling time for an experienced person using the MMP2 construct with the described time points of 0, 15, 30 and 45 min.Remove media from the next time point to be analyzed and add 2 ml DMEM complete + biotin.Repeat Steps B2, B4 and B5 until completing the full-time cycle (for MMP2, 45 min with a last biotin addition at 15 min before fixation, Figure 3).Coverslip montageRight before incubation ends, wash the cells (all the wells) 2 times with 1× PBS.Incubate cells for 10 min in 4% PFA in PBS under low light conditions. Make sure that the coverslips are completely covered with the PFA solution.Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.If no co-staining is performed: add a small amount of PBS to the well to facilitate the handling of coverslips and mount them using the ProLong antifade Gold reagent. For this purpose:Take a microscopy glass slide.Put one drop of ProLong antifade Gold reagent on the slide.",
    "Take carefully one of the coverslips with tweezers.Place the coverslip facing down on top of the ProLong antifade Gold reagent (i.e., the side of the coverslip with cells must be in contact with the antifade reagent).Carefully store them in a dark place until imaging. It is recommended to allow the montaged slides to dry for at least 24 h, ideally for 48 h.If co-staining is performed:Permeabilize the cells with permeabilization solution for 5 min under low light conditions.Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.Incubate with blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C under low light conditions.Freshly prepare the primary antibody solutions by diluting the antibody in blocking solution. Depending on the antibody, this information may be recommended by the manufacturer or require previous characterization in the lab to determine the ideal time and temperature.Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.Incubate with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C under low light conditions.Freshly prepare the secondary antibody solutions by diluting the amounts of antibody in blocking solutions recommended by the manufacturer.Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.Incubate with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature under low light conditions.Wash 3 to 5 times with 1× PBS.Mount the glass slides using the ProLong antifade Gold reagent (see Step C4).ImagingStart the microscope and warm up the required lasers. This process can take up to around 30 min depending on the lasers and the microscope.Set up a z-stack acquisition experiment. We used a 0.35 µm distance per slice with typically 10 to 15 planes to cover most of the cell volume.",
    "Focus a single cell (or several clearly defined and healthy single cells per field of view) and set up the number of stacks to be imaged using the signal from the RUSH channel.Adjust gain and intensity from the other channels, if necessary.Start imaging.Repeat Steps D3 and D4 until completing at least 15 cells per time point.Save files as *.lsm."
