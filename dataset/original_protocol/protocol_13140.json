  "procedures": [
    "All experiments were approved and supervised by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (approval number: SYXK2018-0040), which conforms to the stipulations in the World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration.\n1. Animal preparation\nHouse 32 Sprague Dawley (SD) male rats aged 8 weeks and weighing 180-220 g in a specific pathogen-free housing apparatus under 12 h light/12 h dark cycles at 24 ± 2 °C and 60% humidity with a standard rodent pellet diet. All experimental operations on animals comply with the welfare ethics of experimental animals and animal experimental safety regulations.\nRandomize and cage rats into four groups of eight animals each after 1 week of adaptive feeding: antiPD-L1+Tuina (group A), model (group B), Tuina (group C), and sham surgery (group D).\n2. Intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) in the knee\nNOTE: Except for group D, the KOA rat model will be prepared by the knee joint cavity injection of MIA in all the groups. For group D, inject 25 µL of sterile physiological saline into the right knee joint cavity.\nAnesthetize the rat by placing it in an anesthetic cage and then introducing 2.5% isoflurane until it is fully anesthetized. Confirm the animal is fully anesthetized by waiting for the point when the young rat is lying on its back, its limbs stop moving, and there is no response in toe pinch (pedal reflex), palpebral reflex, and muscle relaxation.\nAdd pet eye ointment and eye drops to the anesthetized young rats to prevent eye dryness.\nShave the right hind limb of the rats and disinfect the knee joint with three alternating rounds of iodophor and 75% ethanol.",
    "To maintain a standardized experimental condition, carefully fix the knee flexion at a precise angle of 90°, ensuring that the patellar ligament is oriented upwards. Subsequently, inject 25 µL of MIA solution, consisting of 4 mg of MIA diluted in 25 µL of sterile saline solution into the right knee joint cavity of the rats.\n\tNOTE: This injection was carried out with a specialized microinjector, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the procedure21,22,23. Put the rats back into the cages until they wake up. The animal that has undergone surgery is not returned to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nAt the end of the study, euthanize the rats by injecting 1% pentobarbital sodium as a 100 mg/kg dose.\n3. Implementation of Tuina\nNOTE: The implementation ofTuina will be guided by the theory that \"for patients with tendon and bone imbalance, tendons need to be treated first\". Both groups A and B started the intervention on the first day after the successful evaluation of the model, and both groups were operated once a day for 14 days. The remaining two groups were only observed for 14 days without any intervention. The operators of the manipulation must be strictly trained before the experiment to ensure the consistency of force, frequency, and rhythm.\nAccurately locate the rat acupuncture point, including EX-LE4, ST35, SP10, ST34, SP9, and GB34 (Figure 1 and Table 1), where finger kneading methods will be carried out by using Experimental Acupuncture24.\nFix the rat in the prone position on the rat fixation equipment.\nAfter it is quiet and the lower limbs are relaxed, knead the EX-LE4 and ST35 of the affected limb with the thumb and the index finger simultaneously for 4 min at 120-140 times/min.",
    "Knead the anterior and medial-lateral muscles of the affected limb with the thumb and the index finger for 3 min at 120-140 times/min, focusing on the SP10, ST34, and the muscles near the knee joint. Emphasize the manipulation of those stiff muscles with an intensity so that the rat does not struggle.\nKnead the posterior calf muscles of the affected limb from top to bottom for 3 min at 120-140 times/min by using the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger. To fully expose the treatment area, use the ring finger and the little finger to hold the ankle joint of the affected limb and gently tug on the affected limb. Focus on SP9, GB34, and the muscles near the knee joint with emphasis on the rigid muscles and intensity so that the rat does not struggle.\n4. Measurement of behavioral index\nMeasurement of plantar mechanical pain threshold\n\tNOTE: Measure plantar mechanical pain thresholds 1 day before MIA injection as well as 2, 9, and 16 days after injection.\n\t\nBring the rats to a plantar test room with a stainless-steel grid bottom and a plastic cage body in a quiet environment at room temperature (22 ± 2) °C for 30 min of adaptation.\nUse an electronic mechanical pain tester with a plastic test needle of 0.8 mm in diameter to stimulate the central area of the right hindfoot of the rats vertically. Evenly and gradually increase the stimulation intensity until the rats show paw retraction and avoidance reactions.\nRecord the reading of the electronic screen as the mechanical pain threshold of the right plantar foot of the rat.\nMeasure each rat 5x at 5 min intervals.",
    "Remove the maximum and minimum values from the five values. Take the average value of the middle three values through the trimmed mean method as the result (Table 2).\nMeasurement of paw mechanical withdrawal threshold\n\tNOTE: Measure paw mechanical withdrawal threshold 1 day before MIA injection, 2, 9, and 16 days after injection.\n\t\nBring the rats to a heated plantar test room with a 30 °C glass bottom and a plastic cage body in a quiet environment at room temperature (22 ± 2) °C for 30 min of adaption.\nStimulate the right hind plantar center area with a light source heating device at a stimulation temperature of 65 °C until the rat shows a paw retraction and avoidance response.\nRecord the time reading of the electronic screen as the right plantar thermal pain threshold of the rat.\nMeasure each rat 5x continuously at 5 min intervals.\nRemove the maximum and minimum values from the five values. Take the average value of the middle three values through the trimmed mean method as the result (Table 3).\n5. Measurement of swelling of the right knee joint\nNOTE: Measure the swelling of the right knee joint of rats 1 day before MIA injection, 2, 9, and 16 days after the injection.\nAnesthetize the rat by placing it in an anesthetic cage and exposing it to 2.5% isoflurane until it is fully anesthetized.\nPlace the rat in a flat position on the operating table.\nMeasure the width of the right knee joint with vernier calipers (Figure 2 and Table 4).\n6. Measurement of the Lequesne MG score",
    "NOTE: Measure the Lequesne MG score in rats at 2, 9, and 16 days after MIA injection. Lequesne et al developed an index of severity for osteoarthritis for the hip (ISH), which can be used to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. We consider four parameters: pain stimulation, gait change, joint mobility, and joint swelling.\nBring the rats to a manipulation platform in a quiet environment at room temperature (22 ± 2) °C.\nHave two operators, blinded to each other, measure the local pain stimulation response, gait change, joint movement, and joint swelling.\n\t\nStimulate the lateral side of the right knee joint with a plastic test needle and score on a scale of 0-3 according to the response. 0 no response; 3 a good response; 1 contraction of the affected limb; 2 contraction and spasm of the affected limb, accompanied by mild generalized reactions, such as trembling, licking, and sucking.\nPlace the rat on the operating table and observe the gait of its right hind limbs. Score on a scale of 0-3 according to the response. 0 no disturbance in the movement of the affected limb, normal running, and strong footwork; 3 the affected limb cannot participate in walking, touch the ground, or stomp on the ground; 1 mild trekking during running with strong stomps; 2 the affected limb participates in walking, but the disturbance in movement of the rats (trekking) is obvious.\nFlex and extend the right knee joint of the rat by hand and observe the joint mobility. Score on a scale of 0-3 according to the response. 0 joint mobility angle of more than 90°; 3 joint mobility angle of less than 15°; 1 joint mobility angle or 45°-90°; 2 joint mobility angle of 15°-45°.",
    "Touch the right knee joint of the rat and compare the response with that of a normal rat. Score on a scale of 0-2 according to the response. 0 no obvious swelling and visible bony markings; 2 marked swelling and no bony markings; 1 mild swelling and superficial bony markings.\nAdd these scores to produce the Lequesne MG score for each rat and calculate the average value through the trimmed method (Table 5).\n7. Measurement of skin temperature\nNOTE: Measure the skin temperature 1 day before MIA injection and 9 and 16 days after injection.\nAnesthetize the rat by placing it in an anesthetic cage and then introducing isoflurane until it is fully anesthetized.\nPlace the rat in a lateral position on the operating table, at room temperature (22 ± 2) °C.\nStraighten the right knee joint by gently grasping the foot with the hand. Photograph to determine the skin temperature by using a Filr infrared camera.\nRead the skin temperature of the knee joint and around the knee joint of the rat by using supporting editing software. Set control points at the ankle joint and knee joint where the temperature gradually decreases.\n8. Statistical analysis\nUse statistical software to express the experimental data in quartiles.\nUse the trim mean method to deal with the outliers. The outcomes of behavioral tests are noted as the mean ± standard error of the mean.\nPerform independent samples t-test for comparison between groups. Analyze the behavioral data using a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests. Where data do not exhibit normality or homoscedasticity, perform a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis k samples).\n\tNOTE: P < 0.05 indicates that the differences are statistically significant. All the data meet the assumptions of the statistical tests that are applied.",
