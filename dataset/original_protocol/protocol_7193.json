    "Dicing reaction (see Figure 1)The recombinant soluble N-terminal strep-tagged AtDCL3 was expressed in the insect cell line sf9, using a Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen), and purified by Strep (IBA Life Science), Mono-Q (GE Healthcare), and Superdex G200 columns (GE Healthcare), as described (Wang et al., 2021).The purified protein was buffer changed to 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, concentrated to 1 mg/mL, aliquoted to 10–20 μL/tube, freezed by liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80°C. Before the dicing reaction, the tube containing freezed protein was placed on ice for 30 min, to allow the protein to melt.Mix the 30-nt guide ssRNA (5’-phos-AACAAGCGAAUGAGUCAUUCAUCCUAAGUC) and the 31-nt complement ssRNA (GACUUAGGAUGAAUGACUCAUUCGCUUGUUC) in one tube, at a molar ratio of 1:1, in water. Anneal the two ssRNA into dsRNA by heating the mixture to 95°C, in a Hi-temperature Dry Bath for 1 min. Place the tube at room temperature to slowly cool-down. Depending on different Dicers and experimental designs, the RNA length and sequence vary accordingly.Prepare 0.01 nmol dsRNA in 10 µL of reaction buffer (on the lid) and 0.003 nmol protein in 40 μL of reaction buffer (in the tube), separately (the ratio of protein and RNA may differ on different enzymes).Spin all the tubes softly at the same time, to mix the protein and RNA to initiate reactions simultaneously.Put the mixture into an incubator at 37°C for 5 min. The reaction time can be set from 1 minute to several hours, depending on different enzymes and experimental purposes.Add 50 µL of 2× RNA loading buffer to the tube lid. Then, spin all the tubes at the same time to transfer the loading buffer into the reaction mixtures, to stop reactions simultaneously.",
    "Heat the sample to 94°C for 5 min, and quickly transfer it onto the ice for 10 min.Spin the ice-cooled sample tubes with an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424R at 13,500 × g and 4°C for 1 min.Each experiment should be repeated three times.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4382/bioprotoc-12-07-4382-g001.jpgFigure 1. Workflow for the dicing reaction and sample preparation Preparation of the urea PAGE gel (Adachi and Yu, 2014; Green and Sambrook, 2021; Rio et al., 2010; Summer et al., 2009).Treat the gel plates with RNaseZap, then wash them with RNase-free water.Lay the larger glass plate on the bench top and arrange the 1 mm spacers on both sides, but not the top and bottom of the glass plate. Cover the second glass plate to assemble the 20 × 20 cm gel plates with 1 mm spacers.Seal three slides of the gel plates with gel-sealing tape, to form a sealed slit with a thickness of 1 mm (longer and thinner gels lead to better resolution).Clamp the plates on both sides with eight or nine binders (three on each side, and two or three on the bottom), to clamp the gel plates and spacers together.Prepare 34.65 mL of 15% acrylamide gel mixture (see Recipe) in a 50 mL tube.Add 350 µL of APS into the 50 mL tube, and quickly and carefully mix the solution, to prevent air bubbles.Add 10 µL of TEMED into the 50 mL tube, and quickly and carefully mix the solution, to prevent the air bubbles.Pour the mixture into the slit (Note: avoid air bubbles), insert the 26-holes comb, and wait for 30 min, to allow the gel to polymerize.Remove the comb and the tape, and mount the gel plates onto the gel running apparatus. Add 0.5× TBE to both the upper and lower reservoirs.",
    "Clamp an aluminum plate to the front side of the gel plate.Pre-run the gel at 5 W for 60 min, to equilibrate and preheat the gel.Running the gelRinse the wells extensively, until they are as clear as possible, with 0.5× TBE, using a syringe needle.Load the samples into the wells.Run the gel with a consistent power of 5 W for 3.5–4 h.Visualizing the RNA stained by SYBR GoldRemove the gel plates from the gel running apparatus. Use a metal spatula to pry the top glass plate off the gel.Add water in a box. Carefully, flip the gel to face the water. Transfer the gel into the box, using water force, by shaking the box.Remove the water from the box and add 30 mL of 0.5× TBE into the box, to submerge the gel.Add 3 µL of 10,000× SYBR Gold into the box in a dark room, and shake the gel on a shaker at 50 rpm for 40 min.Wash the gel with RNase-free water.Place the gel on a fluorescent plate of the multi-function Imager, to visualize the RNA at the wavelength of 302 nm. The gel image can be stored in .tiff format.Calculate the dicing activity by ImageJ (see Figure 2) (Wang et al., 2021)Download the ImageJ program from the website https://imagej.nih.gov/ij[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij].Go to “File” tab, click “Open” to load the gel image into ImageJ, and invert the background and the bands, which will show the image as black background and white bands.Go to the “Analysis” tab, click “Set measurements”, check the “Integrated Density” box, and then click the “OK”.Measure the raw integrated density (RID) of the background without any band, as that which exists inside a rectangle which can encircle the biggest band.Measure all of the target bands separately. The resulting data file is then saved as an Excel spreadsheet.",
    "Each relative RID value for each band is calculated by subtracting the measured RID value by the measured background RID.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4382/bioprotoc-12-07-4382-g002.jpgFigure 2. Workflow of ImageJ processing Step 1, load the gel image into the ImageJ program. Step 2, invert the background and the bands. Lanes 1–6 represent the six samples. Band 1 shows the rectangle circle without any band inside, which is used as background area. This rectangle should be big enough for encircle the biggest band. Bands 2–7 are the substrate that has not been cleaved. Bands 8–13 are the dicing products for the corresponding samples. Step 3, the data was saved as an Excel file. The relative RID value of each sample band is calculated as the measured RID value of the band minus the measured background RID value from band “1”.The dicing activity of each sample is presented by the dicing activity of the relative RID of the lower band of the panel divided by the sum of the lower and the upper bands of the same panel, then multiplying this by 100. This workflow only represents a single time processing. Three replicates of the experiment should be conducted. The standard deviation (SD) value of the three replicates for one sample should be calculated.Statistical analysis in Origin 7.0Prepare the Origin 7.0 program (http://www.originlab.com[href=http://www.originlab.com]).Input the calculated values of interest for the three experimental replicates into the Origin program.Go to “Statistics” tab, click “Hypothesis Testing”-“Two sample t-test” to analyze the difference between two samples.Input the different P-value related to the specific sample, mark the value of P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.0001 as “﹡”, “﹡﹡”, “﹡﹡﹡”, “﹡﹡﹡﹡”.Go to “column” table, “set as” the “sample name”, “mean value”, “SD”, “﹡”, corresponding to “X”, “Y”, “Y Error”, “Label”, separately.",
    "Go to “Plot” tab, click “Column/Bar/Pie” to draw a corresponding statistic bar chart (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4382/bioprotoc-12-07-4382-g003.jpgFigure 3. Example for In vitro Dicing Assay result by Origin.  The x-axis states the different samples, the y-axis shows the mean value of the dicing ratio with error bars presenting the SD. The dicing activity of samples 2–6 are lower than that of sample 1, with significant differences."
