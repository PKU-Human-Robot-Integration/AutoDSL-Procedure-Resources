    "SotaTool is broadly applicable across multiple in vitro platforms in which sarcomeres are visible in contractile cells by phase contrast or fluorescent microscopy. This section describes the steps of plating, fixing, immunofluorescence staining, imaging, and analyzing 2D hiPSC-CM cultures (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-fig-0002]). For live cultures, the required steps are described in the next section. Here, we immunostained hiPSC-CMs for α-actinin but other sarcomeric proteins can also be stained. Better results were obtained with proteins that are part of the Z-discs or M-lines (e.g., titin, myomesin) than with A-band proteins (actin, troponin). Differentiation and immunostaining of skeletal muscle differs from the protocol described below and can be found in Iuliano et al. (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0010]). The acquisition and analysis (steps 29-49) are identical for all models.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e8dd0e05-ba91-4ac8-a466-6f621c3c1b73/cpz1462-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nStrategic planning and time considerations for the protocol.\nMaterials\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), either from commercial sources (e.g., Ncardia, cat. no.

Thaw and culture commercially available hiPSC-CMs according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, use hiPSC-CMs differentiated using a preferred protocol (Breckwoldt et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0002]; Correia et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0005]; Current Protocols article: Giacomelli, Bellin, Orlova, & Mummery, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0007]; Mummery et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0015]). High (>80%) differentiation efficiency is recommended but not essential.\nThe protocol uses volumes recommended for 6-well plates except if stated otherwise.\n2. Coat a thin-bottom 96-well plate with a 50-µl drop of Matrigel (1:100 in DPBS for 1 hr at room temperature.\nOther tissue culture grade surfaces are acceptable, although they should be appropriate for high resolution microscopy (equivalent to glass coverslips).\n3. Prepare the dissociation reagent by adding 100 μl Enzyme T to 900 μl Buffer X from the multi tissue dissociation kit.\n4. Wash cells with DPBS− once (1 ml per well for 6-well plates) and aspirate.\n5. Add Enzyme T/Buffer X mix to the well and incubate 10 min in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).",
    "Other dissociation techniques are suitable, such as TrypLE express or collagenase. For more information, see Koc, Sahoglu Goktas, Akgul Caglar, and Cagavi (2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0012]).\n6. Add 1 ml BPEL plus 10% FBS to the well. Collect the entire volume with a P1000 pipet and mechanically disrupt the cells in suspension by gently pipetting up and down.\nCritical step: Mix thoroughly but carefully. Cardiomyocytes are sensitive to mechanical stress and resuspending too harshly might decrease yield.\n7. Collect all cells in a 15-ml Falcon tube.\n8. Rinse the well with 2 ml BPEL plus 10% FBS and add to the Falcon tube. Repeat once.\n9. Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 3 min and remove supernatant.\n10. Add 1 ml BPEL and resuspend.\n11. Count cells manually or with an automatic cytometer.\n12. Add 25,000 cells to the pre-coated 96-well plate in 200 µl BPEL.\nCMs from different hiPSC lines tend to react differently to dissociation and replating. Optimization of this step (e.g., seeding density) might be necessary to reach optimal viability and morphology. We recommend that the confluency be high enough for proper cardiomyocyte morphology but not high enough to induce clumping.\n13. Return to the humidified incubator and refresh BPEL after 24 hr.\nImmunostaining hiPSC-CM monolayers in 96-well plates\n14. After at least 3 days in culture, remove plates from the incubator and wash cells with cold DPBS−.\nThe next steps are all performed at room temperature except when stated otherwise.\n15. Fix cells with 4% PFA in 0.2 M DPBS, pH 7.4 for 10 min.\nCAUTION: This step must be performed in a fume hood.\n16. Wash three times with DPBS−.\n17. Permeabilize with DPBS− with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min.\n18. Wash three times with DPBS−.",
    "19. Block non-specific antibody binding for 1-2 hr with DPBS− plus 10% FBS.\n20. Dilute primary antibody in DPBS− plus 10% FBS according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n21. Remove blocking solutions and add the solution with the antibody to the cells. Incubate cells overnight at 4°C or 3 hr at room temperature.\nRocking the plate during this step can increase the penetration of the antibody and is advised.\n22. Remove the antibody and wash three times with DPBS− with 0.05% Tween 20 for 10 min.\n23. Dilute the secondary antibody in DPBS− plus 10% FBS according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCritical step: Do not expose either the antibody mix or the multi-well plate after this step to direct light.\n24. Add the secondary antibody to the cells and incubate 2 hr.\nRocking the plate during this step can increase the penetration of the antibody and is advised.\n25. Wash cells five times with DPBS− with 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min.\n26. Counterstain with 1:500 DAPI for 10 min.\nCounterstaining is not strictly necessary for the sarcomere length detection but facilitates identifying regions of interest during acquisition.\n27. Wash with DPBS− with 0.05% Tween 20 twice.\n28. Add a volume of DPBS− large enough to prevent drying.\nStore the multi-well plate in a dark box or wrapped in aluminium foil to avoid exposure to light; the cells can now be stored at 4°C for several days before imaging. For optimal imaging, it is recommended that imaging be carried out <1 week after the immunostaining.\nImaging the samples\nThis next step can be performed on various confocal microscope systems. The Leica SP8 is given as an example.\n29. Turn on the Leica SP8 confocal microscopic system, the computer, and the Leica imaging suite.",
    "30. Place the 96-well plate into the appropriate holder.\n31. Select the appropriate objective.\nCritical step: The highest magnification will give the best spatial resolution for sarcomere length detection. An objective of at least 40× is recommended, preferably 63× and 100× lenses. For improved signal, use the appropriate immersion fluid.\n32. Activate the appropriate laser light using the Leica Dye Assistant.\n33. Make sure all other settings are optimal for the best resolution and minimal background.\nEither frame or line averaging is recommended to reduce background fluorescence.\n34. Adjust objective so that the sarcomeres are in focus.\n35. Acquire at least ten to fifteen images per condition.\nCritical step: Keep all microscope settings identical for all acquisitions. If settings are not kept identical, comparing different datasets or treatment conditions is impossible.\n36. Export each image as a separate TIFF.\nAnalysis of images with the SotaTool\nNOTE: The next steps can be carried out on any computer (PC) and/or laptop with sufficient hardware (see Materials list), as the SotaTool is a stand-alone application requiring no installation. Computing time will depend on the resolution, size, and bit-depth of the raw images and the PC specifications. For one 1024 × 1024 TIFF with a bit depth of 16 and the default offset of 4 μm, the computing time is ∼50 s on a standard PC.\n37. Transfer all TIFF images to a single folder.\nMake sure the TIFF images all contain one image with sarcomeric staining (no stacks or videos).\n38. Download the entire software folder of the SotaTool (www.github.com/steinjm/SotaTool[href=http://www.github.com/steinjm/SotaTool]) and place anywhere on the computer.\n39. Double click on the executable file within the folder named SotaTool.exe.\n40. Click ‘Browse’ to select the folder with the images to analyze (input directory, Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f69efdaf-efc8-41ff-9319-f8870e448d62/cpz1462-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

A properly analyzed output graph shows a recurring sinusoid, where a vertical trendline is located at the first peak.",
    "This protocol describes the analysis of videos of hiPSC-CMs expressing a mEGFP-tagged ACTN2 protein from an ACTN2-GFP WTC hiPSC line (Roberts et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0020]). In choosing which tagged sarcomere proteins are best to use, the same recommendations apply as for static images (see introduction of Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-prot-0001]). ACTN2-reporter cells were differentiated using a modified version of Giacomelli et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0007]). Analyses of phase-contrast images or live acquisitions of neonatal rabbit cardiomyocytes using SotaTool are identical; a protocol for the isolation of these cells can be found in MacQuaide, Ramay, Sobie, and Smith (2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-bib-0013]).\nAdditional Materials (see also Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-prot-0001])\nhiPSC-CMs with a mEGFP-tagged ACTN2-reporter: Allen Institute for Cell Science ACTN2-GFP WTC iPSC line (AICS-0075-085, https://hpscreg.eu/cell-line/UCSFi001-A-4[href=https://hpscreg.eu/cell-line/UCSFi001-A-4] with mEGFP inserted at ACTN2 C-terminus, obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research)\nAndor Dragonfly 500 spinning disc inverted confocal microscope\nPersonal computer equipped with Andor Fusion software for microscopy and analysis (Oxford Instruments Andor, version 2.3)\nOn-stage incubator\nElectric field stimulator (homemade or equivalent commercially available device, e.g., IonOptix myopacer cell stimulator)\nPreparing the samples\nThe following steps are performed under aseptic conditions.\n1. Perform steps 1-13 of Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-prot-0001].\n2. Thaw cells according manufacturer's instructions and plate on a thin-bottom 96-well plate.\n3. Allow cells to recover for 24 hr and refresh medium.\nImaging the samples\nNOTE: In order to extract sufficient data on the time dynamics and spatial resolution of the sarcomeric contraction, a frame rate of >50 frames per second (fps) is recommended for acquisition of live images on video. Note, this frame rate depends on the beating (and/or stimulation) frequency. For this purpose, we use an Andor Dragonfly spinning disc 500 with an on-stage incubator but an equivalent (widefield) system can be used as well.\n4. Start the Andor Dragonfly spinning disc confocal system, detectors, lasers, and on-stage incubator.",
    "5. Wait for the on-stage incubator to achieve appropriate conditions (37°C, 5% CO2).\n6. Mount the multi-well plate onto the microscope.\n7. Start the Fusion software.\n8. Perform steps 30-37 of Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-prot-0001].\nCritical step: For the laser settings, choose the 488-nm laser line for excitation. Exposure time should be kept low to achieve high fps. The histogram should have a range of at least 256 bits.\nUse the appropriate immersion fluid suitable for imaging at 37°C.\n9. Place the electrodes of the field stimulator in the 96-well plate and pace the cells.\nSteps 9 and 10 are optional. However, we recommend imaging the cells with and without field stimulation to gain optimal insight in the contractile behavior and spontaneous beat rate.\n10. Check whether the cells are “following” the imposed pacing rate.\nWe recommend 1.2 Hz with 5 ms duration and voltage of 15 mV bipolar pulse. If cells exhibit a fast spontaneous beat rate, higher simulation frequencies are required to avoid arrhythmic contractions. If the cells do not follow at all, increase the duration and voltage of the pulse.\n11. Acquire images.\nWe recommend acquiring a movie consisting of at least four contractions. For example, when imaging at 50 fps and pacing at 1.2 Hz, acquire around 180 frames per position.\n12. Export each image as a separate TIFF.\nEnsure the timestamp is properly added to either the name or meta data of each frame. When using the Andor Dragonfly, an ImageJ macro can be found on www.github.com/steinjm/SotaTool[href=http://www.github.com/steinjm/SotaTool] to export all .ims-files in a folder to single TIFF files ready for analysis with SotaTool.\nExtracting the fractional shortening using the SotaTool\n13. Perform steps 39-47 from Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-prot-0001].\n14. Open the sheet with the sarcomere lengths in any preferred data visualization software (e.g., Excel, R-Studio, Graphpad).",
    "An R-script can be found on www.github.com/steinjm/SotaTool[href=http://www.github.com/steinjm/SotaTool] for automated peak detection and calculation of relevant read-outs such as sarcomeric shortening, beat-beat interval, and beat duration, along with instructions for use.\n15. Plot the sarcomere length on the y-axis against the timestamp on the x-axis for each separately acquired movie.\n16. Note the maximum sarcomere and minimum sarcomere length and calculate the difference.\n17. Divide the distance of shortening by the maximum length × 100% for the fractional shortening of that cell.\nTo increase technical robustness, these last two steps can be done for each individual contraction in a movie. Using healthy cells, this fractional shortening would not differ noticeably between contractions. If this is not the case, the mean fractional shortening of all contractions should be calculated.",

    "The following section describes the settings as shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-fig-0003].\nHardware\nPersonal computer (Windows or macOS) with at least 6 GB of RAM and access to the Internet\n1. Background subtraction greatly enhances the image quality and therefore increases accuracy of the algorithm. This is turned on by default and always recommended when no prior background subtractions have been performed on the raw data.\n2. Segmentation automatically segments the original images and saves them in a subfolder for subsequent analysis.\nSee Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.462#cpz1462-prot-0005].\n3. The offset distance is automatically defined as 4 μm but in this box the user can manually define the maximum offset distance. This greatly reduces computing time. It is crucial that the offset distance is not smaller than the expected sarcomere length.\n4. Rolling ball size is automatically defined as 2 μm, which is optimized for hiPSC-CMs. Here, the user can manually override this ball size.\n5. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-filtering filters out the lowest gray values of the original image by disregarding the first columns and rows of the GLCM before calculating the correlation value. We have found the best default number to be three but the user can input a manual override here.\nSee Background Information section for more information.\n6. In this box, the user can insert the maximum expected sarcomere length. This feature is useful when there is noise in the image.\n7. Skip graphs to save time. We do not recommend skipping the output graphs as this is the only way to verify the analysis has been performed correctly.\n8. When this box is checked, an additional .csv file is exported in the output directory with the interpolated data.",

Check whether the program outputs values for sarcomere length or 0 values only.\n3. Check the output graphs.\nSee Troubleshooting section.\n4. If there are no peaks visible, segmentation might be necessary to find proper sarcomere length values.\nSee Troubleshooting section.\n5. Repeat the analysis on the raw images but check ‘Segmentation’ before starting analysis.\nThis function will create a subfolder named ‘segments’ for saving the segments. If a new analysis is started with new segmentation settings, this folder will be emptied and new segments will be saved. Make sure there is enough free memory on the PC for the segmented images.\n6. Check the output sheet. For each image, the segment with the highest sarcomere organization score has the most reliable sarcomere length but the mean of multiple (properly analyzed) segments can also be used."
