    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn utero electroporation of plasmids in the mouse embryonic cortex\nTiming: 30 min each pregnant female mouse\nThis section describes the procedures for the in utero electroporation of plasmids in the mouse embryonic cortex according to previous reports (Meyer-Dilhet and Courchet, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Pacary and Guillemot, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Saito, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Sterile procedures are required during the operation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Due to electroporation is accomplished with cesarean section at gestational age embryonic day (E14.5), all surgical instruments necessary for cesarean section surgery are heat sterilized to reduce contamination risk.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1716-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of in utero electroporation of plasmids into E14.5 mouse embryos\nLV: lateral ventricle.\nNote: Pre-heat the normal saline at 38°C, and prepare the cesarean section operating table. Adjust and ensure the voltage, time and frequency of electroporation. Prepare the plasmids used in this procedure and mix the plasmid with Fast Green (0.1 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) at the ratio of 99:1 (v/v). Try to finish the electroporation and section as fast as possible to keep high viability of embryonic and pregnant mice.\nSterilize the surgery tools, operation area and electrode with 75% ethanol.\nAnesthetize pregnant Rack1F/F mouse by injecting 1% sodium pentobarbital (6 g/kg).\nCritical: Prepare the anesthetic when it is used. And try to choose other legal anesthetics that are less reactive to mouse.\nCritical: The pregnant mice are anesthetized one by one. Next pregnant mouse is anesthetized when the cesarean section of above one has finished.\nSlightly put the anesthetized pregnant mouse on the operation table and fix the limbs with adhesive tape. Hair is removed from the abdomen of the mouse using a commercially available depilatory cream.\nCover the body of the mouse with sterile gauze, except for the abdomen and head. And the abdomen of the mouse is disinfected with betadine.",
    "At the middle of lower abdomen, lift the skin with tweezers and make an incision about 1 cm with ophthalmic scissors.\nNote: The incision of the mouse is kept moist with warm (about 37°C) sterile saline.\nGently pull out the uterine horn with scissors to expose the embryos.\nFor each embryo, inject the lateral ventricle with 1 μg of plasmids DNA (pCAG-dCre-GFP or pCAG-Cre-GFP) mixed with 1% Fast Green (v/v) for a total volume of 1 μL using a glass pulled micropipette, respectively. The plasmids are injected into the mouse according to the list in the table. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nThe indicated expression constructs were then electroporated using an ECM 830 electroporator (BTX) with five 50 ms pulses separated by 950 ms intervals at 40 V.\nEach group of plasmids are injected into five different embryos in at least three independent operations.\nAfter electroporation, the uterine horns are carefully repositioned into the abdominal cavity.\nThe cavity is bathed with pre-warmed sterile saline, and the wound is sutured closed.\nThe mice are left under observation on a heating pad until recovery, then returned to home cage and monitored for pain carefully.\nBrain dissociation and tissue preparation and frozen section\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes the procedures for brain dissociation from embryos at E18.5, brain fixation, dehydration and frozen section (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1716-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of mouse brain collection steps from E18.5 mouse embryos\nPrepare the electroporated pregnant mice at E18.5 and euthanize them by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (6 g/kg), which is approved by the animal welfare committee.\nNote: Try to choose the legal anesthetics that are less reactive to mouse.\nSlightly put the anesthetized pregnant mouse on the operation table and dissect the abdomen of anesthetized pregnant mouse with fine scissors.",
    "Take out all the embryos from the pregnant mouse under binocular microscope and put them in 37°C normal saline.\nDissect the brains under binocular microscope by using fine microsurgical tweezers and collect the brain into 4% paraformaldehyde in a 10 mL centrifuge tube one by one. And make a mark on the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nCritical: There is a meninges on the surface of the brain. Carefully remove the meninges by using fine microsurgical tweezers.\nFix the brains in paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrate with gradient 15% sucrose (Sigma, 57-50-1) for 24 h and 30% sucrose for 48 h, respectively.\nPlace the tissues in 1:1 30% sucrose/OCT (Tissue-Tek) solution for 1–2 h at 4°C, in 100% OCT compound for 1 h at 4°C, embed them in 100% OCT compound and froze in Cryomold at −20°C (Thermo Fisher, CRYOSTAR NX50).\nStore the sections in −20°C refrigerator for subsequent experiments.\nSenescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining\nTiming: 26 h\nThis section describes the procedures for the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity detection of sections from mice brains. The staining procedures are carried out according to protocol supplied by the manufacturer (C0602, Beyotime[href=https://www.beyotime.com/product/C0602.htm]).\nNote: For all technique replicates, sections from both groups are stained simultaneously, using the same batch of staining buffer to avoid inter-assay variation.\nTake the slices out from freezer and warm them up to room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\nFix brain sections in fixative for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).",
    "Note: This is an optimized step. The fixative is from the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining kit and its main composition is 4% PFA. This step can be ignored if the fixed time in Step17 is longer enough. Otherwise, this step is necessary (such as large or fresh tissue used in the experiment). In addition, in our experiment, we found two-step fixation did not affect the staining quality and experimental results compared to one-step fixation.\nWash the slices three times with PBS for 5 min each and prepare the SA-β-Gal solution. Each 1 mL SA-β-Gal staining solution is mixed with 10 μL solution A (potassium ferrocyanide), 10 μL solution B (potassium ferricyanide), 100 μL X-Gal and 880 μL solution C (citric acid-sodium phosphate buffer).\nStain the slices immediately with SA-β-Gal staining solution (pH 6.0) for 24 h in the incubator at 37°C protected from light. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nRinse the slices with PBS for three times after the blue color is developed.\nImmunofluorescent staining\nTiming: 24 h\nThese procedures are performed after the SA-β-Gal staining procedures.\nAfter washing the slices with PBS, the slices are permeabilized with 1% PBST (1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nBlock the slices with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in 0.3% PBST for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nIncubate the brain samples on the slide with the primary antibody overnight (12 h–16 h) at 4°C. Primary antibodies and dilutions (diluted in 3% BSA in 0.3% PBST) are as following: anti-GFP (1:500) and anti-Sox2 (1:400).",
    "Note: The plasmids coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged Cre or dCre are used for in utero electroporation in this experiment. In particular, the SA-β-Gal staining is prior to immunofluorescent staining, and this step reduces the intensity of GFP autofluorescence causing the GFP signal much weaker. To better illustrate the GFP signals, we used anti-GFP labeling to amplify the GFP signals. It should be noted that the immunofluorescent staining of other proteins can also be performed according to experimental requirement.\nWash the sections three times with PBS (5 min each).\nIncubate the sections with secondary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C). Alexa Fluor 568- or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies and dilutions (diluted in 3% BSA in 0.3% PBST) are as the ratio of 1:500.\nWash the sections five times with PBS (5 min each).\nMount the slices with medium containing DAPI (Invitrogen, P36961).\nMicroscope observation\nTiming: 12 h\nThese procedures follow the staining and start after the slides are air dried completely.\nUse confocal microscope (Olympus FV-1200; Olympus, Japan) to obtain the fluorescence imaging picture.\nNote: It is pivotal to acquire the fluorescence imaging pictures firstly, because the strong light will attenuate the fluorescence signal. And makes a special symbol on the slide in each brain sample to distinguish each sample.\nUse a digital slide scanner (NanoZoomer Digital Pathology; Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) with a 20× objective to acquire brightfield photomicrographs of SA-β-Gal staining.
