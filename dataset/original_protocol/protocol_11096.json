    "All the experiments described here were conducted under protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University.\n1. Extended anti-inflammatory treatment\nEnsure that mice receiving injection solutions containing EtOH or other potential irritants are provided with anti-inflammatory treatment from 2 days before injection to 7 days after injection. The preferred method of dosing is oral delivery through a sucralose gel cup containing carprofen at an appropriate concentration.\nPrepare carprofen with the required concentration. For this experiment, a working solution of 2 mg/mL (Stock solution is 50 mg/mL) was prepared by diluting in sterile PBS to inject 0.5 mL to achieve a final dose of 1 mg per cup. Add 1% v/v sterile blue food dye (BFD) in place of a fraction of the PBS of the total volume needed for dilution to better visualize complete mixing of the drug into the sucralose gel.\nPrepare a cup for carprofen addition as per the manufacturer's recommendation. Unless recommended otherwise, place the cup in 60 °C water bath for 15 min. Remove the cups and dry them off to minimize the possibility of contamination.\n\t\nUse 70% EtOH or an EtOH wipe to clean the surface of the cup lid and allow to dry. Use a syringe to inject the necessary amount of carprofen solution through the lid. For this experiment, 500 µL is injected. Cover the injection site with a sticker and shake vigorously for 15 s.\nVortex the cup for 15 s, and then store for later use after visually verifying complete mixing. Check the cups for homogenous mixing by looking for dark blue clumps. Allow the cups to come to room temperature before moving to the refrigerator for storage up to one month.",
    "​NOTE: These cups can also be stored at room temperature once dosed, if needed, but take care to pay attention to drug efficacy guidance from the manufacturer. Dating the sticker helps with keeping track of the injection date without risking a pen or sharp marker puncturing the lid.\nWhen ready to use, wipe down the exterior of the cup with 70% EtOH. Peel off the lid and place the cup into the cage with the mice. Replace the cups every other day or when empty. One cup should be enough for up to five mice for 1-2 days.\n2. Preoperative preparation\nNOTE: This step will occur 2-3 days prior to the injection.\nAnesthetize the mouse using an isoflurane vaporizer (2%-3% isoflurane, 1.5 L/min of oxygen) and apply eye lubricant. Maintain anesthesia at 1%-3% isoflurane as needed throughout the procedure with a nose cone while carefully monitoring the respiratory rate of the animal.\nApply the eye lubricant to the mouse eyes while at the nose cone, and then position the mouse on its back. Use a cotton tipped applicator to apply over-the-counter depilatory cream to the nipple area (the area of the mammary gland that will be injected). Rub the cream into the area for 10-30 s with the applicator to help loosen the fur quickly.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave the cream on the animal any longer than necessary and remove completely to avoid burning the skin.",
    "After 10-30 s of the application, use warm water on gauze to completely remove the cream and loosen the fur from the animal. Perform at least two to four rinses of the area with fresh gauze for cream removal before drying with a clean dry gauze after the final rinse. Check the area of fur removal to confirm good visibility and access to the nipples. Repeat with depilatory cream application if necessary.\nPlace the mouse in a separate clean, dry recovery cage on a heating pad to recover from anesthesia. Observe the mouse until it has fully recovered from anesthesia and return it to the home cage.\nProvide mice with one cup of sucralose gel solution containing carprofen (1 mg/cup) for pre-dosing of the anti-inflammatory agent after recovery. One cup can provide up to five mice with carprofen for up to 2 days. Check the cup daily and replace as needed, or every other day if not fully consumed.\n3. Intraductal injection\nNOTE: This step will occur 2-3 days after preoperative preparation.\nPrepare 333.3 mM tantalum oxide (TaOx) stock solution from procured powder formulation as described in16 using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Use gentle warmth if the powder does not fully dissolve into the solution.\nMake an ablative imaging solution by mixing three parts stock TaOx with seven parts 100% EtOH for a final 70% EtOH 100mM TaOx solution. Add 1% v/v blue food dye to the final solution for aided visualization during injection. Prepare a volume based on need for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Gland pairs 1 and 5 can hold up to 30 µL of the solution while all other pairs can be injected with up to 50 μL in 9 weeks of age or older FVB mice.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane as in preoperative preparation and move the mouse to the nose cone once fully anesthetized. Apply eye lubricant before placing the animal on its back for the injection. Secure the mouse beneath the stereoscope using tape, if needed.\nPrepare the syringe with the desired volume of injection solution. Load 21-51 µL of the injection solution into a 50 µL syringe with a 34 G needle attached. Load an extra 1 µL of the solution to account for the potential leakage of that volume after the needle is removed from the nipple.\n\tNOTE: Volumes above are for the typical procedures presented here. One may inject any volume desired with the understanding that most glands will be overfilled if going above 30 μL or 50 μL in gland pairs 1 and 5, or 2-4, respectively. It is helpful to fill the needle with additional volume of the injection solution to test for the free flow of the solution immediately prior to the injection. If injecting more than one mammary gland, prefill multiple syringes to save time. However, do not leave the solution in the syringe for long.\nPrepare the nipples for the injection by removing any dead skin that covers the nipple opening with fine pointed forceps.\nHold the nipple gently with tweezers. With the bevel of the needle visible, insert the needle into the nipple opening until the bevel is fully covered with guidance help from fine tipped forceps. It may be necessary to pull up the nipple onto the needle rather than pushing the needle into the nipple (Table 1).",
    "Once the needle bevel is fully surrounded by the nipple and is in the main duct, begin injecting the solution at a steady rate of approximately 40 µL/min. Avoid injecting too quickly to ensure that the ductal tree is not damaged. Keep the needle in the nipple for 30 s after the volume is completely injected before removing the needle with assistance using the forceps. This is done to avoid the solution spilling out of the nipple (Figure 2).\n\t\nAssess the area for any signs of unsuccessful injection. A domed appearance may indicate a fat pad injection or trauma to the area.\nProceed to inject the remaining mammary glands.\nWhile the animal is still anesthetized, inject 200-250 µL of 5% sucrose solution (up to 10 mL/kg) intraperitoneally to minimize the potential effects of alcohol intoxication.\n4. micro-CT imaging\nAfter injecting all the desired glands, move the animal swiftly to the micro-CT system and continue to maintain anesthesia using the incorporated isoflurane vaporizer. The animal may be taped to standardize the imaging position. For example, taping each hind leg in an extended position helps to keep the leg bones of the animal further from the lower glands of interest in the resultant image.\n\tNOTE: The animals can be imaged using different scan parameters for the visualization of the ductal tree if care is taken to determine an appropriate acceptable lifetime dose of radiation for the animal and the cumulative doses do not exceed this level. Fluoroscopy stills and videos can be generated without performing scans to further reduce radiation exposure (Figure 2).\nPosition the mouse in the appropriate field of view with the fluoroscopy preview function.",
    "Perform TaOx imaging of the mouse ductal tree with good resolution and opportunity for repeated standard (2 min) acquisition scans. Use the following scan parameters: 90 kVp/88 µA; field of view (FOV), 36 mm; number of slices, 512; slice thickness, 72 µm; voxel resolution, 72 µm3.\n\t\nAcquire longer (4 or 14 min) high resolution scans for even better resolution in animals. These are acceptable as terminal procedures before euthanasia. These are, however, not acceptable for animals to be scanned longitudinally using the same parameters as it will cause radiation sickness.\nFollowing imaging protocol completion, remove the animal from anesthesia and transfer to a separate clean, dry recovery cage on a heating pad. Observe the animal until fully recovered, and then return it to the home cage. Keep the animals injected with ablative solution on carprofen until 7 days after injection.\nMake quick renditions of any scanned images within the micro-CT software (built in system) to better appreciate any contrast leaks or lack of filling (Figure 2) without formal analysis.\nPerform further formal image analysis for publication or detailed analysis of scans that allow segmentation of the area of interest if desired (Figure 3).\n\t​NOTE: The primary difference between these methods will be the ability to threshold only the ductal tree (formal rendition) versus needing to threshold the entire image (quick rendition). Other measurements and images may be generated using the software packages to best demonstrate the success of ductal tree filling.\n5. Image analysis\nPerform rendering of the injected ductal tree using a specialized software package. To do this, segment out the mammary fat pad with further image processing.",
    "To segment the fat pad (darker compartment compared to peritoneal cavity, femoral muscles, and skin) within which the ductal tree of interest is contained, select the Spline Trace option from the manual menu. Trace the fat pad outline at every third data slice.\nClick on Propagate Objects option from the semi-automatic menu to connect all the traced and untraced slices into a single object.\nSelect the Threshold Volume option from the semi-automatic menu to input the desired HU range (300-3,000 HU is a good starting point), and then click on Threshold Rendition button to create a rendition that only displays the contrast (TaOx) within the ductal tree and eliminates soft tissue.\nToggle the View button to Rendition as Primary to view only the 3D rendition without surrounding structures.\n\tNOTE: Additional software features allow for measurements to be made of the 3D rendition (i.e., length, volume, etc.)."
