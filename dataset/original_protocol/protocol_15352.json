    "1. Tissue preparation\nMicrotomy\n \nSection formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor blocks at 4 μm thickness using a rotary microtome.\nPlace the sections onto positively charged microscopic slides.\nIncubate slides in a 37 °C oven overnight.\nStorage\n \nStore sections in a -18 °C to -25 °C freezer, in order to prevent loss of antigenicity.\n2. Immunofluorescence of tissue sections\nDewaxing and Rehydration\n \nDewax slides in xylene twice for 5 min.\nRehydrate slides in 99%, 99%, 80%, 50% of ethanol and running tap water for 2 min of each in order.\nAntigen Retrieval\n \nPerform the heat induced antigen retrieval, using 0.15 mM Sodium Citrate, pH 6.0 buffer in a pressure cooker for 5 min in the microwave.\nCool down slides for 20 min.\nRinse slides in 0.05% PBST for 5 min on the rocker.\nBlocking procedure\n \nTreat sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.\nRinse slides in 0.05% PBST for 5 min on the rocker.\nAdd the sections to Sequenza Immunostaining rack.\nTreat sections in Serum free protein block for 10 min.\nPrimary antibody incubation\n \nIncubate Primary antibody diluted to optimal dilution in Dako antibody diluent for 1 hour at room temperature.\nRinse in 0.05% PBST three times for 5 min each.\nEpithelial mask (Cytokeratin) incubation\n \nIncubate mouse anti-pan cytokeratin, diluted 1:50 in Dako antibody diluent overnight at 4 °C.\nEpithelial mask visualization\n \nPrepare a 1:25 dilution of the goat anti-mouse Alexa555 secondary antibody in the pre-diluted Envision goat-rabbit HRP antibody solution.

    "Combine Target signal amplification diluent (HistoRx tub E) and the Cy5 Tyramide (HistoRx tube F) at 1:50 concentration. Vortex to mix thoroughly. Incubate slides in the dark for 10 min at room temperature.\nRinse in 0.05% PBST three times for 5 min each.\nDehydrate slides in 80% ethanol for 1 min.\nAir dry slides in the dark.\nCounterstaining and coverslipping\n \nApply DAPI mounting medium on the coverslips and place the coverslips over the tissue sections.\nDry slides overnight in the dark.\nAfter the slides have dried, secure with nail polish to ensure long term preservation and keep in a 4 °C refrigerator.\n3. Image capture using whole section scanning\nLoad up to five slides in the slide cassette of the Aperio ScanScope FL slide scanner.\nFor each slide, select the general region to image using the interface in the ScanScope Console. Select the region to encompass all the tissue on the slide, regardless of staining pattern or other observable aspects of the sample.\nUsing the ScanScope Console, for each channel (DAPI, Cy3 and Cy5) determine an optimal exposure as follows:\n \nSelect a region of tissue to interrogate - this area should, ideally, be in the tumor region of tissue to provide the best representation.\nUsing the ScanScope Console autoexposure feature, evaluate the exposure time suggested for each channel, along with image focus.\nRepeat over up to 3-5 regions of each sample to confirm stability of the value.\nSelect an additional region (as shown by a blue diamond on the ScanScope console image) away from the tissue, yet still within the coverslipped region of the slide, to define a background area where flat field correction images will be acquired for each filter.",
    "Review these images prior to image acquisition. If the images appear to have high background or other image artifacts, the image region should be moved and new images acquired.\nThe acquired digital slide images are uploaded automatically into the Aperio Spectrum database.\n4. AQUA automated image analysis\nView the digital whole slide images in the Spectrum database and annotate tumor areas of interest in the context of the entire tissue and staining pattern(s).\nSelect the slide to analyze using AQUAnalysis from the digital slide list in the Spectrum database by double clicking the thumbnail image (alternatively, select the check box next to the image and then select 'View Images' from the menu at the top of the list). This automatically opens the ImageScope software and color merged image of the tissue sample.\nUse this software to navigate the image using the tools provided.\nUsing the accompanying H&E (either the physical slide or an annotated image), annotate the region of interest on the fluorescent image. Multiple regions of interest, individual circled areas, can be selected on a single sample. There is also a 'negative' tool which is used to exclude areas within a selected region (i.e. damaged tissue, areas of poor histology, non-tumor areas, debris, etc.).\nSave the annotation layer(s) on the image.\nReturn to the Spectrum main menu and select the check box next to the image that was just annotated. Select 'Analyze' from the menu strip across the top of the list.\nIn the Analysis window which will come up, select \"HistoRx AQUA Analysis\" from the pull-down menu.\nIf there are multiple layers of annotations, use the check boxes to select the appropriate layer(s) for analysis.\nPress the 'Analyze' button when ready to begin.",
    "At this point, a minimized console window will appear in the Windows taskbar. This will display the progress of the transfer of images from the Spectrum database to the local PC (the 'pull' operation).\nOnce the data is transferred, AQUAnalysis will launch. The user can then use all of the internal functions of the software to view, navigate and analyze images.\nThe annotated region of the image from the Spectrum database is broken into 512x512 pixel image tiles - each of which will be scored individually.\nFor this study, an unsupervised AQUA scoring algorithm, based on data clustering, was used8. In this algorithm, AQUA scores are generated as follows:\n \nThe pan-cytokeratin image signal is thresholded above background and those pixels are used to define a tumor 'mask' which is then used for subsequent calculations. The high -expression pan-cytokeratin pixels also define the cytoplasmic/non-nuclear regions of the tumor cells.\nPixels with high signal in the DAPI channel that are within the tumor mask are identified as nuclear in nature.\nThe clustering algorithm also examines pixels which have low intensity for either DAPI staining or cytokeratin expression and attempts to partially attribute them to either the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments, or background.\nOnce all pixels are assigned to one of the tumor compartments or background, the intensity of signal from the target protein (ER or HER2) is then calculated within each of the compartments and normalized to the size of the compartments, thus producing AQUA scores.\nImages which did not have sufficient tumor representation were not scored (as defined by those with less than 5% of pixels representing tumor). These regions also produce a 'Final Result' value called 'Fail' and can thus be removed in subsequent statistical analyses.",
    "Additionally, if upon review, an operator identified fields which were not suitable for scoring due to sample or imaging artifacts (e.g. folded tissue, debris), those fields were redacted from scoring and produced a 'Final Result' called 'Fail'.\nThe results of AQUA scoring are tables of scores associated with each 512x512 pixel tile in the region of interest within a whole tissue section sample. These files, in .CSV format, can then be used for subsequent statistical analysis.\n5. Statistical Analysis: All statistical analyses are performed in SPSS (IBM)\nWhere possible, for large operations, generate SPSS syntax code files (.sps) to perform data manipulations and analysis steps. Example syntax code is provided as supplementary files.\nRead data files into SPSS. Remove unused variables in the raw data (e.g. instrument specific parameters, AQUA scores from non-utilized compartments).\nWhere regions have a 'Final Result' of 'Fail' (see above), mark these values as SYSMIS, which removes them from the numerical analyses.\nAggregate all data for all slides for each marker (ER or HER2) into a single master data set in SPSS format. Use this master file for all subsequent calculations.\nUsing an SPSS syntax file (one for each marker: ER or HER2 (see supplementary syntax files) data was further validated and Simpson's Indices of diversity calculated as follows:\n \nGenerate a master analytical file, in order to prevent modification of the master data set previously generated.\nValidate the master data set against the raw data and images generated.\nProduce summary statistics for AQUA scores for each sample (count of fields, mean score, median score, minimum score, maximum score, and standard deviation of scores for sample).\nCheck a random sample of results against the original raw data output files and against the raw image data scored.",
    "To generate the heat map images (shown in Figures 2 and 3):\n \n'Bin' the AQUA score data (using the 'Visual Binning' function in SPSS) into eight individual levels. For ER, nuclear scores were used, for HER2, cytoplasmic scores were used.\nDerive bins such that each bin represents an equal percentage of available cases from the entire data set.\nUse the SPSS function 'Split File' so that all subsequent output would be on a 'per slide/sample' level.\nPlot each region (corresponding to a 512x512 tile) by its x,y coordinates and color with a value corresponding to the bin into which it was allocated (see figures 2 and 3).\nTo generate heterogeneity scores, code was written to generate a Simpson's index of diversity using AQUA scores.\n \nThe Simpson's index of diversity, as used here, is defined as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3334/3334eq1.jpg\n  Where N is the total number of scores/fields used for a given sample and n is the number of scores/fields in a given group of standardized scores (produced as described below).\nUse the master analytical file described above for data source. In the examples shown, all ER calculations used the nuclear AQUA score and HER2 calculations used the cytoplasmic AQUA score. Perform the calculations below for each sample/slide.\nSince fluorescence data is subject to variance instability, such that error magnitude propagates with intensity, apply logarithmic (base 2) normalization to all AQUA scores.\nFurther transform the normalized (log transformed) data into z-(standard) scores.\n \nThe Z-score transformation is calculated as follows: Z = (AQUA score - average of all scores for a sample)/standard deviation of scores for the sample. This translates the distribution of scores into a distribution of deviations around the central value of zero deviation.",
    "Bin these Z-score values into six groups (<-2, -2 - -1, -1 - 0, 0 - 1, 1 - 2, >2).\nCalculate the number of values allocated into each bin and sum for each bin. Use this value, along with the total number of fields, to calculate a value for each of the six bins used for the index.\nSum these values and subtract from one to produce the index of diversity.\nThe diversity index provides an indicator of the spread of scores around the mean for a particular sample. Thus, higher indices indicate a broader spread of scores, or increased heterogeneity of expression. Conversely, lower indices, indicate less variation in expression measurement and homogeneous expression in the sample. This is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.\n6. Representative Results:",
    "Targeted therapy with relatively low toxicity agents, such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab, are not standard of care for ovarian cancer patients. There is good evidence that platinum-taxane first-line chemotherapy is superior to other chemotherapy regimens for ovarian cancer9-13, and while 70-80% of patients initially respond, most will relapse and die of their disease. Measurement of biomarkers which might predict response to alternative therapies would be useful in selecting individualized therapy for each patient, and since chemotherapy exerts selection pressure on a tumor, surviving tumor cells may possess different characteristics and represent a subpopulation of the tumor before therapy; quantifying this change might therefore be useful. We applied our heterogeneity mapping approach to ER and HER2 expression in ovarian cancer specimens before and after chemotherapy, in order to measure quantitative changes in expression, and assess the relationship between biomarker expression before and after therapy. Both ER and HER2 demonstrate marked heterogeneity within individual tumors, and in some tumors, the Simpson's index changes after therapy from relatively high heterogeneity to low heterogeneity, represented by decreasing Simpson's index scores (see Figures 2 and 3). This supports the notion that clonal selection occurs in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; more importantly, this may be exploited using targeted therapy against the residual population, in order to better personalize therapy for cancer patients.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3334/3334fig1.jpg",

(A) x40 photomicrograph shows two adjacent areas of tumor with varying morphology. High power views (x200) reveal cells with cytoplasmic clearing and a solid pattern of growth in the upper part of the tumor (B), while the lower part of the tissue (C) has more homogeneous eosinophilic cytoplasm and a papillary growth pattern. This tumor would, however, be classified as serous papillary histological subtype for the purposes of further management.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3334/3334fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
