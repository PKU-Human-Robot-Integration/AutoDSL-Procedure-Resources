    "The procedures hereby depicted did not undergo ethical approval since cat ovaries were collected at veterinary clinics as byproducts from owner-requested routine ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy.\n1. Oocyte collection\nBefore starting the experiments, prepare solutions for ovary and oocyte collection. Prepare ovary collection solution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with a mixture of antibiotics and antimycotics (100 IU/mL of penicillin G sodium, 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin sulphate, 0.25 μg/mL of amphotericin B). Prepare oocyte collection solution (i.e., PBS/PVA) with PBS with 100 IU/mL of penicillin G sodium, 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin sulphate and 0.1% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).\nStore solutions for ovary and oocyte collection at 4 °C until use.\nOn the day of queens’ spaying, a few hours before processing the samples, take part of ovary and oocyte collection solutions and let them warm up at room temperature (RT; 25 ± 2 °C).\nWhen samples arrive to the lab, isolate the ovaries from the surrounding connective tissue and from the oviduct and wash them in fresh ovary collection medium in a Petri dish.\nFill one 35 mm Petri dish for each queen with about 3 mL of RT PBS/PVA, and one more dish to collect the oocytes.\nPlace a pair of ovaries in a Petri dish and mince the cortex with a surgical scalpel. Ensure all the follicles have been broken with the help of a stereomicroscope (magnification 8x).\nCollect COCs with a pipette and move them in fresh PBS/PVA in the allocated Petri dish. Select good qualities COCs, with a homogenous, dark cytoplasm and surrounded by several compact layers of cumulus cells (grade I18).\n2. Vitrification\nPrepare equilibration and vitrification media.\n\t\nPrepare equilibration solution (ES) with 7.5% (v/v) ethylene glycol (EG) and 7.5% (v/v) dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) in Medium 199, with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS).",
    "Prepare vitrification solution (VS) with 15% (v/v) EG, 15% (v/v) DMSO and 0.5 M sucrose in Medium 199, with 20% FBS (modified from 19).\nLet ES and VS warm up at RT before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Cryoprotectants (e.g., EG, DMSO) are known to be cytotoxic. A strategy to counter their toxicity is to reduce the temperature at which the cells are exposed to them20, and oocytes are usually exposed to cryoprotectants at RT. Thus, the whole procedure, from oocyte collection to vitrification, is carried out at RT in this protocol to avoid temperature fluctuations.\nPrepare the vitrification dish (i.e., a special dish consisting of six conical wells divided in two rows, known as “Repro plate”). Prepare one row (three wells) for each vitrification support.\n\t\nAdd 20 µL of ES on the bottom of the first well.\nAdd 300 µL of VS on the bottom of the second (i.e., 1VS) and third (i.e., 2VS) wells.\nEquilibrate COCs in ES.\n\t\nWith a small-bore pipette (e.g., a Pasteur pipette pulled on a Bunsen beak to make it thinner – diameter should be at least 200 µm), transfer one (or more) COC(s) on the bottom of the first well.\n\t\tNOTE: Choose the size of the pipette according to the number of layers of cumulus cells surrounding the oocytes, so to COCs dimensions, aiming to reduce as much as possible the volume of media which is transferred with COCs in each step. With the present protocol, trained operators can vitrify successfully up to eight feline COCs per each vitrification support.\nSlowly add 20 µL of ES on the border of the drop. Wait for 3 minutes.\nSlowly add other 20 µL of ES on the border of the drop. Wait for 3 minutes.",
    "Slowly add 240 µL of ES on the border of the drop. Wait for 9 minutes.\nWhile waiting, prepare a box with liquid nitrogen (LN2), label a vitrification support with the experiment/cat identification code and leave it open. Put both of them near the stereomicroscope, so that they can be easily reachable while working.\n\t\tCAUTION! Wear personal protective equipment when handling LN2.\nAlternatively, if several COCs have to be vitrified, begin the first equilibration step (see step 2.3.1 - 2.3.2) for another group of COCs (which will be loaded onto a new vitrification support).\nVitrify COCs in VS in less than 90 seconds.\n\t\nUsing the same small-bore pipette, fill it with 1VS, take the COCs from the bottom of the first well (ES) and move them to the surface of the second well (1VS).\nWash the pipette with 1VS.\nTake the COCs and move them in another area (on the bottom) of the well; mix the medium surrounding them with the pipette.\nFill the pipette with 1VS in another area of the well, take the COCs, move them and mix the medium surrounding them with the pipette.\nRepeat step 2.4.4.\nWash the pipette with 2VS.\nTake the COCs and move them on the bottom of the third well (2VS); mix the medium surrounding them with the pipette.\nFill the pipette with 2VS in another area of the well, take the COCs, move them and mix the medium surrounding them with the pipette.\nRepeat step 2.4.8.\nFill the pipette with 2VS in another area of the well, take the COCs and load them on the strip of the vitrification support, as close as possible to the tip. Aspirate excess medium to reduce the volume of VS as much as possible.",
    "Immediately plunge the vitrification support in LN2, moving it. Close it with the help of some clamps, making sure it always remains immersed in LN2.\n\t\tNOTE: Keeping the right timing is crucial due to cryoprotectant cell-toxicity. Because of their high concentration in vitrification media, cell exposure needs to be controlled, also by flawless execution of the technique21. If samples are abundant, consider dividing them to process them more quickly and minimize the amount of time from oocyte collection to vitrification.\nStore the loaded vitrification supports in a goblet and keep them in a storage LN2 tank until warming.\n\tNOTE: All the previous steps of the protocol can also be applied in field conditions if LN2 is available. A dry shipper will be necessary to transport the samples to the lab safely and then proceed there with the following phases.\n3. Warming\nPrepare warming media.\n\t\nPrepare thawing solution (TS) with 1 M sucrose in Medium 199, with 20% FBS.\nPrepare dilution solution (DS) with 0.5 M sucrose in Medium 199, with 20% FBS.\nPrepare washing solution (WS) with Medium 199 with 20% FBS.\nBefore use, warm up TS to 38 °C and DS and WS at RT.\nIf necessary, prepare the culture medium for the subsequent use of warmed COCs (e.g., in vitro maturation, IVM).\nPlace the heating stage close to the stereomicroscope and turn it on (38 °C). Put the lid of a Petri dish to warm up.\nWhen everything is ready, transfer the vitrification supports which must be warmed from the storage tank to a box with LN2, and put the box near the stereomicroscope.\nPrepare the “Repro plate”. Prepare a row for each vitrification support that has to be warmed.\n\t\nAdd 300 µL of DS on the bottom of the first well.",
    "Add 300 µL of WS on the bottom of the second (i.e., 1WS) and third (i.e., 2WS) wells.\nMake a drop of TS (100 µL) on the lid of the Petri dish.\nWith clamps, open one vitrification support in the LN2.\nPut the TS drop under the stereomicroscope and with one fast movement take the vitrification support from the LN2 and immerse its strip in the drop, moving it until all COCs detach. Remove the support from the drop as soon as it is empty, but leave the COCs in TS for 1 minute in total (from immersion until the following step).\nTake a pipette similar to that used for vitrification and fill it with DS. Take the COCs from the drop (TS) and move them to the bottom of the first well (DS). Wait for 3 minutes.\nWash the pipette with 1WS. Take the COCs and move them on the bottom of the second well (1WS). Wait for 5 minutes.\nWash the pipette with 2WS. Take the COCs and move them on the surface of the third well (2WS). Wait for them to touch the bottom of the well.\nRepeat step 3.11 using another area of the well.\nWash the pipette with culture medium and move the oocytes to the culture dish for the following use (e.g., IVM).\nSubscription Required.
