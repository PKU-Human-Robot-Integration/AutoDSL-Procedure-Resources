    "NOTE: The following protocol describes the pHluorin imaging methods and EM methods used in cultured hippocampal neurons. pHluorin monitors synaptic vesicle protein uptake in living cells and EM detects uptake of synaptic vesicle and ultrastructural changes.\nAnimal care and procedure followed NIH guidelines and were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. pHluorin Imaging\nHippocampal neuron culture\nPrepare Hippocampus Buffer (HB) by combining 4 mM NaHCO3 and 5 mM HEPES and adjust to pH 7.3 with 5 M NaOH. Make the culture medium by mixing neurobasal medium, 2% B27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Additionally, prepare a mixture of HB buffer with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (HB/20% FBS).\n\t\tNOTE: This culturing protocol is based on Sankaranarayanan, et al.29 and Wu, et al.24\nDecapitate mouse pups between postnatal day 0 to day 2 into culture medium, and extract the brain into 4 °C HB/20% FBS. Remove the brainstem and thalamus to expose the hippocampi. Dissect out the hippocampi, after exposing it by removal of the brainstem and thalamus, and transfer to fresh 4 °C HB/20% FBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, yield is around 4 x 105 cells/mL for one pup (two hippocampi). Clean off the adhering membranes using tweezers or scissors, then transfer to fresh 4 °C HB/20% FBS. Unroll the dentate gyrus and isolate the subiculum by cutting with scissors, then transfer to fresh 4 °C HB/20% FBS.\nDivide each hippocampus, by cutting from end to end, into about 10 slices and transfer them to a 15 mL polypropylene conical tube.\nAfter allowing the tissue to settle, wash with 10 mL of HB/20% FBS, and then wash three times with 10 mL of HB.",
    "Prepare digestion solution of 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4, and 25 mM HEPES, and adjust to pH 7.2 with 5 M NaOH. Remove the supernatant from the hippocampi. Add 10 mg of trypsin and 1 mg of DNase to 2 mL of digestion solution, and filter through a sterile 0.22 µm membrane directly onto the sample pellet.\nIncubate the hippocampi for 5 min at 37 °C, then wash twice with 10 mL of HB/20% FBS, and then wash once with 10 mL of HB.\nDissociate the cells with 6 mg of MgSO4∙7H2O and 1 mg of DNase to 2 mL HB and sterile filter onto the hippocampi pellet through a sterile 0.22 µm filter. Gently dissociate the cells by careful triturating, while taking care to avoid introducing air bubbles. Allow tissue particulates to settle for 2 min, and then slowly transfer the supernatant to another tube.\nAdd 3 mL HB/20% FBS to the cell suspension, and centrifuge or 10 min at 4 °C and 1,000 rpm. Discard the supernatant and resuspend in culture medium.\nPlate 60,000 cells suspended in 150 µL culture medium on a Poly-D-Lysine coated 25-mm diameter coverslip, without spill off the coverslip. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed culture medium 2 h after plating. Coverslips are maintained in 6-well culturing plates or sterile Petri dishes.\nMaintain cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in culture medium for 14-21 days prior to recording. During the culture growth, change the top half of the medium twice a week.\nTransfection\n6-7 days after plating, transfect synaptophysin-pHluorin 2X (SpH) or VAMP2-pHluorin into hippocampal neurons. For SpH, use a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, inserted into a pcDNA3 vector30. For VAMP2-pHluorin, use a CMV promoter inserted into a pCI vector31.",
    "Transfect either vector by lipid carrier into target cells, using 1 µg of plasmid. Use culture medium from protocol step 1.1.1, which lacks serum, for the transfection. Change the medium 2 h after transfection to reduce toxicity.\n\t\tNOTE: In case of low expression of SpH in the boutons, increase the DNA concentration to 2 µg or the incubation time with the lipid carrier, unless the cells are unhealthy. Typically, 4-10 cells (0.006-0.008%) of neurons were transfected.\nLight microscopy\nPrepare normal saline solution composed of 119 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 30 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and 0.05 mM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5). Take a coverslip from the culture medium plate and place on an imaging chamber that allows field stimulation, using lubricant and sealant to avoid leaks. Avoid letting the glass dry during the transfer of a coverslip from the plate to the chamber by immediately adding 750 µL normal saline solution.\n\t\tNOTE: CNQX and AP5 were used to block postsynaptic activity, which has the potential for recurrent activity. Before placing a chamber on an inverted fluorescence microscope, use cleaning tissue to confirm that the chamber does not leak. Slow leaking causes focus changes during the recording by the mixing of normal saline and immersion oil, which results in changes in the refractive index.\nStimulation and recording\n\t\t\nImage on an inverted widefield microscope with a 60X (1.4 numerical aperture) oil immersion lens with a metal halide lamp. Visualize pHluorin with a filter set for an excitation peak of 480 nm, a 490 nm long pass mirror, a 500-550 nm emission filter, and a manual flip shutter. Capture images every 100 ms, with 2 x 2 binning, using an Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera.",
    "NOTE: Several features should be considered to achieve the proper conditions to avoid photobleaching, including the image capture interval, and filter and binning, which are dependent on equipment. In the case of confocal imaging, laser power and exposure time should be considered to avoid photobleaching. The setup was determined after recording at least 3 min without stimulus and the recording was performed for at least 10 s without stimulus to check for photobleaching.\nChoose an area with a high density of boutons for ease of analysis in each experiment. Identify transfected cells by their green fluorescence signal, with emphasis on round or oval expression patterns in the bouton and continuous expression between boutons.\nInduce endocytosis by field stimulation using a 1 ms pulse, 20 mA action potential (AP) supplied from a pulse stimulator and delivered through a platinum electrode within the stimulus isolation unit. Image fluorescence activity over the course of the stimulation and during cell recovery.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the case of dead cells, expression was stronger than living boutons and showed a patchy pattern between boutons.\nImage analysis\nFor analyzing the fluorescence intensity in a single bouton, set up a Region of Interest (ROI) as a 1.5 x 1.5 µm square; the size of a bouton is within about 1.5 µm. Use traces prior to stimulation to check for photobleaching and subtract as background.\nNormalize fluorescence change (ΔF) with the equation: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55862/55862eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere Fmax and F0 refer to maximal increase after stimulation and baseline fluorescence, respectively. Measure endocytosis rates as the rate of decay during the first 4-10 s after the maximum point of pHluorin fluorescence. Obtain the time constant (τ) of endocytosis by fitting the pHluorin fluorescence decay from the peak increase to the baseline with a mono-exponential function.\n2. Electron Microscopy",
    "Prepare a Poly-D-Lysine coated 6-well plate by applying 1.5 mL of 0.01% sterile-filtered Poly-D-Lysine solution to each well for 1 h at room temperature, then washing three times with sterilized water. Dissect, culture, and maintain hippocampal neurons as in steps 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3, respectively.\nPrepare a high K+ stimulation solution with HRP as 31.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 90 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 30 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01 mM CNQX, 0.05 mM AP5, and 5 mg/mL HRP, then adjust to pH 7.4 with 5 M NaOH.\nStimulate the hippocampal neuron culture with 1.5 mL high K+ stimulation solution at room temperature (referred to as K+) by addition of 1.5 mL to each well for 90 s. In the resting condition (referred to as R), apply the same concentration of 5 mg/mL HRP for 90 s, but with normal saline solution. For the recovery sample, apply high K+ stimulation solution as with the K+ sample, then rapidly wash and replace with normal saline and incubate for 10 min.\nFixation and staining\nPrepare 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer using 21.4 g/L Na cacodylate at pH 7.4. Fix cells with 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer for at least 1 h at room temperature. Wash three times with 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer for 7 min each.\nPrepare Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution, comprised of 0.5 mg/mL of DAB with 0.3% H2O2 in ddH2O, and filter with a 0.22 µm filter. Apply 1.5 mL DAB solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Wash three times with 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer for 7 min each.\n\t\tCAUTION: DAB is a toxic and suspected carcinogen. Please use gloves and lab coats.",
    "NOTE: Labeling with DAB occurs due to its oxidation by H2O2, as catalyzed by HRP. Small increases in the components result in an increased signal in the sample. Increasing the concentration of HRP speeds up the effect of the catalyst. Sufficiently large concentrations of H2O2 allow for debilitating side reactions with HRP, inhibiting the effect of labeling32. In this work, the concentrations of this labeling system were chosen based on currently available research33,34.\nIncubate the neurons with 1.5 mL of 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C as post fixation. Wash three times with 1.5 mL of 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer for 7 min each.\n\t\tCAUTION: Due to the toxicity and reactivity of OsO4, keeping the sample on ice in a chemical hood is preferable in many cases to using a fridge for the incubation.\nPrepare 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer with 13.61 g/L sodium acetate and 11.43 mL/L glacial acetic acid at pH 5.0. Wash three times with 1.5 mL 0.1 M acetate buffer at pH 5.0 for 7 min each and incubate with 1.5 mL 1% uranyl acetate in 0.1 M acetate buffer at pH 5.0 for 1 h at 4 °C. Wash three times with 1.5 mL 0.1 M acetate buffer for 7 min each.\nEpoxy embedding\nDehydrate the neuron culture with single 1.5 mL washes of 50%, 70%, and 90% ethanol, for 7 min in each and then 3 washes of 1.5 mL 100% ethanol for 7 min each in a fume hood.\nMix 485 mL/L bisphenol-A-(epichlorhydrin) epoxy resin, 160 mL/L dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA), 340 mL/L Methyl-5-Norbornene-2,3-Dicarboxylic Anhydride (NMA), and 15 mL/L 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol (DMP-30) to create the epoxy resin. Mix thoroughly, then store under vacuum to remove air bubbles.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to remove air bubbles in the resin, especially those smaller than visible to the naked eye, because they can cause cavities in the resin during sectioning.\nInfiltrate the sample by replacing the ethanol with 50% epoxy resin in ethanol for 30 min at room temperature on a shaker, then 70% epoxy resin in ethanol for 30 min at room temperature on a shaker.\nSwitch the epoxy resin solution with 100% epoxy resin and incubate for 10 min at 50 °C. Perform two exchanges of fresh 100% epoxy resin with incubations for 1 h at 50 °C. Add fresh 100% epoxy resin and allow to harden at 50 °C overnight and then at 60 °C for over 36 h to harden.\nRemove each sample from the muti-well plate with a jeweler's handsaw. Select regions of interest, dense concentrations of cells, using an inverted light microscope, and then cut 70 to 80 nm blocks for sectioning by microtome. Mount the cut region in the microtome chuck and load the microtome. Position the chuck in the microtome and mount a diamond knife with the edge parallel to the surface of the block. Collect sections of 70 to 80 nm thickness directly onto individual grids.\nDissolve uranyl acetate into water for a 1% solution by weight, and separately dissolve lead citrate into water for a 3% solution by weight. Counterstain the sections by submersion with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 15 min and then 3% aqueous lead citrate for 5 min to improve the contrast of the samples.\nEM imaging\nExamine the sections with a transmission electron microscope and record images with a CCD digital camera at a primary magnification of 10,000-20,000X3.\nStatistics",
    "Perform a t-test to identify significant differences by comparing the mean and standard error of measurement (s.e.m.) between the control and experimental samples.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
