    "All of the procedures using animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University Hospital.\n1. Experimental Setup\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nAllow male Sprague-Dawley rats 1 week to adapt to their new environment before starting the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Although 8-week old rats were used in the present study, a developing or adult brain can be chosen according to the research hypotheses.\nInhalation anesthesia for induction\n\t\nInduce and maintain anesthesia with 5% and 2% of isoflurane dissolved in 40%/60% and 25%/75% oxygen/nitrogen via a chamber and nose cone, respectively. Adjust anesthesia depth to the level of abolishing the pedal withdrawal reflex to toe pinch to confirm proper anesthetization.\n\t\tNOTE: Using awoken animals can be a better choice in translational terms, but there are difficulty to restrain during rTMS and they are prone to excessive stress.\nMonitor body temperature with a rectal probe and maintain it at 37 °C by using a homeothermic blanket. Monitor anesthetic depth using pedal withdrawal reflex, temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate.\nSwitch-over to intravenous anesthesia for maintenance\n\t\nPrepare the tail with an alcohol swab. Catheterize a lateral tail vein with a 24-gauge venous catheter for transition to IV anesthesia (Figure 1A). Load propofol intravenously (1 mg/[kg·min] over 10 min, using 10 mg/ml emulsion) to the animals. Discontinue isoflurane 5 min after starting propofol loading.\nMaintain propofol sedation at an infusion rate of 500 - 700 µg/(kg·min) throughout the experiment, as in a previous study16. Supplement oxygen at 0.8 L/min via a nose cone.\n\t\tNOTE: Anesthesia with propofol is to reduce potential suppression of cortical excitability by the inhalation agent17-19. However, anesthesia is not mandatory in rTMS experiments, and awoken animals can also be used. Anesthesia methods should be decided in consideration of the research hypotheses.",
    "Use veterinary ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nApply magnetic stimulation (see Section2) 10 min after complete transition to i.v. anesthesia.\nRecovery conditions\n\t\nMonitor vital signs during recovery phase. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. If an animal has undergone surgery, do not return it to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\n\t\tNOTE: If surgery for a disease model is performed, post-surgical pain management is necessary. However, pain management is not needed for this rTMS experiment.\n2. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\nStimulator and coil\n\t\nApply stimulation by using a repetitive stimulator that delivers biphasic stimuli via a 25 mm figure-8 coil. Locate the center of the coil 0.5 cm lateral to the vertex on the biauricular line, and angulate the coil 45° to the ground.\n\t\tNOTE: The maximal magnetic field strength of the coil is 4.0 T. The magnetic coil is mounted firmly on a built-in holder.\nMotor threshold\n\t\nDetermine the motor threshold (MT) at the hot spot, with the center of the coil positioned 0.5 cm lateral to the vertex on the biauricular line and with the surface flat onto the calvaria. This is the same methodology used in a previous study20.\n\t\tNOTE: Define MT as the minimum stimulus intensity evoking 5 or more palpable contractions on the contralateral forepaw by 10 consecutive stimuli. Verify whether the stimulation is primarily causing contralateral muscle contraction to ensure unilateral stimulation.\nApplication of rTMS\n\t\nApply rTMS 10 min after stabilization of deep anesthesia. Place the center of the coil at the target rTMS site, selected from the cerebral cortices depending on research questions. Then, tilt the coil to ensure direct contact between the coil center and the surface of skull at the stimulation point.",
    "NOTE: For example, angulate the coil 45° to the ground to minimize a potential direct effect of rTMS on the contralateral cortex (Figure 1B and 1C).\nSubject the animals to a session of 20-min rTMS of the unilateral hemisphere. Using the software console, deliver rTMS with a low-frequency (1 Hz), high-frequency (20 Hz), or sham stimulation protocol, and set the stimulation intensity at 100 - 110% of the MT.\nPerform 1 Hz stimulation without rest. Using the software console input \"1,200\" shots for \"20\" min). For 20 Hz stimulation, conduct 2 sec of stimulation followed by 28 sec of rest. Using the software console input \"1,600\" shots for \"20\" min.\nFor sham stimulation, tilt the coil perpendicular (90° rotation) to the calvaria and place the coil edge 2 cm apart from head surface (Figure 1D). Fix the coil holder firmly to the main apparatus; there is no need to hold the coil by hand during the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: To compensate for acoustic and other non-specific effects, distinct sham protocols should be used for distinct stimulation protocols. For example, 1-Hz sham stimulation can be used for 1-Hz rTMS experiments.\nCooling the coil\n\t\nUse a water cooling system to enable repetitive magnetic stimulation for more than 20 min at 1- and 20-Hz stimulation frequencies (Figure 2). Circulate icy water surrounding the whole length of the coil during the experiment to prevent overheating, although the temperature of the coil or stimulator is not monitored.\n\t\tNOTE: Commercially available cooled rat coils can also be used.\nIf possible, monitor the coil temperature by viewing the heating gauge of the rTMS machine.  NOTE: There were no adverse consequences related to the rTMS stimulation. There is, however, a potential burn risk if metal ear identification tags are used near the stimulating coil.\n3. Micro Positron Emission Tomography",
    "Animal preparation\n\t\nConduct inhalation anesthesia for induction and i.v. anesthesia for maintenance (see step 1.2.1 and 1.3.1). Apply 1-Hz rTMS to an animal for 10 min at a stimulation intensity of 100-110% of the MT.\nFive minutes after finishing the rTMS stimulation, inject 1 mCi of 2-[F-18]fluoro-deoxyglucose (18FDG) dissolved in 0.5 ml of normal saline intravenously by using a tail vein catheter. Allow 30 min for 18FDG uptake. NOTE: Place the rat under anesthesia during the entire micro-PET experiment.\nImage analysis\n\t\nUse a PET scanner for brain imaging to reaffirm the unilaterality of the stimulation. Reconstruct images with a 3-D iterative algorithm. To assess the changes in metabolism induced by rTMS, identify regions of interest (ROIs) in the images of the transverse brain sections21.\nEuthanasia\n\t\nAfter performing micro-PET imaging, euthanize the rats in a chamber prefilled with carbon dioxide while the rats are in deep anesthesia.\n4. mRNA Microarray\nEuthanasia\n\t\nInduce and maintain anesthesia with 5% and 2% of isoflurane dissolved in 40%/60% and 25%/75% oxygen/nitrogen via a chamber and nose cone, respectively. Anesthetize deeply to the level of abolishing the pedal withdrawal reflex to toe pinch before being decapitated.\nDecapitate the rats for euthanasia 5 min after 1 session of 1-Hz rTMS.\nTissue harvest\n\t\nLay out materials and surgical instruments in the order of use, including folded paper towels, a bone rongeur, microscissors, larger surgical scissors, a microforcep, a No. 10 or 11 scalpel blade, a lidded 10-cm glass petri dish filled with ice, and 1.5-ml tubes. Prepare a plastic bag for disposal of carcass.",
    "Make a midline skin incision in the skull anterioposteriorly. Bluntly dissect the soft tissue and surrounding muscles with surgical scissors, and remove the skull bone piece using a bone rongeur. Quickly dissect the fresh brain carefully from the skull. Then, lay it on ice by using the microforceps and microscissors. Rinse the brain tissue in ice-cold normal saline.\nTransfer the brain to dry ice immediately, and subsequently store it at -80 °C in a tube until further processing.\nThaw the brain tissue before harvest.\nPlace the brain dorsal side up, and harvest the brain tissue from the stimulated cerebral cortex (around the hot spot in the primary motor cortex) on ice by using the microforceps and microscissors. Put the harvested tissue in the 1.5-ml tube.\nRNA preparation\n\t\nExtract total RNA from tissue homogenates using lysis reagent22. Process with DNase digestion and clean-up procedures. Quantify the RNA samples and aliquots and store them at -80 °C until use.\nFor quality control, evaluate RNA purity and integrity by denaturing gel electrophoresis, at a OD ratio of 260:280, and analyze them on a commercially available analyzer.\nLabeling and purification\n\t\nAmplify and purify total RNA by using a commercially available RNA amplification kit to yield biotinylated cRNA. Briefly, reverse-transcribe 550 ng of total RNA to cDNA by using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. Synthesize and in vitro transcribe the second-strand cDNA and then label it with biotin-NTP.\nAfter purification, quantify cDNA by using a spectrophotometer.\nHybridization and data export23\nUse the expression beadchip for mRNA expression analysis. Hybridize the labeled 750-ng cDNA samples to each rat-12 expression bead array for 16 - 18 hr at 58 °C. Carry out detection of array signal by using streptavidin-Cy3.\nScan arrays with a confocal scanner. Perform array data export processing and analysis by using a commercially available software.",
