    "1. Labeling of RNA probes by In Vitro Transcription\nAssemble in vitro transcription reaction in a 1.5 ml microtube under RNase-free conditions: 10.5 µl DEPC-treated H2O, 4.0 µl 5x transcription buffer, 1.0 µl (1 µg) linearized, purified template DNA in DEPC-treated H2O, 1.3 µl NTP mix, 0.7 µl hapten-labeled UTP, 0.5 µl RiboLock RNA inhibitor, 2.0 µl RNA polymerase.\n\tNote: The final reaction volume is 20 µl.\nDepending on the template's promoter sequence use T7, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerase for the in vitro transcription (see reference 17).\nSelect digoxigenin-11-UTP, biotin-16-UTP, or fluorescein-12-UTP as label for the RNA probe. For more details, see discussion of Hapten-labels and probe concentrations in the Discussion.\nMix transcription reaction and spin down shortly.\nLet transcribe for 3 hr at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 µl RNase-free DNase I to the transcription reaction for removal of template DNA, mix well, and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\nAdjust with DEPC-treated H2O the sample volume to 200 µl.\nAdd 100 µl (0.5 vol) 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 600 µl (3 vol) ethanol to precipitate labeled RNA probe. Incubate for 30 min at RT.\n\t\nDo not use ice-cold ethanol, as this may lead to unwanted precipitation of unincorporated nucleotides.\nSpin down the transcribed RNA in a temperature controlled centrifuge at maximum speed (20,800 x g) for 30 min at +20 °C. Carefully aspirate supernatant.\nWash the resulting pellet with 70% ethanol at RT and centrifuge at 20,800 x g for 10 min at +20 °C.\nRemove supernatant and be careful not to accidentally aspirate the loose pellet. Let pellet air dry in the microtube with opened lid for a few min at RT.\nDissolve the obtained pellet in 100 µl of DEPC-treated H2O.",
    "Add 300 µl pre-hybridization buffer (50% vol/vol deionized formamide, 5x SSC, 50 µg/ml heparin sodium salt, 0.1% vol/vol Tween-20, 5 mg/ml torula RNA) and store at -20 °C. Probes can be long-term stored at -20 °C.\n\tNote: For a first test of the newly transcribed probe dilute 3 µl hapten-labeled RNA probe in 100 µl hybridization buffer to obtain the final concentration for the WISH experiment.\n2. Processing of Embryo Samples Using Inserts\nNote: Using microtubes or multi-well plates for processing embryos through the different incubation steps bears the risk of losing significant amounts of embryos by accidentally aspirating them during exchange of solutions. To avoid this loss, it may be helpful to use baskets (such as Netwell inserts) for carrying embryo samples through the procedure. These are polystyrene inserts with a polyester mesh at the bottom (Figure 2A), on which the embryos rest during processing.\nFor processing embryos in the WISH procedure, assemble the inserts in a 12-well plate (Figure 2B) and add 2 ml of the appropriate solution to each well.\nPipette the embryos into the inserts using a blue tip. Make sure that all embryos are submerged in liquid.\nWhen incubation time is over place the embryo-containing inserts in another 12-well plate, which is filled with the solution for the next step.\n\t\nUse carriers and handles (Figure 2C) to transfer up to 12 samples at a time from one solution to another (Figure 2D).\n\t\tNote: To reduce the required volumes, use 2.0 ml microtubes for the pre-hybridization/hybridization steps (see STEP 4.1) and 24-well plates for the staining reactions (STEP 6.2). The hybridization and staining reactions are performed in volumes of 100 µl and 400 µl, respectively.\n3. Preparation of Embryos for Hybridization",
    "Collect, dechorionate, fix, and devitellinize embryos using standard procedures 14,18. The prepared embryos are routinely stored in methanol at -20 °C.\nTransfer embryos to be used for in situ hybridization to RT and distribute into the inserts of a 12-well plate filled with 2 ml methanol per well.\nRehydrate embryos through a decreasing methanol series at RT. Incubate embryos each time for 3 min in: (i) 75% methanol in 1x PBS (ii) 50% methanol in 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 (iii) 25% methanol in 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 (iv) 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 (v) 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20.\nPre-fix the embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS for 20 min at RT.\nRemove the fixative by 4 washes for 3 min in 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT. Meanwhile thaw and prepare proteinase K and glycine working solutions.\nPermeabilize embryos in fresh proteinase K (10 µg/ml to 50 µg/ml) in 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 for 3 min at RT.\n\tNote: The proteinase K treatment is balanced to the strength of embryo fixation. For example, if the pre-fixation step (3.4) is omitted, softer proteinase K treatment may be applied.\nStop the reaction by two 1 min rinses in 2 mg/ml glycine in 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT.\nPost-fix the embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS for 20 min at RT.\nSubsequently, remove paraformaldehyde fixative by washing four times for 3 min in 1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT.\nTransfer post-fixed embryos to pre-hybridization buffer. Store embryos in pre-hybridization buffer at -20 °C or directly proceed with hybridization of probes.\n4. Hybridization of Probes\nTransfer embryos stored at -20 °C in pre-hybridization buffer to RT. Distribute embryos in pre-hybridization buffer into 2.0 ml microtubes.\nFor 30 min at a minimum, pre-hybridize embryo samples at 65 °C in pre-hybridization buffer.",
    "Note: For pre-hybridization and hybridization steps a waterbath is used. During pre-hybridization there is time to prepare the probe mix by combining up to three antisense RNA probes, each specific for a different gene transcript and labeled with a different hapten.\nTo obtain the probe mix, add together appropriate amounts (usually between 1 µl to 6 µl) of each desired original hapten-labeled antisense RNA probe in 100 µl hybridization buffer (50% vol/vol deionized formamide, 5x SSC, 50 µg/ml heparin sodium salt, 0.1% vol/vol Tween-20, 5 mg/ml torula RNA, 5% wt/vol dextran sulfate).\n\tNote: The addition of dextran sulfate is optional.\nDenature the antisense RNA probe mix in a heat block at 80 °C for 5 min. Subsequently transfer the denatured probe mix directly to 65 °C.\nRemove most of the pre-hybridization buffer from the embryo samples and add the denatured probe mix.\nLet embryo samples hybridize to probe mix O/N at 65 °C.\n\tNote: Temperatures ranging between 55 °C and 65 °C are routinely used for hybridization, pre- and post-hybridization steps. Hybridization at 65 °C provides most stringent conditions and is recommended in case of background problems when using lower temperatures. If there are no background problems, hybridization at 55 °C is recommended, which provides the advantage of enhanced signal strength and improved embryo integrity.\nNext morning, first transfer the stringency wash solutions to 65 °C, to make sure that they are heated to the correct temperature in time.\nTransfer hybridization probe mix with embryos from the 2.0 ml microtubes into inserts of a 12-well plate containing 2 ml pre-warmed hybridization wash buffer (50% formamide in 2× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20). Place the 12-well plate containing the embryo samples in an oven and incubate for 20 min at 65 °C.",
    "Transfer embryo samples to 2 ml new hybridization wash buffer and incubate for 20 min at 65 °C. Repeat this step once more.\nRemove excess probe by 20 min washes at 65 °C, once in 2× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20 and three times in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20.\nTransfer the embryo samples to 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT.\nIncubate the embryos in blocking buffer (8% sheep serum in 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for at least 30 min at RT.\n5. Antibody Detection of Hapten-labeled Probes\nNote: In contrast to the simultaneous hybridization of all three differently labeled probes, each probe is detected one after another in separate rounds of antibody incubation and staining. Therefore, in each detection round only one antibody is used (either anti-digoxigenin-AP or anti-fluorescein-AP or anti-biotin-AP).\nChoose between STEP 5.1.1 to 5.1.3 and proceed with preparing the appropriate antibody dilution according to the hapten-label that is to be detected.\n\tNote: For sequential detection of the differently labeled probes, another anti-hapten-antibody is applied in each detection cycle.\n\t\nFor detection of a fluorescein-labeled probe dilute anti-fluorescein-AP conjugates 1:4,000 in blocking buffer.\nFor detection of a digoxigenin-labeled probe dilute anti-digoxigenin-AP conjugates 1:4,000 in blocking buffer.\nFor detection of a biotin-labeled probe prepare an anti-biotin-AP conjugate solution at a 1:4,000 dilution in blocking buffer.\nIncubate embryos in the selected anti-hapten-AP solution for 3 to 4 hr at RT. Alternatively, incubate O/N at 4 °C. Do not apply all three antibodies simultaneously.\nIn order to remove unbound antibody wash the embryos with 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 for 4 times 15 min at RT.\nTo change buffer systems wash two times 15 min at RT in TNT (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20).\n6. Alkaline Phosphatase Chromogenic Staining",
    "Subsequent to antibody detection choose between STEP 6.1.1 to 6.1.4 and proceed with one of the alkaline phosphatase chromogenic staining reactions to obtain the desired color signal (see Table 1). For each round of detection a different chromogenic substrate reaction is applied to highlight each transcript pattern in another color.\n\t\nFast Red Staining\n\t\t\nWash the embryos two times for 15 min in TT8.2 (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 0.1% Tween-20).\nWhile washing embryos, prepare the Fast Red staining solution from the Fast Red TR/NAMP Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Tablets Set.\nDissolve a buffer tablet from the tablet set in 1 ml distilled water and mix by vortexing to obtain 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2.\nDrop a Fast Red TR/NAMP tablet into the prepared Tris buffer and dissolve by vortexing to obtain the Fast Red staining solution.\nClear Fast Red staining solution from non-dissolved particles through a 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nFast Blue Staining\n\t\t\nWash embryos two times for 15 min in fresh SB8.2 staining buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20).\nWhile washing embryos, prepare the Fast Blue staining solution from 50 mg/ml Fast Blue BB (in DMF) and 50 mg/ml naphthol phosphate (in DMSO) stock solutions.\nFreshly prepare a Fast Blue BB solution at 0.5 mg/ml in SB8.2.\nFreshly prepare a separate naphthol phosphate solution at 0.5 mg/ml in SB8.2.\nDropwise add the prepared naphthol phosphate solution into the Fast Blue BB solution under constant mixing with a vortex. The resulting final working concentration is 0.25 mg/ml for both substrate components.\n\t\t\tNote: Different Fast Blue / naphthol phosphate combinations result in different color shades (see Table 1).\nBCIP/NBT Staining",
    "Wash embryos two times for 15 min in fresh SB9.5 staining buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20).\nFor a purpleblue chromogenic signal, freshly prepare BCIP/NBT staining solution by adding 1 µl levamisole, 3.5 µl BCIP and 4.5 µl NBT per ml of SB9.5 staining buffer and mix well.\nINT Staining\n\t\t\nWash the embryos two times for 15 min in fresh SB9.5 staining buffer.\nFor a yellowbrown chromogenic signal, freshly prepare INT staining solution by adding 1 µl levamisole, 5 µl Magenta-Phos and 5 µl INT per ml of SB9.5 staining buffer and mix well.\n\t\t\tNote: Alternatively use 7.5 µl/ml BCIP/INT ready-to-use staining solution.\nFor the staining reaction transfer embryo samples to a 24-well plate. Incubate each sample in 400 µl of the chosen staining solution in the dark.\nMonitor occasionally signal development under a stereomicroscope. Stop the staining reaction when the desired signal strength is obtained and before significant background signal is observed.\nTo stop the chromogenic reaction, transfer stained embryos into inserts of a 12-well plate containing 2 ml TNT per well. Rinse the stained embryos two times in TNT.\nWash the embryos two times for 10 min in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT to remove residual substrate.\n7. Antibody Removal/Alkaline Phosphatase Inactivation\nRemove antibody and inactivate alkaline phosphatase by incubation in 2 ml of low pH stop solution (0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 2.2, 0.1% Tween-20) for 10 min at RT.\nRinse for 1 min with 2 ml of 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT.\nWash 3 times for 3 min in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at RT.\n8. Second Detection Round\nTo detect the distribution pattern of a second transcript proceed with antibody detection of hapten-labeled probes (STEP 5.1 to 5.4) using antibody-AP conjugates targeted against the second hapten-label.",
    "Perform alkaline phosphatase chromogenic staining (STEP 6.1 to 6.5) applying a substrate combination that produces a contrasting color to the one used in the first detection round (for available colors see Table 1).\nRemove second antibody-AP conjugate as described in STEP 7.1 to 7.3.\n9. Third Detection Round\nIn order to detect the distribution pattern of a third transcript, proceed with antibody detection of hapten-labeled probes (STEP 5.1 to 5.4) using antibody-AP conjugates specific for the third hapten-label.\nPerform alkaline phosphatase chromogenic staining (STEP 6.1 to 6.5) applying a substrate combination that was not applied in the previous detection rounds. Choose a chromogenic reaction that produces a color precipitate easy to distinguish from those of the previous two detection rounds (for color choice see Table 1).\n10. Mounting and Imaging\nTransfer properly stained embryos to 30% glycerol in PBS and incubate until embryos are fully soaked in the glycerol solution. They are well equilibrated when they sink to the bottom.\nTransfer embryos to 70% glycerol in H2O and let equilibrate at RT. The stained embryos can be stored in 70% glycerol at 4 °C.\nFor mounting, pipette stained embryos in a 70% glycerol droplet onto an object slide and without touching the spacers glued to the slide (Figure 3). Apply the cover slip.\nView mounted embryos under a dissecting microscope. Move the applied cover slip, so that the embryos rotate to the desired orientation.\nObserve properly oriented embryos at high resolution (20X, 40X objectives) under a compound microscope with Differential Interference Contrast optics.\nCapture images with a digital color camera and save on digital storage device."
