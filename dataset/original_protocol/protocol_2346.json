Maintain the cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 200 ng/mL puromycin, and 100 μg /mL hygromycin at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 12 h to allow the cells to adherence.\nNote: We recommend users plate another dish of cell without expression of HTT-Q91-mCherry to prepare a control sample for the following FACS analysis. The control sample is prepared together with experimental group as the following 1c–f.\nIncubate the cells with 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 24 h to induce the expression of HTT-Q91-mCherry and IBs formation.\nWash cells once with 5 mL PBS, scrape off cells with a cell scraper in 1 mL PBS, and transfer into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 25°C to collect cells.\nAdd 400 μL B88 buffer plus 1% Triton X-100, 4 μL cocktail protease inhibitors (Sigma, solution), 100 U/mL DNase, and 1 U/mL RNase to the cell pellet and homogenize by passing through a 22 G needle for 10 times. (U refers to Kunitz unit here and below.).\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 25°C, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nWash the pellet containing IBs with 1 mL B88 buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuge again at 300 × g for 8 min at 25°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 400 μL B88 buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 μL cocktail protease inhibitors, 50 U/mL DNase and divide into four equal samples (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1982-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. A scheme of major steps for the in vitro constitution system\nCells expressing mHTT IBs are lysed and centrifuged to collect IBs. Incubate the IBs with indicated proteins. Use flow cytometry to analysis IBs and quantify the LC3 (488) on IBs.\nNo protein added.\nAdd 5–10 μg/mL fluorescence-labeled LC3 protein.\nAdd 5–10 μg/mL fluorescence-labeled LC3 protein and 2–5 times BSA.\nAdd 5–10 μg/mL fluorescence-labeled LC3 protein and 2–5 times non-labeled LC3 protein. Incubate the reactions for 1 h at 30°C and protect from light.\nNote: We tried a series of the concentration of fluorescence-labeled LC3 (from 0.5 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL). The different concentration only caused a variable LC3 fluorescence intensity on IBs but didn’t change the results (the fluorescent LC3 on IBs can be competed by non-fluorescent LC3 but not BSA).\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min, wash the pellet with 500 μL PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuge again.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL PBS for FACS analysis.\nFACS analysis of LC3 specific association with IBs.\nUse a pulse shape analysis (PulSA) based on flow cytometry strategy (Ramdzan et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to quantify the recruitment of LC3 to the IBs:\nCreate histograms of mCherry-A and 488-A. Use the control sample and sample ii in step 1g to dynamically modify the range by adjusting the voltage of the PMTs until the sample signal spans the full detector range.\nCreate a dot plot of pulse heights versus pulse widths of the mCherry.\nNote: If your flow cytometry cannot collect the pulse width and height of the fluorescence, you can also use the mCherry versus FSC.\nBy comparing the control sample with the experimental sample, gate the unique population characteristic of IBs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCollect data for at least 20,000 IBs.",
    "Analyze the fluorescence of LC3 (488) on IBs.\nCompare the LC3 fluorescence on IBs in four different groups from step 1g. A successful in vitro reconstitution should show no LC3 fluorescence in 1g (i), higher LC3 fluorescence in 1g (ii & iii), and lower LC3 fluorescence in 1g (iv) because of the competition by non-labeled LC3 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nScreen for candidate aggrephagy receptors\nTiming: 1 day for step 3; 2–3 days for step 4\nAfter establishing an effective in vitro reconstitution system, we divide IBs into two groups according to the LC3 fluorescence and conduct an unlabeled quantitative mass spectrometry to compare protein components enriched in two groups.\nSort IBs into two groups (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1982-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A scheme of major steps to sort IBs\nCells expressing mHTT IBs are lysed and centrifuged to collect IBs. Incubate the IBs with fluorescent LC3. Use flow cytometry to analysis IBs and divide IBs into two groups according to the LC3 fluorescence. Conduct proteomic analysis based on mass spectrometry to identify proteins enrich in High-LC3 IBs as candidate aggrephagy receptors.\nPlate U2OS HTT-Q91-mCherry cells at 2 × 106 cells / dish in four 10-cm dishes. After 12 h, add 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 24 h to induce the expression of HTT-Q91-mCherry and IBs formation.\nWash cells once with 5 mL PBS and scrape off cells with a cell scraper in 3 mL PBS for each dish. Transfer cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 25°C to collect cells.\nAdd 1.6 mL B88 buffer plus 1% Triton X-100, 16 μL cocktail protease inhibitors (Sigma, solution), 100 U/mL DNase, and 1 U/mL RNase to the cell pellet and homogenize by passing through a 22 G needle for 10 times.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 25°C, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nWash the pellet containing IBs with 1 mL B88 buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuge again at 300 × g for 8 min at 25°C.\nResuspend the pellets in 1.6 mL B88 buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100, 16 μL cocktail protease inhibitors, and 50 U/mL DNase.\nAdd 0.5–1 μg/mL fluorescence-labeled LC3 protein to solution and incubate for 1 h at 30°C in dark.\nNote: The sorting steps need a larger reaction system than FACS analysis in step 1. To save protein, we used a lower concentration of fluorescence-labeled LC3 compared to step 1g.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 8 min, wash the pellet with 500 μL PBS plus 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuge again.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL PBS for sorting two groups of IBs with flow cytometry:\nGate the population of IBs.\nDivide the IBs into two groups according to the LC3 fluorescence on them: High- LC3 IBs and Low-LC3 IBs.\nNote: The “High” and “Low” are the relative fluorescent intensity of LC3 under a specific fluorescent intensity of IBs. You can mark the medians of LC3 intensity (488) under several IBs intensity (mCherry) and join these points into a line. Signals above this line are High-LC3 IBs and vice versa. Gate farther away the line will get more variability but waste more samples.\nSort 1 million IB particles for each group.\nThe IB solutions were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min.\nAdd 25 μL Aggregates Loading buffer to the IB pellets and boil at 100°C for 10 min.\nLoad all samples into 10% PAGE gel and conduct SDS-PAGE as conventional methods (a constant voltage of 80 V for stacking gel and 120 V for separating gel).",
    "Note: Leave one lane empty between the two samples and the SDS-PAGE can be finished when the bromophenol blue enters 3–4 cm into the separating gel to ease the following processing.\nStain the gel with Simply Blue (Invitrogen) as the instruction manual (https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/simplyblue_man.pdf[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/simplyblue_man.pdf]).\nNote: It is good for the flow sorter to be able to collect the pulse width and height of the fluorescence (e.g., BD FACSAria SORP). Otherwise, a BD influx also works in a two-color gate mode.\nMass-spectrometry-based label-free quantification.\nNote: The reagents in this workflow should use mass spectrometry grade reagents.\nExcise the whole lanes above the bromophenol blue from the gel, each lane was split into three samples of equal length to increase the number of protein identifications, then cut the gel into small pieces less than 1 cubic millimeter.\nIncubate the gel particles with 1 mL decolorizing buffer for 1 h, then remove the supernatant (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).

Repeat the drying step twice.\nAdd reduction buffer to submerge the gel particles and incubated at 55°C for 30 min for cysteine reduction, then remove the supernatant and dry the gel particles with 1 mL 100% ACN (repeat drying step twice) as previously described in step 4c.",
    "Add alkylation buffer to submerge the gel particles and incubate in dark for 30 min for cysteine alkylation.
