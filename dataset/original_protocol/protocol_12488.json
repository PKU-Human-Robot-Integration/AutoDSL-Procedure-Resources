    "Inform all participants about the study and ask them to sign the informed consent form prior to the start of the study. The present protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.\nNOTE: In this double-blind study, patients with depression were randomly divided into two groups. In the experimental group, stimulation targets are located by the DLPFC-sgACC-based individualized location method (Please see 3.3 for detailed description). The targets of the control group are obtained by the average 5-cm method (i.e. (-41, 16, 54))22.\n1. Participants' selection\nRecruit patients with a diagnosis of MDD as confirmed by an expert psychiatrist.\n\tNOTE: Confirm the diagnosis with the standardized MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.)23 . The total score of Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)24 should be no less than 22.\nExclude patients who meet the exclusion criteria: (1) serious physical diseases such as malignant tumor, acute heart failure, multiple organ failure, or severe neurological conditions including but not limited to epilepsy, stroke, encephalitis, brain trauma; (2) comorbidity of other mental illness, or a history of substance use disorder; (3) having metallic implants, especially in brain or heart; (4) women during pregnancy or lactation; (5) had suicidal behaviors or attempted suicide in the past six months; and (6) a diagnosis of bipolar depression or psychotic depression.\n\t​NOTE: Recruit at least 36 subjects for each group to ensure statistical power. A balanced demographic profile between the two groups is recommended.\n2. Preparation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and TMS\nObtain fMRI images by a 3T MRI scanner before performing TMS.\n\t\nReconfirm that the patient has no contraindications before an MRI scanning. Instruct the patient to try to lie still and think of nothing during the scan.",
    "Conduct a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan using the FFE-EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, FA = 90°, field-of-view = 220 x 220 x 256 mm3, matrix = 64 x 64, voxel size = 3.44 x 3.44 x 4 mm3, gap = 0.6 mm, number of signal averages = 1, volumes = 240, number of slices = 33.\nConduct a structural MRI scan using the sagittal T1 weighted 3D turbo field echo (T1W 3D TFE) sequence with the following parameters: field of view = 256 x 256 mm2, TR/TE = 8.2/3.8 ms, view matrix= 256 x 256, slice thickness= 1 mm.\nSet TMS parameters.\n\tNOTE: The protocol of TMS in our study is the intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS). A daily treatment session includes 60 cycles of 10 bursts of 3 pulses at 50 Hz delivered at 100% RMT in 2-s trains, with an interval of 8 s. The whole treatment consists of 10 sessions carried out on weekdays of two consecutive weeks.\n3. Treatment (Figure 1)\nConduct MRI scans and clinical assessments of symptoms and cognitive performance one day before the treatment.\nAssign the patient randomly to one of the two groups, after scanning.\nFor the experimental group, identify the subregion of DLPFC that shows strongest functional anti-connectivity with sgACC. For the control group, simply locate the target in the standard-space using the average 5-cm method, then convert it to the individual space coordinates.\n\t\nrs-fMRI data preprocessing",
    "Preprocess the rs-fMRI data using an MRI analysis software: (a) remove the first 10 volumes; (b) conduct  the slice timing correction; (c) correct the head motion; (d) co-register EPI images to T1 images; (e) perform segmentation; (f) perform normalization using T1 images; (g) smooth the normalized images with a 6-mm Gaussian kernel of full-width half maximum (FWHM); (h) band-pass filter (0.01 - 0.08 Hz); and (i) perform nuisance regression (head motion effects, linear trends, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and global mean time course).\nFunctional connectivity (FC) of the sgACC\n\t\t\nSelect the sgACC (MNI coordinate: 6, 16, −10; Fox et al.) as the region of interest (ROI)25 with a 10-mm radius.\nRemove the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid in the ROI based on the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas (http://www.cma.mgh.harvard.edu/), using a gray matter probability threshold of 0.25.\nExtract the average time course of the ROI.\nTo generate FC map, compute Pearson's correlation coefficients between the ROI (sgACC) and DLPFC in a voxel-wise manner. Normalize each correlation coefficient using the Fisher's r-to-z Transformation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The DLPFC mask is a combination of 20mm radius spheres centered along the left hemisphere at BA9 (x=-36, y=39, z=43), BA46 (x=-44, y=40, z=29), the 5-cm approach site (x=-41, y=16, z=54), and the F3 Beam group-average stimulation site (x=-39, y=26, z=49)26.\nAccording to the FC map, identify the peak coordinate in DLPFC that has the largest Pearson's anti-correlation coefficient with sgACC. This is the subregion of DLPFC with the strongest negative FC with sgACC, which will be later targeted in the TMS treatment for the experimental group.\nDetermine the resting motor threshold (RMT) for each subject and record the hotspot.",
    "Instruct the patient to sit back and relax, then put two recording electrodes on the thenar of the right hand and a reference electrode on the bony part of the wrist.\nStimulate the motor hotspot with 10 consecutive stimulations with different intensities; in the meanwhile, record the times of thenar muscle contraction.\nIdentify the minimum TMS intensity at which a motor evoked potential (MEP) ≥ 50 µV is recorded at least 5 times. Define it as the patient's RMT.\nAssess the severity of depression using clinical scales as described in Clinical Data Collection.\nPerform TMS treatment twice a day for 10 days.\n\tNOTE: For a subject who did not receive treatments as planned, perform additional stimulations after the end of treatment course as needed. However, any subject who misses the treatment for more than four consecutive days should be excluded.\n\t\nCreate a new patient entry.\n\t\t\nSelect the option Create New Patient. Input the patient's ID number or name in the textbox.\nOverlay the structural MRI images onto the navigation system.\n\t\t\nSelect Import patient MRI, and then import the structural image of the patient and select the image type.\nCreate individual head model and define the stimulation target.\n\t\t\nPress the button Specify MRI Fiducials.\nPlace the crosshair on these spots in the MRI image: (1) Fiducial Markers: nasion, both left and right tragi; (2) AC-PC Markers for Talairach: anterior commissure, posterior commissure, inter-hemispheric point; (3) Talairach Markers: anterior point, posterior point, superior point, inferior point, left point, and right point.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The \"Talairach Markers\" mark the borders of the brain.\nPress Create Head Model. Select Manual Brain Segmentation and adjust the threshold of the scalp, the lower brain, and the upper brain.\nClick Define Target to proceed.",
    "Select Target Marker page. Click … to input the coordinate of the treatment target as identified in step 3.3, and then press Go to. Press Add Marker to name the point.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The coordinates of the control group will be (-41, 16, 54).\nCoil calibration\n\t\t\nClick Proceed to Neuronavigation. In the textbox, select the right type of tools to be used in the treatment. Ensure all the tools of reference are in the view of the infrared camera.\nPress Validate Coil. Put the tip of pointer on the marked coil point. Press Validate (or the green button on the remote control) when the indicator of each tool turns green.\nSelect patient and target.\n\t\t\nSelect patient's name or ID on the Select Patient page. Click Select Targets on the next page.\nChoose Read target markers to browse the file of targets. Import the file and select the target as in step 3.6.3.5.\nDefine the coordinate system.\n\t\t\nClick Define Coordinate System. Put a headband with a reference tool on the patient. Make sure the coil tracker and the reference tool are in the vision of the navigation system.\nPlace pointer's tip on the nasion and both tragi in turn. Press the green button on the remote control each time when the indicator of a marker turns green.\nHead shape generation\n\t\t\nContinuously move the pointer's tip on the top of the head. Press the button on the remote control (or Fit) to continue.\n\t\t\tNOTE: One can press Pause to stop the process, and resume by pressing the Start button again, once the pointer has been placed correctly.\nNeuronavigation and stimulation\n\t\t\nPress Neuronavigation. On the Active Coil page, set the stimulation intensity to 100% RMT. Choose Stimulate at targets to see the target on the head model online.",
    "When the coil matches the target crosshair, that is, when the indicator text turns green, stimulate.\nPrepare and start the treatment from step 3.6.4 directly if the patient's entry had been created before.\nConduct follow-up assessments on Day 1, Day 28, and Day 56 after the whole treatment course.\n4. Clinic data collection (Figure 1b)\nPerform clinical assessments using MADRS24, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)27, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)28, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA)29, Clinical Global Impression (CGI)30 and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)31,32.\n\tNOTE: MINI and MADRS are used for the screening.
