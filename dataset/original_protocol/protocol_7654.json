    "Parasite treatment and cloning We recommend determining cell treatment conditions before starting this protocol. The conditions used in this protocol were optimized for T. brucei bloodstream forms of the 427 strain or conditional null (CN) cells derived from the single-marker 427 strain (Cestari and Stuart, 2015). The treatment described here is the knockdown for 24 h of the T. brucei gene encoding PIP5Pase, which results in high rates of VSG switching (Touray et al., 2023). The PIP5Pase CN cell line is grown in G418 and phleomycin to maintain the selection of the tetracycline-inducible system. Tetracycline is added to induce expression of the PIP5Pase gene under the control of a procyclin promoter and a tetracycline operator.Grow 5 mL of T. brucei cells seeded at 1.0 × 104 cells/mL in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 2 µg/mL G418, 2.5 µg/mL phleomycin, and 500 ng/mL tetracycline in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 h or until it reaches mid-log growth (~1.0 × 106 cells/mL). Throughout this protocol, cell growth will be as described above unless otherwise stated. Cells’ doubling time should be approximately 5.5–6 h and viability approximately 90%–95%. Avoid overgrowing cell culture (>1.5 × 106 cells/mL) because it will affect cell viability.Transfer the 5 mL cell culture to a 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of PBS-G pre-warmed at 37 °C and then centrifuge the cells as in step A2. Discard the supernatant.Repeat step A3 three times to ensure complete removal of tetracycline.Split the cells into two 5 mL cell culture flasks (treated and non-treated groups), seeding each culture at 1.0 × 104 cells/mL in HMI-9 medium with 2 µg/mL G418 and 2.5 µg/mL phleomycin.",
    "Add 500 ng/mL tetracycline to the non-treated flask (Tet +, control) and no tetracycline to the treatment flask (Tet -, knockdown) and grow the cells for 24 h.Add 500 ng/mL tetracycline to the treatment flask (Tet -, knockdown). No additional tetracycline is required for the non-treated flask (Tet +, control). Quantify the cell concentration and viability of both the treatment and control groups by mixing 10 µL of cell culture and 10 µL of 0.4% Trypan blue staining. Add 10 µL to the CellDropTM cell counter to obtain viability and cell concentration. Cell concentration should be approximately 1.0 × 105 cells/mL, and viability should be >90%.Add 9 mL of HMI-9 medium supplemented with 500 ng/mL tetracycline to a 50 mL Falcon tube. Repeat the procedure to have three flasks for the treatment group and three for the non-treatment group.From a starting cell concentration of 1.0 × 105 cells/mL (from A7 above), gently mix the cells by flicking the flasks five times and transfer 1 mL of the culture to the Falcon tube 1 containing 9 mL of HMI-9 media (1 in 10 dilutions) to obtain a cell concentration of 1 × 104 cells/mL.From the Falcon tube 1 (1 × 104 cells/mL) culture, transfer 1 mL to Falcon tube 2 to obtain a cell concentration of 1 × 103 cells/mL (1 in 10 dilutions). Repeat the same for Falcon tube 3 to obtain a cell concentration of 1 × 102 cells/mL. Perform the procedure for control and treated groups.Transfer 7 mL of the culture from Falcon tube 3 to a 75 cm2 cell culture flask containing 63 mL of HMI-9 medium supplemented with 2 µg/mL G418, 2.5 µg/mL phleomycin, and 500 ng/mL tetracycline, to obtain a cell concentration of 10 cells/mL (1 in 10 dilutions).",
    "Transfer 60 mL of the diluted cell culture from step A11 to a 75 cm2 cell culture flask and add 140 mL of HMI-9 medium supplemented with 2 µg/mL G418, 2.5 µg/mL phleomycin, and 500 ng/mL tetracycline (3 in 10 dilutions) to obtain a final cell concentration of 3 cells/mL.Aliquot the diluted parasite culture (3 cells/mL) onto ten 96-well cell culture plates (10 plates per treatment group) using a multichannel pipette. Transfer 200 µL to each well so that the probability of obtaining one single cell per well (200 µL) is approximately 30%, i.e., one cell per well for a third of the wells of a 96-well cell culture plate. Ensure the cells are well mixed by gently swirling the parasite cultures while pipetting.Grow the cells in 96-well cell culture plates in an incubator for 5–7 days.Check the 96-well cell culture plates under a microscope to identify parasite clones. Approximately 30% of the wells should contain parasites (see Note 1). We recommend checking each well for parasite clones starting from day 5 up until day 7 post seeding.Transfer 200 µL of parasite clones onto 24-well TC plates and add 1.8 mL of fresh HMI-9 with 2 µg/mL G418, 2.5 µg/mL phleomycin, and 500 ng/mL tetracycline.Grow the clones in the 24-well TC plates for 24 h to increase the number of cells for RNA extraction.(Optional) Aliquot 600 µL of each clonal population onto new 96-well deep collection plates and add 600 µL of freezing solution. Freeze the parasites at -80 °C for short-term storage (2–3 weeks) or liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.The remaining 1.4 mL of the clonal parasite cultures are used for RNA extraction.RNA extraction Transfer 1.4 mL of each clonal culture (approximately 1.",
    "4 × 106 cells) into 96-well deep collection plates, centrifuge at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT, and pour off the supernatant (see Note 2).Add 350 µL of buffer Rlysis-BG (provided in the 96-well plate bacterial total RNA mini-prep super kit) to each well and resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down five times.Thoroughly seal the plate with a sealing film to prevent cross-contamination of the samples and immediately mix the samples by inverting the plate three times.Briefly spin the plate at 1,000× g for 30 s to collect the solution to the bottom of the wells.Add 175 µL of absolute ethanol to each well, tightly seal the plate with a new sealing film, and mix thoroughly by inverting five times.Place the EZ-10 96-well plate (filtration column plate provided with the 96-well plate bacterial total RNA mini-prep super kit) on top of a new 96-well deep collection plate and transfer the lysate from step B5 into the columns on the EZ-10 96-well plate.Centrifuge the plate at 5,000× g for 2 min at RT and discard the flowthrough.Place the EZ-10 96-well plate back on the deep cell collection plate and add 500 µL of universal GT solution (provided in the kit) to each column.Centrifuge the plate at 5,000× g for 1 min at RT and discard the flowthrough.Place the EZ-10 96-well plate back on the deep well collection plate and add 500 µL of universal NT solution (provided in the kit) to each column.Centrifuge the plate at 5,000× g for 1 min at RT and discard the flowthrough.Place the EZ-10 96-well plate back on the deep well collection plate and centrifuge the column at 5,000× g for 2 min at RT to ensure complete removal of the residual ethanol.",
    "Place the EZ-10 96-well plate into a new deep-well storage plate (provided in the kit), add 30 µL of RNase-free water (supplied in the kit), and then incubate the plate at RT for 5 min.Centrifuge the plate at 5,000× g for 1 min at RT to elute the RNA solution.Quantify the recovered RNA by measuring 1 µL of the RNA solution at 260 nm from approximately 10 random wells using a NanoDrop. This will help estimate the isolated RNA concentrations.Tightly seal the plate with an adhesive cover and keep it on ice (or at -80 °C) until the RNA samples are ready for cDNA synthesis.VSG-enriched cDNA synthesis and barcoding This step requires a combination of primers (Figure 1) to barcode each clonal cell population cDNAs with a unique eight-nucleotide sequence for their identification during sequencing analysis. It will also provide an adapter sequence for DNA sequencing library preparation. The forward Ad-SL (5′-TTTCTGTTGGTGCTGATATTGCacagtttctgtactatattg-3′) primer is universal and includes an Oxford nanopore adaptor sequence (capital letters) followed by a sequence (small letters) that hybridizes to mRNA splice leader sequence, a 39-nt sequence added to the 5′ of all trypanosomes’ mRNAs. The reverse Ad-3endVSG primer (5′-TACTTGCCTGTCGCTCTATCTTCXXXXXXXXgtgttaaaatatatc-3′) contains an Oxford nanopore adaptor sequence (capital letters) followed by eight-nucleotide long variable sequence (barcode) unique to each clone and a sequence pairing with the conserved 3′-end of VSG mRNAs, which encodes the C-terminus of VSG proteins (Mugnier et al., 2015). See Supplementary information for the complete primer list. We recommend preparing a working primer solution containing a mix of both primers at 10 µM in a 96-well plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4904/bioprotoc-13-24-4904-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Mix the solutions by gently pipetting up and down five times and spin down the plate briefly at 1,000× g for 30 s at 4 °C.Incubate the plate at 65 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler and then transfer the plate immediately to ice.Prepare cDNA synthesis master mix by adding 2 μL of MuLV 10× Buffer, 5 U of M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, and 8 U of RNase inhibitor (supplied in the MuLV reverse transcriptase kit) and adjust the reaction volume to 10 μL per reaction using nuclease-free water.Aliquot 10 μL of the cDNA synthesis master mix onto each well of the 96-well plate containing the RNA, dNTPs, and primer mix.Thoroughly seal the plate using an adhesive plate sealing film, spin down at 1,000× g for 30 s, and incubate at 42 °C for 2 h and then 65 °C for 20 min in a thermocycler.Store the synthesized cDNA samples at -80 °C or proceed to library preparation.Oxford nanopore library preparation and DNA sequencing Combine the synthesized cDNA samples from each well (from step C8) into one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and mix gently five times. Avoid forming bubbles.Prepare 10 barcoding PCR reactions containing 5 μL of 10× ThermoPol buffer, 400 μM dNTPs mix, 500 nM barcode primer mix (Native Barcoding Expansion 1-12), 2 U of Taq DNA Polymerase, and 750 nM MgCl2. Add 3 μL of the pooled cDNA and adjust the final reaction volume to 50 μL with nuclease-free water.Perform the PCR reaction in a thermocycler at 95 °C for 10 min, then 22 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 3:30 min, and a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min (see Notes 3 and 4).Pool together all PCR amplicons in one 1.",

Add 350 μL (0.65× beads to sample ratio) of NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size Selection beads to clean up the DNA.Incubate beads/samples in a rotator (60 rpm) for 10 min at RT.Spin down the tube briefly at 1,000× g for 30 s at RT, place it on a magnetic rack, and incubate for 1 min at RT. Pipette off and discard the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Add 350 µL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the beads gently. Avoid disturbing the beads or taking the tube out of the magnetic rack. The volume of the 80% ethanol to add per wash should be equal to the sum of the total PCR amplicon volume and added NucleoMag NGS beads volume (e.g., 500 µL of PCR reaction + 350 µL of NucleoMag NGS magnetic beads = 850 µL of the mix, then 850 µL of 80% ethanol).Incubate the mix for 1 min on the magnetic rack at RT. Collect and discard the 80% ethanol. Repeat steps D7 and D8.Centrifuge the tube at 1,000× g for 30 s at RT. Place the tube back on the magnetic rack and remove any residual 80% ethanol from the tube.Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and let the beads air dry for 10 min at RT.Resuspend beads in 61 μL of nuclease-free water, mix gently by flicking the tube or gently pipetting up and down five times, and incubate for 5 min at RT.Place the tube back on the magnetic rack and incubate for 1 min at RT.Collect and transfer the clear supernatant containing the eluted DNA into a new labeled tube. Discard the tube containing the beads.",
    "Measure and assess the concentration and purity of the eluted DNA by quantifying 1 µL of the DNA sample using NanoDrop. The DNA yield ranges from approximately 30 to 60 ng/μL with 260/280 and 260/230 absorbance ratios of approximately 1.8 and 2.0, respectively.Prepare 1 μg of DNA in 47 μL of nuclease-free water in a 0.2 mL thin-walled PCR tube and then add the following: 3.5 μL of NEBNext FFPE DNA repair buffer and 2 μL of NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (from NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix), 3.5 μL Ultra II End-prep reaction buffer and 3 µL Ultra II End-prep enzyme mix (from NEBNext end repair module), and 1 μL of DNA CS (provided in the Oxford Nanopore Ligation Sequencing kit).Mix the solutions by pipetting up and down gently five times and incubate for 60 min at 20 °C in a thermocycler.Add 39 μL of NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size Selection beads to the end-repaired DNAs (0.65× beads to samples ratio) to clean up and follow steps D5–D13. Elute the DNA in 61 μL of nuclease-free water.Quantify 1 µL of the eluted DNA using NanoDrop. Approximately 90% of the DNA is expected to be recovered.Transfer the remaining 60 µL of end-repaired DNA volume from step D18 (0.5–1 μg) to a 0.2 mL thin-walled PCR tube and then add the following components: 25 μL of ligation buffer (LNB), 10 μL of NEBNext Quick T4 DNA ligase (from NEBNext Quick Ligation Module), and 5 μL of Adapter mix F (AMX-F) (LNB and AMX-F are components of the Oxford Nanopore Ligation sequencing kit).
