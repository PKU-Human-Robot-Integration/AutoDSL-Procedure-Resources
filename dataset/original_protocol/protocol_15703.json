    "All animal care and experimental procedures were performed in compliance with the European Community guide for the care and use of animals (2010/63/UE). Male C57BL/6JBomTac mice, aged 10 weeks, and male Sprague Dawley rats, aged 10 weeks, were used to demonstrate this protocol.\n1. Preparation of the synthetic interstitial fluid\nPrepare synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) according to the following recipe: 108 mM NaCl, 3.48 mM KCl, 3.50 mM MgSO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 11.70 mM NaH2PO4, 1.50 mM CaCl2, 9.60 mM Na-gluconate, 5.50 mM glucose and 7.60 mM sucrose (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: SIF can be varied depending on the stimulation target, e.g., a calcium-free solution can be used when studying calcium channels.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 and stabilize the pH by carbogen gassing (5% CO2 and 95% O2)46.\n2. Euthanasia\nAnesthetize adult mice and rats with a mixture of 70% CO2 and 30% O2. Decapitate mice using a pair of scissors and rats using a guillotine (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Use a strain and age that fits the aim of the research. Both males and females can be used in this model.\nSeparate the head from the body at the C3-C4 level of the spinal cord.\n\t​NOTE: Euthanasia can also be performed with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (100-150 mg/kg).\n3. Dissection\nPrepare the rat tissue following the steps below.\n\t\nRemove the skin and the muscle around the head and neck using a pair of scissors (Figure 1A).\nUse a bone trimmer and scissors to separate the lower jaws from the head (Figure 1B-C).\nOpen the spinal cord by inserting a bone trimmer caudally into the vertebrae's dorsal part and remove the vertebrae's dorsal part to expose the spinal cord and brainstem (Figure 1D).",
    "Cut the caudal part of the cranium by the borders of the occipital and interparietal bones to remove these bone structures exposing the cerebellum (Figure 1E).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important not to damage the brainstem and spinal cord while cutting and removing the vertebras.\nIsolate the TNC (Sp5C) running caudally approximately 13-16 mm from the bregma on each side by cutting the dorsolateral part of the brainstem with spring scissors. Immerse the left and the right side TNC into SIF (Figure 1E-I).\n\t\tNOTE: The description corresponds to adult rats.\nCut the head mid-sagitally to divide the cranium in two using a saw (Figure 1J-L).\nCarefully remove the brain without touching the dura mater attached to the cranium using a spatula and cutting the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem (Figure 1M-P).\nTo isolate the TG, cut it, including its branches around the visual borders. Cut the mandibular branch where it enters the foramen ovale. Cut the ophthalmic and maxillary branches entering the skull as they are not divided macroscopically. While dissecting the TG, remove the dura mater covering the TG (Figure 1Q-T).\nImmerse the cranium halves and the TGs in SIF.\nPrepare the mouse tissue following the steps below.\n\t\nRemove skin and muscle around the head and neck using small scissors (Figure 2A-B).\nOpen the spinal cord by inserting a pair of small scissors caudally into the vertebrae's dorsal part and remove the vertebrae's dorsal part to expose the spinal cord and brainstem (Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important not to damage the spinal cord while cutting and removing the vertebras.\nCut the cranium by the borders of the occipital and interparietal bones to remove these bone structures exposing the cerebellum (Figure 2D-F).\nThen, cut the parietal bone mid-sagitally and remove the bone to expose the cerebrum (Figure 2G-I).",
    "Carefully remove the cerebellum with a spatula to expose the brainstem (Figure 2J).\nIsolate the TNC-containing part of the brainstem using spring scissors (Figure 2K-N). Immerse the brainstem with TNC in SIF (Figure 2O).\nRemove the brain and cut the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem (Figure 2P-Q).\nTo isolate the TG, cut it, including its branches around the visual borders. Cut the mandibular branch where it enters the foramen ovale. Cut the ophthalmic and maxillary branches entering the skull as they are not divided macroscopically. While dissecting the TG, remove the dura mater covering the TG (Figure 2R-S).\nImmerse TGs in SIF (Figure 2T).\n4. Washing\nWash skull halves, TNCs, and TGs in SIF for 30 min while replacing the SIF every 5 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The washing steps can be performed while keeping the tissue in plastic containers with a tulle lid to enable easy SIF exchange (Figure 3A-B).\nPrepare the rat tissue following the steps below.\n\t\nTransfer TNC halves to separate microcentrifuge tube caps with 350 µL of SIF (Figure 3C).\nTransfer the TGs to microcentrifuge tube caps - one TG per microcentrifuge tube cap with 350 µL of SIF (Figure 3C).\nPlace the skull halves on platforms made of clay or a 6-well culture plate and fill the skull with 400 µL of SIF (Figure 3C).\nPrepare the mouse tissue following the steps below.\n\t\nTransfer the brainstem with TNC to a microcentrifuge tube cap with 250 µL of SIF (Figure 3D).\nTransfer the two TGs to a microcentrifuge tube cap with 250 µL of SIF (Figure 3D).\n\t\tNOTE: Place two TGs per microcentrifuge tube cap when using tissue from mice.",
    "Place rat skulls and microcentrifuge tube caps with rat and mouse tissue in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Replace SIF using a pipette every 5 min for 20 min.\n\t​NOTE: It is important not to touch the tissue when adding and removing SIF.\n5. Drug testing\nDetermine the basal CGRP release levels.\n\t\nFollowing the last wash, add 250 µL of SIF to mouse TG and TNC. Add 350 µL to rat TG and TNC and 400 µL to each rat skull.\nAfter 10 min of incubation, collect 200 µL of the sample in a microcentrifuge tube and add 50 µL of 10x EIA buffer (provided with the CGRP enzyme immunoassay kit, see Table of Materials) to allow measurement of the basal CGRP release (step 6). Discard the remaining liquid.\n\t\tNOTE: The incubation time must be the same for all samples.\nImmediately, store the samples at -20 °C.\nAfter sampling of basal CGRP release levels, follow one of the three methods: (A) Single stimulation (step 5.2); (B) Concentration-response stimulation (step 5.3); and (C) Inhibition of stimulation (step 5.4) (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The test compound and concentrations used depend on the aim of the study.\nPerform single stimulation following the steps below.\n\t\nAdd test compound or vehicle to the tissue and leave it for 10 min (volume: 250 µL for mouse TG and TNC, 350 µL for rat TG and TNC, and 400 µL for each rat skull).\nAfter 10 min of incubation, collect 200 µL of the sample in a microcentrifuge tube with 50 µL of 10x EIA buffer. Discard the remaining liquid and immediately store the samples at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The incubation time must be the same for all samples.\nPerform concentration-response stimulation following the steps below.",
    "Dilute the test compound or vehicle to the desired concentrations. Add the test compound in increasing concentrations starting with the lowest concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: The test compound and concentrations used depend on the aim of the study. For example, 1 µM, 10 µM, and 100 µM supercinnamaldehyde were used for the present study.\nAdd the lowest concentration (1 µM for the present study) of the test compound and corresponding vehicle to two identical tissue preparations and incubate for 10 min (volume: 250 µL for mouse tissue, 350 µL for rat TG and TNC, and 400 µL for each rat skull).\nAfter 10 min of incubation, collect 200 µL of the sample in a microcentrifuge tube with 50 µL of 10x EIA buffer.\nDiscard the remaining liquid and add the second lowest concentration (10 µM for the present study) to the tissue.\nImmediately, store the samples at -20 °C.\nRepeat this procedure with the remaining concentrations (100 µM for the present study).\nPerform inhibition of stimulation following the steps below.\n\t\nAdd the blocker or vehicle to the tissue and incubate for 10 min (volume: 250 µL for mouse tissue, 350 µL for rat TG and TNC, and 400 µL for each rat skull).\n\t\tNOTE: The blocker and concentration used depend on the aim of the study. For example, 3 µM glibenclamide was used for the representative result in Figure 5.\nAfter 10 min of incubation, collect a 200 µL sample in a microcentrifuge tube with 50 µL of 10x EIA buffer. Discard the remaining liquid and immediately store the samples at -20 °C.\nAdd the agonist or agonist + blocker (see Table of Materials) to the tissue and incubate for 10 min.",
    "NOTE: The agonist, blocker, and concentrations used depend on the aim of the study. In the present study, 3 µM of glibenclamide and 1 µM of capsaicin were used, Figure 5.\nAfter 10 min of incubation, collect a 200 µL sample in a microcentrifuge tube with 50 µL of 10x EIA buffer. Discard the remaining liquid and immediately store the samples at -20 °C.\nPerform a positive control for the experiment.\n\t\nWhen appropriate, add a positive control (e.g., 1-10 µM of capsaicin, see Table of Materials) to the tissue at the end of the protocol and collect a 200 µL sample in a microcentrifuge tube with 50 µL of 10x EIA buffer after an incubation period of 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: It is advantageous to include a positive control to ensure the setup and tissues are functioning. Capsaicin48,49,50 or the depolarizing stimulus of potassium (40-60 mM of KCl)46,47,49 are routinely used to cause the release of CGRP from the trigeminovascular system. 40-60 mM of KCl SIF is prepared as SIF, except NaCl is exchanged for KCl on an equimolar basis.\n6. Analysis of CGRP concentrations\nMeasure the amount of CGRP released using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit following the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials).\nMeasure the optical density at 410 nm using a plate photometer. If a different CGRP EIA kit is used, measure the optical density at the wavelength provided in the manufacturer's protocol.\n\tNOTE: Samples must be diluted to match the standard curve.\nPerform data analysis.\n\t\nPresent the data either as absolute concentrations or normalize to the basal CGRP release from the specific tissue."
