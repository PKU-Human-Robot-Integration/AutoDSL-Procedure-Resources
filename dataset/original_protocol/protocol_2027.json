Processing the tissues\n(A) Expose the abdominal wall.\n(B) Cut the terminal colon and gently pull out the intestines.\n(C) Mouse intestinal anatomy.\n(D) Trim the surrounding fat tissues.\n(E) Remove Peyer’s patches.\n(F) Remove the intestinal content.\n(G) Cut the intestine longitudinally.\n(H) Rinse the tissue in ice-cold HBSS.\n(I) Transfer the tissue into a new well with 5 mL HBSS on ice.\nFind the terminal colon and cut it free with scissors. Then, gently pull out the intestines. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTake the desired part of the intestines and place in a multi-well-plate with 5 mL of HBSS (w/o Ca2+, Mg2+) on ice, while other samples are being processed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: Keep all samples submerged in HBSS and on ice while processing other samples, as dried tissues will have reduced viable cell yield.\nOptional: Addition of 2% FBS into HBSS may improve cell viability.\nTrimming the tissue\nTiming: 5 min/ sample\nThese steps prepare each sample for subsequent dissociation by removing tissues that can interfere with lymphocyte extraction and analysis.\nTrim the intestine samples (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTransfer the intestines onto ice-cold HBSS soaked paper towels and trim the surrounding fat tissues (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and Peyer’s patches (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Remove the intestinal content thoroughly by gently pushing it from one end of the gut and out the other end (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Alternatively, a syringe can be used to inject HBSS inside of the intestines to remove the intestinal contents.\nSlide in angled forceps into the intestines and cut longitudinally (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nWash the sample twice by placing it into ice-cold HBSS and clean off mucus by gently scrubbing the tissue on the wet paper towel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nTransfer the tissue into a new multi-well plate with 5 mL HBSS on ice while other samples are being processed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nCritical: Ensure all Peyer’s patches are removed from the gut, as these may greatly impact immune cell composition results. Try to minimize the time that samples are off ice to keep cells alive. Incomplete removal of mucus or tissues drying out can also reduce the yield.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S1. Tissue trimming, related to step 3\nRemoving epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThese steps dissociate unwanted cell populations from the intestinal tissues, including epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes, and leave primarily cells from the lamina propria.\nPrepare 15 mL of EDTA-DTT buffer per sample.\nPrewarm at 37°C until use.\nPrepare a 50 mL conical tube per sample.\nAliquot 15 mL of EDTA-DTT buffer to each conical tube.\nTransfer the intestinal tissues to the 50 mL conical tubes, ensuring tissues are submerged in EDTA-DTT buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1621-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolating lamina propria lymphocytes\n(A) Transfer the intestinal tissues to the DTT-EDTA buffer.\n(B) Incubate the tissues in a shaker.\n(C) Vortex vigorously.\n(D) Remove residual solutions by scrubbing the tissues on a paper towel.\n(E) Rinse the tissues with ice-cold RPMI-1640 media.\n(F) Transfer the tissues to the digestion buffer.",
    "(G) Transfer the digested tissues to the strainer top tubes.\n(H) Resuspend the cell pellets with 1 mL of 40% Percoll solution and transfer to the prepared 15 mL conical tube with 4 mL of 40% Percoll solution.\n(I) Add 2.5 mL of 80% Percoll solution to the bottom of the tubes using glass Pasteur pipettes.\n(J) The LPLs from intestines before the centrifugation with Percoll.\n(K) The LPLs from intestines after the centrifugation with Percoll (red box). Blue box indicates epithelial cells.\n(L) Remove the upper 40% Percoll solution from the top.\n(M) Collect the cells (lymphocytes) from the interface.\nIncubate the tissues in a shaker at 37°C, 250 rpm for 15 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPlace the tubes at a 45° angle for better shaking.\nVortex each sample vigorously at maximum speed (∼3,000 rpm) for 10 s (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPrepare 2 Petri dishes with 20 mL ice-cold RPMI-1640 media.\nTake the tissue out of the EDTA-DTT buffer and remove residual solution by scrubbing the tissue on a clean paper towel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nRinse the tissues with ice-cold RPMI-1640 media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E), then scrub on a clean paper towel. Repeat this step to thoroughly remove dissociated cells.\nNote: If epithelial cells or intraepithelial lymphocytes are the desired population for analysis, EDTA (for intestinal epithelial cells) and DTT (for intraepithelial lymphocytes) buffers can be treated separately and the supernatant saved after each reaction.\nIsolation of lymphocytes from lamina propria\nTiming: 2–2.5 h\nThese steps will generate a single cell suspension of the lamina propria cells, then isolate lymphocytes via a Percoll density gradient.\nPrepare 5 mL digestion media per sample.\nPrewarm RPMI-1640 media at 37°C.\nFreshly prepare the digestion media with the prewarmed RPMI-1640 media before use.",
    "Note: The concentration of Liberase should be adjusted depending on the tissue types. See the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nPrepare a 50 mL conical tube per sample.\nAliquot 5 mL of digestion buffer to each conical tube.\nTransfer the tissues to the digestion buffer in the prepared conical tubes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nIncubate the tissues in a shaker at 37°C, 250 rpm for 40 min to 1 h.\nPlace the tubes at a 45° angle for better shaking.\nVigorous shaking is recommended every 15 min for more efficient digestion.\nNote: Optimal digestion time can be varied depending on the tissue type, size, and disease-induced conditions. Usually, 35 min incubation for small intestines and 50 min for large intestines are optimal for efficient digestion while keeping high cell viability. For colitis-induced colons, longer incubation is recommended. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPrepare new 50 mL conical tubes with 100 μm cell strainers on the top.\nTransfer the digested tissues through the strainers into the new tubes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nVortex vigorously after incubation for 10 s.\nPour the digested cell suspensions through the cell strainer. Small non-dissociated pieces of tissues can be discarded.\nAdd 15 mL ice-cold HBSS to the original 50 mL conical tube to rinse out residual cells and pour through the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the samples at 450 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by vacuum suction or pouring out while taking care not to disturb the cell pellet.\nPrepare 80% Percoll and 40% Percoll solutions, then prepare 40% Percoll tubes per sample.\nPrepare a 15 mL conical tube for each sample.\nAliquot 4 mL of 40% Percoll solution to each conical tube.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellets with 1 mL of 40% Percoll solution and transfer to the prepared 15 mL conical tube with 4 mL of 40% Percoll solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nAdd 2.5 mL of 80% Percoll solution to the bottom of the 15 mL tubes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nPlace a glass Pasteur pipette into each tube with the 40% Percoll cell suspension, making sure the pipette reaches the bottom of the tube.\nSlowly apply 2.5 mL of 80% Percoll solution through the glass Pasteur pipette to the bottom of the tube.\nWait until the 80% Percoll solution is completely added before removing the glass Pasteur pipettes to leave the 40/80% Percoll interface intact.\nGently move the samples to the centrifuge, while not disturbing the 40/80% Percoll interface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nCentrifuge the samples at 860 × g for 20 min at 21°C with the lowest acceleration speed (acceleration 0 or 1) and no brake (deceleration 0).\nCritical: Lowering acceleration and deceleration speed help create a clearer interface to identify lymphocytes. Centrifugation at 21°C is critical, as the density of Percoll changes at different temperatures.\nPrepare a new 15 mL conical tube per sample and add 10 mL of HBSS.\nTake the cells located at the interface of 40/80% Percoll solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K and Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nRemove the upper 40% Percoll solution from the top until ∼4 mL of total solution remain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L).\nUse a transfer pipette to collect the cells (lymphocytes) at the interface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M).\nTransfer the lymphocytes to the newly prepared 15 mL tube in step 23.\nThoroughly mix by inverting and centrifuge at 450 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant.",
    "Add 10 mL of HBSS to the pellet and centrifuge at 450 × g for 10 min at 4°C to wash the pellet. Resuspension is not required.\nDiscard supernatant.\nCritical: Complete Percoll removal is critical for cell viability, particularly in cases where cell stimulation is required. A second wash with HBSS after step 28 is optional to fully remove Percoll from the samples.\nPause point: The experiment can be paused at this point up to 12–16 h. To pause at this point, resuspend the cell pellet with 5 mL FACS buffer and keep the cells at 4°C.\nNote: If cell stimulation is not required for the analyses, the next section “Stimulation of lymphocytes” can be skipped. Resuspend the pellet with 200 μL HBSS and transfer the cells to the 96-well round bottom plate and directly proceed for “Staining for flow cytometry analyses”.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S2. 80% Percoll seeding, related to steps 19 and 20\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S3. Retrieving lymphocytes from the Percoll interface, related to step 24\nStimulation of lymphocytes\nTiming: 2.5–3 h\nIf lymphocyte stimulation is required, these steps will activate the isolated lymphocytes for cytokine expression analyses.\nPrewarm the 2× T cell stimulation media and aliquot 100 μL into a 96-well round bottom plate for each sample, plus one well for the unstained control.\nResuspend each sample cell pellet from step 28 with base T cell culture media.",
    "Note: The volume of media for the resuspension can be adjusted based on the size of the cell pellet. 1 × 106 to 2 × 106 cells are recommended for the stimulation. Count the cell number using a Burker chamber or automated cell counter with Trypan Blue staining for live/dead cell discrimination for the representative sample and determine the total volume of the resuspension. e.g., If 3 × 106 cells are harvested and 1 × 106 are desired for stimulation, resuspend the cell pellets with 300 μL of the base T cell culture media. If the number of cells in a specific cell population needs to be calculated, please remember the resuspension volume in case you need to calculate back the cell numbers after flow cytometry analyses. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nTake 100 μL of each sample cell suspension and add it to the corresponding well containing 2× T cell stimulation media.\nThoroughly mix by pipetting gently.\nTake 100 μL of any residual cell suspension and add it to the unstained control well.\nOptional: If fluorescence minus one staining (FMO) controls are required (Tung et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), save 100 μL of any residual cell suspension into additional wells.\nIncubate the 96-well plate in a 5% CO2, 37°C cell culture incubator for 2–3 h.\nSurface markers staining for flow cytometry analyses\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThese steps will stain the obtained lymphocytes with antibodies for surface marker proteins.\nTake the 96-well plate from the cell culture incubator.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate at 450 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant by flipping the 96 well plate.\nWash cells by adding 200 μL/well of HBSS without resuspending. Repeat steps 36–38 twice.\nPrepare fixable live/dead viability staining solution.",
    "Note: When preparing master mixtures used for staining in flow cytometry analyses, it may be helpful to lower the volume of diluent to account for any supernatant remaining in wells. For instance, if there is an estimated 15 μL of fluid left in wells, the volume of master mix can be reduced to 35 μL while keeping the total amount of reagent the same.\nAfter the last centrifugation, remove the supernatant by flipping the 96-well plate.\nAdd 50 μL/well of fixable live/dead viability staining solution and resuspend.\nIncubate at 4°C for 10 min. The plate should be covered with aluminum foil from this step on.\nAdd 150 μL/well of HBSS to wash and centrifuge at 450 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant by flipping the 96-well plate.\nAdd 50 μL/well of Fc Blocker solution and resuspend.\nNote: This step can be combined with antibody staining by creating a single master mix with both components. This has demonstrated comparable results to keeping these mixtures separate, but the efficacy may differ depending on antibodies.\nAdd 150 μL/well of HBSS to wash and centrifuge at 450 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant by flipping the 96-well plate.\nPrepare antibody mix 1 as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for surface markers staining (Surface markers staining panel).\nAdd 50 μL/well of antibody mixture and resuspend cells gently.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min. The plate should be covered with aluminum foil.\nAdd 150 μL/well of HBSS to wash and centrifuge at 450 × g for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant by flipping the 96-well plate.\nRepeat steps 51 and 52.\nNote: If intracellular staining is unnecessary, skip steps 54–65 and proceed to step 66.\nIntracellular cytokines and transcription factors staining for flow cytometry analyses\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "These steps will fix and permeabilize the lymphocytes and stain with antibodies for intracellular cytokines and transcription factors.\nPrepare Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization working solution.\nResuspend the cells with 150 μL/well of the working solution and incubate for 20–30 min at 20°C–22°C. The plate should be covered with aluminum foil.\nPause point: The experiment can be paused at this point with a 12–16 h incubation at 4°C. Otherwise, proceed after incubating for 20–30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCentrifuge at 860 × g for 2 min and remove supernatant by flipping the plate.

The plate should be covered with aluminum foil.\nAdd 150 μL of 1× Permeabilization buffer working solution and centrifuge at 860 × g for 2 min, then remove supernatant by flipping the plate. Repeat twice.\nResuspend the cells with 200 μL of FACS buffer.\nOptional: If cell numbers need to be counted, add counting beads (Cat. 424902, Biolegend) to each well according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.biolegend.com/en-ie/products/precision-count-beads-13279[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-ie/products/precision-count-beads-13279]). Cell numbers can be calculated back after flow cytometry runs.\nData collection",
    "Collect data with flow cytometry analyzer (LSRII, BD Biosciences) and analyze by using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
