    "This protocol describes the use of specific terminology and features in the SolidWorks software used for Mold Design and Production steps, though other software packages may also be used to accomplish the same result.\n1. Mold Design and Production\nDesign a to-scale mold master using computer-aided design (CAD) software. Specific procedures in mold master design will vary depending on the specific geometry of the desired elastomer device. This and subsequent steps will illustrate key steps that result in a specific mold master and mold design that roughly resembles the intravaginal probe device depicted in the representative results section.\n\t\nTo define the probe tip, create a 2D sketch in the Right Plane that specifies the internal and external boundaries of a radial cross-section of the cup-like geometry similar to Figure 2A. Use the \"Smart Dimension\" sketch tool to define sketch dimensions. Ensure all geometries are appropriately constrained by adding sufficient relations between elements of the sketch. When done, exit the sketch. Please refer to Figure 2 in Results.\nUse the \"Revolved Boss/Base\" feature to revolve the 2D sketch 360° about the Y-axis to produce a 3D feature that resembles a cup. Individual contours and/or regions of the sketch can be individually selected to selectively revolve desired areas of the sketch with each invocation of the \"Revolved Boss/Base\" feature.\nTo define the handle of the probe, create a 2D sketch in the Top Plane that specifies the external boundaries of a cross-section of the teardrop-like geometry similar to Figure 2B. When done, exit the sketch.",
    "Use the \"Extruded Boss/Base\" feature to extrude selected contours and/or regions of the 2D sketch in the Y-direction. Extrusions can be extruded in both the positive and negative Y-directions and can also be specified to start/end at specified planes, surfaces, or fixed offsets. Specify the extrusion to begin at the base of the cup-like geometry and extend away from the opening of the cup-like geometry.\nIn a separate CAD file, draw a rectangular prism solid body that is large enough to encase the mold master.\n\t\nTo define the rectangular prism, create a rectangle in a 2D sketch in the Top Plane. Ensure the rectangle’s X-dimension is larger than the widest mold master geometry in the X-direction and the rectangle’s Y-dimension is larger than the widest mold master geometry in the Y-direction. When done, exit the sketch.\nUse the \"Extruded Boss/Base\" feature to extrude the region enclosed by the rectangle in the 2D sketch in the Y-direction. Ensure the extrusion length is longer than the longest mold master geometry in the Y-direction.\nCombine the mold master and the rectangular prism to form the mold negative. Please refer to Figure 3 in Results.\n\t\nImport the mold master into the CAD file with the rectangular prism. Align the mold master such that it is centered and completely encased within the rectangular prism.\nUse the \"Combine\" feature and select the \"Subtract\" operation type to create the mold cavity (Figure 3).\nIf using with a low-resolution 3D printer (most FDM 3D printers), note that most small features may not be printed as they are under the machine’s minimum feature size. Thus, pointed corners and edges should be rounded using either \"Fillet\" or \"Chamfer\" since these features are too fine for the printer to resolve.",
    "Note: If overmolding is desired, parts of the mold cavity must be designed such that the overmolded component can be positioned and constrained within the mold cavity. This can be accomplished by defining portions of the mold to provide alignment guides to the overmolded component (Figure 4). Please refer to Figure 4 in Results.\nDefine parting lines, which will cut the mold into several pieces, and through-holes for threaded rods and screws to hold the mold pieces together (Figures 5 and 6). Specific placement of parting lines and rod through-holes are dependent on the relative placement of one another within the mold cavity geometry. Please refer to Figure 5 in Results.\n\tPlease refer to Figure 6 in Results.\n\t\nParting lines are typically chosen in a way that generates bilateral or radial symmetries. They should be defined to avoid overhanging one another in the direction the mold opens, ensuring that a fully cured elastomer device within the cavity can be removed from the mold.\n\t\t\nCreate a bilateral parting line by defining a rectangular 2D Sketch in the Right Plane that extends from the base of the cup-like geometry to the top of the handle of the probe. The rectangle’s width should exceed the end-to-end width of the mold.\nUse the \"Extruded Cut\" feature on the sketch and specify a cut toward the negative X-direction to yield one part. Specify a cut toward the positive X-direction to yield the other part formed by the bilateral parting line.\nTemporarily \"Suppress\" the \"Extruded Cut\" feature that was just created. Features can be suppressed or unsuppressed to hide or reveal their effects to the working CAD geometry. Selective toggling of a combination of \"Extruded Cut\" or \"Revolved Cut\" features will later be used to isolate each individual part of the mold.",
    "Create a radially symmetric parting line to isolate the mold pieces in the cup-like portion of the mold cavity by defining a 2D Sketch in the Right Plane. One side of the sketch should follow the Y-axis while the other edges of the sketch should extend past the mold edges in the radially symmetric portion of the mold. This sketch must also have lines or curves that cut through the internal regions in the radial cross-section of the cup-like geometry, defining two or more regions in the radial cross-section as shown in Figure 2C.\nUse a \"Revolved Cut\" feature on the sketch, selecting specific regions defined by the sketch to remove parts of the mold that are not desired in the isolated part. Unselected regions of the sketch will remain, yielding the desired part, after the revolved cut is completed.\n\t\t\tNote: If overmolding is desired, parting lines should also ensure that the overmolded component can be positioned easily in the mold pre-injection and also removed from the mold post-curing.\nDefine through-holes for the mold by either using the \"Hole Wizard\" feature or by defining circular 2D sketches in planes normal to the surface and then applying the \"Extruded Cut\" feature to those sketches (Figures 5 and 6). Create through-holes using a standard clearance hole size, which corresponds to standard threaded rod or screw size being used.\nDefine a gate in the mold by either using the \"Hole Wizard\" feature or by defining 2D sketches in planes normal to the surface and then applying the \"Extruded Cut\" feature to those sketches (Figures 5 and 6). The gate provides an entry point for the elastomer to be injected in the mold cavity and should typically be located toward the bottom of the mold cavity.",
    "Define one or more vents in the mold by either using the \"Hole Wizard\" feature or by defining 2D sketches in planes normal to the surface and then applying the \"Extruded Cut\" feature to those sketches (Figures 5 and 6). Vents allow excess elastomer to drain from the mold cavity once it is entirely full to prevent pressure build-up. Typically the best place for vent placement is near the top of the mold in an area that leads to an empty reservoir to allow overflow elastomer to pool.\nEnsure that the wall thickness everywhere in the mold is at least 1-1.5 cm if ABS plastic is being used for molds. Walls should be rigid enough that they won’t substantially deform or collapse when mold pieces are under compressive stresses from screws and threaded rods.\n\tNote: Excess wall thickness or non-load bearing walls can be removed if desired to speed up the 3D printing of the mold pieces. Additionally, thinner walls and the addition of hollowed out sections will reduce the total amount of material used and the associated cost of that material. Be aware that some FDM printers will do this by default and could prove to weaken walls more than desired.\nFor each mold piece that is desired, suppress or unsuppress the respective \"Extruded Cut\" or \"Revolved Cut\" features to isolate that individual part of the mold. Save each mold piece as a .STL file or file-type compatible with the 3D printer being used. Ensure the desired mesh resolution is selected.\nLoad the .STL files into the 3D printer. Print the mold pieces and wait until the job is completed.\nRemove any support material on the mold pieces after they have finished printing.",
    "Note: 3D printers vary in their print resolution with FDM-printed parts generally having worse resolution than SLA-printed parts. Surface roughness can be reduced after a part has been 3D printed either by sanding or by light chemical dissolution treatment as described in the discussion section.\n2. Mold Assembly\nBring mold pieces together to form the mold cavity while aligning the through-holes. Slide threaded rods or screws into the through-holes.\n\t\nOptional: If overmolding, position the components to be overmolded in the mold cavity while assembling the mold pieces (Figure 7). If there is concern of overmolded components moving within the cavity during elastomer injection, a small amount of silicone RTV adhesive can be used to temporarily and weakly secure the component on the inside of the mold cavity. Wait 15 min for the silicone RTV adhesive to cure. Please refer to Figure 7 in Results.\nProvide firm compression on the mold by using nuts on each end of the threaded rods. A second nut on each end will ensure the nuts are locked into place and do not prematurely loosen. If using plastic molds ensure that nuts are firmly in place, but not over-tightened, to prevent mold deformation.\nOptional: Seal gaps with silicone RTV and wait 15 min to cure. This is only necessary if lower-resolution molds such as those produced via FDM are used. Limited resolution and poor tolerances at the mold parting lines may create unwanted gaps. Alternatively, surface smoothing as explained in the discussion section can be used to improve fitting of parting lines.\nOptional: Apply mold release to the mold cavity to make demolding easier. However, this will coat the final device with mold release chemicals.\nCreate a runner or sprue to lead into the mold gate.",
    "Insert a barb-to-male luer-lock adapter into the gate of the mold cavity. Ensure a tight fit.\nConnect this to tubing with barb-to-female luer-lock adapters on each end. The exposed female luer-lock adapter on the distal end of the tube will eventually adapt to a 50 ml syringe with male luer-lock tip.\n3. Injection Chamber\nThe injection chamber is a modified off-the-shelf desiccator and should be created prior to elastomer mixing since the working time of two-part elastomers after mixing is limited. Figure 8 depicts the use of the injection chamber in the injection process. Please refer to Figure 8 in Results.\n\t\nDrill two holes in the top cover of the desiccator lid chamber wall.\nIn both holes install a vacuum rated through-wall pipe fitting that crosses the desiccant lid wall and creates a seal.\n\t\tNote: Use PTFE tape or any other type of pipe sealant on components with pipe fitting connections to ensure air-tight seals. Use tube clamps on any barbed tube adapters/fittings to reinforce air-tightness and prevent tubes from slipping.\nInstall a vacuum pressure gauge on the outside of the lid for monitoring chamber pressure. This is achieved by connecting the vacuum gauge to one of the through-wall pipe fittings with vacuum rated pipe and tube fittings.\nInstall an air-operated syringe adapter on the internal side of the lid at the other through-wall pipe fitting. This is achieved by connecting the syringe adapter to the through-wall pipe fitting with vacuum rated pipe and tube fittings.\nOn the external side of the same through-wall pipe fitting that has the attached air-operated syringe adapter, connect a vacuum rated tee pipe fitting. On one branch of the tee pipe fitting, connect a compound vacuum/pressure gauge for monitoring inject line pressure. On the other branch, connect a vacuum rated three-way L-valve.",
    "Connect one branch of the three-way L-valve to a length of tubing leading to a positive air pressure source using pipe and tube fittings. Leave the other branch of the three-way L-valve unconnected for the moment.\nMost desiccators have a built-in three-way T-valve on the chamber wall. Add tubing connecting one branch of this valve to a tee tube fitting. The other branch of the valve will remain unconnected and exposed to atmosphere for purposes of venting chamber pressure.\nConnect one branch of the tee tube fitting to a length of tubing connected to a vacuum source. Connect the other branch of the tee tube fitting to the open three way L-valve branch from step 3.1.5 using a length of tubing and vacuum rated pipe and tube fittings.\n4. Elastomer Mixing\nDetermine the approximate volume of elastomer desired by examining the volume of the mold master CAD file. Increase the volume by 5% to account for elastomer loss when transferring between containers in the upcoming steps. Calculate the amount of Part A and Part B of the elastomer necessary based on the manufacturer’s suggested mixing ratio.\nPlace a disposable plastic cup on a weigh scale and tare it. Pour Part A and Part B of the elastomer in the disposable plastic cup. Any coloring agents or additives should also be added at this step.\nSeal the cup opening by pulling a plastic bag over it and sealing with 3-4 rubber bands.\nMix for 2 min with a centrifugal mixer to ensure homogenous mixing. If a degas setting is available, mix an additional 1-2 min on the degas setting. If a centrifugal mixer is not available, hand mixing can be used, but may introduce more air into the mixture.",
    "Prepare the elastomer injection syringe by using a female luer-lock cap to seal the bottom of a 50 ml syringe with male luer-lock tip. Secure the seal with Parafilm and 1 rubber band.\nTransfer the elastomer from the plastic cup into the 50 ml luer-lock syringe. If elastomer is clinging onto the walls of the plastic cup, use broad strokes to sweep residual elastomer that is clinging onto the walls of the plastic cup. Avoid many small strokes so as to reduce introduction of air into the mixture.\nOptional: Degas the elastomer after transferring into the syringe in the centrifugal mixer. This can help accelerate the degassing process described in step 3.8.\n\t\nSeal the open backside of the 50 ml luer-lock syringe by with Parafilm and a rubber band.\nMix with the degas setting for 30 sec to accelerate the degassing process.\n\t\tNote: Centrifugal mixers may not have an adapter suitable for holding 50 ml syringes. This step may require design of a custom adapter for the centrifugal mixer, which can be done in CAD and 3D printed.\nOnce finished, remove the Parafilm and rubber band on the backside of the syringe.\nPlace the syringe with backside open in a desiccator and degas for approximately 30 min or until bubbles in the elastomer are eliminated. Take care to consider the working time of the elastomer being used; lower viscosity elastomers will also degas more quickly. Then remove the syringe from the desiccator.\nPlace syringe plunger in the backside of the syringe while removing trapped air.",
    "Place a syringe needle sharp side down along the wall of the syringe without touching the elastomer inside it. Place the syringe plunger into the syringe from backside, allowing the syringe needle to release air trapped in between the syringe plunger and the elastomer (Figure 10A).\nAdvance the syringe needle and syringe plunger as necessary until there is no visible air column between the syringe plunger and elastomer. It is acceptable if small amounts of elastomer sneak past the sealing edge of the plunger.\nRemove the syringe needle.\n5. Elastomer Injection\nRemove the female luer-lock cap on the syringe containing elastomer ready for injection and connect the male luer-lock syringe tip to the exposed female luer-lock adapter on the assembled mold (Figure 10B).\nSecure the air-operated syringe adapter onto the backside of the 50 ml syringe with male luer-lock tip.\nPlace both the mold and the attached syringe into the injection chamber. At this point, the injection chamber should look similar to Figure 11. Please refer to Figure 11 in Results.\nPlace the cover onto the injection chamber, ensuring that an airtight seal is formed.\nPull the entire system within the injection chamber to a vacuum. Please refer to Figure 12 in Results.\n\t\nTurn both three-way valves on the injection chamber so that the vacuum source is continuous with the desiccator chamber and the column of air behind the syringe plunger.\nSlowly pull a vacuum until approximately -14.5 psi is achieved (Figure 12). Leave the vacuum on to maintain this pressure. Removal of air will prevent bubbles from accumulating in the mold cavity and help reduce void spaces within the elastomer device.\nPush positive pressure at the backside of the syringe plunger. Please refer to Figure 13 in Results.",
    "Turn the three-way L-valve to break continuity between the vacuum source while establishing a connection between the positive pressure air supply and the backside of the syringe plunger.\nGradually ramp up positive pressure from the air supply until at least 25-35 psi is achieved (Figure 13). Higher pressures are possible depending on the strength of tubing connections used on the injection chamber apparatus.\nWait until the syringe plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe or until elastomer flows out of the mold vents. These indicate injection is complete.\nReturn the injection chamber back to atmospheric pressure.\n\t\nTurn off both vacuum and positive air pressure supplies.\nGradually turn the three-way L-valve connected to the air-operated syringe adapter back so it is closed to air supply and open to the vacuum source. This should vent all positive pressure.\nTurn the three-way T-valve to vent residual pressure in the chamber to atmospheric pressure.\nRemove the mold and prepare for elastomer curing.\n\t\nOpen the chamber and remove the mold.\nDetach the air-operated syringe adapter from the back of the syringe.\nDetach the syringe as well as the tube with two barb-to-female luer-lock adapters.\nPlace a female luer-lock cap on the exposed male end of the barb-to-male luer-lock adapter that is attached to the mold gate to prevent elastomer from flowing out of the mold cavity.\n6. Elastomer Curing & Demolding\nPlace the mold in a temperature-controlled oven and cure the elastomer. Consult elastomer manufacturer specifications to determine the cure time and temperature. The silicone mixture for the intravaginal probe being demonstrated is cured at 70 °C for 5 hr.\nOnce elastomer is cured, remove the mold from the oven.\nDemold the fully cured elastomer device.\n\t\nRemove nuts and threaded rods or screws from the mold.",
    "Optional: If silicone RTV adhesive was used to seal gaps at the parting edges, use a scalpel to gently cut into the silicone RTV adhesive so the parting edges can be separated.\nUse a scalpel to cut away and separate the device from extra elastomer material at the gate or vents. Use a scalpel to cut away any flash that may have formed at the mold parting edges.\nClean the molds with a wipes and non-destructive solvents such as isopropyl alcohol.\nSubscription Required.
