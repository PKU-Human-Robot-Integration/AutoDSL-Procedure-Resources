    "This protocol is in full compliance with standard Institutional Ethical Review Board guidelines. If human or animal tissue is investigated using the protocol depicted here, researchers are obliged to have approval from the relevant review board of their institution or country.\nCaution: Standard precautions for the safe handling of biological samples apply to this protocol. This includes wearing gloves and a lab coat, and performing the work under a biosafety cabinet whenever possible.\n1. Preparation of Cells\nCancer cell lines\nCulture a respective human or murine cancer cell line at 37 °C in 10-30 mL of appropriate medium (e.g., RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1x penicillin/streptomycin) and harvest the cells at sub-confluency (i.e. 70-90%) using digestion with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA or some other de-attachment procedure. Determine the cell count and check for viability using a counting chamber and trypan blue staining. The fraction of viable cells should exceed 85%.\n\t\tNOTE: Examples of human cancer cell lines harboring SP compartments include MCF7/HTB-22 and SKBR3/HTB-30 (breast cancer), A2780 and SKOV-3/HTB-77 (ovarian cancer), and A549 (lung cancer)26.\nEx vivo tumor tissue\nTake a fresh surgical tumor specimen or alternatively, harvest tumor tissue from a transplantable or genetically-engineered mouse tumor model. Take 200-1,000 mg of tissue and generate a single cell suspension by mechanical disaggregation (e.g., using scissors or a scalpel) and enzymatic digestion (e.g., using a collagenase/dispase/DNase cocktail).\nFilter the sample through a 70 µm cut-off strainer. Determine the cell count and check for viability using a counting chamber and trypan blue staining.\n\t\tNOTE: Digestion cocktails frequently contain 200 µg/mL collagenase P, 0.8 U/mL dispase and 25 µg/mL DNase I, and incubation times typically range from 20 - 50 min. Ideally, tissue disaggregation is performed according to a protocol optimized for the tissue under investigation 27,28,29.",
    "2. Test Samples\nAdjust cell concentration to 1 x 106 cells/mL in fresh culture medium (a nutrient-containing vehicle is important as dye extrusion is an active energy-consuming process). Finally, transfer 1 mL of sample to an ordinary flow cytometry/FACS round-bottom tube (labelled 'test').\n\tNOTE: For optimal results, it can be necessary that the cell concentration is titrated (for instance 5 x 105-1 x 106-2.5 x 106 cells/mL), but a lower cell concentration generally yields a higher resolution19. Only for sorting applications where a maximum number of SP cells shall be recovered, it is recommended to increase the cell concentration to up to 1 x 107 cells/mL.\nAdd 10 µM of DCV to the sample and mix well, either by gentle vortexing or resuspending for 3-5x. Proceed to inhibition controls.\n\tNOTE: Optimal results might depend on titration of the triggering dye (for instance 2.5; 5; 10; 20 µM), but a higher dye concentration generally yields a higher resolution19.\n3. Inhibition Controls\nTransfer 250 µL of the dye-containing cell suspension to a new flow cytometry/FACS round-bottom tube (labelled 'control'). Add 50 µM of verapamil or 20 µM of FTC and mix well by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Verapamil and FTC are the most well-established inhibitors for SP analysis but have different efflux pump specificity: Verapamil inhibits several ABC drug transporters including ABCB1 and ABCB5, whereas FTC is specific for ABCG26,19. If the SP status of an individual sample is unknown, it is thus recommended to use both verapamil and FTC in separate tubes.\n4. Staining",
    "Cap both the 'test' and 'control' tubes and incubate them at 37 °C in the dark for 90 min, with gentle agitation every 15 min. Most of the dye extrusion in SP cells will occur within the first 45 min, but dye accumulation in non-SP cells (contributing to resolution) is only maximal after 75-90 min19.\nAfter staining is complete, wash the cells in 3-4 mL ice-cold PBS and resuspend the pellet in a volume of 100 µL (PBS as well). Keep the cells in the dark and chilled on ice, and proceed to the staining of additional markers. Alternatively, directly perform flow cytometric analysis.\n5. Costaining for Other Markers\nAdd a desired panel of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to the DCV-stained cells, mix well and incubate the cells at 4 °C in the dark for 20-30 min. Wash the cells in 3 - 4 mL ice-cold PBS and proceed to dead cell discrimination.\n\tNOTE: Antibody formats that are easily compatible with DCV and virtually do not require compensation include PerCP or PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC, Alexa Fluor 647, APC-Cy7, APC-H7, BV711, Alexa Fluor 750 and BV786. Formats that are compatible with DCV but may require compensation include FITC, Alexa Fluor 488, PE and BV650. Formats that are virtually not compatible with DCV include BV421, V450 and V500.\nAdd 7-AAD (or PI) to the DCV-stained cells at the concentration recommended by the particular manufacturer and incubate the samples for 5 - 10 min in the dark. Filter the samples through 70 µm cut-off strainers and proceed to flow cytometric analysis.\n6. Flow Cytometric Analysis",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to switch on the respective flow cytometric instrument during the staining process already so that everything is set as soon as the samples are ready. This includes also standard maintenance procedures such as system performance tracking and tank refilling.\nAcquire the cells on the flow cytometer and gate them on a bivariate FSC/SSC dot plot (Figure 1B). Exclude doublets and aggregates by comparing the different signals of FSC (i.e. height, width, area) (Figure 1C).\nIf a dead cell marker has been included, gate on the viable cell fraction (e.g., 7-AAD-negative) (Figure 1D). Visualize the viable singlet cells on a bivariate dot plot for 'blue' and 'red' DCV emission. To this end, display the 'blue' fluorescence channel on the y-axis (e.g., 450/50) and the 'red' fluorescence channel on the x-axis (e.g., 525/50).\nSwitch both channels to linear mode and adjust the detector voltages correspondingly so that the SP locates to the side of the plot in the lower left quadrant. Conversely, the non-SP locates to the upper right quadrant of the plot reflecting the cell cycle distribution (G1 and G2). Gate the SP and stop the acquisition (Figure 1E).",
    "NOTE: DCV-defined SP cells can be detected using flow cytometric instruments equipped with a violet laser excitation source (i.e. a 405 nm laser line). It is one specific of SP analysis that the emitted fluorescence is measured in linear mode and in two separate channels displayed on a bivariate dot plot. The 'blue' emission of DCV is measured at approximately 450 nm (e.g., with a 450/40 standard filter) and the 'red' emission of DCV is measured at approximately 510 - 585 nm (e.g., with a 510/50, a 525/50 or a 585/15 filter)19. Due to the particular chemistry of the assay, the separation between SP and non-SP cells is generally higher in the 'red' fluorescence channel19.\nLoad the inhibition control(s) and acquire the data. The SP cells have now disappeared or are reduced substantially (Figure 1F). If necessary, refine the SP gate based on these data.\nTo investigate surface marker expression by SP cells, leave the 'red' fluorescence of DCV on the x-axis and display a respective fluorescence channel on the y-axis in logarithmic mode (e.g., APC). Adjust the detector voltages correspondingly and gate the fraction of SP cells staining positive for the investigated marker(s) (Figure 1G). Co-expression of a particular marker by SP cells yields a respective signal in the upper left quadrant of the plot30.\nRecord the data and/or sort the SP cells.\nSubscription Required.
