    "1. Imaging medium preparation\nPrepare fresh media on the day of use. Pipette 200 µL of Schneider medium (containing L-Glutamine and 0.40 g/L of NaHCO3 complemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin).\nSupplement with 30 µL of insulin 10 mg/mL.\nAdd 4 µL of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.\n2. Observation-chamber preparation\nWith a pipette tip, apply a small amount of silicone grease all around the hole on the underside of the punctured slide (Figure 4D).\nPosition a 24 x 50 mm coverslip of 0.13-0.16 mm thickness.\nWith the wide end of a pipette tip, apply pressure on the coverslip to flatten the silicone in order to seal the coverslip and create a silicone ring interior to the slide (Figure 4F,G).\n3. Ovary dissection\nAnesthetize a female fly of the desired phenotype on a CO2 pad.\nTransfer the female in 150 µL of the imaging medium in a dissecting well (Figure 4H).\nOpen one female by grabbing its thorax with forceps and pinching the dorsal abdomen cuticle with a second pair of forceps.\nIsolate and detach the pair of ovaries, which should be readily visible upon cuticle opening.\nCarefully remove the uterus, oviduct, and muscle sheath (Figure 4I).\nPlace a drop of 10-15 µL of the imaging medium and transfer one ovary in the imaging chamber (Figure 4J,K).\n4. Egg chamber isolation\nTo separate the ovarioles, hold the posterior end of the ovary (toward the older stages) with the needle. Tease apart the ovarioles by carefully pulling on the germarium with another needle.\nRemove the remaining muscle sheath on the egg chambers; one needle holding the sheath and the other pulling on the ovariole through the larger chambers (stage 9 or older).\nAllow the unsheathed ovariole to sink and contact the coverslip.",
    "Remove late stages and the rest of the ovaries from the micro-chamber with the help of forceps. Carefully distance the ovarioles from the others with needles to facilitate the acquisition (Figure 4L).\n5. Observation chamber closing\nCut a small square (10 x 10 mm) of permeable membrane (Figure 4M,N).\nCarefully apply the membrane on top of the imaging medium to expel any air bubbles (Figure 4O).\nHermetically seal the chamber with a thin layer of halocarbon oil around the well on the contour of the membrane (Figure 4P,Q).\n6. Imaging\nPlace the imaging set-up on the slide holder of the inverted microscope using a 40x objective (HCX PL Apo, 1.25NA, oil immersion).\nLocate and save positions of different stage 6 oocytes in which the nucleus is ready to migrate.\nSet-up the 488 and 561 nm lasers. With a measured output laser power of 150 mW, use 30% of the laser power and 300 ms and 500 ms exposure, respectively.\nSet-up the experiment. Take a time-lapse of 12 h with the interval of 15 min-41 sections with an interval of 1 µm centered on the nucleus.\n\t​NOTE: According to the exposure time described above, this setting allows the acquisition of one position in around 45 s. Since there is a delay due to position changing, it is recommended to set a maximum of 12 positions in these conditions.\n7. Image analysis\nProcess the movies on the software Fiji, using the plug-in Orthogonal view and manually track the nuclei.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62688/62688fig04.jpg",
