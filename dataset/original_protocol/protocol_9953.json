    "1. Preliminary steps necessary for the assay\nNOTE (IMPORTANT): All preliminary steps must be conducted in a sterile environment to avoid contaminations. Sodium azide should not be used for storage as it would inhibit the activity of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme.\nPrepare running buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5), using the (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid, and add Tween 80 to a concentration of 0.01% (v/v).\nImmobilize the primary antibodies (capture antibodies) onto the surface of the NHS-activated magnetic microbeads by following the protocol provided by the supplier. Briefly, the Magnetic IP/Co-IP Kit (Table of Materials) protocol encompasses the following steps.\n\t\nAliquot 0.2 mL of beads (2 mg) into a plastic tube and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of ice-cold 1 mM HCl.\nBind the selected antibody (Anti-Human Serum Albumin [15C7], Rb anti-BG polyclonal, Rb anti-E.coli MRE 162 polyclonal or Goat anti-MS2 polyclonal), 40 μg/mL in 67 mM Borate Buffer, covalently to the beads for 1 h with shaking at 37 °C. Table 1 contains the list of all antibodies used with the current protocol and the antigen pathogens6.\nWash the unbound antibodies twice with 0.8 mL of Elution Buffer.\nQuench the reaction with 1 mL of Quenching Buffer for 1 h.\nWash the beads once with Modified Borate Buffer and once with IP Lysis/Wash Buffer.\nResuspend the beads in 0.5 mL of IP Lysis/Wash Buffer and store at 4 °C until required for use.\n\t\tNOTE: For best results, a fresh batch of microbeads are coupled to the antibodies the day before the EWOD-isolation and ELISA on-chip. However, the microbeads coupled to the primary antibody can be stored at 4 °C up to one month. Should agglomeration occur, tap the vial to break the precipitate and to resuspend the beads in the solution.",
    "Block the microbeads with the coupled antibody overnight, using final concentration 4 mg/mL for the microbeads, in a Blocker Casein (1% w/v) in 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: The blocking step is always conducted the day before the biodetection assay run.\nSeparate the beads from the Blocker Casein using a magnet and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend in 1 mL of running buffer and mix for 1 min.\nSeparate the beads using the magnet and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat the above washing steps (1.2.10 and 1.2.11) twice.\n\t\tNOTE: Three washing steps are sufficient to reduce the adhesion of the beads to the surface and to facilitate free movement of the droplet.\nResuspend the beads in the running buffer at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. This solution of microbeads is ready to use with the EWOD chip.\nPrepare a solution of the neutravidin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the secondary biotinylated antibody to a final concentration for each of 1 μg/mL in Running Buffer (used for BG detection6).\n\tNOTE: To target the antigens (Table 1) various concentrations of secondary biotinylated antibody, ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 μg/mL were tested successfully.\nMix equal volumes of the Luminol with hydrogen peroxide solution just before running the assay\n\tNOTE: Luminol is used to quantify the number of binding events based on the HRP enzyme that is bound covalently to the secondary antibody which targets the antigen (e.g., pathogen). However, different reporting molecule and strategies can be used for detection17 instead of the chemiluminescence and Luminol.\n2. Manufacturing and surface treatment of the EWOD chip components\nNOTE: The EWOD chip consists of an actuation plate with patterned chromium electrodes to alternate the apparent contact angle of a droplet and a cover plate to define the height of droplets.",
    "Draw the design of the electrodes and connectors in 2D using standard CAD software. Include also the waste collection pad with dimensions of 5 x 5 mm2 to store the used solvents (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: To manipulate the droplets we use 47 electrodes, each with dimensions of 1.7 x 1.7 mm2. This electrode size accommodates droplet volumes ranging from 1.5 µL to 3 µL (for a 500 µm gap). From experience, when working with a 500 µm gap, 1.5 µL is the minimum droplet size that can be actuated. It corresponds roughly to the droplet (projected) contour being circumscribed to the square pad. However, there is not any theoretical limit in size other than caused by the resistance (friction) of the body of fluid. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the volume does not exceed 3 µL for reliable actuation using a 500 µm gap. The electrodes are addressed by 48-channel electronics.\n\tNOTE: The design dimensions and sizes of the pads can vary depending on the intended volumes and the laboratory unit operations (LUOs) that comprise the protocol.\nSend the design drawing to a mask manufacturing service for printing the chromium mask onto a glass substrate. The thickness of the chromium layer is 100 nm.\n\tNOTE: The chromium layer on the photomask used as a substrate for the EWOD chip is, by definition, opaque. The design of each of our electrodes includes a grid layout to ensure semi-transparency.\nCut the plate to size of 56 x 56 mm2 with a precision CNC Dicing/Cutting Saw.\nStick masking tape over the electrical contacts in order to isolate them during the two coating steps.",
    "Coat the plate chromium-glass plate with a dielectric layer by depositing 6 µm Parylene-C onto its surface. The Gorham process18 is used with 7.4 g of DPX-C in a Parylene Deposition System (Table of Materials).\nSpin-coat amorphous fluoropolymers (Table of Materials) using a spin-coater at 1500 rpm for 30 s on top of the plate and bake it at 140 °C for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: This renders the surface hydrophobic. One can validate whether the coating has been deposited successfully by placing a droplet of water onto the surface. The contact angle between the droplet and the plate must be in the region of 110º.\nRemove the masking tape from the electrical contacts.\nSpin-coat amorphous fluoropolymers (Table of Materials) using a spin-coater at 1500 rpm for 30 s on top of the 4-in silicon wafer and bake it at 140 °C for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: It is important that both the surfaces of the actuation and cover plates are hydrophobic in order to facilitate smooth movement of the discrete droplets during the assay.\n3. Loading, assembly and operation of the EWOD chip on the DMF platform\nNOTE: The EWOD chip operates using parallel-plate configuration with a precisely defined gap 0.5 mm between the actuation plate and the conductive, grounded cover plate. This sandwich assembly is described in the current section.\nRemove the lid from the DMF platform6 and place it onto the bench.\n\tNOTE: A dark Faraday cage chamber, is necessary to prevent stray light and electromagnetic interference during the detection. There is no interlock on the lid, hence, the platform allows us to observe droplets' movement.\nPlace a clean actuation plate onto the rotating stage, chromium facing upwards. The plate needs to be aligned with the upper left corner of the recessed stage (Figure 2A).",
    "Clamp the actuation plate from the top using the panel with the 47 contact pins. This secures the plate into place and facilitates alignment with the contact pins.\nLay the 0.5 mm shim and the 2 mm polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) separator onto the rotating stage, in order to provide a controlled gap between the actuation and the cover plates.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, wicking paper can be placed onto the waste disposal pad prior to aliquoting the droplets before the next step. As the assay proceeds, the waste is directly absorbed into the paper that can be removed at the end of the assay.\nLoad the droplets on to the proposed loading pads (Figure 1).\n\t\nAliquot four 2.5-µL droplets from the Running buffer onto the B-, A-, R-, E-denoted pads, one droplet on each pad.\nAliquot 2.5 µL of Luminol:H2O2 (1:1, v/v) solution onto the D-denoted pad.\nAliquot 2.5 µL of Neutravidin conjugated to HRP (1 μg/mL) onto the F-denoted pad.\nAliquot 2.5 µL of Biotinylated secondary antibody (1 μg/mL) onto the G-denoted pad.\nAliquot 2.5 µL of Microbeads with conjugated primary antibody (2.5 mg/mL) go onto I-denoted pad.\nAliquot 2.5 µL of the unknown sample onto C-denoted pad.\n\t\tNOTE: The proposed loading pattern is only one example of an experimental layout, however, the loading pattern can be changed to match the users' needs, as long as those changes match the sequence defined in the software (Supplementary File 1).\nPlace the cover plate on the surface of the rig, besides the round recess area, and slide it laterally into the recess and on top of the actuation plate (Figure 2B).\nPut the permanent magnet on top of the cover plate and secure it by sliding the two latches (Figure 2C).",
    "Rotate the stage by 180° and inspect visually if the loaded droplets are still in place (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: One should be able to eyeball the position and the shape of droplets through the transparent stage and the back of the actuation plate (Figure 2D). The assay is ready to run if round droplets could be seen on top of the loading electrode pads. In case, a droplet is displaced one can remove the magnet and the cover plate, then recover the displaced droplet with a clean pipette and place it again on the loading pad.\nCheck that the loading position for each droplet matches the programmed actuation sequence in the software (see Supplementary File 1 for details on the software).\n\tNOTE: To be able to visually check the position of the droplets, the photodetector needs to be dismounted (Figure 2D).\nPosition the photodetector screened \"can\" into the slot of the rotating stage.\n\tNOTE: The photodetection system pivots around a photodiode, which has a large collection area (10 x 10 mm2) to maximize light collection without additional optics, plus a trans-impedance amplifier to minimize noise6. However, the system is extremely sensitive and can collect minute signals. To reduce the noise level, a number of electronics-based strategies were implemented (e.g., the photodetection system was protected by putting it in a Faraday cage, a metal casing known as a screened \"can\").\nConnect the cable to the photodetector screened \"can\".\n\tNOTE: Once the EWOD chip is aligned with the photodetector, the DMF platform is completely assembled and is now ready to operate.\nPlace the lid over the DMF platform and start the program sequence using the software interface developed at the University of Hertfordshire.",
    "NOTE: Additional software is used for reading and recording the luminescence from the droplet as a function of time in a CSV file (see Supplementary File 2).\n\t\nEnsure that the programmed sequence (see Supplementary File 1) prompt messages appear at the interface to inform the operator that \"The luminol droplet is ready to collect the extracted magnetic beads\" or \"The detection droplet is ready to be moved to the detection site.\" In both cases, confirmation from the operator is required to proceed with the sequence.\n4. Operating in visual mode (Optional for optimization of protocols)\nNOTE: If desired, in order to visualize every droplet-based operation, the assay can be operated by skipping steps 3.10-3.12 and replacing them by the following operations.\nStart the program sequence using the software interface.\n\tNOTE: The droplet movement can be observed while operating in visual mode, which is useful during protocol optimization. Firstly, to check the reproducibility of the magnetic separation operation. For instance, if the amount of beads used is too low, the magnetic separation will not occur, vice versa, if the amount of beads is too high, the droplet may be immobilized by the bead pellet. Secondly, to ascertain the reliability of a new assay as some droplet formulation may cause actuation impairment that can be detected by observation.\nMount the photodetector screened \"can\" into the slit of the rotating stage, when prompted.\nConnect the cable to the photodetector screened \"can\", by inserting the pins in the socket.\nPlace the lid over the DMF platform and resume the assay.\n\tNOTE: Use the additional software for reading and recording the luminescence from the droplet as a function of time in a CSV file (see Supplementary File 2)\n5. Removing liquid waste and cleaning the chip",
    "CAUTION: Make sure the equipment is switched off and disconnected from power sources (computer, main) prior to cleaning. Wear gloves, a lab coat and goggles protective glass (PPE) when removing biological samples from the chip!\nTo access the electrodes and the used solvents on the actuation plate, open the DMF platform lid and rotate the stage 180°.\nUnhinge the magnet casing, remove the magnet from the rotating stage and place it onto the bench.\nRemove the cover plate, silicon wafer, from the slit with a pair of tweezers, rinse it with DI water, dry it with compressed air and place it in a Petri dish, where the wafer can be stored and reused.\nUse a micropipette to move the liquid waste from the pad without touching the surface.\nClean the surface by wicking off the liquid from the actuation plate using absorbent paper (filter material).\n\tNOTE: Keeping the surface intact will increase the longevity of the actuation plate, that allows multiple uses.\nClean the actuation plate by sweeping gently the surface of the electrodes with a clean DI water droplet using a clean pipette. Then remove the droplet with wicking paper (filter material).\n\tCAUTION: Dispose of the tissues, papers, pipettes tips and gloves that are contaminated with biological material into the bio-waste bin.\nUse the actuation plate for a different assay or remove it from the DMF platform for storage or recycling."
