    "NOTE: In general, the regeneration process includes trypsin digestion and rinsing step with ethanol and water. The digestion time changes according to the number of cells used, and the type and number of cells used may differ depending on the experimental purposes. It is advised to check the regenerated microchips using optical and electrochemical methods to optimize the regeneration conditions. During the experiment, soluble and insoluble chemicals may be involved, and here these two typical cases of the regeneration procedures are detailed.\n1. Preparation of Regeneration Solutions\nNOTE: Prepare and handle all the solutions under sterile conditions.\nPrepare fresh 0.25% (g/v) trypsin solution. Trypsin can be purchased or freshly prepared as follows.\n\t\nDissolve 0.25 g of trypsin in 100 mL of pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nStir the solution until the trypsin is fully dissolved at 4 oC. Stir the solution at low speed taking care to avoid any bubble formation.\nFilter the solution with a 0.22 µm filter in the biosafety hood.\nPrepare 75% ethanol using absolute ethanol. Pour 75 mL absolute ethanol into a volumetric flask and add deionized water until the volume reaches 100 mL. Perform further sterilization if necessary.\n2. Incubation and Proliferation of A549 Cells in Electronic Plates\nNOTE: Electronic plate types 16 and L8 are both made of arrayed gold microelectrodes lithographically printed at the bottom of incubation wells. Electronic plate 16 has 16 wells while electronic plate L8 has 8 wells. The wells of electronic plate 16 are round while the wells of electronic plate L8 are rounded rectangles. The volume of each electronic plate 8 well is about 830 µL and each electronic plate 16 well is about 270 µL.\nA549 cell culture",
    "Culture A549 cells in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 medium (RPMI-1640) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin in the cell culture dish.\nPassage the cells when the cell density reaches ~75% then wash the adherent cell layer with 1 × PBS and trypsinize with 0.25% trypsin solution for 1 min at 37 oC. Centrifuge the cells at 179 × g for 5 min to remove trypsin. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL medium for further culture or other experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution of cells resuspended in the medium is here designated as the cell suspension buffer.\nTake out 10 µL and count the cell number using a hemocytometer. Use the RPMI-1640 medium to further dilute the cell suspension buffer to prepare 30,000-80,000 cells/mL cell suspension buffer for the experiments.\nProliferation/cytotoxicity experiment and data acquisition\nAdd 50 µL (150 µL for electronic plate L8 ) cell medium to each incubation well of the electronic plate 16 and leave it for 30 min in the biosafety hood for equilibration. Manually insert the electronic plate 16 in the real-time cell analyzer in the CO2 incubator at 37 oC.\nLaunch the real-time cell analyzer operation program on the computer. On its default experiment pattern setup page, select “Experiment model” and name the running assay.\nOn its Layout page, select the corresponding wells that are included in the experiment and input the information like cell type, number and drug names in the edit boxes. On its Schedule page, add the experimental steps, then select the running time (e.g., 12, 24, or 48 h) of each step and interval of real-time data acquisition.\n\t\tNote: Here, the interval of step 1 and 2 are 1 min and 15 min afterwards.",
    "Save the file and click “Start” button to measure the background impedance of the media on its Cell Index page; the resulting data will be automatically subtracted. On its Well Graph page, all well curves can be visited. On its Plot page, add wells and the graph of time-cell index will be showed.\nFor the cell proliferation experiment, firstly click the “Pause” button to pause the program . Then take out the electronic plate and add 100 µL A549 cell suspension buffer per well at room temperature. Leave the plate for 30 min in the biosafety hood to let the cells settle to the bottom of incubation wells.\n Manually insert the electronic plate in the real-time cell analyzer station. Click the “Start” button to continue the experiment.\n\t\tNote: On the Plot page, the analyzer continuously records Cell Index values or curves throughout the experiment.\nWhen the experiment is complete, enter the Plot page and open the experiment file. Then select all the tested incubation wells and the resulting Cell Index curves that can be averaged or normalized for the last time before adding pharmaceutical drugs or changing medium to reduce variations between assays. On the Data Analysis page, EC50 or IC50 can be calculated\n3. Regeneration of Electronic Plates\nNOTE: For each rinsing step, the solution in the electronic plate was mixed thoroughly (5-10 times) using a pipette.\nCase 1: For cytotoxicity evaluation of anti -cancer drug\nSeed A549 cells on the electronic plate as described in section 2.\nDissolve the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) in the cell medium first. Slowly add DOX to the cells (final concentration of DOX is 30 µg/mL) using a pipette. Record the CI as described in section 2.",
    "NOTE: The electronic plate used was regenerated immediately after the experiment was complete. In this case, as DOX is a soluble chemical, the regeneration of the electronic plate following the protocol is relatively easy to handle and no additional steps are needed.\nRegeneration\nTake out the electronic plate containing cells from the real-time cell analyzer station. Place the used electronic plate in a sterile biosafety hood at room temperature and mix culture medium thoroughly using a pipette. Pipette out all the medium.\nRinse the electronic plates with 200 µL deionized water for 3 times at room temperature.\nDigest the remaining cells on the electronic plates with 0.25% freshly prepared trypsin for 1-2 h (200 µL/well) in an incubator at 37 oC. When the digestion is completed, mix the incubation solution 5-10 times using a pipette and pipette out all the solution in the biosafety hood at room temperature.\nRinse the electronic plates with 200 µL ethanol and 200 µL water, respectively, as follows: deionized water 2 times, 100% ethanol 2 times; 75% ethanol 2 times; deionized water 2 times. Invert the electronic plate on a sterile gauze or tissue paper to decant the remaining water at room temperature.\nUltraviolet sterilize the regenerated electronic plate for 1-2 h in the biosafety hood at room temperature.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Double the volume of all solutions for the regeneration of electronic plate L8.\nCase 2: drug delivery using mesoporous material.\nUse rod-like mesoporous silica materials with an average pore size of 5.6 nm as drug delivery matrices, as previously reported20.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the electronic plate was employed to monitor the drug-release effect on cells.\n\t\t\nAdd mesoporous materials into the incubation solution of each well of the electronic plates. As silica materials are not soluble and precipitate in the electronic plate, rinse the plate as follows:",
    "Perform steps 3.1.3.1-3.1.3.3 as described for Case 1.\nRinse the microchips with 200 µL deionized water once in the biosafety hood at room temperature.\nRinse the microchips with 200 µL absolute ethanol 2 times at room temperature.\nRinse the microchips with 200 µL 75% ethanol once at room temperature.\nAdd 250 µL of 75% ethanol in each well and seal the electronic plate with the sealing film at room temperature.\nSpin at 114 x g for 2 min and empty the electronic plate. Invert the electronic plate on a sterile gauze or tissue paper to decant the remaining water at room temperature.\nRepeat step 3.2.5-3.2.7 once.\nUltraviolet sterilize the regenerated electronic plate for 1-2 h in the biosafety hood at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Double the volume of all solution when rinsing L8 electronic plates.\n4. Assessment of Regeneration Effect\nOptical characteristics of regenerated electronic plate surface\nUse a steel spoon to carefully disassemble the bottom part of the incubation well of fresh and regenerated electronic plate that contains arrayed gold microelectrodes. Wearing a plastic glove, carefully wipe out the microchip-containing part from the electronic plate using the steel spoon.\nPlace both parts at the center of the glass microscope slides and collect the resulting Raman spectra by Raman Microscope equipped with a CCD detector21.\n\t\tNOTE: The spectrometer was equipped with a 633 nm laser and the spectra was recorded at an interval of 30 s laser exposure at a wavelength in the range of 500-3500 cm-1. The optical images were obtained by a Raman Microscope using a 10x eye lens and 50x objective. Figure 1A and Figure 1C were also obtained using the installed Raman Microscope apparatus.",
    "To evaluate the viability of attached cells after anti-cancer drug uptake on the fresh and regenerated electronic plates, use a confocal laser scanning microscope to monitor the spontaneous fluorescence of DOX molecules absorbed by A549.\n\t\t\nTo record the spontaneous fluorescence of absorbed DOX by the cells (fresh and regenerated electronic plates with A549 cells), use a 63X oil objective and 485 nm as the excitation wavelength.\nElectrochemical behaviors of regenerated electrodes\n\tNOTE: As manual dissembling of a commercial electronic plate is difficult and not ideal for the assessment of surface electric status as checked, the regeneration efficiency of the protocol was evaluated by using normal gold/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as a test platform, on which electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. The diameters of the Au electrode and GCE both are 3 mm. Electrochemical data were obtained by an electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode system and the impedance measurements were carried out using an alternating current (AC) signal of 10 mV amplitude at a wide frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\n\t\nBefore the measurement, polish the Au electrode and GCE to a mirror-like surface with an alumina slurry on a polishing cloth, followed by sonication in water to remove any particles.\nActivate the Au electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4. Obtain EIS data of the bare Au electrode and GCE in 10 mM KCl electrolyte solution containing 1mM K3[Fe(CN)6] as described22.\nPrepare stock A549 cell solution according to 2.1.2 and 2.1.3. Drop 10 µL cell suspension on the surface of Au electrode and GCE. Incubate Au electrode and GCE modified with cells in a 37 oC incubator for 3 h. Obtain EIS data of the Au electrode and GCE modified with cells in 10 mM KCl electrolyte solution containing 1mM K3[Fe(CN)6].",
    "Regenerate the electrodes using the protocol and measure EIS.\nImmerse the Au electrode and GCE modified with cells in 0.25% trypsin for 0.5-2 h. Rinse the Au electrode and GCE softly with water 4 times. Rinse the electrodes softly with absolute ethanol 4 times. Immerge Au electrode and GCE in 75% ethanol for ~5 min. Rinse the chips softly with 75% ethanol 4 times.\nObtain EIS data of regenerated Au electrode and GCE in 10 mM KCl electrolyte solution containing 1mM K3[Fe(CN)6].\nSubscription Required.
