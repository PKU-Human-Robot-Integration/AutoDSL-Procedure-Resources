    "This study follows the guidelines of the Army Medical University's Human Research Ethics Committee. All patients mentioned in the study signed informed consent forms.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nAfter successful nasotracheal intubation, place the patient supine with the head and neck into hyperextension.\nLet the eyes close naturally. Apply eye ointment and cover the area from the top of the brow bone to the nasal flanks with an appropriate eye patch or surgical patch to prevent disinfectant, blood, and other fluids from flowing into the eyes.\nFill both external ear canals with cotton balls to prevent disinfectant and blood from entering the ear canals and cover the face with a cotton pad folded in half lest the face be crushed by the tracheal intubation.\nCover the surface of the cotton pad with a non-woven surgical cap up to the nostrils. Apply surgical lamination externally, down to the level of the upper lip, while leaving the area at the foot of the horizontal line of the corners of the mouth uncovered, the lateral sides of the lamination reaching the edge of the sideburns while its upper side flush with the hairline.\nUse a robot surgical system. Place the patient in the supine position. Administer general anesthesia via nasotracheal intubation as per the anesthetist's recommendations.\n2. Surgical procedure\nInject Lidocaine (10 mL) + Ropivacaine (10 mL) + Adrenaline hydrochloride (10 drops) under the oral mucosa.\nMake an incision of approximately 8 mm above the lower lip ligament. Ensure that the incisions on both sides are approximately 8 mm long, between the sharp teeth and the first molar (Figure 5).\nMaintain the CO2 gas pressure at 6 mmHg and the gas flow rate in the 20 mL/min range.\nDock the robot arm.",
    "Place Maryland bipolar coagulator into the left trocar, and ultrasonic scalpel into the right trocar, completing the flap freeing.\n\t\nUsing an ultrasonic scalpel, separate the flap downward to the clavicle and bilaterally to the anterior border of the Sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nUse unipolar curved scissors to separate the white cervical line and part of the banded muscle to expose a portion of the thyroid gland (Figure 6) and use a 25 G syringe to inject approximately 0.1 mL of carbon nanoparticle suspension injection from the neck to the thyroid parenchyma under surgical observation to complete a negative image to illustrate the parathyroid gland (Figure 7).\nUse an ultrasound knife to release the striated muscle and use 4-0 absorbable sutures to suspend the striated muscle sutures, facilitating surgical visualization.\nInject 1 mL of 2.5 mg/mL indocyanine green intravenously for better visualization and protection of the parathyroid glands. Switch to automatic fluorescence imaging mode for clear visualization of fluorescent parathyroid glands and comparison with non-fluorescent lymph nodes.\nUse an ultrasound knife to disconnect the blood vessels at the upper pole of the thyroid gland while searching for and protecting the parathyroid gland at the upper pole (Figure 8). Use curved bipolar forceps to complete the delicate operation of in situ parathyroid preservation (Figure 9).\nReveal the laryngeal entry of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (Figure 10). Usually, the recurrent laryngeal nerve can be found more quickly within the triangular area formed by the medial parathyroid gland, thyroid gland, and laryngeal muscles. This area is rich in blood supply. Deal with bleeding and exudate at the entry larynx promptly to secure a straight field of view operation and reduce the difficulty of robotic thyroid surgery.",
    "Use the smoke evacuation device (mastoid suction device12; Figure 11) to remove the exudate and blood during the mass resection, maintaining the cleanness of the lens and the definition of the image of the local surgical area, ensuring accurate exposure and protection of recurrent laryngeal nerve during the surgery. Then, conduct the prophylactic unilateral central neck dissection.\nPerform a contralateral hemithyroidectomy with ipsilateral central lymph node prophylactic dissection in the same manner.\nPlace all excised tissues in a specimen bag and remove them. Rinse the wound with saline.\nPlace a negative pressure drainage tube into the thyroid bed through the cervical puncture hole. Use 4-0 absorbable barbed sutures to continuously suture the strap muscles. Use absorbable threads for the suturing of the oral incisions.\nSubscription Required.
