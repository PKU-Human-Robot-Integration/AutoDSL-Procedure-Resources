    "uHPLC setupPrepare and filter all solutions and SEC running buffer (see Recipes): SEC running buffer in line ‘A,’ MQ water in line ‘B’, and 20% EtOH in line ‘C’.Purge the pump with the default settings (3 ml/min, 5 min).In the column compartment, attach a 2,000 Å pore size SEC column for mammalian samples or a 1,000 Å pore size SEC column for drosophila or yeast samples.Flush the column with at least 2 column volumes (CV) of MQ water, using a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at room temperature.Set the temperature of the column compartment at 5°C and that of the autosampler/fraction collection compartment at 4°C (Note 1).Equilibrate the column by flushing with at least 2 CV SEC buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min.Start a blank run to normalize the baseline at 260 and 280 nm.Check an operating pressure of ~160 bar at 5°C using a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min.Inject 100 µl 1 mg/ml BSA solution to block the sites of non-specific interactions.Inject 10 µl 1 mg/ml BSA solution to run as part of the standard and check the separation (Figure 2).Inject 10 µl HyperLadder solution to run as part of the standard and check the separation (Figure 2).Inject standard HeLa cell lysates containing 10 µg RNA (Figure 2) (Note 2).Start another blank run.Sample Preparation (all centrifugations at 4°C)Lysates of human cell linesWash cells in one 100-mm dish (~80% confluence; approximately ~5 × 106 cells) twice with ice-cold PBS.Harvest cells by scraping in 1 ml ice-cold PBS and collect them in a 1.5-ml tube on ice.Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant carefully using an aspirator.Rinse cells with 1 ml ice-cold PBS if needed.",
    "Cell pellets can either be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C or immediately used for lysate preparation (Note 4).Lyse cells by pipetting, vortexing for 10 s in 250 μl polysome extraction buffer, and incubating on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge at 17,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the debris.Collect and filter the supernatants through 0.45-μm Ultrafree-MC HV centrifugal filter units, spinning at 12,000 × g for 2-5 min (Note 3).Transfer the filtrates into new 1.5-ml tubes and leave on ice.Lysates can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C (Note 4).Measure RNA and protein concentrations in the filtrates using a BioPhotometer and a PierceTM 660 nm Protein Assay Kit, respectively.Equalize the concentrations of the samples across the conditions by diluting in polysome extraction buffer (Note 5).Transfer lysates into a vial (12 × 32 mm), close the cap, and keep on ice.(Optional) Place 5 µl protease inhibitors (50× stock solution) and 2 U RNase inhibitors in each well of a 96 deep-well plate.Lysates of Drosophila embryosSet up egg collection cups with w1118 or any other required genotype of flies. Change the apple juice agar plates 2-4 times every day for 2 days.On the day of embryo collection, change the apple juice agar plate twice after 30-min collections. Discard the plates.Subsequently, collect embryos in a fresh plate for 30 min at 25°C.Age the collected embryos for an additional 40 min. At this point, the embryos will be 40-70-min-old and therefore will still be in the syncytial stage.Dechorionate the collected and aged embryos with 5% bleach until most of the embryos rise to the surface of the solution.Wash the embryos thoroughly with tap water and dry on a tissue.Collect the dechorionated embryos using a paintbrush and transfer them to a 1.5-ml tube.",
    "At this point, embryos can either be snap-frozen and stored at -80°C or processed further.Add 400 μl polysome extraction buffer, lyse the embryos with a pestle that fits into the 1.5-ml tube, and incubate on ice for 15 min.Follow the steps ‘g to n’ described in the ‘Lysates of human cell lines.Lysates of budding yeastsGrow yeast cultures on YPD or selective media. Take a sweep of the yeast strain of interest grown on a YPD plate with clean toothpick and inoculate a 5-ml culture.Grow overnight to the early stationary phase. In the morning, inoculate a 500-ml culture with 5 ml overnight culture and grow in a 2-L Erlenmeyer glass flask at 30°C until it reaches OD600 ~1.0.To stabilize the polysomes before harvesting, add cycloheximide (CHX) at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and incubate for 10 min on ice.Spin the cells for 10 min at 4,000 × g and discard the supernatant.Wash the cell pellet with ice-cold TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml CHX.Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml polysome extraction buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml CHX.Separate the resuspended cells into 1-ml aliquots in 2-ml tubes.Cells can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C (Note 4).Add an equal volume of glass beads to the tube and mix.Disrupt the cells in a glass bead beater at 4°C; 2 min bead beating with 2 min interval on ice.Repeat this process 6 times.Take 1 μl disrupted cells and dilute to 10 μl; check under the microscope for ghosting of cells.Centrifuge the disrupted cells at 6,000 × g, 4°C for 5 min.Transfer the supernatant to a pre-cooled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.Clarify the lysates by two successive centrifugations at 11,300 × g, 4°C for 5 min, each time transferring the supernatant carefully to a new pre-cooled 1.5-ml tube.",
    "Lysates can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C (Note 4).Follow steps ‘k to n’ described in the ‘Lysates of human cell lines.’Ribo Mega-SEC runPlace the vial and the plate in the autosampler/fraction collection compartment.Inject 1/5 volume to an equal volume of the lysates and decide the time at which to collect the fractions based on the chromatogram.Set the time for fraction collection in the sequence (Note 6).Analyze the samples using the sequence set up.Sample preparation from Ribo Mega-SEC fractionsFor western blotting, precipitate the proteins by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation followed by an ethanol wash or methanol/chloroform precipitation and resuspend the protein pellets in SDS sample buffer. Where necessary, add Tris to the samples to adjust the pH.To prepare samples for proteomics analysis, digest RNA in the samples with benzonase, reduce and alkylate the proteins, and clean up the proteins using FASP (Wisniewski et al., 2009; Potriquet et al., 2017), which efficiently removes salts and detergents such as heparin and CHAPS. SP3-based protein clean up (Hughes et al., 2014) is an alternative approach that can be used if samples do not need to contain heparin for separating molecules or protein complexes other than ribosomes.To prepare RNA from the fractions, extract RNA using TRIzol LS (Thermo) or an equivalent product. Please note that RNA needs to be re-purified by LiCl precipitation for RNA-Seq or RT-qPCR to remove heparin (Jung et al., 1997).Column maintenance after analyzing samplesFlush with MQ water using at least 2 CV, with a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at room temperature (Note 7, Note 8).Flush with 20% EtOH using at least 2 CV, with a flow rate of 0.2-0.4 ml/min at room temperature.Take the column from the uHPLC and store it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Column cleanupFlush with MQ water using at least 5 CV, with a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at room temperature.Flush with pepsin solution using at least 5 CV, with a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at 37°C; incubate the column for 1 h at 37°C without flow (Note 9).Flush with RNase A solution using at least 5 CV, with a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at 37°C; incubate the column for 1 h at 37°C without flow (Note 9).Flush with 2× SSC, 1% SDS solution using at least 10 CV, with a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at 50°C.Rinse the column with at least 10 CV MQ water, using a flow rate of 0.2-0.8 ml/min at room temperature."
