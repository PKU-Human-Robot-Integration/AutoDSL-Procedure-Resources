    "This protocol is in accordance with the animal care guidelines at the University Medical Centre Goettingen, Germany (33.9-42502-04-15/2056). Depending on specific requirements of individual animal review boards, some of the protocol steps could be modified accordingly.\n1. Abdominal Palpation of KPC Mice\nTo avoid unnecessary ultrasound scans, palpate the mouse abdomen to identify mice which might possibly bear an intraabdominal lesion and should subsequently undergo abdominal ultrasound.\n\t\nPerform abdominal palpation weekly starting from 8 weeks of age in the KPC mouse model. High resolution ultrasound can also be applied in transplanted tumor models (e.g., orthotopics) or other genetically engineered mouse models.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on tumor kinetics and study goal (prevention study, therapeutic intervention study), detection of very small tumors (1-2 mm) is feasible to monitor tumor onset before tumors can be palpated.\nPlace the mouse on the cage grid and gently lift the mouse by the tail and palpate the abdomen by gently going up and down with index and thumb of the non-fixing hand (Figure 1).\nIf the mouse tolerates soft palpation, proceed by slowly increasing the pressure. A larger resistance can easily be detected in the upper and lower abdomen. Sometimes, hard feces can be mistakenly interpreted as a tumor mass.\n2. Preparation of Work Space\nProvide space for at least three different work units: pre-scan area, scanning stage and recovery cage. Required material are depicted in Figure 2.\nClean the main working plate (for example with 70% Ethanol) and switch on the heating platform prior to scanning (Figure 3). Make sure that the target temperature of 38-40 °C is reached before the first mouse is transferred.",
    "Switch on the ultrasound machine and create a new folder for the acquired data (Figure 4). The B-mode setting is applied for abdominal imaging. Further, ensure the abdominal transducer is plugged in the active port of the machine. Fix the transducer head at the top of the working stage by using the transducer mounting system.\nPrepare a recovery cage on a heating plate or thermal mat (or use heating lamp) to ensure post-procedural thermoregulation and speedy recovery of scanned mice. Put a thin layer of tissue as cushion at the bottom of this cage to avoid aspiration of bedding with the risk of suffocation (Figure 5).\n3. Inhalation Anesthesia\nProceed by putting a mouse into the induction chamber. Open the valve for gas carrier flow (1 L/min oxygen or air) and set the isoflurane concentration to 4% allowing a slowly increasing saturation of the induction chamber. Make sure that proper isoflurane scavenging (passive or active filtering) is in place. After about 2-4 min the mouse will usually be under deep sedation.\n\t\nMaintain sedation by administering 2% isoflurane through the nose cone on the working stage.\nCarefully transfer the animal from the induction chamber to the working stage. Check the nose cone for a constant gas flow. Put the mouse snout in the nose cone of the anesthesia line outlet. The regular position for the initial scanning is supine position. The mouse can also be placed on its right or left side to improve visibility of pancreatic head or tail tumors (Figure 6).\nAlthough abdominal ultrasound is not painful per se, perform the foot pinch test as an indicator for a pain free condition and deep anesthetic state. If the mouse is still active or actively moving around, retransfer the animal back in the induction chamber for repeated and prolonged induction.",
    "Use eye protection ointment to prevent corneal injuries due to fluid loss.\nDuring anesthesia, use a monitoring system. However, ECG and rectal temperature is not regularly used for abdominal ultrasound scanning. Importantly, mice lose the ability to thermoregulate under anesthesia. Therefore, closely observe clinical signs for hypothermia or respiratory distress such as gasping or apnea. If any symptom is obvious stop isoflurane and place the mouse in the recovery cage immediately.\n4. Ultrasound Settings\nSwitch on the ultrasound system as described by manufacturer`s instructions. Make sure the primary setting is put on general imaging with the abdominal package activated. Usually B-Mode-imaging is used for data acquisition as a standard.\nAchieve optimized image quality with following parameters: frequency 40 MHz, 2D-gain 25-30 dB, image depth 10 mm, image width 10 mm, 3 focal zones with center between 3-6 mm.\n5. Mouse Preparation\nFix the upper and lower extremity using adhesive tape. Be as careful as possible to avoid any injury to the animal due to fixation (Figure 7).\nRemove all abdominal fur using electronic pet clippers. Due to the fur texture, start from the lower abdomen up to the ribcage. Take care at the processus xiphoideus to avoid skin injuries in this area.\n\tNOTE: Mouse fur reflects ultrasound waves and decreases visibility.\nUse depilatory cream to perform an optimized skin preparation and complete removal of fur. Administer a thin layer of cream onto the shaved abdomen using cotton tips (Figure 8). Remove the cream (after 30 s or later depending on the cream used) with dry tissues followed by plenty of water to completely remove all remnants (Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11). Cream remnants could cause skin and mucosa irritations after the ultrasound and may thus affect the health.",
    "To ensure adequate scanning conditions apply plenty of ultrasound gel onto the abdomen (Figure 12). Usually, warm ultrasound gel is used in order to minimize hypothermia for the mouse.\nManually apply a thin layer of ultrasound gel on the transducer head. Perform a test by touching on the transducer end with the notch. At the screen a signal at the left upper side can be seen if the transducer is correctly positioned.\n6. Abdominal Ultrasound\nAdjust the transducer onto the abdomen using firm pressure. Heavy compression of the mouse abdomen may lead to respiratory or circulatory impairment and should be avoided.\nScan up and down. Adjust the frame of the working platform and the wheels for x-axis and y-axis.\nAs the first step identify both kidneys. Usually they appear as hyperechogenic homogenous structures in the lower abdomen. The connected vena renalis can be easily found which further leads to the vena cava inferior (Figure 13).\nUse the vena lienalis serves as landmark vessel for the pancreas. Attempt to distinguish between vena renalis and vena lienalis. Upon detection of the vena lienalis the pancreas can be exactly localized. The normal pancreas is rather a membrane spread through the abdominal cavity than a solid structure (Figure 14 and Figure 15).\n7. Pancreatic Tumor Detection and Volume Evaluation\nIdentify pancreatic lesions from all surrounding structures. They generally appear as hypoechoic inhomogeneous round or elongated tissue masses (Figure 16). The tumor is usually firm and can hardly be compressed by the scan head. Note, from time to time it might be tricky to clearly distinguish between a tumor and a small bowel loop. Pay attention to the bowel peristalsis that should not be observed in pancreatic tumors.",
    "Upon tumor detection screen up and down to get an impression of the total size and measure the largest diameter by using the ultrasound caliper. Once a suitable image is found, freeze the screen and use the measure tool to precisely determine the tumor size. Note, for later use it will be important to differentiate whether a tumor is localized in the tail, body or head of the pancreas.\nBefore changing back to live mode, make sure to save pictures to record the work. Note, while freezing the image it might happen that the adjustment wheel is released, and the ultrasound probe is even more pressed to the mouse abdomen. Therefore, fix the adjustment of the compression before changing the mode to freeze.\nAfter finishing the measurement of the first plane either rotate the scan head by 90° in longitudinal position (Figure 17), or turn the mouse to its side, to detect the tumors' longitudinal expansion. Some tumors may require changing the position of the mouse for adequate visibility. For pancreatic tail tumors, the mouse can be placed on its right side (Figure 10 and Figure 19), for pancreatic head tumors on its left side (Figure 11 and Figure 20).\n8. Quantification of Tumor Volume\nNote: One major aim of all efforts is the correct determination of tumor volume. Although there are several techniques available a calculation method including the formula of an ellipsoid is preferred at the University Medical Center Goettingen.\nEquipped with all three previously obtained diameters, calculate the approximate volume of the corresponding tumor (Figure 21).\nAlternatively, use a motor system of the scan head to perform an automated scan of the tumor region with subsequent volume calculation and 3-D-reconstruction.\n9. Recovery",
    "After the scanning, carefully remove all adhesive tape and carefully remove all ultrasound gel with dry tissue.\nCarefully transfer the mouse into the recovery cage ( Figure 21). Avoid any covering tissue at the mouse´s face that might cause respiratory impairment. A side position for recovery should be preferred.\nSubscription Required.
