The construct used and brain regions targeted will vary\n      depending on the user’s experimental goals.\n    \n        Select the appropriate virus for your brain region, species, and\n        experimental question.\n        \n            The efficacy of virally induced protein expression can vary widely\n            depending on the amount and titer of the virus injected, model\n            species used, virus serotype, and targeted brain region.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCritical: If you are using a\n              new optogenetic construct, consider doing an expression study to\n              determine how well your viral construct expresses the opsin in the\n              desired species/brain region and assess the best dilution to\n              obtain robust expression without overexpression or neurotoxicity.\n            \n                See Resendez et al. (2016)6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] for\n                dilution study methodology applicable to any protein of\n                interest.\n              \n            Different constructs have different light sensitivities and\n            absorption spectra.\n          \n            Additionally, many optogenetic constructs can alter intrinsic ion\n            concentrations and biophysics after extended illumination7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\n            Note that presently μLEDs only produce blue light (centered emission\n            at 460 nm), so make sure to choose an opsin that is activated by\n            this wavelength of light.\n            \nNote: The use of transgenic\n              animals, such as the Thy1-ChR2-YFP mouse line, which expresses\n              channelrhodopsin across multiple brain regions, can obviate the\n              need for viral delivery altogether.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\n        Infuse virus of interest. See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\n        \n            Prepare the rodent for surgery using standard techniques and\n            protocols approved by your institution.\n            \n                Perform a craniotomy just large enough to accommodate your\n                infusion needle at the area of interest.\n              \n                Stop any blood flow using pressure and cold, sterile saline or\n                artificial cerebral fluid.\n                \nNote: See10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\n                  and11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] for details on\n                  anesthesia, scalp opening, skull preparation, etc.\n                \n            Carefully note any adjustments necessary to properly level and align\n            the rodent in the stereotaxic apparatus.",
    "Critical: Matching up your\n              infusion and probe implant coordinates precisely is vital, and\n              even small mismatches can result in failed experiments,\n              particularly for deeper brain regions.\n            \n                This is mainly a concern when viral delivery and probe implant\n                are performed on different days, typically 2–3 weeks later.\n              \n                Always adjust the rodent’s nose as required during both infusion\n                and implant procedures to ensure that the skull is level for\n                each procedure.\n              \n                If you find that the infusion craniotomy site is not readily\n                visible when you attempt to perform your probe implants, you can\n                score the skull surface in the shape of a plus or a circle\n                (centered on the infusion site) with a dental drill at the time\n                of the viral infusion to clearly mark your target skull areas.\n              \n            Load 1.5–2 μL of virus into a 10 μL syringe with a small gauge\n            needle and affix the syringe to an automatic or manual injector\n            attached to a stereotaxic arm.\n            \n                A 10 μL Nanofill syringe with a 35ga beveled needle and a\n                Neurostar Injection Robot were used in this protocol, as shown\n                in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\n              \n                We typically perform three injections of 250 nL (50 nL/min) each\n                at desired site and +/- 250 μm (total 750 nL) to maximize\n                expression in our target area, but you may choose to inject\n                other volumes of your construct.\n                \nNote: The desired depth of\n                  infusion depends on the experiment and brain region of\n                  interest.\n                \n            Lower needle and infuse virus.\n            \n                Slowly lower needle or pipette to the lowest injection site,\n                leave for 10 min to let settle.\n              \n                Inject at 50 nL/min and wait 10 min to allow for diffusion.\n              \n                Raise to next site and repeat steps i-ii until finished.\n                \nNote: For deep brain regions,\n                  we recommend performing an additional injection of 250 nL",
