    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGuide tube fabrication (day 1)\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThis step will produce the GRIN lens guide tube to be used for implantation. Guide tubes should be fabricated no later than one day before the implantation surgery, to allow glue to set in. The compound guide tube consists of two sections: an upper mounting and a lower implant section which are glued together tip-to-tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). The compound guide tube will be mounted into the stereotaxic arm holder via the upper section which will be detached upon tube implantation (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nNote: It is critical to choose the appropriate length for the guide tube. When implanted it should not protrude more than 1–2 mm from the skull surface to minimize risks of damage while the animal is freely moving in the cage between imaging sessions which could be days to months apart. However, some protrusion is required to leave enough room for proper cementation to skull. The mounting section of the guide tube should be long enough (e.g., 15 mm) for successful attachment to the cannula holder of the stereotaxic frame.\nCut two pieces of thin-walled capillary glass tubing (1.5 mm inner diameter, 0.3 mm wall thickness) which will serve as the implantation and the mounting sections of the guide tube. For MBH imaging in the lateral hypothalamus region, we chose 6.5 mm for the implantation and 15 mm for the mounting section, respectively.\nAlign the glass capillary with a ruler under a stereomicroscope and mark cut positions lightly using a diamond scriber.\nSet aside the ruler and scratch all around the perimeter of the tubing at the cut positions using a diamond scriber.\nCarefully bend the tubing by hand until it breaks at the marked position.",
    "Critical: The directionality of the 2 tube pieces is important as they will be glued back together at the point of breakage at the very end of the fabrication process. Make a note which side corresponds to the “broken” side.\nPolish the bottom tip of the section that will be inserted into the brain with sanding paper. Polish until surface is planar and perpendicular to the tube walls to enable proper sealing. Clean with sterile water and/or a compressed air duster to ensure absence of dust at the luminal side of the capillary walls.\nCreate a cover glass disk for sealing the lower tip of the implantation section.\nUse diamond cutter to cut out a small disk (1.8–2.0 mm in diameter, if glass tubing inner diameter is 1.5 mm) from a #0-thickness (80–130 μm) cover glass under the stereomicroscope.\nCarefully trim extra glass from disk using forceps.\nInspect disk surface under the stereomicroscope for the absence of any scratches or dust. If dust cannot be completely removed, discard the disk.\nSeal the polished tip of the guide tube (step 2) with the disk.\nApply a small amount of UV light-activatable glue onto the rim of the polished tip using a fine applicator (e.g., a needle tip).\nImmediately thereafter place cover glass disk on the capillary tip.\nHold the disk with forceps, positioning it right above the capillary tip, and then loosen the forceps so that the disk lands right on the glue coated tip.\nMake sure the glue is not spreading along the inner walls of the guide tube or further onto the cover glass. Otherwise remove and discard cover glass and repeat step 4.\nOnce the cover glass is positioned properly, proceed with glue curing by UV light. Glue curing time is ∼15–20 s.",
    "Carefully remove any protruding portions of the cover glass using sanding paper. A diamond cutter could be used in this step if the disk is too large, however, extra care should be applied.\nGlue the implantation and the mounting sections of the guide tube together tip-to-tip.\nAlign both “broken” parts under the stereomicroscope.\nApply a thin layer of white craft glue to the tube outer surfaces where the two pieces will be joined. The glue should not seep into the tubing when joining the parts.\nEnsure that the glue completely dries (i.e., transforms into a clear film).\nRinse the guide tube with 70% ethanol.\nCritical: We recommend waiting at least 12 h before proceeding with the next step.\nPrepare a pedestal for the guide tube\nCut a circular piece from standard printing paper twice the diameter of the guide tube and render it into a collar through two perpendicular incisions at the center as illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C (red dashed lines). The extent of the incisions should roughly match the outer diameter of the guide tube.\nSlip the collar (which serves as the pedestal) over the guide tube with the four cut corners facing in the upward direction as illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C (in red). The pedestal should be movable along the vertical axis of the guide tube yet sit tight enough to remain where positioned.\nStore fabricated guide tubes in sterile 6-well plates until further use.\nGuide tube implantation (day 2)\nTiming: ∼1 h",
    "This step will result in guide tube implantation. For intravital hypothalamic imaging, the following coordinates were used: anteroposterior −1.8 mm, lateral +0.95 mm, dorsoventral −5.0 mm below the skull. We found that survival rate critically depends on pre-operative age, weight, and general health of the mouse. 10–15 weeks old mice that weighed no less than 23–25 g seem optimal for this procedure and recover well from surgery. After implantation, house mice individually for the duration of study to minimize risk of guide tube displacement or damage. See “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” before proceeding.\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injections of the ketamine/xylazine cocktail and apply ophthalmic ointment to eyes. Shave most dorsal portion of mouse head and disinfect the exposed area with betadine. Place anesthetized mouse in surgical stereotaxic frame. Keep animal on a heating blanket during the surgery.\nExpose the cranium around the area by skin incisions at midline ∼1 cm in length using a scalpel, secure the skin with surgical clamps, and remove the periosteum with a cotton swab damped in 0.9% saline solution.\nConduct circular craniotomy above the area of interest using a microdrill with the drill hole diameter exceeding the guide tube diameter by 20%–25%. Remove dura using forceps. Stop bleeding with triangular-shaped cotton absorption swab if needed.\nStereotaxically position the blunt-tip syringe needle over the area of interest and lower the tip into the brain parenchyma down to 0.5 mm above the area of interest (e.g., −4.5 mm below skull for the MBH).\nWhen desired depth is reached, pull the syringe plunger until the piston’s distal edge meets the 0.1 mL mark and slowly (∼0.5 mm/s) lift the stereotaxic arm holding the needle.",
    "Once the needle exits the brain, the parenchymal tissue column (∼1.4 mm in diameter and 4.5 mm in height) will be automatically aspirated into the syringe barrel due to negative pressure. If aspiration is insufficient (assessed upon inspection of the aspirated tissue column, now inside the barrel), repeat aspiration until all of the desired tissue is removed.\nIf more than one aspiration cycle is required, rinse drill hole with 0.9% saline in between cycles and remove excess fluids/blood with the triangular absorption swab.\nApply a small amount of instant adhesive at the bottom side of the pedestal. Be careful to not apply the glue to the guide tube itself.\nStereotaxically lower the guide tube into the aspirated path. Once the guide tube reaches the desired coordinates, depress pedestal/collar onto the skull. Allow for the glue to dry.\nApply a small amount of instant glue between each of the four corners of the pedestal and the guide tube wall and gently press corners against the wall. Let dry.\nApply a thin layer of dental cement on top of the pedestal. Let it harden completely.\nUsing a stereomicroscope, carefully peel off the clear glue film where the tube sections connect using a sharp needle tip. Gently lift and remove the mounting section.\nApply one more layer of dental cement to fully secure the guide tube implant. Be careful to not let any dental cement enter the inside of the tube.\nSeal the top of the implant with reusable adhesive or tape to prevent debris from entering into tube.\nClip extra skin around the guide tube if necessary. Administer carprofen and place mouse in a cage kept on a heating blanket while recovering from anesthesia. Inject 1 mL of warm (37C) sterile saline subcutaneously to prevent dehydration.

    "Note: Allow 3–4 weeks for animal to recover from surgery before proceeding to the next step.\nIntravital imaging (day 3, ∼3–4 weeks after surgery)\nTiming: Up to 1.5 h\nThis step describes the intravital imaging procedure for the visualization of fluorescently-labeled cells that reside below the tip of the implanted guide tube. Guide tube-based imaging enables interchangeable use of multiple GRIN lenses within a single imaging session.\nNote: In our particular case, two types of GRIN micro-objectives (GRIN-TECH, Germany) were used with the following specifications: A) 0.7 mm diameter; object side: 800 μm working distance (WD), 0.50 numerical aperture (NA); image side: 100 μm WD, 0.19 NA; geometrical length: 15.86 mm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D); B) 1.4 mm diameter; object side: 200 μm WD, 0.8 NA; image side: 200 μm WD, 0.18 NA; geometrical length: 7.39 mm; additionally features a plano-convex lens at the object side (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: Type A) was used for low resolution and type B) for high resolution, cellular imaging. The GRIN lenses we chose were between ∼7–15 mm long. Endoscope length can be varied at increments of 0.5 pitch. Use of shorter endoscopes is desirable to minimize aberration, but may impede handling and compatibility with the lens holder. The lenses were used in two modalities – upright and inverted (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) - which enabled imaging at low (inverted) and high (upright) magnifications to capture population overviews or cellular details, respectively.\nNote: A custom-fabricated GRIN-lens holder (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G and 1H) was employed to ensure stable alignment of the GRIN lens with the 20× microscope objective (Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27, WD=0.55 mm, Zeiss) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).",
    "Note: A typical imaging session may last up to 1.5 h. Isoflurane anesthesia can be possibly used as alternatively to ketamine-xylazine, however anesthesia depth may not be sufficient to prevent breathing-induced movements which may create imaging artifacts. Note, that we used the same high NA 20× microscope objective regardless of GRIN lens type or position (upright versus inverted). Thus objective NA and the endoscope image-side NA where either matching (high NA endoscope in inverted position) or the image-side NA was lower, which is in line with previous recommendations in the context of GRIN lens-based deep brain imaging (Barretto and Schnitzer, 2012b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, while we were able to obtain high resolution images in the (sub)micron range despite mismatching NAs, matching NAs may generally help with resolving fine structures such as synaptic spines (Meng et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine-xylazine cocktail. Apply ophthalmic ointment to eyes to prevent drying during the imaging session. Place and secure anesthetized mouse in holding frame (Kopf) to be positioned underneath objective. Keep animal on a heating blanket during the imaging session.\nPosition the mouse head under the dissecting microscope and carefully remove the protective seal/adhesive that covers the top of the guide tube with forceps.\nNote: Focus on the bottom of the guide tube and adjust the head position of the mouse so that when looking down through both eyepieces simultaneously, the bottom of the guide tube forms an oval as illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I.",
    "Note: A more circular shape indicates misalignment between objective and tube and thus the mouse head position should be corrected to allow for a perfectly vertical in-line alignment of the guide tube and the objective-attached GRIN lens. Position correction will be attained by careful adjustments to the head holder of the stereotaxic frame which is freely adjustable in all 3 dimensions.\nInspect the tube inner wall and the cover glass for dust particles using the stereomicroscope. If necessary, inject H2O using 1 mL insulin syringe and dry with absorbing tissue (Kimwipes).\nCritical: Extra caution should be taken when rinsing the guide tube to prevent damage to the cover glass at the tube bottom).\nOptional: For vasculature labeling, inject e.g., fluorescein-isothiocyanate dextran (20 mg/ml saline) intravenously into mouse tail vein immediately prior to the imaging session. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nAttach GRIN lens holder to microscope. Slip holder cuff without the disk onto the 20× objective and tighten holder screw (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G and 1H).\nFor low magnification, wide FOV, insert 1.4 mm GRIN lens in inverted direction through the central bore of the custom-fabricated plastic disc (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nInsert disc into holder, secure with clips (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nNote: The upper tip of the GRIN lens should be positioned so that the distance to the objective equals the sum of the objective’s and GRIN lens’ focal plane distances. Depending on the design of the custom holder, this can be done manually or using the holder’s z-axis positioning.\nMagnification can be simply changed by reversing the orientation of the GRIN lens in disc. To provide a different set of magnifications, the 0.7 mm GRIN lens can be employed. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].",
    "Note: Parameters for one/two-photon imaging depend on the experimental design. For example, we used the following excitation/emission filters for confocal mode imaging: ∼480/520 nm for fluorescein-conjugated dextran and ∼555/580 nm for tdTomato protein. Image resolution was typically 512 × 512 pixels acquired at scan speeds of 0.5–1 pixels/μs with a pin hole size of 2–14 airy units using the microscope’s image acquisition software (ZEN). Lowest possible laser power should be used to minimize imaging-induced tissue damage.\nPosition the stereotaxic imaging frame which holds the mouse underneath the GRIN lens so that it is aligned with the guide tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nGently lower the objective-GRIN lens assembly into the guide tube.\nWhen the lens tip approaches the bottom of the guide tube, a fluorescence signal from labeled cells/vasculature should become detectable.\nLower the objective-GRIN assembly further until the desired imaging area is reached. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9].\nCritical: We recommend that the lens holder allows for some movement of the GRIN lens along the vertical axis. This is to prevent damage to the cover glass at the guide tube bottom in case the lens is accidentally lowered too far into the guide tube.\nTo maximize the effective field of view, the GRIN lens X-Y position within the guide tube can be altered by manually changing the X-Y position of the microscope stage (in cases where the guide tube is substantially wider than GRIN lens).\nNote: Visualization of the vasculature by i.v. fluorescent dextran may help with tracking individual cells over time.",
    "Once imaging is completed, lift the objective-GRIN lens assembly, replace the lens with a different lens if necessary or end the imaging session by resealing the guide tube with protective adhesive. Return animal to its home cage placed on a heating blanket until full recovery from anesthesia. Animals can be re-imaged at intervals ranging from days to at least a few months."
