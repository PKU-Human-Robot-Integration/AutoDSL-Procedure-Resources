    "Note: All the soft pneumatic grippers were fabricated by casting silicone-based elastomeric mixtures into customized 3D-printed molds, which followed a fabrication process comprising three steps: molding gripper-arm components with embedded pneumatic channels, molding chamber component connected to the pneumatic channels, and sealing the chamber component filled with air.\n1. Preparation of Elastomers\nPlace a container for mixer on a weighing scale and tare it. Pour parts A and B of the silicone-based elastomer in the container with a 1:1 weight ratio.\nCover the container and measure the total weight.\nPlace the container and material into a centrifugal mixer. Adjust the weight balance on the mixer to the weight measured in step 1.2.\nSet the mixing and de-aeration modes to 2,000 rpm and 2,200 rpm respectively for 30 sec. Mix the elastomer components thoroughly to achieve uniform curing.\n2. Mold Design and Production\nNote: The geometry of the mold will vary depending on the specific requirements for different applications. The following steps illustrate general key steps in CAD software that are required to create the chamber and gripper component of the mold.\nDesign the molds and sealing mold using computer-aided design (CAD) software.
