    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue processing for the preparation of single cell suspension\nTiming: 2–3 h\nHere a solution of single cells will be prepared starting from the tissue or cell system of origin.\nThe time for obtaining a single cell preparation depends on the starting tissue. For isolating neural stem cells, neuroblasts and neurons, the times per mouse are explained below. Subventricular zone and olfactory bulb dissociation: 15 min. Tissue processing and single cell preparation with the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (NTDK, Miltenyi, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]): 40 min (follow the manufacturer protocol: https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001320.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001320.PDF]). Antibody labeling and final wash: 30 min. For more information on the sorting strategy see the following paper (Kremer et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nFor the isolation of single cells from pancreatic organoids the times are explained below. Incubation of organoid with TrypLE Express: 30 min. Washing and single cell resuspension: 30 min. For more information on the generation of pancreatic organoids, see the following papers (Wollny et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Krieger et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nSingle cell collection and methyltransferase reaction\nTiming: 1 h\nThrough this step, cells will be sorted into 384-well plates and will undergo a reaction with a methyltransferase to obtain information about DNA accessibility.",
    "Prepare a single cell suspension of your cell type of interest. Then proceed to cell collection. Collect cells on individual wells of a low binding 384-well plate. For sorting live cells, we use Sytox ™ blue dead cell stain (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) on our sorting strategy. The use of FACS is preferred. Alternatively, cell printing devices like cellenONE® (Cellenion) can also be used. The collection solution is composed of a mild lysis buffer (IGEPAL CA-630), used to permeabilize the nuclear membrane and a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI), which adds methyl groups to cytosines in GpC islands located in non-nucleosome bound DNA. The latter allows the assessment of chromatin accessibility throughout the genome.\nPrepare GpC methyltransferase reaction buffer. Prepare fresh and keep on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_7.csv\nAdd 1 μL of the mix into every well of a 384-well plate. Index sort single cells on the plate. Index sorting is a mode of the FACS instrument that allows the isolation of single cells while recording the coordinates of all fluorescence and scatter parameters for each individual event. It is advisable to keep the temperature of the plate holder at 4°C during sorting.\nOptional: Sort minibulks of 25–100 cells per cell type into single wells as positive control and to obtain a deeper coverage from both the transcriptome and the genome of specific cell populations. For minibulks, the volume per well and the incubation time can remain the same as with single cells.\nCritical: The FACS sorter or cell printing device (e.g FACS Aria II) should have a 4°C cooling block, to keep the methyltransferase reaction inhibited until all the cells are sorted.\nAfter sorting, centrifuge the plate at 1,000 × g for 10 s.",
    "Incubate on a thermocycler for 15 min at 37°C with the lid at 50°C. Add 2 μL of RLT Plus buffer and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 20 s.\nPause point: Store plate at −80°C or proceed directly with the separation of the mRNA and gDNA.\nSeparation of mRNA from gDNA\nOligo dT bead preparation\nTiming: 40 min\nHere the binding of the dynabeads to the oligo-dT takes place through the strong interaction between Streptavidin and Biotin. To that end, we prepare and wash the dynabeads with a series of buffers.\nAdd 225 μL Dynabeads (MyOne Streptavidin C1) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Place on a magnet, wait 30 s and remove supernatant (SN).\nWash the beads with Solutions A, B and B&W buffer.\nResuspend beads in 400 μL of Solution A by pipetting outside the magnet. Place on magnet, wait 30 s and remove the SN.\nRepeat step a one more time.\nResuspend beads in 200 μL of Solution B by pipetting outside the magnet. Place on magnet, wait 30 s and remove the SN.\nResuspend the beads in 225 μL of 2× B&W buffer and add 225 μL of Oligo-dT-SS3 (100 μM).\nIncubate by rotation for 15 min at 18°C–25°C.\nPause point: This solution can be stored overnight at 4°C.\nPrepare the bead resuspension solution, G&T wash buffer + RNAse inhibitor and the reverse transcription (RT) Master Mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_8.csv\nStore on ice until use. Once used to resuspend the Oligo-dT beads, aliquot solution into a fresh 384-well plate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_9.csv\nStore on ice until use.",
    "Optional: Aliquot the G&T wash buffer + RNAse Inhibitor in a new plate to increase the efficiency of the separation of mRNA and gDNA. By aliquoting the G&T wash buffer in a different plate, we reduced the time for transferring the wash buffer to the sample plate, thereby decreasing the time that the beads are drying out. Over-drying beads might prevent an efficient elution of the mRNA in the RT mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_10.csv\nStore on ice until use.\nBead resuspension and separation of genomic and transcriptomic fractions\nTiming: 30 min\nThrough these steps the polyadenylated RNAs will bind to the oligo-dT-bound dynabeads which will be kept on the well through the use of a magnetic block. On a second step, the gDNA will be separated from the RNA faction by a series of washes.\nResuspend the beads in 400 μL of B&W buffer 1× by pipetting outside the magnet. Place on magnet, wait 30 s and remove the SN. Repeat this step 3 times more to reach a total of 4 washes.\nResuspend beads with the prepared Bead Resuspension solution. Mix by vortexing thoroughly 15 s (we apply 2500 rpm for vortexing).\nCritical: After resuspending the beads with the bead resuspension solution, please use the solution within the next 30 min, to keep the RNAse inhibitor within its optimal activity time window.\nTransfer 4 μL of bead resuspension solution to the mRNA plate. Vortex 30 s at maximum speed, spin down the plate and incubate 3 min at 18°C–25°C. Repeat twice more to reach a total incubation time of approx. 10 min. After the incubation centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature (RT, 18°C–25°C).\nSeparation of gDNA from polyadenylated RNAs.\nPlace the plate on magnet and incubate 2 min until the suspension is clear.",
    "Aspirate 7 μL from the mRNA plate still on the magnet and transfer to the gDNA plate.\nAdd 5 μL of G&T wash buffer to the mRNA plate.\nVortex mRNA plate for 30 s, spin down on a benchtop centrifuge for 10 s and incubate 1 min.\nRepeat step d two more times to achieve an incubation time of 5 min. Centrifuge the mRNA plate for 1 min at 1,000 × g.\nPut mRNA plate on magnet, incubate 2 min and transfer SN to gDNA plate.\nRepeat steps c-f twice more. Now you have 22 μL of gDNA eluate on the gDNA plate. Store the gDNA plate at −20°C until proceeding with the gDNA library preparation at step 38.\nImmediately add 2 μL of the 18°C–25°C mix to the mRNA plate on ice.\nTranscriptomic part\nReverse transcription, cDNA amplification and cDNA purification\nTiming: 6 h\nHere the polyadenylated RNA will be retrotranscribed, and then subsequently amplified. At the end the cDNA will be purified with magnetic beads.\nReverse transcription and cDNA amplification.\nThrough these steps the polyA mRNA will be reverse-transcribed and amplified. Afterwards, the obtained cDNA will be purified before proceeding with tagmentation and library amplification.\nThe first PCR is a standard reverse transcription reaction with no amplification step. In the following PCR amplification step, generating a double stranded cDNA from the single stranted cDNA template needs to be optimized per cell type to ensure amplification of just sufficient cDNA with minimal PCR amplification bias. For testing this, we advise users to prepare a so-called validation plate per cell type to run tests for determining RNA quality and optimal PCR cycle before proceeding with a sample plate.\nIncubate plate on a thermocycler as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_11.csv",
    "Optional: A pre-wash of unbound TSO before proceeding to the cDNA amplification step might help reducing TSO dimers (peak between 80 and 150 bp in the Bioanalyzer traces). To avoid this, perform a TSO wash after the reverse transcription. We therefore advise to perform a test run with few samples to see whether TSO dimers represent a problem for the tested samples. If so, proceed with TSO wash.\nAfter reverse transcription, place mRNA plate on magnet and incubate 3 min.\nDiscard SN. Add 20 μL of 1× RT buffer.\nVortex 30 s and spin down. Incubate on magnet 3 min. Discard SN and add TSO-wash cDNA amplification master mix (5 μL).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_12.csv\nIf no TSO wash is performed, prepare cDNA amplification master mix (MM) and add 3 μL of the MM to the plate. Vortex gently and spin down on benchtop centrifuge.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_13.csv\nIncubate plate on thermocycler as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_14.csv\nNote: Cycle number depends strongly on the cell type used. In our case we used 24 cycles for primary NSCs, astrocytes, oligodentrocytes, neuroblasts and neurons. For pancreatic organoid cells we used 20 cycles. It is advisable to test different cycle numbers between 18 and 25 before proceeding with the full protocol. A concentration of more than 0.3 ng/μL and the lack of fragments smaller than 500 bp are characteristics of a good cDNA profile.\nPause point: Store at 4°C up to 16 h or proceed directly with the purification of the cDNA.\ncDNA purification: Bead clean-up.\nEquilibrate AMPure XP beads at 18°C–25°C for 30 min. Add 3 μL of beads to the mRNA plate (reaching 0.6× ratio of beads to sample volume).",
    "Vortex for 30 s and spin down. Incubate 3 min. Repeat twice more to reach a total of 10 min of incubation at RT. Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 × g for 1 min.\nDuring the incubation time prepare 18 mL of EtOH 80% and aliquot 41 μL into a new 384-well plate.\nIncubate the mRNA plate 2 min on magnet. Discard the SN and perform the following step twice (EtOH wash):\nAdd 20 μL of EtOH 80% to the mRNA plate (on magnet). Wait 30 s and discard SN. Let the beads from the mRNA plate dry for 2 min, until no EtOH 80% is seen on the wells.\nRemove mRNA plate from magnet. Add 8 μL of nuclease-free water. Vortex 30 s, spin down and incubate 1 min at RT. Repeat the vortexing and incubation two times more, to reach a total of 5 min incubation.\nPlace the plate on magnet for 2 min and transfer SN to a new plate (cDNA plate).\nPerform quality control:\nMeasure the concentration of 10 random samples (wells) with Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit as described by the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf]):\nMix 1 μL of sample + 199 μL of a mix consisting of 199 μL of Qubit HS buffer + 1 μL of Qubit reagent. Vortex and measure on Qubit™ Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nLoad 1 μL of the 10 samples onto a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (or TapeStation, Agilent) (concentration should not exceed 5 ng/μL, otherwise dilute in nuclease-free water before loading). Follow the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/G2938-90322_HighSensitivityDNAKit_QSG.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/G2938-90322_HighSensitivityDNAKit_QSG.pdf]).\nCheck the quality of the cDNA (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] that displays good quality cDNA profiles, and troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1937-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Note that the proportion of primer dimer (50–150 bp) is lower than the one of the cDNA fragments (400–10000 bp). The proportion of primer dimers should not exceed the one showed here. Parts of this figure are created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nOptional: To get a better overview of the quality of the whole plate, the concentration of all the samples (384) can be measured using a fluorescent microplate reader (Biotek Synergy LX, Agilent) together with the Quant-IT™ PicoGreen™ dsDNA Assay-Kit. This also allows an optimal normalization of the cDNA before proceeding to the tagmentation.\nFor more information follow the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp07581.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp07581.pdf]).\nTagmentation-based library preparation\nTiming: 2 h\nThrough these steps, the cDNA will be tagmented with sequencing adaptors and indexed. This allows the final multiplexing of the 384 or 768 single cells, depending on whether you plan to sequence 1 or 2 plates on the same transcriptomics sequencing run. For more information about the amount of input and cycle number required for the tagmentation process, please refer to the Smart-seq3 protocol.\nTagmentation.\nNormalize the cDNA to a concentration of 1 ng/μL. If the overall concentration of the plate is lower, normalize to 0.7 ng/μL and adjust appropriately the reaction volumes.\nIf a microplate reader is not available, average the concentration measurements from 10–15 random cells and then dilute the cDNA to the final concentration of 1 ng/μL with nuclease-free water.\nIf a microplate reader is available, determine the cDNA concentrations and add the proper volumes of water per well in order to normalize the concentration of each well to 0.4–2.5 ng/μL. This can be done with Mantis.",
    "Prepare the tagmentation master mix and aliquot 1.2 μL on a new plate (tagmentation plate).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_15.csv\nAdd 0.4 μL of normalized cDNA (100–1000 pg of input) to the tagmentation plate. Vortex 30 s, and spin down. Repeat vortex and spin two times more. Incubate on thermocycler.\nNote: Input amounts of cDNA can vary. For a specific table describing the input amount for tagmentation please refer to the Smart-seq2 (Picelli et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) and Smart-seq3 (Hagemann-Jensen et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) papers. In addition, if having remaining TSO dimers from the cDNA amplification part, increase the input amount to compensate for their presence. The same procedure can be applied in case of obtaining suboptimal profiles after tagmentation (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_16.csv\nAdd 0.4 μL of 0.2% SDS to the tagmentation plate. Vortex for 30 s and spin down. Incubate 5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nOptional: Instead of 0.2% SDS, NT buffer (Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit) can be used.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_17.csv\nLibrary amplification.\nAdd 1.2 μL of Nextera PCR master mix (NPM) to the tagmentation plate.\nOptional: Alternatively, KAPA HiFi ready mix (2×) can be used instead of the Nextera PCR master mix. In this case use 3.2 μL instead of 1.2 μL for the final mix. Our experience shows that the results are similar by comparing the use of the 2 polymerases. If using the KAPA mix, make sure to keep the same proportion of beads to the sample volume in the further clean-up steps.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_18.csv\nAdd 0.8 μL of Nextera Primer index mix (i5 + i7 indexes combined at a concentration of 12.5 μM, see enclosed table with the index sequences: Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1937-Mmc1.xlsx]: mRNA index primers).

    "Note: Example layout of indexes for multiplexing 768 cells for the same sequencing run (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). This strategy uses combinatorial indexing and the numbers represent the indexes used. We provide the files with the index sequences in a format that can be easily used for ordering the oligos (5er and 7er indexes). The original design of the primers can be found here (Buenrostro et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1937-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. mRNA library amplification indexes\nThe figure shows the possible combinations of i5 and i7 indexes in order to multiplex 768 cells on a single sequencing run.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1937_19.csv\nCritical: Cycle number can be adjusted according to the input of cDNA. For primary NSCs, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neuroblasts and neurons we have used 13 cycles for an input of 500 pg. For pancreatic organoids we have used 12 cycles for an input of 400 pg. However, the number of cycles and the amount of input depend on the cell type. When using KAPA instead of Nextera PCR Mastermix, the PCR conditions are different for certain steps, as follows. Denaturation: 98°C for 20, Annealing: 63°C for 15 s. For more information on input and cycle number please refer to the Smart-seq2 and Smart-seq3 protocols.\ncDNA library purification, quality control and sequencing\nTiming: 4 h\nThrough these steps the cDNA library will be purified and checked for quality control.\nPurification by bead clean-up.\nEquilibrate AMPure XP beads at RT for 30 min.

Pooling procedure:\nUse Mosquito™ HV (SPT Labtech) to aspirate 5 μL from every column of the source plate (sample plate) and transfer to one column of a deep-well plate (called pool plate). Always change tips between transfers, to avoid contamination between the samples.\nAfter pooling into a single column, use a normal 1000 μL pipette to transfer the contents into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. The ideal amount should be 384∗5=1920 μL. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down 10 times. The volume might be sometimes less than 1920 μL.",

    "The pool can be sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer (or another non-patterned flow cell Sequencer: HiSeq2000, NextSeq500). Because of the combinatorial indexing that is used on this part of the protocol, it is recommended to sequence on a non-patterned flow cell, since sequencing on a patterned flow cell might lead to index hopping (more information at: https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/ngs-library-prep/multiplexing/index-hopping.html[href=https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/ngs-library-prep/multiplexing/index-hopping.html]). For an 1-plate run (384 cells) it is advisable to sequence it on a NexSeq 550 75 bp Paired End Mid output (MO) (104 million reads), in order to reach 300,000 reads per cell. For a 2-plate run (786 cells) the NS550 75 bp Paired End High output (HO) (320 Million reads) is recommended. Runs with 50 bp should also work. To reach more depth per cell, a single plate can also be sequenced on a NS550 HO, reaching 0.8 million reads per cell. Note that if the library is unique dual-indexed, a patterned flow cell sequencer such as NextSeq2000 and NovaSeq6000 can be used. It is always recommended to spike in PhiX to the sample before sequencing. PhiX is an adapter-ligated library used as a control for Illumina sequencing runs. It offers benefits for sequencing and alignment. We have used 1% as a final concentration of PhiX in our sequencing runs for the mRNA part.\nGenomic part\ngDNA purification and bisulfite conversion\nTiming: 4 h\nThrough these steps the gDNA will be purified and bisulfite-converted.

    "Measure the DNA concentration of the final pool with Qubit dsDNA HS™ Assay Kit as described before. Analyze the fragment distribution with Bioanalyzer.\nSequencing\nThe pool can be sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 1000–2000 sequencer (or any other patterned-flow cell sequencer: HiSeq X, HiSeq 3000/4000, NovaSeq 6000). For 96 cells per sequencing run, it is advisable to aim for 4–6 million reads per cell, in order to reach the minimum of 50.000 CpGs per cell. It should always be sequenced paired-end and with a read length of at least 75 bp. Note that the gDNA libraries can also be sequenced on non-patterned flow cell sequencers (NextSeq550), since the samples have UDI. However, we prefer to use patterned-flow cell sequencer, since the output of sequencing data is more cost-effective. We have used 15% as a final concentration of PhiX in our sequencing runs for the gDNA part. Note that this high concentration is due to the low diversity of bisulfite treated gDNA libraries.\nAlignment and quantification of transcriptomic data\nTiming: 4 h\nThrough these steps the transcriptomic data will be mapped to the reference genome. This allows the quantification of the gene expression profile of single cells.\nFollow the steps recommended by (Hagemann-Jensen et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) in the SmartSeq3 protocol. For convenience, we briefly recapitulate these methods.\nConvert Binary Base Call (BCL) files to FASTQ format with the bcl2fastq software provided by Illumina.\nbcl2fastq --use-bases-mask Y150N,I8,I8,Y150N --no-lane-splitting --create-fastq-for-index-reads -R /run_directory/\nwhere /run_directory/ is the directory containing the BCL files.\nInspect the quality of several FASTQ files with FASTQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/[href=https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/]).",
    "All FASTQ files may then be demultiplexed, mapped, and quantified with the software zUMIs (https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs[href=https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs]). To configure your zUMIs run, you will need to prepare a YAML file that denotes all parameters and paths (Hagemann-Jensen et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). provide the following template for a typical Smart-seq3 run:\nproject: Smartseq3\nsequence_files:\n  file1:\n    name: /smartseq3/fastq/Undetermined_S0_R1_001.fastq.gz\n    base_definition:\n      - cDNA(23-150)\n      - UMI(12-19)\n    find_pattern: ATTGCGCAATG\n  file2:\n    name: /smartseq3/fastq/Undetermined_S0_R2_001.fastq.gz\n    base_definition:\n      - cDNA(1-150)\n  file3:\n    name: /smartseq3/fastq/Undetermined_S0_I1_001.fastq.gz\n    base_definition:\n      - BC(1-8)\n  file4:\n    name: /smartseq3/fastq/Undetermined_S0_I2_001.fastq.gz\n    base_definition:\n      - BC(1-8)\nreference:\n  STAR_index: /resources/genomes/Mouse/STAR5idx_noGTF/\n  GTF_file: /resources/genomes/Mouse/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.91.gtf\n  additional_STAR_params: '--clip3pAdapterSeq CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT'\n  additional_files:\n      - /resources/genomes/spikes/ERCC92.fa\nout_dir: /smartseq3/zUMIs/\nnum_threads: 20\nmem_limit: 50\nfilter_cutoffs:\n  BC_filter:\n    num_bases: 3\n    phred: 20\nUMI_filter:\n    num_bases: 2\n    phred: 20\nbarcodes:\n    barcode_num: ∼\n    barcode_file: /smartseq3/expected_barcodes.txt\n    automatic: no\n    BarcodeBinning: 1\n    nReadsperCell: 100\n    demultiplex: no\ncounting_opts:\n    introns: yes\n    downsampling: '0'\n    strand: 0\n    Ham_Dist: 1\n    write_ham: no\n    velocyto: no\n    primaryHit: yes\n    twoPass: no\nmake_stats: yes\nwhich_Stage: Filtering\nsamtools_exec: samtools\npigz_exec: pigz\nSTAR_exec: STAR\nRscript_exec: Rscript\nAfter substituting the appropriate paths in this template, your zUMIs run may be started:\nzUMIs.sh –c -y Smartseq3_config.yaml\nAlignment and quantification of epigenomic data\nTiming: 3 days\nThrough these steps the epigenomic data will be mapped to the reference genome.

    "The total time will depend on the power of the computer cluster used for processing the data. On average we find that 3 days are enough to map 96 cells. This part of the protocol is based on recommendations described in the original scNMT-seq paper (Clark et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). We recommend Bismark (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/[href=https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/]) (10.1093/bioinformatics/btr167) for mapping and quantification of genomic reads, since Bismark can quantify both CpG-methylation and GpC-methylation. Since mapping of bisulfite-converted whole-genome reads is computationally expensive, you should consider performing this analysis on a large compute cluster or a similar system. The following steps are required for every cell, so it’s advisable to use a workflow manager like Snakemake or Nextflow to process multiple cells in parallel. It is not advisable to process FASTQ-files with extremely low read number (e.g., below 10.000 reads) since these cells will not pass later quality checks anyways, and they might cause crashes in later processing steps.\nFollow the steps recommended by Illumina to demultiplex your sequencing data and to convert them to FASTQ format.\nPrepare the genome for methylation-aware alignment with Bismark.
