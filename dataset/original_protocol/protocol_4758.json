    "Isolation of mouse aortaEuthanize mouse by CO2 as approved by the appropriate Animal Care and Use Committee.Place the mouse in supine position and fix arms and legs onto foam plate with needles.Spray 75% ethanol onto abdominal fur, and draw blood by cardiac puncture using 26G needle fixed to a 1 ml syringe. Cut skin, subcutaneous tissue, and open peritoneal cavity from abdomen to thorax along the middle line; fix skin/subcutaneous tissue onto a foam plate with needles.Open the mediastinum and cut off ribs.Puncture the right atrium using a 26G needle.Use a 5 ml syringe with a 26G needle attached, perfuse the remaining blood in the aorta from left ventricle with 5 ml 2 mM EDTA buffer, 10 ml PBS, and 10 ml FACS buffer, respectively. To avoid blood contamination, additional 3 perfusions using 5 ml FACS buffer each are needed during dissection steps. Following this, the aorta should be white.Remove intestine, spleen, liver, lung, and leave heart, kidneys, and aorta in situ.Under a dissecting microscope equipped with a cold light source (magnification, 2.5x), carefully dissect and remove adipose tissue that is located adjacent to the adventitia while leaving the aorta adventitia intact. At this step, there is no morphologically definable tissue identifier to distinguish adventitia and adjacent adipose tissue (Figure 1). However the adipose tissue is soft and can be removed easily; aorta adventitia is tight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602151033_2529.jpgFigure 1. Aorta anatomy in situ. Aorta was dissected from a 78-week old Apoe-/- mouse. Artery branches are indicated. Blue dashed line indicates position of diaphragm. The plaques in aorta segments are white indicated by asterisks. The adjacent adipose tissue is indicated by blue arrows.Carefully remove any lymph nodes that are close to the aorta (Figure 2). Lymph nodes are light brown.",
    "There are also some small lymph nodes in adjacent adipose tissue that are not visible with the naked eye requiring a dissection microscope for detection and removal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602151201_8455.jpgFigure 2. Lymph nodes adjacent to aorta. Two lumbar lymph nodes adjacent to the abdominal aorta adventitia are indicated by black arrows. There are also invisible small lymph nodes close to or within the paraaortic adipose tissue that line the entire paraaortic connective tissue.Main artery branches should be left untouched (0.5 cm long from their branching location): Innominate artery, left carotid artery, left subclavian artery, renal arteries, celiac artery, and the common iliac artery (Figure 1).  Harvest whole aorta and cut it at the level of diaphragm (Figure 1) into two segments: Abdominal aorta and thoracic aorta if analyses of individual aorta segments is needed. To study cells from the adventitia vs plaques, detachment of plaque (Figure 1) from the intima is needed: Open aorta longitudinally, fix it with needles, and place the intima side en face; carefully remove the plaque with a curved forceps. Plaque is white, easy to distinguish, and removed without effort.Keep aorta segments in ice-cold FACS buffer in 6-well plates until enzyme digestion.Enzyme digestion (Grabner et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2015)Enzyme cocktail: 400 U/ml collagenase type I, 120 U/ml collagenase type XI, 60 U/ml hyaluronidase and 60 U/ml DNase1, 20 mM HEPES in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) containing calcium. Transfer aorta from the 6-well plate to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 ml enzyme cocktail. Cut aorta tissue into small pieces using scissors.Transfer enzyme cocktail with aorta tissue to a 50 ml Falcon tube. Add additional 2 ml enzyme cocktail (2.5 ml enzyme cocktail for each thoracic and abdominal aorta total).",
    "Transfer tube containing aorta tissue pieces to a water bath for 50 min digestion at 37 °C with slow shaking.Prepare immune cell suspension from aortaAfter 50 min, pour the digestion solution onto a 100 µm cell strainer which is placed on the top of a new 50 ml Falcon tube. Mash remaining aorta tissue with syringe plunger and rinse cell strainer with 5 ml FACS buffer. Collect flowthrough from steps C1-2 and centrifuge at 300 x g, 4 °C for 10 min. Carefully remove supernatant after centrifugation, and resuspend cell pellet in 2 ml FACS buffer.Count aortic cells after mixing with trypan blue under a light microscope.Aorta cell staining and flow cytometryCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.To block Fc receptors, incubate cell pellet in 100 µl 1:100 diluted anti-CD16/32 mAb in FACS buffer (1 µg/ml final concentration) at 4 °C for 20 min.Fill the staining tube with 300 µl FACS buffer and centrifuge as step D1.Discard the supernatant and incubate the cell pellet with 100 µl 1:200 diluted anti-mouse CD45 mAb in FACS buffer (1 µg/ml final concentration) at 4 °C for 20 min. Fill the staining tube with 300 µl FACS buffer and centrifuge as in step D1.Resuspend the cell pellet with 200 µl FACS buffer and keep the sample on ice until FACS.To exclude dead cells, DAPI, PI or LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay dye, like Indo-1, is needed to stain with the cells before measurement."
