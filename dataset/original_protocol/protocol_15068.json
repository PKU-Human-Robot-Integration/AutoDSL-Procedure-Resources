    "1. Preparation of the Procedure Equipment, Solutions, and Experiment Setup\nEquipment:\n\tThe following equipment is required:\n\t\nDissecting instruments: scissors, scalpels, artery forceps, 6x artery clips.\n4x 12-14F catheters (for portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct and renal artery), 1x 12F catheter (ureter), suture material (20x Vicryl stitches and Vicryl ties), stitch scissors, 3x infusion sets, ice in large insulated transport container, gloves, a large sterile container for the blood collection.\n\t\tAt least three researchers are required to perform the organ retrieval.\nSolutions and/ or drugs\nTable 1 and the table of specific reagents and materials summarize all the required solutions and drugs required for the experiment.\nExtracorporeal circuit preparation\n\tSetup the circuit before the organ is harvested. The circuit is similar to those used for cardiopulmonary extracorporeal bypass surgery. It consists of nontraumatic centrifugal pump that provides the hepatic/renal arterial blood flow and pressure readings, an oxygenator, a heat exchanger unit and a venous reservoir to stimulate the venous flow and pressures. After passage through the liver and kidney, the venous blood is collected from both the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) and renal vein into a container simulating the systemic venous reservoir and returned to the centrifugal pump (Figure 1).\n\t\nRemove the circuit from the packaging ensuring its sterility. The circuit consists of two reservoirs; one supplying the pseudo portal circulation and one supplying the pseudo systemic circulation as per Figure 1.\nConnect the drainage lines from the IVC and renal vein to the systemic reservoir.\nConnect the systemic reservoir to the pump and then the oxygenator.\nThere are 3 lines exiting the oxygenator. Connect one to each of the following: the hepatic artery, renal artery, and the reservoir supplying the hepatic portal vein. Connect this reservoir to the hepatic portal vein.",
    "2. Harvesting the Porcine Kidney and Liver and Washing the Organs with Preservation Solution\nAnimals used in this study received human care and study protocols were in accordance with the United Kingdom laws. They were euthanized with final exsanguinations during the blood-harvesting procedure according to United Kingdom regulations.\nCollect the autologous blood into a preheparinized nonpyogenic container with 25,000 units of Heparin.\nImmediately following the laparotomy and sternotomy incision, shift all bowel loops to the right side, open the left retroperitoneal space and free up the left kidney from its attachments\nIdentify the renal artery and vein then resect them at their origin from the aorta and IVC.\nIdentify the ureter and cut approximately 10-15 cm distal to origin.\n\tOne team member should take the kidney to a backbench table and place it in a kidney dish prefilled with ice and preservation solution (50:50).\nCannulate the renal artery as soon as possible and start an infusion of 500 ml (4 °C) preservation solution. Take all precautions to avoid any kink in the ureter as this will lead to hydronephrosis. On completion of the preservation infusion solution, place the kidney in a bag filled with preservation solution and store on ice, in an insulated container for transport to the laboratory.\nIdentify both the gastrocolic and treitz ligament and divide them; the Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) is found close to treitz ligament.\nCannulate the SMV to reach the portal vein and fix with a 0 Vicryl tie. Ligate the splenic vein (SV), and infuse cold 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution through the portal vein to remove any residual blood clots.",
    "Identify the third part of the duodenum, ligate and then divided it. Mobilize the stomach, identify and resect the infra-hepatic IVC at any level. Identify the suprahepatic IVC and divide it along with the aorta and esophagus. Detach the aorta from the vertebral column attachments up to the level of the renal vessels and divide it at this level. Dissect any nonvascular attachments allowing the liver, stomach, second part of duodenum, pancreas, and spleen to be removed en-bloc, and then move the specimen on to a tray filled with ice on a separate bench table.\nStart an infusion of approximately 1.5 L of the cold preservation solution (4 °C) through the portal vein.\nIdentify and cannulate the hepatic artery. Secure the cannula with a Vicryl tie and commence an infusion of 1 L of cold (4 °C) preservation solution.\n\tAll of the above steps should be completed as fast as possible to minimize the warm ischemic injury time to the organs.\nMobilize the spleen and divide the gastrosplenic ligament, ligate the right gastric artery and then discard the spleen and stomach.\nFinally, carefully dissect the pancreas from the splenic artery and free the pancreatic branches of the hepatic artery and ligate them, then identify the common bile duct and cut it long.\nThoroughly flush the retrieved liver to remove all blood clots, transfer the liver into a bag containing cold preservation solution and then place it inside an ice box for transport to the laboratory.\n3. Priming the Circuit",
    "Add approximately 1.5-2.5 L of the heparinized autologous porcine blood to the systemic venous reservoir of the circuit during the backbench preparation. This blood is the perfusate for the ex vivo liver and kidney experiment. Start the centrifugal pump and allow the perfusate to run through the intra-luminal and extra-luminal compartments and fill in all circuit lines as well as the hollow fiber filter\nAdd the following to the above perfusate: 40 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, 20 ml of epoprostenol sodium (500 μg in 50 ml of diluent, diluted with 200 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride), 750 mg of cefuroxime sodium in 10 ml water, 10 mmol in 10 ml calcium chloride 14.7%, and 50 units of insulin actrapid.\nPrime the centrifugal pump with perfusate under the effect of gravity. Manually tap the circuit to remove any air bubbles toward the venous reservoir.\nStart the centrifugal pump at a pump speed of 1,200 rpm to prime the remaining part of the circuit with perfusate.\nSupply the oxygen (mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) to the oxygenator at a rate of 2 L/min and connect the oxygenator to the water bath/ heat exchanger preset at temperature of 38 °C (the physiologic temperature of pig).\nZero the pressure measuring device on the centrifugal pump to air (to zero the flow, both the inlet and outlet into the flow transducer should be fully clamped).\nOnce the perfusion has started maintain a continuous infusion of epoprostenol sodium 20 ml/hr and sodium taurocholate at 10 ml/hr (10 units/ml).\nAdminister boluses of 40 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 50 units of insulin actrapid to maintain physiological parameters of glucose and acid base balance.",
    "If the metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia are not corrected with boluses after the first hour, administer sodium bicarbonate 8.4% as an infusion at a rate of 40 ml/hr and titrate it according to the ABG and 100 units/hr Insulin.\n\tThese continuous infusions need to be started to mimic the normal physiologic conditions and to maintain the pH within the physiologic range after reperfusion, ameliorating the acidotic changes derived from the ischemic reperfusion injury.\n4. Backbench Preparation of Liver and Kidney for the Perfusion\nIdentify both the ureter and the common bile duct, cannulate and secure them.\nInfuse 1 L of 0.9% sodium chloride solution through the portal vein, 500 ml through the hepatic artery and 500 ml through the renal artery to remove any blood clots from the organs and the cannulas and to flush out the preservation solution.\nIdentify any leaks from the vascular branches (as these will bleed during the perfusion) and ligate them with 2/0 Vicryl tie or stitches.\n5. Ex vivo Liver-kidney Perfusion\nOnce all the lines are primed and the perfusate is optimized, collect a baseline blood sample for full blood count, biochemical and blood gas analysis before connecting the first organ. Take a tissue biopsy if performing histological examination.\nTransfer the retrieved kidney into the allocated nonpyogenic perfusion chamber; connect the renal artery catheter to the respective line of the extracorporeal circuit and the catheterized ureter into an hourly urometer for urine output monitoring.\nAdjust the perfusion pressure of the kidney and maintain the renal arterial pressure between 80-90 mmHg.\nTransfer the liver into the allocated perfusion chamber, and immediately connect the hepatic artery and portal vein to their respective lines of the extracorporeal circuit. Allow the cannulated bile duct to drain freely into an allocated bile bag for monitoring.",
    "Adjust the perfusion pressure and maintain the hepatic artery pressure between 80-100 mmHg and the portal vein pressure at <10 mmHg.\n\tThe resistance in the portal venous system is low compared to the arterial channels, therefore, apply a clamp on the inlet tubing of the portal reservoir to control the inflow into the portal reservoir and maintain physiological pressures in the hepatic artery and portal vein. Tightening the clamp will decrease the inflow into the portal reservoir and increase the flow and pressure into the arterial lines, and vice versa.\nTo maintain the perfusion within physiological values of the arterial and venous flows and pressure, alter both the pump speed and change the inflow resistance of the reservoir aiming for a hepatic and renal artery flow of between 0.2-0.3 L/min and the portal vein flow above 1 L/min.\nCollect blood samples hourly for hematological, biochemical and blood gas analysis and correct any electrolyte, glycemic and metabolic changes using the relevant solution (Table 1). Collect the last blood sample after 6 hr of perfusion and discard the organs according to your local policies.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
