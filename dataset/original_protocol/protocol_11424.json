    "STS cells are isolated from a tumor mass surgically excised from patients with STS. The protocol has been approved by the Local Ethics Committee and is performed according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent to take part in the study. The surgical specimens are analyzed by an experienced sarcoma pathologist and processed within 3 hours of surgery.\n1. Tumor Specimen Collection and Processing:\nCollect tumor specimens with the help of a sarcoma pathologist in a 100-mL sterile urine container with 50 mL of DMEM low glucose medium sealed with a paraffin film.\nStore the samples at 4 °C for a maximum of 3 h after tumor resection.\nPerform all the following steps under a sterile tissue culture hood.\n\t\nSterilize the hood with 70% ethanol and wear sterile gloves.\nSterilize steel inox tweezers with 70% ethanol (use a sterile gauze).\nRemove the paraffin film from the urine container and discard.\nWash exterior of the urine container with 70% ethanol.\nOpen a square petri dish.\nOpen the urine container and transfer the tumor specimens into the square petri dish using the sterilized steel inox tweezers.\nWash the tumor specimens with PBS twice.\nOpen a sterile surgical scalpel.\n\t\nFinely shred the tumor specimens into 1 - 2 mm3 pieces.\nCollect one quarter of the total sample in a 2-mL tube.\nAdd 1 mL of trizol reagent (purchased) to the tube and immediately freeze at -80 °C (the sample will be used in the downstream analysis for the STS gene expression evaluation).\nCollect the rest of the finely shredded tumor material in a 15-mL tube.\n\t\nAdd 4 mL of collagenase type I solution (collagenase type I is dissolved in PBS, at a concentration of 4 µg/mL).",
    "Dilute the collagenase type I solution with 4 mL of DMEM high culture media (final concentration of collagenase type I is 2 µg/mL).\nClose the 15-mL tube and seal with paraffin film.\nPut the 15-mL tube in a rolling shaker in an incubator at 37 °C in stirring conditions for 15 min to activate the digestion.\nAfter 15 min store the tube in the rolling shaker under stirring conditions at room temperature overnight.\nThe following day put the 15-mL tube under the sterile hood.\nGently filter the cell suspension through a 100 µm sterile filter attached to the top of a 50-mL tube.\nWash the filter with DMEM high culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nDiscard the 100 µm sterile filter, close the 50-mL tube and centrifuge at 225 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant by inverting the tube.\nRe-suspend the cells with 1 - 2 mL DMEM high culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nNote: The volume depends on the amount of tumor sample processed.\nCount the cells with a Neubauer chamber.\n\t\nDilute the sample 1:2 in trypan blue and use 10 µL of the dilution to count cells.\nCount at least twice and calculate the mean of the replicates to know the total mean number of cells collected.\nPlate cells in a standard monolayer culture at a density of 80,000 cells/cm2.\nNote: Always include controls in experiments. Perform at least 3 technical replicates for each condition. Perform at least 2 biological replicates. For preclinical pharmacology, gene expression and protein expression analyses, experiments should be carried out with a low number of culture passages within 30 - 45 days of cell seeding to avoid losing cancer cell phenotypes.",
    "Cytological sample preparation.\n\t\nCollect 100,000 cells in 200 µL of DMEM high culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nPipette the solution (200 µL pipette) into a disposable funnel equipped with a filter and mounted with a glass slide.\nOpen the cytocentrifuge and insert the samples.\nRun the cytocentrifuge at 18.6 x g for 20 min.\nDiscard the funnel equipped with the filter.\nFix the slides in acetone for 10 min followed by chloroform for 5 min.\nStore the slides at -20 °C.\nNote: Thaw and hydrate the samples before staining and perform the staining following the manufacturer's instructions. Prepare at least 3 technical replicates.\n2. STS Cell Cultures:\nChange media once a week (DMEM high culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin).\n\t\nDiscard the culture medium using a 200 - 1,000 µL pipette.\nAdd new fresh medium using a 200 - 1,000 µL pipette.\nCell passage:\n\t\t\nDetach cells when the confluence is around 90%:\nNote: STS cell culture amplification should be performed once a week on the basis of the culture conditions.\nDiscard medium, wash with PBS and add 2-3 mL of trypsin 1x in PBS\nNote: The volume of trypsin used depends on the amount of cultured cells obtained.\nIncubate cells for 3 - 5 min at 37 °C.\nCollect detached cells from the plate using a 200 - 1,000 µL pipette.\nPipette the detached cells into a 15-mL tube and add 4 mL of DMEM high culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to stop the enzymatic reaction.\nCentrifuge at 225 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant.",
    "Re-suspend the cell pellet by adding 1 mL of DMEM high culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nSeed the cells in a new culture plate or a flask with a final volume according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nNote: Do not split cells more than 1:3.\n3. Downstream Analyses:\nNote: A variety of different experiments can be carried out using this model (see below). It is, therefore, crucial to decide during the design phase of the study which analyses will be performed so that an adequate number of samples and replicates can be prepared.\nProliferation assays such as MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide\nApoptotic assays such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nGene expression analysis\nWestern blot analysis\nELISA assay\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis\nIn vivo xenograft model\nSubscription Required.
