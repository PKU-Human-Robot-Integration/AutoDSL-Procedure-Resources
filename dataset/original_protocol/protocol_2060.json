    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of splenocyte single-cell suspension\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSingle-cell suspensions of splenocytes are isolated for evaluation and downstream RNA expression analysis using the targeted enrichment strategy. After this step, splenocytes will be isolated from mouse spleen, counted and viability-verified, and prepared to undergo selective antibody labeling and magnetic separation.\nEuthanize three female CFW mice, 8–12 weeks old, via CO2 asphyxiation followed by secondary cervical dislocation.\nCritical: This protocol was optimized for using 3 mouse spleens pooled in the single-cell suspension step. If fewer than 3 spleens are used, we recommend optimizing and validating the procedures. If using more than 3 spleens, we recommend doing them in groups of 3 pooled spleens, as this allows the user to adhere to all the specifics (i.e., volumes and dilution factors) presented in this protocol.\nCritical: Unless the technician is skilled and quick at dissecting spleens, we recommend sacrificing one mouse at a time. This should help prevent any transcriptional drift due to post-mortem processes.\nNote: The use of three spleens allows the user to capture the heterogeneity of biological replicates without expanding sequencing. Fortunately, 10× Genomics has updated chemistry kit versions that allow multiplexing biological replicates within the same sample prep.\nMake an incision in the abdominal cavity and remove spleen (located to the left side of the abdomen, inferior to the stomach).\nImmediately extract the three spleens, placing them all in a single 50 mL tube of SES on ice, as previously prepared (before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], Prepare Solutions and Buffers).\nTo obtain a single-cell suspension, cut spleens into small pieces with sterile scissors in a 6-well plate on ice in a sterile environment.",
    "Alternatives: Petri dishes or other alternatives can be used to dice the spleen. However, a 6-well plate provides an optimal area and volume to efficiently cut the spleen while ensuring that the entirety of each spleen is incorporated into the dissociation.\nPlace a 70 μm MACS® SmartStrainer on top of a 50 mL LoBind tube on ice and pre-wet the cell strainer with 5 mL of cold SES. Discard the flow-through.\nPlace minced pieces of spleens in the 70 μm cell strainer and gently dissociate by moving the rubber plunger of a 10- or 20-mL sterile syringe in a circular motion with exceptionally light pressure. It is vital to add ice-cold SES continuously as the dissociation is performed. The total SES added during this step should range between 40 and 45 mL. This equates to roughly 2.5–3 mL of SES added per minute during the dissociation.\nCritical: Constant addition of cold SES to the minced spleen, strainer, and plunger ensures that dissociated cells flow through the strainer and do not require extreme pressure to force them through. This also prevents cells from getting stuck or deprived of liquid. There should be little pressure applied to the spleen. This process should take roughly 10–15 min to gently dissociate all 3 spleens through the cell strainer.\nUsing approximately 5 mL of SES, wash all excess cells off the plunger into the strainer and ensure all cells have been thoroughly washed from the strainer, passing through to the 50 mL LoBind flow-through tube on ice, that now contains the 3 dissociated spleens creating a single-cell suspension that is 45–50 mL in total.",
    "Centrifuge the resulting single-cell suspension at 4°C for 8 min at 300 × g. Aspirate the supernatant, being careful to avoid any disturbance of the cell pellet, and place the tube containing the cell pellet on ice.\nLyse red blood cells (RBCs) with 3 mL of Sigma Hybri-Max Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer (1 mL/spleen).\nStart a timer precisely when the gentle pipetting begins to lift and resuspend the pellet in the 3 mL of RBC lysis buffer. Pipetting is done with the tube in ice but angled so the user can visualize their pipetting.\nKeep pipetting to a minimum, with intermittent swirling. Only take the suspension out of ice when swirling and ensure placement on ice in between swirls.\nCritical: To ensure reproducibility in experimental replicates, we use a 1,000 μL wide-bore pipette tip and quickly pipette 3 volumes of 1,000 μL of RBC lysis buffer down the side of the tube containing the cell pellet on ice. The RBC lysis must proceed for precisely 45 s. This minimizes stress to the other cell populations, results in high viability, minimizes cell aggregates, and enhances reproducibility amongst experimental replicates (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nCritical: Although we minimize the time cells are exposed to RBC lysis buffer, cells can still experience stress. To reduce any further stress to the cells, it is critical that the user conducts gentle and controlled pipetting to minimize the lysis of cells yet produce a homogenous solution. White fibrotic aggregates may form due to the lysed RBCs, but these are removed in steps #11–13 by passing the solution through cell strainers, so there is no need to attempt to dissociate these cell debris aggregates.",
    "After 45 s, pour 45–50 mL of cold SES (15 mL/spleen) down the side of the tube while gently swirling to neutralize the RBC lysis buffer, stopping the RBC lysis reaction. Immediately place on ice and gently pipette to dissociate any aggregates.\nNote: A more concentrated salt solution, such as 10× HBSS without phenol red, Ca2+, and Mg2+, can be used to minimize the total volume of the neutralized suspension (Son et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). This may reduce cell loss in the subsequent centrifugation (step #14).\nStack strainers, 70 μm on top of 30 μm, and place on top of new 50 mL LoBind tube on ice.\nPre-wet the strainer stack with roughly 5 mL of SES and discard the flow-through. Use the same tube in the next step.\nNote: Using the same tube serves to coat the tube with proteins to retain cells.\nGently pour cells slowly into the strainer stack, and single cells flow through into the 50 mL LoBind tube. The strainer stack is then discarded, and the tube cap is re-placed on the 50 mL LoBind tube.\nCentrifuge at 4°C for 8 min at 300 × g with the brake/deceleration reduced by 30% with respect to the highest setting. The acceleration does not need to be altered from the highest setting.\nDuring this centrifuge, prepare tubes for steps #16, #17, and #18.\nFor step #16, add the 27 mL of cold SES into a 50 mL LoBind tube on ice and label as 1:10 splenocytes.\nFor step #17, add the 18 mL of cold SES into a 50 mL LoBind tube on ice and label as 1:100 splenocytes.\nFor step #18, to two 2.0 mL LoBind tubes, add 200 μL of 0.4% Trypan Blue solution per tube.",
    "Note: Preparing these tubes during the centrifuge step avoids unnecessary time lapses that could affect downstream analyses (i.e., by preserving the cells' transcriptomes for scRNA-seq).\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend in 4.0 mL of cold SES (1.33 mL/spleen).\nNote: For accuracy, use a pipette to deliver 4.0 mL as opposed to a serological pipet.\nMake a 1:10 splenocyte dilution of splenocytes by diluting 3.0 mL of undiluted cell suspension into 27 mL of cold SES (from step #14-a-i) for a total of 30 mL of 1:10 diluted splenocytes. Place on ice.\nCreate a 1:100 dilution of cells by adding 2.0 mL of the 1:10 splenocytes dilution into 18 mL of SES (from step #14-a-ii) to create a total of 20 mL of 1:100 diluted splenocytes. Place back on ice.\nAdd 200 μL of the 1:100 splenocytes dilution into each of the 2 mL LoBind tubes pre-aliquoted with 200 μL of trypan blue (from step #14-a-iii), generating a 1:1 mixture of trypan to cell suspension ratio.\nNote: The dilution factor of 2 must be considered when calculating cell concentrations (if prepared as described in this protocol).\nLoad 10 μL of the 1:1 mixture of trypan:cells to each chamber of a hemocytometer and count viable and total cells. Calculate and record the concentrations and viability of the undiluted, 1:10, and 1:100 splenocyte dilution samples. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Calculating the total number of cells per sample for the undiluted cell concentration and viability is essential for experimental reproducibility and applicability (Expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nAlternatives: An automated cell counter can be used in place of a hemocytometer. This would be preferred as it is more efficient, allowing users to quickly proceed with the next step.",
    "Save the 1:10 and 1:100 splenocyte dilutions created above for downstream flow cytometry and spiking splenocytes back into the enriched cell population. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlace the 1:100 splenocyte dilutions in a 4°C fridge, tilted on their side on an orbital rotator, rotating at 30 RPM.\nKeep the 1:10 splenocyte dilution on ice and use it for the next step (step #21).\nCritical: If the splenocytes are neither diluted nor shaken gently, the viability drastically decreases over time. The dilutions and gentle shaking minimize cell clumping and settling, which can result in aggregation and cell death. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nUsing the 1:10 diluted splenocytes, add 400 × 106 cells to a 15 mL LoBind tube, centrifuge at 4°C for 5 min at 300 × g, then aspirate (leaving roughly 30 μL supernatant) and bring up to a final volume of 2.4 mL with ER buffer. Gently mix and promptly place the tube back in ice.\nProceed immediately with the MACS Immunomagnetic Enrichment of Untouched Target Cells method.\nCritical: This cell suspension must proceed to cell isolation immediately as cell aggregates can form when left stationary too long on ice. This may result in decreased enriched cell recovery, purity, and viability.\nMACS immunomagnetic enrichment of untouched target cells\nTiming: 1.5–2.5 h",
    "Unwanted cell populations are removed by targeting antigens specific to the unwanted cells with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies, followed by immunomagnetic beads which bind to the fluorophore. These undesired cells will be retained in the immunomagnetic column while the desired cell population(s) will be enriched in flow-through. There are considered “untouched” as the antibodies used for targeting exclusively bound the unwanted population, leaving the flow-through cell populations “untouched” by antibodies. At the conclusion of this step, enriched “untouched” cell populations will be purified and ready for evaluation (i.e., via flow cytometry) and RNA capture (i.e., scRNA-seq).\nAdd the previously prepared 570 μL of PE-Conjugated Antibody Depletion Cocktail (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) directly to the cell suspension prepared in step #21 and mix gently by pipetting.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1652_6.csv\nAbbreviations: NK, Natural Killer; PE, Phycoerythrin; RBC, red blood cell. Antibody cocktail targets cell-specific antigens for cell populations that are over-represented (i.e., T & B cells). All cell-specific antigen-targeting antibodies are conjugated to a PE fluorophore which serves as the antigen for the anti-PE magnetic microbeads (step #28). This allows for negative depletion for enriched and untouched rarer granulocytic and myeloid cells for downstream scRNA-seq analysis.\naFinal dilution was calculated from a final total volume of 3.0 mL, as roughly 30 μL of supernatant is left after the spin down to avoid disturbance of the pellet. The 3.0 mL final total volume breakdown is 0.030 mL (leftover from aspiration) + 2.4 mL ER buff (resuspension step #21) + Enrichment Antibody Cocktail #1 (0.570 mL or 570 μL). The desired final dilutions are initially based on the estimated total nucleated cell number and then adjusted for the volume.\nIncubate for 10 min in a light-protected 4°C fridge, with the tube slightly slanted on an orbital rotator, rotating at 30 RPM.",
    "Critical: Miltenyi Biotec states that incubating on ice requires a longer incubation time; it is highly recommended to incubate for 10 min in a refrigerator that maintains 2°C–8°C (Miltenyi cell surface staining protocol[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/applications/all-protocols/cell-surface-flow-cytometry-staining-protocol-pbs-edta-bsa-1-50.html]).\nCritical: Although this incubation includes PE-conjugated antibodies, it is not essential to do this incubation step protected from light (i.e., in a dark 4°C fridge), as the PE-conjugated antibodies serve as the ligand of the immunomagnetic anti-PE microbeads which deplete the undesired cell populations. However, analyzing the unstained enriched sample using flow cytometry can provide detection of PE-labeled cells that were not retained, a likely indication that more anti-PE microbeads are needed in the microbead cocktail to deplete these populations efficiently. The PE-conjugated fluorophores used in this protocol have been extensively tested. Miltenyi’s PE-conjugated antibodies’ exposure time to light from this depletion procedure is minimal when considering Miltenyi’s extended validation of these recombinant antibody-PE-fluorophore conjugates. Refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAfter the 10-min incubation, add 12 mL of ER buffer directly to the antibody-cell mixture.\nThis step serves to significantly pre-dilute and washes off unbound and loosely bound antibodies.\nNote: Due to the time-sensitive nature of scRNA-seq, the direct addition of ER buffer serves as a sufficient wash to proceed without an additional wash and centrifugation step, thus saving time and cell loss.\nCentrifuge the sample at 300 × g, 8 min, 4°C. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend cells in 3.2 mL ER buffer (80 μL ER buffer/10 × 106 cells).\nAdd 500 μL of anti-PE UltraPure microbeads (12.5 μL anti-PE beads/10 × 106 cells) and 400 μL anti-CD19 microbeads (10 μL anti-CD19 microbeads/10 × 106 cells) to the cell suspension (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). Mix gently with minimal pipetting, followed by swirling.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1652_7.csv",
    "Abbreviations: PE, Phycoerythrin. This cocktail is added to the cells from step #27 to deplete the more dominating cell types that constitute the spleen.\naFinal dilutions are calculated as used in the protocol (steps #27 and #28). These dilutions were optimized based on the specific input of 400 × 106 cells in a volume of 3.2 mL ER Buffer, which upon addition of the bead cocktail yields a total volume of 4.1 mL.\nIncubate 15 min at 4°C in the fridge, with the tube slightly slanted on an orbital rotator, rotating at 30 RPM.\nDuring this incubation, proceed to steps #33 (assembly of QuadroMACS unit), #34, and #35, as it takes a while to pre-wash the LD columns via gravity flow.\nAfter the 15-min incubation, add 12 mL of ER buffer directly to the antibody-cell mixture. This serves to significantly pre-dilute and washes off any unbound or loosely bound microbeads.\nNote: Due to the time-sensitive nature of scRNA-seq, the direct addition of ER buffer serves as a sufficient wash to proceed without an additional wash and centrifugation step. Thus, saving time and reducing cell loss.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g, 8 min, at 4°C. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.\nNote: To minimize transcriptional drift, we do not wash the cells twice following step #30. We have not noticed any significant differences in washing twice.\nResuspend cells in 4.0 mL of ER buffer (500 μL ER buffer/100 × 106 cells).",
    "Proceed to magnetic separation using the previously assembled 8 LD columns secured in two QuadroMACS magnetic stand units (4 LD columns per QuadroMACS unit). Ensure that all 15 mL collection tubes are in ice and secured, as these will be retrieving the flow-through that contains the enriched target cell population. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] shows an illustration of this setup.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1652-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of the MACS stands experimental setup for immunomagnetic cell enrichment procedure\nPre-wet the 30 μm pre-separation filters (on top LD columns) with 2 mL of ER buffer per column (8 columns) and allow this solution to flow-through (exit) via gravity flow the filter before any cell suspension is added. Discard this pre-wetting solution from the collection tubes (8 columns).\nUse these same tubes for the next step (step #35).\nCritical: ER buffer has a 2% BSA concentration that serves to precoat collection tubes with BSA, which has been proven to increase the recovery and viability of cells (Phi-Wilson and Recktenwald, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21], US Patent ID: US523828A).\nRe-place the same 15 mL LoBind tubes used in step #34, positioned below each LD column.\nSlowly pipette 500 μL of cell suspension into the Miltenyi 30 μm pre-separation filters atop the LD column and allow the cell suspension to flow through via gravity. The flow-through contains the enriched cell population.\nCritical: Each LD column comes pre-packaged with a plunger. Do not plunge the cell suspension to speed up the immunomagnetic separation, resulting in the undesired microbead labeled cells being forced through the column and contaminating the targeted enriched population. Additionally, it will subject all the cells to substantial shear forces and result in high debris, low viability, and poor candidates for scRNA-seq. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Do not proceed to step #37 until all volume has exited the column.",
    "Wash pre-separation filter and column twice, with 1 mL of ER buffer per wash.\nCritical: Only add additional buffer (the second wash in step #37) when the column reservoir is completely emptied of buffer.\nNote: This step serves to retrieve any remaining enriched target cells that may have been retained in the column.\nThese resulting flow-throughs in the 15 mL LoBind tubes contain the untouched, “enriched” cell populations. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCombine the 8 enriched 15 mL collection tubes into 2 of the 15 mL LoBind tubes by pipetting each of 3 tubes into the 4th collection tubes.\nCentrifuge both tubes 300 × g, 8 min, at 4°C. Aspirate the ER buffer while leaving approximately 50 μL in both tubes to minimize cell loss. Place both tubes on ice.\nTake one of the two tubes and resuspend the cell pellet with 400 μL of 10×-Sequencing Buffer (10×-SB) using a wide-bore tip and careful pipetting to preserve cell viability. Once resuspended, transfer this cell suspension (volume approximately 450 μL) into the second tube and use the volume to resuspend the second tube’s cell pellet.\nCritical: At this step (step #41) in the workflow, the cell suspension buffer is transitioned from ER buffer to 10×-SB to remove EDTA and reduce BSA for compatibility with the Chromium instrument and library prep chemistry (see Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry]).\nNote: The resuspension process described here is designed to maximize cell recovery and the concentration (cells/mL) of enriched cells, which can be limiting. Additionally, the cell concentration must be carefully chosen for capturing the desired number of cells with single-cell sequencing.",
    "Immediately begin counting cells and assessing viability for the enriched fraction using a 1:1 dilution of cells to trypan blue solution. Load the 1:1 suspension in a hemocytometer and count as previously mentioned (step #19). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSpiking: Repopulation of depleted cells for broadened transcriptomics\nTiming: 20 min\nThe spiking procedure is used to repopulate the more abundant spleen cells that were deliberately depleted during the magnetic cell enrichment procedure. Spiking with the untouched splenocytes allows the reintroduction of abundant spleen cell types that were minimally perturbed, a crucial factor for the sensitivity of scRNA-seq.\nTo partially repopulate the highly abundant spleen cells depleted during the enrichment (e.g., T and B Lymphocytes), use the 1:10 and/or 1:100 untouched splenocytes previously prepared (steps #14–19). Create the “Spiked” sample so that its final total cell composition consists of 33% cells from the untouched splenocytes and 67% of cells from the enriched cell fraction. Volumes will vary based on cell counts and concentrations of the 1:10 and 1:100 splenoctyes (see steps #19 and #20).\nFor the intended Spiked sample to undergo scRNA-seq, aliquot a desired number of cells for the user(s) target sequencing depth (see Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry]), and centrifuge at 300 × g, 8 min, at 4°C.\nAspirate and add a volume of 10×-SB to obtain a Spiked sample with 800-1,200 Spiked cells/μL (recommended concentrations from the 10× Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry]).\nCritical: An aliquot of the Spiked sample intended for 10× scRNA-seq must be spun down and replaced with 10×-SB to remove EDTA and reduce BSA for compatibility with the Chromium instrument and library prep chemistry (see Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry]).",
    "Note: At this stage in the workflow, the user has generated untouched splenocytes, an enriched fraction, and a spiked fraction.\nThe Spiked sample (prepared in stepa #43a and b) should be processed immediately for scRNA-seq using the 10× Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry] User Guide.\nIt is beyond the scope of this protocol, but ensure that the concentration of cells for sequencing, sequencing depth, and other parameters are followed in accordance with the 10× Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/index/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry] User Guide.\nThe Spiked sample should also be analyzed in the Flow Cytometry Staining procedure to ensure the user(s) repopulated prevalent spleen cell types depleted in the enrichment.\nCritical: The sample should be processed immediately to preserve the transcriptome. It is best if one user begins the 10× Genomics sample preparation and the other user(s) proceed to the flow cytometry procedure.\nNote: Fundamentally, this protocol is designed to produce unperturbed and highly viable cells. These could be utilized for various downstream applications, including but not limited to scRNA-seq (i.e., ex vivo functional assays, proteomic analyses, mechanistic drug studies, etc.).\nFlow cytometry staining\nTiming: 3–4 h\nFlow cytometry can be used as a quality control tool to give insight into the enrichment strategy’s success, failure, or anomalies. This is especially useful for scRNA-seq, as it allows one to assess if costly downstream NGS should be pursued based on the users’ expected target cell populations.\nAliquot 1 × 106 cells into 1.5 mL LoBind tubes for all samples, including controls. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: 2.0 mL LoBind tubes can be used in place of 1.5 mL LoBind tubes. This usually comes down to the user preference when viewing/protecting the cell pellet during aspiration steps.\nCentrifuge samples at 4°C and 300 × g, for 10 min.",
    "During this centrifuge, prepare 1× Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye per the manufacturer’s instructions.\nFor every 1 μL of 100× stock Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye, add 100 μL of PBS.\nCritical: Per Miltenyi’s manufacturer instructions, Viobility Fixable Dye[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0014900.PDF] is not compatible with BSA during the Viobility Dye Incubation. Therefore, only PBS must be used to dilute the 100× stock to a working 1× Viobility Fixable Dye concentration.\nResuspend each sample in the designated volume of freshly prepared 1× Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye, according to the sample type:\nStained samples: 88 μL of 1× Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye.\nFMOs: 90 μL of 1× Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye.\nFM4 (FMO for the 4 PE-antibodies): 96 μL of 1× Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye.\nIn the dark, mix well and incubate in 1× Viobility™ 405/520 Fixable Dye for 5 min at room temperature (18°C–23°C).\nAdd the previously prepared Flow Cytometry Enriched Antibody Cocktails (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step #2) directly to their respective samples as described below and incubate in the dark for 10 min at room temperature (18°C–23°C).\nStained samples: Add 22 μL of Enriched Flow Antibody Cocktail.\nFMOs: add 20 μL of each FMO cocktail to one cell sample (one sample per FMO cocktail).\nFM4 (fluorescence minus four control for all four PE-conjugated antibodies): add 14 μL of FM4 panel.\nCritical: In this protocol, follow Miltenyi’s manufacturer instructions, “Staining with Viobility™ Fixable Dye and staining surface markers simultaneously[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0014900.PDF],” section 2.4. By following these instructions, the final total volume of Viobility Fixable Dye plus the volume of the antibody cocktail in a sample should always equal 110 μL.",
    "Note: We do not use isotype fluorophore-conjugated controls due to Miltenyi Biotec’s extended validations, which show their REA recombinant antibodies have negligible non-specific binding to the commonly problematic FcgRI (CD65), FcgRIII (CD16), and FcgRII (CD32). Please refer to Miltenyi’s scientific poster, “Recombinant antibodies for improved standardization in flow cytometry[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/_Resources/Persistent/c95f8c36ccfc3b9bafb89f24284c4a6cc0c8013f/Recombinant%20antibodies%20for%20improved%20standardization%20in%20flow%20cytometry.pdf],” for more information. Due to the high cost of using isotype controls given the extended validation of the recombinant REA antibodies, it is practical to proceed without, although we still encourage isotype fluorophore-conjugated antibodies in flow cytometry.\nAdd PEB to bring the volume up to 1,000 μL.\nNote: This dilution serves as a pre-wash, diluting the loosely labeled or unbound antibodies to maximize cell recovery by side-stepping additional centrifugation and wash steps.\nCentrifuge at 4°C and 300 × g, for 8 min. Aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 150 μL of cold PBS and resuspend cells gently.\nCritical: It is essential to resuspend the cells completely in this step. There should be no aggregates resulting in a homogenous cell suspension. Failure to do so can result in cells getting fixed as aggregates in the next step, step #53, which will negatively impact the flow cytometry results and interpretations.\nAdd 150 μL of 4% PFA in PBS to the samples to obtain a final 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) concentration and gently mix. Allow samples to be fixed by incubating them in a 2°C–8°C fridge for 20 min, protected from light.\nCritical: Using an aqueous 4% PFA solution, rather than the 4% PFA in PBS solution (used here), could impact cell viability as it results in a decreased salt concentration that keeps the 1× PBS isotonic to cells. An aqueous PFA solution could result in a hypotonic solution that can cause cell swelling and cytolysis.",
    "Note: PFA fixation incubations can be performed at room temperature (18°C–23°C), in a fridge (2°C–8°C), or on ice. Room temperature (18°C–23°C) incubations require less time for fixation, and incubations on ice require slightly increased fixation times.\nPre-dilute the 2% PFA concentration in the samples by directly adding 600 μL of PEB to the sample.\nCritical: PEB buffer is used here as the 2% BSA in this buffer improves cell recovery. There will be a significant decrease in the recovery of cells if PBS is used in place of PEB buffer in this step.\nNote: By directly diluting the 2% PFA containing sample, this step serves as a pre-washing step and reduces the number of wash-centrifuge cycles to one.\nCentrifuge samples at 4°C, 700 × g, for 10 min.\nAspirate supernatant, leaving a small volume (50 μL) if the pellet is hard to distinguish and resuspend each sample in 150 μL of cold PEB buffer.\nImmediately preserve the fixed flow samples by storing them at 2°C–8°C, protected from light.\nCritical: Failure to protect the samples from sunlight or visible light can reduce the fluorophore staining intensity. This can result in diminished staining indexes and can negatively impact the data analysis and interpretation of the acquired flow data. In the event, it is recommended to redo the flow procedure rather than analyze cells that sit overnight at room temperature (18°C–23°C) or were exposed to light for more than 4 h.\nNote: We prefer to perform the flow cytometry on the fixed samples no longer than 24 h after fixation. However, others have stored fixed flow samples for more extended periods. We have not attempted to analyze after 24 h and do not recommend doing so unless the users independently test the conditions.",
    "Pause point: The antibody-labeled fixed cell samples can be stored at 2°C–8°C, protected from light, and analyzed within 24 h post-fixation. The single-stained compensation bead controls should be prepared immediately before submitting/running the fixed flow samples (see step #58, below).\n30–90 min before submitting the flow samples, prepare single-stained controls using the Miltenyi Compensation Beads Anti-REA Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0009105.PDF].\nUsers should have a total of 8 single-stained bead controls, one per unique fluorophore, for this particular protocol.\nCritical: Each unique fluorophore must have a single-stained compensation bead control sample. Therefore, the number of single-stained compensation bead control samples will equal the unique number of fluorophores in the antibody cocktail panel.\nPerform flow cytometry on the cell samples using a BD LSRII YG (Green Profile) flow cytometer. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Flow cytometry data was acquired on a BD LSR II YG (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Compensation beads (Miltenyi MACS® Comp Bead Kit, anti-REA), single-stained cell controls and unstained cell controls were used to perform and construct a compensation matrix. The resulting data were analyzed using FlowJo (Version 10.8.1, BD Biosciences) with plots constructed in the FlowJo layout editor. Specific details on the analysis and processing of the acquired flow cytometry data are beyond the scope of this protocol. However, numerous recommended resources are available for good practices in the processing and analysis (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; DiPiazza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Kalina, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Liechti et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]; Lucas et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Maciorowski et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Mair and Tyznik, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Sun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]; Wang and Hoffman, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32])."
