    "This is an adaptation of a standard cell transfection protocol using the commercially available Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, which is suitable for the majority of cell lines and produces a high level of transfection. Since TCSPC-based FLIM acquisition requires moderate fluorescence intensities, the resulting transfection level might be too high for some cell types. In that case, we suggest further optimization of this protocol, or using Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0002].\nMaterials\nHeLa cells (Ohio, ECACC 84121901; https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/generalcell/detail.jsp?refId=84121901&collection=ecacc_gc[href=https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/generalcell/detail.jsp?refId=84121901&collection=ecacc_gc]; other cell types might require additional optimization of the procedure)\nComplete cell growth medium: DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (for HeLa cells), or a cell-type-specific medium composition (for other cell lines)\nPurified plasmid DNA in nuclease-free water, 1 µg/µl or similar concentration: sfGFP-Nrf2, Keap1-12 fl-mCherry [referred to here as Keap1-mCherry (Dikovskaya, Appleton, Bento-Pereira, & Dinkova-Kostova, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0009]), and optional controls pmCherry-N1 (Clontech 632523), sfGFP-C1 (Addgene 54579), unlabeled Keap1 (Baird, Lleres, Swift, & Dinkova-Kostova, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0001]), and/or sfGFP-mCherry fusion]\nOPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 3198570)\nLipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 11668027)\nSterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Ca++/Mg++-free\n0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution\nDMEM high-glucose with HEPES, no phenol red (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no 21063029) or similar phenol red-free medium\nPhenol red−free complete growth medium: phenol red−free DMEM (see above) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (for HeLa cells), or a cell-type-specific medium composition (for other cell lines)\nCell culture grade 6-well plates\n0.5- and 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nVortex\nGlass-bottom dishes: e.g., 35-mm FluoroDish (World Precision Instruments, cat. no.

    "Calcium phosphate−mediated transfection is less efficient than other transfection methods, but in easy-to-transfect cells such as HeLa or HEK293, it provides moderate transfection levels sufficient (and in fact preferable) for FLIM experiments. The advantages of this method over Lipofectamine 2000 transfection are: (i) lower cytotoxicity; (ii) intermediate level of fluorescence intensity better compatible with TSCPC-based FLIM; and (iii) significantly lower cost.

    "This protocol describes measurements of fluorescence lifetime using a TCSPC-based approach that works by recording the exact time of emission of individual photons after fluorophores are excited by pulsed laser illumination (Becker, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0003]). The sample is scanned by a high-frequency pulsed laser, and the distribution of times between each photon emission and the respective laser pulse (so-called micro-time) accumulated during a few minutes long FLIM acquisition is generated for each pixel of the image. The measurements are performed by an assembly of a laser scanning microscope and a TCSPC module operated by two separate software applications that run simultaneously. The laser operation, light path and optics, sample position, and detector are controlled by Zen software (Zeiss), while the processing of detector outputs to generate the time-stamped photon map is controlled by the SPCM software (Becker & Hickl GmbH) (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0003]). The two software applications are not automatically coordinated, and the user must manually set, start, and stop the measurement process in each application. The measurement produces a three-dimensional image (X, Y, and micro-time) in a proprietary format, with an .sdt extension, readable by the SPCImage analysis software. Here we describe, from the user perspective, sample handling and setting up and operating both the Zen and SPCM software for repeated measurements of fluorescence lifetime in live cells. The protocol requires prior knowledge of standard fluorescence imaging techniques with the laser scanning microscope and does not include instrument assembly and initial software setup normally performed by the manufacturers.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1792c930-7d34-4052-8ee0-407906c688de/cptx96-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Main components of the instrument assembly and software used in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003] and Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0004] for fluorescence lifetime measurements. Zen software controls the light path including pulsed laser, optics, sample position, and detector, while SPCM software controls the TCSPC module that processes the detector outputs to generate the time-stamped photon map. The two software applications generally run independently from one another. If set as described in Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0004], SPCM takes an additional input from ZEN (indicated as a curved arrow) as a trigger to initiate fluorescence lifetime measurements during time-lapse FLIM.\nMaterials\nTransfected cells in glass-bottom dishes, produced in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0001] or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0002]\nImmersion oil with a refractive index 1.520 (if using oil-immersion lens)\nLens tissues\nPhenol red−free complete medium (as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0001])\nCompound (inducer) to be tested\nVehicle (such as DMSO or acetonitrile, in which the compound is dissolved)",
    "This protocol is designed for the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope operated by Zen software, equipped with a pulsed laser illumination source (either single photon−based, such as InTune laser with 40 MHz pulse frequency and wavelength tunable between 488 and 640 nm, or a two-photon, such as Chameleon laser (Coherent) with 80 MHz pulse frequency and wavelength tunable between 690 and 1064 nm), and HPM-100-40 GaAsP hybrid detector(s) installed at the LSM Binary GaAsP module (BiG) NDD port of the microscope or directly coupled to the rear of the scanhead. Fluorescence Lifetime measurements are performed by an attached Simple-Tau module (Becker & Hickl GmbH) for TCSPC processing, operated via the SPCM software installed on a separate computer. For other FLIM and microscope assemblies, the procedure needs to be modified according to the manufacturer's instructions. For live-cell FLIM, the microscope must also be equipped with an environmental chamber, which maintains temperature at 37°C, CO2 source that provides a humidified gas supply with 5% CO2 content, and a heating Petri-dish holder insert or other specimen holder suitable for cell culture dishes. The CO2 source is not necessary for short-term experiments with cells growing in CO2-independent media. For more details, please see The bh TCSPC handbook (Becker, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0004]).\n1. Switch on the microscope and the main computer; initiate Zen software.\n2. Pre-warm environmental chamber and heated dish holder insert to 37°C.\n3. Set humidified CO2 source to 5% CO2.\n4. If the instrument contains beam splitter-detector assembly that houses fluorescence filters, make sure the correct filters are installed. For measuring fluorescence lifetime of sfGFP-Nrf2, a GFP emission bandpass filter is used (e.g., 500-550 nm or similar). For a 2-photon FLIM, an additional short-pass filter (e.g., 690 nm) is required that blocks far-red and infrared light above the specified cut-off.",
    "5. Switch on the Simple-Tau module and the dedicated computer.\n6. Place the dish with cells in to a specimen holder and move it to the imaging position, supply with CO2, and leave to equilibrate at 37°C for at least 20 min.\nFor intracellular imaging, we use 40×/1.30 or 63×/1.40 oil-immersion lenses.\n7. Using standard confocal optical path, select a cell with intermediate green (sfGFP-Nrf2) and red (Keap1-mCherry) intensities, and normal cell morphology—see examples in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0002].\nIt is useful to examine the entire sample before selecting cells for measurements, to make sure that the selected cells are representative of the sample and are within a low-to-medium range of intensities. Very bright cells should be avoided. Optionally, you can select all cells that will be measured at this stage and record their positions using the “Positions” tool in Zen. For this, select “Positions” in the multidimensional acquisition area to open the Position List panel, and add the positions of the selected cells to the list. Save the position list into a file (if the “Save as” option is hidden, click on “Show all” at the top of the panel to reveal more functions).\n8. Make a snapshot of the selected cell in green and red channels, using standard confocal lasers, with laser power and gain adjusted to avoid saturation of intensities.\nUse the same settings to image all cells in the experiment, to be able to compare them. Increase averaging number in the Acquisition Mode window to expand the intensity range that could be imaged with the same settings.",
    "9. In Zen, define the beam path for FLIM in the Light Path window. Depending on the microscope setup, choose the main dichroic beam splitter (MBS) in the “Visible light” or “Invisible light” group used for the pulsed laser (such as f-MBS 405/490c/640c for InTune laser or MBS 760+ for two-photon laser), and select “plate” for the other group. For the FLIM detectors at NDD port, guide the light into “Fiberout.”\n10. In Zen, set up the following acquisition parameters in the Acquisition Mode window:\n         \nFrame size: 512 × 512 (pixels)\nScan Mode: Frame\nDirection to —-> (unidirectional)\nAcquisition speed: 9 or similar\nAveraging: Number − 1\n11. In Zen, select a suitable pulsed laser. If the wavelength is tunable, set up excitation to 490 nm for InTune, or to 920 nm for 2-photon laser.\n12. Reduce laser power to minimal (e.g., 0.2).\n13. Set pinhole to 1 AU.\n14. Select zoom suitable for the entire range of samples that minimizes the empty spaces around cells.\nOnce the parameters for FLIM are set, the entire configuration can be recorded and reused using icons in the Configuration tab, or by reusing settings from the previously acquired file. If settings are re-used, the Positions need to be loaded separately from the saved file.\n15. Open the SPCM software on the computer that operates the TCSPC module.\n16. If the Simple-Tau box is switched on, the SPCM will start in hardware mode—select OK. If, instead, the SPCM starts in simulation mode, check that all instruments are connected and switched on, and re-start the SPCM software.\n17. In SPCM, set up the following parameters (or check that they are such in the used Predefined Setup):\nIn the main panel:\n         \nselect “StopT”\nunder “Time,” select “Collection” and type “120”",
    "This will set up the duration of FLIM acquisition that will automatically stops after 2 min.\nIn the System Parameters window:\n         \nStopT: enabled\nunder “Data format,” “ADC resolution” should be “256”\nThis is the time resolution of the fluorescence lifetime measurements, represented by the number of discrete “time bins” in the time axis for the fluorescence decay curve. Higher values could be used if desired; however, this dramatically increases the file size and, in our experience, does not significantly improve the precision of measurements in our system.\nunder “Page Control,” “Image pixels X” and “Image pixels Y” should be “512” and “512,” to correspond to image size in Zen software.\nKeep the rest of the parameters in System Parameters window as set during installation.\n18. Click “continuous” in Zen. This will start the laser.\nThe display window in Zen will show a very low-level signal (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9312a982-300a-4b7f-b6c6-3f674c5ec870/cptx96-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nRead-out of fluorescence intensity during FLIM acquisition.

(B) The “photon” acquisition rates displayed in the Main Panel of SPCM software during FLIM acquisition, corresponding to the number of events per second at different stages of signal processing in TCSPC electronics (Becker, 2017).\n19. In the DCC-100 Detector Control window in SPCM, click “Enable Output.”\nThis activates the FLIM detector.",
    "The CFD, TAC, and ADC rates indicators (bars at the bottom left, Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0004]) will rise up from zero to show the signal detection rates. If CFD rate is higher than 1E+6, reduce laser power or pinhole size in Zen software. If the light intensity at the detector is too high, DCC-100 may shut down the detector due to the overload, to protect it from damage. If this happens, reduce laser intensity and press “reset” on the DCC-100 panel.\n20. Optional: If necessary, refocus, guided by the low-level signal display in Zen (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0004]) or CFD rate in SPCM (the highest when in focus). If the focus offset between standard and FLIM detector is known, and the sample is well equilibrated, refocusing could be done by stepping through Z-position within the Focus panel in Zen, after typing the value of the focus offset into the Step Size window.\n21. Increase laser power to achieve CFD rates between 5 × 104 and 1 × 106, ideally 1−5 × 105 events per second.\nIf the laser power required for the necessary CFD rate is extensive (for cells expressing very little fluorescence), care should be taken to avoid bleaching and phototoxicity. Bleaching will be apparent by the gradual loss of the CFD rate under continuous laser illumination. Phototoxicity can be seen from changes in cell shape after several minutes of such illumination, and in extreme cases, as membrane blebbing and cell death. Laser power should be adjusted well below the levels that cause such artifacts on a subset of cells that will not be used for measurements.",
    "When adjusting laser power, the coverage of image area by fluorescence needs to be taken into account. The CFD rates displayed during scanning are averaged over a large area of the image, or the entire image. The empty spaces within the image lower the displayed CFD rate, without impact on the actual acquisition rate in the fluorescent parts of the image.\n22. In SPCM, click “Start.” The display window will become active to show the accumulation of photons.\n23. When acquisition is finished (in 2 min), the total event count and the file size will be displayed. In Zen, manually stop the laser. In the DCC-100 Detector Control panel, click “Disable Outputs.”\n24. In SPCM, save the file (in the Save panel, write or choose file name, and click “Save”).\n25. Repeat steps 18-24 for all cells of interest.\n26. Prepare an inducer or vehicle solution at a 10-fold higher concentration than the desired final concentration, in phenol red−free complete medium, in a final volume in excess of 200 µl per dish. Warm up to 37°C immediately before use.\n27. Add 200 µl of the inducer or vehicle solution to 1800 µl medium (for 3.5 cm dish) or 60 µl to 540 µl medium (for a chamber of a 4-chamber dish), being careful not to move the sample and to return the instrument to the same position as before treatment.\n28. Leave for 3-10 min to re-equilibrate.\n29. Refocus on the same cells, using the standard lasers, and update the Position List.\n30. Repeat steps 18-24 for all cells, after the desired incubation times.\n31. Re-image cells with standard lasers and settings identical to those used in step 8.",
    "The procedure is similar to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003], but sequential acquisition of FLIM measurements for several positions and time points is done automatically. This is an adaptation of a microscope-controlled time series routine in SPCM that accepts an external trigger to start each new measurement and allows automatic data collection and file recording. The time course details (such as positions and time intervals) are set in Zen, which sends a trigger signal to SPCM at the beginning of each imaging step as it runs the time-lapse experiment. In this scenario, unlike in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003], acquisition in Zen is not continuous and, therefore, its duration time has to be specified to be slightly longer than required for each FLIM measurement within SPCM. This is achieved by using a high averaging number and slow acquisition speed (long pixel dwell time) in Zen, and adjusting the recording time in SPCM to fit the expected scan time. This imposes an additional limit on the duration of FLIM acquisition. To overcome the potential loss of accuracy due to the lower number of recorded photons, we reduce the spatial resolution of the data (using a 256 × 256 image size). This protocol significantly streamlines FLIM measurements to save time and user manual involvement, and allows more frequent data collection and/or bigger sample size than those possible with Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003].",
    "The pitfalls include potential loss of in-focus information if cells migrate out of focus (as there is no possibility to re-focus between measurements), the danger of blocked recording of all subsequent measurements due to even a temporary detector overload in one of the positions, the need to choose cells with similar level of fluorescence intensity to be measured with the same laser settings, and the sequential naming of the recorded output files that does not discriminate between positions and time points.",

In step 7, recording positions of the cells into the Position List is required and not optional.\n2. Using Zen and SPCM settings and the procedure outlined in steps 10-21 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003] for the brightest and dimmest among selected cells, adjust the laser power to a level suitable for all measurements.\n3. In Zen, set up the following acquisition parameters in the Acquisition Mode window:\n         \nFrame size: 256 × 256 (pixels)\nScan Mode: Frame\nDirection to —-> (unidirectional)\nAveraging: Number – 16, Mode – Frame, Method – “mean”\nBit depth to 8 bit\nIt might be necessary to click on “Show all” at the top of the tab to see some of these options.\n4. Adjust Speed/Pixel Dwell to achieve Scan Time that is at least 5 s longer than the desired individual FLIM acquisition time. (e.g., for 80 s FLIM acquisition, Scan Time can be 1 min 29 s).\nThis will allow extra time for saving FLIM data files.\n5. Select “Time Series” in the multidimensional acquisition area—this will open the Time Series panel. Within it, select the number of cycles (i.e., the number of times each cell to be measured) and the interval between repeated measurements of the same cell.\n6. Set up laser power to the number optimized in step 2.\n7. In the System Parameters window of SPCM, choose:\n         \nOperation Mode: “FIFO image”\nStopT: enabled\nCycles: type the total number of measurements (a product of the number of stage positions multiplied by the number of measurements for each position)\nNote that the meaning of “cycle” in SPCM is different from that in Zen\nAutosave: “Each cycle”",

    "This will start the time series, which will run automatically. However, it is important to keep an eye on it, since even a temporary increase in the local fluorescence intensity in one of the positions (which could happen if, for example, a cell becomes apoptotic) can cause detector overload that will stop image acquisition in all following measurements for all positions. If this happens, manually Reset the DCC-100 Detector Controller and restart.\n11. If treatment is required: prepare treatment solution or vehicle at a 10-fold higher concentration than the desired final concentration in phenol red−free complete medium and add to the dish, as in steps 26-28 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003].\n12.

Update and save the Positions List.\n13. Return to parameters set in steps 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n14. In the Time Series window in Zen, choose new number of measurements (“number of cycles”) and the interval between repeated measurements of the same cell as in step 5.\n15. In the System Parameters window of SPCM, write a new number of cycles and a new file name in Spec data file.\n16. Repeat steps 8-10.",
    "The photon data traces generated in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003] and Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0004] include Instrument Response Function (IRF), an instrument-generated signal that needs to be removed before further analysis. The shape of IRF can be estimated in the SPCImage analysis software from the rising edge of the data trace, giving the so-called synthetic IRF. However, using the directly measured IRF can improve the accuracy of fluorescence lifetime measurements (Dikovskaya et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0009]). For 2-photon FLIM systems, IRF can be determined from the photon trace of gold nanorods that produce ultrafast luminescence that outlines instrument signal in a broad fluorescence spectrum (Talbot et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0023]).

    "The fluorescence lifetime in each pixel of a FLIM data file acquired in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0003] or Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0004] is determined by fitting an exponential decay model to the photon data trace, after removing IRF by de-convolution (Becker, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0003]; Lakowicz, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0014]). This protocol explains how to do this in SPCImage. Each measurement is processed individually; however, in order to produce compatible results, the same analytical parameters should be used for the entire experiment (all apart from the Shift, see below). After initial optimization, the parameters can be stored with the settings and reused, to speed up the workflow. We suggest using a single-exponential model that has the lowest requirement for the size of the dataset (the number of photons in trace) for accurate evaluation. The protocol generates two export files (one with photon numbers, and another with fluorescence lifetimes in each pixel), as well as an optional illustration, from each measurement for further processing. Selection of areas of interest and recording the fluorescence lifetime statistics are not required at this stage, as it will be done outside SPCImage as described in Basic Protocols 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0007] and 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0008].

This will generate two data files (name_t1.asc and name_photons.asc) and the color image with the legend (Fig. 6E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0006]).\nOptional: if 2-component analysis is used, the “a1,” “t2,” and “a2” need to be checked in addition to “t1” and “Pixel intensities” under Matrix. This will generate four files that will need to be further processed to generate the matrix with mean fluorescence lifetimes (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0007]).\nNote that the “t1” file in this case describes the smallest fluorescence lifetime component determined by the multiexponential decay fitting, and not the mean fluorescence lifetime, as for 1-component analysis.\n8. Save the analyzed file. This will generate a new file with an .img extension that contains the settings and the calculated fluorescence lifetimes. This file serves as a record for the fluorescence lifetime quantification parameters.",
    "This protocol describes the procedure for selecting areas of interest in the images exported from SPCImage using the freely available ImageJ/FIJI software. It uses SPCImage export files containing photon numbers (name_photons.asc) and generates a new file for each selection. For ease of further analysis, we recommend naming the new files according to the type of selection, and storing all files derived from the same measurement in the same folder (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0008], step 6). In addition, we describe processing of the four SPCImage export files from 2-component analysis to generate a single file containing mean fluorescence lifetimes in pixel positions.\nMaterials\nImageJ or FIJI software. We use versions 1.52p or 1.52q. Other versions have not been tested.\nExported files from SPCImage containing matrices with photon number per pixel (name_photons.asc files) generated in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0006]\nOptional: Exported files from FLIM measurement analyzed with a 2-component model in SPCImage, containing matrices with individual fluorescence lifetime components and their amplitudes in pixel positions (name_t1.asc, name_t2.asc, name_a1.asc, and name_a2.asc files) generated in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0006]\n1. In ImageJ/FIJI, import the “name_photons.asc” file using File -> Import -> text image.\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/2f857c3f-eea0-49a5-9594-cdd054371172/cptx96-gra-0012.png\n2. Outline the cell, using either the polygon (A) or the freehand (B) selection tool.\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/65413a93-9e20-49da-83ac-c9df85728235/cptx96-gra-0013.png\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/ca0c2df7-3f5b-43c3-ad2d-300c815b3589/cptx96-gra-0014.png\n3. Set up all pixel values outside selected area to zero using Edit -> Clear Outside.\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/754b6076-1502-49aa-bc9b-cb49dff2e427/cptx96-gra-0015.png\nThis will set the values outside the selection to the background color. Make sure that the background color is set to black in Edit -> Options -> Colors\n4. Save as new file using File -> Save As -> text image. When saving, modify the name to indicate the type of selection (e.g., original “name_photons.asc” file will be normally saved as “name_photons.txt” file. Modify to “name_photons_ez.txt” for selection of entire cell area).",
    "5. Optional: the file can be further modified to select subcellular regions of interest. For this, deselect existing selection (Edit -> Selection -> Select none, or click on the area outside the selection). Make a new selection (as in A). Repeat “Edit -> Clear Outside” to retain outlined area (see B), or “Edit -> Clear” to retain area of the cell that excludes selected region (C).\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/ab694eb8-bd31-4412-9117-f94e4e4e24a5/cptx96-gra-0016.png\nSave each file as in step 4, modifying the name to reflect selected area (e.g., “name_photons_cz.txt” for cytoplasm or “name_photons_nz.txt” for nucleus).\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Do not crop the image, as altered file dimensions will make it incompatible with the file containing fluorescence lifetime information.\n6. Optional: If a two-component multi-exponential model was used in SPCImage (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0006]), the matrix containing mean fluorescence lifetimes at the pixel positions needs to be generated from exported t1, t2, a1, and a2 files for each measurement, using the following formula:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/9e187e10-ef00-4d18-929a-119e21c9b502/cptx96-math-0001.png\nwhere tm is mean fluorescence lifetime in the pixel position, t1 and t2 are fluorescence lifetimes of the first and second components in the corresponding pixel, and a1 and a2 are the relative amplitudes of these components in the same pixel [adapted from the BH TCSPC handbook (Becker, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-bib-0004])]. A file with these tm values in pixel positions can be produced using an ImageJ/FIJI macro, tm_2cFLIM.ijm, that we developed for this purpose (available at https://github.com/DinaDikovskaya/FLIMacro[href=https://github.com/DinaDikovskaya/FLIMacro]).",
    "Visualization and quantification of fluorescence lifetime changes are performed within the R-based FLIM DAtaSet Tool (FLIMDAST). Since the design of a FLIM time course is usually complex and varies between experiments, we developed FLIMDAST as a user interface that collects information about the layout of FLIM experiment and links the names/locations of the processed data files to the elements within this layout. Crucially, it assigns each measurement specific reference data to which the measurement should be compared. Within the user interface, any pair of reference/non-reference measurements can be displayed and visually compared in the overlay scatterplot that plots fluorescence lifetime in each pixel against photon number detected in the same pixel (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0001]). The overlay settings are user-defined and can be applied to the entire experimental dataset (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0001]). Similarly, the user defines parameters for calculating intensity-independent changes in fluorescence lifetime that are then applied to the entire experiment (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0001]). The outputs are a PDF file with the abovementioned scatterplots, and/or a CSV file with calculated intensity-independent changes in fluorescence lifetimes, as well as mean fluorescence lifetimes and mean photon numbers per pixel for all measurements within the time-course experiment.\nMaterials\nSPCImage export files containing fluorescence lifetime matrices, generated in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0006] (“name_t1.asc” files) or files derived from processing the t1, t2, a1, and a2 export files (if the 2-component analysis was used)\nFiles generated in ImageJ/FIJI containing photon numbers in pixels within areas of interest, produced in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0007], or “name_photons.asc” files exported from SPCImage in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0006]\nR software: FLIMDAST was developed in R version 3.3.3; versions other than 3.3.3 and 3.6.3 have not been tested\nRStudio: We use version 1.1.383; other versions have not been tested",
    "1. Download the FLIMDAST folder containing the app.R file from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/DinaDikovskaya/FLIMDAST[href=https://github.com/DinaDikovskaya/FLIMDAST]) according to the instructions in the accompanying README.md file, and place the folder into a working directory on your computer.\n2. Open RStudio and start FLIMDAST: From inside RStudio, set up the correct working directory [in the top ribbon, select Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory, navigate to the directory that contains the FLIMDAST folder (but not to the FLIMDAST folder itself!), and click “Open”]. In the Console panel, type library(“shiny”) and click Enter. Type runApp(“FLIMDAST”) and click Enter. This will open a FLIMDAST user interface in a local host window.\nBefore calling library(“shiny”) and running FLIMDAST, it might be necessary to install packages listed in the “requirements” section of the accompanying README.md file, if they have not been installed previously. In this case, follow instructions in the README.md file.\nFLIMDAST can be further opened in a default web browser window by clicking on the “Open in Browser” sign at the top left of the local host window.\nAn internet connection is not required for running the downloaded FLIMDAST version.\n3. In FLIMDAST, open “Experiment Layout” tab. Choose the number of experimental conditions (measurement groups) in your experiment. Give them names in the corresponding fields.\n4. Select number (up to two) of additional regions of interest in each cell to be analyzed. Give them names in the corresponding fields.\nTo analyze only one area (such as entire image, or one outlined area), select “none.”\n5. Indicate if the time course is divided into separate parts (up to three parts are possible), and select the number of time points in each part.",
    "For example, if each cell was measured twice (once before and once after treatment), there are two options: (1) indicate “no” for “Time-course divided into parts” and select 2 time points, or (2) indicate “two parts” for “Time-course divided into parts” and select 1 time point in each part.\n6. Open the “Single Object Time Course” tab. Choose the experimental condition from the choices provided earlier on the “Experiment Layout” tab. For each measurement, select its Time point from the menu build based on the experimental layout, assign Reference status, and select the location of the requested files, using the corresponding “Choose file” buttons. The Fluorescence lifetime file is the “name_t1.asc” SPCImage export file containing the fluorescence lifetime matrix (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0006]) or the “name_tm.txt” file generated by the tm_2cFLIM.ijm macro from the t1, t2, a1, and a2 outputs of 2-component analysis (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0007]). Photon number files are the .txt files generated in ImageJ from the photon matrix file exported from SPCImage (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-prot-0007]) or the “name_photons.asc” export file from SPCImage. If “autofill files” is switched on, the file names for the photon data can be automatically generated from the name of the fluorescence lifetime file, based on the replacement patterns that can be typed in the fields opposite from the corresponding “Choose file” buttons. The locations/names of selected files will be indicated underneath the “Choose file” buttons.",
    "For “autofill files” to work, the fluorescence lifetime and photon number files have to be in the same folder. If the generated name does not match any of the existing files in that folder, or the pattern that needs to be replaced is not found in the fluorescence lifetime file name, the message “file does not exist” will be displayed. If not altered by the user, the time points will automatically appear in sequential order, and the Reference status will be assigned to the first time point.\n7. Once all files are located, click Add. This will assemble all information about the measurement into one table entry.\n8. Repeat steps 6-7 for all measurements of the same cell within the entire time course. Within such a time course, each time point can be chosen only once, and one of them should be a reference.\n9. If added by mistake, the last table entry may be removed by clicking “Delete last entry.”\n10. Once the data for the entire time course of one object/cell are collected in the table, click “Save to main table.” This will pass all information to the “Main Table” tab, reset the current table, and give the next cell a new ID number. The cell ID numbers are sequential within each experimental condition.\n11. Repeat steps 6-10 for all cells in the experiment, for all experimental conditions.",
    "12. All measurements will be assembled in the Experiment data location table in the “Main Table” tab. It can be saved, cleared, or uploaded from a previously saved file using “Download Main Table,” “Empty Main Table,” and “Upload table from file” buttons, respectively. The “Upload table from file” button opens a browser bar for selecting the file. The selected file will be uploaded into a separate table. To replace the current table with the uploaded table, click “Use as Main Table.” This will reset the numbers and names of the additional regions in the “Experiment Layout” tab to match their values in the uploaded table.\n13. To set plotting and quantification parameters, highlight two table entries in the “Single Object Time Course” or the “Main Table” tab, including one reference and one non-reference measurement. Click “Use for settings.” This will pass selected datasets to the “Plot” and “Quantify” tabs, and activate the plot displays.\n14. Open the “Plot” tab. Select the reference dataset for the first layer of scatterplot, and choose its color. Indicate if you want to overlay it with another dataset. Repeat for overlay dataset(s)—up to 3 overlays are possible. Adjust scales for fluorescence lifetime and photon number in the scatterplot. The displayed scatterplot can be downloaded at this point using the “Download plot” button. If you would like to use this scatterplot layout for the entire experiment, click “Use these settings.” Repeat if more than one layout is desired. The last added design can be removed by clicking “Remove last settings.”",
    "15. To apply the plot settings to the entire experiment, click “Plot all data.” This button becomes visible in the “Plot” and “Main Table” tabs when the Experiment data location table in the “Main Table” tab is not empty and plot settings are selected in the “Plot” tab. This will generate and download a multi-page PDF file with plots for the entire experiment.\nWhen opened in a default browser, FLIMDAST might handle downloads differently.\nFor large datasets, generating plots can take several minutes.\n16. In the “Quantify” tab, select regions for calculating the intensity-independent change in fluorescence lifetime relative to the reference dataset.\nWe recommend using the entire cell data as a reference, to maximize intensity overlap between reference and non-reference files.\n17. In the “Quantify” tab, using the “data” and “model” switches, choose the display items for the scatterplot that help to visualize the quantification algorithm. These switches do not affect quantification. If any “scatter” is on, the value of intensity-independent difference between selected datasets will be displayed under the title of the plot. The plot can be downloaded using the “download plot” button.\n18. Optional: In the “Quantify” tab, select lower and/or upper limits for the intensity region included in quantification. Without these limits, the fluorescence lifetime change will be quantified within the overlapping range of intensities of the reference and non-reference datasets trimmed by removing the brightest 0.5% and the dimmest 0.5% of the pixels.\nThis can be used to remove pixels with intensity levels deemed inappropriate for a particular experiment from calculations. For example, if fluorescence lifetime is calculated using a 2-component model, the accuracy of quantification can be increased by removing “dim” pixels.",
    "19. Click “Use these settings” to select the chosen quantification parameters for the entire experiment. Repeat if more than one set of settings is desired. The last added settings can be removed by clicking “Remove last settings.”\n20. To apply the quantification settings to the entire experiment, click “Quantify all data.” This button becomes visible in the “Quantify” and “Main Table” tabs when the Experiment data location table in the “Main Table” tab is not empty and quantification settings are selected in the “Quantify” tab. This will generate a Result Table with the changes in fluorescence lifetime (columns named “shift”) for each non-reference measurement in the Main Table. In addition, it contains mean values for fluorescence lifetime (mean_t1) and photon number per pixel (mean_photons) for each analyzed region of the cell. Download the Result Table by clicking on the “Download Results” button.\nNote that mean values of fluorescence lifetimes (mean_t1, mean_t1_reg1, and mean_t1_reg2) are not corrected for fluorescence intensity−dependent bias; thus, the differences between these values are not expected to be equal to the calculated fluorescence-intensity independent changes.\nFor large datasets, building of the Results table can take several minutes.\n21. To close FLIMDAST, close the local host window, or click the red “STOP” button at the top of the Console window in RStudio.\nSample data can be seen on Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.96#cptx96-fig-0007].

    "Data examples. (A) Incubation of magnetic beads with immobilized sfGFP-mCherry fusion protein with 75 µM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, N = 21) but not PBS (N = 18) causes a minor reduction in mCherry fluorescence. Error bars show standard deviation. (B, C) This slightly increases the fluorescence lifetime of the sfGFP-mCherry beads (B) due to diminished FRET between sfGFP and mCherry, but not of beads with immobilized sfGFP incubated with the same hydrogen peroxide solution (C). sfGFP fluorescence lifetimes of the sfGFP-mCherry (B) or sfGFP (C) beads measured before (black) and re-measured after (green overlay) hydrogen peroxide treatment are plotted against photon numbers in respective pixels. (D) Quantification of the effect of hydrogen peroxide for multiple beads with immobilized sfGFP (N = 10) or sfGFP-mCherry (N = 14), where each dot represents a change in fluorescence lifetime from before treatment in an individual bead. Δtm denotes change in fluorescence lifetime. The box plots show the distribution of values within each group of beads: the box outlines the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles, the thick line within the box marks the median, and the whiskers show minimum and maximum values that extend from the box by no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles). (E) FLIM was measured in HeLa cells co-expressing sfGFP-Nrf2 and Keap1-mCherry three times—twice before and once after treatment with the Nrf2 inducer sulforaphane (SFN), and their fluorescence lifetimes were determined and plotted against photon numbers. The first measurement served as a reference (black) that is overlaid with data acquired before (left panel) or after (right panel) treatment with 2.5 µM sulforaphane. The overlay datasets are color-coded for pixels within nucleus (blue) or cytoplasm (red).",
    "(F) Quantification of the entire experiment described in E, with each dot representing a change in fluorescence lifetime in one cell from the first (reference) measurement, displayed as in D. (G) Fluorescence lifetime distribution among pixels of HeLa cells co-expressing sfGFP-Nrf2 and Keap1-mCherry, analyzed with either binning level 1 (purple), which does not produce sufficient number of photons in traces, or binning level 3 (light blue), which significantly increases the photon number in each trace. Note a much tighter distribution achieved with bin 3. Note that the number of photons on the X-axis corresponds to the value with binning level zero. (H) Effect of fitting model on the precision of fluorescence lifetime quantification. FLIM measurements from cells co-expressing sfGFP-Nrf2 and Keap1-mCherry were analyzed using either a 1-component (left panel) or a 2-component (right panel) exponential decay model, with otherwise identical settings. Note the tighter distribution of the fluorescence lifetime quantified with a 1-component analysis fitting. The nuclear area of the cell is indicated in blue, and the cytoplasmic area is indicated in red."
