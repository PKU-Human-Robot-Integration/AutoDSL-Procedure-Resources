    "1. Equipment and Reagents Created In-house (See List of Material for Others)\nPrepare a Drosophila cold anesthesia apparatus to perform fly work.\n\t\nCut a porous polyethylene sheet to cover a small plastic box (12.7 cm long, 10.2 cm wide), typically the top cover of a pipette tips box (12.7 cm long, 10.2 cm wide, 3.8 cm deep).\nFill the box with crushed ice, cover with the porous polyethylene sheet. \nPrepare a T-maze apparatus; adapt the apparatus previously described in details 28-31.\nPrepare a fly aspirator as described 32.\nPrepare a phototaxis response apparatus to displace flies in and out of test vials without stress:\n\t\nUse a countercurrent apparatus, as described by29,33.\nNOTE: The T-maze can also be used for other purposes, as described by28.\nEnsure homogeneous lighting conditions: perform the experiment on a bench covered with a white bench cover, and in front of a white board.\n\tNOTE: For these experiments, the fly strains used were Drosophila melanogaster wild-types: Canton-S, Oregon and Samarkand flies from our laboratory stocks34; Elwood flies were collected in Fall 2011 in the Elwood neighborhood of Huntington, on Long Island, New York, USA.\n2. Preparing the Flies before the Experiment\n1-2 days before performing the experiment: \nMaintain flies on standard cornmeal-agar-molasses-yeast medium at 25 °C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle.\nCollect the responder flies under cold anesthesia 1-2 days prior to performing the experiment\n\t\nTransfer the flies from the bottles in which they have been raised into 50 ml Falcon tubes, using a funnel.\nPlace the falcon tube with the flies under ice level, into an insulated ice bucket.\nPlace the cold anesthesia apparatus with crushed ice at -4 °C to chill.\nWait 5 min for the flies to enter a chill coma.",
    "Transfer the flies onto the porous polyethylene sheet of the cold anesthesia apparatus.\nCollect the responder flies on the cold anesthesia apparatus. At RT, under a stereomicroscope, separate 3-7 days old male from female flies and maintain these flies in groups of 40.\nCollect the emitter flies 1-2 days prior to performing the experiment.\n\t\nGently collect Canton-S mixed-sex flies from their bottles, using a mouth aspirator, controlling for their number.\nMaintain these flies in group of 60-100, as they will be the emitters.\nPrepare as many samples of emitters as data points needed.\nAllow at least a night of recovery after collection of the responders and emitters, to minimize any confounding effect of the cold anesthesia and mouth aspirator collection on behavior.\nOpen the bag of test vials, to allow for the stale plastic-smelling air in the bag to be replaced by fresh air, at least 1 day prior to the experiment.\n2 hr before performing the experiment:\nEnsure that the temperature in the room in which the experiment is performed is around 23-25 °C, with even light, and humidity above 30%.\nTransfer the responders and emitters fruit flies into fresh food vials to ensure that these flies are not starved.\nLet the fruit flies adjust to the environment for 2 hr, on the bench on which the experiment will be performed.\n3. Performing the Social Avoidance Experiment\nPerform each experiment at the same time of the day, in a range of 3–4 hr in the afternoon between Zeitgeber time ZT5 and ZT9.\nPlace the T-maze on the pounding pad, and tighten the screw clip so the elevator is stable.\nTransfer the responder flies into a fresh test vial. Snap this vial containing the responder flies onto the top part of the T-maze.",
    "Slant the T-maze apparatus and tap it on the pounding mat so the fruit flies fall in the elevator.\nMove the top part of the elevator down so the flies are between the top and bottom section of the T-maze, but pay attention to keep the elevator above the choice point – to prevent the flies from escaping.\nObtain vials with dSO (see Section 5 to generate dSO-free vials that were previously occupied by flies).\n\t\nWhile the responder flies are adjusting to this new environment, place the emitter flies in a test vial.\nPlace a piece of cotton to close the vial so the fruit flies do not escape.\nMechanically agitate this vial on a mini-vortex as follows: vortex for 15 sec, remove the vial from the vortex for 5 sec. Repeat 3 times for a total of 55 sec.\nRemove the emitter flies out of the fresh vial — by transferring in a food vial — and quickly place this dSO filled vial into one of the two sides of the T-maze apparatus.\nAlternate the side of placement for the dSO filled vial in each new run.\nPlace a fresh test vial on the other side of the T-maze.\nBring the elevator completely down, so the fruit flies can chose between the fresh test vial and the test vial with dSO, and start the timer.\nLet the flies choose between the fresh vial and the dSO vial, for 1 min, unless noted otherwise.\nAfter 1 min, move the elevator up to separate the flies in the fresh vial, dSO vial, and those stuck in the elevator.\nCount the number of flies in each vial, and in the elevator.\nRepeat this for each genotype/condition.\n4. Analyzing the Social Avoidance Data",
    "Count the number of fruit flies in each vial for each genotype, and transfer the data to a spreadsheet.\nUsing a spreadsheet program, calculate the Performance Index (PI) for each genotype by subtracting the number of flies in the dSO vial from the number of flies in the dSO-free vial, and then dividing by the total number of flies.\nCompare the PIs’ means using statistical analysis software for analysis of the results.\n\t\nIdeally, prepare 2-3 internal repeats for each experiment, and 3 independent repeats, performed on different days, with different bottles or crosses30.\nUse Gaussian distribution statistical tests, as the data follow a normal distribution.\nWhen testing one effect (i.e., density — Figure 2), use a one-way ANOVA, with post-test for multiple comparison (column by column), or a simple t-test to compare each result to a control.\nWhen group experiments are performed, test both conditions and genders (empty vials, stressed and un-stressed flies; and gender effect — Figure 1), using a two-way ANOVA.\n5. Generate Vials Previously Occupied by Unstressed Flies — Perform Instead of 3.5 to 3.6\nUse phototaxis to prepare vials occupied by flies that have not been stressed, as a control.\nTransfer the flies in a test vial, and snap it into the countercurrent apparatus, with fresh empty vials in the opposite location.\nLay the apparatus horizontally with the distal vial directly in front of a 15 W fluorescent cool-white light, and cover with a black cloth.\nLet the flies gently move in the fresh vial. This might take several minutes. Once most of the flies are walking toward the light in the distal vial, start the timer for 1 min.\nGently remove the black cloth, switch the location of the light, recover with the black cloth, and allow the flies to leave the test vial.",
    "At that time, initiate the choice experiment as in 3.2 to 3.5. Skip 3.6 and 3.7.\nMove the slider of the apparatus, to separate the flies that vacated the test vial from the other side.\nUse the vacated test vial in the T-maze right away for the choice experiment, as in 3.7.\nSubscription Required.
