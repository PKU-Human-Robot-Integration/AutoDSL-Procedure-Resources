    "I. Accessibility of cysteine residues using thiol specific and alkylating reagents Culture and inductionThe culture conditions depend on the expression system and bacterial species used. For E. coli, IPTG inducible promoter such as pLac or L-arabinose inducible pBAD and systems alike are highly recommended. Use a single colony from a fresh plate streaked from -80 °C stock to inoculate a small volume (5 ml) for an overnight culture. Induce expression of the gene of interest in early exponential phase (OD600 around 0.2 in LB medium) and let bacteria grow at 37 °C till late exponential (2 h, OD600 around 0.6-0.7) to produce recombinant protein. This method has to be determined for the protein of interest. Measure absorbance at 600 nm (A600) at the end of induction period and chill culture on slushy ice. Slushy ice is 4 °C and cools the cell culture down quickly. The protocol is based on 1 ml of cells with an A600 of 1.0 (approximately 5 x 108-1 x 109 cells).Preparation of samples for MTSES protectionPrior to experiment: Remove MTSES from -20 °C and let it warm up to room temperature, prepare fresh denaturation buffer and PEG buffer. All steps are performed at room temperature unless stated otherwise.Centrifuge 2 x 1 ml of cell culture for 1 min. at 16,100 x g in tabletop centrifuge. Wash cells in 1 ml PB.Centrifuge cells. Resuspend cell pellet in 0.24 ml PB buffer and add 10 μl 25 mM EDTA (1 mM final). Use cells directly in step C.Note: EDTA treatment permeabilizes the outer membrane.For each sample, aliquot 120 μl into microcentrifuge tubes labeled with (+) and without (-) MTSES. MTSES protectionNote: Treat samples as gently as possible while exposed to MTSES. EDTA permeabilizes the outer membrane, but the cytoplasmic membrane needs to be intact.",
    "After addition of L-cysteine to quench the reaction, samples can be treated more roughly. Wash steps are to remove L-cysteine.Add 13 μl 0.3 M MTSES (30 mM final) to tube labeled (+) MTSES.Add 13 μl dH2O to tube labeled (-) MTSES by carefully pipetting up and down.Incubate 30 min at room temperature.Add 14 μl 1 M L-cysteine (100 mM final) to both tubes by carefully pipetting up and down.Incubate 10 min at room temperature.Add 0.75 ml PB.Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,100 x g in tabletop centrifuge.Wash the cells 2x with 0.5 ml PB.Resuspend cells in 50 μl PB.Sample denaturation with methanol/chloroformNote: Pre-cool tabletop centrifuge to 4 °C.Add 750 μl of Denaturation Buffer.Vortex vigorously, incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.Spin at 16,100 x g for 3 min. Remove supernatant very carefully and completely with pipette. An additional centrifugation step is usually not required. Add 400 μl 95% MeOH.Spin at 16,100 x g for 4 min.Remove supernatant carefully and air-dry pellets for 15 min at room temperature.Note: Do not invert tubes, pellets are loose. Alkylation with malPEGNote: Bring bottle with malPEG to room temperature and make malPEG solution, protect from light. Put malPEG powder back at -20 °C after wrapping bottle with Parafilm.Cool 100% EtOH on ice.Resuspend each air-dried pellet in 100 μl PEG buffer, vortex.Add 20 μl malPEG to each tube and mix carefully by pipetting up and down.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.Add 1.5 ml ice cold 100% EtOH and freeze at -20 °C for 1 h.Note: Samples can be left at -20 °C overnight. SDS-PAGE and Western blottingNote: Before starting, pre-cool tabletop centrifuge.Pellet samples for 15 min at 16,100 x g in tabletop centrifuge.Carefully remove most of the supernatant.Re-centrifuge samples and remove all left over liquid.Air dry pellets.",
    "Note: Do not invert tubes, pellets are loose.Resuspend samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 4 mM DTT.Heat at 100 °C for 5 min.Load equivalent amounts on gel using A600 measurements at time of sample preparation.Load each -/+ pair adjacent to each other.Run gel and Western-blot.II. Accessibility of cysteine to alkylating agents after cleavage of thioester bondFollow protocol described in A.HA treatmentCentrifuge 1.6 ml of cell culture for 1 min at 16,100 x g in tabletop centrifuge.Resuspend cells in 1 ml PB.Divide in 2 x 500 μl in tubes labeled – and + HA and centrifuge cells.Resuspend cells in 500 μl 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1% SDS (-) or 500 μl 1 M HA (pH 7.4), 1% SDS (+) by pipetting up and down.Note: This denatures proteins and cleaves thioester bonds in one step.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Add 50 μl 100% TCA, vortex.Incubate on ice for 30 min. Pre-cool tabletop centrifuge.Centrifuge protein precipitate for 15 min at 16,100 x g at 4 °C.Wash pellet 3 x with 1 ml ice cold acetone (stored at -20 °C) and centrifuge 10 min at 16,100 x g each time.Air dry pellets. Follow steps in E and F.Note: TCA pellets are often difficult to dissolve. Vortex rigorously and frequently."
