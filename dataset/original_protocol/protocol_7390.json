    "Egg-laying media preparation Measure the required quantities of components for the egg-laying media (see Recipes).Boil the media in a conical flask at 100°C. Let the media cool down and then add propionic acid.Pour 2 mL of media in the required number of autoclaved vials and seal the vials with autoclaved cotton plugs. Add yeast paste (yeast extract dissolved in water) at the corner of each vial in order to enhance egg-laying capacity.Setting up crosses for egg collection Collect 10 virgin females from each of the following fly lines: w;+;UAS-SOD1, w;Act-5c-GAL4/CyO-GFP;+ (ubiquitous driver), and w;UAS-SOD1-RNAi;+. Collect the virgins with the help of a stereomicroscope, either in the pupal stage by identifying the male testes as two black dots or in adult stage by detecting meconium and gonads in the posterior.Set three vials containing egg-laying media as follows: (a) SOD1 overexpression: 2 days old, 10 virgin females of w;+;UAS-SOD1 and 5 males of w; Act-5c-GAL4/CyO-GFP;+, (b) 10 virgin females of w;+;UAS-SOD1 and 5 males of Oregon R, and (c) 10 virgin females of w;Act-5c-GAL4/CyO-GFP;+ and 5 males of Oregon R. The first filial generation (F1) of the above-mentioned crosses (a), (b), and (c) will be referred to as M1, C1, and C2, respectively. Write the date of crossing and genotype in each vial using a marker. Similarly, set up egg collection for SOD1 downregulated progenies: (a) SOD1 downregulation: 10 virgin females of w;UAS-SOD1-RNAi;+ and 5 males of w;Act-5c-GAL4/CyO-GFP;+ (F1 named as M2), and (b) 10 virgin females of w;UAS-SOD1-RNAi;+ and 5 males of Oregon R (C3 progenies).In order to assess the effect of various concentrations of CdCl2 on Drosophila, set up egg-laying media vials containing Oregon R males and females in a 1:2 ratio.",
    "Drosophila food media preparation Measure the required quantities (see Recipes) and mix in a flask with a glass stirrer.Boil the media for 15 min on a heater (up to 100°C). Autoclave the media along with the required number of washed glass vials and non-absorbent cotton.Allow the media to cool for a few minutes; then, add the required amount of propionic acid with continuous stirring. Pour 3 mL of media to each vial and seal with cotton plugs.In case of metal media preparation, follow steps C1–C3 without pouring the media in the vials. Prepare CdCl2 stock solutions and pour the required volumes in separate media flasks to obtain working concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 mM (from a 10 mM stock solution), 0.3, 0.6, and 0.75 mM (from a 30 mM stock), and 1 and 1.5 mM (from a 100 mM stock solution) of CdCl2 (see Recipes). Pour 3 mL of media of each concentration to separate vials and seal with cotton plugs.Egg collection and rearing Collect the eggs from the vial by gently stroking with a fine brush soaked in water (Figure 1a). Do not rupture the eggs (check whether they are healthy by microscopic observation of intact micropyle in the egg structure) (Figure 1b). Do not keep any damaged eggs as it may lead to erroneous results in lethality quantification.Place the collected eggs from the experimental setup B2 and B3 in a small square black paper, in cohorts of 40 eggs per vial. Mark the vials with the number of eggs collected, date of collection, and genotype using a marker.Maintain the egg-containing vials at a constant temperature in the incubator. Confirm temperatures using a laboratory thermometer. Notably, GAL4 activity gets enhanced and best expressed at 29°C while the life cycle of Drosophila is fast-forwarded to 10 days.",
    "Hence, for maximal SOD upregulation and downregulation, raise flies at 29°C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4598/bioprotoc-13-02-4598-g001.jpgFigure 1. Egg collection setup (Figure 1a) and eggs after collection (Figure 1b) Screening Genetic crosses often require segregation of markers as per mating schemes given in step B2. Here, green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged embryos were separated from non-GFP embryos in experimental setups B2 before performing step D2.Place the healthy eggs monitored in step D1 in watch glasses. Mark the watch glasses with the genotype, so as not to mix up eggs.Use the fluorescence microscope to segregate GFP-positive from non-GFP eggs. Remove the GFP-positive eggs gently with a brush and discard them.Place a black paper containing non-GFP eggs in the respective media vials and follow step D3.Observation and counting of stagewise lethality Check the egg-containing vials each day. Observe under the stereomicroscope for lethality in embryonic (yellowish to blackish appearance) or larval stage (no movement of mouth hook).Transfer 3rd-instar larvae (n = 20) of control and metal-treated (0.3 and 0.6 mM CdCl2) from extra vials kept for performing behavioral assays at larval stage.Observe and count the number of healthy pupae as well as degenerated pupae. Note down the stage of pupal degeneration: early, mid, or late stage. Encircle pupae with a marker to count their number.Make a note of number and dates of fly eclosion. Also, mark any lethality in adults during their eclosion.Maintenance of adult flies for survival assay Collect flies immediately after their eclosion. Transfer them to fresh media vials. Write the date of eclosion of each genotype on the vial with a marker. Transfer CdCl2-raised flies to normal media post eclosion for survival analysis. Record the death events every day until all flies are dead in one of the groups.Keep aside 20 flies from CdCl2 and normal media vials for behavioral analysis.",
    "Crawling assay Dissolve 2% agarose in distilled water and boil it. Pour the dissolved solution quickly in a glass Petri plate and allow to solidify. Place the Petri plate over a 0.2 mm2 graph paper.Wash 3rd-instar wandering larvae (n = 20), as collected in step F2, one at a time with distilled water; remove the excess water with tissue paper.Transfer one larva at a time to the center of the Petri plate (Figure 2) and allow it to acclimatize for 1 min. Then, start a one-minute timer and note down the number of grids crossed by the larva in the stipulated time. Return the larva to the center and, after a 1 min interval, note down the second reading for the same larva in terms of number of grids crossed in one minute.Repeat the above-mentioned process with each of the 20 larvae collected from control, 0.3 mM, and 0.6 mM CdCl2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4598/bioprotoc-13-02-4598-g002.jpgFigure 2. The figure shows a third-instar larva (a) as well as its enlarged view (b), transferred to the center of a Petri plate, coated with 2% agarose and placed over a 0.2 mm2 graph paper Climbing assay Collect the adults, as mentioned in step G2, two days post eclosion.Introduce one fly at a time in a 10 mL measuring cylinder, seal it with a cotton plug (Figure 3), and allow the fly to acclimatize for 1 min. Tap the cylinder thrice before recording the time taken by the fly to climb a distance of 10 cm. Repeat after a period of 1 min to get a second reading of the same fly.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4598/bioprotoc-13-02-4598-g003.jpgFigure 3. Image of the adult fly climbing assay, wherein a distance of 10 cm has been marked in the cylinder (black line). Time taken for a fly to climb the marked distance was recorded."
