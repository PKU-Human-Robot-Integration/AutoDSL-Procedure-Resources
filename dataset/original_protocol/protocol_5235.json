    "In this protocol we describe a method for the production of a) shRNA (example db-iPRT-hp-s/as: targeting luciferase) or b) miRNA (example db-hp-miR-125b-1: expressing has-miR-125b-1) expressing minimised dumbbell vectors (Jiang et al., 2016). For these dumbbells, shRNA or miRNA expression is driven by the human minimal H1 (mH1) promoter. The mH1 promoter is PCR-amplified using a forward primer which introduces a cleavage site for a nicking endonuclease and a reverse primer introducing a cleavage site for a conventional restriction endonuclease. After incubating the PCR product with both endonucleases, one loop structure of the dumbbell is formed by the refolding overhang generated by the nicking reaction, whereas the other loop is formed by ligation of a shRNA or miRNA-coding hairpin oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Ligation is performed in the presence of appropriate restriction enzymes to suppress the formation of misligated products (Cost, 2007). The enzymatic ligation assisted by nucleases (ELAN) method suppresses the formation of misligated products such as dimers composed of the loop oligos or the expression cassette which are being cleaved in the presence of restriction endonuclease (in this example BamHI and BglII), thereby facilitating the formation of the intended dumbbell structure which doesn’t comprise the respective endonuclease cleavage sites. Finally, non-ligated DNA is destroyed by exonuclease treatment and exonuclease-resistant dumbbells are purified (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170601/20170601234431_1356.jpgFigure 2. Production strategy for small RNA-expressing minimized dumbbell vectors. The protocol consists of the following steps: First, the mH1 promoter sequence is amplified by PCR. Proper nicking enzyme (NE) and conventional restriction (RE) sites are introduced via the PCR primers. Second, the amplified promoter DNA is digested using the corresponding nicking and restriction enzymes. Third, the digested DNA is purified, and fourth annealed and ligated with the hairpin DNA template oligo using T4 DNA ligase to form an shRNA (left side) or miRNA (right side) expressing dumbbell vector.",
    "The addition of a neutralizing oligo and the column purification step significantly improve dumbbell yields. Finally, non-ligated DNA is removed by exonuclease treatment and dumbbell vector DNA is purified using standard DNA purification techniques (Jiang et al., 2016).Annealing of oligonucleotidesCorrect folding of sh/miRNA-coding DNA hairpins is achieved by heating 500 pmol oligo DNA to 95 °C for 3 min (Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf) in 10 μl of 1x hybridization buffer and letting the solution cool down to room temperature within 1 h. The mH1 promoter in this protocol has been modified by introduction of an inverted transcriptional terminator. Therefore, the oligonucleotides mH1-Fw and mH1-Rv are dissolved in nuclease-free distilled water to a concentration of 100 μM. 500 pmol of each strand are annealed in 10 μl 1x hybridization buffer by heating to 95 °C for 3 min (Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf) followed by cooling down the solution to room temperature during 1 h (Note 1). PCR amplification of the mH1 promoter sequenceAdd the following components into a thin-walled PCR tube:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030036_2188.jpgPerform PCR using the following thermal cycler conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030143_0139.jpgPCR product is purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Endonucleolytic cleavage of the PCR productCombine the reaction components at room temperature in the order indicated:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030222_4595.jpgIncubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 4 h, then 85 °C for 5 min to inactivate the enzymes (Note 2). Digested DNA is then purified with PCR QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Note 3). Annealing and ligation of the mH1 promoter and the sh/miRNA-coding hairpin oligonucleotideAnnealing of promoter DNA and sh/miRNA-coding hairpin oligonucleotide is achieved by heating equimolar amounts (80 pmol) of each DNAs in 1x hybridization buffer to 95 °C for 3 min (Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf) and letting the solution cool down to room temperature during 1 h.",
    "After annealing, the ligation reaction is set up in the indicated order (Note 4): imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531030301_2401.jpgIncubate the reaction mixture at 22 °C for 4 h or overnight, then incubate at 80 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzymes (Note 5). Withdraw a sample (1-2 µl) from the reaction mixture for gel electrophoresis analysis.Exonuclease treatment and purification of the dumbbell-shaped vectorAdd 1 µl of T7 DNA polymerase (10 U/µl) to the 200 μl ligation mix above, incubate at 37 °C for 1 h and then at 80 °C 10 min to inactivate the enzyme (Note 6). Withdraw a sample (1-2 µl) from the reaction mixture for gel electrophoresis analysis.Perform analytical 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis of the withdrawn samples to monitor the conversion yields and purity of dumbbell vector DNA (Figure 3).Purify the dumbbell DNA using standard phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. In detail, add an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the aqueous dumbbell solution, vortex for 30 sec, and separate the aqueous and organic phase by centrifugation (5 min, 13,000 x g). Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new Eppendorf tube and re-extract residues of phenol. Therefore, add an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), shake rigorously by hand for 30 sec, and separate the phase by centrifugation (30 sec, 13,000 x g). Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new Eppendorf tube and repeat the re-extraction process twice (Note 7). For ethanol precipitation, the aqueous phase was topped up to 400 µl with distilled water, then 0.1 volumes (40 µl) of 3 M potassium acetate (pH 4.8) followed by 2.5 volumes (1,100 µl) ethanol were added, the solution was mixed and incubated at -20 °C for 20 min. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 x g, 4 °C for 15 min.",
    "The pellets were then air-dried. Dissolve the purified DNA in TE buffer or distilled water.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531003615_5411.jpgFigure 3. Analytical gel electrophoresis of dumbbell vector DNA after different treatments. Additional treatments increased dumbbell conversion yield: basic protocol (1), basic protocol with neutralizing oligo (50 pmol) (2), basic protocol with column purification (using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and following standard protocol by QIAGEN) (3), and basic protocol with both treatments (4). The neutralizing oligo binds to the oligo released after nicking enzyme cleavage and prevents that this can bind again to the generated overhang. The column purification removes the small cleavage products and prevents them from relegation in the subsequent ligation step. The highest conversion yield (91%) was achieved with the addition of column purification step. The conversion yield is defined as the yield obtained when comparing the size of the expected dumbbell before and after exonuclease treatment. CP, column purification; Neu, neutralizing oligo (Jiang et al., 2016)."
