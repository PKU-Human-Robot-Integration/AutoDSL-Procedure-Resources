Incubate at 37°C prior to use.\nHarvest murine lung.\nSacrifice the mouse using method approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation in chamber).\nPlace the mouse front side up and generously spray the exposed side of mouse with 70% ethanol.\nUsing clean scissors make an incision in the skin from the abdomen to neck, and tear skin with forceps to expose the subcutaneous tissue from the neck to the abdomen.\nCut the abdominal muscle to expose the liver and move liver and intestine to expose the diaphragm.\nCarefully cut the diaphragm, cut through the lateral extreme of the left and right rib cage and remove the sternum and the rib cages to expose the heart and lungs.\nCut through the renal artery.",
    "Perfuse the lung using a 10 mL syringe with a 25G needle to inject sterile PBS, through the right ventricle of the heart until the lung turn pale (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Generally, 5 mL of PBS is sufficient for perfusion.\nRemove the heart tissue.\nCut away salivary glands covering trachea. Then carefully cut thin muscle lining the trachea to expose the trachea.\nUse forceps to put a ∼ five cm-long nylon string under the trachea and keep the string ready to tie.\nInsert a 22G needle into the trachea and tie a knot with a string to secure needle and trachea together firmly.\nSlowly inflate the lung by injecting 1 mL of the digestion solution with 1 mL syringe (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Make sure to inflate to the cardiac lobe.\nRemove the needle from the trachea and tie a knot with string around the trachea.\nRemove the lung from the mouse and transfer to a 10 cm dish.

Large lung chunks will not yield high cell numbers.",
    "Cut the tip of P1000 pipet and transfer the lung pieces to a 50 mL tube with 14 mL of warm digestion solution.\nRinse the dish with 1 mL of digestion solution to collect any residual pieces of the tissue, and combine them with the tissue collected from step e.\nIncubate sample at 37°C for 1 h with constant horizontal rotation at approximately 10 rpm.\nCritical: Rigorously mix the samples with P1000 pipette about 30 times under the tissue culture hood.

One drop of mouse alveolospheres contain approximately 100,000 cells. Human alveolospheres needs passaging every 14–18 days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).
