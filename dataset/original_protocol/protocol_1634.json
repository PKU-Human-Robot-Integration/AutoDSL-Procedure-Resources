    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSkull-intact surgical preparation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the steps of a skull-intact surgical preparation that allows longitudinal optical access through the intact skull over months.\nAnesthetize the adult mouse (between 6 weeks and 4 months old, either gender) with isoflurane (3% in 100% O2 for induction) using inhalation in an induction box.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse to an isoflurane ventilator with a nose cone. The percent isoflurane is regulated to achieve steady breathing rates (∼1 breath/s) throughout the surgery (usually 1–1.5% in 100% O2). The mouse is kept on a servo-controlled heating pad to maintain body temperature, and the breathing rate is monitored during the entire surgery.\nCover the eyes with copious amounts of Vaseline (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, indicated by white arrowheads) to protect against drying and potential exposure to irritant chemicals (e.g., cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic cement) in the following steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1195-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Surgical procedures of the skull-intact preparation for wide-field calcium imaging\n(A) Protect the eyes with copious amounts of Vaseline (indicated by white arrowheads). Clean and antisepticise the surgical region (marked by the white dashed line). Make a small incision (∼2 mm) on the scalp using fine scissors (marked by the white scissor symbol).\n(B) Starting from the small incision, cut off a circular piece of the scalp to expose the skull covering the dorsal cortex and cerebellum.\n(C) Gently remove the periosteum on the skull surface using a scalpel. Note that the skull is less glossy after removing the periosteum compared to (B). Next, detach the muscles from the occipital bone (within the black dashed line) with a scalpel and push the muscles away.",
    "(D) Insert small pieces of gel foam into the gaps between muscles and the occipital bone to stop bleeding. Wipe the skull with cotton swabs soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove any remaining soft tissues.\n(E) Comparison between moisturized and dry skulls. Note that the dry skull is whiter and less transparent. It is critical to dry the skull completely before applying cyanoacrylate glue, as the glue becomes opaque when encountering a wet surface.\n(F) Remove the gel foam and apply small drops of cyanoacrylate glue to cover the muscles and the occipital bone (marked by the black dashed line). Let the cyanoacrylate glue cure.\n(G) Add drops of dental acrylic cement with a double-end carver to build a thick layer on top of the glue. Let the dental acrylic cement cure. Apply cyanoacrylate glue with a double-end carver to cover the skin along the cuts (indicated by yellow arrowheads).\n(H) Implant the headbar. Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue to the interparietal bone (marked by the black dashed ellipse in G) and place the headbar ∼0.5–1 mm posterior to the lambda. Adjust the angle of the headbar by eyeballing until it is parallel to the transverse plane of the skull (the top side of the headbar and the transverse plane of the skull are marked by yellow dashed lines in the bottom panel). Hold the headbar in place until it stays steady.",
    "(I) Secure the headbar. Left, add drops of cyanoacrylate glue to build a glue layer between the headbar and cement (indicated by the yellow shading area). Let the glue cure. Middle and right, apply dental acrylic cement around the headbar to build up the attachment between bones and the headbar. Make sure the bones posterior to the lambda and the middle part of the headbar are entirely covered. Let the dental acrylic cement cure.\n(J) Build the cyanoacrylate glue layer on the skull. Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue and evenly distribute it to form a thin layer covering the entire skull. Wait for the cyanoacrylate glue to cure to form a solid, smooth, and transparent layer. Repeat 3–4 times to thicken the glue layer. The skull should gradually become more transparent within 20 min, and the blood vessels should become clearly visible compared to the dry skull in (E).\n(K) Protect the eyes from the excitation light of imaging. Cut a chunk (∼5 mm) of black heat shrink tube (∼2 cm diameter) and glue it to the circumference of the skull using cyanoacrylate glue. Then fill the gap between the heat shrink tube and mouse head with black dental acrylic cement from the outside.\nScale bars in (D), 1 mm, in (E and J), 0.5 mm.\nClean and antisepticise the scalp and the surrounding region (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, marked by the white dashed line).\nWipe the surgical region with cotton swabs soaked in 70% ethanol 2–3 times.\nWipe the surgical region with cotton swabs soaked in betadine until the entire surgical region has been infiltrated.",
    "Make a small incision (∼2 mm) on the scalp between two ears using fine scissors (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, marked by the white scissor symbol). Starting from the small incision, cut off a circular piece of the scalp to expose the skull covering the dorsal cortex and cerebellum. Retract the remaining scalp around the cuts with forceps to fully expose the dorsal skull (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: We have found that shaving hair or not before cutting off the scalp does not impact the surgical success rate. However, if there is interfering hair left on the skull after cutting off the scalp, remove the hair with clean cotton swabs or forceps to prevent hindrance to a clear field of view for wide-field calcium imaging.\nCritical: When cutting the scalp close to the eyes, use forceps to lift the scalp and confirm the location of the retro-orbital sinus first. Do not damage the retro-orbital sinus.\nGently remove the periosteum on the skull surface using a scalpel. Note that the skull is less glossy after removing the periosteum (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, compare with Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). If bone bleeding happens, use a dry cotton swab to press the bleeding spot until bleeding stops (usually within 5 min). If the bleeding continues after pressing for more than 10 min, terminate the surgery and exclude the animal from the experiment. Rinse the skull with saline several times to remove any bloodstains. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nCritical: Be particularly gentle when cleaning the periosteum along the bone sutures to avoid bleeding under the skull.",
    "Detach the muscles from the occipital bone (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, muscles within the black dashed line) with a scalpel and push the muscles away. This is to extend the bone interface for cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic cement. This is critical for the steady implantation of the headbar. Next, insert small pieces of gel foam into the gaps between muscles and the occipital bone to stop bleeding (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Some gel foams must be moisturized with saline before applying to the wound. Check the direction of your gel foam and soak small pieces of gel foam in saline if necessary. Though the gel foam (1975, Ethicon) listed in this protocol can be used both dry and saturated with saline, we note that dry gel form is more efficient in stopping muscle bleedings.\nCritical: Keeping the skull clean and smooth is critical to achieving even optical access through the dorsal cortex. When detaching the muscles, be gentle to avoid making deep scratches or notches on the occipital bone and skull, which can cause bone bleeding and roughen the skull surface. If bleeding is too heavy to stop with gel foam, press on the bleeding site with clean and dry cotton swabs, and the bleeding usually stops within 5 min. If any blood spreads to the skull and generates stains, rinse the skull with saline and wipe with dry cotton swabs after bleeding stops to remove bloodstains. If bleeding continues for more than 20 min and cannot be slowed down, terminate the surgery and exclude the animal from the experiment.\nWipe the skull to remove any remaining soft tissues with cotton swabs soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide.",
    "Wait ∼5 min to dry the dorsal skull. The skull should become whiter and less transparent as it dries (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E for the comparison between dry and moisturized skulls). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nCritical: Cyanoacrylate glue becomes opaque when encountering a wet surface. Make sure the skull is dry before continuing. If the drying is too slow, gently blow the skull with a compressed air duster to facilitate drying and ensure dryness. Do not blow too hard, as a strong airflow may detach the skin around the cuts and cause bleeding near the retro-orbital sinus.\nFill the gap between muscles and the occipital bone.\nGently remove the gel foam between muscles and the occipital bone with forceps.\nApply small drops of cyanoacrylate glue to cover the muscles and the occipital bone (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F, the area encompassed by the black dashed line. Note that the area shows high gloss when covered with cyanoacrylate glue).\nAfter the cyanoacrylate glue cures, add drops of dental acrylic cement with a double-end carver to build a thick layer on top of the glue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nApply cyanoacrylate glue with a double-end carver to cover the skin along the cuts (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, indicated by yellow arrowheads). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nImplant the headbar.\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue to the interparietal bone (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, marked by the black dashed ellipse).\nPlace the headbar ∼0.5–1 mm posterior to the lambda.\nAdjust the angle of the headbar by eyeballing until it is parallel to the transverse plane of the skull (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H, the top side of the headbar and the transverse plane of the skull are marked by yellow dashed lines).\nHold the headbar in place until it stays steady.",
    "Critical: Placing the headbar parallel to the transverse plane of the skull is important to reduce distortion in imaging and help alignment across mice. It also keeps the mice in a more comfortable posture during imaging.\nSecure the headbar.\nAdd drops of cyanoacrylate glue through the holes on the headbar to build a glue layer between the headbar and cement (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I, left, indicated by the yellow shading area).\nAfter the glue cures, apply dental acrylic cement with a double-end carver around the headbar to build up the attachment between bones and the headbar. Make sure the bones posterior to the lambda are entirely covered. Embed the middle part of the headbar in cement to secure the headbar further (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I, middle and right). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nLet the dental acrylic cement cure.\nCritical: Applying enough cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic cement is important to firmly fix the headbar onto the skull in living mice due to the small interface between the headbar and the skull. Otherwise, the headbar may detach from the skull during imaging.\nBuild a thin cyanoacrylate glue layer on the skull.\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue to the skull over the dorsal cortex and evenly distribute it using a double-end carver to form a thin layer covering the entire skull.\nWait for the cyanoacrylate glue to cure to form a solid, smooth, and transparent layer. Curing usually takes ∼5 min.\nRepeat step 13 3–4 times. The skull should gradually become more transparent within 20 min, and the brain blood vessels should become clearly visible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J, compare with the dry skull in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]\nCritical: Applying small amounts of glue multiple times is more efficient than applying a large amount at once as the curing requires moisture in the air.",
    "Critical: If bleeding starts after applying cyanoacrylate glue and spreads, carefully drill off the glue with a dental drill (Midwest Tradition) after the glue layer cures. To avoid overheating during drilling, stop every 30 s to let the surface cool down and blow with a compressed air duster to facilitate cooling. Next, blow off the debris with a compressed air duster and reapply cyanoacrylate glue to form a smooth and transparent layer.\nCut a chunk (∼5 mm) of black heat shrink tube (∼2 cm diameter) and glue it to the circumference of the skull using cyanoacrylate glue. Then fill the gap between the heat shrink tube and mouse head with black dental acrylic cement from the outside (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K). This is to minimize the entry of the excitation light (blue light, ∼485 nm) to the eyes during imaging.\nNote: There are different colors of the dental acrylic cement powder, but the black one is most effective in blocking the light. If you do not have black dental acrylic cement powder in hand, use the least transparent powder you have. After the cement cures, cover it with a layer of black electrical tape or paint it with black marker pens to help block the light.\nCritical: Do not let black dental acrylic cement flow onto the transparent glue layer on the dorsal skull to avoid blocking the imaging field of view.",
    "Critical: Exposure to the excitation blue light for wide-field calcium imaging can cause retinal damage, especially after frequent imaging or a single long imaging session (e.g., 3 h) (Nakamura et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). In addition, when imaging is performed in alternating blocks (e.g., 5-min on and 5-min off), the light onset may activate the visual cortex and complicate the interpretation of activity. Therefore, it is critical to minimize the entry of the excitation blue light to the eyes.\nInject Buprenorphine for pain relief (0.1 mg/kg of body weight) and Baytril to prevent infection (10 mg/kg of body weight) subcutaneously.\nAfter the dental acrylic cement in step 15 is cured, take the mouse off from the nose cone and monitor it as it recovers from anesthesia.\nCheck the optical clarity of the skull-intact preparation frequently after the surgery. The window should stay clear for months when no infection occurs. In our experience, the preparation of most animals can stay clear for at least 2 months. The longest experiment we have performed lasted 10 weeks and the preparation stayed clear throughout the experiment.\nCritical: Although rare, infection can still happen within the first week after surgery. If the preparation appears cloudy and yellow due to infection in the skull, inject a mixture of Baytril (10 mg/kg of body weight) and Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight) subcutaneously for consecutive 3–5 days to stop infection and reduce inflammation. If the infection continues or the preparation does not become clear for imaging, terminate the experiment of this animal and exclude it from the study.\nWide-field calcium imaging in living mice\nTiming: 30 min to 3 h\nThis section describes the steps of wide-field calcium imaging through the skull-intact preparation in living mice.\nPrepare the imaging setup.",
    "Turn on the imaging light source (HXP 200 C, Zeiss), the microscope (Axio Zoom.V16 equipped with an objective lens (1 ×, 0.25 NA, FWD 56 mm), Zeiss), and the camera (ORCA-Flash4.0, Hamamatsu). The filter set for imaging GCaMP signals is commercially installed in the microscope. It consists of a bandpass filter for the excitation light (485 ± 17 nm), a beamsplitter (500 nm), and a tunable bandpass filter centered at 520 nm for the emission light.\nOpen the HCImage Live software (Hamamatsu). Set frame size to 512 × 512 pixels and frame rate to 30 Hz.\nNote: The pixel number and frame rate vary depending on the experimental design and the kinetics of the indicator. For imaging GCaMP signals, frame size is often between 512 × 512 to 1024 × 1024 pixels, and frame rate is in a range of 15–60 Hz.\nPrepare the mouse for imaging.\nFix the mouse to the stage under the microscope through the headbar.\nClean the window surface with cotton swabs soaked in 70% ethanol.\nChoose the field of view (FOV).\nAdjust the position of the stage to place the cortex in the center of the FOV (∼11 mm × 11 mm).\nAdjust the height of the objective until the blood vessels are in focus. Due to the curvature of the cortex, the lateral blood vessels around the edges will be out of focus and appear blurry (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, middle).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1195-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Wide-field calcium imaging in the transgenic mouse with a broad expression of GCaMP6s in cortical excitatory neurons",
    "(A) Left, imaging setup. Middle, an example field of view showing the fluorescence signal from most of the dorsal cortex. Note that the lateral blood vessels around the edges are out of focus and appear blurry due to the curvature of the cortex. Right, cortical regions (based on the mouse brain atlas from the Allen Institute (Wang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26])) simultaneously recorded by wide-field calcium imaging. Orange dashed box represents the area within the FOV. M2, Secondary motor cortex; M1, primary motor cortex; S1, primary somatosensory cortex; PPC, posterior parietal cortex; S2, secondary somatosensory cortex; Aud., auditory cortex; RSC, retrosplenial cortex; Vis., visual cortex.\n(B) Example image frames of cortex-wide activity (Δf/f) showing different patterns and activity traces of individual pixels in a behaving mouse. Not that the activation in small cortical areas can be resolved by wide-field calcium imaging. Gray dashed lines indicate the time of image frames in activity traces of example pixels.\nAdapted from Ren and Komiyama (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]. Scale bars in (A), 5 mm, in (B), for image frames, 2 mm, for activity traces, veritical, 0.1 Δf/f, horizontal, 10 s.\nCritical: Minimize the power of excitation light during this process to avoid photobleaching of GCaMP signals.\nAdjust the power of the excitation light (blue light, ∼485 nm for imaging GCaMP signals). To avoid saturation, the brightest pixels (usually located in the retrosplenial cortex) are usually around 50–60% of the full dynamic range. For imaging GCaMP6s in cortical excitatory neurons, the light power is ∼10–20 mW to achieve a good signal quality without inducing significant photobleaching.",
    "Optional: During repeated imaging, we use the average frame from the first imaging session as a reference and align the FOV in the following imaging sessions to this reference image based on landmarks (e.g., blood vessels, small bright spots on dental acrylic cement) through eyeballing. The x–y location can be aligned by adjusting the position of the stage as in step 21. No precise x–y alignment is required during image acquisition, as small misalignments will be corrected by the offline image registration (see ‘image registration across sessions within the same mouse[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.2]’ section for details). The z depth can be aligned by adjusting the height of the objective until the blood vessels show similar clarity as the reference image.\nNote: With a power of 10–20 mW, the imaging depth is down to ∼200 μm, covering cortical layer 1 and shallow layer 2/3. As the light intensity decays quickly during the propagation in brain tissue (decreasing to 50% at ∼100 μm and 10% at ∼200 μm) (Yizhar et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]), the majority of signals likely come from layer 1.\nNote: To minimize potential photobleaching due to repeated imaging in longitudinal studies, imaging can be performed with a certain duty cycle and increase intervals between imaging sessions. Here we provide our imaging schedule as a reference for repeated imaging: imaging is performed with a 50% duty cycle (5-min on and 5-min off) for ∼30 min every other day for a 22-day behavior task (11 imaging days in total).\nSet the acquisition to internal or external trigger mode in HCImage Live software based on the experiments and start imaging acquisition.",
    "Note: Under the internal mode, the image acquisition is controlled by HCImage Live software and independent of external triggers. The internal mode is used when no alignment or synchronization is required between imaging and other recordings, such as imaging spontaneous cortical activity.\nNote: Under the external trigger mode, the image acquisition is controlled by external devices through TTL. It is suitable when imaging needs to be synchronized to behavior recordings or other recording modalities, such as imaging cortex-wide activity during task performance or simultaneous recording with electrophysiology."
