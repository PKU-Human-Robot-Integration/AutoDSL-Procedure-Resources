    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nZona pellucida removal and embryo fixation\nTiming: 30 min\nRemoving the zona pellucida of preimplantation embryos facilitates cell lysis and nuclei permeabilization to the different enzymes.\nTreat the embryos with Tyrode acidic solution for 1–2 min to remove the zona pellucida.\nNote: Changing the embryos from drop to drop of 50 μL of Tyrode acidic solution on a 35mm dish makes the process quicker. In this part of the protocol, a mouth or hand micropipette should be used for preimplantation embryos handling and it is necessary to work under a stereomicroscope.\nWash the embryos three times with M2 medium by changing them from drop to drop of 30 μL on a 35mm dish.\nFix the embryos in 500 μL of 2% formaldehyde in a 4-well dish for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Formaldehyde is toxic and it should be handled in a fume hood and discarded according to local regulations. Around 20–30 blastocysts can be fixed in the same well.\nAdd 30 μL of Glycine solution 2 M (final concentration of 0.120 M Glycine) to quench the cross-linking and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nNote: Store 2 M Glycine solution at 20°C–25°C for one year.\nWash briefly the embryos in 500 μL of PBS 1X in a 4-well dish and then transfer each embryo individually into a clean microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: When transfering the embryos try to use the smallest possible volume.\nCritical: From now on use only DNA low-binding tubes.\nCell lysis and restriction enzyme digestion\nTiming: 16–20 h\nThe following steps prepare the nuclei for chromatin digestion.\nIncubate the embryos on ice in 100 μL of freshly prepared ice-cold lysis buffer for 30 min with occasional mixing by tapping.",
    "Centrifuge 5 min at 900 g at 4°C, discard the supernatant carefully with a hand pipette, briefly wash the single embryo with 100 μL of cold 1X Cutsmart (or 1X NEBuffer2) and centrifuge again.\nCritical: The individual embryos cannot be seen by eye, be extremely careful when discarding the supernatant.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 900 g at 4°C, discard the supernatant carefully and add 20 μL of 0.5% SDS in 1X Cutsmart or 1X NEBuffer2 (0.5 μL of 20% SDS (v/v) in 19.5 μL of 1X Cutsmart or 1X NEBuffer2). Incubate at 65°C for 10 min.\nCritical: The individual embryos cannot be seen by eye, be extremely careful when discarding the supernatant.\nPlace the tubes on ice and add 40 μL of 1X Cutsmart (or 1X NEBuffer2) and 12 μL of 10% Triton X-100 to quench the SDS (final concentration of 1.7% Triton X-100). Incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nAdd 125 U of MboI and incubate for 16–18 h at 37°C in constant agitation in a microcentrifuge tube thermomixer.\nOptional: Next morning, add 50 U of MboI and incubate for additional 2 h at 37°C in constant agitation.\nEnd-repair and labeling\nTiming: 2 h\nBiotin-labeling of the overhang ends before ligation permits the selection of the informative DNA fragments before library generation.\nAdd 10 μL of repair and labeling mix to the same tubes from step 10 containing the single embryo samples and incubate at 37°C for 90 min with occasional mixing by tapping.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2659-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. End-repair and labeling strategy",
    "Digestion by MboI generates 5′ overhangs (5′ GATC 3′) that are filled in by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in presence of dNTPs to produce blunt ends. For biotin labeling dATP is replaced by biotinylated ATP (Biotin-14-dATP) in the end-repair reaction. In this case, Biotin-14-dCTP is not recommended as the labeling of the last positions of the overhang could interfere with the posterior ligation of the blunt ends.\nNote: The biotinylated nucleotide used in the repair and labeling mix should be compatible with the sequence of the overhang generated by the restriction enzyme used in the digestion step. Labeling of the last positions of the overhang is not recommended since it could interfere with the ligation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_4.csv\nIncubate at 65°C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme.\nIn-nuclei ligation and reverse crosslinking\nTiming: 1.5 days\nIn the following steps, proximity ligation takes place and chimeric DNA fragments are generated.\nCentrifuge the nuclei at 900 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 120 μL of Ligation mix to each sample.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_5.csv\nNote: Ligase activity can be measured as cohesive-ends (CEU) units or Weiss units (U) depending on the manufacturer. T4 DNA ligase activity from New England Biolabs used in this protocol refers to cohesive-ends unit.\nIncubate at 16°C for 16–18 h in a water bath.\nCentrifuge at 900 g during 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant and add 50 μL of 1X Cutsmart (or 1X NEBuffer2).\nAdd 1 μL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K and incubate for 16–18 h at 65°C to reverse the cross-link.\nPause point: the samples can be stored at −20°C for several weeks.\nHi-C library preparation\nTiming: 1.5-2 days\nThe following steps are performed to immobilize biotinylated DNA fragments for purification and sample preparation/amplification for paired-end sequencing.",
    "Purification of Hi-C DNA with magnetic beads.\nNote: All the steps are carried out at 20°C–25°C.\nTransfer 20 μL of magnetic Streptavidin T1 beads (per single embryo Hi-C sample) to a new DNA low-binding 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Thoroughly mix the magnetic beads to obtain a homogenous suspension.\nPlace the beads suspension on a magnet for 1 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and add 50 μL of fresh 1X BB + 0.05% Tween 20 (vol/vol).\nGently tap the tube to resuspend the beads.\nCollect the suspension at the bottom of tube by centrifugation (30 s at 900 g).\nSeparate the beads on a magnet for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat step 16b once.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and resuspend the beads in 60 μL of 2X BB.\nNote: Prepare fresh 2X BB every time and keep it at 4°C.\nTransfer 60 μL of the beads suspension to each tube containing the Hi-C material and gently tap the tube to mix.\nCritical: Avoid pipetting! DNA is very dilute and prone to get stuck to pipette tips.\nIncubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C on a rotation wheel.\nCollect the suspension at the bottom of the tube by centrifugation (30 s at 900 g).\nSeparate the beads on a magnet (1 min) and discard the supernatant.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X BB.\nNote: Prepare fresh 1X BB and keep it at 4°C for one week.\nCollect the suspension at the bottom of the tube by centrifugation (30 s at 900 g).\nSeparate the beads on a magnet (1 min) and discard the supernatant.",
    "Remove the tube from the magnetic stand and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of Elution buffer (EB).\nNote: Prepare fresh EB and keep it at 4°C for one week.\nEnzymatic DNA fragmentation.\nCollect the suspension at the bottom of tube by centrifugation (30 s at 900 g), separate the beads on a magnet for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 50 μL of AluI digestion mix gently by tapping.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_6.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 1–1.5 h in constant agitation in a microcentrifuge tube thermomixer.\nPreparation of libraries for sequencing.\nPlace the samples on a magnet, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X BB.\nPlace the samples on a magnet, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X EB.\nPlace the samples on a magnet, remove supernatant and resuspend the beads in 50 μL of A-tailing mix by tapping gently.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_7.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min in constant agitation in a microcentrifuge tube thermomixer.\nSeparate on a magnet, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X BB.\nSeparate on a magnet, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X EB.\nSeparate on a magnet, remove the supernatant remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 50 μL of adapter ligation mix by pipetting gently.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_8.csv\nNote: Ligation can be left till 16 hours at 20°C–25°C if needed.\nCritical: Sequencing adaptor dilution is essential for reducing adaptor-dimer formation.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nAdd 2 μL of USER enzyme and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nNote: USER (Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent) enzyme is used to cleavage the NEBNext hairpin loop adaptor as part of multiplex library preparation for Next Generation Sequencing on the Illumina platform.",
    "Separate on a magnet, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X BB.\nSeparate on a magnet, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X EB.\nLibrary amplification and purification.\nSeparate on magnet the beads and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 50 μL of Amplification mix by pipetting gently and transfer the mix to a 0.2 mL PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_9.csv\nNote: Different indexed primers allow multiplexing of single embryo libraries for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Multiplexing of NGS samples makes possible to pool multiple libraries into a single flow cell lane. Each of the indexed primers contains a unique barcode sequence that is used to identify the libraries after sequencing.\nAmplify the library by PCR:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2659_10.csv\nAt the end of the PCR reaction, separate the beads on a magnet and transfer the supernatant containing the PCR products to a new DNA low-binding tube. Discard the beads.\nTo purify the library and remove dimers of primers mix the PCR products with 45 μL of AMPure XP beads (0.9x), mix by pipetting and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nCritical: pre-warm AMPure XP beads at 20°C–25°C previously for proper efficiency of purification. For convenience, make an aliquot in advance and keep it at 20°C–25°C.\nSeparate the beads on a magnet for 5 min, discard the supernatant and, while attached to the magnet, wash them with 200 μL of fresh EtOH 70% at 20°C–25°C without mixing.\nLeave the beads settled on the magnet, remove EtOH and repeat washing with 200 μL of EtOH 70%.\nNote: Prepare fresh EtOH 70% and use it at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the EtOH and allow the remaining EtOH to evaporate at 20°C–25°C for 5–10 min.\nNote: It is important not to over-dry the beads.",
    "Add 50 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, mix by gently pipetting and incubate 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nSeparate the beads on a magnet and transfer the supernatant containing the purified library into a new DNA low-binding tube. Discard the beads.\nNote: It is important not to disturb the beads pellet with the pipette tip to avoid transferring of beads together with the supernatant.\nAdd again 45 μL of AMPure XP beads (0.9x) to the supernatant, mix by pipetting and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nNote: A second round of AMPure XP beads purification is needed to avoid adaptor- and primer-dimers.\nRepeat steps 19 f–h.\nAdd 12 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, mix by gently pipetting and incubate 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nSeparate the beads on a magnet and transfer the supernatant containing the purified library into a new DNA low-binding tube. Discard the beads.\nPause point: Purified libraries can be stored at −20°C for several months.\nLibrary quality control.\nUse 2 μL of the library for its quantification using a Qbit fluorometer.\nNote: A good yield for a single blastocyst Hi-C library would be between 0.1-0.6 ng/μL. Higher concentration of the library is not always indicative of better quality.\nConfirm the range of fragment sizes of the libraries by running a High-Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer (or equivalent).\nNote: The range size of the DNA fragments should be between 200-800 bp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nLibrary sequencing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2659-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

LM: Lower Marker; UM: Upper Marker.\nSingle blastocyst Hi-C libraries should be sequenced at 5–10 million paired-end reads depth with a read length of 50–100 pb.",
    "Note: The reagents used for library preparation are compatible with Illumina sequencing system.\nSingle embryo Hi-C library genotyping and data processing\nTiming: 2–3 days\nTo optimize the number of libraries generated, we have performed Hi-C in blastocysts from the cross of Ctcffl/−; Zp3-Cretg/+ females with Ctcffl/− males, which will generate an offspring with 50% of Ctcf mutant embryos.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] We also included wild-type embryos (CD-1) as controls.\nFor genotyping on sequence, we considered as mutants those embryos whose libraries contained no reads in the 22 kb of the deleted region (mm10 chr8:105662421-105684451), using other two random regions of the same size (mm10 chr8:122710142-122732172 and chr8:75657421-75679451) as a control. Heterozygous embryos should show half number of reads than wild-type embryos at the deleted region (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2659-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Adapted with permission from Andreu et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Cell Press Publishing Group.\nNote: Libraries with less than 1 million sequencing reads were excluded to ensure the accuracy of the genotyping.\nFor data analysis, we used TADbit4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and assess read quality control, read mapping, interaction detection, interaction filtering, and matrix normalization. We followed these steps:",
    "Apply FastQC protocol to discard artifacts and map the remaining reads to the reference mouse genome (mm10).\nDiscard non-informative contacts including self-circles, dangling-ends, errors, random breaks and duplicates to obtain the valid reads.\nValid pairs from single embryo libraries with the same genotype were merged for the analysis.\nNote: We merged around 13 single blastocyst libraries per genotype to perform the subsequent analysis.\nAs the number of total valid reads can differ among conditions, merged experiments with higher number of reads should be subsampled to have similar number of total reads in all the conditions for a better comparison.\nNote: There are many other softwares available for processing Hi-C data such as HiC Pro,7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] HiCUP8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] and FAN-C9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] among others."
