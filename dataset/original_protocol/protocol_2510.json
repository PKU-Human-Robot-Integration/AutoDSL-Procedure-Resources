    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfection of cells: Day 1\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step involves transfection of the cultured cells with the required DNA construct (a FLAG-tagged protein in this case). The protocol can be modified for other tagged proteins.\nTransfect the cells in four T75 flasks with the required DNA construct using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent.\nNote: The DNA: Lipofectamine ratio is determined by the cell number and the manufacturer recommended protocol can be followed for transfection. The DNA: P3000: Lipofectamine ratio was 1μg DNA: 2 μL P3000: 1.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000. 35 μg DNA was transfected/T75 flask with 70 μL P3000 and 52.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000.\nIncubate the cells at 25°C for 72h before initiating starvation.\nCritical: All the steps must be performed in a biosafety cabinet under completely sterile conditions.\nTransfer of cells to starvation; day 4\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step involves starvation of the transfected Kc167 cells for a period of 8 h. Since Kc167 is a suspension cell line the cells will have to be spun down and resuspended in the appropriate medium for the experiment (for adherent cells this might not be required).\nAfter 72h, transfer the cells from two of the T75 flasks (30 mL) to a single 50mL falcon tube.\nLabel the tube as ‘Complete’. Similarly, transfer and label the cells from two other flasks as ‘Starvation’.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 ×g for 5 min at room temperature (25°C) in a benchtop centrifuge.\nAspirate the Complete medium from both the falcon tubes.\nResuspend the cell pellet gently in one falcon tube (labeled as 'Complete’) in 30 mL of CCM3 and the cell pellet in other falcon tube (labeled as 'Starvation’) in 30 mL of 2mg/mL glucose.",
    "Transfer 15mL from each falcon tube to two new T75 flasks. Keep the flasks for 8 h under this condition.\nNote: It is important to spin down cells that are to be kept under complete medium (for 8 h) and resuspend them into fresh medium along with the cells subjected to starvation. This medium is to be collected for exosome isolation and hence the time given for exosome enrichment in both cases should be equal.\nCollection and concentration of conditioned medium and lysis of cells; day 4\nTiming: 1 h\nAfter 8 h of starvation, transfer the cells in CCM3 (complete medium) and 2 mg/mL glucose (starvation medium) to two 50 mL falcon tubes. Each falcon tube will have 30 mL of cells resuspended in the medium.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 ×g for 10 min at room temperature (25°C) in a benchtop centrifuge.\nTransfer the medium (30 mL) from both the conditions to new 50 mL falcon tubes and label appropriately. Keep the tubes on ice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5mL ice-cold PBS and centrifuge the cells at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nLyse the cells using 100–200μL of the cold lysis buffer (Phospho Safe Extraction reagent with Benzonase at a concentration of 250U per mL of lysis buffer) by pipetting up and down several times. Sonication is not required for lysis. Incubate the samples on ice for 20 min.\nStore the whole cell lysate at −80°C until immunoblotting or centrifuge at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the clarified lysate to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and stored on ice for later use.",
    "Note: Alternative Lysis buffers with required proteinase inhibitors can also be utilized for this step. We utilized Phospho Safe Extraction reagent for cell lysis as this buffer can be efficiently used both for cell lysis and maintaining the proteins in their phosphorylated state. It has a cocktail of four phosphatase inhibitors- sodium fluoride, sodium vanadate, β-glycerophosphate, and sodium pyrophosphate along with a proprietary lysis buffer.\nThe conditioned medium (from step 5b) in 50mL falcon tube is centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4°C to remove any remaining cells and debris.\nGently transfer the supernatant avoiding any pelleted debris or residual cells using a 10 mL serological pipet to a new 50mL falcon tube.\nTransfer 15mL of the exosome containing medium into the reservoir of a 15mL 3KDa Amicon centrifugal filter.\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,950 ×g until 150 μL sample remains.\nRepeat steps 8 and 9 for the remaining 15 mL supernatant.\nDiscard the flow through and transfer the concentrated medium from ‘Complete’ and ‘Starvation’ centrifugal filter reservoir to prelabeled microcentrifuge tubes.\nCritical: All the centrifugation steps must be performed at 4°C to avoid degradation of RNA and protein.\nValidation of exosomes in the concentrated media by dynamic light scattering analysis; day 4\nTiming: 3–5 min per sample\nThe size of the exosomes in the conditioned medium or purified exosomal fractions can be determined by several methods including Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Electron microscopy (EM), Flow cytometry, Atomic Force microscopy (AFM), Resistive pulse sensing, and Dynamic light Scattering (DLS).",
    "In this protocol we utilized a Zetasizer Nano to validate the presence of exosomes in the concentrated medium. The Zetasizer system determines the particle size by measuring the Brownian motion of the particle in a sample by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) followed by interpretation of the size. The collected fractions can be concentrated for particle analysis using an Amicon ultrafiltration device.\nNote: It is advisable to make 3–4 dilutions of the conditioned medium (complete and starvation) before starting the DLS analysis. Highly concentrated or highly diluted samples will likely cause errors in the estimation and the result will not be as desired. According to the Zetasizer nano manual, for particle sizes between 100 nm to 1 μm the concentration of a sample can be as low as 0.01 mg/mL. The maximum concentration largely depends upon whether the particles tend to aggregate at a high concentration and cause multiple scattering. For exosomes a range of 0.1mg/mL to 1 mg/mL can be tested and the best scattering profile can be chosen. For this protocol, the best profile was obtained at 0.5 mg/mL out of three concentrations (0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 1.5 mg/mL). Additionally, the samples should be kept on ice throughout the experiment.\nThe protocol here refers to the use of Zetasizer Nano (ZS90) instrument for DLS analysis. Different instruments can have variations in the operating procedure and thus respective manuals are to be referred. First, turn on the instrument and open the Zetasizer Nano ZS 90 software.\nPlace around 100 μL of the sample to be analyzed in a quartz cuvette compatible with the instrument and place it in the instrument holder.\nOn the computer start the software, choose the option particle size analysis.",
    "Set-up the required parameters like refractive index and absorption of the material to be analyzed and which solution it is dispersed into.\nNote: In this protocol the solution was dispersed in 1×PBS, and PBS is a preset option in the machine with a refractive index of 1.338. Based on the manufacturer’s website, the recommended refractive index (RI) and absorption (k) values suggested for exosomes are 1.37–1.39 and 0.01, respectively (https://www.materials-talks.com/faq-how-important-are-refractive-index-absorption-for-nanoparticles/[href=https://www.materials-talks.com/faq-how-important-are-refractive-index-absorption-for-nanoparticles/]). Set up the number of measurements required (anywhere between 3–5).\nStart the analysis. The software will take some time to adjust the temperature and other conditions.\nObtain a graph between the size of particles (in nm) and intensity (representing how abundant they are in the sample).\nNote: The particles that are the most abundant in the sample will have the sharpest and strongest peak. For exosome this peak is anywhere between 100–200 nm of size.\nAfter one measurement rinse the cuvette with milliQ water and repeat for other samples.\nWhen the run is complete, click on an individual run and go to the intensity option on the software. This will show the graph for that run.\nGo to the Edit option and select ‘copy graph’ or ‘copy raw values’.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2143-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Lower density of cells results in higher cell death upon starvation (compare E and F).

Particle size analysis of the conditioned concentrated CCM3 and starvation medium collected from Kc167 cells using a Zetasizer nano system\nDynamic light scattering analysis was performed on conditioned medium collected from Kc167 cells in complete and starvation medium.\nNote: The graph obtained can be directly used or the raw values of size and intensity can be used to plot our own graphs using a software like Microsoft excel or Graph Pad Prism (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nIsolation of exosomes; day 4\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step involves isolation of exosomes from concentrated cell media by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using columns available from Izon (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Other alternatives that can be used for purification of exosomes by SEC include Sephacryl S-500 columns, Sepharose CL-4B/2B columns, miniPURE-EV columns, Exo-spin mini-columns and Sephacryl S-1000 columns. The exosomes that are larger in size are eluted first compared to proteins which are eluted in later fractions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2143-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A flowchart depicting the steps involved in exosome purification using size exclusion chromatography\nEquilibrate two pre-labeled Izon qEV/35nm single-use columns (optimum for the isolation of RNA) with 150μL 1× PBS (at a temperature of 18°C–25°C) and load the concentrated ‘Complete’ and ‘Starvation’ medium onto the column (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2143-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. A gel-filtration column for the isolation of exosomes from concentrated conditioned media\nCollect the Buffer volume (1mL) and discard.\nCollect 100 μL fractions (10–15) in pre-labeled microcentrifuge tubes. The exosomes elute in the 2nd and 3rd fractions.",
    "Measure the absorbance of the collected fractions at 600 nm (for exosomes) and 280 nm (for proteins).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2143-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Elution profile of vesicles with 100 μL of concentrated conditioned medium loaded\nOD600nm (blue line) and OD280nm (red line) was measured for each of the 100 μL fractions. The peak corresponding to the vesicles occurred at 200μL after void volume (1,000μL). The protein fraction eluted in later fractions (Fraction 30–34).\nNote: When absorbance values are plotted as a graph two separate peaks will be obtained- one for extracellular vesicles and one for proteins (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The elute that shows a peak at 600 nm is likely to be a pure exosomal fraction.\nThe exosome fractions can be used for downstream applications.\nCritical: Incubate the columns at room temperature before starting the purification. Air bubbles can be introduced in the columns if columns removed from 4°C and applying PBS at room temperature. These introduced air bubbles can result in poor separation.\nValidation of exosomes by immunoblot analysis; day 5 and day 6\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, the whole cell lysates and the exosome fractions isolated from Complete and Starvation medium are analyzed by Western Blot Analysis. Different exosomal markers are analyzed in the fractions purified from the two nutrient conditions.\nEstimate the protein amount in the whole cell lysates and purified exosomes using the Bradford assay.\nAdd 6× sample buffer after normalizing the concentrations for all the samples.\nDenature the samples by heating at 85°C for 5 min.\nLoad equal amount of protein per lane onto an SDS-PAGE gel.\nNote: The percentage of the gel will vary depending on the size of the protein under study.\nResolve the protein samples on the SDS-PAGE gel.",
    "Transfer the proteins onto a 0.45 μm pore sized PVDF membrane (charged with methanol) in a wet transfer system using the Tris Glycine transfer buffer at 4°C.\nStandardize the voltage and timing for transfer depending on the proteins of interest.\nNote: The transfer can be done for a few hours at a higher voltage or overnight at a lower voltage depending on feasibility.\nBlock the membrane in 5% skimmed milk solution prepared in 0.1% PBST (1× PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature on a rocker for 1h at 25°C.\nAfter the blocking is complete wash the membrane with 0.1% PBST 3 times (for 5 min each).\nDilute primary antibodies in 5% skimmed milk solution (according to manufacturer’s instructions) and add to the membrane. This protocol uses a FLAG-tagged protein as an example so the Anti-Flag (mouse) antibody is used at a dilution of 1: 2,500 for detection of the protein of interest.\nNote: It is essential to also perform blotting for a few proteins that are known to be associated with exosomes like cysteine string protein (Csp) and Syntaxin 1A (Syx1A). These will serve as a positive control to indicate that the eluted fractions are exosomes.\nThese antibodies can be used at the following dilution- cysteine string protein (Csp) 1:1,000 and Syntaxin 1A (Syx1A) 1:500.\nGently rock the membrane incubated with primary antibodies overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.\nNext day, wash the membrane with 0.1% PBST 3–4 times (5 min each) to remove excess of the primary antibody.\nDilute appropriate HRP- conjugated secondary antibodies (depending on primary antibodies used) in 5% skimmed milk and add to the membrane.\nRock at room temperature for 1–2 h to allow efficient binding.",
    "Wash the membrane with 0.1% PBST 4–5 times (5 min each) and proceed to develop the blot on a ChemiDoc using an appropriate ECL detection system (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2143-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Immunoblot analysis of the whole cell lysates and conditioned medium collected from complete and starvation medium\nKc167 cell lysates (CL) and conditioned media were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The immunoblot was probed with antibodies to detect expression of EV markers cysteine string protein (Csp) and Syntaxin 1A (Syx 1A) and a Flag-tagged protein.\nNote: It is also a good idea to not only load the fraction with the sharpest peak at 600 nm but a few fractions before and after the peak. This will provide a good idea about the enrichment of exosomes in the fractions and hence the best one can be chosen for further experiments. Along with the eluted fractions, equal amount of protein should also be loaded onto the SDS-PAGE for the cell lysates obtained from both the conditions (complete medium and starvation). This is to make sure the transfection is uniform in both the conditions and the protein of interest is expressed in both.
