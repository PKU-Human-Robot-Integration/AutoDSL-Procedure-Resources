    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of the mouse for the intrinsic signal imaging\nTiming: 10 min\nHere we describe ISI through the chronic cranial window of an anesthetized head-fixed mouse. The cranial window surgery can be performed following the detailed procedures described previously (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: The ISI can be performed if the brain surface is not obscured by blood (short after the surgery) or re-growing bone (long after the surgery). Usually, ISI was performed 1–2 weeks after the chronic cranial window surgery.\nNote: We used 2–3 months old C57BL6J or Ntsr1-Cre mice (both genders) since we find this age best for the long-term chronic cranial window surgery (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: As the experiment is done under anesthesia, no habituation to the setup is required.\nCritical: The recovery state of the animal after the surgery strongly affects the signal-to-noise ratio of the intrinsic signal. Even if the window quality is good, and no signs of mouse distress can be observed, we recommend waiting at least for 2–3 days after the surgery to allow recovery of the mouse. Alternatively, the procedure can be repeated after a few days if the imaging quality is not satisfying.\nCritical: The procedure and drugs should be adapted according to your IACUC approved protocol.\nWeigh the animal.\nInduce anesthesia.\nGently transfer the mouse into an anesthesia induction chamber and induce deep anesthesia with 3% isoflurane (in O2; M3000, Supera Anesthesia Innovations).\nNote: Anesthesia should induce within 1–1.5 min.",
    "Inject main anesthetics (here, mixture of Medetomidine (0.3 μg / g; dissolved in 0.9% saline), Midazolam (4 μg / g; dissolved in 0.9% saline), and Butorphanol (5 μg / g; dissolved in 0.9% saline) intraperitoneally (ip) before isoflurane wears off. See also step 6 as well as troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Anesthesia will induce within 3–5 min. Therefore, leave the mouse in its cage for 5 min for a smooth transition to deep anesthesia.\nHead-fix the mouse on the imaging stage using the headplate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nAlternatives: Researchers using an acute craniotomy or thinned bone preparation can use ear-bars instead of the headplate to immobilize the head.\nCritical: The head must not move during imaging because multiple trials must be recorded and averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: The brain surface should be positioned perpendicular to the axis of the objective lens to collect maximal amount of the reflected light and, thereby, increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCover the eyes with a drop of silicone or mineral oil (317667-5ML, Aldrich or M5904-5ML, Sigma, accordingly) to protect the cornea from drying.\nTurn-on the heating pad after inserting rectal temperature sensor. Maintain 35°C–37°C body temperature throughout the whole procedure.\nAlternatives: Tape the temperature sensor to the heating pad so that it senses the temperature between mouse and heating pad.\nCritical: Without heating pad, body temperature will drop and, as a result, the intrinsic signal will diminish. Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAdditionally apply 0.25%–1% isoflurane anesthesia (in O2) and maintain it throughout the whole imaging session.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/971-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B and C) Effect of anesthesia on hemodynamic signals: (B) Single trial recordings after intra peritoneal (ip) injection of a mixture of Medetomidine, Midazolam and Butorphanol. Notice increased hemodynamic signals that indicate waking in the 5-th trial. (C) Intrinsic signal after adding isoflurane (1%) anesthesia.\n(D) Image with the focal plane about 500 μm below the brain surface under red-light illumination.\n(E) Image of hemodynamic signal in response to visual stimulation calculated from 5 trials (B and C). Dataset from the same animal; image size 1200 × 925 pixels frame, corresponding to 4.025 × 3.14 mm.\nCritical: Isoflurane attenuates cortical neuronal activity (reviewed in Sorrenti et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22], Voss et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]), therefore should be used at low concentrations. To reduce the concentration, combine Isoflurane anesthesia with other sedatives (step 2b and Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Isoflurane helps to maintain a stable level of anesthesia (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C) but cannot prevent spontaneous contractions of the muscles of the eye and pupil. However, the ip-administered mixture of drugs (specifically, Medetomidine as α2 adrenergic agonist (see step 2b)) relaxes the muscles. This prevents spontaneous changes in pupil diameter and rolling of the eyeball occurring under pure isoflurane anesthesia. Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: The level of isoflurane anesthesia should be increased or reduced if signs of waking or too deep anesthesia, respectively, are observed to keep the anesthesia level roughly constant. See also step 17, Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nTaking the reference image\nTiming: 10 min\nClean the window with small cotton-tips moisturized with water.\nOptimize the window illumination with the white / green LED by adjusting the gooseneck light guide.\nCritical: Do not shine the bright LED light into the eyes of the mouse or experimenter.\nFocus with the camera on the brain surface using a low-magnification lens.",
    "Adjust the camera settings: center the region of interest; if applicable, adjust the active sensor size of your camera, so that no unnecessary data is acquired.\nTake the reference image of the brain surface vasculature (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCritical: Do not change the size or X and Y coordinates after the snapshot. The shift will result in a misalignment between the reference area of the brain surface and the area mapped with the intrinsic signal (see step 23).\nNote: Use the green light illumination (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) or green light pass filter in the camera light pathway for high-contrast images of the brain surface vasculature (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nIntrinsic signal imaging and initial data processing\nTiming: 30–50 min\nFocus 400–600 μm below the brain surface.\nCritical: Lowering the focal plane is required to minimize the intrinsic signal mediated by the large vasculature on the brain surface, which interferes with the intrinsic signal of the neuronal tissue. See also step 17 and Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nTurn off the white / green LED light source and remove the green filter from the light path (if used).\nOptimize cortical illumination with the high-power red (615–655 nm) LED light source by adjusting the gooseneck light guide (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nCritical: Wear red-light filter googles (Thorlabs) when looking at the illuminated setup (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nCritical: Make sure the high-power LED light is not directed into the eyes of the mouse or experimenter.\nCritical: Make sure that the light is not reflected from the window glass surface into the objective lens. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Some red LED light sources need time to warm up and stabilize (here, about 5–10 min). Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: The red-light illumination stays on till the end of the imaging procedure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Adjust camera settings, mainly frame rate and integration time, for highest signal-to-noise ratio. With our sCMOS camera (PCO.edge, PCO), we typically recorded 1200×950 px frames (full dynamic range 16-bit (0-65535) .tiff) at 100–195 Hz and 5 ms exposure time.\nCritical: For ISI, the expected signal is about 0.1% intensity change. Therefore, an optical noise level below 0.1% is required to detect the signal reliably. Optical noise follows Poisson statistics: If, on average, n photons are detected, then a single measurement will vary with standard deviation    n    , which is the optical noise. So, to reach a relative noise level (coefficient of variation) of less than 0.1%, more than 1,000,000 photons must be detected (    1,000,000  1,000,000  = 0.001 = 0.1 %  ). This high photon count is achieved in different cameras in different ways. Cameras with high electron well depth (typically 1,000,000 electrons per pixel; the number of collected electrons per pixel corresponds to the number of detected photons) can generate low noise images. A typical exposure time is 100 ms and a typical frame rate is 10 Hz. Cameras with low well depth (typically 50,000 electrons per pixel) must be used at higher frame rates to collect the required number of photons. A typical exposure time is 5 ms and a typical frame rate is 200 Hz. Spatial and temporal averaging during the data analysis will additionally reduce the noise. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, adjust the power of the LED light source and camera settings (e.g., the exposure time, here, 5 ms) to use the full dynamic range of the digitization (here 16-bit, corresponding to 65536 gray levels) without saturation. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: Keep the image position and number of pixels as before (reference image, step 11) for optimal alignment (step 23).",
    "Record 5–6 imaging trials. Each 5 s trial consisted of 1 s black screen, 1 s visual stimulation, and another 3 s of black screen. Each trial was preceded by a 1–2 min waiting period during which the black screen was presented (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F; see also Preparation step 2c).\nCritical: Due to the slow relaxation time course of the signal, at least 10-s inter-trial intervals must be used for a 1–2 s lasting visual stimulation (Grinvald et al., 1986[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) to avoid signal overlap of consecutive trials.\nCritical: Make sure that the trigger synchronizes the image acquisition and stimulus sequence presentation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) by using an oscilloscope.\nProcess the recorded stacks of images (here, .tiff files) using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) plugin “IO and VSD signal processor” (Harrison et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). The calculated average ratio image (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) shows stimulation induced changes in red light reflectance, as difference between the averages of baseline frames (here, recorded 1s before the stimulus onset) and averages of response frames (here, frames recorded for 1–2s, with <0.5 s delay after stimulus onset). Using the plugin, we filtered the images (1200×950 px at 195 Hz) with 20 pixel sigma Gaussian in x and y, and ± 10 voxel average in z.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/971-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Absence of response indicates too high anesthesia, while blood vessel patterns (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, right) indicate too low levels of anesthesia. Change the concentration of isoflurane accordingly. Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAlternatives: The user can choose any suitable software packages or custom-written algorithms for the processing of the recorded images and calculate stimulation induced changes in red light reflectance.\nOptional step: Record additional trials. The expected intrinsic optical signal is about 0.1%, spatially localized with about 100 μm resolution, and has a rise time of > 1s (Grinvald et al., 1986[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Thus, the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased by averaging trials and spatio-temporal filtering. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nOptional step: Record additional trials after switching from visual stimulation to somatosensory stimulation (here, deliver air-puff to the whisker pad during imaging trials (Preparation step 2b and 2c; Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1G)) to map the barrel field of primary somatosensory cortex (BF, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The V1 and BF trials (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C, accordingly) should be processed separately and images of averaged responses overlayed during offline data processing for mapping of HVAs and posterior parietal cortex (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/971-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

These outlines can be used for overlays as shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F–3H and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D.",
    "Adjust the signal image to a threshold for the color map, to project the functional area of V1 on the image of the brain surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Our definition of the threshold is based on the peak of the intensity histogram (smoothed by 10-point box filter) of the signal ROI (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The threshold is chosen as the half of the intensity value of that peak.\nPause point: 1 day – n weeks as needed.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Linked to step 21.\nPreparation for the injection through the access port of the chronic cranial window\nTiming: 20–30 min\nIn the following steps, we describe the procedure of viral vector injection through the access port of the chronic cranial window into layer 6 of V1 in an anesthetized, head-fixed mouse. This procedure can follow ISI or be performed separately, for example, for drug or dye injections (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Roome and Kuhn, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16], Roome and Kuhn, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Roome and Kuhn, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). In this case, inspect the area of interest with two-photon microscope (MOM, Sutter Instrument) before the injection.\nNote: The injection time is restricted by the quality of the cranial window only. If necessary, it can be performed a few days, weeks, or even months after the chronic cranial window surgery if the window is not obscured by blood or re-growing bone.\nAnesthetize and head-fix the mouse.\nGently transfer the mouse into an anesthesia induction chamber and induce deep anesthesia with 3% isoflurane.\nNote: Anesthesia should induce within 1–1.5 min.\nHead-fix the mouse on the imaging stage using the headplate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).",
    "Apply 0.5%–1% isoflurane anesthesia and maintain it throughout the whole procedure.\nConnect the microinjection pipette to the manometer and mount it on the micromanipulator.\nPosition the beveled side of the pipette-tip sideways or upwards (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Otherwise, the pipette might slide or bend and fail to penetrate the silicon of the access port or the dura. Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nMeasure the mounting angle of the pipette and micromanipulator settings for the angle of the diagonal movement direction. The angles must be set the same. For the selection of the angle see step 26e.\nCritical: The pipette will cause damage in the brain tissue if the mounting and diagonal movement angles are different. Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nCheck the trajectory of the pipette (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/971-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic instruction of the targeted pipette insertion through the access port of the chronic cranial window\n(A) Pipette insertion into the injection target region. The vertical distance (d) is the sum of the cortical depth of the intended injection (a), the thickness of the glass (b), and an extra distance above the glass (c); z, the absolute value of the pipette tip position on the Z-axis; inset shows the magnified view of the microinjection pipette tip (scale bar, 100 μm).\n(B) Three pipette trajectories aiming for the same target region. Only the black trajectory allows successful insertion.\n(C) Three pipette trajectories aiming at different targets by changing the access angle. Gray crosses indicate edges of the access port.\nCritical: This trial run is important to test if there is any sterical hindrance. If this step is skipped, the delays might occur in step 28.",
    "Critical: The access port of the chronic cranial window must be in a place which allows sterically to reach the target. This horizontal distance must be calculated with the tangent formula from the access angle and the target depth. The diameter of the access port (typically, about 1mm) can act as a ruler when positioning the window during the surgery. A 1-mm access port gives some flexibility to reach the target, but not much (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Alternatively, the shape of the access port can be changed, or diameter can be increased. It takes some experience and testing to find the optimal arrangement. Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nDefine the central point of your injection target on the surface of the cranial window. Move the pipette to that point and zero the coordinates (z1 in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A–6C).\nCalculate the distance d = a+b+c, where (a) is a depth of your intended injection in the brain, (b) is the thickness of the window glass and (c) is the distance above the window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). For labeling layer 6 in the mouse primary visual cortex (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]I; (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])), we used (a) 950 μm cortical depth, (b) 170 μm thick glass for the cranial window and (c) 380 μm distance above the glass (380 μm was chosen for convenience, to get d = 1500 μm). Lift the pipette by the distance c and zero the coordinates again (z2 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nCritical: We recommend choosing the distance c of a few hundred μm to prevent damage of the pipette-tip during the procedure. Without this distance the pipette might hit the obstacle and break the tip (see step 26d and Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).",
    "Switch to the diagonal movement mode and retract the pipette so that it is lifted by distance d (z3 = |d| in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nSwitch back to the regular, orthogonal movement mode of the manipulator and lower the pipette by distance d to the zero point (z4 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nCritical: The pipette might be moved far out of the visual field when retracted diagonally (step 26c). The tip might end up above the edge of the chronic cranial window or headplate and break when being lowered to zero. Also, in practice, the cranial window is never ideally parallel to the headplate. Therefore, the pipette also might break or bend (and create an error offset) if hitting the glass when lowered (Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nSwitch again to the diagonal movement mode and approach the surface of the access port (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D). Slowly move forward till the very tip penetrates the silicone. If the pipette (i) bends and slides on the port’s surface, (ii) might hit the glass (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) or (iii) a big superficial blood vessel, lift the pipette and repeat the procedure (step 26). Change the mounting / diagonal movement angle or reconsider the target if necessary. Keep in mind that steeper angles fit more for the closer (or deeper) injection sites, while more shallow angles can be selected for more distant (or shallow) injection sites (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C).\nCritical: If the silicone cannot be penetrated, the shaft of the pipette might be too flexible. Try to make pipettes with shorter shafts, bevel the tips at a steeper angle (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), or select steeper mounting / diagonal movement angle. Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].",
    "Critical: Be careful that the pipette tip does not crash into the window glass. Try to stay away from the edges of the cranial window (grey crosses in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C) because of the widening shafts of the injection pipettes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F). The pipette might hit the glass immediately with the tip or break later at the shank while lowering the pipette (27° and 39° pipettes in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Also, if the pipette shank slides along the access port edge, the pipette will bend and not reach the target area. Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nCritical: If the big superficial blood vessel will be damaged during incision, the spilled blood will spread below the window and obscure the view. This is particularly relevant for imaging experiments planned to be done soon after injection. Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nTip-fill the pipette with the viral vector containing solution.\nFree some space over the headplate by moving the pipette to the side.\nNote: There is no need to replace the pipette if its tip was not damaged during the checking of the trajectory (step 26).\nPlace a small (5×10 mm) piece of parafilm with a 2 μL droplet of AAV solution on the headplate.\nBring back the pipette to the headplate, apply weak positive pressure (10–14 hPa) and lower the pipette tip into the droplet under visual guidance (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nTip-fill the pipette with up to 300 nL of solution using negative pressure (typically −150 to −200 hPa). The volume is judged by the tick marks (made with a fine-tip water-resistant marker) on the pipette (in 0.3 mm inner diameter pipette, 1 mm corresponds to a volume of 70 nL, Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).",
    "Critical: Replace the pipette in case of clogging (remove the clogged pipette and go back to step 25; step 26 can be skipped). Try a larger tip diameter pipette and/or additional dilution with PBS.\nApply weak positive pressure (10–14 hPa) and lift the pipette up. Maintain this pressure until the injection of the solution into the brain (see step 29).\nWipe the pipette tip with a PBS-soaked sterile sponge (for example, Sugi, Questalpha).\nNote: Fluorescent particles/viral vectors outside the glass wall might label neurons/tissue along the insertion track and thus compromise the labeling and/or the imaging quality. Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nCritical: The positive pressure in step 27c and 27e and later (step 29a and 29c) is kept for counteracting the capillary effects. It prevents air or cerebrospinal fluid to tip-fill the pipette. If air is taken up, it will be injected into the brain; if cerebrospinal fluid is taken up, the viral vector solution will be diluted. On the other hand, if too high positive pressure is applied, the solution will be ejected, emptying the pipette before entering the brain, or causing strong labeling along the pipette tract in the brain. Therefore, the pressure should be adjusted depending on the viscosity of the solution as well as inner diameter of the injection pipette. Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nInjection through the access port of the chronic cranial window\nTiming: 20–30 min\nLower the pipette into the brain aiming at the target injection site (z5 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nNote: The pipette will follow the trajectory defined during step 26.\nMove the pipette to the center of your target area and zero the coordinates when the tip of the pipette touches the glass surface (z1 in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/971-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

The target region was chosen to be devoid of large blood vessels above the future imaging area.\n(C) The pipette tip located at the glass surface of the cranial window directly above the target site (z1 position in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\n(D) The pipette tip located at the silicone surface of the access port (position between z4 and z5 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\n(E) The pipette tip in the drop of the viral vector containing solution during tip-filling.\n(F) Observation of the injection speed (meniscus movement speed) and volume (marks on the pipette wall).\n(G) The pipette inserted into the brain with the tip at the estimated target site (z5 position in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\n(H) The surface of the brain immediately after pipette retraction.\n(I) The two photon reconstructions of (left) dLGN axons and retrogradely transported fluorescent beads in V1 layer 6, (middle) layer 6 corticothalamic neurons and (right) their combined image; adapted from (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Notice, that the red beads were injected into dLGN during the surgery and subsequently transported retrogradely to somata of cortical layer 6 neurons. Afterward, these neurons were co-labeled with GCaMP by targeted injection through the access port. Red cross, injection target and possible labeling area; inset, magnified areas with asterisks indicating reference points; dLGN, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.\nLift the pipette by the distance c and zero the coordinates again (z2 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nSwitch to the diagonal movement mode and retract/lift the pipette by the distance d (z3 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).",
    "Switch back to the orthogonal movement mode and lower the pipette by the distance d to the zero point (z4 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nSwitch to the diagonal movement mode and insert the pipette into the brain, moving down/forward by the distance d (z5 in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G).\nCritical: Focus on the access port and observe the penetration of the silicone, dura, and motion of the pipette till the injection site is reached (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D and 6G).\nA more rigid and/or sharper tip (steeper tip-beveling angle) or steeper penetration angle might be necessary to penetrate the dura.\nSometimes, the possibility to hit a big blood vessel becomes obvious only after penetration of the silicone, when pipette gets pushed through the dura. Also, the risk to break the pipette at the edges of the access port increases with the traveling distance (compare the sizes of the pipette shaft near the tip and at the incision point (arrows in Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6G, accordingly)). Change the angle and/or reconsider the injection site in these cases (the same virus-loaded pipette can be re-used if the tip was not damaged). Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], and problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nAlternatives: The pipette can be inserted under visual guidance, for example, using two-photon imaging, if the target is in the upper cortex and relatively close to the access port (Roome and Kuhn, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Kuhn and Roome, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Such locations require diagonal movement at a relatively shallow angle. The shallow angle is also necessary when using objective lenses with high magnification, but small working distance.\nInject the solution.\nWait for 3–5 min before the injection, allowing the tissue to seal around the pipette wall.",
    "Under visual observation of the meniscus in the pipette (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F), pressure inject (typically 35–70 hPa) about 70–100 nL of solution within 5–7 min.\nReduce the positive pressure to the initial pressure of 10–14 hPa and wait for 10 min to allow the injected solution to spread into the tissue.\nCritical: Visual observation allows the accurate control of the injection speed and the amount. Slow injection (50 nL/3–5 min) and a waiting period before and after the injection, allows the solution to spread locally at the injection site instead of going up along the outer walls of the pipette during injection or follow the pipette track during retraction. Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nSlowly and smoothly retract the pipette. Usually, the silicone of the access port seals immediately after the pipette retraction, and the damage caused by penetration is minimal (compare Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6H).\nOptional: If the viral solution was injected smoothly, the same pipette can be used for one or two other target injections."
