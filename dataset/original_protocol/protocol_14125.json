    "The study was approved by Metro South Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC-13-QPAH-551 and UQ2013001551) and the University of South Australia Human Ethics Committee (200607).\n1. Absorbent Microbiopsy Fabrication\nLaser cut microneedle parts from 50 µm medical-grade stainless steel sheet and absorbent layer (filter paper), respectively (Figure 1).\n\tNote: Other parts, including the plunger and the case, of the device are fabricated with rapid-prototyping techniques, such as 3D printing.\nSoak all the parts, except for the absorbent layer, in 70% ethanol (EtOH) for 5 min and air dry them for 30 min afterwards.\nAssemble the three-layer microneedle, with the absorbent layer in the middle (Figure 1a).\nInsert the assembled microneedle into the slit of plunger.\nPut on the spring and insert the plunger into the case (Figure 1c). Avoid the microneedle touching anything in the assembling procedure to ensure the needle quality.\nSeal the assembled absorbent microbiopsy in a package for γ-radiation sterilization before using.\n2. Sampling with the Absorbent Microbiopsy\nWear disposable gloves, and spray hands and tools, such as forceps, with 70% EtOH.\nSanitize the application site with an alcohol wipe.\nRemove the microbiopsy from the γ-radiation sterilized package without touching the microneedle in the process.\nLoad the device by pulling the plunger to compress the spring until there is a ‘click’ sound and the plunger locks in place.\nAim the device at the skin to be sampled, ensuring that the sampling area is in a fixed position.\nEnsure that the device is approximately perpendicular to the skin, then apply ≥1 kg of force to the device onto the skin.\n\tNote: Applying force downwards into the skin is required to ensure sufficient penetration of the microneedle.",
    "Press the trigger and hold the device in place for a minimum of 10 s for the blood sample to be absorbed.\n\tNote: If the device is released before 10 s, there is less sample captured.\n3. RNA Extraction\nNote: The RNA extraction procedures were modified from manufacturers’ protocol for optimal isolation of RNA from microbiopsied sample. All the reagents and column used in RNA extraction are included in the kit unless indicated otherwise.\nPull out the plunger and absorbent microneedle from the case by hands gently. Ensure that the tip of the microneedle does not come into contact with anything during removal.\nRemove the absorbent microneedle from the plunger. Hold onto the two holes on the microneedle with a pair of sterile forceps and pull it out.\nPut the intact microneedle in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube (not from the RNA isolation kit; see Table of Materials) prefilled with 50 µL of Extraction Buffer, with the needle side facing down towards the bottom. To minimize sample loss, leave the tube on dry ice for 5 min before processing the sample.\nVortex briefly (3 - 5 s) to remove some of the sampled materials from the tip.\nIncubate the microneedle in the tube on a rocker for 30 min at 42 °C.\n\tNote: The buffer solution will be absorbed into the absorbent layer immediately.\nPlace the top part of the microneedle (the opposite side from the needle) level with the top edge of the 2 mL microfuge tube using sterile forceps.\nClose the lid of the tube such that the top of the microneedle is held in place between the cap and tube.\nSpin the tube at 16,000 x g or at maximum speed for 30 s to remove the sampled materials from the absorbent layer of the device.",
    "Remove the microneedle carefully with forceps without dipping back into the buffer solution. Keep the tube and discard the microneedle.\nCentrifuge the samples at 3,000 x g for 2 min. Pipette the supernatant containing the extracted RNA carefully into a new microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 250 µL of Conditioning Buffer onto the purification column filter membrane and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the column in the collection tube at 16,000 x g or at maximum speed for 1 min.\nAdd 50 µL of 70% EtOH into the collected sample from Step 3.9. Mix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nTransfer the mixture (~100 µL) into the preconditioned purification column.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 100 x g immediately, followed by a centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 30 s to remove the flow-through.\nAdd 100 µL of Wash Buffer 1 (W1) into the purification column and centrifuge for 1 min at 8,000 x g.\nPrepare DNase solution by adding 5 µL of DNase I Stock Solution to 35 µL of Buffer RDD in a separate microcentrifuge tube for each sample. Mix by gently inverting.\n\tNote: The DNase treatment is to be performed on the purification column, instead of in the PCR plate afterwards, because of the quantity of the sample.\nAdd 40 µL of DNase incubation mix directly into the purification column membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nAdd 40 µL of W1 into the purification column membrane. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 15 s.\nPipette 100 µL of Wash Buffer 2 (W2) into the purification column after the DNase treatment and centrifuge for 1 min at 8,000 x g.",
    "Add another 100 µL of W2 into the purification column and centrifuge for 2 min at 16,000 x g. Check the purification column for any residual wash buffer. Re-centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 1 min if any wash buffer remains.\nTransfer the purification column to a new 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube provided in the kit.\nPipette 11 µL of RNase-free water (not provided in the RNA isolation kit), instead of Elution Buffer (EB), directly onto the membrane of the purification column. Gently touch the tip of the pipette to the surface of the membrane while dispensing the RNase-free water to ensure maximum absorption of RNase-free water into the membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nCentrifuge the column for 1 min at 1,000 x g to distribute the RNase-free water in the column, then centrifuge for 16,000 x g at 1 min to elute RNA.\n\tNote: RNA quantification is not recommended due to the small quantity of the sample.\nStop point #1: Store the total RNA sample at -80 °C if cDNA synthesis is not performed immediately.\n\tNote: Avoid freezing if not necessary given the low concentration of RNA sample.\n4. cDNA Synthesis\nThaw the frozen sample on ice (from Step 3.25).\nSynthesize cDNA from total RNA with cDNA synthesis kit according to the procedure below.\nPrepare the reaction mix: 11 µL of total RNA, 4 µL of 5x TransAmp Buffer, 1 µL of reverse transcriptase, 4 µL of DNase/RNase-free water. Mix gently by pipetting.\nRun reverse transcription on a thermal cycler apparatus: 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 15 min, followed by a final reverse transcriptase inactivation step at 85 °C for 5 min.\nStop point #2: Store the reverse transcribed sample at -80 °C until use.\n5. qPCR Reaction and Data Analysis",
    "Note: The primers for qPCR reactions were designed to span intron boundaries to avoid the amplification of genomic DNA using NCBI Primer BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). The reference gene used in this study is RPLP0 (see the Discussion section for more information).\nThaw the frozen sample on ice (from Step 4.5).\nPerform qPCR with the qPCR master mix kit according to the procedure below.\nPrepare master mix containing the followings per reaction: 5 µL of 2x qPCR reaction mix, 0.4 µL of 10 µM forward primer, 0.4 µL of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.2 µL of DNase-free water. Mix gently by pipetting. Set up the samples in triplicates.\nPipette 8 µL of the master mix into each well of a 384-well PCR plate first and then 2 µL of cDNA from each sample (a total of 10 µL per well).\n\tNote: No template control (NTC) and no reverse transcriptase control (-RT) are included as negative controls.\nSeal the plate with adhesive film, and centrifuge briefly.\nRun the amplification reaction on a real-time thermal cycler: 95 °C for 2 min (polymerase activation), followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s (denaturation), 60 °C for 10 s (annealing) and 72 °C for 10 s (extension).\nCalculate the RNA concentration of samples by interpolating from a standard curve prepared from templates with known concentrations.\n\t\nCreate a New Experiment in the software.\nClick Define and Set Up Standards to set up serial dilution for plates.\nSelect and arrange the wells for standards and samples. Click Apply.\nClick Analyze in the Result tab to assess the standard curve. Confirm the slope, R2 value, amplification efficiency and error meet the experimental criteria.\nCheck the quantities of the unknown samples visually on the standard curve based on their Ct values.",
    "Note: The construction of standard curve, including the choice of dilution factor, is performed according to published protocols11,12,13.\nPerform gene expression analysis of mRNA by using the ΔCt method (Ct is normalized to a refence gene).\n\t\nSubtract the Ct value of target gene from the Ct value of reference gene to obtain the ΔCt value.\nAverage the ΔCt values of technical replicates.\nPlot and analyze the gene expression with statistics software11,14 (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, the gene expression analysis is performed according to published protocols13."
