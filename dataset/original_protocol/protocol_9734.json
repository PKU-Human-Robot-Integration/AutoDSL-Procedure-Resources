    "All animals received human care following the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol (IACUC- protocol #2020N000015). Seven female Yorkshire pigs (20-25 kg) were used for all experiments.\n1. Preoperative care\nFast the animal for solid food 12 h prior to the surgery.\nSedate the animal with 4.4 mg/kg of Telazol, 2.2 mg/kg of Xylazine, and 0.04 mg/kg (IM) of Atropine sulfate (see Table of Materials).\nPlace an 18 G peripheral intravenous catheter in an ear vein.\nIntubate the swine with an appropriate endotracheal tube (6-15 mm can be used for 10-200 kg pigs) and connect the tube to a ventilator. Administer pre-operative analgesia with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, IM) (see Table of Materials).\n2. Intraoperative monitoring\nMaintain anesthesia with an inhalation mixture of 1.5%-3% isoflurane with 1.5 L/min oxygen flow.\nContinuously monitor the heart rate, pulse oximetry, and end-tidal CO2. Assess blood pressure and body temperature every 5 min.\n\tNOTE: The target range for the heart rate is between 90-100 beats/min, the oxygen saturation must be higher than 93%, and the end-tidal CO2 range is between 5%-6% of CO2.\nAdminister 5-10 mL/kg per hour 0.9% saline throughout the procedure to regulate the mean arterial pressure between 60 mmHg and 90 mmHg.\n3. Bilateral saphenous FCF procurement\nPlace the animal in a supine position. Shave and scrub both groins and hindlimbs, include the entire hindlimbs in the surgical site, and drape in a sterile fashion.\nPalpate the pulse of the saphenous artery ~3 finger-widths medial from the patella and tag it.\nIdentify and draw the limits of the flap.",
    "NOTE: The superior limit is an axis parallel to the inguinal crease 3 cm below it. The lateral limit is an axis from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial part of the patella.\nDraw a 10 cm diameter oval-like flap centered on the saphenous pedicle and contained in the previously described flap limits (step 3.3).\nMake a 1.5 cm skin incision regarding the distal portion of the pedicle on the flap landmark.\nOpen the fascia and blunt dissect to expose the saphenous artery and its two venae comitantes. Perform a double ligature and separate in one bundle.\nIncise the remaining skin of the flap with a blade.\nUse cautery to open the subcutaneous tissue and the surrounding fascia. Perform thorough hemostasis using bipolar forceps (see Table of Materials).\nAttach the skin component of the flap to the underlying fascia with 3-0 non-absorbable sutures to avoid inadvertent traction and disruption of perforating vessels.\nFree the flap from the gracilis by dissecting the fascia away from the muscle.\n\tNOTE: The distal part of the saphenous pedicle runs in a plane between the gracilis muscle and the fascia. Appropriate tension and cautious bipolar hemostasis of side branches are crucial elements to ease the pedicle dissection.\nUse a scalpel to make a 12 cm incision in the inguinal crease. Perform a perpendicular incision joining the inguinal crease to the proximal part of the flap. Lift away the connecting skin and open the subcutaneous layer using cautery.\nContinue the pedicle dissection by following the saphenous vessels down towards the femoral vessels.\n\tNOTE: The proximal portion of the saphenous pedicle can either run through the intermuscular septum or dive into the gracilis muscle.",
    "Skeletonize the femoral vessels and ligate them distally to the saphenous branch in two separate bundles. Continue the dissection of the femoral vessels from distal to proximal until reaching the level of the inguinal ligament. Use bipolar forceps to cauterize or vascular clips and 2-0 silk ties to ligate the deep femoral vessels, then cut.\n\tNOTE: Vascular clips can also be used before cutting the vessels.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.13 on the contralateral hindlimb to harvest the second saphenous flap.\nHeparinize the animal with an intravenous (IV) heparin injection (100 IU/kg) 5 min before step 3.16.\nLigate the femoral pedicle (artery and vein) as proximal to the inguinal ligament as possible and separate the flap from the donor pig.\nDilate the femoral vessel ends and insert a 20 G angiocatheter in both artery and vein. Use 3-0 silk ties to secure the catheter to the vessels.\nSlowly flush the fascio-cutaneous flap artery with 10 mL of heparin saline (100 IU/mL) until a clear venous outflow is observed (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63557/63557fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Native and decellularized saphenous fascio-cutaneous flap.

Confirm death by the absence of heartbeat and respiratory movements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
