    "1. Conceiving the Study and Definition of Methods (Figure 1: Part A)\nNOTE: Definition of the optimization objective: Is a time course of product formation needed or is only a limited time interval or even a fixed time point relevant? Also, consider potential issues such as stability, effort of analytical quantification, or cultivation time. As an alternative to final protein titer, other objectives could be considered such as biomass or cultivation time. Biomass is reflected by biomass specific product yield, while cultivation time is reflected by space-time-yield. (Minimum) product quality could also be an aim. Multi-objective optimization may be required in certain situations, as discussed elsewhere40. In this study, GFP titer after 17 h of cultivation was chosen as the optimization objective. GFP fluorescence can be followed online using the equipment available in this study, which greatly simplifies determining the concentration of the model protein.\nNOTE: Definition of the parameters to be optimized: CgXII medium consists of 16 individual components41 and investigating all of these in a full factorial design would result in 216 ≈ 65,000 experiments. Consequently, the search space needs to be reduced on a rational and experience-driven basis. The selection of media components considered for optimization can be supported by available expert knowledge or literature data.\nDecide which medium component concentrations should not be varied. For the optimization of CgXII medium, the following components were chosen to be fixed:\nGlucose is fixed at 10 g/L. This optimization is trivial because more glucose yields more GFP secreting biomass. The aim was to reveal non-intuitive medium effects.\n3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) is fixed at 42 g/L. This provides sufficient buffering capacity during batch cultivation and is not metabolized.",
    "​NOTE: The addition of MOPS at this final concentration ensures a starting value of pH 7, even with the different volumes of the other stock solutions added, which are not at pH 7. However, to exclude any deviation in starting pH values, the pH should be checked for medium compositions where all stock solutions are added at their maximum and minimum volumes.\nKH2PO4 and K2HPO4 are fixed at 1 g/L each. These provide also buffering capacity, and serve as a phosphate source.\nUrea is fixed at 5 g/L. This serves as a basal nitrogen source and pH-stabilizing agent, sufficient to prevent N-limitation.\nBiotin is fixed at 0.2 mg/L. C. glutamicum ATCC13032 is auxotrophic for biotin.\nProtocatechuic acid (PCA) is fixed at 30 mg/L. It serves as an iron chelating agent.\nIsopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is fixed at 100 µM. It induces expression of the gfp gene.\nSelect high and low concentrations of media components for initial sensitivity screenings. Here, components from three typical groups of media components were chosen. The investigated low and high concentrations for each component are:\nStandard nitrogen source: (NH4)2SO4 (8-32 g/L); the variation of nitrogen source was reported to be promising for optimization of biomass-specific GFP signal8.\nTrace elements: FeSO4 ∙ 7 H2O (4-16 mg/L), MnSO4 ∙ H2O (4-16 mg/L), ZnSO4 ∙ 7 H2O (0.4-1.6 mg/L), CuSO4 ∙ 5 H2O (125-501 µg/L), NiCl2 ∙ 6 H2O (8-32 µg/L) and CoCl2 ∙ 6 H2O (52-208 µg/L). The composition of trace elements is inherited from the first publication of CgXII medium41. In addition, Na2MoO4 ∙ H2O (26-104 µg/L) and H3BO3 (20-80 µg/L) were included as trace elements, as they are used in a published variant of CgXII medium42.",
    "Macro elements: MgSO4 ∙ 7 H2O (0.2-0.4 g/L), CaCl2 ∙ 2 H2O (5.3-21.2 mg/L). These were found among other divalent cations to enhance secretory GFP production in another study14, where C. glutamicum strain R was used with a different medium background and the CgR0949 Tat signal peptide.\nPreparation of materials and definition procedures\n\tNOTE: It is advised to define and fix the experimental methods at a detailed level. This standardization ensures that different results can be traced back to intrinsic biological variability or different medium compositions.\n\t​NOTE: Media stock solutions: Prepare individual stock solutions for all investigated media components. Prepare highly concentrated stocks to allow for the dilution of different volumes for all components. This means that after combining all stock solutions at their highest volume according to the design plan, this cannot exceed the final cultivation volume, cf. paragraph \"Generation of medium stock solution pipetting list\" step 1.3.3. If the addition of a highly concentrated solution results in a very low addition volume, e.g. < 1/100th of the final cultivation volume, dilute the stock solution accordingly. For instance, in this study a pipetting volume of less than 10 µL was defined to be infeasible. Typically, trace element solutions are concentrated as high as 1,000fold with respect to final standard concentration in the medium. It is advantageous to concentrate media components as multiples (X-fold) with respect to concentrations in the reference recipe. By doing so, infeasible pipetting volumes of fractional decimals are avoided. Detailed recipes for all stock solutions of CgXII medium are given in the supplementary document.\n\t\nWorking cell bank (WCB)",
    "Note: For each growth experiment, one WCB aliquot is used. If more aliquots are needed, use 100 mL brain heart infusion (BHI) medium in 1,000 mL baffled shake flasks or inoculate multiple shake flasks, which are pooled before the addition of glycerol solution.\n\t\t\nPrepare single colonies of the recombinant expression strain C. glutamicum pCGPhoDBs-GFP43 on agar plates (37 g/L BHI powder, 20 g/L agar, 25 mg/L kanamycin). Plating material can either come from fresh transformation or from a cryopreserved aliquot. Incubate at 30 °C until the appearance of single colonies; this takes usually one to two days.\nInoculate a shaker flask culture (50 mL BHI medium with 25 mg/L kanamycin, 500 mL baffled flask, 250 rpm, 25 mm shaking diameter, 30 °C) with colony material and incubate overnight (approximately 16 h).\nCombine one volume of resulting cell suspension with one volume of 500 g/L sterile glycerol solution and distribute in 2 mL aliquots in sterile cryopreservation vials. Store at -80 °C.\nMBR cultivation protocol",
    "Note: For the employed BioLector MBR system in this study, scattered light (biomass) and GFP fluorescence are intensity measurements, which need a certain gain value assigned. The higher the gain, the higher the optical signal is amplified; this is also why scattered light and fluorescence are measured in arbitrary units (a.u.). Determine suitable gain values for biomass and GFP detection in preliminary experiments, along with suitable shaking frequency and filling volume to avoid oxygen limitation at higher biomass concentrations during later process stages. The employed cultivation conditions (\"Flowerplates\", i.e., flower-shaped 48-well MTPs, shaking frequency of 1,200 rpm, filling volume of 1,000 µL, 10 g/L glucose as main carbon source) ensured oxygen unlimited cultivations. For maximum oxygen transfer rates resulting from other combinations of filling volumes and shaking frequencies in flower-shaped 48-well MTPs, datasheets from the supplier are available. Also, growth defects of individual cultures may occur due to low amounts of secondary substrates (e.g., nitrogen, trace elements). Therefore, check the biomass concentrations at the end of cultivations. In this study, no such growth effects were observed.\n\t\t\nDefine the cultivation protocol for the MBR system (\"BioLector\") as follows:\nFilterset 1: Biomass, gain 14. Filterset 2: pH, gain is preset. Filterset 3: pO2, gain is preset. 4: GFP, gain 80.\nShaking frequency: 1,200 rpm.\nTemperature: 30 °C.\nCycle time: 15 min.\nExperiment time: manual (Cultivation will not be stopped automatically).\nGeneration of medium stock solution pipetting list",
    "Note: Almost any liquid handling robot system is capable to read pipetting actions from external files. Basically, the minimal information needed is the transfer volume and position of reagent source, as well as the destination of each represented by a labware position on the robotic deck and a specific cavity within the labware. However, different syntaxes for different liquid handling systems must be considered. Figure 2 shows an example file structure for the employed pipetting system in this study.\n\t\t\nFour types of stock solutions are pipetted into each cultivation well:\n\t\t\t\nStock solutions of media components that are varied (\"Variation Stocks\").\nWater to compensate for different cumulative volumes of above stocks.\nA stock solution (\"Rest Stock\") containing all components that are fixed. This stock solution can be composed from stocks containing the different components that are, e.g., stored at different temperatures or sterilized by different methods.\nInoculum, which should be added as the last component and put onto the worktable just before addition to avoid settling of the cells.\nPer cultivation well, calculate the volumes to be transferred for all media components according to:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56234/56234eq1v2.jpg\n\t\t\tThe volume to be added for certain Variation Stocks maybe zero, i.e., when this specific component is omitted.\nRevise all calculated volumes Vi for suitable numbers. Pipetting volume increments in volume steps should not be too small. If necessary, adjust the concentrations of Variation Stocks. For instance, the minimal pipetting volume here was defined as 10 µL, and the minimal increment was defined as 5 µL. In general, these volumes should be defined based on experimentally determined precision and accuracy for the used liquid handling station15,44.\nCalculate the volume of Rest Stock containing the fixed components for all wells as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56234/56234eq2v2.jpg",
    "where the maximum cumulative volume of Variation Stock imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56234/56234eq3v2.jpg is used. Consequently, calculate the required concentrations of the fixed components in Rest Stock as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56234/56234eq4v4.jpg\n\t\t\tPrepare Rest Stock accordingly.\nPer cultivation well, calculate the volume of water to be added as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56234/56234eq5v2.jpg\nPer cultivation well, list all volumes to be added in the following order of addition: VH2O, VRestStock, Vi, VInok. Format the pipetting list according to the specifications of the liquid handling station, as shown for an example in Figure 2.\nSeed culture, automated media preparation, and start of main culture\nCreate a protocol for the liquid handling robot. See Figure 3 and Figure 4 for an example protocol for a \"Janus\" system, implemented in corresponding \"WinPREP\" software. The protocol should consider the following aspects:\n\t\t\nInclude a sufficient runtime of sterile housing prior to media preparation.\nInclude an initial excessive cleaning and washing of all pipetting tips and tubing.\nChoose appropriate labware containers for stock solutions. Here, deep well plates with 12 columns are suitable for storage of Variation Stocks, as all eight pipetting tips can dip in a parallel arrangement into the well columns. This greatly speeds up media preparation. If 15 mL or 50 mL reagent tubes are used as reservoirs, only one pipetting tip can dip into it at once. For other stocks like water and Rest Stock, 100 mL troughs are used, as these stock solutions require higher volumes in total.\nProvide a sufficient total volume for each stock solution to compensate for waste volumes, height pipetting offsets, etc.\nInsert a user prompt before the inoculation step, ensuring that this step is carried out immediately prior to the seed culture procedure.",
    "Prepare all stock solutions in a sterile manner and store until use, in appropriate containers, e.g., sterile 15 mL and 50 mL test tubes.\nSterilize the deep well plates for stock solution storage on a worktable, e.g., by wiping with 70% ethanol and subsequent drying in a laminar flow hood.\nStart the seed culture by inoculating 50 mL BHI medium containing 25 mg/L kanamycin with one aliquot from the WCB. Before the MBR cultivation, prepare fresh, vital inoculum from exponentially growing seed cultures in a sufficient amount.\nPlace all necessary labware on the robotic worktable and pour stock solutions in the corresponding labware.\nStart the robotic workflow for media preparation, so that the last step (inoculation), is reached in time with the start of seed culture. The total runtime of the robotic workflow needs to be evaluated previously. Here, the total runtime was approximately 1.5 h.\nSample the seed culture after approximately 2 h, then each hour, to monitor the growth by optical density (OD600). After approximately 5 h, the culture reaches 3-4 OD600 and is used to inoculate the main cultures.\nPlace the seed culture on the liquid handler worktable and continue the media preparation protocol. Seal cultivation MTP after inoculation.\nPlace the sealed cultivation MTP in the BioLector device and start the pre-defined cultivation protocol.\nDispose the remaining stock solutions, according to biosafety regulations if necessary, and seed the culture from the robotic worktable. Clean the re-usable labware and start the liquid handler decontamination protocol.\nProduct quantification and preprocessing of raw data for analysis\nStop the main culture after a 17 h runtime.\nTransfer the measurement data from BioLector MBR device to the connected computer using the BioLection software package according to the manufacturer's user manual.",
    "Use the \"Data Management → Transform Data\" function of the \"BioLection\" software package that accompanies the MBR system to convert the raw data file into an easy access spreadsheet format. Copy the GFP signal data for all cultivation wells from the timestamp column closest to 17 h. Identify the GFP signals from the reference cultivation wells and the average. Normalize all remaining GFP signal by the average reference signal.\nQuantify the GFP titer using additional methods (if required)\n\t\t\nTransfer the cell suspensions from all cultivation wells into prelabeled reaction tubes and obtain the cell-free supernatant after centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed using a benchtop centrifuge.\nTransfer 200 µL of each cell-free supernatant into a black 96-well MTP with transparent bottom, and read the GFP specific fluorescence at 488/520 nm using an appropriate microplate reader. Normalize the GFP signal from all wells with average signal from reference cultivations, as in step 1.5.3.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The absolute GFP fluorescence signals cannot be compared for different measurement devices. Therefore, the 5 reference strains from all main cultivations serve as an internal standard. The improvement of GFP titer can be expressed in relation to the internal standard. This allows for comparison of results from different experiments and different GFP quantification methods (see next two steps).\nDetermine the protein content of the cell-free supernatants with standard protocols, e.g., Bradford or BCA assay. In combination with the results from step 2, the determination of a protein specific GFP titer is possible.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After fluorescence measurement, use the sample directly from this microplate. Use of multi-channel pipettes greatly facilitates the necessary liquid handling steps.\nPerform an SDS-Page visualization of cell-free supernatants following standard protocols to verify that most of the increase protein content is due to increased GFP secretion.",
    "NOTE: SDS-Page is more laborious than the previously mentioned methods, especially with a high sample load. For verification purposes, it is often sufficient to run SDS-Pages of cell-free supernatants from reference medium and final optimized medium cultivations15.\n2. Sensitivity Analysis (Figure 1: Part B)\nNOTE: The goal of this part is to identify the important factors that have a significant effect on the objective.\nChoose an initial concentration range of media components. The reference medium composition should lie inside the chosen concentration ranges.\nChoose an appropriate DOE. Such designs can be found in literature, e.g., from the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods (available at www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/section3/pri3347.htm). The chosen design depends on number of media components of interest (here, 11) and the number of performed experiments (here, 32). In the given example, design \"2IV11-6\" was chosen that results in 32 experiments and allows estimation of the effect of increasing the concentration of one of the eleven components on the objective of interest. To be more specific, the main effects are not confounded with pair-wise factor interactions. They can be confounded with higher order interactions that are, however, most likely not significant.\nUse the remaining wells (here, 16) for performing multiple replicates with the reference medium to assess the reproducibility of the process. Replicates should be equally spread over the plate to discover positional effects. The mean value of the measured output from the reference experiments is used for normalization. That is, each measured output of the sensitivity analysis is divided by the mean value of the reference output.",
    "Calculate the main and if possible the combinatorial effects using appropriate statistics software. The classic design of experiment is based on a polynomial approximation45. For instance, the MATLAB function mvregress can be used for the estimation of the polynomial coefficients. The mvregress function is part of the statistics and machine learning toolbox.\nIdentify the relevant effects of various media components on the objective using a ttest. In the example, NH4+ has a significant negative effect, and Ca2+ and Mg2+ show the strongest positive effects (Figure 5). Because GFP signal was normalized, the coefficients represent the average relative change in the GFP signal when increasing concentration of the particular component from its center value, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56234/56234eq7v2.jpg, to its maximum value.\nFixed components without a relevant effect are at their reference value during the optimization.\n3. Iterative Optimization (Figure 1: Part C)\nNOTE:The MATLAB tool KriKit was used for the interpretation and statistical data analysis36. KriKit allows the user to construct a data-driven Kriging model. This Kriging model predicts the functional relationship between the media components and the objective. It also provides information on the prediction uncertainty. High uncertainty indicates noisy data and/or insufficient data density.\nDOE\n\t​NOTE: New experiments are iteratively designed, based on the results of the previous run.\n\t\nIn the first iteration, design new experiments for detailed investigation of identified media components of interest. Experimental results from Section 2 cannot be transferred to the iterative optimization (Section 3), as the concentrations of components without relevant effect are now fixed to the respective reference value. Consequently, experiments from the sensitivity analysis and the iterative optimization are not comparable.",
    "Otherwise, follow the scheme illustrated in Figure 1, frame \"Iterative optimization\". If the potential optimum lies inside the defined concentration range, new experiments are designed using the expected improvement40,46. The experimental design based on the expected improvement is integrated in the KriKit toolbox. If the optimum lies on the boundary, expand the concentration range.\nPerform experiments at the designed sample points according to experimental methods defined in Section 2.\nStatistical analysis\nConstruct a Kriging model using the combined data from all iterations, including the current.\nInvestigate the model output by visualization using the comprehensive tools of KriKit (2/3D interpolation, movie analysis, screening plot, etc.).\nIf an optimal area was estimated with sufficient accuracy, stop optimization. If not, continue with step 3.1.\n\tNOTE: Figure 6 illustrates the iterative optimization for the test study. The concentration range was successively expanded until a plateau was found (iteration 1-6). The seventh iteration was used for exploring the boundaries in more detail.\n4. Verification of Results (Figure 1: Part D)\nNOTE: After finishing the iterative optimization, the initial assumptions need to be checked for validity.\nRedo sensitivity analysis (Section 2) for optimal medium composition. That is, the concentrations of components that are investigated in Figure 1 (part C) are fixed to their optimal values. Concentrations of other components are varied according to an appropriate DOE.\n\tNOTE: Similar results in both screenings indicate that the concentration levels of the investigated components do not alter the effect of the other components. If the screening shows significant differences to the results from part B, components with a changed effect should be added to the pool of investigated components and part C should be repeated.",
    "In the case of indirect measurement (e.g., fluorescence as indicator for product concentration), apply orthogonal measurement approaches (e.g., activity assay, Bradford or BCA protein quantification, SDS page) to confirm the change in the objective of interest by comparing results from the reference medium and the optimized medium15."
