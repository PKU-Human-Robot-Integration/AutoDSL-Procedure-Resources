    "Isolation of stromal vascular cells (SVCs) from adipose tissue (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170809/20170809221226_7528.jpgFigure 1. Scheme for isolation of stromal vascular cells from adipose tissueMale mice with 18-20 weeks age were euthanized following the ICCUAC approval protocol.After thoroughly wet the fur with 70% ethanol and then open the thoracic cavity, epididymal fat tissues were collected and weighed.Mince fat tissues on a 100-mm Petri dish by using a curved scissor.Transfer minced tissues to a 50 ml Falcon tube containing digestion buffer (HBSS containing 2% BSA and 100 mM HEPES).Add 10 ml digestion buffer (see Recipes) per 1 g fat tissue.Incubate in an incubator shaker (secure the tubes horizontally) at 220 rpm for 10 min, 37 °C (no chunk tissue represents complete digestion).Add equal volume of complete culture medium and mix to cease the digestion.Filter through a nylon biopsy bag (pore size = 250 µm) into a new 50 ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge at 1,500 x g at 4 °C for 10 min.Decant the supernatant and re-suspend cell pellet in 1 ml of PBS/2% FBS.Add 2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer (see Recipes) (1:2) and mix.Incubate on ice for 10 min.Add 3 ml of complete medium (1:1) and mix.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min, 4 °C.Decant the supernatant.SVCs are resuspended with 0.5 ml of PBS/2% FBS and then counted using the TC20 automated cell counter. Cell concentration is adjusted to 2 x 106 cells per ml, and the cells are ready for the downstream experiments.Flow cytometry analysisPrepare 0.5-1 x 106 SVCs and resuspend in FACS staining buffer (see Recipes).Stain SVCs with the fluorescent-conjugated antibodies (Materials and Reagents #11) following the manufacturer’s instruction.Incubate for 15 min at RT (light sensitive; keep in the dark).Add 1 ml FACS staining buffer.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min, 4 °C.Decant the supernatant.",
    "Re-suspend with 100-200 µl FACS staining buffer. Option: Cells can be stored in BDTM stabilizing fixative buffer up to 3 days at 4 °C and then used for FACS analysis.Then the sample is ready for flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2) or specific immune cell isolation by cell sorter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170809/20170809221421_5916.jpgFigure 2. Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The SVCs were stained with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies against CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, CD206, CD19, and then examined by flow cytometry analysis. A. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) were defined as CD11b+F4/80+ subpopulations and displayed as percentage of CD45+ cells. B. M1 and M2 ATMs were defined as CD11b+F4/80+CD11c+CD206- and CD11b+F4/80+CD11c-CD206+, respectively. These cell populations were shown as percentage of ATMs. C. B cells were defined as CD45+CD19+ and the cell population was presented as the percentage of CD45+ cells.RT-PCRSVCs are resuspended in Trizol (add 100 µl Trizol reagent to < 105 cells; add 300 µl Trizol reagent to < 106 cells) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature (RT).After centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min (RT), transfer the supernatant to a new tube. Total RNAs are isolated using Direct-zol RNA kits.RNA concentration is measured by NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer.RNAs (500 ng) are converted to cDNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit.The reverse transcription reactions are under the thermal cycling program: 25 °C for 10 min, then 37 °C for 120 min, then 85 °C for 5 min, and then 4 °C. The cDNA is mixed primers and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in the MicroAmp Optical 96-well reaction plate.The real time PCR (qPCR) reaction is ran under the thermal cycling condition: 95 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles (95 °C for 15 sec, and then 60 °C for 1 min).",
    "The RT-PCR results show that lean SVCs exhibit greater arginase 1 expression but less TNFα abundance than obese SVCs (Figures 3A and 3B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170809/20170809221743_8011.jpgFigure 3. Inflammatory status of SVCs by RT-PCR analysis and Western blots. There was less arginase 1 (A) but more TNFα (B) abundance in obese SVCs, compared to the lean SVCs (qPCR primer information see Table 1). C. Activation of NF-κB signalling pathway of SVCs (without stimulation) was evaluated by Western blotting analysis (Antibodies information see Materials and Reagents #11). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. n = 3 per group. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student’s t-test.Western blotsSee previous article by Zhang, 2011. The Western blotting analysis indicates that obese SVCs have higher level of phosphorylated P65 than lean SVCs (Figure 3C)."
