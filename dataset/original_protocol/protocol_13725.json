    "Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" issued by the US National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA, NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and the \"Regulation to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals\" of the Beijing Council on Animal Care (1996). The study protocol was approved by the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of Fuwai Hospital. Male SPF-class Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats) weighing 150-180 g were used in this study.\n1. Preparation of reagents, materials, and equipment\nPrepare reagents and solutions including 70% ethanol, FITC-dextran (70,000 Da, dissolved in ice-cold saline to make 10% w/v solution for use), hair removal cream, mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.5-10 µg/mL), 1% w/v EB/saline solution, and 5% w/v pentobarbital sodium/saline solution (stored in 4 °C in the dark).\nSterilize all surgical tools and materials in advance, including surgical tape; gauze pads; surgical gloves; 16 G endotracheal tube; insulin syringe; operating scissors; large, curved dissecting forceps; straight dissecting forceps; straight mosquito forceps; curved mosquito forceps; retractors (30 mm Spread); 5 cm microneedle holders; 3-0 polypropylene suture (taper needle); and 6-0 polypropylene suture (round needle).\nCheck and ensure that all equipment, including the constant temperature warming system, illumination system, ventilator, automated quantitative pathology imaging system, and ultraviolet freezing slicer, are in good condition.\n2. Preparing the rats for the surgical procedures\nDivide all SD rats into Sham group, IR group, and TXL group (IR+TXL group) randomly.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, six rats were randomly assigned to each group, n=6.\nWeigh each SD rat, record the weight, and calculate the dose of TXL to be administered for each rat.",
    "Administer ibuprofen at a dose of 30 mg/kg by gavage to each rat at least 12 h prior to thoracotomy to alleviate preoperative pain and distress.\nAdminister a superfine powder of TXL at a dose of 0.5 g/kg by gavage 12 h and 1 h to each SD rat in the IR+TXL group before anesthetization, as described19.\nDisinfect the operating table with 70% ethanol and place the sterilized surgical tools and materials on the disinfected surface.\nAdjust the temperature of the constant temperature warming system to maintain the body temperature of the rats at 37 ± 1 °C.\n3. Establish a rat model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion\nInject 5% w/v pentobarbital sodium/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at a dose of 50 mg/kg (0.1 mL/100 g body weight) into the abdominal cavity to anesthetize the rat. Prepare the surgical site by carefully removing the fur from the neck to the chest by shaving or using a depilatory cream.\nGently adjust the position of the tongue as needed with sterilized tweezers and wipe respiratory secretion with sterilized cotton balls. Keep the glottis clearly in view and insert an endotracheal tube into the trachea gently.\nConnect the endotracheal tube to a ventilator circling at 65-80 breaths per minute and adjust the tidal volume at 4-5 mL by fixing the rat's head and limbs.\nPlace a sterile drape over the rat, disinfect the operating area with tincture of iodine followed by 70% ethanol, and repeat this procedure three times.\nMake a left parasternal incision at the level of the fourth intercostal space to expose the left musculus pectoralis major and pectoralis minor.\nDissect the fascia between the musculus pectoralis major and pectoralis minor using a blunt dissection technique to expose the left fourth intercostal space.",
    "NOTE: Avoid excessive tissue damage and vascular injury that will cause severe bleeding and postoperative death.\nDissect the intercostal muscles, position a chest retractor within the fourth intercostal space, and then spread the ribs.\nTear the pericardium and remove the attached adipose tissue.\n\tNOTE: Avoid damaging other organs with sharp surgical instruments, especially the lungs. Damage to the lungs can result in the development of pneumothorax and hemopneumothorax during the operation, causing cacoethic consequences ranging from hemodynamic disorders to reduced animal survival.\nManipulate the position of the thymus and expose the ascending aorta and left atria gently. Identify and ligate the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery transiently for 45 min with a 6-0 polypropylene suture (see Figure 1 A-D).\n\tNOTE: This procedure is identical for sham control rats except that the LAD is not ligated.\nRemove the chest retractor and draw the ribs together in an interrupted suture pattern with a 3-0 polypropylene suture.\nRestore negative intrathoracic pressure to ensure effective breathing.\n\tNOTE: Two methods can be used to restore negative intrathoracic pressure: i) before closing the chest cavity, researchers can plug up the air outlet of the ventilator for 2 cycles to inflate the lungs. ii) The air remaining in the chest cavity can be drawn out with a syringe after the intercostal space has been closed.\nAfter hair removal and disinfection, make an incision in the right lower limb and dissect the superficial fascia from the right femoral vein.\nLoosen the ligation and check the respiration and circulation conditions after inducing myocardial ischemia for 45 min.\nInject 10% (w/v) FITC-dextran/saline solution into the femoral vein at 0.15 mL/100 g body weight, and press the femoral vein for 1 min with sterile cotton balls to stanch the bleeding (Figure 2A,B).",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, inject 1% w/v EB/saline solution into the femoral vein at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g body weight.\nSew up the incisions with a 3-0 polypropylene suture and disinfect the incisions, followed by postoperative analgesia with ibuprofen, as described above.\n4. Preparation of frozen tissue slices for fluorescence measurement\nInject 5% w/v pentobarbital sodium/PBS solution at a dose of 150 mg/kg (0.3 mL/100 g body weight) intraperitoneally to anesthetize the rats deeply after 3 h of myocardial reperfusion.\nSlit the abdominal cavity and expose the aorta abdominalis and vena cava (see in Figure 3A).\nInject 50 mL of ice-cold PBS into the vena cava steadily, cut the aorta abdominalis to flush blood from the myocardium, and harvest the heart.\n\tNOTE: Observe changes in the lungs and liver. A sweating liver suggests that saline is accurately injected into the vena cava (see in Figure 3C), and a pale lung is considered a sign of a well-perfused myocardium (see in Figure 3B).\nIn a dark room, rinse the heart in ice-cold saline or PBS gently to remove any remaining blood and FITC-dextran (or EB) from the chambers of the heart.\nCut off the heart from the ligation and discard the myocardium above the ligation.\nEmbed the heart in molds with embedding compound followed by storage at -80 °C.\nUnload the frozen tissues from the embedding molds and load them on sample holders in a prechilled -20 °C chamber of a freezing slicer.\nAdjust the thickness of a single slice to 5-8 µm and slice the tissue at approximately the midpoint of the base-apex axis (e.g., the middle of the ischemia).\nLoad the sliced tissue on adhesive microscope slides and seal each slice with one drop (approximately 40 µL) of fluorescent mounting medium containing DAPI.",
    "Keep the slides in a dry and dark box.\n\t​NOTE: If the slides cannot be scanned immediately, store them in a dry, cool, and dark place to prevent the formation of condensate water and fluorescence quenching.\n5. Fluorescence measurement and data analysis\nSet up the imaging system and check the software connected to the scanner.\nLoad the slides in the slide shelves and insert them into the scanner.\nOpen the slide scanner software (see the Table of Materials) and set up a new exposure protocol by clicking on Edit Protocol | New….\n\tNOTE: If the scanner or its affiliated software is not available, a laser confocal microscope (see the Table of Materials) or other ordinary slide scanners with the fluorescence mode (see the Table of Materials) may be an alternative to the automated quantitative fluorescence scanner.\nRename the protocol and study, and select the fluorescence mode.\nDefine Whole Slide Scan | Pixel Resolution and Multispectral Regions | Pixel Resolution as 0.25 µm (40x) respectively.\nClick on Edit Filters and Bands... to select the Whole Slide Scan Filters column and the Multispectral Region Bands column.\n\tNOTE: If EB is used, select Whole Slide Scan Filters | DAPI and Texas Red or AF495. If FITC-dextran is used, select Multispectral Region Bands | DAPI and FITC or AF488.\nClick on Edit Exposures... and load the carrier.\nSelect the target slot and click on Take overview.\n\tNOTE: This takes a brightfield scan of each heart section. Select the myocardium for focusing or select the area blindly.\nSelect the target slide, adjust Stage Height to approximately -50 µm, and click on Auto Focus.\nClick on Whole Scan Exposure(ms)-DAPI | Autoexpose.",
    "NOTE: The exposure time of DAPI for each slide does not have to be the same because images with DAPI are used to illustrate cross-sections of the heart, which are convenient for outlining the area of the myocardium but not to calculate fluorescence density.\nClick on Whole Scan Exposure(ms)-FITC | Autoexpose.\n\tNOTE: Click on Whole Scan Exposure(ms)-Texas Red | Autoexpose if using EB. It is important to remember and ensure that the exposure time of FITC or Texas Red is the same in all slide scans.\nClick on Auto Focus again and ensure that the slide is in focus.\nClick on Back and save the protocol.\nRepeat steps 5.7-5.14 for each slide.\nReturn to the home page and click on Scan Slides.\nSelect a slot, rename all the slides, and select the corresponding exposure protocol for each slide.\nScan the slides and capture the images.\nOpen the images with slide viewer software for the scans (see the Table of Materials).\nMagnify all the images to a relatively equal extent.\nSnapshot and save images as .tiff.\n\tNOTE: It is better to save the images with and without scale bars at the same time. Images with scale bars can be used for publication, whereas those without scale bars can be used for statistical analysis.\nOpen ImageJ software, click on Analyze, and select Set Measurement.\nSelect Area | Integrated density.\nOpen the image in the FITC channel with Image J.\nClick on Analyze again and record the numerical value of integrated density (IntDen) that appears.\n\tNOTE: As scale bars in the images can be mistaken for grayscale of fluorescence by computers, use images without scale bars to measure IntDen.\nClose the FITC image and open the image in the DAPI channel.\nOutline a cross-section of the myocardium.",
    "Click on Analyze and collect Area data.\nCalculate the ratios of IntDen/Area (mean of fluorescence) for each heart.\nInput all ratios in statistical analysis software."
