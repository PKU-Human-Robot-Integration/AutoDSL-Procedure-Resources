    "1. Anode preparation\nScale nickel powder (99.8%, 300 mesh) and yttrium powder (99.9%, 40 mesh) according to the molar radio of 4.2:1 as catalyst powder.\nMix the catalyst powder with graphite powder (99.9995%, 200 mesh) very well. Fill the mixed powder into hollow graphite rod (5 mm outer diameter, 2.5 mm inner diameter and 75 mm length) firmly. Make sure the total molar radio of C:Ni:Y in anode rod is 94.8:4.2:1, which is optimum ratio to synthesize SWCNT 9.\nInstall cathode rod (pure graphite, 13 mm diameter) and the stuffed anode rod inside cylindrical chamber (stainless steel, 152 mm diameter and 254 mm length). Adjust the gap distance between cathode and anode to about 3 mm.\n2. Substrate setup\nPlace a cuboid permanent magnet (25 mm × 25 mm × 100 mm) inside the chamber at about 25 mm distance from the interelectrode axis. The Ultra-High-Temp Alnico magnet used in experiment has the weight of 650 grams. Use the configuration when the interelectrode gap is placed at the distance of about h = 75 mm (Figure 1a) from the bottom of permanent magnet.\nCut the 0.3 mm thickness molybdenum sheet (99.95%) as the 25 mm × 100 mm rectangular shape. Remove surface contamination by ultrasonic dismembrator in acetone and ethanol for 30 min with 50% sonicating amplitude, 150 w output power and 40 kHz frequency.\nInstall molybdenum sheet attaching one side of permanent magnet, and turn this side towards electrodes.\nMeasure the magnetic field in the interelectrode gap by a Gaussmeter. Keep the average magnetic field between the electrodes is about 0.06 T.\n3. Ignition of arc plasma\nPump down the cylindrical chamber to the pressure less than 10-1 Torr vacuum and then filled it with helium (99.995%) to 500 Torr.",
    "Connect arc electrodes to DC welding power supply and set up the power supply on arc current of about 75 A.\nRecord the real-time values of arc current, arc voltage and chamber pressure for post-experiment analysis.\nStart the video of arcing from the right and front viewports by two digital cameras simultaneously. The snapshots after 1 second of arc starting are shown in Figure 1b (from right viewport) and Figure 1d (from front viewport).\nRun the arc for 15 seconds. Cool down chamber by natural convection for at least 20 minutes.\n4. Post-synthesis analysis and characterization\nUse tweezers to tear off the deposition flake from the surface of molybdenum sheet where the arc plasmas jet was directed. Another sample is collected from the black collar of cathode. Observe the morphology of both sides of deposition flake under SEM (acceleration voltage of 30 KV was used).\nRegarding the sample preparation for TEM analysis, the thin films of sample were obtained by drop casting a suspension of methanol-dispersed SWCNT solution after sonicating for 60 minutes using ultrasonic dismembrator with 50% sonicating amplitude. Observe the morphology of the thin film under JEOL TEM with the voltage of 100 KV after the volatilization of methanol solution. For the position of interest in sample, electron diffraction pattern can be obtained with the CCD camera length of 50 cm associated with TEM.\nRaman spectroscopy was performed on a micro-Raman system based on a 200 mW Lexel 3000 Ar ion laser (tunable single line output), with holographic optics, a 0.5 m spectrometer and a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector; wavelength 514 nm which corresponds to the energy of 2.33 eV. Raman measurements covered the range of 100 cm-1 to 3100 cm-1, and were carried out on the surface of graphene flakes.\n5. Representative Results",
    "The video snapshots obtained simultaneously from right and front viewports of the chamber are shown in Figure 1b, d for h = 75 mm. These images illustrate significant perturbation of arc plasma column in presence of external magnetic field in comparison with axially symmetric arc column observed in the case without a magnetic field 10.\nFigure 2a and 2b display the typical morphology of SWCNT and catalyst particles collected on the collar of cathode without magnetic field and with the magnetic field of B = 0.06 Tesla under TEM, respectively. It can be seen that SWCNT with magnetic field are close-packed into bundles with diameters ranging from 2 to 20 nm due to the van der Waals interaction between individual SWCNT. In comparison, the SWCNT without magnetic field have the larger diameter in bundles and larger individual diameter, which is consistent with the analysis of Raman spectrum. Also, the magnetic field can result in the SWCNT with higher purity shown in Figure 2a and 2b.\nThe most interesting influence of the magnetic field is that graphene flakes can be obtained from the surface of deposition flakes which is close to molybdenum sheet in the same process. Figure 2c and 2d show the SEM and TEM images of graphene flakes as well as few-layer graphene obtained from the sample taken at the location corresponded to arc plasmas jets. The inset of Figure 2d shows the electrons diffraction pattern associated with the graphene. The hexagonal dots pattern of electron diffraction presents the evidence of well-ordered crystal structures.",
    "Raman spectrum is a powerful tool for characterization of graphene flakes and SWCNT. The typical peaks observed in graphene are the G and 2D peaks at ~1600 cm-1 and ~2700 cm-1 respectively, using the excitation wavelength of 514 nm. The G peak stems from in plane vibrations which can be observed in all sp2 carbon materials. The 2D peak is a second order of the D peak but is seen even in non disordered systems, due to the fourth order phonon momentum exchange double resonance process. It plays a crucial role in the characterization of graphene. The intensity I(2D)/I(G) is approximately 4 for monolayer graphene and decreases with the addition of subsequent layers, thus making it possible to estimate the thickness of graphene layers. 11 Figure 3 indicates that the value of I(2D) / I(G) is around 1, which can be the evidence of few-layer graphene. The radial breathing mode (RBM) between 120 and 350 cm-1 in Raman spectrum can be used to identify the nanotube diameter through the coherent vibration frequency of the C atoms in the radial direction. The experimental relation between the frequency and SWCNT diameter is ωRBM=A/dt+B, where the parameters of A and B equal to 234 and 10 cm-1, respectively, for the typical SWCNT formed in bundles. From Figure 3, the RBM frequencies of SWCNT without and with magnetic field are 163.8 and 215.2 cm-1, corresponding to the average individual SWCNT diameters of 1.52 and 1.14 nm, respectively.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3455/3455fig1.jpg",
