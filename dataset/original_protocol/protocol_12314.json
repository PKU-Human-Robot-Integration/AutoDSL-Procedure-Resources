    "Ethics Statement: In this study animal care and use were conformed to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. All experiments were approved by the local ethical committee.\n1. Choose a Suitable Cre-recombinase Expressing Mouse Strain\nOut of the great variety of Cre transgenic lines available for purchase26 and depending on the targeted tissue to be investigated, choose a Cre transgenic mouse strain in which the Cre recombinase gene is controlled by a promoter that is specific for the tissue of interest. In case temporal control is needed, choose an inducible Cre line.\n\tNote: We chose the tamoxifen inducible K14-CreERT transgene to specifically label limbal and corneal epithelial stem/progenitor cells24. Note that there may be differences between strains, as Di Girolamo and coworkers reported limbal specificity with no corneal expression for their K14-CreERT22. An advantage to using inducible transgenic Cre mice is that it allows the induction of lineage tracing at versatile time frames.\n2. Choose a Suitable Br Mouse Strain\nChoose the appropriate Br cassette depending on the research question and available Cre line16,18,20.\n\t\nIf a non-inducible Cre mouse strain is used, choose a Br cassette that does not allow continuous DNA inversions/excisions and thus give rise to dead-end products (for example Br1.0 or Br1.1)16.\n3. Cross the Transgenic Lines of Interest\nFor the protocol shown here, cross the homozygous R26R-Confetti strain (Br2.1/Br2.1) with the homozygous CreERT strain (CreERT/CreERT) to obtain hemizygous offsprings (Br2.1/+;Cre/+)that are ready for mono-allelic lineage tracing as they all contain a single Br2.1 allele and a single Cre allele.\n\tNote: To increase the efficiency of labeling, one could generate mice that contain two Cre alleles (Br2.1/+; Cre/Cre), while two Br2.1 alleles (Br2.1/Br2.1; Cre/+) would increase color combinations (as detailed in 22).\n4. Cre-recombinase Induction",
    "Note: The administration of Tamoxifen in these experiments was carried out by daily intraperitoneal injection, for the duration of 3-4 days, in order to induce the translocation of CreERT recombinase into the nucleus of limbal and corneal basal K14-positive stem/progenitor epithelial cells. The following protocol can be used for the injection of four mice. Alternatively, topical application of Tamoxifen to the ocular surface yields higher efficiency. The Tamoxifen solution can be kept in the dark at 4 °C for up to one week. Warm the solution before use.\nWeigh 100 mg of Tamoxifen and dissolve it in 5 ml of corn oil to form a 20 mg/ml tamoxifen solution.\nInject 200 µl of Tamoxifen (4 mg) solution intraperitoneally to 8 weeks old mice for 3-4 consecutive days.\n\tNote: The Tamoxifen solution can be kept in the dark at 4 °C for up to one week. Warm the solution before use.\nFor topical application: weigh 60 mg of Tamoxifen and dissolve it in 1 ml of corn oil to form a 60 mg/ml tamoxifen solution. Vortex and set the solution in a shaking water bath maintained at 65 °C until it becomes clear leave it in the bath until use.  \n\t\nCarefully apply 100 μl of the Tamoxifen solution to each ocular surface of the mouse.\n5. Tissue Preparation for Imaging\nSacrifice animals using isoflurane (2% vaporized in oxygen) anesthesia (confirm proper anesthetization by the lack of reflexes) followed by CO2 inhalation at appropriate time points following Tamoxifen injection and collect the relevant tissue.",
    "For these experiments, enucleate eyes at the following time points: 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after Tamoxifen injection. Achieve enucleation by using curved forceps. Press the eyelids causing the eyeball to pop out of the eye socket. Place the forceps behind the eyeball holding the optic nerve. Gently pull the eyeball and detach it.\n\t\tNote: At this stage, as described below, tissues can be prepared for wholemount analysis of labeled cells. Regular frozen tissue sections can also be prepared, fixed in PFA and imaged as described below (see section 6 and 22).\nPlace each eye in a 60 mm dish filled with PBS.\nUnder a stereo-microscope using forceps hold the eye near the optic nerve with the cornea facing down and use a scalpel in order to remove the optic nerve, muscle and connective tissue and make a small incision in the posterior part of the eye.\nUsing spring scissors carefully enlarge the cut letting the lens pop out and remove the iris using forceps.\nFlatten the cornea by making 4-5 radial incisions starting from the center towards the periphery using a scalpel.\nUse a scalpel to cut excess peripheral tissue beyond the limbus.\nFix corneas in PFA 4% for 10 min, then briefly wash them with PBS.\nIncubate samples with DAPI for 10 min and briefly wash with PBS.\nMount corneas on glass slides with the epithelial side facing up. Place a drop of mounting media on top of the cornea and cover with a cover-glass. Let slides dry O/N in RT. Keep slides at 4 °C.\n6. Confocal Microscopy and Imaging Analysis",
    "Use a spectral confocal system which enables separation of YFP/GFP/CFP emissions. Set fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths depending on the fluorescent proteins of the Br cassette. Choose the most suitable excitation wavelength for each protein aiming at minimizing cross excitation. Choose narrow emission ranges in order to minimize the leak of signals from the different proteins.\n\t\nFor the Br2.1 cassette, use the following set up of fluorescence excitation (ex) and emission (em) as a starting point: DAPI — ex 405 nm/em 420–480 nm, CFP — ex 458 nm/em 470–500 nm, GFP — ex 488 nm/em 497–508 nm, YFP — ex 514 nm/em 529–540 nm, and RFP — ex 561 nm/em 575–615 nm.\nIn order to visualize large tissue areas with high resolution, acquire tile imaging. For the results shown in Figure 2A-B, image the entire cornea by obtaining an array of 12 x 12 images, i.e., acquire 144 fields (512 x 512) using 4 fluorescent channels in each field. Altogether collect 576 images and then merge.\nTo explore the localization of tagged cells in different depths and structures of the tissue, acquire Z-stack images of different regions of interest. In order to image the full depth of the cornea, acquire 8 optical sections at 3 µm intervals. Orthogonal views of the sections collected as well as image projections based on maximum intensities can be constructed using conventional imaging softwares 24.\n7. Corneal Injury Combined with Tamoxifen Induction\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane (2% vaporized in oxygen) and administer analgesics (10 mg/kg Carpofen, injected subcutaneously). Confirm proper anesthetization by unresponsiveness to toe-pinch.\nWeigh 1 g of Tamoxifen powder and dissolve it in 5 ml of sterile DMSO to produce 200 mg/ml concentration solution.",
    "Warm the Tamoxifen solution to 65 °C in a water bath until the solution becomes clear. Keep solution in the bath until use.\nApply eye ointment to the untreated contralateral eye to prevent dehydration during anesthesia. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return mice that had undergone eye wounding to the company of other mice until fully recovered. Mice should be closely monitored following the injury. In case they lose more than 10% of their body weight, suffer from corneal erosion, or discomfort, the experiment should be stopped. Repeat analgesics administration every 24 hr throughout the whole experiment. \nUsing a sterile syringe, without a needle attached to it; apply 200 µl Tamoxifen solution topically over the whole corneal surface of one eye of each mouse.\n\tNote: The liquid solution solidifies quickly on the eye surface at RT. The effect of corneal injury depends on the severity of the wound. Following one application of Tamoxifen/DMSO solution no adverse effects are observed in the mice.  In case of repeated applications corneal opacity can be observed.  \nContinue with tissue preparation and imaging (see sections 5 and 6) at relevant time points. For the results shown here, sacrifice the mice (as detailed in stage 5.1) one week post wounding (Figure 2 and 24)."
