  "procedures": [
    "The following procedures were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the caregivers of all infants. We recruited infants being raised in environments with more than 50% exposure to English11,17. Infants in all experiments first listened to a soundtrack in which we manipulated their exposure to either lemur vocalizations or backward speech; they then participated in an object categorization task. What varied across infants was (a) the kind of signal they heard in the exposure manipulation and the categorization task (either lemur vocalizations or backward speech) and (b) the extent of the exposure phase (either brief exposure in the lab or prolonged exposure at home). For all infants, the categorization task took place in the lab.\n1. Materials\nHow to create the exposure manipulations\nSelect 8 distinct samples of lemur vocalizations and 8 distinct samples of backward speech, each 2 to 4 s in duration. Together, the 8 samples should yield 30 s of each acoustic signal. Ensure that the lemur and backward speech segments are matched as closely as possible for duration (e.g., ~3 s in duration) and for mean frequency (e.g., ~300 Hz).\n\t\t\nTo obtain lemur vocalizations, search a database of animal vocalizations or contact a researcher who collects animal vocalizations.\nTo create backward speech segments, use a laptop and a software program (e.g., Audacity) to (1) record a research assistant speaking ~3 s sentences in infant-directed speech and (2) temporally reverse (in Audacity: Effect > Reverse) each speech segment.\nChoose a piece of classical instrumental music that is longer than 4 min. Here, we used the first 4 min of Beethoven's String Quartet in C Minor, Op 18 No. 4: III. Menuetto.",
    "Use an audio editing software program (e.g., Audacity) to import the music (in Audacity: File > Import) and select a portion of the piece that is approximately 4 min in duration (highlight and delete the remainder of the piece).\n\t\t\nCreate 2 distinct soundtracks by inserting (i.e., copying and pasting) the 8 selected segments of each type (lemur vocalizations or backward speech) into the musical soundtrack.\nTo create the \"Lemur\" soundtrack, open the 8 lemur vocalization sound files in the same software program (e.g., Audacity) and insert them into the file with the music.\n\t\t\t\nTo do so, highlight an entire lemur vocalization, navigate to Edit > Copy, place the cursor in the music file, and navigate to Edit > Paste. Insert the vocalizations at irregular intervals throughout the soundtrack. Do not place them at musical phrase boundaries. Do this twice for each lemur vocalization, inserting them in a pseudorandomized order to ensure that no 2 identical vocalizations occur in a row. Together, this yields a 5 min loop (4 min of music, interspersed with 1 min of lemur vocalizations).\nRepeat this 5 min soundtrack so that the entire soundtrack lasts approximately 10 min. To do so, highlight the entire 5 min section, navigate to Edit > Copy, place the cursor at the end of the 5-min section, and navigate to Edit > Paste.\nTo create the 10 min \"Backward Speech\" soundtrack, replace each lemur vocalization in the Lemur soundtrack with a selected segment of backward speech, using the same pseudorandomized order.\nHow to create the categorization task",
    "Visual materials: Create 2 sets of line drawings by hand. In each set, include 9 members of the same object category (here, use 9 distinct drawings of dinosaurs and 9 distinct drawings of fish). Use a different bright color for each drawing within a given category. Scan these drawings onto a computer and save them as image files. Note that the drawings should be unfamiliar objects to infants at the ages tested.\nAcoustic materials: Select one lemur vocalization and one backward speech segment that were not included in either of the exposure manipulations (1.1.3). Match the lemur and backward speech segments as closely as possible for duration (e.g., ~3 s in duration) and for mean frequency (e.g., ~300 Hz).\nProgram a task in MATLAB that includes a familiarization phase and a test phase; this task will be projected onto a 5 ft by 5 ft screen in front of the infant.\n\t\t\nProgram the familiarization phase such that 8 of the visual exemplars from a single category (e.g., 8 dinosaurs, each a different color) appear sequentially. Each exemplar should appear for 20 s, on either the right or left side of a screen, in alternating fashion. Create 2 distinct versions, pairing each familiarization exemplar with one of the acoustic stimuli below (\"Lemur\" and \"Backward Speech\" conditions, respectively). In both conditions, the acoustic stimulus should occur twice on each familiarization trial; once when the visual exemplar appears, and once again 10 s later.\n\t\t\t\nIn the Lemur condition, program each familiarization exemplar to appear simultaneously with a lemur vocalization.\nIn the Backward Speech condition, program each familiarization exemplar to appear simultaneously with a backward speech segment.",
    "During the test phase, present the 9th exemplar from the familiar category (e.g., another dinosaur) and an exemplar from the other category (e.g., a fish). These two images should be identical in color and presented simultaneously (one presented on the right and the other on the left side of the screen) in silence for 20 s.\nIn programming the categorization task, counterbalance (1) which category will be presented during the familiarization phase, (2) the side on which the first familiarization image will appear, and (3) the side on which the novel and familiar test images will appear.\n2. General Procedures\nExposure phase\nPlace the infant close to the caregiver or on their lap in a quiet area. Place a laptop or tablet within the infant's viewing range (from 1 to 4 ft from the infant).\nUse the laptop or tablet to present either the Lemur or the Backward Speech soundtrack.\nCategorization task\nIn a semi-darkened test room in the lab, seat the caregiver on a chair 4 ft from a 5 ft by 5 ft screen. Connect the laptop with the categorization task programmed in MATLAB to (1) the screen that will display the categorization task and (2) a projector that will project the task onto the screen.\nSeat the infant on the caregiver's lap, facing forward.\nInstruct the caregiver to avoid influencing the infant's behavior in any way. More specifically, instruct them to remain quiet and still throughout the duration of the task and to keep their infant centered, using their midline as a guide. Provide caregivers with a pair of blacked-out glasses to ensure that they cannot see the visual materials.\nTurn on the projector.\nTurn on recording equipment to capture the infants' behavior throughout the task.",
    "Begin the categorization task by pressing \"Run\" in MATLAB: Present the Lemur condition if the infant was exposed to the Lemur soundtrack and the Backward Speech condition if the infant was exposed to the Backward Speech soundtrack.\nCoding (categorization task only)\nCode the onset and offset of each infant's left and right looks during both the familiarization and test phases.\nExclude infants who (1) look at fewer than 6 of the familiarization exemplars; (2) look during less than 40% of the familiarization phase. Also exclude infants if there is parental interference, experimental error or technical failure, or if their performance at test is greater than 2 SD from the mean.\nAnalyses\nFor the familiarization phase, calculate the total the amount of time each infant looked at the familiarization objects.\nFor the test phase, calculate a preference score for each infant: (total looking time to novel test image)/(total looking time to both test images).\n3. Experiment 1: Brief Exposure to Lemur Vocalizations\nParticipants\nRecruit 14 infants at 6 to 7 months of age.\nProcedure\nInvite the caregiver and infant into a quiet, comfortable room. In our lab, this room is adjacent to the testing room.\nExposure manipulation: Play the Lemur soundtrack once, with the music visualizer (e.g., iTunes) present on the screen.\nCategorization task: When the soundtrack finishes, guide the caregiver and infant into the testing room. Begin the categorization task (Lemur condition).\n4. Experiment 2: Brief Exposure to Backward Speech\nParticipants\nIdentical to Experiment 1.\nProcedure\nInvite the caregiver and infant into a quiet, comfortable room.\nExposure manipulation: Play the Backward Speech soundtrack once, with the music visualizer present on the screen.\nCategorization task: When the soundtrack finishes, guide the caregiver and infant into the testing room. Begin the categorization task (Backward Speech condition).",
    "5. Experiment 3: Prolonged Exposure to Lemur Vocalizations\nParticipants\nRecruit 14 infants at 4.5 months of age.\nProcedure\nBy phone, invite the caregiver to participate in a 6 week long study. Explain that the study requires them to expose their infant, at home, to a 10 min soundtrack that contains 8 min of music and 2 min of lemur vocalizations (i.e., Lemur soundtrack). Explain that the study lasts for 6 weeks, beginning when the infant is 4.5 months and ending when the infant is 6 months of age.\nProvide caregivers with this precise tapering schedule7,8,18\nWeek 1: Play the soundtrack to infant once a day, every day.\nWeek 2: Play the soundtrack to infant once every other day.\nWeek 3: Play the soundtrack to infant 3 times during the week.\nWeeks 4-6: Play the soundtrack to infant 2 times per week.\nTo ensure the fidelity of the exposure manipulation throughout the 6 week exposure manipulation, share with caregivers an online interactive document that (a) outlines their role at every step throughout the 6 week period and (b) asks them to record each date and time at which they played the soundtrack to their infant.\nSend weekly reminders by phone or email to keep caregivers engaged and on track.\nDuring Week 5, schedule a lab visit for the following week (Week 6). Instruct caregivers that infants should listen to the soundtrack 2 to 4 days before their scheduled lab visit; infants should not listen to the soundtrack either on the day of or the day preceding their visit.\n\t\tNOTE: At the lab visit, there is no exposure manipulation: Infants participate only in the categorization task from Experiment 1 (Lemur condition).\nSubscription Required.
