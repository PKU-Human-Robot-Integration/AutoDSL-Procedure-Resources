    "**Coating of coverslips** \\(for BLISS in cells)\n1. Place the coverslips in a 10 cm dish, cover them with 5 ml PLL solution, and then gently shake the dishes for 15 min \n  **Note**: make sure that coverslips stay covered by liquid\n2. Aspirate the solution and transfer it into a 15 ml tube\n  **Note**: the solution can be then used up to three times\n3. Wash the coverslips three times with 1× PBS at room temperature \\(rt) and once with ethanol \\(EtOH) 70%\n  4. Air-dry the coverslips and proceed with cell spotting and fixation\n  **Breakpoint**: if not used immediately, coverslips can be stored in EtOH 70% at 4 °C and air-dried just before use.\n**Attachment and fixation of suspension cells** \\(for BLISS in cells)\n1. Place the desired number of PLL-coated coverslips into a 24-well cell culture plate\n  2. In each well, dispense a cell suspension freshly prepared in 1× PBS\n  **Note**: we usually spot up to 3×10<sup>5</sup> cells onto a 13 mm coverslip\n3. Let the cells sediment onto the coverslip for 10 min at rt\n  4. Slowly add one volume of PFA 8% in 1× PBS equal to the volume of cell suspension added before onto the coverslip\n  5. Incubate for 10 min at rt\n  6. Rinse the coverslips twice with 1× PBS at rt\n  7. Store the samples in 1× PBS at 4 °C or proceed to permeabilization\n  **Breakpoint**: fixed cells can be stored at 4 °C for several days up to a month. To avoid bacterial contamination, cells should be stored in 1× PBS supplemented with NaN<sub>3</sub> 0.05%.\n**Transfection and fixation of HEK cells in multi-well plates** \\(for CRISPR-BLISS)\n1. Coat a 24-well cell culture plate with PDL following the same procedure used for coating coverslips with PLL\n  2. Seed ~1.25×10<sup>5</sup> HEK 293T cells per well",

Embed the tissue fragments in OCT and quickly freeze them at –20 °C before cryosectioning\n  9. Section the block into 30 μm slices, mounting them onto microscope slides\n  10. Air-dry the sections for 60 min at rt \n  11. Store the sections at 4 °C or proceed to permeabilization\n  \n**Preparation of nuclei suspension from liver biopsies** \\(for tissue-BLISS)\n1.
