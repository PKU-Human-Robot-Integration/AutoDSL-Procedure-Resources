    "This protocol details the use of the Search interface to query specific genes, transcripts, or proteins. The interface is optimized to accommodate many questions that a researcher may have. For example, a researcher may want to know if a specific gene contains novel ORFs with supporting experimental evidence or whether a given transcript may contain several ORFs. The protocol will guide novice users in how to exploit the Search interface of the OpenProt resource. First, the protocol describes how to navigate to the Search interface from the homepage. Then, it details the features available on the interface to tailor the results to any query. Finally, the protocol explains how to investigate a specific ORF of interest.\nNecessary Resources\nOpenProt is accessible via all major web browsers supporting JavaScript, such as Safari, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer. All pages can be viewed on mobile phones, but the interfaces have been optimized for display on computers or tablets. The Search interface is designed for exploration of specific genes, transcripts, and/or proteins. The interface is accessible via the homepage by clicking on the “Search” tab or can be accessed directly at https://openprot.org/p/altorfDbView[href=https://openprot.org/p/altorfDbView]. The Downloads interface is designed for custom downloads of any data in the OpenProt resource (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-prot-0002]). The interface is accessible via the homepage by clicking on the “Downloads” tab or can be accessed directly at https://openprot.org/p/download[href=https://openprot.org/p/download]. Each protein annotated in OpenProt has a dedicated page containing a genome browser and all supporting information.\nNavigating from the homepage to the Search interface\n1. Visit OpenProt homepage (https://openprot.org/[href=https://openprot.org/]).\nThe homepage contains general information about the web server, the reasons to use OpenProt, links to detailed manuscript and video tutorials, and an overview of the concept and the methods behind OpenProt.",

Use main filters to define a search.",
    "The Search interface is accessed either directly at https://openprot.org/p/altorfDbView[href=https://openprot.org/p/altorfDbView] or through the homepage, as described in step 2. The interface is pictured in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-fig-0002], where the main filters are indicated by green circles, additional filters by orange squares, and sorting and downloading options by yellow triangles. This page is designed to allow the user to query specific proteins or the coding potential of specific transcripts and/or genes.\nAll the filters are described, with additional notes, in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-tbl-0003]. OpenProt supports annotation for 10 species (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus, Ovis aries, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c). Use the species filter to select them all or pick one in particular. When a species is selected, by default, the latest assembly will be chosen. OpenProt supports both Ensembl and NCBI RefSeq (O'Leary et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0023]; Yates et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0036]), which allows a more exhaustive representation of the proteome given the poor overlap between the two annotations (Brunet et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0007]). By default, the combination of the two annotations is selected to favor exploration and discoveries (Wu, Phan, & Wang, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0034]). Use the annotation drop-down menu to select either annotation independently (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-fig-0002], Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-tbl-0003]).\nNote that if “all species” is selected, OpenProt will automatically use the latest genome assemblies as well as the latest of both the Ensembl and the NCBI RefSeq annotations for each species.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/85a02d51-c2c9-4a9f-97d7-1f71d2a2d814/cpbi103-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nOpenProt Search interface.

For each tab, green circles mark the main features and the corresponding descriptions.\n10. Use genome browser to visualize the queried protein and the associated transcript.\nThe peptides detected by mass spectrometry and assigned to the queried protein are displayed in the peptide track (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-fig-0004], Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-tbl-0005]). Keyboard shortcuts to control the genome browser can be visualized by clicking on the question mark at the top right corner.\n11. See summary table located below the genome browser to view general information on the queried protein.",
    "This table is restricted to both the queried protein and the search criteria defined on the Search interface. For example, if the search was restricted to the Ensembl annotation (as in the example shared above), only Ensembl transcripts will be listed in this table. However, if we did not limit the search to the Ensembl annotation, transcripts from the NCBI RefSeq annotation will also be included in the main table of results and in the info tab of each page dedicated to a protein (this example can be accessed at https://openprot.org/p/savedSearch/NCa[href=https://openprot.org/p/savedSearch/NCa]).\nIn OpenProt, the unicity of entries is on the protein sequence. Thus, if two transcripts of one gene each contain an ORF coding for the exact same amino acid sequence, then the protein accession will be identical, and both transcripts will be listed in the general information table. However, if an alternatively spliced transcript leads to an isoform of the queried protein, this isoform will have a different protein accession, and the transcript will not be listed in the general information table for the queried protein.\n12. Click on “mass spectrometry” tab to review experimental detection of the queried protein in mass spectrometry–based proteomic datasets.",
    "The number displayed on the tab corresponds to the MS score, defined as the sum of unique peptides detected per study (Brunet et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0007]). This tab provides an overview of all peptides detected by re-analysis of mass spectrometry datasets by OpenProt. To ensure confident detection of novel proteins, OpenProt adheres to stringent peptide assignation rules. As such, if a peptide can be assigned to two proteins on different genes, it is discarded as unassigned. In the example search shared above (https://openprot.org/p/savedSearch/LCa[href=https://openprot.org/p/savedSearch/LCa]), we have the known MCTS1 protein (Q9ULC4) and a predicted altProt (IP_662512) in the MCTS1 paralog, the MCTS2P pseudogene, which have high homology (>95%) and thus share many possible peptides detectable by mass spectrometry. However, due to the aforementioned assignation rule, these two proteins cumulate only unique peptides in OpenProt. In a more complex case where a peptide can be assigned to two proteins from the same gene, the major rule is as follows: if at least one refProt is among the possibilities, the peptide will always be assigned to the refProt(s). This ensures that when a novel protein predicted by OpenProt (novel isoform or altProt) is indicated as detected by mass spectrometry, it is with a unique peptide that does not match any refProt (from the same gene or not).\n13. Click on “translation” tab to review experimental detection of translation of the queried ORF in ribosome profiling datasets.",
    "The number displayed on the tab corresponds to the TE score, defined as the sum of studies with at least one significant detection of ORF translation (Brunet et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0007]). This tab provides an overview of all studies and samples in which translation of the queried ORF was detected by re-analysis of ribosome profiling datasets by OpenProt. OpenProt uses an ORF prediction algorithm, PRICE, to analyze ribosome profiling datasets (Erhard et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0012]). All ribosomal data (elongating and initiating footprints) are combined to estimate the ORF most likely to produce such a set of footprints. Thus, for each detection in a study, OpenProt can assign a confidence to the initiating codon and a p-value to the ORF detection itself (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-fig-0005]).\n14. Click on “domains” tab to review prediction of functional domains for the queried protein using multiple domain annotation databases.\nThe number displayed on the tab corresponds to the Domains score, defined as the sum of functional domains predicted from the protein sequence (Brunet et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0007]). This tab provides an overview of all domains predicted as well as the database in which each domain is described.\n15. Click on “conservation” tab to review conservation of the queried protein across species supported by OpenProt.",
    "The number displayed on the tab corresponds to the Conservation score, defined as the sum of all species supported by OpenProt with at least one ortholog (Brunet et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-bib-0007]). This tab provides an overview of all orthologs and paralogs of the queried protein detected by the OpenProt conservation analysis. Two trees are accessible on the page (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.103#cpbi103-fig-0005]): the first one lists all the orthologs per species, whereas the second one lists all paralogs. An ortholog is defined as a protein with a significant homology of sequence in another species from that of the queried protein. A paralog is defined as a protein with a significant homology of sequence in the same species but in a different gene than that of the queried protein. Each protein accession displayed on both the orthologs and the paralogs tree is clickable to navigate to the OpenProt page dedicated to this protein.",
    "This protocol details the use of the Downloads interface to retrieve a large amount of data stored in the OpenProt resource. The interface is optimized to obtain custom downloads for specific research questions.
