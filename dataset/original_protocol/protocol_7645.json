    "Cultivation of hydrogenase-expressing bacteria In this protocol, a recombinant E. coli encoding hydA, hydE, hydF, and hydG genes for hydrogenase expression was utilized as a H2-producing model constructed in our laboratory as reported in Honda et al. (2016) and Kosem et al. (2023).Note: This protocol can be applied to determine the efficiency of other hydrogenase-producing bacteria, as reported in Benoit et al. (2020) and Kosem et al. (2024). Aerobically pre-culture the recombinant E. coli in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with 200 mL of LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin sodium, 40 μg/mL of streptomycin sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) of glucose, 250 μg/mL of ferric ammonium citrate, and 100 mM MOPS/NaOH pH 7.4. Incubate the pre-culture flask at 37 °C placed on a shaking incubator at 120 rpm until the cell density reaches an optical density of 0.4 at OD600, monitored by a spectrophotometer using a 1 mL cell suspension in a disposable cuvette. Then, transfer the 200 mL pre-cultured E. coli suspension into a 250 mL centrifuge bottle inside an anaerobic glove box supplemented with 2 mM L-cysteine (50 mg), 20 mM sodium fumarate (4 mL of 1 M stock solution), and 1 mM IPTG (0.2 mL of 1 M stock solution), and further incubate for 18 h in the glove box for [FeFe]-hydrogenase expression (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4895/bioprotoc-13-23-4895-g002.jpgFigure 2. Experimental process of MV2+-dependent hydrogenase activity Cell harvesting and preparation In the glove box, transfer 200 mL of cell suspension cultivated in LB medium from the Erlenmeyer flask to a centrifuge bottle with a silicone cap to preserve an anaerobic environment.Centrifuge the bottle at 2,000× g for 10 min, discard the supernatant, and collect cell pellet.Wash the cell pellet once with 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution and centrifuge at 2,000× g for 10 min.",
    "To prepare cell suspension for experiments, resuspend the washed cell pellet in 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution (Figure 2A).To standardize the protocol, the concentration of cells used in the reaction is based on total protein contents measured by PierceTM BCA Protein Assay kit in a 96-well plate.Note: The protocol can be modified when different bacterial strains or biological samples are used. Hydrogenase activity assay Degas all chemical reagents with pure N2 for 5 min and place them in the anaerobic glove box before use.Prepare the following reagents as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2B.Table 1. Reaction mixture preparation of MV•+-hydrogenase activity assay table:",

    "Notes:  The reaction mixture is prepared in a 10 mL glass vial and sealed with a rubber stopper and aluminum cap inside the glove box. The protein concentration can be adjusted in different samples. In case of a negative control, the same volume of sterile water is added instead of cell suspension or extracts. The reduced MV•+ solution is prepared in a separate vial and sealed with a rubber stopper and aluminum cap inside the glove box. Take the reaction vial and the MV•+ vial out of the glove box.Purge the contaminated gases in each vial with pure N2 for 5 min.Initiate the reaction by adding 0.2 mL of 50 mM MV2+/Na2S2O4 solution into the reaction vial using a 1 mL syringe with needle No. 27 G × 3/4\" and further incubate in a shaking water bath at 100 rpm and 37 °C.Note: The reaction mixture turns dark blue after adding MV2+/Na2S2O4 solution into the reaction vial. Every 20 min after incubation, terminate the reaction vial by adding 0.1 mL of 100% TCA (concentration of the commercial stock solution) using a 1 mL syringe with needle No. 27 G × 3/4\".Sample 1 mL of H2 produced in a headspace of the reaction vial using a 1 mL gas tight syringe and vertically inject into a gas chromatograph for analysis. Here, a GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductive detector and an integrator C-R6A chromatopac was used. The produced gas goes through molecular sieve 5A beads packed in a stainless steel column (2 m length × 3 mm diameter) with a carrier gas of argon. Operating parameters are shown in Table 2.Table 2.
