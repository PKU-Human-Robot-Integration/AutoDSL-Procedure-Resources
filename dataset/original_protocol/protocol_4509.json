    "Preparation of sterile dialysis membrane tubingFill three 2-Liter Pyrex beakers as follows:Beaker 1: 1 - 1.5 L Ultrapure waterBeaker 2: 1 - 1.5 L 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)Beaker 3: 1 - 1.5 L Ultrapure waterAdd a magnetic stir bar to each beaker, cover with heavy-duty aluminum foil and autoclave. Note: To ensure sterility, beakers should be autoclaved on the same day at the procedure.Place each beaker on hot plate and bring to a rolling boil with constant stirring. Wearing sterile gloves, cut dialysis membrane tubing into strips 7-9 inches (~18-23 cm) in length using sterile scissors. Cut one strip per animal plus 1-2 extra. Gently tie off one end of the tubing using a simple overhand knot by forming a loop at the top of the DMC and passing the free end of the tubing through the loop. Trim away excess tubing from the tied end using sterile scissors.Place the tied tubing into Beaker 1 and replace the aluminum foil cover. Be sure to keep the foil cover loose enough to allow steam to escape. Boil tubing for 20 min. with constant stirring. Note: Tubing should remain submerged at all times. Using sterile extra-long forceps, transfer tubing to Beaker 2. Replace aluminum foil cover and boil tubing for 20 min. with constant stirring.Repeat step A7 using Beaker 3. Once cool to the touch, transfer Beaker 3 to a Biological safety cabinet (BSC). To ensure sterility, the beaker containing the tubing should remain in the BSC. Note: Dialysis membrane tubing may be prepared several days in advance and stored at 4 °C. After boiling, transfer dialysis membrane tubing to the bottom portion of a 0.22 µm Stericup® Filter Unit (Millipore) using sterile blunt tip forceps.",
    "Replace the filter unit top and filter in ~100-200 ml of Ultrapure-Q water from Beaker 3. Seal the bottom portion of the filter unit using the sterile cap provided by the manufacturer. The container should be opened only within the BSC. Preparation of leptospiresUse a standard low passage in vitro culture of virulent L. interrogans, kept at 28-30 °C in EMJH medium, before it reaches stationary phase in the growth curve.Just prior to starting the surgical procedure, count bacteria by dark field microscopy.Dilute culture to 106 organisms/ml using fresh EMJH medium. Working in the BSC, transfer 10 ml of EMJH+BSA to sterile 50-ml conical tubes. Prepare one conical tube per DMC. Note: It is important that the EMJH medium used for DMCs is supplemented with additional BSA to maintain the appropriate osmotic pressure.Add 0.1 ml of dilute culture to each 50-ml conical tube containing EMJH+BSA medium (Final density, 104 organisms/ml).Preparation of DMCsWorking in the BSC, place several disposable, individually-wrapped serological pipets within the surgical field. Lay down a sterile drape to use as a workspace. Clean the surface of an automatic pipeter using 70% ethanol and place on the sterile drape. After donning a new pair of sterile surgical gloves, loosen the cap of a 50-ml conical tube. While still wearing gloves, carefully remove a strip of tubing from its storage container using blunt end forceps. Use your free hand to hold the tubing between index finger and thumb. With other hand, remove the cap from the 50-ml conical tube containing diluted bacteria and transfer up to 9 mls to the tubing using a 10-ml disposable serological pipette. While continuing to hold the open end, flatten the unfilled tubing between the fingers of your free hand to eliminate any air bubbles.",
    "Gently twist the top end of the tubing (1-2 turns) to remove any remaining void volume and close off the top of the DMC Use your thumb and index finger to hold on to the twisted area to prevent liquid from leaking out of the DMC while you tie off the top. Tie off the open end using a simple overhand knot (e.g., form a loop at the top of the DMC, passing the free end of the tubing through the loop, then, without releasing your thumb and index finger, gently tighten the knot). Trim away excess tubing from the tied end using sterile scissors.Note: Try to make the DMC as taut as possible; this will help to maneuver the chamber into the peritoneal cavity during surgery. The resulting filled DMC should be ~1.5 - 2 in. Larger DMCs may interfere with normal intestinal or bladder functions. Place the filled DMC into a sterile 50-ml conical tube containing ~5-7 ml of fresh EMJH+ BSA medium. Repeat steps C3-4 until all bags are filled then proceed directly to the surgical procedure. Note: It is not recommended that filled dialysis membrane chambers be stored for extended periods of time as this may increase the risk of contamination. Peritoneal implantation procedure.Anesthetize animal by intramuscular injection with the ketamine/xylazine cocktail.Apply a small amount of ophthalmic ointment to each eye.Administer preoperative analgesia (e.g., Carprofen).Shave the abdomen and prepare surgical site (e.g., successive washes with Betadine® Surgical solution followed by alcohol). Cover the surgical site with sterile gauze and transfer the animal to the BSC in a supine position.Prior to beginning the procedure, remove the sterile gauze covering the surgical site and perform a ‘toe pinch’ to ensure that the animal is properly anesthetized.",
    "Using a sterile scalpel blade, make a 5 cm incision through the skin only, starting ~2.5 cm below the ribcage, using the xiphoid process as a guide. Using tissue forceps, pull up the skin on either side of the incision and gently trim the fascia connecting the skin to the abdominal wall using a scalpel. Repeat on the other side.Use the same scalpel, make a small incision (~4 cm) in the abdominal wall, using the linea alba as guide. The incision should be clean and straight.Using tissue forceps, raise one side of the abdominal incision and place a DMC inside rat peritoneal cavity (Figure 1). Gently push the DMC towards either side of the peritoneal cavity to prevent it from being nicked/ruptured during suturing. Be sure to position so that it does not become entangled in the intestines or interfere with bladder expansion.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150718/20150718001334_4704.jpgFigure 1. Implantation of DMC into rat peritoneal cavityClose the abdominal incision site by suturing. Begin by suturing each end of the incision with double knots. Working upwards, close the remaining incision by placing sutures ~2-3 mm apart.Close the skin incision site using a contiguous line of AutoClip® wound clips (Figure 2). Note: Alternatively, the skin excision site may be closed using subcuticular stitches followed by liquid skin adhesive (e.g., Nexaband). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150718/20150718001404_9529.jpgFigure 2. Closing the skin incisionPlace the rat on top of a clean surgical drape in a clean cage containing fresh bedding. Place the cage on top of a circulating water heating pad to maintain the appropriate core body temperature. Monitor the animal continuously until alert and responsive. Analgesia should be administered for at least two days post-operatively.Animals should be monitored at least once daily for the first week post-operatively and then every other day thereafter.",
    "If animals show any sign of distress or discomfort, consult institutional veterinary staff immediately.Recovery of mammalian host adapted organisms from DMCsAt 9 to 12 days after implantation, euthanize animals by CO2 asphyxiation. Place animal in a BSC in a supine position. Using sterile surgical scissors, expose the abdominal wall.Using sterile tissue forceps, lift one side of the sutured abdominal incision site and re-open using sterile scissors. Locate and remove the DMC using blunt-end forceps. Transfer to a sterile 50-ml conical tube. Using sterile forceps to hold the DMC by one knot, make a small cut in the tubing just below the knot. Slowly remove the contents of the DMC using a sterile disposable serological pipet. Transfer the DMC fluid to a sterile 15-ml conical tube. Alternatively, DMC contents can be removed using a syringe 18-G, 1 in. needle attached to a sterile 10-ml syringe. However, aspiration of leptospires by syringe may disrupt cells and/or cause cell lysis. Examine a small aliquot of the contents DMC fluid from each chamber under dark field microscopy.Proceed to downstream applications (e.g., RNA isolation, analysis by 1D and 2D SDS-PAGE)."
