    "All procedures performed here were submitted to and approved by the Animal Care and Use committee and were conducted following NIH guidelines.\n1. Object Selection and Experimental Setup\nSelect objects that are different enough to be easily discriminated by mice, but have a similar degree of complexity (texture, shape, color patterning and brightness, etc.) in order to minimize any potential induced object preference that may bias the results (see Ennaceur 2010 for a comprehensive description of object choice7).\nTest for innate preference and discrimination (see Steps 2 & 3).\nUse objects that are mouse-sized or only slightly larger to encourage exploration (Figure 1). To reduce induced preference, ensure that mice are able to climb on both objects or neither object, though ability to climb on an object may increase interest in exploration (time spent just sitting on an object is not counted towards exploration time.)\nHave at least 2 copies of each object. However, to minimize potential odor cues during testing, have at least 3 of each object, duplicates for training and one for testing.\nUse objects made of non-breakable material, as loss of an object due to damage during experimentation could interfere with the continuity of testing, and potentially cause harm or injury to the animal.\nThoroughly clean the objects before and between use (70% vol/vol ethanol is appropriate).\nTo minimize the stress of bright lighting, use diffuse, low lighting, with the center of the maze illuminated around 20 lux. Use a temperature and humidity similar to regular housing conditions. If mice are being moved from a housing room to a different room for the experiment, acclimate mice to their new room for at least 1 h prior to use each day.",
    "Handle mice well prior to training. Because the test relies on the natural tendency of rodents to explore novelty, reduce any stress or anxiety from handling that may interfere with their desire to explore the arena, and subsequently, the objects. Ideally, handle mice 1 - 2 times/day for at least 1 min, 1 to 2 weeks prior to testing15,29.\nFor the main arena, use a square chamber (around 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm) made from white or black, non-porous plastic, contrasted to the color of the mouse. Alternatively, use a round arena ed. Specifically, when using anxious mice that may sit in the corners of a square arena, a round arena may be preferable to encourage exploratory behavior18,30.\nOn training day, place 2 identical objects on the diagonal (i.e. one in the NW corner and one in the SE corner). If objects are too light and can be moved by the mouse, fasten them to the floor. Removable mounting putty works well.\nFor testing day, use the 3rd copy of each object to place one familiar object and one novel object on the same diagonal as the training day (Figure 2).\nCounterbalance the use of each set of objects so that each object is used equally as a familiar object and as a novel object. Also, counterbalance the location of the novel object to each of the 4 corners of the arena. Be sure to note which diagonal is used for which animal so that the diagonal used on the training day is the same as that used on the testing day, for each mouse.\nThoroughly clean the apparatus and objects to remove odor cues before and between use (70% vol/vol ethanol is appropriate).",
    "Place the camera directly overhead of the apparatus for optimal view of exploration. Only use software with nose-point detection for accurate analysis. If using software, capture a background image with the objects in place prior to starting. In the software, set the area of exploration to be approximately 2 - 3 cm around the object.\nTo reduce experimenter interference, record the trial and score it later. Blind the scorer to the experimental conditions. If manually scoring during the experiment, ensure that the experimenter is more than 1 meter from the arena, and not visible to the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Any time the mouse spends sitting on the object without active vibrissae sweeping or sniffing does not count as exploration time.\nDefine exploration as when the mouse's noise is pointed towards the object and within 2 - 3 cm of the object, with active vibrissae sweeping or sniffing. Do not count any time sitting on the object without indication of active exploration.\n2. Necessary Pilot Experiments\nTesting for induced preference\nFor habituation, remove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open arena. Allow the mouse to freely explore for 5 min.\nOn Training Day (T1), place 2 different objects in opposite quadrants of the apparatus, (i.e., NW and SE corners). Remove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open arena. Allow free exploration for 10 min.\nCalculate the discrimination index. If there is no induced preference, the discrimination index should be at or near zero. Any objects that show preference should not be used for ORT.\nTesting for discrimination ability\nFor habituation, remove mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open arena. Allow the mouse to freely explore for 5 min.",
    "On Training Session (T1), place 2 identical objects in opposite quadrants. Place the mouse in the center of the arena and allow the mouse to explore for 10 min.\nOn Testing Session (T2), place one of the object used during T1 and one novel object in opposite quadrants (i.e., NW and SE corners). Sixty min after T1, place the mouse in the center of the arena and allow free exploration for 10 min.\nCalculate the discrimination index. At a 60 min retention interval, the discrimination index should be above 0.25.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nHabituation\nRemove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open, empty arena. Allow for free exploration of the arena for 5 min. Once the home cage is empty, save it for use as a holding cage the next day.\nAt the end of 5 min, remove the mouse and place in a holding cage. Do not return the mouse to its original cage, or this may affect the behavior of the remaining mice to be tested.\nThoroughly clean the apparatus between mice using 70% vol/vol ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: During habituation, anxiety-like behavior can be assessed by calculating time spent in the center (see Prut & Belzung 200331). This is a useful metric when considering the length of time for T1. Higher anxiety mice may require a 10 min session to reach the minimum exploration criterion.\nTraining (T1)\nPlace two identical objects in opposite quadrants of the arena (i.e., NE corner and SW corner).\n24 h after habituation, remove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the center of the arena, equidistant from the 2 identical objects.",
    "Allow free exploration for a minimum of 5 min. If using a strain of mice that are known to have low locomotor or exploration activity, (i.e., most mice do not reach a minimum of 20 s exploration of both objects by 5 min, as noted in the pilot experiments or the literature), extend the trial to 10 min for all mice in the cohort.\nAt the end of the trial, remove the mouse and place in the holding cage. Once the home cage is empty, save it for use as the holding cage on testing day.\nThoroughly clean the apparatus and objects between mice using 70% vol/vol ethanol.\nTesting (T2)\nPlace one object used during T1 (i.e., the familiar object) and one novel object in opposite quadrants of the arena. Use the same locations as used during T1 for each mouse.\nAt the T1 to T2 interval of choosing, remove mouse from its home cage and place it in the center arena, equidistant from the familiar object and the novel object.\n\t\tNOTE: At a retention interval of 24 h, most mice will not be able to discriminate between the familiar and novel object (usually -0.2 < d2 < 0.2, as compared to a positive control32). If testing for nootropic effects, use this time point to probe for memory enhancement. To probe for memory deficits, use a shorter retention interval of anywhere between 20 min to 4 h, depending on the strain of mouse.\nAllow free exploration for 10 min. At the end of the trial, remove the mouse and place in the holding cage.",
    "For both T1 and T2, score the first 5 min. If the mouse does not meet the minimum exploration time of 20 s for both objects, continue scoring past 5 min until total exploration exceeds 20 s.\n4. Data Analysis\nExclusion Criteria\nDuring both training (T1) and testing (T2), calculate the total exploration time for both objects for each session (e1 and e2). Most mice should reach a minimum exploration total for both objects of 20 s by 5 min.\nExtend T1 and T2 time to 10 min for strains of mice that have low exploration and do not meet this minimum criterion by 5 min, as observed during pilot testing.\nScore behavior for 5 min or beyond 5 min until they reach the 20 s minimum criterion.\nIf mice do not reach a 20 s minimum of exploration for both objects for either T1 or T2 at 10 min, exclude from analysis, as it cannot be confirmed they spent enough time exploring to learn/discriminate.\nAbsolute vs Relative Analysis\n\tNOTE: Different formulas for analysis and their relationship to one another can be seen in Table 1.\n\t\nCalculate e1 as the total exploration time during training for 2 identical objects, where a1 and a2 are the identical objects.\ne1 = a1 + a2\nCalculate e2 as the total exploration time during testing for the familiar object (a) and the novel object (b).\ne2 = a+b\nCalculate d1 as simply the time spent exploring the novel object minus time spent exploring the familiar object. The absolute discrimination measure (d1) does not take into account differences in exploration time between mice or treatment groups, though in certain circumstances, it may be a more sensitive measure2.\nd1 = b-a",
    "Calculate d2 as the time spent exploring the novel object minus the time spent exploring the familiar object divided by total exploration time. The most commonly used measure is a relative discrimination value often referred to as the discrimination index (d2), which is not influenced by differences in exploration time. This means all values will fall between -1 and +1.\nd2 = d1/e2\nAlternatively, calculate the recognition or preference index (d3)3. This is the time spent exploring the novel object divided by the total time. This means all values will fall between 0 and 1. It is often multiplied by 100 and used as percentage value.\nd3 = b/e2*100\nStatistical Analysis\nUsing the mean discrimination values for each group, determine memory performance using one-way ANOVA. For further analysis, make two-way post hoc comparisons with the treated vs vehicle condition and positive/negative control groups.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
