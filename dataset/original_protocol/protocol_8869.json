    "Perform all procedures and protocols involving animals in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The procedures described here were reviewed and approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nReplication-incompetent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for transgene delivery in the rodent brain are approved for Biosafety Level 1 use. Refer to the CDC website for the US Government publication “Biosafety in Microbiology and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL)” which details specific requirements regarding proper protection and virus handling procedures. Check with local veterinary and environmental safety staff to learn institutional specific requirements for procedures using viruses. Regulations regarding procedure rooms, quarantine, and identification of biohazard cages vary across institutions.\n1. Prepare P0 Pups and Foster Mothers\nProvide high fat chow for all pregnant and nursing females to support the energy demands of breeding and lactation.\nIn the evening, set up a breeding cage by adding one or two healthy females to the cage of a single resident male. The following morning, check the females for a mating plug and separate the females from the males if a plug is present.\n\t\nUse foster mothers to raise pups from a genetic background with poor maternal characteristics (for example, C57BL/6 or C3HeJ). Foster mothers accept pups from another litter if the transferred pups are born within four days of the foster mother’s own litter.\nSet up a separate mating cage using ICR or FVB females alongside the experimental breeders so that the two sets of females deliver at approximately the same time.",
    "Females will deliver in 19 ±1 days from the plug date, depending on the background strain. Three days prior to delivery (16 days after the plug date), place the pregnant female into a clean cage with fresh nesting material and a covered shelter.\nCheck for newborn pups twice daily starting 2 days prior to the expected delivery date (17 days after the plug date). Examine the cage with minimum stress to the mothers by peeking through the bottom for the presence of pink newborns. Mice generally deliver pups in the morning but on rare occasions will deliver in afternoon.\nPlan to perform injections as soon as the pups are nursing (which will be evident by visible milk spots), or within 6 hr of birth, whichever comes first.\n2. Prepare Equipment for Injection\nPrepare a 10 µl injection syringe with a 32 G needle for general P0 neonates. If performing stereotaxic injection, mount the syringe onto the manipulator arm.\nIf using a stereotaxic frame for injections, cool the neonatal stage to 4-8 °C by adding 100% ethanol and dry ice to the reservoir at the front end of the block. Maintain the temperature above 1 °C to avoid frostbite of the pups.\n3. Prepare Viral Dilutions for Injection\nPrepare a 1% trypan blue dye solution (20x stock).\nPrepare 5-25 µl aliquots of adeno-associated virus (AAV) stock inside a Class 2 biosafety cabinet. Place these aliquots at -80 °C for future use. Avoid additional freeze-thaw cycles as this causes the virus to lose transduction efficacy.\nRemove an aliquot of AAV from the -80 °C freezer and place on ice to thaw.",
    "Prepare the viral solution for injection by diluting the virus into ice-cold 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Start with a ten-fold serial dilution (1010 to 108 viral particles/hemisphere) for initial optimization of the transduction pattern.\nAdd 20x trypan blue to the AAV solution to a final concentration of 0.05%.\n4. Staging the Newborn Pups for Injection\nPlace a small aluminum plate on ice to cool. Place a dry task wipe on top of the plate to protect the pup’s skin from the cold metal. This serves as a flat cold surface for anesthetizing and injecting the pups.\nPrepare a warming pad suitable for keeping neonatal mice warm before and after injection.\nOnce the newborn pups have begun to nurse, remove approximately half of them from the cage and leave the other half with their mother. Place the collected pups on the warming pad while awaiting injection.\n\tNOTE: If the biological mother does not care for the pups, remove the entire litter from the cage immediately and place the pups onto a warming pad to await injection. This situation may arise with the first litter born to C57BL/6 females or with other inbred strains that have poor breeding characteristics. In this situation, milk spots will not be visible on newborn pups.\nTransfer one pup from the warming pad onto the cold metal plate to induce hypothermia anesthesia. Wait 2-3 min for the pup to become fully anesthetized. Confirm anesthesia by very gently squeezing a paw and monitor for lack of movement or respiration.\n5. Injection of AAV into Neonatal Mice\nFree-hand intracranial injection of AAV into neonatal mice:\n\t\nLoad 5 µl of diluted AAV with 0.05% trypan blue into the injection syringe.\nGently wipe the head of the anesthetized pup with a cotton swab soaked in 70% ethanol.",
    "Identify the injection sites at 2/5 of the distance from the lambda suture to each eye. An alternative injection site is located approximately 0.8-1 mm lateral from the sagittal suture, halfway between lambda and bregma. These landmarks are visible through the skin at P0.\nMark the injection site with a non-toxic laboratory pen.\nHold the syringe with the scale visible for monitoring the volume of solution dispensed.\nEnsure that the thumb can reach the top of the plunger. Then remove the thumb from the plunger while positioning the needle to avoid accidentally dispensing virus.\nFind a comfortable position to brace the arm for injection by putting the elbow on the bench and leaning the arm on the ice bucket.\nLay the pup on its side with its head directly under the syringe. Turn the pup’s head so that the marked injection site is facing up, and gently but firmly hold this position with an open hand.\nHold the syringe perpendicular to the surface of the skull and insert the needle at the marked injection site to a depth of approximately 3 mm. Inject the needle until the resistance decreases slightly, indicating that the needle has penetrated into the lateral ventricle. If a reference is needed, mark 3 mm from the tip of needle with non-toxic maker. Adjust the injection depth for pup size and strain based on dye targeting of the ventricles.\nHold the syringe rigidly so that the plunger can be depressed without moving the needle farther into the brain. If the injection is displaced into the thalamus, viral spread will be severely limited.",
    "Begin slowly injecting virus while monitoring the volume dispensed from the syringe. Administer a maximum volume of 2 µl into each ventricle. If the needle is in the correct position, the dye will spread to fill the ventricle.\nSlowly withdraw the needle.\nAllow the first injection site to close before injecting the other hemisphere.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not inject the same site more than once. Reinserting the needle forces virus that has already been injected to leak out and causes injury or death of the pup.\nInject the contralateral ventricle using the same procedure.\nStereotaxic injection of AAV into neonatal mice:\n\t\nLoad 5 µl of diluted AAV with 0.05% trypan blue into the injection syringe held by the stereotaxic manipulator.\nGently place the pup’s head between the ear bars of the neonatal frame. Make sure the head is level in the Y-axis (front to back) by checking that the line between lambda and bregma is parallel to the stage. Make sure the head is level in the X-axis (side to side) by checking that an imagined line between the ears, or a line between the eyes, is parallel to the stage.\nGently wipe the anesthetized pup’s head with a cotton swab soaked in 70% ethanol.\nUse the stereotaxic manipulator to position the syringe above lambda and then zero the X and Y coordinates. Move the stereotaxic arms to (X, Y) = (0.8, 1.5) mm for standard P0 pups.\n\t\tNOTE: Pup size and stereotaxic coordinates may vary by strain and age. Adjust coordinates based on dye injections as needed to target the lateral ventricles.",
    "Slowly lower the needle into the injection site. The surface of the skull will indent and then release once the needle has penetrated the skin. Retract the needle until the skull recovers its normal concave shape, but keep the bevel of the needle under the skin. Zero the Z coordinate at this point.\nInsert the needle until Z = -1.7 mm and then retract to -1.5 mm.\nSlowly inject the virus. Each hemisphere can accept up to 2 µl of solution.\nKeep the syringe in place for 30-60 sec after completing the injection and then slowly retract the needle over 1-2 min.\nRepeat for the contralateral hemisphere, using negative coordinates in the X-axis for the injection site.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternative coordinates for injection are (X, Y, Z) = (0.8, 2.0, -1.5) mm and (1.2, 1.0, -1.5) mm. Perform the first injection at (0.8, 2.0), then move to (0.8, -2.0), (1.2, 1.0) and finally (1.2, -1.0). Inject 1 μl of solution at each site, for a total of 2 μl per hemisphere. Move quickly between injections to complete the procedure in less than 10 min.\n6. Post-injection Care\nAfter completing injections into both hemispheres, place the pup back on the warming pad until its body temperature and skin color return to normal and the pup begins to move.\nIf using the biological mother to nurse the injected neonates, return the injected pups to the biological mother after they recover normal movement. Place the remaining uninjected pups on the warming pad. Repeat the procedure until all mice have been injected.\nIf using a foster mom to nurse the injected neonates, transfer all injected pups to the foster mother for care after they recover normal movement.",
    "Remove most or all of the pups belonging to the foster mother from the cage to ensure the success of the injected animals.\nIf foster mother’s pups and injected pups have the same eye and skin color, mark pups from the foster mother with a laboratory pen so they can be distinguished later.\nPlace the foster mother’s pups and some of their bedding together with the injected pups. Ensure that the injected pups acquire the scent of her biological offspring to improve acceptance of the new pups.\nPlace only the injected pups back into the foster mother’s cage. Cull any remaining pups from the foster mother.\nEnsure that the mother is attending to and nursing the injected pups within 10 min of placing them into the cage. If the mother does not collect the pups within this time, transfer pups to another foster mother.\nLabel the cage with a biohazard card to show that it contains virally-injected animals. House the cage in an approved area for 72 hr.\nAfter the 72 hr quarantine period, transfer the mother and pups (but no bedding or other cage items) to a clean cage. Perform this transfer inside a Level 2 biosafety cabinet to avoid exposure to any virally-contaminated bedding. Return the clean cage with the injected animals to the regular mouse facility.\nPlace the dirty cage into a biohazard bag, sterilize by autoclaving, and then return the cage to the vivarium.\n7. Cleanup\nPlace the remaining virus solution at 4 °C for future use. The virus retains transduction efficiency for at least 2 months when stored at 4 °C8.\nDisinfect the injection needle and syringe with 2% bleach followed by repeated rinses in deionized water.\nClean the working area with 2% bleach followed by 70% ethanol.",
    "Collect all disposable items including pipette tips, tubes, mask, and gloves in a plastic biohazard bag. Dispose of waste materials as required by local law and institutional policies (i.e. autoclave or incinerate).\n8. Prepare Mouse Brains for Imaging\nPlace an injected mouse into a carbon dioxide euthanasia chamber at 3-4 weeks post-injection. Follow institutional guidelines for proper euthanasia procedures. Do not perfuse animals with paraformaldehyde as this will quench the fluorescence label.\nRemove the whole brains from the skull and fix for 3-12 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C.\nTransfer the fixed brain to 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Incubate at 4 °C until the brain sinks to the bottom.\nCollect a bucket of finely crushed dry ice. Cut the brain in half down the midline. Bury the brain halves in the dry ice to freeze.\nCool the microtome stage by adding dry ice and 100% ethanol.\nSecure the brain to the stage with the midline down using PBS, and allow to freeze.\nSection through the brain at 30-45 µm thickness using a freezing-sliding microtome.\nPlace sections into 24-well plates containing antifreeze solution (250 ml glycerol, 300 ml ethylene glycol, 500 ml 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Cover plates with tin foil and store at -20 °C for future use.\nCollect sections from 1-4 wells and wash 3x in PBS.\nMount sections onto microscope slides and coverslip. Allow slides to dry in a dark location.\nImage slides using appropriate filters for native YFP or tdTomato to check the virus transduction pattern.\nSubscription Required.
