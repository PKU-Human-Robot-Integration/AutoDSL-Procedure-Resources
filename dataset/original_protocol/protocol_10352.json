    "1. Scaffold Fabrication\nGrind NaCl in a laboratory blender for 20 min and dry it on a heater at 100 °C.\nPut the dried NaCl (45 g at time) in a sieving machine for 30 minutes at the highest available frequency without occurring in resonance. Collect six salt fractions, ranging from 500 µm to 1000 µm (M 500); from 300 µm to 500 µm (M 300); from 100 µm to 200 µm (M 100); from 90 µm to 100 (M 90); from 45 µm to 65 µm (M 45) and finally M 10 with salt particles size smaller than 45 µm as schematized in Figure 1.\nVacuum dry overnight all the materials in order to avoid hydrolytic scission during processing. For each material, select the temperature in order to maximize the degree of drying without overcoming - in the case of polymers - the glass transition. Therefore, choose T = 90 °C for PLA and T = 25 °C for PEG, T = 105 °C for NaCl.\nFeed PLA, PEG and NaCl, with a weight percentage composition of 20/5/75 respectively, to a batch mixer operating at T = 190 °C and n = 60 rpm and then process them until achieving a constant value of torque, usually after about 10 minutes. Thereafter, rapidly collect the resulting material.\nPrepare the mono-layers by using a laboratory press operating at 210 °C, put the blends in appropriate cylindrical molds with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 3 mm and keep them for 60 sec at ambient pressure and 3 minutes at 180 bar. Thereafter, cool the blends at room temperature, maintaining the pressure of 180 bar.\nAssembly of Three-layers via compression-molding",
    "Prepare each single layer in the same way as that described in (1.5) but using different molds, i.e. having a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 1 mm. Finally, obtain 6 disks having a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 1 mm, containing six different particle sizes: M 500, M 300, M 100,\nFor assembling three-layer scaffold A (TLS A), pile up M 500, M 300 and M 100 inside the cylindrical mold and compression-mold them in a laboratory press operating at 210 °C for 60 sec at ambient pressure and 3 minutes at 180 bar and then cooled at room temperature, maintaining the pressure of 180 bar.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare the TSL B by stacking on each other M 90, M 45 and M 10 in the same molds and conduct the compression-molding operation by following the same procedure as that used for TLS A.\nRemove the disks from the cylindrical molds and put them in a boiling demineralized water bath, without stirring. 3 hr after, remove the resulting porous structures from the bath and let them dry for 12 hr at room temperature in a chemical hood.\n2. Morphological Analysis\nEvaluate the morphologies of the scaffolds by scanning electron microscopy.\n\t\nBreak down the samples under liquid nitrogen and then attach the samples on an aluminum stub using an adhesive carbon tape. Finally, sputter-coate with gold for 90 s under argon atmosphere before imaging in order to avoid electrostatic discharge during the test.\n3. Scaffold Pore Size\nElaborate the images obtained by SEM analysis with an image processing software able to recognize the pore size distribution of the scaffold.\n\tNOTE: In this work the pore size distribution analysis was carried out using a MATLAB-based software previously described33\n4. Porosity",
    "Weigh the samples before leaching and evaluate the theoretical porosity according to the following expression:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54595/54595eq1.jpg\n\tNOTE: mNaCl, mPEG and mPLA, are respectively the theoretical mass of NaCl, PEG, and PLA, by assuming homogeneous blends. The densities (ρ) of NaCl, PEG and PLA are respectively 2,16 g/cm3, 1,12 g/cm3 e 1,24 g/cm3.\nWeigh the samples after leaching and drying in order to assess the apparent density of the samples (ρscaffold), and then evaluate the real porosity as the reciprocal of the ratio between the apparent density of the scaffold and the density of non-porous PLA by using expression (2).\n\tNOTE: It expresses the ratio between the empty volume of the scaffold and the full volume of the scaffold (empty + full).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54595/54595eq2.jpg\n5. Mechanical Properties\nTest the samples under compressive mode using a tensile machine, equipped with a 1 kN load cell. Set a constant strain rate of 1 mm min-1.\nIn order to investigate the mechanical performance of the samples in physiological environment, equip the dynamometer with a bath containing (PBS), (pH = 7.4) at 37 °C and perform the test with the same setup as that described at point 5.1.\n\t\nBefore each measurement in wet environment, soak the samples with PBS in a vacuum flask for 5 min in order to let PBS fill all the pores. Thereafter, allow the scaffolds to remain in PBS at 37 °C for 15 min to reach the set-point temperature.\nDetermine the interfacial adhesion strength (IAS) between the layers of TL A and TL B by using a custom-designed interfacial strength test equipment, connected to a Mechanical Testing Machine following a method described in literature32,34.",
    "Fix the scaffold on the rig and ensure its correct alignment with the machine's load cell and base platen. Attach the scaffold samples to aluminum test stubs by using a high viscosity adhesive and place them into the equipment for testing.\nFor the wet condition test, hydrate the samples in PBS for 1 hr prior to testing. Use a 1 kN load cell, under a tensile load applied at a strain rate of 1 mm min-1.\n\t\tNOTE: Take into account that failure may occur either at the ultimate tensile strength of one of the layers or because of delamination at the interfaces. Evaluate the IAS as the maximum strength of the stress-strain curve.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
