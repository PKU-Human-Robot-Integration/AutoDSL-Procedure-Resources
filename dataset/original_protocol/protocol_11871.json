    "1. Strains, Media, and Buffer Recipes\nPrepare yeast (S. cerevisiae) media as detailed here: YP (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v bacteriological peptone), and glucose and galactose stocks at 20% w/v.\nPrepare sodium acetate (NaAc)-EDTA (AE) buffer as detailed here: 50 mM NaAc pH 5.3 and 10 mM EDTA.\nPrepare 10-23 DNAzyme 4x Incubation Buffer as detailed here: 24 mM Tris pH 8.0, 60 mM NaCl and 10-23 DNAzyme 4x Reaction Buffer: 200 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 600 mM NaCl.\nPrepare 8-17 DNAzyme 2x Reaction Buffer as detailed here: 200 mM KCl, 800 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 15 mM MgCl2, and 15 mM MnCl2.\nPrepare 10x MOPS Buffer as detailed here: 200 mM MOPS, 50 mM NaAc, 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.0 and 1.5x Sample Denaturing Buffer: 50% v/v formamide, 20% v/v formaldehyde, 1.5x MOPS buffer.\nObtain S. cerevisiae strains, BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0); GAL1::SNR13 (as BY4741 but GAL1::SNR13:KANmX); GAL1::SNR47 (as BY4741 but GAL1::SNR47:HIS3mX). Any other yeast strain can be used for this analysis.\n2. DNAzyme Design\nFind RNA sequence of interest or putative methylation site using an appropriate database. For S. cerevisiae snoRNA targets, use yeast snoRNA database: http://people.biochem.umass.edu/fournierlab/snornadb/mastertable.php14\nTo find the methylation site of interest, e.g., snR13-dependent site, select “snR13” and make a note of the position of the modified nucleotide (e.g., snR13-guided A2281 in 25S rRNA).\nFind sequences upstream and downstream of the modified nucleotide using appropriate database. For S. cerevisiae, use the Saccharomyces Genome Database: https://www.yeastgenome.org/\nSearch for the target gene name e.g., RDN25 (coding 25S rRNA).\nFrom the “sequence” tab, select 10-15 nucleotides upstream (5’ arm) and downstream (3 ’arm) of the methylation site when using a 10-23 DNAzyme assay and 20 nucleotides upstream (5’ arm) and downstream (3’arm) of the methylation site for a 8-17 DNAzyme.",

S. cerevisiae Growth Conditions\nNOTE: S. cerevisiae BY4741 strain derivatives were used, in which the expression of either SNR13 or SNR47 snoRNA is driven from the inducible GAL1 promoter. In order to induce or inhibit their synthesis, grow cells on medium containing galactose (GAL1-dependent transcription on) or glucose (GAL1-dependent transcription off). As a control, use the wild type strain (BY4741) grown either on galactose or glucose.\nGrow yeast strains in an appropriate medium and conditions. To analyze GAL1::SNR13 and GAL1::SNR47 strains as well as the isogenic wild type strain, grow cells in 50 mL of YP media with either 2% glucose (YPD) or galactose (YPGal) at 30 °C to the middle exponential phase.\nCentrifuge cells at 1,000 x g, for 3 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and keep the pellets.\nFreeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C.\nCAUTION: Liquid nitrogen may cause severe cryogenic burns.
