The\n      following sections describe the further use of these cells. The positively\n      selected CD8+ T cells are cryopreserved upon isolation, to be\n      then thawed and specifically activated (on day 1) and expanded in two\n      rounds of IVS; first (on day 1) with fresh or thawed autologous mDCs,\n      second with thawed irradiated autologous PBL, originating from the\n      CD14- and CD8- cell fractions that are cryopreserved\n      to be used upon irradiation for second IVS (on day 8 after 1st IVS).\n    \n      First IVS of autologous CD8+ T cells with\n      WT137-45-peptide pulsed mature IL-4 DCs on day 1\n    \nTiming: 8 days\n      In this part of the protocol, fresh or thawed mature IL-4 DCs are pulsed\n      with WT1 peptide prior to co-culture with thawed autologous primary\n      CD8+ T cells in a 1:10 ratio in the presence of IL-21\n      (Immunotools),2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] representing the first\n      antigen-specific IVS of autologous CD8+ T cells.

A typical culture needs to be\n              passaged every 2–3 days until harvest at day 8.
