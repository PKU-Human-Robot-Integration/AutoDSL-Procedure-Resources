    "Protocol 1: Biofilm formation inhibition assay (Figure 1) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231012/20231012022259_6550.jpgFigure 1. Protocol 1 for screening biofilm formation inhibition. (1–2) Prepare the bacterial suspension and dispense it into a 24-well microplate. (3) Dispense different concentrations of the tested compound (D-Ser) in desired increments into the microplate. (4) Incubate the microplate to generate the biofilm inside the wells. (5) After incubation, the wells are washed, allowed to dry, and then stained with crystal violet solution (6). The stained biofilms are washed to remove excess dye and a volume of MBDS solution is added to the wells to dissolve the crystal violet stained biofilm. (7) The absorbance (OD) of the de-stained MBDS solution is read on a spectrophotometer.Single-species assay Note: To investigate the effect of a compound to be tested on biofilm-formed C. jejuni. Recover C. jejuni NCTC 11168-O from -80 °C storage, plate the stock on MHA media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics [Trimethoprim (2.5 μg/mL) and Vancomycin (10 μg/mL)], and incubate microaerobically (85% N2, 10% CO2, and 5% O2) at 42 °C overnight.Harvest bacterial cells from the agar plates into 1 mL of MHB using a glass or a disposable plastic rod to lift the cells off the agar plates into a test tube, and transfer ~100–200 μL of the resulting bacterial suspension into 15 mL of MHB (supplemented with appropriate antibiotics). Incubate microaerobically at 42 °C and 125 rpm in a shaker incubator (18–20 h overnight).Dilute overnight culture in fresh MHB (supplemented with appropriate antibiotics) to achieve cell density of OD600 of 0.05 at the start of the logarithmic growth phase (~107 CFU/mL).Dispense 2 mL of diluted bacterial suspension into each well of a 24-well plate (minimum of three rows of four wells to each sample) or 180 μL per well for 96-well plates. Uninoculated MHB is used as a negative control.",
    "To test the inhibitory effect of the tested compound (e.g., D-Ser), add the chosen concentrations (i.e., 1–50 mM) of the compounds to be tested directly to the culture in the wells. For example, 1 M of D-Ser (in PBS) was used as stock solution and 100 μL of stock solution was added to each well, except for negative control.Cover the 24-well plates and incubate them at 42 °C under microaerophilic conditions without shaking (static culture) for 24 h (see Notes 1 and 2). Each plate must include medium-only control in four wells.To quantify biofilm formation, go to section “Assessment of biofilm formation” from Protocol 2.Dual/multiple species assay Note: To investigate the effect of a compound to be tested on biofilms formed by a mixed culture (in this example: C. jejuni and P. aeruginosa). Grow P. aeruginosa cells aerobically in MHB overnight at 37 °C and then adjust the cell density with fresh MHB to OD600 of 0.1, at the start of the logarithmic growth phase (107 CFU/mL) [26].Grow C. jejuni cells as described above (steps A1–A3).Use a ratio of 1:1 of the cell suspensions for both/multiple bacteria for the assay.Repeat steps A4–A6 as described above (see Notes 1 and 2).To quantify biofilm formation, go to section “Assessment of biofilm formation” from Protocol 2.Protocol 2: Biofilm dispersal assay (Figure 2) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231012/20231012022325_7711.jpgFigure 2. Protocol 2 for screening biofilm formation dispersal. (1–2) Prepare the bacterial suspension and dispense it into a 24-well microplate. (3) Incubate the microplate to generate the biofilm inside the wells. (4) The bacterial culture is then removed, and the wells are washed to remove planktonic cells before dispensing different concentrations of the tested compound (D-Ser) in desired increments into the microtiter plate. (5) After incubation, the wells are washed, allowed to dry, and then stained with crystal violet solution.",
    "(6) The stained biofilms are washed to remove excess dye and MBDS solution is added to the wells to dissolve the crystal violet stained biofilm. (7) The absorbance (OD) of the de-stained MBDS solution is read on a spectrophotometer.Repeat steps A1–A6, except step 5.Remove the media from the 24-well plate and add 500 μL of PBS with an appropriate concentration (i.e., 10–50 mM) of the compound to be tested in each well (PBS-only is used as negative control).Incubate the plates at 42 °C under microaerobic conditions without shaking for 24 h (see Notes 1 and 2).Take the supernatants and measure the OD600 for each well.To quantify biofilm formation, go to section “Assessment of biofilm formation.”Assessment of biofilm formation Remove the media from plates (by inverting over an absorbent paper towel in a tray) and rinse gently with distilled water twice to remove planktonic cells.Dry plates by gently tapping on a paper towel until no liquid remains in the wells.Additionally, air-dry the plates for 15 min in a laminar flow cabinet.Stain the attached biofilm material by adding 300 μL of 0.1% crystal violet solution (125 μL for a 96-well plate) to each well and let stand for 10 min at room temperature.Remove the crystal violet solution by pipetting out and rinse out unbound crystal violet with distilled water until all wells are free of liquid crystal violet (see Note 6).Tap the plates over the paper towel and leave them face up on the bench overnight at room temperature to dry or air-dry for 15 min in laminar flow cabinet.Add 500 μL (or 200 μL for a 96-well plate) of MBDS to each well to solubilize the crystal violet and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Mix the MBDS and crystal violet in the wells by pipetting up and down.",
    "Transfer 125–200 μL of the MBDS/crystal violet solution from each well into a corresponding well of a flat-bottomed 96-well plate.Quantify OD (570–600 nm) of each well in a plate reader in the flat-bottomed plate.Subtract the measurement for blank wells (MBDS only) from the OD of each well that contained a sample/concentration and calculate the average.Normalize the average to the percentage of biofilm inhibition and dispersion (%) as described in [6, 27, 28]:% = (Con - Exp)/Con) × 100Where Con = Control (Untreated) and Exp = Experimental (Treated).CLSM microscopy (Figure 3) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4866/bioprotoc-13-21-4866-g003.jpgFigure 3. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) images of dual-species biofilms with Campylobacter jejuni and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. C. jejuni/P. aeruginosa biofilm (48 h) imaged using dual fluorescence labeling, DAPI (blue), and Thioflavin T (green) (scale bar = 20 μm).Prepare the cells as described in steps A1–A3.Place a coverslip into each well of the 6-well plate.Dispense 2 mL of diluted bacterial suspension into 2 wells of the 6-well plate to enable the formation of biofilm on the coverslip.Incubate plates at 42 °C under microaerobic condition without shaking for at least 24 h and up to 72 h (see Notes 1 and 2).Remove the media from plates over a tray and rinse gently with PBS twice to remove planktonic cells.Fix the cells on the coverslips using a 5% formaldehyde solution for 1 h at room temperature, rinse gently with 2 mL of PBS, and stain with fluorescent dyes (e.g., DAPI) that label DNA [6].DAPI is usually used to visualize bacterial cell distribution in the biofilm [29] and is often included in the anti-fade mounting medium.Remove the coverslips using forceps, carefully hold the coverslip edge to avoid disrupting the biofilm, and invert onto a glass slide containing a drop of the anti-fade mounting medium with DAPI (10 μg/mL) (see Note 7).",
    "Seal coverslips mount on glass slides using transparent nail varnish. Two coverslips per sample/concentration from at least two separate experiments should be examined microscopically.All images are processed using ImageJ [30]. ImageJ was used to combine/overlay two images [e.g., DAPI and Thioflavin T (green)] into a single image to generate a representative image as shown inFigure 3. Briefly, open the images in ImageJ and adjust the contrast (go to Image > Adjust > Brightness). To combine two/three images into a single-color image, go to Image > Color > Merge channels; each image represents one of the three channels (red, green, and blue) and the merge channels box will appear. Then, select the channels that you want and click OK to create the composite image; save it as .tiff file."
