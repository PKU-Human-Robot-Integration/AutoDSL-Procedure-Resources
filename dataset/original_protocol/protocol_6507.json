    "Production of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe by in vitro transcriptionSmall scale tRNA in vitro transcriptionThe optimal in vitro transcription conditions depend greatly on the MgCl2 and NTPs concentrations. The [MgCl2]/[NTP] ratio should be adjusted to optimize the yield of the RNA of interest (Figure 1). It is recommended to test small-scale reactions (e.g., 40 μl) before large-scale production of RNA (5-20 ml). In practice, the concentration of MgCl2 is varied in small-scale reactions as described in Table 1. The yield of tRNA transcript is then analyzed by Urea-PAGE (Step A2). The conditions of Table 1 are first starting points to determine best MgCl2 concentration. Concentrations of T7 RNA polymerase, DNA template and the addition of GMP at 2-6 mM can also be further optimized in a second step.Prepare small scale reaction tests of 40 μl as described in Table 1 in PCR microtubes.Incubate the reactions in a water bath for 3 h at 37 °C. After ~1 h, the appearance of a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate is the sign of a working transcription reaction.Stop the reaction by adding 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0 to each small scale reaction.Store at -20 °C or analyze the reactions by Urea-PAGE (Step A2).Table 1.

For tRNA of ~75 nts, prepare a gel mix with 7M Urea and 14% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide 19:1 by mixing 16.8 g of urea, 14 ml of 40% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide 19:1, 4 ml of 10x TBE and adjusting the volume to 40 ml final with H2O. (Note that this mix can be stored at room temperature for several months).",
    "Take 6 ml of this mix and add 60 μl of 10% APS and 6 μl of TEMED just before placing the gel between the glass plates and put the comb immediately.Take an aliquot of each small-scale reaction (typically 2.5 μl) and add 2.5 μl of 2x RNA loading dye (Recipe 2). Load your samples in the wells and run the gel for 1 h at 200 V in 1x TBE buffer.The visualization is then done by toluidine blue staining. Carefully remove the gel from the glass plates and let it stain in the toluidine-blue staining solution (Recipe 3) for 5-10 min. Pour the staining solution back into the stock bottle, and destain with water. Destain several times with fresh water until the background color of the gel is clear.Take a picture with a regular camera. The gel corresponding to the assays described in Table 1 and revealed by toluidine-blue staining is shown in Figure 1. The best yield for the yeast tRNAPhe is obtained for conditions #5 and #6 with [MgCl2]/[NTPs] = 1.7-2.0, i.e., [MgCl2] = 34-40 mM and [NTPs] = 20 mM. These concentrations are thus used for large-scale preparation of this tRNA.The yield of RNA produced by in vitro transcription is sometimes very sensitive to the concentration of MgCl2. We recommend to perform these small-scale assays each time that a new DNA template is used and each time new NTPs are used, indeed, best MgCl2 concentration might be slightly different with different sources of NTP. Especially, best MgCl2 concentration might differ slightly for 15N-labeled nucleotides and must therefore be determined with the actual NTPs that will be used in large scale transcription reaction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200614/20200614074429_1455.jpgFigure 1.

    "Urea-PAGE revealed by toluidine-blue staining showing the analysis of small-scale transcription assays of Table 1 corresponding to the production of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe. The MgCl2 concentration is varied from 6 mM to 60 mM. Numbers above the gel correspond to the conditions #1 to #8 in Table Large scale in vitro transcription of unmodified yeast tRNAPheFor large scale in vitro transcription, up-scale the best conditions as determined in Step A1 with small scale reactions. In our hands, a concentrated NMR sample of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe 15N-labeled on Us and Gs can be obtained from a 10 ml transcription reaction prepared as described below.Prepare the large scale transcription reaction of 10 ml in a 50 ml tube as follow:40 μl of DNA template pre-mixed with the T7 promotor primer at a 1:1 ratio (stock at 50 μM)500 μl of 20x T7 transcription buffer (TB).500 μl of non-labeled ATP (stock at 100 mM)500 μl of non-labeled CTP (stock at 100 mM)500 μl of 15N-labeled UTP (stock at 100 mM)500 μl of 15N-labeled GTP (stock at 100 mM)1,300 μl of MgCl2 (stock at 280 mM)500 μl of GMP (stock at 80 mM)250 μl of T7 RNA polymerase (stock at 1 mg/ml)RNase-free water to 10 mlIncubate the reactions in a water bath for 3-4 h at 37 °C.Stop the reaction by adding 1-1.5 ml of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0.Store at -20°C until purification or purify readily as described in Step A4.Purification and NMR sample preparation of unmodified yeast tRNAPheThe purification is performed on a ÄKTA Purifier (or other FPLC purification system) at 4 °C. Transcribed tRNAs are sensitive to RNases, one should therefore be careful to operate the purification in RNase free conditions. For that, wash the purification system and the columns with 0.",
    "5 M NaOH and rinse them extensively with water before equilibrating the MonoQ HR 10/100 column in buffer A.Filter the large scale transcription sample of Step A3 with 0.22 μm filters.Load 5-6 ml of the transcription sample on the MonoQ column previously equilibrated with buffer A.Remark: It is not recommended to load larger quantities of tRNAs onto the column. The purification indeed becomes difficult due to a broadening of the elution peaks. Perform Steps A4b to A4d as many times as needed for large scale transcriptions of more than 5 ml.The purification of the tRNA transcript is achieved using a gradient from 20% to 80% of buffer B with a length of 10 column volumes (CV) and a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Collect 1 ml fractions. Transcribed yeast tRNAPhe is usually eluted between 50% and 55% of buffer B.Analyse the content of the fractions with denaturing Urea-PAGE as described in Step A2, and pool the fractions containing the tRNA of interest (usually 5 fractions of 1 ml). Do not add fractions of tRNAPhe eluted after 55% of buffer B, since they usually contain longer RNA transcripts originating from non-templated nucleotide addition at the 3′-end of the transcript.Dialyze extensively the pooled fractions of yeast tRNAPhe in a dialysis sack against 1 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5. For that one usually dialyzes the sample against a 2 L dialysis solution for at least 2 h and changes it with a fresh solution 3 times.Recover the dialyzed tRNAPhe in a 50 ml plastic tube and refold it by heating the sample at 95 °C for 5 min and letting it cool down slowly at room temperature.Add concentrated buffer stock solutions (e.g., 0.5 M Na-phosphate pH 6.5 and 1 M MgCl2) to place the refolded sample in the final NMR buffer (i.e.",
    ", 10 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2).Concentrate the unmodified yeast tRNAPhe sample in the NMR buffer to ~1.5-2.0 mM using Amicon 3,000 MWCO. In our hands, with a 10 ml transcription with 15N-labeled on Us and Gs, one usually obtains a final NMR sample of 300 μl at ~1.8 mM (i.e., 0.5-0.6 µmol).Store the sample at -20 °C or use it directly for NMR spectra measurements (see Note 2).Production of modified yeast tRNAPhe by in vivo recombinant expression in E. coli Modified yeast tRNAPhe recombinant expression and extractionTransformation of E. coli with the tRNA expression plasmid and 15N-labeled expressionThe volumes and quantities mentioned below refer to a 1 L culture. We recommend to grow several liters of culture (i.e., 2-4 L) to increase the quantity of modified yeast tRNAPhe purified following this protocol. We also recommend to grow 500 ml of culture in 2 L flasks to get enough oxygenation or ideally to use a fermenter to optimize certain parameters (e.g., pH of the medium, oxygenation…).Use a 100 μl aliquot of electrocompetent E. coli JM101Tr strain. Add 2 μl of the plasmid (at 50-200 ng/μl).Put the mix in an electroporation cuvette. Electroporate the cells, with the machine set according to the electroporation cuvette and organism that is used (namely set the electroporator to “Ec2” meaning “E. coli 0.2 cm cuvette”). Then add 1 ml of LB medium and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Divide the 1.1 ml of transformation product in two and pour each half directly into a 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 0.5 L of 15N-labeled rich growth media (i.e. Spectra 9) supplemented with 0.5 g of 15N-labeled celtone base powder and 50 µg/ml of ampicillin (total culture volume of 1 L).Grow the bacteria for ~20 h at 37 °C.",
    "Recover the bacteria by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 20 min.Total small RNAs extractionResuspend the pellets with 10 ml of extraction buffer in a 50 ml conical tube.Add 10 ml of water-saturated phenol. Mix gently for 1 h at room temperature on a tube rotator.Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 30 min at 20 °C. Carefully recover the aqueous phase, which corresponds to the upper phase lying above the phenol phase.Do a counter-extraction with the addition of 1 ml of extraction buffer to the phenol phase. Mix gently for 15 min, centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 30 min at 20 °C, and carefully recover the aqueous phase.Add 0.1 volume of 5 M NaCl and 2 volumes of ethanol absolute to the pooled aqueous phases of Steps B1biii and B1biv.Vortex vigourously and then centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of 1 M NaCl. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Recover the supernatant, and add 2.5 volume of ethanol absolute.Centrifuge again 30 min at 8,000 x g at 4 °C. All the small RNAs are now precipitated. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml of 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and incubate 3 h at 37 °C to completely deacylate the 3′ extremity of the tRNAs.Precipitate the deacylated RNAs by adding 2 volumes of ethanol absolute, vortex vigourously and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Dissolve the pellet in 5 ml of purification buffer C. The sample is ready for the purification step (Step B2).Modified yeast tRNAPhe purification and NMR sample preparationBefore starting the purification, wash the purification system, the loops and the columns with 0.",
    "5 M NaOH and rinse them extensively with water in order to work in RNase free conditions.Gel-filtration chromatographyLoad the 5 ml sample (obtained at the end of Step B1) at 0.5 ml/min on a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 75 pg column previously equilibrated with purification buffer C.Elute at 0.5 ml/min, collect 3.5 ml per fraction.Gel-shift assay to identify the fractions containing the yeast tRNAPheDesign a DNA oligonucleotide sequence that is specifically complementary to the overexpressed yeast tRNAPhe and not conserved in the other E. coli tRNAs. In our hands, it works well when the complementary DNA oligonucleotide includes the anticodon arm and parts of the D- and TΨC-arms (see Figure 2A).In 0.2 ml-microtubes, mix 5 μl of each fraction with 1 μl of the complementary DNA oligonucleotide (stock at 100 µM), or with 1 μl of water (negative control).Heat the samples at 95 °C for 2 min in a dry bath incubator, and cool them down on ice.Add 6 μl of the 2x Laemmli loading buffer to the samples.Prepare a 14% SDS polyacrylamide gel: For the separating gel, mix 1.75 ml of 40% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (19:1) solution, 1.875 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 25 μl of 20% (w/v) SDS and adjust to 5 ml with water. Add 40 μl of 10% APS and 5 μl of TEMED just before pouring the gel between the glass plates at 2/3 of the total height. For the stacking gel, mix 500 μl of 40% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (19:1) solution, 630 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 50 μl of 20% (w/v) SDS and adjust to 5 ml with water. Add 40 μl of 10% APS and 5 μl of TEMED just before pouring the gel on top of the polymerized separating gel. Put immediately the 10-well comb.",
    "Load the samples on the 14% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Migrate in 1x TGS buffer at 200 V for ~1 h 30 min.Visualize the RNAs in the fractions with the toluidine-blue staining (as described in Step A2c). Fractions containing the tRNA of interest can be easily identified with the appearance of an additionnal band at higher molecular weight in the presence of the complementary DNA oligonucleotide (Figure 2B).Ion exchange chromatographyPool the fractions from Step B2b. that contain the yeast tRNAPhe as identified in Step B2c.Load the pool on a Mono Q 10/100 GL column previously equilibrated with purification buffer C.Apply a gradient from 45% to 60% of buffer D over 30 CV at 2 ml/min. Collect fractions of 1.5 ml.Identify the fractions containing the yeast tRNAPhe with a gel-shift assay as described in Step B2c and pool the fractions of interest.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200614/20200614074501_8640.jpgFigure 2.

Fractions containing the tRNA of interest (i.e., yeast tRNAPhe) can be easily identified with the appearance of an additionnal band at higher molecular weight in the presence of the complementary DNA oligonucleotide (labeled with a star), as compared with the control samples without the complementary DNA oligonucleotide.Hydrophobic interaction chromatographyAdd ammonium sulfate to the pooled fractions of Step B2d to reach a final concentration of 1.7 M. Dissolve the salt by vortexing.Load this sample at 0.5 ml/min on a Phenyl superose HR 10/10 column previously equilibrated with purification buffer E.",
    "Apply a gradient from 20% to 45% of buffer C over 15 CV at 0.5 ml/min. Collect fractions of 2.5 ml.Identify the fractions containing the yeast tRNAPhe with a gel-shift assay as described in Step B2c and pool the fractions of interest.Desalting the sampleDesalt the sample with a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column previously equilibrated with the NMR buffer or dialyze the sample extensively against the NMR buffer. For that, one usually dialyzes the sample against a 2 L dialysis solution for at least 2 h and changes it with a fresh solution 3 times.Sample concentrationConcentrate the modified yeast tRNAPhe sample in the NMR buffer to ~0.2-0.5 mM using Amicon 3,000 MWCO. In our hands, with a 2 L culture in 15N-labeled rich media, one usually obtains a final NMR sample of 250 μl at ~0.4 mM (i.e., 0.08-0.12 µmol).Store the sample at -20 °C or use it directly for NMR spectra measurements (see Note 2)."
