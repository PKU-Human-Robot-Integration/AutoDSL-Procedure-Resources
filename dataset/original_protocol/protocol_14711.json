    "This protocol was approved by the local ethics committee on animal experiments and by the Institutional Committee on Animal Welfare of our institution. All animals received humane care in compliance with the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23, revised 1996).\nGeneral considerations: All animals must be treated with respect, according to the 3Rs rules (National Centre for Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research). Surgical procedures must be performed with a strict sterility and in the same way that for human beings. All medical devices must be sterile.\n1. Anesthesia Protocol\nNOTE: Large White piglets weighing 20 Kg (3-weeks-old) were used. Pulmonary Hypertension was induced progressively. The first step involved a left pulmonary artery (PA) ligation through a left thoracotomy. Following steps consisted of performing weekly PA embolizations during 5 weeks. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia.\nDo not feed the animals 12 hr before the procedure.\nDo a premedication of the piglet, perform an intramuscular injection using 30 mg/kg of Ketamine Hydrochloride and aropine 0.05 mg/kg in the neck muscles, 30 min before the procedure.8\nWhen the pig is sedated, insert a catheter into the ear vein.\nPerform intravenous a bolus of fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg) and propofol (2mg/kg) before intubation. Inject intravenously in the ear vein Cisatracurium (0.3 mg/kg) and intubate the pig (non-selective intubation with a 7 French probe)9.\nPlace continuous monitoring devices on the piglet: continuous EKG, expiratory CO2 and oxymetry8,9. Insert an arterial fluid field catheter through the carotid artery under echography guidance to monitor the systemic arterial pressure8-10.",
    "Maintain general anesthesia with isoflurane (2%) in 100% oxygen supplement, continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl (0.004 mg/kg) and propofol (3 mg/kg).\nAdd an antibioprophylaxy with an injection of Cefatoxine (1 g) and Gentamycine (80 mg).\nPrevent intra operative and post operative pain with injection of nalbuphine (0.01 mg/kg) t.i.d.\nCheck every 15 min the completeness of the anesthesia: absence of movement, stable heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation.\nUse of vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n2. Ligation of the Left Pulmonary Artery\nInstall the piglet in left side-lying position, shave the operative area and disinfect the skin with an alcoholic solution. Use a local sterile field.\nOpen the chest through a small left lateral thoracotomy (5 to 10 cm) in the 4th intercostals’ space. Do not go to behind the tip of the scapula. Carefully retract the lung towards the diaphragm.\nOnce ideal surgical window located, retract the left azygos vein and dissect the main left pulmonary artery before tying it with a non-absorbable 2/0 silk.\n\tNOTE: It is very important not to open the pericardium.\nClose the chest layer after layer with absorbable sutures. Use a chest tube to remove the post operative pneumothorax. Remove the chest tube just after the piglet extubation.\n3. Embolization of the Right Lower Lobe Pulmonary Artery\nAfter general anesthesia, put the piglet in a supine position. Carry out a continuous monitoring of the oxymetry, expiratory CO2, EKG, mean systemic blood pressure (mPA) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) throughout the procedure.",
    "Insert all catheters percutaneously with echographic guidance. Insert an arterial 6 French catheter in the carotid artery for blood pressure monitoring and an 8 French sheath in the superior vena cava through the jugular vein (Perform the puncture 2 cm above the suprasternal notch with a 45° angle direction).\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, insert, through the 8 Fr sheath, a 5 French angiographic catheter in the right pulmonary artery. The tip of the catheter must be in a segmental lower lobe pulmonary artery.\nPrepare the material for pulmonary artery embolization: 1 ml of soft tissue glue containing N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is added to 2 ml of a lipidic contrast dye.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid skin or eyes contact with the N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate.\nWhen the angiographic catheter is well positioned, inject 0.2 ml to 0.4 ml of the preparation in the pulmonary artery. Assess the tolerance of the embolization by measuring the mPAP / mPA ratio that should not exceed 0.5. Stop embolization if oxygen saturation was < 90% and/or the mPA dropped under 60 mm Hg and/or the cardiac output was under 2 L/min.\nRemove the angiographic catheter and sheaths and perform digital compressions of the puncture site.\n4. Hemodynamic Assessment\nAfter general anesthesia, position the piglet in a supine position. Carry out a continuous monitoring of the oxymetry, expiratory CO2, EKG, systemic blood pressure (mPA) and pulmonary blood pressure (mPAP) throughout the procedure.\nVentilate the piglets with the lowest FiO2 as possible according to the oxygen saturation (> 95%).\nInsert all catheter percutaneously under echographic guidance. An arterial 6 French catheter is inserted in the carotid artery and an 8 French sheath is inserted in the superior vena cava (Perform the puncture 2 cm above the suprasternal notch with a 45° angle direction).",
    "Insert a 7 French Swan-Ganz catheter in the pulmonary artery trunk. Assess the cardiac output by the thermo dilution technique, with injection of 10 ml of saline solution at 4 °C.\nRecord the following parameters: systolic, diastolic and mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, right atrial pressure, cardiac output.\n5. Echocardiographic Assessment of the Right Ventricle\nAfter general anesthesia, install the piglet in supine position and perform a trans thoracic echocardiography according human guidelines for RV screening. Record video loops during an end-expiratory pause.\n6. Pressure-Volume Loops Assessment with the Conductance Method\nAfter general anesthesia, install the piglet in a supine position. Carry out a continuous monitoring of the oxymetry, expiratory CO2, EKG, systemic blood pressure (mPA) and pulmonary blood pressure (mPAP) throughout the procedure.\nInsert an arterial 6 French catheter in the right or left carotid artery and an angiographic catheter in the left ventricle. Insert an 9 French sheath in the superior vena cava, an 8 French in the right or left femoral vein and an arterial PiCCO catheter in the right or left femoral artery. Insert all catheters percutaneously under echographic guidance.\nPerform the pressure and volume calibration of the conductance probe according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Measure the blood resistivity (Rho) by sampling 5 ml of arterial blood. Harvest 5 ml of arterial blood, de-air the syringe and fill the probe for the measurement of the blood resistivity. 10-13.\nInsert the conductance catheter in the right ventricle through the 9Fr sheath in the superior veina cava. Place properly the end of the catheter with fluoroscopic guidance. Place the end of the catheter in the apex of the right ventricle and insert all long as possible in the ventricle.\nControl the quality of the loops. (Figure 6)",
    "Insert an ballon expendable in the inferior veina cava through the femoral vein. Place the extremity just below the right atrial. Use fluoroscopic guidance.\nRecord pressure-volume loops of the right ventricle at basal state and during inferior vena cava occlusion as previously described10-12. (Figure 7)\n7. Endomyocardial Biopsies of the Right Ventricle\nAfter general anesthesia, position the piglet in a supine position. Carry out a continuous monitoring of the oxymetry, expiratory CO2, EKG, systemic blood pressure (mPA) and pulmonary blood pressure (mPAP) throughout the procedure.\nInsert percutaneously a 10 French sheath in the superior vena cava. Insert a 7 French Swan-Ganz (SG) probe and a long 7.5 French catheter sheath in the right atrium. When the tip of the SG probe is well placed in the right ventricle (RV), inflate the balloon of the SG probe, push the long-sheath catheter in the RV against the balloon. Deflate the balloon and remove the SG probe leaving the long-sheath catheter in the RV. The good position of the long-sheath’s tip is controlled by fluoroscopy and echocardiography.\nInsert the biotome in the long-sheath and perform endomyocardial biopsies under echographic, fluoroscopic and EKG control.\n8. General Post-surgery Care Considerations\nAfter surgery, extubate the piglet only after recovery of spontaneous respiratory functions.\nFor post operative medication, perform an intramuscular injection of Cefatoxine (1 g) Die for 5 days and deliver appropieted analgesia (Buprenorphin, intramusculary injection 0.01 mg/kg Bid for 10 days.\nDo not leave an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\n9. Euthanasia Method\nEuthanize the animals in the followed situations; End of experimentation, lost of weight 15% or more in one week, unibability to adequately feed themselves, anorexia, not treatable infection, pain or other didease, desease too sévère : cyanosis, major dyspnea",
    "During general anesthesia with sevoluorane 8%, inject a high dose of propofol (0.5 mg/kg) associated with a lethal dose of potassium chloride (0.2 g/kg). When the heart is stopped in diastole, harveste the heart and lung bloc in order to do a histological and molecular study.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
