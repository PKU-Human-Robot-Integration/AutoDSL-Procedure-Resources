    "Note: This procedure involves the manipulation of dangerous compounds, namely liquid nitrogen, acetone, osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, uranyl-acetate, Lowicryl resin. If you are not familiar with how to handle such compounds, please refer to the official guidelines and our Notes 1 and 2. High pressure freezingSteps A1 through A13 should be carried out as fast as possible to limit deterioration of sampled live tissue. In our case, this period is less than a minute. A thorough description on how to use the EMPACT1 is provided in user manual and also in the proof of concept paper (Studer et al., 2001).Turn on Leica EMPACT and air compressor hooked up to it.Fill up the chamber with MCH and evacuate air in the circuit by gently pushing on the vertical rod.Fill in liquid nitrogen tank up to ¾ (keep liquid nitrogen source handy for eventual mid-way top-ups during session).Switch on the EMPACT1 and wait until working pressure reaches between 4.8 and 5 bars.On the touchscreen tap on the corresponding valve to allow filling of the bath with liquid nitrogen (Figure 2B).Load an empty pod and tap on prepare → lock → start to shoot in order to clear out all the air out of the system.Charge membrane carrier on the Leica loading system (Figure 2A, #2 and Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Loading the biological sample in the HPF pods. (1) 200 µm deep membrane carriers (Leica Microsystems); (2) Vertically grown Arabidopsis seedlings; (3) Becker filled liquid MS medium; (4) 20% BSA diluted in liquid MS medium; (5) 0.5-2 µl and 20-200 µl range pipets (Sartorius); (6) Torque screwdriver set to 30Ncm (TOHNICHI, Torque driver RTD60CN); (7) Disposable razor blades; (8) Style 7 EMS tweezers; (9) Disposable tooth picks; (10) Leica loading system (with rod), pods, pod holder.",
    "If using the 200 µm membrane carriers with a hole on the bottom, wedge an aclar disk generated with the puncher. Disks can be generated in batches the day before cryofixation, incubated in 95% ethanol and let to evaporate.With a 0.5-2 µl pipet, fill the carrier with 20% BSA (Recipe 2) in MS (Murashige and Skoog medium). It must form a clean dome in the socket without bleeding on the edges and with no air bubbles (Video 1).Handling of biological material: i) Roots are quickly dissected under binocular in MS medium on a glass slide with a sharp razor blade and then carefully picked up with a toothpick. ii) Cells are aliquoted in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube from the main 200 ml flask and are let to sediment down for a few minutes. Then, the cells are picked up by scratching from the green cell pellet visible at the bottom with a toothpick or a little metal spoon shaped scooper, Cells are then carefully placed in a membrane carrier. Every 2 to 3 HPF trials (~3 min time frame when two experimenters are implicated), replace the cells in the Eppendorf tube by fresh cells.Dispose the sample in the BSA bubble in the membrane carrier. It is best when the sample is completely submerged by the BSA (Video 1). Push the membrane carrier in the pod positioned in its special socket on the Leica loading system (Video 1).Screw the sapphire tight on the carrier using the TORX screwdriver (set on 2.5 cN m-1) (Video 1).Screw the white pod holder (Video 1).Load it in the Leica EMPACT machine and the loading stage and push the piston towards the left (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.",
    "Loading the pod containing the sample in the HPF machine On the touch screen tap on prepare → lock→ start. The system automatically flushes out the pod holder, making the pod loaded with the sample fall in a liquid N2 bath.At this stage the sample must never come out of the liquid N2, risking sudden devitrification and the waste of the sample (Video 2).Check the freezing rate and pressure rise on the touchscreen. It should look like in Figure 2C, where maximum pressure is reached ~20 msec before reaching final temperature. Place pod holder in the specially designed socket bathing in the liquid nitrogen (Video 2).Unscrew the pod holder (Video 2).Carefully release the clamping from the sapphire by unscrewing and then gently tug out the membrane carrier by tapping the pod against the bottom of the bath. Use insulated tweezers to manipulate the frozen membrane carrier (Video 2).Place the membrane carrier in the sample carrier dedicated to this usage and keep in liquid N2 (Video 2).When all samples are ready to be transferred for subsequent steps, place metal lids on the metal containers and quickly transfer the containers from the EMPACT bath to an intermediate liquid nitrogen container. Then transfer to AFS2 machine, already running, filled up with liquid N2 and pre-cooled to -90 °C.Freeze substitutionDuring the freeze substitution, it is important to always maintain the frozen hydrated samples in the cold, below -80 °C to avoid too much hexagonal ice formation (Dubochet, 2007). Therefore, never pick up the tubes out of the well and always use instruments, containers and FS solutions that have been precooled in the well for a good 15-20 min.Because Steps B7 to B9 are tedious, we would recommend at the beginning to devote a full day to it.",
    "Under a vented hood, dispatch cryomix (see Recipe 4) immediately after having added osmium into the screw top tubes (numbered with a Sharpie and wrapped in scotch tape to avoid washing out of the ink) and then dip the tubes in liquid nitrogen to freeze the cryomix (less volatile when frozen).Insert frozen cryomix containing tubes in the AFS well, inside the metal cups.While cryomix is still solid, carefully dispatch the frozen sample containing membrane carriers inside the cryomix tubes (maximum of 2 carriers/tube). During the thawing process of the cryomix from the -195 °C to -90 °C transition, the carriers will sink in the mix and freeze-substitution will start.Set the AFS as following:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102192755_9180.jpg(OPTIONAL but highly encouraged) At day +1 after the start of the FS, open the cryomix tubes and redispose the carriers at the bottom in such a way that the carriers do not lay on top of each other in order to maximise the exchanges between the mix and the samples. Also, a gentle shake can be given to the tubes.After completion of the -90 °C to -50 °C transition, the machine is on hold at -50 °C.Wash thoroughly every tube 3 times with ultra-pure acetone and then 3 times with ultrapure ethanol (Note 3).During the last wash, transfer the samples into a plastic mould container containing 100% ethanol.Carefully separate the samples from the membrane carriers in a plastic mould container using the microtools (Figure 3, #5 and #6). Use them to scrape the rim of the carriers to loosen the frozen BSA. If using 200 µm deep carriers (Leica Microsystems), the hole at the bottom can be used to push out the frozen sample by fitting the ultra-micro needle tool (Figure 3, #5, right one).",
    "Prior to the Transfer of the detached sample in the moulds with a 3 ml pipette, fill the moulds with cold ultrapure ethanol and let them cool down to -50 °C (Note 4).Note: During Steps B3 to B8, cryotubes should always be closed in between the baths in order to avoid sublimation of residual osmium tetroxide.Resin embeddingWhen all samples are in place in the adequate moulds, gently pipet out the excess ethanol from the moulds (see Note 3 for pipetting technique) and replace with 25% HM20 (see Recipe 5).The following incubation kinetic is just a guideline. Adapt according to your work days:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102193218_6881.jpgOn the last 100% HM20 bath, place the mould containers in the metal piece (Figure 3, #3) that has been cooled down to -50 °C before hand.Mount the FSP module and set the AFS as following:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102193309_4152.jpgTake out hardened resin blocks from their casts by either slicing the casts carefully with razor blades or, if using the pill-shape moulds, the blocks can be punched out using a hexagonal screwdriver placed on the bottom (Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Puncturing out the pill-shaped blocks. It requires a Wiha 353/SW 3.0x75 screwdriver for puncturing.UltramicrotomyGrid filmingBecause we embed our samples in HM20 Lowicryl, a more fragile resin than EPON, the sections need to be deposited on grids that have been coated with parlodion or formvar.Formvar-coated slot grids were purchased and useful because no grid bars can potentially block the imaging in high tilts. However, they are more fragile and very sensitive to shifts induced by resin retraction. For parlodion-filmed mesh grids, they are home-made as follows (Video 4):Fill a crystalizing dish, placed in a large Petri dish, with distilled water to the top.Rack the top of the crystalizing dish with a glass wand to flatten out the surface of the water.",
    "Pipet the parlodion solution with a Pasteur pipet and place the pipet vertically over the crystalizing dish. Let a drop fall on the surface of the water.Let the parlodion spread at the surface of the water.With clamps, remove this first film (used to eliminate potential dust and particles on the water surface).Repeat Steps D1b and D1c.Carefully place the grids on the floating parlodion film (opaque side face down on the film). Use the mesh desired (200 mesh/µm2 is optimal for better overviews and tilt series acquisition).With tweezers, gently place a Whatman type 41 absorbent paper (or equivalent absorption speed) on the floating grids and let it soak.Carefully remove excess parlodion film on the sides of the absorbent paper, either by tearing it away or folding it on top of the floating paper. This is to prevent excess film to fold onto the grids, resulting in a double layer of film on the filmed grids.To avoid rippling and/or sliding of the film, firmly grip the absorbent paper by the sides with 2 tweezers type 5X or like (which close automatically) and transfer the absorbent paper by flipping it over into a glass/plastic Petri dish.Let the Petri dish open for a day under ventilated hood, in order to let the filmed grids dry out.Quality check: Under the binocular of the ultramicrotome, pick up a filmed grid and by reflection look for a homogenous purple glare on the grid. Under the TEM, the grids may display a few little holes, which is fine. However, when a lot of holes occur, the parlodion solution may be contaminated with water and may need to be replaced.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4.

The following is some comments for properly performing these steps. For the study of PD, 90 nm or 180 nm thick sections were collected with the Leica Ultracut UC7 (Leica Microsystems).Producing serial sections can be useful for two main reasons: i) with one grid, more objects of interest, ii) serial tomography can be performed where the same structure is reconstructed on serial sections, making it possible to recover 3D volumes of structures a lot bigger than the section thickness (Kang et al., 2011). To do so, the block face needs to be reasonably small enough so that multiple sections can be placed on a single grid. Carving the block face in a trapeze shape will allow the sections to stick together as they are generated, creating a contiguous ribbon of serial sections that can be easily deposited on a single grid simultaneously. Although it is usually not a problem when using non-carbonated parlodion-filmed copper grids, if sections are repelled by the grids due to static charge during the collection step, grids can be glow-discharged prior to section collection.",
    "Depending on the EM voltage (more voltage equals more kinetic energy of the electrons, and therefore a better ability to image thick samples well) and the size of the structures of interest, thickness of the sections can vary from 90 nm to 180 nm. Finer sections, closer to 90 nm in thickness will yield slightly better x, y resolution, especially in medium range EM voltages as in our case. 180 nm and greater will allow better volume recovery at the expense of x, y resolution when imaged at 120 kV. In the case of PD study, simple ones have a diameter range from 20 to 40 nm thick, so 90 nm thick sections are appropriate. However, it has to be noted that PD can be of various lengths and sizes, especially when it comes to branched complex PD. Therefore they can extend to several hundreds of nm across the cell wall in all directions. In this case, increasing the section thickness grants better chances to fully recover the volume of the pores.Coating grids with fiducial markers (gold particles)Gold particles are used for the subsequent alignment steps required prior to tomogram reconstruction. Because pure colloidal gold tends to aggregate due to its inherent negative charge, it is often used diluted with BSA, making the spread of the gold more homogenous across the section.On a sheet of paraffin film, lay drops of gold solution (see Recipe 8) and water (Figure 5).Gently lay the grids on the gold drops for 20 sec approximately.(Optional) Gently pipet up and down the mixture to favor good contact between the grid and the gold. Sequentially lay the grids for a few seconds on two water drops to remove excess gold solution.",
    "Absorb the remaining liquid by approaching absorbent paper (Whatman paper Grade 5) on the side of the grid.Repeat Steps D3a to D3e on the other side of the grid in order to have gold particles on both sides.Let the grids dry prior to introduction in the EM (damages the ionic pump system otherwise).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102193818_2077.jpgFigure 5. Laying the fiducial markers on the grids. Typical setting for fiducial marker deposition on grid prior to tomography. Grids are first laid on top of the red drops (fiducial marker + BSA solution) for 15-20 sec then dragged consecutively in the water drops and carefully dried by the rim of the grid with absorbent paper. This process needs to be repeated on both sides of the grids."
