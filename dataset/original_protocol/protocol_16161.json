    "This protocol describes the preparation of MIFBs from paraformaldehyde (PFA)−fixed EDL muscles for immunofluorescence analysis. Throughout the protocol, EDL muscles should be handled only by their tendons to prevent damage and contraction of fibers. After isolation, MIFBs can either immediately be used for immunofluorescence staining or can be stored in PBS at 4°C.\nMaterials\nMouse\n70% ethanol\nFixation buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-rec-0004])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Bio Basic, cat. no.

Euthanize the mouse according to animal welfare regulations (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-bib-0006]).\n2. If not done before, perform cervical dislocation (also described in Donovan & Brown, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-bib-0006]) to rupture the spinal cord and neck vessels. This will lower pressure on the microvasculature and prevent bleeding into the muscle.\n3. Spray the whole animal with 70% ethanol for sterile working conditions (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0e55f58b-75af-4a19-ae69-c5428527c9a9/cpz1263-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Incubate 5 min at room temperature.\n16. Transfer the muscle into a well for washing (E.g., 12-well plate).\n17. Wash the muscle two times, each time for 5 min with room temperature PBS.\n18. Either store the muscle in PBS at 4°C or proceed with muscle fiber bundle isolation.\n19. Isolate muscle fiber bundles.\n         \nPin the EDL to the Sylgard plate on one of the tendons using 30-G needles in PBS (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-fig-0004]) and transfer the plate to an illuminated binocular microscope.\nUse curved Dumont tweezers to longitudinally separate a piece of the EDL muscle (white arrow) with parts of both tendons (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-fig-0004]). Handle the tissue only on the tendons and avoid pinching of muscle fibers.\nStore the remaining EDL muscle in PBS at 4°C.\nPin the separated piece of EDL to the Sylgard plate using one of the tendons (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-fig-0004]).\nCarefully separate fibers longitudinally by using two curved Dumont tweezers without pinching, until only bundles of 3-4 fibers remain (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.263#cpz1263-fig-0004]).

    "This protocol describes immunofluorescence staining of the basal lamina, MuSCs, endothelial cells, and FAPs on MIFBs using laminin, Pax7, M-cadherin, CD31, and PDGFRα antibodies. For removing buffers from the sample containing MIFBs, hold the reaction tube against a light source and use a one-piece transfer pipette with a thin opening hole. Remove as much buffer as possible, not leaving more than 100 μl in the tube. Work efficiently after the secondary antibody is applied and protect the sample from light. To add fresh buffer, tilt the sample and pipet the solution slowly against the wall of the reaction tube. Do not apply liquid directly to the MIFBs.
