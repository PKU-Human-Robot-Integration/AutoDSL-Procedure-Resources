    "NOTE: RNA is highly susceptible to degradation by ribonucleases (RNases). Take standard precautions to keep the RNA intact. Change gloves frequently. Use filtered pipette tips, nuclease-free plasticware, and nuclease-free chemicals in all steps of the protocol. Use nuclease-free or diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water for all solutions.\n1. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare Toeprinting buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mM KOAc, 2.5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mM spermidine.\n\t\nStore DTT and spermidine in single-use aliquots at -20 °C to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n\t\tNOTE: DTT and spermidine should be added to the toeprinting buffer immediately before use. A solution lacking DTT and spermidine can be stored at -20 °C.\nPrepare aliquots of 85 mM 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP) and 91 mM adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Store the aliquots at -20 °C.\nPrepare 450 mL of 6% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel mix: 67.5 mL of 40% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (19:1), 189 g of urea, 112.5 mL of 5x TBE (Tris/borate/thylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), and 120 mL of water. Dissolve the urea by warming in a 37 °C water bath or on a hot plate with stirring. Filter the solution (e.g., 0.2 μm nitrocellulose vacuum filter).\n\tNOTE: The solution can be stored at 4 °C for at least one month.\n\tCaution: Monomeric acrylamide is a neurotoxin which can be absorbed through the skin. Take great care to avoid skin contact (i.e., wear gloves, a lab coat, and eye protection). Polyacrylamide should also be handled with care, as polymerization may not proceed to 100% completion.\nPrepare formamide loading dye: 95% formamide, 18 mM EDTA, 0.025% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol. Store at -20 °C.",
    "Dissolve 1 nmol of primer (5' CTCGATATGTGCATCTGTA; 5' end-labeled with IRDye 800) into 100 μL of water for a working concentration of 10 pmol/μL. Store at -20 °C in single-use aliquots (approximately 10 µL), protected from light.\n2. Preparation of mRNA\nAmplify DNA templates for the synthesis of mRNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from appropriate templates (i.e., genomic DNA or plasmid DNA, as appropriate). Use a high-fidelity DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the following reaction conditions (35 cycles): melt, 98 °C, 10 s; anneal, 53 °C, 20 s; extend, 72 °C, 30 s.\n\tNOTE: The forward primer (5' AAGCTTAATACGACTCACTATAG) incorporates the T7 promoter sequence to allow for RNA transcription; the reverse primer (5' T51GAATTCGGATCCGACCGTGG) includes 51 thymine residues to provide a poly-A tail for the transcribed RNA. Note that RNA can also be in vitro transcribed from plasmid DNA.\nUse an appropriate transcription kit to in vitro transcribe IRES-containing RNA or capped RNA from the DNA template. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Prepare the RNA sample in standard 20 μL reaction volumes. Treat the newly-synthesized RNA with 2 units of RNase-free DNase for 30 min at 37 °C.\nDilute the DNase-treated RNA to 110 µL with nuclease-free water add 110 µL acid phenol, vortex 5 s and centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temperature. Remove 100 µL of the aqueous phase to a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, and vortex 2 s. Add, 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, vortex 5 s, and precipitate the RNA at -20 °C overnight.",
    "Centrifuge at >20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 500 µL of ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol and repeat the centrifugation. Aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible and air-dry the pellet for 5 - 10 min. Be careful not to dislodge the pellet.\nResuspend the RNA in the appropriate volume of nuclease-free water to yield a working concentration of 0.5 μg/μL. This can be stored at -80 °C or used immediately.\n3. Toeprinting Reaction\nMix 15 μL of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL, not nuclease-treated), 1 μL (40 units) of RNase Inhibitor, 1 µL of 91 mM ATP (1.82 mM final) and 1 μL of 85 mM GMP-PNP (1.7 mM final) in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Incubate at 30 °C for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: The RRL should be aliquoted for single use to avoid repetitive freeze-thawing. A critical control is a reaction lacking RRL, in order to elucidate the natural pauses of reverse transcription due to the secondary structure of the RNA. Add toeprinting buffer to replace RRL for this control. \nAdd 0.5 µg (1 µL) of RNA and incubate at 30 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 22 µL of Toeprinting buffer and incubate at 30 °C for 3 min.\nAdd 0.5 µL (5 pmol) of IRDye-labeled primer and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nAdd 2 µL of 25 mM dNTPs (final concentration: 1 mM each), 2 µL of 100 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 µL of Avian Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcriptase (AMV-RT) and 3.5 µL of Toeprinting buffer. The final volume is 50 μL.\nIncubate the reaction at 30 °C for 45 min.",
    "Add 200 µL of nuclease-free water and immediately extract with 250 µL of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH approximately 8.0). Vortex 5 s and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature. Remove the aqueous phase to a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube, add 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, vortex 5 s, and precipitate at -20 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge at >20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Wash the DNA pellet with 500 µL of ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. Centrifuge at >20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible and air dry the pellet for 5 - 10 min. Be careful not to dislodge the pellet.\nDissolve the pellet in 6 μL of nuclease-free water and add 3 μL of formamide loading dye.\n4. Sequencing Reactions\nUse the DNA template from 2.1 and the IRDye-labeled primer from step 3.4 for standard sequencing reactions, using dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) as chain terminators. Use an appropriate DNA sequencing kit and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\nMix 6 μL of each sequencing reaction with 3 μL of formamide loading dye.\n5. Preparation of Sequencing Gel and Electrophoresis\nNOTE: This protocol uses a fluorescence gel-based imager and a 21 cm x 23 cm x 0.2 mm gel, but can be adapted for other sequencers or gel-sizes, if required.\nThoroughly clean the 0.2 mm spacers as well as the short (23 × 25 cm) and long (30 × 25 cm) glass plates with 100% ethanol. Air dry.",
    "Mix 30 mL of 6% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel mix with 200 μL of 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS) and 20 μL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). Pour the gel, taking care to avoid bubbles, and insert the 'shark-tooth' gel comb. Allow the gel to polymerize for 1 h at room temperature.\nAssemble the sequencing apparatus and fill the reservoirs with 1x TBE.\nPre-run for 15 min at 1500 V until the optimal temperature of 55 °C is achieved.\nHeat the sample/loading dye mix (from steps 3.9 or 4.2) to 85 °C for 5 min. Load 1 μL onto the sequencing gel.\nRun the gel at 1500 V for 8 h. The machine will read the bands in real time.\nDisassemble the apparatus, and dispose the acrylamide gel and running buffer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
