If required to replace the Ef1α promoter with other promoters appropriate for their experimental purposes, please refer to Part 1.\nIf modifications of the pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN and pAAV-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC plasmids are not required, skip Part 1 and proceed directly to the production and purification of adeno-associated virus (AAV) (Part 2).\nPart 1. Replacing promoters of the plasmids\nTiming: 5 days\nThis section describes a cloning method for replacing the EF1α promoter of pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN and pAAV-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC plasmids with other promoters.\nNote: The Ef1α promoter can be replaced using the Mlu1 and Kpn1 restriction enzyme sites as illustrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. For example, CMV (cytomegalovirus), CAG (CMV immediate enhancer/chicken β actin), or CBA (modified chicken β actin) promoters can be used as alternatives for ubiquitous expression of transgenes (Gray et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; McCown et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Nathanson et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). In addition, hSyn1 (human Synapsin 1), CaMKII (Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinase II), or mDLX (mouse DLX5/6 enhancer, minimal promoter and chimeric intron) promoters can be used for specific neuronal expression (Dimidschstein et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Hoesche et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Nathanson et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nCloning of pAAV-CreN-InteinN and pAAV-InteinC-CreC plasmids containing a specific promoter.\nSynthesize the double-stranded specific promoter fragment that is appropriate for researcher’s experimental purposes.\nNote: To insert a specific promoter into the AAV vectors, the restriction enzyme recognition sequences for Mlu1 (5′-GCGCACGCGT-3′) and Kpn1 (5′-GGTACCGCGC-3′) in 5′ and 3′-regions, respectively, must be added to the synthesized promoter DNA fragment. The GCGC sequences are extra base pairs to ensure efficient digestion by restriction enzymes.\nIncubate 500 ng of the synthesized specific promoter DNA fragment with 1 μL Mlu1 and 1 μL Kpn1 in 1× reaction buffer at 37°C for 1 h.",
    "Isolate the specific promoter DNA fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis using a gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012661_GeneJET_Gel_Extraction_UG.pdf]\nCut each 500 ng of pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN and pAAV-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC plasmid with 1 μL Mlu1 and 1 μL Kpn1 in 1× reaction buffer supplied with restriction enzyme at 37°C for 1 h.\nIsolate and purify the 4,556 bp fragment from pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN and the 5,022 bp fragment from pAAV-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC plasmids using a gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012661_GeneJET_Gel_Extraction_UG.pdf]. Discard the 1,275 bp fragment originating from the Ef1α promoter of each plasmid.\nInsert the synthesized/cut promoter DNA fragment into the cut/linearized pAAV-CreN-InteinN or pAAV-InteinC-CreC vector using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011990_T4_DNA_Ligase_5_Weiss_200_Weiss_U_UG.pdf].\nTransform the ligated plasmids into Stbl3™ E. coli strain and spread the transformed Stbl3™ E. coli onto an LB agar plate containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, and then incubate at 37°C overnight (16–24 h).\nNote: We recommend using a competent Stbl3™ E. coli strain for the cloning. Stbl3™ E. coli carries a recA13 mutation in their genotype, thus reducing the recombination that occurs in cloned DNA containing repeat sequences such as the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) of AAV vector (Al-Allaf et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nInoculate a single colony into 5 mL of LB broth containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin and incubate at 37°C overnight (16–24 h) with shaking.\nCentrifuge the 5 mL of Stbl3™ E. coli at 5,000 × g for 5 min at RT (20°C–22°C).

    "Neutralize the enzymatic activity of trypsin by adding 10 mL of pre-warmed HEK293T cell culture media and suspend the cells by gentle pipetting using a 1 mL pipette.\nTransfer the suspended HEK293T cells (from the two dishes) to a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 3 min at RT (20°C–22°C) and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 29 mL of pre-warmed HEK293T cell culture media.\nAdd the suspended HEK293T cells (approximately 5 mL each) dropwise into six 150 mm cell culture dishes containing 15 mL of HEK293T cell culture media.\nNote: Immediately after applying the suspended HEK293T cells dropwise into each dish, spread the cells evenly on the plate surface by gently shaking the plates.\nTransfection with plasmids into HEK293T cells for packaging of AAV.\nPrepare three plasmids required for packaging AAVs as below.\nAAV expression plasmids: pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN and pAAV-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC.\nAAV-specific serotype plasmids: AAV2/8 (AAV8) and AAV-retro helper plasmids.\npAd-deltaF6 plasmid (an AAV helper plasmid that carries the genes required to drive AAV replication).\nNote: AAV2/8 (AAV8) serotype, pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN, and pAd-deltaF6 helper plasmids are co-transfected into HEK293T cells to package AAV8-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN. AAV8 serotype mediates the gene expression anterogradely from cell bodies of neurons at injected sites to their axon terminals. It is reported that AAV8 does not exhibit transsynaptic transport to postsynaptic neurons (Zingg et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). AAV-retro helper, pAAV-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC, and pAd-deltaF6 helper plasmids are co-transfected into HEK293T cells to package AAV-reto-Ef1α-InteinC-CreC. AAV-retro serotype is known to transport retrograde from axon terminals to cell bodies (Tervo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nTwenty-four hours after seeding HEK293T cells, prepare a transfection mixture to transfect the HEK293T cells in six 150 mm cell culture dishes.",
    "Mix 90 μg of pAD-deltaF6 plasmid, 45 μg of AAV-specific serotype plasmid (AAV2/8 or AAV-retro helper plasmid), and 45 μg of AAV expression plasmid (pAAV-Ef1α-CreN-InteinN or pAAV- Ef1α-InteinC-CreC) in Opti-MEM (6 mL total volume).\nSeparately, mix 1 mL of 0.6 mg/mL PEI solution in 5 mL Opti-MEM and mix by vortexing.\nIncubate the two mixtures separately at RT (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nMix the two mixtures, vortex briefly.\nIncubate the final mixture at RT (20°C–22°C) for 20 min.\nAfter incubation, add 2 mL of the transfection mixture dropwise to each 150 mm cell culture dish containing 18 mL of HEK293T cell culture media, and gently shake the plates.\n6–12 h later, aspirate the media transfection and add pre-warmed 22 mL of fresh HEK293T cell culture media.\nCollection and lysis of transfected HEK293T cells.\nSeventy-two hours after transfection, scrape the transfected HEK293T cells (including cell culture media) off the 150 mm cell culture dish using a cell lifter.\nTransfer the cells and media from two transfected 150 mm cell culture dishes to a 50 mL tube using a 1 mL pipette.\nRinse the cell culture dish with 3 mL PBS and transfer it to the same 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 450 × g for 5 min at RT (20°C–22°C).\nDiscard the supernatant by aspiration with a pasture pipette.\nRepeat the collection step (4a–4e) two more times to collect all the cells from the six 150 mm cell culture dishes (two dishes at a time). The same tube can be used for pelleting cells from all the dishes.\nPause point: The collected cell pellet can be stored at −80°C for later AAV purification.",
    "Note: Before disposing of the supernatant, the collected supernatant in the flask should be treated with 10% bleach in volume. Used culture dishes should be washed with 10% bleach solution before being discarded.\nPrepare a dry ice/ethanol mixture bath and warm up the water bath to 37°C.\nResuspend the transfected cell pellet with 4 mL cell lysis buffer.\nFreeze the pellet in the dry ice/ethanol mixture bath for 10 min, then thaw in a 37°C water bath for 10 min. Occasionally, shake the cell suspension thoroughly to lyse the cells and release the AAV particles.\nRepeat the freeze-thaw cycles four times.\nPause point: Before the fourth thawing, the frozen cell suspension can be stored at −80°C.\nNote: The frozen cell suspension stored at −80°C should be thawed in a 37°C water bath for 10 min to proceed to the next step.\nAdd Benzonase to a final concentration of 50 U/mL and vortex briefly.\nIncubate the tube in a 37°C water bath for 30 min to degrade DNA in the cell lysate.\nCentrifuge at 3,500 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant containing AAV particles to a new 15 mL tube. The volume of the supernatant is approximately 5 mL.\nNote: The supernatant can be stored at 4°C during the preparation of the iodixanol gradient.\nPurification of AAV.\nNote: Purification of AAV follows Zolotukhin and Grieger's method (Grieger et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Zolotukhin et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) with some modifications.\nMake 15%, 25%, 40%, and 60% iodixanol solutions of the desired volume (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nNote: Prepare multi-layered iodixanol density gradient tubes during Benzonase treatment (steps 4k–4m).\nPrepare two 32 mL Beckman OptiSeal ultracentrifuge tubes to purify AAV8-CreN-InteinN and AAV-retro-InteinC-CreC.",
    "Add 5 mL of 60% iodixanol solution to the bottom of each tube using a 10 mL syringe with a 19-gauge needle.\nOverlay 5 mL of 40% iodixanol solution on top of the 60% iodixanol layer using the same needle and syringe. Gently load the solution along the wall to avoid disturbing the gradient.\nContinue the same way with 6 mL of 25% iodixanol solution and 9 mL of 15% iodixanol solution, respectively (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Take care to avoid bubbles forming inside the syringe. Tap the syringe to remove bubbles. The gradient can be disturbed if air bubbles are loaded into the OptiSeal ultracentrifuge tube.\nAdd 5 mL of the supernatant containing AAV particles collected in step 4n to the iodixanol gradient tube by dripping slowly along the wall onto the top layer of the gradient.\nFill up the iodixanol gradient tube with cell lysis buffer until the solution surface reaches the hole-neck of the tube.\nBalance all the iodixanol gradient tubes with cell lysis buffer to make them identical in weight, and then seal the tubes with black caps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCritical: When inserting the black cap into the hole, ensure that no air remains in the tube to prevent from collapsing.\nCentrifuge at 462,000 × g (67,000 rpm) in Beckman Type 70 Ti rotor for 1 h at 18°C.\nNote: After ultracentrifugation, the 40% iodixanol layer contains AAV particles. Cell debris and proteins are in the 25%–40% iodixanol interface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nCarefully carry the rotor, remove the tubes from the rotor with sterilized forceps, and place the tube on the holding stand in the biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare a 10 mL syringe with a 19-gauge needle.\nRemove the black cap before puncturing the tube.",
    "Carefully puncture the tube below approximately 1–2 mm of the 40%–60% interface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F) with a 19-gauge needle with the bevel up (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nWithdraw 3–4 mL of the AAV-containing 40% iodixanol layer from the bottom of the layer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nCritical: We recommend collecting < 80% of the layer to avoid contamination with cell debris and cytotoxic proteins at the white-band interface between 25% and 40% iodixanol layers (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4H).\nConcentration of AAV.\nMoisten the filter membrane of Amicon™ Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (100 kDa MWCO) by adding 4 mL of PBS followed by centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the flow-through.\nAdd the collected AAV fraction into the pre-wet Amicon™ Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units.\nCentrifuge at 4,500 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure that the flat surface of the filter membrane is perpendicular to the direction of the fluid flow to improve the filtration efficiency.\nDiscard the flow-through and add 4 mL of pre-cooled PBS to the top of the filter.\nCentrifuge at 4,500 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nRepeat steps 6d and 6e until the AAV solution becomes clear and the volume is approximately 50–100 μL. Usually, four times centrifugations are required.\nCollect the AAV solution from the filter and transfer the AAV solution to a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove possible protein debris remaining in the concentrated AAV solution.\nTransfer the supernatant containing AAV particles (approximately 45–95 μL) to a 1.5 mL tube.\nAliquot the AAV solution into 10 μL and store it at −80°C for long-term storage.\nNote: Take a 2 μL AAV solution for AAV titration.\nTitration of AAV using real-time qPCR.",

Determine the titration of AAV samples as viral genome copies per mL. Multiply the titration of the AAV stock by 100 because the AAV sample is diluted to 1:100 ratio (from step 7b). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: Usually, virus titers are between 1 × 1013 and 5 × 1013 copies/mL. Virus titers should be high enough (> 1 × 1013) to express the genes with small volumes (tens to hundreds of nanoliters) to avoid any mechanical damage due to large volume infusion into the brain.\nPart 3. Preparation of surgical area and injection station\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to prepare the surgical area, surgical supplies, stereotaxic instruments, and glass micropipettes.\nNote: All surgical procedures should follow the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol.\nUsing an autoclave, sterilize surgical tools and supplies, including forceps, fine scissors, and cotton swabs. Disinfect the surgical area with sporicidal disinfectant (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2125-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Viral injection for PFC-BLA circuit-selective genetic manipulation\nTiming: 4 h",
    "This section describes how to anesthetize the mouse and immobilize the mouse head in a stereotaxic instrument. Also, it explains how to puncture the skulls and inject the AAV8-CreN-InteinN and AAV-retro-InteinC-CreC into the PFC and BLA, respectively.\nNote: To visualize the neural circuits manipulated by our split-Cre reconstitution system, we used Ai-14 Cre-reporter mice. Animal surgeries were performed as follows, according to our previous reports (Kim et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nInduction of anesthesia and fixation of mouse head in stereotaxic instruments.\nPlace the mouse in a sealed anesthesia induction chamber supplied with isoflurane gas at 2%. This induction takes around 1–2 min.\nTake out the anesthetized mouse from the chamber and shave the hair of the mouse head using an electric hair clipper/trimmer. When the mouse awakens from anesthesia during shaving, place it back in the anesthesia induction chamber.\nFix the head in the stereotaxic frame with two ear bars and a nose clamp equipped with a gas anesthesia head holder (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nSupply 2% of isoflurane gas to the anesthesia head holder.\nEnsure that the mouse is in deep anesthesia by monitoring the reflex from the toe-pinch. If the reflex is absent, the isoflurane gas can be reduced to 1%. During surgery, the depth of anesthesia should be monitored by periodical toe-pinches.\nCritical: The mouse head should be fixed horizontally to the base plate and vertically to the ear bars without any medial-to-lateral or front-back movements.\nApply eye lubricant to protect eyes from drying.\nDetermination of drilling points in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2125-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Both the AP axis and ML axis of the skull must be horizontal to the plate of the stereotaxic instruments to generate accurate coordinates of anatomical brain locations. The AP, ML, and DV refer to the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and dorsal-ventral axis, respectively.\nAdjust the inclination of the mouse head so that the bregma and lambda are on the same horizontal plane. The difference in DV coordinates between bregma and lambda must be less than 0.05 mm.\nSet the coordinates of the bregma as the origin of coordinates.\nConnect a high-speed stereotaxic drill with a round 0.5 mm burr to a stereotaxic manipulator.",
    "Rotate the AP and ML modulators to position the tip of the burr to move above the left PFC with the following coordinates (AP: +2.5 mm; ML: +0.8 mm).\nLower the tip of the burr by rotating the DV modulator slowly under a surgical microscope until the tip reaches the skull surface.\nCarefully drill through the skull bone by lowering the burr slowly under a surgical microscope. Drill the target skull point until the dura mater beneath the skull is visible (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C). Dura mater is often punctured during drilling. If not, tear the dura mater with a 30G needle tip. Be careful not to injure the brain parenchyma. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCritical: Occasionally, bleeding occurs while puncturing the skull. In this case, stop the bleeding by pressing the hole with a small cotton swab dipped in sterilized cold PBS. Bony powder and excess blood should be cleaned. Cover the hole with sterilized PBS-soaked cotton to keep the brain surface moist before viral injection.\nReposition the bur tip to the bregma.\nDrill holes in the skull of the right PFC and bilateral BLA in the same way as the steps 13i–13k (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D and 6E). We recommend the PFC coordinates as [AP: +2.5 mm, ML: ±0.8 mm] and BLA coordinates as [AP: -1.8 mm, ML: ±3.3 mm] in male mice aged 8 weeks.\nNote: The PFC and BLA coordinates in male mice were modified and optimized based on the C57BL/J6 mouse brain atlas of Allen Institute.\nInjections of AAV8-CreN-InteinN and AAV-retro-InteinC-CreC into the PFC and BLA, respectively.\nConnect a Nanoject II microinjector to a stereotaxic manipulator.\nCut the tip of the glass micropipette with fine scissors to obtain a long and sharp tip.",
    "Critical: The sharp tip of the glass micropipette should be long enough not to damage the brain surface due to being pressed by the unpulled portion (shoulder) of the glass micropipette when the tip reaches the BLA coordinates.\nFill the glass micropipette with mineral oil using a 28-gauge microfil flexible needle. When filling with mineral oil, remove any air bubbles in the glass micropipette. Air bubbles can impede the flow of virus solution during the injection.\nMount a filled glass micropipette into the microinjector.\nThaw the AAV solutions on ice.\nCritical: As transduction efficiency decreases by 10% each after the second and third freeze-thaw cycle, avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles of AAV to prevent a decrease in the transduction efficiency of AAV (Howard and Harvey, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). If you need to use the same AAV within a week, store the remaining AAV at 4°C.\nNote: Materials contaminated with AAV, such as pipette tips and glass micropipettes, are disposed of in a waste bottle containing 10% bleach.\nPlace a piece of parafilm (∼ 1 cm2) onto the mouse head in the stereotaxic frame.\nTransfer a drop (1–2 μL) of AAV8-CreN-InteinN virus solution onto the parafilm to make it easy to load the virus into the mineral oil-filled glass micropipette.\nCritical: Total amount of AAV should be more than the sum of the allocations for bilateral brain injection plus the extra amount. Note that 300 nl of AAV8-CreN-InteinN (5.1 × 1013 copies/mL) and 200 nl of AAV-retro-InteinC-CreC (1.0 × 1013 copies/mL) are injected into the PFC and BLA in each hemisphere, respectively. A new glass micropipette must be used for each virus. However, the same glass micropipette can be used to inject the same AAV into bilateral brain regions.",
    "Move the glass micropipette above the drop of AAV8-CreN-InteinN on parafilm. Under a surgical microscope, rotate the DV modulator to position the tip of the glass micropipette within the droplet of AAV8-CreN-InteinN.\nLoad the AAV8-CreN-InteinN slowly by pressing a Fill button on Nanoject II. Avoid air bubbles forming in the glass micropipette.\nDiscard the parafilm into the waste bottle containing 10% bleach solution.\nRemove the PBS-soaked cotton used for covering the left drilled hole.\nMove the glass micropipette above the drilled hole of the left PFC (AP: +2.5 mm; ML: +0.8 mm) and lower its tip by rotating the DV modulator slowly until the tip is close to the surface of the brain. Set the surface as a reference point for the DV coordinate.\nPenetrate the brain by lowering the tip until it reaches -1.5 mm depth from the surface. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nLeave the glass micropipette in place for at least 10 min before injection.\nInject 300 nl of AAV8-CreN-InteinN into the PFC at a flow rate of 15–20 nl/min while slowly rotating the DV modulator until the tip reaches -0.5 mm from the brain surface (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F). See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nAfter injection, place the glass micropipette in the end position (DV: -0.5 mm) for an additional 5 min to allow viral diffusion and to prevent backflow of the virus.\nRetract the glass micropipette slowly until the tip completely leaves the skull.\nMove the tip of the glass micropipette filled with the same virus above the right PFC with the coordinates AP: +2.5 mm and ML: -0.8 mm by rotating the AP and ML modulators.\nInject the 300 nl of AAV8-CreN-InteinN into the right PFC the same way as above.\nReplace with new mineral oil-filled glass micropipette and load with AAV-retro-InteinC-CreC for injection into BLA.",
    "Move the glass micropipette above the drilled hole of BLA (AP: -1.8 mm; ML: ±3.3 mm) and lower its tip slowly until the tip is close to the brain surface.\nPenetrate the brain by lowering the tip until it reaches -4.3 mm depth from the brain surface.\nAs described in steps 14n–14q, inject 200 nl of AAV-retro-InteinC-CreC into each BLA (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G). The end position for BLA injection is -4.0 mm from the brain surface.\nCritical: An injection volume of less than 300 nl (titer: 5.1 × 1013 copies/mL) into the cell body region (PFC in this case) is recommended because virus injections of more than 300 nl induce transneuronal transport by an unknown mechanism.\nClose the wound with a medical-grade surgical suture. Apply povidone-iodine to the suture site to prevent possible infection in the surgical wound.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage which is placed on a heating pad until it awakens and recovers from anesthesia.\nMonitor the health status of the mouse and administer carprofen at a dose of 5 mg/kg via IP after surgery.\nAllow the virus to express and reconstitute the split-Cre in the PFC-BLA neural circuit for at least 2 weeks. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nPart 5. Imaging of PFC-BLA circuit-selective genetic manipulation\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes perfusion, brain section, and imaging methods to visualize the PFC-BLA neural circuit.\nNote: To image the PFC-BLA circuit manipulated by our split-Cre reconstitution system in Ai-14 Cre-reporter mice, we conducted a circuit tracing, according to our previous reports (Kim et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPerfusion and fixation of mice two weeks after the AAV infection.\nDeeply anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane in an anesthesia induction chamber.\nPlace the mouse on a perfusion plate and open the thoracic cavity to expose the heart using fine scissors.",
    "Insert the 25 gauge blunt needle into the left ventricle and make a small incision in the right atrium using fine scissors.\nPerfuse 50–100 mL of ice-cold PBS containing 25 U/mL heparin (5 mL/min flow rate) using a peristaltic pump.\nPerfuse 50–100 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA (5 mL/min flow rate).\nExtract the brain and immerse it in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight (16–24 h).\nAfter fixation, replace 4% PFA with 30% sucrose in PBS and allow the brain to equilibrate completely at 4°C for 2 days.\nSectioning of brain tissue.\nPlace the brain tissue on the petri dish and cut the brain into the right and left hemispheres along the midline.\nFor coronal sections, trim off the brain stem region so that the hemisphere lies flat.\nPlace a drop of OCT compound on the chilled cryostat chuck and mount the brain hemisphere on the chuck. Ensure that the olfactory bulb of the brain faces upward.\nCarefully pour OCT compound on top of the brain hemisphere and return the cryostat chuck to the cryostat.\nAllow the brain hemisphere to freeze in the cryostat for at least 30 min.\nInstall the chuck with the frozen brain hemisphere to the chuck holder and tighten the screw.\nCut the brain hemisphere into 50 μm coronal sections and collect the sections of the PFC and BLA regions.\nDAPI staining.\nPlace the sections containing the PFC and BLA regions into 12 well plate containing 2 mL of 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS per well.\nPlace them on an orbital shaker for 15 min at RT (20°C–22°C).\nStain nuclei of sections with 1 μg/mL DAPI in 2 mL of 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS for 15 min at RT (20°C–22°C) with shaking.",
