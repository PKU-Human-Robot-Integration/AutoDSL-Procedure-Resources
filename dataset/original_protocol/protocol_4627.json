    "Preparation of PepMV inoculaInfected freeze dried material with the PepMV-Sp13 isolate (Aguilar et al., 2002, kindly provided from Dr. M. Aranda, CSIC-CEBAS Murcia, Spain) was homogenized with a ratio 1:10 (w/v) in NaH2PO4 0.5 M phosphate buffer using a mortar and pestle, and used as a fresh virus inocula. Silencing of Hsp70 by quercetin applicationQuercetin was easily dissolved in DMSO in order to prepare an initial stock of 200 mM. The quercetin stock was subsequently diluted in a final concentration of 1 mM using a 10 mM Na2CO3 solution (e.g., 5 μl of 200 mM quercetin per 1 ml). DMSO alone was diluted accordingly to quercetin using the 10 mM Na2CO3 solution. Stock and working solutions of quercetin were always freshly prepared.One fully expanded leaf of 2 to 3 weeks old N. benthamiana plants (Figure 1) was totally (entirely) infiltrated, from the bottom side, using a syringe (Figure 2) either with 1 mM quercetin solution or diluted DMSO (control plants). Approximately to infiltrate an entire fully expanded leaf 1 ml of the corresponding solution was used.Viral infection by rub inoculationOne hour after the plant infiltration (kept at room temperature), the treated leaves with quercetin or DMSO were slightly dusted with carborundum. Five minutes later the leaves were mechanically inoculated with equal amount (~30 μl) of freshly prepared virus inocula. After the inoculation, plants were kept at growth chambers for four days at 25 °C and 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151204/20151204021520_7459.jpgFigure 1.

    "benthamiana leaves (bottom side) and the right panel shows the leaves after infiltration Analysis of the Hsp70 expression levels in Hsp70-silenced plants and the effect in viral InfectionFour days post PepMV inoculation the leaves of N. benthamiana plants treated with quercetin or DMSO were collected (Figure 1). Control plants did not show any phenotype.Total proteins were extracted from 0.1 g of plant tissue using 300 μl of protein extraction buffer. Briefly: after the grinding of the infiltrated leaves to a fine powder using liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, 0.1 g of tissue powder was homogenized using 300 μl of extraction buffer in 1.5 ml microtube (using pellet pestle sticks) and good vortex (2 min). 150 μl were mixed with 50 μl of 4x Laemmli buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. After a centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min the supernatant of the samples was used in the following steps. Small Rubisco unit protein was used for quantification of equal loading of total protein extracts in Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Figure 3C). After the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 12% gels, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membrane. Western Blot analysis was performed under standard conditions. Briefly, the blotted membranes were firstly incubated with the blocking buffer (1x TBS-T, 4% milk) for 1 hour at room temperature and subsequently with the primary antibodies (all conjugated to alkaline phosphatase [AP]), overnight at 4 °C. The following morning the membranes were washed 3 times and then incubated with the secondary AP-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, after washing the membranes 3 times, the blotted proteins were detected using the NBT/BCIP substrate.",
    "In this given example, the results showed that the application of quercetin for silencing Hsp70 reduced its protein levels up to 73% (Figure 3A). This reduction of Hsp70 in the case of our example on PepMV infection had a corresponding negative effect on viral accumulation up to 92% (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151204/20151204021603_2091.jpgFigure 3.

B2 panel is an overexposure of B1 and the asterisk indicates the faint CP band. In panel C the small unit of Rubisco protein stained with Coomassie brilliant blue served as protein loading control (LC)."
