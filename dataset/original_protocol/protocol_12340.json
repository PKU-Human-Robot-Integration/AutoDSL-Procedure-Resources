    "The experimental procedures and ethical treatment of animals was approved by the University of Pittsburgh IACUC (protocol #1104674).\n1. Preparation of G6PD Staining Mixture\nNOTE: Ensure that the final concentration of each reagents is as follows; 5 mM glucose-6-phosphate (G6P); 2 mM NADP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.35 mM 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate (MMPMS) and 0.8 mM NBT.1,8,9  For each reagent the initial concentration was derived for a 40 ml final volume. Solutions were freshly prepared and used each day.\nAdd 2 ml of 200 mM pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (PB) to 35 ml of OCT medium in a 50 ml tube and shake vigorously. Confirm with pH paper that the solution is ~pH 7.4. If not discard the solution.\nAdd 61 mg G6P dissolved in 0.94 ml of 200 mM PB, 61 mg NADP dissolved in 0.94 ml of 200 mM PB, and 41 mg MgCl2 dissolved in 0.96 ml of 100 mM PB. Reconfirm that the pH is ~7.4 with pH paper. If not ~7.4, discard the solution.\nAdd 5 mg of MMPMS dissolved in 0.25 ml of 200 mM PB (pH 7.4). Vigorously shake the resulting reaction mixture to generate a clear dark red homogenate. If the solution is turbid, the mixture should be discarded. The tube containing the reaction mixture is wrapped in foil to minimize exposure to light. Store the reaction mixture at RT while the final component, NBT, is prepared.\nPrepare separately a 5 mM NBT solution by adding 0.4 ml anhydrous dimethyl formamide (DMF) and 0.4 ml anhydrous ethanol to 164 mg of NBT in a 2 ml tube with an O-ring lid. Close the lid loosely (not tightly sealed) and bring the solution to a vigorous boil in an oil bath until the NBT is in solution.8",
    "Allow the solubilized NBT to cool to RT and then add all of the solution to the OCT reaction mixture and shake vigorously to obtain a clear solution. Observe the solution color change from initial orange-red to a dark-red or purple color over time. This is normal.\nPlace the final G6PD staining mixture in a 37 °C warm room for 1 hr before use.\n2. Animal Treatment and Tissue Collection\nTreat 6-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice with DNA damaging agent, e.g., 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) in a volume of 200 µl PBS by i.p. injection. Treat control mice with 200 µl of PBS by i.p. injection.\nAt 90 days, euthanize mice by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation as approved by IACUC protocol.\nSurgically open the abdominal cavity from just above the anus to the base of the sternum. Move the small intestine out of the body cavity but do not excise it. Excise the lower intestine just below the cecum to the rectum.10\nCarefully slice along one side of the colon using a micro-dissection scissor and remove feces from the opened colon by washing with clean sterile PBS. Swiss roll the excised colon with the luminal side facing outward, and place in a tissue mold.10\nCompletely immerse the colon in OCT medium and place mold in a Dewar containing liquid N2. Hold the mold so that the plastic base is just in contact with the liquid N2 until the OCT medium is frozen solid.\nStore the frozen tissue block at -80  until cutting frozen sections. Do not use any fixative, which would result in the inactivation of the G6PD enzyme.\n3. Preparation of Frozen Sections",
    "Cut frozen tissue sections at a thickness of 7 µm using a cryostat at -25 °C. Cut 4 consecutive 7 µm sections and place two of them on the same slide (Figure 1). Prepare 2 slides, or four consecutive 7 µm sections to represent one level of the colon (Figure 1).\nRepeat for the next level with a minimum distance of >50 µm from the last section of the previous level. This distance ensured that the crypts assessed for each level did not duplicate one another.\nFrequently wipe the cryostat blade with 100% ethanol to remove the OCT residue that accumulates during cutting. Before sectioning is resumed, the dry blade is wiped with an antistatic dryer sheet to dissipate accumulated static charge. Store slides with the frozen sections at -80 oC.\n4. Staining of Frozen Section Tissue\nPerform the enzyme histochemistry reaction in a 37 °C warm room with high humidity.\n\tNOTE: Attempting the enzymatic reaction in an incubation oven or on a slide warmer led to poor and inconsistent G6PD staining.\nBuild wells for tissue staining using two 1.5 cm x 0.15 cm steel washers (interior diameter x height) that are bonded together using silicone grease (Figure 1). Cut the parafilm to fit the base of the well with the center cut out and the well placed over the tissue section on the slide.\n\tNOTE: The parafilm on the bottom of the washer creates a seal between the slide and the washer that maintains the viscous G6PD staining mixture on the tissue section. This construct gives a well with a 0.4 - 0.5 ml volume so that each tissue section in the study receives the same volume of the G6PD reaction staining mixture.",
    "Incubate frozen tissue slides at 37 oC in a warm room for 10 min. At 37 °C, add the G6PD staining reaction mixture to each tissue section well (2 sections per slide) for 45-50 min. Remove slides from warm room, and carefully lift the stainless steel wells off the slides.\nSet slides on their long edge to allow the reaction medium to drain. Place slides in 100 mM PB (pH 7.4) for 30-60 min to remove the G6PD staining reaction mixture from the tissue without disturbing the tissue staining. Submerge slides in distilled water for 5-10 min to remove PB salts\nSeal the tissue by adding fluoro-gel from a dropper onto the tissue and waiting ~ 30 min for it to dry. Avoid bubbles that can confound the identification of mutated crypts.\n\tNOTE: If bubbles form, the procedure can be repeated after removal of the fluoro-gel by soaking in distilled water. Do not use cover slips as they tend to trap air bubbles.\n5. Determination of G6PD Mutant Crypts and Mutation Frequency\nAnalyze slides for G6PD mutant crypts under a light microscope.\n\tNOTE: The criteria used to identify a fully mutant crypt were: (i) the entire crypt was devoid of blue color; (ii) the outer structure of the crypt was intact, (iii) the mutant crypt was observed on adjacent 7 µm sections and, (iv) two observers had to identify the same crypt as a mutant. Mutants observed on adjacent 7 µm sections are counted as one mutant.\nImage each G6PD mutant crypt at 40x magnification and catalogue the images using a 5.0 megapixel camera with imaging software.",
    "Quantify the total number of crypts examined in a mouse by selecting a representative section for each mouse from the level with the smallest surface area and image it at 10x magnification (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: A level represents four consecutive 7 µm sections (Figure 1D), which due to their proximity often show mutated crypts on more than one section. The levels are separated by >50 µm to visualize crypts from different areas of the colon.\nOpen each image file and visually count the number of crypts on a level by analyzing the files (shown as boxes in Figure 1C). Images files will vary in the number of crypts observed from as low as 20 to >300 crypts in one file.\nMultiply the total number of crypts from the selected level (Figure 1C) for each mouse by the number of levels screened for G6PD mutant crypts for each colon. For example, a total count of 1,250 crypts per selected level multiplied by 8 levels screened for mutant crypts equals a total count of 10,000 crypts. Evaluate a minimum of 10,000 crypts for each colon for statistical analysis.\nCombine the number of mutants observed in all of the animals by the total number of crypts screened to calculate the MF for each treatment. The background stem cell MF level in untreated mice is < 0.1x10-4 (Table 1), which is close to that previously reported in C57Bl/6 mice.11\nSubscription Required.
