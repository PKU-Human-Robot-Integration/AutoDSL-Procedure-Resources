    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nUS LN-FNA procedure\nTiming: 30 min\nThe following steps provide instructions on visualizing axillary lymph nodes by ultrasound and then guiding a 22–23 narrow-gauge needle into the germinal center of the lymph node to aspirate cells. It is critical to use “negative pressure” and a “to and fro” hand movement to gently aspirate cells from the GC of enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Finally, critical steps are required to thoroughly flush the syringe barrel several times into 50 mL conical tubes using R10 media to remove cells adhering to the plastic.\nTransport R10 media for US-LN-FNA in an Insulated Bio Transport Container as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2994-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Ultrasound-guided lymph node fine-needle aspiration\n(A) The ultrasound probe is positioned for optimal visualization over an enlarged axillary lymph node of the arm recently receiving an immunization of an investigational product (i.e., a “draining lymph node”).\n(B) Once puncture of the LN is visualized on US, negative pressure is applied to the syringe by withdrawing plunger to approximately the 2–3 mL mark on the syringe barrel using a gentle “to” and “fro” motion.\n(C) US image of a 23-gauge needle entering the cortex of an axillary lymph node. This procedure is repeated up to 4 times to gather a sufficient amount of sampling material.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2994-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. 50 mL conical tubes after FNA collection\nThe tube containing the sample “For Collection” shows a darker reddish color than the tube containing media “For Flushing” only.\nTwo 50 mL conical tubes labeled with the study participant’s ID number placed inside a Saf-T-Pak container filled with wet ice.\nThe first conical tube contains 10 mL of R10 media and is labeled “For Collection”.\nThe second conical tube contains 50 mL of R10 media and is labeled “For Flushing”.",
    "Ultrasound-Guided Lymph Node Fine Needle Aspiration:\nPlace the consented study participant into a supine position, with the arm of the targeted side raised above the head and resting on a pillow.\nScan the axilla by ultrasound (US) to identify potential LN(s) to be aspirated.\nCritical: At least one lymph node (0.7–1 cm in diameter or larger) must be visualized for the radiologist to proceed with the FNA procedure. Otherwise, the procedure is canceled.\nUtilize Color Doppler to confirm normal vascularity within a LN hilum and to identify potential vascular structures to be avoided during the FNA procedure.\nPlace a sterile drape on the study participant’s chest distal to the axilla to keep the US transducer sterile.\nPrepare the axilla by swabbing generously with chlorhexidine, betadine, or a similar skin disinfectant solution.\nCritical: Make sure that the participant is not allergic to any disinfectant solutions before they are applied to their skin. Although this is usually verified during the consent process, it should also be confirmed before every procedure. Any known allergies should be reviewed before the radiologist explains the procedure steps and potential complications.\nPlace a sterile cover over the US transducer before starting the FNA procedure.\nAdminister local anesthesia by infiltrating the axillary skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the LN that will be aspirated with 2–4 mL 1% lidocaine.\nIntroduce the lumbar puncture needle with attached syringe into the LN under direct ultrasound guidance (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nOnce the needle tip is visualized within the LN on US, apply negative pressure by withdrawing the syringe plunger to approximately the 2–3 mL mark on the syringe barrel.\nCritical: Sampling of the LN cortex is preferred, when possible.\nSlightly withdraw the needle and redirect it into the LN using a gentle “to and fro” motion.",
    "Perform mild rotations and movements of the needle within the LN cortex while the aspiration is being performed.\nRepeat step if needed in a brisk fashion to gather a sufficient amount of sampling material.\nCritical: All of the above steps are performed under real-time US imaging.\nWithdraw the needle and syringe from the LN maintaining negative pressure on the syringe.\nCritical: Most of the aspirated volume tends to be retained inside the needle or needle hub not reaching the syringe barrel. To obtain the highest yield, remove the needle and flush it with fresh R10 media multiple times as described below. Avoid bringing cells remaining in the needle into the syringe barrel as they could adhere to the barrel plastic wall or shearing of the cells may occur.\nSubmerge the tip of the needle into the 50 mL conical tube of R10 media labeled “For Collection”.\nCarefully expel all contents of the needle and syringe into the media.\nRemove the needle from the syringe barrel and keep the needle in the “For Collection” 50 mL tube.\nWithdraw 2–3 mL of R10 media from the tube labeled “For Flushing” into the unattached syringe.\nReattach the syringe to the needle and carefully expel the media through the needle into the 50 mL conical tube labeled “For Collection”.\nRepeat steps ‘2.p’ through ‘2.r’ two additional times by removing the needle, aspirating media from the “For Flushing” tube into the syringe barrel, reattaching the needle, and ejecting the media into the 50 mL conical tube labeled “For Collection” for a total of three flushes.\nDiscard the used lumbar needle and syringe in a biohazard sharps container.\nRepeat steps “2.h” through “2.t” for a maximum of 4 passes or as much as tolerated by the study participant to gather sufficient sampling material.",
    "Critical: Use a new spinal needle and syringe for each pass. Steps “2.p” through “2.s” must be repeated until three flushes are completed for each of the four passes (i.e., four needles/syringes).\nAfter all passes are complete:\nReplace the screw cap onto both “For Collection” and “For Flushing” 50 mL conical tubes.\nPlace the capped tubes on wet ice in the screw-top cylindrical specimen container.\nCritical: Ensure the sample was collected into the correct tube before disposal. The tube containing the sample usually shows a darker reddish color due to the aspirate's red blood cell (RBC) content (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In case of doubt, inform the biospecimen processing operator to process both tubes. Do not discard the “For Flushing” tube; send both tubes to the processing laboratory.\nPlace the screw-top cylindrical Saf-T-Pak specimen receptacle into an Insulated Bio Transport Container and transport the specimen over to the processing site.\nSamples remain on ice until they are processed.\nWipe off any remaining ultrasound jelly from the study participant’s skin.\nExert pressure with gauze if there is any bleeding from the skin puncture site(s) until the bleeding stops.\nApply an adhesive bandage to the skin.\nCell isolation, counting, aliquoting, and cryopreservation\nTiming: 2 h\nThe steps for processing the US-LN-FNA are similar to those for isolating, counting, aliquoting and cryopreserving PBMCs from a venous blood draw (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). However, there are fewer cells from aspiration than a venous blood draw, so much more care needs to be taken in their isolation from the R10 media.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2994-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A and B) (A) shows a bright-field image within the expected cell concentration and highlights an area containing red blood cells (red arrow in the zoomed-inbox) that are not shown in the combined fluorescent panel (B) since only nucleated cells are counted using AOPI. (B) Shows combined fluorescent images with counted live cells circled in green and counted dead cells circled in red (highlighted in the zoomed-in box by an orange arrow).\nProcessing Aspirate.\nPre-cool the centrifuge at 4°C.\nAlternatives: temperature fluctuations between 2°C to 8°C are acceptable throughout the whole process.\nCentrifuge aspirate in the 50 mL tube labeled “For Collection” at 325 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCritical: In case the clinical team indicates that the “For Flushing” tube may contain part, or all the sample collected, spin down both tubes and look for signs of sample collection (darker reddish color of the R10 media and small pellet containing signs of red blood cells). In case of doubt, continue processing both tubes.\nAfter centrifugation, look for a small red pellet (e.g., Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Panel A) and gently aspirate supernatant down to 10 mL using a serological pipette.\nCritical: Aspiration by vacuum can lead to cell loss.\nAspirate the remaining supernatant using a 1000 μL single channel pipette without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet, by slowly pipetting, in 1 mL of 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C).\nBring the volume to 50 mL with cold 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C) to wash the cells.\nCentrifuge sample at 325 × g for 10 min at 4°C (e.g., Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Panel B).\nAfter centrifugation, gently aspirate supernatant using methods previously described (4.c–4.d) and visually estimate the pellet size (e.g., Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Panel B).",
    "Critical: If a pellet cannot be visualized, the operator should proceed with sample processing considering that the pellet may be present but cannot be visually identified due to the low cell yield. Thus, resuspend the potential pellet in 1 mL of 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C) and proceed to item k.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 times the volume of cold 1× RBC lysis buffer 2°C–8°C. Example: 5 mL for a ∼500 μL pellet/residual volume.\nIncubate for 4 min at ambient temperature, gently agitating the sample by manual rotational movements.\nBring volume to 35 mL with cold 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C) to wash the cells.\nCentrifuge sample at 325 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCritical: If the pellet cannot be visualized after the first RBC lysis, the operator should proceed with sample processing (4.o), considering that the pellet may still be present but cannot be visually identified due to the low cell yield.\nIf significant redness in the pellet is still observed (e.g., Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Panel C), gently aspirate supernatant as previously mentioned (4.c–4.d) and proceed with a second RBC lysis (.i.e., repeat steps 4.i–4.l).\nCritical: If the pellet cannot be visualized after the second RBC lysis, the operator should proceed with sample processing considering that the pellet may still be present but cannot be visually identified due to the low cell yield.\nIf RBC lysis does not need to be repeated, proceed with item 4.o.\nGently aspirate supernatant as previously mentioned 4.c to 4.d) and re-suspend the pellet in exactly 2 mL of cold 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C).\nCounting of cells isolated from the aspirate.\nAdd 180 μL of 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C) into a 0.6 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Transfer 20 μL of the cell suspension into the microcentrifuge tube containing the PBS to create a 1:10 dilution. Pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.\nAdd 20 μL of acridine orange and propidium iodide (AOPI) cell viability dye to a new 0.6 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 20 μL of the 1:10 diluted cell suspension to the tube containing AOPI.\nMix thoroughly (final dilution of 1:20).\nTransfer 20 μL of the GCC/AOPI mix to one side of a labeled cell counter slide.\nUse the Immune cells, low RBC assay, on the Cellometer Auto 2000 to determine the cell concentration. Ensure that the dilution factor is set to 20.\nCritical: Using an automated system using a live-dead cell staining solution is highly recommended as it quickly allows for accurate determination of cell count and viability excluding platelets and red blood cells. The Cellometer Auto 2000 performs well with cell concentrations of 1.0 × 105 − 1.0 × 107. Samples out of this range may obtain suboptimal counting as the algorithm will not be able to identify overlapping fluorescent cells and may count cell debris. Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] shows an example of ideal cell concentration in bright and combined fluorescent fields.\nAlternatives: An equivalent automated cell counter may be utilized, and it is highly preferred over a hemocytometer. In case an automated counter is not available, cell viability analysis can be performed using a hemocytometer and a dye (i.e.,trypan blue) to selectively stain dead cells. Do not utilize a dye that will only determine total cell count (i.e., Turk’s Solution).\nAfter counting, bring the total volume to 35 mL with cold 1× sterile PBS (2°C–8°C) and centrifuge the tube containing the cells for 10 min at 325 × g at 4°C.",
    "Observe the formation of a cell pellet and discard the supernatant by hand aspiration as previously mentioned (4.c to 4.d ).\nCritical: If the pellet cannot be visualized at this stage, the operator should proceed with sample resuspension in CFM, considering that the pellet is present irrespective of low cell concentration.\nAliquoting and cryopreservation of cells from US-LN-FNA.\nResuspend the cell pellet with enough CFM to bring the cell concentration to 4000 cells/μL (4.0 × 106 cells/mL) or as required by the study protocol.\nAlternatives: If 1 mL aliquots cannot be made (e.g., remaining re-suspended cell suspension is between 0.5–1.0 mL), denote aliquot as “partial” and write the volume and number of total cells on the vial label. If the number of cells requires less than 500 μL of CFM, re-suspend with 500 μL (0.5 mL) and record the information.\nTransfer the cell suspension to cryovials in 1 mL aliquots.\nWrite the volume and the number of total cells on the vial label using a permanent marker or any other vial identification method (e.g., printed cryolabels).\nPlace filled cryovials into controlled rate cryofreezing container(s).\nStore a controlled freezing container for a minimum of four (4) hours and a maximum of 96 h at −80°C before moving the aliquots to cryoboxes.\nKeep samples at −80°C for up to two weeks, then transfer to Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) for long-term storage.\nPause point: After the US-LN-FNA is processed and properly cryopreserved, the sample can be stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen. Cells properly cryopreserved and thawed following best practices should not result in viability decrease greater than 10%."
