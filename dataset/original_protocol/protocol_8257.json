    "Each independent study using this test battery was approved by independent ethics committees, namely either the 'medical ethics committee of the Leiden University Medical Centre', Leiden, the Netherlands, or the 'Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek, Assen, the Netherlands.\n1. Computerized Test Battery Assessments\nNOTE: The test battery should be implemented under controlled conditions (e.g., light intensity, room temperature, and background noise) to minimize influence of exogenous factors on the subject's results. Tests that can be repeatedly performed should be administered at least once before drug administration to serve as baseline. The Table of Materials provides an overview of the materials and equipment of the test battery.\nAdaptive tracking test\nSwitch on the power of the test battery computer and turn on the computer and screens.\nSeat the subject in front of the (subject) computer screen and joystick.\nCheck which is the preferred hand of the subject and adjust the joystick accordingly.\nInstruct the subject to hold the joystick as a pen, with the arm resting on the table.\nStart the test script via the installed program.\nFill out the requested specifics such as subject and study number.\nExecute the test by clicking 'start' on the test assistant screen.\nMonitor the performance of the subject on the test assistant screen and encourage the subject to keep the circle around the dot if the subject cannot exceed difficulty factor 2.\nSaccadic eye movement and smooth pursuit test\n\tNOTE: The eye movement electrodes should be attached to the sites specified in the clinical study protocol based upon the 10-20 System of the International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology.\n\t\nIdentify the outer canthus of the right eye (i.e., the angle at the outer end of the fissure between the eyelids).\nRepeat this procedure for the left eye.",
    "Identify the place for the ground electrode 2 cm above the nasion (i.e., the root of the nose).\nThoroughly rub the sites of the eye electrodes using a cotton-wipe skin cleansing gel for bioelectrical measurement (see step 3.1) to decrease the skin impedance, and use a cotton-wisp stick.\nBe careful not to abrade the skin, but do not rub too softly. Wipe away the residual gel with a gauze.\nApply the three self-adhesive electrodes at the prepared sites.\nConnect the wires to the eye electrodes. Put your hand behind the press-button of the electrode to prevent it from pushing into the skin.\nDirect the wires along the ears over the shoulder of the subject to prevent the wires from hanging before the eyes.\nPlug the three wires in the electrode impedance meter.\nCheck the impedance on the display: if the impedance is over 5 kΩ, check the quality of the electrode-attachment.\nConnect the subject to the eye movement measurement system by plugging all electrodes into the telefector and connect its cable to the amplifier.\nInstruct the subject to place the head on the headrest and relax, to follow the light on the screen by moving the eyes, and to not move the head.\nStart the test script via the installed program. Fill out the requested specifics such as subject and study number.\nStart the test by pressing the spacebar upon the 'go' instruction on the test assistant screen.\nBond and Lader VAS\nInstruct the subject to score how they are currently feeling by using the mouse to mark the visual analog line presented on the screen.\nInstruct the subject that the most extreme points on the line represent the most extreme sensation imaginable.",
    "Start the test script via the installed program. Fill out the requested specifics such as subject and study number.\nInstruct the subject to start the test by clicking the mouse.\nBody sway\n\tNOTE: Subjects should wear flat shoes during this test. No instructions or other stimuli are presented on the computer screen.\n\t\nAsk the subject to stand in front of the computer, with a distance between the feet of about 10 cm, and arms hanging alongside the body.\nAttach the string that originates from the potentiometer built into the test battery computer onto the waist of the volunteer (e.g., the belt, or pants) by using the clip at the end of the string.\nAdjust the height of the table with the computer on it until the string is horizontal; a maximum deviation of 5 ° is acceptable. Ask the subject to close his or her eyes.\nStart the test script via the installed program. Fill out the requested specifics such as subject and study number.\nStart the test by clicking on 'Start Body Sway Sampling Session' on the test assistant's computer screen.\nVVLT\n\tNOTE: Volunteers are not allowed to write down words at any time during the whole test procedure.\n\t\nInstruct the subject that during the following automatic (visual) presentation of the words, the subject should name the words when they appear and remember them, and that at the end of the list, all words that are recalled should be named, each word only once.\nStart the test script via the installed program. Fill out the requested specifics such as subject and study number.\nInstruct the subject to read the written instructions displayed on the screen.\nTell the subject that the test will start when the subject presses the spacebar.",
    "Record the recalled words (correct, incorrect, and words mentioned multiple times) by clicking on the recalled words on the test assistant screen.\nPharmaco-EEG\n\tNOTE: The electrodes should be attached to the sites specified in the protocol, and locations are based on the 10-20 System of the International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology.\n\t\nMeasure and identify the exact location of the electrodes on the subject's head.\nThoroughly rub the site using a cotton-wipe stick and skin cleansing gel to decrease the skin impedance. Be careful not to abrade the skin, but do not rub too softly.\nStand behind the subject and attach the electrodes to the cleansed sites. Work from behind to the front.\nPut the cap of the electrode through the box with paste and wipe away the remainder by striking the cap along the brim of the box.\n\t\tNOTE: The cap should filled completely, but not overloaded with paste.\nPress the electrode on the cleansed site by spreading scalp hair if necessary. Push the electrode on the skin and be careful that as little hairs as possible are under the electrode.\nPut the wire of the electrode over the shoulder of the subject into the subject's lap.\nUse a small piece of hair to fix the electrode with the paste (which appears from the opening of the electrode cap), and an additional piece of hair (at a right angle to the other piece) with some paste to further fix the electrode to the skin.\nCheck whether the electrode impedances are below 5 kΩ and adjust if necessary.\nUse tape to bundle the wires and to fixate the bundle to the clothes of the subject.\nAttach the electrode wires to the recording equipment.\nOpen the EEG program on the computer.",
    "Instruct the subject to relax and to not move or speak for the measurement period.\nInstruct the subject to close the subject's eyes.\nStart the test script via the installed program.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6\nAssessment,Domain,Description,Description,Outcome values,Outcome values,Specifics\nAdaptive tracking test,\"Visuo-motor coordination, vigilance\",\"A circle moves randomly about the computer screen.
