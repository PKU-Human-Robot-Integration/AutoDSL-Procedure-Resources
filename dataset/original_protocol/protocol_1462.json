    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEmbryo harvesting and fixation\nTiming: ～2 h\nTo achieve high-quality preparations, we applied the hand devitellinization method to fix embryo samples. This method does not expose samples to methanol, which can destroy cell membrane and other structures (Hobro and Smith, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Hoetelmans et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (especially here, the methanol fixation method leads to weak integrin immunostaining signal). In addition, some reagents such as fluorescently labeled phalloidin, will not work if the embryos have been exposed to methanol.\nHarvest the overnight embryo plate of the fly cage in the morning. Add ∼2 mL halocarbon oil into the plate. Rotate the plate to let the oil evenly cover the plate surface.\nIdentify the embryos from early stage 16 using completed closed dorsal closure and three segments of hindgut as an identification mark under a stereomicroscope. Select ∼50–100 embryos using a micro dissecting probe through hand-picking to move them to a marked region on the plate.\nPrepare a small sized filter paper (∼1 cm2), put it on the Petri dish lid, and add one or two drops of bleach solution (prepared fresh daily) to infiltrate the filter paper.\nTransfer the embryos that have been harvested on the plate to the surface of the bleach-infiltrated filter paper.\nDechorionate these embryos in the bleach-infiltrated filter paper for ∼1–2 min until their chorion (egg shell) detached.\nPick up the filter paper (with embryos attached on top) by tweezer and attach this to a paper towel to dry it.\nAdd three drops of water onto the plate, move the dried filter paper (with embryos attached on top) to one of the water- drops to wash it for 10 s, pick it up and dry it with paper towel. Repeat this three times.",
    "Use a micro dissecting probe under a stereomicroscope to pick up the dechorionated and washed embryos (during this step, the embryos will simply attach to the probe) and move them into a 5-mL glass vial with ∼1 mL of formaldehyde-saturated heptane.\nIncubate the embryos in this solution on a nutator for 1 h at room temperature.\nUsing a glass pipette, transfer the embryos to a small petri dish lid. Allow the heptane to evaporate (∼30 s). Ensure that the embryos stay in the neck of the pipette when transferring them. Embryos entering the body of the pipette tend to stick to the sides and are lost. Also, the embryos tend to sink quickly toward the tip of the pipette. It is best to allow them to sink and to transfer them in one to two drops onto the petri dish lid.\nImmediately cover the embryos with PBS solution (∼2 mL) after the heptane evaporates.\nUsing a stereomicroscope to monitor the procedure, use a 23-gauge needle mounted on a 3-mL syringe to carefully poke a small hole at the surface of the vitelline membrane at the anterior end of the embryo. The vitelline membrane will open up and detach from the embryo.\nGently “push” the fixed embryos out from the vitelline membrane through the hole by applying pressure from the opposite end.\nThe membrane will remain stuck to the bottom of the petri dish lid and the devitellinized embryo will move into the PBS solution.\nAdd 100 μL Triton X-100 into the PBS solution in the petri dish lid. Pipette solution for a few times to mix the solution and allow the embryos to float up in the solution.\nCollect and transfer the devitellinized embryos to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube by using 200 ul pipette.",
    "Pause point: Store embryos at 4°C or proceed immediately with staining of the embryos.\nImmunostaining, mounting, and batch imaging\nTiming: 3–5 days\nTo achieve higher efficiency of imaging multiple embryos, we have improved the immunostaining steps, especially for embryo mounting. Here, we describe the process for imaging Fasciclin III (Fas3)/Spectrin and Tinman (Tin). Our lab is currently developing a Tin::GFP reporter line that will be made available once fully validated.\nRinse the fixed embryos with 1% BSA/PBT (PBS with 0.1% Triton added)\nWash the fixed embryos twice with 1% BSA/PBT. Each time keep the Eppendorf tube on the nutator for 20 min incubation.\nBlock the embryos were with 10% BSA/PBT for 1 h on the nutator.\nRemove the blocking medium and add primary antibodies (anti-Fas3 or anti-Spectrin 1:300, and anti-Tin 1:1000) diluted in 5% BSA/PBT. Incubate the primary antibody on a nutator in 4°C for overnight.\nWash the sample four times with 1% BSA/PBT for four times. Each time, lay the Eppendorf tube on a gently moving nutator for 10 min.\nAdd secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 for anti-Fas3/anti-Spectrin and Alexa Fluor 568 for anti-Tinman) diluted in 5% BSA/PBT for 2 h at room temperature, lay the Eppendorf tube on a gently moving nutator.\nWash procedure: three rinses with PBT. For each time, lay the Eppendorf tube on a gently moving nutator for 10 min.\nMounting: to increase the efficiency of imaging batches of embryos at the right orientation, we have implanted the mounting procedures as listed below (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1006-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Embryo mounting for batch imaging\n(A–F) Schematic illustrations of the double-side mounting steps of the Drosophila embryos for batch imaging of the heart cell alignment. See description in text for further details.",
    "Place a 22 × 50 mm coverslip on top of the microscope slide, and tape one end of the coverslip to the slide (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nTransfer the embryos (∼50–100) to the center of the coverslip and dry the samples by using filter paper (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAdd one drop of Aqua-mount medium on top of the embryos, and gently spread the medium.\nPut the slide under stereomicroscope and move the embryos next to each other in a line by using the probe, orientate the embryos to make sure that either dorsal side or ventral side is facing up (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nAdd another drop of Aqua-mount medium at the side of the embryos and gently angle the 22 × 22 sized coverslip over the sample with one edge touching the 22∗50 coverslip (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nGently lower the top coverslip over the sample and seal the top coverslip with nail polish. Keep the slide in dark for overnight to make sure the medium dry before imaging.\nImaging: As the embryos are aligned next to each other in a line, it will be easy to locate and image dozens of embryos in a batch. At the same time, as double-sided coverslips have been used, it will allow imaging the heart structure with higher efficiency.\nNote: during the mounting step, it is difficult to make sure that dorsal/ventral sides of all the embryos are facing up, thus by flipping the double-mounting coverslip, it increases the imaging efficiency.",
    "Optional: Sequential staining: In some cases, the two desired primary antibodies (e.g., anti-Fas3 and anti-Spectrin in Zhang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) originate from the same host species (e.g., mouse) and need to be stained within the same samples. Sequential staining can be applied. After finishing steps 1–8 for first primary antibody, apply post-fixation for 20 min with 4% formaldehyde/PBT, then, repeat from step 1 to step 8 for second primary antibody. However, please do note that for the sequential staining procedure, as the fluorescence pattern for second primary antibody will have some mixed signals from the first primary antibody, the more important primary antibody should be applied first. For example, in (Zhang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), we principally wanted to examine the expression pattern of Fas3 under different genetic perturbations and observe the cardioblast matching morphology at the same time. The anti-Fas3 primary antibody was used first and anti-Spectrin antibody was applied in the sequential staining steps.\nNote: Most primary antibodies can be reused a few times, i.e., store the primary after the first incubation at 4°C for further usage).\nNote: when aligning the embryos next to each other in Aqua-mount mounting medium, keep this process short (normally within half an hour), as the Aqua-mount mounting medium will become sticky after some time, which makes it difficult to move embryos. If the mounting medium become sticky, try adding another drop."
