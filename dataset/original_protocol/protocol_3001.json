Here we describe the procedure for a 6-well plate. If you use other plates, please calculate the concentration of LN521 according to the surface area (See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2750_14.csv\nNote: The culture medium, PBS, TrypLE Select and DTI should be warmed in a water bath at 37°C before use.\nThaw hESCs.\nMix 100 μL of LN521and 1,400 μL of PBS(+Ca2+/+Mg2+) (working concentration: 1 μg/cm2) and coat a well of a 6-well plate at 37°C for at least 2 h.\nOptional: The plate can be coated with LN521 at 4°C for overnight (15–22 h).\nSlowly thaw a cryovial containing approximately 500,000 cells using a water bath at 37°C until the cells are half-thawed, then immediately collect them in a 15-mL tube with 10 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium.\nCritical: Do not completely thaw the cells in the water bath to avoid cell death.\nCentrifuge the cells at 180 G for 3–5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nIn the meantime, wash the coated well with PBS(+Ca2+/+Mg2+) twice and add 2 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to prevent cell death.\nNote: A ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 drastically improves cell viability of single-cell dissociated cells.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.",
    "Seed the cells in a final volume of 3 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 in one well of 6-well plate.\nThe next day, change the culture medium to 3 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium without Y-27632.\nMaintenance of hESCs\nMaintain the hESCs in NutriStem hPSC XF medium until they reach 70–80% confluency, changing the medium daily. The volume of NutriStem hPSC XF medium should be increased from 3 mL to 8 mL according to the growth of the cells to avoid the medium turning yellow.\nPassage of hESCs.\nMix 100 μL of LN521 and 1,400 μL of PBS(+Ca2+/+Mg2+) and coat a well of a 6-well plate at 37°C for at least 2 h.\nDiscard the supernatant of the cells in culture and wash the cells with PBS(-Ca2+/-Mg2+) twice.\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE Select to the well and incubate at 37°C for 4 min.\nGently pipette to yield a single-cell suspension, add 1 mL of defined trypsin inhibitor (DTI) to inactivate TrypLE Select and then collect all cells in a 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 180 G for 3–5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nIn the meantime, wash the coated well with PBS(-Ca2+/-Mg2+) twice and add 1 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nSeed 50,000 cells in a final volume of 2 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nThe next day, change the culture medium to 2 mL of NutriStem hPSC XF medium without Y-27632.\nChange the medium daily until they reach 70–80% confluency (usually in 6–7 days).",
    "Repeat the entire process at least one more time.\nNote: We usually obtain 2-3 million cells from a well of 6-well plate when the cells reach 70%–80% confluency. But it depends on cell lines and culture conditions.\nNote: Handle carefully the plate when it contains large volumes of media to avoid spillage and contamination.\nOptional: Excess cells can be frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nResuspend cells dissociated in step 3 at 1 million cells/mL in STEM-CELLBANKER GMP-Grade.\nDistribute 0.5 mL per cryovial (500,000 cells/vial) and store at −80°C in a cold Cryo1˚C freezing container. Transfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen tank the next day for long-term storage.\nDifferentiation of hESCs into mDA progenitors\nTiming: 3 weeks (for all steps in this section)\nTiming: 2 days (for step 4)\nTiming: 1 h (for steps 4a to 4i)\nTiming: 11 days (for steps 5 to 10)\nTiming: 1 h (for step 11)\nTiming: 4 days (for step 12)\nTiming: 1 h (for step 13)\nTiming: 2 days (for step 14)\nDifferentiation of hESCs into mDA progenitors is performed in feeder-free culture conditions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) using LN511 to support midbrain development.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Please, ensure the quality of undifferentiated hESCs before starting the differentiation. hESCs should be 70–80% confluent at the start of the differentiation and should be a homogeneous population, without any sign of differentiation such as morphological changes (fibroblast-like morphology). Here we describe the procedure for a 6-well plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2750-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Critical: The concentration of CHIR99021 is essential for the cells to adopt a midbrain fate. The optimal concentration to specify mDA progenitors depends on the hESC line, the medium and the duration of CHIR99021 treatment.
