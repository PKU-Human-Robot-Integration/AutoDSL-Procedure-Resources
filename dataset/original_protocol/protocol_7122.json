    "Harvest of pulmonary vascular cells Inject C57/BL6 mice with a low-dose of LPS (20 ng in 0.2 mL of 100 ng/mL solution in PBS) via the tail vein using a 27 G needle and a 1 mL syringe.After 2 h, sacrifice the mouse by intraperitoneal pentobarbitone anesthetic overdose. Check the pedal reflex and confirm death by severing the femoral artery.Carry out midline thoracotomy to expose the chest cavity, clamp down the rib cage to both sides, and pull the diaphragm down with a hemostat clamp.Inject 20 units of heparin (0.1 mL of 200 units/mL solution) into the right ventricle via a 27 G needle and a 1 mL syringe.Perform tracheostomy and instill 20 mL/kg of air with a syringe to inflate the lungs.Pass a 4-0 curved-needle suture through the apex of the heart to secure it in place with clear visualization of both ventricles for subsequent cannulation (Figure 2, upper panel).Loop a 5-0 suture under the twist of the pulmonary artery and aorta and throw a loose knot.Loop a 2-0 suture under the apex of heart and throw a loose knot.Poke a hole in the right ventricle with a 25 G needle and insert PVC tubing (OD 0.61 mm × ID 0.28 mm) into the pulmonary artery (soften tubing end by pulling the end gently and ensure tubing is filled with perfusate) (Figure 2, lower panel).Tighten the 5-0 suture around the cannulated pulmonary artery, to secure the inflow cannulation.Poke hole in the left ventricle with 19 G needle and insert polyethylene tubing (OD 1.27 mm × ID 0.86 mm) into the left ventricle, taking care not to rupture the heart.Tighten the 2-0 suture around the apex of the heart to secure the outflow cannulation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4307/bioprotoc-12-03-4307-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Created with BioRender.com.Start perfusion with perfusion buffer (see Recipes) in a syringe pump at 10 mL/h for 1 min, to observe the outflow of blood into a 15 mL collection tube on ice.Increase perfusion to 50 mL/h for 12 min, to collect a 10 mL volume of pulmonary vascular cells.Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 10 min in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge with swinging-bucket rotor.To remove any residual plasma, wash perfusate cells twice with 5 mL of assay buffer (see Recipes).Resuspend cells in assay buffer (~1 mL) and place on ice.To analyze cell recoveries, pipette a small volume (e.g., 25 µL) into a 5 mL flow cytometry tube, and add an equal volume of fluorophore-conjugated antibody mix: anti-CD11b to identify granulocytes and monocytes; anti-F4/80 to identify monocytes; anti-Gr-1 to identify neutrophils and Ly6C-positive monocytes (Table 1). Incubate in a refrigerator for 30 min.Wash cells with flow cytometry buffer (see Recipes).Resuspend in flow cytometry buffer, add 10 µL of Accucheck counting beads, and analyze by flow cytometry.Generation and DiD fluorescence labelling of MVs in vitro Plate 4 × 106 J774A.1 cells in 60 × 15 mm culture dishes in a 5 mL volume of RPMI-1640/10% FBS. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2/air overnight.Remove media and gently rinse adherent cells three times with 5 mL of PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+).Gently pipette 3 mL of ATP (3 mM) in PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) onto cells and incubate for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO2/air. Extracellular ATP is used to induce rapid of release MVs from macrophages via activation of the P2X7 receptor signaling pathway.Harvest supernatant into microfuge tubes, place on wet ice to cool, and centrifuge in an angle rotor refrigerated microfuge at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cells.Carefully collect supernatant using a 0.",
    "2 mL pipette and transfer to fresh tubes. Centrifuge in an angle rotor refrigerated microfuge at 20,800 × g for 30 min at 4°C to pellet MVs.Carefully remove supernatant and discard. Wash again with 1 mL of assay buffer, and re-suspend MV pellet using 0.2 mL of assay buffer.Add 40 µL of a 30 µM DiD/Diluent C stock solution to the MV suspension (final DiD concentration: 5 µM) and incubate for 7 min in the dark at room temperature. Diluent C is used as a diluent for lipophilic fluorescent dye labeling of cell membranes.Wash MVs twice with 1 mL of assay buffer by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 30 min at 4°C.Carefully remove supernatant and re-suspend MV pellet in 0.2 mL of assay buffer.Transfer 5 µL of MV suspension to a 96 well black plate and dilute with 90 µL of PBS. Lyse MVs by adding 5 µL of Triton X-100 (10%). Determine DiD fluorescence in a Biotek FLx800 plate reader at 635 nm/680 nm excitation/emission wavelengths.Adjust MV concentration according to DiD fluorescence units (FU)/mL (see Data analysis).MV uptake assay Divide pulmonary vascular cells into microfuge tubes (1.5 mL) standardized to Ly-6Chigh monocyte density (1 × 105/mL) in a 0.5 mL volume.Add DiD-labelled MVs to cells (see Data analysis).Cover tubes with aluminum foil, place on a rotating wheel, and incubate at 37°C for up to 1 h.Place tubes on wet ice to cool and then centrifuge in an angle rotor refrigerated microfuge at 300 × g for 10 min to pellet cells.Discard the supernatant and wash cells twice at 300 × g for 10 min with cold PBS.Incubate cells with fluorophore-conjugated anti-F4/80, anti-CD11b, anti-Ly6C and anti-Ly6G (Table 1) in a refrigerator for 30 min.Wash cells with flow cytometry buffer.Resuspend in flow cytometry buffer and analyze by flow cytometry.",
