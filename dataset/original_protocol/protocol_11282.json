    "Samples were prospectively collected within the framework of the CIRCAN (\"CIRculating CANcer\") cohort based at the Lyon University Hospital following patient written consent. This study was integrated into the CIRCAN_ALL cohort. The study CIRCAN_ALL was recognized as non-interventional by the CPP South-East IV dated 04/11/2015 under the reference L15-188. An amended version was recognized as non-interventional on 20/09/2016 under reference L16-160. The CIRCAN_ALL study was declared to the IT and freedom correspondent of the Hospices Civils de Lyon on 01/12/2015, under the reference 15-131. Blood collection was performed when physicians observed the earliest indication of tumor progression.\nNOTE: Use all the reagents and materials outlined in Table of Materials with the respective storage conditions for pre-analytical sample preparation and immunofluorescence assay. Substituting reagents and/or modifying storage conditions could result in suboptimal assay performance.\n1. Decontamination of Spiral Microfluidic Device\nNOTE: Decontamination of the spiral microfluidic device is a requirement to remove all immunofluorescence background generated from bacteria contamination, explore the cytomorphology of CTCs, and be able to differentiate them from normal immune cells. The protocol is optimized for blood samples collected in K2EDTA tubes within 6 h after blood sampling and enriched using the spiral microfluidic device in clean conditions. Using this assay for other types of samples (other biological fluids) may require additional optimization. This decontamination protocol should be done once per week.\nPreparation of reagents\nPreparation of the diluent buffer\n\t\t\nSterilize 20 mL of diluent additive reagent using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and add directly to 1 L of 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS) ultra-pure grade (Table of Materials).\nSterilization of reagents and the input straw\n\t\t\nSterilize the RBC lysis buffer and resuspension buffer (RSB; Table of Materials) using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and stock in a new 50 mL polypropylene conical tube for each solution.",

Replace the plasma fraction by adding directly equivalent volume of PBS up to 7.5 mL.\nGently add RBC lysis buffer (Table of Materials) to blood sample to a final volume of 30 mL (for a K2EDTA tube) or 37.5 mL (for a cell-free DNA blood collection tube). Gently invert the blood collection tube 10x and incubate for 10 min at RT.\nNOTE: The blood sample turns darker red during RBC lysis. If no change (from dark red and opaque) is observed after 10 min, gently invert the tube 3x and leave to stand for another 5 min maximum. Do not leave the sample in RBC lysis buffer for more than 15 min because it can compromise the sample quality and assay performance.",
    "Centrifuge the lysed blood sample at 500 x g for 10 min at RT, with centrifuge brakes on (or highest deceleration speed). Use a Pasteur pipette or serological pipette to gently remove the supernatant until the volume reaches the 4-5 mL mark. Then, use filtered micropipette tips to remove the remaining supernatant.\nUsing a P1000 micropipette with a filtered tip, add 1.0 mL of RSB to the wall of the 50 mL centrifuge tube input tube. To avoid introducing bubbles into the mix, resuspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting up and down until the sample is homogeneous.\nAdd an additional 3 mL of RSB to the wall of the 50 mL centrifuge tube input tube (total volume 4 mL). Avoid introducing bubbles into the mix. Gently mix the cell suspension by gently pipetting up and down.\nNOTE: In the unlikely event that regular pipetting is unable to break down cell clumps (defined by being visible or blocking the pipette tip), filter the sample through a 40 μm cell strainer to remove any clumps. Add 150 μL of RSB to the sample to make up for volume loss from filtering. Note that this method is to be used sparingly and only when large clumps are observed.\nBefore proceeding to the enrichment step, check that the sample is free of excessive bubbles and if any are present, remove the bubbles and take care not to discard any sample. If tiny bubbles are present, their removal is not required.\nProcess the sample on the spiral microfluidic device.\n4. Enrichment of CTCs from Patient Whole Blood with the Spiral Microfluidic Device\nLoad a new spiral microfluidic chip. Load two empty 50 mL centrifuge tubes in input and output ports.",
