    "The institutional animal care committee approved all experimental protocols and animals were treated following the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, 1996. Male Yorkshire pigs (40–50 kg) were used to perform the orthotopic heart transplants (animal size can vary according to the investigators discretion and experimental goals).\n1. Donor Procedure\nAnesthetic induction and animal preparation:\n\t\nPremedicate the animal using an intramuscular injection of Ketamine (20 mg/kg), Midazolam (0.3 mg/kg), and Atropine (0.04 mg/kg). Perform anesthetic induction and maintenance using inhalational Isoflurane (end tidal concentration: 1%–3%) + 3 L/min O2 via face mask.\nConfirm anesthetic adequacy by ensuring a relaxed jaw tone and an absence of pain during toe pinch. Anesthetic adequacy needs to follow institutional guidelines.\nOnce anesthetic adequacy is confirmed, perform an orotracheal intubation using an endotracheal tube of size 6.5–8 mm.\nPlace an oxygen saturation monitor on the ear or bottom lip for continuous monitoring. Place the cautery electrode pad on the animal’s back.\nInsert a peripheral intravenous access via ear vein (e.g. 20 g Angiocath). Start a maintenance infusion (e.g. 0.9% NaCl). Administer 2 g of Magnesium Sulfate to prevent arrhythmias.\nInsert a percutaneous central venous sheath introducer using the Seldinger technique into the right jugular vein if right-sided heart catheterization and cardiac output measurements are to be performed. Place the animal in Trendelenburg position to facilitate venous access. Alternatively, this can be done in the left internal jugular vein. If access cannot be established, this step may be performed following midline sternotomy by dissecting the internal jugular vein (left or right) and inserting the sheath directly.\nDonor heart procurement:",
    "Perform a midline sternotomy from the mid cervical region to below the xiphoid process using a cautery pen. Open the sternum with a bone saw. Ensure adequate hemostasis throughout the entire procedure (e.g. cauterize sternum, and/or application of bone wax).\nIn the cervical region, retract the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the center and dissect the right carotid artery (alternatively, this can be done with the left carotid artery). Place an arterial access line (e.g. 20 g Angiocath) into the right carotid artery for invasive arterial pressure monitoring.\nDissect and remove the thymus from over the pericardium. Gently lift the thymus from the pericardium, using the cautery, and dissect the structure from the pericardium. To prevent bleeding, cauterize the small vessels that originate from the aorta and superior vena cava (SVC) to irrigate the thymus.\nOpen the pericardium. Dissect the aortopulmonary space using the cautery. For this, have the assistant retract the right ventricular outflow track inferiorly and the pulmonary artery to the left and have the surgeon retract the aorta to the right. Do this carefully to avoid direct lesions to the pulmonary artery.\nClear the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta from connective tissue. Carefully retract the right ventricular outflow tract and place a purse-string suture using a 4-0 prolene on the proximal ascending aorta adventitia (avoid full thickness sutures). Secure this suture with a tourniquet.\nAdminister 30,000 units of heparin (>300 U/Kg) to achieve systemic anticoagulation. Insert the cardioplegia delivery cannula (e.g. DLP aortic root cannula) into the ascending aorta between the purse-string suture previously placed and secure by tightening the tourniquet. Prepare the cardioplegic solution that will be used and connect to the delivery cannula.",
    "Open the SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC), and the left inferior pulmonary vein to ensure adequate cardiac venting. Place the aortic cross-clamp on the distal ascending aorta (above the cardioplegia cannula). Alternatively, the left ventricle can be vented by opening the left atrial appendage and placing suction.\nInitiate cardioplegia infusion targeting an aortic root pressure of 80 to 100 mmHg.\n\t\tNOTE: The authors applied a model using 1.5 L of a standard extracellular hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution at 4 °C. Different solutions and volumes can be used according to the experimental set-up.\nPlace ice slush (0.9% NaCl) in the thoracic cavity and over the organ for cooling following initiation of cardioplegia. After the cardioplegia infusion is finished, proceed with cardiectomy in a traditional manner. Section the aorta and the pulmonary artery after the innominate artery and at the bifurcation, respectively, to ensure sufficient length for implant.\nAfter removal, place the organ in an organ bag with at least 500 mL of preservation solution (standard extracellular hyperkalemic solution). Place this on ice and keep at 4 °C. This step can be modified according to the experimental design and objective.\n2. Recipient Procedure:\nAnesthetic induction and animal preparation:\n\t\nPerform anesthesia and monitoring as described in the donor procedure (steps 1.1.1 to 1.1.6).\nAfter inserting the percutaneous central venous sheath introducer into the right jugular vein, insert a central venous catheter (e.g. double-lumen) into the left jugular vein using the Seldinger technique. Alternatively, this can be done after the midline sternotomy as described above.\nCardiopulmonary bypass (CPB):\n\t\nPerform the midline sternotomy and expose the heart and great vessels as described in the donor procedure (steps 1.2.1 to 1.2.4).",
    "Dissect between the SVC and the innominate artery, and the IVC and pericardium using the Metzenbaum and “right-angle” forceps. Encircle the SVC and IVC using an umbilical tape (alternatively a simple O silk suture can be used). Secure each tape/suture with a tourniquet.\nPlace 2 concentric purse-string sutures using a 4-0 prolene suture on the distal ascending aorta adventitia (avoid full thickness sutures). Place purse-string sutures using 4-0 prolene on the IVC and the SVC at the level of the pericardial reflection. Secure these sutures with tourniquets.\nDuring CPB preparation, have an assistant setup and prime the system according to the investigators’ and experimental needs. The current procedure uses the same setup used as the institution’s Cardiovascular Surgery Division and employs the help of a trained perfusionist. The bypass system is primed with 2 litres of crystalloid solution (e.g. Plasmalyte) with 500 mg of Solumedrol.\nAdminister 30,000 units of heparin (>300 U/Kg) to achieve systemic anticoagulation. Activated clotting time (ACT) should be above 300 s, if the test is available.\nCannulate the aorta with a 17 to 21 F arterial cannula. Use an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) cannula (e.g. EOPA arterial cannula) inserted using the Seldinger technique to facilitate this step and avoid blood loss. Alternatively, a standard bypass arterial cannula can be used.\nConnect the cannula to the arterial line of the bypass circuit using a 3/8-3/8 connector. Ensure complete deairing to avoid air embolism.\nPerform a bicaval cannulation. For this, cannulate the SVC and then the IVC using 24 to 28 F right angled single-stage venous cannula (e.g. DLP single lumen angled venous cannula).",
    "First, make a small incision (5 mm) at the center of the purse-string suture. Dilate the incision with a small angled instrument (e.g. right angle or a snap). Insert the cannula directing the angle superiorly in the SVC and inferiorly in the IVC (away from the heart). Secure by tightening the tourniquet holding the purse-string suture.\nBetween each step, cover the incision with a finger to avoid excessive bleeding. Connect the cannulas to the venous line of the bypass circuit using a 3/8-3/8-1/2 Y connector. Ensure deairing to avoid an airlock in the system.\nInitiate CPB. Adjust flowrates to maintain an arterial pressure above 50 mmHg (approximately 4 L/min). Maintain normothermia throughout the procedure.\n\t\t​NOTE: These settings can be modified according to the experimental design. Vasoactive medications should only be administered during CPB if needed to aid in pressure regulation (e.g. epinephrine infusion).\nDonor heart implantation:\n\t\nAfter initiation of CPB, open the left pleura and retract the native heart to the right. Dissect and encircle the left hemiazygous vein using a sharp dissection instrument (e.g. Metzenbaum) and a right-angle, respectively. Ligate distally with an O Silk tie. Only one ligature is needed as the native heart will be removed.\nCross-clamp the recipient aorta proximally to the arterial cannula. Snare both vena cava with the tourniquets previously placed using O silk ties. Remove the recipient’s native heart. Alternatively, the heart can be arrested using standard hypothermic blood-based cardioplegia.\nDuring cardiectomy, make sure to maintain large cuffs in the recipient to facilitate donor heart implant. For this, section the aorta and pulmonary artery proximally, close to their roots. Similarly, the left and right atriums must be kept with large cuffs. Leave the right and left atrial appendages in the recipient cuffs, which may be needed during the anastomoses.",
    "Prepare the donor heart for implant.\n\t\t\nDissect the pulmonary artery off the left atrium and separate the pulmonary artery completely from the aorta. Leave at least 2-3 cm of each vessel to be trimmed during implant as needed. Ligate both vena cava with an O silk tie. Unite all pulmonary veins, creating a single left atrial cuff to be anastomosed.\nCompare left atrial cuff sizes (donor and recipient) and trim each as needed to become similar sizes. The recipient’s left atrial appendage can be shortened, or the donor’s left atrial roof and appendage can be opened for this.\nDeliver the first cardioplegia dose to the donor heart using the previously placed cardioplegia cannula as described in step 1.2.6. Cardioplegic protective solution consists of 500 mL of a 2:1 mixture of blood:crystalloid containing 24 mEq of potassium and delivered at 10°C. Achieve the desired potassium concentration by adding potassium chloride to the cardioplegic mixture.\nAfter the completion of each anastomosis, deliver an additional dose of 300 mL of cardioplegia at 10 °C containing 8 mEq of potassium.\nFollowing all anastomoses and before removal of the aortic cross-clamp, administer an additional dose of 500 mL of warm (37 °C) blood cardioplegia with 8 mEq of potassium.\nRemove the donor heart from storage and implant with the standard biatrial anastomotic technique in the following sequence: left atrium, right atrium, pulmonary artery, and aorta. Use a 4-0 prolene suture with a SH needle for the left and right atrium, and the aorta and a 5-0 prolene suture with a BB needle for the pulmonary artery.",
    "Left atrium: place a 4-0 prolene suture at the junction between the left atrium and the IVC (right inferior margin) and another at 180° from the first, connecting the donor and recipient cuffs. Complete the posterior wall anastomosis. Complete the anterior wall anastomosis. This is performed from the superior suture to the inferior suture.\nRight atrium: open the donor right atrium from the appendage towards the IVC, creating a donor cuff that matches the recipient cuff size. Starting at the inferior angle (junction between IVC and right atrium), complete the interior wall anastomosis and then the lateral wall.\nPulmonary artery: trim the edges of both recipient and donor pulmonary arteries to create matching sizes. Place a 5-0 prolene suture at the left lateral wall uniting donor and recipient vessels and another at the right lateral edge. Complete the inferior wall anastomosis and then the anterior wall anastomosis.\nAorta: trim as described with the pulmonary artery. Place a suture on the left lateral wall connecting donor and recipient vessels. Complete the inferior wall and then the anterior wall anastomosis.\nPerform single layered anastomoses, except for the pulmonary artery, where a double layered anastomosis is required. The porcine tissue is extremely fragile and should be handled carefully to avoid tears. Importantly, the pulmonary artery anastomosis is the most delicate step of the implant and must be done with extreme care. The implant technique can be modified according to the surgeons’ preference and the experimental design.\nFollowing completion of all anastomoses and warm cardioplegia dose delivery as described above, remove the aortic cross-clamp. Inspect all anastomoses for sites of bleeding, they should be corrected at this point.",
    "Reperfuse the donor heart for 60 min on CPB. Ventricular arrhythmias can be treated with internal defibrillation (20-50 J). If required, ventricular pacing can be used to maintain a heart rate of 100 beats per min. Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Magnesium Sulphate) can be used at the investigators discretion, if required.\nAfter 60 min of reperfusion, administer 1 g of calcium chloride. Initiate weaning from CPB by decreasing the flow to half, then one-quarter and then off. The central venous line can be used to monitor central venous pressure, targeting 10 mmHg. Initiate infusion of vasoactive and inotropic medications (e.g. dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin) according to the experimental design or the investigators’ discretion.\nWeaning is deemed successful if the animal maintains a systolic arterial pressure above 60 mmHg for over 30 min after discontinuation of CPB. As this is not a survival model, do not reverse the heparin; continuous bleeding can occur from needle holes and dissected structures (e.g sternum). Donor hearts respond well to small and repeated doses of volume replacement using the CPB system. Additionally, the porcine model responds well to dobutamine.\n\t\tNOTE: The recipient management should be tailored to the investigators’ experience and the experimental design. A cardiac anesthesiologist may aid in this manner.\n3. Graft Assessment:\nFunctional assessment:\n\t\nThis large animal model has the advantage of having an open chest approach at all times, which facilitates direct functional assessment. To measure cardiac contractility, use pressure-volume (PV) loop analyses, echocardiography, and/or right-sided catheterization.",
    "Pressure-volume loops10: Place an umbilical tape around the IVC, and insert a PV conductance catheter into the left ventricle through a small apical ventriculotomy to permit continuous measurements of left ventricular PV relations. Obtain steady-state recordings to generate volume-dependent parameters (e.g. developed pressure and stroke work) and then obtain occlusion recordings in triplicate by occluding the IVC to generate volume-independent parameters (e.g. preload recruitable stroke work).\nEchocardiography: have cardiac anesthesiologists obtain epicardial images using a standard transesophageal probe.\nRight-sided catheterization: Insert a Swans-Ganz catheter through the venous sheath placed at the beginning of the procedure and guid towards the pulmonary artery. This enables the measurement of central venous pressure, right ventricular pressure, pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output using the thermodilution technique.\nPerform contractile evaluation at baseline and following 2 and 3 h post-reperfusion of the donor heart in the recipient. This can be modified by the investigators according the experimental design.\nMetabolic assessment:\n\t\nFor metabolic assessments, collect arterial and venous (alternatively: mixed venous) blood samples and store the plasma for subsequent analyses. Real-time blood gas analyses and lactate levels should also be obtained.\nCollect these samples at baseline in the donor, before procurement in the donor, at baseline in the recipient, and at 15, 30 and 60 min of reperfusion of the donor heart (after removing cross-clamp). This can be modified according to the experimental design.\nExperiment termination and euthanasia:\n\t\nOnce all assessments are finished, exsanguinate the recipient animal into the venous reservoir of the CPB circuit by opening the venous line clamp. Alternatively, exsangination can be achieved by harvesting the cardiac alograft to collect samples (i.e. myocardial biopsies).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
