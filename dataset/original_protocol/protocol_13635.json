    "All Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Eight Edition, National Research Council (US) 2011. Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chongqing University Cancer Hospital, Chongqing, China. Male BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice weighing 20-30 g, obtained from commercial sources (see Table of Materials), were used for allogeneic heart transplantation study. The C57BL/6 mice were used as donors and syngeneic recipients, while the BALB/c mice served as allogeneic recipients. A schematic of the protocol is shown in Figure 1.\nNOTE: All supplies used during surgery, including surgical instruments and solutions, are sterile. The surgical procedure adheres to the principle of aseptic operation technique.\n1. Recipient procedure\nInduce general anaesthesia via inhalation of 5% isoflurane through a 15 x 10 x 10 cm induction chamber connected with a hood (see Table of Materials).\nFix the recipient mouse on the operating table with a heating pad. Maintain anaesthesia with continuous inhalation of 2% isoflurane through a face mask over the nose and mouth.\n\t​NOTE: Slow respiratory rate and rhythm, the disappearance of the corneal reflex, and the absence of the pedal reflex in the toes indicate the effectiveness of anaesthesia.\nAfter shaving the hair, disinfect the surgical area with three alternating rounds of povidone-iodine scrub followed by alcohol. Then, incise the skin 1.5-2 cm parallel to the cervical midline from the right mandibular angle to the tail-end.\nDissect ~1 cm of the right external jugular vein using an electro-coagulator and micro-forceps. Clip the vein at the proximal end with an atraumatic microvascular clamp and ligate it at the distal end.",
    "Pass the distal end of the vein through a 22 G polyurethane barbed cuff (see Table of Materials) with a bevel end and superficial grooves. Fix the vein with the handle of the cuff using a microvascular clamp.\nRemove the 8-0 ligation suture at the distal end, turn the lumen over the cuff hooked by the superficial barb inside out and fix with a 10-0 surgical suture in the grooves of the surface.\nResect the right sublingual gland to form a fossa for implanting the cardiac graft, and reserve the right lobe of the submaxillary gland and the right sternocleidomastoid.\nDissect the right common carotid artery for ~1 cm using micro-forceps, and clip the artery with an atraumatic microvascular clamp at the proximal end. At the distal end, ligate and cut off the artery.\nPass the distal end of the artery through a 26 G polyurethane barbed cuff (see Table of Materials) with a bevel end and grooves on the surface. Fix the artery with the cuff's handle using a microvascular clamp.\nRemove the ligation suture at the distal end, turn the lumen inside out over the cuff, and fix with a superficial barb and grooves with a 10-0 surgical suture.\nAfter preparing the recipient's vessels, drop 100 IU/mL of heparin saline on the vessels to prevent thrombosis. Cover the cervical incision with sterile wet saline gauze for subsequent implantation.\n2. Donor procedure\nEmploy the same anaesthetic procedure (step 1.1) for the donor mouse.\nShave the abdominal hair using an electric razor, and disinfect the surgical area with three alternating rounds of povidone-iodine scrub followed by alcohol.\nIncise the abdomen (2-3 cm) with a scissor along the midline from the symphysis pubis to the subxiphoid, and expand the incised area with a retractor.",
    "Dissect 1 cm of the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava using an electro-coagulator and a micro-forceps, and perform heparinization by injecting 1 mL of physiological saline supplemented with 250 IU/mL of heparin through the inferior vena cava. After this, excise the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava.\nExcise the thorax along the anterior axillary line on both sides using a surgical scissor to separate the chest wall. Ligate the superior vena cava with an 8-0 surgical suture.\nInsert a scalp needle at the suprahepatic inferior vena cava. Then, inject ice-cold physiological saline supplemented with 100 IU/mL of heparin through the scalp needle from suprahepatic inferior vena cava to perfuse the donor heart until the blood color fades.\nRe-perfuse the donor heart with 2-3 mL of ice-cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution (see Table of Materials) using a scalp needle from the aortic arch to protect the donor myocardium. The mean warm ischaemia time is 5 min.\nLigate the superior and inferior vena cava and the pulmonary vein with a 5-0 surgical suture. Dissect and cut off the donor aorta and pulmonary artery before their branching. After that, divide the superior and inferior vena cava and the pulmonary vein to remove the donor's heart.\n3. Implantation\nImplant the donor heart into the cervical pocket of the recipient mouse in an inverted position.\nPull the cuff with an everted recipient jugular vein into the lumen of the donor pulmonary artery to perform end-to-end anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient external jugular vein. Ligate the cuff using the grooves on the surface through a 10-0 surgical suture to fix the anastomosis.\nEmploy a similar procedure for end-to-end anastomosis of the donor aorta to the recipient carotid artery.",
    "Release the atraumatic microvascular clamp of the jugular vein followed by the carotid artery to re-perfuse the donor's heart. The mean cold ischaemia time is 15 min.\nFix the cardiac graft and suture it properly to prevent twisting of the graft.\nClose the cervical incision with continuous sutures using a 5-0 polyamide monofilament suture (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Remove the suture after the wound is completely healed. \nRetain the recipient mouse inside a warm, dry, and clean cage until it recovers from anaesthesia.\n\tNOTE: It takes 5-10 min to recover.\nInject buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously into the recipient mouse every 6 h for 48 h for postoperative analgesia.\n\tNOTE: The analgesia dosage was optimized for this study. However, the analgesia regimen can be extended/ modified if there is any sign of pain in accordance with the institutional animal use guidelines. \nSubscription Required.
