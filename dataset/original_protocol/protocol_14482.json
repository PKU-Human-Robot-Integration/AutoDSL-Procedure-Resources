    "1. Preparation of Components of the Dosators\nPerforate the bottom of a 0.5 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube by drilling or by simply grinding or cutting off the bottom with a grinding wheel or a sharp pair of scissors. Ensure that the hole is in the center and is no more than 2 mm in diameter and no less than 1 mm in diameter (Figure 1).\nPerforate the top of the microcentrifuge tube. Using a #22 drill bit (approximately 4 mm in diameter), drill a hole in the center of the cap. This results in a hole that will fit a slip-tip syringe (Figure 1).\nPrepare the fine screens to be inserted into the microcentrifuge tubes. Make screens from 304 stainless steel wire cloth, 60 x 60 mesh with wire diameter of 0.0045\". Cut the screens with tin snips or punch them using a die to an outer diameter of 5 mm (Figure 2).\n2. Assembly of the Dosators\nUsing either forceps or the end of a blunt tip needle, insert the screen into the microcentrifuge tube and seat it in the bottom so that it covers the opening. This will serve to support the powder before actuation.\nPress fit the narrow end of the microcentrifuge tip into the end of a blunt tip needle. Do this by hand or with a bench-top press and a guide. Gently wipe the top of the needle and bottom of the tube with ethanol to clean the parts to ensure a tight, resilient fit.\n3. Filling the Dosators\nUsing an analytical microbalance, tare the device and load the desired amount of powder into the dosator. A typical powder mass for dispersion ranges from 1 to 10 mg.",
    "Once filled, plug the top of the microcentrifuge tube with an allotment of cotton and a pair of forceps. This will prevent the powder from drawing into the syringe or falling out, while allowing airflow through the dosator to disperse the powder.\nClose the microcentrifuge tube cap.\nIf not being used immediately, seal the top with a small amount of lab-film to minimize powder exposure to ambient moisture. NOTE: Generally, preloaded dosators should be stored according to storage requirements of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Often aerosol powders are moisture sensitive and should be stored desiccated.\n4. Device Actuation\nDraw back the syringe to the desired volume, which may be application specific. For intrapulmonary administration in guinea pigs, use 2 mL. Dispersion efficiency is related to the volume and velocity of air delivered during actuation, as well as the inherent dispersion properties of the powder 7. The top hole of the dosator accommodates a slip-tip syringe. A Luer-lock syringe may be used with an adapter.\nInsert the syringe into the back end of the dosator.\nInsert the needle end of the dosator into the dosing port on the exposure chamber. Depress the syringe forcefully, expelling powder out of the device and directly into the animal or into the exposure chamber or analytical instrument (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
