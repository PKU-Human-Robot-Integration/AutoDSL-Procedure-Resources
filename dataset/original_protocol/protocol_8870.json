    "1. Preparation of Culture Media\nPrepare mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) medium by combining the following: 445 ml DMEM, 50 ml fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 5 ml 100x penicillin/ampicillin stock solution. Keep filter sterilized medium at 4 °C for no more than 14 days.\nPrepare serum-containing hPSC culture medium by combining the following: 385 ml DMEM/F12, 100 ml knockout serum replacement (KSR), 5 ml 100x non-essential amino acid stock solution, 5 ml 100x penicillin/ampicillin stock solution, 5 ml 100x -mercaptoethanol stock solution, and 10 ng/ml bFGF. Keep filter sterilized medium at 4 °C for no more than 10 days.\nPrepare mTeSR1 serum-free medium by combining the following: 400 ml mTeSR1 basal medium, 100 ml 5x supplement, and 5 ml 100x penicillin/ampicillin stock solution. Keep medium at 4 °C for no more than 10 days.\nPrepare 10x collagenase IV stock solution: weigh out 0.5 g collagenase IV power, and dissolve it with 50 ml DMEM/F12 and filter sterilize. Make aliquots and stock them at -20 °C for months.\nPrepare 0.1% gelatin solution: weigh out 0.5 g gelatin (from bovine skin, type B) power and dissolve it with deionized water. Keep autoclave sterilized solution at room temperature for weeks.\nPrepare KSR differentiation medium by combining the following: 410 ml DMEM, 75 ml KSR, 5 ml 100x non-essential amino acid stock solution, 5 ml 100x penicillin/ampicillin stock solution, 5 ml 100x -mercaptoethanol stock solution. Keep filter sterilized medium at 4 °C for no more than 10 days.\n\tNOTE: KSR varies from lot to lot, which may affect the differentiation efficiency. It is therefore better to test several batches of KSR to find the best one for differentiation.",

Culture of hESCs and hiPSCs on MEF Feeder Cells\nThe H9 hESCs were obtained from WiCell Research Institute and hiPSCs were established in the Reijo Pera laboratory through retrovirus-mediated transduction of Yamanaka factors OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC18.\nAt least one day before cell passage, prepare some gelatin plates by adding 1 ml 0.1% gelatin to 1 well of 6-well plates, and incubate plates at 37 °C for at least 30 min.\nAfter incubation, aspirate gelatin from plates, and seed irradiation inactivated MEF cells onto the plates at the density of 1.6 x 105 cells/well in MEF medium using a hemocytometer to count the cells.\n\tNOTE: Optionally prepare MEF feeders as early as 3 days before cell passage.\nPassage cells one day after plating MEF feeders: aspirate medium from hPSCs, add 1 mg/ml collagenase IV to cells at 1 ml/well, and incubate cells at 37 °C for 1 hr.\nDuring this incubation, wash MEF feeders once with PBS, and then add warm (37 °C) serum-containing hPSC culture medium at 1.5 ml/well.\nAfter 1 hr, tap the culture plate a couple of times so that most of the undifferentiated colonies will detach from the plates, while the differentiated colonies remain attached. Carefully collect the floating colonies, and transfer them into 15 ml tube.",
    "Gently wash the plate once with warm (37 °C) DMEM/F12 and transfer DMEM/F12 into the same 15 ml tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 179 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate medium from the tubes, being careful not to disturb the pellet.

Preparation of Cells for Differentiation\nAt least one day before preparation of cells, prepare some Matrigel plates (typically 3 wells of a 6-well plate). Dilute the Matrigel with cold (4 °C) DMEM/F12 at 1:40 and add 1 ml Matrigel per well of 6-well plates. Incubate Matrigel plates at 4 °C overnight. NOTE: One can seal Matrigel plates with Parafilm and stock them at 4 °C for as long as one week.\nUse cells (see Step 2) 4 days after passage. Remove all the differentiated colonies from the plates. Aspirate medium from the culture plate, add 1 ml accutase per well, and incubate cells at 37 °C for 5 min.\nDuring the incubation, prepare some gelatin plates by adding 1 ml gelatin to 1 well of 6-well plates. Place these plates and the Matrigel-plates prepared one day before in incubator.\nAfter the 5-min incubation or when cells have become semi-floating, pipette cells up and down several times to make them into single cells.\nCollect single cells into 15 ml tubes, and centrifuge at 258 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend cells with appropriate amount of serum containing hPSC culture medium, and add Thiazovivin to the final concentration of 2 µM.",
