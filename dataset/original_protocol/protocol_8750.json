    "All experiments on animals were performed in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Seoul National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Seoul National University Hospital Biosafety Committee.\n1. Preparing Injection Kit and Viral Vectors\nPrepare the microliter syringe equipped with a 33 G blunt needle sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. Dilute the viral vectors in PBS for the adequate titer in the micro tube (i.e., 1 x 106 TU/µl). Flush the syringe several times with viral vectors to remove any dead space in the syringe.\n2. Subretinal Injection of Viral Vectors\nAnesthetize the adult mice (i.e., 6 - 8 weeks old) with an intraperitoneal injection of the mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (1:1, 2.25 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine hydrochloride (0.7 mg/kg body weight) or an alternative suitable anesthesia regime.\nDilate pupils with an eye drop of phenylephrine 0.5% and tropicamide 0.5%.\nPrepare the microliter syringe by loading with 1.5 - 2 µl of viral vectors.\nOpen the eyelid and protrude the eye to expose the equator for convenient injection and focus on under the operating microscope. Maintain the protruded eye position until finishing the injection, or displacement of the needle can occur during the injection. To hold the eyeball firmly, place the fingers outside the orbital rim.\nApply a drop of ophthalmic viscoelastic solution to the corneal surface.\nPlace a small round cover slide on the top of the cornea to visualize the retina.\nPuncture a small hole at slight posterior to the limbus using a sterile 30 G 1/2 needle for the further subretinal injection. Make the hole inferior for the right eye, and superior for the left eye for the convenience.",
    "NOTE: If the hole is made at temporal or nasal, it’s hard to be covered by the eyelid after the injection.  Initial puncture should be made slightly posterior to the limbus to avoid the limbal vessels which run along the limbus and can be easily recognized.  Be careful to avoid hitting the lens with needle while making the initial puncture. Do not insert the entire bevel of the needle to avoid lens puncture.\nPlace the 33 G blunt needle of microliter syringe through the pre-punctured hole and approach the needle into the subretinal space until the point when mild resistance is felt.\n\tNOTE: For the subretinal injection, the best approach angle of the needle is about 45 degrees against iris plane, and the blunt needle should be pushed posteriorly toward peripapillary area. Dotted square indicated the suggested needle pathway across the vitreous cavity for the subretinal injection in Figure 1.\n\tNOTE: There will be no resistance felt when piercing (or passing) the retinal layers as they are very soft. Thus, the first feeling of mild resistance indicates that the needle has already touched the RPE layer and the insertion of the needle should be stopped. Be careful not to penetrate scleral tissue with excessive pressure because the needle should be placed in the potential subretinal space. If the needle punctures the scleral tissue by excessive power, it enters into the extraocular orbital spaces without resistance. (This step is critical)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53030/53030fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic Diagram of the Subretinal Injection. H&E stained cross section of the mouse eye depicting the structures with a needle pathway for the subretinal injection marked (a dotted square).

    "Inject the viral vectors (i.e., 1 x 106 TU/µl) gently into the subretinal space without tremor to avoid unwanted tissue damage and withdraw the needle gently. Hold the eyeball firmly during the injection as described in 2.4.\nObserve the formation of subretinal bleb after the injection under operating microscope to make sure there is no retinal bleeding.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53030/53030fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Subretinal Belb Formation without Retinal Hemorrhage. Microscopic view of subretinal belb after the subretinal injection under operating microscope shows successful bleb formation without retinal hemorrhage.

Evaluation of the Efficacy of Gene Delivery in Retinal Pigment Epithelium\nSacrifice the mice in the CO2 chamber. Enucleate the eyes using scissors.\nFix the eyes in the 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4 °C for a minimum 1 hr to few days.\nGrab the cornea with fine forceps and puncture the cornea with micro-scissors. Remove the cornea after scissoring along the limbus. Remove the lens with forceps.\nTrim the ciliary body with micro-scissors allowing retinal detachment. Gently pull the whole retina from the RPE/choroid/sclera complex. Cut the RPE/choroid/scleral complex radially from the periphery to the center near optic nerve several times to make 4 to 8 leaves for flat mounting.\nFlip the RPE/choroid/scleral complex to make RPE side down, and trim all the remaining tissues at the scleral side including muscles, conjunctiva and optic nerve. This step is important to make a flat RPE/choroid/scleral complex because any remaining tissue makes the complex uneven.",
    "Incubate the complex with primary and secondary antibody for your specific research purposes (optional, see the references for detailed methods). Flat-mount the RPE/choroid/scleral complexes on the glass slide and absorb the PBS with an absorbent sponge.\nAdd 30 µl of mounting solution and place the cover slide. Observe the sample for the efficacy of vector delivery under fluorescein microscope. Keep the samples in the refrigerator for further observation.\nSubscription Required.
