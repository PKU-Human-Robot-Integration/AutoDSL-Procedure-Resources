    "1. Generation of stable CRISPR/Cas9-edited human lung cancer cell line (PC9) and human bronchial epithelial cell line (Beas2B) that endogenously express mNeonGreen21-10/11-tagged YAP protein\nPerform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the DNA sequence coding the 11th strand of the fluorescence protein, mNeonGreen2, using the high-fidelity DNA polymerase (see the Table of Materials).\nKnock-in the amplified DNA sequence into the YAP genomic locus of the PC9 and B2B cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system.\n\tNOTE: This DNA sequence complements strands 1-10 of mNeonGreen2 to emit fluorescence. The genomic sequence map of YAP-mNeonGreen21-10/11 is shown in Supplemental Figure S1. The map contains the labeled genomic, donor, and mNeonGreen2 sequences.\nCheck the CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mNeonGreen2 expression using an epifluorescence microscope (see the Table of Materials). Because the mNeonGreen2 is tagged to YAP whenever the cells express YAP in the context of its native gene regulatory network, check the presence of the fluorescence intensity in both CRISPR/Cas9-engineered cells and compare it to that in the parental cells (control).\n\tNOTE: To follow this protocol, use (1) a 488 nm laser (47.5 mW/mm2) for excitation, (2) a 40x objective (numerical aperture (NA) = 0.95) and a band-pass emission filter (ET525/50 nm) for fluorescence measurement, and (3) ImageJ software to measure, quantify, and compare the fluorescence intensities.\nConfirm the correct integration of mNeonGreen211 by extracting genomic DNA from the CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell lines; perform PCR using primers flanking the genomic insert and sequencing to confirm the insertion at the correct genomic loci19,20.\nKnock down the mNeonGreen211 using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system, and check the fluorescence intensity reduction in cells using the same microscope systems and imaging parameters described in step 1.3.",
    "NOTE: This step confirms the correct integration of mNeonGreen211 by the comparison of fluorescence intensities. The CRISPR/Cas9-engineered cells without knock-down and parental cells are used as control.\nCollect the cells with the tagged protein of interest through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorting.\n\t\nTo prepare cells for FACS sorting, trypsinize them and resuspend them in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCollect cells with mNeonGreen2 fluorescence above the background level of the parental cell lines in two enriching rounds of FACS sorting.\n\t\t​NOTE: The timeline to generate the CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell lines described here is on the order of 1-2 months. All cell lines are made publicly available upon request so other research laboratories can reproduce the results.\n2. Maintenance of PC9 and B2B cells\nMaintain both cell lines in humidified tissue-culture incubators with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nCulture 106 endogenously tagged PC9 and Beas2B cells in 75 cm2 flasks with 12 mL of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 µg/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Subculture both cell lines when the cell confluency reaches ~80%.\nTest both cell lines for mycoplasma every 3 months using a mycoplasma detection kit, following all manufacturer's recommended protocols strictly.\nStore the cell lines in a -80 °C freezer.\nUse the cell lines that are <20 passages from thaw for all the experiments.\n3.

Cell culture\nNOTE: Perform cell culture using aseptic technique.\nBond the glass coverslips with the PAA hydrogels to the 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dish to avoid physical drift of gels during the cell seeding and imaging processes.\n\t\nUsing sterilized clean tweezers, lift the coverslip (with the PAA hydrogel on top) from the Petri dish containing the prepared gels.\nUse a dry wipe to clean up water droplets on the bottom surface of the glass coverslip.\nUse the sterilized tweezers to hold the glass coverslip.",
    "Place small droplets (1-5 µL) of cyanoacrylate glue at the two diagonal corners on the bottom surface.\nUse sterilized wipes to remove excess glue.\nUse the sterilized tweezers to replace the coverslip in the glass-bottom Petri dish. Slightly press the corners of the coverslip to ensure that the glue droplets make full contact with the surface of the Petri dish.\nPlace the lid back onto the Petri dish to minimize the evaporation of PBS in the PAA hydrogels.

    "Check the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. Slowly tilt the tube horizontally and use the aspirating pipette to remove all the culture medium from the tube without touching the cell pellet. Next, add 8 mL of fresh culture medium and pipette up and down several times until all the cells are mixed homogeneously with the medium.\nDeposit 100 µL of the cell suspension (150 cells/µL) onto the gel surface and wait for 5 min. Next, slowly add 4 mL of fresh culture medium to the Petri dishes; avoid adding the fresh medium directly onto the gel.\nPlace the Petri dish in the 37 °C incubator. Wait to allow the cells to attach to the gel surface (B2B: 0.5-1 h; PC9: 4-5 h).\n6. Cell imaging\nNOTE: AMFIP enables automatic, multi-channel, and long-term imaging by coordinating with different hardware and software systems: (1) AMFIP manipulates µManager to automatically move the motorized stage of the Ti2-E microscope to multiple fields-of-view (FOVs) and acquire bright-field images through a monochrome camera (Table of Materials); and (2) AMFIP activates multiple macro files inside Elements with a customized Java script to accomplish automatic operations for confocal z-stack imaging and the switching of different laser channels (405 nm and 488 nm).\nSet the environment for long-term imaging.\n\t\nPlace the environment chamber onto the motorized stage of the inverted microscope. Set the CO2 flow rate to 160 mL/min and adjust the temperature of the chamber (top: 44 °C; bath: 42 °C; stage: 40 °C). Next, add 40 mL of purified water into the bath of the chamber.\nTake out the glass-bottom Petri dish with cells from the incubator and place it into the environment chamber.",
    "Turn on the confocal controller and the inverted microscope. Switch the light path to the right and observe the cells attaching using µManager. If sufficient cells have attached to the gel, transfer the Petri dish back to the incubator. If not enough cells have attached to the gel, continue the cell incubation for another 30 min for B2B and 60 min for PC9 cells.\nCut two small pieces of adhesive tape and stick them on the chamber around the circular hole. Next, apply a little adhesive glue onto the tape (only on the area that the Petri dish will cover).\nTake out the Petri dish from the incubator. Next, slowly place the Petri dish in the chamber and let the bottom of the dish make contact with the glue.\nPress the lid of the Petri dish for 1 min to allow the glue to make full contact with the Petri dish and solidify.
