    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPreparation for Histone-dendra2 Plasmids\nTiming: ∼3 days\nDigest the vector of Dendra2-H3.3-N-14 with Hind III and BamH I, set up the following reaction system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_277_18.csv\nIncubate the above mixture for 3 h at 37°C.\nRun an 1% agarose gel at 100 V for about 0.5 h.\nHarvest the backbone of Dendra2-H3.3-N-14 (4,667 bp band) with gel extraction kit.\nCombine the following reagents to generate each of histone coding sequences for mouse H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. Here is an example with mH3:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_277_19.csv\nHarvest the ∼456 bp PCR band using PCR extraction kit.\nDo the digestion for mH3 PCR product for 3 h at 37°C with the following reaction system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_277_20.csv\nHarvest the ∼444 bp PCR band using Gel or PCR extraction kit.\nDo the ligation with T4 ligase for 2 h at 20°C–25°C with the following reaction system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_277_21.csv\nMix well the reaction system, then use the following PCR reaction condition:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_277_22.csv\nSelect 5 μL of ligation product for DH5-alpha competent E. coli (NEB) transformation according to the high efficiency transformation protocol.\nThen pick up 3–5 single colonies from the plate with sterile inoculating loop and transfer to LB medium with 50 μg/mL of kanamycin. Incubate at 37°C for 12–16 h with continuous shaking.\nExtract the plasmids with QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit, then use Sac II to digest 1 μg of H3-dendra2 plasmid for 3 h at 37°C: the plasmids which can be digested into two bands (4,676 bp +405 bp) are positive, the negative one should be linearized.\nSend the positive colonies for Sanger sequencing with the primer CMV- Forward (CGCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTG).",
    "Critical: Dendra2 is a photoconvertible protein, which can switch from green to red fluorescence at the protein level. When the photoconversion occurs in mitotic phase, it will enable us to clearly distinguish old versus new histones and then trace their dynamics without concerning the transgene copy number issues.\nPreparation for Histone-dendra2-Expressing mESC Lines\nTiming: ∼1 week\nHistone-dendra2 mESC lines preparation: The transfection of E14TG2a mESCs was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nDilute 500 ng histone-dendra2 plasmids (for one well of 24 well plate) into 50 μL of Opti MEM and mix gently.\nMix Lipofectamine 2000 gently before use, then dilute 2 μL Lipofectamine 2000 into 50 μL of Opti MEM. Incubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nAfter incubation, combine the diluted DNA with diluted Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (total volume 100 μL). Mix gently and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 20 min.\nAdd 100 μL of the histone-dendra2 plasmid-lipid complex to one well of 24 well plate with WT E14 mESCs and incubate for 1–3 days at 37°C prior to checking the green dendra2 fluorescence.\nNote: We usually seed the cells at a ratio of 1:5 one day prior the transfection. The cells will form the medium-sized colonies, which normally have active proliferation capacities. This will be beneficial for the incorporation of transgenes.\nPassage the transfected mESCs for 2–3 times to remove the transient histone-dendra2 positive cells.\nPurify the dendra2 positive cells with manual selection or Flow Cytometry Cell Sorting (FACS, SONY SH800S) by gating the green fluorescence of Dendra2. Before photoconversion, the excitation for dendra2 is 490 nm.",
    "Critical: The density level of Dendra2 fluorescence will affect the photoconversion efficiency, so we purify and isolate mESCs with medium expression level of Histone-Dendra2 based on the fluorescence signal. The main purpose of this step is to remove those cells with super bright or very weak signal.\nCryopreservation for Histone-dendra2-Expressing mESC Lines\nTiming: ∼1 day\nPrepare the cryovials labeled with each histone-dendra2 mESC lines and passage numbers, date, etc.\nCollect the single cell suspension for each histone-dendra2 mESC lines and check the cell density and viability with hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the supernatant and gently loosen the pellet.\nPrepare the freezing medium with 10% DMSO + 90% FBS. Then add the freezing medium to the cells with gently rocking.\nTransfer the cryovials into a freezing container with isopropanol and put into −80°C for about 24 h.\nFinally transfer the cryovials from the freezing container to liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: Each histone-dendra2 mESC line must be labeled clearly. When culture different histone-dendra2 mESC lines at the same time, try to separate them into different plates in case of the cross contamination.\nPause Point: All the histone-dendra2 tagged mESC lines can be stored in liquid nitrogen for long term preservation.\nNote: The density should be at least 106 cells/mL. The viability should be higher than 80% for cryopreservation.\nInduce Histone 3-dendra2-Expressing mESCs Differentiation toward mEpiSCs\nTiming: ∼1–5 days\nFirst use 0.2% gelatin to coat the 24 well plates, then we usually seed 3,000–5,000 cells/well for the EpiSC differentiation assay.\nCulture the Histone 3-dendra2 mESCs in complete medium with LIF and 2i for one day, you should see low density of small colonies, each with about 3–5 cells.",
    "Then gently change the medium to N2B27 medium with Activin A and bFGF, try not to detach the cell colonies.\nCulture the Histone 3-dendra2 mESCs in N2B27 medium with Activin A and bFGF for 1 day and then fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at 20°C–25°C for subsequent ACD detection.\nCritical: Due to different mESCs lines, their abilities to secret Wnt proteins may be different (ten Berge et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). For example, E14 mESC line usually secrets more Wnt proteins than other mESC lines. Thus, different mESC lines may respond to exogenous Wnt proteins distinctively.\nIf you will perform alkaline phosphatase (AP) assay, continue to culture the Histone 3-dendra2 mESCs in N2B27 medium with Activin A and bFGF for 4 more days, change the medium every day.\nCritical: It is important to first seed the mESCs in complete medium with LIF/2i, which will help the cells attach on the plates. Normally when treating with N2B27 medium with Activin A and bFGF for about one day, the colonies with dome-shaped morphology start to become flatten.\nValidation of the mESCs Markers for Histone 3-dendra2-Expressing mESCs\nTiming: ∼3 days\nImmunofluorescence staining of mESCs was performed using standard procedures.\nCulture the mESCs in fluorodish for about 2 days and then fix them with 4% PFA at 20°C–25°C for 30 min .\nWash three times with 1× PBS, each for 5 min, then permeabilize with PBS+0.2% Triton X-100 at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nBlock the cells with blocking buffer at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nUse blocking buffer to dilute the primary antibodies and then incubate cells at 4°C for 12–16 h.",
    "Wash three times with PBS+0.2% Triton X-100, each for 5 min and use blocking buffer to dilute the secondary antibodies, then incubate cells in the dark at 20°C–25°C for 2 h.\nWash three times with PBS+0.2% Triton X-100, each for 5 min, then image using confocal microscopy.\nNote: For the immunostaining with nuclear markers, we use permeabilization buffer to treat the samples; while for some membrane markers, like SSEA1, we use 1× PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 instead of 0.2% Triton X-100 in our experiment.\nCell Cycle Analysis of Histone-dendra2 mESCs\nTiming: ∼5 days\nFor cell cycle analysis, we culture the Histone-dendra2 mESCs in Falcon® 35 mm TC-treated Easy-Grip Style Cell Culture dishes, use WT mESCs and WT mEpiSCs as controls.\nTo get a homogenous population of WT mEpiSC, we treat the WT mESCs with Activin A and bFGF on next day and then culture for 5 days.\nThen we use 0.05% Trypsin to digest each type of mESCs/mEpiSCs to single cell suspensions. Harvest the cells at the density of 105–107 cells/mL to 15 mL centrifuge tubes and wash in 1× PBS once and then fix them in 1 mL of cold 70% ethanol/tube at 4°C for 30 min.\nWash the cells in 1× PBS twice. Spin at 1,200 × g in the centrifuge and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 2 μL 20 mg/mL RNase A stock (100×) to 50 μL 1× PBS with cells/tube and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nThen add 50 μL propidium iodide-PI (1 mg/mL stock solution) to 450 μL RNase A/1× PBS/cell suspension, incubate for 10 min in the dark.\nMeasure the cell cycle of mESCs carrying different histone-dendra2 transgenes with BD FACS Verse machine, with WT mESCs and WT mEpiSCs as controls.",
    "The exported data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Dean and Jett, 1974[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Specifically, to launch the cell cycle platform, select the target samples with gated population, where you have gated out the dead cells and debris. Then choose \"cell cycle analysis\" from the \"Workspace\" menu. With the same setting and parameters, FlowJo can generate the parallel results for cell cycle data of different target samples.\nCritical: To acquire good FACS result, make sure the cells are in good condition. First try to reduce the dead cells and cell debris because their autofluorescence will interfere the cell sorting; Second try to digest to the single cells without clumping, then use 40 μm strainers to filter the cell suspensions because those cell clusters will clog the instrument.\nDetection of the Histone Transgenes Expression Level\nTiming: ∼1 days\nFor the histone transgene expression analysis, we culture the Histone-dendra2 mESCs in Falcon® 35 mm TC-treated Easy-Grip Style Cell Culture dishes, use WT mESCs as control.\nThe cells are lysed in RIPA Lysis and Extraction buffer with 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 1× Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail A.\nNote: Normally one 35 mm dish of cells need 1 mL RIPA buffer for complete lysis. We recommend to first pipette the RIPA buffer to detach the cells and then collect the suspension to 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Finally use vortex mixer for homogenization.\nThe total protein levels in mESCs with or without histone-dendra2 are quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit.\nUse 10 μg of protein for 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, run the gel with constant voltage (100 V) for approximately 1 h until the dye front runs to the bottom of the gel.\nFollowed by transferring the protein to Immun-Blot PVDF Membrane.",
    "After blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin in 1× TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST), the membranes are incubated with Rabbit polyclonal anti-Histone H3, Rabbit polyclonal anti-Histone H4, Rabbit monoclonal anti-Histone H2A, Mouse monoclonal anti-Histone H2B, Rabbit monoclonal anti-Histone H3.3 and Rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody in 4°C for 12–16 h. The agitation is recommended in this step.\nThe secondary antibodies are Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) HRP and Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) HRP with dilution ratio of 1:3,000.\nThe blots are processed with Immobilon Western chemiluminescence kit.\nThe images are visualized using the Image Quant LAS 4000 Gel Imager.\nAP Expression Detection of WT mESCs and WT mEpiSCs\nTiming: ∼1 h\nAP expression detection, we culture the WT mESCs and WT mEpiSCs in Falcon® 35 mm TC-treated Easy-Grip Style Cell Culture dishes.\nMaintain the mESCs in complete medium with LIF and 2i or mEpiSCs in N2B27 medium with bFGF and Activin A for 5 days prior to analyzing AP activity.\nThen fix the cells with 4% PFA in 1× PBS for 1–2 min.\nAspirate the fixative and rinse with 1× Rinse buffer twice.\nPrepare the AP staining solution by mixing Fast Red Violet with Naphthol AS-BI phosphate solution and water in a 2:1:1 ratio.\nIncubate the cells in dark at 20°C–25°C for 30 min. Aspirate the staining solution and rinse with 1× Rinse buffer twice.\nCover the cells with 1× PBS and then image the colonies with AP activity using brightfield microscopy.\nInduce Asymmetric Division of Histone-dendra2-Expressing mESCs with Wnt3a-Coated Beads\nTiming: 4–6 days\nThis step introduces the methods for inducing ACD of histone-dendra2-expressing mESCs with Wnt3a beads. Because the activity of Wnt3a beads are critical for the ACD induction efficiency, here we will emphasize the assessment of biological activity of Wnt3a beads with LS/L cells.",
    "Preparation of active and inactive Wnt3a coated beads.\nMouse Wnt3a proteins were produced in Drosophila S2 cells and purified as described in Willert et al. (2003)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10].\nActive Wnt3a-coated beads were prepared as described in Lowndes et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]. Step 1 - beads activation: Activate the carboxylic acid groups of magnetic beads with 50 mg/mL carbodiimide and N-hydroxyl succinimide in 25 mM cold MES buffer. After activation, wash the beads for three times with 25 mM MES buffer (pH 5). Step 2 - Wnt3a protein immobilization: Reconstitute the Wnt3a protein at 40 μg/mL in sterile PBS. Then dilute the 5 μL protein solution with 20 μL 25 mM cold MES buffer (pH 5), incubate at 20°C–25°C with gentle rocking for 1 h. Step 3 - The active Wnt3a beads were washed three times with MES pH 5 and additional three times with PBS, then store in PBS/ 1% BSA buffer at 4°C.\nCritical: For each wash, gently rocking the beads for completely washing away the unconjugated Wnt3a protein. Because of the gravity of magnetic beads, we recommend to flick the incubation tube every 5 min to better mix the beads and Wnt3a protein solution.\nPreparation of inactive Wnt3a coated bead requires active Wnt3a beads which were incubated in Dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37°C for 30 min. DTT treatment denatures the Wnt protein and loses its activity. Finally store the inactive Wnt3a coated beads in PBS/1% BSA buffer at 4°C.\nAssessment of biological activity of Wnt3a coated beads with LS/L assay.",
    "As described in Lowndes et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], luciferase reporter cells (LS/L cells) was used for testing the biological activity of Wnt3a coated beads. LS/L cells were cultured in LS/L medium. Specifically, per testing condition, 5 × 104 LS/L cells (in 100 μL of LS/L medium) were seeded in triplicate, in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Incubate LS/L cells for 4–6 h. When cells have properly attached, add soluble Wnt3a protein or controls (“Vehicle buffer” refers to the buffer used to elute and store Wnt3a protein after its purification from Drosophila S2 cells; or LS/L medium refers to LS/L “Cells only”) or Wnt3a coated beads (active or inactive) into the corresponding wells. For beads condition in triplicate, dilute 6 μg of beads in 300 μL of LS/L medium and distribute 100 μL of bead mix in each well of the triplicate.\nTo ensure single-bead suspension, pipet (≥50 times) before adding 100 μL of bead mix or control mix directly to the corresponding wells (final amounts/concentration: beads, 2 μg/well; soluble Wnt3a protein, 50 ng/mL). Incubate LS/L cells with samples or controls at 37°C with 5% CO2. After 12–18 h, capture representative images of the wells to assess the level of well coverage and bead distribution (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/277-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Phase-Contrast Image of LS/L Cells Incubated after 16 h with Active Wnt3a-Coated Beads (Dark Spot)\nObjective 10×, 0.25 numerical aperture (NA). Scale bar, 100 μm.",
    "Luciferase activity was measured as described in Lowndes et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], with Dual-Light Luciferase & β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay System Kit (contains Buffer A, Buffer B, and Accelerator-II) and a luminometer. To normalize the results, divide the first luciferase intensity by the β-galactosidase product intensity. To produce the fold change, the average of the triplicate normalized values can be divided by the average of the triplicate control condition (i.e., negative control, in our case “Cells only” containing only LS/L cells and LS/L medium) (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/277-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Normalized Results from the LS/L Assay Showing the Fold Change of the Biological Activity of Soluble Wnt3a Protein and Wnt3a Coated Beads (Active or Inactive)\n6 μg of beads (active or inactive) were distributed in each well of the triplicate. 6 μL of soluble Wnt3a protein were distributed in the corresponding triplicate (final concentration of soluble Wnt3a protein = 50 ng/mL). 6 μL of LS/L medium or Vehicle buffer were distributed in each triplicate (negative controls: “Cells only” and “Vehicle buffer”).\nWe provide a flow chart for medium switching and inducing asymmetric division of mESCs with Wnt3a-coatd beads, as well as two representative figures showing the validation of ACD in mESCs (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Please check the detailed information in Habib et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] and Lowndes et al.

Magenta, APC immunostaining signal. Green, H3-dendra2 and α-Tubulin. Yellow dotted circle, Wnt3a-coated beads. Scale bar, 5 μm. Note: APC is a component of the β-catenin destruction complex, and can be detected in proximity to the Wnt3a beads during the asymmetric dividing mESCs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/277-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Yellow dotted circle, Wnt3a-coated beads. Scale bar, 5 μm. Note: Claudin 6 is a marker for the cell fate of mEpiSCs, and can be detected in distal side of the Wnt3a beads during the asymmetric dividing mESCs.\nSynchronization and Photoconversion of Histone-dendra2-Expressing mESCs with Wnt3a-Coated Beads\nTiming: ∼16.5 h\nThis step introduces the synchronization of mESCs using microtubule depolymerizing drug-Nocodazole (NZ), which is a critical step to use photoconversion to distinguish old (red fluorescent) versus new (green fluorescent) histones during cell cycle, as newly synthesized histones are mainly incorporated during S phase. Therefore, using the two color to label old versus new histones is only interpretable when we know the precise timing of photoconversion in the context of cell cycle.\nMix the cells with Wnt3a-coated beads in a ratio with about 2000 cells per 1.5 μg Wnt3a beads and then seed the mixture to fibronectin-coated fluorodishes.\nCritical: It is important to validate the activity of Wnt3a beads, as described in step 33, before use. Lower biological activity of Wnt3a coated beads can significantly reduce the percentage of ACD.",
    "Use 50 ng/mL of NZ to treat mESCs with Wnt3a beads for 16 h, until you see lots of mitotic cells with round morphology.\nNote: Synchronization can disrupt the polarization pattern of components of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cells contacting Wnt3a bead and they may seem to be diffused. Moreover, avoid overtreating the cells with NZ because you need to release them to proceed until next cell cycle. Moreover, the mitotic cells can easily detach due to the NZ overtreatment. Here we recommend using lower concentration and longer time for NZ treatment. It may need to optimize this condition with different cell types prior to your formal experiments.\nWnt3a-induced mESCs expressing Histone-dendra2 are then photoconverted with pulses of 405 nm blue light. This step is empirical, which depends on Dendra2 protein expression level and set up of equipment, here is just an example as a starting point.\nSelect the 20× objective of LSM 780 microscope for photoconversion.\nThen draw the region of interest using the tools in “Regions,” and select mitotic cells positive with green Histone-dendra2 signals as targets.\nUse the 405 nm laser at 6%–10% power for 30-s pulses for 100–200 iterations to photoconvert Dendra2 protein from green fluorescence to red fluorescence.\nNote: This photoconversion setting is performed on individual mESCs expressing medium level of histone-dendra2. For your own sample, it is necessary to optimize these settings to acquire a high photoconverting efficiency. The photoconversion efficiency can be calculated by quantifying the total intensity of green dendra2 before photoconversion (DBP) and the total intensity of green dendra2 right after photoconversion (DRAP) using the following equation: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/277-Si1.jpg\nRelease the cell cycle synchronization by gently washing off NZ with prewarmed 1× PBS buffer for three times, and then change with the fresh N2B27+ LIF culture medium.",
    "Critical: Try to gently aspirate and add 1× PBS buffer or culture medium during the washing to avoid misplacement of Wnt3a beads.\nTracking the Old versus New Histone Distribution in Histone-dendra2-Expressing mESCs\nTiming: ∼14–16 h\nPrepare each histone-dendra2 mESCs line, perform steps 34–38, then release the cells to allow them to progress into the second M phase (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/277-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. The Regime for Tracking the Distribution of Old versus New Histone in Asymmetric Dividing mESCs\nThe photoconversion of histone-Dendra2 is performed in the first mitotic phase. Then, new histone will be incorporated in next S phase. The old versus new histone distribution patten can be detected on the second mitotic phase.\nNote: Some cells may be sensitive to NZ treatment and still arrest after washing off NZ. Those cells can be distinguished as they will carry most photoconverted red fluorescent dendra2 but no or very low green fluorescent dendra2, which will not be included in imaging and data analyses.\nAfter 14–16 h, fix cells with 4% PFA at 20°C–25°C for 30 min and then image the mitotic cells carrying comparable red and green histone-dendra2 signals with confocal microscopy with 40× or 63× oil immersion objectives, 1.4 NA.\nCritical: To better perform colocalization analysis, we recommend to capture images for the entire nucleus with Z stack interval of 0.5 μm."
