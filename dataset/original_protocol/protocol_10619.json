    "All procedures performed on animals were in strict accordance with the Swiss Animal Protection Act, the ordinance on animal protection and the ordinance on animal experimentation. We confirm that our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), named Commission de Surveillance de l'Etat de Vaud (Permit Number: 2687), specifically approved this study.\n1. Tumor Inoculation of the Ear\nCulture B16-F10-GFP melanoma cells in a 10 cm Petri dish using DMEM + 10% FBS media.\nWhen the cells are 80-90% confluent, wash them with PBS and detach them by trypsinization. Spin down cells at 1,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml Ringer's solution and transfer it into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Spin again and remove all supernatant except a thin layer of medium that stays just above the pellet. Resuspend the cells to end up with a thick cell slurry.\nAnesthetize the mouse with a mixture of ketamine/dorbene [medetomidine] (75mg/kg-1mg/kg) and confirm that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized by performing a gentle toe pinch. Increase the isoflurane concentration in steps of 0.1 % in case movements are observed (e.g. withdrawal of the paw). Keep mouse on a rectal thermistor controlled heating pad (37 °C) during the whole procedure and protect its eyes with an appropriate ophthalmic ointment.\nPrepare a Hamilton syringe (33 G needle, 10 ml syringe volume). Remove the tip cap with the needle and load 20 µl of cell slurry on top of the tip chamber. Pull back the plunger until 5 ml slurry is loaded inside the syringe. Remove the excess slurry from the tip chamber and close the tip cap.",
    "Using adhesive tape, fix the proximal edge of the ear on the tip of an index finger. In a 45° angle, slowly insert the Hamilton syringe needle between dorsal dermis and the cartilage. Once inside, penetrate the ear proximal to distal for about 2-3 mm.\n\tNote: The procedure of cell injection should be done by trained and certified technician. In addition this process must be perform slowly and in sequence: first the needle should be placed horizontally to the ear skin and inserted slowly into the ear dermis. Once and only then the needle end is in the skin, the plunger should be pressed. Pressing of the plunger will initiate cells inoculation in the skin. In the unlikely event of the needle passing the two layers of the ear dermis, the layer of the cartilage and enters the skin of the person performing the experiment, the pain inflicted to the experimentator finger should be considered as an alarming sign and cause immediate retraction of the needle from the experimentator skin. In that case plunger should not be pressed and skin should be sterilized with alcohol. Alternatively, inanimate object instead of a finger can be used to stabilize the ear.\nInject 3 µl cell slurry and slowly retract the needle from the ear. Let tumor cells form a solid tumor during 7-9 days and follow the tumor growth by using a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\nAlternatively, to follow the early steps of tumor cell interaction with tissue matrix, apply 50 μl of 100,000 tumor cells suspended in Ringer's solution on the exposed and stained ear dermis (after step 3.3).\n2. Ear Surgery\nThree days before the experiment, shave the mouse head, depilate the hairs around the head and ear (10-15 sec) and rinse with water.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with a mixture of humidified oxygen and isoflurane (3-4% induction, 1-2% maintenance) and confirm that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized by performing a gentle toe pinch. Increase the isoflurane concentration in steps of 0.1% in case movements are observed (e.g. withdrawal of the paw). Keep mouse on a rectal thermistor controlled heating pad (37 °C) during the whole procedure and protect its eyes with an appropriate ophthalmic ointment.\nBuild a platform made out of 8 glued glass histology slides. Turn the mouse on its back and gently place the tumor-bearing ear on the stack of glass slides. Use small stripes of adhesive tape to fixate the anterior and posterior edges of the ear to the stack.\nCut the ventral skin of the ear along the antihelix of the mouse pinna using a scalpel. With the help of curved tweezers, gently peel off the ventral dermis and the cartilage from the dorsal dermis where the tumor was inoculated. Pull off the ventral skin and cartilage with curved forceps, exposing the dorsal dermis. NOTE: If the major vessels of the ear are cut or the blood circulation does not return to normal flow within 15 min, the ear cannot be used for imaging. Always keep the opened ear skin wet by using Ringer's buffer and protect the humidity by using a coverslip.\nIn case there is persistent bleeding form tumor vessels, stop the bleeding by adding 100 µl thrombin (5 U/ml) in Ringer's buffer (102 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 28 mM sodium lactate) on top of the ear for 5 min.\nWash the ear twice with approximately 5 ml of Ringer's buffer and remove extra liquid with sterile wipes. Immediately proceed to the next step (do not let the open ear dry at any point!).",
    "3. Immunofluorescence Staining\nUse Ringer's buffer supplemented with human serum (1:10), mouse polyclonal secondary antibody to human IgG (1:50), and 125 IU/ml (2.5 mg/ml) aprotinin (blocking buffer) for all staining steps. Aprotinin inhibits plasmin promoting coagulation to limit initial bleeding that may occur after surgery.\nFold the part of the ear with the open dermis into the eminentia conchae and dry the outer unopened ear dermis with sterile wipes. Immobilize the ear on the stack of glass slide by applying 0.5 μl of surgical glue to the anterior and posterior dorsal edges. Then, gently flatten the dorsal ear dermis onto the glass.\nApply primary antibodies targeting extracellular matrix molecules at a concentration of 10 µg/ml in a total volume of 100 µl blocking buffer to the exposed ear. Cover the ear with a cover slip in order to prevent the staining solution to dry on the ear edges. Incubate for 15 min. Wash the ear twice with approximately 5 ml of Ringer's buffer.\nApply appropriate secondary antibodies or streptavidin conjugates (fluorophores with a high excitation wavelength such as 594 nm or 647 nm are favorable for intravital imaging) at a concentration of 10 µg/ml in a total volume of 100 µl blocking buffer to the exposed ear. Cover the ear with a cover slip and incubate for 15 min. Wash the ear twice with approximately 5 ml of Ringer's buffer.\n4. Interaction of Blood-borne Activated Splenocytes with Tumor Cells in situ\n7 days after inoculation of GFP-B16-F10 melanoma on the back skin of congenic mouse, euthanize the animal and collect spleens. Isolate splenocytes with mechanical disruption of the spleen through a 70 μm cell strainer.",
    "Label splenocytes for 8 min at 37 °C with Red CMTPX cell cytoplasm stain (1 μM in PBS), wash 4 times in 15 ml at 4 °C and immediately inject with 200 μl serum free medium into the tail vein of mouse whose ears were inoculated with B16-F10- GFP 7 days earlier.\n5. Intravital Imaging by Using a Stereomicroscope\nFor short-term imaging (up to 2 hr), add freshly prepared sterile ascorbate-Ringer's buffer containing 140 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM KCl and 5 mM CaCl2, at a pH of 7.5 (ascorbate-Ringer's buffer final osmolarity 320 mOsM) on top of the immobilized ear. Cover the ear with a coverslip and start imaging by using a fluorescence stereomicroscope with 2X lens.\nFor long-term imaging (more than 2 hr), place the outlet of a needle (connected to a reservoir containing ascorbate-Ringer's buffer) under the coverslip, about 0.5 cm away from the ear. Use a peristaltic pump at a speed of 1 µl/min to constantly deliver ascorbate-Ringer's buffer to the chamber under the coverslip.\nChange the 1X lens (working distance 6 cm) to 2X lens (working distance 2 cm). Open the acquisition software and configure the settings of the fluorescent stereomicroscope. In camera settings choose 12 bit as the image color depth and adjust the camera range of grey-scale values from 0% (minimum) to 5.1% (maximum) and set gamma correction to 2.\n\t\nSet acquisition gain to 1 (minimum), fluorescence intensity to 1,000 (maximum), magnification set to 280X-320X and adjust the exposure time avoiding over- or under- exposure (exposure time should be less than 1 sec). Depending on the number of imaging fields (usually 10 to 20), time interval for acquisition cycle should be set between 1 to 2 min. Shorten times may cause the bleaching and phototoxicity.",
    "Choose several fields that contain tumor cells as well as stained ECM proteins (such as in Figure 3). Using the motorized stage, acquire images of the appropriate fluorescent channels (such as GFP and fluorophore 647 in Figure 3) over time (e.g. every 2 min).\nAfter the experiment, euthanize the mouse according to institutional animal guidelines. In this case, at the end of the experiment, euthanize the anesthetized mouse by cervical dislocation followed by exsanguination (intracardiac perfusion).\n6. Intravital Imaging by Using a Multiphoton Microscope\nUsing silicon grease, build a circular wall of about 2 cm diameter and 2-3 mm height around the ear, starting at the base of the ear. Make sure there are no leaking points. Fill the circle with ascorbate-Ringer's buffer.\nPlace mouse on the stage and connect the heating pad (37 °C).\nOpen acquisition software and configure the settings of the multiphoton microscope.\nChoose up to four different fields that contain tumor cells and stained ECM proteins (such as in Figure 3). In this example, tune the Ti-Saphire laser to 850 nm for GFP signal a subsequent single photon 647 for fluorophore 647 staining and visualize fibrillar collagens with SHG. Acquire images of the appropriate fluorescent channels (such as GFP and fluorophore 647 in Figure 3) and second harmonic generation over time, e.g. every 2 min, with water immersion HCX APO 20X with 1.00 NA lens and 2 mm working distance.\nAfter the experiment, euthanize anesthetized mouse with cervical dislocation followed by exsanguination (intracardiac perfusion)."
