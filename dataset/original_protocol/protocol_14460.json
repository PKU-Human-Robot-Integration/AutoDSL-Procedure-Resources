    "The protocol follows the institutional guidelines of the human research ethics committee.\n1. Pre-selection of the Patient\nUsing the preoperative echocardiography, identify patients with an estimated aortic annulus diameter of less than 20 mm. Be aware that in heavily calcified aortic valves and annuli, the preoperative echocardiography can sometimes be misleading.\nSelect from these patients a subgroup with a body surface area greater than 1.6 m2.\nVerify on the chart provided by the valve manufacturer that a stented pericardial aortic valve substitute labelled 19 mm has an effective orifice area of 1.28 cm2.\nMake sure that the implantation of a stented pericardial aortic valve substitute labelled 19 mm into the above-mentioned subgroup of patients would result in an EOAI of less than 0.85 cm2/m2 (1.28 cm2 divided by 1.6 m2 = 0.8 cm2/m2).\nInform the staff of the possibility of a full-root stentless aortic xenograft implantation.\nMake the final decision intraoperatively after the aortic valve is removed. Check that the coronary ostia are not heavily calcified and that a 19 mm valve sizer for the stented pericardial aortic valve substitute passes too-tightly through the debrided aortic annulus.\n2. Preparation for Surgery\nNote: Preparation for surgery follows institutional guidelines and recommendations for adult cardiac surgery patients.\nClean and prepare the surgical suite in a typical manner. In order to facilitate the communication between the surgeon and the perfusionist, place the heart lung machine to the left of the patient, opposite to the surgeon.\nPre-medicate the patient by the oral administration of 5 mg of midazolam, 30-60 min prior to the induction of anesthesia.\nMonitor the patient according to standard guidelines with direct arterial and central venous pressure access by the anesthesiologists. Induce anesthesia using an initial intravenous injection of 0.5-1.5 mg/kg propofol, 1-2 µg/kg fentanyl, and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium.",
    "Perform a tracheal intubation and then maintain the anesthesia by the intravenous infusion of propofol 100-150 µg/kg/min, fentanyl 0.015 - 0.03 µg/kg/min, and rocuronium 0.6 - 1.2 µg/kg/min, as needed.\nInstall the patient in a supine position and drape her/him in a sterile fashion, leaving the chest, the abdomen, and the groin free in the operative field.\n3. Surgery\nAccess the heart through a median sternotomy.\nIncise the skin longitudinally over 15 cm with an 18 blade knife, starting 1 cm below the suprasternal notch. Take care to stay in the middle of the sternal width.\nSaw the sternum with an oscillatory saw. Take care to stay in the middle of the sternal width.\nGrab the pericardium with Carpentier dissection forceps and cut it with Metzenbaum scissors. Continue cutting the pericardium up to its reflection line over the ascending aorta using electrocautery.\nGive 300 I.U. of heparin/kg (concentration: 5,000 U/mL) through the IV line.\nCannulate the distal ascending aorta using commercially available arterial cannulas13.\nCannulate the right atrium using a commercially available atrial caval venous cannula13.\nStart the cardiopulmonary bypass. Cool down the patient to 32 °C.\nPlace a commercially available vent through the right upper pulmonary vein and the mitral valve in the left ventricle to unload the left heart13. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with polybutylene coating.\nInsert a commercially available retrograde cardioplegic cannula through the coronary sinus. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with polybutylene coating.\nInsert a commercially available antegrade cardioplegic cannula into the aortic root at the sino-tubular junction. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with polybutylene coating.\nClamp the distal ascending aorta below the arterial cannulation site.",
    "Deliver the antegrade cold blood cardioplegia through the antegrade cannula in the aortic root and repeat it retrogradely every 20 min. After the completion of the coronary ostial anastomoses, repeat the antegrade cold blood cardioplegia directly into the coronary ostia using a commercially available coronary artery cardioplegic cannula.\nPrepare the aortic root for implantation.\nRemove the antegrade cardioplegic cannula. Grab the ascending aorta with Carpentier dissection forceps on each side of the opening left following removal of the cardioplegic cannula.\nEnlarge the opening with an 18-blade knife. Finish the transection of the aorta with Metzenbaum scissors. Verify the presence of the right coronary ostium and the left coronary ostium.\nGrab the top of the left sinus of Valsalva with Carpentier dissection forceps and dissect free the left coronary ostium and the proximal main left coronary artery of the patient from the aortic wall, with a surrounding patch of 5 mm, using Metzenbaum scissors. Put a 5/0 polypropylene stay suture through the top of the patch around the left coronary ostium.\nGrab the top of the right sinus of Valsalva with Carpentier dissection forceps and dissect free the right coronary ostium and the proximal right coronary artery of the patient from the aortic wall, with a surrounding patch of 5 mm, using Metzenbaum scissors. Put a 5/0 polypropylene stay suture through the top of the patch around the right coronary ostium.\nConfirm the pathological changes of the aortic valve leaflets.\nGrab the right coronary leaflet with Carpentier dissection forceps and excise it with Metzenbaum scissors. Grab the non-coronary leaflet with Carpentier dissection forceps and excise it with Metzenbaum scissors.",
    "Grab the left coronary leaflet with Carpentier dissection forceps and excise it with Metzenbaum scissors. Grab the non-coronary Valsalva sinus wall with Carpentier dissection forceps and make a perpendicular incision from the top to the base of the sinus. Stay 1 cm away from the aortic annulus.\nCalibrate the aortic annulus with a commercially available valve sizer. Make sure that the 19-mm sizer for the stented pericardial valves passes too-tightly through the aortic annulus and that the 23-mm sizer for stentless aortic xenografts fits well on the top of the aortic annulus.\nUnpack the valve as soon as its size is determined.\nStart rinsing the valve by placing it in a minimum of 750 mL of sterile, physiological saline solution. Ensure that the saline solution completely covers the valve. Gently swirl the valve back and forth for a minimum of 1 min. Discard the rinse solution. Repeat this process at least two additional times, using new saline solution, for a total of three rinses, 1 min each.\nCreate the left coronary neo-ostium in the stentless aortic xenograft by extending the native left coronary ostium or the ligated left coronary artery of the stentless aortic xenograft towards the commissure between the left and non-coronary sinuses. Adapt the size of this neo-ostium to the size of the patient's left coronary ostium with its surrounding patch.\nLet an assistant hold the stentless aortic xenograft wall between the thumb and index finger so that the left neo-coronary ostium of the graft is oriented upwards.\nBegin the implantation of the stentless aortic xenograft with the proximal suture.\nPlace a 4/0 polypropylene stay suture above each aortic commissure. Pull up these traction sutures to better expose the aortic annulus of the patient.",
