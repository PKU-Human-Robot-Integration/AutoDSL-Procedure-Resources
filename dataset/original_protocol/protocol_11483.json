    "All animal use and procedures for this study were approved by the NIEHS Laboratory Animal\nCare and Use Committee and conducted in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of\nLaboratory Animal Care-accredited facility.\n1. Mammary Whole-mount Preparation2,3,6,7\nRemove the inguinal mammary glands from one side of a non-pregnant CD-1 female mouse, as described in reference3, and place them on an electrostatically charged slide.\nCover the gland with non-stick paper or film and place another slide on top. Add pressure (i.e., water weights) to the slide to spread the gland out flat so that the gland will stick to the slide for fixation.\nSubmerge the slides in fixative (e.g., 100% ethanol, chloroform, and glacial acetic acid in a 6:3:1 ratio) overnight at room temperature.\nRemove the glands from the fixative and wash in ethanol for 15-30 min. Following the 30-min wash, gradually change to water by pouring out 1/3 of the ethanol and adding water. Let the wash sit for about 5 min each time, and repeat with the addition of water 3 times.\nStain (e.g., carmine alum solution) for 12-24 h.\n\tNOTE: Thicker tissues will require longer staining times. See reference3 for staining details.\nPour off the stain after the allotted time and rinse the slides in water for 30 s. Dehydrate the tissues by washing the slides in 70% ethanol for 15 min, followed by performing a 15 min wash in 95% ethanol and a final wash in 100% ethanol for 20 min.\nClear the fat from the tissues by placing them in xylene for a minimum of 24 h, or longer if the tissue is thick, so that any opaque or white areas are removed.",
    "Remove the tissue from the xylene and quickly add mounting medium to the slide to avoid tissue dehydration; place a coverslip on top. Allow the slide to dry for at least 48 h.\nEvaluate the whole-mounted tissue for abnormalities, as described in2.\n\tNOTE: When lesions are detected in whole mounts and sectioning is necessary to establish their identity, the following steps should be followed.\n2. Removal of the Mammary Whole Mount from a Glass Slide\nRemove the coverslip and mounting medium by submerging the mammary whole-mount slide in a glass staining jar filled with xylene overnight.\n\tNOTE: Thicker tissues and slides with excessive mounting solution may require additional time for coverslip removal.\nFollowing the initial overnight soak, place the slides in fresh xylene and soak for 6 h. Perform one final soak in fresh xylene overnight.\n\tNOTE: The coverslip will easily fall off the slide after the last soak.\nWith a gloved hand, hold the slide and carefully remove the coverslip with a pair of forceps to ensure that it is removed in one piece. \n\tNOTE: In the event that the coverslip is still attached to the glass slide, continue soaking until it can be removed with little effort.\nOnce the coverslip is removed, hold the slide perpendicularly to a glass Petri dish containing xylene, carefully take a sharp, disposable razor blade and slide the blade in a single motion down the slide. \nOnce the tissue is removed, quickly submerge the mammary pad into a xylene-filled glass Petri dish to ensure that the tissue does not air dry.\n\tNOTE: Be careful with this step. The whole mount is thin (≤ 1 mm), and fragile from xylene processing. Any impressions or tears may change the morphology of the tissue and complicate later evaluations.\n3. Tissue Processing",
    "Once the tissue is in the Petri dish, carefully transfer it to a labeled histology cassette. Grab the edge of the fat pad with blunt-nosed, serrated-tipped forceps to minimize tissue damage.\n\t\nUsing a razor, cut larger tissues (especially for rats) in half and place them in two separate labeled cassettes that will accommodate the tissue size. Place the tissue right-side up (use the lymph node as a reference). Ensure that the tissue without the lymph node is kept in the same, upright position when it is transferred to the cassette.\nPlace the cassette into a container of xylene for up to 2 h before placing it in the tissue processor.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to process the samples on the same day they are placed into the cassette. Extended soaking in xylene has not been tested.\nLoad the maximum number of cassettes into the tissue processor by hand.\nPrior to beginning, program all the reagents that will be used for this process into the processor’s reagent list. To automate movement from one station to the next, use the menu options and create a new program. When all steps have been completed, select ‘OK’ to proceed. \n\tNOTE: The processor will allow the review of all station details before starting.\n\t\nAutomate the processor to soak the cassettes in xylene for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a second soak in fresh xylene under the same conditions. Automate the processor to remove the cassettes from the xylene solution and transfer the tissues to the next station containing a 1:1 xylene:molten paraffin mixture, set at 60 °C, for 30 min.",
    "NOTE: The processor will then transfer the cassettes into a new chamber that contains molten paraffin for 1 h. After 1 h, the samples will automatically be transferred to a new chamber of fresh molten paraffin and will be processed for an additional 2 h. Both steps are carried out at 60 °C.\nThe processor then transfers the cassettes to the station containing molten paraffin for 1 h. Then, the samples are automatically transferred to the final station of fresh molten paraffin and processed for an additional 2 h. Both steps are carried out at 60 °C.\n4. Embedding the Processed Mammary Tissue\nPlace the cassettes in the 58 °C paraffin holding tank of the embedding station until ready to embed the tissue in the mold.  \nRemove the cassette cover to determine the best mold size for the tissue. Make sure that the mold is big enough to accommodate the tissue, and leave enough room to have a tissue-free border of paraffin around the perimeter.\nAdd 3-4 mm of molten paraffin to the mold and orient the  mammary whole-mount surface, which was adjacent to the bottom of the glass slide and the bottom of cassette, facing up in the mold. \nTransfer the mold to a cooling plate and quickly adjust the tissue as needed so that it is parallel to the mold bottom.\n\tNOTE: Once the paraffin hardens, the tissue will besecured in place.\nUsing warm forceps, place the labeled, bottom half of the cassette on top of the mold; press firmly using the forceps.\nAdd additional molten paraffin to the mold in a continuous motion to cover the entire cassette. Move the mold from the warm plate to a cold plate to complete hardening of the block.",
    "Remove the block from the mold when the paraffin completely solidifies to avoid cracks or air bubbles.\n\tNOTE: Store the paraffin-embedded tissues at room temperature until ready to section.\n5. Sectioning the Paraffin-embedded Mammary Tissue on the Microtome\nPrior to sectioning, incubate the paraffin blocks at -20 °C for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: There will be residual mounting medium in the block from the original coverslipped whole-mount tissue. Chilling the block improves block sectioning and ribboning.\nPrepare the microtome by turning on the water bath, containing fresh distilled water, and adjust the temperature to 42-45 °C. Place a fresh, low-profile blade onto the microtome and set it at 4 µm. \n\tNOTE: Section quality is reduced with sections thicker than 4 µm because of the presence of residual mounting medium in the tissue.\nInsert the block into the microtome with the wax facing the blade and aligned with the vertical plane.  Then, moisten a section of gauze pad in cold water and place it onto the block for several minutes.\nSection the block by turning the large wheel in a clockwise motion, in combination with the coarse advanced wheel, until a full face or representative section of block is obtained.\n\tNOTE: The tissue is thin because of xylene clearing during the whole-mount process. Align block properly with the blade to minimize the number of cuts in obtaining a representative section.    \nPick the ribbon section up by hand, carefully float the ribbon in the warm (45 °C) water bath (prepared in advance), allow tissue wrinkles to dissipate and carefully float a section onto a clean glass slide.\nPlace the slides upright on a drying rack to remove excess water. Incubate the slides in a slightly opened slide box overnight at 37 °C.\n6. Automated and Manual H&E Staining of Sectioned Mammary Tissues",
    "Prior to staining, the slides are stored at room temperature. \nFor automated staining, select H & E from the stain options on the main menu.  Deparaffinization, staining, and dehydration are all completed on the automated stainer. Use mounting medium and a coverslip to mount the sections. \nIf manually staining the slides, deparaffinize the sections by immersing the slides in xylene for 5 min. Transfer to  fresh xylene and repeat for 5 min.\nRehydrate the slides by immersing them twice in 100% ethanol for 3 min each, followed by two repetitions in fresh 95% ethanol and two separate washes in 1X wash buffer at 5 min each.\nRinse the slides in distilled water. \nAdd the slides to the hematoxylin for 1-2 min. Remove the slides and rinse them with running tap water for 5 min. \n\tNOTE: Filter hematoxylin prior to each use.  \nPlace the slides in 1% glacial acetic acid for 30 s to promote color differentiation, and then rinse in running tap water for 1 min.\nAdd slides to 1X PBS for 30 s to 1 min to blue the tissue sections, followed by a 5 min rinse in tap water and then in 95% alcohol for 15 - 20 s.\nCounterstain with eosin solution for 30 s to 1 min. Following this, dehydrate the slides twice in fresh 95% ethanol, followed by two fresh repetitions in 100% ethanol. Perform each wash for 5 min.\nClear the slides in xylene, with two changes in xylene for 5 min each.\nCoverslip the tissue section with mounting medium and dry flat overnight at room temperature.\nSubscription Required.
