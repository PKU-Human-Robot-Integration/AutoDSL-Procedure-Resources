  "procedures": [
    "Perform two types of experiments, in two groups of mice: a baseline-escape experiment in which escapes are triggered in an arena with no obstacle present, and an obstacle removal experiment in which mice explore the arena with an obstacle present for 20 min, and then the obstacle is removed and escapes are triggered. We recommend performing these experiments in two separate groups of mice. If it is necessary to reuse mice, allow 3–7 days in-between experimental sessions.Set up and test the behavioral rig Place the acrylic arena with no hole on top of the stand and the arena with the rectangular hole on top of that. Obstacle removal experiment:  Place the panel with the obstacle in the hole. Baseline-escape experiment:  Place the flat panel in the hole.Test the auditory stimuli through the overhead speaker by placing the sound level meter on the perimeter of the arena, pointing towards the speaker. Ensure that it is playing at a volume of 84 dB.Test the video and automated stimulus presentation program, by moving a black, mouse-sized object into the threat zone and ensuring that an auditory stimulus is triggered.Ensure that the arena is lit just well enough for the mouse to easily see and target the obstacle (~5 cd m-2 ; see Equipment 12 and Notes).Clean the arena, shelter, and obstacle by wiping them with 70% ethanol, and then wait at least 5 min before beginning an experiment.Begin the behavioral session with a spontaneous exploration period Place the mouse in the arena in a consistent location across sessions, e.g. , in between the obstacle and shelter, and initiate the behavioral program. Mice were picked up by the base of the tail, with a hand positioned to support their body as they were placed onto the arena.",
    "Previous handling of mice was limited to routine animal husbandry.The mouse should spontaneously enter the shelter within the first 7 min, and henceforth treat it as its preferred location. If this does not consistently occur, see the Notes below for help.Obstacle removal experiment:  Allow the mouse to spontaneously explore the arena for 20 min total. Baseline-escape experiment:  Allow the mouse to spontaneously explore the arena for 7 min total.Throughout the session: if the mouse does not leave the shelter for 5 min or does not enter the threat zone for 10 min, scatter one pinch (1 g) of bedding from its home cage in the threat area, for a maximum of once per session.Obstacle removal experiment : Remove the obstacle from the arena  After 20 min, as soon as the mouse enters the shelter, quietly lift and remove the obstacle panel and replace it with the flat panel. If this is not done stealthily, it could frighten the mouse, causing it to stay in the shelter for most of the experiment. Details will depend on the layout of the experimental room, but typically, this should be done with 15 s. If the mouse starts to leave the shelter after the panel switch was already initiated, we recommend calmly completing the switch.Trigger auditory threat stimuli Use an automated software program (we use custom software in Bonsai) to track the mouse location online and trigger a threat stimulus in the following conditions: the mouse is currently in the threat zone, the mouse was in the threat zone 1.5 s prior, and the mouse has positive velocity in the direction opposite of the shelter.The threat stimulus consists of 1.5-s sounds, automatically played on repeat until the mouse gets within 20 cm of the shelter, or for a maximum of 9 s.",
    "A ‘crash’ sound and a ‘smash’ sound (Supplementary Audio 1-2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20220510/Supplementary%20Audios%201%202.rar]) are alternated every other trial, to prevent stimulus habituation.If the mouse does not successfully escape during the stimulus, increase the stimulus volume by 2 dB, up to a maximum of 88 dB.End the experiment after one hour or six successful escape trials, whichever comes first."
