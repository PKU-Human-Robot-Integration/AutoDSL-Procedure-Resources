    "All protocols involving animals are presented to and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Children's Hospital Boston and are conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Be sure to use sterile instrumentation and aseptic techniqure while performing the procedure. \n1. Preparation of Pellets\nWeigh out 10 mg of sucralfate and 60 mg of hydron with the sterile unbent spatula.  Place in separate microcentrifuge tubes.\nPlace a 1 cm square piece of mesh into a sterile 10 cm dish.  Invert so mesh rests on shallow lid.  Set aside.\nAdd 500 μl of ethanol to the hydron and vortex for at least 10 min.\nAdd the appropriate amount of growth factor (standard: 20 μg for bFGF, 50 μg for VEGF) to the sucralfate and vortex briefly.  Store growth factor in a -80 °C freezer at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.  Liquid volumes added should be a minimum of 20 μl to ensure the sucralfate is completely moistened but should not exceed 50 μl.  Greater volume makes the evaporation of the liquid in the next step difficult.\nPlace the sucralfate mixture into the centrifugal evaporator set on low until the mixture is completely dry, normally 30-50 min depending on the volume of liquid used.\n\t\nCheck the mixture for residual moisture with the tapered end of a sterile spatula.  The mixture should feel \"crunchy\".\nUse the tapered end of the spatula to break up the sucralfate mixture within the tube.\nAdd 10 μl of the hydron to the sucralfate.\n\t\nDue to the viscous nature of hydron, cut the end from a 200 μl pipet tip and then draw and release the 10 μl before pipetting up again and adding to sucralfate.",
    "Quickly use bent spatula to mix the hydron and sucralfate and remove from tube.\n\t\nGather the mixture along the bottom side of the tip of the bent spatula and then rotate the tube while drawing the spatula out along the wall of the tube.  The mixture will dry rapidly so this step must be done efficiently.\nSpread the mixture onto the prepared mesh using forceps to hold it in place.  The mixture should be an even layer and fill into the holes of the mesh.\nImmerse the bent spatula into the tube containing hydron and use it coat both sides of the mesh.\nPlace the coated mesh leaning on side against edge of dish and allow drying at RT for 30-45 min.\nPlace the mesh in -20 °C freezer or proceed immediately to next step.  Keep mesh inside dish.\nPlace the 35 mm dish inside of the larger petri dish, lid off.  Use the pair of forceps to carefully pull the fibers of the mesh apart over the 35 mm dish.  Stray pellets can be collected from the larger dish at the end.\n\t\nCheck pellets for uniformity under scope.  The process yields approximately 250 pellets thus the standard dose per pellet for bFGF and VEGF is 80 ng and 200 ng, respectively.\nStore pellets in 35 mm dish in -20 °C freezer for up to 3 months.\n2. Surgical Implantation of Pellets\nSet up a surgical area under operating microscope.\nAnesthetize the mouse with avertin (400-500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and position the mouse under microscope so eye is visible.  Perform toe pinch to ensure sufficient level of anesthesia.\nAnesthetize the mouse eye by placing 1 drop of proparacaine solution atop eyeball.  Wait 20-30 sec and dab with a gauze pad.",
    "Proptose the mouse eye with the dulled #1 jewelers forceps being certain to leave skin between forceps and eye.  It is important to judge the pressure applied correctly.  Holding the eye too firmly will cause it to become red and irritated, while too loose a hold will allow eye to move during surgery.\nUse the 30° microknife to make an incision into the cornea approximately 1 mm from the limbus.  The incision should be 1-2 mm in length.  Incision should be deep enough to penetrate beyond the epithelial layer into midstroma but not so deep to rupture the eye.\nUse the von Graef knife to make a pocket perpendicular to the incision. \n\t\nSlide the knife under the corneal layer at the incision site and gently work knife in and move it along the incision to enlarge the space, thus forming the pocket.  It helps to move the mouse as well to be able to work with the curvature of the eye.  Be careful not to push downward with the tip to avoid rupturing the eye.\nWet the #5 jeweler's forceps with proparacaine and pick a pellet up out of dish.  Place a pellet on the eye.\nMoisten the von Graef knife with proparacaine and transfer some of liquid onto pellet to make it rubbery and pliable.  Remove excess moisture with gauze pad or cotton swab.\nInsert the pellet into the pocket using the von Graef knife to push it inside beneath the cornea layer.  Once the whole pellet is inside, run the flat side of von Graef knife over site to check that the pellet is secure.\nCoat the eye with triple antibiotic ointment.\nTurn the mouse over and repeat surgery in the opposite eye.\n3. Quantification of Corneal Neovascularization.",
    "Leave animals to develop vessels over a set period of time.  The day of vessel grading depends on growth factor used. Grade bFGF on day 5 and the weaker VEGF on day 6.  The day of implantation is day 0.\nAnesthetize the mouse with avertin (400-500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal).\nUse the slit lamp microscope for grading.  One ocular has a reticule, lines within the eyepiece used as a measuring aid to quantify vessel length and distance around the eye's circumference that the vessels have sprouted.\n\t\nHold the mouse in front of scope, positioning mouse so eye is seen in ocular with pellet directly ahead.  Stabilize the head between thumb and forefinger so skin is tightened on face and eye is slightly proptosed.\nPlace the y-axis of the reticule along the limbal vessel directly beneath pellet.  Measure the length of vessels branching upward toward pellets.  Record this measurement in tenths of millimeters and designate vessel length (VL) (Figure 1A).\nTurn either the mouse or the reticule so that the distance around the eye that these vessels have sprouted becomes clear.  It is easiest to think of the eye as a clock face with intervals of 1 through 12.  Designate this number clock hour (CH) (Figure 1B).  It can be a whole number or fractions of 0.25 (e.g., 2, 2.25, 2.5 or 2.75). Note: CH is subjective.  For example, some may measure the distance around the eye to include all vessels sprouted from the limbus while others may stop measuring at the point where vessel length is half maximal.  The important factor is to be consistent with how one chooses to grade.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51375/51375fig1.jpg",
