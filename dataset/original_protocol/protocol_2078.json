This protocol is compatible with fresh or frozen tissues. If performing this dissociation protocol on frozen tissue, allow the tissue to thaw on ice for ∼5 min and quickly spin down samples (∼30 s) in Schneider’s medium using a mini-benchtop centrifuge prior to beginning.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1669-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow detailing the dissection and dissociation of Drosophila tissues for single-nucleus RNA-seq\nOptional: If using large tissues, such as intact heads, use a pestle motor and disposable plastic pestles to grind the samples for 60 s on ice. Make sure pestles are pre-cooled on ice before beginning.\nCritical: All steps must be performed on ice or at 4°C.\nDiscard Schneider’s medium without disrupting pellet.\nAdd 1000 μL of homogenization buffer and transfer sample to the 1 mL Dounce.\nRelease nuclei on ice by 20 strokes of the loose Dounce pestle and 40 strokes of the tight Dounce pestle. Avoid inducing bubbles.\nFilter 1000 μL sample through a 35 μm cell strainer into a 5 mL round bottom polystyrene FACS tube.\nFilter samples again using a 40 μm Flowmi cell strainer into a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4°C.\nNote: The slow centrifugation speed is necessary to avoid damaging the nuclei.\nDiscard supernatant and do not disturb the pellet.\nRe-suspend the nuclei using the desired amount of resuspension buffer. Pipet > 20 times to completely re-suspend the nuclei in 300–600 μL of resuspension buffer. Typically, we use 500 μL for resuspension.\nUse a 40 μm Flowmi cell strainer to filter the sample into a new 5 mL FACS tube. Keep the tube on ice.",
    "Note: In our experience, nuclei are much stickier than whole cells. For researchers making the single-nucleus suspension for the first time, we suggest confirming that the sample contains mostly single nuclei. To do this, take 10 μL of sample and stain it with Hoechst for more than 5 min, place it on a hemocytometer, and visualize it under a 20× objective on an epifluorescence microscope.\nFACS of nuclei\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this step, individual nuclei are collected into either one tube for 10× Genomics (steps 10–18) or 96 or 384-well plates for Smart-seq2 (steps 19–24). This protocol has been tested with the Sony SH800 sorter and the BD FACS Aria III using the 100 μm nozzle.\nNote: Prior to sorting and after nuclear extraction, add 20 μL of unstained nuclei to 200 μL of resuspension buffer as an unstained control for setting up FACS gates. Add Hoechst-33342 (at 1:1000) to the remaining nuclei and incubate for more than 5 min. When we sort wild-type tissues, we collect all Hoechst+ nuclei. When sorting GFP+ nuclei, first gate for Hoechst+ events and then gate the GFP+ population.\nNote: The following steps are for 10× genomics.\nSet up the sorter prior to nuclear extraction to avoid leaving the nuclei on ice for too long. This will take roughly 30 min. After setting up the sorter, pre-cool the collection chamber to 4°C.\nLoad the unstained nuclei to set up the negative gate.\nNote: Always run the unstained control first.\nPrepare the collection tube by adding 400 μL of resuspension buffer to a 1.5 mL nuclease-free tube, and vortex the tube to coat it.",
    "Load Hoechst-stained nuclei and the collection tube. The nucleus events and the debris events should be separated in the Hoechst channel. Sorting gate should be set tightly to the cluster of nuclei to exclude debris. The overall Hoechst signal for the debris will be slightly increased from the stained nuclei compared with the unstained sample (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1669-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative FACS plots of nuclei from adult fly heads\nLeft: plot of unstained nuclei. Right: plot of nuclei stained with Hoechst. The two populations of nuclei in the polygon are sorted for snRNA-seq.\nSort nuclei into the collection tube depending on the number of desired 10× runs. 100k nuclei are typically collected for one 10× run.\nAfter sorting, centrifuge the collection tube for 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4°C. We use a swinging-bucket rotor for this in a refrigerated centrifuge, such as an Eppendorf® Centrifuge 5430 R with Eppendorf® Swing-bucket rotor S-24-11-AT.\nCarefully discard the supernatant without touching the bottom of the tube. The pellet is often too small to be seen. Alternatively, the supernatant can be temporarily saved in a new nuclease-free tube on ice and discarded only after re-suspended nuclei are verified in the next step.\nResuspend the pellet with 45.2 μL resuspension buffer.\nTake 2 μL of nuclei and mix with 8 μL resuspension buffer.\nLoad 10 μL diluted nuclei into a hemocytometer and count the number, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, under a 20× objective of an epifluorescence microscope based on Hoechst signal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Calculate the concentration of nuclei.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1669-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example image of nuclei following FACS for 10× Genomics platform\nScale bar, 25 um.\nNow the nuclei are ready to be loaded to the 10× Chromium Controller.",
    "Critical: To generate the 10× GEM, the input volume of nuclei is 43.2 μL. It is important to resuspend the pellet in a small volume of resuspension buffer. For example, we usually use a total of 45.2 μL of resuspension buffer and take 2 μL for calculating the concentration of nuclei. The desired amount of (or all remaining) nuclei should be used for the subsequent steps, depending on the calculated concentration. If the concentration of nuclei is too dilute, re-centrifuge the sample. However, this may cause additional loss of nuclei.\nNote: The following steps are for Smart-seq.\nFollow steps 10 and 11 from the above 10× Genomics FACS section to prepare the sorter and set up the gate with unstained and stained nuclei.\nAdjust the plate position to ensure that the FACS collection solution drops in the center of each well.\nPlace a new aluminum seal on an empty plate and put the plate in the collection chamber.\nTest the accuracy of the sorter by dropping 25 events onto the 4 corner wells. Adjust the position of 4 corner wells one-by-one to ensure that the drop is in the center of each well.\nCritical: This step is very important for nucleus collection efficiency.\nPrepare collection plates, 96-well or 384-well.\nThaw a lysis plate for about 1 min at room temperature (∼20°C).\nQuickly spin the plate down using a mini-benchtop centrifuge for 30 s to ensure that the lysis buffer is in the bottom of each well. Thaw one plate at a time.\nLoad Hoechst stained nuclei and a fresh collection plate. Sort single nuclei into individual wells.",
    "After collection is finished, immediately seal the plate with an aluminum seal and spin the plate using a mini-benchtop centrifuge at room temperature (∼20°C) for 1 min, and immediately put the plate onto dry ice.\nThe plates now can be stored at –80°C for several months or can be immediately processed to make sequencing libraries.\nNote: Since polyploidy is common for many fly tissues, different nucleus populations may be observed during FACS according to the Hoechst signal, which reflects DNA content or nuclear size. For example, we observed 6 different populations with different Hoechst signal intensities for the fly testis and confirmed that the Hoechst signal intensities correlated well with nuclear size (Li et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). For the fly head, we observed 2 different populations with different Hoechst signals (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We recommend collecting nuclei of each size to ensure that all cell populations are adequately represented.\n10× Genomics: Library preparation and sequencing\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 are used. Polyadenylated mRNAs from each individual nucleus are labeled with an individual 10× barcode during cDNA synthesis, followed by cDNA amplification and 3′ Gene expression library construction. The Single Cell 3′ Gene Expression libraries comprise standard Illumina paired-end constructs which begin with P5 and end with P7. The library is compatible with multiple Illumina sequencers.\nCapture nuclei using the 10× Chromium Controller. When loading nuclei to the 10× controller, aim to recover 10k nuclei for each channel. The 10× Genomics User Guide suggests loading 16k nuclei in order to recover 10k. However, we observed that loading 1.5-fold more (24k nuclei total) than recommended allowed us to recover about 10k cells after sequencing. This is likely because fly nuclei are smaller than mammalian nuclei.",
    "Note: We load more nuclei than recommended because: (1) FACS can capture cell debris that are the same size as nuclei as ‘events’; (2) FACS cell counts can be overestimated; and (3) centrifugation following FACS can cause nuclei loss.\nMake sequencing libraries. Follow the 10× Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 User Guide to perform GEM Generation & Barcoding, post GEM-RT cleanup, cDNA amplification, and 3ʹ gene expression library construction. Representative cDNA and library traces are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1669-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative electropherograms showing the DNA distribution of cDNA and the sequencing library from 10× Genomics using the Agilent Bioanalyzer system\nSequencing. Single-cell sequencing libraries can be sequenced in most Illumina sequencing systems. We sequenced most of our libraries using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer with minimum sequencing depth of 50,000 reads/cell using the read lengths 28 bp Read1, 8 bp i7 Index, 91 bp Read2.\nSmart-seq2: First-strand synthesis, cDNA amplification, and library preparation\nTiming: 8–9 h\nThis portion of the protocol is modified specifically for fly nuclei from Picelli et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Li et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], and Jaeger et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10].\nPrimer Annealing ∼5 min. Anneal oligo-dT30VN primer to RNA.\nPlace frozen 96 or 384-well plate(s) into pre-warmed thermal cycler(s) to anneal primers using the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1669_12.csv\nMake reverse transcription (RT) master mix, on ice, while the plates are in the thermal cyclers for annealing, using the provided calculations.\nReverse Transcription (RT) ∼ 1.75 h. Perform RT reaction to obtain cDNA from single nuclei.\nRemove one plate at a time from the thermal cycler and immediately store it on ice.",
    "Using either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as MANTIS®), dispense 6 μL of RT master mix into each well of a 96-well plate or 0.75 μL of RT master mix into each well of a 384-well plate.\nCover plate with an adhesive PCR plate seal.\nBriefly vortex and then centrifuge each plate to ensure that all solution is in the bottom of the wells.\nPlace plate back into pre-warmed thermal cycler and run the RT reaction using the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1669_13.csv\nPause point: Following RT reaction, plates can be stored at –20°C for up to two weeks.\nOnce plates have < 30 min left of the RT reaction, begin making the cDNA amplification master mix, on ice, using the provided calculations.\ncDNA Amplification ∼ 3 h. Perform PCR to amplify the cDNA generated from the RT reaction.\nRemove plates from thermal cyclers and store them on ice.\nUsing either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as MANTIS®), dispense 15 μL of RT master mix into each well of a 96-well plate or 1.9 μL of RT master mix into each well of a 384-well plate.\nCover plate(s) with adhesive PCR plate seal(s).\nBriefly vortex and then centrifuge each plate to ensure that all solution is in the bottom of the wells.\nPlace plate(s) back into pre-warmed thermal cycler(s) and run the cDNA amplification reaction using the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1669_14.csv\nNote: This is largely the same protocol that we use with single-cells; however, for single-cells we repeat the cDNA amplification for 25 cycles instead of 28.\nPause point: Plates can be stored at –20°C for several months.\nDilution of cDNA 30 min. Dilute cDNA for downstream processing.",
    "By this step, the cDNA will be very concentrated and must be diluted using elution buffer. For 96-well plates, add 20 μL of elution buffer to each well. For 384-well plates, add 10 μL of elution buffer to each well.\nNote: cDNA concentration can be quantitated, using Quant-iT™ PicoGreen™ dsDNA Assay Kit or similar assay, and diluted to 0.32 ng/μL per well following the manufacturer’s instructions. However, for 384-well plates, we find that diluting each sample with the same amount of elution buffer works equivalently well. Further, custom dilutions for each well of 384-well plates are difficult to achieve if researchers do not have access to a liquid handling robot.\nIf using 96-well plates, merge cDNA from 4 different 96-well plates into a single 384-well plate. This step can be done manually using multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot.\nPause point: Plates can be stored at –20°C for several months.\nTagmentation 30 min. Fragment the cDNA for the library preparation.\nMake the cDNA tagmentation master mix on ice using the provided calculations.\nUsing either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as MANTIS®) distribute 1.2 μL of tagmentation master mix into each well of a new 384-well plate.\nUsing either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as Mosquito® LV) distribute 0.4 μL of diluted cDNA to the 384-well plate containing tagmentation mixture.\nCover plate(s) with adhesive PCR plate seal(s).\nBriefly vortex and then centrifuge each plate to ensure that all solution is in the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the plate(s) into pre-warmed thermal cycler(s) and run the following tagmentation reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1669_15.csv\nOnce the tagmentation reaction is complete, add 0.4 μL of 0.1% SDS into each well of the 384-well plate. This will prevent over-tagmentation by neutralizing the reaction.",
    "Briefly vortex and then centrifuge each plate to ensure that all solution is in the bottom of the wells.\nAddition of Indexes and Amplification of Libraries 1 h. Barcode and amplify the libraries.\nMake the indexing PCR master mix using the provided calculations.\nUsing either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as MANTIS®) distribute 1.2 μL of the indexing PCR master mix into each well of the 384-well plate containing the tagmented cDNA.\nUsing either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as Mosquito® LV) distribute 1 μL from each well of a barcoding plate into the corresponding wells of the 384-well plate containing the tagmented cDNA and indexing PCR master mix.\nCover the plate(s) with adhesive PCR plate seal(s).\nBriefly vortex and then centrifuge each plate to ensure that all solution is in the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the plate(s) into pre-warmed thermal cycler(s) and run the following indexing PCR reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1669_16.csv\nOnce the indexing reaction is complete, use either a multichannel pipet or automated liquid handling robot (such as Mosquito® LV) to pool 1 μL of each well from the entire plate into the first columns of an empty 384-well plate.\nManually pipet the contents of the pooled wells into 1.5 mL tubes.\nPause point: libraries can be stored at –20°C for several months.\nLibrary Purification (Bead Clean-Up) 1.5 h. Clean-up and size selection of final libraries.\nPrepare an 80% (vol/vol) ethanol solution in nuclease-free water.\nEquilibrate AMPure XP beads to room temperature (∼20°C) for 20 min. Vortex the beads to ensure that they are mixed with the buffer.\nAliquot 400 μL of each library into fresh 1.5 mL tubes and add AMPure XP beads at a 0.8:1 bead:cDNA ratio (320 μL) to each tube.",
    "Vortex briefly and incubate bead–cDNA mixture at room temperature (∼20°C) for 6 min.\nPut bead–cDNA mixture on compatible magnetic rack and wait until the solution completely clears (< 3 min).\nRemove and discard supernatant.\nWash beads in 600 μL of 80% ethanol.\nRemove and discard all residual 80% ethanol from tubes.\nRepeat steps g and h for a total of two washes.\nRemove tubes from magnetic rack and add 100 μL of elution buffer. Pipet the mixture to ensure it is thoroughly mixed.\nIncubate at room temperature (∼20°C) for 6 min.\nPlace tubes back on magnetic rack and incubate until the solution completely clears.\nCollect supernatant (100 μL) and transfer to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd AMPure beads at a 0.7:1 bead:cDNA ratio (70 μL) to the supernatant, pipet to mix well.\nIncubate beads in cDNA for 6 min at room temperature (∼20°C).\nPut bead–cDNA mixture on magnetic rack and wait until the solution is completely clear.\nRemove and discard supernatant.\nWash beads with 800 μL of 80% ethanol.\nRemove and discard all residual 80% ethanol from tubes.\nRepeat steps r and s for a total of two washes.\nAllow magnetic beads to dry on the rack for ∼5 min.\nCarefully remove the tube from the magnet and add 30 μL of elution buffer.\nPipet the bead–elution buffer mixture and ensure that it is thoroughly mixed.\nIncubate a room temperature (∼20°C) for 6 min.\nPlace tubes back on magnetic stand and incubate until the solution completely clears.\nCollect and keep supernatant (30 μL) in new 1.5 mL tube.\nPause point: libraries can be stored at –20°C for several months.\nFinal Quality Control of Libraries 30 min.",
    "Evaluate the quality and concentration of undiluted libraries using Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2200) or TapeStation (Agilent 2200) before sequencing. A good library should have the DNA peak at about 500 bp with no small DNA peaks around 100 bp which mostly consist of primer dimers (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1669-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
