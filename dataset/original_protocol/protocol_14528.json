    "1. Induce PCD expression in E. coli\nCombine 1 μL pVP91A-pcaHG PCD expression plasmid (20 ng/μL, Figure 1A) and 20 μL of E.coli BL21 (20 μL commercially available cells, > 2 x 106 cfu/μg plasmid) in a tube. Flick the tube to mix. Place the tube on ice 5 min.\nPlace transformation at 42 °C for 30 s. Then ice 2 min.\nAdd 80 μL SOC media (super optimal broth with catabolite repression: 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM glucose). Shake at 225 revolutions per min (rpm) 37 °C for 1 h.\nPlate the transformation reaction on LB Amp Agar (1L Luria Broth agar: 10 g NaCl, 10 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 15 g agar, 50 μg/mL ampicillin; 25 mL per 10 cm diameter petri dish).\nIncubate the plate, lid facing down, at 37 °C for 16-18 h.\nInoculate 50 mL LB Amp (1L LB: 10 g bacto-tryptone, 10 g NaCl, 5 g yeast extract, 50 μg/mL ampicillin) in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with one colony. Incubate at 37 °C for 16-18 h shaking at 225 rpm.\nTransfer 20 mL culture to a 4 L flask with 1 L LB Amp. Shake at 225 rpm at 37 °C.\nEvery h measure the culture OD600 (optical density at 600 nm). As the culture OD600 nears 0.5, increase the frequency of measurements to every 15 min. The desired density of the culture is 0.5 OD600.\nTransfer the 4L flask to a bin of ice. Swirl the flask in the ice bath to reduce the culture temperature.\nNote: The time on ice should be kept to a minimum so that the cells remain metabolically active. Ideally the cells will be on ice less than 10 min.",
    "Successful induction of PCD can be observed by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Harvest 1 mL of the uninduced culture in a tube. Spin the sample 1 min at 14,000 x g in a microfuge at ambient temperature. Decant the supernatant.\n\t\nSolubilize the pelleted cells in 150 μL PBS (phosphate buffered saline).\nAdd an equal volume of 2X loading dye (1.2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.0018% bromophenol blue, 15% β-mercaptoethanol). Vortex the sample to mix thoroughly.\nBoil the sample for 3 min and transfer to ice. The sample can be stored in a -20 °C freezer for future analysis.\nNote: PBS is commercially available with or without CaCl2 and MgCl2. Many laboratories will have PBS without CaCl2 and MgCl2 for cell culture methods. We have found no difference with PBS with or without CaCl2 and MgCl2.\nTransfer the 4 L flask to an incubator at 17 °C with 180 rpm shaking. Continue to monitor the OD600 every 20 min.\nAt 0.7 OD600 add isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to 0.5 mM final concentration (0.25 M stock solution) and 10 mg/L ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 10 mg/mL stock solution). PCD genes pcaH and pcaG are induced from the T5 promoter by the addition of IPTG (Figure 1A). Iron sulfate is bound by PCD and required for catalytic activity by coordinating oxygen during catechol opening.\nShake the culture at 180 rpm at 17 °C for 18 h.\nPlace the culture flask in ice as in 1.2. Harvest 1 mL of the induced cells for SDS-PAGE as in 1.3.",
    "Pour the bacterial culture to bottles appropriate for centrifugation. A 1 L culture may be centrifuged in 4 250 mL conical bottom bottles. Pellet the culture at 4 °C for 20 min at 3000 x g. Decant the supernatants. Dispose of bacterial liquid waste appropriately.\nPipet to resuspend the pellets in 25 mL cold PBS (CaCl2 and MgCl2 are optional) per 1 L culture.\nTransfer the resuspension to 50 mL conical tubes (1 50 mL tube per 1 L culture). Pellet the cells at 3000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant and dispose appropriately.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL of lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole, 10 % glycerol, 800 ng/mL Pepstatin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, and 87.1 μg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) by pipetting. Freeze the resuspension with liquid nitrogen in a Dewar flask. Store the sample tubes in a -80 °C freezer. We have purified PCD from pellets stored at -80 °C for one year with no apparent loss of activity.\nCompare the uninduced and induced cells by SDS-PAGE.\nNote: We have had no difficulty with induction of PCD heterodimer. However, we recommend testing the induction before continuing with the purification in the event any reagent has expired unexpectedly.\n\t\nAssemble plates for SDS-PAGE (dimensions: 7.3 cm x 8.3 cm x 0.75 mm thick). The stacking gel is 1.5 mL 6% polyacrylamide (6% acrylamide, 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% ammonium persulfate, 0.001% TEMED). The resolving gel is 3.5 mL 12% polyacrylamide (12% acrylamide, 375 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% ammonium persulfate, 0.001% TEMED). Insert a 10 well comb to the stacking layer.\nLoad 10 μL of uninduced and induced bacterial samples. Load 4 μL of prestained molecular weight markers for proteins (Figure 1B).",
    "Electrophorese the gel at 16.5 V/cm approximately 1 h. The bromophenol blue should reach the bottom of the gel.\nPlace the gel in Coomassie Blue stain (10% acetic acid, 40% methanol, 0.1% Coomassie Blue dye) in a plastic tub. The stain should completely immerse the gel. Stain at ambient temperature for 20 min. Gentle rotation during staining is optional.\nReplace the solution with destain (10% acetic acid, 40% methanol). Incubate at ambient temperature with optional gentle rotation until protein bands are readily visible.\nReplace the destain with deionized water. Among the bacterial proteins, the induced PCD subunits should be visible in the induced cells. Hexahistidine tagged PCD subunit pcaH has a molecular weight of 28.3 kDa and the pcaG subunit is 22.4 kDa. If the PCD subunits are not apparent, a new induction derived from a novel colony should be performed.\n2. Nickel affinity chromatography purification of PCD\nThaw on ice one 50 mL tube of induced cells. It may take 2-3 h to completely thaw the sample.\nKeeping the tube on ice, sonicate the sample at 30% amplitude for 1 min, cycling 1 s on and off. Use a tapered microtip (diameter 0.125 inches) sonicator. Maximum power is 400 W and frequency is 20 kHz and per 1 L culture pellet.\nFollowing sonication, add lysozyme to 0.2 mg/mL final concentration (10 mg/ml stock solution) and keep on ice for 30 min at 4 °C.\nPour the bacterial lysate into a pre-chilled polycarbonate bottle (dimensions: 25 mm x 89 mm). The bottle should be compatible with a fixed angle ultracentrifuge rotor. Other tubes and/or rotors may be substituted, but the final gravitation force should be maintained.\nCentrifuge for 60 min at 120,000 x g at 4 °C. Cellular debris will form a pellet. The supernatant may appear yellow.",
    "The pellet may be included in subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis to determine the solubility of PCD (Figure 1B). Solubilize the pellet by vortexing in 10 mL PBS. Transfer 150 μL to a 1.5 mL tube. Prepare the sample for SDS-PAGE as in 1.3.\nPour the supernatant to a cold 50 mL conical tube. Note the volume. Contamination of the supernatant with bacterial DNA may yield a viscous sample. The bacterial genomic DNA could block the column flow. The ultracentrifugation step 2.2 should be repeated to pellet the bacterial DNA. A pellet from this second spin may not be readily visible or may be transparent.\nMake 500 mL Ni Buffer A (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol, 800 ng/mL Pepstatin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, and 87.1 μg/mL PMSF) and 500 mL Ni Buffer B (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 800 ng/mL Pepstatin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, and 87.1 μg/mL PMSF, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Pass both Ni Buffers through 0.2 μm pore filters.\nThe sample, buffers, and the FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) system are in a refrigerated room at 4 °C. Wash pump A with Ni Buffer A and pump B with Ni Buffer B. Wash the system with 20 mM imidazole (8% Ni Buffer B, 92% Ni Buffer A) until the UV and conductivity stabilize. We routinely flow buffers at 5 mL/min with a 1.0 MPa pressure limit. The flow rate and pressure limit should be determined by the specifications of the FPLC instrument used.\nPrepare a column with 1.5 mL nickel-charged resin (dimensions: 110 mm long x 5 mm). The resin binding capacity is 50 mg/mL and can tolerate 1 MPa pressure. A column may be poured and stored at 4 °C before purification.",
    "Note: The size of the column may be proportionally increased to accommodate more than one 50 mL tube of induced cells if more protein is required. We prefer a fresh column for each preparation to ensure that no residual proteins contaminate our desired protein. However, nickel resins may be recycled according to manufacturer's instructions.\nAttach the column of nickel-charged resin to the FPLC. Run 20 mL of 92% Ni Buffer A and 8% Ni Buffer B (20 mM imidazole) at 0.5 mL/min with a 0.5 MPa pressure limit through the column to equilibrate. In real time the FPLC should measure A280 (280 nm UV absorbance) as well as conductivity. If these values have not stabilized after 20 mL volume has passed through the column, flow the buffers until they have stabilized.\nLoad the sample to the column (~10 mL) at 0.15 mL/min. Set the pressure limit to 0.5 MPa. Collect the flow through.\nWash the column with 20 mL Ni Buffer at 20 mM imidazole (92% Ni Buffer A and 8% Ni Buffer B). Retain the wash in a 50 mL tube for analysis. Wash the column with 15 mL of 50% Ni Buffer A and 50% Ni Buffer B (125 mM imidazole). Collect the elution in 19 fractions of 0.8 mL volume. Wash the column with 15 mL 100% Ni Buffer B. Collect an additional 75 fractions of 0.2 mL. Some PCD heterodimer will elute in the 50% Ni Buffer B wash, but the majority of the heterodimer will elute in the 100% Ni Buffer B wash.",
    "Analyze collected fractions on 12% SDS-PAGE gels to confirm presence of PCD. Add equal volumes of 2X loading dye to the flow through, wash, and peak A280 fractions. Boil for 3 min. Transfer to ice. Pour two 12% SDS-PAGE gels (as in step 1.7). Repeat the gel method as described in 1.7.\n3. Nuclease activity assay\nBased on the SDS-PAGE analysis, identify nickel affinity fractions that contain nearly pure PCD. Combine 5 μL chromatography fraction and 500 ng 3 kb supercoiled plasmid pXba+ in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT) with a final volume of 50 μL.\n\t\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nInclude a negative control (no added protein) and a positive control (commercially available PCD). Stop the reaction with 10 μL stop solution (150 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.6% SDS, 18% glycerol, 0.15% Orange G).\nSamples may be kept in a -20 °C freezer to be analyzed later. Any supercoiled plasmid may be used in a nuclease assay as long as the supercoiled and relaxed circle reaction products may be resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nPour a 120 mL 1% agarose gel in 1X TAE ethidium buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 µg/mL ethidium bromide) in a gel cast (dimensions: 15 x 10 cm). Use a 15 well comb (well dimensions: 5mm x 1.5 mm). When the gel has set, immerse it in 1X TAE ethidium buffer.\nAnalyze 30 μL of the reactions by agarose gel. Electrophorese at 10 V/cm at ambient temperature for approximately 1 h. The Orange G dye front should be at the end of the gel.",
    "Use a fluorescence scanner to immediately image the ethidium bromide signal of the gel. If a 3 kb plasmid was used, the slowest band will be relaxed circles at ~3.5 kb, linear DNA will run at 3 kb, and supercoiled plasmid will have the fastest mobility at ~2 kb.\n\t\nCalculate the total pixel volume of each lane with image analysis software.\nDetermine the pixel volume of the various DNA species, such as supercoiled, linear, and nicked circles. Use these values to determine the percentage of each DNA species. For example, increased presence of nicked circles associated with a fraction compared to the negative control indicates the presence of nuclease. The pixel volume of nicked circles in a lane is divided by the pixel value of total DNA. Determine a percentage by multiplying this number by 100.\nCombine fractions from the second elution peak that contain nearly pure PCD heterodimer based on SDS-PAGE analysis and have minimal to undetectable nuclease activity. Our typical pooled volume is ~2 mL.\nLoad the sample to a centrifugal filter unit with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff. Centrifuge in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4000 x g for 40 min at 4 °C. Alternatively a 35° fixed angle rotor may be used at 7500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\n\t\nRepeat the centrifugation until the final retentate volume is 100-200 μL.\nInvert the filter unit and recover the retentate by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.\n4. Size exclusion chromatography purification of PCD",
    "Make 250 mL size exclusion chromatography (SEC) running buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 800 ng/mL Pepstatin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, and 87.1 μg/mL PMSF). Pass the buffer through a 0.2 μm pore filter and store at 4 °C.\nNote: Perform all steps in a refrigerated room at 4 °C. SEC purification is optional, but the protein should be stored in SEC running buffer. If SEC purification is omitted, the retentate collected in 3.6.2. should be dialyzed against 1 L of SEC buffer in 10 kDa MWCO (molecular weight cut off) dialysis tubing at 4 °C overnight.\nEquilibrate a cross-linked agarose SEC (size exclusion chromatography) column (dimesions: 10 mm x 300 mm; 24 mL bed volume; 25 - 500 μL sample volume; 1.5 MPa pressure limit; 2 x 106 Da exclusion limit; 1 to 300 kDa separation) with SEC Running Buffer at 0.5 mL/min.\nNote: If desired alternative size SEC columns may be used.\nLoad the concentrated fractions to a 200 μL volume injection loop. Load the sample at 0.5 mL/min to the column. SEC resolution increases with smaller load volume. Elute with 23 mL SEC running buffer and collect 94 fractions of 250 μL. The SEC chromatogram should resolve a single A280 peak that is the PCD heterodimer. We find that PCD elutes 8.9 mL. The elution timing will change with alternative SEC columns.\n5. PCA oxidation and nuclease activity assays",
    "Reactions to assay both oxidation of PCA and nuclease activity are performed in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. Assemble reactions in a 96 well plate on ice in a 4 °C cold room to prevent premature catalysis. Combine in a final volume of 50 μL: 130 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 5 mM PCA, 10 ng/mL supercoiled plasmid pXba+, and 10 μL of individual PCD SEC fractions.\nNote: The PCD SEC fractions should be added last and immediately before analysis as the protein will begin catalysis at the time of addition.\nPCD oxidation of PCA results in reduced absorbance of PCA at 290 nm (A290). Transfer the 96 well plate to the plate holder of a plate reader set to an internal temperature of 37 °C. Retract the plate holder into the instrument and measure A290 at 20 s intervals for 1 h. Have the instrument shake the plate 5 s before each reading.\nAfter 1 h, terminate the reactions by adding 10 μL stop solution (150 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.6% SDS, 18% glycerol, 0.15% Orange G).\nPrepare, load, and run an agarose gel as in step 3.2.\nImage and analyze the agarose gel as in step 3.3.\nSelect fractions with the most PCA oxidation activity and no observed nuclease contamination for long-term storage at -80 °C. Measure the A280.\nCalculate the total PCD concentration using the A280 and the extinction coefficient (ε280) of 734,700 M-1cm-1.",
    "Snap freeze individual fractions in liquid nitrogen. Store in a -80 °C freezer. Alternatively, combine active, nuclease-free fractions, aliquot, and freeze in the same way. Our typical yield is 1-2 mg PCD per L culture. Typical use in a SM experiment is 3 μg PCD. We have used PCD stored at -80 °C for up to 1 year with no decrease in activity.\nSubscription Required.
