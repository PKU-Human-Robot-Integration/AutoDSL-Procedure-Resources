    "Animal Ethics Statement:\nThe protocols described in this manuscript follow the animal care guidelines established by The University of Auckland and Stanford University. P7 rat pups were euthanized by rapid decapitation. Hippocampal dissection is then immediately performed as described below.\n1. Organotypic Hippocampal Slice Culture\nPreparation\n\t\nPrepare dissection Medium (used only for dissecting the brain). Combine 200 ml Minimum Essential Medium, 2 ml penicillin-streptomycin solution (10,000 units of each, in 0.85% NaCl), 5 ml HEPES buffer solution, 2 ml 1 M Tris stock solution (pH 7.2), and filter sterilize with 0.22 μm filter. Carry out hippocampal dissection in ice-cold dissection medium.\nCool the dissection medium. Place the dissection media in the freezer approximately 1 hr prior to beginning the dissection until the liquid is very cold. Do not allow large ice crystals to form. Store on ice until required.\nPrepare culture medium (used for everything except dissection of hippocampi). Combine 100 ml Minimum Essential Medium, (1x concentration, liquid) w/Hank’s salts, w/ L-glutamine, 2 ml penicillin-streptomycin solution (liquid, 10,000 units of each, in 0.85% NaCl ), 2.5 ml HEPES 1 M buffer solution, 50 ml Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, 50 ml Horse Serum (defined, heat inactivated), and filter sterilize with 0.22 μm filter.\nPrepare the culture dishes. Place 1 ml of culture media per 35 mm culture dish, and add a membrane insert to each dish. Put up to seven of these dishes into one 150 mm Petri dish (referred to hereafter as a ‘plate’). Place the plate in a CO2 incubator for at least an hour before the dissection begins so that the culture medium in the dishes attains the proper temperature and pH.\nDissection of the Hippocampi from Rat Pups at Postnatal Day 7 (P7)\n\t\nPre-sterilize all dissection tools under UV light before the procedure.",
    "After rapid decapitation, remove the brain and place into chilled medium in one dish, and then remove it to a piece of moistened filter paper for the dissection. Tease the cortex away from the midbrain using blunt smooth plastic-coated miniature spatulas, exposing the hippocampus. Cut the fornix, and then gently work the spatula underneath the hippocampus to flip it out (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Successful slice cultures can be prepared using animals up to P10.\nTrim the isolated hippocampus away from the rest of the brain. Transfer the hippocampi into a new dish containing chilled dissection media using a moistened soft paintbrush (e.g., white sable #4).\nClean the underside (i.e. the flatter side) of the hippocampus of choroid plexus during dissection, as these spongy, meninge-like tissues make it difficult to separate hippocampal slices from one another later on.\n\t\tNOTE: Leave these tissues in place if they cannot be teased away gently.\nPerform the entire dissection as quickly as possible without damaging the hippocampi.\n\t\tNOTE: A careful dissection is more important than a fast one, as long as the experimental conditions are chilled. Slice the hippocampi from three rats simultaneously. The slice health is not affected as long as the total time from start to when the plated slices go into the incubator is under 30 min.\nSlicing\n\t\nSlice the hippocampi transversely into 400 μm cross-sections using a manual tissue slicer. The method by which the slicing is conducted is not important, so long as it is not overly damaging to the tissue and produces slices of consistent thickness with readily visible laminar architecture (i.e. Ammon’s Horn is easily seen to be preserved in the tissue).",
    "Lie the hippocampi on the stage of the tissue chopper on top of a triple thickness of #2 filter paper. The hippocampi are sliced entirely without removing any slices individually (i.e. the entire hippocampus is left on the stage of the chopper until all cuts have been made; rather like loaves of sliced bread at this point; Figure 1B).\nTransfer the hippocampi into dissection medium using a soft paintbrush laid next to each hippocampus (white sable #2). Gently push each hippocampus to the side to break the adhesion between the hippocampus and the underlying filter paper. Roll the brush underneath each hippocampus to pick it up off the stage. Place all hippocampi into the same 35 mm Petri dish of chilled dissection medium. Separate the hippocampi into individual slices by manually agitating the dish in alternating clockwise and counterclockwise motions.\nInspect the slices under a dissecting microscope and discard any which are damaged, small, or which do not possess clearly visible cell body layers.\n\t\tNOTE: It will often be the case that not all the slices are successfully separated from their siblings in this manner. In this case, they can be separated by turning them on edge and prodding them with the tips of fine forceps. “Good” slices are then transferred to another clean Petri dish containing chilled dissection medium using a cut off and fire-polished Pasteur pipette (Figures 1C-E).\nStorage\n\t\nPlace the individual slices onto the membrane filter inserts. Using a Pasteur pipette cut off and fire polished to give a larger bore, individually transfer slices to the culture inserts.",
    "NOTE: The size of the bore created when cutting and fire-polishing the pipette is important. Too small and the slices will not easily leave the pipette for the membrane. Too large and excess fluid is placed on the surface of the membrane along with the slice. The best bore diameter is typically about half the diameter of the barrel of the pipette. When cutting, this diameter can be chosen by cutting at the proper place on the taper of the pipette.\nSlice Transfer\n\t\t\nFill the pipette with medium first, and then suck up a single slice with small suction forces. This keeps the slice near the opening of the pipette and prevents too much medium expulsion into the insert to place the slice.\nApply a slight pressure on the bulb to form a small hanging droplet, allow the slice to settle into that droplet, and then touch that droplet to the membrane and let the slice “fall” onto the membrane. Generally three slices are placed onto each membrane insert.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the fluid droplet is too large, the droplets from the three slices tend to merge on the membrane surface, and the slices will thus all gather to the center of the membrane, making it more difficult to separate them for electrophysiological recording later.\nFluid Removal\n\t\t\nAspirate any excess medium from the top of the culture plate insert for all slices in that plate (3 slices per insert = 21 slices per plate), so that slices are not immersed in or surrounded by a pool of dissection medium.",
    "Perform this is with an uncut, but fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Allow the slice to settle and adhere to the membrane for a minute before pipetting. Take care not to suck the slice up into the pipette. Carry out fluid removal for the inserts that are plated first, to allow sufficient time for the slices to settle.\nSlice Storage\n\t\t\nStore slice cultures in a 5.0% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Observe the final arrangement of the cultures in Figure 1E. The individual slices rest upon a culture plate insert which has a porous membrane for a bottom, and this insert fits inside a Petri dish filled with a small amount of medium; by this means, the slices are not immersed in the medium, but have access to it only through the membrane at the bottom of the culture plate insert.\nOptionally, remove the slices may for study either by removing the culture plate insert or by cutting out a section of insert membrane containing a slice.\nMaintenance\n\t\nExchange the medium in the Petri dishes the day after making cultures. Transfer the culture plate insert to a new petri dish containing 1 ml of fresh culture medium that is equilibrated in the incubator for at least an hour prior to transfer.\nChange the medium again in the same manner on the third day after making cultures. On the third day, transfer the cultures to an incubator set at 34 °C. Change the medium twice each week (every 3-4 days).\nIdentify healthy cultures. Select healthy cultures for paired whole cell recordings.",
    "NOTE: Healthy cultures have a well-defined edge and a clearly defined pyramidal cell layer. Cultures with dark (likely necrotic) areas present or a vacuolated appearance with flattened borders are rejected. Employing these criteria, usually two-thirds of slice cultures are sufficiently healthy for recording.\nUtilize these cultures within a fairly small window of time. Do not used tissues that are cultured for more than two weeks since the neurons begin to display slightly epileptiform behavior which slowly worsens with time. The exact upper limit of neuronal survival is not known but it is possible to record from functioning pyramidal cells as late as 16 weeks in culture.\n2. Paired Whole Cell Recordings\nACSF and Intracellular Solutions\n\t\nPrepare presynaptic electrode solution by mixing (in mM) 120 potassium gluconate, 40 HEPES, 5 MgCl2, 2 NaATP, and 0.3 NaGTP (pH 7.2 with KOH; osmolarity: 290 mOsm). Whilst the same electrode solution is used for postsynaptic neurons, cesium gluconate (120 mM) is typically used as the major salt in the postsynaptic electrode, plus 5 mM QX314.\n\t\tNOTE: This enables stable voltage clamping at positive potentials to record postsynaptic NMDAR-mediated currents8-10,13. It also prevents the potassium-induced hyperexcitability of the presynaptic neuron by the internal solution flowing from the postsynaptic recording electrode before a giga ohm seal is made.\nPrepare postsynaptic electrode solution composing (in mM) 120 cesium gluconate, 40 HEPES, 5 MgCl2, 5 QX314, 2 NaATP, and 0.3 NaGTP (pH 7.2 with CsOH; osmolarity: 290 mOsm). Pull glass microelectrodes at 5-10 MΩ resistance and fill with filtered internal solution.",
    "Prepare artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) composing (in mM) 119 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, pH 7.4, saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. NOTE: If AMPAR-mediated responses need to be blocked for examination of NMDAR EPSCs, include 10 μM CNQX or NBQX in the ACSF.\nObtain Paired Whole Cell Recordings\n\t\nTo examine synaptic transmission between two individual neurons, designate one neuron as the presynaptic neuron and hold in current clamp to induce action potentials and initiate synaptic transmission.\nDesignate the second neuron, as the postsynaptic neuron, and hold it in current or voltage clamp depending on the information required by the researcher. Obtain detailed examination of the glutamatergic currents, with AMPAR-mediated EPSCs examined at -65 mV and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs examined at +30 mV6-16 by holding the postsynaptic neuron in voltage clamp\nEstablish a paired recording. To establish a paired recording, the presynaptic whole cell recording is always obtained first, enabling multiple sequential postsynaptic neurons to be obtained until one that is synaptically connected is obtained. If performing synaptic plasticity experiments, it is especially critical to obtain the presynaptic neuron first as the induction of LTP in the postsynaptic neuron must be initiated within 10 min of obtaining the whole cell recordings to prevent washout of cytoplasmic factors required for LTP8,19.\nAvoid movement-induced cell loss. A major challenge when performing paired whole cell recordings is avoiding vibration and movement-induced disruption of the first whole cell recording whilst obtaining the second recording.\n\t\t\nObtain the first whole cell recording and then move the microscope lens 10-200 μm in the x-axis so that the established recording is located at the edge of the area visible on the monitor (Figure 2A).",
    "Raise the lens of the microscope ~5-10 mm while ensuring that the ACSF still maintains contact with the lens. Mount the second electrode and guide into the fluid meniscus (Figure 2B).\nMove the electrode in the x-y plane until it is directly under the light path through the lens but still significantly above the established recording electrode. Once the electrode is visible under the microscope, ensure the tip is at the far edge of the monitor away from the first electrode.\nMove the second electrode down in sequence with the microscope focus until both electrodes are in the same focal plane. It is important that the level of positive pressure is strong enough to avoid tip blockage but not too strong so as to disrupt the first whole cell recording. This translates to the positive pressure inducing movement in 2-3 neurons from the electrode when it first enters the slice.\nLocate a postsynaptic partner in a similar focal plane to the first presynaptic recording (Figure 2C). Recording is generally Obtain paired recordings between CA3 pyramidal neurons the second whole cell from a 0-200 mm neuron of the first recording (Figures 2C,D).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Synaptic transmission between neuronal pairs are stable over time periods of up to 3-4 hr when using these standard whole cell recording techniques.\nSynaptic plasticity: Once Upon obtaining a successful synaptically-connected pyramidal cell pair (Figures 3A,B), examine the characteristics of synaptic transmission and plasticity.\n\t\nLTP induction.\n\t\t\nInduce LTP by pairing presynaptic action potentials (1 Hz) with postsynaptic depolarization to -10 to 0 mV for 1 min (Figure 3C)7-9,12-14. Initiate pairing within 10 min of break-in to the postsynaptic neuron.",
    "NOTE: LTP can also be induced with both neurons held in current clamp by pairing presynaptic and postsynaptic action potentials at 1 Hz for 1 min, with postsynaptic action potentials elicited 10 msec following injection of current into the presynaptic neuron8.\nFurther induce LTD by low frequency stimulation (LFS) at 1 Hz combined with a slight depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron to -55 mV for 5-10 min (Figure 3C)9.\nSubscription Required.
