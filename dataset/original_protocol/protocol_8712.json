  "procedures": [
    "The University of Rochester's University Committee on Animal Resources approved all procedures performed in this paper.\n1. Pre-surgical Preparation (and Mice)\nPrepare the surgical area with all required equipment. Sterilize all tools used during the procedure beforehand using 70% ethanol. Optionally, use a glass-bead sterilizer or autoclave to sterilize the tools.\nPlace the mouse in an isoflurane induction chamber connected to an isoflurane vaporizer. Set isoflurane levels to 4% at a rate of 1 L/min.\n\tNote: for the experiments reported here, mice with a doxycycline (DOX) inducible HIV-1 Tat transgene driven by the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) promoter (HIV Tat-Tg mice)10 were used to examine the effect of HIV-1 induced neuroinflammation on cerebral vascular structure, as previously described7,10.\nGently tip the induction chamber to observe the mouse's righting reflex. Once the righting reflex has been suppressed, set the isoflurane level to 2% and redirect the airflow from the induction chamber to the nose cone at the surgical bench.\nQuickly move the mouse from the induction chamber to the water infused heating pad. Continue to apply isoflurane (1.5-2%) through the nose cone. Adjust anesthesia according to individual mouse tolerance assessed through respiratory rate (RR) monitoring.\n\tNote: The depression of RR can perturb physiologic gas parameters altering cerebral blood flow and vessel diameter assessment. Attempt to keep RR between 55-65 breaths per minute. Heart rate (HR) can also be used assess depth of anesthesia; keep HR between 300-450 beats per minute to prevent physiologic changes to vessel diameter. Typically, anesthesia will be adequate between 1.5-2.0% isoflurane at 1 L/min for a given mouse.\nPerform a toe pinch to further check the depth of anesthesia. If the mouse does not respond, commence the surgical procedures.\n2. Preparation of the Thin-skull Cranial Window",
    "Apply artificial tear gel to the eyes of the mouse. Completely remove the hair from the scalp of the mouse using scissors or an electric razor.\nSterilize the scalp by applying povidone-iodine solution; allow to dry. Then, under a light microscope, remove the skin from the scalp of the mouse, completely exposing the parietal bones, caudal frontal bones, and bregma marking.\nApply a small quantity of a 10% ferric chloride solution to the skull in order to dry the membranes for easy removal. Remove the dried membranes with the #5/45 forceps by gently scraping the skull.\nApply a thin layer of glue around the headplate window. Gently press the headplate against the skull of the mouse, keeping the area of interest in the center of the window. Apply a drop of dental cement to the headplate to polymerize the glue.\nApply a thin layer of glue along the edge of the headplate window to create a reservoir in which to hold saline. Once the glue has dried, screw the headplate into the mouse headplate harness.\n\tNote: the mouse headplate harness used in this procedure is a structure with a metal base and two metal columns. On each column there is one spring and one wing nut. The headplate is placed on top of the spring, and the wing nut is tightened until the head is level and does not move.\nRemove any glue from the headplate window using a drill bit attached to a microtorque drill set at 6,000 rpm. Stop every 10-15 sec to prevent overheating of mouse cranium that can result in structural damage to vessels.",
    "Using a new drill bit, place the microtorque drill 1.5 mm laterally from midline (one-third of the diameter of the headplate window). Begin to thin the skull around this location at 4,000 rpm. Move the drill gently across the skull with no direct downward pressure.\nCease drilling every 10-15 sec to prevent overheating the mouse cranium. During this time, remove the accumulated skull dust using a compressed air canister.\nUse drops of RT saline to cool cranium for 5-10 sec. Gently remove all fluid with a soft tissue to continue skull thinning.\nFor the final thinning of the skull, place a small volume of saline in the headplate reservoir and lightly sweep a dental microblade over the area of interest until small vessels are clearly visible.\n3. Monitoring of Physiological Parameters\nOnce the skull is completely thinned, detach the mouse from the holder and place it on its back. Gently tape down both hind legs to clearly expose the medial thighs.\nRemove the hair over both medial thighs with scissors or an electric shaver. Disinfect the surgical site by covering the thighs with povidone-iodine.\nPinch the skin on the medial right thigh above the femoral vein and artery using the #5 forceps. Gently pull the skin upwards and use scissors to cut and remove the skin.\n\tNote: the left thigh is reserved in the event of surgical complications (vascular anomalies, ruptured vessels).\nApply approximately 3-5 drops of 0.9% saline to surgical site. This allows for greater magnification of vessels, as well as keeping the site moisturized and preventing drying of the vessels. Separate the femoral vein from artery by bluntly dissecting into the femoral neurovascular bundle using two #5/45 forceps.",
    "Place two, 3 cm pieces of surgical suture underneath the femoral artery approximately 1 cm apart. Twist the upper suture clockwise to create a vascular tourniquet that will help to prevent excessive blood loss during catheterization.\nMake a small incision in the femoral artery using the spring scissors. Place the catheter in the artery through the incision and advance until the catheter is securely within the artery.\nUntwist the upper suture (tourniquet) to assess for leaks and proper catheter placement. Secure the catheter in the femoral artery by tying two knots around the catheter within the vessel using the sutures.\nInject 10 µl of heparin (100 IU/ml) through the catheter to prevent blood clotting. Then, surgically close the right thigh by sewing the skin together with a 4-0 suture in a simple interrupted pattern.\nInject 50 µl of urethane (1.2 mg/g) intraperitoneally into the right lower quadrant. Five minutes later repeat with another 50 µl injection to the left lower quadrant for a total of 100 µl of intraperitoneal urethane. Slowly reduce the isoflurane levels to approximately 0.25% while concomitantly rechecking mouse for the depth of anesthesia.\n\tNote: Keep the needle superficial within the peritoneal cavity along the posterior abdominal wall so that it does not perforate the bowel. This can be accomplished by pinching the abdominal rectus muscles away from the viscera and then injecting.\nUsing a capillary tube, collect a 40 µl sample of arterial blood from the catheter. Attach the catheter to the blood pressure transducer fitted with a saline-filled four-way stopcock and heparin-filled syringe.\nTape the blood pressure transducer to the surgical apparatus to prevent the unintended removal of the catheter. Begin monitoring of mean arterial pressure.",
    "Insert the blood filled capillary tube into a blood gas analyzer entry port. Once all the blood has been extracted, remove the capillary tube from the entry port. The O2 and CO2 blood gas levels will appear on a paper printed from the blood gas analyzer.\n4. Injection of the Fluorescent Dye\nPinch the skin on the medial left thigh using the #5 forceps. Gently pull the skin upwards and use scissors to cut and remove the skin. Prepare dextran conjugated red emitting rhodamine dye (70 kDa) (10 mg/kg dissolved in saline).\nLocate the femoral vein.Using a 1 ml syringe with a 30 G needle attached, draw a previously prepared solution of a fluorescent dye appropriate for imaging to the 130 µl line of the syringe. Remove all air bubbles by drawing the dye completely into the syringe and firmly flicking the syringe wall.\n\t\nBend the 30 G needle at an approximately 30 degree angle by pressing it against a hard surface bevel side up. Fill the needle with the dye and discard any excess liquid, leaving a 100 µl sample.\nInject the 100 µl sample of dye slowly into the femoral vein. After removing the needle, apply steady, gently pressure to the site of injection to stop any bleeding. Allow the dye to circulate for 5 min.\n\tNote: alternatively, the right femoral vein can be used instead for the fluorescent dye injection to prevent further blood loss through the creation of another surgical site. In addition, if the animal is bleeding uncontrollably from the surgical site, this may be an indication that too much heparin was given to flush the catheter. If there is no clotting within 10-15 min and the mouse is still bleeding, consider restarting the experiment with a new mouse.",
    "Close the left thigh by sewing the skin together with a 4-0 suture, then carefully flip the mouse onto its stomach, and place it into the mouse headplate harness.\n5. In Vivo Two-Photon Imaging\nMove the surgical apparatus to the two-photon microscope, making sure to maintain continuous anesthesia levels. Place a small quantity of 0.9 % saline into the headplate reservoir and lower the microscope objective so that it comes into contact with the saline. Locate the area of interest using the brightfield-viewing objective\nSet the two-photon laser excitation to a wavelength appropriate for the fluorescent dye. Begin two-photon imaging using the 25x objective.\n\tNote that in these experiments we used a dextran conjugated to a red emitting rhodamine dye that was excited at a wavelength of 780 nm. A 607/36 bandpass emission filter to detect the fluorescence from the dye, and a 480/20 bandpass emission filter was used to detect arterial autofluorescence\nLocate a capillary bed on the view screen, and magnify this area using optical zoom 2. Acquire images of the capillaries using the two-photon imaging software.\nAfter imaging is complete, sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation.\n6. Ex Vivo Two-Photon Imaging\nUsing the extra fine scissors, make an incision in the scalp from the interparietal bones to the frontal bones of the mouse. Secure the skin to the sides of the skull with the pointer finger and thumb.\nPlace the extra fine scissors underneath the medial interparietal bone and cut the skull along the sagittal suture. Stop cutting the skull approximately 3 mm after the bregma marking.\n\tNote: Apply upward pressure when cutting the skull to prevent cutting the brain.",
    "Using the #5 forceps, separate the skull from the brain and carefully remove any meninges from the surface of the brain. Remaining meninges can accidently lacerate the brain; extreme care should be taken to avoid this. Gently slide the #5 forceps under the brain advancing slowly forward until brain is free from skull.\n\tNote: that downward pressure should be used in order to avoid puncturing the brain.\nPlace the brain in a brain sectioning tool specific for mice. Wash the brain by applying drops of artificial cerebrospinal fluid over the brain.\nRemove a 2 mm coronal section of brain from bregma 0 to bregma -2. Place the coronal section onto a concave glass slide containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid with the 0 bregma (most cranial part of the section) facing upwards. Gently cover the brain slice with a glass cover slip.\n\tNote: Avoid pressing the glass once placed on the brain section as this may deform the vascular architecture.\nTransfer the slide to the microscope stage and place a small quantity of 0.9% saline on the cover slip. Lower the microscope objective until it comes in contact with the saline. Locate the midline of the brain using the brightfield objective.\nBegin two-photon imaging and locate the midline again using the 25x objective. Accomplish this by looking for the longitudinal fissure at the cortical surface of the coronal section. Place the right edge of the imaging screen on the midline and move the viewer screen over laterally three complete frames (approximately 1.5 mm from midline).\n\tNote that in these experiments, the imaging parameters were identical to those mentioned in the note in step 5.2.",
    "Locate the depth at which capillaries are barely visible on the view screen. Lower the plane of focus an additional 20 µm to determine the top of the z-stack.\nSet the image thickness to 1 µm. Lower the view screen for 100 µm and adjust laser power throughout such that less than 1% of the pixels are oversaturated.\n\tNote: the z-stack images are compiled from a series of 100 consecutive 500x500x1 µm images. The larger the z-stack the more accurate the post processing calculations will be. Generally, attempt to collect a z-stack of 100 µm or larger.\nPress the XY Repeat icon followed by the adjacent XY icon. Once the z-stack is complete, press the Series Done icon and save the file.\n7. Data Processing\nOpen an in vivo capillary image in the ImageJ software. Manually set the pixel to distance ratio based on values obtained from the two-photon software.\n\t\nSelect the *straight* icon from the tools menu. Draw a line extending from one capillary wall to the opposite capillary wall, and record the length provided by ImageJ.\n\t\tNote that it may be necessary to zoom in the image in order to clearly visualize the edges of the capillary walls.\nRepeat step 7.1.1 at different locations along the capillary, as well as for multiple capillaries in the image.\nOpen the z-stack file into the analytical software such as Amira. Select the Filament Editor icon from the sub-application toolbar\n\t\nSet the viewer thickness to approximately 20. Move the viewer to either the top or bottom of the z-stack.\nSelect the Trace icon and move the cursor over the loaded image. Place nodes on the capillaries at the locations described in Figure 2C; segments will automatically appear between adjacent nodes. Trace capillaries throughout the entire z-stack.",
    "Note: it will be necessary to place nodes in between end points and branch points in order to trace the capillaries throughout the z-stack.\nTo remove these nodes, click the Remove Intermediate icon.\n\t\tNote: This can create erroneous looped segments that must be removed manually by selecting the loop using the Select Single icon, and then selecting the Remove Selected icon. If loops continue to appear in the same area during tracing, it is likely that the nodes were placed on different capillaries.\nOnce the tracing is complete, select the Graph Info icon to open a spreadsheet containing the automatically extracted vascular parameters. The number of nodes and segments are available on the main view screen.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
