    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnesthesia of neonatal mouse\nTiming: up to 3 min; ∼30 s anesthesia\nThis step describes the anesthesia of neonatal mice before injection. The pups are anesthetized separately right before injection with a high concentration of isoflurane. Lower concentration of isoflurane or injection anesthesia are less efficient and lead to higher mortality rate. Alternatively – where permitted by the local authorities – hypothermia could serve for anesthetizing neonates.\nSeparate the whole litter of pups from the mother and place onto a heated pad (∼35°C) next to the injection setup. Add bedding and nesting material to ensure comfort and to enable pups to retain maternal smell. All injected pups are returned together to the home cage following recovery.\nAdd 0.5 mL isoflurane to a 50 mL falcon tube padded with tissue paper and close the lid tightly, in order to quickly achieve a high concentration of vaporized isoflurane.\nPlace one neonate inside the falcon tube and close the lid. Observe closely for the moment the pup stops struggling and immediately take it out. Test anesthesia by light toe pinching. If you get a reaction, put it back for an additional 10 s of anesthesia.\nCritical: To minimize lethality, the anesthetizing time should be kept as short as possible. Take care that pups do not come into direct contact with liquid isoflurane to avoid skin irritation. For very young mice (P0–2), the pup could be taken out shortly before all movement stops, since the remaining anesthetic in the airway is enough to induce anesthesia for the injection.\nInjection of viral vectors\nTiming: up to 5 min",
    "This step describes the injection of viral vectors (for example AAV9, PHP.eB) into the lateral ventricle of neonatal mice under ultrasound guidance (we use the Ultrasound imaging system Vevo 1100 with a microscan transducer MS550D (22–55 MHz, resolution ∼50 μm, imaging depth 12 mm), Visualsonics. Alternatively, any ultrasound system providing a similar resolution and imaging depth should suffice). If high expression levels are required and available viral titer is low, several injections of neonates on consequent days are a possible solution (for example injection on P2 and P3). If different viruses are injected into the same litter, marking the pups (e.g., by tattooing on the paws) is essential.\nFix pup on the injection stage with tape (ideally a gentle-adhesive tape leaving no glue residue on the skin), cover pup’s head with ample ultrasound gel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPre-positioning of microinjection needle for actual ventricular injection.\nFind lateral ventricle for injection (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1347-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Ultrasound video showing the neonatal intraventricular injection process, related to steps 5 and 6\nAlign head of ultrasound device with previously mounted injection needle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nThe microinjection needle is set to be parallel to the ultrasound head. Adjust the needle to approach the head (in y-direction, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) until the tip of the micropipette is dipped in ultrasound gel, under the ultrasound head and in vicinity of the skull.\nMove the microinjection needle (in x-direction, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) until the needle is aligned with the correct ultrasound plane and becomes focused on the ultrasound screen.\nInjection of viral vectors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C; Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPenetrate the pup’s skull until the tip of the microinjection needle is inside the lateral ventricle. If the skull dents during this step (a small dent is common (see Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) and does not affect skull integrity or transduction. If the dent is significantly > 0.5 mm, abort injection and exchange the needle), retract the micropipette once the tip reaches the designated spot until the skull regains its proper shape.\nInject up to 3 μL of viral solution into the lateral ventricle at a flux rate of 30 nL/s.\nWithdraw injection needle. When the pup is very young (P1 or 2), and/or using albino mouse-lines, the trypan-blue can be seen filling up the ventricle if injected correctly.\nRecovery of injected mice. Gently remove remaining ultrasound gel from pup with soft tissue and return pup on heating pad (∼35°C). Return pups to the mother only when fully awake (breathing normally and can adjust body posture autonomously) and skin shows healthy pink coloring.",
    "Virally driven expression of fluorescent proteins is detected as early as 3 days post injection, achieving broad peripheral and central nervous system transduction and persisting until early adulthood (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We even experienced continued expression up to 1 year post injection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1347-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Scale bars, 100 μm, scale bars in 21 dpi applies to 1/3/7 dpi in the respective regions.\nCritical: To minimize lethality, the injection should be performed as fast as possible. We usually keep the injection process under 5 minutes per mouse pup. However, the injection flux rate should not exceed 30 nL/s (see step 6), since otherwise it could result in increased intracranial pressure.\nNote: Skin bleeding is usually a sign of incorrect injection depth and/or blunt needle tip. Replace the microinjection needle in this case.\nOptional: Intramuscular injection of small volume (∼1 μL) of viral vectors is possible with this method, and no ultrasound guidance is needed here. For details see Wang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nOptional: Mark mouse pups by tattooing on paws.\nOptional: If genotyping is required to identify experimental animals, obtain tail biopsies.\nOptional: Offer oral analgesia such as Meloxicam (∼5 μg per pup, e.g. 10 μL of 0.5 μg/μL solution).",
    "Pause point: In general, we highly recommend finishing the whole injection procedure rapidly. Short pauses can be taken between injections of each pup. For breaks longer than 10 min, return the litter to the mother/home cage."
