    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSynthesis of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs)\nTiming: 5–7 h\nA thermal decomposition method is used for the synthesis of SPIONs.\nNote: This protocol is modified from(Sun and Zeng, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). See Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for more information on the synthesis setup.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/201-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Setup of the Thermal Decomposition Method Used in SPION Synthesis\n(Note: For presentation purposes, we have placed the SPION synthesis setup on an open bench. However, it is crucial to place the setup in a secure environment such as hood/cabinet before starting the SPION synthesis).\nCaution: All steps mentioned below must be carried out under a fume hood. The protocol involves high-temperature reactions. It is, therefore important to wear PPE at all times.\nPlace the 3-neck flask containing the reagents on the heating mantle.\nCritical: The flask should be large enough (500 mL) and must not be more than half-filled to allow expansion of the liquid and for safe boiling. The heating mantle must fit the flask size. A too small or too large heating mantle will result in poor contact, overheating, or uneven heat distribution during SPION synthesis.\nConnect the reflux condenser to the opening in the center of the 3-neck flask.\nClamp the entire setup (using a proper sized clamp) in the middle of the reflux condenser and secure it to a metal stand providing enough support to the setup.\nCritical: The clamps have to be stable and must be of the proper size as they carry the weight of the entire setup. Make sure to use clamps with rubber tips to prevent it from crushing the glass condensers and joints.\nConnect the inlet and outlet openings of the reflux condenser to the water flow and turn on the water flow.",
    "Critical: Water enters through the lower end and exits through the upper end of the reflux condenser. Make sure there is no water leak, especially at the joints.\nPlace a glass stopper on one of the two remaining openings of the 3-neck flask.\nInsert the temperature probe through the remaining opening of the 3-neck flask and seal the opening.\nCritical: Make sure that the tip of the temperature probe is well immersed in the reaction mixture for accurate temperature reading.\nTurn on the magnetic stirrer (35 × g) and using a tube, slowly pass nitrogen gas (∼1 bar) into the 3-neck flask from the top.\nSlowly remove the glass stopper connected to the 3-neck flask. Leave it open for 5–10 min and let the nitrogen gas flow out through this opening.\nCritical: It is important to carry out the synthesis process under a nitrogen atmosphere. Therefore, it is essential to let the nitrogen gas to flow through the entire setup before sealing it.\nReplace the nitrogen gas delivering tube with a balloon filled with nitrogen gas, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nPlace the glass stopper back and seal all joints using metal holders.\nCritical: Make sure that the complete setup is air-tight and sealed by monitoring the level of nitrogen gas in the inflated balloon.\nTurn on the heating and set the temperature to 200°C.\nCaution: In most cases, the heating mantle does not have a temperature/power control and, therefore, use an external device to control the power input (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Do not plug the heating mantle directly into a wall plug.\nFrom the moment the temperature reaches 200°C, let it continue for 2 h.",
    "Note: The presence of benzyl ether aids in reaching such high temperatures. During this step, the metal precursors decompose (or disintegrate) into small molecules forming nuclei that eventually act as seeds for the formation of SPIONs.\nAfter 2 h, increase the temperature to 300°C.\nCritical: Regulating and maintaining this temperature is critical for the synthesis of spherical SPIONs.\nCaution: In most cases, the heating mantle does not have a temperature/power control and therefore use an external device to control the power input. Do not plug the heating mantle directly on to a wall plug.\nOnce the temperature reaches 300°C, keep it at that temperature for 1 h.\nTurn off the magnetic stirrer and heating. Allow the black colored slurry that is formed to cool down to room temperature (∼20°C) (this takes about 1 h).\nCritical: It is important that the setup is left undisturbed and allowed to cool by itself to room temperature (∼20°C) before being taken out.\nCarefully release the pressure developed inside the 3-neck flask by slowly removing the glass stopper and disassemble the setup.\nCarefully remove the magnetic stir bar and slowly add 300 mL of absolute ethanol to the slurry to precipitate the newly formed SPIONs.\nTransfer the contents from the 3-neck flask to 50 mL glass tubes.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic separation stand to separate the SPIONs from unreacted chemicals (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/201-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Magnetic Separation and Purification of Synthesized SPIONs\nNote: For optimal magnetic separation, we recommend using the Magnetight™ Separation Stand from Novagen (Cat. No. 69964-3). Alternately, LifeSep magnetic separation stand (#Z740157) or similar can be used.\nLeave the tube undisturbed for 5–10 min.\nCritical: Smaller SPIONs tend to get attracted to the magnet instantaneously, while large particles and unreacted chemicals remain suspended.",
    "While the SPIONs remain attracted to the magnet, use a glass pipette and carefully remove large particles and unreacted chemicals that remain suspended in ethanol.\nCaution: Collect the ethanol in a separate waste container.\nNote: When repeating this step several times, instant clearing of the solvent can be observed.\nRemove the tubes from the magnetic separation stand (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and re-suspend the SPIONs in 40–50 mL absolute ethanol per tube.\nRepeat steps 19–21, 5–6 times until the ethanol appears transparent following the attraction of the SPIONs to the magnet.\nRemove the ethanol completely and re-suspend SPIONs in 20 mL of hexane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCentrifuge the tube at 4,100 × g for 10 min to remove aggregates.\nCritical: This centrifugation step is important as it removes large aggregates (if any), resulting in a homogenous SPION suspension.\nCarefully collect the supernatant containing the SPIONs and transfer it into a glass vial with a screw cap. Store at 4°C.\nCritical: While collecting the SPIONs it is important not to touch and disturb the last 1–2 mL in order to leave out the larger aggregates (if any).\nNote: The SPIONs suspended in hexane have a shelf life of about 2–3 months when stored at 4°C. However, when SPIONs have been stored for such long periods, we highly recommend repeating the quality control measures (such as concentration, size measurement) described below on a small aliquot of the stored SPIONs and ensure that the SPIONs are not prone to any aggregation/precipitation.\nMeasuring SPION Concentration\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) is used for measuring the concentration of the synthesized SPIONs. The instrument measures the mass of SPIONs over time as the temperature changes under a nitrogen atmosphere. In addition to measuring the mass concentration of SPIONs, the TGA data also provides information on the physical and chemical properties of SPIONs.\nNote: 100 μL Platinum-HT pans (#957571.901, TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) provided by the manufacturer are needed for measuring SPION concentrations. Platinum-HT pans have to be cleaned in piranha solution first, followed by flaming of the pans until it is red hot before use. These steps ensure that the pans are free of any contaminating or dust particles.\nCaution: The protocol involves high-temperature reactions. It is, therefore important to wear PPE at all times.\nPlace two clean, empty Platinum-HT pans on the carousel of the auto-sampler to measure their weights.\nPress TARE to bring the base weights to 0.\nPlace 100 μL of SPIONs suspended in hexane on each pan and wait for 3–5 min for the hexane to evaporate.\nCritical: It is important to perform the concentration measurement, at least in duplicates, to avoid variations (if any).\nHeat the pans to 80°C to remove solvent traces.\nIncrease the temperature to 850°C with a heating rate of 20°C per min.\nRecord the mass of the pans every minute until the temperature reaches 850°C.\nUse the Universal Analysis 2000, v 4.5A software provided by the manufacturer to calculate the concentration of SPIONs.\nNote: As the temperature increases, the coating surrounding the SPIONs evaporates, and the mass of iron in the pan is recorded.",
    "Alternatives: (i) Several other TGA instruments without auto-sampler are available and can be used to calculate the concentration of SPIONs. (ii) If a TGA instrument is not available or accessible, take 1 mL of SPIONs suspended in hexane on a weighing boat, evaporate the hexane completely, and measure the dry weight of the SPIONs.\nCaution: SPIONs in particulate forms are highly toxic, and therefore wearing appropriate PPE is a must.\nMeasuring SPION Size and Shape\nTiming: 2–3 h\nNote: The size and shape of newly synthesized SPIONs are crucial for proper functionalization and for subsequent effective internalization by the cells. Spherical particles have a large surface area to volume ratio, and therefore their surfaces can be utilized maximally. On the other hand, maintaining a small core size effectively retains the superparamagnetic property of the particles and aids in the internalization of the SPIONs by the cells. It is, therefore important to perform a quality check and determine the size and shape of the SPIONs following its synthesis and after functionalization.\nTransmission Electron Microscope (TEM) is used for measuring the size and shape of SPIONs.\nCaution: SPIONs in particulate forms are highly toxic, and therefore wearing appropriate PPE is a must.\nPlace a small drop of SPIONs suspended in hexane on an amorphous carbon-coated copper grid. Do this on 4–5 grids.\nWait for 5–10 min at room temperature (∼20°C) until the solvent evaporates.\nPlace the carbon-coated copper grids on the sample holder and insert it into the TEM.\nAcquire TEM images from each of the several independent grids of the same sample.\nMeasure the diameter of SPIONs from each of those grids and take an average of at least 100 particles to get an estimate of the shape and size distribution.",
    "Alternatives: Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS, also known as Photon Correlation Spectroscopy or Quasi-Elastic Light Scattering) can be used in addition or if TEM is not readily available/accessible to determine the shape, size (hydrodynamic radius) distribution of SPIONs.\nCaution: If a DLS instrument is used for determining the size distribution of SPIONs suspended in hexane, use only a glass cuvette for performing such measurements. It is important to clean the glass cuvette used for the measurement with a small volume (10 mL) of the piranha solution (as described in the section “Cleaning and preparation of glassware”) before and after the measurement. A disposable/plastic cuvette can be used for measuring the hydrodynamic radius of functionalized DMSA-coated SPIONs suspended in water.\nFunctionalization of SPIONs (Day 1)\nTiming: 3 days\nThe SPIONs synthesized using the thermal decomposition protocol have an iron core surrounded by oleic acid molecules. The oleic acid prevents the SPIONs to aggregate and renders them hydrophobic. For their use on living cells, SPIONs need to become hydrophilic. This step of SPION functionalization makes them hydrophilic and, at the same time, imparts a charge to SPIONs.\nCaution: All steps are to be carried out under a fume hood. Wearing PPE is a must.\nTake 10 mg of SPIONs resuspended in hexane and transfer to a 50 mL glass centrifuge tube.\nEvaporate the hexane completely.\nCritical: It is important to remove any traces of hexane. To fasten the evaporation, gently purge nitrogen into the tubes.\nCaution: SPIONs in particulate forms are highly toxic, and therefore wearing a PPE is a must.\nRe-suspend SPIONs in 1 mL of extra-dry toluene.\nWeigh 200 mg of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in a 15 mL Falcon tube and re-suspend it by adding 1 mL of anhydrous, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).",
    "Critical: Make sure the DMSA has completely dissolved in DMSO and that no particulates remain. Vortex vigorously to avoid the formation of clumps and to enhance the re-suspension process.\nAdd the DMSA-DMSO mixture to the glass centrifuge tube containing SPIONs resuspended in toluene.\nPlace the tube containing the reaction mixture on an orbital shaker (450 × g) placed at room temperature (∼20°C).\nLet the reagents react for 72 h.\nIncubation period: 72 h\nFunctionalization of SPIONs (Day 3)\nNote: After 72 h of shaking, two phases are formed. The top phase contains unreacted DMSA and DMSO, whereas the bottom phase contains the DMSA-coated (functionalized) SPIONs.\nCentrifuge the tube containing the reaction mixture at 4,100 × g for 10 min.\nDiscard the top phase containing unreacted DMSA and DMSO.\nCritical: Carefully collect and discard the top phase without leaving traces of the unreacted chemicals.\nRe-suspend the bottom phase containing DMSA-coated SPIONs in 2 mL of milliQ water.\nNote: As the SPIONs were in a hydrophobic environment until now, they may not re-suspend immediately. Vortex to uniformly suspend them.\nPlace an LS Column on a SuperMACS™ II Separator (magnetic field).\nAlternatives: The MidiMACS™ or QuadroMACS™ separators can be used as an alternative.\nEquilibrate the LS column by adding 1 mL of milliQ water.\nCollect and discard the flow through.\nAdd 2 mL of resuspended DMSA-coated SPIONs on top of the LS column.\nLet the SPIONs enter into the column.\nNote: The presence of trace amounts of DMSO in DMSA-coated SPIONs can clog the flow through of the column. If this occurs, pipet the SPIONs up/down in the column to ease the flow.\nCollect and discard the flow through.\nWash the column once with 1 mL of milliQ water.",
    "Remove the LS column from the SuperMACS™ II Separator and place it on a stand (away from the magnet).\nAdd 1 mL of milliQ water and insert the plunger that comes along with the LS column to force-collect the magnetically bound SPIONs.\nAdd 1 mL of milliQ water and insert the plunger to force-collect the remaining magnetically bound SPIONs.\nCentrifuge the tube containing DMSA-coated SPIONs at 4,100 × g for 10 min.\nMeasure the pH and adjust it to pH 7.0.\nNote: Following functionalization, the pH of the DMSA-coated SPIONs is acidic (usually around pH 3). Use 1 M NaOH to adjust carefully to pH 7.\nMeasure the concentration of the DMSA-coated SPIONs using TGA (as described above).\nLysosome Isolation: Part 1: Pulse-Chase Methodology\nTiming: 4–5 h\nNote: A Pulse and a Chase method is used for loading lysosomes with DMSA-SPIONs. The pulse involves the period of incubation of DMSA-coated SPIONs with the cells, while the chase period is the time taken by DMSA-coated SPIONs to reach lysosomes within the cells.\nBefore use, check the confluency and health of the cells under a bright-field microscope.\nCollect and discard cell culture media.\nAdd 5 mL of pre-warmed PBS-/- to culture dishes and swirl the plates gently. Collect and discard the PBS.\nCritical: The washing step removes cellular debris, and most of the serum present in the culture medium.\nRe-suspend the DMSA-coated SPIONs to a concentration of 200 μg per mL in a serum-free culture medium.\nCritical: The presence of serum can lead to DMSA-SPION aggregation, and therefore we recommend using a serum-free medium.\nSlowly add 5 mL of DMSA-SPION containing medium to the culture dishes.\nNote: The final amount of DMSA-SPIONs on each culture dish is therefore 1 mg.",
    "Place the culture dishes back in the incubator (37°C) for 15 min (Pulse).\nTake out, collect, and discard the DMSA-SPION containing medium.\nRepeat step 64.\nCritical: The washing step removes unbound free DMSA-SPIONs and those that are loosely hanging on the cell surface from the culture dishes.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh medium (supplemented with 10% FBS) to the culture dishes.\nPlace the culture dishes back in the incubator at 37°C for 4 h (Chase).\nCollect and discard the media.\nWash the cells three times with 5 mL of acidic buffer (0.2 M glycine; “Composition of acidic buffer”).\nNote: This washing step removes SPIONs that are bound tightly to the cell surface. However, when using neuronal cultures for lysosome isolation, this washing step might result in cell detachment and therefore, can be left out (optional).\nNote: At this point, the cells can be fixed and processed for TEM.\nPlace the culture dishes on ice and add 5 mL of ice-cold PBS-/-.\nScrape the cells and transfer them to a 15 mL Falcon tube. Use one tube for each culture dish. Centrifuge at 180 × g for 10 min (4°C).\nDiscard the supernatant and place the tube containing the cell pellets on ice.\nPart: 2 Homogenization and Magnetic Purification of Lysosomes\nTiming: 2–3 h\nNote: As the SPIONs are extremely small (∼10 nm), they exhibit superparamagnetic properties, i.e., they can be magnetized instantly by introducing a magnetic field, and this property is instantly lost upon removing the magnetic field. In this protocol, we use this superparamagnetic property to isolate and enrich for lysosomes.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold homogenizing buffer (HB; “Composition of homogenizing buffer (HB)”) to cell pellets collected from each 100 mm diameter culture dish.",
    "Note: The cell homogenizer or cell cracker has a void volume of ∼500–600 μL. Therefore for having a uniform homogenization, the cells need to be resuspended in at least 1 mL.\nRe-suspend the cell pellets and make sure that there are no clumps.\nUse 1 mL syringe to collect the cell suspension and mount the syringe to one end of the cell homogenizer placed on ice.\nCritical: Make sure the cell homogenizer is ice-cold, and joints are sealed before use. Flush the cell homogenizer a couple of times with milliQ water and two times with 1 mL of HB before passing the cell suspension through it.\nPlace an empty 1 mL syringe on the other end of the cell homogenizer.\nSlowly exert pressure on the syringe containing the cell suspension to force it through the cell homogenizer to the other syringe and back. This constitutes one passage.\nCritical: Pay attention and make sure there are no leaks.\nRepeat step 81 to a total of ten passages to ensure uniform homogenization of the cells.\nCritical: This requirement of ten passages (using a tungsten carbide ball that provides a 10-μm clearance space) to efficiently break and homogenize cells is optimized for both HeLa and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) cell types. If other cell types are used, the number of passage need to be optimized.\nCarefully remove one syringe and transfer the total cell lysate (TCL) to a fresh 15 mL Falcon tube.\nUse the other mounted syringe to collect the remaining TCL that is present in the bore of the cell homogenizer and transfer to the same Falcon tube.\nRepeat step 79–84 for the other three cell pellets.\nCentrifuge the TCL at 800 × g for 10 min (4°C).",
    "Carefully collect the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) without disturbing the pellet and pool all PNS in a fresh Falcon tube placed on ice.\nCritical: The pellet contains nuclear debris, unbroken cells, and is not firm. Disturbing the pellet will lead to contamination and will influence the final purity of lysosomes. We recommend not to take all PNS up to the pellet but discard the last millimeters of PNS above the pellet. Facultatively, the collected PNS can be centrifuged again (800 × g, 10 min, 4°C) to be sure that the PNS is free of cell debris remnants.\nNote: Steps 88–94 are to be performed at 4°C (for instance, in a cold room).\nPlace an LS Column in a SuperMACS™ II Separator (magnetic field).\nAlternatives: The MidiMACS™ or QuadroMACS™ separators can also be used.\nEquilibrate the LS column by adding 1 mL of HB. Collect and discard the flow through.\nSlowly add the PNS on top of the LS column (maximum 7 mL) and let the PNS pass through the column.\nNote: As the SPIONs taken up by the cells are superparamagnetic, they will instantly bind together with the organelle in which they are present to the column matrix in the presence of the magnetic field. The other non-magnetic portion of the PNS will flow through the column.\nCollect and discard the flow through. Wash the column once with 5 mL of HB.\nCritical: This washing step removes non-specifically bound proteins and cellular debris from the column.\nRemove the LS column from the SuperMACS™ II Separator (magnetic field) and place it on a stand (away from the magnet).\nAdd 3 mL of HB and insert the plunger that comes along with the LS column to force-collect the bound/magnetic fraction (containing the lysosomes) in a fresh Falcon tube.",
    "Repeat step 93 but with 1 mL HB, and pool with the previous 3 mL.\nTransfer the bound/magnetic fraction in a clean ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 30 min at 20,000 × gavg (4°C).\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant. The resulting pellet contains the isolated lysosomes.\nNote: The purity of the isolated lysosomal fraction can be easily assessed by semi-quantitative Western blot, comparing equal amounts of protein for PNS/TCL and isolated lysosomes. A very low percentage recovery (mostly <2%) of marker proteins for mitochondria, ER, cytosol, peroxisomes, and cytoskeletal elements underscores very low levels of contamination and, therefore, a strongly enriched lysosomal fraction. It is important that marker proteins of contaminating organelles are absent or significantly de-riched (<2%) in the lysosomal fraction prior to subsequent omics analysis.\nRe-suspend the pellet in a small volume (100–200 μL) of HB or PBS or any other mass spectrometry compatible buffers.\nNote: If the isolated lysosomes are to be used for biochemical or functional assays, re-suspend the pellets in HB. This will better preserve the intactness of the isolated lysosomes. If the isolated lysosomes are to be processed for proteomics or lipidomics analysis, re-suspend the pellets in 50 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB).\nNote: Lysosomal integrity can be assessed in different ways. For instance, (Tharkeshwar et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) measured β-hexosaminidase activity to estimate the latency (intactness) and reported that close to 70% of the magnetically isolated lysosomes remained intact. The isolated lysosomes also remained acidic, as measured with Lysotracker and underscoring a functional proton pump. For more technical details, we refer to (Tharkeshwar et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])."
