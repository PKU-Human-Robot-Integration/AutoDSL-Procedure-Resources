    "NOTE: The use of animals for the following experiments has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Preoperative Procedures\nSterilize surgical instruments before use.\n\t\nAutoclave all surgical instruments 24 hr or less before surgery. If multiple surgeries are performed on the same day, sterilize the instruments by a dry bead sterilizer in between surgeries.\nFilter-sterilize the saline solution before use.\nWeigh the rat and calculate the dose of anesthetic drugs (ketamine 80 mg/kg and xylazine 7 mg/kg).\nAdminister the anesthetic drugs intra-peritoneally (i.p.).\n\t\nVerify the adequacy of sedation by toe pinch in 5-10 min. Administer an additional small dose of drugs (ketamine 7 mg/kg and xylazine 0.6 mg/kg) if sedation is not complete.\nMake sure the needle is deep enough to delivery drugs intra-peritoneally because failure to deliver the entire drug solution into the peritoneal cavity will cause inadequate sedation.\n\t\tNOTE: Ulcers and hair loss in the skin at the injection site will be visible several days after surgery, due to inadvertent subcutaneous (s.c.) drug solution injection.\nInject 3 ml sterile saline solution subcutaneously (s.c.). Using a sterile cotton swab, apply a small amount of ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent the corneas from drying out.\nPrepare the heating equipment. Pre-warm heat pads by microwave or water bath.\nPut the animal supinely on the surgical platform.\n\t\nRemove the hair in the ventral neck region. Apply the hair remover with a cotton swab, wait 30 sec and wipe off completely with gauze.\nSwab the neck with Povidone-Iodine scrub and 70% ethanol.\nPut on personal protective equipment, including gown, hair cover, surgical mask, and glasses. Put on sterile surgical gloves at the end before handling the sterile surgical instruments and supplies.",
    "Drape the rat with a sterile surgical sheet with only the neck region exposed.\n2. Surgical Procedures\nDuring the surgical procedure, check sedation depth of animal by toe pinch in every 15 min. If animal responds to toe pinch, add additional small dose (10% of the initial dose) of ketamine and xylazine.\nDissect left common carotid artery (CCA)\n\t\nUse a scalpel to make a straight longitudinal incision in the middle of neck. The approximate length of skin incision is 1.5-2 cm, for the purpose of isolating a 1.5-2 cm portion of artery. The length may vary depends on the purpose of study.\nBluntly dissect the connective tissue from the skin. Keep the forceps tips up and make sure not to puncture the skin or the underlying tissue.\nDissect muscle layers longitudinally along the left side of trachea.\nWhen opening up the muscle layer, visualize the left CCA with the vagus nerve closely attached. Bluntly dissect alongside the left carotid artery with extreme caution to separate the vagus nerve with minimal stretching.\nDissect CCA distally till the bifurcation. Carefully dissect the bifurcation and two branches - internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA).\nKeep dissecting around the CCA, until approximately a portion of 1.5-2 cm of the artery is isolated from the surrounding tissues.\nBalloon injury\n\t\nPermanently make a ligature on the ECA at approximately 5 mm away from bifurcation. Permanently ligate the occipital branch of ECA which is close to the bifurcation of ECA and ICA. Also permanently ligate other branches, if any, locating between the bifurcation and ECA ligature – for example, the superior thyroid branch. Suture that used for all ligatures is 4-0 black silk. Clip on the proximal end of CCA and the distal end of ICA.",
    "NOTE: Now, blood flow has been stopped either permanently through ligation (on ECA) or temporarily through clipping (on CCA and ICA). Luminal contents in the bifurcation area have been isolated from the systemic circulation.\nMake an arteriotomy incision on ECA by small-micro scissors. Ensure that the incision is close to the distal suture knot. Clean blood with saline and cotton swabs.\nInsert the uninflated 2F balloon catheter into the ECA lumen. Advance the balloon catheter proximally to the CCA lumen. Keep advancing the catheter proximally until its tip reaches where the clip stays.\nConnect the balloon inflation device to a female luer lock on a 3-way stopcock and connect the male luer lock of the 3-way stopcock to the balloon catheter.\nSlowly inflate the balloon with approximately 1.5 atm pressure, in order to distend the carotid artery to 1.5-fold of the diameter.\nGently pull the balloon rotationally back to the bifurcation.\nDeflate the balloon and advance it back to the proximal end. Inflate it again and repeat the pulling-back procedure two more times.\nWithdraw the balloon catheter from the artery lumen.\nIntraluminal administration of reagents (e.g., siRNA, drugs)\n\tNOTE: Here, the reagent used was a solution containing lentiviral particles encoding either shRNA targeting Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1) or non-targeting shRNA control. STIM1 is a single transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is an ER Ca2+ sensor controlling the activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels and is up-regulated during vascular smooth muscle dedifferentiation into a proliferative migratory phenotype12,30-33.\n\t\nAttach an intravascular over-the-needle catheter to a syringe (24 G, 1.6 cm). Aspirate 30 µl solution of the testing reagents. Insert the catheter into the same incision on ECA.",
    "Advance the catheter tip into the CCA and tie a piece of suture with a single knot on the ECA to fix the catheter and close the incision temporarily.\nInject the testing reagent solution into the lumen of CCA. Keep the solution in the vessel lumen for 30 min. Keep the exposed tissue moist with saline and cover it with a piece of wet gauze.\nAfter incubation, aspirate the remaining solution. Loosen that single knot and withdraw the catheter.\nTie the ECA with a piece of suture proximally to the arteriotomy incision. Make the knot as close as possible to the bifurcation.\nClose up the wound.\n\t\nSince the balloon injury and catheter introduction may cause a leak or puncture of the blood vessel, remove the clip on the ICA and check if there is any leak. If bleeding is observed, apply a piece of gauze and apply gentle pressure to stop bleeding.\nRemove the other clip on CCA.\nMake sure there are no signs of bleeding, and then remove all clamps and other surgical instruments. Cut off excess sutures.\nClose wound using skin sutures (4-0 black silk). Swab on all sides of the closed wound with the Povidon-Iodine or other anti-septic/bactericide/virucide agent. Inject 3 ml of sterile saline s.c.\n3. Postoperative Procedures\nKeep rat on heat pad after surgery. Administer one dose of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine via intramuscular injection (i.m.) to the rat. During the recovery procedure, keep animals’ eyes and mouth moist. Monitor the animal until it is awake and ambulant.\nPlace the animal in a clean cage without any bedding until it is fully recovered. After recovery, the animal will be returned to the animal room and housed individually.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
