    "Preparation of mouse liver non-parenchymal cell fraction\n1. Sacrifice mouse\n  2. In vivo perfusion with 5-10 ml of PBS from the IVC follows by 5-10ml of Liver Digest Medium \\(Gibco)\n  3. Harvest the liver without including the gall bladder and transfer to a tube with \\(Williams’E medium + 10% FCS).\n  4. Cut the liver into fine pieces and incubate in Liver Digest Medium at 37C for 20 mins \n  5. Mesh the liver more either with mechanical chopping with a scalpel or Miltenyi GentleMACS.\n  6. Pass the mesh through 100um cell strainer and then top up with 25ml of Williams’E medium + 10% FCS\n  7. Spin tubes at 50G for 5 mins with acceleration =4 deceleration=4\n  8. Transfer supernatant to a new 50 ml falcon while passing through a 40um strainer, discard the pellet.\n  9. Spin tubes at 50G for 5 mins with acceleration =4 deceleration=4\n  10. Transfer supernatant to a new 50 ml falcon while passing through a 40um strainer, discard the pellet.\n  11. Spin tubes at 300G for 5 mins with max acceleration max deceleration\n  12. Keep pellet, discard supernatant\n  13. Incubate with red cell lysis buffer for 2 mins on ice.\n  14. Wash with 10 ml of PBS at 300G\n  15. Spin tubes at 300G for 5 mins with max acceleration max deceleration\n  16. The resulting pellet will be the non-parenchymal fraction of the liver. Can either plate or continue with FACS.\n  \nFACS of mouse liver non-parenchymal cell fraction\n1. Block with either Fc Block or neat FCS for 10 mins at room temperature\n  2. Spin at 300G for 5 mins, discard supernatant\n  3. Incubate with antibody mix for 30mins – 1 hour on ice. ~50-100 ul per sample\n  \nAntibody Mix\nManufacturer Antibody Clone Dilution\neBiosciences CD45 PE 30-F11 1/100\neBiosciences CD31 PE 390 1/100",

Spin at 300G for 5 mins,  discard supernatant.\n  6. Resuspend samples in 300ul of FACS buffer and transfer to FACS tube with 40um cell strainer cap and sort for CD45-/CD31-/Ter119-/EpCAM+/CD24+/CD133+\n  7. Before sorting, add life dead marker to exclude dead cells, DAPI/7AAD\n  \nCulturing mouse liver NPCs / HPCs\n1. Coat plates with 1 mg/ml Rat Tail Collagen 1 \\(Sigma)\n  2. Leave in incubator for approximately 4 hours to dry\n  3. Plate cells with liver expansion medium\n  \nHPCs Expansion Medium Recipe \\(Williams’ E + 10% FCS) \nChemicals required Stock concentration Dilution Preparation\n17.6 mM NaHCO3 \n20mM HEPES pH 7.5 \n10 mM Nicotinamide \n1mM Sodium Pyruvate \n1X ITS \n100nM Dexamethasone\n0.2 mM Ascorbic Acid \n14mM glucose 1.4 M\n10ng/mL IL-6 10 ug/mL \n10ng/mL HGF 20ug/mL\n10ng/mL EGF 100ug/mL \n   \n4. Wait for colony to form\n  5. After colony formation, change medium every 2-3 days\n  6. Try and prepare medium relatively fresh, in 5ml aliquots \\(or smaller)\n  \nPassaging primary mouse HPCs\n1. Incubate with diluted trypsin until cells start to detach \\(might take a while)\n  2. Flush colony with Williams’E +  10%FCS\n  3. Collect cells and spin at 300G for 5 mins.\n  4. Replate cells on collagen coated plates\n  \nDiluted Trypsin \\(Tsuchiya et al, Gastroenterology 2005):\n0.25% Trypsin no EDTA\n20% Knockout Serum Replacement\n1mM CaCl2"
