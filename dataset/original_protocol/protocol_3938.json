    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRetroviral virus production\nTiming: 4 days\nPlat-E cells were transfected with a DNA plasmid to produce the retroviral particles\nDay 1: Plat - E seeding\nBefore starting, ensure you have enough plasmid for transfection, step 8.\nCoat 10 cm plates by adding 5 mL of 50 μg/mL poly-D-lysine in sterile water. Incubate at 22°C for 45 min. Wash twice with sterile water to ensure no residues remain.\nDetach Plat-E cells, previously cultured in Plat-E medium in a 75 cm2 flask. First, aspirate the culture medium and carefully add 2 mL pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA 0.05%. Incubate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing incubator until the cells are detached, 3–5 min. Wash flask out with 8 mL medium and collect the supernatant in a 15 mL conical tube. Wash cells twice by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min and replacing the supernatant with fresh medium.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nSeed Plat-E cells in the coated plates, 3 × 106 cells per plate.\nIncubate for 16 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing incubator.\nDay 2: Transfection of Plat-E cells\nOnce Plat-E cells are 85%–90% confluent, replace the medium with 10 mL DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin.\nPrepare the materials for transfection by adding the required volume of DMEM, without supplements, to each 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. In one tube add 15 μg of the DNA plasmid [in this case pMP71Gpre GFP (Engels et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])] and in the other tube add 45 μL Lipofectamine.\nNote: The final volume in each Eppendorf tube should be 250 μL.\nNote: The concentration of the plasmid is checked prior to transfection.",
    "Transfer the diluted Lipofectamine to the diluted DNA solution and immediately pipette up and down 3–4 times.\nIncubate at 22°C for 20 min to allow Lipofectamine/DNA complexes to form.\nAfter 20 min, mix well and add (dropwise) to the Plat-E plates.\nGently swirl the plate and incubate for 16 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 containing incubator.\nReplace the medium with DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin.\nIsolation and activation of CD4 T cells\nTiming: 1 day\nCD4 T cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice spleens and subsequently activated with Dynabeads™ Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28\nDay 3: Isolation of CD4 T cells from mouse spleens and activation with Dynabeads™ Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28\nCheck the fluorescence of the transfected Plat-E cells to determine transfection efficiency.\nThe day after transfection, sacrifice male or female C57BL/6 mice, aged 8–12 weeks, with an overdose of isoflurane and harvest the spleens. Collect the spleens to a 10 cm petri-dish filled with 5 mL HBSS.\nIn a BSC2 hood, wash the spleens in 5 mL HBSS in a 10 cm plate.\nTransfer the washed spleens to a 70 μm cell strainer, placed within a 10 cm plate, with 4 mL HBSS, and using the ridged side of a 3 mL syringe plunger mash the spleens through the cell strainer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Rinse with 10 mL HBSS and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/906-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of the retroviral transduction protocol\nStep 1: CD4 T cells are isolated from spleens of C57BL/6 mice; Step 2: The retroviral particles are produced using the Plat-E packaging cell line; and Step 3: The CD4 T cells are transduced with the retrovirus.\nNote: You will get approximately 80 × 106 leukocytes per spleen.",
    "Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the HBSS and add 300 μL ACK lysing buffer per spleen. Gently mix with the pellet and incubate for 1 min at 22°C. Next, add 10 mL HBSS and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. If the pellet remains red after centrifugation, remove the HBSS and add 150 μL ACK lysing buffer per spleen and incubate at 22°C for 45 s. Next, add 10 mL HBSS and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the HBSS and wash twice by adding 10 mL HBSS and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nIsolate CD4 T cells using the EasySep™ Mouse CD4 T Cell Isolation Kit as per manufacturer's instructions.\nNote: You will get approximately 10% CD4 T cells from the total splenocytes.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and bring to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per mL in complete RMPI medium.\nActivate the cells with Dynabeads™ Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28.\nFirst, wash the Dynabeads™ in preparation for use, as follows; Transfer the required volume of Dynabeads™ to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and add an equal volume of washing buffer [PBS supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4], or at least 1 mL, and pipette five times. Place the Eppendorf on the DynaMag™ Magnet for 1 min and remove the supernatant. Remove the Eppendorf from the DynaMag™ Magnet and suspend the Dynabeads™ in the same volume of culture medium as the initial volume of Dynabeads™ taken. Add 25 μL of Dynabeads™ per 1 × 106 CD4 T cells.",
    "Seed 1 × 106 cells per well in a 24 well plate and incubate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing incubator for 16–18 h.\nRetroviral transduction of CD4 T cells\nTiming: 8 h\nCD4 T cells were retrovirally transduced with the viral supernatant\nDay 4: Transduction of CD4 T cells\nCoat non-treated 24-well plates with 350 μL per well of PBS containing 20 μg/mL RetroNectin®.\nPause point: The RetroNectin® coated plates can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nIncubate plates for 2 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing incubator.\nDuring the incubation, harvest the viral supernatant from the transfected Plat-E cells and centrifuge at 800 × g for 10 min. Filtrate through a 0.45 μm filter.\nPause point: The viral supernatant can be stored at 4°C for up to 3 days.\nReplace with 500 μL per well of PBS supplemented with 2% (w/v) BSA. Incubate at 20°C–22°C for 30 min. Wash twice with PBS.\nCaution: Ensure BSA is properly washed from the plate by first removing all of the BSA from each well and then washing the wells twice with 1 mL of PBS. Finally ensure all liquid is removed from the wells.\nRemove the PBS from the washed plates and add 1 mL of the viral supernatant per well.\nWrap the plates with plastic wrap and centrifuge at 2000 × g for 4 h at 32°C.\nTwo hours prior to the end of centrifugation, add 80 international units (IU)/mL of recombinant IL-2 to the CD4 T cells.\nAfter 2 h, collect the cells to 15 mL conical tubes and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. Collect the supernatant and store at 22°C, for not more than 1 h, for use in step 34.\nRemove the Dynabeads™ using a DynaMag™ Magnet.",
    "Suspend the cells in the collected supernatant.\nRemove the viral supernatant from the plate and add 1 mL of the CD4 T cell suspension per well, i.e., 1 × 106 cells per well.\nRe-wrap the plate in the plastic wrap and centrifuge at 800 × g for 30 min at 32°C.\nRemove the plastic wrap and store at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing incubator.\nCulture and expansion of transduced CD4 T cells\nTiming: 10–14 days\nThe transduced CD4 T cells were expanded in culture in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 20 IU of IL-2 and 10 ng/mL IL-7.\nDay 6: Treatment of transduced cells\nAfter 48 h, remove 500 μL from each well and add 500 μL complete RPMI medium supplemented with 20 IU of IL-2 and 10 ng/mL IL-7.\nDay 7: Cell sorting of transduced cells\n72 h post transduction, collect the cells and sort for the positive population using the 70 μm nozzle of the FACSAriaTM III Cell Sorter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/906-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative flow cytometry plots outlining the sorting of the transduced GFP-positive CD4 T cells\nPlots (left to right) show the percentage of lymphocytes, gating on single cells and the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of GFP-positive cells\nNote: Use medium for cell sorting.\nNote: The timing of cell sorting can vary but should take place more than 5 days post transduction. It is important to check the fluorescence of the cells before cell sorting.\nSeed sorted cells, 1 × 106 cells per well, in a 24-well plate in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 20 IU of IL-2 and 10 ng/mL IL-7.\nDay 9: Activation of sorted cells\n48 h post cell sorting, activate the cells with Dynabeads™ Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28 in complete RPMI medium, as described in step 23.\nDay 11: Treatment of cells",
    "48 h post cell activation, remove 500 μL of the medium and replace with 500 μL of complete RPMI supplemented with 20 IU of IL-2 and 10 ng/mL IL-7.\nNote: In order to optimize the protocol and enhance the proliferation and survival of the transduced cells, 10 ng/mL IL-7 was added to the standard RPMI medium supplemented with 20 IU of IL-2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nEvery 2 days, while cells are proliferating, carefully pipette and split one well to two. Add 500 μL of fresh complete RPMI supplemented with 20 IU of IL-2 and 10 ng/mL IL-7.\nOnce the cells are resting, replace half of the medium with fresh medium every second day.\nActivate cells with Dynabeads™ every 7–10 days, as required.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/906-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Proliferation of retroviral-transduced CD4 T cells in the presence of IL2-/IL-7 medium\nCD4 GFP T cells were seeded in a 24 well plate (0.5 × 106 cells per well) in RPMI medium supplemented with either 20 IU IL-2 and 10 ng/mL IL-7 or the control 20 IU RPMI. Cells were counted every two days post activation with Dynabeads™. Each condition had four wells per experiment and the experiment was repeated three times. Error bars represent mean ± SEM."
