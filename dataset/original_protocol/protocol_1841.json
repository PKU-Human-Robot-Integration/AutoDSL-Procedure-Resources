Schematic of glue pipette\n(A–C) Glass needle; (B) yellow pipette tip; (C) hollow tube.\nCarefully break the needle tip at the edge of the square glass to a worm body size opening. The diameter of the needle tip in our experiment was 10 μm.\nPlace the sterilized yellow pipette tip on the lip to carefully pump the glue (GLUture®).\nInsert needle tip in the glue.\nPump the glue slowly to 1/8th of the tip of the needle.\nCritical: When sucking the glue, one should constantly watch the needle tip under the microscope to avoid overflow of glue in the needle.\nApproach I: Odorant/chemical stimuli for glial Ca2+ imaging\nTiming: 15–20 min\nDrop 20–40 μL bath solution in the middle of a 22∗22 mm square cover glass (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]Ab).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1434-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Chemical stimuli set up\n(A and B) A a. 3D printed circular chamber; b. square glass; (B) a worm adhered for chemical stimuli experiment.\nTransfer one worm gently using a worm picker from OP50 plate to the bath solution.",
    "Note: If the worm to be glued is dirty (before transferring to bath solution), relocate to a clean NGM plate without OP50 bacteria and drop 5–10 μL bath solution to wash. Then the worm can be moved back to the square glass to be glued.\nStabilize the worm on the square glass with the glue using the glue pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: Worms should be treated gently and smoothly. The nose of the worm should not be immersed in the glue at any cost, otherwise steps 8–10 should be repeated (practice is required to master these steps). The stabilized part of the worm is decided by the location of the target glia. In the case of AMsh glia, the amphid of worm should be fixed to the square glass, and a small amount of glue is used to cement the tail to avoid movement interference (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Appropriate amount of glue is required; too much would result in death of the worm and too little would allow the worm to move and interfere with the experiment.\nWait for 10 min (more or less).\nCritical: There might be some interference when the worms are glued to the square glass. The worm especially its nervous system need time to be at rest before any experiment.\nMount the square glass to the bottom of the circular chamber with Vaseline.\nNote: Vaseline should be used appropriately not to stick the circular chamber. Vaseline is used as a thin protective layer to avoid friction between the circular chamber and the square glass.\nPlace the prepared chamber on the platform of an inverted microscope and focus on the target glia labeled with fluorescence protein and genetically encoded calcium indicators like GCaMP5.0 in this study.",
    "Use the fluid system (MPS-2 Multichannel Perfusion system) to add odorants and chemicals which are mixed with bath solution at appropriate concentration at 0.2 mL/s flow rate (Calculated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation from the instruction manual of MPS-2 Multichannel perfusion system).\nKeep the pump active all the time to remove bath solution or Isoamyl alcohol (IAA) from the chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). IAA is used in this study as an odorant to activate the nematode’s glia.\nCritical: The fluid system allows easy switch from bath solution to chemicals. The fluid switch time is crucial in the experiment and the pump should be active before the recording starts.\nAcquire images using CCD camera.\nRecord the glial calcium responses every second using the Micro-Manager software (Vale Lab, UCSF) at 0–30 s of bath solution application then 60 s of IAA and finally wash with bath solution for 110 s.\nAfter the recording is completed, remove the square glass, transfer a new worm and repeat.\nUse image-J to analyze the calcium imaging data.\nApproach II: Mechanical stimuli\nTiming: 15–20 min\nSet the amplifier to give a pulse at a specific time point. The piezoelectric actuator can transform 1 volt pulse to 4.5 μm mechanical stimuli (Fan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDrop 20–40 μL bath solution in the middle of the prepared sylgard round coverslip.\nTransfer one worm from the NGM plate to bath solution.\nStabilize one side of the worm (Ventral or Dorsal) with the glue (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1434-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Physical stimuli set up\n(A and B) A a. coverslip; b. 3D printed square chamber; (B) a worm adhered for physical stimuli experiment.",
    "Critical: Delicate manipulations are recommended to stabilize worms under the objective lens. The worm’s nose should not be submerged in glue, as it would prevent the worm from mechanical stimuli. Stick one side of the worm to expose specific area to provide stimuli (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). In this study, we exposed the nose where the dendrites of AMsh glia can be stimulated by mechanical touch (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nWait for 10 min (more or less).\nInsert the coverslip into the square chamber filled with bath solution (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: Vaseline is not required in this part as square chamber is filled with bath solution so that the coverslip is fully immersed, leaving no bubbles.\nPosition the head of the worm (target area) toward the touch needle by moving either the coverslip or square chamber (Adjust the worm’s head adjacent to the piezo-driven needle).\nPlace the prepared chamber on the platform of the microscope and focus on the target glia. (The chamber can be taped on both sides to the platform to avoid movement).\nOperate the objective lens and touch needle side by side carefully; the touch needle should always be observed under the microscope. The touch needle tip should be very close to the head of the worm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), but should not touch or press it before the experiment starts.\nCritical: The touch needle should be operated very carefully since the piezoelectric actuator is fragile and the needle can easily be broken when in contact to the bottom of the chamber. The touch needle should not be sharp as it will pierce the worm’s body instead of providing touch stimuli.",
    "Acquire images using a CCD camera. Start recording using the Micro-Manager software, and provide mechanical stimuli though the HEKA EPC-10 amplifier and piezoelectric actuator at a time point of 20 s or 30 s.\nNote: Activation of the glia by mechanical stimuli can be observed (Arrowhead denote touch stimuli at 30 s; Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]; Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nMove the microscope and the touch needle out of the bath solution.\nRepeat with a new coverslip.\nUse image-J to analyze the calcium imaging data.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Activation of AMsh glia by 15 μm touch stimuli (arrowhead denotes touch stimuli), related to step 28 in mechanical stimuli\nApproach III: Optogenetics\nTiming: 15–20 min\nNote: For optogenetic experiments, worms are cultured on OP50- All-trans retinal (ATR) plates at 20°C for two generations prior to assays. The chromophore all-trans retinal is light-sensitive, so ATR-supplemented NGM plates need to be wrapped in aluminum foil.\nAdhere the CoChR-transgenic worm which is fed with or without ATR (control) on the square glass using the glue pipette to stabilize the worm.\nWait for 10 min (more or less).\nPlace the prepared chamber on the platform of the microscope and focus on the target glia.\nReset the exposure time and the interval time to try different stimulation frequency, which is very important to activate glial responses. The interval time was set at 100 ms and the frequency adjusted to 5 Hz (460–480 nm). The exposure time should not be longer than the interval time.\nNote: Glia may not be easy to activate if the blue light is kept always on. Under 5Hz blue light, activated glial cells have Ca2+ responses (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Some glial cells have different activation frequency so a range of frequencies can be tested.",
    "After 5 min activation, then start the recording of ASH neurons fluorescence intensity under 1 % IAA stimuli (Similar to Step 13-16 odorant/chemical stimulation).\nNote: We used the lite-1 mutant background strain with CoChR expression in glia like in the Pvap-1::frt2::CoChR::sl2::TagRFP strain. Without ATR, the glial cells cannot be activated. We activated the AMsh glia and recorded the ASH neurons' activities under chemical stimuli as an example (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Previously, we showed that when the AMsh glia are activated, the ASH neuronal response to 1% IAA will be inhibited (Duan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). This model is used to study the functions of glial cells. Step 36 is not required to activate and record AMsh glial calcium signals.\nAcquire the image.\nUse image-J to analyze the calcium imaging data.\nNote: The Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] is to show that AMsh glia with CoChR expression can be activated by 5 Hz blue light, but it is not suitable for statistical analysis of calcium increases in AMsh glia due to similar baselines of GCaMP and CoChR. To activate and record AMsh glia calcium signals at the same time; mCherry, RCaMP, Cameleon, Chrimson or others are recommended instead of GCaMP and CoChR together (Kerr, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Schild and Glauser, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nImage acquisition\nTiming: 5–10 min\nRaw images were acquired by a QImaging optiMOS™ Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) or CCD camera under the control of the Micro-Manager software.\nCritical: The exposure time should not be longer than the interval time. In this study, the exposure time was 100 ms and the interval time was 1 s. The interval time should be between 0.2-1 s. If the time is too long then some small and quick Ca2+ signals can be missed; too short will require enough space to store the data."
