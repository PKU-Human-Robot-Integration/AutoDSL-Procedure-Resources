    "Throughout testing, continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is paramount. This ensures subject safety, and prompt termination of the test with the onset of presyncope. Beat-to-beat blood pressure recordings can be obtained through arterial catheterization, or finger plethysmography31-33. The latter is used in this protocol because it is non-invasive and can assess the onset of presyncope with the same accuracy as catherization31,34, without the detrimental impact of invasive monitoring on OT1. Using the Modelflow technique changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance can be derived from the finger arterial pressure waveform35,36. Additional noninvasive measures that may aid the haemodynamic evaluation can also be conducted, and will be described here. Continuous end tidal oxygen (PETO2) and carbon dioxide (PETCO2) monitoring using a nasal cannula allows the evaluation of any contribution of hyperventilation to the subject's symptoms. Finally, monitoring both brachial and cerebral blood flow velocities using Doppler ultrasound can be undertaken to allow the determination of peripheral and cerebral vascular responses to orthostasis. In addition, measurements of venous pooling and capillary filtration could also be obtained using impedance plethysmography20. Ultimately, this protocol allows assessment of postural cardiovascular reflex control in a controlled and reproducible setting.\n1. Equipment\nThe manually adjustable tilt table is capable of moving from -15 to 60 ° in 10 ° increments (Figure 1). It includes an adjustable right-arm rest with an adjustable holder for a brachial ultrasound probe (Figure 1D), an adjustable footplate for the subject to stand on, and a seat belt to secure the subject's legs (Figure 1E).",
    "An LBNP chamber with an attached pressure gauge fits in a wooden groove filled with neoprene onto the bottom half of the tilt table and is secured in place by four adjustable straps (Figure 1). A clear Plexiglas material can be employed for the chamber if desired, to enable visualization of the subjects' legs, and thus visual monitoring of any skeletal muscle pumping activity.\nA wooden waist board is attached to the top of the chamber with a neoprene surround at the level of the subject's iliac crest to provide an air-tight seal with the chamber (Figure 1B). The level of the iliac crest is chosen because it avoids the application of LBNP to the abdomen, which can be uncomfortable, but ensures a standardized stimulus for individuals of different statures.\nPerform continuous beat-to-beat data acquisition with a sampling frequency of 1 KHz using an analog-to-digital converter. Visualize all data simultaneously in real time throughout testing using LabChart (Powerlab 16/30, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO).\nConduct testing in a temperature-controlled room (20-22 °C) to avoid the known effect of heat stress upon OT37. Tests are ideally conducted in the mornings because of the effect of diurnal rhythms on baroreflex control38. In some cases, a familiarization session is advised to minimize the influence of a \"stress response\" on the procedure.\nInstruct subjects to have only a light breakfast, to minimize possible confounders due to post-prandial hypotension, and to avoid caffeine and strenuous exercise on the morning of testing. Subjects should fast for 2 hr prior to testing. They should also abstain from drinking alcohol for 24 hr prior to testing, to eliminate the diuretic effect of alcohol and consequent reductions in plasma volume, which are known to reduce OT39.",
    "Figure 2 outlines the protocol. Stand the subject on the table foot plate and move them into a supine position (Figure 1). Once supine, align the iliac crest with the center of the table. This allows for ease of tilting, and ensures standardized positioning of the LBNP chamber. Adjust the footplate accordingly. A foot plate support is preferred because tables with saddle supports are associated with increased false positive responses, probably due to excess compression of leg and pelvic veins6.\nLoosley position a strap just above the knee to promote passive standing and provide postural support. Instruct subjects not to move their legs during testing. Position the subject's right arm on the arm rest, adjusted so that it is comfortably supported at heart level. Attach monitoring equipment.\nConduct beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring using the Finometer, according to the manufacturer's instructions40. Chose the finger cuff that fits appropriately onto the middle phalanx of the subject's right middle finger. Use a brachial cuff to internally calibrate the Finometer prior to data collection. Enter the subject's sex, age, height and weight into the Finometer to enable appropriate assumptions for the Modelflow algorithms35,36.\nContinuous ECG monitoring is important for the accurate determination of heart rate responses, and prompt identification of any cardiac arrhythmia, should they occur. Apply ECG electrodes in a modified lead II configuration, ensuring that the electrode sites do not interfere with positioning of the neoprene waist board.",
    "Determine peripheral vascular responses using Doppler ultrasound of the brachial artery of the right arm supported at heart level (to avoid the influence of hydrostatic pressure changes on blood pressure and velocity in the arm). Palpate the artery until the pulse is located. Apply ultrasound gel to this area and position an 8 MHz ultrasound probe so that a brachial artery velocity waveform is obtained (Figures 3A,B).\nOnce the signal is identified, optimize the depth and gain, and tighten the adjustable holder to keep the angle of insonation constant for the duration of the test (Figure 3B). This is important because, according to the Doppler shift equation, changes in velocity will be proportional to changes in flow if the angle of insonation and arterial diameter are constant19,21.\nDetermine cerebral vascular responses similarly (Figures 4A,B). Secure the cerebral ultrasound probe (2 MHz) in place using a plastic headset or fabric headbands (Figure 4B) to ensure faithful signal detection and a constant angle of insonation throughout testing.\nDetermine blood velocity continuously from the middle cerebral artery. This vessel is chosen because of its convenience of identification, large contribution to global cerebral perfusion, and constant diameter during orthostatic stress41, ensuring changes in velocity are proportional to changes in flow. Apply ultrasound gel to the subject's temple and locate the vessel (Figure 4A). Once identified, optimize the depth and gain settings.\nAttach the nasal cannula. Nasal sampling is preferred because it permits the subject to talk freely during testing (unlike with use of a mouthpiece). This is important to enable self-report and recognition of symptoms, while avoiding invasive blood sampling that may adversely impact OT. However, during speech, or when the subject is breathing through their mouth, accuracy of these readings may be affected. Encourage subjects to breathe through their nose.",
    "Place the LBNP chamber on the table and secure with the straps. Select a waist board that fits snugly so that an airtight seal with the neoprene can be achieved (Figure 1B). The wooden component of the waist board should not be touching the subject. Secure the waist board to the chamber. Connect the chamber to a negative pressure source, via a variable resistor (Figure 1C).\n2. Data Collection\nRecord data for 20 min in the supine position. Shorter rest periods are associated with greater falls in blood pressure when upright, presumably because the reabsorption of any fluid that has collected in the dependent limbs prior to lying down is not yet complete20.\nAt the end of the supine phase maneuver the table to a tilt angle of 60 °. This angle is preferred because it affords nearly 90% of the maximal vertical displacement, while allowing the subject to remain relaxed and supported against the tilt table (minimizing the confounding effect of skeletal muscle pumping activity with higher tilt angles). Less steep angles may increase the false negative rate; although the physiological effects of tilting are similar for angles ≥60 °, higher tilt angles are associated with a reduction in specificity6.\nComplete the transition to upright within thirty seconds. The transition time is not known to affect OT and it is more pleasant for the subject if tilting is not excessively rapid. However, very slow tilt maneuvers may be associated with lower activation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity and should be avoided42.",
    "Continuously monitor the subject's cardiovascular parameters as well as their subjective experience. The test should be stopped immediately, and the subject returned to a supine position, if any of the following end-point criteria are met: blood pressure is 80 mmHg or below; heart rate is lower than 50 beats per minute (bpm) or higher than 170 bpm; and the subject experiences symptoms such as dizziness, warmth, and requests to stop; or the protocol is completed.\nUnless there is a specific desire to initiate syncope, terminate the test rapidly at the onset of presyncopal signs and symptoms, avoiding frank syncope.\nAfter 20 min of tilting apply LBNP, while still tilted, at -20 mmHg for a further 10 min. It is important to inform the subject of the impending onset of LBNP to prevent a startle response to the sensation and sound of the LBNP.\nAfter 10 min, increase the LBNP to -40 mmHg for another 10 min.\nAfter 10 min, increase the LBNP to -60 mmHg and continue for another 10 min. At the end of this phase, turn off the LBNP and return the subject to the supine position.\nIt is theoretically possible to increase the vacuum source to achieve -80 mmHg LBNP if a presyncopal end-point is not reached at the end of this phase. However, in practice this high level of LBNP is uncomfortable for the subject, and presyncope usually occurs at much lower levels of orthostatic stress, even in healthy controls. The largest OT we have recorded was 50 min (the end of -60 mmHg) and this was in a Peruvian high altitude resident with Chronic Mountain Sickness and an extremely high blood volume43.\nOT is defined as the time to presyncope in minutes from the onset of the head-up tilting phase.",
    "To ensure the rapid termination of symptoms and signs of presyncope, and so to minimize the likelihood of syncope or asystole, a rapid return to supine is desired (ideally ~1 sec). For this reason, a manual tilt table may be preferred to an autonomic one, which may not have the capability for such rapid transitions. Returning the table to a slightly head-down position (-15 °) may promote faster resolution of the presyncopal event. Once all variables have returned to the supine levels and any symptoms are resolved, remove the monitoring equipment.\nAfter removing the LBNP chamber, remove the strap over the subject's legs and lower the footplate to its original position. Ensure the subject is positioned with their feet on the plate.\nBefore returning the table to an upright position, instruct the subject to tense their leg muscles throughout the transition to avoid any symptoms from reoccurring as the table is tilted to facilitate them getting off44,45. Ask the subject to sit after stepping off the table to ensure they are symptom-free before leaving the laboratory.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
