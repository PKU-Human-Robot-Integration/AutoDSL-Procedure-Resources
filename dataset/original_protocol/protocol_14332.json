    "Procedures presented in this protocol have been approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. The serial reference number of the approval is IAEC#319/13. \nNote: There are excellent resources on general surgery procedures20 and specific protocols for rodent surgery21. For those doing animal surgery for the first time, it is recommended to extensively practice surgical procedures on dummies before operating on animals.\n1. Preparation\nPrior to experiment, keep sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or saline ready.\nAssemble a surgery kit containing scissors, serrated forceps, tissue forceps, cotton, cotton buds, nylon threads, and different micro needle holders. Autoclave the surgery kit. Special care should be taken if an immune-compromised NOD.SCID mouse is included in the protocol.\nPerform the complete experimental procedure, from the preparation to the end of surgery, in the bio-safety class I cabinet.\nWeigh a NOD.SCID mouse of 6-8 weeks old prior to the surgery. Mice weighing between 14-18 g are used in this study.\nShave the upper central and hypochondriac abdominal region of the mouse with the hair trimmer. Apply hair removing cream evenly throughout the region with a spatula to completely remove the trimmed hairs. Remove the hairs gently with the help of a piece of wet sterile cotton after 2-5 min.\nPlace the mouse in the isoflurane chamber and unlock the valve of the oxygen cylinder. Maintain the oxygen flow at the rate of 4 L/min and the isoflurane vaporization at 4% to induce anesthesia.\n\t\nEnsure that the mouse has been anesthetized properly by gentle toe pinching.",
    "Place a surgery board inside a biosafety cabinet. Place the animal on the surgery board, such that the ventral portion of the mouse is facing up and the anterior portion of the mouse is placed inside the nose cone connected to the isoflurane and oxygen supply.\nReduce the isoflurane vaporization to 2%, and maintain it throughout the surgical procedure.\nDisinfect the skin of the mouse and sterilize it by wiping with 70% ethanol soaked sterile cotton.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nPartial Hepatectomy\nMake a transverse incision of around 1 cm in the skin just beneath the sternum, perpendicular to the xiphoid process and parallel to the ribcage, with the help of straight operating scissors.\nGently separate the skin attached with the abdominal muscle layer in the vicinity of the incised area with forceps or sterile moistened cotton tips to distinguish between skin and abdominal muscle layer. Soak the intradermal region with PBS using sterile cotton tips to evade desiccation.\nExpose the area of the left lobe smoothly by making a transverse incision through the peritoneal layer just beneath the xiphoid. Use two moistened cotton tips to expose and lift the left lobe of the liver.\nPlace one of the cotton tips on the abdominal side of the cut, and place another cotton tip on the diaphragm side. Gently press the tip placed towards the diaphragm, and give a sliding push by the other tip to lift the left lobe of the liver.\nSlip a nylon thread with a loop through the lifted left lobe, and slide the loop towards the base of the left lobe close to the hilum with the help of the micro-forceps or cotton tips. Gently push down the nylon thread loop to the base of the left lobe.",
    "Tie two ends of the nylon thread over the top of the left lobe using a microsurgery needle holder and the micro forceps. Make two additional knots on the other side.\nDissect out the tied lobe with the help of scissors. Do not attempt to cut very close to the thread. In case the procedure lasts more than 5 min, keep the peritoneal cavity and organs moist with sterile PBS to avoid desiccation due to fluid loss.\nSew the peritoneum by continuous suturing using a 4-0 Catgut suture. Subsequently, close the skin by discontinuous suturing as quickly as possible.\nCell Transplantation\n\tNote: The GFP expressing hepatocytes were isolated from transgenic GFP mice (C57BL/6-Tg (UBC-GFP) 30 Scha/J), according to the procedure described by Lee et al.22 and Shen et al.23 Hepatocyte-like cells (NeoHep) of human origin differentiated from monocytes24 were also used for transplantation. However, cells derived from any other sources may also be used in the protocol.\n\t\nSuspend 0.2 million viable cells in around 50 µL of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), and aspirate it in a 1 mL insulin syringe capped with 30G needle. Keep the syringe cold by placing it on ice.\nPlace the mouse in a way that the left lateral portion faces up toward the person performing surgery. Identify the splenic area and transversely dissect the skin near the hypochondriac region, followed by a short incision through the peritoneal layer just to expose the spleen.\nGently lift the spleen and hold it outside the cavity with the help of two PBS moistened cotton tips.",
    "Hold the spleen carefully with two cotton tips in one hand, and place the needle of the syringe exactly vertical to the spleen. Gently pierce the spleen and push the needle very slowly inside; the needle should not get deeper than 2 mm.\nPush down the piston of the syringe slowly to inject the cells into the spleen. After transplantation, keep the needle of the syringe stable and remove it slowly from the spleen to avoid bleeding or loss of cells.\nAfter placing the spleen back into the peritoneal cavity with the cotton tips, close the peritoneal layer by continuous suturing with a 4-0 Catgut suture. Sew the skin discontinuously with the same suture. Avoid using wound clips for closing skin; instead, close it by a 4-0 suture. The wound clips restrict the natural movement of the mouse, and often clips become loose and come out quickly.\n3. Post-Operative Care\nAfter closing the skin, wipe the surroundings of both the suture sites with iodine solution (betadine) using a sterile cotton tip.\nInject a dose of antibiotic cefotaxime as 600 mg/kg body weight (typically 12 mg cefotaxime in 100 µL of saline/mouse)intraperitoneally using 1 mL syringe.\nGive daily doses of analgesic Meloxicam as 1 mg/kg body weight (typically 12 µg Meloxicam in 100 µL of saline/mouse) to the animal intraperitoneally, for up to three days after the surgery.\nAfter completion of the surgery, stop the flow of isoflurane gas and place the mouse back in the individually ventilated cage.\n4. Euthanization and Characterizations\nAfter the experimental end-points (1 day and 10 days post-surgery), euthanize the mice according to the institutional animal ethics guidelines.\nCollect blood by terminally bleeding the animals, puncturing the ocular terminal plexus.\nIsolate serum from the blood.\nSubscription Required.
