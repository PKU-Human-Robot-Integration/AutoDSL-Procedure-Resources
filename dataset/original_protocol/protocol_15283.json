    "The Human Ethics Committee of Ningbo University approved this experiment. All written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after they were told about the goal, requirements, and experimental procedures of the UGT experiment.\n1. Laboratory preparation for gait\nKinematics: Motion capture system\n\t\nWhen calibrating the system, turn off the incandescent lights and remove any possible reflective objects that can be mistaken for passive retro-reflective markers. Ensure that eight infrared cameras are properly aimed and have a clear and reasonable view.\nPlug the appropriate USB dongle into the PC’s parallel port. Switch on the motion-capture infrared cameras and analog-to-digital converter.\nOpen the tracking software in the PC and allow time for the eight infrared cameras to initialize. Select “Local System” node of the “Resources” pane. Every camera node will show a green light if the hardware connection is true.\nAdjust the system parameters in the Camera view pane: set the Strobe Intensity to 0.95 - 1, Threshold to 0.2 - 0.4, Gain to times 1 (x1), Grayscale Mode to Auto, Minimum Circularity Ratio to 0.5, and Max Blob Height to 50.\nPut the T-frame consisting of 5 markers in the center of the motion capture area. Select all cameras using 2D mode and confirm that they can view the calibration wand (T-frame) without any interference and/or artefacts. Click the “System Preparation” item in the toolbar and select the 5 marker Wand & T-Frame calibration object from the T-Frame drop-down list.\nIn the “Tool” pane, select the “System Preparation” button, and click the “Start” button in the “Calibrate Cameras” section. Then physically wave the T-frame in the capture range. Stop the action when the blue lights on the infrared cameras stop flashing. Monitor the progress bar until the Calibration Process is completed at “100%”and returns to “0%”.",
    "NOTE: Ensure the values of the Image Error are less than 0.3.\nPut the T-frame on the floor (the center of the motion capture area) and ensure the axes of T-frame are consistent with the heading direction.\nSelect the “Start” button under the “Set Volume Origin” section in the Tool pane.\nPlantar pressure: Pressure platform\n\t\nPut the 2 m pressure platform in the center of the test area. Notice the eight infrared cameras displayed around the pressure platform.\nDivide the pressure platform into four average areas, A, B, C and D (each area is 50 cm * 50 cm) in a linear fashion and distinguish them with an alphabet label / sticker (Figure 1).\nKeep the PC and pressure platform connected via the proprietary data cable.\nDouble-click the software icon on the desktop.\nClick the “Weight Calibration” on the Calibration Screen and input the body mass of a staff. Ask him or her to stand on the pressure platform, waiting until the system completes the calibration automatically before he/she can leave the pressure platform.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61558/61558fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental protocol. If subjects received the termination signal as the heel touched area (A), the UGT was executed so that the subject stopped in area (B). Kinematic and plantar pressure data were collected synchronically. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61558/61558fig01large.jpg]\n2. Participant preparation\nBefore the UGT test, interview all subjects and provide them with a simple explanation about the experimental goals and procedures. Obtain written informed consent from subjects who meet the key inclusion criteria.\n\t\nInclude participants who are physically active male adults, have the right leg as dominant, do not have any hearing disorder, do not have lower-limb disorders, and have not incurred injuries in the last six months.",
    "NOTE: 15 male subjects (age: 24.1 ± 0.8 years; height: 175.7 ± 2.8 cm; body weight: 68.3 ± 3.3 kg; foot length: 252.7 ± 2.1 mm) who met the experimental conditions were included in this test.\nAllow all subjects fill in a questionnaire survey.\n\tNOTE: Questions include: Have you had a history of running or other physical activities? How often do you do physical activities in a week? Do you have any professional athletic training? Have you suffered any lower-limb disorders and injuries in the last six months?\nEnsure that all subjects wear identical t-shirts and tight-fitting pants.\nMeasure subjects’ standing height (mm) and body weight (kg), lower limb length (mm), knee width (mm) and ankle width (mm) of both left and right leg using Vernier caliper or small anthropometer.\n\tNOTE: Measure the lower limb length from the superior iliac spine to the ankle medial condyle; the knee width from the lateral to the medial knee condyle; the ankle width from the lateral to the medial ankle condyle.\nShave off the body hair as appropriate and remove excess sweat using alcohol wipes. Prepare skin areas of anatomical bony landmarks for marker placement on joints and segments.\n\tNOTE: This study used 16 reflective markers18, including anterior-superior iliac spine (LASI/RASI), posterior-superior iliac spine (LPSI/RPSI), lateral mid-thigh (LTHI/RTHI), lateral knee (LKNE/RKNE), lateral mid-shank (LTIB/RTIB), lateral malleolus (LANK/RANK), second metatarsal head (LTOE/RTOE) and calcaneus (LHEE/RHEE) (Figure 2).\nIdentify 16 anatomical landmarks. On the landmarks, attach passive retro-reflective markers with double-sided adhesive tapes.\nGive each subject 5 min to adapt to the test environment and warm up with light running and stretching.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61558/61558fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: The reflective markers attached to the lower limbs. (A) side, (B) front and (C) rear.
