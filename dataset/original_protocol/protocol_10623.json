    "Ethical permission\nAfter obtaining written informed consent of patients, umbilical cords were obtained from Caesarean section at the Department of Gynaecology for isolation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Permission was given from the ethics committee of Innsbruck Medical University (no. UN4435).\n1. Prepare the IVSWT Water Bath\nPrepare 3.5 L of tap water in an appropriate tank. Water needs to be heated to 37 °C (see Protocol 6).\nFill the water into the water bath until the water level is approximately 3 cm below the edge. Mind to completely cover the membrane with water. This will require approximately the prepared 3.5 L.\nConnect the temperature sensor to the power supply.\nPut the sensor into the intended fitting on the back wall of the water bath.\nConnect heating to power supply of the temperature sensor. Do not do this without water in the bath as the heater would melt the Plexiglas.\nWait until the water has reached a stable temperature of 37 °C. Stir the water regularly with some kind of stick to guarantee constant temperature throughout the water bath.\n2. Prepare Cells and Culture Flasks\nSeed cells over night at desired density in T25 culture flasks or culture the cells in the flasks directly until they have reached the desired confluence.\nBefore the experiment, align the flasks vertically.\nFill the culture flasks with culture medium until right below their necks. Do not fill too much medium into the flasks as medium in contact to the neck or the closing cap would get contaminated.\nScrew the flasks with solid caps without filters to prevent contamination from water. Mind that the water in the bath and the bath itself are not sterile.\nSeal the caps with Parafilm before insertion into the water bath.",
    "Fix sealed culture flasks in the provided stand.\nInsert fixed flask into the water bath. Take care that the middle of the cell culture flask is at the same height as the center of the shock wave applicator's membrane. A line at the side of the bath guides you.\n3. Define Treatment Parameters\nDefine distance between shock wave source and sample. Identify perfect treatment parameters by conducting the parameter finding pilot experiment as described in Figure 6.\nChoose the right treatment parameters (energy flux density, frequency) on the shock wave device. Again, refer to Figure 6.\n4. Shock Wave Application\nPut plenty amounts of commercially available ultrasound transmission gel on the shock wave applicator as well as on the membrane of the water bath. This is to assure coupling. No air or air bubbles should be between the applicator and the membrane as it would absorb shock waves.\nConnect applicator to the membrane and hold it stable in the center of the membrane. Take care that it is aligned horizontally.\nMake sure that the correct vertical position of the probe inside the water bath is in line with the indicated marking at the side of the bath.\nHold centers of the applicator and the flask stable in a horizontal line.\nActivate the shock wave device and apply the impulses while keeping the culture flask as well as the applicator in a stable position during the whole procedure.\n5. After Treatment\nTake the culture flask out of the water bath.\nDry it with common paper towels.\nWipe the flask accurately with disinfecting agents.\nRemove Parafilm sealing and cap.\nPipette the Medium inside the flasks into centrifugal tubes.\nCentrifuge appropriately. Centrifuging parameters depend on the used cell type, e.g. for HUVECs, use 290 g at room temperature.",
    "Add 5ml of cell culture medium to the flask. Resuspend the centrifuged cell pellet with 2 ml of cell culture medium. Pipette the suspension into the flask. Thus, cell fragments or cells that may have been detached during treatment do not get lost.\nPitfalls\nPreparation as well as treatment should be carried out under sterile conditions inside laminar flow to avoid contamination of the cell culture.\nGood cell culture practice is recommended to avoid contamination of the probes. In particular disinfection of the outside of the flasks is strongly recommended before putting them back to the incubator. The water bath, as well as the water inside, is not sterile!\nDo not connect the heater to the power supply unless the water bath is filled with water to avoid damage to the Plexiglas built bath.\nUse generous amounts of ultrasound gel on the shock wave applicator to guarantee proper coupling and wave propagation into the bath. Air and even small air bubbles do absorb shock waves!\nCheck position of the probes inside the water bath in relation to the applicator to ensure treatment of the entire growth area.\nDo not dunk probes too deep into the water to avoid contamination.\nSubscription Required.
