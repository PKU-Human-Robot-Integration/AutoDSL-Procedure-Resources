  "procedures": [
    "Spotted fever group Rickettsia spp. (SFGR) are naturally transmitted to a vertebrate host in tick saliva during blood feeding, as are most tick-borne pathogens. Tick saliva serves as a medium for pathogen transfer and, significantly, also modulates host immune responses, creating a favorable environment for promoting pathogen transmission and infection. This phenomenon of enhanced pathogen transmission—called “saliva-assisted transmission”—has been documented for several tick-borne pathogens. Needle inoculation of bacteria into model animals does not replicate the environment and conditions of saliva-assisted transmission. In addition, the mode and route of inoculation can influence the development of infection in a vertebrate host along with its physiological and immunological responses. Thus, the natural tick-borne mode of infection is preferred in studies of pathogen-vector-host relationships. On the other hand, feeding uninfected ticks on animals is essential for xenodiagnosis of occult infections.\nHere, we provide step-by-step instructions on the feeding of ixodid ticks on guinea pigs for introducing tick-borne Rickettsia spp. into the guinea pig via infected tick bite and the acquisition by ticks of pathogens from infected animals.\nOne can achieve the preliminary introduction of the Rickettsia species of interest into ticks by hemocoel microinjection (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0002]), capillary tube feeding, or immersion in cell culture or by feeding of ticks on infected animals (xenodiagnosis) with the subsequent maintenance in a natural transmission cycle where infected and uninfected colony-reared ticks are sequentially fed on susceptible laboratory animals.",
    "Procedures described in this protocol involve ticks purposely infected with SFGR. The biological risk of working with live ticks is associated with their obligatory hematophagy in all life stages. Hazards include their ability to crawl under personal protective equipment (PPE) and personal clothing and remain hidden or attached to the host, as well as to survive on or under furniture (e.g., on a counter, in an elevator, on a door handle, on a telephone receiver) for extended periods. The Arthropod Containment Guidelines of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene/American Committee of Medical Entomology contains general recommendations for safe arthropod handling practices, safety equipment, and facilities (American Committee of Medical Entomology and American Society of Tropical & Hygiene, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0002]). Although airlocks impede escape and dispersal by flying insects, ticks can and will crawl through doorways. Therefore, we recommend surrounding the doorframes to laboratories holding ticks with a lining of petroleum jelly or carpet tape to prevent ticks from walking out of the designated facility. Replace the petroleum jelly or tape at least once a month. If using petroleum jelly is not practical, a similar method should be in place to prevent ticks from leaving the laboratory in the event of a spill or escape.",
    "CAUTION: Appropriate PPE for personnel entering the designated facility includes a white gown or coverall, a hairnet or a cap (hair must not be touching the gown), and properly fitting gloves (BMBL, 2020). When putting on the gloves, ensure that you cover your wrists by pulling them over the sleeves of a gown or coverall so that ticks cannot crawl under the sleeves. Thoroughly inspect your PPE for ticks and appropriately remove it when exiting the facility—gloves, gowns, and coveralls worn inside the tick laboratory must not be allowed outside the area designated for tick work because ticks can hitch a ride on clothing and packaging.\nMaterials\nGuinea pigs (desired strain, aged 4 weeks)\nBiatane Non-Adhesive Foam, DuoDerm, or equivalent dressings\nGlue or adhesive, skin compatible (Ostobond Skin Bond, Kamar Adhesive, or equivalent)\nAnesthetics (appropriate injectables such as ketamine/xylazine, or inhalants, i.e., isoflurane—see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0006])\nDetergent (e.g., dish soap)\nPetroleum jelly (Vaseline or equivalent)\n10% (w/v) chlorine bleach solution\nNoncorrosive disinfectant (e.g., Lysol Disinfectant Spray or equivalent)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nPPE: White gown or coverall and disposable gloves (latex or nitryl with tight-fitting cuffs)\nMasking tape (for securing glove-cuff to the sleeve and capturing stray ticks)\nCages to house guinea pigs individually\nMoats (water trays; of dimensions larger than the cage footprint, to place under cages and fill with water)\nLeFlap (Monarch Labs)\nHypafix tape, optional\nTubular cotton stockinette bandage (2.5-5 cm diameter tight-woven–for tick feeding bags/chambers)\nNylon stocking (tight-woven pantyhose tights or equivalent–for tick feeding bags/chambers)\nScissors\n5- to 6-ml and 10- to 20-ml plastic syringes\nHair clipper with clipper blades, no. 40 or 50 (Oster, Wahl or equivalent)\nPlastic bottle or beaker (3- to 6-cm diameter)\nElizabethan collars (e-collars), optional\nGuinea pig jackets (Lomir)\nPipe cutter\nNylon mesh\nBench-top vacuum pump\nVacuum trap flask",

Acclimate the guinea pigs in individual cages situated over water moats (if used) in the facility designated for tick feeding.\nWe recommend acclimation because abrupt changes in the environment can cause alterations in guinea pig metabolism, body temperature, and behavior that may affect post-feeding and post-infection clinical observations.\n2. Prepare containment chambers, as well as double-layered feeding bags or plastic feeding chambers.\n         \na.Containment chambers: Use chambers made of LeFlap (∼8-10 cm square, depending on the size of the dorsum) as the primary chamber, with reinforcement from other materials including DuoDERM and Biatane Non-Adhesive Foam to elevate the center area where ticks feed, and adhered to the skin using Ostobond Skin Bond, which may be supplemented with Hypafix tape (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0001]).\nThis method was modified from Embers et al. (Embers, Grasperge, Jacobs, & Philipp, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0013]). We have also found this type of chamber to be successful with a Lomir guinea pig jack secured over the chamber, which removes the need for an e-collar and is well-tolerated by guinea pigs (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0002]).",
    "b.Feeding bags: Cut the desired number of stockinette and nylon sleeves for the tick feeding bags (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0003]). Each feeding bag holding adult ticks requires two 10-cm segments of 2.5- to 5.0-cm-diameter cotton stockinette; each feeding bag containing larval or nymphal ticks requires one 10-cm segment of cotton stockinette for the outer layer and one 10-cm segment of a nylon stocking (pantyhose) for the inner layer.\nThe back of a guinea pig usually provides enough space for only a single feeding bag.\nc.Feeding chambers: Alternatively, cut a 15- to 20-mm length of the syringe barrel (5-10 ml; 15-20 mm diameter) with the flange; remove the rubber seal from the syringe plunger and use it as a stopper to plug the capsule, preventing tick escape (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0004]).\nUp to two plastic feeding capsules may fit on the shaven dorsum of a large guinea pig, between the shoulders and the bottom of the ribcage, if necessary.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0733f06f-c1a2-455a-8f2d-0a8c33e28762/cpz1584-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nContainment chamber containing five Gulf Coast ticks on guinea pig, with Hypafix tape around edges.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c1a16b7e-b25f-4d72-bf0a-d65609c1d710/cpz1584-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nHartley guinea pig fitted with a jacket over a tick containment chamber (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58ed81e5-9855-427b-93ee-eca2b7f7c643/cpz1584-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nDouble bags for tick feeding stretched over plastic bottles: for immature ticks (left) and for adult ticks (right) (Levin and Schumacher, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0019]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4f284685-d93e-4554-a2dc-c7714ca36013/cpz1584-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nTick-feeding capsule.

Anesthetize the guinea pig using sedatives and dosage appropriate for body weight.\nAnesthesia should last at least 30 min to allow sufficient adhesive drying before the animal starts moving in the cage. See Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0006] if using inhalant anesthesia.",
    "4. Clip the hair on the guinea pig's dorsum from neck to midriff as close to the skin as possible using no. 40 or 50 surgical clipper blades.\n5. If using feeding bags, prepare them using a plastic bottle or a beaker 3-6 cm in diameter.\nSlip the feeding bag over the plastic bottle or beaker to stretch, measure, and trim the components to the appropriate lengths, and then place both the bag with adhesive and bottle or beaker that holds the bag's shape onto the back of the guinea pig, as described in Levin and Schumacher (2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0019]).\n6. Affix containment chamber, feeding bags, or plastic feeding chambers to the shaven area on the animal's dorsum using Ostobond Skin Bond, Kamar Adhesive, or equivalent skin-compatible glue.\nIf using plastic feeding chambers, apply adhesive only to the flange of a syringe barrel; avoid smearing it inside the chamber as it can trap ticks. Only affix bags or chambers over the thoracic area of the dorsum, as the guinea pig will attempt to chew off any devices attached over the lumbar area. Additionally, natural flexing of the lumbar can pull the skin away from a rigid plastic capsule, resulting in its detachment.\n7. Following your approved IACUC protocol, keep the guinea pig warm and monitor heart rate and respiratory rate until complete recovery, then return the guinea pig to its cage.\nAllow at least 3 hr before placing ticks into the feeding bags or chambers to ensure that the glue is completely dry. Guinea pigs do not tolerate rear leg hobbles; use an Elizabethan collar of appropriate size or a jacket (preferred).\nPreparing ticks for infestation\n8. Assemble a “tick syringe” (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0005]).",
    "Remove the plunger from a 5- to 6-ml syringe (without needle) and remove the rubber stopper from the plunger. Cut a 4- to 6-mm airhole in the center of the rubber stopper.\nUse a pipe cutter to cut off the needle-port part of the syringe barrel, making sure not to crack the barrel; keep the flanged part.\nPlace the rubber stopper with an airhole into a piece of precut nylon mesh, and push the nylon mesh and stopper into the flanged end of the syringe barrel (2 cm deep).\nRemove the plunger with a seal from another syringe of the same size and use it to plug the open end of the cut barrel, creating a closed chamber.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/286987d5-2ef3-4615-a671-c977ef83b1c1/cpz1584-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nTick syringe. a, cut barrel of a syringe; b, rubber seal with nylon mesh covering an airhole (mesh-covered airhole allows you to load the tick syringe with the needed number of ticks using vacuum); c, syring plunger with a rubber seal.\n9. Determine the number of ticks from the infected cohort that you need to place on each guinea pig to ensure that at least one Rickettsia-infected tick feeds to repletion based on (a) the prevalence of infection with the infected cohort and (b) the expected feeding success.\nWe expect 50%-70% feeding success for larvae and 70%-90% for nymphs and adults for most ixodid tick species placed on naïve guinea pigs. Guinea pigs tend to develop pronounced anti-tick immunity within 2 weeks of the first infestation, and sequential infestations often result in a marked reduction of the tick feeding success.",
    "Placing too many ticks within the limited space of a bag or a feeding chamber may cause an immediate hypersensitivity reaction and rejection of attached ticks, resulting in low feeding success and further decreased survival during the molt. Each 2.5- to 5.0-cm feeding bag can house up to 500 larvae, 200 nymphs, or three pairs of adult ticks without overcrowding. Each plastic chamber can accommodate up to 50 nymphs or one pair of adult ticks. Containment chambers made from LeFlap may hold up to ten adult ticks comfortably.\n10. Aspirate ticks designated for each feeding bag or chamber into a “tick syringe” using a vacuum pump.\n         \nRemove the plunger from the tick-syringe assembly and connect the flanged end of the barrel to a vacuum trap flask and then to the pump using Tygon tubing. Keep the plunger nearby.\nCount the designated number of ticks into a small beaker with water containing a trace of detergent (dish soap).\nAspirate the water with the ticks from the beaker into a tick syringe. Water will pass through the nylon mesh and the airhole in the stopper and collect in the trap flask while leaving ticks in the tick syringe.\nImmediately plug the open end of the tick syringe with the plunger.\nFor additional details on handling ticks, refer to Levin and Schumacher (2016), where the use of a non-corrosive disinfectant (e.g., Lysol) and 70% ethanol are recommended for preventing contamination of ticks, and a white sorting tray and paintbrush are used for managing ticks before placement. Permanent markers and zip-top plastic bags are useful for labeling tubes and bags containing tubes with ticks.\nPlacement of ticks on guinea pigs",
    "11. Fill the moat under the guinea pig cage with water to the depth of 1.0-2.5 cm; cover the edges of the moat with petroleum jelly.\nThe moat ensures that ticks cannot escape if feeding bags or chambers become damaged or detached. Adding a drop of dish soap to water will break the surface tension, making the moat more effective. Alternatively, if unable to fill a moat under the cage, lining the cage border with petroleum jelly is an effective way to contain ticks when using small numbers of adult ticks and when combined with the containment chamber and jacket system.\n12. Prepare a waste container filled with 10% (w/v) bleach.\n13. Remove the guinea pig from the cage and place it in a restraining plastic container.\nA restraining container may not be required if at least two additional handlers are present for manual restraint.\n14. Open the containment chamber, feeding bag, or plastic chamber.\n15. Holding the prepared tick syringe flange down, tap it several times on the counter to knock all ticks to the mesh-covered rubber stopper.\n16. Quickly remove the plunger, insert it into the flange end of the tick syringe, and push (inject) ticks with the mesh and rubber stopper into the feeding bag or chamber.\n17. Place the emptied tick syringe into the waste container.\n18. Close the containment chamber, feeding bag, or plastic chamber with a mesh cover reinforced with Hypafix tape, rubber bands, or a stopper.\nThe rubber stopper from the tick syringe can either be removed from the feeding bag immediately using forceps or left inside until the next day. However, leave the nylon mesh from the tick syringe inside until the next day's checkup.\n19. Return the guinea pig to its cage.\nPost-infestation monitoring",
    "20. The day after tick placement, remove nylon mesh and rubber stopper from the feeding bag or chamber without disturbing the attached ticks.\n21. Check the condition of the containment chamber, feeding bags, or plastic chambers and the engorgement status of ticks daily.\n22. Collect, clean, and house the engorged ticks.\n23. Keep a daily log of the number of ticks placed on animals and those recovered.\nOnce you collect all the ticks, the feeding bags and chambers can be peeled off or left for the animals to remove themselves.\n24. Conduct and record clinical assessments daily. These assessments may include rectal temperature (or alternatively, temperature by microchip and reader), observations of body posture, scrotal edema, and ear auricle discoloration as described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0005], steps 7-12.",
    "Studying SFR in guinea pigs requires a source of infected ticks to transmit the SFGR via tick transmission—the route of naturally acquired SFR in humans. Although generating infected ticks by feeding them on infected animals is time-consuming, costly, and typically reserved for pathogens that reach high circulating blood levels in the host, the use of infected hosts to infect nymphal and adult ticks is well documented (Levin, Zemtsova, Killmaster, Snellgrove, & Schumacher, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0021]; Matsumoto, Brouqui, Raoult, & Parola, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0023]; Schumacher, Snellgrove, & Levin, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0037]; Stanley et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0040]; Zemtsova, Killmaster, Mumcuoglu, & Levin, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0050]). You may acquire infected ticks from wild populations if SFGR infection rates are high in the region and take advantage of transovarial transmission of SFGR from engorged female ticks. Larval offspring from engorged females are likely to harbor SFGR and can serve as a source of infected larval stages. One might also consider immersion of immature stages—larvae and nymphs—if using these stages in guinea pig-tick-Rickettsia studies or capillary feeding (Baldridge et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0005]; Matsumoto et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0023]; Ye et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0049]).",
    "Here, we present a protocol to generate SFGR-infected adult ticks for SFGR transmission to guinea pigs by hemocoel microinjection of engorged nymphs. By allowing engorged nymphs to undergo ecdysis, one can use adult males and females for SFGR transmission. We focus on adult ticks because they are easier to visualize and, thus, easier to contain on animals and keep track of for biosafety purposes. Note that injection into the unfed adult tick anal pore or hemocoel has been used for other organisms besides SFGR (Levin et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0018]; Yang et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0048]). We began using injection of engorged nymphal stages based on the publication by Goddard (2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0015]) and through our collaborations with Dr. Goddard. The protocol presented here is a modified version of what Dr. Goddard used in his study with R. parkeri and guinea pigs.\nCAUTION: Perform all activities involving handling infectious materials at the proper biosafety level conditions for the bacteria cultured (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0001]).\nMaterials\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nLive co-culture of Rickettsia sp.

Then, perform SFGR injections within the biosafety cabinet with the sash lowered to proper level for safe use.\n1. Clean the working surface of biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol.\n2. Place necessary supplies in the biosafety cabinet. Include two sterile petri dishes for every ten ticks to be injected, a sharps container, syringes and needles, forceps, a vial of Rickettsia sp. culture in a rack, Kimwipes, polystyrene containers, mesh covers, and rubber bands. Once ticks are injected, you will place them in the container with a mesh covering secured by a rubber band. Keep a spray bottle of 70% ethanol and a small biohazard bag in the biosafety cabinet while working.\nYou can co-culture Rickettsia spp. in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) or embryonic tick cells (e.g., ISE6 or AAE2). However, consider how the host cell selection may affect data; we are unaware of studies evaluating whether the source of inoculum affects the biology of the injected rickettsiae in a tick, including transmissibility to the guinea pig model.\nTick injection\n3. After gently inverting vials with cultured Rickettsia spp. (host cells from the co-culture are still present), draw up ∼0.5 ml of cultured material using a 21-G or 23-G needle, then replace the needle with 30-G needle for injection into the hemocoel.",
    "4. Open the “stock” container of ticks and transfer up to 10 ticks to one sterile petri dish.\n5. With a petri dish lid nearby, gently grasp the tick between the flat serrated edges of the forceps, with the tick's ventral side up and posterior end at the open end of the forceps.\nEngorged nymphal ixodid ticks move slowly—but keep the lid on the petri dish when not handling ticks for injection. Alternatively, remove the ticks from the stock container one at a time for injection. Regardless, you should be holding the tick on the bottom of the dish for the injection to maintain stability.\n6. Using a 1-ml syringe, squeeze out a small bleb of cultured rickettsiae, letting it remain at the tip of the needle, and then gently prick the posterior end of the engorged nymph body, preferably along the edge or at the anal pore if possible.\n7. Place the injected tick in a fresh petri dish where the ticks can dry and recover before they are transferred to the polystyrene container.\nYou may gently dab excess cultured material off the tick if desired or if too much is present. However, we typically avoid this, as capillary action may draw material out of the lesion created from the injection.\n8. Continue performing injections and transferring ticks to a new dish until finished with the first 10 ticks. Then examine the injected ticks and transfer all dry ticks to a polystyrene container with a top that has a 4- to 6-mm air hole cut in the center and a piece nylon mesh (2.5-4.0 cm square) under the lid.\nTicks must be dry when transferred to their containers to reduce the risk of mold.",
    "9. Place the polystyrene container(s) in the humidity chamber, where the ticks will remain for ecdysis.\nOne can convert almost any sealable container into a ‘‘humidity chamber’’ by placing a tray with clean water (or salt solution if desired) on the bottom; we generally use a desiccator container (see Materials). Most ixodid ticks require high (>80%) relative humidity (rH) for their survival. We use saturated potassium nitrate (KNO3) for Amblyomma spp.\n10. Dispse of the used Petri dishes and other contaminated non-sharps material in a biohazard bag; dispose of needles in the “sharps” container.\nHousing ticks after injection\n11. Check on the ticks periodically (≥3 times a week) for evidence of mold. Clean the ticks gently with Kimwipes and 70% ethanol, allowing them to dry before returning them to a fresh, sterile container.\nBe knowledgeable of the expected time for ecdysis (Troughton & Levin, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0043]), monitor ticks for development and watch for evidence of mortality. Engorged ticks that turn a black color are not viable.",
    "When infection of animals with SFGR via tick bite is impossible or impractical, one can introduce pathogens into guinea pigs by needle-inoculation of infected cell cultures, homogenates of tick tissues, or cryopreserved homogenates of tissues from previously infected guinea pigs. Often used for the initial introduction of a pathogen into the tick-animal transmission cycle, needle inoculation also allows standardization of the infectious dose between multiple animals, which is difficult when utilizing the tick-borne route. Intraperitoneal (IP) and subcutaneous (SC) are the primary routes for injection of 0.1-5.0 ml of infectious material. The IP route provides an additional benefit of allowing quick absorption of a larger volume of inoculum within the body cavity.\nThis protocol describes procedures for infecting guinea pigs with infectious cell culture containing Rickettsia spp. Via intraperitoneal (IP) and subcutaneous (SC) routes.\nCAUTION: Perform all activities involving handling infectious materials at the proper biosafety level conditions for the bacteria cultured (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0001]). Pay special attention to the careful handling of Rickettsia-contaminated sharps (needles) and the possibility of aerosolizing the infectious material during the injection. When injecting infectious material, always use a Luer-lock (not slip-tip) syringe to secure the needle, ensuring no liquids leak. Perform SFGR injections within a biosafety cabinet with the sash lowered to protect the researcher against a potential spray of infectious material.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0001])\nInfectious material (i.e., SFGR cell culture)\nAntiseptic solution (rubbing alcohol or equivalent)\n1- to 5-ml Luer-lock syringes (sized depending on the volume of the inoculum)\n19- to 23-G. 1/2- to 5/8-inch Luer-lock needles\nBiosafety cabinet\nDisposable absorbent benchtop pads or paper\nSharps container\nGauze pads\nPreparation of the inoculum\n1.

    "Depending on the Rickettsia species, isolate, and source, an infectious dose can vary from 104 to 107 infected cells per inoculum.\nIf using cryopreserved material, thaw the inoculum immediately before inoculation by placing closed vial(s) into a beaker with room-temperature water under the biosafety cabinet.\n2. Prefill syringes with the required volume of infectious material.\n3. Sedate or anesthetize guinea pigs using sedatives and dosages appropriate for body weight; see Support Protocol 2 for anesthesia.\nAlthough one can perform SC injections without anesthesia, properly restraining an awake animal requires the help of a second person; this may be difficult to manage in a biosafety cabinet with a lowered sash. Anesthesia is required for IP injections.\nIntraperitoneal (IP) inoculation\n4a. Place the guinea pig in the biosafety cabinet on its back with the head away from you.\n5a. Locate the peritoneal cavity in the lower quadrant of the abdomen, lateral to the animal's midline.\nIt is preferable to make the IP injection into the animal's right abdominal (inguinal) quadrant to avoid breaching the cecum, located on the left side of the abdomen.\n6a. Swab the injection site with an antiseptic on a gauze pad.\n7a. Tilt the animal's body downward with the head rolled back by lifting the right hind leg slightly so that its hind end is higher than its head.\nThis position allows the abdominal viscera to shift cranially, decreasing the chances of an accidental puncture of the abdominal organs with a needle.\n8a. Insert the needle into the inguinal region (just above a line between the hip and the abdomen) at a 30-45° angle to the skin.\n9a. Aspirate the syringe to ensure the intestines or urinary bladder were not penetrated accidentally.",
    "If foreign matter is drawn back into the syringe, withdraw the needle and repeat the injection using a fresh syringe, needle, and material.\n10a. If nothing is drawn back into the syringe, inject the material and withdraw the needle.\nIf the needle becomes blocked with a clump of tissue during injection, pull the needle out and replace it. Do not try pushing the clump through by increasing pressure on the plunger, as this may result in needle disengagement, causing the infectious material to leak or spray.\n11a. Discard the syringe with the needle into a sharps container without recapping.\nUse a new needle and syringe for each animal.\nSubcutaneous (SC) inoculation\n4b. Place the sedated guinea pig in the biosafety cabinet on its abdomen.\nThe preferred injection site is in the back of the animal's neck—i.e., the scruff.\n5b. Pull the scruff upwards, creating a “tent” with the skin, and inject the inoculum here.\n6b. Insert the needle under the skin along the spine with the needle pointing cranially.\n7b. Aspirate the syringe.\n8b. If nothing is drawn back into the syringe, inject the required amount of material and withdraw the needle.\n9b. Discard the syringe with the needle in a “sharps” container without recapping. Use a new needle and syringe for each animal.\n10b. Proceed to step 12.\nPost-inoculation monitoring\n12. Ensure that no blood or inoculum is present at the injection site and place the animal back in its cage. If needed, apply pressure until the bleeding stops and clean with gauze and 70% ethanol (or equivalent antiseptic).\n13. Disinfect all work surfaces by spraying with 70% ethanol (or equivalent antiseptic).\n14. Continue checking the recovery status of animals every 15 min until they completely recover from anesthesia and are moving with no unsteadiness.",
    "Here, we describe steps for the daily monitoring and recording of clinical signs in guinea pigs exposed to SFGR through the course of infection. Because the normal body temperature of a guinea pig can fluctuate between 37.2°C and 38.8°C throughout the day, conduct daily observations at the same time of the day to minimize diurnal variability. It is important to schedule the first 1-2 time-point observations before the guinea pigs are exposed to rickettsial agents to collect baseline data.\nIn general, guinea pigs usually become febrile (>39.5°C) between the fourth and seventh day after infection, depending on the virulence of a rickettsial isolate, the inoculum, and the transmission route. In addition to abruptly rising body temperature, guinea pigs injected with pathogenic rickettsiae characteristically develop scrotal reactions including erythema and edema, brawny discoloration and lividity of ears due to necrotizing vasculitis, perivascular hemorrhage, and focal necrosis, as well as edema and dermatitis of footpads. In fulminant cases, animals become moribund on the 8-11th day after infection with dehydration and hypothermia.\nMaterials\nClinical record forms\nDigital bench-top scale (Mettler Toledo or equivalent)\nRestraining box: plastic box or a cage for confining a guinea pig on the scale\nDigital thermometer, soft tip (or microchips and a reader)\nThermometer probe covers (disposable)\nLubricant (Vaseline or equivalent)\n1.

    "The typical sexually mature guinea pig (3-4 months old), the age we recommend for most studies, will be at least 20 times the size of a sexually mature BALB/c mouse (6-8 weeks old). Thus, the larger size of the guinea pig expands the number of potential time points for antemortem sampling and the amount of the sample you can safely collect during infection (e.g., blood volume, skin biopsy size). Although the types of biological specimens obtained will depend on the study question and hypothesis, they will typically include blood and skin samples, at the tick bite site or peripheral sites, at various time points.",
    "Blood collection sites will depend on the volume of blood needed for assays, with our locations of choice being the saphenous vein for volumes of ∼200 µl or less and the jugular vein for larger volumes. For larger volumes, do not exceed 5% of the guinea pig's total blood volume (75 ml/kg) weekly, or 7.5% blood volume biweekly (Williams & Kendall, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0047]). For studies using a 550-g guinea pig, this would equal ∼2 ml total volume divided into multiple time points over the week. If needed, one may collect sufficient blood at three time points over a week for immunophenotyping using flow cytometry (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0008]), serology (see Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0010]), a complete blood count (CBC), and if required, PCR assays (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0007]). Attempts to detect rickettsiae in whole blood will rarely, if ever, bear fruit. We recommend using skin samples from the tick-bite site or ear pinna to assess rickettsial transmission and dissemination. We were guided by methods described by Birck et al.

Adjust the position of the guinea pig's head while the mask is on so that the nose is pointing slightly toward the floor, with one person holding both forelegs caudally (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0009]).\nWe found that holding one foreleg is sufficient in some cases, depending on individual preference of the blood collector or slight variations in the position of the jugular, which can make availability for venipuncture affected by small adjustments of the forelegs.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e9505f90-7884-453a-a2cc-2f3d174b4730/cpz1584-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nJugular venipuncture of guinea pig, demonstrating the technique at the moment when a flash of blood is in the hub of needle.\n3a. Shave the area for blood collection and disinfect the skin with 70% ethanol, wiping away hair and excess ethanol with 4 × 4-inch gauze sponge.\n4a. With the index finger on the clavicle and distributing some pressure to hold the jugular vein cranially, and placing the thumb on the jawline, insert a 25-G, 5/8-inch needle attached to a syringe (1-ml or 3-ml depending on volume required), with needle bevel side up, into the skin at a slight ∼10-25° angle to the skin (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0009]).",
    "Use a third finger from the nondominant hand or a third person, if available, to place some support on the opposite side of the neck to keep the venipuncture area from shifting. Do not expect to see the jugular vein while applying pressure cranial to the clavicle; this is a “blind stick” that relies on knowledge of guinea pig anatomy, the skill that comes with practice, and a bit of luck.\n5a. Keeping some negative pressure on the syringe and making slight adjustments to the position of the needle, watch for a flash of blood to enter the hub of the needle and then maintain negative pressure until a sufficient blood volume is obtained; after withdrawing the needle, release the forelegs, and apply slight pressure with gauze to the puncture site.\nYou may need to slightly back the needle out without exiting the skin (without losing negative pressure) while repositioning before locating the jugular; although the needle stick is usually superficial, we have had animals that required a deeper needle stick. Also, note that a small spray of blood in the hub is typically from damaged capillaries and is not indicative of entering the jugular; take care to avoid damage during venipuncture and alternate to the other side if necessary.\n6a. Immediately dispense the blood into EDTA microtainer tubes, filling to no more than four-fifths of the maximum fill volume of each tube (i.e., 400 µl of a 0.5-ml tube) to avoid clotting. Cap each tube as it is filled and immediately invert 4-5 times, then place on a tube rocker until use.",
    "It is especially helpful to have a third person present at this time to hand off tubes to, as clotting can occur rapidly. Some people also coat the syringe interior with EDTA before sampling to help minimize clotting.\nBlood collection via saphenous venipuncture\n1b. Starting with either an anesthetized or non-anesthetized guinea pig, shift it into a lateral recumbent position, and extend the opposite hind leg and down by holding out that foot—i.e., if the animal is in a left lateral recumbent position, extend the right hind leg.\nYou can perform this technique without anesthesia if there is no other reason to have the guinea pig anesthetized.\n2b. Shave the tarsal area of the leg to visualize vessels and clean with 70% ethanol and gauze.\n3b. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to the skin in the region to better visualize the vessels and stimulate blood circulation.\n4b. While firmly holding the foot to better expose the vein, puncture the vein using a 21-G needle.\nA robust bleb of blood should form if the vein was punctured successfully; this may take more than one attempt but take care not to attempt more than a few times before moving to the other leg or completing aborting the attempt on that animal to avoid bruising.\n5b. Place a microtainer tube immediately at the base of the site to collect blood before clotting.\nYou may also use an EDTA primed 1-ml syringe attached to the needle to draw up a measurable amount of blood or a heparinized or non-heparinized capillary tube, depending on the downstream use of the sample.\n6b. Proceed to collection of skin biopsies (steps 7-10) and/or ear notches (steps 11 and 12) if needed.\nCollection of skin biopsies",
    "7. With the guinea pig still under anesthesia, place it in a ventral recumbent position and shave the dorsum using surgical clipper blades if the area is not already shaved from the tick placement.\nIf taking skin biopsies at or near the site of tick attachment, you will need to open the chamber where ticks are present and may need to remove ticks and shave the area further. Regardless, take the biopsy after jugular venipuncture if both sample collections are performed at that time point.\n8. Wipe the area gently with gauze, using 70% ethanol on intact skin and ensuring the skin is dry before taking the biopsy.\n9. Place the 4-mm biopsy punch perpendicular to the skin surface and apply pressure, gently twisting it into the dermis until resistance is no longer apparent and you have reached subcutaneous fat. Draw the punch out (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0010]), remove the biopsy from the site or the punch itself, and apply pressure to the site to stop any bleeding.\nIf removing from the site, lift the punched skin with forceps and clip fat underneath using fine-tipped scissors (autoclaved or cleaned with 70% ethanol). Biopsy punches of this size left open to heal rarely bleed long once pressure is applied; however, we have not seen adverse effects from closing the punch site with a suture or tissue glue.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/531043d0-4f3b-4cba-be18-4c4174f3ec31/cpz1584-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nCollection of guinea pig skin biopsy using a 4-mm punch biopsy.

Starting with either an anesthetized or non-anesthetized guinea pig, take a 2.0-mm ear punch from the ear pinna margin.\nIf you are only collecting ear notches, the guinea pig does not need to be anesthetized; however, this is often done at the point when isoflurane is replaced with oxygen, and the guinea pig is still on the table before awakening entirely (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0006], step 8).\n12.

    "Anesthesia of guinea pigs is complicated, and you must handle animals carefully to reduce the chance of anesthetic complications. Animals must be acclimated to their surroundings, including handling, for ≥72 hr before any procedures are begun.

Aliquot 40 μl master mix for each sample into PCR 8-Tube Strips.\nYou will divide the samples into two wells at a later step.\n6. Aliquot 10 μl of unknown template, or 10 μl of molecular-grade H2O for the NTC, into the correct strips and cap the tubes before proceeding.\nThe strip will now have 50 μl that will be split into duplicates when transferred to the qPCR plate. Each sample will then contain ∼20 μl of master mix and 5 μl of the sample template, totaling 25 μl.\n7. Perform a 1:10 serial dilution from 107-101 copies using the 108 (per target) stock plasmid mix and diluting with molecular-grade H2O.",

Load 22 μl of each sample into two duplicate wells of the 96-well optical plate.\nCap the wells as you go to prevent contamination. First, add the unknown samples to the plate, then the NTC, and finally the standard dilution samples. Load the standards onto the plate as in the previous step, from lowest concentration to highest. Gently mix in the strips before loading in plate wells.\n10. Ensure that the caps are tight and pulse-centrifuge the plate.\nMultiplex qPCR and analysis\n11.

Analyze results on AriaMx software (or equivalent).\nAmplification efficiencies must be between 90% and 110% and have an R2 value ≥0.985 for a valid qPCR experiment. This assay will reliably detect target DNA in samples down to 10 copies.\nNote that efficiencies >100% are likely to indicate the presence of polymerase inhibitors in the reaction. Possible contaminants are excessive DNA in the sample or carryover materials from either sample collection or processing. Heparin, polysaccharides, proteinase K, ethanol, and phenol are all potential contaminants. As inhibition is more likely to occur in concentrated samples, a good method for confirming and dealing with inhibition is to perform the assay on diluted samples.",
    "Here, we describe a method for monitoring the immune response to rickettsial infection by immunophenotyping blood leukocytes via polychromatic flow cytometry at predetermined time points (Stokes et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0042]). Rather than sacrificing a group of mice at each time point, you follow individual guinea pigs over the course of the study. Schedule the first time point to occur before you place the ticks on the guinea pigs to collect baseline data. Also, it is essential to maintain a rapid and consistent tempo at all time points when performing this protocol to achieve the highest reproducibility. This consistency is best accomplished by working as a team of at least two people. Finally, for clarity in the steps that require calculations, we will assume that there will be ten experimental (unknown) samples, five Fluorescent Minus One (FMO) controls, five compensation controls, one reference control, one unstained control, and one or two “extras” to ensure adequate volume.\nMaterials\nLightning-Link PE-Cy7 Conjugate (Expedeon 762-0005)\nMouse Anti Guinea Pig CD1b3 (Bio-Rad MCA566GA)\nCa2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Gibco 10-010-049)\nBovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma A3059-100G)\nGuinea pig serum (Sigma G9774-5ML)\nFetal bovine serum (FBS), heat inactivated (Atlanta Biologicals S11510H)\nGibco RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red (Fisher 11-835-030)\nNear-IR LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen L34976)\nDMSO, anhydrous (Invitrogen D12345)\nFrozen guinea pig blood (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0005]; 100 μl/per sample for each control and experimental group)\nPropidium iodide staining solution (Invitrogen 00-6990-50)\nBD Pharm Lyse Lysing Buffer (BD Biosciences 555899)\nWhatman™ pH Indicators Integral Comparison Strips (Fisher 09-876-20)\nCell culture water (Sigma W3500)\nTrue-Stain Monocyte Blocker (BioLegend 426102)\nMouse Anti Guinea Pig Anti T-Lymphocytes (PAN):APC (Bio-Rad MCA751APC)\nMouse Anti Guinea Pig Anti CD4:PE (Bio-Rad MCA749PE)\nMouse Anti Guinea Pig Anti CD8:FITC (Bio-Rad MCA752F)\n16% formaldehyde solution, methanol-free (Thermo Scientific 28906)",

Prepare 1.0% (v/v) BSA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS (FCM-PBS), filter through a 0.1-µm filter, and store at 4°C.\n3. Determine the optimal antibody concentrations through titration.\nAdapt this Basic Protocol to perform serial dilutions on “single-stained” (one labeled antibody plus a viability stain—so, two colors) samples for each antibody. Until you are familiar with the characteristics of the antibody, try an 8- to 10-point curve. For example, if the manufacturer suggests 1:100, make your dilutions 1:50, 1:100, …, 1:6400. In our hands, it is unusual for the manufacturer's recommended concentration, or higher, to result in optimal separation. Separation is described by the stain index (SI):\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} SI = {\\rm{\\;}}\\frac{{MF{I_{positive\\,population}}{\\rm{\\;}} - {\\rm{\\;}}MF{I_{negative\\,population}}}}{{2 \\times rSD\\,negative\\,population}}  \\end{equation*}",
    "where MFI is the median fluorescence intensity and rSD is the robust standard deviation. A higher SI value indicates increased separation; we have found that optimal concentrations are often lower than the manufacturer's recommended concentration, making the titration step important in reducing both costs and noise (background).\n4. Prepare aliquots of splenocytes to use as reference controls (see Support Protocol 3).\nSee Support Protocol 3.\n5. Prepare and freeze 275-µl aliquots of guinea pig serum for blocking Fc receptors.\nFc receptors bind antibodies by the Fc region and are found on macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, and B cells.\n6. Prepare and freeze 15-ml aliquots of 5% (v/v) FBS in RPMI 1640 without phenol red (cRPMI).\n7.

Mix well and visually confirm that all the dye has dissolved. Protect from light.\nThe manufacturer suggests using 50 μl DMSO. However, the best practice is to empirically determine the lowest concentration of stain that gives consistent separation of viable vs. dead cells and with which the dead cells do not stain brighter than the Viability Dye Compensation Standard. Also, amine-reactive stains are not stable for long after being suspended in DMSO. You will obtain the most consistent results if you prepare the stain fresh on the day of use.\n9. Bring the FCM-PBS (from step 2) to room temperature.\n10. Thaw splenocytes for reference control (5 × 106 cells).",

    "The reference control comes from one animal at a single time point. Therefore, it should generate consistent results between time points and thus provide assay-specific quality control (QC) by controlling for run-to-run variation in sample processing and staining. Although often left out of longitudinal studies, this control gives confidence that results in the experimental samples are due to the “treatment” rather than instrument, technical, or analysis variability between runs.\n11. Prepare 36 ml of 1× lysing buffer (2.0 ml/sample × 18, for 10 experimental samples + 5 FMO controls + 1 unstained control + 1 reference control + 1 extra) from 10× BD Pharm Lyse Lysing Buffer stock solution, as follows.\n         \na.Dilute 3.6 ml of 10× solution to 36 ml with 32.4 ml cell culture water.\nb.Warm the 1× solution to room temperature.\nc.Check the pH of the 1× solution with pH paper strips.

To enhance pipetting accuracy and precision, make 24 μl of a 1:4 dilution by adding 6 μl of antibody to 18 μl FCM-PBS. Save the leftover at 4°C in the dark to use in step 26.",
    "The multiplier “13.2” is derived from counting all the samples that will get the entire surface antigen cocktail plus ten percent. There are 10 experimental samples, one reference control, one FMO for the viability stain, plus ten percent in this example. The total volume of the cocktail is 217.8 μl. Each sample gets 16.5 μl for surface staining, for a total volume of 198.0 μl. Thus, 217.8 μl leaves 19.8 μl extra to account for the “angel's share,” i.e., the amount lost to evaporation.\nThe dilutions (volumes) of the antibodies were based on our antibody titrations of the lot numbers used in our study. You will need to perform your own titrations (see step 3 above) before starting the experiment.\nWe included monocyte blocker in the cocktail to prevent nonspecific binding of PE-Cy7 to monocytes. The volume is based on the manufacturer's recommendation.\n13. Prepare 24 ml of methanol-free 1% formaldehyde (1.0 ml/sample × 24 samples: 10 experimental + 5 FMO controls + 5 compensation controls + 1 unstained control + 1 reference control + 2 extra) by diluting 1.5 ml of 16% formaldehyde with 22.5 ml PBS (protein-free). Keep at 4°C until ready to use.\nLeftover formaldehyde can be kept up to 3 days at –20°C before use. The 16% formaldehyde comes in 1-ml ampules. In our hands, we can rarely extract 1 ml from the ampule but can always get at least 0.9 ml. Another option is to buy 10-ml ampules, which is less expensive if you expect to use it all within 3 days.",
    "14. Thaw an aliquot of guinea pig serum and bring to room temperature. You will need 240 μl of serum (10 μl/sample × 24 samples: 10 experimental + 5 FMO controls + 5 compensation controls + 1 unstained control + 1 reference control + 2 extra).\n15.

Decant the supernatant.\nd.Wash the beads a second time just as in step 15c (above).\ne.Resuspend the beads for the Near-IR LIVE/DEAD in 50 μl PBS (protein-free) and the beads for the negative population in 100 μl PBS (protein-free). Place a cap on the tubes to reduce evaporation.\nStart sample preparation",
    "16. Draw ∼250 μl blood (100 μl for experimental FCM sample plus 150 μl “extra” for make up the minimum volume of the Microtainer) from the jugular vein of each of the ten study guinea pigs using 1-ml syringes with 25-G, 5/8-inch needles. From one guinea pig, draw ∼800-900 μl blood (100 μl for the experimental sample + 500 μl for the FMO controls + 100 μl for the unstained control + 100 to 200 μl “extra”). Dispense each ∼250-μl blood sample into a BD Microtainer. For controls, dispense ∼800-900 μl of blood from the syringe into two or three BD Microtainers (total volume ∼800-900 μl). Invert the Microtainers several times to mix the EDTA with the blood. Transport the sample preparation area.\nNote that although the stated working volume of the BD Microtainers is 250-500 μl, in our hands, guinea pig blood clots easily. You can largely overcome the clotting issue by limiting the amount of blood dispensed into each tube to 400 μl. However, observe the stated lower limit of 250 μl to prevent the EDTA concentration from becoming too high. Also, if blood is drawn from more than one animal, keep the blood on a rocker until it is time to process the samples.\nIf, by necessity, you are using more than one guinea pig to draw blood for the control samples, do not mix blood from different individuals in the same tube.\n17. Dispense 100 μl blood (∼106 WBC) into each of 17 flow tubes.

Add 2 ml of 1× lysing buffer to each flow tube and lightly vortex.",
    "For this step, have one team member add the lysing buffer and hand the tube off to a teammate to immediately vortex lightly. Speed and timing are essential.\n19. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 5 min. Add the tube from step 10f (reference control) to the test tube rack (no lysis buffer) with the blood during the incubation.\nThe incubation must be as close to 5 min as possible; too long, and the viability of the leukocytes is adversely affected; too short, and red cell lysis will not be optimal. During the incubation, place the tubes in the centrifuge so the centrifugation step can start immediately after the 5 min have elapsed.\n20. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g. Decant the supernatant and break the pellets (with two strikes).\nBreak the pellets by lightly dragging the base of each tube across an empty test tube rack. Each repetition is a “strike.” Do not drag the tubes along the same rack holding your samples, as this motion may disrupt the unbroken pellets in other tubes and result in cell loss when you decant those tubes.\n21.

Starting from step 24, all samples will be processed together for enhanced efficiency and reproducibility.",
    "When decanting cells (not beads) in step 23b(v), add an extra “bump” by inverting the tube to decant, raising it slightly, and flicking it back down while still inverted to get an additional drop out of the tube. This will reduce the volume to ∼80 μl for staining (step 13). This extra bump is only necessary at this step, as it is crucial to have the staining volume the same each time for better reproducibility; adding this bump at other decanting steps adds no value and will reduce cell recovery.\n24. Add 10 μl of 100% guinea pig serum to each tube to block Fc receptor and nonspecific binding of the antibody to the cells and mix by pipetting up and down.\nAssuming there is ∼80 μl residual volume after decanting in step 23b(v), the staining volume will ∼107 μl after addition of the antibody (step 27). When you titrate the antibodies, make sure the staining volume is ∼107 μl so that the titration will be valid.\n25. Incubate 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\n26.

    "In this protocol, we present a method to monitor leukocyte infiltration in guinea pig skin following the bite of a Rickettsia-infected tick, as previously described (Cross et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0011]). Infected ticks are placed on the guinea pig for an appropriate time (determined by pilot studies or previous research) and then skin biopsies are collected. The skin biopsies undergo enzymatic and mechanical dissociation followed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analysis. As with any light-sensitive experiment, it is important to process samples quickly and efficiently. We recommend working in a three-person team for this protocol to achieve the best results. For the reagent preparation calculations described below, we assume eight samples for the tissue dissociation steps (five experimental tissue samples, two blood samples for the FMO controls, and one reference control). After tissue dissociation, there are then 22 samples during the remaining sample preparation steps (five experimental, six FMO controls, six compensation controls, one unstained control, one unstained sample for the CD45 FMO preparation, one reference control, and two extras).\nMaterials\nLightning-Link PE-Cy7 Conjugate (Abcam ab102903)\nLightning-Link Rapid DyLight 405 Conjugate (D:405; Abcam ab201798)\nMix-n-Stain (CF594) Antibody Labeling Kit (Biotium 92236)\nMouse anti-Guinea Pig CD1b3 Antibody (Bio-Rad MCA566GA)\nMouse anti-Guinea Pig CD45 Antibody (Bio-Rad MCA1130)\nMouse anti-Human L1 Antibody (Bio-Rad MCA387)\nBovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma A3059-100G)\nCa2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Gibco 10-010-049)\nGibco RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red (Fisher 11-835-030)\nFetal bovine serum (FBS), heat inactivated (Atlanta Biologicals S11510H)\nGuinea pig serum (Sigma G9774-5ML)\nMulti Tissue Dissociation Kit 1 (Miltenyi 130-110-201)\nDNase I (ThermoFisher Scientific 18047-019)\nMagnesium chloride solution (Sigma 63069-100ML)\nGuinea pig splenocytes for use as a reference control (see Support Protocol 3)\nGentamicin solution (Sigma G1397-10ML)\nMACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi 130-100-008)\nNear-IR LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen L34976)",

    "1. Conjugate PE-Cy7 to Mouse anti-Guinea Pig CD1b3, DL405 to Mouse anti-Guinea Pig CD45, and CF594 to Mouse anti-Human L1.\nFollow manufacturer's instructions.\nThe Mouse anti-Human L1 antibody is cross-reactive to the guinea pig.\n2. Titrate all the antibodies to determine the optimal antibody concentrations, as described in Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0009], step 3.\nAfter performing serial dilutions on single-stained samples, you want to choose the concentration with optimal separation. Separation is described by the stain index (SI):\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} SI = \\frac{{MF{I_{positive\\,population}} \\; - \\; MF{I_{negative\\,population}}}}{{2 \\times rSD\\,negative\\,population}} \\end{equation*}\nwhere MFI is the median fluorescence intensity and rSD is the robust standard deviation. A higher SI value indicates increased separation; we have found that optimal concentrations are often lower than the manufacturer's recommended concentration, making the titration step important in reducing both costs and noise (background).\nWe perform the titrations using 20 µl of guinea pig peripheral blood per sample to minimize the number of tissue biopsies taken from the guinea pigs. The blood is subjected to the same enzymatic conditions as tissue dissociation.\n3. Prepare 1.0% (v/v) BSA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS (FMC-PBS), filter through a 0.1-µm filter, and store at 4°C.\n4. Prepare RPMI 1640 without phenol red + 5% FBS (cRPMI), filter through a 0.1-µm filter, and divide into 40-ml aliquots. Store at –20°C.\n5. Prepare and freeze 250-µl aliquots of guinea pig serum for blocking Fc receptors.\n6. Reconstitute enzymes in Multi Tissue Dissociation Kit 1 and divide into appropriate-sized aliquots for your experiment. Store at –20°C.\nFollow manufacturer's instructions to reconstitute Enzymes A, D, and R.",
    "Here, we will have eight dissociation samples, which will require 66 µl Enzyme A, 99 µl Enzyme D, and 242.88 µl Enzyme R. To ensure adequate volume, we recommend making 72-µl aliquots of Enzyme A, 108-µl aliquots of Enzyme D, and 255-µl aliquots of Enzyme R. Using these volumes, one dissociation kit will provide enough reagents for ten different eight-sample experiments.\nAfter speaking with the manufacturer, we determined that Enzyme A contains 100 U/ml DNase I, Enzyme D is collagenase, and Enzyme R is protease. Because Enzyme A is the limiting reagent, we decided to halve the concentration of Enzyme A in our enzyme cocktail and supplement this lost volume with DNase I from another vendor to increase the number of samples that we can process with a single kit.\n7. Prepare dilutions of supplemental DNase I. Store at –20°C.\nEach sample requires an additional 50 U/ml DNase I because we halve our 100 µl/ml concentration of Enzyme A. The exact volume to add to each sample is dependent on the concentration of each lot of DNase I.\nFor example, if the DNase I lot concentration is 168.1 U/µl, we would need:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} \\frac{{3{\\rm{\\;}}mL}}{{1{\\rm{\\;}}sample}}{\\rm{\\;}} \\times {\\rm{\\;}}\\frac{{50{\\rm{\\;}}U}}{{mL}}{\\rm{\\;}} \\times {\\rm{\\;}}\\frac{{\\mu L}}{{168.1{\\rm{\\;}}U}}{\\rm{\\;}} {=}^{{{\\;0.89{\\rm{\\;}}\\mu L{\\rm{\\;}}DNase{\\rm{\\;}}I}}}\\big/{{sample}} \\end{equation*}\nFor an eight-sample experiment, we need 7.83 µl DNase I. To ensure an adequate volume, we recommend adding 20% to account for any evaporation and pipetting errors that might occur with such a small volume. That will bring the aliquot volume up to 9.40 µl of DNase I.\n8. Prepare 72-µl aliquots of MgCl2. Store at –20°C.\nDNase I requires magnesium and calcium for full activity. Our DNase I reagent contains calcium, but no magnesium, in its storage buffer, so we supplement that here through the addition of MgCl2.",
    "9. Prepare aliquots of guinea pig splenocytes to use as reference controls.\nSee Support Protocol 3.\n10. Thaw 110 ml cRPMI (step 4).\nYou will need 26 ml for the enzyme cocktail and 80 ml to wash the MACS strainers, so thaw ∼110 ml. Thaw by placing at 4°C overnight.\n11. Add 0.1% (w/v) gentamicin to the MACS Tissue Storage Solution and prepare a 250-µl aliquot in separate microcentrifuge tubes for each sample.\nInclude gentamicin to prevent bacterial growth on the tissue samples while they are in the storage solution.\nImmediately before starting sample preparation\n12. Bring one vial of Near-IR LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell stain (Component A) and the vial of anhydrous DMSO (Component B; or Invitrogen D12345) to room temperature before removing the caps.\n13. Bring aliquots of cRPMI, Enzyme D, Enzyme R, Enzyme A, DNase I, MgCl2, and FCM-PBS to room temperature.\n14. Bring the guinea pig serum to room temperature. You will need 220 µl of serum (5 µl/sample × 22 samples: 5 experimental + 6 FMO controls + 2 unstained controls + 1 reference control + 6 compensation controls + 2 extra) × 2 (for surface and intracellular staining).\n15. Prepare 6.0 ml lysing buffer (2 ml/sample × 3 samples: 2 experimental + 1 extra) from 10× stock solution of BD Pharm Lyse Lysing Buffer.\n         \nDilute 0.6 ml of 10× solution to 6.0 ml with 5.4 ml cell culture water.\nWarm the 1× solution to room temperature.\nCheck the pH of the 1× solution. The pH should fall within the range of 7.1-7.4.",
    "16. Prepare 10 ml of 2% formaldehyde solution (1.0 ml/sample × 19 samples: 5 experimental + 6 FMO controls + 1 unstained control + 1 reference control + 5 compensation controls + 1 extra) by diluting 2.4 ml methanol-free 16% formaldehyde solution with 16.6 ml PBS (protein-free). Keep at 4°C until ready to use.\nYou can keep left-over formaldehyde at –20°C for 3 days.\nThe sample number drops from 22 to 29 here because we will remove the LIVE/DEAD viability compensation control from the workflow before fixation, the unstained population of cells for the CD45 FMO will have been added to the stained CD45 FMO population, and the number of extras has dropped from two to one.\n17. Prepare 152 ml of 1× permeabilization wash buffer (2.0 ml/sample × 4 washes × 19 samples (5 experimental + 6 FMO controls + 1 unstained control + 1 reference control + 5 compensation controls + 1 extra) by diluting 15.2 ml of 10× Intracellular Staining Permeabilization Wash Buffer with 136.8 ml Millipore water.\n18. Thaw splenocytes for reference control (5 × 106 cells).\n         \na.Prewarm cRPMI to 37°C.\nb.Thaw cryovial at 37°C for 1.5-2 min; flick vial with a finger every few seconds.\nc.Dropwise (over 30 s), add ∼1 ml prewarmed cRPMI to the cryovial and then transfer contents to a 15-ml centrifuge tube containing 8 ml of prewarmed cRPMI.\nAll centrifugation steps are performed at room temperature.\nd.Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g. Decant the supernatant.\ne.Add 4.8 ml prewarmed cRPMI (gives ∼5 ml total volume) and gently resuspend the pellet. Then transfer 1 ml (∼1 × 106 cells) to a flow tube (keep the other 4 ml in a separate flow tube as extra).\nf.Remove cells for counting and keep the rest at 37°C until needed (step 19).",
    "Mix splenocytes in the flow tubes gently by pipetting up and down. Take 100 μl of splenocytes from the center of suspension from the extra tube and place them into a 1.50ml microcentrifuge tube.\ng.Add 5 μl propidium iodide staining solution to the 100 μl of splenocytes and mix gently. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 7 min.\nh.Load a Cell Counter Chamber Slide with 10 μl (each side) of the stained splenocytes using a 20-μl pipet. Let settle for 1 min before reading.\ni.Take two readings (one from each side of the chamber slide) on the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter. Take an average of the two readings and record the cell count and viability.\nSet the light source on the cell counter to “RFP.”\nThe Reference Control comes from one animal at a single time point. Therefore, it should generate consistent results between time points and thus provide assay-specific quality control (QC) by controlling for run-to-run variation in sample processing and staining. Although often left out of longitudinal studies, this control gives confidence that results in the experimental samples are due to the “treatment” rather than instrument, technical, or analysis variability between runs.\n19. Once at room temperature, filter the cRPMI through a 0.2-µm filter using a 60-ml syringe.\n20. Prepare the following enzyme cocktail in a 50-ml tube and mix by gently inverting the tube 10-12 times. The final cocktail should contain 0.25% Enzyme A, 0.375% Enzyme D, 0.920% Enzyme R, and an additional 50 U/ml DNase I.\n         \na.25,918.2 µl cRPMI (2945.25 µl × 8.8 samples)\nb.66 µl MgCl2 (7.50 µl × 8.8 samples)\nc.66 µl Enzyme A (7.50 µl × 8.8 samples)\nd.99 µl Enzyme D (11.25 µl × 8.8 samples)\ne.242.88 µl Enzyme R (27.60 µl × 8.8 samples)",

Warm the remaining cRPMI to 37°C (for use in step 43).\n23. Prepare antibody dilutions and store them on ice in the dark.\n         \nAnti-CD8:FITC is used at 1:1600. Hence, for accurate pipetting, make 64 μl of 1:16 dilution by adding 4 μl of antibody to 60 μl FCM-PBS. You will dilute this further in the antibody cocktail and FMOs.\nAnti-CD45:DL405 is used at 1:160. Hence, for accurate pipetting, make 16 μl of 1:1.6 dilution by adding 10 μl of antibody to 6 μl FCM-PBS. You will dilute this further in the cocktail and FMOs.\nAnti-CF594:L1 is used at 1:800. Hence, for accurate pipetting, make 64 μl of 1:16 dilution by adding 4 μl of antibody to 60 μl FCM-PBS; 2 μl of 1:16 in 100 μl = 1:800. You will dilute this further during intracellular staining.\nStart sample preparation\n24. Draw ∼500 µl of blood from the jugular vein of one guinea pig using a 1-ml syringe with a 25-G, 5/8-inch needle. Dispense ∼350 µl of blood into each of two BD Microtainers, cap the tubes, and invert several times to mix the EDTA with the blood. Place EDTA tube with blood on a tube revolver/rotator at room temperature while you collect tissue samples.\nYou will only need 200 µl of blood for the unstained and FMO controls, but we've found that guinea pig blood clots easily, so we collect an extra tube of blood in case clotting prevents the use of one tube.",
    "25. Take a 4-mm skin-punch biopsy from each guinea pig at the site of a tick bite. Place each biopsy in 250 µl of MACS Tissue Storage Solution in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Transport blood and tissue to the sample preparation area and store at room temperature.\nYou may want to include one skin biopsy taken from an area without a tick bite as one of your five samples as a negative control. This negative control should show minimal leukocyte infiltration.\n26. Transfer 100 µl blood (∼106 leukocytes) into each of two flow tubes.\n27. Add 2 ml of 1× lysing buffer (from step 15) to each flow tube and lightly vortex.\n28. Incubate the tubes 5 min at room temperature.\nThis incubation should be as close to 5 min as possible to achieve optimal lysis of the red blood cells while maintaining high leukocyte viability. To ensure precise timing, place the tubes in the centrifuge during the incubation so the centrifugation in the next step can begin immediately after 5 min have elapsed.\n29. Centrifuge for 5 min at 350 × g. Decant the supernatant and break the pellet (two strikes).\nBreak the pellets by lightly dragging the base of each tube across an empty test tube rack. Each repetition is one “strike.” Do not drag the tubes along the same rack holding your samples, as this motion may disrupt the unbroken pellets in other tubes and result in cell loss when you decant those tubes.\nAt this point, it is necessary to break the workflow up into two teams. Have one person complete the lysis (steps 30-31) while two people begin mincing the tissue biopsies (step 33) simultaneously. This arrangement ensures that all your samples (tissue and blood) will be ready for dissociation simultaneously.",
    "30. Wash the lysed cells by adding 3 ml PBS (protein-free) and centrifuging for 5 min at 350 × g. Decant the supernatant with a “bump” and break the pellet (2 strikes).\nAdd a bump to this decanting step by inverting the tube to decant, raising it slightly, and flicking the tube back down while still inverted to get an additional drop out of the tube. This is necessary to achieve a reproducible, lower volume for staining. Adding this bump at decanting steps where it is not called for adds no value and will lead to lower cell recovery.\n31. Bring the volume of each tube of lysed cells to exactly 100 µl with PBS (protein-free) and pool the two samples.\n32. Bring the vial of Viability Dye Compensation Standard beads to room temperature while end-over-end mixing on the tube revolver/rotator.\nDo not leave the vial of beads at room temperature for >25-35 min before preparation (step 40).\n33. Mince each 4-mm punch biopsy into ∼15 small pieces using a scalpel (Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-fig-0013]).\nIf the biopsy is bloody, swirl the sample in fresh PBS before mincing to wash off the blood.\nMince all five tissue samples before moving to the next step. All samples must enter the enzyme solution simultaneously, so they are under dissociation conditions for the same length of time. If you have an experiment that requires more than eight dissociation tubes, we recommend staggering the samples from this point onward. Start mincing samples 25 min apart and bring each sample through step 44 (then store at 4°C) until you have dissociated all tissue. This strategy will ensure that no sample gets exposed to the enzyme solution for longer than any other sample.",
    "If a minced tissue sample starts to dry out while you are mincing other samples, add a few drops of PBS to keep it hydrated.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f985094f-2bda-4cdc-8a14-9b77516c422e/cpz1584-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nMince 4-mm guinea pig skin biopsies into ∼15 pieces.\n34. Transfer each tissue sample into a separate C Tube containing the enzyme cocktail simultaneously.\n35. Transfer 100 µl lysed blood from step 31 to each of two C Tubes.\n36. Transfer the reference control cells into an eighth C Tube.\n37. Tightly close each C Tube until it clicks into place. Attach each C Tube upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Dissociator, and then attach a heating unit over each tube.\nEnsure the tissue samples are submerged in the enzyme solution and not stuck to a wall of the C Tube. Flick and tap the C Tube to bring any tissue pieces down into the enzyme solution.\nMake sure you keep the tubes and heating units vertical when adding them to, or removing them from, the dissociator. Adding or removing the tubes or heating units at an angle may damage the instrument.\n38. Run the gentleMACS pre-loaded program titled “37C_Multi_A_01” for the full 41 min. Continue to the next step while the program is running.\nCheck samples every 3 min to ensure the tissue remains in the enzyme solution, not stuck to a wall. It is common for tissue pieces to be flung out of the solution during periods of accelerated rotation during the program.\nDo not turn the instrument off while a program is running—this will cause extensive damage to the instrument. Pausing the instrument and removing the tubes to get sample back in (but without shutting off the instrument) is fine.",
    "39. Immediately after beginning the program, prepare the Near-IR LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell stain (see step 12) by adding 100 µl of DMSO to the vial of reactive dye. Mix well and visually confirm that all the dye has dissolved. Protect from light.\nPrepare the LIVE/DEAD stain ∼1 hr before staining.\n40. After 20 min of the dissociation program has elapsed, prepare the Viability Dye Compensation Standard beads as follows.\n         \nPlace two drops of beads in a flow tube designated for Near-IR LIVE/DEAD and another three drops in a tube for a negative population.\nWash both tubes by adding 0.5 ml PBS (protein-free), vortexing lightly, and centrifuging 5 min at 350 × g.

    "This protocol describes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for monitoring the immune response in guinea pigs to rickettsial infection (Alugubelly et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0001]). The principal advantages of this assay over the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) are that it is quantitative rather than semi-quantitative, more objective, and more suitable for high-throughput studies or diagnostics. With regard to objectivity, where an IFA titer might be reported at 128, an ELISA readout will provide an exact titer; the titer of 128 from the IFA—presumably negative at 256—might be reported as 225 by ELISA, i.e., much closer to 256 than the 128 reported by IFA. Additionally, the ELISA reliably quantifies positives down to a titer of 75, which would be considered negative by IFA. However, in our hands, a titer of 75 is always greater than the optical density (OD) of the negative + 5 SD, which suggests approximately one chance in a million of a false-positive of a sample that falls within the standard curve (75-1200). Suppose a clinician needs a simple determination of positivity; in that case, this can be obtained with high confidence, albeit non-quantitatively, from a result falling outside the standard curve (<75) by observing the OD negative + 3 SD rule. Considering objectivity, we know that a plate reader is more objective than a human, who may or may not be well-trained and highly experienced and is potentially more prone to error. Finally, using 96-well plates and an automated reader will provide higher throughput.\nOne person can perform most of the experiment. To aid in understanding the calculations we use, we are taking a 96-well plate ELISA as our template for this protocol and adding a few “extra” wells to ensure that we have an adequate volume of reagents needed to perform the experiment.\nMaterials",

First, perform the IFA using standard doubling dilutions, except instead of 32, 64, 128,…, etc. dilution factors, use 50, 100, 200,…. etc., as you will use the controls for an ELISA assay. Next, after you have obtained a rough estimate—for example, 800 is positive, and 1600 is negative—conduct the assay again at a finer resolution; in this example: dilutions of 800, 900, 1000,…, 1600. As before, the result should be positive at 800 and negative at 1600, but you will now know the titer to the nearest 100—for example, positive at 1400 but negative at 1500.

To ensure precise timing, follow this procedure for every assay that you perform regardless—even when only a few wells are involved.\nTurn on the plate reader when there is 15-20 min left in incubation (as it needs a 20-min warmup).\n22. Stop the reaction by adding 100 μl stop solution to each well.

    "Here we describe the preparation of rickettsial antigen for, and antigen coating of, ELISA plates for Basic Protocol 8. The protocol is written for use with the BSL-2 SFGR, R. parkeri, and should be modified appropriately for a BSL-3 SFGR. We use whole-cell rickettsiae for ELISA for plating, grown in Vero cells, and collected by mechanical disruption. We recommend following protocols as in Ammerman et al. to grow SFGR (Ammerman et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0003]).\nCAUTION: Perform all activities involving handling infectious materials at the proper biosafety level conditions for the bacteria cultured (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-prot-0001]).\nMaterials\nR. parkeri or other BSL-2 SFGR\nVero cells\nTissue-culture-treated 75-ml vented flasks (Fisher 13-680-65 or equivalent)\nMillipore water (0.2 µm filtered)\n5× ELISA Coating Buffer (Bio-Rad BUF030A)\nELISA Ultrablock (Bio-Rad BUF033A)\nBacterial Viability Kit (Invitrogen L7012)\nTube Revolver/Rotator (Thermo Scientific 88881001) or equivalent\nClass II biosafety cabinet\nSharps container\nCell scraper, sterile (Fisher 08-771-1A or equivalent)\n1-, 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-ml serological pipets\n50-ml Luer-Lok syringes without needle (Fisher 13-689-8 or equivalent)\n27-G, 1/2-inch needles (Fisher 14-826-48 or equivalent)\n25-G, 5/8-inch needle (Fisher 14-826AA or equivalent)\n18-G, 3-inch needles (Fisher 14-821-16R or equivalent)\nWhatman Swin-Lock Plastic Filter Holder, autoclaved (Fisher 09-927-168)\nNucleopore Track-etched Membrane Filters, 3.0 µm, 47 mm (Fisher 09-800-917)\nPetroff-Hausser counting chamber (Fisher 02-671-51B) or equivalent\nELISA Reagent Reservoir (Fisher PI15075) or equivalent\nELISA Strips (plates)\nSlightly Hydrophilic Immuno Clear Standard Modules (Thermo Scientific, 467120)\nSealing tape for 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific 15036)\nIn the week(s) before starting\n1.

    "2. Determine the total number of bacteria needed to seed wells with 5 × 107 rickettsiae per well and thus the total number of T75 flasks needed to achieve that goal.\nDetermining the total number of bacteria needed will require knowing how many strips or plates are desired; extra wells are added in for good measure. It does not hurt to have several extra flasks growing as a precaution in the event of contamination. A formula for calculating number of bacteria needed for a 96-well plate would look like: 5 × 107 rickettsiae per well × (96 wells + 4 extra wells).\nImmediately before starting\n3. Prepare 1× coating buffer, making 33.0 ml for each set of eight strips, or 96 wells (96 coated wells + 14 extra wells = 110 wells × 0.1 ml = 11.0 ml total × 3 plates = 33.0 ml total), by diluting 6.6 ml of 5× ELISA Coating Buffer to 33.0 ml with 26.4 ml Millipore water.\n4. Leave mixing on the end-over-end mixer until use.\nHarvesting rickettsiae\n5. Harvest SFGR-infected Vero cells in a Class II biosafety cabinet that contains the required materials, including a small sharps container. Use a cell scraper or serological pipet to scrape and blow off, respectively, SFGR-infected Vero cells from the T75 flask(s) into culture medium.\nIt requires multiple flasks to generate sufficient antigen for coating strips, depending on the number of strips needed. However, balance the numbers with the manageability of the flasks. We found that five to eight flasks were manageable for producing one to three 96-well plates (12-36 eight-well strips). We recommend replacing the medium 1 day before harvesting and then harvesting cells within the medium, so that the suspension contains only free rickettsiae released within the last day.",
    "6. Transfer suspension(s) to appropriately sized tubes (e.g., 50 ml)\nThe number of tubes needed will depend on the number of flasks. One T75 flask will hold ∼15 ml medium, so plan accordingly.\n7. Set up a 50-ml syringe (plunger removed) with a 25-G, 5/8-inch needle over a fresh 50-ml tube and transfer suspension to the syringe. Replace the plunger and pass suspension through to mechanically rupture host cells.\n8. Draw up the suspension with an 18-G, 3-inch needle on a 50-ml syringe, carefully replace the needle with a 27-G, 1/2 inch needle, and repeat the host cell rupture.\n9. Centrifuge the 50-ml tube(s) with the suspension for 10 min at 1000 × g to pellet the cellular debris.\n10. Transfer the suspension to a 50-ml syringe (with the plunger removed) attached to a holder with a Nucleopore 3-µm filter sitting over a fresh 50-ml tube and filter passively into the tube.\nAll centrifugation steps are performed at room temperature.\nThis process catches cellular debris in the filter while allowing rickettsiae to pass through the membrane, creating a solution enriched with rickettsiae; you can assist the passive filtration process by gently replacing the plunger when most of the liquid has been filtered and applying a small amount of pressure to complete the process. Be aware that firm pressure will allow more cellular material through the membrane.\n11. Aliquot 1-1.2 ml of suspension into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes while continually mixing the solution by pipetting up and down.\nIf an ultracentrifuge that holds ultra-high-speed 15-ml or 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes is available, use these instead of 1.5-ml tubes.",
    "12. Centrifuge 10 min at 12,000 × g and combine pellets into one tube. Repeat centrifugation, and then wash pellet three times with PBS by resuspending and then centrifuging 10 min at 12,000 × g each time.\n13. Make 1 ml each of 1:100 and 1:1000 dilutions of enriched rickettsial suspension in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes for Live/Dead staining and counting using the Bacterial Viability Kit. Place the remainder of the rickettsial suspension in a 56°C water bath for 60 min to heat-kill the bacteria.\nYou may use a 1:100 or 1:1000 dilution; however, a 1:1000 dilution is more commonly used for counting because of the high concentration of rickettsiae.\n14. Load a Petroff-Hauser counting chamber for total bacterial count under epifluorescence.\n15. For seeding the ELISA plate, use the volume of rickettsiae needed (determined before starting the protocol) to achieve a number for seeding and centrifuge that volume for 10 min at 12,000 × g to pellet the rickettsiae.\n16. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in freshly prepared 1× coating buffer to achieve the desired concentration. Mix on end-over-end mixer for 5-15 min.\n17. Transfer the suspension to an ELISA reagent reservoir and use a multichannel pipet to aliquot 100 µl into each well of Slightly Hydrophilic Immuno Clear Standard Modules.\nPipet up and down three or four times before dispensing each aliquot to mix sufficiently to achieve consistent bacterial cell numbers.\n18. Incubate the plate(s) at 4°C overnight; protect the plate from light and cover with sealing tape to prevent evaporation.\nDay 2: Washing antigen-coated plates",
    "19. Before starting, prepare 275.0 ml of 1× wash buffer for each set of eight strips, or 96 wells (96 coated + 20 extra = 116 wells × 3 plates × 0.3 ml/wash × 2 washes = 208.8 ml total + 60 ml [for dead space at bottom of automatic plate washer] = 268.8 ml), by diluting 27.5 ml of 10× ELISA Wash Buffer to 275.0 ml with 247.5 ml Millipore water.\n20. Dump the coating buffer in the plate(s) from step 18 by flicking the plate(s) over a sink and then tapping the plate(s) upside down on absorbent paper.\n21. Wash plate(s) twice with the plate washer with 300 µl of 1× wash buffer.\n22. Examine a strip under an inverted microscope to visualize antigen (rickettsiae) on wells.\nPerform this step quickly—before the strips dry.\n23. Block nonspecific binding by adding 200 µl Ultrablock to each well. Cover the plate(s) with sealing tape, place foil over it to protect from light, and incubate at room temperature overnight (24-26 hr)\nDay 3: Final plate processing\n24. Dump the Ultrablock from step 23 by flicking the plate(s) into the sink and tapping the plate(s) upside down on absorbent paper.\n25. Dry the plate(s) in the biosafety cabinet (fan on, lights off) for 2-3 hr.\n26. Place the strips in a sealed plastic bag or storage cabinet with desiccant and protected from light; store dried for up to 1 year at 4°C.\nWe recommend testing a positive with a known titer every month to confirm the stability of plates.",
    "Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) are used to monitor the guinea pig's immune response to rickettsial infection by detecting antibodies against Rickettsia spp. Although we typically assess multiple serum samples over a longitudinal study to monitor the development of an immune response, it is crucial to include a timepoint before placing ticks on the guinea pigs or before inoculation with infectious agents to collect baseline data. Following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for human diagnostics, we recommended waiting at least 14 days after exposure or infestation to evaluate seroconversion in guinea pigs.\nFirst, you process samples by applying pre-diluted sera from test animals onto antigen-coated slides. Next, add a fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody against the guinea pig IgG in the sera. Then, evaluate the results through fluorescence microscopy to quantify the immune response. Finally, results are reported as the final titer (dilution) at which you detect specific fluorescence for a sample. Titers corresponding to dilutions are reported as the reciprocal of the dilution: e.g., if the highest dilution with a positive result is 1/128, then the titer is reported as 128. Alternatively, some people define the titer to be 1:128; but we will use 128 for this protocol.\nCAUTION: Perform all activities involving handling infectious materials at the proper biosafety level conditions for the bacteria cultured.\nMaterials\nRickettsia spp.\nCa2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Gibco 10-010-049)\nSodium azide (CAS 26628-22-8)\nBovine serum albumin (BSA), gamma-globulin free (Sigma A7030)\nEriochrome black T powder (CAS 1787-61-7)\nDeionized water (in house system or commercially available)\nAcetone (CAS 67-64-1)\nAnti-Guinea Pig IgG (H+L) Antibody, FITC-Labeled (Sera Care 5230-0303)\nGoat Serum Donor Herd (Sigma G6767)\nGlycerol (CAS 56-81-5)\nDABCO (CAS 280-57-9)\nGuinea pig serum (at least 40 μl per sample)\nCoverslip sealant (Biotium 23005 or equivalent)",

Shell vial culture is not an appropriate technique for generating suitable amounts of material to coat IFA slides. Most cell types necessary for the culture of Rickettsia are appropriate for antigen slide production.\nCAUTION: Perform all activities involving handling infectious materials at the proper biosafety level conditions for the bacteria cultured.\n2. Propagate Rickettsiae to a suitable infection level.\nWe define a suitable infection level as confluent monolayers with at least an 85% infection level. If the culture is allowed to progress too far, cytopathic effects (cell lysis) can occur, lowering the quality of antigen for slide production due to lower whole cell content.\n3. Add 5-mm-diameter sterile glass beads to the culture flask to remove the monolayer.\nGently rock the glass beads along the monolayer to avoid unnecessary destruction of cells.\n4.

    "There are a variety of options available for the inactivation of antigen stocks. The methodology used should be based on the lab's capabilities and include an in-house verification of the method. Inactivation methods reported as effective include formalin-inactivation, acetone fixation, and gamma-cell irradiation (Eisenberg & Osterman, 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0012]; Frickmann & Dobler, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0014]; McDade, Black, Roumillat, Redus, & Spruill, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0024]). Acetone fixation as an inactivation step may be preferable as it is already part of the IFA workflow. If you use the acetone fixation method, perform subsequent steps (10-15) under appropriate biosafety conditions until you confirm inactivation.\nApply antigen stocks to slides immediately or store in 1 ml aliquots in polypropylene screw-cap tubes at –80°C. When removing frozen stocks to coat IFA slides, thaw antigen in a water bath at 37°C before use.\n10. Clean blank glass or Teflon-coated slides with a microfiber cloth or Kimwipes.\nThis step is to remove dust or flaked off Teflon that will impact the adhesion of antigen to the slides.\n11. Apply 3 µl of antigen (from step 9) with a micropipet or capillary tube to a single well.\nTry to apply in the center of the well and not cover more than half the well.\n12. Observe the concentration of cells under an inverted microscope before the well dries.\n         \na.If there are too many cells, dilute the antigen with antigen diluent and reassess the number of cells until you determine an appropriate concentration is present.\nb.If there are too few cells, centrifuge the antigen for 10 min at 1000 × g, room temperature, remove supernatant, and resuspend in a smaller volume of antigen diluent.\nThe well should not be overpopulated with cells (clustered heavily throughout the well and difficult to differentiate individual cells) or underpopulated (difficult to find cells close together).",
    "13. Aliquot 3 µl of appropriately diluted antigen to each well on slides.\nGently vortex antigen periodically to ensure consistency.\n14. Allow the slides to dry for at least 2 hr.\nWe recommend using a desiccator for at least one hour of the drying process.\n15. Place slides into a slide staining chamber or Coplin jar and fix in acetone for 15 min.\nThe fixation time may vary if using this as the inactivation step but should be at least 15 min.\n16. Remove slides and allow to air dry.\nYou can use the finished IFA slides immediately. For storage, place the slides in a slide box wrapped in Parafilm and then in a sealable plastic bag containing a desiccant pack at –80°C.\n17.

Determine the optimal dilution of the anti-guinea pig IgG-FITC conjugate using a checkerboard titration.\nUse a positive control sample with a known endpoint titer and negative control to assess the appropriate conjugate dilution in the checkerboard. We provide a supplemental form with a standard checkerboard setup to illustrate this process (Supplemental File[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#support-information-section]). The appropriate working stock will exhibit a positive control with an endpoint titer within one twofold dilution from the previously confirmed endpoint titer of the positive control. The negative control serum needs to be nonreactive at the accepted working concentration indicated by the positive control titer. Follow manufacturer's instructions for initial resuspension of lyophilized conjugate and storage conditions. Dilute conjugate with IFA buffer (see Reagents and Solutions) to create working stock concentrations for assessment in the checkerboard.",

Warm the IFA slides to room temperature before use.\nUse a desiccator if the humidity in the room is high.\n21. Thaw test and control sera and vortex briefly.\nInclude a positive control with a known endpoint titer and negative control in each run (NOT each slide). We recommend a positive control with an endpoint titer of ∼512 to make diluting to the endpoint more space and time efficient.\n22. Aliquot an appropriate amount of IFA buffer into buffer reservoir for use in steps 23 and 24.\nFor each slide, expect to use ∼2 ml of IFA buffer per plate if utilizing the setup outlined below.\n23.

We use the 1/16 system throughout this protocol.\nThe necessary starting volume will depend on how many assays or replicates you plan to use for assessment. For a single assay run, a standard dilution setup for a 1/16 dilution is 5 µl sera + 75 µl IFA buffer (see recipe).\nd.Load serum samples into appropriate wells to make 1/16 dilutions of all samples.",
    "Make the 1/16 dilutions in a 96-well U- or V-bottom plate for immediate use. Keep the plate refrigerated and covered (for example, with aluminum foil). Use within 2 hr, as the antibody will bind to the plate if left too long.\nAlthough you should avoid this for longer-term storage, it is possible to make the 1/16 dilutions in polypropylene screw-cap tubes. The diluted serum will be stable at 4°C for at least 1 month. You can also freeze these dilutions for long-term storage. Higher dilutions of antibodies are not stable, so we do not recommend further dilution until the day of use.\n24. Prepare the remaining dilutions of test and control sera, pipet mixing all samples throughout step 24.\n         \na.For the positive control: Dilute to the known endpoint titer; see step 24c for suggested mixing volumes. Always assess positive controls using twofold serial dilutions to the endpoint titer.\nb.If screening serum: Make 1/256 dilutions of test sera in the same 96-well plate by aliquoting 5 µl of the 1/16 dilution into a new well with 75 µl of IFA buffer.\nUse this process to assess where it is logical to start the endpoint titration. If a sample is positive at 1/16 and not 1/256 in the screen, you only need to evaluate dilutions 1/16 through 1/128 in a subsequent run. If a sample is positive at 1/256, then the subsequent endpoint titration should begin at 1/256 to save time and slide space.\nc.If titrating to the endpoint: Dilute the test sera samples using twofold dilutions by aliquoting 35 µl of the previous dilution with 35 µl of IFA Buffer into a fresh well.\nPlate templates with suggested volumes to generate for both the screening and endpoint titer setups described in step 23 are provided in Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-tbl-0004].",

    "29. Spray the slides with PBS from a wash bottle to remove sera.\nSpraying too forcefully and directly onto wells may damage the antigen substrate, leading to poor results. Spray gently and indirectly, allowing the PBS to trickle across the wells and remove serum samples.\n30. Place slides into a slide staining dish filled with PBS and containing a magnetic stir bar.\nThe PBS should completely cover all slide wells.\n31. Place the slides onto a magnetic stirrer and wash the slides with the stir bar at 60 rpm for 5 min.\n32. Gently decant the PBS.\nKeep the slides stable in the jar by placing one hand on the top edge of the slides while decanting. Do not disturb the wells.\n33. Repeat steps 31 and 32 for a second wash.\n34. Dilute the anti-guinea pig-FITC conjugate to the predetermined working concentration using IFA Buffer.\nUse a light-proof centrifuge tube to protect the light-sensitive fluorophore. You can perform this step after the second wash or during the third wash. Prepare enough conjugate to dot 10 µl onto each well. For a 32-well slide, 320 µl is necessary, plus extra for pipetting errors. Do not vortex the stock or diluted conjugate.\n35. Centrifuge the diluted conjugate for 5 min at 10,000 × g, room temperature.\nYou can leave the diluted conjugate at room temperature in the centrifuge until needed.\n36. Repeat steps 31 and 32 for a third wash.\n37. Remove slides from the staining dish after the third wash and tap the edges against a paper towel to remove excess PBS.\n38. Allow the Teflon of the slides to air dry.\nDo not allow the wells of the slides to dry, as this will damage affixed samples.",
    "39. Apply 10 µl of the conjugate to each well of all slides.\n40. Place the slides into the humidified chamber.\n41. Place humidified chamber into an incubator at 37°C, 0% CO2 for 30 min.\nThe incubator or the humidified container should be lightproof during this stage to minimize damage to the conjugate.\n42. Remove the slides from the incubator.\n43. Remove the slides from the humidified container.\n44. Spray the slides with PBS from a wash bottle to remove sera.\nSpraying too forcefully and directly onto wells may damage the antigen substrate, leading to poor results. Spray gently and indirectly, allowing the PBS to trickle across the wells and remove serum samples.\n45. Place the slides into a slide staining dish containing a magnetic stir bar and filled with PBS.\nPBS should completely cover all slide wells.\n46. Place slides onto a stirrer and wash the slides with the stir bar set at 60 rpm for 5 min.\n47. Gently decant the PBS.\n48. Fill slide staining dish with PBS for a second wash.\n49. Add 600 µl of 1.65% Eriochrome T counterstain per 150 ml of PBS to the center of the dish.\n50. Place the slides onto a stirrer and wash the slides with the stir bar on at 60 rpm for 5 min.\n51. Decant wash buffer.\nPlace the PBS containing counterstain into the hazardous waste; do not decant it down the sink.\n52. Fill the staining dish with PBS and perform a third wash at 60 rpm for 5 min.\n53. Decant wash buffer.\n54. Remove the slides and tap the edges of the slides against a paper towel to remove excess PBS.\n55. Allow slides to air dry.",
    "Allow the Teflon to dry completely. Allow the antigen-coated wells to partially dry. The slides can be waved around to shake off excess PBS—the samples should be firmly affixed to slides at this point.\n56. Add a small drop (covering approximately one-third of the well) of mounting medium to each well of every slide.\nThis solution contains glycerol and is thick—using a dropper-style bottle is conducive to application. Do not touch the tip of the dropper to the antigen substrate.\nIf you add too much mounting medium, the slide cover applied in the next step may float off. An additional issue caused by excess mounting medium is poor visualization of cells on slides due to a hazy appearance that makes the slides unreadable. You can resolve these issues by floating off the coverslip and mounting medium with a PBS wash and reapplying the medium in smaller amounts.\n57. Apply a coverslip to each slide, ensuring that all the wells are covered.\nApply the coverslip by gently dropping it onto the slide from a 45° angle, rather than from a parallel position immediately over the slide.\nAs an optional step, seal the slides with fingernail polish or a commercially available slide sealant to prevent movement of the coverslip.\n58. Place slides into a light-proof container (such as a slide folder) and allow them to settle for at least 15 min at 2-8°C.\nAs the fluorescence level is stable, you can leave the samples can overnight before assessing the result.\n59. Examine the slides under a UV fluorescent light source at 40× magnification.\nVisualization is significantly easier in a room with no external light source (windows) and the overhead lights off.",
    "60. Confirm that the negative control and any wells containing only conjugate are negative, and the positive control is within the expected range.\nNegative wells will show only the dim red counterstain and diffuse greenish background fluorescence caused by nonspecific binding to host cells. Confirm that the positive control is within one twofold dilution factor of the expected titer (e.g., if the expected titer is 1024, the reported titer should be between 512 and 2048). Positive wells will show individual organisms fluorescing as discrete, bright green specks within the cell cytoplasm and surrounding lysed cells.\n61. Read the results for experimental wells after ensuring that controls have expected outcomes.\nBased on the CDC SFR Case definition for humans, IFA titers ≥128 are considered presumptive evidence of infection (CDC, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.584#cpz1584-bib-0010])."
