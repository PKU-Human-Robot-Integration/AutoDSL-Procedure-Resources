We recorded almost all known interactions, and classify them into six interaction types: allopreening, aggression, allofeeding, playing, proximal foraging and scrounging. These interaction types included more than 99% percent of all recorded interactions. More information about the interaction types is in our corresponding paper (Dragić et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). During the creation of the protocol, we used previous studies and tried several options before forming the final ethogram. Here are a few universal steps for deciding which interactions to collect:\nDefine interactions as directed or undirected.\nNote: Directed interactions have an actor and a receiver in each interaction. For example, in aggression, there is an actor (the “attacker”) and a receiver (the “victim”).\nNote: Directed networks are more informative than undirected ones and can always be transformed into undirected networks.\nWe used the gambit of the group method to record associations in groups as undirected edges (Franks et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nDefine interactions precisely to avoid sampling errors.\nTest for correlations between different networks.\nNote: See the script “Testing correlation between matrices using QAP” in Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2126-Mmc1.pdf] for more information.\nNote: If networks are correlated, the interactions probably have a similar biological function, or one of them is directly caused by the other. The correlation and interchangeability between networks can be tested using matrix correlation tests (Farine, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) or permutations (Farine and Whitehead, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; van der Marel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]).",
    "Note: Testing the correlation of matrices can sometimes give inconclusive results, especially if the study species’ animals live in small groups. For example, in our study allofeeding and dominance display had a strong correlation in some groups (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). However, the two interactions had a different biological functions which we could see in changes in interaction patterns (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In addition, the two interactions were clearly defined in previous studies (Zahavi, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]) and easy to distinguish in the field. The similarities probably came from the unidirectional nature of both interactions, where the actor is always a higher-ranked individual.\nOmit rare interactions from the analysis. Sparse graphs can be noisy and produce inaccurate results (Farine and Whitehead, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2126_1.csv\nValues in the table present P values calculated using Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). If one of the adjacency matrices is empty (no interactions) or almost empty (< 90%) the correlation was not calculated (NA).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2126-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cybertracker application windows\nThe top row contains “START”, “STOP”, and “PAUSE” commands, which were used to mark the beginning and the end of semi-focal observation. In case of losing sight of the focal individual, the observation was paused. The individuals were listed in the following window.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2126-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Seasonal variation in aggression and allofeeding\nDominance display and allofeeding social networks of the same group. The thickness of edges represents the number of interactions between individuals. Arrows represent direction of interactions. While in some cases these two interaction types can have similar interaction patterns, they have different functions, and therefore their frequency can vary between seasons.",
    "Note: While recording as many interactions as possible could be beneficial, animal social networks give the best results with clearly defined and abundant interaction types. For example, an interaction called morning dance (Zahavi, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]) occurred only in some groups. Since it could not be joined to any other interaction type, morning dance was excluded from the analysis.\nSemi-focal observations\nTiming: 6–12 months\nTraditionally, behavioral observations follow two types of data collection: focal observations and all occurrences of behavior in the group (Altmann, 1974[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). However, groups of Arabian babblers are mostly compact, and it is possible to observe and record the interactions of 4–8 individuals at any moment. If we recorded only interactions of only one individual we would “lose” the majority of observed behavior. Altmann (1974)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] suggested that predetermined subgroups of individuals can be observed, but babbler movement was hard to predict and hence it was difficult to define a predetermined group. Our solution was semi-focal observations, where the subgroup was determined by the distance to the focal individual. During the semi-focal observations, we recorded all interactions involving the focal individual as well as interactions involving all individuals in a ∼10 meters radius.\nDetermine duration of sampling time.\nNote: Depending on the species, focal observations can last from a few minutes (Coleman and Wilson, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Manson, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Stahl et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]) up to 14 h for focal observation of groups (Ruckstuhl, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nNote: Our sampling time was ten minutes. There was no exact reasoning for ten minutes focal observations, but it allowed us to observe each individual in an average group once before the temperatures become too high and babblers reduced their activity.",
    "Note: We would pause the observations if we would lose the focal individual from sight or if any of the individuals would interact with the observer. The observation would be continued once we find the individual or all individuals go back to their natural behavior.\nDetermine the number of focal observations.\nNote: The number of focal observations depends on the abundance of interactions and their distribution. There are several methods to test the quality of sample size, including bootstrapping and jackknifing, which can be used once the data are collected (Farine and Whitehead, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Lusseau et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Wey et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]).\nNote: It is important to note that there is still no consensus about the right sample size and testing method.\nWe used a technique as in jackknifing, where we measured the difference between normalized strengths of individuals (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Since we observed all individuals equally, in our study strength was defined as the total number of interactions an individual had during the observation period.\nNote: See the “Testing semi-focal observations” script in Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2126-Mmc2.pdf] for more details.\nFor each number of focal rounds, calculate the mean strength for each individual and normalized it.\nCompare the normalized values between focal rounds.\nNote: For example, we compared individuals’ normalized strength after just one round to normalized strength after two rounds and so on.\nThe preferred number of focal rounds is the one after which changes in normalized mean strength approach zero.\nNote: In our study, changes in mean strength approached zero after ten focal rounds for all interaction types (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPrepare the group for the focal observations by following them every day, 3–7 days before the beginning of observations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2126-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Estimating gained information on social interactions after each focal session",
    "During each focal session, we observed individuals ten times. After each round of focal observations, we calculated the mean strength, normalized it, and compared it to the previous focal round. Each boxplot represents the change in mean strength between consecutive focal rounds. Changes in normalized mean strength approach zero after ten rounds for all six interaction types, suggesting that ten focal observations are sufficient to estimate the strength of each association in this case.\nThe goals of the preparation period are to learn individuals’ names, test the habituation of individuals, and for animals to get used to everyday human presence.\nThe habituation is considered sufficient if you can approach them to a minimal observation distance (3–6 meters) without disturbing them.\nNote: The minimal observation distance depends on the species.\nOnce all individuals are habituated start implementing the standardized feeding protocol, 1–2 days before observations begin.\nFeeding protocol.\nFeed animals in the morning, before they begin foraging.\nRandomly distribute small pieces of food.\nNote: We fed Arabian babblers with 2–3 mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and ∼5 grams of bread.\nStart observations once individuals finish the feeding.\nCritical: We fed individuals only before the observations.\nNote: This combination of food as a reward in the morning and consistent following before observations gave us the best results. The level of habituations stayed steady over a long period and animals did not interact with observers after the feeding period.\nNote: Other feeding protocols, as well as observations without supplemented food, did not provide consistent behavior during observations.\nPrepare the order of focal observations a day before.\nObserve each individual once before moving to the next focal round.\nNote: For example, if all individuals in the group were observed six times and individual A was observed five times, we would observe individual A.",
    "Equally distribute observations of an individual during different periods of the observation time.\nNote: For example, in our study individuals had a similar number of observations in the first, the second, and the third hour of observation time.\nIf individuals had the same number and distribution of observations the focal individual was selected randomly.\nData collection tools\nFor recording multiple interaction types it is preferable to customize an application which will allow fast and accurate documentation.\nThe application should contain the list of individuals and the list of interactions.\nNote: We used the customizable application Cybertracker (https://www.cybertracker.org/[href=https://www.cybertracker.org/]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nIf the application does not have a built-in time measuring option, use a timer on a watch or mobile phone.\nNote: In case you record the time using a watch, the first window should contain commands for starting, pausing, and ending the focal observation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nFor directed interactions create two identical windows containing the list of individuals: one for the actor and one for the receiver of interaction."
