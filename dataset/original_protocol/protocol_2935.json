    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nDHE Staining and Image Acquisition\nTiming: 2–4 h\nCells that express mitochondria-targeted GFPEnvy are stained with DHE and imaged by fluorescence microscopy to visualize superoxides and mitochondria.\nTransfer 1 mL of mid-log culture grown in SC liquid medium to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and add DHE to a final concentration of 40 μM (4 μL of a 10 mM stock is added to 1,000 μL of cell suspension). Return the remaining cells in the 50 mL conical tube to the incubator and propagate at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. These cells can be stained and used to prepare fresh slides for imaging, as needed.\nNote: YPD media (rich, glucose-based media containing yeast extract, peptone and dextrose) is autofluorescent and should not be used for fluorescence imaging.\nIncubate for 30 min at 30°C in the dark.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 s, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL SC.\nRepeat step 3 once.\nNote: Steps 3 and 4 are wash steps to remove unincorporated DHE. If high background is observed in the DHE channel, increase the number of washes.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 s, and remove supernatant, leaving 10–20 μL supernatant in the tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/268-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Adequate Volume of Cell Suspension for Live Imaging\n(A) Representative image shows the volume of media that is retained with the cell pellet (red arrow).\n(B) Representative image of the appropriate volume and turbidity of resuspended yeast for live-cell imaging.\nResuspend the pellet in the residual medium, transfer 1.7 μL of the cell suspension to a microscope slide, and cover with a coverslip.",
    "Critical: Each slide should be imaged for 10 min or less (see Limitations for alternative mounting strategies for longer imaging). If additional slides are needed, prepare them using the remaining culture in step 1 and repeat steps 2–6.\nCritical: For optimal imaging, cells must be resuspended in the appropriate volume of supernatant. Typical volumes for cell suspensions for imaging are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nTo image DHE and mitochondria-targeted GFP, locate a field of cells and acquire a z-series using the following settings and excitation/emission filters:\nGFPEnvy: excitation/emission 470/507 nm, 20% power, typical exposure time: 200 ms (Slubowski et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11])\nDHE: excitation/emission 550/610 nm, 80% power, typical exposure time: 300 ms (Benov et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Zhao et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\n1 × 1 binning (if camera chip has sufficient pixels, 2 × 2 binning may be used; final pixel dimension should be < 0.1 μm).\n21 z sections with 0.3 μm spacing (total depth 6 μm, covering most yeast cells).\nAcquire GFPEnvy and DHE z-stacks sequentially for greater speed and stability\nNote: Power and exposure time can be adjusted according to signal intensity. We typically acquire 5–6 z-stacks per slide, and 2–3 slides per sample to image 100 cells using this setting.\nImage Deconvolution Using Volocity\nTiming: 10–30 min/image\nImages acquired using a wide-field microscope are deconvolved to remove out-of-focus fluorescence.\nEnter pixel size in X, Y, and Z as 0.0645, 0.0645, and 0.3 μm, respectively. in Edit→ Properties (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/268-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Screenshots of Key Steps in Image Deconvolution Using Volocity\nScreenshots of step 8 (A), step 10 (B), and step 11(C) in image deconvolution using Volocity.\nGo to Actions→ Create New→ Calculated PSF (Point Spread Function).",
    "Set up PSF parameters by entering microscope type, immersion medium refractive index, objective lens numerical aperture, and emission wavelength. For this example, enter wide-field, 1.52, 1.4, and 507 nm and 610 nm for GFPEnvy and DHE, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nGo to Tools→ Iterative Restoration. We use 60 iterations and a 100% confidence criterion for termination. Start the deconvolution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Pixel size should be set based on the microscope and camera used and the actual spacing of the z-stacks. Iteration settings should be set based on the signal strength of fluorophores of interest. The deconvolved images may be distorted if the number of iterations is too high. Conversely, the out-of-focus signal will persist if too few iterations are performed.\nAnalysis of Superoxide Levels in Mitochondria Using Volocity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/image\nSuperoxide levels are represented as mean intensity of DHE fluorescence that co-localizes with GFPEnvy-labeled mitochondria.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) in an area without cells. Go to the Measurement tab, and export data including mean intensity to a spreadsheet for analysis as mean background intensity (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/268-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Identify mitochondria in Find Objects by thresholding the intensity of GFPEnvy signals. Clip these mitochondrial objects to ROIs which represent outlines of mitochondria and measure mean intensity in the DHE channel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nMitochondrial superoxide levels are the mean DHE intensity in mitochondria minus background intensity.\nAnalysis of Colocalization of Superoxide and Mitochondria Using Volocity",
    "Timing: 0.5–1 h/image\nColocalization of superoxides with mitochondria is measured using Manders’ overlap coefficient or Pearson’s correlation coefficient between DHE and GFPEnvy signals.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) in an area where there are no cells. Go to Colocolization tab, and Set up Thresholds from ROI (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/268-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Pearson’s Correlation and Overlap Coefficient are shown in the Thresholded Statistics panel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nImage Deconvolution Using Fiji\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/image\nSince Volocity is obtained from a commercial source, we provide an alternative method using the open-source software, Fiji, to perform image deconvolution and analysis.\nDownload and install Diffraction PSF 3D (https://imagej.net/Diffraction_PSF_3D[href=https://imagej.net/Diffraction_PSF_3D]) and Iterative Deconvolve 3D (https://imagej.net/Iterative_Deconvolve_3D[href=https://imagej.net/Iterative_Deconvolve_3D]) plugins from the Fiji website (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads[href=https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads]).\nCreate a PSF using Diffraction PSF 3D: Plugins → Diffraction PSF 3D. Set up PSF parameters by entering immersion medium refractive index, objective lens numerical aperture, emission wavelength, image pixel size, image z step size, image width, image height, and image Z stack. Typical settings:\nrefractive index: 1.518\nnumerical aperture: 1.40\nemission wavelengths: 507 nm or 610 nm for GFP Envy and DHE, respectively\nlongitudinal spherical aberration at maximum aperture: 0\nimage pixel spacing: 64.50 (substitute your own spacing in nm if applicable)\nslice spacing: 300 (substitute your own spacing in nm if applicable)\nimage width: 1,343 (substitute your own image size in pixels if applicable)\nimage height: 1,023 (substitute your own image size in pixels if applicable)",

Screenshots of Key Steps in Image Deconvolution Using Fiji\nScreenshots of step 9 (A) and step 10 (B) in image deconvolution using Fiji.\nDeconvolve selected images: Plugins → Iterative Deconvolve 3D. Select the image and corresponding PSF, set Wiener filter gamma to 0, maximum iterations to 60, and delta for termination to 0. The deconvolution will be terminated automatically if iterations do not produce better resolution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nSave the deconvolved file.\nAnalysis of Superoxide Levels in Mitochondria Using Fiji\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/image\nOpen deconvolved images in Fiji using the Bio-Formats importer: Plugins → Bio-Formats →Bio-Formats Importer. Select “split channels.” Keep the brightfield channel, deconvolved DHE channel and GFPEnvy channel open, and close unused channels (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/268-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Screenshots of Key Steps in Image Import and Background Subtraction Using Fiji\nImage import and background subtraction are used in step 12 (A) and step 13 (B–D) in analysis of superoxide levels in mitochondria using Fiji, and step 22 (A) and step 23 (B–D) in analysis of colocalization of superoxide and mitochondria using Fiji.\nSubtract the background intensity in the DHE channel:\nGenerate a maximum projection of DHE channel: Image → Stacks → Z project. Set the start and stop slice to include all slices. Select “Average Intensity” as the projection type (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nGo to Analyze → Set measurements, and check “Mean gray value.”\nUse the Rectangle selection tool to select a background region where there are no cells and measure the mean intensity in this region (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).",
    "Subtract the mean background mean intensity: Process → Math → Subtract. Enter the mean background intensity from the last step. Process all slices (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nNote: If background intensity is still visible after subtraction, adjust the value provided to Process → Math → Subtract to remove most of the background. If the background intensity is low, rolling ball background subtraction can be used as an alternative method.\nOutline a cell in the brightfield channel using the freehand selection tool and add it to the ROI Manager (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/268-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Check the “Duplicate stack” box and set the range to include all slices. Remove the cell outline ROI once the duplication is done (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nThreshold the GFPEnvy channel to create masks of mitochondria: select the GFPEnvy channel, Image → Adjust → Threshold. Adjust the threshold to segment mitochondria in the GFPEnvy channel, and then click Apply. When the pop-up “Convert Stack to Binary” comes up, uncheck “calculate threshold for each image” and check “Black background (of binary masks).” Apply to all slices in the stack (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nNote: Automatic threshold “IsoData” can be used to recognize mitochondria in the GFPEnvy channel.",
    "Add all the masks to the ROI Manager: Select the stack containing the binary masks of mitochondria. Analyze → Analyze Particles. Keep Size and Circularity to default values to include all mitochondria. Select “Add to Manager” and “Exclude on edges.” Process all slices in the stack (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nGo to Analyze → Set measurements, check “Area” and “Integrated density.” Clear the results before proceeding to the next step (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E).\nMeasure the DHE signal using the mitochondria mask in ROI Manager: Select the window containing the DHE channel. Go to ROI Manager and click Measure. Export data to a spreadsheet for analysis.\nIn the spreadsheet, sum the area and integrated density (IntDen) in one cell. Then divide the summed integrated density by summed area to obtain the superoxide level in the mitochondria.\nAnalysis of Colocalization of Superoxide and Mitochondria Using Fiji\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/image\nIf your Fiji does not include the Coloc2 plugin, download the Coloc2 plugin from the ImageJ website (https://imagej.net/Coloc_2[href=https://imagej.net/Coloc_2]) and install it, or activate the “Fiji” update site in Help → Update.\nOpen deconvolved DHE and GFPEnvy images in Fiji using the Bio-Formats importer: Plugins → Bio-Formats →Bio-Formats Importer. Select split channels. Keep the deconvolved DHE channel and GFPEnvy channel open, and close unused channels (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nSubtract the background intensity in the DHE and GFPEnvy channels:\nGenerate a maximum projection of DHE channel: Image → Stacks → Z project.

Screenshots of Key Steps in Analysis of Colocalization of Superoxide and Mitochondria Using Fiji\nScreenshots of step 24 (A), step 25 (B), and an example of output (C) in analysis of colocalization of superoxide and mitochondria using Fiji.\nPerform Coloc2 analysis: Analyze → Colocalization → Coloc2. Select channel 1 and channel 2 as DHE and GFPEnvy channels, respectively. For ROI or mask setting, select “ROI Manager” to import the ROI selected from step 24. Use Bisection as threshold regression. For Algorithms, select “Manders’ Correlation”. Pearson’s Correlation and Manders’ Overlap Coefficient are shown in the pdf report. Output values are also shown in the Log window and may be saved as plain text (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B and 8C).\nMito-roGFP Image Acquisition\nTiming: 2–4 h\nroGFP1 is targeted to mitochondrial matrix using the targeting sequence of ATP9 (mito-roGFP). In the strain used for imaging, mito-roGFP is inserted into the yeast genome at the HO locus.\nNote: The dynamic range of the oxidized and reduced states of mito-roGFP should be determined by imaging cells treated with 5 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), respectively, for 30 min (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).",
    "Transfer 1 mL of mid-log culture in SC to each of three 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. Add H2O2 to 1 culture to a final concentration of 5 mM, and DTT to another culture to a final concentration of 5 mM. Incubate at 30°C for 30 min. These are used for detection of the dynamic range of the mito-roGFP1. Return the remaining cells in the 50 mL conical tube to the incubator and propagate at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. These cells can be used to prepare fresh slides for imaging, as needed.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 s, and remove supernatant, leaving 10–20 μL supernatant in the tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nResuspend the pellet in the residual medium, transfer 1.7 μL of cell suspension to a microscope slide, and cover with a coverslip.\nCritical: Each slide should be imaged for 10 min or less (see Limitations for alternative mounting strategies for longer imaging). If additional slides are needed, use the remaining culture from step 1 and repeat steps 2 and 3.\nCritical: For optimal imaging, cells must be resuspended in the appropriate volume of supernatant. Typical volumes for cell suspensions for imaging are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nLocate a field of cells and acquire a z-series using the following settings and excitation/emission filters to image mito-roGFP1:\nOxidized mito-roGFP: excitation/emission 365/500–550 nm, 50% power, typical exposure time: 300 ms\nReduced mito-roGFP: excitation/emission 470/500–550 nm, 20% power, typical exposure time: 200 ms\n1 × 1 binning (if camera chip has sufficient pixels, 2 × 2 binning may be used; final pixel dimension should be <0.1 μm).\n21 z sections with 0.3 μm spacing\nSet software to excite at 365 and 470 nm sequentially at each z step",
    "Note: Power and exposure time can be adjusted according to signal intensity. We typically acquire 5–6 images per slide, and 2–3 slides per sample to obtain images of 100 cells.\nNote: Excitation at 400 nm is optimal for visualizing the oxidized species of roGFP. However, it also excites reduced roGFP to a greater extent compared to excitation at 365 nm, which leads to reduced sensitivity in measuring mitochondrial redox state. Exposure of mito-roGFP1 to high-intensity illumination at 400 nm also leads to photoconversion of the protein (Vevea et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Therefore, we recommend using 365 nm for excitation of oxidized mito-roGFP.\nDeconvolve images using Volocity or Fiji software as described above.\nNote: Iteration settings are dependent on signal. The deconvolved images may be distorted if the number of iterations is too high. Conversely, the out-of-focus signal will persist if too few iterations are performed.\nAnalysis of Mitochondrial Redox State Using Volocity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/image\nMitochondrial matrix redox state is measured as the reduced to oxidized (R/O) ratio of mito-roGFP: the signal from excitation at 470 nm divided by that from excitation at 365 nm.\nImport images into a Volocity library and create an image sequence with two channels.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) in an area where there are no cells.\nChoose: Tools → Ratio.

    "Note: Images in the ratio channel are used for presentation. Warmer colors represent more reducing environments and cooler colors represent more oxidizing environments. Images in the ratio channel should not be used for quantitative analysis.\nSelect the Measurement tab, select the ratio channel, and draw an ROI around the area of interest. Measure the ratio channel, excluding zero values. Multiple regions may be selected and measured at the same time. Export data to a spreadsheet for analysis (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nAnalysis of Mitochondrial Redox State Using Fiji\nTiming: 0.5–1 h/image\nMitochondrial matrix redox state is measured as the reduced to oxidized (R/O) ratio of mito-roGFP: the signal from excitation at 470 nm divided by that from excitation at 365 nm.\nConvert the images to TIFF.\nCritical: If the images are contrast enhanced in Volocity, the pixel values of the exported images may change. Using the histogram, verify that pixel values are not changed during the conversion. If the pixel values are changed, export the non-enhanced image from Volocity again.\nOpen images and change type to 32 bit: Image→ Type → 32 bit.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) in an area where there are no cells. Calculate the mean intensity in this ROI: Analyze → Measure.\nSubtract the calculated mean background from the stack: Process → Math → Subtract.\nUsing the subtracted z stack, find the middle slice and threshold on mitochondria: Image → Adjust → Threshold and click Apply on the Threshold window. Apply to all slices in the stack.

    "Note: Image J occasionally crashes during the Threshold process. We find that the version 1.53e is not stable. Version 1.52 or 1.51 is more stable during the process.\nCreate the ratio z stack: Process → Image Calculator. Divide the reduced (470 nm excitation) stack by the oxidized (365 nm excitation) stack (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).\nDraw an ROI around the area of interest. Choose Analyze → Tools → ROI Manager, and click Add to store the ROI. Multiple regions may be stored in the manager. In ROI Manager, select all ROIs, then choose More → Multi-Measure to measure all stack slices. Export data to a spreadsheet for analysis.\nIn the spreadsheet, multiply the mean intensity and area to obtain integrated intensity. Then divide the summed integrated intensity by summed area to obtain the mean ratio in the mitochondria."
