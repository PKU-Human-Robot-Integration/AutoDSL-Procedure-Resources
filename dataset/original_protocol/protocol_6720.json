    "Maintenance of 293T and B16-GFP cell culturesWarm DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (hereafter referred to as complete DMEM) and DPBS in a 37 °C water bath for at least 15 min.Wash ~90% confluent cells in a T25 flask with 3 ml of DPBS, aspirate the DPBS, and add 0.5 ml of Trypsin-EDTA. Use 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 293T cells and 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for B16-GFP cells.Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2-5 min, add 3 ml of prewarmed complete DMEM, and transfer the cell suspensions to a 15 ml sterile conical tube.Spin down the cells at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 15 ml of complete DMEM.Dispense 4 ml of the cell suspension into each T25 flask, and then incubate it for 3 days in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator before subculturing again.Preparation of gelatin-coated chamber slidesGelatin coating of the glass slides helps the cells to adhere firmly to the slides and stops them from detaching during culture, as well as during subsequent adhesion assay and staining procedures.Add 300 μl of 0.1% Gelatin Solution to each well of the chamber slide aseptically in a biosafety cabinet.Rock the slide gently to spread the solution evenly in the whole well and place the slide with the lid on in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 1 h.Aspirate the gelatin solution from the wells and wash two times with DPBS, then briefly let it dry in the biosafety cabinet.Immediately use the slide to culture the 293T cells, or store it at room temperature for up to one week.Alternatively, pre-coated chambers slides can also be used.Transfection of 293T cellsThe day before transfection (Day 1), prepare the 293T cell suspension as described in Procedure A.",
    "Count the cells using standard trypan blue exclusion (https://www.abcam.com/protocols/counting-cells-using-a-haemocytometer[href=https://www.abcam.com/protocols/counting-cells-using-a-haemocytometer]) and seed 1 × 105 cells in 500 μl complete DMEM in each well of the gelatin-coated or pre-coated chamber slide. Seed cells in the required number of wells on the basis of your experimental design.The next day (Day 2), perform the following steps to prepare transfection mixture:Prepare two tubes, Tube A and Tube B, separately. The following quantities (Table 1) are for transfection of one well; multiply the volumes by the number of replicates to scale up. Prepare transfection mix with 25% additional volume to account for pipetting and dispensing errors. Prepare the transfection mix in a similar manner for the mock transfection as well.Table 1. Transfection mixture preparation imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201229/20201229221041_6490.jpgMix tube A and tube B and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Replace the complete DMEM in the wells of the chamber slide with 500 μl Opti-MEM.Add 50 μl of the transfection mix from Step C4 to each well dropwise. Rock the slide gently a few times and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Six hours after the transfection, gently remove the lipofectamine-containing medium and replace the medium with DMEM containing 5% FBS and incubate the slide at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator until Day 3.On Day 3, the transfected slides can be used to perform cell adhesion assay.Preparation of B16-GFP single-cell suspensionTo prepare the B16-GFP cells for the cell adhesion assay, dissociate cells that are 60%-70% confluent in a T25 flask using an enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. This non-enzymatic cell dissociation is suitable for cell adhesion assays that require intact cell surface proteins to facilitate binding interactions.Discard the growth medium from the flask and wash the cells twice with 3 ml Ca2+- and Mg2+-free DPBS.",
    "Add 2 ml of prewarmed (37 °C in a water bath) enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer in a T25 flask and place the flask in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.Observe the cells every two minutes under the microscope. When the cells roundup (4-5 min after adding enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer), firmly tap the flask against the palm of your gloved hand to promote cell detachment.Add 5 ml of prewarmed complete DMEM to the flask and resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15-ml conical tube. Add 5 ml of complete DMEM again to the flask to collect the remaining cells and add this to the same conical tube.Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml of complete DMEM. Pass the cell suspension through a 40-µm nylon cell strainer to remove cell clumps and to prepare single-cell suspensions.Count the cells using standard trypan blue exclusion and adjust the cell number to 1 × 105 cells/500 μl by diluting the cells using complete DMEM.Cell adhesion assayRemove the culture medium from the transfected 293T cells (from Procedure C) using a P1000 pipette and add 1 × 105 B16-GFP cells in 500 µl of complete DMEM per well (for both mock and Siglec1-transfected wells).Incubate the slide at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2 incubator for 5 min. The incubation time should be decided empirically for different protein-cell pairs to minimize the non-specific adherence of cells to the monolayer.Gently remove the media containing non-adherent cells using a P1000 pipette.Wash the wells by filling them with 1 ml of complete DMEM and gently pipetting up and down several times so as not to damage the 293T cell monolayer. Repeat this washing step three times.",
    "After the last wash, remove the DMEM medium and add 500 μl of prewarmed 2% PFA diluted in complete DMEM and incubate the slide for 10 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Remove the PFA solution and gently wash each well with 1 ml of DPBS. Repeat this washing step three times and proceed to antibody staining.Antibody stainingBlock the formaldehyde-fixed slides in blocking and staining buffer (1× DPBS/1% BSA/0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature.Prepare the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mSiglec1 antibody by diluting it as indicated on the manufacturer datasheet (5 μg/ml) in blocking and staining buffer (see Recipes) (https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/products/alexa-fluor-647-anti-mouse-cd169-siglec-1-antibody-9835[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/products/alexa-fluor-647-anti-mouse-cd169-siglec-1-antibody-9835]).Remove the blocking solution and add 150 μl of the diluted antibody to each well of the chamber slide. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.Wash each slide well three times in 1 ml of DPBS for 5 min. Remove the chambers carefully and coverslip the slides with Vector lab mounting Reagent with DAPI. Use fingernail polish to seal the edges of the coverslip and keep the slide at room temperature for 5 min to let it dry completely.Image acquisitionAcquire the images on a  LSM 780  or any other confocal microscope using standard microscopic techniques.Acquire Z-stack images using 10× magnification and with 1 μm Z-stack interval (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3878/bioprotoc-11-01-3878-g001.jpgFigure 1.
