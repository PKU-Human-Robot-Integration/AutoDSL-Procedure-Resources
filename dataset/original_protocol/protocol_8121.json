    "All animal work utilizes protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.\n1. Collection of fluids\nNOTE: Both serum and CSF are required. Two protocols for each fluid collection are needed for survival and necropsy.\nSerum and CSF collection using survival procedures\n\tNOTE: For survival fluid collection, serum collection should precede CSF collection as it is a less invasive procedure. CSF must be obtained within one week of serum draw.\n\t\nRetro-orbital bleeding procedure for serum collection.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure is for survival bleeding of mice14. The procedure described applies to any age, gender, and strain of mice. Since IACUC rules dictate that a maximum blood volume of 1% of body weight can be removed as a single blood draw, it is recommended the procedure is performed only on mice weighing more than 15 g.\n\t\t\nMove the cages containing mice from the rack to an appropriate working area. Prepare the anesthesia gas machine by turning on the oxygen flow meter to 1 L/min.\nPlace the animal into the induction chamber and close the lid tightly. Turn on the isoflurane vaporizer to 3.5% and monitor the animal until recumbent.\nRemove the animal from the chamber and assess the level of anesthesia by pedal reflex, i.e., firm footpad pinch. Ensure adequate depth of anesthesia before performing the procedure: lack of response to a firm pinch indicates adequate anesthesia.\nRestrain the anesthetized mouse by grasping the loose skin behind the ears with the thumb and index finger of the non-dominant hand. Bulge the eyes by using the index finger to draw back the skin above the eye and the thumb to draw back the skin below the eyes.",
    "Place the tip of a Pasteur pipette into the eye socket underneath the eyeball (Figure 1, left panel), directing the tip at approximately 45° toward the middle of the eye socket (Figure 1, right panel). Rotate the pipette between fingers during the forward passage. Apply gentle pressure and then release until blood is entering the pipette.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Maximum amount of blood that may be withdrawn at one time from this location is about 1% of body weight, e.g., 0.2 mL from a 20 g mouse.\nGently remove the capillary to prevent injury to the eye and place the collected blood in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Close the eyelid and apply mild pressure with gauze to prevent further bleeding. Once fully alert and mobile (usually 3−5 min), return the mouse to its holding cage.\nAllow blood to clot for 30−60 min at room temperature (RT), then centrifuge blood for 10 min at 2,000 x g in a 4 °C refrigerated centrifuge. Using a clean pipette technique, collect serum into a new, labeled 0.5 mL vial. Immediately freeze vial of serum at -80 °C.\nCSF collection with survival procedure\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure is for survival surgery, and it is based on the protocol published by Liu and Duff in 200815. The mice are anesthetized by a Ketamine (20 mg/mL), xylazine (0.5 mg/mL), and acepromazine (0.5 mg/mL) cocktail administered intraperitoneally.\n\t\t\nMove the cages containing mice from the rack to a designated surgery working area. Prepare surgery space in a sterile environment. Ensure that all instruments and materials used are sterilized before surgery.",
    "Weigh the mouse and calculate the anesthesia volume needed (0.1 mL of anesthesia cocktail for a 20 g mouse). Inject anesthesia intraperitoneally16. After a few minutes, test the mouse by pinching the footpad to ensure adequate anesthesia. If more anesthetic is required, further inject 0.01−0.03 mL of the anesthetic cocktail.\nUse either scissors or a shaver to shave a small area of the head, on the caudal end, medial on the skull, to expose large enough working area for CSF collection. Position the mouse in the prone position on the stereotaxic instrument, and steady the head by using ear bars (Figure 2A).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The mouse is laid down so that the head forms a nearly 135° angle with the body (Figure 2A). Once the animal is positioned, a surgical drape is used to maintain a sterile field at the surgical site. Clear adhesive drapes are preferred for CSF collection in mice, as they allow for direct and more focused visualization of the animal.\nSwab the surgical site with 30% chlorhexidine diacetate. Using a sterile scalpel, make a sagittal incision of the skin inferior to the occiput to expose muscles overlying the cisterna magna.\nBy blunt dissection with forceps, separate the subcutaneous tissue and muscles to expose the cisterna magna (Figure 2B). Use microretractors to hold the muscles apart (Figure 2B) and expose the dura mater meningeal layer over the cisterna magna.\nGently wash with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any possible blood contamination. Blot dry the dura mater with a sterile cotton swab and gently puncture the membrane covering the cisterna magna with a 30 G needle. Quickly and gently insert a small glass capillary tube to collect CSF (Figure 2C).",
    "NOTE: Intracranial pressure allows CSF to flow spontaneously into the capillary (Figure 2C). Depending on the age and size of the mouse, approximately 5−12 µL of CSF is obtained from each mouse.\nCarefully remove the capillary tube from the membrane. Connect the tube to a 3 mL syringe through a polyethylene tubing (Table of Materials) and inject the collected CSF into a labeled 0.5 mL tube (Figure 2D). Keep vials in ice.\nClose incision by using polydioxanone suture (PDS) with disposable needle and using buried sutures17. Clean off the area of any dried blood or tissue.\nInject mice, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally16, with 0.05−0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine hydrochloride as analgesic treatment. Also, inject subcutaneously 1 mL of sterile saline to prevent dehydration.\nPlace the mouse back in a clean and warm cage for recovery. Once the mouse is mobile and able to reach food and water, place the cage back on the rack.\nCentrifuge CSF for 10 min at 1,000 x g in a 4 °C refrigerated centrifuge. Check the degree of blood contamination by visual inspection for identification of xanthochromia and presence of a red pellet in the bottom of the tube. Discard blood-contaminated samples.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The formula utilized for the correction of CSF protein amounts in blood-contaminated specimens is based on equation parameters that include protein content in CSF and serum, hematocrit (HCT), and red blood cells (RBC) count in CSF and blood18. However, such a correction strategy cannot be easily applied to mouse CSF specimens due to the small volume, therefore limiting the correction strategy to a visual inspection.",
    "Using a clean pipette technique, collect CSF into a new 0.2 mL tube, leaving behind the pellet with cells. Dilute CSF 1:3 with PBS to reduce volume loss due to aerosol. Immediately freeze the vial of CSF at -80 °C.\nSerum and CSF collection using non-survival procedures\n\tNOTE: For non-survival fluid collection, CSF collection precedes serum collection as the mouse needs to have a pulse.\n\t\nCSF collection at necropsy\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure is for non-survival surgery, and approximately 10−20 µL of CSF is obtained from each mouse. A sterile surgical field is recommended, but not required for non-survival surgery.\n\t\t\nMove the cages containing mice from the rack to a comfortable working space. Follow steps 1.1.2.2−1.1.2.7 and 1.1.2.11−1.1.2.12 for CSF collection. Proceed to section 1.2.2 for serum collection.\nBlood collection via intracardiac puncture (open approach)\n\t\tNOTE: Blood volumes expected is approximately 3% of body weight, e.g., 0.6 mL from a 20 g mouse.\n\t\t\nFollowing CSF collection ensure the mouse is still sufficiently anesthetized by pinching the footpad. If any reaction is observed, administer a second dose of anesthetic. If no reaction is observed, proceed.\nPlace the animal on the back and swab skin on the abdomen with 70% alcohol. With surgical scissors, open the thoracic cavity and expose the heart. Insert a 25 G needle (attached to a 3 mL syringe) into the left ventricle and gently apply negative pressure on the syringe plunger. Withdraw needle after blood has been collected.\nPerform a secondary method of euthanasia such as decapitation or cervical dislocation to ensure that the animal is deceased.",
    "Push the plunger of the syringe down and inject the collected blood into a 1.5 mL vial. Allow blood to clot for 30-60 min at RT and then centrifuge it for 10 min at 2,000 x g in a 4 °C refrigerated centrifuge.\nUsing clean pipette technique, collect serum into a new, labeled 0.5 mL vial. Immediately freeze vial of serum at a -80 °C freezer.\n2. Protein analysis\nUse a preferred method, e.g., Luminex technology, for quantifying target protein(s) and albumin in matched serum and CSF specimens.\n\tNOTE: Here, an example is given with Luminex magnetic technology, but virtually any technique that measures protein amounts, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), can be applied to the current protocol. Ideally, CSF and serum samples are run for both albumin and target proteins on the same platform. Assay conditions must be optimized for crucial steps in the protocol such as antigen-bead coupling concentration, serum and CSF sample dilutions, best-fit standard curves for each analyte, and buffer composition to reduce non-specific reactivity. If a commercial kit is used for protein(s) measurement, e.g., the immunoglobulin isotyping kit (Table of Materials) used to obtain data presented in Figure 3, manufacturers’ instructions have to be followed.\n\t\nUpon thawing and prior to analysis, centrifuge CSF and serum samples (2,000 x g for 10 min) and use the supernatant to prevent clogging of the filter plates and/or probe. Follow the assay procedure provided with the kit for appropriate sample dilutions. Otherwise, determine the appropriate dilution for each analyte and fluid. Dilute samples in PBS accordingly.",
    "NOTE: If there are no specific guidance or instructions, dilutions for each analyte and fluid have to be established before the study test, by determining the appropriate dilution ranges necessary to obtain concentration estimates that fall within the most reliable range of a standard curve. Knowing the characteristics of the biological sample to be analyzed, e.g., physiological and pathological concentrations in the fluid, allows trying different dilutions with samples of low, medium, and high analyte content. If the expected range of concentrations in the samples is known a priori, the dilutions can be selected after calculating how many times the sample has to be diluted in order to be within the chosen standard curve range.\n\t\tCAUTION: By calculating the dilution factors, remember that CSF has already been diluted 1:3.\nPrepare a standard curve for each protein of interest, e.g., albumin and IgG as used to generate data in Figure 3, by serial diluting reference standard proteins. During the preparation of standard curves, thoroughly mix each higher concentration before making the next dilution.\n\t\tNOTE: Regardless of the chosen method of quantification, it is essential to include a standard curve each time the assay is performed to estimate protein(s) concentration in samples. The best choice for a reference standard is a purified, known concentration of the protein of interest. Deciding on the specific dilutions, as well as the number of data points and replicates used to define the standard curve, depends upon the degree of non-linearity in the standard curve.",
    "Select the appropriate antibody-coupled magnetic bead sets (Table of Materials). For individual vials of beads, sonicate each vial for 30 s and vortex for 1 min. Prepare a “working beads mixture” by diluting the bead stocks to a final concentration of 50 beads of each set/µL in assay/wash buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]). Add 50 µL of the mixed beads to each well in a flat-bottom 96-well plate (Table of Materials).\n\t\tCAUTION: The fluorescent beads are light-sensitive. Therefore, they should be protected from prolonged exposure to light throughout the procedure.\nDiagram the placement of backgrounds, standards, and samples on a well map worksheet.\nAdd 50 µL of assay/wash buffer to each background well, and 50 µL of each standard to the wells for the standard curve. Load 50 μL of each diluted sample into the appropriate wells last. Wrap the plate with foil and incubate with agitation (~800 rpm) on a plate shaker for 30 min at RT.\nPlace the plate on a handheld magnet (Table of Materials) and rest the plate on the magnet for ~60 s to allow complete setting of magnetic beads. Remove well contents by gently decanting the plate and tap plate on absorbent pads to remove residual liquid.\nWash the plate by removing it from the magnet, by adding 200 µL of assay/wash buffer, by shaking for ~30 s, and finally by reattaching it to the magnet. Repeat washing 3x.\nDilute the biotinylated detection antibody, i.e., biotin-labeled antibody raised against the protein host species, to 4 μg/mL in assay/wash buffer. Add 50 µL of the diluted detection antibody to each well. Cover the plate and incubate for 30 min at RT on the plate shaker at ~800 rpm. Place the plate on the magnet and repeat steps 2.1.6 and 2.1.7.",
    "Dilute phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE) to 4 μg/mL in assay/wash buffer. Add 50 µL of diluted SAPE to each well. Cover the plate and incubate for 30 min at RT on the plate shaker at ~800 rpm. Place the plate on the magnet and repeat steps 2.1.6 and 2.1.7.\nRemove the plate from the magnet and resuspend the beads in 100 μL of assay/wash buffer. Read wells with a dual laser flow-based detection instrument which allows for the detection of the magnitude of PE fluorescence intensity (FI).\n\t\tNOTE: The signal, e.g., FI, generated is proportional to the amount of target antigen attached to the surface of the beads.\nExport raw data and create standard curves by graphing detection signal FI versus standard protein concentrations. Use the standard curve(s) to calculate the concentration of the analyte(s) in the samples.\n\t\tNOTE: Albumin is preferentially expressed in g/dL, while proteins of interest are preferentially expressed in mg/dL.\n3. Intrathecal index calculations\nOrganize protein concentration values into a spreadsheet and analyze the results by applying the following formulas.\nCalculate Qalbumin:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60495/60495eq1.jpg\n\twhere CSFalbumin and Serumalbumin are concentrations of albumin in matched serum and CSF specimens, respectively.\nCalculate Qprotein:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60495/60495eq2.jpg\n\twhere CSFprotein and Serumprotein are concentrations of target protein(s) in matched serum and CSF specimens, respectively.\nCalculate the protein index:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60495/60495eq3.jpg\nSubscription Required.
