    "Nascent associated complex (NAC) and Ccr4-Not complex IPYeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media. In the morning dilute night culture till OD600 = 0.15. Grow 100 ml of culture at 30 °C until OD600 = 0.6-0.8.Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 4，000 x g. Wash the cells with 1 ml of sterile H2O and transfer to the eppendorf tube. Cells can be stored at -20 °C.Work on ice! Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, add 0.5 ml of glass beads and disrupt 15 min on the glass bead beater at 4 °C.Transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Wash the beads with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Combine all liquid phases.To avoid the contamination with cells derby preclean the total extracts. For this transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Centrifuge 1 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant into the new eppendorf tube and centrifuge 20 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C.Measure the total protein concentrations in the supernatants [= TE (Total Extracts)]. For this dilute the total extracts 1: 20 and load 5 and 10 μl to the Bradford sample (0.8 ml of water and 0.2 ml of Bradford reactive).Use Protein-A or Protein-G beads 20 μl of 100% beads per reaction. Wash the beads for 20 sec 2 times with 1 ml of water and 1 time with 1 ml of lysis buffer, after each washing spin the beads at 800 x g for 1 min. Resuspend till 20% in lysis buffer. Take 100 μl of this suspension per reaction.Mix 0.4 ml of the total extracts containing 2 mg of total protein (5 mg/ml) with 100 μl of beads suspension and 1-2 μl of antibodies.",
    "Incubate from 4 h till over night at 4 °C with mild rotation.Wash the beads for 20 sec with 1 ml of lysis buffer 3 times, after each washing spin the beads at 800 x g for 1 min.Add 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer 2x to the beads and incubate 10 min at 65 °C.Analyze the CoIP by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Load the total extracts (30 μg) and immunoprecipitated fraction (20 μl) on the gel.Notes: For the control there are 2 possibilities.  Use the total extracts from the strains lacking the immunoprecipitated antigen. Use the same total extract that you use for IP but do not add the antibodies. Ribosome IPDuring the cyclic process of translation, a small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunit associate with mRNA to form an 80S complex (monosome). This ribosome moves along the mRNA during translation. Further ribosomes can initiate translation on the same mRNA to form polysomes. It is possible to immunoprecipitate separate ribosome particles (40S or 60S) or polysomes. To disrupt the polysomes, 25 mM of EDTA is added to the buffers. To maintain the polysomes, 0.1 mg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) is added to the culture before collection and to all the solution. Yeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media. In the morning dilute night culture till OD600 = 0.15. Grow 100 ml of culture at 30 °C until OD600 = 0.6-0.8.To keep the polysomes add cycloheximide (CHX) till final concentration 0.1 mg/ml and incubate 10 min on ice. To disrupt the polysomes avoid this step.To keep the polysomes spin the cells for 5 min at 4,000 x g and wash with 50 ml of cold water containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX. To disrupt the polysomes wash with 50 ml of cold water without CHX.",
    "Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX (in case of polysomes), spin. Cells can be frozen and stored at -20 °C.Transfer the liquid phase into the new tube.
