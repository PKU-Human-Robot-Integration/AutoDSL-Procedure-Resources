    "Use of all the animals in this protocol followed Ball State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.\n1. Establishing Mouse Breeders and Detecting Vaginal Plugs for Timed Pregnancies\nSet up a mouse breeding cage with wild type male and female mice. Ensure that the age of the breeding mice is between 6-8 weeks. Set up either a pair (1 male and 1 female) or as a trio (1 male and 2 female) for breeding.\nCheck for a vaginal plug the following morning. Use an angled metal probe to detect a deep plug by inserting it into the vaginal opening. Designate the morning of a positive vaginal plug to be embryonic day 0.5 (e0.5).\n\tNOTE: A vaginal plug can be either superficial (which is easily visible, see Figure 1) or deep (which is not easily visible). Presence of a deep plug will block full insertion of the probe whereas the absence of a plug will allow full insertion without resistance.\nMaintain timed pregnancy until the embryos reach e11.5 at which they will be harvested. To confirm pregnancy before harvesting embryos, record the weight of female mice between e7.5 and e11.5.\n\tNOTE: Daily increase in the mother's weight will indicate a successful pregnancy, whereas no change in weight will indicate a failed pregnancy.\n2. Harvesting Embryos from Pregnant Mice\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: a CO2 euthanasia chamber, 70% ethanol, paper towels, regular forceps, fine forceps, scissors, 1x sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 10 cm sterile Petri dishes, container with ice, perforated spoon, dissection stereomicroscope.\nPlace an e11.5 pregnant mouse in a clean CO2 euthanasia chamber to sacrifice it. Close the lid of the chamber to prevent the mouse from escaping.",
    "After the mouse is secured in the euthanasia chamber, turn on CO2. Make sure to regulate the flow rate of CO2 per IACUC recommendations (i.e., 10-30% displacement per minute). After the mouse is completely euthanized, perform cervical dislocation to ensure death.\nSpray the mouse with 70% ethanol. Lift the skin over the belly using forceps, make a small incision using a pair of scissors and extend the incision laterally. Enlarge the incision anteriorly up to the diaphragm and expose the uterine horn containing the embryos (Figure 2).\nPull out the string of embryos (uterine horn + embryos) by grasping the uterus and cutting it free. Place the string of embryos in ice-cold sterile 1x PBS.\nDissect out the individual embryos from the uterus horn by peeling off the uterine muscle, yolk sac, and amnion one by one (Figure 3A-F) under a stereomicroscope. Transfer the cleaned embryos using a perforated spoon to a Petri dish containing sterile 1x PBS on ice. Make sure to keep the embryos cold.\n3. Isolating Hearts from e11.5 Embryos\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: regular forceps, fine forceps, 1x sterile PBS, 10 cm sterile Petri dish, 6 cm sterile Petri dish, container with ice, perforated spoon, dissection stereomicroscope.\nSet up a new Petri dish with ice-cold sterile 1x PBS under a stereomicroscope. Transfer an embryo from step 2.5 into the Petri dish to dissect out the heart.\nRemove the head of the embryo using forceps. First, squeeze the head between the forceps with one hand and then remove the head by scraping it away with the other hand using closed forceps (Figure 4A-C).\nAfter removing the head, orient the embryo with its ventral side up by holding the embryo with forceps at its belly with one hand (Figure 4D).",
    "With the other hand, open the chest wall of the embryo by first making a small incision in the chest slightly above the diaphragm using fine forceps. Then, enlarge the incision very carefully by inserting closed forceps and tearing the chest wall by opening the forceps. Make sure to not thrust too deep, which can damage the heart. With the help of the forceps, keep the chest wall wide open to expose the heart and lungs in the thoracic cavity (Figure 4E).\nUsing fine forceps, gently move the heart anteriorly (90°) and expose the dorsal aorta/vein. Pull out the heart/lungs anteriorly by capturing the dorsal aorta/vein at the base of the heart (Figure 4F-H).\n\tNOTE: Be gentle while pulling out the heart/lungs to avoid tearing of the SV, which is located at the dorsal side of the heart.\nRinse the heart/lungs with cold 1x PBS to remove blood cells.\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.6 to remove the heart/lungs from the remaining embryos. Make sure to keep the isolated heart/lungs on ice.\n4. Isolating SVs and Ventricles from e11.5 Embryonic Mouse Hearts\nPlace the Petri dish with heart/lungs from step 3.7 under a stereomicroscope to isolate the SVs and whole ventricles. Peel off the attached lobes of the lungs one-by-one from their root using fine forceps.\nOrient the heart on its dorsal side and remove atria and the adjacent tissue that surrounds the SV anteriorly without tearing the SV. Remove the left and right atria from the heart by holding at its base and scraping it off using fine forceps (Figure 5B). Remove the adjacent tissue surrounding the SV using a similar technique (Figure 5C).\n\tNOTE: Keep in mind that the right atrium is attached to the SV, so be careful to only remove the atrium.",
    "To isolate the SV, first orient the heart with its dorsal side facing up (because the SV is on the dorsal side) and keep the heart still in this position by gently holding the heart at its ventricles with forceps.\n\tNOTE: The SV is an inflow organ of an embryonic heart that lies in between the atria on the dorsal side of the heart.\nRemove the SV by carefully peeling it off the heart where it is attached or by holding the SV at the base of its attachment with fine forceps and scraping it off with closed forceps (Figure 5D,E).\nTransfer the isolated SV into a new 6 cm Petri dish with ice-cold sterile 1x PBS on ice using a sterile transfer pipette and label the Petri dish as SV.\nTo isolate the whole ventricles, remove the outflow tract (aorta and pulmonary trunk) from the heart after the SV is removed (Figure 5F,G).\nTransfer the whole ventricles into a new 6 cm Petri dish containing sterile 1x PBS on ice using a sterile transfer pipette and label the Petri dish as ventricles. Keep the isolated SV and ventricles on ice.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.7 to isolate SVs and ventricles from the remaining hearts.\n5. Setting Up Tissue Culture Plates with Inserts and Extracellular Matrix Coating\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: commercial extracellular matrix solution (ECM; e.g., Matrigel), 8.0 µM polyethylene terephthalate (PET) culture inserts, 24 well plates, 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nLet the ECM solution thaw on ice. Keep the ECM solution on ice to avoid solidification.",
    "Place the PET membrane culture inserts (pore size = 8.0 µm, filtration area = 0.3 cm2, filter diameter = 6.5 mm) into the wells of non-tissue culture treated 24 well plates. Label the plates as SV or ventricles for the SV or the endocardial angiogenesis assays, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Set up the inserts in separate plates for the SV and the ventricles when performing both cultures simultaneously. Make sure to set up enough wells for all the experimental samples and controls.\nAfter the ECM solution is thawed, immediately dilute ECM 1:2 in precooled basal medium (i.e., EBM-2 basal medium, see Table of Materials) to a sufficient volume (100 µL/insert x number of inserts).\n\tNOTE: For instance, if there are six inserts, then the total volume will be 100 µL x 6 = 600 µL. Add 200 µL of ECM into 400 µL of basal medium.\nCoat the inserts with 100 µL of freshly diluted ECM by adding it directly on top of the membrane. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for at least 30 min to allow the ECM to solidify.\n\tNOTE: This must be performed under a laminar flow tissue culture hood to avoid contamination.\n6. SVs and Whole Ventricles Cultures\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: 70% ethanol, transfer pipette, stereomicroscope, forceps, laminar flow tissue culture hood, microvascular endothelial cell supplement kit (Table of Materials), basal medium, 1x sterile PBS). Figure 6 shows the workflow of SV and ventricle culture.\nThaw out the contents of the supplement kit on ice. Prepare the complete medium by adding all the contents of the supplement kit into 500 mL of basal medium under a certified laminar flow tissue culture hood. Mix the medium well and distribute into 50 mL aliquots.",
    "Sterilize the base of the stereomicroscope and surrounding working area with 70% ethanol.\nObtain the tissue culture plates from step 5.4. With the aid of a transfer pipette, carefully transfer the explants from step 4.7 on top of the insert membrane. Under a stereomicroscope and with the aid of clean forceps, position the explants at the center of the inserts to ensure they are not stuck in the corner of the inserts or attached to the side walls.\nAfter the explants are placed and centered on the inserts, carefully remove any extra PBS from the inserts and close the lids of the plates.\nUnder a laminar flow tissue culture hood, add 100 µL of the prewarmed complete medium on top of the inserts and 200 µL into the wells to culture the explants at the air-liquid interface such that the basal surface of the insert is in contact with the medium, but the top surface is exposed to the air.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to adjust the volume to obtain an air-liquid interface if using different size inserts/well plates.\nAdd 300 µL of PBS into the unused wells of the 24 well plates and cover with the lid. Incubate the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, and grow the cultures for 5 days.\nIn the following days, routinely observe the cultures under an inverted light microscope to assess the status of the explant cultures. Make sure that the explants exhibit contractile beating and that all the explants are attached to the bottom of the membrane embedded with ECM. Take note of any floating explants.\n\tNOTE: The periodic contraction of the explants indicates that they are alive. Floating explants should be omitted from the analysis.",
    "After assessing the culture status, put the culture plate back into the incubator and continue to grow the culture for up to 5 days.\n7. Treatment of Cultures with VEGF-A (Positive Control)\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: laminar flow tissue culture hood, 1x PBS, basal medium + 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), basal medium + VEGF-A, pipettes, and pipette tips.\nPrepare the basal medium + 1% FBS and the basal medium + VEGF-A.\n\t\nTo prepare the basal medium + 1% FBS, first determine the number of control wells needed. For instance, if there are three control wells, then 300 µL/well x 3 = 900 µL is the total volume needed. Add 9 µL of FBS into 891 µL of basal medium to make the basal medium + 1% FBS.\nTo prepare the basal medium + VEGF-A, first determine the total number of wells needing VEGF-A medium. If there are three wells, then 300 µL/well x 3 = 900 µL is the total volume and 50 ng/well x 3 = 150 ng VEGF-A. Add 150 ng of VEGF-A into 900 µL of basal medium to make the basal medium + VEGF-A.\n\t\tNOTE: Assemble this solution at a larger volume than calculated to insure a sufficient number of smaller aliquots for each experiment.\nOn day 2, remove the media from both chambers (the inserts and the wells). Wash cultures with 300 µL of 1x PBS by adding 100 µL to the inserts and 200 µL into the wells. Firmly swirl the plates a few times and remove the PBS.\nAdd 300 µL of basal medium + 1% FBS (100 µL into the insert and 200 µL into the wells) to starve the cultures for 24 h.",
    "On day 3, after starvation, add 300 µL of basal medium + 1% FBS (100 µL into the insert and 200 µL into the wells) into the control wells and basal medium + VEGF-A (50 ng/well) into the treatment wells, respectively.\nAfter treatment, continue to grow the cultures in the incubator.\n8. Fixation and Immunostaining\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 1x PBS, primary and secondary antibodies, a shaker, 0.5% nonionic surfactant in PBS (PBT).\nOn the sixth day of culturing, remove the medium and wash cultures with 1x PBS at room temperature (RT).\n\t\nFix the cultures by adding 200 µL of 4% PFA solution into the wells and 100 µL into the inserts. Fix cultures in 4 °C for 20 min while rocking.\nAfter 20 min fixation, remove PFA from the cultures in a fume hood and wash the cultures with 1x PBS by adding 200 µL into the wells and 100 µL into the inserts.\nRepeat washes 3x, 10 min each, while rocking. Then proceed to perform immunostaining.\n\t\tNOTE: All the wash steps are performed on a benchtop at RT.\nDilute primary antibodies (anti-VE-Cadherin, anti-ERG 1/2/3) in blocking solution (5% donkey serum, 0.5% PBT). Add 300 µL of primary antibody solution (200 µL in the bottom wells and 100 µL into the inserts). Incubate cultures in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C while rocking.\n\tNOTE: Anti-VE-Cadherin is used to label the endothelial cell membrane and anti-ERG 1/2/3 is used to label the endothelial cell nucleus in order to visualize the angiogenic sprouts of endothelial cells.\nThe next day, wash and rock the culture plates 10x in 0.5% PBT, changing PBT every 10 min.",
    "Dilute the secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555) in blocking solution. Add 300 µL of the secondary antibody as in step 8.2 and incubate the cultures overnight at 4 °C while rocking. The next day, wash the secondary antibodies 10x in PBT, changing PBT every 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Wash a minimum of 10x but more washes are better. After the washes are complete, the cultures can be stored with 1x PBS until they are mounted onto slides.\n9. Mounting Cultures Onto Slides, Imaging, and Analysis\nNOTE: Before beginning, make sure to have the following equipment and reagents: fine forceps, slides, mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), coverslips, and confocal microscope. After secondary antibody staining, mount the cultures onto slides for imaging using the following steps.\nPeel off the membrane carefully from the insert using fine forceps and transfer it onto the slides by putting the membrane side down and placing the explant cultures upward. Place the replicate samples into the same slides and label the slides as control or VEGF-A. Add a few drops of mounting medium with DAPI directly onto the membrane and cover the slides with cover slips.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to avoid air bubbles while placing the coverslips.\nSeal off the edges of the slides with clear nail polish and let dry.\n\tNOTE: Slides can be stored in -20 °C for long-term storage.\nImage slides using a confocal microscope.\nPerform analysis to measure the length of angiogenic outgrowth. Quantify angiogenic outgrowth length by measuring the distance of the endothelial cells (Ve-Cadherin+/ERG 1/2/3+) extended from the inside boundary of the ERG 1/2/3+ cells in the ventricle cultures and from the center of the SV explants in the SV cultures.\n\t\nTo perform quantification using FIJI/ImageJ, first download FIJI software.",
    "Open image files in FIJI: go to File | Open | Folder | Filename | Open.\nGo to Analyze | Set Measurements | Select Perimeter.\nSelect the Straight Line tool from the main window.\nDraw a line across the length of a sprout as suggested in step 9.4.\nGo to Analyze | Measure.\n\t\tNOTE: Length measurements are displayed in the new window.\nPerform quantification in images that represent at least three randomly selected fields of view. Average the sprout length measurements and report them as mean ± standard deviation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
