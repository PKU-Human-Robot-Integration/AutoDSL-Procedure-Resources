    "In this model the rats or mice were given food and water ad libitum. The Texas A&M University Baylor College of Dentistry Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all the experimental protocols. Below specific settings are shown in italics and are utilized specifically for the rat TMJ arthritis model. Mice can also be utilized in this model and alternative tooth pain and myogenic orofacial pain animal models can be used as well42,43.\n1. Software Settings\nLoad the Animal Monitor software for the feeder units onto the computer.\nThe Animals Monitor software is now opened by clicking on the icon and under the file menu selection choose the \"configuration\" pull down option.\nIn the \"Animal Monitor Configuration\" window uncheck the box entitled \"Pellet Delivered Input\" (Figure 1A).\n\tNote: This box is usually checked at the factory by default. Deselect this option. Once the investigator deselects this option the results are being recorded by removal of a pellet from the trough rather than when a pellet is being dispensed.\n\tNote: When the \"Automatic File Naming\" box is checked the software will automatically name the files (Figure 1A). This box is usually checked at the factory by default.\nSet the timer lights to turn on at 06:00 (6:00 am) and to turn off at 20:00 (8:00 pm).\n\tNote: the hardware for the feeders units was modified so that the lights within the boxes are not controlled by the software but are wired instead to an isolated 24 hr timer. Thus, the \"House Light\" indicated on the configuration software was not functional in these examples.\nSelect the edit pull down menu and choose Experiment. A window with the title \"Box 01 -\" appears (Figure 1B).\nInput the file name under which the data will be saved within this window.",
    "Note: if no file name is entered the data files will be automatically named by the software. Details of the experiment can be added in this window and saved with the data files. The information on the window can also be saved and used for subsequent experiments.\nEnter a number greater than the total time of the experiment in the entry box entitled \"Experiment Length (Days):\".\n\tNote: This will ensure that the software saves the data until the experiment is complete, a mistake can be in setting this value too short, which will stop the software from recording the data even though animals are still in the feeding modules.\nEnter 24 in the entry box entitled \"Number of Hours in a Day\".\n\tNote: the length can be modified to the experimenter's specifications.\nEnter 10 in the box entitled \"Meal Period End Criteria (min):\"\n\tNote: for rats a meal was defined using a 10 min end of meal criterion based on previous studies48 (i.e. a meal was bracketed before and after by a 10 min period of no pellets being taken) and the minimum meal size was set at three pellets per meal in this software package.\nEnter 45 in the box entitled \"Pellet Size (mg)\". If an individual wanted to use mice input 20 within this window.\nFor rats add 45 mg rodent chow pellets to the feeder dispenser hopper.\n\tNote: for mice add 20 mg rodent chow pellets to the chow hopper.\nIn the \"Phase\" section of the Experiment window enter the term Day in the \"Name\" field and in the \"# of Hours\" field type 24 (Figure 1B).\n\tNote: below the \"Phase\" section there are two large open fields. The first large open field will be populated by the text entered in the previous \"Phase\" and \"Name\" fields.",
    "The next large open field will have the \"Day Phase\" header Enter in the field entitled \"Name\" the word Light and enter in the field entitled \"Percent\" the number 60.\n\tNote: this entered text will populate the large field below.\nNext enter in the field entitled \"Name\" the word Dark and enter in the field entitled \"Percent\" the number 40. Note: with these entries 60% of the day will be attributed to the light phase and 40% will be attributed to the dark phase. When the software calculates the meal patterns this information will be used. These settings typical for cycling female animals that are kept on a 14:10 light/dark cycle.\nSelect the \"Set All Boxes Like This\" button. Save this information and then hit OK.\nThe \"Start Boxes\" screen appears, select the feeders to activate and hit OK (Figure 1C).\nNext the Animal Monitor Run-Time windows will appear with the meal pattern data (Figure 1D).\n\tNote: monitor and record the \"# of Pellets Dispensed\" from this window to determine the current health of the rat. A healthy male rat weighing around 300 g will typically eat between 300-800 45 mg pellets a day.\nFiles are generated daily and automatically saved that have a .CSV extension. Open these files to retrieve meal pattern data such as food intake, meal number, meal duration, meal size, or intermeal interval. The intervals for these meal patterns can be calculated for the entire day or for a phase of the day such as the Dark and Light phase. As noted above, the settings are for a 14:10 light/dark cycle. The raw data of when each pellet was removed from the trough is also recorded as a raw .CSV file.",
    "Note: In older versions of the software a minimum meal size of 3 pellets is not used in the calculations for generating the .CSV file.  Moreover, to get the average meal duration using the older software you must subtract 10 min from the values in the Average Meal Duration column of the .CSV file.\n\tWhen the software is operating the operator can manually select the file pull down menu option and daily select \"save raw data\". This will save the raw data for a 24 hr period rather than for the entire experiment. This raw data can be processed by alternative software at the user's discretion.\n\tNote: in the results shown we used alternative software to include a minimum meal size of 3 pellets.\n2. Meal Duration Assay\nPlace individual rats in the sound-attenuated chambers equipped with photobeam computer-activated pellet feeders.",
    "Note: in these feeding units there are graduated water bottles and waste pans in which a sheet of thick absorbent paper is placed. In the feeder dispenser hopper 45 mg rodent chow pellets can be added for rats or 20 mg rodent chow pellets can be added for mice. Chow pellets are dispensed into a V shaped feeding trough and at the bottom of this trough is a photobeam. A pellet dispensed into the trough will be detected by breaking this photobeam. Once a rat removes this pellet from the feeder trough the photobeam is restored and this signals the computer to drop another pellet. Restoration of the photobeam also triggers the computer to record the date and time and keeps a running tally of the pellets dispensed. This tally of pellets is then analyzed to determine food intake, meal number, meal duration, meal size, or intermeal interval during any part of the day using Med Assoc. Inc. software. Again the raw .CSV data file can be analyzed by outside software39,40,49-51.\nRecord the total number of pellets eaten, the amount of water consumed and the weight of the animals to discern the general health of the rats during the experimentation.\nRinse water bottles and fill with fresh water daily and add chow to the feeder hopper when needed.\nDump waste pan and the thick absorbent paper beneath the cage daily and blow the dust from moving part of the feeder daily using high pressure air.\n\tNote: personal protection equipment (e.g. gowns, gloves, masks, and masks) is required.\nRemove floors, waste pans and water bottles after the experiment is completed and wash these components. Also, remove the feeding electronics from the caging wash by hand or in a dishwasher.\n3. Induction of TMJ Arthritis",
    "Place animals in the feeders at least 4 days before experimentation.\n\tNote: this data will be reported as predays to obtain a baseline feeding behavior. Then the animals are removed from the feeder for treatment. One type of treatment was to induce an arthritic TMJ. For this model rats are injected with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) at 08:00 (i.e. beginning of the light phase) after the rats are anesthetized with isoflurane (5% flow).\nInject 250 mg of CFA in 50 L bilaterally into the periarticular space of each TMJ.\n\tNote: in the example (Figure 2) 250 mg of CFA in 50 L was injected into each TMJ, but doses as low as 10 mg in volumes as small as 15 μl are effective over shorter periods of time52.\nInject control rats TMJ with 50 L of 0.9% saline. Note: all animals were mobile within 5 min or less after induction of anesthesia. In the event that a smaller dose of CFA is given in a lesser volume the control rats would receive this same volume of saline.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
