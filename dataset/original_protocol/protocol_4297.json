    "Determination of seed FA content and composition   Aliquot 0.4-2 mg of seeds into a 6 ml screw cap glass vial.   Add 10 µl pentadecanoin or heptadecanoin standard (1 µg/µl stock in toluene). The reason to choose these FAs as standards is that they are not presents in Arabidopsis seeds and do not overlap with other fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) during GC analysis.   Add 1 ml of 1 N methanolic-HCl.   Heat for 1.5 h at 80 °C in order to produce FAMEs.    Add 200 µl of hexane (100%).   Add 1.5 ml of 0.8% KCl and vortex for 10 sec. It’s important to add the hexane and KCl in this order to avoid artefacts.    Centrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 rpm at room temperature in order to induce a phase separation.    Pipet of 150 µl of the upper phase and transfer to a GC vial.   Run on GC column using the following parameters: 150 °C for 0.1 min, ramp up to 190 °C at 4 °C per min.    Analyse data and determine FA content per seed.    Retention times of different FAs can be determined by consulting literature or running standards. Figure 15 of the Arabidopsis book chapter about Acyl-Lipid metabolism shows the result of the GC analysis of Arabidopsis seed oil (Li-Beisson et al., 2010). On the Sigma-Aldrich website the separation of the Supelco 37 component FAME mix on different GC columns is described (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Supelco/Bulletin/t196907.pdf).  [href=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Supelco/Bulletin/t196907.pdf]     Determination of seed oil and moisture content by low-resolution time domain NMR spectroscopy   Construct oil and moisture calibration according to the ISO 10565:1998 standard (http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26317[href=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26317]). Use nine approximately 0.5 gr seed samples (between 5% and 10% moisture content and between approximately 30% and 55% oil content (r2 = 0.99).   Measure oil and moisture content of 0.5 grams of dry seeds.",
    "Normalize seed percentage oil content using 9% water content as reference.      Extraction for sucrose and protein content determination   Take samples of 10-20 intact seeds (minimum) in safe lock 2 ml Eppendorf tube.   Add 250 μl of 80% ethanol.   Vortex for 30 sec.   Heat samples at 80 °C for 20 min.   Centrifuge at 23,000 g for 5 min at room temperature.   Transfer the supernatant (S1) in another 2 ml Eppendorf tube on ice.   Add 150 μl of 80% ethanol.    Vortex for 30 sec.   Heat samples at 80 °C for 10 min.   Centrifuge at 23,000 g for 5 min at room temperature.   Transfer the supernatant (S2) in the corresponding tubes on ice.   Add 250 μl of 50% ethanol.   Vortex for 30 sec.   Heat samples at 80 °C for 10 min.   Centrifuge at 23,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.   Transfer the supernatant (S3) in the corresponding tubes on ice.   Store the tubes containing S1+S2+S3 at -20 °C.   Add 400 μl 0.1 M NaOH to the pellet.      Sugar and protein content determination (method optimized for microplate 96 wells)   Sugar content determination   In each well dispense: 50 μl of ethanolic extract (depending of your estimated concentration) The protein concentration depends on the species from which the samples are isolated. The amount of protein in the seeds of your species of interest can be checked in the literature.   160 μl of Reagent mix 1   Read OD at 340 nm for 10 min (until OD stabilizes).   Add 1 μl of HK per well.   Read OD at 340 nm until OD stabilizes (usually 25 min).   Add 1 μl of PGI per well.   Read OD at 340 nm until OD stabilizes (usually 25 min).   Add 1 μl of INV per well.   Read OD at 340 nm until OD stabilizes (usually 1.5 h).    Calculations.",
