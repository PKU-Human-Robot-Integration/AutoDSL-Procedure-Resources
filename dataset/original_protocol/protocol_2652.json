This usually occurs from passage number 8 and beyond (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Late-passage organoids also lose gene editing efficacy. We recommend using fresh biopsy specimens for each gene editing attempt to maximize efficacy, and to allow for onward experimental procedures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2309-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A comparison of cystic and differentiated organoids\n(A and B) Cystic organoids have the best growth potential and are required to perform gene editing with high efficacy. The organoids in (A) represents a cystic organoid with a thin wall and minimal extrusion into the core of the organoid. In contrast, the organoid in (B) has a thick wall and is darker, representing a differentiated organoid. Scale bar equals 100 μm.\nWarm EDTA harvesting solution to 37°C.\nEnsure a water bath has equilibrated to 37°C.\nSpecimen collection.\nA 1 × 1 cm surgical specimen of normal colonic tissue is sufficient for harvesting tens of thousands of crypts.\nMinimize warm ischemia time by placing the surgical tissue in cold FBS/PBS solution, and transporting the specimen to the laboratory in an ice box.\nNote: The addition of FBS provides serum support to the tissue before plating and improves culture efficiencies compared to PBS alone.\nWash the specimen in 25 mL of FBS/PBS in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and gently agitate the solution. Repeat twice.\nTransfer the specimen into 25 mL of EDTA harvesting solution in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and submerge the entire centrifuge tube in the water bath.\nBeginning at 0 min, shake the tube on a vortex or by hand.",
    "Repeat every 2 min for a total of 10 min. Crypts from the colonic tissue will be sloughed off into the EDTA harvesting solution.\nTransfer the specimen into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 25 mL of EDTA harvesting solution.\nAdd 25 mL of FBS/PBS to the previous EDTA harvesting solution containing crypts and store in an ice box.\nRepeat shaking of the new EDTA harvesting solution as per steps 5a and 5b.\nRemove the specimen and discard.\nAdd 25 mL of FBS/PBS to the second EDTA harvesting solution with crypts.\nCentrifuge both EDTA harvesting solution at 400 g × 6 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of FBS/PBS.\nPipette two 10 μL aliquots of the suspension to a cell culture dish and observe under the microscope.\nCount the number of crypts in each aliquot and take average. This gives the concentration of crypts in the crypt suspension.\nMultiple this by 500 to obtain the total number of crypts in the crypt pellet.\nAim to plate 300–350 crypts per 40 μL of BME.\nHaving decided the number of crypts required in total, transfer the total volume of crypt suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and top up to 5 mL with FBS/PBS.\nCritical: The majority of crypts will not survive the first few days. Plating too few crypts reduces the number of viable organoids generated. Plating too many crypts leads to competition between organoids for nutrients in the media and will require more frequent changing of media leading to increased utilization of resources and cost.\nNote: 40 μL of BME is used in step 8c as a reference as this is the volume of BME used for each well in a 24-well plate. Scale up or down as required.",
    "Alternatives: Many commercially available basement membrane extracts can be used, including Matrigel Matrix (Corning, Cat# 356255).\nCentrifuge at 400 g × 6 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and add BME based on the afore-calculated crypt to BME ratio.\nResuspend the crypt in BME.\nCritical: Avoid the formation of air bubbles as this leads to the integrity of BME being compromised after it solidifies.\nPlace in a 37°C incubator for 30 min to allow the BME to solidify.\nAdd 250 μL of penicillin/streptomycin and 25 μL of Y27632 to each 25 mL aliquot of human conditioned media.\nIf using a 24-well plate, add 500 μL of human conditioned media supplemented with antibiotics and Y27632 to each well and return plate to the incubator.\nChange media every 2–3 days or earlier if the media shows signs of acidification.\nNote: As discussed in step 8, seeding a high density of crypts will lead to increased need for media changes. This is especially so at earlier passages as cells proliferate most rapidly. Initial signs of acidification include changing of media color from red to orange/yellow if media containing phenol red has been used, as in this protocol. Organoids will exhibit reduced growth and may not survive if grown in overly acidic environments.\nOrganoids will form by the end of 7 days and will be ready for passage.\nPassaging of human colonic organoids\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step is critical to remove crypts which failed to become organoids. Performed well, organoids following this first passage may be used for RNP electroporation.\nRemove media from wells.\nPlace a 24-well plate in a 37°C incubator.",
    "Note: This plate will be used at the end of the experiment for seeding of the organoids. BME solidifies at temperatures above 15°C. Warming up the plate beforehand assists the stability of the BME droplet and prevents it from dispersing across the bottom of the well by solidifying quickly. This also allows for media to be added to the well earlier.\nIf using a 24-well plate, add 500 mL of Organoid Harvesting Solution to each well and place the plate on ice for at least 45 min.\nNote: Organoid harvesting solution depolymerizes the BME while leaving organoids intact. Using organoid harvesting solution ensures that the organoids can be separated more easily from the BME during centrifugation.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, aspirate the organoid harvesting solution, while breaking down any remnant BME, and transfer to a 15 mL centrifugation tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 g × 6 min at 4°C.\nGently aspirate the supernatant, leaving the cell pallet undisturbed, and resuspend the solution in Advanced DMEM+++.\nUse a P200 pipette to triturate the resuspension 100 times.\nAdd advanced DMEM+++ to 5 mL.\nCentrifuge at 400 g × 6 min at 4°C again.\nGently aspirate the supernatant, leaving the cell pallet undisturbed, and add BME.\nNote: The exact amount of BME to be added depends on the number of viable organoids. As an approximation, early passage organoids should enable expansion by 1:3 easily, whereas late passage organoids may only be expanded 1:1.5 to 1:2. Based on the amount of BME used in the previous passage, use this approximation to determine the volume of BME required.\nPlate organoids resuspended in BME into domes in each well of the 24-well plate.\nReturn the plate to the incubator.\nRNP electroporation for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing with multi-guide RNA\nTiming: 1 h\nSet up the Neon Transfection System.",
    "Alternatives: Alternative electroporation/nucleofection systems such as the Nucleofector™ (Lonza) or NEPA21 Super Electroporator (Nepagene) can be used.\nWarm the following items to 37°C.\n24-well plate.\nAdvanced DMEM++ (no antibiotics).\nHuman IntestiCult Organoid Growth Media.\nTrypLe Express.\nAlternatives: Instead of using IntestiCult, human conditioned media as prepared previously can be used. However, this needs to be modified by removing antibiotics as the presence of antibiotics in electroporated cells can reduce its viability.\nSet up the following:\n25 mL of Advanced DMEM++ with 25 μL of Y27632 added.\nA 15 mL centrifuge tube with 10 μL of Y27632 added.\nPrepare a 1.5 mL microtube with 750 μL of the solution from step 30a.\nRemove media from wells.\nNote: In our experience, 4 wells in a 24-well plate of fully confluent organoid domes constitutes one reaction. Note the number of reactions as this impacts the volume of downstream reagents to be used.\nAdd 500 μL of TrypLe to each well, breaking down the BME dome, and transferring the suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube from step 30b.\nSubmerge the centrifuge tube in a 37°C water bath for 10 min in total.\nAt 5 min, triturate the organoid suspension with a P1000 pipette 10 times.\nRepeat at 7.5 min, and at 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 400 g × 6 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 10 μL/reaction of Buffer T.\nSet up the RNP complex as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2309_6.csv\nNote: It is important to optimize the molar ratios of the Cas9 to the multi-guide RNA. In the above formula, the Cas9 and multi-guide RNA are at 25 μM and 100 μM concentrations respectively. The corresponding volumes give a molar ratio of 1:4, which in our experience, optimizes transfection efficacy with the amount of reagents utilized.",
    "Note: The multi-guide RNA consists of three different gRNAs targeting a region in proximity with each other. This combination ensures a large knockout is generated. The sequences used in this protocol have been included in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. In the multi-guide RNA, the concentration of each individual gRNA is equal.\nLeave the RNP complex at room temperature for 10 min.\nPlace 3 mL of Buffer E into the disposable Neon Tube.\nSelect the following settings on the Neon device:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2309_7.csv\nNote: The above settings have been optimized for adult human intestinal organoids and may need to be optimized for other cell types.\nMix the cell suspension with the RNP complex; they should be in equal volumes if measured correctly.\nUse the Neon pipette to aspirate 10 μL of the suspension, place into the Neon Pipette Station and press “Start” on the Neon device interface to trigger the electroporation.\nNote: The Neon pipette tip should be changed after 2 electroporation triggers, while the Neon Tube should be changed after 10 electroporation triggers.\nImmediately after electroporation, transfer cells to a 1.5 mL microtube from step 31. Leave to rest at room temperature for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 400 g × 6 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, and add 40 μL/well of BME.\nPlate on 24-well plate and leave in a 37°C incubator for 30 min.\nAdd 500 μL of human IntestiCult to each well.\nAfter 48 h, change media to human conditioned media. Refresh every 2–3 days.\nImmunofluorescent staining of organoids\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Following electroporation, organoids should be allowed to recover and proliferate for 7–10 days, after which they may be passaged as normal. It is essential to validate that successful gene editing has occurred. This can be done via Sanger sequencing and Western blot, for which standard techniques apply. Another approach for validation is immunofluorescent staining, which is described in this section.\nPrepare Organoid blocking solution as follows, and keep on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2309_8.csv\nNote: It is important to make the Organoid staining solution fresh each time.\nFix organoids by adding 500 μL of 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM PBS to each well.\nIncubate the cell culture at room temperature for 30 min.\nCritical: Perform in a chemical fume hood as fixative chemicals are toxic. Be careful not to come into contact with fumes. Never perform in a biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare PBSB as follows, and keep on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2309_9.csv\nNote: Transfer pipettes should always be coated with PBSB before use.\nUsing a transfer pipette, remove fixative and gently add ice-cold DPBS to each well.\nTransfer fixed organoids into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and add ice-cold DPBS to 10 mL. Invert the tube gently.\nCritical: Do not vortex or centrifuge as this may damage the organoids.\nOn ice, allow organoids to settle under gravity. This usually takes about 10 min.\nRemove supernatant. Fill tubes with appropriate Organoid blocking solution and incubate with gentle agitation for 3 h at room temperature.\nAllow organoids to settle under gravity for 10 min.\nPrepare diluted mouse anti-FBXW7 antibody 1:100 in Organoid blocking solution.\nNote: Antibody dilution concentrations need to be optimized for individual antibodies.\nRemove supernatant and replace with diluted FBXW7 antibody.\nCritical: Samples must be protected from light and kept at 4°C from this step.",
    "Incubate organoids with primary antibodies for 24 h with gentle agitation.\nPrepare Organoid washing solution as follows, and keep on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2309_10.csv\nAllow organoids to settle under gravity for 10 min.\nRemove supernatant. Wash organoids with Organoid washing solution, inverting the tube carefully 10 times.\nRepeat steps 62 and 63 another 3 times.\nNote: It is very important to wash off primary antibodies as over exposure to primary antibodies will lead to nonspecific staining of sample and poor image quality.\nAllow organoids to settle under gravity for 10 min.\nPrepare diluted goat anti-mouse antibody at 1 μg/mL in Organoid washing solution.\nIncubate organoids with secondary antibodies for 2 h with gentle agitation.\nRepeat steps 62–64.\nNote: Staining should remain visible under a fluorescence microscope for weeks.\nOptional: Phalloidin staining. Incubate organoids for 30–60 min in DPBS with fluorescent phalloidin diluted 1:400, at room temperature with gentle agitation and light protection. Wash organoids twice with DPBS.\nOptional: DAPI staining. Prepare DAPI to working concentration of 300 nM in DPBS. Incubate organoids in DAPI for 1–5 min at room temperature. Wash organoids twice with DPBS.\nNote: Stain should remain visible for 1 week."
