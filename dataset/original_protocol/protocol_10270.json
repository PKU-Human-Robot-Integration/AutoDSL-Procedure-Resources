(a) Yb:YAG thin-disk Kerr-lens mode-locked oscillator. The 13 m linear cavity of the oscillator consists of a 13% transmission output coupler, three high-dispersion mirrors with GDD of -3,000 fs2, 1 mm sapphire Kerr medium, and a copper hard aperture. A pulse picker, containing a 25 mm-thick BBO crystal, is used to reduce the repetition rate to 5 kHz. (b) CPA. First block: the pulse stretcher setup containing two antiparallel gold gratings (1,740 lines/mm), where the seed pulses are temporally stretched to approximately 2 ns. Second block: the regenerative amplifier, where the seed pulse is confined in the amplifier cavity for amplification when the high voltage of the Pockels cell, which contains a BBO crystal with a thickness of 20 mm, is applied. Third block: the pulse compressor containing two parallel dielectric gratings (1,740 lines/mm), where the amplified pulses are temporally compressed down to 1 ps.

    "Use two mirrors after the pulse picker setup to align the picked pulses through the stretcher setup, if required.\n\tNOTE: The stretcher contains two antiparallel gold gratings (see the Table of Materials, No. 20 and 21) with a line density of 1,740 lines/mm to stretch the pulses to a duration of 2 ns to avoid damaging the optics during the amplification process in the regenerative amplifier due to a high peak intensity. These pulses are used to seed the regenerative amplifier, as described in the next section (Figure 1b, top).\n3. Regenerative Amplifier\nCaution; Be aware of all relevant electrical safety regulations before applying the high voltage to the Pockels cell. Use appropriate high-voltage isolation.
