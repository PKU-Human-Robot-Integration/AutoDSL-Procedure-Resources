    "Perform all cell handling and reagent preparation within a Biosafety Cabinet. Ensure all surfaces, materials, and equipment that come into contact with cells are sterile (i.e., spray down with 70% ethanol). Cells should be cultured in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. All hiPSC culture and differentiation is performed in 6-well plates.\n1. Microfluidic device creation (approximate duration: 1 week)\nPhotolithography\n\tNOTE: The mask, designed using the CAD file (provided as Supplementary File 1), contains the design of the microfluidic channel. Print the design on a transparent mask. Then, perform standard photolithography with the negative photoresist SU8 2075 on a 4-inch silicon wafer within a cleanroom.\n\t\nClean a silicon wafer with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dry with nitrogen. Bake at 200 °C for 5 min for dehydration.\n\t\tNOTE: Handle the wafer with wafer tweezers.\nPlace the wafer in the spin-coater. Deposit 3-4 mL of SU8 in the center of the wafer, then spin to form a layer of 200 µm (i.e., ramp up 15 s to 500 rpm, spin for 10 s, ramp up 5 s to 1,200 rpm, and spin for 30 s, then downspin for 15 s until stopped).\nRemove wafer and soft bake for 7 min at 65 °C, then 45 min at 95 °C.\nMove the wafer to a mask aligner and place the transparent mask in the mask holder with a UV filter. Expose the wafer to 2 cycles of 230 mJ/cm2, with 30 s delay, for a total exposure of 460 mJ/cm2.\nPerform a post-exposure bake on the exposed wafer in a 50 °C oven overnight.",
    "Turn off the oven the next morning, and after the wafer has cooled to room temperature, submerge it in SU8-developer. Remove the wafer from the developer every 5 min and wash with IPA, then place it back in the developer.\nAfter around 20 min, or when the IPA runs clear, dry the wafer with air nitrogen and hard bake in an oven set to 150 °C; as soon as the oven reaches 150 °C, turn it off but do not open. Leave the wafer in the oven until it has reached room temperature, then remove the wafer.\nConfirm the height of SU8 with a profilometer and the optical features with a light microscope. Once confirmed, tape the wafer inside a 150 mm plastic Petri dish.\nSoft lithography\n\t​NOTE: The wafer, taped to the Petri dish, needs to be silanized to prevent adherence of the PDMS to the SU8 features.\n\t\nInvert the wafer (tapped to a plastic Petri dish) over a glass Petri dish of the same size containing 0.4 mL of methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) and expose the wafer to the vapors for 4 min. Turn the wafer upright and place the lid on the Petri dish.\nMix 30 g of silicone elastomer base to the curing agent at a 10:1 ratio. Take the lid off the Petri dish and pour the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on the wafer, then degas within a desiccator.\nOnce all bubbles are gone, place the wafer at 80 °C for 1.5 h to cure the PDMS.\nCarefully peel off the PDMS, and punch inlets and outlets for the tissue ports and media channels with a 1 mm and 1.5 mm biopsy punch, respectively.",
    "Clean the PDMS channels with tape to remove dust. Next, soak the coverslips (18 x 18 mm, No.1) in 70% ethanol for at least 15 min. Then, dry these off with tissue wipes.\nSubject both the coverslips and PDMS channels (feature side exposed) to the plasma (setting on high) for 1 min, then quickly bond together and place in an 80 °C oven overnight to secure the bond.\n\t\tNOTE: During bonding, it is essential to apply mild pressure on the edges of the PDMS channels to ensure a good seal between the PDMS and glass while avoiding the channel itself to prevent channel collapse.\nDevice preparation\nSubmerge the bonded PDMS devices in deionized water (DI H2O) and autoclave with the liquid cycle. Next, aspirate the liquid from the devices and autoclave again with the gravity cycle. Then, dehydrate the sterilized devices overnight at 80 °C.\n2. Stem cell culture (approximate duration: 1-2 months)\nhiPSC culture and maintenance\n\tNOTE: The hiPSCs need to be cultured for three consecutive passages after thawing in vitro before cryopreservation or differentiation. hiPSCs are cultured in either E8 or mTeSR1 medium, depending on the cell line, on the basement membrane matrix-coated plates24.\n\t\nTo coat plates with hESC-quality basement membrane matrix, thaw one aliquot of the matrix medium (lot-dependent volume, generally 200-300 µL; stored at -80 °C) by adding it to 25 mL of DMEM/F-12K on ice. Dispense 1 mL of this suspension into each well of a 6-well plate. Leave the plate in the incubator at 37 °C for at least 1 h.\nUpon thawing, modify the E8 media for hiPSC culture by adding 5 µM of Y-2763225 (E8+RI). Use this media for 24 h afterward, then change the media to fresh E8.",
    "NOTE: For routine media changes, unmodified E8 media is used for hiPSC culture. For regular maintenance, E8 media must be changed every day, approximately 24 h after the previous media change.\nPassage cells at Day 3 or Day 4, aspirate media, then wash each well with 1 mL of 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered solution (DPBS).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the cells are around 70% confluent. Do not let them grow beyond 70% confluency.\nAspirate the DPBS, then add 1 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA to each well and incubate at room temperature for 6-7 min.\nCarefully aspirate EDTA, add 1 mL of E8+RI into each well and blast against the surface with a 1 mL pipette (~5-10 times to collect all of the cells). Collect the cell suspension in a 15 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCount the cell suspension and passage at the desired cell density (i.e., ~200 K per well) in E8+RI.\nChange media to E8 (without RI) 24 h after. Do not leave the cells with RI for more than 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: E8 should not be heated to 37 °C. Always leave it at room temperature for warming before cell culture.\nCardiomyocyte (CM) directed differentiation\n\tNOTE: It is important to note the existence of heterogeneity among different lines of the hiPSCs26,27, so the following steps may need to be optimized for each cell line. Follow the steps below for CM differentiation.\n\t\nPrepare RPMI + B27 - insulin by adding 10 mL of B27 minus insulin and 5 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) to 500 mL of RPMI 1640.\nPrepare RPMI + B27 + insulin by adding 10 mL of B27 and 5 mL of pen/strep to 500 mL of RPMI 1640.",
    "Prepare RPMI minus glucose + B27 + insulin by adding 10 mL of B27, 5 mL of pen/strep, and 4 mM sodium lactate to 500 mL of RPMI 1640 without glucose.\nOnce the hiPSCs reach 85% confluency, begin differentiation (Day 0) by replacing the old medium with 4 mL of the RPMI + B27 - insulin medium containing 10 µM CHIR99021 to each well of a 6-well plate (i.e., add 25 µL of 10 mM CHIR99021 into 25 mL of RPMI + B27 - insulin and then immediately add 4 mL per well).\n\t\tNOTE: CHIR99021 is a GSK inhibitor and leads to Wnt activation. The optimal concentration of CHIR99021 and initial confluency varies for each cell line28. Always check a concentration gradient of 6-12 µM CHIR99021 and a series of seeding densities before the actual experiment to determine optimal conditions for initiating differentiation.\nExactly 24 h later (Day 1), aspirate the medium and replace with 5 mL of prewarmed RPMI + B27 - insulin to each well.\nExactly 72 h after CHIR99021 addition (Day 3), collect 2.5 mL of the spent medium from each well of the 6-well plate, totaling 15 mL of the spent medium in a tube.\nTo this, add 15 mL of fresh RPMI + B27 - insulin medium. Add IWP2 to a concentration of 5 µM to the combined medium tube (i.e., 1 µL of IWP2 at 5 mM per 1 mL of combined medium or 30 µL of IWP2 into 30 total mL media).",
    "Remove ~1.5 mL of the remaining medium per well of the plate so that 1 mL of the medium remains. Swirl the plate vigorously to ensure adequate removal of cell debris. Then, aspirate the rest of the old medium and add 5 mL of the combined medium containing IWP2 per well of the plate.\n\t\t​NOTE: The addition of IWP2 to the cells leads to Wnt inhibition.\nOn Day 5, aspirate the medium from each well and replace it with 5 mL of prewarmed RPMI + B27 - insulin.\nCM Maturation: On Day 7, Day 9, and Day 11, aspirate the medium from each well and replace it with 5 mL of prewarmed RPMI + B27 + insulin. Spontaneous beating should be observed around these days.\nCM Purification: On Day 13 and Day 16, start glucose starvation by aspirating the medium from each well, washing each well with 1 mL of 1x DPBS, and then adding 5 mL of prewarmed RPMI minus glucose + B27 + insulin, supplemented with 4 mM sodium lactate.\nOn Day 19, aspirate the spent medium and replace it with 5 mL of prewarmed RPMI + B27 + insulin to each well to allow for cell recovery after purification.\nOn Day 21, replate cells, following the below described CM dissociation protocol (step 3.3). Aim to plate 1.5-2 x 106 cells per well in a 6-well plate. For example, if it is a highly efficient differentiation, generally expanding the 6 wells into 9 wells is good.\nFrom Day 21 on, aspirate the medium from each well and replace it with 4 mL of RPMI + B27 + insulin every 2-3 days.\n\t\t​NOTE: The hiPSC-CMs are ready for experimental use after Day 23.\n3. Creation of 3D cardiac tissue within the microfluidic device: (Approximate duration: 2-3 h)\nhCF culture",
    "Culture human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs; obtained commercially from Lonza) in T75 flasks (at 250K cells per flask) in Fibroblast Growth Media-3 (FGM3). Change the media every other day, and passage when at 70% confluent. Use the hCFs before passage 10, as they may start to differentiate to myofibroblasts at high passages29.\nhCF dissociation\nTo dissociate the hCFs, first take out the flask from the incubator. Put the flask inside the biosafety cabinet and begin aspirating the spent media from the flask. Then, wash the T75 flask with 3 mL of 1x DPBS. Close the cap and swirl the flask.\nAspirate the DPBS. Take 3 mL of prewarmed 1x Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) and add it to the flask. Tilt the flask and swirl to coat the bottom. Leave it in a 37 °C incubator for 4-6 min, checking the flask under a microscope to ensure cells are detaching, as evidenced through the round cell shape and floating cells. If not, then put the flask back in the incubator for another minute.\nNeutralize the trypsin action by adding 3 mL of prewarmed FGM3 to the flask. Then, pipette the solution up and down against the bottom of the flask to dislodge the CFs.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take 10 µL of the cell suspension and dispense it in a hemocytometer to count the cells with a microscope.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 x g for 4 min. Aspirate the supernatant being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in fresh FGM3, to make a desired 75 x 106 cells/mL. Either passage a portion (250K cells per T75 flask) or follow the below protocol to generate 3D cardiac tissue.\nCM dissociation",
    "​NOTE: After differentiation and purification, prepare the CMs for use in the injection into microfluidic devices.\n\t\nTake the plate of CMs out of the incubator and aspirate the media. Then wash the wells with 1 mL of 1x DPBS per well of a 6-well plate. Take 6 mL of DPBS and pipette 1 mL per well.\nAspirate the DPBS being careful not to disturb the cells attached to the plate. Pipette 6 mL of warm cell detachment solution (e.g., TrypLE express) and add 1 mL per well. Incubate the cells in a 37 °C incubator for 10 min.\nNeutralize the enzyme with an equal volume of RPMI + B27+ insulin (i.e., 1 mL per well) and mechanically dissociate the cells by pipetting up and down against the culture vessel with a 1 mL pipette.\nCollect the CMs in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of RPMI + B27 + insulin. Pipette the solution up and down with a 1 mL pipette to ensure proper mixing. Take 10 µL of the cell suspension and dispense it in a hemocytometer to determine the total cell number.\nCentrifuge the cells again at 300 x g for 3 min (to ensure complete removal of TrypLE), and aspirate the supernatant. Then, add an appropriate volume of RPMI + B27 + insulin to achieve 75 x 106 cells/mL.",
    "NOTE: If cardiac differentiation/selection does not result in high CM% (i.e., >80%), as evidenced through immunostaining or flow cytometry for CM-specific proteins like cTnT, do not consider cells as suitable for the tissue formation. The differentiation process should be optimized when this happens via adjustment of CHIR99021 concentrations and initial starting density. If CM purification needs improvement, other methods can be utilized, such as sorting for CMs with either fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)30,31,32.\nCollagen preparation\n\tNOTE: Prepare collagen from the high concentration of collagen stock (ranging from 8-11 mg/mL). The collagen used to create the cell:hydrogel mixture is at 6 mg/mL, and the final concentration is 2 mg/mL. Depending on the number of devices to inject, the volume of collagen solution to be made needs to be back calculated.\n\t\nKeep all the required reagents on ice inside a biosafety hood.\n\t\t​NOTE: Collagen is a thermoresponsive hydrogel. Therefore, the temperature needs to remain low to prevent premature polymerization.\nTake 75 µL of stock collagen (8 mg/mL) and dispense it in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. Collagen solution is very viscous, so slowly aspirate it with a pipette.\nTake 13.85 µL of media (i.e., RPMI + B27 + insulin) and dispense it in the same tube.\nThen take 10 µL of phenol red and add to the mixture and resuspend.\nLastly, take 1.15 µL of 1N NaOH and add to the suspension.\nUsing a 200 µL pipette tip, resuspend the suspension.",
    "NOTE: The stock collagen has an acidic pH, necessitating the addition of NaOH to neutralize before using it to encapsulate the cardiac cells. Phenol red acts as a pH indicator; therefore, add this before the NaOH addition. At this point, the collagen solution will be yellow, denoting its acidity. After the addition of NaOH, the solution should turn orange to light pink, indicating its neutralization.\nHydrogel mixture and cell preparation\n\t​NOTE: In this step, the encapsulation of the cells within the collagen-based hydrogel is done. The cells, as well as all hydrogel precursors, should be placed on ice during the next steps.\n\t\nAt this point, if the CFs have not yet been trypsinized, store the CM suspension in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, with the lid unscrewed to allow gas flow, within a 37 °C incubator. In parallel, dissociate the CFs and collect at a density of 75 x 106 cells/mL for device loading.\nMix the suspended CMs with CFs at a 4:1 ratio. Take an aliquot of 8 µL of CMs and add to a fresh centrifuge tube on ice. Then take 2 µL of CFs and add to the cell suspension in the centrifuge tube.\nResuspend the cell suspension, grab 5.6 µL of the cell suspension, and put it in a fresh microcentrifuge tube.\nTake 4 µL of the collagen just prepared in the above steps and add to a 4:1 CM:CF mixture. Add 2.4 µL of Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) basement membrane matrix, making the final cell density as 35 x 106 cells/mL for the device injection. Pipette the mixture up and down to ensure that the cell suspension is homogenous.\nDevice insertion\n\tNOTE: Once the cell:hydrogel mixture is prepared, it needs to be inserted into the devices.",
    "Take autoclaved microfluidic devices out of the 80 °C oven and set them in the Biosafety Cabinet for at least 1 h before the cell suspension insertion to allow the devices to cool to room temperature while maintaining sterility.\nPlace the devices in 60 x 15 mm Petri dishes, at 3-4 devices per dish. Fill a 150 x 15 mm Petri dish with a thin layer DI H2O to hold 3 of the 60 x 15 mm Petri dishes. This step creates a humidified environment surrounding the microfluidic devices.\nUse a new tip and resuspend the cell:hydrogel mixture thoroughly by pipetting the suspension while the tube remains on ice.\nInsert the tip into the injection port of the device and slowly and steadily inject 3 µL of the cell:hydrogel suspension into the tissue region inlet of a microfluidic device using a 20 µL pipette tip. Once the port is filled, stop the injection and remove the tip. Repeat for all the devices, or the entirety of prepared hydrogel suspension.\n\t\t​NOTE: The small volume of the cell:hydrogel suspension heats up/cools down very quickly, so it is pertinent to keep the suspension on ice for as long as possible. When inserting, pipette the solution off the ice and insert into devices as quickly as possible, as the hydrogel may start to polymerize in the pipette tip. It is important to create small volumes of the cell:hydrogel suspension at a time, so if many devices are to be injected, the cell:hydrogel suspension will have to be made fresh for each set of 4 devices.\nFlip the devices within their Petri dishes with tweezers and place them inside the large Petri dish with water. Incubate in a 37 °C incubator for 9 min for hydrogel polymerization.",
    "Take the devices out of the incubator, flip the devices upright, and incubate at 37 °C for 9 min to complete hydrogel polymerization.\nInject RPMI + B27 + insulin into the flanking media channels (~20 µL per device). Place the devices back in the incubator at 37 °C. Change the media within the media channels with fresh RPMI + B27 + insulin every day. The devices have been demonstrated to be cultured from 14-21 days20.\n\t\t​NOTE: Due to the small volume of media per chip, to prevent evaporation of media, it is important to maintain the devices within a large Petri dish filled with DI H2O, which serves as a humidified chamber. Additionally, small droplets of excess RPMI + B27 + insulin can be pipetted on the top of the channel inlets/outlets during routine media changes.\n4. Tissue analysis\nLive Imaging\n\tNOTE: All live imaging should be performed with a stage incubator to maintain 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\nPlace devices in an environmentally-controlled stage incubator. Record 30 s videos of multiple spots within each device at the maximal frame rate.\nTo assess tissue contractility after extracting the beating signals, use the supplementary custom-written MATLAB code to extract peaks (Supplementary File 2) for calculating inter-beat interval variability.\nChange media in devices in the cell culture hood, then place back in cell culture incubator.\nImmunofluorescent staining\nPrepare PBS-Glycine: Dissolve 100 mM glycine in PBS and add 0.02% NaN3 for long-term storage. Adjust pH to 7.4.\nPrepare PBS-Tween-20: Add 0.05% Tween-20 to PBS and add 0.02% NaN3 for long-term storage. Adjust pH to 7.4.\nPrepare IF buffer: Add 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween-20 to PBS, and add 0.02% NaN3 for long-term storage. Adjust pH to 7.4.",
    "Prepare 10% Goat serum: Resuspend the lyophilized goat serum in 2 mL of PBS to make 100% goat serum. Then, dilute the 2 mL with 18 mL of PBS to make 10% goat serum.\nFix the samples by adding 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to the tissue channels and incubating at 37 °C for 20 min.\nWash the cells by adding PBS-Glycine to the tissue channels 2x for 10 min incubation at room temperature.\nWash the cells by adding PBS -Tween-20 for 10 min at room temperature.\nPermeabilize the cells by adding IF buffer to the tissue channels for 30 min at room temperature.\nBlock the cells by adding 10% goat serum solution to the tissue channels for 1 h at room temperature.\nDilute the non-conjugated primary antibodies in 10% goat serum at desired concentrations (refer to Supplementary File 3), add to the tissue channels, and incubate the samples at 4 °C overnight.\nThe following day, wash the samples by adding PBS-Tween-20 to tissue channels 3x for 20 min each at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: From step 4.2.12 on, perform all tasks in the dark, so the samples are protected from light.\nDilute the secondary antibodies in PBS-Tween-20 at desired concentrations, centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min to collect any precipitates, then add to the tissue channels.\nAfter 30 min-1 h, wash the samples with PBS-Tween-20 3x for 10 min each at room temperature.\nAdd anti-fade or desired mounting medium to the tissue channels. Then, the samples can be imaged using fluorescence microscopy or with a confocal microscope, if higher magnification is desired. To visualize the entire 3D tissue, images at different z-planes can be stacked and reconstructed to form representative 3D images.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
