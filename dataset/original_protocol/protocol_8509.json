    "1. Device Fabrication\nNOTE: See reference1.\nNOTE: Silicon master molds were fabricated using standard photolithographic techniques for patterning SU-8 photoresist on a silicon master1,7. Photomasks for wafer patterning were printed at 25,000 dpi. The male-adapted device features a Chronis Olfactory Chip design19 with a change in the worm loading port, adapting a design obtained from M. Zimmer (personal correspondence, 2016). A turn is included to control the rotation of the animals. The width of the worm loading port channel is narrowed to 50 μm. All channels are 32 μm tall. Once a silicon master mold is available to the user, the user can follow the subsequent protocol, as described previously1.\nMix PDMS base and curing agent at a 10:1 ratio by weight.\nMix thoroughly with transfer pipettes.\nDegas the mixture in a vacuum desiccator for 1 h, until all visible bubbles are removed.\nPour the mixture onto a silicon mold master in a 150 mm diameter dish until it is 5 mm thick (100 g). Use a Pasteur pipette to remove any bubbles or dust that have been introduced to the mixture.\nBake at 65 °C for at least 3 h, or overnight.\nCut the PDMS away from the mold using a scalpel and cut the separate devices apart using a razor blade.\nPunch inlet and outlet holes with a 1 mm dermal punch.\nFlush the holes with dH2O, ethanol, and again with dH2O to remove particles from the punches. Dry the device in an air stream pulse.\nClean both channel sides and the top side of the device with adhesive tape, removing any dust or debris remaining on the device to allow for successful bonding.\nPlasma-bond the device, channel-side down, to a no. 1 cover glass.",
    "Expose cover glass and device (channel-side up) to air plasma using conditions that allow for proper bonding, such as 100 W for 30 s or 24 W for 60 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Settings can be adjusted to improve the bonding efficiency. The plasma-bonding conditions are not as critical as proper cleaning when attempting to improve the bonding efficiency. An insufficiently cleaned device will not bond, even under ideal plasma conditions.\nInvert the cover glass onto the channel side of the device and press down with the thumb for 5 s.\n2. Buffer Preparation\nDilute 1x S Basal (100 mM NaCl and 0.05 M KPO4, pH 6.0) from a sterile 10x stock.\nDilute 1 M tetramisole stock to a final concentration of 1 mM in 1x S Basal for all buffer solutions.\nAdd fluorescein to both the \"flow control\" and \"buffer\" reservoirs.\nCreate a 100-mg/mL stock of fluorescein in 1x S Basal.\nDilute the stock to final concentrations of 1 µg/mL in the flow control and 0.1 µg/mL in the buffer.\nCreate the stimuli.\nDilute glycerol to a final concentration of 1 M in 1X S Basal.\nDilute ascaroside #3 (ascr#3) to a final concentration of 1 µM into 1X S Basal.\n3. Device Setup\nNOTE: See1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56026/56026fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Microfluidic device setup. (A) Reservoirs and tubing. A 30 mL syringe without a plunger serves as the \"reservoir.\" This is attached to a Luer valve with three flow options. One outlet is connected to a 3 mL syringe with a plunger, while the other is connected to a needle (orange) that is inserted into the tubing that connects to the microfluidic device. (B) The overall setup of the microfluidic imaging experiment. The device is placed on a stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope, above the objective lenses. The \"flow control\" buffer travels through a 3-way valve that is controlled by a unit on the shelf above the setup. Lines containing buffers are then inserted into the appropriate device ports. (C) The ports of the microfluidic device. The \"flow control\" ports flank the other inlet ports: the \"stimulus\" and \"buffer\" ports. The \"outlet\" port is the right-most port. Due to the location of the worm loading arena, the \"worm loading\" port is the central-most port on the device.

Connect the needle to tubing that extends to the microfluidic device (as in Figure 1A-B).\nRemove the air bubbles from the reservoir and tubing.\nFill the 3 mL syringe with attached tubing with 1x S Basal and insert it into the outlet port.\nGently apply pressure to the syringe until the buffer appears at the top of the inlet holes.",
    "Connect the flow control, buffer, and stimulus tubing to appropriate inlet holes (as in Figure 1B-C), ensuring that liquid drops are present on both the loading port hole and the buffer tubing to be attached.\nAgain, gently apply pressure to the syringe that is connected to the outlet port until droplets appear in the worm loading port inlet.\nInsert a solid blocking pin into the worm loading port.\nRemove the syringe from the outlet port and attach the outlet line connected to the house vacuum (-670 Torr).\nInspect the device for any bubbles in the flow channels, visually and through video confirmation via a software compatible with the camera used, such as the open-source software Micro-Manger. See step 6 for tips on using Micro-Manager.\nIf any bubbles are present, wait for them to dislodge or be absorbed into the PDMS wall prior to loading any animals; the presence of bubbles will disturb the proper flow of fluids through the device.\nUsing a GFP filter, confirm proper flow dynamics within the device prior to worm loading by actuating the 3-way valve and observing the switching of buffers.\nDetermine the proper flow dynamics: observe the fluorescein present in the flow control and buffer solutions (Figure 2D-2E) changing when the flow control value is changed by pressing the control button corresponding to the 3-way valve on the perfusion controller software (Figure 1B).\nAfter opening Micro-Manager, click on \"Live\" to observe a live image of the device. Turn on the fluorescent light source to observe the flow of buffers in the device (Figure 2D-2E).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56026/56026fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: A male-adapted microfluidic olfactory chip. (A) The flow patterns of the device when the worm is exposed to buffer. Buffer (B) is shown in brown, and flow control (FC) is shown in yellow, with stimulus (S) in white. The worm loading port has been adapted to include a curve, which allows for better control of worm orientation. (B) The flow patterns of the device when the worm is exposed to stimulus. Buffer (B) is shown in brown, and flow control (FC) is shown in yellow, with stimulus (S) in white. (C) Measurements of the adapted device as fabricated. The worm loading port ends in a 42 µm opening, with a 50 µm channel designed for the male width. The measured height of the channels is 32 µm, despite a target of 25 µm in the design. (D-E) A trapped male expressing psra-6::GCaMP3. The sra-6 promoter is not ASH-specific, and some expression may be observed in the ASI neuron, although no calcium transients were observed in ASI. The image is (D) a combination of bright-field and fluorescent illumination, while (E) is fluorescent only. The scale bars denote 42 µm. (F) The ASH neuron responds to 1 M glycerol stimulation with robust neural activity. The blue area denotes the time of the 1 M glycerol stimulus. The shaded region denotes the standard error, with n = 20 pulses from seven worms. The red traces denote depolarizing responses. The Y-axes show ΔF/F0. The scale bar denotes 5 s.

Animal Preparation\nNOTE: See reference23.\nImaging ASH responses to 1 M glycerol.",
    "Place approximately 20 C. elegans males that are positive for psra-6::GCaMP3 array expression onto a nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plate seeded with a lawn of OP50 E. coli. Use the expression of fluorescent GECI and/or a co-injection marker for the identification of array-positive animals.\n\t\tNOTE: Array positive animals will fluoresce according to the GECI used (i.e., animals expressing GCaMP will fluoresce green under blue-light stimulation, while RCaMP animals will fluoresce red under green-light stimulation). Co-injection markers can range from other fluorescent proteins, such as GFP and RFP, to phenotypic markers, such as rol-6, or can rescue a dominant phenotype, such as the pha-1 mutation28.\n\t\t\nIf picking immediately prior to the assay, pick young adult males. If picking the day prior to the assay, pick L4 larval males.\nImaging the CEM responses to 1 µM ascr#3.\nPick approximately 20 L4 C. elegans males (fkEx98[ppkd-2::GCaMP::SL2::dsRED + pBX-1]; pha-1(e2123ts); him-5(e1490); lite-1(ce314)) that are positive for dsRed co-injection marker expression.\n\t\tNOTE: dsRed expression within the ray neurons of the male tale is easier to observe and confirm than GCaMP expression within the four CEM neurons.\nIsolate these males from hermaphrodites on an NGM agar plate seeded with a lawn of OP50 E. coli for 5-14 h before performing the imaging experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Males not isolated for a minimum of 5 h do not behaviorally respond to ascr#3 and therefore may exhibit even fewer calcium transients to the ascaroside than observed here.\n5. Animal Loading\nNOTE: See refefence1.\nPick one worm onto an unseeded NGM agar plate using standard worm maintenance techniques.\nPick worms by flaming a pick (made of flattened platinum wire), picking bacteria onto the pick, and \"dabbing\" a worm to pick it up. Gently place the worm onto the new plate, allowing it to crawl off on its own.",
    "Add approximately 5 mL of 1x S Basal to the unseeded plate, such that plate is flooded.\nDraw the worm into a loading syringe (i.e., 3 mL syringe with attached tubing) that has been pre-filled with 1x S Basal.\nBe sure to suck the worm only into the tubing, not all the way into the syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: If the worm travels into the syringe, it is near impossible to get it back into the tubing.\nTurn off the vacuum to stop the flow by turning the outlet Luer valve.\nRemove the solid pin blocking the worm loading port.\nTurn the Luer valve connected to the outlet port (Figure 1B) so that it is venting.\n\tNOTE: Use a live video feed while loading the worm to confirm the location and orientation of the animal (steps 5.8-5.13).\nInsert the worm loading tube into the worm loading port.\nGently apply pressure to the syringe until the worm appears in the loading channel.\nIf the worm starts to enter the channel tail-first, pull on the syringe plunger to prevent the worm from entering the channel.\nSwitch between applying and reversing pressure until the head enters the channel first.\nOpen the vacuum by turning the 3-way Luer valve connected to the outlet port to open it to vacuum instead of atmosphere.\nManually apply pressure by depressing the syringe plunger to orient and place the worm head such that it is exposed to the buffer flow channel, but not so far that the head can move around freely (Figure 2D-2E).\n6. Stimulus and Acquisition\nUsing an open-source microscopy software, such as Micro-Manager, record by capturing images as a TIFF stack at 10 frames/s using blue-light excitation (470 nm) for 30 s.\nSet the exposure on the main menu to 100 ms.",
    "Open \"Multi-D Acq.\" from the main menu of the software. Set the \"number\" to \"300,\" and the \"interval\" to \"0.\" Click \"Acquire!\" to acquire the video.\nApply a 10 s pulse of the stimulus 5 s after initiating acquisition. Adjust the duration of stimulus application as desired.\nAfter acquiring 5 s of video, change the 3-way valve controlling the flow control buffer to apply the stimulus to the animal being tested. Click the left-most button on the perfusion controller software (Figure 1B).\nAfter 10 s of stimulus exposure (this time can be adjusted as desired by the user), alter the flow of buffers by again pressing the left-most button on the perfusion controller software.\nRecord under buffer only until the 30-s window is complete to allow the GECI fluorescence to return to baseline.\nRepeat as desired. Wait 30 s between the end of acquisition and the initiation of the next trial.\n7. Image Analysis\nOpen the TIFF stack with the open-source software, ImageJ, by dragging file into the ImageJ window.\nClick using the cursor and drag to set the region of interest (ROI) around the neuron of interest. Set the region to include the soma of the neuron of interest (as in Figure 3A).\nPlot the z-stack of the fluorescence intensity of the ROI across stacks by clicking Open -> Image -> Stacks -> Plot Z-axis Profile.\nClick \"List\" in the window that opens. Click Edit -> Copy to copy the values. Paste the values into a spreadsheet program.\nAnalyze the background fluorescence for each pulse by dragging the ROI to a region of the worm that does not contain GCaMP expression.\nPerform background subtraction for each pulse by subtracting the background fluorescence value from the neuron fluorescence intensity value.\nCalculate ΔF/F0 for each frame of each pulse.",
    "Calculate F0 as the average intensity value of the ROI for first 1 s of acquisition (e.g., frames 1-10).\nCalculate ΔF/F0 by dividing the background-subtracted value for the frame of interest by the calculated F0 value.\nRepeat for every neuron imaged and every stimulus pulse.\nFor neurons with consistent response profiles, such as ASH, average all pulses for each neuron and calculate the SEM (as in Figure 2F).\nPlot the average ΔF/F0 with SEM over time for each neuron.\n\tNOTE: In this instance, it is common practice to include heatmaps of the individual neuronal responses of each trial as well. In neurons that do not exhibit consistent changes in calcium transients upon exposure to stimuli across repeated stimulations, or in different individuals23, it may be more applicable to show individual pulse traces (as in Figure 4).
