    "Experimental preparationIt is best to conduct the cylinder test during the mice’s active phase (dark cycle). Note: It is convenient to maintain all tested mice on a reverse light/dark cycle. Mark the mice’s tails using a waterproof marking pen on the day before of the experiment. This will allow quick identification of mice in the cage and avoid a high level of stress immediately before testing.Run all behavioral evaluations at the same time of the day.Place the cylinder on the center of the table or lab bench. Use a black curtain to cover all sides of the cylinder to minimize visual distraction to the mice.Note: Draw a line on the surface where the cylinder sits to ensure the cylinder can be returned to the same position. Position the top-view camera above the cylinder. The view should be close enough to acquire the entire diameter of the cylinder (Figure 2). The other two cameras must cover the side of the cylinder (side-view cameras) (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190817/20190817024038_7734.jpgFigure 2. View from the top cameraPerform the test under low light conditions. The dark environment will stimulate the exploratory instinct of mice. In our animal facility, we use a ceiling white light as the main source of illumination. This light source is controlled by a dimmer switch set to deliver 40 lux above the cylinder.Note: Ensure the lighting conditions are enough to clearly see the forelimb use around the cylinder in the video recordings. Prepare test cards to identify each animal during the video recording. However, do not indicate the experimental groups to ensure blind scores.The human experimenter conducting the behavioral assay should not be visible to the assayed mouse. Note: Leave the room while the mice are performing the experiment.  Acclimate the mice into the testing room for at least 30 min before testing.",
    "Provide the same light conditions used for the test. Allow mice to rest undisturbed.Behavioral assayStart video recording.Label a test card with animal identification and record it for 3 s. Place the mouse into the middle of the glass cylinder and start the timer (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190817/20190817024056_1382.jpgFigure 3.

At the end of the test, return the mouse immediately to its homecage. Table 1 shows representative data from one mouse.Table 1.
