    "Sterilization: sterilize all tools that will be used in this surgery by autoclaving at 121 °C, 0.12 MPa or with 75% alcohol.Fill two 50 ml centrifuge tubes with PBS and Ampicillin, respectively. Before use, warm these solutions in a 45 °C water bath.Pipette preparation: We couple a glass pipette with a 1 ml syringe for injecting a large amount of solution (Figure 1). The diameter of the pipette tip is ~50 µm. If the diameter of pipette tip is too large, amniotic fluid will overflow and this may affect the development of fetus. If the diameter of the pipette tip is too small, the pipette can be easily blocked, which increases the duration of time that the embryos are exposed (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515192926_8819.jpgFigure 1.

The tip diameter is too fine. B. The tip diameter is good. C. The tip diameter is too large.Anesthetize a pregnant mouse (E15) with 1.5% isoflurane in oxygen in an induction chamber at a respiratory rate of 60 times per minute. Note: If the age of embryos is older than E17 or younger than E14, the survival rate of mice will decrease.Remove the pregnant mouse from the induction chamber. Place the head of the mouse in a respiratory mask infused with 0.5-1% isoflurane in oxygen. Maintain a respiratory rate between 80 and 100 times per minute to ensure that the embryos do not achieve hypoxia status and that the pregnant mouse is fully anesthetized during surgery.Shave the mouse abdomen using a shaver that was sterilized with cotton ball with 75% alcohol and iodophor.Drape sterile gauze over the abdomen and make a 2 cm long slit to expose the abdominal incision.",
    "Cut a 2 cm long incision on the abdominal skin and peritoneum around the position of the womb being careful to cut from outside to inside. Be careful not to damage the capillary vessels on the peritoneum, because bleeding from damaged vessels can lead to wound infection.Hold the uterine wall with tweezers and pull out embryos that are in the uterus. Be careful not to damage vessels on the uterine wall especially those that are close to the placenta. Keep the surface of mouse embryos moist using sterilized PBS during the injection process (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515193056_8010.jpgFigure 3. Embryos before injectionWith one hand, hold the tweezers and gently lift the uterine wall. With the other hand, hold the injector to inject 0.1 ml culture medium (see Recipes) (injection speed: ~10 µl/sec) into the amniotic at the position close to the tweezers (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. The posture of intra-amniotic injection Inject the other embryos with a similar volume and injection speed. The survival rate of embryos is typically about 85%.Insert the embryos back into the abdominal cavity with tweezers after the injection.Fill the abdominal cavity with 2 ml 0.1 mg/ml warm ampicillin in PBS to prevent infection. Remove the extra solution with gauze at the surface of the abdomen.Carefully suture the peritoneum and abdominal skin from inside to outside.To ease pain, apply 1% lidocaine solution (see Recipes) to the wound on the abdominal skin. The time it takes to complete the surgery (Step 6 to Step 15) should not exceed half an hour. The embryo survival rate decreases if the surgery exceeds 30 min.Note: The specific operation of Steps 6-15 is shown in Video 2.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.",
    "Intra amniotic Injection of Mouse Embryos Move the pregnant mouse back to her home cage and kept her warm with a heating pad at 37 °C for 3-5 h until it recovers from anesthesia and can move freely.ZIKV infected mice show walking defects or paralysis. Videos of ZIKV mice exhibiting this behavior can be found here: http://www.ebiomedicine.com/article/S2352-3964(17)30184-6/addons[href=http://www.ebiomedicine.com/article/S2352-3964(17)30184-6/addons]."
