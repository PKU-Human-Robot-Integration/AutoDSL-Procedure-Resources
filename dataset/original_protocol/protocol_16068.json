    "hPSCs are prone to spontaneous differentiation and genetic instability if not handled appropriately (Ronen & Benvenisty, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0042]) and should be maintained in conditions that stably promote pluripotency. The presence of spontaneously differentiated cells in hPSC cultures is likely to interfere with efficient hypothalamic differentiation, and the presence of unwanted mutations will complicate downstream analyses. Detailed methods for hPSC culture are provided elsewhere (International Stem Cell Initiative Consortium et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0021]; Ludwig & Thomson, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0027]; Santos et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0044]).\nhPSC maintenance is summarized in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0001]. Briefly, hPSCs are maintained in the absence of antibiotics under feeder-free conditions, monitored and fed daily with complete medium changes, and gently passaged once they reach 70%-80% confluence. Cell lines should be routinely monitored for pathogens such as mycoplasma, as well as for the acquisition in culture of unwanted mutations (Amps et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0004]; Baker et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0005]; Merkle et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0031]). Also note that work with hESCs is restricted in some countries and institutions, but they can be replaced with hiPSCs for most applications. Indeed, selecting a commonly used reference hiPSC line such as KOLF2.1J can facilitate reproducibility and data sharing between groups (Pantazis et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0036]). Below, we describe conditions for hPSC maintenance with StemFlex, but other feeder-free media and supplements can be used as well. If your group prefers other media, we suggest that cells be adapted for at least 3 passages in StemFlex on a substrate of Geltrex or Matrigel before undergoing neuronal differentiation using the protocols described here.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5d58822b-cb51-4ee4-aa2e-0d27deff807e/cpz1786-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",

To coat plates for next-day use, add Geltrex solution to the wells, wrap plates in Parafilm, and store them at 4°C up to 72 hr. Before use, incubate plate with Geltrex at 37°C for ∼1 hr.\nBefore plating cells, aspirate excess Geltrex. The coated plate is ready to receive cells for plating as described in step 3h.\nAfter coating the plate, take care not to let it dry out at any time. Avoid bubbles.",
    "2. When cultures are sparse, feed them every second day with StemFlex medium by aspirating old medium and performing a complete medium change, but switch to daily feeding as soon as cultures are 40%-50% confluent, and prepare to split them as described below. Note the morphology of the cultures (Fig. 1G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0001]), which should be uniform in appearance. Cells should have a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0001]), contain prominent nucleoli, grow in colonies with well-defined borders, and maintain cell-cell contact with other hSPCs.\nDo not attempt hypothalamic differentiation if cultures were stressed by over-confluence or under-nutrition (yellowish medium) at any point in their culture history, or if there is evidence of cells with a morphology different from that of hPSCs. Eliminate unwanted differentiated cells by aspirating them at each feeding or by manually picking hPSC colonies as described elsewhere (International Stem Cell Initiative Consortium et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0021]; Ludwig & Thomson, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0027]; Santos et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0044]).\n3. When hPSCs reach 70%-80% confluence (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0001]; ∼4 days after previous split), split cells 1:10. Some cell lines may require lower or higher split ratios, and the time between splits can vary.\n         \nPreheat desired volume of 0.5 mM EDTA solution in a 37°C water bath for ∼10 min.\nWash cells gently and briefly with room temperature DPBS–.\nAdd warm EDTA solution to cultures, 1 ml per well in 6-well plate or 5 ml per 10-cm plate.",
    "Incubate with EDTA for 3-5 min at 37°C. After 3 min, check for cell detachment on a phase-contrast microscope. Cells should start to round up and take on a phase-bright appearance (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0001] and E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0001]), but not spontaneously detach from the plate. Once cultures adopt this appearance, gently suck up and expel ∼100 µl of the EDTA solution with a 1-ml (P-1000) pipet tip against the cells. They should easily dislodge and leave a small area devoid of cells. If cells do not dissociate easily, extend EDTA digestion for another minute and repeat this test.\nOnce cells can easily be detached from the plate, but before they spontaneously lift off, gently aspirate EDTA.\nTo dissociate cells, add 1 ml or 5 ml StemFlex with 10 µM Y-27632 for a well of a 6-well plate or 10-cm plate, respectively. Gently pipet this medium over the plate to detach cells, and pipet up and down several times to dissociate them to a suspension of small clumps of cells. Avoid bubbles.\nCollect cells in a 15-ml V-bottom polypropylene tube and adjust volume with StemFlex containing 10 µM Y-27632 if necessary.\nPlate the desired volume of this cell suspension to achieve a desired split ratio onto Geltrex-coated plates (see step 1) in StemFlex with 10 µM Y-27632, bringing the final volume to 2 ml per well of a 6-well plate or 10 ml per 10-cm plate. Culture cells in StemFlex with 10 µM Y-27632 for 1 day at 37°C, in a 20% O2, 5% CO2 humidified incubator, and then maintain them by feeding every second day with StemFlex medium.\n4. Depending on experimental design, expand the culture to provide sufficient cell numbers for differentiation. Cells are ready to be plated for hypothalamic differentiation when the culture reaches ∼70%-80% confluency (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-prot-0002]).",
    "A70%-80% confluent 10-cm or 15-cm plate of hPSC yields about 8 × 106 or 2 × 107 cells, respectively.\n5. To cryopreserve expanded and/or excess hPSCs, 2× freezing medium should be used for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.\n         \nWhen hPSC have reached 70%-80% confluence, dissociate cells as described above in steps 3a-3g.\nCentrifuge collected cells in a 15-ml V-bottom polypropylene tube for 3-5 min at 160 × g, room temperature.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet, adjust to desired volume (at least 1 × 106 cells/ml and up to 1 × 107 cells/ml).\nMix 0.5 ml of cell suspension with 0.5 ml of 2× freezing medium in a cryovial with a screw-top cap.\nPlace cryovials in an isopropanol cell-freezing container at room temperature, and transfer this container to −80°C overnight.\nThe following day, transfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.",
    "The efficient generation of human hypothalamic neurons from hPSCs is based on developmental principles. The signaling pathways that lead to neuralization, forebrain specification, and ventralization are manipulated by small-molecule drugs. Specifically, the Wingless-related integration site (WNT), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are inhibited with XAV939, LDN-193189, and SB431542, respectively, which is followed by activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway with purmorphamine and Smoothed agonist (SAG). Later addition of the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT promotes neurogenesis by inhibiting NOTCH signaling (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0002]; Merkle et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0032]; Wang et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0057]).

    "Differentiation of hPSCs to hypothalamic neurons. (A) Schematic of hypothalamic differentiation protocol. (B,B′) Dissociated hPSCs that were plated at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells per cm2 on Day –1 should be at ∼75% on Day 0. Differentiation medium (N2B27) with SMAD inhibitors (10 µM SB431542, 100 nM LDN193189) and a Wnt inhibitor (2 µM XAV939) is then added to induce a forebrain fate. (C,C′) Cultures should reach confluence and adopt a uniform appearance by Day 1. (D,D′) By Day 4, cell density is dramatically increased, but cells are still largely a single adherent layer. The concentrations of the SMAD inhibitors and Wnt inhibitors are progressively reduced over the course of differentiation, as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-prot-0002], and cultures are ventralized from Day 2 to Day 8 by adding 1 µM Smoothened agonist (SAG) and 1 µM purmorphamine (Pur). (E,E′) By Day 8, cultures adopt a clear neuroepithelial morphology, as evidenced by the formation of neural-ridge-like structures (arrows). At this time point, 5 µM of the NOTCH inhibitor DAPT is added until Day 14 to encourage neurogenesis. (F,F′) On Day 14, cultures are re-plated, at which point it is prudent to plate a fraction of the differentiated cells into a 24-well plate for quality control. After Day 14, cells are maintained in maturation medium. (G,G′) After passaging, most cells have a neuronal morphology. (H,H′) By Day 30, cultures contain a high percentage of cells with neuronal morphology but may also have some cell-dense regions. It is advisable to re-plate cultures again at this point to purify cell types of interest and decrease cell density so as to ensure that neurons receive adequate nutrients.

    "This protocol is designed for adherent differentiation in monolayers. Typically, more than 1 × 108 neurons are generated per 10-cm plate of hPSCs, providing large numbers of human hypothalamic neurons for functional studies, disease modeling, cellular transplantation, or drug screening.

    "The aim of this protocol is to facilitate the maturation of neurons to the point that they are spontaneously electrically active and respond to exogenous factors, such as hormones, drugs, and metabolites that their counterparts in the brain might also respond to. To promote maturation and induction of target genes such as POMC, cultures are re-plated at 3 × 105 cells per cm2, and 10 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is added to an enhanced maturation medium, Synaptojuice or SJ (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0008]; Telezhkin et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0050]). Hypothalamic neurons begin to acquire functional properties after 30 days of culture and mature further over subsequent weeks in culture. Plating dissociated human neurons on a monolayer of glia (3 × 104 cells per cm2) harvested from the newborn mouse or rat brain or derived from hPSCs may accelerate functional maturation and may be particularly valuable for experiments in which neurons are plated at low densities or are to be used for electrophysiological recording (Ullian et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0054]; Zuchero & Barres, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0063]).

After 3 min of incubation, check to see if cells are detaching. Under a phase-contrast microscope, the cells should start to round up and take on a phase-bright appearance, but not spontaneously detach from the plate. Once cultures adopt this appearance, gently suck up and dispel ∼100 µl of the TrypLE solution with a 1-ml (P-1000) pipet tip against the cells. They should easily dislodge and leave a small area devoid of cells. If cells do not dissociate easily, extend TrypLE digestion for another minute and repeat this test.",
    "Take care to avoid over-digestion, which can cause cell death and release of genomic DNA. It is also crucial that cells do not spontaneously detach in TrypLE, or excessive cell death will occur.\nGently aspirate TrypLE, leaving the digested cells still lightly stuck onto the plate.\nTo dissociate cells, add 1 ml trituration medium per well of a 6-well plate with a P1000 gently pipet this medium over the plate to detach cells and dissociate them to a single-cell suspension. Cells should detach easily, requiring only a few passes with the P1000. For a 10-cm plate, use 5 ml of trituration medium with a 5- or 10-ml stripette\nCollect cells in a 15-ml V-bottom polypropylene tube and adjust volume to 10 ml with trituration medium.\nCentrifuge cells 3-5 min at 160 × g, room temperature. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml trituration medium.\nAfter resuspending the cell pellet, adjust volume so that the suspension is visibly turbid, but not milky (∼1-5 million cells/ml).\nIn two separate polypropylene tubes, mix 10 µl of this cell suspension with 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue, transfer 10 µl of that mixture onto cell counting slide, and count cells with automated cell counter. Ensure that the two counts are similar and then take the average of them to calculate cell number.\nTo achieve accurate counts, ensure that the cell suspension has just been gently but thoroughly agitated prior to taking an aliquot for counting.\nCentrifuge cells 3-5 min at 160 × g, room temperature. Aspirate supernatant, and then resuspend cells in a desired volume of maturation medium with 10 µM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) to enable plating at the desired density as described below, or cryopreservation as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-prot-0005].",
    "3. Plate cells onto Geltrex-coated plates in maturation medium with 10 µM Y-27632 at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells per cm2 (corresponding to 1.05 × 106 cells per well of a 12-well plate and 2.88 × 106 cells per well of a 6-well plate).\nThis usually corresponds to 1:3 passage ratio, but exact figures can vary.\n4. Maintain cultures as follows:\n         \nOn the day after plating (Day 15), aspirate medium to remove Y-27632 and gently feed with a standard volume of maturation medium (e.g., 2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).\nOn Day 16, aspirate medium and add twice the normal volume of SJ1 for neuronal maintenance (e.g., 4 ml per well of a 6-well plate).\nThis larger volume helps ensure that neurons are exposed to a relatively constant supply of nutrients.\nChange 75% of medium volume (e.g., for 4 ml of medium in a 6-well plate, replace 3 ml) every second day for 3 feedings (1 week total time in SJ1). Add BDNF fresh at each feeding.\nAfter 1 week in SJ1, aspirate medium and add SJ2. As described above, change 75% of medium volume every second day and add BDNF fresh at each feeding.\nOptional: Laminin (final concentration: 1 μg/ml; Merck, cat. no. L2020) may added as a supplement to provide better cell attachment during the maturation period.",
    "5. If desired, neurons can be re-plated again at later time points to move them onto different plates for imaging or analysis. To do so, repeat the dissociation procedure outlined in steps 2 and 3 with the following exceptions: (1) resuspend 1 vial of papain per 10 ml of TrypLE at step 2b to aid in neuronal dissociation and ensure significantly higher survival upon re-plating, and (2) when re-plating cells, use SJ2 medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 rather than maturation medium and maintain the cells in SJ2 using the feeding schedule, volume, and supplements as described in step 4.\nDepending on experiments and if long-term culture is desired, consider culturing cells at lower density (2 × 104 cell per cm2) on a monolayer of astrocytes plated on Geltrex-coated or poly-d-lysine-coated plastic. Non-neuronal cells may continue to proliferate, which can lead to culture overgrowth. Although cultures can be maintained for long periods of time, many experiments can be executed between Day 30 and Day 80. If non-adherent (e.g., organoid or assembloid) cultures are desired, dissociated cells can be encouraged to generate these in low-attachment round-bottom plates either at either the first passaging (D14) or later passaging steps.",
    "Upon differentiation, neuronal progenitors can be cryopreserved for later thawing and maturation. Freezing progenitors has several advantages. First, it reduces the time at which more mature neurons can be generated for functional experiments because it cuts out the time required to thaw, expand, and passage the hPSC line (∼1 week) and the time needed for differentiation (2 weeks). Second, it allows users to generate a large number of frozen vials of progenitors from a single differentiation in order to ensure more consistent results from experiment to experiment once progenitors are thawed and matured into neurons. Cryopreservation is performed once progenitors have been patterned to a specific spatial identity, but before they have given rise to neurons that are sensitive to freezing and thawing. Although there is some loss of viability upon thawing, cultures generated from cryopreserved vials have a similar composition to those generated by direct replating.\nMaterials\n2× freezing medium\nMaturation medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-rec-0014])\nY-27632 dihydrochloride (ROCK inhibitor; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-rec-0027])\nSterile screw-top 2-ml cryovials\nLabel printers and cryo labels\nMr. Frosty or other freezing container capable of cooling cells at a rate of −1°C per min\n1.

The resulting suspension of progenitors in maturation medium with 10 µM Y-27632 is then cryopreserved as follows:",
    "Slowly but steadily over the course of 60 s under steady mixing (by pipetting a fraction of the volume at a time and/or swirling if the volume of the tube allows), add an equal volume of ice-cold 2× freezing medium to the cell suspension.\nWorking quickly to minimize the amount of time cells are exposed to DMSO, pipet 1 ml of the cell suspension into each cryovial, and rapidly cap the vials, taking care to keep the lids sterile.\nImmediately transfer cryovials to a room-temperature Mr. Frosty or similar device to ensure even freezing, and then immediately move this device to a −80°C freezer to freeze overnight.\nThe next day, transfer frozen vials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n3.

Hypothalamic patterning can be gauged by the expression of regionally expressed transcription factors (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0003] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0003]), and hypothalamic neurogenesis can be confirmed by testing for neuropeptides that are highly enriched in the hypothalamus (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0003], D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0003], and F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0003]; Tables 3–5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-tbl-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b22f04fd-1e36-48d5-b0fd-7783a846feeb/cpz1786-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nQuality control of hPSC hypothalamic differentiations by immunocytochemistry.

    "Fura-2 AM is a ratiometric indicator that fluoresces more brightly at 340 nm and more weakly at 380 nm in the presence of calcium, enabling the 340 nm/380 nm fluorescence intensity ratio of Fura-2AM to indicate changes in intracellular calcium levels (Takahashi et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0049]). Using this ratio, rather than absolute fluorescence intensity, minimizes the effects of photobleaching and other technical artifacts such as uneven dye loading into cells. In cultures ∼30 days old, calcium imaging can be used to investigate how the hPSC-derived neurons respond to stimuli. Neurons older than Day 50 tend to be more active and are better suited to studying synaptic activity (Kirwan et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0023]; Prè et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0038]; Shi et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0045]).\nNOTE: For the fluorescence imaging system, a number of systems can be used, and the configuration below serves as a guide. Many users will prefer an inverted microscope setting, although an upright configuration that facilitates electrophysiological recording is also possible. Importantly, the illumination and filters chosen need to be suitable for the intended fluorophores, the objective needs to be of sufficient magnification and numerical aperture (NA) to efficiently collect emitted photons, and the camera should be fast and sensitive enough to detect these photons.

    "If the goal of the experiment is to record intrinsic calcium responses from individual neurons, it is recommended that the neuron under investigation be pharmacologically uncoupled from the neuronal network by adding synaptic blockers on the extracellular recording solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-rec-0011]). If studying synaptic activity, it is recommended that cells be recorded at 37°C in a synaptic-blocker-free extracellular bath solution. To maintain the cells at 37°C for the entire length of the experiments, use a heated bath chamber (e.g., PTC Mini Chamber III, Luigs & Neumann) connected to a temperature controller (e.g., Temperature controller TC07, Luigs & Neumann is recommended).\nIf perfusion is required, prepare perfusion system during the final incubation after loading the cells with Fura-2AM. Set it up so that perfusion flows at a rate of ∼3 ml/min. Turn on heating if required.\nTransfer cells to imaging system and begin perfusion with recording solution. Allow 10 min for perfusion and temperature to stabilize.\nCheck for fluorescence under UV illumination.\nNavigate to a field where the cell density allows clear resolution of single cells and that also enables the measurement of background intensity (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0004])\nUse software to set up acquisition at 340-, 360-, and 380-nm excitation, and detection of emitted light at 515 nm.\nThe 360-nm channel is used to determine the extent to which photobleaching is occurring. This is done by comparing the first and last image in the 360-nm channel from the dataset and checking whether fluorescence intensity was lost during the experiment.\nFocus the cells and adjust the gain and exposure settings so that the signal is not saturated. We recommend exposures of 50-200 ms to minimize bleaching.\nUse the imaging software to highlight cell bodies of interest and a background area. Use the background area to perform a background signal subtraction.",
    "Observations of neuronal activity and background subtraction can also be performed post-acquisition by exporting the acquired image sets using commercial software or custom scripts (e.g., MATLAB, RRID, SCR_001622).\nAcquire time-lapse recordings at 1-10 Hz depending on the experiment.\nGenerally, activity that produces subtle, fast changes in calcium influx should be recorded at 10 Hz, whereas activities that produce large, robust calcium influxes can be recorded at 1 Hz. The length of recording will depend on the application, i.e., drug perfusions, number of treatments, and latency of response, but is typically 30-50 min.\nNear the end of each recording, perfuse cultures with recording solution containing 30 mM KCl. This will depolarize the cells and act as a benchmark for the electrical maturity and general health of the cells. An example recording is shown in Figure 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-fig-0004].",
    "Rhod-3 AM is a calcium dye with excitation and emission peaks of 560 and 600 nm, respectively. Like other red-shifted calcium dyes, Rhod-3 AM displays low basal autofluorescence and reduced phototoxicity and is compatible with the simultaneous detection of green fluorescent proteins or other green dyes. Below we describe a protocol to monitor calcium responses from hPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons that have been labeled with a green fluorescent reporter by exploiting the multiplexing property of Rhod-3 AM.\nNOTE: For the fluorescence imaging system, a number of options are available to the user, and the configuration below serves as a guide. Most importantly, the illumination and filters need to be suitable for the intended fluorophores, the objective needs to be of sufficient magnification and numerical aperture (NA) to efficiently collect emitted photons, and the camera should be fast and sensitive enough to detect these photons. Software to control shutters and collect movies that can then be analyzed in R or similar analysis software is also key.\nCAUTION: If using synaptic blockers, handle each of these toxins with great care and appropriate personal protective equipment and only after carefully familiarizing yourself with the potential risks by reading the Material Safety Data Sheets and discussing their use with your local safety officer.\nMaterials\nhPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons, Day 30+ (preferably Day 40-60; see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-prot-0004]), optionally generated from a cell line with a green fluorescent reporter for a cell type of interest\n35-mm Ibidi dishes (Thistle Scientific, cat. no. 80136), coated with Geltrex (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-prot-0001]m step 1)\nBrainPhysTM medium (Bardy et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0006]; STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 05790)\nRecording solution: HBSS supplemented with synaptic blockers or BrainPhysTM Imaging optimized neuronal medium (Zabolocki et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.786#cpz1786-bib-0060]; STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 05796; other media, such as ACSF or BPI, can be substituted if desired)",
