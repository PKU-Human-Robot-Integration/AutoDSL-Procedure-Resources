    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDifferentiation of kidney organoids\nThe following protocol is modified from work previously published by Freedman et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and Pietrobon et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] In this protocol, hPSCs are cultured to high confluence, dissociated, and seeded into a 3D Matrigel culture, resulting in the spontaneous formation of 3D epiblast-like spheroids. Treatment with initiation medium containing GSK3β inhibitor results in differentiation of these spheroids into organized nephron-like structures containing clusters of cells with podocyte, proximal tubule, and distal tubule features.\nTiming: 4 to 6 weeks (for mature organoids)\nPluripotent stem cell culture\nTiming: 1 to 3 weeks (for steps 1 to 4)\nThese steps describe the culture and maintenance of hPSCs. We additionally detail cleaning steps used to remove spontaneously differentiated and overgrown hPSC colonies to achieve minimally differentiated hPSC colonies which are ideal for kidney organoid production.\nNote: All reagents and vessels for tissue culture must be kept sterile. Work should be performed in a Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC). All surfaces should be disinfected with 70% ethanol before commencing work. All objects should be wiped down with 70% ethanol before being placed in or removed from the BSC.\nNote: See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for tissue culture vessel well volumes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2711_11.csv\nPrepare Matrigel-coated plates for hPSC culture.\nThaw Matrigel according to manufacturer’s instructions and dilute to 0.02 mg/mL using cold (4°C) DMEM/F12.\nNote: This protocol is optimized using Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced. Refer to key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nCritical: Ensure that Matrigel solution is well-mixed. Do not allow Matrigel solution to warm to room temperature or it will prematurely polymerize. Store Matrigel solution on ice if it will not be used immediately.\nDispense half-well volume of Matrigel solution per well.\nNote: Matrigel-coated plates may be sealed with parafilm and stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks.",
    "Incubate Matrigel-coated plates at room temperature for a minimum of 1 h before use.\nThaw and seed hPSCs.\nPrepare growth medium (refer to key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] sections for detailed recipe).\nWarm growth medium in 37°C water bath.\nRemove vial of hPSCs from cryogenic storage.\nRapidly thaw hPSCs by swirling the vial gently in a 37°C water bath. Remove vial from water once only a small pellet of ice remains.\nUsing a wide-bore P1000, transfer contents of vial to 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL growth medium.\nCritical: A wide-bore pipette tip should be used any time hPSC colonies are being pipetted. Excess cell death may occur when using a standard pipette tip due to shear stress.\nPellet hPSCs by centrifugation, 5 min at 250 g. Aspirate supernatant.\nAspirate Matrigel solution from culture vessel and replace with 1x well volume of warmed growth medium.\nResuspend hPSCs in 1 mL growth medium and dispense into Matrigel-coated well.\nTransfer plate to hypoxic incubator set to 37°C, 5% O2, 10% CO2.\nRefresh growth medium every 48 h.\nNote: hPSCs should be inspected for differentiation before refreshing growth medium. Make note of areas of the plate containing healthy hPSC colonies and refer to step 3 for removal of differentiated cells if spontaneous differentiation is moderate or higher. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nCritical: hPSC colonies should not be cleaned excessively. hPSCs should be cleaned only when there is excessive differentiation. Avoid performing the following step more than once per medium change (48 h) if possible.\nRemove differentiated cells by washing if required. Refer to Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for this step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Typical timeline for removal of spontaneously differentiated cells from hPSC maintenance cultures\nScale bars = 500 μm.",
    "(A) Cell dissociation buffer (EDTA) was added to hPSC colonies with moderate differentiation at 0 min. Regions of differentiated cells were sprayed repeatedly using a pipette to remove cells as shown at 2 min. Cell dissociation buffer was replaced with PBS and additional washing was performed until most of the differentiated cells had been washed away at 4 min. The remaining colonies were rinsed gently with fresh PBS to remove non-adherent cells before growth medium was added and the cells were returned to an incubator at 6 min. Lifted edges of hPSC colonies had reattached to the plate at 10 min. Some differentiated cells remain adherent and may be removed during subsequent washes or during passaging.\n(B) Removal of overgrown areas from hPSC colony. Cell dissociation buffer was added at 0 min. Overgrown areas were removed by spraying repeatedly with a pipette tip. Cell dissociation buffer was replaced with PBS after 3 min, and washing was continued until overgrown areas were removed.\n(C) Typical appearance of hPSC colonies in a 6-well plate as seen by naked eye. Red circles (left panel) indicate regions containing overgrown colonies which should be sprayed with dissociation buffer.\n(D) 1) Overgrown colonies are visible as raised bumps when the plate is tiled (red arrowheads). 2) Colonies are washed using dissociation buffer to remove overgrown areas (yellow arrowheads). 3) Colonies appear flattened after removal of overgrown areas. 4) Loosely adherent cells can be removed by running dissociation buffer down the side of each well.\nInspect hPSCs under a microscope.\nInspect the colonies for overgrown regions.",
    "Note: Overgrown regions typically occur at the centers of hPSC colonies. These regions appear to the naked eye as opaque white foci (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Any colonies containing overgrown areas should be washed, as these areas may contribute to spontaneous differentiation of the hPSCs.\nIdentify areas containing moderately or highly spontaneously differentiated hPSC colonies. Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nNote: Differentiated cells typically appear around the edges of colonies and may require magnification to identify. hPSC colonies with low levels of spontaneous differentiation and that are not overgrown do not need to be washed.\nAspirate growth medium and replace with half-well volume of cell dissociation buffer (refer to key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] sections for detailed recipe).\nImmediately use a pipette to spray the areas containing overgrown and differentiated hPSC colonies with cell dissociation buffer 2 to 3x.\nDirect spray at overgrown regions of hPSC colonies to wash away cells.\nNote: Spray gently at first and increase force if overgrown areas do not detach. Avoid spraying colonies so forcefully that the entire colony washes away.\nInspect hPSCs under microscope.\nIf hPSCs have been sufficiently cleaned, proceed to step 3e.\nIf overgrown or excessively differentiated cells are detaching but still adherent, repeat step 3c.\nIf overgrown or excessively differentiated cells remain strongly adherent, incubate at room temperature for 30s and inspect again.\nNote: Sufficiently detached cells will begin to pull away from neighboring cells. Refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nCritical: Incubation with cell dissociation buffer for longer than 5 min may cause excessive detachment of undifferentiated hPSCs. Avoid excessive washing of areas containing undifferentiated hPSC colonies.",
    "Critical: Although longer (> 3 min) incubation times may be required to remove differentiated cells, do not proceed to passaging (step 4) if hPSCs were incubated with cell dissociation buffer for longer than 3 min or the colonies may break up excessively. If hPSCs must be passaged after washing, replace cell dissociation buffer with growth medium and return the cells to an incubator for at least an h before passaging.\nAspirate cell dissociation buffer and rinse gently with PBS to remove loose cells.\nReplace with 1x well volume of growth medium and return cells to hypoxic incubator.\nPassage hPSC colonies.\nNote: Prepare Matrigel-coated plates as described in step 1 before proceeding.\nReplace growth medium with half-well volume of cell dissociation buffer.\nPerform wash steps as described in step 3 if necessary.\nThis step removes differentiated and overgrown areas of hPSC colonies\nNote: Washing may be omitted if hPSCs are minimally differentiated.\nCritical: Incubate hPSCs with cell dissociation buffer for a maximum of 3 min.\nReplace cell dissociation buffer with half-well volume of growth medium.\nUse cell scraper to gently lift hPSC colonies.\nTransfer hPSC colonies to a 15 mL conical tube containing 2 mL growth medium.\nCritical: Avoid breaking up hPSC colonies. Scrape hPSCs gently and transfer using wide-bore P1000.\nPellet large hPSC aggregates by centrifugation, 250 g for 10–20 S.\nNote: Single cells and small aggregates should remain in suspension.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend hPSCs in 1 mL growth medium.\nCritical: Do not mix excessively to avoid breaking up hPSC colonies. Refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for typical size and appearance of hPSC colony fragments following passaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. hPSCs viewed immediately following passaging (passaged colony fragments are visible)\nScale bar = 500 μm.\nSeed hPSC colonies into plates at a split ratio of 1:10 to 1:20.",
    "Note: Cells should reach 70–80% confluence in 3–4 days. Adjust split ratio accordingly to achieve this.\nPause point: hPSCs may be maintained in culture for weeks until ready to proceed to kidney organoid differentiation as long as they are cleaned and passaged regularly to avoid spontaneous differentiation. hPSCs may also be cryopreserved and recovered when needed.\nPrime hPSCs for differentiation\nTiming: 3 days to 1 week (for steps 5 to 7)\nThese steps describe how hPSCs are cultured to high confluence with minimal spontaneous differentiation to prepare for kidney organoid differentiation.\nPassage hPSCs at a split ratio to achieve 70–80% confluence in 3–4 days. troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Washing steps may be omitted if colonies are minimally differentiated.\nCritical: If cells were previously cultured with antibiotics, replace medium with antibiotic-free growth medium from this point on.\nTransfer plate to normoxic incubator, 5% CO2, 21% O2.\nInspect cells for differentiation, washing as required, and refresh growth medium every 48 h.\nMaintain hPSCs until >70% confluence is reached.\nCritical: hPSCs must be at least 70% confluent and be minimally differentiated before proceeding to differentiation. Repeat splitting protocol if excessive differentiation is present.

Refer to key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] sections for detailed recipe.\nNote: ROCKi medium is growth medium supplemented with 10 nM Y27632 ROCK inhibitor to permit survival of dissociated hPSCs during cell seeding. Once initiated, organoids will be maintained in ABG medium until maturity.\nFor each well containing hPSCs to be differentiated, replace growth medium with half-well volume of ROCKi medium and return to normoxic incubator.\nNote: hPSCs should be incubated with ROCKi medium for a minimum of 2 h.\nPrepare Matrigel-coated organoid vessels.\nDilute Matrigel to 0.5 mg/mL using cold DMEM/F12.\nDispense half-well volume of Matrigel solution per well.\nCritical: Matrigel solution must be kept cold while working. Ensure that Matrigel solution is well-mixed.\nNote: Matrigel-coated plates may be sealed with parafilm and stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks.\nNote: Differentiation can be performed in a range of vessel sizes, however smaller vessels, such as 96-well plates, are typically most efficient and allow for optimization of a large number of conditions.\nIncubate at room temperature for a minimum of 1h before use.\nDissociate hPSCs.\nCritical: hPSCs must be minimally differentiated before proceeding.\nGently wash away overgrown areas of hPSC colonies, if necessary, by spraying with the ROCKi medium in each well.\nAspirate wells and gently rinse with PBS to remove loose cells.\nAspirate wells, add half-well volume of Accutase to each well and return cells to normoxic incubator for 10 min.\nTap side of plate and inspect cells. Return cells to incubator for an additional 5 min if colonies are not completely dissociated into single cells.\nTransfer dissociated hPSCs to 15 mL conical tube.\nRinse wells with ROCKi medium and add to tube.\nNote: Rinse with 2 mL ROCKi medium for each 1 mL Accutase.",

Typical seeding densities range from 1000 to 3 × 104 cells/cm2. We recommend testing at 1500, 3000, 4500, 6000, 1 × 104, 1.5 × 104, 2 × 104, and 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 to find the ideal seeding density for your hPSC line of interest. We typically seed H9 embryonic stem cells at 4500 to 5000 cells/cm2, and D168 induced pluripotent stem cells at 14,000 to 19,000 cells/cm2.\nRock plate gently to disperse cells and return plate to normoxic incubator overnight (12–24 h).\nNote: Cells should be well adherent before proceeding.\nDay 2: Overlay cells with Matrigel\nTiming: 0.5 to 1 h (for step 13)\nThis step describes overlaying of the hPSC monolayer generated in the previous step with Matrigel in order to produce epiblast-like spheroids.\nOverlay cells with Matrigel.\nDilute Matrigel to 0.25 mg/mL with cold growth medium.\nCritical: Matrigel must be diluted with cold growth medium to prevent premature polymerization.\nAspirate medium from organoid plate and replace with 1x well volume cold Matrigel solution.\nNote: Do not warm Matrigel solution. Matrigel solution is added to cells while cold.\nReturn plates to incubator until day 4.\nNote: It is not necessary to replace the Matrigel/growth medium solution the next day if it is not depleted, as indicated by a change in color to yellow or orange. Replace with fresh growth medium only if necessary.\nDay 4: Initiate differentiation",
    "Timing: 0.5 to 1 h (for step 14)\nThis step describes treatment of the epiblast-like spheroids produced in the previous step with a GSK3β inhibitor to initiate their differentiation into kidney organoids.\nNote: Cells should start to form epiblast-like spheroids following incubation.

CHIR-99021 concentration should be optimized for each cell line. We recommend attempting differentiation using concentrations from 8 to 24 μM to find the optimal conditions for your hPSC line of interest. We typically differentiate H9 embryonic stem cells using 8–12 μM, and D168 induced pluripotent stem cells at 20–24 μM CHIR-99021.\nAspirate Matrigel solution from organoid plate and replace with 2x well volume initiation medium.\nReturn cells to incubator for 36–42 h. troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDay 6–21: Maintenance of kidney organoids\nTiming: 0.5 to 1 h (for steps 15 to 18)\nThese steps describe the timing requirements for removal of the initiation medium used in the previous steps and describes how the differentiating kidney organoids should be maintained.\nCritical: This step must be performed 36–42 h after addition of initiation medium.\nNote: Different incubation lengths with initiation medium will affect the optimal cell density and CHIR-99021 concentration. Maintain a consistent incubation length whenever possible.",
    "Aspirate initiation medium and replace with 2x well volume ABG medium, then return plates to incubator.\nAspirate all ABG medium from the wells after 48 h and refresh with 1x well volume ABG medium.\nRefresh with 1x well volume ABG medium every 48–72 h.\nNote: If differentiating cells in a vessel larger than a 96-well plate, it is recommended to perform half-medium changes. Differentiation efficiency may be reduced if full-medium changes are performed.\nNote: Daily medium changes may be required for high seeding densities.\nTubular structures should become visible between days 12 and 18.

This method adds a barcoding step to cells while in culture, allowing pooling of multiple samples on the same sequencing run. This methodology also reduces batch technical variation between samples and provides additional quality control processing tools such as true doublet identification. A particularly powerful approach is to analyze samples at multiple different time points.\nTotal time: 1–2 h for sample prep, 1 + h for analysis.",
    "Note: The following protocol is designed to label 0.5 × 106 live cells for each sample. Thus, we recommend differentiation of organoids in a large enough vessel to ensure a sufficient number of cells. Typically, a well area of 3.8 cm2, or one well of a 12-well plate, is sufficient for each sample. Organoids from multiple smaller wells may be pooled if differentiation is more efficient in other vessel sizes.\nCritical: MULTI-seq requires samples to all be processed at the same time, this requires staggered start times of the differentiation protocol so that all desired time points are completed at once.\nMULTI-seq sample preparation\nTiming: 1 to 2 h (for steps 19 to 24)\nThese steps describe tagging of cells from dissociated kidney organoids using lipid-modified oligonucleotide (LMO) anchors and unique barcoding oligonucleotides as required for MULTI-seq.\nNote: Grow organoids to the desired time points before proceeding (Steps 1 to 18). Kidney organoids should be healthy and high quality before beginning.

Example of threshold setting on quality control metrics of scRNA-seq data",
    "Smooth density estimates of cell frequency for (A) number of unique molecular identifiers (nUMI), (B) number of unique genes with detectable reads (nGene), and (C) percentage of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes (PercMito). Thresholds are chosen by visual assessment of the skew of the distribution, with a general tendency towards more permissive thresholds. Cells below the nUMI and nGene thresholds (shaded in yellow) possess too few reads (for nUMI) or uniquely detectable genes (for nGene) to be meaningfully analyzed, and thus, are removed from downstream analysis. Cells above the PercMito threshold (shaded in yellow) are likely apoptotic and are also removed from downstream analysis.\nNote: In general, we encourage less stringent thresholds to avoid discarding cells that may possess altered quality control metrics due to a biologically significant cause. For example, cells with a vastly higher number of fractional mitochondrial reads are more likely to be apoptotic cells and can be discarded. However, some metabolically active cell populations, (e.g., hPSCs), contain a slightly higher proportion of mitochondrial transcripts compared to less metabolically active cells (e.g., differentiated cell types). Thus, do not use an overly stringent threshold for discarding cells based on fractional mitochondrial reads.\nRemove any cells that were labeled “doublets” or “negatives” by the MULTI-seq analysis pipeline performed in step 26.\nNormalize expression using the SCTransform function in Seurat.\nInclude a regression variable for the difference in cell cycle score between proliferating and non-proliferating cells.\nNote: This cell cycle score, which predicts the cycle phase of each cell (G1, G2/M, S), may be determined using the CellCycleScoring function in Seurat.\nPerform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and generate a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).\nRun the RunPCA function in Seurat.",
    "Run the RunUMAP function on the 40 most variable PCA dimensions to create a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).\nCritical: This processing generates the reduced dimensionality data which can be employed for clustering and annotation. If you intend to subset your data (e.g., to focus on specific populations), we recommend you recalculate the PCA and UMAP for the selected cells for better cluster-specific visualization.\nCell clustering and annotation\nCluster cells in Seurat.\nUse the FindNeighbors function with the top 40 PCA dimensions.\nThen use the FindClusters function at a specific resolution parameter.\nCritical: The number and size of clusters generated is heavily dependent on the value of the resolution parameter (high values means more clusters with fewer cells in each). In general, there is no universal parameter that can be used and the choice highly depends on the structure of the particular dataset. We recommend empirically testing a variety of resolution parameters and assessing fit based on a priori knowledge of the expected data set. Generally, we begin by selecting a more granular resolution (i.e., more clusters), and then merge clusters that are not distinguished by any biologically recognizable suite of unique markers genes. After clustering at a more granular resolution, we also recommend aggregating clusters into more global groups for analysis. Analyzing your data at two resolutions facilitates inference of biological insights of specific subpopulations, as well as those common to larger groups of cells.\nNote: Refer to Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] for examples of granular and merged clustering based on our published data.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

In contrast, aggregated clusters allow inferences of global population changes (e.g., TSC1−/− and TSC2−/− organoids favor stromal cell fate acquisition, as reported in Pietrobon et al. 20221[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nDetermine uniquely and highly expressed genes in each cluster.\nRun the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat.\nVisualize the top marker genes in each cluster (generally ranked by p-value) and annotate in one of two ways:\nBased on a priori biological knowledge.\nBased on comparison to markers from other reported studies.\nNote: We used published datasets5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] to annotate kidney organoid clusters. Refer to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for genes that are highly or uniquely expressed in each scRNA-seq cluster which we used to annotate kidney organoid clusters.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2711_12.csv\nNote: There are more advanced methods for annotating datasets that use previously annotated reference scRNA-seq dataset in a statistically rigorous fashion. However, at this time, there are no gold standard scRNA-seq datasets that exist for renal organoids. Furthermore, results are likely to be variable depending on the differentiation protocol used and timing of extraction.\nTrajectory analysis\nInfer cell differentiation trajectory using the learn_graph function in monocle3.\nAssign a pseudotime value to each cell by using the order_cells function in monocle3 and select the root node (generally the earliest differentiation timepoint).\nPerform trajectory analysis with the tradeSeq package.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nExtract the expression and pseudotime values for each cell.\nDetermine the optimal number of knots empirically using the evaluateK function.",
    "Critical: The optimal number of knots is dataset-dependent. In general, the number of knots selected should reach an optimal bias-variance trade-off, where one explains as much variability in the expression data as possible with only a few regression coefficients. Through evaluateK, the average Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is calculated across a subset of genes at a range of knots. We recommend choosing the smallest number of knots that reasonably minimizes the average AIC. In general, the optimal number of knots is at the “knee” of the AIC vs number of knots plot.\nNote: Refer to Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] for examples of knot selection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Examples of knot selection after using the evaluateK function in the tradeSeq package\nPlots are simulated data of average Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) plotted against the number of knots used in the negative binomial generalized additive models fit to each gene. Red arrows indicate the optimal number of knots to use for analysis of each particular dataset.\nFit a Generalized Additive Model using the fitGAM function using the number of knots determined in Step 37b.\nUse the associationTest function to find genes that vary significantly along the expression trajectory.\nAdditional scRNA-seq analyses\nTiming: 2 to 6 months (for steps 38 to 41)\nDifferential gene expression can be performed between specific groups using the FindMarkers function in Seurat.\nPhylogenetic analyses can be conducted using the BuildClusterTree in Seurat.\nGO term enrichment can be performed using the clusterProfiler package.\nCompositional analysis can be performed using the imbalance_score function from the bioc2020trajectories package.\nOptional: Development of genome engineered clonal hPSC lines using CRISPR/Cas9.",
    "Our genome engineering strategy involves the use the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertion of a knockout template (i.e., single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide, ssODN) via homology-directed repair (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). The knockout template contains stop codons in all three reading frames and a PmeI restriction site which can be harnessed for clone screening, as described below. Although homology-directed repair is a less efficient process compared to non-homologous end joining, we prefer this strategy over non-homologous end joining as it guarantees the generation of a specific sequence which can be reproduced in multiple parental cell lines, thereby ensuring line-specific differences are not secondary to the mutation introduced. We have previously used this approach to generate the same TSC1-null and TSC2-null mutations across four different parental hPSC lines, enabling the direct comparison of the effects of these mutations across multiple genotypes.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] A similar homology-directed repair approach may also be used to generate isogenic controls for patient-derived samples by correcting disease-causing mutations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Overview of the genome engineering strategy used to generate TSC1-null hPSC cell lines\n(A) The CRISPR-CAS9 complex and ssDNA repair template are delivered into hPSCs via transfection. The transfected hPSCs are then cultured to form colonies, which are selected and screened for the gene edit.\n(B) A double-stranded DNA break is introduced into the first exon shared across all TSC1 splice variants by CRISPR-CAS9. An ssDNA repair template, critically containing stop codons in all reading frames along with a PmeI cut site, is used for homology directed repair of the DNA break. This results in the knockout of the target gene and insertion of a PmeI cut site, used for subsequent screening in successfully edited cells.",
    "There are numerous tools and protocols available for designing and cloning CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids. We used the lentiCRISPRv2 system12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] so that the same backbone can be potentially used for screening. We recommend designing multiple plasmids with different guide strands, testing all guides, and selecting the guide with the highest cutting efficiency. For repair template design, we used a sequence previously reported by Gagnon et al.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] which can be directly ordered from any synthesis company. We describe the below the process of using these tools for genome engineering hPSCs, which is quite different from editing an immortalized cell line.\nPrime hPSC cultures\nTiming: 1 to 3 weeks (for steps 42)\nThis step describes the culture conditions and maintenance used to prepare hPSCs for transfection.\nCritical: Do not use antibiotics in media. Ensure all plates used are pre-coated with Matrigel or equivalent.\nCulture hPSCs as described in steps 1 to 4.\nNote: hPSCs should be highly undifferentiated and grown to approximately 80% confluence before proceeding. Clean and passage hPSCs as detailed previously to achieve these conditions.\nNote: If hPSCs were maintained in hypoxia up to this point, they should be acclimated to normoxia for 48–72 h before proceeding.\nDay 1: Seed hPSC cells for transfection\nTiming: 2 to 3 h (for steps 43 to 45)\nThese steps describe dissociation and seeding of hPSCs into a monolayer the day before transfection.\nCritical: Prepare Matrigel-coated plates before dissociating hPSC colonies.\nNote: We recommend seeding dissociated hPSCs into 60 mm plates for transfection for ease of colony picking.\nNote: hPSCs are maintained in normoxic conditions in the following steps.\nDissociate hPSC colonies into single cells and pellet as described in step 11.\nCritical: hPSCs must be incubated with ROCKi medium for a minimum 2 h before dissociation.\nResuspend and count cells as described in step 12.",
    "Seed cell suspension into Matrigel-coated plates containing 1x well volume ROCKi medium at the following concentrations: 2 × 104, 1 × 104, 0.5 × 104, and 0.025 × 104 cells/cm2.\nNote: hPSCs are seeded at multiple densities to account for variability in subsequent transfection efficiency and selection steps.\nDay 2: Transfection with CRISPR complexes\nTiming: 0.5 to 2 h (for steps 46 to 48)\nThese steps describe the transfection conditions used to deliver CRISPR complexes to the hPSC monolayer generated in the previous section, as well as maintenance and selection of transfected cells.\nNote: The following steps are performed 16–24h after seeding dissociated hPSCs.\nAspirate ROCKi medium from plates and replace with 1x well volume growth medium.\nPrepare transfection medium:\nNote: Volumes below are for a single 60 mm plate.\nTube 1: 100 μL Opti-MEM I medium + 4 μL Lipofectamine Stem Reagent\nTube 2: 100 μL Opti-MEM I medium + 2 μg CRISPR plasmid + 0.5 μL of ssODN (100 μM).\nTransfer the contents of tube 2 into tube 1 and mix by gently pipetting.\nIncubate transfection medium for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd 200 μL of transfection medium dropwise to each plate of cells.\nDistribute drops of transfection medium evenly over entire plate, and rock plate gently to ensure even distribution of the transfection complex across the entire plate.\nReturn cells to incubator overnight.\nAspirate transfection mix and replace with 1x well volume of fresh growth medium. Refresh growth medium daily until ready for colony picking.\nNote: hPSCs may be returned to hypoxic conditions 4–5 days after transfection.",
    "Note: If an antibiotic resistance gene, e.g., puromycin, is included in the CRISPR plasmid, then antibiotic selection may be performed during this step. The concentration of antibiotic must be optimized for each hPSC line, and selection may not be possible for cell lines that are particularly sensitive.\nNote: Transfected hPSCs should ideally form discrete colonies that do not contact with neighboring colonies. See Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] for colonies ready for picking.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. hPSC colonies at ready for picking and transfer to 96-well plate for screening\nScale bar = 500 μm.\nDay 19: Colony picking\nTiming: 2 to 3 h (for steps 49 to 56)\nThese steps describe the isolation and transfer of transfected hPSC colonies from the transfection vessel into individual wells of a 96-well plate to facilitate screening.\nNote: Multiple plates with cells at different seeding densities were transfected in the above steps, however the optimal plate to select for colony picking is generally the one that took longest to form colonies, and therefore most likely contains clonal colonies.\nPrepare Matrigel-coated 96-well plate as described in step 1.\nAspirate media from transfected hPSCs and replace with 2x well volume ROCKi medium.\nReturn plate to hypoxic incubator for 1 h.\nAspirate Matrigel solution from 96-well plate and replace with 1x well volume ROCKi medium.\nUsing a p200 pipette, gently scrape off unique colonies and transfer each colony into a well of the 96-well plate. Repeat until the desired number of colonies have been picked. Use a fresh pipette tip for each colony to avoid cross contamination.\nNote: We find it helpful to perform this step with a sterile stereoscope. The ideal colony size to pick is roughly 2 to 3x the diameter of the p200 pipette tip. We recommend collecting at least one 96-well plate of colonies.",
    "Critical: Try to minimize volume of ROCKi medium transferred into the 96-well plate along with the selected colony to avoid cross contamination of colonies with floating cells. It may be necessary to refresh the ROCKi medium if excessive numbers of floating cells are present, as these may interfere with clonal selection.\nReturn 96-well plate containing picked colonies to hypoxic incubator overnight.\nAspirate ROCKi medium and replace with 1x well volume of growth medium.\nCritical: Avoid cross contamination of cells between wells.\nRefresh growth medium daily until wells reach approximately 80% confluence.\nDay 23: Passaging colonies\nTiming: 2 to 3 h (for steps 57 to 61)\nThese steps describe how to passage the selected hPSC colonies and a portion of each colony is collected for DNA extraction and screening.\nNote: Prepare Matrigel-coated 96-well plates before proceeding. The following steps additionally require 96-well PCR plates for genotyping of hPSC colonies.\nAspirate growth medium and replace with 30 μL Accutase. Return colonies to incubator for 5 min.\nNote: If concerned about viability, colonies may be incubated with ROCKi medium for 2 h before addition of Accutase.\nAspirate Matrigel solution from 96-well plate and replace with 1x well volume ROCKi medium.\nRemove colonies from incubator and gently aspirate off cell dissociation buffer. Slowly add 120 μL ROCKi medium to each well.\nCritical: Avoid aspirating hPSC colonies.\nUse a p200 to scrape and lift hPSC colonies, then gently triturate colonies by pipetting.\nTransfer 40 μL into the new Matrigel-coated plate and 40 μL into the PCR plate.\nNote: Triturate colonies until they have lifted from the plate but remain as small aggregates.\nCritical: Colonies break apart easily at this stage. Avoid vigorous trituration into a single cell suspension.",
    "Return passaged hPSC colonies to hypoxic incubator and immediately proceed to extraction of genomic DNA from PCR plate.\nReplace ROCKi medium with growth medium the next day.\nRefresh growth medium daily.\nNote: We recommend screening clones immediately, as described below, to avoid the need for additional passaging.\nDay 23: Extract genomic DNA from colonies\nTiming: 0.5 to 1 h (for steps 62 to 63)\nThese steps describe how DNA is extracted from the hPSC colonies collected in the previous section.\nNote: The following steps are performed on the PCR plate containing cell suspension obtained in step 60.\nPellet cell suspension by centrifugation, 600 g for 5 min, and remove supernatant.\nExtract DNA using QuickExtract DNA solution:\nAdd 5 μL of QuickExtract DNA solution to each well.\nSeal plate with film, and vortex to mix (15 S) and pool liquid by centrifugation, 500 g for 15 S.\nIncubate at 65°C for 6 min using thermal cycler.\nVortex plate, and pool liquid by centrifugation.\nIncubate at 98°C for 2 min.\nVortex plate, and pool liquid by centrifugation.\nAdd 5 μL of PCR-grade H2O.\nVortex plate, and pool liquid by centrifugation.\nNote: Use extracted DNA immediately for PCR. Typically 1–2 μL suffices for a 12–25 μL reaction.\nPause point: DNA may be stored at −20°C until ready to proceed.\nDay 24: PCR amplification of mutation site\nTiming: 5 to 6 h (for steps 64 to 68)\nThese steps describe how PCR is used to amplify the mutation site in order to screen for successfully edited hPSC colonies.\nPrepare a OneTaq PCR master mix solution (See Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) using primers specific to your mutation site.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2711_13.csv\nNote: Keep PCR master mix on ice.\nNote: 108x reaction volume is sufficient for 1x 96-well PCR plate.",
    "Perform PCR to screen for clones. Add 18 μL of PCR master mix to each well of a 96-well PCR plate.\nTransfer 2 μL of template DNA (obtained in steps 62 to 63) into each well.\nCover the plate with a PCR-compatible seal.\nVortex briefly, then centrifuge to pool liquid, 100 g for 30 S.\nPlace plate in a thermocycler and perform PCR at the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2711_14.csv\nNote: Annealing temperature and extension duration is determined by the primer composition and length of PCR fragment amplified, respectively. This may be different depending on your specific genomic region amplified.\nPause point: PCR product may be stored at −20°C until ready to proceed.\nPmeI digestion and gel electrophoresis\nTiming: 4 to 5 h (for steps 69 to 75)\nTiming: 1 to 2 days (for steps 76 to 82)\nThese steps describe how the PCR product obtained in the previous steps is digested using PmeI restriction enzyme, and how gel electrophoresis is used to separate and visualize the PCR products in order to identify successfully edited hPSC colonies.\nPrepare a Digestion master mix solution (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2711_15.csv\nDigest PCR reaction product.\nAdd 10 μL of master mix to each well of a PCR-compatible 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer 5 μL from each well of the PCR-amplified reaction product (obtained in step 68).\nSeal plate with film.\nVortex briefly, then centrifuge to pool liquid, 100 g for 30 S.\nIncubate plate in a thermocycler at 37°C for 1 h.\nPrepare 2% agarose (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]) and pour a thin gel with 4 × 26 slot combs (total of 104 wells).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2711_16.csv\nNote: TBE buffer is preferred here, as a long duration of electrophoresis will be required and TBE is less likely to heat up and melt the gel.",
    "Add 3 μL of 6x loading dye to each well of the digested PCR product.\nLoad 10 μL of each sample with loading dye into a well of the agarose gel. For each row, add a DNA ladder in the first and last wells.\nPerform gel electrophoresis at approximately 100 V. Depending on your fragment size this may take 1–2 h to adequately separate. If the buffer begins to heat up, perform electrophoresis at a lower voltage.\nVisualize the gel using a UV transilluminator.\nLook for lanes that show two bands.\nNote: Colonies that have successfully inserted the knockout template (and thus introduced a PmeI digestion site) show two bands, while wildtype alleles will only show one band.

The presence of a single band in digested lanes indicates the absence of a PmeI cut site and unsuccessful gene editing. The presence of two smaller bands indicates successful insertion of the repair template.\nNote: You may see three bands due to the presence of both wild type and mutant DNA.\nCritical: Subcloning should be performed to ensure a monoclonal population. Dissociate wells containing mutants and seed a low density to allow for formation of colonies, then repeat colony picking and screening steps.",
    "Critical: Once a monoclonal population is isolated, we recommend further validation by Sanger sequencing and Western blot. We also recommend submitting your sample for karyotyping.\nOptional: Validation of kidney organoid differentiation by immunofluorescence\nThis section describes staining of kidney organoids for podocyte, proximal tubule and distal tubule markers to visualize structure and organization. It is useful to perform these steps when optimizing the kidney organoid differentiation for your cell lines of choice to ensure that your conditions are producing high quality organoids.\nNote: The following protocol is for whole mount imaging, where kidney organoids are fixed, stained and imaged directly in the differentiation vessel. For best image quality, kidney organoids should be differentiated in optical-bottom plates.\nFix kidney organoids.\nAdd 1x well volume 8% (v/v) formaldehyde solution to differentiation vessel.\nNote: It is not necessary to aspirate medium from the vessel before fixation. Final concentration of formaldehyde is 4% v/v.\nIncubate at room temperature for 45 min.\nAspirate fixation solution and replace with 2x well volume PBS.\nIncubate at room temperature 15 min.\nRepeat washing (steps 76c-d) a total of 5 times to remove excess formaldehyde.\nNote: Fixed organoids can be stored in PBS + 0.05% NaN3 at 4°C for several weeks.\nPause point: Fixed organoids may be stored at 4°C for several days if necessary.\nPermeabilize and block fixed organoids.\nAspirate liquid from wells and replace with permeabilization + block solution (1% BSA, 0.1% TWEEN-20 in PBS).\nIncubate at room temperature for 3 h.\nAspirate permeabilization solution and replace with block + wash solution (1% BSA, 0.01% TWEEN-20 in PBS).\nIncubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nRepeat step 77c-d a total of 3 times.\nStain organoids with primary antibodies.

If so, perform 1 to 2 extra washes (step 79 c-d) to remove excess Hoechst after staining.\nNote: If kidney organoids were stained in optical-bottom plates, proceed directly to imaging. Otherwise, mount organoids under coverslips prior to imaging.\nImage kidney organoids using fluorescence or confocal microscopy. Well-differentiated kidney organoids should show staining of discrete regions that correspond to human nephron patterning (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2711-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13.
