    "NOTE: IRB approval was obtained, and informed consent was obtained from the donors.\n1. Lymphocyte isolation\nTransfer the apheresis product to a clean room.\n\tNOTE: Process validation was performed using normal donor apheresis from an external commercial vendor compliant with raw cellular material collection regulations.\nCollect samples for sterility testing, cell count, and cell phenotyping.\nElutriate on the counterflow centrifugation device using a primary medium of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution with 1% human serum albumin (HSA) and a secondary medium of saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride Injection USP) or Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS). Set the elutriation centrifugation speed at 900 × g and collect fractions based on flow rate and time.\nCollect samples from fraction 2 and perform the following tests: 2 mL for sterility testing; 0.5 mL for cell count and viability using acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI); 5 × 106 cells for cell phenotyping by flow cytometry.\nExpand a pure lymphocyte fraction (fraction 2) of cells in culture at 10 × 106 cells/cm2 in a 1 L closed-system bioreactor with 5 µmol/L of zoledronic acid and 300 IU/mL of IL-2.\nIncubate for seven days in an incubator set at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n2. Alpha-beta (αβ) T cell depletion\nHarvest cells from the 1 L closed-system bioreactor flask. Sterile-weld a 1 L transfer pack to the red line of the closed-system bioreactor, and use the appropriate pharmaceutical pump to transfer the cells into the transfer pack.\nTake the following samples: 10 mL for spent medium sterility; 0.5 mL of cells for cell count and viability using AO/PI; 5 × 106 cells for flow cytometry\nResuspend the cells at ~5 × 108 cells/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or (PBS/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) buffer + 0.5% HSA and biotinylated TCR αβ-specific antibody.",
    "Place the shaker in the refrigerator and incubate the cells at 2-8 °C for approximately 15 min with shaking.\nWash the cells with a total of 600 mL of PBS/EDTA buffer + 0.5% HSA. Centrifuge to remove the unbound antibody at 200-500 × g for 15 min at 2-8 °C. Resuspend ~5 × 108 cells/mL in PBS/EDTA buffer + 0.5% HSA with anti-biotin-specific microbeads (7.5 mL/1 vial).\nPlace the shaker in the refrigerator and incubate the cells at 2-8 °C for approximately 15 min with shaking. After incubation, centrifuge the cells at 200-500 × g for 15 min at 2-8 °C to remove the unbound microbeads. Resuspend ~6 × 107 cells/mL in PBS/EDTA buffer + 0.5% HSA and transfer them to a transfer pack bag.\nInstall the tubing set in the clinical grade magnetic cell separation device by following the manufacturer's instructions, place the packs with the PBS/EDTA buffer and the transfer pack with the cell product in the instrument and spike it when instructed by the instrument.\nSelect the Depletion 1.2 protocol for the depletion of the labeled αβ T cells.\nCentrifuge the target fraction (enriched γδ T cells) and resuspend the cells in medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum.\nTake a 0.5 mL sample and perform a cell count and viability with AO/PI stain. Bring cells to a final concentration of approximately 1 × 106 cells/mL. Take a sample of 5 × 106 cells of the product for flow cytometry phenotyping post-depletion.\n3. Co-culture with aAPCs\nIrradiate 5 × 107 aAPCs/flask at 100 Gy on the X-ray generating instrument.",
    "Use the aAPCs in co-culture at a 10:1 ratio with the γδ T cells. Place the irradiated aAPCs (5 × 107 cells/flask) and γδ T cells (5 × 106 cells/flask) in 1 L closed-system bioreactor flasks with 1 L of culture medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum. Seed up to 10 flasks.\nExpand the cells in culture for 10 days in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nMonitor glucose and lactate levels every 3-4 days using strips, glucose, and a lactate meter.\nIf glucose drops to 250 mg/dL, reduce the volume in the flask to 200 mL using a pharmaceutical pump by sterile-welding a 1 L transfer pack to the red line of the closed system bioreactor.\nMix the cells in the remaining 200 mL, and take a 0.5 mL sample for cell counting and viability measurement by AO-PI staining. If the cell count is ≥109, split one flask into two flasks and fill each flask up to 1 L with AIM-V supplemented with 10% human AB serum. If the cell count is <109, feed the cells with a fresh liter of culture medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum.\nRepeat step 3.6 for all the flasks and return them to the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Repeat steps 3.4-3.7 every 3 to 4 days.\n4. Cell harvest\nAt the end of 10 days in co-culture, harvest all the bioreactor flasks. Harvest 1 bioreactor flask at a time, and pool all the cells into a transfer pack of appropriate size. Sterile-weld the transfer pack to the red line of the closed-system bioreactor, and use the pharmaceutical pump to transfer the cells into the transfer pack.",
    "Remove the following quality control samples: 1% of the drug product (DP) for sterility by blood culture and gram staining; 0.5 mL for cell counting and viability using AO/PI; 5-10 × 106 cells for flow cytometry (see Figure 1 for gating strategy); 0.5 mL for endotoxin; 0.5 mL for gram staining; 106 cells spiked into 10 mL of spent medium for Mycoplasma testing.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200-500 × g for 15 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cells in a solution of balanced crystalloid solution+ 0.5% HSA at 200-500 × g for 15 min at room temperature. Resuspend them in a target volume of 100-300 mL of balanced crystalloid solution + 0.5% HSA.\n5. Release testing\nPerform quality control testing of the γδ T cell DP for the following: purity and Identity by flow cytometry (Live/Dead, CD45, CD3, TCR αβ, TCR γδ, CD20, CD56, CD16); viability by AO/PI staining; endotoxin; Mycoplasma testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); sterility by gram staining and aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures; residual K562 assay by flow cytometry (CD3-CD16-CD56-CD71+)."
