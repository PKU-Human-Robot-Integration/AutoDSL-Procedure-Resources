    "All animal procedures and protocols described here were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University.\n1. Preparation of cells for injection\nThaw luciferase-transduced EO771 cells13 from liquid nitrogen storage and plate 1 x 106 cells in a 10 cm tissue-culture dish in complete cell culture medium (RPMI1640 + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin + 1% amphotericin B).\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 80%-90% confluent, with medium changes every 2-3 days as necessary.\nTo harvest cells, aspirate cell culture medium and wash with 1x PBS. Incubate with 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution for about 2-3 min at 37 °C until the cells detach and then wash with 8 mL of complete medium to quench the reaction.\n\tNOTE: Prolonged cell exposure to trypsin will result in stripping of the cell surface proteins from the membrane and, ultimately, cause cell death.\nTransfer the contents to a 10 mL centrifuge tube and pellet the cells by spinning at 350 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of 1x PBS.\nCollect a 50 µL sample for counting and then re-pellet the cells by spinning at 350 x g for 5 min.\n\t\nWhile the cells are centrifuging, add 50 µL of trypan blue to the 50 µL sample and count the number of viable cells using a hemacytometer. Viable cells with intact cell membranes will exclude the dye and remain clear after the addition of trypan blue, while dying/dead cells will allow the dye to enter the cytoplasm and turn blue.\nDetermine the volume required to resuspend cells at 6 x 106 viable cells/mL (viable cell concentration [viable cells/mL]) by using the following formula:",
    "Average number of viable cells in the 4 sets of 16 squares × dilution factor × 1 x 104 cells/mL\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in sterile 1x PBS in the calculated volume necessary to dilute cells to 6 x 106 cells/mL. Transfer the cell suspension to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and keep on ice until ready for injection.\n2. Mammary fat pad injections\nNOTE: The present protocol can be used with any mouse strain, but given our interest in the immune microenvironment, we utilize C57BL6 mice. Female, virgin mice of 6-8 weeks old are typically used for breast cancer studies, as parity enhances tumorigenesis processes.\nThaw growth factor-reduced basement-membrane matrix on ice and keep on ice until ready for injection.\nAnesthetize mice in an induction chamber using 4%-5% isoflurane. Confirm a sufficient plane of anesthesia by assessing for the lack of toe-pinch reflex and lower the gas to 2% isoflurane for maintenance during the procedure.\n\tCAUTION: Isoflurane is an odorless inhaled anesthetic that is a known irritant to the eyes and skin and toxic to the central nervous system. It should be used in an environment with adequate ventilation. Long-term or chronic exposure to isoflurane may have adverse health effects. Veterinary anesthesia equipment that is properly calibrated, utilizes gas scavenging systems, and is frequently maintained by veterinary staff should be used.\nShave the hair on the abdomen of the mouse using electric clippers and then place in a supine position in a nose cone attached to an anesthesia machine using a maintenance isoflurane rate of 2%. Apply ophthalmic ointment to each eye of the animal to prevent corneal injury.\nClean the prepared abdominal region using 70% ethanol and povidone-iodine solution.",
    "Using scissors, make a small midline incision (usually ~1 cm) through the abdominal skin at the level of the 4th mammary tissue, exposing but not penetrating through the underlying peritoneum.\n\tNOTE: Other procedures for tumor cell implantation in the mammary gland, such a subcutaneous injection or intraductal inoculation, can be utilized. While somewhat invasive, this surgical procedure is straightforward to learn and master, and visualizing the fat pad significantly improves the accuracy, with little risk of injection outside the mammary gland, which is critical for the subsequent effective removal of the tumor.\nUsing forceps, hold the skin away from the peritoneum. Use ethanol-dipped sterile cotton swabs to separate the skin away from the peritoneum, moving laterally to expose the right mammary fat pad. Repeat on the left side to expose the left mammary fat pad.\nResuspend the EO771 cell suspension using a manual pipette and transfer 100 µL to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add an equal volume of basement-membrane matrix solution and mix well, taking care not to introduce bubbles, and keep on ice. The final cell suspension will now contain 150,000 cells per 50 µL.\nDraw up 100 µL of cell suspension into a 28G 0.5 mL U-100 insulin syringe and keep on ice.\nUsing forceps, lift the skin and gently grab and expose the right mammary fat pad. Inject 50 µL of cell suspension into the mammary fat pad and wait for 3-5 s prior to removing the syringe from the mammary fat pad to allow the matrix to begin to solidify and decrease the chance of the cell suspension backflowing through the injection site. A small bubble will form by the end of the injection.",
    "Release the skin from the forceps, allowing the mammary fat pad to return naturally to its normal position. Repeat the procedure with the left mammary fat pad, placing the syringe containing the cell suspension back on ice between injections.\nClose the skin incision, applying skin staples. The length of the incision will determine the number of skin staples required, with most procedures requiring one to two staples per incision. Make sure there is a minimum distance of 0.5 cm between staples.\nUpon surgical closure, transfer the mouse to a clean recovery cage. Monitor as needed until the animal rights itself and resumes normal behavior.\nMonitor animals daily for the first 5 days post operation, assessing the animals' weight and any signs of distress, such as unkept fur, hunched back, and reddish-brown nasal or ocular discharge.\nCheck the animals for signs of wound infection, such as surgical site erythema or necrosis and guarding of the incision site, and humanely sacrifice animals who lose >20% of their initial body weight or who meet the criteria for severe distress, as described by institution-specific IACUC guidelines.\n3. Tumor resections\nUse calipers to monitor the growth of the orthotopic breast tumor lesion 3 times/week by taking measurements of the primary tumor length (L) and width (W). Calculate tumor volume using the formula:\n\tπLW2/6\n\t\nDetermine tumor resection empirically depending on the specific cell line injected. Always remove tumors at the smallest possible size to reduce chances of re-growth. For the EO771 cells described in this protocol, perform tumor resection when the tumors reach 150 mm3 in volume.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal time of resections needs to be determined for individual cell lines, but 150 mm3 is a good starting point, as the procedure can efficiently excise all the tumor once the user is experienced.",
    "Anesthetize the mice in an induction chamber using 4% isoflurane and confirm a sufficient plane of anesthesia by assessing for the lack of toe-pinch reflex. Administer 40 µL of meloxicam (2 mg/mL) subcutaneously for pain control, and then place the mouse in a supine position in a nose cone attached to an anesthesia machine using a maintenance isoflurane rate of 2%. Apply ophthalmic ointment to each eye of the animal to prevent corneal injury.\n\tNOTE: Analgesic needs to be administered every 24 h for 3 days. Alternatively, a slow-release formulation dose of an opioid like buprenorphine can be administered at the time of the procedure, which will last for 72 h.\nRemove prior surgical staples, if necessary, and clean the abdomen with 70% ethanol and povidone-iodine solution.Using scissors, make a small midline incision (usually ~1 cm) through the abdominal skin at the level of the 4th mammary tissue, exposing but not penetrating through the underlying peritoneum.\nUse blunt dissection to separate the orthotopic tumor from the peritoneum and the overlying skin. Remove the orthotopic tumor by cutting through the normal mammary tissue located proximally and distally to the tumor using scissors and discard the tumor tissue into a biohazard bag. Repeat with the contralateral tumor. If bleeding occurs, quickly cauterize the vasculature.\n\tNOTE: If orthotopic tumors have infiltrated into the peritoneum, evidenced by a tumor that is not well-circumscribed or easily separable from the peritoneum by blunt dissection, animals should be sacrificed, as removal of the tumor will not be complete, and it will regrow, leading to confounding of the background bioluminescence signal and morbidity.",
    "Use one to three staples to close the surgical site and transfer the mouse to a clean recovery cage with a warm heating pad underneath to improve the recovery of the animal following the tumor resection procedure. Monitor as needed until the animal rights itself and resumes normal behavior.\n\t\nFor animals that have lost some blood during the procedure, administer a 300 µL injection of sterile 0.9% normal saline administered intraperitoneally following closure of the surgical site.\nIf needed, image the animals at this point for bioluminescence signal, as described in step 4., to assess the completeness of tumor resection and baseline minimal residual disease. If resection was incomplete and there is remaining bioluminescence signal in the primary tumor region, humanely sacrifice the animal, as growth of the remaining tumor cells may result in confounding of the background bioluminescence signal.\nMonitor the animals daily for the first 5 days post operation, assessing the animals' weight and any signs of distress, such as unkept fur, hunched back, and reddish-brown nasal or ocular discharge.\nCheck the animals for signs of wound infection, such as surgical site erythema or necrosis and guarding of the incision site. Humanely sacrifice animals who lose >20% of their initial body weight or who meet the criteria for severe distress, as described by institution-specific IACUC guidelines.\n4. In vivo quantification of spontaneous lung metastasis\nPerform in vivo imaging of the animals on the day of tumor resection to establish a baseline signal, and then 2-3 times/week thereafter to assess the growth of spontaneous metastatic lung tumor lesions.\nClick Initialize to start the imaging instrument for warm-up while the animals are prepared for the procedure.",
    "Anesthetize the mice in an induction chamber using 4% isoflurane and confirm a sufficient plane of anesthesia by assessing for the lack of toe-pinch reflex. Confirm that oxygen and isoflurane anesthesia is flowing to the imaging instrument.\nInject the animals with 100 µL of D-luciferin solution (15 mg/mL in sterile PBS) using a retro-orbital injection by inserting the needle in the medial canthus of the eye at a 45° angle from the nose. Insert the needle until bony resistance is felt, at which point withdraw the needle by ~1 mm prior to injecting D-luciferin solution to ensure the needle is placed within the retroorbital venous sinus.\n\tNOTE: D-luciferin solution can be delivered by other routes, such as intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection, however, the kinetics of substrate metabolization will be longer and the distribution to different organs heterogeneous.\nConfirm successful injection by the lack of flush back of any liquid upon delivery and wait 2 min prior to imaging.While waiting, transfer the animals to the nose cones located inside the bioluminescence imager in a supine position and decrease the isoflurane to a maintenance rate of 2%.\nBefore acquiring a bioluminescence image of the animal, ensure that the checkbox next to Photograph is checked to simultaneously acquire a photograph of the animal using medium binning and f/stop 8. Ensure the checkbox next to Overlay is checked to overlay the photograph with the bioluminescence image. Set the exposure time to 1 min, with medium binning, f/stop = 1, and capture an image by clicking on Acquire.\nMeasure photon flux as follows. Create a square ROI using the ROI tools dropdown menu for each animal depicted in the image, by clicking the Square ROI button. Reposition the automatically generated ROI over the thorax of each animal by clicking and dragging with the mouse.",
    "Click the Measure ROIs button and ensure that data are displayed as radiance (photons/s) and not counts, so that images acquired with different exposure times can be compared.\n5. Collection of lung tissues for histological analysis\nNOTE: Animals can be sacrificed as described below at any experimental time point or when animals meet the criteria for humane sacrifice, according to institution-specific IACUC guidelines. In our experience, mice reach the humane endpoint approximately 21-28 days after resection of the primary tumors.\nAnesthetize the mice in an induction chamber using 4% isoflurane and confirm a sufficient plane of anesthesia by assessing for the lack of toe-pinch reflex. Place the animal in a supine position in a nose cone attached to an anesthesia machine using a maintenance isoflurane rate of 2%.\nUse scissors to make a midline incision below the xyphoid process, cutting through the skin, musculature, and peritoneum to expose the lower part of the thoracic cavity, until the diaphragm is visible. Puncture the diaphragm to collapse the lungs and then cut through the diaphragm.\nCut through the ribcage on the right and left side and then use a hemostat to grab the xyphoid process and move the ribcage out of the way, exposing the heart and lungs. Snip the right atrium using scissors.\nPerfuse the animal with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS through the left ventricle and assess the completeness of perfusion by confirming that fluid flowing from the right atrium turns clear and that the liver turns a pale-yellow color.\nIdentify the trachea and insert a 22G needle syringe with 3 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde, holding it parallel to the trachea. Deliver the solution at a slow pace until the lungs have fully inflated. Hold the trachea with forceps over the needle, and slowly remove the needle to prevent backflow.",
    "NOTE: Threading a suture beneath the trachea prior to injection of fixative, followed by tying of the suture around the trachea after injection, may be another option for preventing backflow of the fixative.\nContinue gently holding the trachea, snip it with scissors above the forceps, and start carefully lifting the tissue while removing all the connective tissue. Dissect the heart away from the lungs.\nPlace lung tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight and store at 4 °C for fixation. Transfer the tissue to PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide for long-term storage or process further for histological analysis, as needed.\nSubscription Required.
