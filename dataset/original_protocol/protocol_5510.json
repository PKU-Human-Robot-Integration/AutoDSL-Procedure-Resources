    "Preparation of sonicated chromatinFormaldehyde crosslinking of cells (e.g., 2 x 107 DT40 cells, 1% formaldehyde in culture medium at 37 °C for 5 min) and preparation of chromatin are performed as described previously (steps B and C in Fujita and Fujii, 2014b).Sonicate the prepared chromatin (e.g., Output: 3, Duty: 100%, Time: Free, 10 sec x 15 cycles using Ultrasonic Disruptor UD-201 (TOMY)) as described previously (step D in Fujita and Fujii, 2014b) except for substituting 800 µl of in vitro CRISPR buffer (+ 0.5 mM DTT) (see Recipes) instead of MLB3.Evaluate fragmentation of chromatin (the average length of fragments is about 2 kbp) as described previously (step E in Fujita and Fujii, 2014b).Preparation of gRNAMix 2 µl of 10 µM crRNA and 2 µl of 10 µM tracrRNA. In our previous study (Fujita et al., 2017a), a crRNA (cggcaggcucgggugcgccuguuuuagagcuaugcuguuuug) and a tracrRNA (aacagcauagcaaguuaaaauaaggcuaguccguuaucaacuugaaaaaguggcaccgagucggugcuuuuuuu) were used for targeting the chicken Pax5 promoter region; the underlined sequence is corresponding to the target site.Incubate at 100 °C for 2 min in a block heater. Incubation for 2 min does not make considerable evaporation. After heating, put the RNAs out of the heater to naturally cool down to room temperature. The RNAs are ready for step D6.Preparation of Dynabeads conjugated with antibody (anti-FLAG antibody or normal mouse IgG)Prepare two 1.5 ml tubes; one is for anti-FLAG antibody and the other is for normal mouse IgG. Add 20 µl slurry of Dynabeads-Protein G in each tube (20 µl x 2 tubes). In this regard, we usually use 20 µl slurry of the beads for 2 µg of an antibody (see step C7). In this protocol, we describe preparation of one sample for NGS analysis. In this regard, normal mouse IgG is used for pre-clear in step E1 and anti-FLAG antibody is used in Procedure D.",
    "If you handle another sample (e.g., affinity purification without gRNA as a negative control), you may prepare chromatin and Dynabeads for it separately.Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting. Detailed instructions on the use of the magnetic stand are illustrated in Figure 2 in Fujita and Fujii, 2014b.Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of PBS-T (see Recipes). Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Repeat step F3 (total of twice).Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of PBS-T-BSA (see Recipes).Add 2 µg of antibody, to the beads either anti-FLAG or normal mouse IgG. Rotate at 4 °C overnight. As to Dynabeads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody, proceed to Procedure D. As to Dynabeads conjugated with normal mouse IgG, proceed to the next step (C7).Centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec). Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of PBS-T. Invert several times and centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec). Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Repeat step C8, twice (total of three times). The Dynabeads conjugated with normal mouse IgG are ready for step E1.Preparation of Dynabeads conjugated with recombinant CRISPR RNPsAdd 2 µg of recombinant 3xFLAG-dCas9-D to the tube, in which Dynabeads are conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody in 0.5 ml of PBS-T-BSA (step C6). Rotate at 4 °C for 2-3 h.Centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec). Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of PBS-T. Invert several times and centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec).",
    "Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Repeat step D3 (total of twice).Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of in vitro CRISPR buffer (+ 0.5 mM DTT). Invert several times and centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec). Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Add 100 µl of in vitro CRISPR buffer (+ 0.5 mM DTT) and 4 µl of the gRNA prepared in Procedure B.Incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. The Dynabeads conjugated with recombinant CRISPR RNPs are ready for step E3.Affinity purification (chromatin immunoprecipitation)Take 800 µl of the fragmented chromatin (Procedure A), which corresponds to chromatin extracted from 2 x 107 cells, and add to the tube containing the Dynabeads conjugated with normal mouse IgG (step C9). Rotate at 4 °C for 1 h.Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min.Transfer the cleared supernatant into the tube, in which the Dynabeads conjugated with recombinant CRISPR RNPs were prepared (step D7). Add RNase inhibitor (40 U/ml, final concentration).Incubate at 37 °C for 20 min at 650 rpm in a block heater.Place the tubes on the magnetic stand on ice for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Wash the beads with 1 ml of modified low salt buffer (+ 0.04% SDS) (see Recipes). Rotate at 4 °C for 10 min.
