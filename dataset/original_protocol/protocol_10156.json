    "1. Fabrication of the PDMS Microdevice to Examine Growing Pollen Tubes and Moss Protonemata\nNOTE: We used a maskless photolithography instrument to prepare PDMS molds on silicon wafers. The details regarding the operation of the system are omitted in this manuscript. A standard photolithography technique9 using a photomask may also be used to create the PDMS molds described in this manuscript.\nPour 11 g of pre-polymer PDMS mixture (elastomer base:curing agent at a ratio of 10:1) into each 4-inch mold.\nDegas the mold prepared in step 1.1 for 20 min in a vacuum chamber.\nAfter curing at 65 °C for 90 min in a non-convection oven, peel the PDMS layer off the mold, and punch access holes into the fluidic channels using biopsy punches.\n\tNOTE: For the pollen tube device, the size of the hole must be adjusted to reflect the diameter of the pistil. This value will therefore vary by species. In this experiment, we punched a 1 mm hole for the pistil inlets and 1.5 mm holes for the liquid medium reservoirs. For the moss protonemata device, a 4 mm hole was used for the sample reservoir.\nExpose the PDMS layer and a glass bottom dish (3.5 - 5 cm in diameter) to air plasma for 50 s.\nPress the PDMS layer into the glass bottom dish and heat at 65 °C for 30 min in a non-convection oven to completely seal off the microfluidic network.\n2. Fabrication of the PDMS Microdevice for Root Hairs\nRepeat steps 1.1 - 1.3 using the molds to prepare two PDMS layers for the root and root hair microdevices.\n\tNOTE: We used a 2 mm hole for the liquid medium reservoirs in the root microdevice.\nExpose both PDMS layers to air plasma for 50 s.",
    "Assemble the two PDMS layers under a stereomicroscope using a custom-made desktop aligner.\n\tNOTE: The microchannels on these PDMS layers must face each other. Before assembling, make sure that the alignment marks on both layers match up.\nHeat at 65 °C for 30 min in a non-convection oven to completely seal off the microfluidic network.\nRemove the cover slip from the constructed microdevice and place the device on a glass bottom dish that is 5 cm in diameter.\n3. Preparation of In Vitro Cell Culture Medium for Pollen Tubes (Torenia fournieri)\nPrepare modified Nitsch's medium as described previously15 and autoclave the medium at 121 °C for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: The composition of the modifed Nitsch's medium is NH4NO3 (80 mg/L), KNO3 (125 mg/L), Ca(NO3)2‧4H2O (500 mg/L), MgSO4‧7H2O (125 mg/L), KH2PO4 (125 mg/L), MnSO4‧4H2O (3 mg/L), ZnSO4‧7H2O (0.5 mg/L), H3BO3 (10 mg/L), CuSO4‧5H2O (0.025 mg/L), Na2MoO4‧2H2O (0.025 mg/L), sucrose (50,000 mg/L), and casein (500 mg/L). The prepared medium can be stored at 4 °C for 4 months at least.\nPrepare 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol using autoclaved deionized water and filter the solution with a 0.3 µm pore filter.\n\tNOTE: The prepared medium can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month.\nMix the reagents prepared in step 3.1 and 3.2 in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio.\n\tNOTE: This medium should be prepared fresh for each use.\n4. Preparation of In Vitro Cell Culture Medium for Root Hairs (Arabidopsis thaliana)\nPrepare a solution of 0.215% (w/v) Murashige & Skoog Medium, 0.05% (w/v) MES, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 1% (w/v) agar in deionized water. Autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 20 min.\n5. Preparation of In Vitro Cell Culture Medium for Moss Protonemata (Physcomitrella patens)\nPre-incubate the moss protonemata in BCDAT medium16 in a Petri dish.",
    "NOTE: The composition of BCDAT medium is 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM KNO3, 45 µM FeSO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 (pH adjusted to 6.5 with KOH), trace element solution (0.22 µM CuSO4, 0.19 µM ZnSO4, 10 µM H3BO3, 0.1 µM Na2MoO4, 2 µM MnCl2, 0.23 µM CoCl2, and 0.17 µM KI), 1 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM diammonium(+)-tartrate.\nCulture the moss in the BCDATG medium in the microdevice.\n\tNOTE: The BCDATG medium is BCDAT medium with 0.5 % (w/v) glucose. The prepared medium can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month.\n6. In Vitro Culturing of T. fournieri Pollen Tubes in the Microdevice\nPlace the pollen tube microdevice in a vacuum chamber and degas for 20 min.\nRemove the microdevice from the vacuum chamber and introduce the growth medium to the pistil inlet using a micropipette with a very fine tip. Fill the remaining wells to their tops with the same medium. Wait for a few minutes until all the microchannels are filled with the medium by the vacuum created inside of the microchannels.\nPlace some wet paper towel in the glass bottom dish to maintain the humidity in the dish.\nTransfer the pollen grains from a wild-type T. fournieri 'blue and white' flower to its stigma using a dissection needle.\n\tNOTE: We also conducted this experiment with a transgenic T. fournieri 'Crown violet' flower (the RPS5Ap::H2B-tdTomato line17), with pollen tubes containing fluorescently labeled sperm cells and vegetative nuclei.\nCut the pollinated style (1 cm long) using a blade.\nInsert the cut style into the inlet of the device as shown in Figure 2.\nPut a lid on the dish and seal it with tape.\nPlace the device in an incubator at 28 °C for 5 - 6 h in darkness.",
    "7. In Vitro Culturing of A. thaliana Root Hairs in the Microdevice\nNOTE: Steps 7.1 - 7.9 (except for 7.3 and 7.5) should be performed in a laminar flow hood.\nSterilize seeds from A. thaliana Columbia (Col-0) and the transgenic line UBQ10pro::H2B-mClover (containing the fluorescent nuclear marker) by soaking them in sterile liquid (5% (v/v) household bleach and 0.02 % (v/v) Triton X-100) for 5 min.\nThoroughly rinse the sterilized seeds with autoclaved water.\nStore the rinsed seeds in water for 2 days at 4 °C in darkness.\nSterilize the microdevice under UV light overnight.\nPlace the microdevice in a vacuum chamber and degas for 20 min.\nIntroduce the growth medium to the wells in the device using a micropipette. Wait a few minutes until the vacuum fills all the microchannels with the medium.\nPlace autoclaved wet paper towel in the glass bottom dish to maintain the humidity in the dish.\nTransfer a sterilized seed into the inlet of the device.\nPut a lid on the dish and seal it with tape.\nPlace the device vertically in an incubator at 22 °C under continuous white light.\nCheck root hair growth after 4 - 10 days of incubation. Obtain both bright field and fluorescent images using an inverted microscope.\n8. In Vitro Culturing of P. patens (moss) Protonemata in the Microfluidic Device\nNOTE: Steps 8.2 - 8.6 (except for 8.3) should be performed in a laminar flow hood.\nPreculture P. patens strain Gransden 200418 on BCDAT medium covered with cellophane in a Petri dish for one week under continuous white light at 25 °C.\nSterilize the microdevice under UV light overnight in a laminar flow hood.\nPlace the microdevice in a vacuum chamber and degas for 20 min.",
    "Introduce the growth medium to the wells using a micropipette. Wait a few minutes until the vacuum fills all the microchannels with the medium.\nAdd autoclaved water into the dish surrounding the microdevice to maintain the humidity in the dish.\nTransfer a small piece of moss protonemata tissue to the inlet of the microdevice and culture the tissue in an incubator at 25 °C under continuous white light.\nCheck the moss protonemata growth after 2 - 3 weeks of incubation. Obtain bright field images using a microscope.\n9. Time-lapse Imaging of T. fournieri  Pollen Tube Growth\nPlace the microdevice on an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with image acquisition hardware (e.g., a CCD camera) and software. Find the microgap locations.\n\tNOTE: For the image acquisition software, we used a commercially available product (Table of Materials). Open source microscopy software such as µManager is also available online (https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager). We recommend installing a microscope condenser on the microscope to obtain higher resolution images.\nCapture bright field images every 10 s using microscope image acquisition software.\nTo observe the fluorescently labeled sperm cells and vegetative nucleus in the pollen tube of the RPS5Ap::H2B-tdTomato line, irradiate the specimen with 561 nm laser and use a bandpass optical filter (578/105 nm).\n\tNOTE: Although the time-lapse images of pollen tube growth were captured frequently, imaging did not appear to affect growth. However, it is always recommended to minimize the laser intensity, exposure time, and time-lapse interval, to minimize the phototoxicity and photobleaching of the fluorophore.\nAdjust the brightness and contrast of the images and prepare a video file using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).\nSubscription Required.
