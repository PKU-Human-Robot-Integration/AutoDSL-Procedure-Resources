    "RNA isolation from human brain samples Dissect human postmortem brain samples as previously described (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2008). In our publication (Diaz-Ortiz et al., 2022), we used neurologically normal controls (NC, n = 2) and PD (n = 4) individuals, and we dissected the caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum.Isolate total RNA from postmortem brain samples using TRIzol and RNeasy Mini columns as previously described (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2008).Assess RNA concentration and purity by spectrophotometric measurement of 260/280 nm OD ratios using a NanoDrop.Note: We require 260/280 ratios between 1.90 and 2.10 (for ratios outside this range, see General notes and troubleshooting). Assess RNA integrity by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer following the RNA 6000 Nano Kit guide.Note: While RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) of > 7 are desired for most applications, this may not be possible in all cases; our RINs varied between 5.2 and 9.0 (average 6.5). In cases where RIN < 6.5, visual inspection of Bioanalyzer traces is encouraged to ascertain the etiology (see General notes and troubleshooting). Example Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer traces with corresponding RINs are shown in Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4832/bioprotoc-13-19-4832-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example Bioanalyzer traces of RNA samples with various RNA integrity numbers (RINs), specifically RIN = 9.0 (A), RIN = 5.2 (B), and RIN = 3.2 (C). While both B and C have relatively low RIN numbers, the wide second peak from left to right in trace B is consistent with the presence of small RNAs, while the absence of four distinct peaks in trace C is consistent with true RNA degradation.Aliquot RNA isolates and store at -80 °C until use.Note: We prepared multiple 20 μL aliquots from each brain sample isolated, so that each aliquot can be single used to minimize freeze-thaw effects, which can affect RNA quality and downstream steps.",

    "Place samples from step B4b in a thermocycler and run for 30–60 min at 16 °C followed by a 4 °C hold until ready for next step.Clean up double-stranded cDNA.Mix 60 μL of double-stranded cDNA samples from step B4c with 108 μL of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (prewarmed to room temperature for 30 min and vortexed to ensure a homogeneous suspension) by gently pipetting up and down several times.Incubate the tube at room temperature for 15 min to allow the cDNA to bind to the beads.Place the tube on a dyna-mag2 magnet to capture the beads and incubate until the liquid is clear.Carefully remove and discard the supernatant using a P200 pipette.Keeping the tube on the magnet, add 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol.Incubate the tube at room temperature for ≥ 30 s.Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.Repeat steps B5e–B5g.Allow the beads to dry at room temperature until all ethanol evaporates. Visually inspect for any remaining drops of ethanol in the tube. The sample is sufficiently dry when no drops are left. Caution:  Over-drying the beads (for longer than 3–5 min) may result in dramatic yield loss.Remove the tubes from the magnet.Perform A-tailing.Prepare A-tailing Master Mix by mixing 24 μL of PCR-grade water, 3 μL of 10× KAPA A-Tailing Buffer, and 3 μL of KAPA A-Tailing Enzyme.For each sample, resuspend beads from step B5i in 30 μL of A-tailing master mix by pipetting up and down.Place samples in a thermocycler and run for 30 min at 30 °C and 20–30 min at 60 °C followed by a 4 °C hold until ready for next step.Ligate adapters.Generate a 700 nM adapter working dilution for each adapter ligation reaction.Note: Adapter concentration should be adjusted for input RNA amount other than 100 ng per user guide appendix F.",

    "Analyze DNA library quality on a Bioanalyzer using Agilent DNA 1000 chip following the Agilent 2100 Kit user guide.Note: The average fragment size should be between 150 and 500 bp. SeqCap RNA ChoiceTM probe pool design Design SeqCap RNA probe pools, using Roche Sequencing Solutions Custom Design (Roche, WI).We designed probes of approximately 60 bp in length with no more than 20 close matches in the genome, as determined by the Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm (SSAHA). The goal was to provide sufficient coverage of transcripts of interest (GPNMB, KLHL7) while minimizing potential off-target effects. A close match is defined as any genomic sequence that differs from one of the probe sequences by five or fewer single-base insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Select exonic probes that cover the transcript(s) of interest (here, GPNMB and KLHL7). While single mismatches within a 60 bp probe are typically not thought to affect hybridization dynamics, as a conservative measure to minimize SNP-mediated capture bias, we ensured that probes do not overlap any SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.2) with the sentinel SNP (here, rs199347).Target cDNA enrichment Perform target cDNA enrichment and sequencing as previously described (Mercer et al., 2014) using the SeqCap EZ Accessory kit v2, as summarized below:Hybridize samples to SeqCap RNA probe pools.Thaw 4.5 μL of SeqCap RNA probe pool aliquots (one per sample library, see user guide for instructions on how to generate these) on ice.Spin down the lyophilized SeqCap HE Universal and SeqCap HE Index Oligos, then resuspend in PCR-grade water to 1 mM and vortex to mix.",
    "Combine the HE oligos such that the resulting HE oligo pool contains 50% SeqCap HE Universal Oligo and 50% of a mixture of the appropriate SeqCap HE Index oligos, for a combined amount of 2,000 pmol that is required for a single sequence capture experiment.Combine equimolar amounts of cDNA libraries (already barcoded) from each brain sample for a total mass of 1 μg.In a 1.5 mL tube, combine 5 μL of human COT DNA (control DNA included in SeqCap accessory kit v2), 1 μg of pooled cDNA from previous step, and 2,000 pmol of HE oligo pool.Dry the samples from section E step 1d in a vacuum concentrator or at high heat at 60 °C and then resuspend in 7.5 μL of 2× Hybridization buffer with 3 μL of hybridization component A by vortexing and then spinning down for 10 s at maximum speed.Place samples in a pre-warmed 95 °C heat block for 10 min to denature cDNA; then, centrifuge for 10 s at maximum speed.Transfer 10.5 μL of sample to 4.5 μL aliquot of SeqCap RNA probe pool in a 0.2 mL PCR tube, vortex for 3 s, and spin down at maximum speed for 10 s.Finally, hybridize the pooled cDNA library to SeqCap RNA probes by running in a thermocycler at 47 °C (lid temperature at 57 °C) for 16–20 h.Wash and recover the captured multiplex cDNA sample.Prepare the captured multiplex cDNA samples from section E step 1h by first ligating them to pre-washed capture beads (100 μL of beads per capture reaction in 0.2 mL tubes) in a thermocycler for 45 min at 47 °C with the lid at 57 °C.",
    "Perform multiple washes, as specified in the Roche SeqCap RNA Enrichment System User’s Guide using the Dyna-mag2 magnet: once with 100 μL of 47 °C wash buffer I, twice with 200 μL of 47 °C stringent wash buffer, once with 200 μL of room temperature wash buffer I, once with 200 μL of room temperature wash buffer II, and once with 200 μL of room temperature wash buffer III).Finally, resuspend the beads ligated to captured cDNA libraries in 50 μL of PCR-grade water.Note: Samples can be stored at -20 °C until ready for post-ligation LM-PCR. Post-capture library amplification by LM-PCR Prepare the Post-Capture LM-PCR Master Mix on ice by mixing 25 μL of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix and 5 μL of Post-LM-PCR Oligos 1 & 2 (5 μM) per reaction.Mix 20 μL of bead-bound captured cDNA (vortexed to ensure homogeneous suspension) or 20 μL of PCR-grade water (for negative control) with 30 μL of Post-Capture LM-PCR Master Mix.Transfer samples to a thermocycler and run at the following settings: 45 s at 98 °C; 14 cycles of 15 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C; 5 min at 72 °C; and hold at 4 °C.Purify the amplified samples with Agencourt AMPure XP beads by adding 180 μL of prepared beads to 100 μL of amplified sample and then following steps outlined in section B step 5.Note: Alternatively, use Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. Assess DNA purity and quality with NanoDrop and bioanalyzer as specified in the pre-capture library amplification section.Note: The desired 260/280 ratio is 1.7–2.0, and the desired fragment size is 150–500 bp. If either of these conditions is not met, that is a red flag. Sequencing Pool post-capture PCR amplified libraries.Perform paired-end sequencing of DNA sequencing of pooled libraries.",
