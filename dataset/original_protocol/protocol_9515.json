    "1. Plasmid Construction\nConstruct an expression plasmid (pBAD-HerFab-L177TAG) that would express the target antibody gene (pBAD-HerFab-WT) with a His6-tag, and replace the codon for Leucine-177 with the amber codon (TAG) 27, using conventional site-directed mutagenesis technique.\n\tSee Table of Materials.\nConstruct another expression plasmid (pEVOL-AFRS) containing the genes for the evolved tRNATyr and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) pair. Use the specially designed plasmid vector, pEVOL, for efficient incorporation of UAAs. The detailed plasmid information and cloning protocols are described in the previous report.28\nObtain high quality plasmid DNA by using commercially available plasmid preparation kits. The 260/280 ratio of ~1.8 is optimal for the purified DNA. If required, perform 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to check the purity of the DNA.\n2. Culture Preparation\nElectroporation\nAdd each 1 µL DNA of pEVOL-AFRS28 and pBAD-HerFab-L177TAG to 20 µL Escherichia coli DH10β strain. Mix gently, using a pipette. The plasmids can be transformed together or in independent reactions.\nFor 0.1 cm cuvettes, set the electroporation settings to 25 µF and 2.5 kV.\nInsert the cuvette into the slide of the shocking chamber. Push the slide into the chamber until the cuvette makes firm contact with the chamber electrodes.\nPulse once by pressing the pulse button until the electroporation machine beeps.\nAdd 1 mL super optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC) medium containing 2% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM glucose to the cuvette quickly and transfer the mixture to a test tube. Incubate the cells for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking.\nSpread transformed E. coli cells on Lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics (35 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 100 µg/mL ampicillin for selecting pEVOL-AFRS and pBAD-HerFab-L177TAG, respectively). Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 12 h.\nCulture preparation",
    "Inoculate a single transformed colony in 5 mL LB medium containing antibiotics. Incubate for 12 h at 37 °C with shaking.\n3. Expression and Purification of HerFab-L177AF\nExpression of HerFab-L177AF\nTransfer the primary culture (5 mL) into 200 mL LB medium containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and AF (1 mM), followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking.\n\t\tNOTE: 100 mM AF stock solution (10 mL) was prepared by dissolving 206 mg AF in 100 mM hydrochloric acid (10 mL, final volume).\nAdd 2 mL of 1.6 M arabinose (16 mM final concentration) when the culture reaches the log-phase (OD550 = 0.8, OD = Optical density). Incubate for 12 h at 30 °C with shaking.\nHarvest cells by centrifugation at 11,000 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant and freeze the pellet at -20 °C.\nCell lysis\nResuspend the cell pellets in 20 mL periplasmic lysis buffer containing 30 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 20% sucrose, and 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubate the mixture for 1 h at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 18,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and discard the pellet.\nNi-NTA affinity chromatography\nAdd Ni-NTA resin suspension to each centrifuge tube (400 µL resin for a 200 mL culture), and mix gently at 4 °C for 1 h.\nPour the suspension into a polypropylene column and wash the resin three times with 5 mL wash buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 20 mM imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl.\nElute the target antibody with 300 µL elution buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 250 mM imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl.",
    "Determine concentration of the mutant protein by Bradford protein assay29 or by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Calculate the extinction coefficient (75,866 M-1cm-1) for HerFab-L177AF at 280 nm by protein extinction coefficient calculator using the extinction coefficient (2,471 M-1cm-1) for AF.\n\t\tNOTE: The amino acid sequence of HerFab can be found in the NCBI website (GI:783282791 and GI:783282792).\n4. Conjugation of Purified HerFab-L177AF with Alkyne Probes Using Strain-promoted Azide-alkyne Cycloaddition (SPAAC)\nAdd 20 µL of Cy5.5-Azadibenzocyclooctyne(Cy5.5-ADIBO) in H2O (200 µM final concentration) to a solution of 10 µL of HerFab-L177AF (10 µM final concentration) in phosphate buffer containing 10 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and 100 mM NaCl.\n\tNOTE: As alternatives, difluorinated cyclooctyne (DIFO) and bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN) derivatives are also available for the same application.\nAllow the strain-promoted cycloaddition reaction to proceed for 6 h at 37 °C. If a light-sensitive probe (e.g., Cy5.5) is used, cover the reaction vessel with aluminum foil.\nPurify the labeled HerFab according to step 5.\n5. Purification of Labeled HerFab\nAdd 500 µL of sample to a centrifugal filter spin column.\nCentrifuge the spin column at 14,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.\nDiscard flow-through and transfer purified sample from the spin column to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAs an alternative to step 5.1- 5.3, perform purification by dialysis against the same buffer.\nStore the purified labeled HerFab at 4 °C.\n6. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Labeled HerFab",
    "Add 5 µL LDS protein sample buffer containing 106 mM Tris·HCl, 141 mM Tris base (pH 8.5), 2% LDS, 10% Glycerol, 0.51 mM EDTA, 0.22 mM SERVA Blue G250, and 0.175 mM phenol red to 13 µL of purified labeled HerFab (7.8 µM or 0.38 mg/mL) in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 2 µL dithiothreitol (DTT, 100 mM final concentration). Incubate the mixture at 95 °C for 10 min.\nAttach the 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel cassette to the electrophoresis cell and add running buffer. Load the conjugated protein samples and the pre-stained molecular weight marker. Perform gel electrophoresis for 35 min at 200 V.\n\tNote: Keep the electrophoresis cell in the dark during the entire period to minimize photo-bleaching of the fluorophore.\nAfter electrophoresis, transfer the gel to a fluorescent gel scanner, and scan for fluorescence emission at the appropriate wavelength. For Cy5.5, use the Cy5 mode in the scanner software.\nStain the gel with a commercial protein stain.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
