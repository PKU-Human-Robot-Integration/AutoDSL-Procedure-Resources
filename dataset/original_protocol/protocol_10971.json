    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Rochester University Committee on Animal Resources. Mice were bred and maintained in the animal care facilities at the University of Rochester. To model high-risk MDS, the commercially available NHD13 murine model19 is employed. In this model, bone marrow stromal cells are analyzed in female NHD13 mice at 8 weeks of age, before disease onset. De novo AML is generated as previously described6,11,20. The oncogenes used to induce AML, such as MLL-AF9 and NRas, are tagged with GFP or YFP, allowing for the analysis of the non-leukemic GFP- bone marrow populations using flow cytometry. In brief, 10-week-old female C57BL/6J mice are transplanted with murine GFP/YFP+ AML cells, and the bone marrow is harvested 2 weeks post-transplant. While female mice are used in this study for demonstration purposes, this protocol can be conducted with either male or female mice. It can also be carried out using either one femur or all long bones.\n1. Bone marrow harvesting\nNOTE: For details on the animal dissection protocol, please refer to Amend et al.26.\nClean the mortar and pestle with 70% ethanol, rinse them with chilled FACS buffer (Table 1), and place them on ice to cool before starting the harvest. Also, place MACs buffer (Table 1) on the bench to allow it to reach room temperature.\nEuthanize the animal following the institutional animal care and use guidelines and protocols.",
    "On the benchtop, thoroughly spray the mouse with 70% ethanol until its fur is wet. Using forceps and curved scissors, lift the skin on the abdomen and make two incisions approximately 0.5 mm in length on both sides of the mouse, lateral from the abdomen. Next, make a 0.5 mm incision distal from the abdomen. Pull down to remove the skin and fur from the mouse's legs.\nPlace scissors perpendicular to the pelvis, press down while pulling up on the femur with forceps. The femoral head should detach from the pelvis. Separate the femur and tibia at the patellofemoral joint. Place the bones in FACS buffer in a 6-well plate on ice.\nRemove tissue from the bones using laboratory-grade tissue and place the cleaned bones into a new 6-well plate with fresh FACS buffer on ice.\nPlace all bones into the mortar with 2-5 mL of FACS buffer so that all bones are immersed in the buffer (adjust the volume of buffer based on how many bones you are processing). Crush and grind the bones using the pestle in a circular motion until the bone marrow tissue is released.\nUsing a 3 mL syringe, homogenize the bone marrow by pulling up and flushing down the liquid from the mortar.\nUsing a 3 mL syringe, pull up the liquid from the mortar and filter it through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL tube on ice. Rinse the bone/tissue chunks from the filter back into the mortar with FACS buffer and return to step 1.7 to homogenize and strain a second time. This constitutes the bone marrow fraction.",
    "Rinse the remaining bone pieces (spicules) back into the mortar with FACS buffer and flush them into a 15 mL tube using FACS buffer to ensure maximum cell yield. This is the bone spicules fraction.\n2. Digestion of bone marrow\nCentrifuge the bone marrow at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Decant and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the bone marrow in 2 mL of the bone marrow digestion mixture (Table 1) and transfer it to a 15 mL tube. Incubate at 37 °C for 45 min on a rotator.\nAdd 10 mL of FACS buffer to stop the enzymatic digestion. Filter the mixture through a 70 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube.\nPellet the mixture at 400 x g for 7 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the bone marrow pellet in 1 mL of RBC lysis buffer (see Table of Materials). Incubate for 4 min on ice.\nAdd 10 mL of FACS buffer to stop the lysis. Filter the mixture through a 70 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube.\nPellet the mixture at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of FACS buffer.\n3. Digestion of bone spicules\nVortex the bone spicules from step 1.9 and allow them to settle. Decant the supernatant and retain the bone at the bottom.\nResuspend the bone spicules in 1 mL of the bone spicule digestion mixture (Table 1).\nPlace the tubes on a tube rotator for 60 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of FACS buffer to stop the enzymatic digestion. Filter the mixture through a 70 µm cell strainer into the 50 mL tube containing RBC-lysed and digested bone marrow.\n4. Staining",
    "Gently mix the bone spicules and bone marrow cell suspension.\nUse 10 µL of the cell suspension to count the live cell number on a hemocytometer using 0.4% Trypan blue-based staining, as described in published protocols27. Collect 50,000 cells for an unstained control from the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the remaining cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend them in 100 µL of FACS buffer.\n\tNOTE: Antibodies can be titrated to determine the ideal dilution. Antibody selection (epitopes and fluorochromes) can be customized.\nFor staining with antibodies for magnetic depletion, add FC Block (1 µL per 25 x 106 cells), CD45-APC (10 µL per 25 x 106 cells), and Ter119-APC (4 µL per 25 x 106 cells) (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate on ice for 20 min. Wash with FACS buffer, remove 50,000 cells (~50 µL) for the APC-stained control, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspend in 100 µL of FACS buffer.\nFor staining of the cell suspension with microbeads for magnetic depletion, add mIgG (8 µL per 25 x 106 cells) and Anti-APC microbeads (20 µL per 25 x 106 cells) (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate on ice for 20 min. Wash with 10 mL FACS buffer, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n5. Depletion of sample by magnetic sorting\nNOTE: This step is carried out using a commercially available manual magnetic separator according to the manufacturer's instructions. This step can also be performed with an automated separator (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare the LD column by washing it with 2 mL of MACs buffer (Table 1). Discard the effluent and change the collection tube.",
    "Resuspend up to 1 x 108 cells in MACs buffer and filter them through a 5 mL test tube with a 35 µm cell strainer cap.\nPlace the LD column on the magnetic separator stand. Position a 5 mL test tube below the column to collect the eluate.\nAdd the cell suspension to the prepared LD column. Allow the negative fraction to flow through into the collection tube. Wash the column twice with 1 mL of MACs buffer, collecting the eluate in the same tube. This is the negative fraction used in step 5.6 below.\nRemove the LD column from the magnetic separator stand and place it on a new 5 mL test tube. Use a pipette to dispense 3 mL of buffer into the column to flush out cells that have been positively labeled, using the column plunger.\nCentrifuge the negative and positive fractions at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend them in 100 µL of FACS buffer.\nCount 10 µL of the negative and positive fractions with 0.4% Trypan blue. The volumes for the osteo-analysis/endothelial panel staining below will be based on this cell count.\nUse 50,000 live cells from the positive fraction for flow cytometry gating controls.\n6. Osteo-analysis/endothelial panel stain\nNOTE: Compensation should be performed following standard flow cytometry protocols, including all appropriate staining and gating controls.\nFor staining of the CD45/Ter119 negative fraction (1 µL of each antibody per 1 x 106 cells), add CD31-PE-Cy7, Sca-1-BV421, CD51-PE, and CD140a-PE-Cy5 (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate on ice for 20 min. Wash with 2 mL of FACS buffer, then centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Add 1 mL of FACS buffer and a 1:1000 dilution of PI for live/dead staining, then filter the sample through a 5 mL test tube with a 35 µm cell strainer cap.\nAnalyze the cells on a multi-color flow cytometer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
