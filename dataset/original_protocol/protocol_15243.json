    "1. Culture of Brain Tumor Tissue\nAdd 200 μl thawed Liberase (Roche Applied Science) to 15 ml of artificial CSF (aCSF- see Table 1) and place into 37 °C water bath. Liberase TM is a mix of proteolytic enzymes used to dissociate primary tissue samples, as well as cultured tumorspheres. Unlike Trypsin-EDTA, the Liberase method preserves the surface antigen CD133. For a tissue sample of about 0.5 cm3, we use 200 μl of Liberase. If the tissue is smaller, we use 100 ul.\nBring ammonium chloride solution (Stem cell technologies) to room temperature. Ammonium Chloride solution gently lyses red blood cells with minimal effect on other cells. It does not contain a fixative.\nIn sterile biological safety cabinet, add 5 ml of aCSF to specimen container, swirl to rinse tissue, then pipette off. This step helps to remove red blood cells (RBC).\nTransfer brain tumor tissue to a sterile 100 mm Petri dish.\nUsing fine scissors or scalpels and forceps, disaggregate tissue to slurry consistency.\nCollect sample using a 10 ml regular pipette or forceps and transfer fragments into the tube containing pre-warmed aCSF with Liberase.\nPlace on incubator-shaker (30 rpm) and set to 37 °C, for 15 min.\nFilter the tissue lysate through 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 ml Falcon tube.\nSpin the filtrate down at 280 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant carefully and evaluate size and colour of the resulting cell pellet: pellets which are pink or red indicate increasing numbers of red blood cells.\nResuspend pellet in 1 ml PBS.\nAdd an appropriate amount of ammonium chloride solution (4-12 ml) based on pellet size and red cell contamination (the ammonium chloride solution is very gentle and increased amounts are not harmful to cells other than red cells).",
    "Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nSpin cells down at 280 x g for 5 min.\nWash once with 10 ml of sterile PBS.\nResuspend in 5 ml NSC complete medium (Table 2) and transfer to an ultra-low binding 60 mm tissue culture plate (Corning). We use ultra-low binding culture plates with covalently bonded hydrogel surfaces that are hydrophilic and neutrally charged, to minimize cell attachment-mediated differentiation.\nFor the initial days in culture, do not change the media: top-up only with 1-2 ml media as needed, then continue to observe culture and change media when the color of the media becomes slightly yellow.\n2. Tumorsphere Dissociation for Flow Cytometry\nEvaluate tumorspheres under microscope: if the sphere size is >100 μm, dissociation is recommended as larger spheres may become necrotic in the center.\nTransfer culture to 15 ml conical tube.\nAdd 2-3 ml sterile PBS to rinse plate thoroughly and add to conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 280 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 1- 2 ml sterile PBS.\nAdd 10 μl Liberase.\nIncubate in 37 °C water bath for 3 min. Remove and visually evaluate suspension, if multiple clumps seen, triturate gently using a 1,000 μl pipette tip.\nIf clumping persists, continue incubation for an additional 1-2 min.\nWash the cells by adding 5 ml sterile PBS and centrifuging at 280 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 500-1,000 μl sterile PBS+2 mM EDTA.\nAssess cell number and viability using trypan blue.\nAdjust cell count to 1 million/ml in PBS+2 mM EDTA.\n3. Surface Staining\nTransfer 100 μl of 1x106/ml cell suspension per test to 12x75 mm flow tubes.\nAdd appropriate amount of antibodies. Matched Isotype controls should be used for each antibody (see Table 3).\nIncubate for 30 min on ice.",
    "Add 2 ml PBS+2 mM EDTA to each flow tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min, decant and blot.\nResuspend pellet in 300 μl PBS+2 mM EDTA.\nAdd 10 μl 7AAD viability dye to each tube and incubate for at least 15 min on ice.\nAnalyze by flow cytometry.\n4. Flow Cytometry Acquisition and Analysis\nThe specifics of acquisition and analysis of flow data are instrument-dependent. Representative negative samples are run and instrument settings established for Forward (size) and Side (granularity) scatter. This scatter pattern allows the end-user to view all cells in the sample, including debris. A region is usually drawn around the cells of interest. (Figure 4a) Settings are then established for all fluorescence detectors required to position the negative cells within the first decade of a fluorescence intensity plot. When more than one dye or fluorochrome is used, single stained controls must be run to establish color compensation values (subtraction of interfering fluorescence emissions). When running live cells, a viability dye such as 7-AAD (7-Amino-actinomycin D - excitation 488/emission 655) is used and a second region drawn to exclude dead cells (Figure 4b). Both of these regions are applied to any further analysis of the samples.\n5. Self-renewal Assay",
    "The key assay that is greatly facilitated by clonal sphere growth is the in vitro test of self-renewal capacity, the limiting dilution assay. Tumorspheres are dissociated and distributed at dilutions down to a single cell per well, and the rate of subsequent sphere formation over 7 days in culture is calculated. On day 7, the percentage of wells not containing spheres for each cell plating density (F0) is calculated and plotted against the number of cells per well (x). The number of cells required to form at least one tumorsphere in every well is determined from the point at which the line crosses the 0.37 level (F0 = e -x). In a Poisson distribution of cells, F0 = 0.37 corresponds to the dilution of one cell per well, so that this calculation (the 37% intersect) reflects the frequency of clonogenic stem cells in the whole cell population (Figure 5).\n6. Single Cell RT-PCR",
    "Single cells from different populations are sorted by Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP on reaction sites on an AmpliGrid slide (Beckman Coulter cat#AG480F). Single cell RT-PCR is performed using AmpliGrid Single One Step RT-PCR system (Beckman Coulter cat#OAX04515) according to manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, a single cell is deposited into each reaction site of an AmpliGrid slide; the presence of a single cell in each reaction site confirmed by microscopy. Reverse transcription (RT) is performed immediately after sorting to prevent the sample from being compromised. The RT master mix is prepared fresh, according to kit instructions (Table 4). We used 0.03 μl of 25 μM random primers (Promega) per reaction; 1 μl of master mix is added to the centre of each reaction site. This is immediately coated with 5 μl of sealing solution (Beckman Coulter cat#OAX04503). Using an AmpliSpeed slide cycler (Beckman Coulter; cat#OAX04101), slides are incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 10 min, and 55 °C for 45 min. After reverse transcription, 3 μl of DNase/RNase-free water is added to each reaction site, and the entire mixture transferred to a PCR tube (1 tube/site). In a PCR plate, a reaction volume of 10 μl is used for quantitative PCR: 8 μl qPCR master mix (5 μl Sybr Green (Quanta), 1 μl water, 1 μl of 10 μM forward and reverse primer mix) plus 2 μl of the RT mixture. For real-time quantification, samples are run on a BioRad cycler using the following program: 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 60 °C for 60 sec, 72 °C for 60 sec, followed by 10 min at 72 °C and melting curve analysis. Ct values were determined using Opticon Monitor 3 (BioRad).",
    "Three genes can be assessed per cell, including GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. Gene expression is normalized to GAPDH expression, according to 2-ΔCt. At least a dozen single cells of the same population from the same sort can be used as biological replicates to compensate for lack of technical replicates.",
    "7. Representative Results\nFigure 1 shows a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of a representative patient with a GBM. Brain tumor samples are obtained from consenting patients immediately after surgery, as approved by the Hamilton Health Sciences/McMaster Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. A part of each specimen is given to the neuropathologist for routine clinical diagnosis. The remaining sample is processed as shown in Figure 2. The tumor cells, once plated in complete neural stem cell media with growth factors, form tumorspheres as shown in Figure 3.\nThe tumor cells are labeled with neural surface stem cell markers CD133 and CD15 and analyzed by flow cytometry as shown in Figure 4.\nSingle cells from different populations for e.g., CD15+/CD133+, CD15+/CD133-, CD15-/CD133+, CD15-/CD133- are then sorted into 96 well plates (Figure 5a) or into AmpliGrid slides (Figure 6a).\nIn the 96 well plate, single cells which possess self-renewal capacity (e.g. CD133+ cells), (Figure 5b), can form tumorspheres (Figure 5c) following incubation. A self-renewal graph can be plotted (Figure 5d) by counting the number of spheres formed per well. Single cells sorted into the reaction site of the Ampligrid slide (Figure 6a). The RNA extracted from single cells can be reverse transcribed using the Advalytix AmpliSpeed (Figure 6b). The cDNA obtained is used to perform Real time RT-PCR (Figure 6c).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4111/4111fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of a patient GBM.
