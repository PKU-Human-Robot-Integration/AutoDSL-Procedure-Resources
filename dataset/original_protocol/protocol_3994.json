    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInduction of type I diabetes mellitus in rabbit\nTiming: 4 weeks\nA careful adherence to the following procedure results in the classical symptoms of reliable type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in rabbit with consistent elevated blood sugar levels of 220 mg/dL for up to 8 weeks (Samidurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nBody weight and blood glucose level were monitored before the induction of diabetes.\nRabbits were fasted 12 h before the procedure and supplemented with drinking water.\nThe rabbits were lightly sedated by intramuscular (i.m. in Biceps femoris muscle) administration of Ketamine (35 mg/kg), Xylazine (5 mg/kg) and Atropine (5 mg/kg) (as a cocktail).\nNote: It is advisable to start the procedure early in the morning around 8–9 AM, so that the animal health can be monitored throughout the day.\nAlloxan monohydrate (10 mL; 50 mg/mL) was freshly prepared by dissolving in sterile saline right before its administration and kept on ice all the time.\nThis solution was aspired in 10 cc syringe and loaded on microprocessor multiple syringe infusion/withdrawal pump unit (Harvard apparatus, Model series ‘22’ Infuse/withdraw, Male Luer Lock, Cat # MA1 55–2226) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The syringe was connected to standard 6-inch bore extension tube with pinch Clamp. Rabbit was infused with appropriate volume of alloxan monohydrate, according to the body weight of the animal, to achieve final concentration 125 mg/kg.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Induction of type I diabetes in rabbit\n(A) Cannulation of the marginal ear vein with a catheter.\n(B) Securing the cannulation by taping to the earlobe using surgical tape.\n(C) Infusion of alloxan monohydride with adjusted flow rate through the pump (Harvard Apparatus, Model ‘22’ Syringe Pump MA1 55–2222 -constant pressure dispensing system).",
    "The ear was cleaned with sterile alcohol pads and the ear vein was cannulated with a 24G X ¾ inch Safelet IV catheter and connected to standard bore extension set with pinch clamp, Male Luer Lock. The catheter was safely secured by taping to the earlobe using surgical tape (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nThe infusion flow rate of alloxan monohydrate was adjusted through the pump to deliver it slowly for a duration of 10 min. Volume was adjusted with body weight of the rabbit. Example: For a rabbit weighing 3.2 kg, 8 mL of alloxan (125 mg/kg X 3.2 kg, i.e., total 400 mg of aloxan; stock concentration; 50 mg/mL) will be administered, average flow rate 0.8 mL/min through the pump (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nThe animal was transferred to recovery cage and blood glucose level was monitored using Contour glucose meter (Bayer, NJ, USA) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post-alloxan injection to prevent hypoglycemic shock.\nNote: We use 26G X 3/8 needle to pierce the small vein in the earlobe for blood sugar measurement using a glucose monitor meter.\nWhen the blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dL, animals were supplemented with 5% dextrose (10 mL, i.m.).\nNote: In our experiments we observed the blood sugar level starts decreasing to 70 mg/dL around 3.5–4 h after alloxan administration.\nAfter 4 h of alloxan treatment, the animals were transported back to the vivarium with normal food and 20% glucose in drinking water for next 3 days.\nThe health of the animals and blood sugar were checked further after 10–12 h of alloxan administration, if again blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dL, 5% dextrose was administered (i.m.) at 10–12 h of post alloxan infusion.",
    "The animals were maintained for 4 weeks and during this time blood sugar was measured twice (morning/evening) every day. When blood glucose level exceeded 450 mg/dL, rabbits were injected (i.m.) insulin (Novolin-R, Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Inc. Princeton, NJ). For example, rabbits with blood glucose level (BGL) 400–500 mg/dL received 1–2 U/kg of insulin; BGL 500–600 mg/dl received 3 U/kg, and BGL > 600 mg/dl received 4 U/kg.\nImplantation of balloon occluder\nTiming: 1 h\nThe balloon occluder was implanted on top of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) of the diabetic rabbit before conducting myocardial I/R injury.\nThe rabbits were anesthetized by intramuscular (i.m.) administration of ketamine (35 mg/kg), Xylazine (5 mg/kg) and Atropine (5 mg/kg).\nThe appropriate surgical area from the sternum to left shoulder blade of rabbits were shaved using handheld vacuum assisted hair removal system (Clipper Vac -MDC-Romani Inc.).\nRabbits were intubated with an endotracheal tube, and mechanically ventilated with oxygen enriched air (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The ventilation rate was maintained between 28–30 breaths per minute.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pre-surgical preparation of rabbit for implantation of balloon occlude\n(A) Rabbits were intubated with an endotracheal tube to mechanically ventilated with oxygen enriched air.\n(B) Betadine was applied to the surgical area.\nAll rabbits were given Buprenorphine SR LAB (0.1 mg/kg, i.m.) prior to surgery.\nGentamicin was also administered before surgery and on the first and second postoperative days (0.7 mg/kg; i.m.; each day).\nBody temperature was monitored continuously during the procedure with a rectal probe attached to a thermocouple (TRACEABLE Digital Thermometer, VWR). A heating blanket (K&H Lectro-KennelTM heated Pad & Cover) was used to maintain body temperature between 36°C–39°C.",
    "Betadine was applied with sterile gauze to the surgical area and allowed to dry (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). A sterile, adhesive drape (3M) was used as a barrier on the surgical site.\nUnder sterile conditions, a left thoracotomy in the fourth intercostal space was performed (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5D) to expose the heart (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). Then the pericardium was opened and LAD was identified (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F–5I). A 4-0 taper-needled silk suture was passed beneath a major branch of the left coronary artery, perpendicular to the vessel (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]J and 5K).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Sequential images of implantation of balloon occluder\n(A–C) Surgical incision in the chest.\n(D) Thoracotomy.\n(E) Exposure of heart after thoracotomy.\n(F–I) Opening of the pericardial sac to access the LAD (left anterior descending artery).\n(J and K) Placing suture around LAD.\n(L–N) Implantation of Balloon Occluder.\n(O and P) brief inflation of the balloon occluder to confirm the blanching of the distal myocardium.\n(Q and R) Suturing of inner muscle.\n(S) Completion of muscle suture.\n(T–W) Tunneling balloon occluder under the skin layer between shoulder blades.\n(X) Suturing outer skin layer.\n(Y) Application of antiseptic in the incision area.\nTo estimate a risk area of nearly 25%, the suture was slightly lifted against a cotton-tip applicator to briefly test the coronary occlusion (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]J).\nA balloon occluder (using Tygon tubing) attached with the aluminum sheet [0.2–0.3 mm thick] was placed on top of the coronary artery and secured with the 4-0 silk suture on the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]L–5N)",
    "Critical: (a) Careful placement of the balloon is critical for a later successful conscious ischemia induction, i.e. the suture knot should not be too tight (which would cause blood flow restriction after balloon deflation) or too loose (which would fail to induce complete coronary occlusion during balloon inflation). (b) Proper function of the occluder should be confirmed by the appearance of cyanosis (bluish or grayish color) of the distal myocardium upon brief inflation of the balloon (10 s) and hyperemia after deflation (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]O and 5P).\nLungs were inflated using an Ambu bag (Spur II Pediatric Resuscitation bag, Ambu®).\nThe surgical incision in the chest was closed according to the standard procedures. Briefly, pericardium was closed using 4-0 silk suture, rib was closed using 0 Perma-HandTM silk suture, muscle and skin were closed with 3-0 monofilament suture (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]Q–5Y). Only a few millimeters of the incision was left accessible for catheter retrieval.\nThe occluder tubing was then tunneled under the skin, and exteriorized through a small incision between the scapulae (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]T–5W).\nPrior to closing the chest, a sterile chest tube was placed to remove fluid and air to avoid a pneumothorax (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]X and 5Y).\nTriple-antibiotic (Neosporin) ointment was applied after the surgery (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]Y).\nRabbit was extubated after waking from anesthesia by checking their eyeball movement to light and diaphragm movement for abdominal breathing. Then rabbit was transferred to the recovery unit (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) and continuously monitored until they awake. The average time taken by animals to awake is 1 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Recovery Unit with automated temperature control\nAfter post-operative recovery (when animal was fully awoken, i.e., when they could stand on their legs and start moving without imbalance), the rabbit was transported back to the vivarium with normal food and drinking water.",
    "Necessary measurements were taken to ensure that the animals could not get access or pull the catheter at the exit site. These include minimizing the incision size between the shoulder blades, periodic close monitoring, at least 2 times a day and the use of protective neck collar (in order to make it least accessible).\nConscious I/R injury\nTiming: 3 days\nMyocardial I/R injury was conducted under sedation to avoid the confounding effects of anesthetics as well as the postsurgical complications of acute opening and closing of the chest for performing coronary artery occlusions.\nSeven days after successful implantation of balloon occluder, rabbits were prepared for performing I/R protocol.\nThroughout the coronary occlusion-reperfusion sequence, rabbits were kept in a cage (in a restrainer to control movement) in a quiet and dimly lit room (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Myocardial ischemia in conscious diabetic rabbit\n(A) Picture of conscious diabetic rabbit during myocardial ischemia by inflating the hydraulic balloon occluder.\n(B) A transducer sensor probe was secured to arterial line of the ear connected to Blood Pressure Analyzer during conscious ischemia/reperfusion\nTo alleviate discomfort, rabbits received ketoprofen (3.0 mg/kg; i.m.) and diazepam (4 mg/kg; i.m.) separately 2 h before inflating the balloon for inducing ischemia.\nThe ear was cleaned with sterile ethanol pads. A venous line was established by placing a 24-gauge angiocatheter on a marginal ear vein to draw blood samples and administer drugs. Under local anesthesia (Lidocaine Hydrochloride Jelly USP, 2%), the ear dorsal artery was cannulated with a 24-gauge angiocatheter to monitor arterial pressure (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nUnder sedation, rabbits were subjected to a 45-min coronary artery occlusion (to induce 45 min of ischemia) by inflating the pre-implanted hydraulic balloon occluder. After 45 min of ischemia, the hydraulic balloon was deflated to allow reperfusion for 3 days.",
    "Note: Vital cardiac parameters including mean arterial pressure, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and heart rate were monitored throughout the conscious I/R procedure via a transducer sensor probe secured to arterial line of the ear connected to Blood Pressure Analyzer (BPA, Digi-Med, KY USA).\nBlood sample (0.5 mL) was collected in heparinized tube (BD-vacutainer- Gel- blood collection tubes - Becton, Dickinson and Company) at base line and at 1, 2, 4 and 24 h of reperfusion. Blood in the tube was centrifuged to separate plasma using Thermo Scientific Sorvall Legend XTR centrifuge at 2000g for 10 min under refrigerated condition (4°C). The plasma was stored at -20°C to measure cardiac troponin (cTnI).\nRabbit was transferred to the recovery unit and continuously monitored until they awoke (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The rabbit was closely monitored to ensure adequate breathing and to prevent hypothermia and dehydration. If animal will encounter severe breathing problem, it will be again intubated and mechanically ventilated with oxygen enriched air. Visual signs of dehydration are not easy to detect during the course of surgery under anesthesia. After completion of ischemia, the rabbit was monitored for dehydration by checking symptoms such as the sticky saliva, crusty eyes or dark color urine. To avoid dehydration and compensate the blood loss/withdrawal, saline (5 mL/h) was injected intravenously during surgery and post-op recovery period. Animal was provided with unrestricted supply of drinking water in recovery chamber as well as vivarium.\nWhen animal was fully awoken, i.e., when they could stand on their legs and start moving without imbalance, the rabbit was transported back to the vivarium with normal food and drinking water.\nReperfusion therapy with Rapamycin",
    "In the sedated rabbit, undergoing 45 min of ischemia (through inflation of balloon occluder) and 5 min before the onset of reperfusion (deflation of the balloon occluder), Rapamycin (0.25 mg/kg, in 1 mL of saline) was slowly infused for 10 min intravenously through marginal ear vein.\nAssessment of cardiac function by echocardiography\nTiming: 2 h\nCardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography in the diabetic rabbits following myocardial I/R injury.\nThe rabbits were sedated with inhalation of isoflurane (2.5%) and echocardiographic measurements were performed using a Vevo2100TM (VisualSonics Inc., Toronto, Canada) at different time points, including before (baseline) and after alloxan treatment, after balloon implantation, and 3 days post I/R as per the protocol.\nTwo operators, blinded to rabbit cohort allocation, performed repeated rounds of echocardiography to minimize inter- and intra-observer variations.\nRabbit was lightly sedated in anesthesia chambers supplied with mixture of oxygen and isoflurane 4.0% (VETLAND-EX3000-Veterinary Anesthesia System).\nRabbit was placed on the table in left lateral recumbent position (shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) and supplied with isoflurane (2.5%–3.5%) through small canine mask (SurgiVet, Smiths Medical, 32393B4) to keep them sedated during the echocardiography acquisition process.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Cardiac function was assessed with echocardiography\n(A) Chest hair was removed in rabbit while anesthetized with isoflurane.\n(B) Cardiac function was measured by placing the MS201 probe on the parasternal view.\n(C) Cardiac left ventricle (LV) function was measured by two-dimensional ultrasound B-Mode (Short Axis) as well as M-Mode.\nChest hairs were removed using handheld vacuum assisted hair removal system (Clipper Vac). The remaining hairs were removed by applying hair removal cream/gel (Veet -Gel Cream hair remover) to the chest region and using 4×4 non-sterile non-woven gauze (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nPrewarmed ultrasound gel (Aquasonic CLEAR -Ultrasound Gel, Parker Laboratories) was applied to the chest, primarily in the area overlying the heart.",
    "Note: Additional precautions are taken to avoid air bubbles in the gel, which can interfere with ultrasonic imaging. Generally, a 60cc syringe, filled with ultrasound gel, was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000g to remove air bubbles.\nCardiac left ventricle (LV) function was measured by two-dimensional ultrasound B-Mode (Short Axis) as well as M-Mode by placing the MS201 probe on the Parasternal view to access the LV anterior (AW) and posterior (PW) walls, the intraventricular septal wall (SW), and lateral wall (LW) (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B and 8C). The diameter of the LV lumen was measured as LV internal diameter (LVID).\nThe LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and stroke volumes (SV) were calculated by tracing the end- and epicardial boarder during contraction (Torrado et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). The obtained images were analyzed using Vevo LAB 3.2.0 software.\nInfarct size measurement\nTiming: 6 h\nAfter myocardial I/R injury, histological measurement of the infarcted area in tissue sections of the LV is a standard approach to determine the extent of cardiac damage.\nAfter completion of I/R protocol and echocardiography, the rabbits were anesthetized by administration (i.m.) of ketamine (35 mg/kg), Xylazine (5 mg/kg) and Atropine (5 mg/kg) (as a cocktail).\nThe ear was cleaned with sterile ethanol pads and heparin (500 U/kg) was infused through the ear vein.\nThereafter, the rabbits were euthanized by administration of saturated potassium chloride (10 mEq/10 mL) via catheter connected to ear auricular artery.",
    "After excision, the heart was mounted through the aortic root on a 60 c.c. syringe and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (∼30 mL, 37°C) to remove all of the blood (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A). The balloon occluder was removed. Using a 4-O suture, a double knot is tied around the coronary artery at the same location where the balloon occluder was placed. Thereafter, a 5% solution of phthalo blue dye in normal saline (∼10 mL over 3 min) was infused through the aortic root.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Infarct size measurement\n(A) Perfusion of heart with Krebs-Henseleit buffer to wash out most of the blood and infusion of Phthalo blue dye for demarcation of risk and non-risk area.\n(B) Image of heart section to measure infarct size.\nThe heart was cut into 5–6 transverse slices (∼2-mm-thick/slice) using tissue slicer blades, which were stained with 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min at 37°C.\nThe heart slices were then fixed in 10% formalin for 4 h.\nThe atrial and RV (right ventricle) tissues were removed. The LV slices were numbered from apex to base as 1 through 5/6 and photographed on both sides of the slices with a ruler (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nUsing image J software (Bethesda, NIH, USA), the area of total LV, red region (viable tissue within the ischemic zone, TTC positive region), blue tissue (non-ischemic myocardium, phthalo blue positive region) and white region (necrotic area, TTC negative region) were measured (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B). The region at risk was expressed in a percentage of the LV and the infarct was calculated as percentage of the risk area (Samidurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCardiac troponin I measurement\nTiming: 5 h",
    "Cardiac troponin I is the established biomarker of cardiac injury, which is released into the circulation in response to cardiomyocyte damage following I/R injury.\nCardiac troponin I (cTnI) was measured in the plasma samples using Ultra-Sensitive Rabbit Cardiac Troponin-I ELISA kit (Life Diagnostics Inc, USA, Cat. No. CTNI-10-US) (Jones et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Samidurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Torrado et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Each assay was performed in duplicate in a blinded fashion.\nBriefly, the plasma samples were diluted 10× with cTnI diluent before measuring cTnI.\nStandards of cTnI (1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.156, 0.078, 0.039 and 0.019 ng/mL) were prepared from the cTnI stock by serial diluting according to the instructions provided in the kit.\nThe standards and diluted plasma samples (200 μL) were dispensed into the wells of ELISA plate (standards and samples were run in duplicate).\nThe plate was incubated for 2 h at 25°C on a plate shaker at 150 rpm.\nAfter the completion of incubation, the solutions were discarded from the wells of the plate and the wells were washed five times with 1× wash solution (400 μL/well/each time).\nAfter removing all residual droplets, 100 μL of diluent was added to each well. Then 100 μL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate was added to each well.\nThe plate was incubated at 25°C for one hour on a plate shaker at 150 rpm.\nAfter the completion of incubation, the solutions were discarded and the wells were washed five times with 1× wash solution (400 μL/well/each time).\nAll residual droplets were removed by tapping the plate on clean paper towels.\nTMB (3,3′, 5,5”-tetramethylbenzidine; 100 μL) was dispensed into each well.\nThe plate was incubated at 25°C for 20 min on a plate shaker at 150 rpm.",
    "After 20-min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μL of Stop solution to each well. The blue color should be changed to yellow.\nThen, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a plate reader within 5 min.\nA standard curve was prepared by plotting absorbance values of the standards versus log10 of the concentration.\nThe concentration of the samples were determined using this standard curve, with multiply by 10 (dilution factor).\nEvaluation of cardiac apoptosis\nTiming: 5 days\nApoptosis, a programed cell death, plays a vital role during the myocardial I/R injury. Post-I/R myocardial apoptosis was assessed by measuring DNA fragmentation using a Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick end Labeling (TUNEL) kit.\nThe risk area of the LV after 72 h of reperfusion was dissected and fixed in 10% formalin (at least 1 day) after thorough washing with PBS.\nThe 5 μm thick tissue sections (transverse cross section of myocardium) were prepared after paraffin embedding.\nThe sections were stained using a Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick end Labeling (TUNEL) kit (ApoAlertTM DNA Fragmentation assay Kit, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, Cat no. 630108) according to the instruction provided by the company.\nThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections in slides were deparaffinized using xylene and dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol (96%, 90% and 80%). Thereafter, the sections were rehydrated in distilled water.\nThe slides with tissue sections were microwaved (high power) for 10 min in 1× Citrate Buffer (pH 6.0, prepared from 10× Citrate Buffer, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat no. C9999-1000mL) and cooled down slowly at 20°C–22°C.\nTissue sections were incubated for 1 h with the equilibration buffer (45 μL), nucleotide mix (5 μL) and TdT enzyme (1 μL) provided by TUNEL kit, under dark in humidified 37°C incubator.",
    "The slides were washed with PBS three times (5 min per wash) and the tissue sections were incubated with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nTissue sections were incubated 16 h at 4°C with troponin antibody (mouse Troponin T antibody, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. St. Louis, MO, USA).\nNext day, after washing three times with PBS (5 min/each time of washing), the tissue sections were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (H+L), F(ab')2 Fragment (Alexa Fluor® 594 Conjugate, Cell Signaling, MA, USA), and fixed with DAPI anti-fade mount solution (Vectashield Mounting Medium for Fluorescence with DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Cat no. H-1200).\nThe apoptotic cells (with green nuclei) and total cells (with DAPI-blue nuclei) were counted under a fluorescence microscope (Confocal microscope (Nikon D-Eclipse C1, Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]), and the data was plotted as the percentage of apoptotic cells to total cells (Figures 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]A and 15B). Co-localization of green nuclei with troponin staining in the cells (with red striation) confirmed the cardiomyocyte apoptosis in myocardium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/958-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.
