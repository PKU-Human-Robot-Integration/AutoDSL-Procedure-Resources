    "This study was approved by the ethics committee at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (reference number 20160014). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1996). Four adult male rats (weight 250-280 g) were used in this study. All animals were housed in a 12 h light/dark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity, and allowed free access to food and water. The instruments and materials used in the present study were showed in Figure 1.  Before the surgery, all instruments, such as stereotaxic frame and glass pipette, were cleaned using 70% ethanol.\n1. Surgical Procedures\nDetermine the coordinate area of interest in VPM using a stereotaxic atlas9 (Figure 2A).\nPrepare a 1 µL micro-syringe equipped with a glass micropipette (with a tip diameter of approximately 10-20 µm) (Figure 1D) and test it with liquid paraffin.\nAnesthetize the rats with 7% chloral hydrate (0.7 mL/100 g) by intraperitoneal injection.\nOnce deep anesthesia is confirmed with tail pinch and pedal withdrawal reflex, shave the top of the animal's head with an electric razor and scrub the surgical site 3 times with 10% povidone iodine followed by 70% ethanol respectively.\nPlace the rat into the stereotaxic device by placing blunt ear bars into the ears and place the rat's upper incisors into the mouth holder (Figure 1E), and then apply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes.\nClean the head skin of the surgical site again using 70% ethanol. Use sterile surgical gloves and towels to maintain the surgery under the sterile conditions.\nMake a sagittal incision in the skin with a scalpel along the sagittal suture (Figure 1F).",
    "Scrape the muscle and periosteum away from the skull using sterile cotton-tipped applicators throughout the surgery to control bleeding (Figure 1F).\nUsing predefined coordinates from an atlas (Figure 2A), determine the location (-3.3 mm Bregma point, 2.6 mm right to midline) of craniotomy (Figure 1G).\nPerform a craniotomy using a burr drill with a round-tip bit (#106) (Figure 1H), and continue drilling to about a 1 mm depth within a few minutes until reaching the meninges (Figure 1I).\nExcise the dura mater using microforceps to expose the cerebral cortex over the injection site (Figure 1I).\nChange liquid paraffin in the micro-syringe with 10% BDA (10,000 molecular weight, in distilled water) solution (Figure 1J).\nMount the syringe into the microinjection apparatus and connect with a micro-pump (Figure 1K).\n\tNOTE: The volume injected is dependent on the speed of the micro-pump. Here it was adjusted to 30 nL/min (Figure 1L).\nUnder a stereomicroscope, insert a glass micropipette manually with the microinjection apparatus into the VPM through the cortical surface of the brain at the depth of 5.8 mm (Figure 1M).\nPressure-inject a 100 nL of 10% BDA into the VPM over a period of 3 min (35 nL/min) with a micro-pump (Figure 1L, M).\nAfter injection, keep the pipette in place for an additional 5 min and then withdraw slowly.\nSuture the wound with sterile thread (Figure 1N). Follow your local animal care committee guidelines for pre- and post-surgical analgesia. \nPlace the rat in a warm recovery area until it regains consciousness and is fully recovered. \nReturn the recovered rat back to its cage.\n2. Perfusions and Sections\nAfter a survival time of typically 10 days, inject the animal with an overdose of 10% urethane (2 mL/100 g) by intraperitoneal injection to induce euthanasia.",
    "Perfuse the experimental rats in the hood (Figure 1O).\n\t\nOnce the breath stops, using scissors and forceps, open the thoracic cavity of the rat to access the heart. Insert an intravenous catheter into the left ventricle toward the aorta, and then open the right auricle.\nFirst perfuse with 0.9% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at physiological temperature (37 °C) about 1-2 min until the blood exiting from the heart is clear, and then continue with 250-300 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4).\nAfter the perfusion, incise the head skin and open the skull, and then dissect out the rat brain. Post-fix the dissected brain in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature (26 °C), then cryoprotect in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 days at 4 °C until the brain is immersed in the solution (Figure 1P).\nOnce the brain is immersed in the solution, divide the brain into three blocks in the coronal direction on the brain matrices (Figure 1Q). The central block contains the VPM and S1.\nCut the central block of the brain at 40 µm on a freezing stage sliding microtome system in the coronal direction. Collect these sections orderly in a 6-well dish with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) (Figures 1R, S).\n3. Standard ABC Staining\nNOTE: Free floating sections from every third coronal section of the brain were used for visualizing the BDA labeling with standard ABC procedure10.\nRinse the sections in 0.1 M PBS for about 1 min.\nIncubate the sections in 1% ABC solution in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash the sections three times in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4).",
    "Stain the sections in a solution containing 0.02% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and 0.01% H2O2 in 50 mM Tris buffer for about 2-5 min at room temperature.\nWash the sections three times in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4).\nMount the sections on microscope slides using standard histochemical techniques (Figure 1T; see Supplemental Video File III, perfusion and sections).\nDry the sections in the air overnight at room temperature.\nDehydrate the sections briefly in a series of alcohol (50%, 70%, 95%, 100%) solutions. Submerge the slides in each solution for about 15 s. Do not allow the slides to dry out between each step.\nClear the sections in xylene three times, about 20 min.\nPut 2 or 3 drops of balsam on the slices then place coverslips on the sections.\n4. Double Fluorescent Staining for BDA and Basic Neural Elements in Cerebral Cortex\nNOTE: In contrast, double fluorescent staining was carried out for observing the correlation of BDA labeling and basic neural elements on the adjacent sections to the above used with streptavidin-AF594 and counterstained with fluorescent Nissl stain AF500/525.\nRinse the sections in 0.1 M PBS for about 1 min.\nIncubate the sections in a mixed solution of streptavidin-AF594 (1:500) and AF500/525 green fluorescent Nissl stain (1:1,000) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature.\nWash the sections three times in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4).\nMount the sections on microscope slides using standard histochemical techniques. Dry the sections in the air for about 1 h.\nApply coverslips to the fluorescent sections with 50% glycerin in distilled water before observation.\n5. Double Fluorescent Staining for BDA and Interneurons in Cerebral Cortex",
    "NOTE: Double fluorescent staining was carried out for observing the correlation of BDA labeling and interneurons on the representative sections in the cortical target with streptavidin-AF594 and PV-immunochemistry.\nRinse the representative sections in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for about 1 min.\nIncubate the sections in a blocking solution containing 3% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min.\nTransfer the sections into a solution of mouse monoclonal anti-PV IgG (1:1,000) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for overnight at 4 °C.\nOn the following day, wash the sections three times in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4).\nExpose the sections to a mixed solution of goat anti-mouse-AF488 secondary antibody (1:500), streptavidin-AF594 (1:500), and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1:40,000) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h.\nRepeat steps 4.3 to 4.5.\n6. Observation\nTake images of the VPM, thalamocortical axons, and corticothalamic neurons.\n\t\nObserve the fluorescent samples with a confocal imaging system equipped with objectives lenses (4x, NA: 0.13; 10x, NA: 0.40; and 40x, NA: 0.95). Use excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 (blue), 488 (green) and 559 (red) nm.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the confocal pinhole is 152 µm (4x, 10x) and 105 µm (40x).The spatial resolution of image capture is 1024 × 1024 pixel (4x, 10x) and 640 × 640 pixel (40x).\nTake twenty images in successive frames of 2 µm from each section at the thickness of 40 µm (Z series).\nIntegrate the images into a single in-focus image with the confocal image processing software system for three-dimensional analyzing as follows: set start focal plane → set end focal plane → set step size → choose depth pattern → image capture → Z series.",
