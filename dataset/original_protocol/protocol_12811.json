  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation\nPrepare 2% agarose gel using distilled water (DW) as the solvent in a 90-mm plastic culture dish, and 10 mL of a 1% penicillin/streptomycin cocktail with DW. The gel can be stored for 2 - 3 weeks in an incubator set at 18 °C.\n\tNOTE: Avoid any storage of the gel below 10 °C, for the low temperature will shrink the agarose gel, resulting in a minuscule gap between the gel and the culture dish wall in which the tardigrades can be trapped.\n2. Sample Preparation and Contaminant Exclusion\nCollect a single tardigrade, place it on the prepared agar plate, and wash it 2x - 3x with DW to remove any remaining particles.\nIncubate the tardigrade at 18 - 22 °C for 24 h to remove any excess food from the intestines.\nPlace the starved tardigrade in penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics for 2 - 6 h to remove any bacterial contamination and place the decontaminated animal on a clean slide glass using a P10 pipette.\nObserve the tardigrade under a microscope at 500X magnification and confirm that there are no remaining bacteria.\n\tNOTE: The high magnification with a stereomicroscope is optimal, but an optical microscope may be used alternatively without applying a coverslip.\nCollect the individual using a P10 pipette with a maximum of 5 µL of liquid, place it into a low-binding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tube, and remove as much excess liquid as possible.\n\tNOTE: The microtubes, PCR tubes, and pipette tips should all be low binding to minimize the loss of DNA.\n\tNOTE: Conduct a homogenization as soon as possible, for the rapid desiccation or death of the animal can significantly damage the genomic DNA.\n3. Homogenization and DNA Extraction\nHomogenize the animal to obtain its genomic DNA (gDNA) with one of the following methods.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to use the specified kit shown in the Table of Materials in the following DNA extraction steps, for other kits (either column and bead based) are not effective at this extremely low input. The genomic lysis buffer has been supplied with 0.5% beta-mercaptoethanol prior to use.\n\t\nHomogenize the animal with freeze-and-thaw cycles18.\n\t\t\nImmediately following step 2.5, add 100 µL of lysis buffer to the PCR tube containing the tardigrade.\nPlace the PCR tube in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and, for 10 min, move it to a heat block warmed to 37 °C. Repeat this step 2x.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step can be repeated when the homogenization is not sufficient or can be performed after the manual crushing.\nManually crush the animal.\n\t\t\nImmediately following step 2.5, under a stereomicroscope, crush the individual with the P10 tip of the pipette by pressing the animal against the PCR tube wall, and immediately add 100 µL of lysis buffer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is critical to observe this procedure under a stereomicroscope, because the tardigrade can easily slip away, and inefficient crushing will result in a failure to extract gDNA. Make sure that the tardigrade cuticle is broken so that the lysis buffer can infiltrate the organism.\nIncubate the tube for 30 min at room temperature for lysis to occur.\n\tNOTE: A minimum of 30 min is required for an efficient lysis, but the incubation can be longer.\nTransfer the complete volume (100 µL) of the lysis mixture to a clean 1.5-mL low-binding microtube.\nAdd 100 µL of lysis buffer to the low-binding PCR tube that was used for the homogenization and is now empty, and after pipetting the mixture, transfer it to the 1.5-mL low-binding microtube used in step 3.3. Repeat this step 2x.",
    "As in step 3.4, add 300 µL of lysis buffer to the low-binding PCR tube, and, after pipetting, move the mixture to the 1.5-mL low-binding microtube. The 1.5-mL low-binding microtube should contain 600 µL of the mixture after this step.\n\tNOTE: These steps are to minimize the loss of gDNA bound to the PCR tube wall, by washing the sample multiple times.\nAdd the total of 600 µL of lysis mixture to the spin column placed in a collection tube and centrifuge it at 10,000 x g for 1 min.\nRe-apply the flow through to the column and centrifuge it at 10,000 x g for 1 min.\n\tNOTE: This step is critical to ensure that most of the gDNA is bound to the column.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer to the spin column and centrifuge it at 10,000 x g for 1 min. Transfer the spin column to a clean 1.5-mL microtube.\nApply 20 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, to the spin column, wait for 5 min at room temperature, and centrifuge it at 10,000 x g for 1 min.\n\tNOTE: The elution buffer must not contain EDTA, for it interferes with the library preparation enzymes.\nRe-apply the flow through the spin column, and after 5 min of incubation at room temperature, centrifuge it for 1 min at 10,000 x g.\n\tNOTE: This step is critical to ensure the maximal elution of the gDNA bound to the column.\n4. Library Construction Sequence\nDNA fragmentation\nTransfer 15 µL of the gDNA eluant to a 15-µL microtube for DNA fragmentation and centrifuge the tube for 1 min using a tabletop microcentrifuge.",
    "NOTE: The specified microtube shown in the Table of Materials is optimal for a low input. The fragmentation with low-volume sonication is critical, and this cannot be substituted with enzymatic fragmentation because of the extremely low concentration of DNA.\nFragment the gDNA to 550 bp.\n\t\tNOTE: The 550 bp settings we used are as follows: peak incident power = 30 W, duty factor = 20%, cycles per burst = 50, treatment time = 23 s.\nAfter a thorough pipetting, transfer 10 µL of the fragmented DNA mixture to a clean low-binding PCR tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be stopped here. Preserve the DNA at 4 °C or -20 °C.\nLibrary construction sequence\n\tNOTE: It is absolutely critical to use the specified kit in the Table of Materials in the following procedures, due to the low amount of input DNA.\n\t\nAdd 2 µL of the template preparation buffer and 1 µL of the template preparation enzyme and mix them thoroughly with a pipette.\nPerform the template preparation reaction on a thermal cycler with the following conditions: 22 °C for 25 min, 55 °C for 20 min, 4 °C hold, and a heated lid at 101 - 105 °C. Once the reaction is completed, proceed to the next step.\nAdd 1 µL of the library synthesis buffer and 1 µL of the library synthesis enzyme to the template preparation reaction product and incubate the mixture at 22 °C for 40 min (with a 4 °C hold). Once the reaction is completed, proceed to the next step.\nAdd 30 µL of the library amplification master mix (25 µL of the library amplification buffer, 1 µL of the library amplification enzyme, and 4 µL of nuclease-free water) and 5 µL of the indexing reagent.",
    "Mix everything thoroughly with a pipette and centrifuge the mixture briefly with a tabletop centrifuge.\nPerform a PCR with the conditions presented in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nTemperature,Time,Cycles\n72 ˚C,3 minutes,\n85 ˚C,2 minutes,\n98 ˚C,2 minutes,\n98 ˚C,20 seconds,4 Cycles\n67 ˚C,20 seconds,4 Cycles\n72 ˚C,40 seconds,4 Cycles\n98 ˚C,20 seconds,16 Cycles\n72 ˚C,50 seconds,16 Cycles\n4 ˚C,Hold,\nTable 1: PCR conditions.\nPurification of the PCR products\n\tNOTE: This step can be substituted with other purification methods. If an alternative method is used, make sure to check for the resulting DNA purity using a spectrophotometer. Absorbance ratios of 260/280 and 260/230 must both be above 1.8.\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of magnetic beads, pipette the solution 10x, and centrifuge it briefly with a tabletop microcentrifuge.\nIncubate the solution for 2 min at room temperature.\nIncubate it on a magnetic stand for 5 min or until the solution becomes completely clear, and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the low-binding PCR tube on a magnet stand, wait for 30 s, and remove the supernatant. Repeat this step 2x. Do not disturb the beads.\nBriefly centrifuge the low-binding PCR tube with a tabletop centrifuge and remove any excess ethanol on the magnetic stand. Air-dry the beads but avoid overdrying.\nResuspend the beads with 15 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, thoroughly pipette the solution so that the magnetic beads are homogeneously distributed, incubate the tube for 2 min at room temperature, and after a brief centrifugation, incubate it on a magnetic stand for 2 min until the solution is clear.\n\t\tNOTE: The elution buffer should not contain EDTA, for it interferes with the sequencing chemistry.\nTransfer the supernatant, without disturbing the pellet, to a new low-binding PCR tube.",
    "NOTE: The experiment can be stopped here. Preserve the DNA at 4 °C or at -20 °C for long-time storage.\n5. Quality Check, Quantification, and Sequence of the DNA\nNOTE: A quality check is not conducted prior to this step due to the low amount of DNA.\nValidation of the DNA library size distribution\n\tNOTE: Other high-sensitive electrophoresis systems with a digital reporting of size distribution can be used.\n\t\nReturn the electrophoresis buffer reagent and gel cartridge (25 - 1,000 bp in range) to room temperature.\nAdd 3 µL of electrophoresis buffer reagent with 1 µL of the sequencing library and mix them thoroughly for 1 min with a vortex, and briefly centrifuge them with a tabletop centrifuge.\nConduct electrophoresis and validate the library size distribution with the associated software. The main fragment peak should be broadly ranging from about 300 to 1,000 bp.\nDNA quantification\n\tNOTE: Other fluorescence-based methods or quantitative PCR can also be used, but spectrophotometry should be avoided, as it is not accurate enough for quantifying sequencing libraries.\n\t\nAdd 796 µL of solution buffer and 4 µL of fluorescent reagent and mix them thoroughly. Dispense 190 µL of the working solution to two assay tubes and 197 µL to one assay tube.\nAdd 10 µL of standards with known concentrations of DNA to each assay tube containing 190 µL of the working solution, and 3 µL of the prepared library to the assay tube containing 197 µL of the working solution.\nVortex the tubes briefly and centrifuge them on a tabletop centrifuge. Quantify the DNA using a fluorometer with 3-µL settings.\nDNA library sequence\n\tNote: The sequencing platform must be compatible with the specified library construction kit.\n\t\nPrepare the sequencing library based on the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Set the reagent cassette and flow cell into the sequencing instrument and enter the sequencing run information following the manufacturer's protocol.\nRun the sequencing.\n\t\tNOTE: We have conducted two sequencing runs: one sample/run, as well as four samples multiplexed in one run.\n6. Computational Analysis\nBase-call and, if required, demultiplex the reads.\nValidate the quality of the sequence data with FastQC19.\n\tNOTE: For a more in-depth validation of the obtained data, see our previous report16.\nSubscription Required.
