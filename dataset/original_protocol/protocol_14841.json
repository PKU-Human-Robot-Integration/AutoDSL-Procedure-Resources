    "1. hiPSC Differentiation to Neural Progenitor Cells\nGrow and expand hiPSCs in human embryonic stem cell (HES) media (Table 1) co-cultured on a mouse embryonic fibroblast (mEF) feeder layer until large (but subconfluent) colonies are ready for neural differentiation via an embryoid body (EB) intermediate (Figure 2). Routine hiPSC culture conditions are well described elsewhere 16,17; briefly, grow hiPSCs in HES media on a mEF feeder layer until confluent, then enzymatically passage with collagenase (1mg/ml in DMEM) and expand approximately 1:3 every 7 days.\nTo prepare Poly-L-Ornithine/laminin coated plates, coat plates with 10 μg/ml Poly-L-Ornithine in sterile water for plastic surfaces (50 μg/ml for glass surfaces) and incubate at RT for 3-24 hr. Wash at least once with sterile water and then coat with 5μg/ml Laminin in sterile PBS at RT for 3-24 hr.\n\tNOTE: If wrapped in plastic, plates can be stored for up to six months at -20 ºC.\nOn Day 1, enzymatically lift subconfluent hiPSCs (generally grown on mEFs, or hiPSCs grown in defined media such as TeSR 18 on Matrigel) from the plate as large colonies using 1mg/ml Collagenase IV in DMEM/F12.\n\tNOTE: Following 1-2 hr of incubation at 37 ºC, colonies will be floating in the dish.\nGently wash hiPSC colonies (by settling, not centrifugation) 1-2x with DMEM/F12, resuspend in 2ml/well of N2/B27 media (Table 1) and transfer to non-adherent 6-well dishes (combine 3-wells into 1-well) 19.\n\tNOTE: Overnight, colonies will form floating spherical clusters termed “embryoid bodies” (EBs). Expect substantial cellular death.\nOn Day 2, tilt plates and allow EBs to settle. Carefully remove media and wash once with DMEM/F12 to remove debris. Feed with N2/B27 media supplemented with dual SMAD inhibitors (0.1 μM LDN193189 and 10 μM SB431542) 12.",
    "On Days 3-7, neuralization will occur in the context of dual SMAD inhibition; check that EBs are round but not cystic. Feed EBs every second day with N2/B27 media supplemented with 0.1 μM LDN193189 and 10 μM SB431542.\nOn Days 7-14, following plating of EBs to Poly-L-Ornithine/Laminin coated plates, check using a brightfield microscope that neural rosettes begin to appear within a few days (characterized as round clusters of neuroepithelial cells with apico-basal polarity; Figure 1). Continue to feed adherent EBs every second day with N2/B27 media supplemented with 0.1 μM LDN193189, 10 μM SB431542 and 1 μg/ml laminin.\n2. Harvest of Neural Rosettes\nNOTE: We recommend that neural rosettes be enzymatically harvested using Neural Rosette Selection Reagent 20 or similar selection reagent. Though neural rosettes can be manually picked into 6-well Poly-L-Ornithine/Laminin coated plate, this methodology takes extensive training to master, and, dependent on user skill, may require a second round of picking at day 20 to further enrich for NPCs and deplete non-neural cell types.\nFor enzymatic selection of neural rosettes at day 14, aspirate media from adhered EBs and add 1 ml of neural rosette selection reagent per well for a 6-well plate. Incubate at 37 ºC for 1 hr.\nWith a P1000 pipetman, gently remove enzyme from each well. Add 1 ml of DMEM/F12 per well to wash.\nWith a P1000, collect the 1 ml of DMEM/F12 and quickly expel the DMEM/F12 back into the well, thus detaching the rosettes from the plate. Collect the rosettes into a falcon tube.\nPipet another 1 ml of DMEM/F12 and quickly expel into the same well to detach remaining rosettes. (Do not triturate. Try not to break up rosette aggregates). Collect the neural rosettes into same falcon tube.",
    "Repeat step 2.4 as necessary. If rosettes do not detach readily, add more enzyme and repeat the process (steps 2.1-2.4)\nSpin cells at 300 x g for 3 min. Aspirate the wash, and re-suspend rosettes in 2 ml of NPC media (Table 1). Transfer cells (1:1) into a Poly-L-Ornithine/Laminin coated 6 well plate.\nFrom Days 15-21, the neural rosettes will expand; feed rosettes every second day with NPC media.\nEvaluate the quality of the neural rosettes and ensure that flat fibroblast-like cells are not expanding within the culture.\n\tNOTE: If non-rosettes persist, the NPC culture can sometimes be salvaged by manual picking, selecting only the best of the picked rosettes into Accutase. Dissociate 15 min at 37 ºC. Pellet, wash and plate in NPC media onto 24-well Poly-L-Ornithine/Laminin coated plate.\n3. Expansion of Neural Progenitor Cells\nNOTE: hiPSC NPCs can be grown on either Matrigel- or Poly-L-Ornithine/Laminin coated plates. We typically use Matrigel-plates as they can be prepared more quickly and at lower cost.\nTo prepare Matrigel coated plates, quickly thaw and resuspend a 1mg frozen aliquot of Matrigel in 24 ml cold DMEM/F12 and immediately distribute 2 ml to each well of two six-well plates. Incubate for at least 1 hr at 37 ºC.\n\tNOTE: Matrigel needs only to be aspirated, not washed, immediately prior to use.\nFeed NPCs every second day and maintain at very high density or they will spontaneously differentiate to neurons.\n\tNOTE: Though more established NPCs are typically split 1:4 every week, very low passage NPCs may be split 1:2 as infrequently as once every two weeks.\nTo split, first aspirate media and add 1 ml warm Accutase (1X) per well of 6-well plate. Incubate at 37 ºC for 10-15 min.",
    "Gently transfer detached cells into a 15 ml tube containing DMEM/F12 with as little mechanical stress as possible. Do not titrate cells while in enzyme. Pellet cells by spinning at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the wash, and re-suspend NPCs in ~1 ml NPC media per original well of 6-well.\n\tNOTE: Expect that a confluent well of a 6-well dish has 5-10 million cells; this can be confirmed by counting a 10μl aliquot of cells using a hematocytometer prior to re-plating.\nFollowing re-suspension, re-plate NPCs as NPCs, neurons or neurospheres. To maintain NPCs, plate approximately 1-2 million cells per well of a 6-well plate. The efficiency of neurosphere formation can vary between experiments and cell lines, but generally occurs best if between 200,000 and 1,000,000 cells are seeded per well of a non-adherent 6-well plate; if clumping of the neurospheres occurs, reduce the number of cells seeded. To differentiate to neurons, plate approximately 200,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate, replacing NPC media with Neuron media.\nImmunohistochemically validate every established NPC line. Once sufficient cellular material has been expanded, label NPCs with antibodies for NESTIN and SOX2. Validated NPC lines should also be differentiated into neurons for 4-6 weeks, and labeled with antibodies for βIII-TUBULIN and MAP2AB.\n\t\nFix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 10 min. Permeabilize NPCs at RT for 15 min in 1.0% Triton in PBS, and then block in 5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton at RT for 30 min.\nIncubate with primary antibody in 5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton, overnight at 4°C.\n\t\tNOTE: We recommend the following antibodies: goat anti-Sox2, 1:200; mouse anti-human Nestin, 1:200; rabbit anti-βIII-tubulin, 1:500; mouse anti-βIII-tubulin, 1:500; mouse anti-MAP2AB, 1:200. (Figure 2).",
    "Following a wash with PBS, incubate secondary antibodies cells with the appropriate conjugated secondary antibody to goat, mouse or rabbit at 1:300, in in 5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton for 1-2 hr at RT. To visualize nuclei, stain cells with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and then mount with Vectashield.\n4. NPC Transduction\nUse spinfection (centrifugation of cell culture plates in the presence of virus at 1,000 x g for 1 hr) to increase the percentage of transfected cells 21. Aspirate media and replace with the relevant overexpression (or control) lentiviruses (or retroviruses), titered to the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI) (typically 1-10), diluted in NPC media. Use 1.5 ml volume per well of a 6-well plate (or an appropriately scaled volume for other types of tissue culture plates). Spin at 1,000 x g and 37 ºC for 1 hr in a plate centrifuge.\n\tNOTE: Ideally, transduce NPCs with lentiviral or retroviral vectors within 1-2 days of splitting. Whether using commercial or laboratory-prepared viruses, it can be helpful to appropriately titer batches of virus in advance by serial dilution. (Figure 3).\nTo reduce cellular death, replace media within 8 hr of spinfection.\n\tNOTE: Viral integration and transgene expression should be detectable within 24 hr by reporter gene fluorescence. (If the virus lacks a fluorescent reporter, this is more difficult to assess; successful transfection can best be validated by immunoblot, immunohistochemistry or qPCR for overexpression products.) Full expression may take 3-7 days; repeated spinfections with additional virus may be required to increase the percentage of transfected cells. Recurrent spinfections can occur daily but need not be so frequent. Ideally, if using a fluorescent reporter, >80% of cells should be labeled.\n5. Neurosphere Migration Assay",
    "NOTE: Neurospheres form spontaneously, following the enzymatic dissociation of NPCs (by a manner identical to that used in NPC expansion - steps 3.3-3.6), if cells are cultured in suspension in NPC media.\nBriefly, grow dissociated NPCs in NPC media for 48 hr in nonadherent plates in order to generate neurospheres. (Figure 4).\nFor neurosphere migration, prepare fresh Matrigel plates using cold NPC media, rather than DMEM, in a 96-well plate, 1-2 hr prior to neurosphere picking. Do not aspirate Matrigel from the wells.\nAs originally published for embryonic stem cell-derived neurospheres 22, manually pick NPC-derived neurospheres under a microscope, after washing once in NPC media to remove cellular debris. Transfer one neurosphere to each well of a Matrigel-coated 96-well plate.\nAdd an additional 0.5 mg Matrigel, diluted in cold NPC media, to the neurospheres in each 96-well plate.\nManually center each individual neurosphere in the middle of the well using a pipet tip.\n\tNOTE: It is important to pick neurospheres of similar size, in order to reduce variability in the results.\nAllow migration to occur for 48 hr and then fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde and stain with desired immunohistochemical markers.\nIf radial migration is to be determined, photograph neurospheres in their entirely using a 4x microscope objective. Exclude any neurospheres contacting the edge of the well or a second neurosphere from the analysis.\n\tNOTE: If migration occurs for longer than 48 hr, the resulting radial migration will likely be too large to image using a 4x objective.\nMeasure average migration from each neurosphere using NIH ImageJ software (Figure 5). This can be done using either of the analysis methods described below:\n\t\nRadial migration:",
    "Manually trace the edge of the furthest migrating cells using the freehand selection tool then use the Measure (Ctrl+M) function to calculate the area of the resulting shape. Before measuring the area make sure that Area is checked in the Set Measurements window found under the Analyze tab. Use the value of the area measurement and the equation for the area of a circle (A=πr2) to determine the radius (outer).\nTrace the edge of the original neurosphere, measure the area and calculate the radius (inner) in the same way. Calculate the total radial migration as the difference between the outer and inner radii.\nGreatest cellular migration:\n\t\t\nMeasure the distance moved of the five furthest cells from the edge of the inner neurosphere using the straight-line selection tool followed by the Measure (Ctrl+M) function.\nSubscription Required.
