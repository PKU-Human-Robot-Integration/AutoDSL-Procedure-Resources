Set the shutter open and apply a necessary binning (4 X 4) and a crop of the acquisition area to achieve the shortest intervals between images during the time-lapse imaging.",
    "NOTE: The setting may vary depending on the configurations of microscopes. The camera needs to be high-sensitivity and is able to transfer the data to the connected PC fast enough.
