    "Preparing the conditioned supernatant Figure 1A shows the overview of the procedure. For biological replicates, we recommend repeating the entire section A on different days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230824/20230824222810_3817.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of the protocol for determining gemcitabine degradation rate. A. Protocol for preparing the conditioned supernatants. Bacterial cultures, normalized to an identical optical density, are incubated with gemcitabine in PBS for defined periods of time. Samples are removed from the incubated cultures and filtered to yield conditioned supernatants. The assay can be paused after the filtering stage and supernatants can be frozen for later use. B. Protocol for the functional assay. The reporter strain (E. coli Δcdd) is grown overnight and aliquots of the conditioned supernatant are then added to the growth culture. Growth of the reporter strain is monitored in a microplate optical density (OD) reader. Changes in growth curves are used to infer the gemcitabine concentration in the conditioned supernatant of different strains (red: fast degrader; blue: slow degrader) compared to a reference strain (green). Parts of the figure were created with BioRender.com.Inoculate your test bacterial strains into 1 mL of LB in a 96-deep-well plate and grow overnight at 37 °C, 200 rpm shaker. Also inoculate the reference strain for comparison. Critical:  Inoculate multiple replicates of reference strain (at least six technical replicates)On the next day, pellet the cells by centrifuging the plate at 5,000× g for 10 min using a centrifuge with multi-well plate holders.Discard the supernatant without disrupting the pellet and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 5,000× g for 10 min using a centrifuge with multi-well plate holders.Repeat steps A3–A4 two additional times.",
    "Let the cells incubate in 1 mL of PBS for 1 h and then measure the OD (600 nm) after 1:4 dilution in PBS at a final volume of 200 μL (e.g., 50 μL of cell suspension, 150 μL of PBS).Dilute the cultures to an OD of 0.5 in a 96-deep-well plate at a final volume of 1.1 mL of PBS.Sample 200 μL from the diluted cultures and measure optical density to validate if the dilution was accurate. Critical:  Accuracy of dilution is important since any deviation from the intended cell number will influence the drug breakdown speed and will be incorrectly interpreted as a change in drug breakdown rate.Add gemcitabine at a final concentration of 200 μM: prepare 21× (4.2 mM) gemcitabine and pipette 45 μL into 900 μL of bacterial suspension. Critical:  Make sure your gemcitabine stocks are kept sterile and avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.Caution:  Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment when working with gemcitabine and follow institutional health and safety regulations for managing gemcitabine waste. Gemcitabine is a cytotoxic chemotherapy agent.Incubate the plate on a tabletop microplate shaker at 37 °C and 900 rpm.At designated timepoints (15 and 45 min), transfer 400 μL of liquid culture into a 96-well plate filter placed onto a 96-deep-well plate and centrifuge immediately at 5,000× g for 5 min using a centrifuge with multi-well plate holders. Critical:  A 15 min timepoint is suitable for identifying fast degraders, and a 45 min timepoint is suitable for identifying the slow degraders. These incubation periods can be adjusted for work with other bacterial species that degrade gemcitabine at considerably different rates than E. coli.Safe stopping point: if you are not proceeding immediately to section B, cover the supernatant with sterile plastic foil and freeze at -20 °C.",
    "Performing the functional assay: testing the conditioned supernatants Figure 1B shows the overview of the procedure. We recommend performing section B in triplicates using three independent biological replicates that are collected by performing section A on three different days.Inoculate a single colony of reporter mutant Δcdd into 3 mL of M9 media with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and grow overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm in a shaker.On the next day, measure the OD of the culture (after 1:20 dilution in M9) and dilute the culture to OD 1 in 1 mL of M9.Further dilute the culture 1:500 in M9 (final volume of 25 mL) and pipette 190 μL into each well of a 96-well microplate.Add 10 μL of conditioned buffer from section A into each well. This step should be performed quickly, so all individual cultures start the exposure at the same time point. Caution:  If the conditioned supernatants to be tested are frozen, thaw them at room temperature in advance.Optional:  This step can be performed using a 96-channel handheld electric pipette to make sure all wells receive the conditioned supernatant simultaneously.Monitor the growth of the culture in the microplate using a suitable microplate optical density reader. Define a repeating measurement cycle that includes incubation at 37 °C and double orbital shaking at 360 rpm with reading the OD every 10 min over 8 h (plate lid on). Make sure to measure M9 alone for a blank optical density value."
