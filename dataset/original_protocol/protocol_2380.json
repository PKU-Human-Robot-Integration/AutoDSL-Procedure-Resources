Minimally sheared gDNA is critical for accurately estimating the size of the intact HIV DNA reservoir.\nThaw cryopreserved cells at 20°C–25°C. Invert tubes generously to mix cells.\nWhile cells thaw, pre-heat two heat blocks to 42°C and 56°C.\nBring all reagents to 20°C–25°C.\nNote: If 3 M guanidine HCl or 6 M guanidine isothiocyanate contain precipitates, place in a 37°C water bath to dissolve.\nTransfer approximately ≤1 × 106 cells to 1.5 mL conical tubes (“Eppendorf”). If >1 × 106 cells have been thawed, split the cells between two conical tubes so that each tube contains ≤1 × 106 cells.\nCritical: Dispose of tips following local or institutional biohazardous waste procedures.\nNote: We recommend using ≤2 × 106 T cells or PBMCs per extraction (2 × 106 T cells or PBMCs will yield approximately 1–2 μg gDNA). Utilizing too many cells in this gDNA extraction protocol may results in incomplete cell lysis, diminished gDNA yield, incomplete digestion by BgII enzyme, and excessively viscous gDNA samples that can cause poor droplet generation when used in ddPCR experiments. If alternative cell types are being used, we recommend testing the gDNA extraction using a variety of different cell quantities to optimize the procedure. Extraction quality can be assessed using a Nanodrop to measure yield and the RPP30 reference assay to measure gDNA shearing. We recommend a final yield of 1–5 μg gDNA with <40% shearing.\nPellet cells via centrifugation at 2,400 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant without disrupting the cell pellet.",
    "Critical: Dispose of supernatant and tips following local or institutional biohazardous waste procedures.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of 3 M guanidine HCl and 20 μL Proteinase K solution. Mix gently by pipetting with a wide-bore tip or by inverting the tubes 10 times if wide-bore tips are unavailable.\nNote: It is not crucial that the entire cell pellet is resuspended as it will dissolve during upcoming incubation.\nCritical: Mix gently to minimize mechanical shearing.\nCritical: Tips used with 3 M guanidine HCl or 6 M guanidine isothiocyanate should not be bleached prior to disposal. Dispose of tips following local or institutional chemical waste disposal procedures.\nIncubate at 56°C for 1 h.\nAdd 400 μL of 6 M guanidine isothiocyanate. Mix gently by pipetting with a wide-bore tip or by inverting the tubes 10 times if wide-bore tips are unavailable.\nIncubate at 42°C for 10 min.\nAfter removing the tubes following incubation, set the heat block to 65°C.\nAdd 1 mL of 100% molecular-grade isopropanol. Invert 10 times to mix.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 × g for 10 min.\nRemove supernatant leaving behind ∼100 μL to prevent disrupting the pellet.\nCritical: Supernatant containing 3 M guanidine HCl or 6 M guanidine isothiocyanate should be disposed of in a designated container for chemical waste disposal. (Disposal procedures may vary by institution or local requirements.).\nAdd 750 μL of 70% ethanol. Invert 10 times to mix.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 × g for 2 min.\nRemove supernatant using a p1000 pipette tip. Follow with a p20 or p10 to completely remove any liquid surrounding pellet.\nAir dry pellets for approximately 5 min or until tubes are visibly dry. Do not over-dry pellets.\nNote: Check for liquid by tipping the tube slightly.",
    "Dissolve pellet in 300 μL Buffer EB. Vortex tubes for 5 s to mix.\nIncubate at 65°C for 1 h.\nRemove tubes from the heat block and incubate at 20°C–25°C for at least 30 min and up to 24 h to ensure extraction samples return to ambient temperature prior to enzyme digestion.\nPrior to continuing to enzyme digestion steps, set the heat block to 37°C.\nPause point: This is a safe stopping point. Extraction samples can be stored beyond 24 h up to 7 days at 4°C, if desired.\nRestriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA and ethanol precipitation\nTiming: Day 1: 30 min hands-on with 16–18 h incubation. Day 2: 3 h hands-on\nHigh molecular weight gDNA is enzyme digested using a restriction enzyme with no cut-site within the HIV genome to prepare for use in ddPCR reactions. Following digest, enzyme is removed from gDNA extractions via ethanol precipitation of gDNA.\nThaw NEBuffer r3.1 at 20°C–25°C. Once thawed, vortex well.\nAdd NEBuffer r3.1 and NEB BgII to each tube (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]). Invert tubes 10 times to mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2019_4.csv\nNote: If preparing multiple samples, Buffer r3.1 and NEB BgII can be made into a master mix. Dispense 48.2 μL of master mix to each extraction.\nIncubate 16–18 h at 37°C.\nAfter removing the tubes following incubation, set the heat block to 65°C.\nNote: Place 100% ethanol in freezer prior to incubation for use in step 30.\nAdd 35 μL 3 M sodium acetate and 766 μL of ice-cold 100% ethanol. Invert tubes 10 times to mix.\nIncubate on wet-ice for 30 min.\nRepeat steps 9–17, as described above.\nAdd 50 μL Buffer EB. Vortex tubes for 5 s to mix.\nIncubate at 65°C for 1 h.\nRemove from heat block and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 1–18 h.",
    "Note: High molecular weight gDNA can be extremely viscous. If viscosity makes pipetting difficult, repeat BglI digestion and ethanol precipitation (steps 18–28) by bringing sample to 300 μL with Buffer EB. Highly viscous DNA can interrupt droplet formation in later ddPCR reactions.\nNote: If an unknown number of cells were used for gDNA extraction, quantification of gDNA samples may be required. Input DNA for ddPCR reactions should not exceed 200 ng/μL as higher concentrations of DNA may interfere with droplet formation. Further, if DNA concentration exceeds >300 ng/μL, it is recommended that BglI digestion and ethanol precipitation are repeated (Levy et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nPrepare at least 20 μL of 1:10 diluted gDNA in molecular-grade water for use in the RPP30/deltaD reference assay.\nCritical: Data from the RPP30/deltaD reference assay are used to normalize the concentration of HIV DNA in the corresponding CS-IPDA sample well and infer sample quality. Ensuring sample gDNA is thoroughly mixed prior to dilution and the 1:10 diluted gDNA is thoroughly mixed prior to experiment set up is crucial.\nGenomic DNA samples and dilutions are ready for immediate use in a CS-IPDA experiment or can be stored at −20°C. Extracted gDNA can be aliquoted in small volumes to reduce number of freeze thaws that could shear gDNA.\nSetting up CS-IPDA and RPP30 reference assay ddPCR\nTiming: 1.5 h (for 96 reactions; requires less time for fewer reactions)\nCS-IPDA and RPP30/deltaD multiplex ddPCR reactions are set-up to quantify total and intact copies of HIV DNA per million T cells using gDNA templates.",
    "Note: Probe mixes for individual targets can be made and stored in advance of ddPCR experiments. Probes are sensitive to freeze-thaws, so we recommend probe mixes to be made and stored in small volume aliquots (≤200 μL). These aliquots can be safely stored at −20°C for ≤2 years.\nNote: For HIV DNA quantification, we recommend testing samples by the CS-IPDA in triplicate and by the RPP30/deltaD reference assay in singlet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). CS-IPDA reactions are highly reproducible; variability between replicate wells is expected to be <3-fold change.\nThaw Supermix for probes (no dUTP) on wet ice and vortex well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2019-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example plate layout for performing CS-IPDA and RPP30/deltaD reference assay in a single 96-well experiment\nRPP30/deltaD reference assay reactions are completed in singlet (blue). CS-IPDA reactions are completed in triplicate (white). Experimental controls include all-target plasmid mix gating control (yellow), triple positive plasmid gating control (orange), HIV-positive control, such as J-lat 5A8 or 8.4 gDNA (green), HIV-negative gDNA control (gray), and RPP30 gDNA gating control, such as HIV-negative PBMCs or J-lat 5A8 or 8.4 gDNA (red).\nPrepare RPP30/deltaD reference assay reaction mix (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]). Vortex to mix and keep on wet ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2019_5.csv\nNote: Thaw pre-aliquoted probe mixes on wet ice and mix thoroughly.\nPrepare CS-IPDA reaction mix (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]). Vortex to mix and keep on wet-ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2019_6.csv\nNote: Thaw pre-aliquoted probe mixes on wet-ice and mix thoroughly.\nDistribute 18 μL RPP30/deltaD reaction mix to designated wells.\nOptional: Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for suggested plate layout.\nAdd 2 μL of 1:10 diluted gDNA or RPP30/deltaD reference assay controls to wells containing RPP30/deltaD reaction mix. Pipette up and down to mix well.\nNote: Try to avoid creating air bubbles while mixing reaction mix and template.\nDistribute 16 μL CS-IPDA reaction mix to designated wells.",
    "Optional: Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for suggested plate layout.\nAdd 4 μL of undiluted gDNA or CS-IPDA controls to wells containing CS-IPDA reaction mix.\nNote: Try to avoid creating air bubbles while mixing reaction mix and template.\nCentrifuge plate for 10–20 s to bring contents to bottom of wells.\nDroplet generation and thermal-cycling incubation\nTiming: 1 h hands-on to prepare for a 2.5 h incubation (for 96 reactions; requires less hands-on time for fewer reactions)\nCS-IPDA and RPP30/deltaD ddPCR reactions are partitioned into droplets prior to PCR amplification of target regions.\nPrepare DG8 Droplet Generator Cartridges for droplet generation by inserting into plastic cartridge holders.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, transfer 20 μL of reaction mix from the first 8-well plate column to the middle row of wells on the cartridge.\nCritical: Dispense reaction mix against side of cartridge well slowly to avoid air bubbles. Air bubbles will prevent droplet formation.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, transfer 70 μL of Droplet generation oil for probes to the bottom row of wells on the cartridge.\nApply a DG8 gasket to the cartridge and insert into QX200 Droplet Generator.\nFollowing droplet generation, transfer 40 μL of droplets to the first column of wells on a new ddPCR 96-well plate.\nRepeat steps 37–41 for all remaining samples, dispensing droplets into the corresponding wells on the ddPCR 96-well plate.\nNote: Check wells for any droplet-generation failures. Wells containing droplets will have an opaque top layer.\nHeat-seal the droplet-containing plate with PCR Plate Heat Seal pierceable foil.\nIncubate droplets on a thermal cycler using the PCR cycling protocol (Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2019_7.csv\nNote: The ramp rate is set at 2°C for each step.\nTransfer droplet-containing plate from thermal cycler to QX200 Droplet reader.",
    "Pause point: Following incubation, droplet containing plate can be stored up to 24 h at 4°C prior to droplet reading.\nDroplet reading\nTiming: 3.5 h (for 96 reactions; requires less time for fewer reactions). Droplet reading requires approximately 2 min per well\nDroplets from PCR-amplified CS-IPDA and RPP30/deltaD reactions are analyzed individually using a droplet reader.\nInsert plate into QX200 Droplet reader. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for operating QX200 Droplet reader and QuantaSoft software (www.bio-rad.com[href=http://www.bio-rad.com/]).\nBegin run by setting parameters as follows:\nDefine ‘Supermix’ as “Supermix (no dUTPs).”\nSet ‘Experiment type’ as “ABS.”\nSet ‘Dye(s) used’ as “FAM/HEX.”\nSet both Channel 1 and Channel 2 to “Unknown.”\nInputting channel targets and sample names is optional.\nFollowing completion of plate reading, dispose of the empty plate and droplet waste following disposal procedures as indicated by institution or local requirements."
