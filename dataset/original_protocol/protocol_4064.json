    "For transformation of strawberry we made use of ‘in vitro’ grown plants. These plants were alternated cultured under sterile conditions on shoot propagation medium (SPM), which is Murashige and Skoog macro and micro elements and vitamins (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) (MS) (2.2 g/L), sucrose (30 g/L) Daishin agar (9 g/L), supplemented with BAP and IBA both at concentrations of 0.1 mg/L (pH 5.8) and shoot multiplication medium (SMM) which is MS (2.2 g/L), sucrose (30 g/L) Daishin agar (9 g/L), supplemented with BAP at concentration of 0.5 mg/L (pH 5.8).    The plants were subcultured every 4-6 weeks by transferring side-shoots to fresh SPM and were grown in the light (16 h/8 h light/dark) in a culture room at 25 °C.    Transformations were performed under sterile conditions in a biological safety down flow cabinet. For the transformation leaf discs of 7 mm in diameter were cut from ‘in vitro’ leaf material grown for four weeks on SPM. Leaf discs were collected in pertidishes containing cocultivation medium which is SRM+AS [SRM; MS (2.2 mg/L) with glucose (30 g/L), NAA (0.2 mg/L), TDZ (1.0 mg/L) and gelrite (4 g/L) (pH 5.8) supplemented with acetosyringone (100 μM)].   The Agrobacterium strain AGL0, which contains the supervirulent Ti plasmid pTIBo542 (Lazo et al., 1991) as well as a binary vector harbouring a kanamycin resistance gene (nptII) as plant selectable marker, was cultured overnight in 50 ml tubes containing 10 ml liquid LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/L) and rifampicin (50 mg/L). The bacteria were incubated in a rotary shaker at a temperature of 28 °C.",
    "After overnight growth, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 x g (3,000 rpm) for 10 min and the bacterium pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of filter-sterilized liquid MS-medium containing glucose (30 g/L) and acetosyringone (100 μM) (pH 5.2).   For transfection 20 ml of resuspended Agrobacterium was poured on the leaf discs which were cut and collected before in a petri dish containing cocultivation medium.    After 10-20 min the leaf discs were blotted dry on a sheet of filter paper and were subsequently placed on fresh cocultivation medium that was covered by a disc of MN615 filter paper. The leaf discs were placed with the adaxial side in contact with the filter paper (so, upside-down) and cocultivated with the Agrobacterium cells under sterile conditions, for four days at 21 °C in the dark.   After cocultivation the leaf discs were transferred to SRM supplemented with cefotaxim (250 mg/L) for the elimination of Agrobacteria and kanamycin (100-150 mg/L) for the selective regeneration of shoots. In case overgrowth of the leaf discs with Agrobacteria is experienced, the leaf discs may be wash in a solution containing 500 mg/L cefotaxime prior to transfer to SRM. The leaf discs were cultured in a growth room at 21 °C and at 16 h/8 h light/dark conditions.   The SRM medium was refreshed every 4 weeks and shoots that regenerated on the leaf discs were harvested and transferred to jars containing shoot propagation medium (SPM) with kanamycin (50 mg/L) and cefotaxime (250 mg/L) for further selection and propagation under sterile conditions, at 24 °C and at 16h/8h light/dark conditions. In a typical transformation experiment 50-100% of the leaf discs give transgenic shoots.",
    "Shoots that propagated well and produced roots on this medium were transferred to the same medium but now without kanamycin and cefotaxime to show absence of Agrobacterium and after sufficient roots were formed, the plants were transferred to the greenhouse for further evaluation."
