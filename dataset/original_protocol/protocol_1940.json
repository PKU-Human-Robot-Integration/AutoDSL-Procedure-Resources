This protocol requires a starting population of hESC colonies in a 6 well plate format to be in 75%–85% confluency. This protocol was adapted from previous reports (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Meseguer-Ripolles et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nAspirate the medium from hESCs at 75%–85% confluency (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1537-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. hESC colonies morphology\n(A and B) Representative example of hESC colonies grown on Matrigel approaching 75%–85% confluency.\n(C) Collection of hESCs by using Accutase incubation. Proper time for Accutase incubation (3–6 min) will not make cells float, check cells under the microscope every 2 min, the cell-cell interactions become loose and cells will be easily detached by pipetting medium over the cells. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nWash hESCs with 2 mL of 1 × room temperature DPBS (without Ca2+/Mg2+) per well of a 6 well plate.\nAspirate the DPBS from the well.\nAdd 1 mL of room temperature Accutase containing Y-27632 (10 μM) per well.\nLeave the cultures in a 37°C/5% CO2 cell culture incubator for 3–6 min to dissociate into single cells.\nNote: Incubation time can vary depending on the extent of cell confluency or cell lines used (e.g., H1 hESCs). The use of Y-27632 (Rho-associated kinase inhibitor) enhances cell survival.\n3 min later, check the hESC colonies under the microscope, the cell-cell interactions should become loose and cells within the colonies should become more refringent (cells should not be floating) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Carefully aspirate the Accutase solution without disturbing the cells and immediately add 1 mL of pre-warmed mTeSR1TM with 10 μM Y-27632 per well into a 6 well plate.\nNote: Proper time of Accutase incubation (3–6 min) will not make cells float, check cells under the microscope every 2 min, the cell-cell interactions will become more relaxed and cells will be easily detached by pipetting medium over the cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). A longer time of Accutase incubation (8–15 min) will make cells floating.\nUse 1 mL tips to gently pipette up and down to detach the cells from the well into the medium.\nCarefully collect the medium with cells into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell pellet.\nCarefully aspirate the Matrigel without damaging the Matrigel-coated surface.\nAdd 6–12 mL of pre-warmed mTeSR1TM with 10 μM Y-27632 to cells and gently pipette up and down to ensure a homogeneous single cell solution.\nCount cells using an automatic cell counter using trypan blue to exclude dead cells.\nSeed cells at a density of 1.0–2.0 × 105 cells/cm2 into the Matrigel coated well using mTeSR1TM with 10 μM Y-27632 to a final volume of 2 mL per well in a 6 well plate.\nCritical: Gently move the plate several times back and forth and left to right to ensure an even distribution of the cell suspension.\nIncubate the plate in a 37°C/5% CO2 cell culture incubator overnight (12–16 h) to start differentiation into definitive endoderm cells the day after.\nhESC-derived lung organoids\nTiming: day 1, 41 days, 1 h daily",
    "This step describes how to generate hESC-derived lung organoids by following embryonic lung developmental cues by temporarily introducing a variety of growth factors and small molecules to efficiently generate the definitive endoderm (DE) stage, anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) stage, lung progenitor stage and finally lung organoids (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). This protocol generates lung organoids containing lung proximal and distal cell types, such as ciliated cells (ACE-TUB+), basal cells (P63+), club cells (SCGB1A1+), alveolar type I like cells (AT1, HOPX+) and alveolar type II like cells (AT2, SPC+/SOX9+). This protocol was adapted from a published paper (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1537-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bar, 20 μm.\nAfter overnight growth when hESCs confluency reaches 95%, aspirate the medium from hESCs. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nWash hESCs with 2 mL of room temperature RPMI 1640 medium per well in a 6 well plate then aspirate the RPMI 1640 medium from the well.\nCritical: Remove the mTeSR1TM complete medium from hESCs and gently wash hESCs with room temperature RPMI 1640 medium.",
    "Add 2 mL per well of definitive endoderm differentiation medium. Incubate cultures at 37°C/5% CO2. Replenish the definitive endoderm differentiation medium every 24 h for 3 days.\nOn day 3, aspirate the medium from cultures, wash the cultures with 2 mL of room temperature RPMI 1640 medium per well in the 6 well plate then aspirate the RPMI 1640 medium from the well. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Cultures can be collected to analyze marker of definitive endoderm (FOXA2+, SOX17+) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nAdd 2 mL per well of anterior foregut endoderm differentiation medium. Incubate cultures at 37°C/5% CO2. Replenish the anterior foregut endoderm differentiation medium every 24 h for 4 days.\nOn day 7, aspirate the medium from cultures, wash the cultures with 2 mL of 1 × room temperature DPBS (without Ca2+/Mg2+) per well in the 6 well plate.\nAspirate DPBS from the well.\nAdd 1 mL of room temperature Accutase containing Y-27632 (10 μM) per well and leave the cultures in 37°C/5% CO2 cell culture incubator for 2–4 min.\nCheck the cells under the microscope after 2 min, the cell-cell interactions should become looser and cells should become more refringent (cells should not be floating).\nNote: Proper time of Accutase incubation (2–4 min) will not make cells float, check cells under microscope every 2 min, cell-cell interactions will become more relaxed and cells will be easy detached by following pipetting medium over the cells. A longer time of Accutase incubation (8–15 min) will make cells float.\nAspirate the Accutase carefully and immediately add 1 mL of pre-warmed lung organoids differentiation medium with 10 μM Y-27632 per well in the 6 well plate.\nUse a 1 mL tips to gently pipette up and down to detach the cells from the well into the medium.",
    "Carefully collect the medium with cells into a 1.5 mL sterile eppendorf tube. Count cells using an automatic cell counter using trypan blue to exclude death cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell pellet.\nNote: Use a 20 μL tip to further aspirate the remaining supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet (cells will be embedded in 3D Matrigel, so residual culture medium will affect the solidifying of the 3D Matrigel). Then, tap the cell pellet to ensure that there are no cell clumps.\nPut the eppendorf tube on ice for 1–3 min.\nAdd 100–200 μL ice-cold 3D Matrigel (stock solution, 2.0–4.0 × 105 cells/25 μL ice-cold 3D Matrigel) to cells and gently pipette up and down several times to ensure an even distribution of the cell suspension.\nNote: This procedure will be used to induce anterior foregut endoderm cells to lung progenitors in 3D Matrigel. To avoid 3D Matrigel evaporation, this procedure should be carried out on ice. Pipette with care to avoid making bubbles.\nCritical: 3D Matrigel should be stored at −80°C and thawed on ice overnight before use.\nPlate cells in 3D Matrigel (stock solution) using a 100 μL tip to estimate 20–30 μL of droplets (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1537-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative image of the drops solidified\n(A) Anterior foregut endoderm cells were embedded in 3D Matrigel. Red arrows indicate drops solidified.\n(B) Entire droplet in a 1.5 mL sterile eppendorf tube.\nNote: Pre-cold tips are required. To estimate 20–30 μL of droplets into a 6 well plate (e.g., 6–10 droplets in a well of 6 well plate) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPlace the plate in tissue culture incubator for 15–30 min until Matrigel droplets have solidified (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Add 3–5 mL of pre-warmed lung organoids differentiation medium per well into a 6 well plate, ensuring that the medium completely covers the Matrigel droplet. Incubate cultures at 37°C/5% CO2. Replenish the lung organoids differentiation medium every 48–72 h for 34 days. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nOrganoids should be re-embedded every 5–10 d, or sooner if organoids appear to grow out of the Matrigel or sink to the bottom of the Matrigel droplet.\nNote: Check the cultures every 2–3 days under the microscope. Anterior foregut endoderm cells were embedded in 3D Matrigel to form organoids by self-assembly. Based on our experience, cells will first form small cell clumps 2–4 days later, and gradually form organoids by re-embedding every 5–10 days.\nPick up the entire droplet with a serum pipette and move it to a 1.5 mL sterile eppendorf tube and remove all media using 200 μL or 1 mL tips (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1537-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic of organoid cutting and re-embedding with new 3D Matrigel\nNote: Centrifuge the cultures at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature will be easy to remove most of the media, then use a 20 μL tip to further aspirate residual culture medium (30–80 μL residual medium usually), residual culture medium will affect the solidification of 3D Matrigel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nGently pipette up and down to cut the organoids and the old Matrigel using 20 μL tips, then on ice for 1–2 min to make it cold before re-embedding into new 3D Matrigel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Note: To make even distribution of the organoids in the re-embedding procedure, old 3D Matrigel droplets containing organoids were mechanically cut into small clumps before re-embedding with new 3D Matrigel by using a 20 μL tip to gently pipette up and down. Pipette with care to avoid making bubbles (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nTransfer 100–200 μL of ice-cold fresh 3D Matrigel to the eppendorf tube, mix well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: To avoid 3D Matrigel evaporation, this procedure should be carried out on ice. Pipette with care to avoid making bubbles.\nPlate re-embedded organoids in a 6 well plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPlace the plate in tissue culture incubator for 15–30 min until Matrigel droplets have solidified.\nAdd 3–5 mL of pre-warmed lung organoids differentiation medium per well into a 6 well plate, ensuring that the medium completely covers the Matrigel droplet. Incubate cultures at 37°C/5% CO2. Replenish the lung organoids differentiation medium every 48–72 h.\nCritical: Keep the 3D Matrigel on ice throughout the procedure to avoid its polymerization inside the eppendorf tube.\nNote: Pipette with care to avoid making bubbles. If there are bubbles, centrifuge the eppendorf tube at 200 g at 4°C for 5 min and carefully remove bubbles with 200 μL tips. Then, mix organoids and 3D Matrigel again to make an even distribution of organoids."
