Schematic of the main steps of the protocol Before starting: Prepare the Dissociation buffer (see Recipes and Notes below). Use 10 ml per tumor (for diameters of 0.6-1.2 cm), filter it, and warm it at 37 °C (e.g., in a water bath). Turn on the shaker incubator at 37 °C. The dissociation buffer should be prepared fresh before each experiment.Animal euthanasia must be performed according to the instructions of the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).Preparation of a single cell suspension from mammary tumors (Figure 1)Measure the tumor with a caliper and take note of the tumor size.Surgically remove the tumor from the mouse and place it on a sterile 60 mm × 15 mm Petri dish containing 3 ml of ice-cold RPMI or ice-cold DPBS/0.5% BSA. Take care to avoid taking the lymph node embedded within the mammary gland/tumor tissue.Mince the tumor into 1-2 mm3 pieces using two scalpels (5-10 min, depending on the tumor size) and pour the minced tumor in the buffer into a 15 ml conical tube.Add 10 ml of pre-warmed Dissociation buffer (Recipe 1).Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a shaker incubator. Tighten the 15 ml conical tube cover and wrap it with parafilm. Disrupt tissue every 10 min by vigorously pipetting up and down with a 5 ml pipette.Note: The sample should be cloudy but not stringy. If it is stringy at this step, the DNase I concentration in the dissociation buffer can be increased by adding more DNase I solution. Pipette cell suspension up and down for 2 min using a 5 ml pipette; it is very important to resuspend the cells completely as red blood cells tend to attach to myeloid cells.Centrifuge at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Note: Do not centrifuge at speeds higher than 300 × g if working with lymphocytes as they are sensitive to high g-forces. Aspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of DPBS (or HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% BSA.Place a 100 μm cell strainer directly on top of a fresh 50 ml conical tube. Filter the resuspended cell suspension through the cell strainer. Lift the cell strainer from the tube to allow the content to go through. If necessary, rinse the cell strainer once with 2-3 ml of DPBS (or HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% BSA.Centrifuge at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 10 min at room temperature. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.[Skip Steps A10-A14 if tumor cell suspension is not bloody]. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml of Red Blood Cell Lysing (RBCL) buffer. Gently mix for 1 min at room temperature.Note: Do not place cells on ice during this incubation step. Add 20 ml of DPBS (or HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% BSA.Centrifuge at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 7 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Note: If red blood cell lysis is incomplete, which will be evident macroscopically as a red-colored cell pellet, repeat Steps A10-A12. Resuspend the pellet in 20 ml of DPBS (or HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% BSA.Centrifuge at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 7 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Note: This washing step is to ensure that no RBCL buffer remains in the sample. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of DPBS (or HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% BSA.Place a 70 μm cell strainer directly on top of a fresh 50 ml conical tube. Filter the resuspended cell suspension through the cell strainer.Note: The cells tend to clump; therefore, ensure you resuspend the cells carefully and filter them before counting.",
    "Count the cells to calculate the concentration of live cells using Trypan blue. Keep the cells on ice or at 4 °C.Stain cell populations for FACS analysis (Figure 1)Note: Use ice-cold reagents/solutions and perform all steps at 4 °C (on ice); low temperatures prevent the modulation and internalization of surface antigens, which can reduce fluorescence intensity. Plate cells in a 96-well V-/conical-bottom plate. Each well should contain approximately 1 × 106 cells. Be sure to include wells for single-color controls for compensation (see Figure 2 for example).Centrifuge the plate of cells at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 4 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant by flicking the plate.Note: Ensure there are cells collected at the bottom of each inoculated well as a visible pellet. Resuspend the cells in 50 µl of ice-cold FACS Buffer with Fc Block CD16/CD32 (1:50 dilution for a concentration of 0.5 µg per well).Note: This blocking step is important to prevent non-specific binding and background fluorescence. Incubate on ice for 10 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4012/bioprotoc-11-11-4012-g002.jpgFigure 2. Ninety-six-well plate layout. Example of a suggested layout for Mix 1, including unstained, single stain, and FMO controls. For single-color controls, compensation beads (e.g., UltraComp eBeads) can be used. Unstained and FMO controls must be done with the sample of interest to account for auto-fluorescence. Single-color controls must be included for each antibody/fluorophore used.Cell-Surface Staining: While cells are incubating in Fc block, prepare the antibody solutions (see Table 1) with the FACS buffer. Suggested antibody combinations and dilutions (based on a total volume of 100 µl/well, 50 µl of Fc block + 50 µl of antibody mix) are shown in Table 2. Prepare 50 µl antibody mixtures per sample.Table 2. Suggestion of three different antibody panelsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210526/20210526232726_0788.jpg Note: Antibodies are added as 50 µl solutions to final total volumes of 100 µl.",
    "Therefore, the final dilution represents half of the dilutions prepared. * Intracellular antibody From this step on, keep the plate in the dark and on ice. Add 50 µl of antibody solution (Table 2) to the appropriate wells (it is unnecessary to wash the FC block off the cells; the total volume of the well will be 100 µl, with final dilution factors indicated in Table 2) and mix by pipetting up and down. Incubate the cells in the dark and on ice for 30 min.For flow cytometer compensation, prepare a sample of unstained cells (control well) and samples with cells (or beads) stained with each antibody-fluorophore combination used in the experiment. In control wells that do not receive antibody, it is critical to add the 50 µl of FACS buffer to avoid letting the cells dry out. Compensation beads can also be used for single-cell staining. We suggest the use of UltraComp eBeads (follow the suggested protocol from the manufacturer).Wash the cells by adding 150 µl of ice-cold FACS buffer to each well.Centrifuge the plate with cells at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 4 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant by flicking the plate. Wash 2× with 200 µl of ice-cold FACS buffer.Intracellular (nuclear) staining: (If no intracellular staining is to be performed, go directly to Step B23)To stain for FOXP3, an intracellular antigen, we used the True-NuclearTM Transcription Factor Staining Buffer from Biolegend, following the exact instructions provided by the manufacturer. Other kits might be used instead of the protocol is adapted for staining of intracellular cytokines (e.g., IL-6).After the last wash, discard the supernatant and gently vortex the samples (or pipette up and down) to dissociate the cell pellet.",
    "Prepare fresh True-Nuclear Fix working solution by diluting the 4× Fix Concentrate (1 part) with the Fix Diluent (3 parts)Add 200 µl of the True-Nuclear 1× Fix working solution to each well. Gently pipette up and down to ensure cells are fully resuspended. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 45-60 min.Note: A longer fixation period can help reduce high background. Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 4 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Prepare a 1× working solution of the Perm Buffer by diluting the 10× Perm Buffer with distilled water.Add 200 µl of the True-Nuclear 1× working solution Perm Buffer to each well.Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g (1,200 rpm) for 4 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.Repeat Steps B14-B15 for two additional times, for a total of three washes using the True-Nuclear 1× Perm Buffer.Add the appropriate amount of FOXP3 antibody diluted in True-Nuclear 1× Perm Buffer to each well and incubate in the dark at room temperature for at least 30 min.Add 200 µl of the True-Nuclear 1× Perm Buffer to each well. Repeat Steps B15-B16.Resuspend the cells in 150 µl of ice-cold FACS Buffer.Transfer the cells to labeled 12 × 75 mm polystyrene test tubes and add 350 µl of FACS Buffer (so that the final volume is 500 µl).Acquire the samples on a flow cytometer as fast as possible (keep the cells in the dark and on ice or at 4 °C). We typically acquire 500,000-750,000 events or cells per sample.Analyze data using software such as FlowJo or FACSDiva. Immune cell populations are identified based on the expression of cell surface molecules (see Table 3); an illustrative gating scheme is shown in Figure 3.Table 3.",

Illustrative gating strategy for immune cells. First, cells from tumors are plotted on a Forward Scatter (FSC) versus Side Scatter (SSC) plot to discriminate intact cells from debris. Then, single cells are selected by displaying a plot of FSC area (FSC-A) versus FSC height (FSC-H). Live/dead cells are discriminated by selecting the Zombie Red low (live cells) or high (dead cells) population. Live single cells are then evaluated for the expression of selected cell surface markers (Table 3). Epithelial-derived cancer cells can be further discriminated from CD45+ cells by expression of EpCAM. The plots in this figure are representative of data presented in Fein et al. (2020) and adapted with permission."
