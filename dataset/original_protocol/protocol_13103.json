Sterilize by filtration and store at -20 °C.\n2. Protein preparation\nDetermine the concentration of the target protein stock in µM. The most convenient way to assess protein concentration is to measure the absorbance of the protein stock at 280 nm. If the concentration is known in mg/mL, convert it to µM using the molecular weight of the target protein. A range of methods can be used depending on the protein of interest; see the Discussion section for details.\n\tNOTE: If the protein is truncated (specific protein domain/motif) or tagged, remember to account for these changes in molecular weight when converting from mg/mL to µM.\nPrepare three microcentrifuge tubes labeled \"round 1\", \"round 2/3\", and \"round 4/5\".\n\t\nCalculate the volume of protein necessary to dilute it to 1 µM in 800 µL PBS and aliquot this volume into the tubes without adding PBS.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the amount of target protein available is low, the concentration can be lowered to as little as 0.25 µM.\n3. Preparation for round one of selection\nPrepare a seed culture for culturing the phage input for round two of selection.\n\t\nInoculate 5 mL of 2YT/tet with a well-isolated Escherichia coli colony and incubate overnight at 37 °C with 200 rpm orbital shaking.\nCoat the plate for the first round of selection.\n\t\nDilute the target protein in the \"round 1\" tube with the appropriate amount of PBS and aliquot 100 µL into eight wells of a 96-well binding plate (i.e., the target plate).",
    "​NOTE: Phage display can be done for four different proteins simultaneously on a single plate by coating the wells in the corners of the plate.\nOptional control: If the target protein is tagged, such as with GST or MBP (maltose binding protein), coat eight wells in another 96-well binding plate with 100 µL of a 1 µM solution containing the appropriate epitope tag. This will be used to remove undesired phage that bind to the tag non-specifically.\nShake plate(s) overnight at 4 °C with 200 rpm orbital shaking.\n4. Round one of selection\nPrepare the round two input.\n\t\nInoculate 30 mL of 2YT/tet with 200 µL of the seed culture from step 3.1.\nIncubate at 37 °C with 200 rpm orbital shaking until the bacteria are in mid-log phase (OD600 imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62950/62950eq01v2.jpg 0.6 - 0.8). This takes approximately three h.\nBlock target plate.\n\t\nRemove the coating solution from the plate, or both plates if a control plate has been made, by inverting and shaking over a sink. Pat dry on paper towels.\nAdd 300 µL of PB buffer to each coated well.\nRemove the PB buffer as in step 4.2.1 and add another 200 µL of PB buffer.\nIncubate at room temperature (~20-25 °C) for 1 h with 300 rpm orbital shaking.\nPrepare phage library.\n\t\nThaw the phage library on ice and dilute it to 100x the library diversity in PBS. For example, if the library diversity is 1 x 1010 and the library concentration is 1 x 1013, dilute the library so that the concentration is 1 x 1012. For the libraries used here, dilute them 10-fold in PBS by combining 1 mL of the library with 9 mL of PBS.",
    "NOTE: Library diversity should have been determined during library creation and cannot be easily assessed otherwise. Library concentration can be determined by inoculating E. coli cells in mid-log phase (OD600 imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62950/62950eq01v2.jpg 0.6 - 0.8) and plating on LB/carb.\nAdd 1/5 volume of PEG/NaCl. For example, for 10 mL of the previously diluted library, add 2 mL of PEG/NaCl.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C, discard supernatant, and recentrifuge for 2 min to pull down the remaining supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: Put the tube in the rotor in the same orientation the second time as it was the first to keep the pellet in the same place, therefore, making it easier to see.\nGently resuspend the phage pellet in 1 mL of PBT per protein. For four proteins, resuspend the pellet in 4 mL of PBT.\n\t\tNOTE: Try not to touch the pellet and do not introduce air bubbles.\nDisplay phage to the target protein(s).\n\t\nOptional control: Add 100 µL of phage library to each coated well in the control plate. Incubate at room temperature (~20-25 °C) for 1 h with 300 rpm orbital shaking and transfer the library from the control plate to the target plate. Skip step 4.4.2.\nRemove the PB buffer from the target plate as in step 4.2.1 and add 100 µL of the phage library to each coated well.\nIncubate at room temperature (~20-25 °C) for 1 h with 300 rpm orbital shaking.\nElute round one phage.\n\t\nRemove phage library and wash the coated wells four times with PT buffer. Invert the plate and tap on a paper towel to remove the last drops.\n\t\tNOTE: If multiple target proteins are coated on one plate, try to minimize the flow of all subsequent solutions between the wells.",
    "Add 100 µL of 0.1 M HCl to each coated well and incubate at room temperature for 5 min with 300 rpm orbital shaking.\nNeutralize the pH by adding 12.5 µL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 11) to each coated well.\nPool the eluted phage from all 8 wells into a single 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Pipette up and down during the transfer to make solutions homogenous and aspirate all liquid from the wells.\nAdd 10% BSA to the pooled eluted phage to a final concentration of 1%. For a typical round one elution volume of 950 µL, add 95 µL of 10% BSA. Store at 4 °C. This is the round one output.\n5. Preparation for subsequent rounds of selection\nPrepare a seed culture for culturing the phage input for the next round of selection as in step 3.1.\nCoat the plate for the third round of selection as in step 3.2 with the changes noted below.\n\t\nOnly coat four wells per protein in a 96-well binding plate. Use half of the contents of the \"round 2/3\" or \"round 4/5\" tubes for the appropriate round. Dilute the contents of these tubes as needed, in order to avoid proteins settling out of the solution.\nPrepare the phage input for the next round of selection.\n\t\nUse half of the round one output from step 4.5.5 to inoculate 3 mL of mid-log phase cells from step 4.1. For a typical round one output, inoculate with 500 µL of the output.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min with 200 rpm orbital shaking.\nAdd M13K07 helper phage to a final concentration of 1 x 1010 PFU/mL.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h with 200 rpm orbital shaking.",
    "Transfer the entire 3 mL of culture to 30 mL of 2YT/carb/kan. Grow overnight at 37 °C with 200 rpm orbital shaking.\nThe next day, transfer the culture into a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate cells.\nDecant the supernatant into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube and mix with 8 mL of PEG/NaCl and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and centrifuge again for 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Put the tube in the rotor in the same orientation the second time as it was the first to keep the pellet in the same place, therefore, making it easier to see.\nResuspend the phage pellet in 800 µL of PBT so that it is fully homogenous and no clumps are visible.\nTransfer the phage solution to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 16,200 x g for 4 min at 4 °C to pellet debris.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube. This is the input for the next round of selection.\nOptional: Titer the input and output solutions.\n\t\nUse 500 µL of an E. coli seed culture to inoculate 5 mL of 2YT/tet and incubate at 37 °C with 200 rpm orbital shaking until bacteria is in mid-log phase (OD600 imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62950/62950eq01v2.jpg 0.6 - 0.8). This takes approximately 1 h.\nDilute phage input/output solutions to 10-3  - 10-5 in PBS and add 10 µL of each dilution to 90 µL of cultured cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Use diluted phage solutions immediately because phage will adsorb to the tube over time, and transformations may produce false negatives.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 20 min with 200 rpm orbital shaking.\nPlate 5 µL on separate LB/carb plates.",
    "​NOTE: Amount plated is variable depends on previous results/personal preference.\n6. Subsequent rounds of selection\nPerform all subsequent rounds along with the preparation as done in steps 3 and 4, respectively, with differences noted below.\n\t\nUse the input produced in the previous round as the phage source instead of a library. Coat 4 wells per target protein with 100 µL of the phage input acquired from the previous round. Store remaining phage inputs at 4 °C.\nMake the washing step in 4.5.1 more stringent with each round of selection. Round one requires washing 4 times, round two requires 6 times, round three requires 8 times, and rounds four and five both require washing 10 times.\nReduce some volumes compared to those used in round one because subsequent rounds only coat four wells instead of eight. For example, in step 4.5.5 only 45 µL of 10% BSA is added to the phage output, and in step 5.3.1 only 250 µL of the phage output is used to inoculate cells.\n7. Post selection processing and phage Isolation\nTiter the input and output solutions for rounds four and five.\n\t\nIf not already done in step 5.4, follow the same steps to titer rounds four and five phage outputs, ideally producing a range of 30-300 colonies across a few plates.\nCulture and isolate phage.\n\t\nAliquot 450 µL of 2YT/carb/M13K07 into every tube of a 96 mini tube culture box.\nPick well-isolated colonies from any of the plates from step 7.1 to inoculate each tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the top half of the box for round four outputs and the bottom half for round five outputs.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C with 200 rpm orbital shaking.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "Transfer as much supernatant as possible to a new 96 mini tube culture box without disturbing the cell pellet and discard the old one. Store at 4 °C.\nFrom the new box, transfer 100 µL from each tube to a 96 well non-binding plate containing 100 µL of 50% glycerol in all wells. Mix well and store at -80 °C as a backup stock.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
