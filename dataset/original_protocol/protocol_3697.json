    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssemble perfusion pump and harvest table\nTiming: 10 min\nCover the surface of a plastic tray with a sheet of absorbent bench paper and then layer with two paper towels.\nAssemble tools including: surgical scissor, tweezer, suture, catheter, 2 cotton tips, razor blade, petri dishes, a stack of paper towels, pump, tubing for the pump, a bottle of PBS, a beaker, 70% ethanol, and biohazard bags for waste and carcass disposal.\nAttach the tubing to the peristaltic pump. Place the inlet end of the tubing into the bottle of PBS and the outlet end in a beaker. Start the pump until the air is cleared from the line and the entire tubing is filled with PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/622-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustrations for murine portal vein cannulation and subsequent processing into single-cell suspension for flow cytometry\n(A) Set up of the variable-flow peristaltic pump for liver perfusion. The inlet of the tubing is placed in a bottle of autoclaved PBS with the outlet end of the tubing placed in a beaker until the catheter is attached and inserted into the portal vein. Arrows indicate the flow of PBS from inlet to outlet.\n(B) Step-by-step procedure (left to right) for securing a half-knot around the portal vein, identifying the “flash” for successful portal cannulation, and completing liver perfusion.\n(C) Schematic diagrams of enzymatic digestion and centrifugation protocols required to isolate non-parenchymal cells (including macrophages) from the liver.\nSet up reagents for harvest\nTiming: 10–30 min\nPrepare complete DMEM and FACS buffer (as described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nPrepare and label 3 sets of 50 mL conical tubes for each liver sample.\nPrepare digestion buffer (as described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) in the first set of 50 conical tubes.",
    "If collecting liver samples for IF, prepare 500 μL formalin solution in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nPerfusion of mouse liver\nTiming: 15 min/mouse\nProper perfusion of the liver is essential for maximum yield of liver macrophages for downstream analyses including, but not limited to, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.\nEuthanize the mouse using carbon dioxide and subsequently perform cervical dislocation.\nWeigh and record the body weight of the mouse using a balance.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position and sterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nUse a tweezer to lift up the skin near the genitals and make an incision with scissors. Pull the skin up to expose the body cavity membrane.\nCarefully cut open the peritoneal cavity membrane and move the small intestines aside to fully expose the liver.\nLocate the portal vein underneath the liver. Place a suture underneath the vein and secure a half-knot (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCannulate the portal vein with the catheter until its tip reaches the branching point of the vein and passes the half-knotted suture. Tighten the knot to secure the catheter and remove the needle. A successful cannulation will result in a flash of blood into the catheter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B; Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nOptional: Blood can be collected at this point from portal vein and/or IVC using 1mL syringe with a 21G × 1 ½ needle. Washing the tube with EDTA can be used to prevent clotting in the tube.\nPerfuse the portal vein with PBS using the peristaltic pump at a rate of 5 mL/min. After attaching the tubing onto the catheter immediately cut the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the liver to release blood and PBS from the liver. The liver should start to appear pale and beige in color.",
    "Critical: Start the flow of PBS prior to inserting the tubing onto the catheter to prevent the introduction of air bubbles into the liver vasculature.\nIncrease the flow rate to 10 mL/min. Apply gentle pressure on the IVC periodically and massage the liver with cotton tipped wood applicator to promote clearance of sinusoidal blood. Perfuse for a minimum of 3 min, or until the liver is completely pale (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The total perfusion volume of PBS should be about 30 mL.\nRemove catheter, suture, and gallbladder from the liver. Resect the liver from the body cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nWeigh and record total liver weight.\nResect specific lobes of the liver for downstream analyses: for example, left medial and lateral lobe for flow cytometry and right lateral lobe for immunofluorescence. For flow cytometry between 0.5- 1 gm of tissue is recommended. (Further processing for immunofluorescence: see section Immunofluorescence of liver tissue[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6])\nOptional: Depending on experimental question, the remaining liver tissue can be processed for other analyses including, but not limited to, histology, RNA, protein, or triglyceride quantification. For histology, submerge tissue into 500–750 μL formalin and incubate at 4°C for 24 h. Transfer tissue into 70% ethanol for subsequent paraffin embedding. For RNA, protein and triglyceride quantification, flash freeze tissue in liquid nitrogen and transfer to −80°C.\nNote: It is a lab-dependent choice to decide which lobe to use for specific analysis, but it is encouraged to maintain consistency across different experimental groups and different experiments.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethod video S1. Technique for portal vein cannulation and liver perfusion, related to step 13–16\nEnzymatic digestion and dissociation of liver tissue into single-cell suspension\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "This step describes the process of collagenase A digestion and differential centrifugation of liver tissue to prepare single-cell suspension for flow cytometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: The cell suspension obtained after this step can also be used for alternative purposes, for example flow sorting, single-RNA sequencing, and/or ex vivo function assays.\nWeigh and record the liver tissue dedicated for flow cytometry.\nPlace the liver in a petri dish and mince finely with a razor blade.\nTransfer the minced liver into a prepared digestion buffer and keep on ice until the end of the tissue harvest.\nAt the end of the harvest, warm up all samples in a 37°C water bath for 5 min.\nPlace the liver mixture on a shaker at 37°C with rotation for 30 min to digest. Vortex mixture after 15 min.\nPre-wet 70 μm cell strainers placed onto new 50 mL falcon tubes with 5 mL cold complete DMEM.\nTransfer the digested liver mixture onto the cell strainers to allow pass-through of cells into the new 50 mL tubes.\nTo inactive enzymatic activity, add 15 mL cold complete DMEM to the original tubes and carefully pour the rinse onto the cell strainers, while mashing any undigested liver pieces using the end of a syringe plunger.\nCentrifuge the strained cell suspension at 50 × g for 3 mins at 4°C to initially separate hepatocytes (pellet) and non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) (supernatant).\nCarefully pour the supernatant containing NPCs into a new 50 mL falcon tube. Discard pellet containing hepatocytes. Of note, ∼10% of KCs will be lost in the hepatocyte pellet.\nNote: Hepatocyte pellet may be loose, use caution while pouring or use a pipette.\nOptional: Hepatocytes in the pellets can also be processed separately if of interest.",
    "Centrifuge the NPC suspension at 163 g for 7 min at 4°C to pellet the NPCs. The supernatant can be discarded.\nResuspend the NPC pellet with 1 mL ACK lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min, at 20°C to lyse red blood cells. Add 10 mL PBS to wash.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 163 g for 7 min at 4°C to re-pellet the NPCs. At this point the pellet should be pale and free of red blood cells.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL PBS and transfer to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Keep on ice.\nPause Point: Samples can be kept on ice for 1–2 h until ready to proceed to the next step. If pause, resuspend cells in 1 mL FACS buffer instead of PBS.\nStaining for flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step details the method of staining liver NPCs for identifying macrophage populations (Kupffer cells (KCs), monocyte-KCs, hepatic lipid-associated macrophages, and monocytes) by flow cytometry. Key markers include CD45, CD11b, F4/80, TIM4, VSIG4, CLEC2, Ly6C and MHCII. For this protocol, the antibody panel in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] will be used as an example.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_622_8.csv\nFor exact antibodies, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nOptional: Depending on experimental question, additional markers may be added, for example CD11c for dendritic cells, Ly6G for neutrophils, and/or Siglec F for eosinophils.\nNote: This staining protocol utilizes Zombie Aqua to assess live/dead status of cells prior to staining for surface markers, hence requiring cell suspension to be free of BSA in step 36 Alternatively, DAPI can also be used to identify live cells. For DAPI staining, resuspend stained-cells in 1× DAPI solution in FACS buffer (according to manufacturer instruction) prior to analyzing samples on the cytometer.\nPellet the cells using a bench-top centrifuge at 650 × g for 3.5 min at 4°C.",
    "If cells are in buffers containing BSA, wash off and exchange with PBS.\nResuspend pellet with 100 μL Zombie Aqua solution at 1:250 dilution in PBS for live/dead stain. Incubate on ice and in the dark for 15 min.\nWash the cells by adding 700 μL of FACS buffer to cell suspension. Pellet the cells at 650 × g for 3.5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 10 μL Fc block solution. Incubate on ice and in the dark for 5 min.\nAdd 90 μL of antibody cocktail to the cell suspension. Resuspend and incubate on ice and in the dark for at least 45 min (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nWash the cells by adding 700 μL FACS buffer to the cell suspension. Pellet the cells at 650 × g for 3.5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 300 μL FACS buffer.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70-μm cell strainer into 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom flow tube and keep on ice in the dark. The samples are now ready to be analyzed on a flow cytometer.\nImmunofluorescence of liver tissue\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis step will explain immunofluorescence staining of macrophage markers in liver tissue. This can be used for analysis of identified NASH-associated macrophage markers, i.e., TREM2, Gpnmb and CD63, that have been proven difficult to analyze via flow cytometry (Daemen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Remmerie et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Additional information that can be obtained is localization of macrophage subsets in the tissue as well as their proximity to other parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells.",
    "Following perfusion, harvest liver lobe and place the tissue into a tube containing formalin. It is critical to ensure the tissue is submerged in formalin, which typically requires a volume of 500–700 μL of fixative. We typically use the right medial liver lobe for IF. Keep on ice until all tissue is harvested.\nCritical: To maintain tissue architecture of the liver, immediate incubation in fixative following tissue isolation is essential.\nIncubate at 4°C for 24 h.\nTransfer liver lobe to 750 μL 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for 24 h. A minimum incubation of 24 h is required, but incubation may be extended up to 72 h.\nSubmerge and freeze liver lobe in OCT in mold and store at −80°C. Ideally, the liver will be sectioned in the horizontal plane and therefore the smooth dome shaped portion of the liver lobe should be placed face down in the OCT media.\nCut 8 μM tissue sections using a cryostat on glass slides. Tissue sections can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nPrepare 50 mL blocking buffer fresh on the day of staining.\nRetrieve frozen slides from −80°C and let them air dry for 15–20 min at 20°C.\nCritical: Prevent drying of the tissue sections at any step during the rest of the staining protocol.\nIncubate slides in PBS for 5 min in glass chamber, followed by 45 min in blocking buffer.\nPrepare primary antibody, 50 μL per section, in blocking buffer.\nCarefully extract slides from glass chamber and dry slides around the tissue sections with Kimwipe. Encircle sections with using a hydrophobic pen and add 50 μL primary antibody solution on each section.\nKeep slides in a container on wet paper towels 16–24 h at 4°C.",
    "Incubate slides in PBS for 5 min in glass chamber to wash and perform this step three times.\nCarefully extract slides from glass chamber and dry slides around the tissue sections with Kimwipe. Re-apply hydrophobic barrier with pen if necessary.\nPrepare secondary antibody solution and add 50 μL per section. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nIncubate slides in PBS for 5 min in glass chamber to wash, 2 times.\nPrepare 50 mL Hoechst dye (1:25000) and add solution to slides in glass chamber. The nuclear dye should be prepared fresh for each experiment.\nRetrieve slides from glass chamber, dry carefully, and apply a small drop of prolong gold antifade reagent. Place cover slip on top and let slides dry for minimum of 1 h in dark.\nImaging can be done with light or confocal microscopy. For optimal result, image within one week of staining."
