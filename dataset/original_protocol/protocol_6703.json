    "Purification of TEV proteaseNote: The following protocol is for purifying TEV from a 6 L culture volume of bacteria which yields approximately 100 mg of > 95% pure protein. Bacterial cell transformation, induction, and harvestTransform ~100 ng of pHis-TEV plasmid (ampicillin resistant; available from the authors) into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIL cells (chloramphenicol resistant) and plate on Agar Plates supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Grow transformants at 37 °C overnight.The next day, harvest the transformants by scraping the entire plate into a starter culture of 90 ml Growth Media supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol.Grow starter culture at 37 °C with 250 RPM shaking for 2 h.Add 1 L Growth Media to each of 6 PYREX® 2,800 ml Fernbach-Style Culture Flask with Baffles. Add 10 ml starter culture to each 1 L baffled shaker flask.Grow cultures at 37 °C with 250 RPM shaking until cultures reach OD600 = 0.7 (approximately 1-3 h).Once cultures reach OD600 = 0.7, rapidly cool shakers and media to 15 °C (approximately 30-60 min).Once temperature is equilibrated to 15 °C, supplement 1 mM IPTG and continue shaking at 15 °C and 250 RPM for 16 h.Spin cells in 1 L centrifuge bottles at 4,658 x g for 25 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.Bacterial cell lysisNote: All steps should be performed on ice/at 4 °C with pre-chilled tubes unless otherwise indicated. Resuspend the bacterial cell pellet in 72 ml ice-cold TEV Lysis Buffer and transfer to 50 ml conical tubes.Add 6 ml of 20 mg/ml lysozyme to the TEV Lysis Buffer. Incubate cells on ice with lysozyme for 30 min.Sonicate sample with one 30 s cycle and three 15 s cycles at power level 9. Keep conical tubes on ice while sonicating and let lysate cool on ice for 5 min between sonication cycles.",
    "Note: It is extremely important to keep the lysate cool at this step as the sonication can heat the lysates and denature the protein. Transfer lysate into NalgeneTM Oak Ridge High-Speed PPCO Centrifuge Tubes and centrifuge lysate at 30,597 x g and 4 °C for 20 min to clear the lysates.Purification against N-terminal His tagEquilibrate 21 ml Ni-NTA resin with two bed volumes (BV) of ice-cold TEV Lysis Buffer in 50 ml conical tubes. Centrifuge at 796 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard supernatant. Repeat 3-4 times.Note: Higher centrifuge speeds at this step will damage the amylose resin. Add cleared bacterial cell lysates to equilibrated Ni-NTA resin. Nutate slowly at 4 °C for 2 h.Note: If lysates are nutated too rapidly, bubbles will form in the buffer which can drive protein denaturation. Centrifuge at 796 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard supernatant.Add two BV of ice-cold TEV Wash Buffer to the resin and gently but fully resuspend the resin in the TEV Wash Buffer. Centrifuge at 796 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard supernatant. Repeat until the resin has been washed with ~25 BV of TEV Wash Buffer.Using ~2 BV of ice-cold TEV Wash Buffer, load Ni-NTA resin onto an Econo-Column® Chromatography Column and let TEV Wash Buffer drain through resin until level with top of resin.Elute protein from an Econo-Column® Chromatography Column using 5-10 BV of TEV Elution Buffer, one BV at a time.Note: It is useful to run a Bradford assay for each column volume and continue eluting until < 0.1 mg of protein elutes per column volume. Pool elution and spin concentrate to 10 ml by centrifuging at 3,184 x g and 4 °C in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit.",
    "Transfer protein solution to a 15 ml conical tube and spin at 3,184 x g and 4 °C for 3 min to remove aggregates.Dialysis and purification using ion-exchange chromatographyWash dialysis tubing (SpectrumTM Labs Spectra/PorTM 6 8000 D MWCO Standard RC Pre-wetted Dialysis Kits 5.1 ml/cm vol./Length) in TEV Dialysis Buffer.Seal one end of dialysis tubing with a dialysis tube clip (SnakeSkinTM Dialysis Clips).Transfer protein solution into dialysis tubing and seal the other end of the tubing with another dialysis clip.Place dialysis bag gently into 5 L of TEV Dialysis Buffer and dialyze overnight (~12 h) at 4 °C.Transfer protein solution to a 15 ml conical tube and spin at 3,184 x g and 4 °C for 10 min to remove any protein that may have precipitated during dialysis.Remove supernatant and filter protein through Steriflip® 0.22 µm filter prior to loading on FPLC.Pre-equilibrate the HiTrap® SP XL Column in two column volumes (CV) of water at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and then two CV of TEV Low-Salt IEX Buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Load filtered protein onto the HiTrap® SP XL Column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Wash with two CV of TEV Low-Salt IEX Buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Elute using a gradient from 0% TEV High-Salt IEX Buffer to 80% TEV High-Salt IEX Buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min over the course of 40 min. Collect 0.5 ml fractions in FisherbrandTM Disposable Borosilicate Glass Tubes with Plain End. Make sure the entire FPLC system is kept at 4 °C.Using the UV chromatogram at 280 nm, asses the location of the main peak of the TEV protease.",
    "Assess the purity of the putative TEV protease-containing fractions using Coomassie Brilliant Blue by loading 20 µl of each fraction onto an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1). Only pool fractions with >95% purity. See data analysis section for further details.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3858/bioprotoc-10-23-3858-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Then equilibrate with one CV Skd3 Sizing Buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Note: It is important to start equilibration into water the day before lysing the cells and start the equilibration into Sizing Buffer first thing the morning the cells are lysed as this process takes 6 h for each equilibration step. Transfer pooled flow-through to spin concentration columns.Spin concentrate to < 13 ml by centrifuging at 3,184 x g and 4 °C in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit.Note: This is the maximum volume that can be loaded onto a HiPrepTM 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR Column with good column resolution. If another size-exclusion chromatography column is used, this value will differ. Filter protein through Steriflip® 0.22 µm filter prior to loading on FLPC.Note: This step is important to prevent the loading of aggregates or debris onto the FPLC and size-exclusion column which can be severely damaging. Load filtered protein onto the HiPrepTM 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR Column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Flow 1.5 CV of Skd3 Sizing Buffer through the HiPrepTM 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR Column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and collect 1 ml fractions in FisherbrandTM Disposable Borosilicate Glass Tubes with Plain End. Make sure the entire FPLC system is kept at 4 °C.Note: Once the sizing step has started, it can run overnight, and purification can resume the next morning.",
    "The next morning, using the UV chromatogram at 280 nm, asses the location of the main peak of Skd3. Note that Skd3 generally elutes at a broad peak from 57 ml to 69 ml. Smaller peaks will also be observed for some residual cleaved MBP and TEV protease.Assess the purity of the putative Skd3-containing fractions using Coomassie Brilliant Blue by loading 20 µl of each fraction onto an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2).
