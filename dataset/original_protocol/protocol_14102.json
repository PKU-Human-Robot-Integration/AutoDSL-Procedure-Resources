    "The HSC ex vivo expansion protocol follows the guidelines of the Research Ethics Committee at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.\n1. Buffer and Media Preparation\nPrepare separation buffer 24 h prior to isolation of CD34+ cells from UBCs by adding 2 mL of 0.5 M Ethylene Diamine Tetra-acetic Acid (EDTA) and 33 mL of 7.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to 465 mL buffered saline (1x PBS). Mix gently and maintain the buffer overnight at 4 °C.\nWarm media at room temperature on the day of purification.\n2. Isolation of Mononuclear Cells (MNCs) from UCB Unit\nDispense the whole UCB unit into a 75 cm2 flask. Dilute and gently mix the UCB with an equal volume of PBS at room temperature.\nDetermine the number of tubes required for processing the whole UCB unit (one 50 mL conical tube can be used to process 35 mL of diluted UCB). Add 15 mL of density gradient media (see Table of Materials) to each tube and dispense the diluted UCB on the top of the density gradient media creating two layers.\nNOTE: Dispense the diluted UCB very slowly while holding the tube at a 45° angle to prevent mixing of the density gradient media layer with the UCB.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 30 min at a low acceleration and deceleration rate. After centrifugation, MNCs locate in the white layer (buffy coat) between the plasma and density gradient media layer.\nSlowly aspirate 2/3 of the plasma without disturbing the buffy coat layer. Carefully transfer the buffy coat layer into a new 50 mL tube. Collect all MNCs from the same UCB unit into a 50 mL tube until reaching 25 mL. Use a new tube if the volume of collected MNCs exceeds 25 mL.",
    "Add 25 mL of cold PBS into the tube containing 25 mL of MNCs and mix well. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nNOTE: Cold PBS is important to prevent capping of antibodies on the cell surface and reduce non-specific labeling.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and gently re-suspend the cell pellet in 50 mL of cold PBS.\nRemove 20 μL of the cell suspension for counting. Count the cell number stained with acridine orange/propidium iodide staining by using an automated cell counter. Calculate the total number of MNCs.\nNOTE: The cell count can be also performed by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nNOTE: If not required immediately, MNCs can be frozen at this stage.\n3. Isolation of CD34+ Cells from UCBs\nPrepare the CD34+ antibody coupled with magnetic beads solution for isolation of CD34+ cells from MNCs. Mix 300 µL of separation buffer with 100 µL of human FcR human IgG (blocking reagent) and 100 µL of CD34 magnetic beads for isolation of CD34+ cells from each 108 MNCs. For isolation of a higher number of CD34+ cells from (>108) MNCs, scale up reagents accordingly.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant from the tube centrifuged at step 2.8. Resuspend the pellet in the CD34 magnetic beads solution prepared in step 3.1 (use 500 µL of solution per 108 cells).\nMix gently and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.\nNOTE: Prepare the cell separator device (see Table of Materials) during the incubation period. Replace the storage solution with the working buffer as indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions and run a washing program followed by a rinsing program.",
    "Add cold cell separator running buffer to the tube containing the cell mixture until the tube is fully filled. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in cold cell separator running buffer (2 mL/108 cells). Transfer the 2 mL of cell suspension mixture into 15 mL tubes.\nLoad 3 sets of 15 mL tubes into the cell separator rack prechilled at 4 °C. One set of tubes contains MNCs, the second set of tubes will be used to collect the negative fraction and the third set of tubes will be used to collect purified CD34+ cells.\nLoad the rack into the cell separator device and run the posseld2 preset program.\nNOTE: An alternative method that utilizes manual magnetic separator can be used to replace the cell separator device12 .\nCentrifuge tubes with the positive fraction at 400 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend purified CD34+ cells in 1 mL of serum-free media.\nCount the cells stained with acridine orange/propidium iodide using an automated cell counter.\nNOTE: If not required immediately, purified CD34+ cells can be frozen at this stage.\n4. VPA Ex Vivo Expansion of purified UCB-CD34+ Cells\nPrepare sufficient volume of media to plate the purified CD34+ cells at a density of 3.3 x 104 cells/mL. The culture media composition is serum Free culture medium (see Table of Materials) supplemented with 10 µL/mL pen/strep, 150 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF), 100 ng/mL fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT3 ligand), 100 ng/mL thrombopoietin (TPO), and 50 ng/mL interleukin 3 (IL-3).\nPlate purified CD34+ cells in a 12-well plate (5 x 104 CD34+ cells/ 1.5 mL of media/ well) and culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.",
    "Assess the purity of isolated CD34+ cells and cell composition by FACS analysis as described below in step 6.3.\nAdd VPA at a final concentration of 1 mM into the cultures of cells treated for 16 h with cytokine cocktail.\nCulture the cells for an additional 7 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nNOTE: Media remains unchanged during the duration of the ex vivo expansion.\n5. Antibody Staining for Flow Cytometry Analysis\nPrepare antibody-staining solution to stain 2 x 104–6 x 104 cells and isotype solution to determine FACS gating strategy and determine the level of non-specific binding. Dilute antibodies (1/100 APC anti-CD34, 1/200 FITC anti-CD90) and the respective isotypes into 50 µL of separation buffer (composition of separation buffer is defined in step 1.1).\nNOTE: Perform single staining of cells with each antibody for a FMO gating strategy. Total antibody compensation bead kit (see Table of Materials) can be used for compensation setup.\nHomogenize the cell culture by pipetting multiple times. Count cells and pipet 5 x 104 cells into a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 1 mL of separation buffer and centrifuge at 400 x g for 15 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 µL of the staining solution. Incubate cells for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 450 µL of separation buffer and centrifuge at 400 x g for 15 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of separation buffer. Keep cells on ice for at least 5 min until performing FACS analysis. Add 1 µL of 7-AAD to gate viable cells.\nLoad the stained cell sample on the FACS machine and acquire cells at the lowest flow rate.",
    "For each fluorophore, analyze the isotype controls and single stained cells to set up gating for FITC (CD90), APC (CD34), and PerCP/Cy5.5 (7-AAD) staining.\nGate PerCP/Cy5.5 negative fraction and plot APC vs FITC to determine the percent of viable CD34+, CD90+, and CD34+CD90+ cells that defines the HSPC/HSC population in the culture.\n6. Antibody Staining for Flow Cytometry Cell Sorting\nResuspend the expanded cells by pipetting multiple times. Count the cell number and transfer the whole culture into a 15 mL or 50 mL tube.\nFill up the tube with cold separation buffer\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nPrepare antibody-staining solution to stain 5 x 105­–2 x 106 cells and isotype solution to stain 1 x 105 cells and determine FACS gating. Dilute 1/10 (APC anti-CD34), 1/20 (FITC-CD90) antibodies and the corresponding isotypes into 500 µL of separation buffer per each condition.\nPrepare the single color compensation controls using a total antibody compensation bead kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\nTransfer the supernatant from step 5.2 into a new tube and keep it at 37 °C. This culture media will be reused to culture the sorted cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet in cold separation buffer to obtain a concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ mL.
