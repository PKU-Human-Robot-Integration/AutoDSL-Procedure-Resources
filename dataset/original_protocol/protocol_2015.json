In this protocol, two mice (one WT and the other ataxin-1 KO) are used to prepare brain slices.\nNote: The overall goal of this procedure is to prepare healthy brain slices from mature adult mice that are suitable for pharmacology and electrophysiology experiments. This brain slice preparation, from mice of virtually of any age, allows researchers to explore changes in gene expression up to 2 days after application of drugs/chemicals in the slice culture.\nCritical: Good handling and quick transition between the steps of the procedure is desired. Individual slices should reach their new culture dish quickly without much time outside of the oxygenated aCSF. Once the slices are in their temporal incubation chambers the next mouse may be started at step 8 allowing for the sectioning of multiple mouse brains for a single experiment. Entire time from anaesthetizing a mouse for decapitation (step 8) to transfer for brain slice to temporal dish (step 14) may be completely within 30 min. Two mouse brains can be sliced and processed in a single experiment without compromising culture quality.\nPlace 500 mL aCSF in −20°C freezer and chill until ice-cold (< 4°C). Avoid over-freezing as this can change osmolarity of the solution.\nPrepare all sterile instruments for surgery and dissection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1610-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

One big culture dish is for temporal incubation and two small dishes are for incubation up to 2 days.\n(B) Stone cylinder producing air bubbles in aCSF solution.",
    "(C) 5-ports manifolds with female luer locks controlling oxygenation level in the culture.\n(D) Folded filter paper that keep brain slices from different mice separate.\n(E) Brain slice sectioning within ice-cold chamber. ∗, bubbling blue tube to oxygenate in the chamber.\n(F) Coronally sectioned brain slices.\nPlace a large glass or plastic Petri dish (150 mm-diameter) on ice, place the round filter paper on the bottom.\nSet a small micro-bubbler oxygen diffuser connected to a gas tank via flexible tubing and 5-ports manifold (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1C).\nAdd 150 mL of ice-cold aCSF. Oxygenate the aCSF solution with 95% O2/5% CO2 gas.\nThis Petri dish is used for brain dissection only.\nInstall one additional glass or plastic Petri dish (150 mm-diameter) as described in step 3. This large Petri dish is used for temporal incubation of brain slices (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Oxygenation level in the culture dish is persistently controlled by 5-ports manifold with female luer locks to avoid excessive bubbling (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nIn the dish prepared in step 4, put a round filter paper that is folded to make a separation barrier in the middle, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D. This folded-barrier is useful to separate brain slices from WT to those from ataxin-1 KO mice.\nPrepare two additional plastic Petri dishes (100 mm-diameter) as described in steps 4–5 for a long-term slice incubation.\nDilute 37.5 μL stock Act-D solution in 75 mL aCSF solution to make 10 μM final concentration.\nDilute 37.5 μL DMSO solution in 75 mL aCSF solution to make vehicle control.\nIn each Petri dish, pour either the vehicle (DMSO) or Act-D CSF solution.\nCover Petri dishes with corresponding plastic lids. Cover the entire culture dishes with dark fabric and/or aluminum foil to prevent light exposure and keep them at room temperature (20°C–22°C).",
    "Note: The plastic lids should have a small open space at the edge to allow plastic tubing that supplies oxygen to the culture to pass though.\nSet a vibratome (Leica VT-1000S) to cut brain at 375–400 μm thickness (375 μm for older, 400 μm for younger mice).\nUse the cutting brain speed at ∼ 0.25 mm/s and blade sectioning (vibration) frequency ∼ 90 Hz.\nBlade return stroke is performed at constant speed of 5 mm/s.\nFill the slicing chamber of the vibratome with ice-cold aCSF solution and oxygenate it carefully (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nFill the tray surrounding the slicing chamber with a slurry of ice and water to keep it cool.\nPlace a razor blade in the blade holder.\nAnaesthetize one adult WT mouse with isoflurane, decapitate and remove the brain rapidly.\nPlace the brain in the dissection Petri dish on ice that contains oxygenated ice-cold aCSF. For coronal sectioning, cut off the cerebellum and a small prefrontal cortex part (∼ 3 mm) with a razor blade.\nAttach the brain onto the specimen disc of vibratome with fast adhesive glue at cerebellum-cut side (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F). Orient dorsal side to face the razor blade.\nNote: A piece of agar fixed with adhesive glue on the specimen disc and placed on the ventral-side of brain provides additional support during slice cutting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). It is recommended that the agar block is 1–2 mm taller than the dissected brain to provide support.\nDefine the start and stop positions of the slicing, and slice down the brain with the vibratome. Usually, one brain produces 8–12 coronally sectioned 375–400 μm-thick slices (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nUpon completion of the sectioning, gently transfer individual brain slices with wide-mouthed transfer pipet to the temporal incubation dish filled with oxygenated prechilled aCSF (prepared at step 4).",
    "In the temporal incubation dish, arrange the brain slices on one side of the peak-folded filter paper in a sequence from anterior to posterior direction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1610-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Brain slice culture chemical agent treatment and incubation\n(A) Slices arranged from anterior to posterior side of a mouse brain. Size bar = 1 cm.\n(B) WT and ataxin-1 KO brain slices are treated with vehicle control (left) or chemical agent (e.g., Act-D; right) and incubated with oxygenation.\nTo obtain brain slices from ataxin-1 KO mouse, repeat steps 9–14. Ice-cold aCSF in the vibratome should be changed. When transferring the ataxin-1 KO slices to temporal incubation dishes, place them on the other side on the filter paper (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: One or two brain slices from WT and ataxin-1 KO mice are used to measure initial electrophysiological activity in hippocampal CA1 before the start of slice culture (steps 21–28). Use the remaining aCSF for perfusion solution.\nBrain slice culture to analyze mRNA stability: Actinomycin D treatment\nTiming: 0.5–1 h for Act-D treatment; 48 h for culture incubation\nThis section describes how to apply aCSF solution containing either Act-D or vehicle to brain slices and maintain the treated slice cultures up to 2 days.\nCritical: To minimize variation in culture condition, brain slices from two mice (i.e., WT and ataxin-1 KO) to be compared are maintained side-by-side throughout the incubation within same culture dishes.\nFor each brain slices kept in temporal dish (prepared at steps 14 and 15), from anterior to posterior, assign numbers (e.g., WT1, WT2, …, KO1, KO2, …).\nTransfer brain slices of WT mice to incubation culture dishes.\nTransfer the odd-numbered brain slices on to the left side of filter paper barrier (peak) in the long-term slice incubation culture dish that contains vehicle control.",
    "Transfer the remaining even-numbered brain slices on to the left side of filter paper in the other long-term slice incubation culture dish that contains Act-D (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The two sets of coronally-sectioned brain slices from one mouse, divided half by this way (even- or odd-numbered; 4–6 slices each), are very comparable to each other in their structural composition. This approach reduces experimental variations that are generated from different mice used in examining the effects of pharmacological agents (vehicle vs. Act-D) on cultured brain slices.\nTransfer brain slices of ataxin-1 KO mice to incubation culture dishes.\nTransfer the odd-numbered brain slices on to the right side of filter paper barrier (peak) in the long-term slice incubation culture dish that contain vehicle control.\nTransfer the remaining even-numbered brain slices on to the right side of filter paper in the other long-term slice incubation culture dish that contains Act-D.\nNote: Brain slices from WT and ataxin-1 KO mice should not be mixed or confused. The separation of the two brain slice sets within a same culture dish can be maintained by a filter paper that has a folded barrier (peak) in the middle and by stones that hold down the filter paper (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Substantial physical impact on the dish or sudden move of the dish, which can cause detachment of the brain slices from filter papers and floating and mixing of the slices in the dish, should be avoided.\nCover the dishes with corresponding plastic lids to avoid excess evaporation. Cover the entire culture dishes with dark fabric and/or aluminum foil to block light as Act-D is sensitive to light. The slice cultures are incubated at room temperature (20°C–22°C).",
    "Critical: Maintaining continued oxygenation of the slice cultures throughout incubation period is essential. Make sure 95% O2/5% CO2 tank has plenty of gas for the entire incubation period.\n24 h after the start of incubation, replace 75% of the culture media with fresh prepared room temperature aCSF containing either vehicle or Act-D.\nTo avoid the floating and mixing of brain slices within culture dish, carefully and slowly take out the used media and add the new media with a Pasteur pipet from the edge of culture dish.\nSlice culture is incubated for 24 or 48 h before harvesting them for electrophysiological recordings or total RNA isolation.\nElectrophysiological setup and recordings\nTiming: 1–2 h per mouse\nThis section describes electrophysiological extracellular field recordings in individual slices (Dzhala et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), before and after the slice culture. One of the purposes of this procedure is to validate the neuronal action potential activity and suitability of the brain slices for ex vivo pharmacological experiments.\nPrepare setup for electrophysiological recordings.\nUse a flexible tubing to connect a leveling laboratory bottle (e.g., 1,000 mL Duran Aspirator bottle) outlet with a 1-way polycarbonate on/off stop valve for solution flow.\nFill up DURAN Aspirator (leveling) bottle with 500 mL aCSF. Continuously oxygenate the aCSF solution with 95% O2/5% CO2 gas.\nUse a flexible tubing to connect the leveling bottle with a single in-line solution heater (e.g., SF-27B, SF-28) and recording submersion-type chamber.\nSetup solution flow by gravity, flow rate control and temperature control at 32°C.\nFor electrophysiological recordings, transfer individual slice to a conventional submersion-type chamber (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B) and continuously superfuse with oxygenated aCSF at 32°C at a rate of 2 mL/min. Stabilize tissue brain slice using appropriate U-shape slice anchor made by platinum bar.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1610-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Size bar = 0.5 cm.\n(C) Dissected cortex and hippocampus from brain slice.\nUse commercial or custom-made tungsten microelectrodes for extracellular field potential recordings of multiple-unit activity (MUA) and population field potential activity.\nNote: Use of microelectrodes made from coated tungsten wire 50 μm in diameter enables simultaneous recordings of multiple-unit activity (MUA, 400 Hz high-pass filter) and population field activity (EEG band, 1–100 Hz) from tens to hundreds of neurons near each electrode. Root-mean-square noise level with an electrode placed in the perfusion solution is typically 4–5 μV, whereas the amplitude of action potentials recorded from the stratum pyramidale ranges from this noise level up to 200 μV.\nAttach the electrodes to the electrode holders of the amplifier head-stages and turn into position (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nUse fine micromanipulators to position the recording electrodes to the area of interest within the brain slice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nOnce electrode is in contact with healthy pyramidal cell layer, monitor extracellular field potential activity using computer-controlled software.\nPerform extracellular field potential recordings of MUA using computer-controlled software (pCLAMP version 10.3 or higher, Molecular Devices) and data acquisition (analog-to-digital converter Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices).\nPerform data analysis and statistical comparison of the data. Optional, use Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft), and Origin (OriginLab Corporation) programs for data analysis. Determine the amplitude and frequency of MUA from high-pass filtered (400 Hz) raw data with a spike detection algorithm (Mini Analysis Program) and verify visually (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1610-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

During the slice transfer and dissection, aCSF does not need to be oxygenated.\nTo avoid mixing the slices from different mice, transfer WT and ataxin-1 KO slices to separate dishes.\nTransfer vehicle- and Act-D treated slices to different dishes. So, the brain slices from two incubation dishes are now divided into four for dissection.\nKeep the dishes containing the brain slice on ice during the dissection.\nUsing forceps, cut out cortex from brain slices under dissection microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Here, the cortex is dissected out for further mRNA analysis as it exhibits, among several brain regions, the most distinct difference in steady-state Bace1 mRNA level between WT and ataxin-1 KO mice. Other brain regions (e.g., hippocampus or striatum) can be dissected if needed.\nRemove aCSF droplets from dissected cortex with Kimwipe tissue paper.\nPut cortex pieces into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and keep on dry ice to freeze.\nRepeat step from steps 31 to 33 until all brain slices are dissected.\nPause point: Dissected brain slice piece samples (e.g., cortex) can be stored at −80°C until use.\nIsolation of total RNA\nTiming: 4–6 h for 20 brain slices",
    "This section describes how to isolate total RNA with Trizol reagent from mouse brain slice pieces (e.g., cortex) for subsequent RT-qPCR analysis. Total RNA can be isolated by other methods, such as utilizing RNeasy Kits (QIAGEN).\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold Trizol reagent into 1 mL-size Dounce homogenizer.\nPut pieces of cortex from one brain slice into the Trizol reagent.\nGrind the tissue pieces with a tight pestle for 20 strokes up and down with twist.\nFollow Trizol reagent manufacturer’s instruction to isolate total RNA (Invitrogen, www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/product-brand/trizol.html[href=http://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/product-brand/trizol.html]). DNase treatment is not needed. Briefly,\nIncubate for 5 min to allow complete dissociation of the tissue lysates.\nAdd 0.2 mL chloroform and vortex for 30 s.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4°C.\nTransfer the upper clear aqueous phase (400 μL) that contains RNA to a new tube.\nAdd equal volume (400 μL) of isopropanol to the aqueous phase and vortex for 10 s.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice and centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4°C.\nNote: Incubation on ice for longer time helps the precipitation of the relatively small amount of RNA from brain slice pieces. After centrifugation, total RNA precipitate forms a white pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nCarefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and add 1 mL 75% ethanol to the remaining pellet.\nRinse the pellet with the 75% ethanol solution by inverting the tube several times.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 13,000 × g at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.\nAir-dry RNA pellet on 70°C heat block until no remaining solution is visible in the tube.",
    "Note: Avoid over-drying (> 3 min) the RNA pellet. Over-drying may impede the resuspension of RNA pellet in nuclease-free water in the subsequent step. It may also cause poor RNA quality.\nResuspend RNA pellet (invisible) with 15 μL nuclease-free water.\nPause point: Isolated RNA samples can be stored at −80°C until use.\nRNA integrity can be assessed by the detection of distinct 28S and 18S rRNA bands in 1% agarose gel running.\nNote: The weight of all cortical piece from one coronally sectioned brain slice is ∼10 mg. Total RNA amount isolated from the cortical piece is ∼4–8 μg.\nRT-qPCR analysis of Bace1 mRNA\nTiming: 4–6 h for 20 RNA samples\nDilute each RNA samples to 250 ng/μL concentration in nuclease-free distilled water.\nSet up reverse transcription (RT) reaction in a 96-well PCR plate as indicated in the table below.\nTo run RT reaction for multiple RNA samples, make a master mix that includes all reagents except RNA.\nFor RT reaction, iScript Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kits is used (refer to “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”).\nTo assess any genomic DNA or PCR product contamination, control RT reaction (no RT) that does not contain reverse transcriptase should be included.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1610_5.csv\nRun the RT reaction for 20 min at 46°C followed by 10°C holding in a PCR machine (CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System).\nTransfer all the RT products into new Eppendorf tubes.\nPause point: RT product samples can be stored at −80°C until use.\nFor each RT product, set up Bace1 cDNA qPCR reaction in a 96-well PCR plate as indicated in table below.\nTo run qPCR reaction for multiple RT products, make a master mix that includes all reagents except RT products.\nThe PCR reactions should be performed in duplicate or triplicate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1610_6.csv",
    "Within same 96-well PCR plate, set up Gapdh cDNA qPCR reactions as described for Bace1 cDNA qPCR (step 44). Gapdh expression level is used as control to calculate ΔCt (threshold cycle) values.\nNote: In this protocol, qPCR reactions for Bace1 and Gapdh are run in separate PCR reaction wells. However, both qPCR reactions for one RT product can be run within same well by adding 1 μl each of TaqMan assay solution that includes forward and reverse PCR primers of corresponding genes and fluorescent probes. For this multiplex qPCR reaction, the amount of nuclease-free water is reduced from 7 to 6 μl for each qPCR reaction.\nRun qPCR reaction as indicated in table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1610_7.csv\nDetermine Ct values for Bace1 and Gapdh, based on the earliest cycles of exponential phase of the PCR reactions. Get an average of Ct value for each target gene (e.g., Bace1) from duplicate or triplicate PCR reactions.\nCalculate ΔCt value of each target mRNA. For example, ΔCt(Bace1) = Ct(Bace1) – Ct(Gapdh). Calculate the average of ΔCt values for each treatment group (e.g., 0 h_WT). Details of qPCR result analysis can also be found at https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center.html].\nCalculate ΔΔCt values of each sample. ΔΔCt value is calculated based on the control experimental group (e.g., 0 h_WT). For example, ΔΔCt (Bace1_24 h_KO_VH) = average of ΔCt (0 h_WT) – ΔCt (Bace1_24 h_KO_VH).\nCalculate 100 × 2ΔΔCt value of each sample and analyze the results.\nAverage of 100 × 2ΔΔCt (0 h_WT) will be assign as 100 as control group (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1610-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

For the analysis of nascent mRNA, brain slices were incubated for 3 h in aCSF containing 5-ethynyl uridine.\nThe relative amount of Bace1 mRNA in each sample will be 100 × 2ΔΔCt. For example, the relative amount of Bace1 mRNA in 24 h_KO_VH sample will be 100 × 2ΔΔCt (24 h_KO_VH).\nAnalyze 100 × 2ΔΔCt values of each treatment group at each time point (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nAnalyze ratios of Bace1 mRNA levels between ataxin-1 KO and WT in vehicle or Act-D treatment group at each time point (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nBrain slice culture to analyze mRNA synthesis: 5 ethynyl uridine (5EU) treatment\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes how to apply aCSF solution containing either 5EU or vehicle to brain slices to measure newly synthesized mRNA. For the 5EU treatment and subsequent nascent mRNA isolation (Steps from 51 to 69), we utilized Click-iT Nascent RNA Capture Kit (Refer to “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”).\nCritical: To minimize variation in culture conditions (e.g., exposure to 5EU), brain slices from two mice (i.e., WT and ataxin-1 KO) to be compared are maintained side-by-side within same culture dishes throughout the incubation.",

To achieve this concentration, put 4–6 cortex pieces of same treatment group (e.g., 16 h-WT) in 1 mL Trizol reagent when isolating total RNA and resuspend the resulting RNA pellet in 15 μL distilled nuclease-free water. Approximately 20–40 μg of total RNA could be obtained from this preparation.\nDilute the RNA into 1 μg/μL and use 10 μg RNA for one Click-iT reaction.\nPrepare Click-iT reaction cocktail (50 μL per reaction) according to Table below.

    "Wash the beads additional 5 times with 500 μL Click-iT reaction wash buffer 2.\nResuspend the beads in 50 μL of Click-iT reaction wash buffer 2 and proceed immediately to cDNA synthesis using the RNA captured on beads as a template.\nNote: At this point, the beads are ready to be used in a cDNA synthesis reaction. Do not store the RNA for future use.\ncDNA synthesis of the nascent RNA and qPCR\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis section describes how to synthesize cDNA from the RNA bound to beads (from step 69) as a template. For the reverse transcription reaction to generate first-strand cDNA, we utilized SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). This cDNA synthesis kit utilizes random primers for reverse transcription. Below are the brief steps for one RNA sample from brain slice culture. For more RT reactions, scale up the volumes accordingly.\nPrepare reverse transcription reaction from the bead-bound RNA. Table below lists the reaction components and their recommended volumes for a 100 μL cDNA synthesis reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1610_10.csv\nHeat the RNA-bound bead suspension (step 69) from at 70°C for 5 min.\nImmediately add 20 μL of 5× VILO reaction mix into each bead suspension tube and mix it by pipetting up and down.\nBring the reaction mixture to room temperature (20°C–22°C) and gently mix for 5 min on a laboratory vertical rotating mixer.\nAdd 20 μL of nuclease free water to the reaction mixture.\nAdd 10 μL of 10× SuperScript Enzyme mix to the reaction mixture. Mix the reaction well by pipetting it up and down.\nIncubate the reaction at 46°C for 1 h. Mix gently the reaction tube to prevent the beads from settling during the incubation.",
    "Heat the reaction mixture at 85°C for 5 min to terminate the RT reaction and to release the cDNA from the beads.\nUse magnetic separation rack to immobilize the beads and transfer the supernatant containing the cDNA to a new tube.\nNote: The RT product can be stored at –80°C until further use.\nProceed to qPCR for BACE1 and GAPDH as described in steps 44–50 at “RT-qPCR analysis of Bace1 mRNA[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6].” qPCR for ATXN1 can be used as control for ataxin-1 KO and WT samples. To assess any genomic DNA or PCR product contamination, control RT reaction (no RT) that does not contain reverse transcriptase may be included."
