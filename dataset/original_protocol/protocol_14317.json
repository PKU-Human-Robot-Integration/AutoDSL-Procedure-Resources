    "The institutional committee for animal care at the University of Yamanashi approved all the protocols and the use of experimental animals stated herein. Human sample usage was approved by the institutional ethics board at the University of Yamanashi.\n1. Solid tissue preparation\nNOTE: Samples must be kept on ice after their removal from the animal or human body to preserve the tissue freshness. If measurements do not immediately follow dissection, it is recommended to store tissue at -80 °C. It is not advisable to place the tissue in any kind of buffer or saline, because they may extract certain contents from the tissue. Tissue that has been fixed with aldehydes or embedded in paraffin/wax or cryogel is not suitable for MS measurements.\nCut the tissue specimen to approximately 2 x 2 x 2 mm using a scalpel or knife. Alternatively, punch out the sample with a trepan (a disposable biopsy punch, bore size 3 mm) used for the skin examination. In this case, trim the length of the column to 2 mm.\n\tNOTE: Any tissue can be analyzed using this method. In this experiment, liver15 and kidney19, have been successfully analyzed to obtain mass spectra. Generally, parenchymal organs give good mass spectra, while those that have fibrous components do not.\nIf the tissue is contaminated with blood, wash briefly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.\n\tNOTE: To minimize the postmortem tissue damage, complete this step, as soon as possible, at room temperature. If measurements are not made immediately, snap freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\nPlace the cut or punched out sample (approximately 10 mg) into a plastic microtube and add 100 µL of 50% ethanol.",
    "NOTE: The exact weight of samples is not determined because the mass spectrometry used in this system does not provide quantitative data. Approximately 10 mg is optimal for the parenchymal tissue.\nHomogenize the sample using a micropestle.\nPlace 10 µL of the homogenate into the well of the cartridge (Figure 2).\nPlace the cartridge in the ionization chamber of the mass spectrometer and install the stainless-steel needle probe that will be used for the sample ionization (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Probe needles are supplied by the manufacturer. They are made of stainless steel and have a curvature radius of approximately 400 nm.\nClose the chamber lid firmly to automatically activate the safety device.\nStart the on-board computer by clicking the Start icon to analyze. Using the onscreen panels, apply a voltage of 2.3 kV to the needle to generate the electrospray and ensure that the frequency of needle is 3 Hz.\nWait for 30 s for the measurement to be completed.\n\tNOTE: The session automatically ceases when data acquisition is completed. The quality of the analysis is monitored by a total ion chromatogram (TIC). The measurement time is defined to obtain the representative mass spectra and can be shortened or extended.\nDispose of the cartridge and needle in a biohazard disposer after measuring each sample.\n\tNOTE: Only one sample can be measured at a time. It is not necessary to calibrate the machine before every measurement; calibration depends on the regular check-up by the supplier once every six months.\nAnalyze the mass spectra and export the mass spectral text data using the software associated with the mass spectrometer (see Table of Materials) as stated in the steps below (Figure 3).\n\t\nClick on the lcd file in the data file browser window of the software.",
    "Choose and click on a single peak on the mass spectrum window and to automatically depict an extracted ion chromatogram (EIC).\nCheck the TIC and EIC and click on the average spectrum icon to select the range-of-time window for generating the mass spectrum.\n\t\tNOTE: In this analysis, the target molecules appear in the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) window (Figure 3). Furthermore, because the duration of the ionization per single stroke of needle movement is very short, all the mass spectra obtained are essentially averaged spectra over 10 s (300 scans).\nGenerate a text file containing m/z and ion intensity by clicking on the Export tab for further analysis. This text file can be stored in any folder.\n\t\tNOTE: Any RNA preservatives will affect the native spectral pattern of samples. In addition, it is advisable to handle and store tissue without any liquid (such as phosphate-buffered saline) to prevent the elution of molecular components from the tissue into the liquid during storage. Ideally, fresh or fresh frozen samples without any treatment are used.\n2. Body fluids (serum) preparation\nNOTE: This whole procedure is almost identical to that used for solid tissue. The cartridge for the fluid sample is available from the manufacturer. Because the contamination by red blood cells (RBCs) can greatly diminish the efficiency of spectral acquisition of the intended component (plasma or serum), be sure to eliminate all RBCs by centrifuging before measurements.\nTake 10 µL of the serum sample and put it into a 1.5 mL microtube.\n\tNOTE: Both fresh and stored serum can be used.\nAdd 190 µL of 50% ethanol to the 1.5 mL tube, then vortex for 2 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the liquid at 15,000 x g for 1-5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer 10 µL of supernatant into the well of the cartridge.",
    "Place the cartridge in the ionization chamber of the machine and install the stainless steel needle probe that will be used for sample ionization (Figure 2).\nClose the chamber lid firmly to automatically activate the safety device.\nStart the on-board computer by clicking the Start icon to ionize.\nDiscard the sample cartridge and needle as described in 1.10 once measurements have been taken.\nAnalyze the obtained sets of EIC as stated below (Figure 3).\n\t\nOpen the lcd file on the data browser.\nClick on a single peak to display the TIC and EIC.\nSelect the range-of-time window for generating mass spectra using the average spectrum icon.\nExport the generated file containing both the m/z and ion intensity of a corresponding peak by clicking the export tab on the monitor.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure can be applied to saliva, urine, and other body fluids as well.\n3. Preparation for in vivo PESI-MS in living organism\nNOTE: In this section, an application to monitor the metabolic profile of 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (5-FdU) in a living mouse model is introduced. Use aseptic conditions throughout.\nInfuse 100 µL of 100 mM 5-FdU solution into the tail vein of a 2-month-old mouse (approximately 20 g weight).\n\tNOTE: There is no preference for sex, age, or mouse strain. While this protocol was approved at the time that we carried out the experiment5, the feasibility of this experiment depends on the ethical restrictions of the country in which it will be performed.\nAnesthetize the mouse following your approved animal care protocol. Assess the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to tail pinching.\n\tNOTE: If the usage of sodium pentobarbital is not permitted by the ethical committee for animal experiments, alternative methods may be used, such as ketamine hydrochloride.",
    "Shave the abdominal cavity using an electric razor and apply vet ointment to the eyes.\nPut the anesthetized mouse in a supine position and fix the paws onto the plastic plate using mending tape. Scrub the surgical site with scrubs of 70% alcohol three times.\nCut open the abdominal cavity using scissors. First, cut the skin laterally (10 mm) from just above the diaphragm. Laterally cut the muscle of the abdominal body wall and peritoneum (ca. 7 mm) and hold the wound open using stainless wire to expose the liver surface.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to perfuse the surface of the liver.\nApply the tip of the probe needle to the surface of the liver. Adjust the depth of the needle to approximately 0.5 mm deep to optimize ionization efficiency, checking the TIC and spectral pattern simultaneously. Set the high voltage to 2.3 kV and frequency to 3 Hz on the screen of the control panel.\nRemove the animal from the plastic plate.\nSuture the wound using a surgical gut suture and return the mouse to the cage. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it has regained consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return the mouse to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\nPerform the time course of ion intensity in EIC and the procedure of EIC depiction as in 1.11.1 to 1.11.4.\nSubscription Required.
