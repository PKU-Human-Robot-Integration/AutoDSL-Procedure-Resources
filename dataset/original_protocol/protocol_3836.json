    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of cells\nTiming: variable 24–48 h\n12 mm cover glass should be placed in a 100 mm glass petri dish, autoclaved followed by drying at 37°C in a heating oven for 16h–24 h.\nPlace two sterile 12 mm cover glass in each well of a six-well culture plate, the final percentage of cell confluency should not be over 70 %.\nPlate 2 × 105 cells per well in 2 mL of culture medium.\nCritical: High confluency of cells will lead to inhibition of eIF4F complex formation. Cell density is therefore an important parameter that impacts on the number of translation initiation complex in live cells. The optimal number of cells to be plated should be tested. When using different cell line models, we firstly perform a serial dilution of cell numbers. For example, for a six-well plate, we plated 1×104, 5×104, 1×105 and 2 × 105 A375 cells for overnight culture. Then cells were trypsinised and counted. The proliferation rate was estimated for 16 h. The confluency of cells for PLA assay should not be over ∼60%.\nLeave the newly plated cells under the hood for 5 min with minimum vibrations to allow the cells to attach on the cover glasses. Incubate cells for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Critical: It is important to make sure that you have properly mixed the cells in each well, no obvious cell aggregates should be present in the cell suspension. The cells should be checked before the incubation at 37°C to make sure that the suspended cells are homogeneously distributed in each well. When this is confirmed, do not further shake the plate until the cells are attached. Non-homogeneous distribution of cells in the well leads to different cell densities at different positions, creating artificial differences in the number of eIF4F translation initiation complex in cells on the same well.\nAfter 24 h (or overnight) growth, the cells can follow the subsequent steps, or can be treated with different perturbations (for example drug treatment).\nCritical: Before continuing the experiment, we suggest to check again under microscope to be sure that cell distribution is homogeneous --- no obvious cell clusters are present in each well.\nFixation and permeabilization of cells\nTiming: 50 min\nTo remove the cover glass from the culture medium, we make a “L” shape of needle from an insulin syringe to detach the cover glass from the bottom, and take it gently with a surgical forceps avoiding to break the cover glass. Upon taking out the cover glass immediately after studied drug treatment, for example, combimetinib treatment in this protocol. Dry the cover glass on a piece of paper by touching the edge of the cover glass on a filter paper.\nPrepare a slide covered with parafilms and place it in a 10 mm petri dish. Then place the cover glass on a pre-prepared parafilm. Add 30 μL 4% PFA immediately onto the cover glass under a chemical hood. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/752-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Fixation setup",
    "Spread parafilm on a Petri dish. Load the briefly dried coverslip onto the parafilm. Pipette 40 μL of 4% PFA solution on to the coverslip and stay at room temperature for 10 min. This allows minimum volume of solution used for the procedures and quick fixation upon removal of the samples from culture medium.\nCritical: Translation initiation through the eIF4F complex is quickly regulated by different stress signaling cues. Therefore, quick fixation of the cells allows to minimizing the artifact induced by manipulation.\nPrepare a 24-well plate by adding 1.5 mL 1× PBS in each well.\nRecover the cover glass on a filter paper, remove the 4% PFA solution by touching the edge of the cover glass on a filter paper. Please make sure that the face of the slide with cells is exposed upwards. Draw a circle with an Immedge hydrophobic barrier pen around the cover glass. Place the cover glass in a prepared 24-well plate filled with 1.5 mL 1× PBS for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently remove the PBS solution with a vacuum pump.\nTo permeabilize the fixed cells, add 30 μL of 1× PBS Tween-20 0.2% solution for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd 1.5 mL of a 1× PBS solution in each well without removing the 1× PBS Tween-20 0.2% solution and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently remove the 1× PBS solution with a vacuum pump.\nAdd 30 μL of the Blocking Solution (Sigma Aldrich, Olink, DUO92001) on each cover glass. Incubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nPause Point: The cover glass with the blocking solution can be stored overnight at 4°C.\nPrimary antibody hybridization\nTiming: 60 min",
    "To detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction, dilute the two antibodies eIF4E (anti-mouse) and eIF4G (anti-rabbit) 1:500 as the final dilution in the antibody diluent of the same tube. Alternatively, to detect the eIF4E-4EBP1 interaction, dilute the two antibodies eIF4E (anti-mouse) and 4EBP1 (anti-rabbit) 1:500 in the antibody diluent.\nCritical: The concentration and species source of the primary antibody are essential for the detection of protein-protein interactions, as we discussed previously. Therefore, to choose the appropriate antibodies for the PLA assay, one should perform in advance both a positive and a negative control. For example, we used the same dilution condition for eIF4E antibody alone or eIF4G antibody alone for primary antibody hybridization followed by proximity ligation probe hybridization with PLA probe Mouse Plus and PLA probe Mouse Minus for eIF4E detection; in the same sense, we used PLA probe Rabbit Plus and PLA probe Rabbit Minus for eIF4G detection. This will allow us to determine if the primary antibody is suitable for PLA assay. For a negative control in the aim of avoiding any non-specific background signals, we used two PLA probes Mouse Plus for eIF4E and two PLA probe Rabbit Plus for eIF4G. The same coupled oligonucleotides will not allow the ligation between them, therefore, any signals detected under this condition should be considered as non-specific background.\nAdd a solution of 1× PBS in each well without removing the blocking solution and gently/immediately aspirate with vacuum pump.\nAdd 30 μL of the corresponding primary antibody solution on the cover glass. Incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nNote: Do not allow the sample to dry. Fill with a solution of 1× PBS in non-used wells within the 24-well plate.",
    "Add 1.5 mL of Wash Buffer A in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed (For the shaker that we are using, the speed is at 64 rpm). Remove the wash buffer with vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: The Wash buffer is conserved at 4°C. Before using, it should be recovered at room temperature during ∼30 min to reach the room temperature.\nProximity ligation probe hybridization\nTiming: 60 min\nDilute the two PLA probes Mouse Plus and Rabbit Minus stock solutions in antibody diluent to 1:5.\nAlternatives: the PLA probes could be applicable with Mouse Minus and Rabbit Plus.\nAdd 30 μL of the PLA probes mixed solution on the cover glass. Incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nAdd 1.5 mL of the Wash Buffer A in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed (For the shaker that we are using, the speed is at 64 rpm). Remove the wash buffer with vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: During the washing step, one should start to prepare the ligation solution at room temperature for the next step.\nOligonucleotide ligation\nTiming: 45 min\nAt the second time of the previous step, prepare the ligation reaction solution as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_752_5.csv\nNote: Ligase should stay on ice block. However, the prepared mix should stay at room temperature.\nGently remove the wash buffer A with a vacuum pump after the second time of previous step.\nAdd 30 μL of the ligation reaction mix on the cover glass. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C.",
    "Add 1.5 mL of the Wash Buffer A in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed (For the shaker that we are using, the speed is at 64 rpm). Remove the wash buffer with a vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: During the washing step, one should start to prepare the rolling cycle amplification solution at room temperature for the next step, and make sure that the amplification solution is protected from light.\nRolling cycle amplification\nTiming: 70 min\nAt the second time of the previous step, prepare the amplification reaction mix as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_752_6.csv\nNote: The amplification buffer contains fluorescent dyes and should be protected from light. The mix should stay at room temperature.\nGently remove the wash buffer A with a vacuum pump after the second time of previous step.\nAdd 30 μL of the amplification reaction mix on the cover glass. Incubate for 1.5 h at 37°C in the dark.\nAdd 1.5 mL of the Wash Buffer B in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed (For the shaker that we are using, the speed is at 64 rpm). Remove the wash buffer with a vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: The plate should be protected from light during this step.\nRolling cycle amplification washing\nTiming: 20 min\nGently remove the wash buffer B with a vacuum pump.\nAdd 1 mL of 1:100 wash buffer B diluted in high purity water.\nNote: Users can process the samples at this step for further immunostaining by using routine immunofluorescence or probe-based methods. Please avoid to perform further immunostaining without washing at least once with 1:100 diluted wash buffer B since high concentration of buffer B may diminish the antibody staining efficacy.\nRemove the cover glass on paper filter.",
    "Air-dry during 15 min.\nNote: Protect from light. Alternatively, the cover glass can be further processed for cytoplasmic staining or co-staining with immunofluorescence. Please avoid overly drying which will decrease the PLA signal intensity.\nSlide mounting\nTiming: 15–30 min\nAdd 2 μL of mounting medium with DAPI on each cover glass.\nReverse the cover glass to mount on a microscopic slide, gently press the top of cover glass with a syringe rubber to make sure that mounting medium spread all over the cover glass.\nNote: Avoid producing air bubbles in the process.\nSeal with nail polish. Alternatively, if one uses ProLong Glass antifade Mountant (#P36980, Thermo Fisher), sealing with nail polish is not necessary.\nPause Point: The slide can be stored at 4°C for long time before processing to microscopy image acquisition. In our laboratory, we have tested to store the slides for maximum 3 months at 4°C and we do not see obvious decrease of the fluorescence intensity.\nImage acquisition after nail polish sealing for at least 30 min.\nCritical: Do not freeze the slide. Freezing at −20°C or −80°C will create large crystal particles in the mounting medium which will influence the image acquisition quality.\nMicroscope setup and imaging\nTiming: variable 4–24 h\nThe following steps are described for automated slide scanning microscopic system. To be noted, manual microscope imaging is also suitable for eIF4F complex detection except that experimenters need to change each slide manually when the previous one is finished. We list the key parameters required for the image acquisition in the following tables:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_752_7.csv\nMount the slide onto the microscope stage:",
    "For large set of slide scanning and quantification of the relative number of translation initiation complex, we are using an Olympus Virtual Slide scanning system (VS120). This system allows fast acquisition of large data set with multiple levels of z stacks. Open the Control system VS-ASWFL on the computer. Select “Fluorescence Batch” button in the window of Batch Scan. The microscope will automatically scan the total number and positions of the slides.\nFor quantification of the absolute number of translation initiation complex, we are using a True Confocal Scanner (TCS) SPE Leica confocal microscope, with multiple levels of z stacks covering the whole thickness of the cells in 3-dimensions.\nNote: The image acquisition process depends on the microscopy system. You may need to optimize your acquisition process by following the instruction of your proper microscope system.\nSet up acquisition of z stacks, covering a thickness of the cells in an optimal way.\nIn the case of quantification of the relative number of translation initiation complex, acquire 3 levels of z stack with 1 μm each. The Olympus Virtual Slide scanner will automatically focus on the cell plane by using DAPI channel. The other two z stacks will be −1 μm and +1 μm corresponding to the auto-focus plane.\nIn the case of quantification of the absolute number of translation initiation complex, we acquire 20 z-stacks at each selected xy position in each wavelength channel with oil-immersion 63× objective, starting with Cy5, then DAPI. The distance between individual optical planes is 0.4 μm.",
    "Note: Illumination times should be adjusted for each slide to obtain optimal resolutions. Avoid excessive exposure time, since an observed saturation of pixel intensities will be detrimental for following image analysis. In particular, saturation of pixel intensities will artificially create point aggregates in the cells, this is not analyzable for the following quantification. In addition, overexposure will artificially decrease the number of spots counted by the software.\nAcquire overview of the slide with 4× objective in DAPI channel with 150 ms exposure time in the Olympus Virtual Slide scanner system.\nNote: The following steps only apply to the quantification of the relative number of translation initiation complex by using Olympus Virtual Slide scanner.\nSelect at least 3 scan positions on each cover glass of the slide.\nProcess image acquisition with 20× objective and mirror cube QUAD, starting with DAPI channel (450 nm) with 3 ms exposure time, then Cy5 channel (644 nm/670 nm) with 300 ms exposure time at 3 z stack planes.\nNote: If you are using different fluorescent tag for the detection of proximity ligation assay, please optimize the corresponding filter. The PLA fluorescence are available for four different colors. Apart from the Cy5 far red color used in this protocol, three additional fluorophores are also applicable. For green fluorescence, one should use a 495nm/527nm filter; For Cy3 orange fluorescence, one should use a 554nm/576nm filter; and for red fluorescence, one should use a 594nm/624nm filter.\nImage process and computational analysis\nTiming: variable 2–24 h\nExport image.",
    "Images acquired by Olympus Virtual Slide scanner are saved as VSI format. This format of image can be viewed with Olympus software OlyVIA. However, we adapted an ImageJ plugin module BIOP-tool (http://biop.epfl.ch/TOOL_VSI_Reader.html[href=http://biop.epfl.ch/TOOL_VSI_Reader.html]) for exporting TIFF images for following analysis. The detail manual of exporting images from VSI format can be found in BIOP-tool manual or on the website related to this protocol (https://sites.google.com/site/translationcomplexeif4f[href=https://sites.google.com/site/translationcomplexeif4f]).\nImages acquired by TCS SPE Leica confocal microscope are saved as TIFF format. Readers can download Demo Images in DAPI channel and Cy5 channel with 20 z stack planes on the website (https://sites.google.com/site/translationcomplexeif4f[href=https://sites.google.com/site/translationcomplexeif4f]). Open Images in the two channels as sequential images in ImageJ. Save the stacks of images as TIFF.\nImage analysis.\nFor quantification of the relative number of translation initiation complex, exported TIFF images can be opened with ImageJ software. Select Process/Binary/MakeBinary in the main menu of ImageJ to process the TIFF images into Binary format. After generating binary images, select Process/Filter/Median 2.0 in the main menu of ImageJ, followed by selecting Process/Binary/Watershed in the main menu to segment spots. You may process further by selecting Process/Binary/Find_Maxima in the main menu to exclude edge maxima, light background. The spot counting results are presented as medium ± standard deviation for 4 different images.\nFor quantification of the absolute number of translation initiation complex, a MATLAB-based software, FISH-Quant (Mueller et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), is used for 3-dimension quantification of spots. Demo images and software setup can be downloaded on the website related to this protocol (https://sites.google.com/site/translationcomplexeif4f[href=https://sites.google.com/site/translationcomplexeif4f])."
