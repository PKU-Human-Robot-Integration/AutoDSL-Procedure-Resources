    "1. Preparations for Microinjection and Electroporation in Ciona Eggs and Zygotes\nPrepare 10 L artificial seawater with HEPES (ASWH) for culturing of embryos. Dissolve 420 mM NaCl, 9 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 24.5 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 25.5 mM MgSO4·7H2O, and 2.15 mM NaHCO3 in double distilled water (ddH2O) by stirring overnight. Add 5 mM HEPES pH 8.0, and verify/adjust the pH to 8.0. Store the ASWH at 4 °C. Warm it up to 18 °C and filter it with filter paper before use.\nPrepare 20x inactivated dechorionation solution: 20% sodium thioglycolate, 1% pronase in ASWH. Store 500 µl aliquots at -20 °C, and dilute to a final volume of 10 ml ASWH before use.\nPrepare 15 to 20 culture dishes for the eggs/embryos. Pour melted 1% agarose in ASWH into 3.5, 5, 9 or 15 cm petri dishes, coating them with a 1-2 mm thin layer. Let the agarose solidify and cover the plates with ASWH. Stock them at 4 °C for 1-2 weeks maximum. Replace the ASWH before use.\nPrepare special injection dishes.\n\t\nPour a 5-7 mm thick layer of melted 1% agarose into a 5 cm Petri dish, and place a mold on the agarose (such as a zip lock closing glued to a plastic cover slip) to produce an indentation upon solidification of the agarose that can hold the eggs. Prepare 4 to 5 injection dishes and cover with ASWH. Store at 4 °C and replace with fresh ASWH before use. Use only fresh plates for injection (maximum one day old).",
    "Prepare β-galactosidase (LacZ) staining buffer: 1 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 3 mM K4[Fe(CN)6]·3H2O, 3 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Tween (PBT) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 0.05% Tween). Store in the dark at 4 °C. Prepare LacZ substrate 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl ß-D-Galactopyranoside (X-gal, 10 U/ml) in aliquots of 40 mg/ml in dimethylformamide (DMF) and store stocks at -20 °C until use.\nSoak Pasteur pipettes in tap water overnight to prevent the embryos from sticking.\nPrepare injection needles.\n\t\nSet up a micropipette puller at conditions such as heat 425, pull 75, velocity 75 and time 200 (from a filament ramp test of 415).\nPull 4 to 5 filament-containing glass capillaries to produce 8 to 10 long, fine needles normally closed at the tip. Store the needles in a dust free needle box, attached to double adhesive tape on an elevated support, to avoid breaking the tips and which is convenient for needle filling.\n\t\tNOTE: Test the obtained needles by injecting a few eggs with green vital dye (as described in section 6) and adjust the needle pulling conditions to obtain a tip shape that allows for fine-tuned and repetitive injection as described in 6.6.\nPrepare injection solution. Prepare 4 µl of injection solution, e.g., composed of 1 µl of 2 mM MO, 2 µl of 10 µg/µl green vital dye and 1 µl ddH2O. Add a final concentration of 0.05-0.5 µg/µl capped mRNA or 20 ng/µl of plasmid DNA according to the experimental question. Mix well. Keep on ice if the solution contains mRNA.\n2. Collection of Gametes",
    "Dissect Ciona adults in an 18 °C cooled embryo room. Use small scissors and start from the end that opposes the siphons on the side of the exhaling (shorter) siphon under which the oviduct and the sperm duct run.\nExpose the oviduct and delicately make an incision in the oviduct using the tip of the scissors. Drop the outflowing eggs directly into a 6-well plate containing ASWH by gently pressing the oviduct with the closed scissors stripping off the eggs. Transfer the remaining eggs with a Pasteur pipette pre-rinsed with ASWH.\nDeposit the eggs from different animals in different wells. Observe the egg quality under the dissecting scope.\n\tNOTE: Well developed eggs are round and pink to slightly yellow in color. They are surrounded by a non-cellular vitelline coat, the chorion that forms a well-defined perivitelline space around the egg. The chorion is associated with test cells at its inside and star-shaped follicle cells at its outside. Eggs of low quality often lack the perivitelline space or the follicle cells. They appear less round, more granular or different in color. Immature oocytes are smaller and have a silver white color.\nCut the sperm duct with the scissors and collect concentrated sperm into a 1.5 ml tube using a separate Pasteur pipette. Pool the sperm from different animals (at least two) into the same tube. Store sperm at 4 °C for several days.\n3. Fertilization\nCollect sperm and eggs at 18 °C as described in step 2.\nActivate the sperm.\n\t\nPrepare 1 ml ASWH in a 1.5 ml tube and mix with 50 µl of 1 M Tris pH 9.5. Then add 20 µl of concentrated sperm and gently mix by inverting the tube.",
    "Verify the sperm activation in a drop of sperm placed onto a cover of a small Petri dish or a glass slide and observe under the dissecting scope. The spermatozoids should be swimming frantically.\nAdd 100-200 µl of the activated sperm solution to each well of eggs (containing between 100 and 1,000 eggs), mix well by pipetting up and down, so the eggs are floating in the medium. Wait for 10 min without moving the embryos.\n4. Dechorionation of Eggs and Embryos\nDilute a 500 µl aliquot of 20x dechorionation solution to 10 ml in ASWH. Activate the dechorionation solution by adding drop-wise 200 µl of 2.5 M NaOH to the 10 ml 1x dechorionation solution. A milky precipitate will form. Gently mix by inverting the tube.\nCollect the eggs or zygotes (after the 10 min wait in step 3.3) into glass tubes using a Pasteur pipette. Pool the eggs from 2 to 3 animals in one tube (around 1,000-5,000 eggs/tube). Sediment with a hand centrifuge by spinning at high speed (1,200 x g) for about 20 sec to form an embryo pellet at the bottom of the tube. Slowly stop the centrifuge and remove the ASWH with a Pasteur pipette.\nAdd 4 ml of activated dechorionation solution to the pelleted eggs/zygotes in each tube. Suspend the eggs/zygotes by gently pipetting them up and down using a tap water-treated Pasteur pipette topped with a small rubber pear. The solution should turn yellowish after 1-3 min.\nFollow the dechorionation by removing a small aliquot of the dechorionating egg/zygote suspension using the Pasteur pipette. Deposit a drop on a slide and observe under the dissecting scope. Keep pipetting eggs/zygotes up and down and check every 20-30 sec.",
    "NOTE: First follicle cells detach, then the chorion turns yellow and opaque, and finally it detaches from the zygotes. Pink dechorionated eggs/zygotes will sink to the bottom of the glass tube. The dechorionation should not take more than max. 5 min.\nFill the tube with ASWH once 50% of eggs/zygotes are dechorionated.\n\tNOTE: Very gently centrifuge (8 x g) for about 10-15 sec corresponding to a very low speed just enough to sediment the dechorionated eggs/embryos. Slowly stop the centrifuge as to not perturb the pellet of eggs/zygotes at the bottom of the tube.\nRemove nearly all the liquid from the glass tube including the floating material with incompletely dechorionated eggs/zygotes and replace with ASWH. Slowly pipet up and down to wash and gently centrifuge again as in step 4.2. Alternatively, wait for zygotes to settle down by gravity. Wash once more until no chorion debris is left.\nTransfer eggs/zygotes to freshly rinsed culture dishes using a Pasteur pipette. Keep the zygotes (not eggs) at low density (around 200 embryos per 10 cm dish) to avoid their sticking together. Culture the embryos to the desired stage at temperatures between 13 and 20 °C. Alternatively, electroporate the zygotes (Step 5) or inject the unfertilized eggs (Step 6).\n5. Electroporation\nFertilize the eggs and dechorionate the zygotes at 18 °C as in sections 3 and 4. Provide between 50 and 400 eggs per electroporation sample.\nPrepare 50 µl plasmid DNA in a 1.5 ml tube (max. 100 µg plasmid DNA in 50 µl ddH2O) and add 200 µl 0.95 M mannitol. Mix well by vortexing.\nDispatch and gravity sediment the dechorionated zygotes in siliconized 1.5 ml tubes. Remove the ASWH down to the 100 µl mark on the tube.",
    "Proceed, consecutively, for each zygote tube as follows: add DNA/mannitol solution using a Pasteur pipette. Gently mix with the zygotes and instantly take up the DNA/mannitol/zygote suspension and transfer to a 4 mm electroporation cuvette.\nPlace the cuvette immediately into the electroporation holder and give a single pulse of 16 msec at 50 V.\nRemove the zygotes from the cuvette using the same Pasteur pipette and spread them out on a culture dish containing fresh and filtered ASWH. Pipette the zygotes before they start cleaving around 1 hour post fertilization (hpf) at 18 °C.\nRinse the pipette between the samples in a beaker of ASWH.\nCulture the zygotes at 15-20 °C at low enough density of around 200 embryos per 10 cm dish to avoid their sticking together.\n6. Microinjection\nPrepare Dechorionated Eggs for the Injection.\n\t\nDechorionate the eggs separately, from 2-4 animals, as described in section 4. Keep the unfertilized and dechorionated eggs in separate small agarose coated culture dishes. Wash the eggs several times in the dishes to remove the debris.\nTest fertilize small batches of the dechorionated eggs (around 50) from each individual. Use a separate 5 cm dish for each batch and apply 2 µl activated sperm (step 3.2). Mix well by swirling the dishes and spread out the eggs in the dish by moving the dishes sideways. Keep the sperm and eggs together for about 10 min without moving.\nEliminate a maximum of sperm as follows: transfer the fertilized eggs to a fresh culture dish or rinse twice with fresh ASWH. Leave the cleaving embryos unperturbed till the 32-cell stage (at 18 °C for about 3 hours post fertilization). Choose eggs from the best developing batch (best percentage of fertilization and most regular cleavage pattern) for the microinjection.\nSet up the Injection Needles.",
    "Backfill 4 injection needles in a vertical position to allow for gravity flow along the filament. Deposit 0.5 µl injection solution (step 1.8) containing green vital dye on the back end of the needles that are positioned needle tip down. Wait for the liquid to fill the needle tip at the bottom.\nReposition the needles horizontally and backfill them with mineral oil using a fine and long metal or plastic pipette tip. Slowly overlay the injection solution with mineral oil expelling all the air bubbles while filling the needle.\nSetup the Micromanipulator in an 18 °C Cooled Room.\n\t\nConnect the plastic tubing of the needle holder to a 10 ml glass syringe filled with mineral oil. Backfill the tubing and the needle holder with oil and expel any air bubbles.\nInsert the needle in the needle holder and position the holder on the micromanipulator.\nAdjust the needle holder movement along a straight line at an angle of 45° relative to the surface.\nOrient the dechorionated eggs along the agarose indentation of the injection dish so that the eggs can be injected one by one under the dissection microscope.\nBreak the needle tip, if necessary, by gently pushing the needle against the agarose or against a piece of glass cover slip placed on the agarose. Slightly pressure the syringe knob to verify that the needle tip is open (green needle contents will expel).\nInject the unfertilized eggs one by one by first introducing the needle into the egg and slightly aspirating to break the egg membrane followed by injection. Inject green injection solution into the middle of the egg to a maximum of 1/3 of the cell diameter. (This corresponds to approximately 30 pl for an egg diameter of 140 µm).",
    "Transfer the injected unfertilized eggs to a fresh culture dish and incubate them at 15-18 °C until fertilization.\nFertilize the injected eggs with freshly activated sperm as in the test fertilizations (step 6.1.2). Eliminate a maximum of the sperm by transferring the zygotes to a fresh culture dish. Spread out the embryos and do not perturb them during cleavage stages (up to the 32-cell stage).\nCulture the embryos to the desired stage at a temperature comprised between 13 and 20 °C.\nCollect the embryos by swirling them into the middle of the plate and transferring them into siliconized 1.5 ml tubes. Fix and stain, or mount (Steps 7 and 8).\nCompare the obtained phenotypes to the control injected embryos.\n\tNOTE: Inject a second, non-overlapping MO that targets the same transcript to obtain identical phenotypes. Rescue the specific MO phenotype(s) with a modified mRNA encoding your protein of interest but that is not recognized by the MOs. Inject a control MO that gives no phenotype.\n7. LacZ Staining\nCollect the embryos at a desired stage in siliconized 1.5 ml tubes and fix them in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 1 ml ASWH for 15 to 30 min maximum.\nWash 2x 10 min with 1 ml 1x PBT.\nRinse once in 500 µl LacZ staining buffer. Replace with X-Gal substrate supplemented 1 ml staining buffer (use 10 µl/ml of 40 mg/ml X-Gal stock). Transfer the embryos into a 12 well plate for better observation of the staining.\nIncubate in the dark. Vary incubation from 0.5 hr to overnight at 4 °C, at RT or at 37 °C depending on the strength of the driver expressing LacZ.\nWash the embryos up to 4 times in 1 ml 1X PBT to remove staining buffer.",
    "Post-fix for 10 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1 ml 1x PBT or 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 1 ml 1x PBT for interpretation and visualization of the stained embryos.\n8. Mounting of Fluorescently Labelled Wmbryos\nFix the embryos of a desired developmental stage for 20 min in 2% PFA in 1 ml ASWH.\nWash the embryos 2x in 1 ml 1x PBT. Avoid any light exposure by keeping the embryos in dark conditions.\nTransfer up to 50 embryos to one slide. Remove a maximum of PBT first with a pipette and carefully with a paper towel.\nAdd 20-25 µl mounting medium.\nAdd a coverslip by positioning it in an angle (from one side first) and slowly lower it with a pointed object (needle, forceps, pipette tip) avoiding bubbles till the sample is covered. Fix the coverslip at its edges using dots of a transparent nail polish.\nSeal the entire coverslip with a nail polish after drying. Store in the dark at -20 °C."
