    "Prepare Evan’s blue solution (see Recipe 1)Stain tissue with Evan’s blue to assess extent of membrane stabilityGrow the plants under normal conditions. Impose the stress treatment to be determined for specific growth stages of plants and collect the tissue (leaf or root).For example, we imposed the stress to leaves that are collected from 30-day-old plants of groundnut. We perform the leaf disc assay with small leaf discs of 1 cm diameter. We transfer ten leaf discs to a Petri plate and then impose methyl viologen (MV)-induced oxidative stress treatment. Methyl viologen at 5 µM is exposed to one set (stress) and another set is kept in pure water (control) and these leaf discs exposed to high light conditions (1,000 µmol m-2 sec-1) at room temperature (RT) for three hours. These leaf discs, were then stained with Evan’s blue stain (Figure 1A).In another set of experiments, NaCl (150 mM in Hoagland solution [see Recipe 2]) stress is imposed to one set of rice seedlings (stress) and the other set was kept only in Hoagland’s solution (control) in a hydroponic experiment (Lopez and Satti, 1996). Three days after stress imposition collect the roots from control and stressed plants for Evan’s blue staining and membrane stability determination (Figure 1B). This method is highly reproducible with ~95% accuracyTransfer the collected leaf and root tissues to 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and add 2 ml of Evan’s blue solution to each tube.Note: Adjust the volume to ensure that tissues are immersed in the solution. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814182151_7326.jpgFigure 1.

Scale bar indicates 25 µm.",
    "The groundnut leaf discs from 30-day-old plants were incubated in MV for 3 h at high light intensity of 1,000 µmol m-2 sec-1 and subsequently the leaf discs were stained with Evan’s blue dye. For NaCl stress the rice seedlings of 30-days old were exposed to 150 mM NaCl for 3 days and the roots were stained with Evan’s blue dye to assess membrane integrity.Shake the tubes in an orbital shaker at 50 oscillations/min for 20 min.Note: Shaking is just to ensure that all of the tissue is in contact with the Evan’s blue dye solution.Wash the roots and leaves thoroughly with distilled water thrice or until unbound dye washes out from surface.Note: (Optional) Root or leaf tissue can also be washed with 0.1 M CaCl2 of pH 5.6 (see Recipe 3).Observe the stained leaf or root under the normal, transmitted light microscope. Examine the leaves or roots and take photograph of images under a brightfield microscope. Furthermore, the Evan’s blue stained images can be quantified using ImageJ software to assess the viability of cells.Note: If the sample size is large, it’s preferable to follow only spectrophotometric quantification and appropriate statistics can be applied to arrive at significance levels.Quantification Evan’s blue stain taken up due to membrane destabilizationTo extract the Evan’s blue dye from the roots and leaves, use 1 ml of 1% SDS (see Recipe 4) cell lysis buffer which breaks up membrane structures. Grind 100 mg of tissue using a tissue lyser with a frequency of 15 strokes per second for 10 min, if the sample number is large. If only a few samples are needed, they can be ground in a pestle and mortar. After grinding, transfer the extract to 2 ml Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Centrifuge the extract at 7,168 x g for 5 min at RT to elute the dye into the solution and to remove the debris.Transfer an aliquot of supernatant to new tubes or directly transfer 250 µl of supernatant to a 96-well microtiter plate.Note: Since Evan’s blue dye will not oxidize, it can be stored at RT for half an hour to measure large samples.Measure the optical density at 600 nm spectrophotometrically using a cuvette or a plate reader by taking 1% SDS as blank. Concentration of Evan’s blue can be estimated by referring to a standard curve (Figure 2).Plot the graph of concentration of Evan’s blue on y-axis and plant number or stress treatment on x-axis (Figure 3A and 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814182440_7052.jpgFigure 2. Standard graph for Evan’s blue staining. Standard graph is prepared using 1 µg ml-1 of Evan’s blue stock solution. Different concentrations of Evan’s blue were diluted and absorbance was recorded at 600 nm.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814183052_7085.jpgFigure 3. Quantification of membrane stability using the spectrophotometric method. Histogram showing the extent of Evan’s blue dye taken up by the (A) leaf tissue and (B) root tissue as a reflection of membrane damage. The extent of dye taken up by the cells was quantified by grinding the tissue in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and measuring the absorbance at 600 nm and calculated using standard graph. Error bars indicate the minimum of three replicates data. * indicate the least significant difference (LSD) at P < 0.05 analyzed using GenStat statistical tool.Preparation of standard curve using Evan’s blue:Dissolve 1 µg of Evan’s blue in 1 ml of distilled water to get 1 µg ml-1 stock solution. From stock solution make five concentrations by making up the volume to 1 ml. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm in spectrophotometer (Figure 2)."
