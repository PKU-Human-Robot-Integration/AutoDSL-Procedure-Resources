    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGrow C. elegans on a large scale and collect strains\nTiming: 8 days\nTo prepare for large scale experiments, expand the C. elegans strain populations then collect and freeze worms at –80°C. The amount of sample to be collected will depend on the scale and developmental stage desired for any given experiment.\nSynchronize and expand the C. elegans strains. Refer to troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] for additional information.\nTransfer freshly starved L1 worms onto 150 mm NA22-seeded peptone-rich NGM plates.\nOnce the hermaphrodites are gravid but not yet starved, bleach them to collect embryos and expand synchronized populations.\nWash gravid hermaphrodites off of plates with M9 buffer.\nCentrifuge the worms in conical tubes at 850×g for 1 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nAdd freshly prepared bleach (98 mL water, 6 mL 5N KOH, 12 mL sodium hypochlorite (10–15% stock)) and gently invert for approximately 7 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 850×g for 1 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nTo wash away the bleach, add M9 buffer and gently invert the tube for 5–15 s.\nRepeat steps v. - vii. at least four times to completely wash away any residual bleach from the worms.\nPlate approximately 100,000 embryos per 150 mm NA22-seeded peptone-rich NGM plate.\nIncubate the worms at 25°C.\nNote: The bleach solution should be prepared fresh the day of use.\nNote: Do not allow the bleach treatment to last more than 8–10 min. Excessive exposure to bleach will damage or kill the embryos and thus reduce the yield of viable embryos.\nCritical: Growing worms at higher temperatures (25°C) increases biotinylation activity compared to lower temperatures (15°C–20°C).\nCollect and freeze worms at the desired developmental stage.\nWash worms off of the plates with M9 buffer.\nCentrifuge worms in conical tubes at 850×g for 1 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and add back fresh M9 buffer.\nRepeat steps b. – c. until supernatant is clear of bacteria (approximately five times).\nFor the final wash of worms with M9 buffer, allow the worms to settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity. To expedite this step, place the worms on ice.\nAliquot the worms in desired amounts into fresh Eppendorf tubes.\nLet the worms settle on ice.\nRemove as much M9 buffer supernatant as possible.\nFreeze the pellets in liquid nitrogen and store them at –80°C.\nPause point: Frozen pellets can be stored at –80°C for several months.\nNote: Performing thorough washes to remove bacteria from C. elegans samples is critical for the quality of the subsequent lysis and biotinylation enrichment steps.\nNote: When collecting larval or adult stages of worms, place them on ice to accelerate the rate of worms settling to the bottom of the tube. Placing samples on ice also slows the activity of biotin ligases at any stage of worm development.\nNote: Avoid future freeze-thaws by aliquoting small amounts into tubes. In our case, we froze 500 μL worm pellets.\nLyse C. elegans strains and enrich biotinylated proteins\nTiming: 2 days\nTo collect biotinylated proteins, first lyse the worms and then capture biotinylated proteins on streptavidin-covered magnetic beads. The steps for capturing biotinylated proteins have been adapted (Branon et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hung et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nBefore proceeding, prepare all lysis buffers and place them on ice.\nHigh-SDS RIPA lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% (wt/vol) SDS, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 2.5 mg/mL Leupeptin, 5 mg/mL Pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 1× HALT solution in water.",
    "SDS-free RIPA lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 2.5 mg/mL Leupeptin, 5 mg/mL Pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 1× HALT solution in water.\nRIPA lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% (wt/vol) SDS, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in water.\nTransfer worm pellets from –80°C to ice.\nAdd 500 μL of high SDS RIPA lysis buffer for every 500 μL of worm pellet.\nOnce the pellet is thawed to 4°C, transfer the entire sample to a tube containing silica spheres (for L4 or adult stages we used \"lysing matrix C\" 1.0 mm silica spheres, MP Biomedicals).\nAgitate at 6.5 m/s for 20 s pulses with 5-min breaks on ice (FastPrep-24 Classic) for a total of three times.\nOptional: After agitation, take a small aliquot to check the status of lysis under a dissecting microscope.\nAvoiding the silica spheres, transfer the entire sample to clean tubes appropriate for sonication. You might need to add additional high SDS RIPA lysis buffer to ensure that the total volume of liquid is set for proper submersion of the sonication apparatus.\nSonicate at 18% at 5 s intervals with 5 s breaks for 50 s total in a 4°C water bath (Branson Sonifier SFX250).\nOptional: After sonication treatment, take a small aliquot to check the status of lysis under a dissecting microscope. Refer to troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] for additional information.\nAdd SDS-free RIPA buffer to achieve a final SDS concentration of 0.2%.\nGently rotate the lysate on a slow spinning wheel for 1 h at 4°C.\nTransfer the samples to ultracentrifuge tubes (13 × 51 mm), and spin them at 4°C for 30 min at 51,000 RPM in a TLA-100.3 ultracentrifuge rotor (Beckman).",
    "Note: Use larger ultracentrifuge tubes when handling larger volumes of sample.\nCarefully collect the liquid layer (avoid the lipid layer) and transfer to a clean Eppendorf tube.\nTake 2% of liquid fraction (this is the \"input\" fraction) and save it on ice.\nMeasure the protein concentration for each sample using the Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At this point of the protocol, we calculated an average protein concentration of 1.6 mg/mL. Note that this is from a 500 μL pellet of worms that has gone through several dilution steps.\nWash the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Pierce Streptavidin Magnetic Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #88817) by adding 1 mL of RIPA lysis buffer, gently rotating on a spinning wheel for 5 min, then pelleting the beads with a magnetic rack (Thermo Fisher) and discarding the supernatant. Repeat a total of 2–3 times.\nNote: When handling streptavidin magnetic beads, use pipette tips that are 200 μL or larger with the tips cut off with a clean razor blade.\nAdd the optimized volume of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to 1 mg of protein for each sample. We used 125 μL beads to achieve a ratio of 8 μg protein/1 μL beads.\nCritical: The ratio of protein concentration to bead volume is important to optimize with bead titration tests. For example, the use of more streptavidin beads than necessary can increase the number of nonspecific binders, thus creating background. Conversely, the use of less streptavidin beads than necessary will exclude biotinylated proteins.\nIf samples are at unequal volumes, add additional RIPA lysis buffer to achieve similar volumes across samples. This step is to bring all samples to similar concentrations and will ease sample mixing.\nGently rotate the lysate on a slow spinning wheel at 4°C for 16 h.",
    "Store the rest of the lysate at –80°C.\nPellet the beads using a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant.\nSet aside 2% of the supernatant (this is the \"flow-through\" fraction) and save it on ice.\nWash each bead sample with buffers to remove nonspecific binders. Keep the samples on ice between washes.\nAdd 1 mL of cold RIPA buffer, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min, then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of cold 1M KCl, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min, then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of cold 0.1 M Na2CO3, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min, then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of 2 M urea, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min, then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of 4 M urea, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min, then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of cold RIPA buffer, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step f. twice total.\nAdd 1 mL of cold PBS, gently rotate at 20°C–23°C on a spinning wheel for 2 min then pellet beads using a magnetic rack and discard supernatant.\nRepeat step h. 5 times total.\nCritical: Each wash reagent and the frequency of washes can be optimized to ensure that only proteins covalently tagged with biotin are enriched.",
    "Note: Urea solutions should be prepared in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Dissolve urea in the Tris buffer and adjust the pH with hydrochloric acid (HCl). These solutions should be made fresh on the day of use.\nNote: Prepare stock solutions of KCl, and Na2CO3 in water; these can be stored for several months at 20°C–23°C.\nNote: At this point, biotinylated proteins that were enriched with the streptavidin magnetic beads can now be identified. The steps for identifying biotinylated proteins are not outlined in this protocol as the specific steps will depend on your experimental design considerations and the mass spectrometry protocols available to you. Contact your mass spectrometry facility to discuss a protocol for identifying captured biotinylated proteins. Also note that you might need to scale up the experiment if the mass spec protocol calls for a higher amount of protein.\nTo run samples for western blot analysis, elute the biotinylated proteins from the beads. Biotin is included in this step to elute biotinylated proteins more effectively.\nAdd 3× sample buffer supplemented with 1:10 β-mercaptoethanol and 2 mM biotin.\nBoil at 95°C for 10 min.\nVortex beads briefly then cool samples on ice.\nCentrifuge the tubes briefly to bring down condensation.\nPellet the beads using a magnetic rack.\nCollect eluate (this will be the biotinylation eluate fraction).\nPlace the biotinylation eluate fraction on ice.\nNote: To make a 100 mM stock solution of biotin, dissolve biotin in DMSO. Stock aliquots can be stored at –20°C for several months.\nAdd 4× sample buffer (supplemented with 1:10 β-mercaptoethanol) to each input and flow-through fractions. Dilute 3 parts sample with 1 part of 4× sample buffer.\nBoil at 95°C for 10 min.\nPlace the samples back on ice.",
    "Run equal volumes of input, flow-through, and biotinylation eluate samples for each genotype on one SDS polyacrylamide gel for subsequent western blot analysis to assess transgene construct expression, overall biotinylation patterns and levels, and to check that biotinylated proteins are enriched in the eluate and are not present in the flow-through.\nTransfer the samples to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.4 μm, Bio-Rad)\nStain the membrane with Ponceau S solution to check the quality of the protein transfer. Then, remove the Ponceau S stain by rinsing the membrane with water.\nBlock the membrane with 5% milk in 1× PBST solution for 30 min to 1 h at 20°C–23°C or for 16 h at 4°C.\nTo detect proteins on a fluorescent imaging system (e.g., LI-COR), incubate the membrane with anti-HA primary antibody (1:5000 in 1× PBST, rat monoclonal, Roche) 1 h at 20°C–23°C.\nWash the membrane three times with 1× PBST for 5 min each.\nIncubate the membrane with a secondary antibody (1:5000, goat anti-rat IRDye 680RD, Licor) and streptavidin-IR Dye (1:5000, 800CW, Licor) in 1× PBST for 1 h at 20°C–23°C.\nWash the membrane three times with 1× PBST for 5 min each.\nImage the blot on LI-COR Odyssey CLx or an equivalent technology.\nCritical: All samples during and after worm lysis should remain at 4°C.\nOptional: You can split your sample to run on two SDS polyacrylamide gels such that one is used for western blotting and the other is used for silver stain. The silver stain is used to visualize all of the protein bands in the biotinylation eluate of each sample, which is useful for troubleshooting (see troubleshooting problem 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).\nNote: We recommend using glass pipettes to handle large quantities of worms because worms stick less to the side of glass tips compared to various plastics.",
