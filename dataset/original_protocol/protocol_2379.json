    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn this protocol, we describe all the steps needed to prepare samples for, and finally to perform cryoET on nuclear regions of HAdV5-pIX-mcherry infected A549 cells.\nIn the usage example, the cells are infected to study infection processes after 48 h of infection. This means that there should be (as close as possible) 48 h between the infection time-point and plunge-freezing time-point. Make sure that you time the infection sufficiently early (before or around noon), so that two days later you can also start early and have enough time for (imaging and) freezing.\nHere we present two variants of grid preparation. Option 1 has been used in Pfitzner et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] and comprises a simple fibronectin coat on the surface of the grid, that allows the cells to adhere to it in a random fashion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Alternatively, grids can be treated to guide cellular adherence selectively to desired areas of the grid by applying and selectively removing a cell-repelling coat. This technique is termed micropatterning (Option 2). The latter is highly advantageous, because (i) it prevents cells from clustering together, allowing a higher seeding density and (ii) it forces cells to the middle of the grid-squares, such allowing per grid many cells being optimally positioned for subsequent cryoFIB-milling (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cryo-SEM images of seeding results for a simple fibronectin coat (Option 1) and a micropatterned coat (Option 2)\n(A) Option 1: Seeding on fibronectin-coated grids. The cells are spread randomly and a good portion of them is sitting on top of the grid bar, inaccessible to cryoET. Shown here are Adenovirus infected A549 cells on holey carbon coated 200 mesh (R2/1) gold Quantifoil finder grids frozen 47 h post seeding.",
    "(B) Option 2: Seeding on micropatterned grids. Nearly all squares in the center of the grid are occupied by cells growing in the middle of the grid square, ideally positioned for subsequent cryoFIB-milling and cryoET. Shown here are Vero E6 cells on an UltrAuFoil R 0.6/1 300-mesh grid frozen 6 h post seeding.\nOption 1 of preparing grids, (infecting) and seeding cells on grids: Simple coating\nTiming: 1 day before seeding, or on the day of seeding, duration 2 h\nIf you would like to prepare a simple overall coating, proceed here. For the micropatterning, proceed with Option 2.\nHere we make the grids suitable to grow cells on them by fibronectin coating. This renders the entire grid surface favorable and cells can randomly adhere to the grid surface.\nApply the coating:\nTake a microscope slide and wrap with parafilm.\nNote: Parafilm is not essential but helps with the grid handling. There is no negative effect of the parafilm on the glow-discharging. However, use of parafilm is rumored to lead to pollution of the glow-discharger, which is typically not a problem for simple systems, but may lead to decreased performance of more sophisticated systems.\nPlace the number of grids (holey carbon-coated gold finder grids (Quantifoil R 2/1)) that you would like to prepare with the foil-side facing up on the parafilm.\nNote: One batch is maximum 8 grids; 2 batches are doable and 3 are only doable when no live-cell fluorescence is applied. Depending on your experiment and proficiency, prepare 8 or 16 grids + 2 spares.\nAlternatives: Holey gold on gold grids and other grid designs can also be used to seed cells on. More sturdy grids (like the holey gold on gold) may be easier to handle.",
    "Critical: Do not use copper mesh grids, as these are toxic for cells.\nNote: 200 mesh grids typically give better-positioned cells compared to smaller square sizes (like 400 mesh).\nNote: Gold-grids scatter fluorescence and it can be difficult to see a signal from your cells when the signal is not so strong. In the example protocol, this is not a problem.\nNote: Correlation of the fluorescence image to the FIB-SEM image from the FIB-SEM is more difficult with more stable grids (e.g., gold grids), because the grids are undamaged during sample preparation giving less features to correlate. To help mitigate this touch each grid in two locations, away from the middle, with a sharp needle before glow-discharging. This damages 2–3 squares in each touch creating a unique pattern that helps identify the orientation of the grid. Do this before and not after seeding infected cells, because it would pose an extra safety hazard to use a needle when the material is infected.\nNote: When planning to do fluorescence microscopy, choose grids that underwent Quantifoil’s washing treatment termed “wash-protocol 3”. After reporting background fluorescence to Quantifoil, they developed several washing protocols. Wash-protocol 3 proved the best in our hands and these grids have reduced auto-fluorescence (green and red channel). This treatment can be requested when ordering grids.\nGlow-discharge the grids (e.g., in a GloQube) for 60 s, 25 mA, negative charge, and subsequently place the microscope slide with grids in a 10 cm glass petri dish and cover against contamination.\nNote: Even though glow-discharging works by leaking air, starting with a good vacuum seems to give a better and more complete result.\nNote: To get the grids out the glow-discharger requires air to be let in. Control the airflow to a slow setting to prevent the grids from flying around.",
    "Note: Use glass rather than plastic petri dishes as the latter will cause static electricity that will make your grids ‘fly’.\nNote: The effect of glow discharging wears off with time. Thus, it is recommended to proceed with the next step within an hour.\nWork in a safety cabinet: Prepare a fresh sterile 1% fibronectin coating solution in PBS. You need 5–10 μL final solution per grid.\nNote: The component to coat the grid with and its concentration depends on the cell type and is a parameter of optimization. Other ECM components that have been explored in our lab are laminin, fibrinogen and collagen.\nPut a drop (5–10 μL) of 1% fibronectin coating solution on each grid and let dry for 1 h under UV light i.e., inside the safety cabinet for sterilization (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], panels 1–2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Option 1: Workflow seeding infected cells on grids\n1. Apply fibronectin coating solution on glow-discharged holey carbon-coated gold finder grids (Quantifoil R2/1). 2. Let incubate for 1 h under UV-light. 3. Wet grids with PBS, wash in PBS and place in medium-filled ibidi chamber slide square. 4. Mix cells and virus at MOI:2 in Eppendorf tube. 5. Pipet small volume on grid, and check with light microscopy the cell distribution. Repeat until satisfied with the distribution.\nCritical: The sterilization prevents growth of bacteria or fungi and can be important for longer storage of grids, and for longer culturing of cells on the grids. It is not needed when the grids are used immediately and frozen shortly after (rule of thumb: ∼6 h). Keep grids sterile from now on.\nStore at 4°C or use immediately.",
    "Pause point: Sterilized grids can be stored overnight (up to 24 h) dry at 4°C and 7 days at 4°C in a wet chamber after applying a drop of PBS on them.\nTransfer of the grids into an ibidi chamber slide (2 × 9 wells):\nNote: Experienced users can save time when they do this step while incubating cells in trypsin (see step 3d), but in the beginning, the handling of grids can require more time and is easier when the user is not under time pressure.\nPut 10 μL of PBS on each coated grid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], panel 3).\nCritical: Essential before picking them up from the parafilm. This prevents tearing of the carbon layer of the grid.\nPrepare one ibidi chamber slide (2 × 9 wells) per experimental condition by putting 50 μL of GM in each well.\nCritical: When incubating for longer times, take measures to prevent drying of your sample. Drying will cause increased concentrations of dilute materials, which can stress the cells and can influence the reproducibility and results of your experiments. Drying can be prevented by putting medium in all wells. The extra medium gives protection against drying of the small volumes during incubation. Alternatively, or additionally, one can place the ibidi chamber slide in a 10 cm cell culture dish and put wet lint free tissue to the side to create a wet chamber.",
    "Optional: FBS contains a low level of antibodies and other inhibitors. While no effect was observed for the described experiment, infection experiments at lower MOI or with other viruses could benefit from an initial infection at low or FBS free conditions. In the case of infecting, you could fill the chamber with FBS-free medium. When you do so, do not forget to carefully remove the medium from the grids and replace with (pre-warmed) GM after 1 h.\nDip each grid in PBS to wash off excess fibronectin coating solution and place them one per well in a + pattern inside the ibidi chamber slide squares (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], panel 3).\nAlternatives: When working with very small volumes you can also choose to dip in GM to avoid dilution of the GM with PBS.\nNote: Leave the corners of each 3 × 3 square empty. Those corners are harder to reach with your tweezers. Grids in the middle squares are easier to grab in later steps.\nNote: Make sure the grids sink into the medium to the bottom of the dish. Having more medium helps. The order of first filling the wells with medium and then placing grids is easier, because addition of medium on top of the grids often causes them to float.\nHarvesting cells:\nPreheat trypsin, PBS and GM to 37°C.\nRemove medium from the cell culture dish.\nWash cells once with 5 mL of PBS.\nGive 2 mL of trypsin to the dish and place in incubator for 15–20 min.",
    "Critical: Here it is important that the cells float spontaneously. If you incubate for 10 min, the cells are loose enough to rinse them off when stopping the reaction, but this often leads to cells clumping. As you need single cells, it is better to wait longer for the cells to come off spontaneously.\nAlternatives: You can also make use of a cell strainer to select for single cells.\nNote: Trypsin exposure over too long time can be harmful to the cells, so do not trypsinize much longer than 20 min.\nStop trypsinization reaction with 3 mL of GM.\nOptional: infecting cells:\nNote: For seeding cells, knowing the cell count is not needed as long as you have an 80%–90% confluent dish. In that case, continue with step 5.\nNote: When infecting cells, it is important to know the titer of the virus stock, and one needs to determine how many cells are present. For adenovirus infection, virus and cells are mixed at an MOI of 2 (as here previously determined by FACs sorting). Knowing how much virus is added is important since more virus per cell may cause the cells to progress through their infection faster, but too little virus results in less infected cells.\nPrepare a counting chamber (Neubauer Improved) and pipet 10 μL of cell-suspension into the chamber.\nPlace the rest of the cells back in the incubator to keep them warm.\nCount all the cells in up to 4 squares under a light microscope (the more the more accurate, but if you have many cells counting 2 squares is sufficient).\nCalculate the number of cells per mL using the following formula:",
    "c e l l s   (  m  l  − 1    )  =   c o u n t e d  c e l l s   #  o f  c o u n t e d  s q u a r e s    ×   10 4   \nMix 0.5 mL of cells with virus at a MOI of 2 in a screwcap tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], panel 4).\nCritical: Instead of a normal Eppendorf tube, use screw-cap tubes with a rubber seal when working with virus to avoid aerosol formation.\nNote: Make sure to store your virus in small aliquots. Typically, viruses loose infectivity by freeze-thaw cycles.\nNote: Optimize the MOI needed to get at least 80% of cells infected. It is not always possible to get 100%, since increasing the MOI too much, will increase the difference in infectivity progression between individual cells on a grid.\nNote: When having trouble with getting a proper infection, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSeeding cells on grids:\nPipet 5 μL of cell-suspension and seed over one grid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], panel 5).\nAlternatives: Seed into a square that does not contain a grid to get a first feeling of the number of cells and adjust volume from there.\nCritical: Break the surface of the medium while pipetting instead of dropping a drop of cells. The latter will cause the cells to float more to the side and not land on the grid.\nNote: Seeding prior to infection is possible but A549 cells are fast growing. Overnight, their cell-count changes as they start to divide. This also gives rise to clumps of cells rather than single-cells, which influences the number of suitable areas for FIB-milling. Infection blocks cell division after several hours, preventing further growth.",
    "Note: Cells need roughly 1 h to adhere to the grid. For short timeframes, consider seeding the cells prior to infecting them, and then adding virus by pipetting above the grid, through the surface of the medium.\nCheck the cellular distribution of the grid with a light microscope. If too few, repeat step 5a until ideally each grid square in the middle area has on average one cell.\nRepeat for the other grids. Discard grids with too much broken carbon.\nCritical: The borders between wells are shallow, so do not mix different conditions in one chamber to avoid cross-contamination.\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], and troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPut the ibidi chamber slide into an incubator and let the cells attach.\nNote: The time cells need to properly attach (and spread out for uninfected cells) is dependent on the cell line and has to be determined experimentally.\nOption 2 of preparing grids, (infecting) and seeding cells on grids: Micropatterning\nTiming: 1 day before seeding (or (in part) on the day of seeding), duration 6.5 h\nThis section describes the protocol for preparing micropatterned cryoEM grids, and how to achieve a directed growth of cells on them. In this context, micropatterning describes the localized deposition of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) proteins on photo ablated areas of PEG passivated grids. One advantage of micropatterning is that one can achieve many more cells suitable for cryoFIB-milling compared to the protocol described above (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Combined with the now established automation for lamella preparation (Klumpe et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Kuba et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Buckley et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Zachs et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]), this technique currently facilitates maximum throughput for the generation of cellular cryoET samples by cryoFIB-SEM (Toro-Nahuelpan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).",
    "For the contactless photopatterning, we utilize the PRIMO system from Alvéole installed on a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope. Other setups have been described to create micropatterned grids (Fäßler et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Toro-Nahuelpan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]), which may require some adaptations to the described protocol. Furthermore, the increased amount of handling steps makes the vulnerable holey carbon grids used in Option 1 (simple coating) impractical. We have good experience with more rigid grid types like gold mesh and foil grids (e.g., UltrAuFoil® R0.6/1 300 mesh) or titanium mesh (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, on request) and SiO2 foil grids (e.g., QUANTIFOIL® R1/4 200 mesh). We advise to use reverse action tweezers (Dumont N5) for all handling steps, to prevent crushing the grid through exertion of too much force with the forceps. All handling steps in this procedure should be performed under sterile conditions where possible. An overview of the workflow is depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Option 2. Micropatterning workflow\n1. Preparation of passivated UltrAuFoil grids. 2. Photopatterning of passivated grids. 3. Application of fibronectin. 4. Seeding cells and washing-off any out of pattern cells.\nPrepare grids for photopatterning:\nTake grids out of their box and place them foil-side up onto a microscope slide.\nCritical: Make sure not to bend the grids. This would prevent accurate focusing during the patterning process, which is crucial for homogenous and sharp patterning results throughout the grid.\nPlace the microscope slide into a carbon coater (e.g., Leica ACE600) and apply a 5 nm carbon coat onto the grid.\nNote: Applying a carbon coat improves the outcome of the micropatterning as well as the growth behaviour of many cell types on grids (Sibert et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nPause point: Carbon-coated grids can be stored indefinitely.",
    "Glow discharge the grids (e.g., in a GloQube® Plus) for 60 s, 25 mA, negative charge.\nNote: The duration and intensity of the glow-discharging is a parameter that affects the effectiveness of the passivation with PLL-g-PEG (poly-L-lysine grafted with polyethylene glycol, PLL(20)-g[3.5]-PEG(5)). It is a parameter to optimize for each grid type.\nWhile glow discharging, prepare a microscope slide with parafilm and pipet a 10 μL drop PLL-g-PEG solution on it for each grid to process.\nAlternatives: A two-step passivation method using PLL and PEG-SVA can also be applied. For details, see Toro-Nahuelpan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27].\nSubmerge the grid foil-side up into the drop of PLL-g-PEG and incubate for 1 h at RT in a wet chamber.\nNote: A wet chamber can be made from a glass petri dish containing a water-soaked lint free tissue. Do not use plastic petri dishes, as this might cause electrostatic charging.\nPause point: You can also incubate the grids in PLL-g-PEG ON or for even longer periods in a fridge (4°C–8°C).\nPerform photopatterning:\nPrepare a glass bottom ibidi μ-Dish 35 mm low with up to 4 PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) stencils, which keep the grid in place during photopatterning, and add 5 μL PLPP (4-benzoylbenzyl-trimethylammonium chloride, 14.5 mg/mL) into the cavities.\nCritical: The photo activator PLPP is toxic. Thus, appropriate PPE should be worn.\nAlternatives: You can also use a standard microscope slide to place your grids and perform the micropatterning on. However, having an enclosed chamber makes it easier to comply with sterile working techniques.\nAlternatives: Alvéole offers a PLPP-gel, which shows superior performance to the liquid one. However, its use requires a different handling and has not been tested for this protocol.",
    "Note: The PDMS stencil is important as it holds the grid in position and prevents grid movement due to stage movement during the patterning processes, which would result in an offset of the patterns’ location.\nNote: For a different grid positioning system than PDMS stencils, refer to Fäßler et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nRetrieve grids from PLL-g-PEG using a tweezer and carefully touch the grid’s backside with a filter paper (e.g., Whatman® Grade 1) to dry the PLL-g-PEG briefly.\nImmediately place the grid into the PLPP drop with the foil-side facing downwards and close the ibidi dish lid.\nNote: We are using the PRIMO system on an inverted microscope and the grids foil-side must face downwards (towards the objective) to become irradiated with UV-light. You might have to adjust the orientation of the grid according to your individual setup.\nSwitch on the microscope including the PRIMO setup and put the ibidi dish into the microscope.\nUse the LEONARDO software to perform the photopatterning using the PRIMO system:\nCalibrate the system: First, use a highlighter and mark 5 mm on the glass in the same dish if possible. Then, follow on screen instructions.\nUse bright-field illumination to put the center of the grid into the image center.\nAdjust focus to the grid foil (grid appears most dark).\nClick on the magic wand icon to open the Experimental Wizard and select TEM Grids.\nSelect your pattern of interest from the pattern selection panel. For A549 cells, we found a simple triangular shape, placed in the center of the grid square, most suitable (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Effect of a specific pattern on A549 cells growing on a micropatterned EM grid\n(A) Template of the pattern used for A549 cells.",
    "(B) Transmission light microscopy of A549 cells growing on an UltrAuFoil R0.6/1 300 mesh grid passivated with PLL-g-PEG with pattern A applied (dimension: 25 × 25 μm) and coated with 10 μg/mL fibronectin. The shape of pattern A is projected onto the grid square for visualization purposes.\nSet the settings to the values provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. The selection of an ROI of 500 μm will lead to the coverage of the center of the grid with patterns.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2016_5.csv\nClick on Add Grid. This will lead to the placement of patterns.\nClick on Finish to confirm the placement of your patterns.\nClick on Play to start the photopatterning.\nCritical: Switch off the bright-field illumination during the photopatterning process to avoid excessive evaporation of the PLPP.\nCritical: Only apply the pattern in well-focused areas. This is crucial for a sharp and accurate photopatterning result.\nNote: Under https://www.alveolelab.com/resources-support-center/[href=https://www.alveolelab.com/resources-support-center/] Alvéole provides a great resource of video tutorials and FAQs. For a detailed description of the LEONARDO software see the software’s manual, that comes with the installation.\nNote: It is advisable to look carefully at how your cell type grows in standard cell culture dishes and to adopt the dimension and shape of the cellular footprint for your pattern design.\nNote: Depending on your research question, you can use any kind of pattern to enforce e.g., cell-cell contact or specific cytoskeleton rearrangement. For examples, see Engel et al. (2021a)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and (2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]); Toro-Nahuelpan et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]; Théry (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25].\nNote: In our use-case, the pattern is used to force cells to grow in the middle of the grid-squares. This increases the number of cells that are in a favorable location for cryoFIB-milling.",
    "Note: The microscope stage performs strong shifts during the photopatterning procedure, which can lead to a shift of the grid resulting in an offset of the pattern location on the grid.\nOptional: You can also design your own pattern to be used in the TEM Grids Experimental Wizard of the LEONARDO software (e.g., Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Therefore, follow the following steps:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Illustration and parameters for the design of a customized pattern for the use in the TEM Grids Experimental Wizard\nUse an image editing software of your choice (e.g., Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator) and create a black square (200 px × 200 px) and place the pattern design in white (or greyscales) in the center of the black square. The pattern (white/greyscales) must have the dimension of 100 px × 100 px for the software to be able to scale it.\nSave the pattern under Program Files -> Micro-Manager-1.4 -> patterns as an 8bit grayscale image in .tif format.\nIf already running, restart the LEONARDO software. The pattern should now be visible in the TEM Grids Experimental Wizards pattern selection panel.\nOptional: Instead of using the TEM Grids Experimental Wizard, you can also use a manual routine, which is described in the software’s manual.\nWhile the pattern is applied via UV irradiation, prepare two Eppendorf tubes containing PBS, as well as a microscope slide wrapped with parafilm with a 20 μL drop of PBS for each grid.\nPlace the ibidi dish with the photopatterned grids into the hood and carefully remove the PDMS stencil using tweezers.\nPick up each grid individually and immediately dip them into the first PBS tube. Wash the grid by repeatedly (10–15×) submerging it into the PBS.\nSubsequently move to the second Eppendorf tube and repeat washing step.",
    "Place the grid foil-side up onto a microscope slide prepared with parafilm and PBS drops and place them into the PBS drops.\nPause point: You can store the functionalized grids in drops of PBS at 4°C using a wet chamber for up to a month.\nApply an ECM component on the photopatterned grids:\nPrepare a microscope slide with parafilm and place a 10 μL drop of fibronectin coating solution (10 μg/mL) per grid on it.\nNote: Other cell-types may prefer other coatings to adhere to (see step 1d).\nTake the grids out of the PBS and place it foil-side up into the drop of fibronectin coating solution. Reassure that the grid sinks to the bottom. You can carefully submerge the grid with the help of your tweezer if necessary. Incubate at least 30 min at RT.\nNote: When picking up the grid out of a drop of PBS, you would like to retrieve it vertically, so that the grid retains less liquid. Be aware that your tweezer also sucks up some liquid between the forceps due to capillary forces, which will be released upon opening the tweezer. This could dilute your fibronectin coating solution when placing the grid into it. You can also carefully blot away excess liquid from the side of the grid using filter paper.\nPause point: You can incubate/store the grids in the fibronectin coating solution drop in a wet chamber at 4°C for at least a week.\nSeed cells on micropatterned grids:\nPrepare two Eppendorf tubes filled with PBS and a 2 × 9 well ibidi chamber slide and add 50 μL of warm GM into the wells except the middle and the corner ones (see Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Suitable wells of a nine well ibidi co-culture chamber slide",
    "To prevent overflow into neighboring squares, only use the ones marked with a green circle. If all grids in the 9 wells have the same treatment, the squares indicated with an orange circle can also be used.\nTake the grids out of the fibronectin coating solution drop using your tweezer and thoroughly wash them by subsequently submerging them (10–15 times) in the prepared Eppendorf tubes filled with PBS.\nOptional: Here, you could evaluate the integrity of your pattern when having used an ECM component conjugated to a fluorescent marker/dye (e.g., Alexa647-fibrinogen). Place the grids foil-side down in a drop of PBS on a microscopy support (e.g., ibidi dish or glass slide) instead and evaluate the pattern using fluorescence microscopy (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Visualization of a pattern on an UltrAUFoil 300 R0.6/1 grid coated with Alexa647-fibrinogen\n(A) Bright-field image of the grid.\n(B) Fluorescence image of the grid.\n(C) An overlay of (A) and (B).\nPlace the grid foil-side up into the medium-filled wells of the ibidi chamber slide. Make sure that the grid sinks to the bottom. You can carefully submerge the grid with the help of your tweezer if necessary.\nNote: When picking up the grid out of a drop of liquid, you would like to retrieve it vertically, so that the grid retains less liquid. Be aware that your tweezer also sucks up some liquid between the forceps, which will be released upon opening the tweezers. This could dilute your media. You could also carefully blot away excess liquid from the side of the grid using filter paper.\nPrepare your cells now by detaching the cells in the culture flask utilizing trypsin (as described in step 3 and optional step 4).",
    "Critical: It is important to stay consistent with the confluence of the cell layer at the time of trypsinization as well as the duration of the latter. Variations in these parameters will also lead to different durations for the cells to attach to the grid, which has implications for the time-point when to wash off cells from non-patterned areas of the grid. When adapting this protocol for a new cell line, it is a good start to carefully note the confluency and to keep track of the trypsinization duration (the longer the cells grow, the firmer they attach for some cell lines).\nPipet your A549 cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL Falcon tube to remove cell clumps.\nNote: Select the strainers mesh size according to your individual cell size properties.\nCount the cells (steps 4a–d).\nPrepare a dilution of 5 × 105 cells/mL in GM and apply 5,000 cells (10 μL) per grid.\nNote: Pipet with the pipet tip into the medium to prevent unequal distribution of the cells onto the grid.\nOptional: Pipet 10 μL of cells into a well filled with media but without a grid to get a visual impression how many cells gives you a good coverage (1–2 cells per grid square).\nNote: Do not use less than 10 μL, as less volume results in high local concentration of the cells on your grid. Dilute the suspension with GM instead.\nAlternatives: You can prepare a 1 × 105 cells/mL dilution and remove the media from the grids to then add 50 μL of cell suspension to the grid. This way you get a more equal distribution but also increase the risk of getting cells underneath the grid.",
    "Note: After seeding the cells onto the grid, wait 2 min to allow floating cells to settle onto the grid and check the distribution under a light microscope. If not satisfactory, add an additional appropriate number of cells.\nNote: When starting with a new cell line, it is advisable to prepare different dilutions and thus add different amounts of cells into the well with your grid.\nNote: Cells in the Falcon tube sediment rapidly. Thus, give the Falcon tube a gentle shake to homogenize the cell suspension before pipetting the cells out of the tube.\nTo allow cells to attach to the grid, transfer the ibidi chamber slide into a 10 cm culture dish and place it into an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 20 min.\nCritical: Depending on the duration of the trypsinization, cell type etc. you must adjust this wait time. It is advisable to prepare a time series, e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 min (you get 8 grids into one ibidi chamber slide), to get an impression of how long you have to wait until the cells attach properly to the grid.\nRetrieve the grids using a reverse action tweezer and wash off cells on the passivated areas by submerging the grid into an Eppendorf tube filled with media 10–15 times. Check the result by light microscopy.\nCritical: Handling biologically hazardous materials with sharp tools imposes the risk of incorporation! Make sure to perform a risk assessment and to take the necessary actions to protect yourself.\nNote: The passivation is not perfect, and you will observe cells attaching to non-patterned areas of the grid. See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: When seeding cells on micropatterned grids, you are always facing the trade-off between the total coverage of patterned areas and having single cells or the desired number of cells inside the individual grid square pattern. High seeding density means a high likelihood that all your patterns will be covered, but also to obtain more than one individual cell per pattern. Choosing too low seeding densities will result in bad coverage of patterned grid squares and will result in only a few cells in patterned areas.\nNote: You aim for individual (idle) cells inside the grid square as agglomerates of cells have worse freezing properties, which will result in poorly vitrified lamellae. See troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: See troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlace the grid into a new ibidi chamber slide well filled with GM.\nTransfer the ibidi chamber slide into a 10 cm culture dish and place it into an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Wait at least 2 h for the A549 cells to flatten out and adopting the micropatterned shape.\nNote: As cells are forced through the micropatterns to grow in isolation, not every cell type will tolerate this for long. Thus, check the vitality of your cells on the grids over a time course before you start with long time course experiments (>6 h on the grid) or performing precious experiments on them.\nNote: The time cells need to firmly attach to a grid and adopt the patterns shape depends on many factors (e.g., trypsinization duration, cellular fitness, cell type, the pattern itself, etc.). Thus, it is recommended to observe on a regular basis the growth of the cells on the grid and on this basis decide when to proceed with the experiment.",
    "Note: If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your seeded cells on the grids, see troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPerform the desired experiment and/or proceed with plunge freezing (step 27).\nOptional: Live-cell fluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 20 + 3 min per grid\nWhen available, live-cell fluorescence can be a great tool to indicate cells of interest for the following steps of sample preparation. In the example here, the cells are infected with HAdV5-pIX-mCherry. pIX, being one of the capsid proteins, is expressed in the infected cells and found first in the cytosol and later, when assembly starts, it is imported into the cell nucleus. The fluorescence signal can therefore indicate, even at relatively low magnifications, the stage of infection of each cell on the grid.\nNote that live-cell fluorescence is not suitable as basis for accurate correlated light- and electron (cryo)-microscopy (cryoCLEM). The cells are still moving and changing in the time between imaging and freezing. It is therefore not uncommon to see differences between the locations of cells post freezing and their respective live-cell fluorescent signal. To minimize this, the timing between imaging and freezing should be kept short. When preparing more than eight grids, consider preparing them in two batches, where the first eight grids are imaged and frozen, and then the next eight grids. This also helps avoid ice-contamination as you could dry the plunge-freezer between batches and start fresh.\nStart the microscope pc, lasers, coolers, camera, stage controller, temperature controller, CO2 controller and as last item the imaging software.",

    "Critical: If you are not familiar with the microscope or the settings that you need, be careful with photobleaching. To overcome the signal reduction from the grid, laser intensities are higher than usual. Start next to the grid to find rough settings and fine-tune on the grid. The carbon film usually requires a slightly stronger laser intensity compared to cells in the ibidi dish, and gold-foil blocks a significant portion of the signal (and suffers a bit more from reflections, so carbon is more suited).\nNote: To inspect images, look in the Right Panel.

    "Switch off everything that you have switched on, starting with the software and finishing with the computer (or according to the local instrument protocol).\nPlunge-freezing of grids\nTiming: 1 h per 8 grids (+1 h disinfection and cleaning time afterward)\nRapid freezing of the grids ensures the formation of vitreous ice, i.e., avoiding the formation of ice-crystals that would cause damage to the cell. Thereby, it preserves the cellular ultrastructure on the molecular level, making it possible to determine structural features to near-atomic resolution (Tegunov et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). LN2 cooled liquid ethane or the mixture of propane/ethane 63:37 (v/v) have sufficiently fast cooling rates to achieve this (Tivol et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). Mind that they also cause severe burns when in contact with skin so wear protective gear, e.g., safety glasses. When plunging at BSL2, a specialized biosafety cabinet (Model Claire XL, Berner, Elmshorn, Germany) is required! Normal biosafety cabinets have a circular airflow. This is not suitable for working with cryogenic gasses and can lead to explosive concentrations of gas. Furthermore, please consider that cryogens provide danger of suffocation. When not working under a specialized safety cabinet or chemical fume hood, make sure you are in a well-ventilated room.\nAssemble the plunger and take a bottle of fresh and clean LN2.\nCritical: Only plungers that are adapted to allow blotting from one side (the back) are suitable.",
    "Note: Here we have used a manual gravity plunger (custom-made in the MPI of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) (Rigort et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Dobro et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). An alternative plunger that is commercially available and allows one-sided blotting is the Automatic Plunge Freezer EM GP2 (Leica). Infected cells at late stages of infection are very loosely attached to the grid and also fragile, so we have never worked with a double-sided blotter. Other labs have successfully worked with double-sided blotter like the Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by using a water resistant material (Teflon sheet) on the cell-facing side of the grid in combination with low blotting force (Schaffer et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nNote: Work in batches of (no more than) 8 grids per plunging session to prevent ice contamination.\nNote: When doing the optional fluorescent imaging (step 10), make sure to start to cool down while imaging and try to have everything cold and ready simultaneously with finishing the image of the 8th grid. Waiting longer will cause ice contamination and will increase the time between imaging and freezing, leaving more room for the living cells to move around prior to being cryo-fixed.\nCool down the system with LN2. Avoid spilling LN2 in the ‘cup’ for the propane/ethane 63:37 (v/v).\nCritical: Working under BSL2 conditions requires wearing gloves. This poses an extra risk when working with LN2 as one is less acutely aware of the temperature changes when touching cold surfaces. Do not dip tweezers in LN2 for longer periods and be mindful of burning risks.",
    "Note: If you did spill LN2 into the ‘cup’ for liquid ethane, take a dry tissue and dip it into the nitrogen to take up the spill by capillary force. Take care with your hands and avoid touching the nitrogen for too long. Repeat with new tissue until the ‘cup’ is dry. This method is much faster compared to using warm objects to evaporate the nitrogen.\nNote: Wear a medical mask during all the steps that involve LN2. This will prevent the moist from your breath to cause ice-contamination and allows you to breathe freely when handling grids.\nCover the chamber to avoid ice-contamination (Styrofoam or paper towel) and wait for 10 min.\nNote: This allows everything to reach its lowest temperature. Starting too early, will make it more difficult to get a starting droplet of liquid propane/ethane in step 30.\nOpen the gas bottle and valve after the pressure valve, such that it is just before spilling gas and touch the nozzle of the tube connected to the gas bottle to the cold surface of the ethane ‘cup’. Wait a few seconds for the nozzle to cool and start a very slow gas-flow. Then fill the ‘cup’ as much as possible, i.e., until a convex meniscus is reached.\nNote: As soon as a small droplet of liquid has formed, the cooling rate will improve, and the gas flow can slowly be increased. Avoid excessive fogging.\nCover again with something light (make sure it is dry, if you use the same object), and wait for 10 min to allow the mixture to cool down.",
    "Critical: It is not sufficient that the gas is liquid; the temperature needs to go down as much as possible. With pure ethane, this means to wait until the edge of the container starts to show the first signs of solidification (at -182.8°C). Propane/ethane mixtures do not freeze at LN2 temperature (−196°C) but require some time to cool sufficiently.\nNote: We prefer the propane/ethane mix for ease of use and better freezing results.\nRetrieve the first grid from the ibidi chamber slide.\nNote: This is the only step for which we do not use reverse action tweezers but cover slip forceps (Dumoxel 5/45, mind the direction of the bend, Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A). Take care not to squeeze too hard to prevent damage to the grid.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

With the latter mark, include the side of the Autogrid as well for easier orienting the Autogrid assembly in the Krios loading station. The red mark faces down in the FIB specimen holder and one of the blue dots faces up in the Krios cartridge.",
    "Note: A heating plate can be used to keep your cells at the desired temperature if no incubator is available during plunging (ideally in combination with a CO2 independent medium). Take care not to let the medium dry.\nCarefully open the tweezers and place it on the bench. Grab the grid, which is now hanging lose from the tweezer-tip on your bench, over with a pair of plunging tweezers.\nCritical: Keep track of the foil-side of the grid as the grid adheres to either one of the tweezer-tips when you let the tweezer open.\nNote: Taking over the grid from the bend tweezers to the plunging tweezers is very hard to do without placing it first on the workbench.\nAdd a 5 μL droplet of medium on the foil-side of the grid.\nNote: This assures that the blotting paper gets in contact with the liquid and the additional volume significantly improves blotting reproducibility in our hands.\nPlace the tweezers with the grid into the manual plunge freezer.\nBlot for 8 s from the back of the grid (where the cells are not sitting) with Whatman No. 1 and plunge the grids into the liquid ethane/propane.\nCritical: Blotting at the foil-side will damage the cells.\nNote: Blotting time is dependent on grid-type, cell density, cell type and blotting paper and may need to be optimized for your specific conditions. We experience blotting times between 4–10 s are most suitable depending on grid type and cell density.\nNote: Blotting too long will lead to loss of cells.\nPlace the grid in a grid box precooled in LN2 and repeat the process until all grids are frozen.",
    "Note: When working fast, 16 grids may be possible, but it is not recommended to work with a system that is cold for longer than about 30 min after cooling, to avoid ice-contamination.\nNote: See troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nStore the grid boxes in a LN2 storage system or proceed directly with clipping.\nThaw the plunger setup. Be careful with the liquid ethane or ethane/propane mixture as it causes serious burns. Disinfect all surfaces that had contact with LN2.\nPause point: Once in LN2, the grids can be stored indefinitely. Be aware that some ice-contamination may built up in the storage over time.\nClipping of frozen grids into autogrids\nTiming: 1 h per 8 grids (+1 h disinfection and cleaning time afterward)\nThe high-end electron microscopes from Thermo Fisher Scientific™ all have holders that require the grids to be clipped into Autogrids, thus dedicated tools and a clipping station to do this.\nBefore cooling down the system, prepare the clipping tools by loading c-clips, and prepare the FIB-Autogrids by marking them (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).",
    "Critical: FIB-Autogrids have a wedge in the Autogrid wall that allows milling under a shallow angle. This wedge must be oriented such that it sits at the top of the FIB-shuttle. After FIB-milling, the grid is loaded in the electron microscope at a 90° angle to have the tilt axis across the width of the lamella so that the stage can be tilted to high angles without materials coming into view. While the wedge is easily visible at room temperature, working under nitrogen conditions complicates orientation in both systems. Take a red, and green or blue marker and put a small dot on the rim of the Autogrid in the middle across of the wedge and 2 dots in a clearly distinct colour at 90° and −90° degrees from that dot (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B). Now from the Autogrid rim the orientation is easily observed.\nNote: Black marks are less clear and look like reflections under LN2, which is why we prefer to use colours.\nCool down the clipping station.\nTransfer the first batch of grids, as well as the clipping tools into the LN2.\nClip the grids with cells facing down by creating an Autogrid-TEM grid-c-clip sandwich (Autogrid assembly).\nAfter flipping the Autogrid assembly in the stations groove to make sure that the clip is attached properly, put them in a grid box with the wedge-marking dot (in this case red) facing down.\nNote: When working under BSL2 conditions, tools need to be decontaminated after having been in contact with LN2 that has contacted BSL2 samples. Time can be saved when dropping sufficient pre-marked Autogrids into the clipping station before bringing in the grids, and by having at least 4 clipping tools, preferably 8.",
    "Note: Thermo Fisher Scientific provides a manual and video material to its customers. Next to that, an impression of Autogrid clipping can be found at: Cryo-EM Grid Preparation - Assembling autogrids[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJODLi3ZUU]. In contrast to the video, we use the dedicated tweezer from Thermo Scientific™ to handle Autogrid assemblies and we flip them a few times before storing them to check the stability of the clipping as an extra precaution.\nPause point: Once in LN2, the grids can be stored indefinitely. Be aware that some ice-contamination may built up in the storage dewar over time.\nLamella preparation using an Aquilos 2 Cryo-FIB\nTiming: 8 h per session, max 20 lamellae per session\nWhole cells are only transparent to the electron beam in the cell periphery. If the area of interest is deeper inside the cell, cryoFIB-milling is a mandatory step. In this process, material of the cell is ablated by a focused ion beam in such a way that only a thin lamella through the cell is left. The thickness of such lamellae is typically ∼200 nm, being thin enough to be directly transmitted by the electron beam (Marko et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Villa et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). The procedure described here is based on an Aquilos 2 cryo-FIB system (Thermo Fisher Scientific™), which has MAPS software installed and is equipped with the AutoTEM (Kuba et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) software for automated lamella milling. Alternatively, lamellae can be milled manually or with the help of academic auto-milling software (Klumpe et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Zachs et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]; Buckley et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nFollowing this protocol does not substitute instrument introduction and training as required in your microscopy facility to operate the instruments independently.\nCool down the Aquilos 2 loading station with LN2. Wait for minimal bubbling of the LN2.",
    "Make sure grids are clipped into Autogrids (see step 40).\nNote: TEM grids will be clipped into Autogrids to enable safe transfer in the autoloader of the TEM.\nTransfer 1 or 2 Autogrid assemblies from the grid storage box to the FIB/SEM shuttle taking care for correct orientation.\nNote: Use the mark opposite of the cut-out to orient the Autogrid assembly with cells facing up and the mark facing towards yourself. While the mark is well visible under the LN2 surface, the cut-out is hardly visible.\nNote: After fixing the Autogrid assembly in the shuttle, carefully and slowly flip the shuttle into loading position and check whether the Autogrid assemblies are secured properly.\nTransfer the shuttle from the loading station into the microscope chamber with an evacuated transfer rod.\nCritical: This should take no longer than 4 min, since samples are not actively cooled during transfer and will devitrify.\nInspect both grids with SEM images at the lowest magnification and judge the sample quality.\nNote: Increase magnification to be able to focus the image and link the stage to working distance prior to GIS deposition.\nNote: An ideal sample would have cells in the center of grid squares and an intact grid film and cells must not be covered by a thick layer of ice but should be easily recognizable. A small amount of vitreous medium around cells should provide support and stability to the sample.\nNote: Use MAPS to take tile sets of both grids.\nNote: See troubleshooting 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], troubleshooting 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and troubleshooting 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOptional: If you have performed live cell fluorescence imaging (see step 10), you should now load the fluorescence image of your selected grid.\nRight-click on a new Layer in the Layer control and select Import Images on the context menu that appears.",

    "Apply a milling protocol (template) suitable for the cell type. Common dimensions of lamellae are a width of 12 μm and a depth of 2 μm.\nNote: It is advisable to use the default template as a starting point. To create a template, which is time efficient for the sample cell size, it is advisable to monitor a full milling session with the milling currents and times for each step. By changing milling depth and correction factor, all milling times of each step will be modified at once.\nNote: Each step of rough, medium, fine and finer milling can further be modified separately. The goal is to set a depth correction for each milling step, which defines a suitable milling time for the step. All material within the patterns should just be milled away in the defined time. To create the most efficient milling template settings, it is advisable to monitor each milling step with a default depth correction of 100% and then modify the correction for each step. During milling, AutoTEM will provide the estimated milling time for each milling step, which is very helpful to judge if the template is suitable for the cell type.\nNote: When applying a template to lamella sites, it is not possible to undo and apply a new template after the preparation step.\nNote: A milling offset for each step will result in a more stable lamella. By applying a milling offset of 1 μm, the pattern width will be narrower with every step, creating step-shaped lamella corners.\nPerform the preparation step in AutoTEM.\nNote: Depending on the sample geometry, it is advisable not to enforce the target milling-angle to prevent the preparation step from failing. Usually, a target milling-angle of 8° can be achieved.",
    "Note: If the automated eucentricity procedure is not successful, milling a mark close to the target may be helpful. Additionally, a maximal tilt step of 5° improves the eucentricity procedure. The preparation step may fail for some lamella sites. These sites might be too close to the grid front.\nApply an organic platinum layer with the gas injection system (GIS) onto each grid. With a deposition of 17 s, a stable protective layer of ∼4 μm is established.\nNote: For automated milling a thicker platinum layer than usual turned out to be beneficial.\nNote: The duration of the GIS deposition depends on the condition of the source and needs to be determined empirically.\nRun the automated milling procedure without automated thinning, which we prefer to do manually.\nNote: For samples with ideal ice thickness around cells, automated thinning can be successful. If cells are only supported by dry film, stability tends to be insufficient for automated thinning. Thus, a thin layer of vitreous water on the support film is essential to increase the success rate of automated thinning (65%–85% as described in Tacke et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] and Klumpe et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) compared to manual thinning. As an alternative to TFS AutoTEM (Tacke et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) automated milling can be performed with SerialFIB (Klumpe et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: If milling and thinning are performed automatically, select the stepwise milling order. This way the milling step is finished for all lamellae and followed by the thinning step for all sites. The thinning should always be the last action of a milling session, to minimize redeposition of material on the lamellae inside the FIB chamber.\nNote: For further information of automated milling and the success rate, please refer to Tacke et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23].",
    "Note: AutoTEM saves the images of each preparation and milling step in the project directory. These images are very helpful when optimizing a milling protocol. Illustrations of intermediate milling steps as well as strategies for milling can be found in Schaffer et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19].\nAfter auto-milling is complete, lamellae are of a thickness of around 500 nm. Navigate to each lamella and perform manual thinning/polishing at a current of 30 pA.\nNote: Right click on thinning position in the AutoTEM site list and click polish position.\nNote: Place polish patterns into the voids, which should be 1 μm narrower than the void.\nNote: Some lamellae become slightly unstable, and the frontal GIS coat hangs down. In this case, only polish the top surface of the lamella.\nNote: The target thickness of the final lamella depends on the goals of the research. For example, a sub-tomography project may desire lamellae that are as thin as possible (below 200 nm), whereas cell-biology questions may benefit from the inclusion of more context and thus somewhat thicker lamellae (up to ∼400–500 nm).\nNote: The final lamella should be evenly dark gray in a 5 kV SEM image (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]) without stripes from insufficient polishing. To judge the lamella thickness from the SEM image, see Schaffer et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Workflow covering from the correlation of the fluorescence image with the SEM image to tomography data acquisition\nAfter loading the sample into the cryo-FIB and aligning the corresponding fluorescence image to the SEM image of the grid, sites can be selected for milling by placing milling positions.\n(A) The shown SEM image seems to contain one cell.\n(B) Fluorescence reveals that the location contains multiple cells.",
    "(C) Changing the opacity of the fluorescence image in the overlay allows pinpointing locations of interest with greater detail.\n(D–F) After selecting an area of interest with the scanning electron microscope, in this case an adenovirus infected human A459 lung cell (D), a pattern is drawn (E) to direct the gallium ion beam and to mill away the cellular material until a thin lamella is left (E and F).\n(G) Sideview of a cell after milling away the cellular material until a thin lamella is left. Panels (D) and (F) show the SEM image, and (E) and (G) the ion beam image (Dual Beam).\n(H) The sample is then transferred into a cryoTEM. It can be observed that only the lamella is transmitting electrons, whereas the remainder of the cell is too thick and therefore very dark.\n(I) A higher magnification image provides insight into the cell, showing here a part of the nucleus filled with HAdV5 virus particles.\nPanels D–H have been reproduced from Figure 7 from Franken et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]. Fluorescence in panels A–C stems from A549 lamin A/C mTagGFP (green) and from HAdV5 pIX mCherry (red) (Pfitzner et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nNote: See troubleshooting 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nApply a final sputter coat to the sample (1 kV, 7 mA, 5 s).\nNote: This will increase conductivity for TEM imaging and is crucial to overcome charging effects during tomogram acquisition.\nAcquire a final overview and take note of each milling angle of the individual lamellae. This information will be needed for later tomogram setup.\nUnload the sample from the FIB-SEM microscope.\nNote: Avoid contamination of the sample, by using clean LN2 during unloading.\nNote: Aim for a fast transfer (max 4 min) of the sample from the microscope chamber to the loading station.",
    "Note: Store the sample in special Autogrid sample boxes in LN2.\nPause point: Οnce in LN2, the grids can be stored indefinitely. Be aware that some ice-contamination may built up in the storage over time.\nElectron cryo-tomography of lamellae with a Titan Krios TEM\nTiming: 8 h per session + 1 overnight recording per grid + 2 h wrap-up and cleaning\nFollowing this protocol is not sufficient to operate the Krios instrument independently. An introduction to electron cryo-microscopy in general and intense training for the specific instrument in your institute is mandatory to conduct the following experiment. Furthermore, to follow this protocol prior knowledge in SerialEM image acquisition software is needed (Mastronarde, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPrepare the Krios loading station by filling the station with clean LN2 in a suitable work area according to the biosafety guidelines required for the sample.\nTransfer the sample boxes into the loading station with a pre-cooled tweezer.\nNote: Whenever handling samples, pre-cool tools in LN2 not too close to the sample.\nNote: Use dry and ice-free tools to keep the LN2 as clean as possible.\nCritical: Load the lamella sample in the correct orientation into the autoloader: lamellae must be oriented perpendicular to the tilt axis of the stage. In Krios instruments, the cut-out of the Autogrid must point to the side of the autoloader cassette, i.e., one of the blue marks should point up (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).\nNote: Take note of the side the cut-out is facing or keep the side consistent. This will be critical for tomogram setup.\nOptional: It is advisable to load an additional grid with a carbon film, to use it for the microscope alignment.\nTransfer the cassette into the NanoCab and dock the NanoCab to the Autoloader.",
    "‘Dock’ the cassette into the Autoloader. Safely dispose of the nitrogen from the NanoCab and disinfect it afterward.\nUse SerialEM to acquire gridmaps at low magnification (135×) of all samples in the cassette by running the mapgrids script (Hagen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], (https://serialemscripts.nexperion.net/script/21[href=https://serialemscripts.nexperion.net/script/21])).\nNote: Tick the option to create a map of each montage in the montage setup. Gridmaps will appear as items in the SerialEM navigator.\nInspect the gridmaps and assess the quality. Lamellae should appear as light gray areas in the image quality of the gridmap.\nNote: If lamellae are not oriented perpendicular to the tilt axis, consider reloading the grid.\nLoad the preferred grid, inspect each lamella at a medium magnification (3,600×) and high defocus and create lamella markers in the navigator (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nNote: After reloading a grid, the gridmap has to be realigned with the help of the SerialEM Navigator option “shift to marker” or “align with rotation”.\nNote: Avoid acquiring data on lamellae with cracks, large ice contamination or reflections from crystalline ice (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2016-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Series of selected tilt images from two unprocessed tilt series of cryoFIB-milled lamellae from Adenovirus (HAdV5-pIX-mcherry-ADP+) infected A549 cells\n(A) Example of a tilt series without radiation damage and with good (vitreous) ice. The reconstructed tomogram of this tilt-series can be seen in Pfitzner et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] Figure 3. (B) Example of a tilt series with radiation damage and bad (crystalline) ice. The radiation damage is likely the result of recording two tilt series in close proximity to each other leading to pre-exposure of the upper area of the displayed tilt series.",
    "These tilt series were recorded dose-symmetrically with a total dose of 110 e-/Å2 and a pixel size of 1.7 Å (A) and 3.4 Å (B) respectively. They originate from two different lamellae from the same grid. Each was recorded at the nuclear membrane of a cell, i.e., where the cell is already very thick and cryoFIB-milling was necessary to make this region of the cell accessible for cryoET.\nFor each tilt series, the first selected tilt image as well as the tilt image recorded with a horizontally flat lamella 0° for the tomogram, but with 9° tilted stage to compensate for the milling angle, (see step 72) contain annotated features: nucleoplasm (n), cytosol (c), adenoviruses (white arrows), ice contamination on top of the lamella (∗), crystalline ice (x) and radiation damage (r).\nNote: Curtaining (caused by dense objects in the sample that led to a stripy pattern of shades) may decrease the data quality, but lamellae are still usable.\nNote: At this stage, it is a good time to set the eucentric height by the automatic procedure for each lamella and update the z-height of each lamella marker in the navigator.\nNote: See troubleshooting 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and troubleshooting 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDecide on a magnification and defocus value for data acquisition.\nNote: It strongly depends on the scientific question in mind, which magnification to select. In initial steps of a project, it might be helpful to record data at a rather low magnification (e.g., 26,000×) and high defocus (-6 μm), to take advantage of the higher contrast. As soon as a specific goal is set, the magnification can be increased to fill the interested structure into the field of view of the detector. Simultaneously, the defocus should be decreased to gain resolution.",
    "Check the electron dose of your data acquisition settings, considering the ideal dose for the respective detector, as well as the maximum dose the sample can take before radiation damage occurs. The K3 direct electron detector operated in counting mode performs best with a dose rate of 15 e-/px/s. Consider the dose that your sample receives and the dose that the detector needs. Tilting the sample to 60° will double its thickness. The maximum total dose cellular samples can usually withstand is ∼100 e/Å2.\nNote: The ideal beam settings are a compromise of the ideal dose rate of the detector and a minimum beam size, to prevent an overlap of the record and focus area during tomogram acquisition.\nNote: Depending on the platinum layer and the biological material of your sample, radiation damage may occur after very different amounts of electron dose. It is advisable to take a “bubble-gram”, when working with a new sample. This includes taking long exposure images (e.g., 3 s) and observe the onset of visible radiation damage. It is to be expected, that invisible radiation damage may take place already with much less dose. The maximum dose a sample can take is the total exposure time of the bubble-gram times the electron dose rate in e-/px/s. An example of radiation damage can be found in Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B as well as Franken et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].",
    "Note: Calculate the exposure time of the tilt images based on the tilt scheme of the tomogram and set it in the camera setup. With a maximum dose of 100 e/Å2 and a typical tilt scheme (−60° to +60° with 3° increments), the dose will be spread over 41 images. Consequently, the exposure time for single images must be adapted to achieve 2.44 e/Å2 per image. Set the frame time to record dose fractionated data with 10 frames per image at 0° tilt. Tick the option for frame alignment or perform it during post-processing.\nNote: After dose calibration, SerialEM low dose mode and imaging states need to be updated.\nPrepare the microscope for data acquisition. Depending on the system and the regulations of the microscope facility, this includes preparation of gain references and direct alignments of the beam, as well as astigmatism correction and coma correction.\nNote: Microscope alignments should only be performed by experienced users.\nNote: It is advisable to first confirm that the sample is suitable for data acquisition, before aligning the microscope to be time efficient. Thus, we recommend loading the carbon grid from the cassette to the stage at this step of the protocol to perform the alignment.\nNote: After reloading the sample grid, the gridmap must be realigned with the help of the SerialEM Navigator option “shift to marker” or “align with rotation”.\nOptional: Perform alignments on the sample grid at a spot with a thin platinum layer and skip loading a continuous carbon grid.\nPerform a dose calibration in SerialEM, so that correct dose values will be saved in the corresponding tomogram document file (.mdoc-file).",
    "Target the first spot to acquire a tomogram, refine the eucentric height, tilt the stage to a relative 0° of the lamella and take an image in data acquisition magnification.\nNote: To bring the lamella to relative 0°, the stage needs to be tilted to the milling angle of the respective lamella. To find out if the stage needs to be tilted into negative or positive direction, take low magnification images at −60° and +60°. Compare the size of the lamella in both images. The direction, which resulted in the larger lamella image, is the correct starting angle tilt direction.\nNote: During this step, observe the lamella at the extreme tilts (−/+60°) to confirm, that tomography targets are not covered by the edge of the lamella or contamination.\nNote: By keeping the loading direction of the cut-out relative to the autoloader cassette consistent, the starting angle will be consistent, as well. Directing the cut-out to the back of the cassette during loading, will result in a positive starting angle.\nOptional: At this step, it is possible to setup all targets as a batch-tomography run (Hagen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nSetup tilt series acquisition with a dose symmetric tilt scheme (Hagen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Setup the dose symmetric tilt scheme in pairs of two. Two tilt images will be recorded before tilting to the other branch, to save time.\nNote: Depending on the sample thickness, it is advisable to increase the exposure time with the tilt angle, instead of keeping it constant (e.g., vary exposure time as 1/cosine to the power of ½).\nNote: If the stage of the system is very stable, it is not necessary to do an autofocus routine at every tilt angle. It could be reduced to every other or even less.",
    "Note: Perfect setting of the eucentric height is very critical for lamella tomography. It is consequently beneficial to repeat the refine eucentric height procedure before each tomogram.\nStart tilt series acquisition and observe if tracking and focusing works well, by paying attention to the focus values in the SerialEM log file.\nAfter all tilt series are acquired, finish the session with unloading the sample from the stage and autoloader.\nNote: Discard all LN2 as well as the samples according to the biosafety regulations suitable for the pathogen used.\nNote: Clean all the material, which had contact to the sample according to the biosafety regulations suitable for the pathogen used.\nCongratulations!\nYou acquired a tilt series of the lamella prepared from an infected cell.\nWe advise to perform the following inspection of data and tomogram reconstruction with the IMOD software package (Mastronarde and Held, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/[href=https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/]). Additional to data reconstruction, the package includes functions for tomogram segmentation and visualization. While there are many alternative image processing packages emerging, IMOD is ideal to get started."
