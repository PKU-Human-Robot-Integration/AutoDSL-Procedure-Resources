    "The test was performed in an observational, longitudinal study at University Children's Hospital of Basel (UKBB) with both adults and children. More demographics and clinical information about the study can be found in the previous publication13,14. All the procedures have been approved by the local ethics committee Ethikkomission UKBB and conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent and compliance with the study protocol according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulations were provided by all the subjects or the legally authorized representatives for children below the age of legal consent.\nNOTE: A prototype game \"Wardrobe\" aimed at measuring the joints' range of movement was designed and implemented. It was then exported as an executable application that can run on any Windows 8 or higher operating system, as long as the necessary 3-D sensor drivers are also installed. The prototype game based on Kinect sensor v1 or the second version (see Discussion) based on Kinect sensor v2 can be provided upon request (see Supplemental Coding Files).\n1. Setup and preparation for the test\nInstall the 3-D sensor (e.g., Kinect) drivers and the designed application on the computer.\nPlace the computer on a suitable surface, like a table, with a height of 0.5 - 1 meter.\nPlace the 3-D device also on the same surface aligned to the middle of the computer, so that the height of the 3-D camera is fixed by the table about 0.5 - 1 meter above the ground. Adjust the elevation angle of the 3-D sensor manually as needed to correctly capture the subject (see 2.4.2 below).\nConnect all the cables properly, including the 3-D adapter to the computer and the power cable to the power supply.",
    "Place a height-adjustable chair in front of the table with the computer and the 3-D sensor at about 2 meters.\n2. Conducting the test\nStart the computer and turn on the sound to an optimal volume. If automatic data transmission is desired, make sure the Internet is connected.\nInstruct the subject to sit on the chair.\nStart the application on the computer and enter the subject ID on the first page.\nClick on the \"START\" button on the first page to enter into the second page, which shows the \"Wardrobe\" game:\n\t\nNote the skeleton figure (upper body only) on the screen, which represents the body of the subject in front of a big wardrobe. When the figure is not seen, instruct the subject to wave and move forwards and backwards if he is in a wheelchair or stand up until the 3-D sensor captures the person.\nRead the instructions on the screen and adjust the distance, height, and lateral position of the chair and the subject accordingly until all the instructions are in green font.\n\t\tNOTE: The distance, height, and lateral position of the chair can be adjusted by the subject himself or a helper who should step out of the field afterwards. If the optimal height cannot be achieved, manually adjust the elevation angle of the 3-D camera. The optimal position is 2 meters away from the device, with the neck of the subject displayed in the middle of the screen.\nPress the TRAIN button to start the training session without data recording.\n\t\tNOTE: If the subject is already familiar with the game and knows what to do, press the START button directly and skip the training.\nLet the subject follow the instructions on the screen and perform the following movements:",
    "Extend the requested arm (right or left) to reach the flickering virtual object until the object is in the virtual hand.\nFlex the same arm and physically touch the indicated points on the body in order to place the object.\nContinue the arm extension and flexion movements until all 20 objects are reached and placed.\n\t\t\tâ€‹NOTE: There are two rounds with 10 objects in each round. Within a round there are 5 objects on the right side that require the right arm followed by 5 objects on the left side for which the left arm is asked. This concludes the training session.\nPress the \"START\" button to perform the same tasks again from the beginning, as in step 2.4.3, but this time recording the locations of the 9 upper body points into an encrypted file. The game automatically finishes by either placing all the 20 objects or when the pre-defined time (4 min) runs out.\n\t\tNOTE: It is also possible to quit the game at any time in case the subject is too weak or any other situations happen.\nEnter into the last page automatically which shows one spider plot indicating the joints' ranges from the \"Wardrobe\" game.\nExit the game by pressing the END button or repeat the test by pressing the REPEAT button.\n3. After the test - data handling\nSave the recorded and encrypted data and log files on the hard disk, and optionally transfer via internet to a data analyst. A detailed description of data handling and analysis has been provided in a previous publication13.\n\t\nConfirm the completeness and validity of the data by checking the log file and comparing clinical reports with the 3-D records.",
    "Compute and extract 27 movement characteristics as numeric features, like joint angles, velocity and acceleration, hand path length, body compensation movement, reachable space, and so on.\nCalculate, plot and select the features in order to understand and interpret the 3-D sensor data as well as for the following statistical analysis.\nPerform PCA (Principal Component Analysis), ANOVA (analysis of variance), correlation analysis and linear mixed effect models as statistical analysis."
