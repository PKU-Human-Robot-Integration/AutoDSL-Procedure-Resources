    "All experiments with zebrafish larvae were approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee of the University of Groningen according to national and EU guidelines.\n1. Sample Preparation\nFixation and Embedding\nFixation\nAnaesthetize fish larvae in tricaine (0.003%) added to the E3 (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6) zebrafish water and test for depth of anesthesia by poking gently with a 200 µl pipette tip under dissection microscope until motion is no longer detected (Figure 1A).\nWhen processing samples for correlative EM after acquiring in vivo imaging data using confocal or 2 photon imaging in 1.8% agarose as described,5,15 fix larvae in agarose using 4% PFA in PBS containing Triton-X-100 (0.05%).\nCut larvae from agarose and process for large-scale EM5.\nFix larvae in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing Triton-X-100 (0.05%) for 2 hr at room temperature in plastic tubes.\n\t\t\tNote: Cells grown in culture (in vitro) can be directly fixed in glutaraldehyde, as described in the next step (1.1.1.5).\nRemove solution and add 100 µl 0.5% PFA, 2% glutaraldehyde (GA), and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4). Store overnight at 4 °C. Rinse samples twice in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate.\nCut larval heads rostrally to the hindbrain to facilitate penetration of osmium. Use fine syringes/forceps.\nPostfix larvae in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4)/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate on ice for 2 hr and rinse 3 x 5 min in double distilled H2O.\nDehydrate in ethanol by 20 min incubations in increasing ethanol concentrations (50%, 70%, 3 times 100%).\nEmbedding\nPrepare epoxy resin according to standard recipes used in EM labs.",
    "Note: We use epoxy resin as follows: mix 19.8 g glycid ether 100, 9.6 g 2-dodecenylsuccinic acid anhydride and 11.4 g methylnadic anhydride using a magnetic stirrer. Add 0.5 g DMP-30 (tris-(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol) and mix again.\nIncubate larvae overnight in 50% epoxy resin in ethanol (v/v) while rotating (RT).\nReplace diluted epoxy-resin with pure resin. Incubate for 30 min, add fresh resin again and incubate for another 30 min. Again refresh the resin and then incubate 3 hr at RT, followed by 15 min at 58 °C and another 1 hr at RT under low pressure (200 mbar).\nOrient the heads in commercially available silicon flat embedding molds under a dissection microscope using a needle or toothpick with the anterior facing the side of the mold or as needed (Figure 1B).\nPolymerize epoxy resin overnight at 58 °C. If epoxy resin is still too soft allow another day to polymerize and harden at 58 °C. Test stiffness by applying pressure using forceps. If this easily leaves an indentation allow another day to polymerize and harden at 58 °C. When specimen is fully hardened proceed to trimming and sectioning.\nTrim away excess resin from the stub using razor blades (Figure 1B).\nSectioning, Contrasting, and Mounting\nSectioning\nSection epoxy resin block using an ultramicrotome.\nUse a glass knife or a diamond histoknife to cut semithin sections (500 nm) for toluidine blue/basic fuchsin (Figure 1D) staining to detect the right positioning.",
    "Transfer semi-thin sections on microscopic slides by picking them up with a glass Pasteur pipet whose tip has been closed by melting in a flame. Dry on a hot plate until no water is left. Stain for 10 sec with 1% toluidine blue in water on a hot plate and after rinsing with water, stain for 10 sec with 0.05% basic fuchsin in 1% sodium tetraborate. Examine with a normal light microscope at 10X to 40X.\nWhen the proper site/orientation within the brain is reached, continue sectioning the epoxy resin block with a diamond knife to cut ultrathin sections (~ 70 nm; Figure 1E)\nUse easily identifiable anatomic structures in and around the brain, including olfactory pits, eyes, grey-white matter boundaries, to identify the region of interest during ultrathin sectioning and to adjust the sectioning angle when the sample is tilted.\nMount section on single slot L2 x 1 copper grids (Figure 1F), to allow acquisition uninterrupted by grid bars. Use Formvar coated grids to support the sections.\nContrasting\nStain ultrathin sections on grids for 2 min in 2% uranyl acetate in methanol followed by Reynolds lead citrate for another 2 min 16.\n2. Image Acquisition\nLarge Scale STEM\n\tNote: We use scanning EM with an external scan generator capable of acquiring multiple large fields of view at high resolution3,5,7,17 using STEM detection. Typically, one image generated this way is equivalent to the fields of view of ~ 100 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images, significantly reducing the amount of stitching.\n\t\nMounting Sample in Microscope\nPlace grid with section in the multiple grid sample holder and transfer into the chamber of the SEM.\nAlignment of the STEM Detector",
    "Put the grid with the sample under the beam and move it up so it will be approx. 5 mm from the lens pole. Acquire an image at 20 kV using the in-lens detector.\nFocus on grid edge and adjust working distance to 4.0 mm.\nMove the sample holder to a safe position and bring in the STEM detector.\nCenter the hole of the STEM detector in the image-field by turning the adjustments screws while imaging at maximum speed with the in-lens detector.\nCarefully bring back the sample holder which will just fit between the lens pole and the detector.\nAcquire an image with the in-lens detector to be sure to be on the section area.\nSwitch to STEM detection (gain medium and all quadrants set on 'minus') and acquire an image and select the area to be scanned.\nRaise acceleration voltage to 21 kV and wait for stabilization of the beam (stable image again) and then go to 29 kV in steps of 2 kV.\nAcquiring Images\nPre-irradiate the sample (to prevent brightness changes caused by the e-beam) by zooming out so the complete area to be scanned fits the image window.\nChange aperture to 120 µm (to keep the proper dynamic range the detector gains have to be reduced one step).\nDe-focus so the image is blurred.\nMake the scanned area as tight as possible using the reduced area scan option.\nSet scan speed such that a frame is scanned in approx. 1 - 2 sec.\n\t\t\tNote: Depending on the size and tissue this typically takes ½ hr (100 x 100 µm FOV) to up to 3 hr (1,000 x 500 µm).\nZoom in at least 100X and scan a small area for 10 sec.",
    "Note: When this area does not change brightness compared to its surrounding, pre-irradiation is sufficient.\nBring back the 30 µm aperture (and STEM gain on medium)\nFocus the sample.\nAlign aperture using the wobbler (at ~ 40,000X magnification).\nWhile in focus select the lightest area/feature, set scan speed such that details are visible.\nIn the microscope software adjust brightness and contrast by carefully watching the histogram to keep all pixels in the dynamic range. Do the same for the darkest area/features.\nGo back to the bright area and check again. Be on the safe side so there is some space on both sides of the histogram.\nZoom out so the complete area to be scanned fits the imaging window, and start the large area acquisition program.\nUse the wizard option to set up a mosaic by selecting an area from the screen. Use pixel size 2 - 5 nm depending on what details are necessary. Use dwell time 3 µs for STEM.\nSelect option \"autofocus on previous tile\", use the large scale acquisition software autofocus with default company settings, check box \"verify setting prior to execution\" and define where to save the data.\nPress \"optimize\" to check microscope settings.\n\t\t\tNote: Now the time needed will be shown. This might be up to 72 hr for 1 x 0.5 mm areas.\nIn window \"maximum tile resolution\" type 20,000 so individual tiles will not be bigger than 20k x 20k, preventing blunt edge effects. Press \"execute\".\nWhen asked for checking focus and Brightness/Contrast (B/C), switch off external scan generator and carefully adjust focus and astigmatism in the microscope software. Do not change B/C.\n\t\t\tNote: The stage can be moved and magnification changed, but magnification has to be set back to the desired pixel size.",
    "Switch on external scan generator again and press \"continue\".\n3. Data Analysis\nOpen large-scale EM file viewer program and open the file \"mosaic info\". This will open all the tiled tif-files. This preferably is performed on another workstation to not obstruct new acquisitions.\nChoose option 'auto stitch entire mosaic (parameters overlap mode on half, stitching threshold 0.90, noise reduction automatic. In case stitching criteria cannot be fulfilled, zoom in and manually place tile in position and click 'continue as is').\nExport as an html file, or alternatively as a single TIF.\n\tNote that for TIF export a downscaling might be needed. Include the final pixel size in the file name enabling measurements later.\nPerform annotations in the TIF file by opening it in an image editing program. In parallel, open the zoomable html file in a web browser for optimal resolution observation."
