    "1. Making the PDMS Chip\nTo make a PDMS chip from the SU-8 mold, follow steps 1.1-1.7. If a chip is on-hand, but needs to assembled for use, skip to step 1.8.\nMix 45 g of PDMS base and 4.5 g of curing agent (10:1 ratio) from a PDMS kit in a small disposable plastic container and mix them thoroughly using a plastic stir stick.\nPlace the container in a vacuum container (e.g. a desiccator) for 10 min to remove any bubbles.\nPlace the SU-8 mold at the bottom of a 150 mm in diameter plastic dish and slowly pour the PDMS mixture on the mold. Take care not to generate bubbles while pouring the PDMS.\nCure the PDMS in an oven (or incubator) at 650 °C for 4 hr.\nRemove the cured PDMS/SU-8 mold from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.\nUsing a razor blade, cut the cured PDMS along the edge of the SU-8 mold and detach it from SU-8 mold.\nDivide the PDMS slab into individual PDMS chips using a razor blade.\nUsing a 21 G dispensing needle, poke a hole in the vacuum port (depicted in Figure 1A) of the PDMS chip.\nTake a 23 G dispensing needle and twist the needle tip from its base a few times to break the needle tip off from the lock hub.\nInsert the 23 G needle tip into a small piece of polyethylene tubing so that the tubing covers at least a millimeter of the needle. Then use a razor blade to cut the excess tubing away from the needle. This creates a plastic ring around one end of the needle, which will create a seal when inserted into the vacuum intake port.",
    "For use with an inverted microscope (Figures 1B and 2A-B): insert the 23 G needle tip into the hole of the vacuum port. For use with an upright microscope (Figures 1C and 2C-D): poke a second hole on the side of the PDMS chip with a 21 G dispensing needle; this hole will provide access to the first hole from the side. Then insert the 23 G needle tip with tubing ring into the side hole. Place a piece of double-sided tape over the top of the PDMS chip to seal the top hole (Figure 1C).\nTake a piece of polyethylene tubing that is approximately 20 cm in length. Connect one side of the tubing to the needle tip that is inserted into the vacuum port.\nConnect the other side of the tubing to one of the ports of a 3-way valve (see '3-way stopcock' in the list of materials)\nAttach a 20 ml syringe into one of two remaining ports. The last port is open to the environment.\n2. Using the Larva Chip for Live Imaging\nClean the PDMS chip with transparent adhesive tape. Attach a piece of tape to the bottom of chip. Make sure the tape is touching the entire PDMS surface, and then peel off the tape.\nRepeat the above step 2-3x to make sure there are no particles or oil (retained from previous experiments) on the surface of the PDMS chip. Since the PDMS chip is reusable, it is very important to remove oil residue as it can affect the adhesion of PDMS to glass and result in inadequate sealing.",
    "Transfer early (i.e. foraging) 3rd instar larvae to a Petri dish containing water. (The foraging 3rd instar stage larvae are in the food, rather than the side of the culture vial). Bathe the larvae in water to remove culture medium.\nTake a clean glass coverslip and place a small drop of Halocarbon 700 oil at its center.\nUsing forceps, gently pick up a clean, early-staged 3rd instar larva from the water (the larva should be ~3.5-4 mm in length). Place the animal briefly on a lightweight wipe or paper towel to remove excess water, and then place it on the oil drop. The drop should be small enough such that the trachea of the larvae are not coated. Let the larva stay on the oil drop for 10 sec.\nRemove the larva from the oil drop and then place it on a clean glass coverslip.\nTransfer the larva to another clean glass coverslip. This step removes excess oil.\nPay attention to larva orientation. For imaging the neural cord and segmental nerves, the ventral side of larva should sit on the coverslip. Its dorsal side, characterized by two longitudinal tracheal tubes, should face upwards. Note: this is the orientation the larva prefers naturally.\nGently place the PDMS chip on top of the larva. The larva should be aligned to center middle of the microchamber, with its tail oriented towards the vacuum port. Be careful that the larva does not touch the edges of the chamber. This is especially important for the anterior and posterior tracheal terminals. Note: this step is best done under a stereomicroscope.\nPush the PDMS chip against the glass coverslip to achieve a good seal. Ensure that the larva is entirely enclosed by the microchamber when the PDMS chip is touching the glass coverslip.",
    "Switch the 3-way valve on such that the syringe can draw air from the PDMS microchamber (through the tubing) to create a vacuum.\nWith one hand, hold the PDMS chip/glass coverslip firmly. Use the other hand to pull the syringe plunger. Withdraw 2-2.5 ml of air, until resistance is felt in the syringe handle, to create vacuum. The vacuum produces a tight seal between the PDMS chip, oil, and coverslip interfaces and restricts the mobility of the larva.\nSwitch the valve off such that the PDMS chip is isolated from the syringe and from the environment. As a result, a relatively stable vacuum level is maintained in the microchamber without the need for holding the syringe plunger.\nCheck the larva under the stereoscope to make sure that the entire animal body is placed inside the microchamber, and that the animal is immobile. The trachea should be visible. The rest of the PDMS chip should be in contact with the coverslip. Note: See Figures 2E and 2F for examples of animals correctly immobilized in the chip. Some incorrect orientations are shown in Figures 2G and 2H.\nPlace the larva chip (PDMS chip+ glass coverslip) on the microscope. The larva chip, the tubing and the syringe should be handled carefully to avoid detachment of the PDMS chip from the coverslip. For an upright microscope, fix the 'top' side of the chip to the microscope stage with double-sided tape (Figure 1C).\nUse a high-magnification objective (oil-immersion, 40-63X is recommended) to locate the animal's structure(s) of interest and perform the imaging. In some cases, a lower magnification may be needed to identify the desired region for imaging before switching to higher magnification.\nWhen imaging is completed, release the vacuum by switching the valve to the position that is open to the environment.",
    "Detach the PDMS chip from the coverslip. The larva should be immediately motile.\nUse forceps to remove the larva from the microchamber and gently place the larva on a grape-juice agar plate for recovery.\n3. Inducing a Nerve Crush Injury to Larval Segmental Nerves\nFollow step 2.3 above to isolate early staged 3rd instar larvae of the desired genotype. As described in step 2.3 bathe the larvae in water to remove the food.\nUse a standard fly CO2 anesthetization station, with CO2 pad kept under a dissection stereomicroscope, to subdue the larvae. Larvae should become immotile after placement on CO2 pad for 1-2 min.\nNow place a single anesthetized larva onto a grape juice agar plate under the stereomicroscope. Turn the animal ventral side up to visualize the ventral nerve cord and segmental nerves through cuticle (Figure 3). Make sure that the larva is completely immotile.\nUsing Dumostar number-5 forceps, pinch the segmental nerves tightly through the cuticle for 5-10 sec. When this is done correctly, the cuticle remains intact and the body wall is not pierced. Note: The injury can be conducted at different positions along the anterior-posterior body axis, as long as the ventral nerve cord, salivary glands, and intestines are not damaged. The most effective injury location is towards the end of the 3rd abdominal segment, as shown in Figure 3D. Injury at this location damages the most nerves and is the easiest to reproduce without killing the animal.\nAfter the injury, turn the animal so that its ventral side down on the grape plate. It should be able to move its head and eat. If the injury was successful, then the posterior half of the larva will be paralyzed.",
    "Keep the injured animals on the grape juice agar plate at 25 °C for the desired time according to the experimental objective. For motoneurons, the proximal stump begins to sprout within 8-10 hr of injury14, and the distal stump starts to degenerate within 6-8 hr15. For class IV da sensory neurons, the proximal stump begins to sprout within 4-6 hr, and the distal stump start to degenerate within 3-4 hr after injury. Note: with appropriate Gal4 drivers and fluorescent reporters, the sprouting and degeneration can be observed in the larva chip (for example, see Figure 6)."
