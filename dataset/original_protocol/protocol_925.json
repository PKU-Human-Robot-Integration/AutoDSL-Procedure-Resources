    "**Metabolic Labeling**\n1. Culture K562 cells at 37°C to approximately 50% confluence in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S \\(e.g., 5 mL of 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in 6 well tissue culture plates). \n  2. Dissolve 4-thiouridine in a minimal volume of water \\(e.g. 25 mM stock solution) and add to 5 mL cultured cells at 100 µM final concentration. Agitate cells gently to evenly distribute the metabolic label. Incubate 4 h at 37°C.\n   Note: Take steps to protect 4-thiouridine treated cells and RNA in all subsequent steps from light exposure.\n Note: 4-thiouridine treatment time and concentration will vary by cell type and desired application. We provide an example above for K562 cells to examine relatively long RNA half-lives.\n3. Transfer cells from each well to separate 15 mL conical Eppendorf tube and place on ice for 1 min.\n  4. Pellet cells for 3 min at 300xg, 4°C in a pre-chilled centrifuge. Aspirate cell culture medium from cell pellet. \n  5. Rinse pellet with ice-cold 1X PBS then pellet and aspirate as in step 4. Proceed immediately to modified RNeasy isolation \\(recommended), or store cell pellet at -80°C.\n  \n**Modified RNeasy isolation**\n6. Resuspend cell pellet in 350 µl RLT buffer supplemented with 35 µl BME \\(1% final). Pass cell suspension through a 22-gauge needle 5 times to lyse the cells and transfer the mix to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\n  7. Add 350 µl freshly prepared 70% ethanol to the lysis mixture and mix well by inversion. Transfer 700 µl of mixture to an RNeasy spin column, and centrifuge >10,000 RPM for 15 sec. Discard flow through.\n  8. Add 700 µl buffer RW1 to column and centrifuge >10,000 RPM for 15 sec. Discard flow through.",
    "9. Add 500 µl buffer RPE supplemented with 50 µl BME \\(1% final) to column and centrifuge >10,000 RPM for 15 sec. Discard flow through. \n  10. Add 700 µl freshly prepared 80% ethanol to column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 2 min. Transfer column to fresh collection tube and centrifuge at maximum speed for an additional 5 min. \n  11. Transfer column to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and add 30 µl DEPC-treated water directly to column membrane. Let column stand 1 min, then centrifuge >10,000 RPM for 1 min. Assess RNA concentration by nanodrop. \n   Note: Incubating spin column at 65°C for 5 min prior to centrifugation increases total RNA yield.\n**TimeLapse chemistry**\n12. Dilute RNA to 2 µg in 8.7 µl DEPC-treated water \\(less RNA may be used if desired, 10 ng of total RNA is recommended for library preparation after TimeLapse chemistry).\n  13. Create a master mix by combining the following reagents \\(15 µl total per sample, multiplied by number of samples, +10% to account for pipetting errors) on ice: 0.84 µl 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.2; 12.7 µl DEPC-treated water; 0.2 µl 0.5M EDTA, pH 8; 1.3 µl TFEA. Combine well by vortexing.\n   Note: TFEA is volatile. Pipette up and down several times prior to dispensing the reagent to ensure vapor pressure equilibration and accurate volumes.\n14. Add 15 µl master mix from step 13 to RNA sample from step 12 in a 0.2 ml PCR tube. Combine well by flicking PCR tubes, and briefly spin to collect sample at bottom of tube.\n  15. Add 1.3 µl of 192 mM solution of NaIO<sub>4</sub> in DEPC-treated water \\(freshly prepared, 10 mM final concentration). Combine well by flicking PCR tubes several times, and briefly spin to collect sample at bottom of tube.",
    "16. Incubate samples at 45°C for 1 h in a pre-heated PCR thermocycler with a heated lid. Cool sample to 4°C after incubation.\n  17. Add an equal volume \\(e.g. 25 µl) of RNAClean beads to each sample and gently vortex to combine. Incubate at room temperature 10 min. \n   Note: An aliquot of RNAClean beads should be brought to room temperature for 30 min prior to use.\n18. Briefly spin to collect sample at bottom of tube, and place on a magnetic isolation rack until solution is clear \\(~5 min).\n  19. Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing bead pellet, and wash beads twice with 200 µl of freshly prepared 80% ethanol.\n  20. After removing second ethanol wash, briefly spin tubes, and recapture beads on magnetic isolation rack for 1 min. Remove residual ethanol with a pipette and allow bead pellet to dry \\(2-4 min).\n   Notes: A small crack will appear when beads are dried. Do not over-dry beads.\n21. Add 18 µl of DEPC-treated water to dried beads. Flick tubes until beads are completely resuspended, and allow to rehydrate for 2 min.\n  22. Briefly spin tubes, and place on magnetic isolation rack until solution is clear \\(~2 min).\n  23. Carefully collect the supernatant and transfer to a fresh PCR tube strip. \n  24. Prepare a 10X reducing master mix \\(100 µl recipe): 10 µl 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 10 µl 1 M DTT; 20 µl 5 M NaCl; 2 µl 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8; 58 µl DEPC-treated water. \n  25. Add 2 µl master mix from step 24 to 18 µl of supernatant from step 23 and mix well to combine. Spin tubes briefly, and incubate samples at 37°C for 30 min.",
    "26. Add an equal volume \\(e.g. 20 µl) of RNAClean beads to each sample and gently vortex to combine. Incubate at room temperature 10 min.\n  27. Repeat steps 18-20.\n  28. Add 12 µl of DEPC-treated water to dried beads. Flick tubes until beads are completely resuspended, and allow to rehydrate for 2 min.\n  29. Repeat steps 22-23.\n  30. Assess concentration and quality of RNA by bioanalyzer.\n  31. Proceed to RNA-seq library preparation using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit-Pico Input Mammalian."
