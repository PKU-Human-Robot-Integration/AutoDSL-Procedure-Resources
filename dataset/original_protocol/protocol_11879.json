    "1. Hardware Setup and Preparation of Materials\nNOTE: Please see Table 1 and Table of Materials for preparation of solutions, reagent, and equipment details.\nSet up a dissecting microscope in order to see eggs and guide the injection needle. (Figure 1A shows a dissecting microscope equipped with fluorescence.) Fluorescence capability is advantageous but not necessary.\nPosition a 3-axis micromanipulator to maneuver the injection needle into place (Figure 1A).\nSet up a microinjector with tubing and a needle holder to inject small amounts of material (Figure 1A). Optionally use a foot pedal which is not shown in the figure.\nDesign and create a stamp to create wells for eggs (Figure 1C) by printing the inverse of the desired pattern, either with a 3D printer or a laser engraver.\nNOTE: The 3D printed sample stamp shown is 4.5 cm x 5 cm with 128, 3 cm x 1 cm x 1 mm protrusions for creating individual wells. Details on how to make a variety of customizable molds have been published elsewhere16.\nPrepare 10x Injection Buffer, HEPES buffered saline (HBS), and a stock solution of Tetramethylrhodamine Dextran dye and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare experimental solutions to be injected, such as dsRNA, CRISPR/Cas912, transposable elements, in vitro capped mRNA7,8, pharmacological agents17, ZFNs, or TALENS9.\nPlace double-stick tape on several layers of standard lab tape on a glass microscope slide in order to create a platform 1 mm or so above the glass slide, which will be used for holding needles for the assessment.\nPrepare a cricket container approximately 40 cm x 60 cm in size with a lid possessing a mesh-covered opening for air circulation.\nAdd food, water, and sheltering materials.\nAdd several dozen healthy male and female adult crickets. Identify adult cricket by the presence of wings.",
    "NOTE: A range of post-imaginal ages may increase egg yields. The density of crickets should be relatively high in order to be able to collect enough eggs for an experiment, but not so crowded that cannibalism occurs. For example, approximately two dozen healthy crickets, with a roughly equal male to female ratio, in a container of the size noted above should be sufficient to collect about 200 eggs in a one to two h period. Crickets can be kept at room temperature, but development and behavior will be optimal if crickets are maintained in a warm (23.5–26 °C), humid (40 - 60% relative humidity) incubator.\n2. Making Needles for Injection\nUse Borosilicate Glass Capillaries with filament (see the Table of Materials for size details). Prepare the pull needles on the same day, or up to a few days before injections are completed.\nPlace a capillary glass into the puller, center the glass on the filament, and tighten the knobs to secure the glass in place.\nSet the puller temperature near the glass ramp temp (-5 °C to +10 °C).\nUse a single-step, high-heat protocol to pull a long taper with a small opening but avoid melting the ends closed.\nNOTE: For example, when using the micropipette puller detailed in the Table of Materials equipped with a box filament, use the following parameters for glass with a ramp temperature of 478: Heat 478; Pull 45; Vel 75; Del 120. Optimal conditions for producing a needle with the shape shown in Figure 2B should be determined empirically by each user.\nBevel needle tips in preparation for the injections.\nWet the spinning grinder plane of the beveler (Figure 2A) with dripping water. Use either reverse osmosis (RO) or diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated distilled water.",
    "Place the pulled needle into the beveler and turn to a 20° angle.\nLower the needle until it just touches the grinding plane and bevel for 2 to 3 min.\nAssess the bevel by placing the beveled needle on double-stick tape that has been adhered to a glass microscope slide.\nPlace the slide holding the needle on the stage of a compound microscope equipped with a camera and image acquisition software.\nAcquire an image of the needle tip using a 20x objective.\nUse the imaging software to measure the interior lumen diameter of the needle just proximal to the beveled opening (Figure 2C). The optimal size is 10 µm + 2 µm.\nDiscard needles that have an opening below 8 µm and above 12 µm.\nStore the needles in a container with a lid to avoid getting dusty. Use a strip of wax or similar material to elevate the needles off the bottom of the container to prevent breaking the tips (Figure 2D).\n3. Egg Collection and Preparation\nMaximize the number of eggs laid by depriving crickets of any moist laying material (water vials, egg dishes) overnight or for at least 8–10 h before attempting to collect eggs.\nNOTE: Since females have the ability to internally store sperm, a differently timed procedure may be necessary if carefully timed fertilization is experimentally essential18.\nMake 40 mL of 1% agarose in water and pour into a 10 cm petri dish.\nPlace an egg-well stamp on the surface of the agarose before it solidifies.\nRemove the stamp, once the agarose is solidified, to reveal the wells (Figure 1C).\nFill the agarose well plate with HBS containing 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nPlace the lid on the dish, wrap in parafilm and store at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Dishes can be stored for a few days at 4 °C but should be warmed up to room temperature before use to avoid condensation.\nMake an egg collection dish for crickets to lay eggs in by filling a 35 mm petri dish with white playground sand (Figure 1B).\nNOTE: The sand specified in the Table of Materials is of the appropriate grain size. If the sand grains are too large, the sand will damage the eggs.\nCover the egg dish with a square of paper towel cut to be approximately 18 cm x 18 cm, and place on the top of dish with sand. Through this paper towel cover the filled dish with tap water.\nTilt the petri dish and gently squeeze the top to remove excess water.\nTuck the corners of the paper towel square under the dish and place the egg dish in the inverted lid, which will help keep the paper towel cover in place.\nPlace the egg dish into the cricket bin and allow the adult females to oviposit eggs for one to two h.\nNOTE: The relatively short time here ensures that all the eggs will be similar in the stage of development at the time of injection. If injection before cellularization is important, injections should occur within 14 h of egg laying19.\nMeanwhile, allow the agarose dish (from step 3.6) to warm to the room temperature in preparation for holding eggs for injection.\nRemove egg collection dish, now containing freshly laid eggs, from the cricket bin, and remove the paper towel cover. Place a strainer with a pore size of 0.5–1 mm over a beaker of at least 500 mL capacity (Figure 1B).",
    "Rinse the contents of the egg-laying dish (sand and eggs) into the strainer under gently running tap water letting the sand grains fall through the strainer mesh into the water in the beaker below but leaving the cricket eggs in the strainer basket.\nFill a container with RO water and place it in a tray. Invert the strainer over the container and tap it against the dish to dislodge the eggs into the water. The eggs will sink to the bottom of the container.\nCut the tip off a P1000 pipette tip with scissors to make an opening approximately 3 mm in diameter. Place this tip on a P1000 pipettor and use it to transfer the eggs from the container to the agarose egg mold dish, transferring as little water as possible.\nUse plastic tweezers to line up eggs in agarose wells filled with HBS plus 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Each egg will sink to the bottom of an individual well. Cover with the petri dish lid until ready to inject.\n4. Prepare the Microinjector\nAttach the microinjector to a compressed air or gas source (this protocol was optimized using either compressed air or N2).\nNOTE: If using a portable air tank, fill to at least 75 psi. The tank will lose air pressure throughout the injections and may need to be refilled; injections become difficult below 40psi.\nTurn on the microinjector. Set the injection time to 0.17 s and the pressure to 10–15 psi.\nNOTE: The exact pressure needed will depend on the opening of the needle and must be determined empirically for every round of injection and/or new needle used.\nEnsure that the BALANCE knob of the microinjector is turned to 0 (typically fully counter-clockwise) and that the microinjector is pressurized and in the injection mode.\n5. Injections",
    "Filter about 500 µL of 10x Injection Buffer using a 1 mL syringe and a 0.45 µm syringe filter.\nMix injection reagents (the details that follow are for the injection of dsRNA prepared as described in12).\nNOTE: It may be advisable to design and perform several controls, especially when one is first learning this technique. Poking eggs without injecting, injecting buffer + dye alone, or injecting buffer + dye + a control reagent (such as eGFP dsRNA) are all good tests of how disruptive various elements of the injection protocol might be. See Figure 3 for the survivability of a number of different controls.\nStart with a 4 μL dsRNA aliquot.\nAdd 0.5 μL of the filtered 10x Injection Buffer to the dsRNA aliquot.\nAdd 0.5 μL of 50 mg/mL Tetramethyl rhodamine Dextran dye stock solution. If working on a dissecting scope without fluorescence, use Phenol Red instead.\nKeep all materials on ice for the duration of the injection period.\nLoad the injection solution into an injection needle using 20 μL loading tips and a p10 pipet.\nDraw up a 1.5 μL injection solution and insert the loading tip into the wide end of the injection needle.\nEject solution as far down into the needle as possible and eliminate air bubbles by flicking gently; be careful not to break the needle.\nPlace the dish of eggs under the dissecting microscope and select a low magnification of around 10x (1x magnification viewed through 10x eye objectives).\nInsert the needle into the injection housing and tighten.",
    "NOTE: Take care that the needle is properly and firmly inserted into the housing. To do this, pull the wide end of the needle back out of the metal housing, bringing the silicon tubing in the housing with it. Adjust the silicon tubing so that the glass end of the needle protrudes just beyond the silicon. If this is not done, the silicon tubing may get pinched between the glass and the metal housing, blocking the end of the needle.\nCarefully insert the injection housing with an attached needle into the micromanipulator. Be aware of the sharp end of the needle and be careful that it is not bumped into surfaces and broken.\nWhile looking at both the eggs and the needle through the microscope, move the needle near the eggs in the top left corner of the dish grid.\nLower the needle until the tip enters the HBS plus 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin buffered solution in the dish.\nCenter the needle in the field of vision and move the egg dish so that the needle is a few mm closer to the edge of the dish than the eggs.\nDo not obstruct the view of the grid of eggs with the needle.\nSet the microscope to the filter appropriate for Rhodamine so it is possible to observe the fluorescence in the needle and focus on the tip of the needle.\nOn the microinjector, slowly turn the BALANCE knob clockwise until the injection solution starts to leak out of the needle into the suspension solution. The balance number on the screen of the microinjector will begin to increase, though the numerical value is not important. Next, turn the knob back counterclockwise slightly just until the dye stops leaking out of the needle.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to set this balance each time a new needle is used. Without the balance set appropriately, the microinjector will continue to inject for some time after the injection is triggered. It is even possible that a single push of the injection button with an unbalanced needle will result in the expulsion of the entire contents of the loaded needle.\nWith the needle centered in the field of view, move the egg dish so that the needle is aimed at the egg to be injected first. It is recommended that injections start in one corner of the grid of arranged eggs, for example, the upper left corner.\nAdjust the magnification to about 50x; at this magnification, a single egg will fill most of the field of view.\nUse both the micromanipulator and one’s hand on the egg dish to move the needle into position for the injection.\nAdvance the needle using the micromanipulator and insert the tip of the needle into the first egg to be injected.\nInsert the needle at 20–30% egg length from the posterior (blunter) end of the egg (Figure 1E), perpendicular to the long axis of the egg.\nInject solution either with the injection foot pedal or the injection button on the microinjector. A small bolus of fluorescent material inside the egg will indicate a successful injection (Figure 1D).\nNOTE: It is not uncommon for some yolk to be ejected from the egg during injection (Figure 1F), and this does not necessarily indicate that the injected egg will be inviable.\nRetract the needle from the egg. If the egg is unintentionally lifted out of its well upon retraction of the needle, use small forceps to push the egg back into its well while retracting the needle.",
    "If the needle clogs during injection, remove the needle from the egg and, keeping the needle submerged in the HBS plus 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin solution covering the eggs, clear the clogged needle using either the Clear function or by pushing the inject button.\nContinuing to use the same needle, repeat the injection procedure for as many eggs as possible. At first, this may be only about 20 or 30 eggs but will increase to over 100 with practice.\nIf the needle becomes clogged and cannot be cleared, discard the needle, fill a new needle and begin again (i.e., return to step 5.7).\nStore the dish of injected eggs in a warm incubator (23.5–26 °C) that is slightly humid (to minimize the evaporation) until the embryos have reached the desired stage of development for the analysis.\nAt least every 24 h, remove eggs that are no longer viable (Figure 3A,B), and replace the suspension solution with fresh HBS plus 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nTwo to three days after injection, transfer the eggs by gentle pipetting or with plastic forceps to paper towels moistened with HBS plus 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin in a lidded petri dish to continue development in the warm, humid incubator.\nMonitor the eggs, and remove eggs that are no longer viable each day (Figure 3A,B).\nSubscription Required.
