    "NOTE: All the steps in this protocol have been approved by UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n1. Generation of mTERT-ER Allele\nIntroduce knock-in targeting vector containing the ERT2-LBD (Ligand Binding Domain) upstream and in frame with the mTERT genomic sequence (exon 1 through intron 2) and a Lox-pgk-Neo-Lox fragment (Figure 1A) into mouse ES cells with electroporation.\nCulture the ES cells in neomycin for 6-10 days. Pick neomycin-resistant clones and expand in 48 well plates. Extract the genomic DNA using a commercial kit and confirm the knock-in allele by southern blot.\nInject two ES lines with over 95% normal karyotypes into C57BL/6 blastocysts with a micromanipulation kit under an inverted microscope. Implant the blastocysts into the uterus of surrogate mothers23. Mate the high-grade male chimaeras (70-90%) to C57BL/6 females.\nConfirm the genotyping of heterozygous mTERT-ERneo animals by southern blot.\nMate the heterozygous mTERT-ERneo animals and EIIa-Cre animals to delete the NeoR cassette. Mate the heterozygous animals to C57BL/6 animals for at least three times, and further inter-breed heterozygous mTERT-ER animals to generate homozygosity.\n2. Generation of LSL-mTERT Allele\nIntroduce the knock-in targeting vector containing a LoxP-triple Stopper-Neo-LoxP fragment and the mTERT genomic sequence (between exon 1 and intron 2, Figure 1B) into mouse ES cells with electroporation23.\nCulture the ES cells in neomycin for 6-10 days. Pick neomycin-resistant clones and expand in 48 well plates. Extract the genomic DNA using a commercial kit and confirm the knock-in allele by southern blot23.\nInject two ES lines with over 95% normal karyotypes into C57BL/6 blastocysts with a micromanipulation kit under an inverted microscope. Implant the blastocysts into the uterus of surrogate mothers23. Mate the high-grade male chimaeras (70-90%) to C57BL/6 females.\nConfirm the genotyping of heterozygous LSL-mTERT animals by southern blot.",
    "Mate the heterozygous animals to C57BL/6 animals for at least three times, and further inter-breed heterozygous LSL-mTERT animals to generate homozygosity.\n3. Reactivation of Telomerase in mTERT-ER and LSL-mTERT Mice In Vivo\n For mTERT-ER\nSterilize all the surgical tools before the injection.\nAnesthetize the mice with isoflurane chamber (4% for induction, 2% for maintaining) in 50% (v/v) oxygen/50% (v/v) dinitrogen monoxide gas mixture. Or anesthetize mice by a ketamine-xylazine mixture (100 mg/kg bodyweight + 10 mg/kg bodyweight).\nAfter deep anesthesia is reached, remove the anesthetized animal from the induction chamber, and keep their head inside the tube connected to the isoflurane chamber (2%).\nPinch the foot pads of the mice to ensure the animal is deeply anaesthetized. Put ointment on both eyes in order to prevent the eyes from drying out. Wipe the back of the mice with povidone-iodine solution.\nInject the slow-releasing 4-OHT pellet with precision trochar (10 G) under the skin of the back and push the pellet all the way to the midline between two shoulders.\nSeal the incision with wound clip applier and monitor the mice for recovery from anesthesia. Remove the clips 10 days later. Supplemental heat is not necessary because the procedure is finished shortly.\nPeriod of treatment with 4-OHT pellet should be optimized according to the purpose of the study.\nFor LSL-mTERT\nTamoxifen (10 mg/ml, dissolved in corn oil) is injected intraperitoneally two consecutive days (200 ul/25 g/day).\n\t\n4. Isolation of Neural Stem Cells and Reactivation of Telomerase In Vitro\nMice are euthanized with carbon dioxide and the brains are removed. Follow the protocol of commercially available neural tissue dissociation kit as per manufacturer.",
    "Resuspend the lyophilized powder in the vial labeled Solution 4 with 1 ml of cell culture medium for Solution 4. Do not vortex. This solution should then be aliquoted and stored at –20 °C for later use.\nPre-Heat the mixture at 37 °C for 15 min before use.\nMake Enzyme Mix 1: Solution 1 (50 µl) and Solution 2 (1,900 µl). Make Enzyme Mix 2: Solution 3 (20 µl) and Solution 4 (10 µl).\nPrepare 1,950 µl enzyme mix 1 for up to 400 mg tissue and vortex. Pre-heat the mixture at 37 °C for 15 min before use.\nTake out the 1-day mouse brains, and keep the forebrains by removing the olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum. Keep the forebrain tissues in 1 ml of cold culture medium since removal and store in 4 °C. Make sure to process the neural tissue within 1 hr.\nDetermine the weight of tissue to make sure the 400 mg limit per digestion is not exceeded. Place the brain on the lid of a 35 mm diameter Petri dish, and crush the brain using a scalpel.\nUsing a 1 ml pipette tip, add 1 ml of HBSS (w/o Ca/Mg) and pipette pieces back into a 15 ml tube. Rinse with HBSS (w/o Ca/Mg). Centrifuge at 300 × g for 2 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant carefully.\nAdd 1,950 µl of pre-heated enzyme mix 1 (Solutions 1 and 2) per up to 400 mg tissue. Incubate in the 15 ml tube for 15 min at 37 °C, mixing by inverting or shaking the tube every 5 min.\nPrepare 30 µl enzyme mix 2 per tissue sample by adding 20 μl of Solution 3 to 10 μl of Solution 4. Then add to sample. Invert gently to mix. Do not vortex.",
    "Dissociate tissue mechanically using a wide-tipped, fire-polished Pasteur pipette by pipetting up and down 10 times slowly. Avoid forming air bubbles.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 10 min, inverting the tube every 3 min.\nRepeat the step 4.11 and step 4.12 if the tissues are bigger than 200 mg.\nApply the cell suspension to a 70 μm cell strainer, placed on a 50 ml tube. Apply 10 ml of PBS through cell strainer. Discard cell strainer and centrifuge cell suspension at 300 g for 20 min at room temperature. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nResuspend cells with stem cell medium to the required volume for further applications.\nTo activate telomerase in LSL-mTERT NSCs, treat the cells with 100 µM 4-OHT for two days. To activate telomerase in mTERT-ER NSCs, keep the cells in culture medium with 100 µM 4-OHT.\n5. Telomere FISH\nPrepare the metaphase chromosomes from cultured cells.\nFor FFPE (Formalin Fixed and Paraffin Embedded) tissue sections, deparaffinize in xylene and rehydrate in ethanol series for 5 minutes each (100%, 90%, 70%, 50% ethanol) and PBS for 5 min.\nPost-fix in the methanol: acetic acid (3:1) for 1-2 hr. Dehydrate in cold ethanol series for 5 min each (70%, 90%, 100% ethanol) and air dry. Wash in 1x PBS at 37 °C for 5 min.\nDenature chromosomes in 4% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 2 min. Dehydrate in cold ethanol series 5 min each (70%, 90%, 100% ethanol) and air dry.\nApply 12 to 25 µl of the PNA hybridization mixture to each slide. (Hybridization mix: 70% formamide, 0.06x SSC, 0.2% BSA, 0.5 ng/µl tRNA, 0.5 ng/µl telomere or centromere probes)",
    "Seal the cover slip with rubber cement. Post-denature chromosomal preps and tissue sections at 80 °C for 4 min. Hybridize at room temperature or 37 °C for 2-4 hr in humid chamber.\nWash at room temperature with washing buffer 2 x 15 min. (Wash buffer: 70% formamide, 0.06x SSC, pH 7.2). Wash at room temperature 3 x 5 min with PBST. Counter-stain slides with DAPI or far-red fluorescence for microscopic examination."
