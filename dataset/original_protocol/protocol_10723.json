    "1. Preparation of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) Electropolymerization Solution for H+ and CO32- Ions\nAdd 70 mg poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (Na+PSS-) to 10 ml deionized (DI) water and vortex until completely dispersed (approx. 10 sec).\nAdd 10.7 μl 3,4-ethlyenedioxythiophene (EDOT) to the solution in 1.1 and vortex until solution is completely mixed.\n2. Preparation of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Calcium sulphate (PEDOT:CaSO4) Electropolymerization Solution for Ca2+ Ions\nAdd 136 mg calcium sulphate (CaSO4) to 10 ml DI water and vortex; the solution will not completely disperse and appears milky.\nAdd 10.7 μl EDOT to the solution in 2.1 and vortex until completely mixed.\n3. Electropolymerization of PEDOT-based Conductive Polymer\nA Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASI) C3 cell stand (Figure 3) and an EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat are used to form the electrochemical cell for electropolymerization. Place the EDOT:PSS electropolymerization solution in the electrochemical cell and nitrogen bubble for 20 min to remove dissolved oxygen.\nNow clip a platinum-gauze at the counter electrode position of the electrochemical cell. Then clip the MAB at the working electrode position of the electrochemical cell with the working electrodes facing the platinum-gauze. Adjust the MAB depth so that only the circular electrodes are submerged in the PEDOT:PSS electropolymerization solution. Avoid solution contact with the square electrical contact pads.\nPlace a BASI saturated silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode in the reference electrode position of the electrochemical cell. Make sure that the reference electrode is not in between the working and counter electrodes.\nFor PEDOT:PSS deposition: Bubble the electrochemical cell for 20 min, and use the EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat to run a single cyclic voltammogram from 0V - 1.1V with a scan rate of 20 mV/sec on a ±100 μA scale.\nFor PEDOT:CaSO4 deposition: Bubble the electrochemical cell for 20 min, and use the EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat to run chronopotentiometry at 814 nA for 30 min.",
    "4. Cyclic Voltammetry of PEDOT-based Polymer Conjugates in K3Fe(CN)6\nPerform steps 3.1- 3.3 above.\nUse the EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat to run single cyclic voltammograms from -653 mV to 853 mV with varying scan rates of (25, 50, 75, 100, l25, 150, 175, 200) mV/sec on a ±10 μA scale.\n5. Surface Functionalization Protocol\nDeposit conductive polymer conjugate specific for the ions of interest as in Step 3.\nApply ion-selective membrane as in Step 6.\n6. Application of Ion-selective Membrane\nCenter the MAB on the vacuum spinner chuck.\nDeposit 100 μl membrane onto the center of the MAB and run.\nSpin-coat ion-selective membrane with a spin coater at 1,500 rpm for 30 sec with a 5 sec ramp up and down.\nVacuum the spin-coated MAB for 30 min and bake the chip in an oven at 70 °C for 20 min.\n7. Calibration of PEDOT-PSS Conductive Polymer Conjugate with pH and Carbonate (CO32-) Ion-selective Membrane\nCondition the MAB overnight in 10 μM sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 5 mM potassium chloride (KCl) in algal media.\nInsert the MAB into the microfluidic flow-cell chip holder.\nInject 5 ml test solution with initial pH value or concentration (e.g. pH 4 or 10 μM for CO32-). Remove bubbles from the flow-cell chip holder.\nPlace the flow-cell chip holder onto the flow-cell electrical fixture.\nOpen the EC epsilon software and enter open-circuit potential (OP) mode. Set the time to 300 min, the voltage scale to ± 1V, and the cutoff frequency to 10 kHz, and record the value every 2 sec.\nLet the MAB stabilize (look for a flat line) before continuing with the calibration process.",
    "Once the MAB is stabilized, flush the flow cell with test solution and inject the next concentration to be calibrated (pH 5 or 25 μM CO32-). Make sure that no bubbles are allowed to enter the flow cell. Repeat steps 7.5 and 7.6 for pH 6, 7, 8, and 9 or CO32- concentrations of 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 μM.\nAfter the last concentration has run, remove the MAB and dry with nitrogen air.\nPlace the MAB back into fresh conditioning solution until next use.\n8. Calibration of PEDOT:CaSO4 Conductive Polymer Conjugate in CaCl2\nCondition the MAB overnight in 7 ml of 0.1 M CaCl2 and 10 μM NaNO3.\nFollow steps similar to 7.2 - 7.10. In step 8.3, replace carbonate test solution with an initial concentration of 0.01 mM CaCl2. Repeat for test-solution concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 10 mM.\nSubscription Required.
