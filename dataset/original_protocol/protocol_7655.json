  "procedures": [
    "The conventional ELISA is effective for detecting and quantifying antibodies in plasma or serum after substantial antigenic exposure such as after natural infection. Conventional ELISA finds its application in scenarios where the target molecule is anticipated to exist in comparatively higher concentrations. On the other hand, sensitive ELISA proves advantageous in early detection of immune responses or diseases, especially when the levels of specific antibodies or antigens are exceedingly low. When low antibody levels are observed in clinical trials, the sensitive version of the ELISA assay is employed, incorporating the addition of a biotin–streptavidin detection step that is particularly useful for amplifying and detecting background responses to antigens that the conventional ELISA might not discern. Serum should be obtained from blood collected in serum separating tubes (SST) and plasma from blood collected in acid citric dextrose (ACD) tubes to ensure high quality samples that are free of contaminants.Preparation of serum or plasma samples and reagents Serum or plasma samples should be heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C and centrifuged at 1,000× g for 10 min at 18–25 °C to harvest the supernatant before testing. If the serum or plasma samples cannot be processed immediately, they should be aliquoted and stored at -80 °C to ensure structural integrity and long-term stability of the antibodies.Critical:  The serum/plasma is heat-inactivated to ensure the safety of the operators since this assay is run on the bench and not under a biosafety cabinet. This kills any potential pathogens present in the serum/plasma.Unless stated otherwise, all procedures are performed at room temperature (20–25 °C) for the conventional ELISA and at 37 °C for the sensitive ELISA, as described later.A plate plan should be drawn to record the position of samples, controls, and standards in each ELISA plate. An example is illustrated in Figure 1.",
    "Prepare wash buffer as described in Recipe 1 or by dissolving one sachet of PBS/TWEEN in 1 L of distilled water.Prepare BSA assay buffer for the conventional ELISA or goat serum assay buffer for the sensitive ELISA as described in Recipes 2 and 3, respectively.All prepared and aliquoted reagents, i.e., all standards and detection antibodies, should be kept in a -20 °C freezer. Once an aliquot is picked and thawed, it should be kept in a fridge and used within only one week. It should be clearly labelled with the date of first opened/prepared.It is crucial to utilise reagents that are new and still within their specified expiration date.Coating of medium-binding ELISA plates Caution:  Inconsistent pipetting may undermine accuracy in processes such as sample dilution, bubble formation, or protocol deviations. Ensure proper pipetting techniques during the assay, e.g., controlled up and down pipetting to minimise bubbles. Refer to Problem 2 under the Troubleshooting section.Coat wells A1–H2 (see Figure 1) of the 96-well medium-binding ELISA plate by adding 50 µL per well of a solution containing both anti-Human kappa and anti-Human lambda capture antibodies diluted in DPBS, at a final dilution of 1:500 at a 1:1 ratio of anti-Human kappa and anti-Human lambda capture antibodies as shown in Table 1. The coated wells will contain the purified antibodies for the standard curve.Coat the rest of the wells of the 96-well medium-binding ELISA plate by adding 50 µL of antigen [recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S2 Subunit protein, or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (S1) S-protein] prediluted in DPBS to a working concentration of 3 µg/mL, with a separate plate for each protein. The predilution parameters for the antigen depend on the concentration of the stock solution, which could vary from lot to lot.",
    "The demonstrated dilution in Table 2 uses 500 µg/mL as the stock concentration.Note: Medium-binding plates are more cost effective and suitable for this protocol where non-specific binding might interfere with the assay. They are generally easier to wash and are less likely to retain residual proteins. While they offer strong binding, high-binding plates may be more challenging to wash thoroughly due to their higher binding capacity. Cover the plates with sealing tape and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator or overnight at 4 °C.Note: During the 2 h incubation time, proceed to section C. Caution:  Do not rock the plates during incubation because rocking can interrupt the formation of bonds between the coating antigen/antibody and the surface of the plate.After the incubation, wash the ELISA plates with five rounds of 200 µL per well of washing buffer using the plate washer, flick the plates over a container to rid it of excess buffer, and tap gently on paper towel to dry the plate. Then, proceed to section D.Note: When using the plate washer, set up a protocol by entering the volume of washing buffer required for each well and the number of times each well should be washed on each ELISA plate. Place the plate on the plate holder and run the protocol. If an automated washer is unavailable, 5× of manual washing can be done using a multi-channel pipette set at 200 µL. Table 1.

    "Note: This dilution is forone plate. Multiply volumes by the number of plates in the assay. Preparation of serum/plasma and control samples Sample preparation should be performed on the day of the assay (diluted samples should not be stored).Dilute samples in U-bottom dilution plates using BSA assay buffer for the conventional ELISA or goat serum assay buffer for the sensitive ELISA.For a 1:100 dilution, add 198 µL of assay buffer to the wells of the dilution plate followed by 2 µL of test sample in duplicate wells following the plate plan in Figure 1.For a 1:50 dilution, add 196 µL of assay buffer to the wells of the dilution plate followed by 4 µL of test sample in duplicate wells following the plate plan in Figure 1.Prepare positive and negative control samples at the same dilution used for the test samples; if commercial, prepare according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Positive and negative controls should be prepared using assay buffer in 2 mL cryovials.Note: For each well of the ELISA plate, 50 µL of samples or controls will be required. Therefore, the number of wells for each control and number of plates in the experiment should be considered in preparation of the required volume of positive or negative controls. Blocking of medium-binding ELISA plates Add 200 µL of BSA assay buffer (conventional ELISA) or goat serum assay buffer (sensitive ELISA) to all the wells in each ELISA plate. Seal the plates and incubate for 1 h at room temperature (conventional ELISA) or at 37 °C (sensitive ELISA).(Critical) Proceed to section E when there are 20 minutes left to the end of the blocking incubation period.After incubation, wash the plates five times with 200 µL of wash buffer per well.",
    "Preparation of standards Use purified human IgG, IgA, or IgM to prepare seven serial dilutions of antibody standards in 2 mL cryovials, as shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5. If more than one plate is being run at a particular time, it is more efficient to prepare the standards in cryovials and then pipette them into their respective ELISA plate wells. Using cryovials also ensures proper mixing as one performs the serial dilutions.Note: If the stock concentrations of the purified antibodies differ from those provided in the tables, the initial dilutions will have to be adjusted to achieve a starting concentration of 1,000 ng/mL. The IgG and IgA serial dilutions are 10-fold, while the IgM dilution is 5-fold. These parameters can be adjusted to suit particular experimental conditions.Table 3.

A suggested plate plan for the arrangement of samples, controls, and standards is illustrated in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4905/bioprotoc-13-24-4905-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative plate plan to arrange standards, samples, and controls. “SPL” represents a sample, “control” represents a negative control, and “+ control” represents a positive control.Following incubation, wash the plates five times with 200 µL of wash buffer per well.Notes:  Some of the controls (control 1, 3, and 4) are run in more than duplicates as a way of testing operators as they run the assay. Running controls at different positions can show if there is any cross contamination or inconsistency as an operator pipettes the controls into their respective wells. You can also choose to have different types of controls, where a plate can have two positive controls; one that is an in-house control and another that is a commercially prepared positive control, e.g., WHO seropositive serum. In-house controls calibrate the assay specifically for the laboratory’s equipment, reagents, and techniques, while commercial controls act as a standardised reference point that can be used across different laboratories, making results comparable between different lab settings and experiments. Addition of secondary antibody (detection antibody) (Critical) The secondary antibody should be prepared 30 min before use. After adding the detection antibody, proceed to section H.For the conventional assay:For IgG plates, dilute goat α-human IgG-HRP detection antibody 1: 10,000 in assay buffer.For IgM plates, dilute human anti-IgM-HRP detection antibody 1:1,000 in assay buffer for the Spike protein and 1:5,000 for the N-protein.For IgA plates, dilute anti-human-IgA-HRP detection antibody 1:1,000 in assay buffer.",
