    "Part I: Virucidal and neutralization reactions (Figure 1)Prepare serial dilutions of PLA2 (or anti-HCV E2 neutralizing antibody) in DMEM in 1.5 ml tubes.Note: In our study, the PLA2 concentrations in each tube are 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 ng/ml and the anti-HCV E2 antibody concentrations are 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 μg/ml. Dilute HCV stock in DMEM to a concentration of 2 x 104 focus-forming unit (FFU) per 200 μl in a 15 ml tube.Mix 100 μl of each dilution of PLA2 (or anti-HCV E2 antibody) with 100 μl of the HCV solution in a 1.5 ml tube and gently vortex.Note: After being mixed with the HCV solution, the final concentration of PLA2 (or anti-HCV E2 antibody) in each tube is 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 ng/ml (or anti-HCV E2 antibody: 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 μg/ml), respectively.  Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Determine remaining viral infectivity by fluorescent antibody (FA) method, plaque assay or TCID50 assay. See Part II for detailed procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515202253_0081.jpgFigure 1. Illustration of the flowchart of virucidal and neutralizing activity tests. A fixed amount of virus is incubated with serial dilutions of an antiviral compound (e.g., PLA2) (A. virucidal activity test) or an antibody (B. neutralizing activity test) at 37 °C for 1 h before inoculation to cultured cells. Antiviral activities of the test samples are assessed by appropriate procedures, such as plaque assay, focus assay and TCID50 assay.Part II: Determination of viral infectivity  Virus titers are expressed as plaque-forming unit (PFU)/ml, focus-forming unit (FFU)/ml, cell-infectious unit (CIU)/ml and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ml.Plaque assay (for SINV, VSNJV and EMCV) Plaque assay is one of the standard methods to determine infectious titers of viruses that cause strong cytopathic effect (CPE).",
    "A confluent monolayer of cells are infected with virus at various dilutions and cultured in a solid or semisolid overlay medium containing agarose or methylcellulose. This minimizes subsequent viral spread only to neighboring cells in the monolayer. Virus-infected cells undergo cell death by CPE and an area where a group of dead cells have detached is called a plaque (Figure 2). The infectivity titer is expressed as PFU/ml.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515202614_7399.jpgFigure 2. Representative image of a plaque assay plate of VSNJV. Plaques are visualized by staining with Gram Hacker’s Stain Solution I. Cell monolayers infected with serial 10-fold dilutions (10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6) of VSNJV and mock-infected are shown.Seed Huh7it-1 cells (5 x 105 cells) in a final volume of 3 ml of complete medium in each well of a 6-well plate.Incubate for 20-24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. (Cells should be 90-100% confluent.)To prepare virus solution, dilute 100 μl of virus-PLA2 (or neutralizing antibody) mixture from Part I in 900 μl culture medium (10-1 dilution) and make subsequent 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus (10-2 to 10-6 dilution). Remove culture medium from each well.Inoculate virus solution (10-2 to 10-6 dilution) to the cells (300 μl/well).Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Remove the inoculum and rinse with medium (3 ml/well).Gently add overlay medium containing 1% methylcellulose (3 ml/well).Note: Overlay medium contains 2% FBS.Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 to 4 days – VSNJV and EMCV(2 days), SINV (3 to 4 days).Aspirate the overlay medium. Note: As overlay medium is viscous, aspirate it slowly. Fix the cells with 10% formaldehyde solution in PBS(-) (1 ml/well) for 20 min at room temperature.Add Gram Hacker’s Stain Solution I (1 ml/well).Incubate for 30 min.",
    "Discard the staining solution, rinse with PBS (3 ml/well) and dry the plate.Count the number of plaques (Figure 2).Focus forming assay by FA method (for HCV, DENV, JEV, FLUAV, SeV, HSV-1, CV-B3) Focus forming assay is particularly useful to measure infectivity of viruses that do not cause strong CPE. Virus-infected cells are incubated for a duration of a single round of the viral life cycle (one-step growth). Virus-infected cells are detected by an FA method using antibodies specific to the respective viral antigens (Figure 3). The infectivity titer is expressed as FFU/ml or CIU/ml.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515203028_9946.jpgFigure 3.

Scale bar = 10 μm.Seed Huh7it-1 cells (1 x 105 cells per 1ml) in each well of a 24-well plate containing a sterile glass slip. Incubate for 20-24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.To prepare virus solution, dilute 100 μl of virus-PLA2 (or neutralizing antibody) mixture from Part I in 900 μl culture medium (10-1 dilution) and make subsequent 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus (10-2 to 10-6 dilution). Remove culture medium from each well.Inoculate virus solution to the cells (200 μl/well). Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

TCID50 represents a dilution of virus that makes 50% of the test wells show cell detachment (Figure 4). The infectivity titer is expressed as TCID50/ml.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515203540_7750.jpgFigure 4. Schematic presentation of a result of TCID50 assay.

Blue circles indicate the wells in which the cells remain intact to be stained with crystal violet.Seed Vero cells (2 x 104 cells in 100 μl) in complete medium in each well of a 96-well plate.Incubate for 20-24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "To prepare virus solution, dilute 100 μl of virus-PLA2 (or neutralizing antibody) mixture from Part I in 100 μl culture medium (2-1 dilution) and make subsequent 2-fold serial dilutions of the virus (2-2 to 2-10 dilution). Remove culture medium from each well. Inoculate the virus solution to the cells (100 μl/well) Note: Aliquots of the same sample should be inoculated to 4 to 8 wells.Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Remove the inoculum and add overlay medium. Note: Overlay medium contains 2% FBS.Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Note: DENV (5 to 8 days), JEV (5 to 6 days), HSV-1 and SINV (4 days), VSNJV and EMCV (2 days). Count the number of wells with or without CPE under an inverted microscope.Remove culture medium and rinse with PBS (100 μl/well).Fix the cells with 10% formaldehyde solution in PBS(-) (100 μl/well) for 20 min at room temperature.Rinse the cells with PBS (100 μl/well).Add crystal violet solution to each well (100 μl /well).Incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the crystal violet solution, rinse with PBS (100 μl/well), and dry the plate.Count the number of wells with or without CPE by the naked eye (Figure 4).Negative staining electron microscopic analysis (HCV, DENV, JEV, FLUAV, SeV, HSV-1, CV-B3, SINV, VSNJV and EMCV)Negative-staining electron microscopy of viruses requires adequate concentrations of virus particle (> 108/ml).Add 5 to 10 μl of a purified virus solution onto a Formvar-coated nickel grid. Wait for 5 min at room temperature so that the viral particles are adsorbed to the grid. Remove the solution using the tip of a strip of filter paper.Add 5 to 10 μl of 2% phosphotungstic acid in distilled water onto the grid and incubate for 2 min.",
