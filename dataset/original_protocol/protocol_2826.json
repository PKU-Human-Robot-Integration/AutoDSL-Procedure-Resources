The working concentration and dilution factor can be calculated by the following formulas provided by manufacturer:\nW\no\nr\nk\ni\nn\ng\nC\no\nn\nc\n.\n=\nC\no\na\nt\ni\nn\ng\nC\no\nn\nc\n.\n×\nC\nl\nu\nt\nu\nr\ne\nS\nu\nr\nf\na\nc\ne\nA\nr\ne\na\nV\no\nl\nu\nm\ne\nR\ne\nq\nu\ni\nr\ne\nd\nf\no\nr\nS\nu\nr\nf\na\nc\ne\nA\nr\ne\na\nD\ni\nl\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\nF\na\nc\nt\no\nr\n=\nS\nt\no\nc\nk\nC\no\nn\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n(\nI\nn\nt\nh\ni\ns\nc\na\ns\ne\n,\n0.5\nm\ng\n/\nm\nL\n)\nW\no\nr\nk\ni\nn\ng\nC\no\nn\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn",
    "Calculation example: To coat one well of a 6-well plate at a coating concentration of 0.5 μg/cm2, the optimal working concentration of VTN is 0.5 μg/mL (10 cm2 /well culture surface area and 1 mL of diluted VTN/well), and the dilution factor will be 100×(i.e., a 1:100 dilution).\nNote: VTN should be diluted 100-fold in DMEM/F12 (“working solution”) for subsequent plate coating (If original concentration of VTN is 0.5 mg/mL). Coating one well of a 6-well plate requires 1 mL of total Vitronectin working solution volume.\nNote: VTN aliquots can be stored at −20°C for up to 2 months and in −80°C refrigerator for long-term storage.\nTo coat a 6-well plate, make 6 mL of VTN working solution: add 60 μL of VTN to 6 mL DMEM/F12 in a 15 mL conical tube. Pipette up and down to ensure that contents are blended completely.\nAdd 1 mL of VTN working solution to each well of plate. Gently shake the plate to ensure VTN mixture is evenly distributed along the bottom of the well.\nSeal the coated plate with parafilm to avoid reagent evaporation and bacterial contamination.\nIncubate the 6-well plate at 4°C for a minimum of 12 h and a maximum of 1 week. The coated 6-well plate is now ready for use.\nNote: The coated plate can be stored up to 2 weeks at 4°C. Incubation at 4°C for longer periods may result in reagent evaporation and thus uneven covering of the plate surface, or bacteria contamination. Proper humidity is critical to ensure slower evaporation.\nNote: If needing it urgently, place coated plate for 4–5 h at 20°C–25°C, or for 1–2 h in a 37°C incubator.\nNote: The incubation time differs according to the temperature. As the temperature increased, the process of Vitronectin coating is sped up.",
    "Maintaining culture of hPSCs\nTiming: 1 week (for steps 6 to 9)\nThis step describes the daily maintaining culture of hPSCs and how to perform hPSCs passage.\nhPSCs are grown in hPSC medium on VTN-coated 6-well plate and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nPassaging hPSCs. Passaging is performed when cells approach 80% confluency (Generally once a week).\nWarm the hPSC medium, EDTA, and DMEM/F12 in a 37°C water bath (for about 20 mins).\nCompletely remove all media from the plate and wash the cells with 1 × DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL of EDTA to each well, enough to cover the well surface entirely. Incubate the cells at 37°C for 1.5–2 mins.\nVisualize the treated cells under a bright-field microscope.\nOnce cell colonies become bright and dissociated, EDTA should be immediately removed by gentlely aspiration.\nAppropriately extend incubation time is needed if dissociation is not complete.\nSlowly add 1 mL DMEM/F12 to each well and gently swirl the plates. Remove DMEM/F12 by gentle aspiration to avoid disruption of attached cell colonies.\nAdd 1 mL of hPSC medium per well, pipette up and down gently, in order to keep colony clumps approximately 50–100 μm in diameter.\nTake the prepared Vitronectin-coated 6-well plate, remove the vitronectin working solution, and add the 1 mL pre-warmed hPSC medium to each well.\nMix the cell suspension with a fresh hPSC medium in the ratio of 1:20-1:30 (with approximately 70–80% cellular confluency at the source well), e.g., if total cell suspension is 1 mL, then transfer 50 μL of this suspension (for a 1:20 ratio) to the 1 mL hPSC medium-containing well plate.\nGently shaking the plate to ensure an even distribution of cell clusters, then place the plate to 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.",
    "The next day, remove all media from wells to eliminate dead cells, then add 2 mL hPSC medium.\nFor all subsequent days, hPSC half-medium exchanges should be performed daily until cells approach 70–80% of confluency. (Half-medium exchange: Gently aspirate approximately 1 mL of the medium without disturbing the colonies, then add an additional 1 mL of fresh hPSC medium to make approximately 2 mL of final volume).\nNote: Don 't dissociate the cell colonies and try to keep them intact during EDTA incubation.\nNote: Freshly thawed hPSCs should be passaged at least twice prior to starting neural differentiation. Once weekly hPSC passaging is beneficial for cell lines to generate cerebral organoids.\nNote: The minimum passage number of the hPSCs that can be used for organic differentiation is 10 in general. The hPSCs passed over 40 times are not suitable for organic differentiation.\nNote: When thawing iPSCs, adding ROCK inhibitor to a final concentration of 2 μM in E8 medium is needed.\nGenerating embryoid bodies and initiating neural induction\nTiming: 7 days\nThis step describes the generation of embryoid bodies and initiation neural induction. When hPSCs approach 60–80% confluency, which usually occurs 7 days after passaging the cells, cell colonies are ready to generate EBs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2531-Fig1.jpg\nFigure1. Timeline of generating organoids from human pluripotent stem cells\nOn day 0, EBs are formed by hPSCs and incubated in neural induction media supplemented with SB431542 and DMH1 to allow for neuroectoderm differentiation. Media should be refreshed daily. On day 7, EBs are embedded in Matrigel droplets to form cerebral organoids exhibiting optically clear neuroepithelium buds. Media is refreshed every 5 days. Developing COs can be incubated in the organoid media for short- or long-term culturing maintenance. Scale bar, 250 μm.",
    "Warm Dispase (0.6 mg/mL), DMEM/F12, hPSC medium, and Neural Induction Medium in a 37°C water bath (for about 20 mins).\nCompletely remove all medium from the plate by aspiration and wash the cells with 1× DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL Dispase to each well, and incubate at 37°C for 3–4 mins.\nNote: At the end of incubation, the edge of the colony should curl up while the major of the colony remains attached to the plate.\nRemove the Dispase from each well, and wash them with 1 mL DMEM/F12 with gentle shaking.\nRemove the DMEM/F12, and add another 2 mL DMEM/F12 medium to each well.\nScrape down the colonies in the vertical and horizontal direction with 1 mL pipette tip.\nNote: Be careful not to pipette up and down repeatedly, and try to keep the colonies intact.\nGently mix the cell suspension with DMEM/F12 medium, and transfer liquids in the well to a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 800 × g.\nRemove the supernatant from the tube by gentle aspiration,\nadd the hPSC medium and the Neural Induction Medium equally to mix the colonies up.\ntransfer the cell suspension to a flask.\nincubate it at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: This is day 0 of the embryoid bodies differentiation. The medium volume depends on the flask size (4 mL /T12.5,8 mL /T25,16 mL/T75).\nOn day 1, observe EBs under microscope. EBs should have a smooth surface.\nReplace half medium with fresh Neural Induction Medium.\nMeasure the volume of liquid by drawing the liquid up into the pipette tip and reading the scale on the pipette.\nGentle return the liquid back to the flask, then add SB431542 and DMH1 with a 1:5000 ratio (final concentration 2 μM).\nReturn the plate to the incubator for further culturing.",
    "On day 2 to day 6, replace half of the Neural Induction Medium daily containing 2 μM SB431542 and DMH1.\nOn day 7, neural induction is needed for further organoid culture.\nGenerating cerebral organoids\nTiming: 30 min\nStarting from day 7, embryoid bodies with a diameter range from 400 μm to 600 μm will be embedded in Matrigel to generate cerebral organoids exhibiting optically clear neuroepithelium buds. This step provides a detailed procedure for generating cerebral organoids.\nAliquot Matrigel should be liquefied at 2°C–8°C refrigerator one day before use.\nNote: Matrigel should be sub-packed in a disposable microcentrifuge tube and store at −20°C (∼500 μL/Vial). Avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Thaw enough Matrigel to have 20 μL/EB. All plasticware that comes in contact with Matrigel should be chilled at −20°C or on ice for at least half an hour before use. Keep Matrigel on ice to prevent premature solidification.\nTrim the Parafilm to a smaller square with sterile scissors, then place the square of parafilm into a 60-mm culture dish.\nNote: Parafilm cannot be sterilized by using an autoclave. Therefore, make sure to place both sides of the Parafilm under UV light in biological safety cabinet for 30 mins before use. Alternatively, 70% ethanol treatment can be employed. When treated with ethanol, Parafilm can be used once ethanol evaporates.\nUse a wide-bore 200-μL pipette tip to transfer EBs to parafilm (Only one for each position).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2531-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative images of manipulations for generating cerebral organoids\n(A) Cutting the end of 1mL pipette tip with an opening of ∼4mm; cutting the end of 200-μL pipette tip with an opening of ∼1.5mm. Scale bar, 5mm.\n(B) Images of the EBs embedded in Matrigel droplets on Parafilm. White specks within the Matrigel droplet are embedded tissues (arrow). Scale bar, 10 mm.",
    "Note: Wide-bore 200-μL pipette tips are prepared by cutting pipette tip with sterile scissors (approximately 1.5–2 mm in diameter). Flame the cut part to make a smooth caliber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nGently remove the excess medium from EB one by one by aspirating with a standard 200-μL pipette tip, being careful not to disrupt EBs.\nNote: Remove no more than 15 medium drops at a time to prevent the EBs from drying out.\nImmediately add 20 μL Matrigel droplets to each EB with a chilled 200-μL wide-bore pipette tip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nGently stir the droplet with a 10-μL pipette tip to reposition the EB to the center of the Matrigel droplet.\nNote: Manipulations must be done quickly, or Matrigel will begin solidifying once under 20°C–25°C.\nPlace the dish containing droplets in the 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for 30mins to allow Matrigel droplets to polymerize.\nTransfer the Matrigel droplets to a 6-well plate.\nGrasp the edge of Parafilm from the dish with sterile forceps.\nHold Parafilm above one well of the 6-well plate.\nWash the droplets off the Parafilm with a 1-mL pipette tip filled with cerebral organoids differentiation medium.\nDispense 7–8 tissue droplets with 6–7 mL cerebral organoids differentiation medium per well of a 6-well plate.\nNote: Repeat the above steps 30–31 until all droplets are collected to 6-well plate.\nPlace the plate in a static 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.\nGently pipet medium up and down 2–3 times without touching Matrigel-embedded organoids every other day to prevent attachment of droplets.\nNeural maturation and long-term culture\nTiming: 1–12 months\nAfter embedding with Matrigel in the 6-well plate, the organoids will keep maturing. We describe the features of organoids in different stages and the step of long-term culture.",
    "After 3 days, observe the embedded tissue under the microscope, neuroepithelial buds with small central lumens should begin to appear.\nRefresh half of the medium by using a 5-mL serological pipette at the slowest setting.\nNote: Avoid disturbing the Matrigel-embedded organoids.\nPerform a half-medium exchange every 4 days as described in step 35 (If the total volume of medium is 6 mL, use a 5-mL serological pipette to remove 3 mL and replace it with 3 mL fresh medium). Monitor organoids for morphology at each media change under a light microscope.\nOn days 13–15, organoids are usually over 400 μm in diameter, and smaller rosette structures may be visible (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Obvious cortical lobes will generally continue to become larger and the cortical plate should form between days 30–50 (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D).\nFor long-term culture, you may transfer COs to individual T25 Flasks by using a wide-bore 1-mL pipette tip with an opening of ∼4mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: Culture 13–15 COs per Flask with 10 mL medium (at least 6 months in vitro). Cerebral organoids will continue to expand to 3–4 mm in diameter after 70 days of differentiation.\nHistological analysis for organoids\nTiming: about 3 days\nThis step describes the histological analysis for organoids. Before analysis, the organoids need to be fixed and dehydration to keep them integrity. To make the structure of organoids visible, they need to be sliced and immunostained for histological analysis.\nFix organoids with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nOn day 1, transfer organoids into 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes with a wide-bore 1-mL pipette tip, then centrifuge to remove the organoids medium.\nWash organoids with 1 mL 1 × DPBS, then add 1 mL 4% PFA for fixation, and place at 4°C for 15–20 h or 20°C–25°C for 4 h.",
    "Note: PFA is toxic; manipulations should be carried out in a fume hood. Avoid direct contact or inhalation.\nDehydrate the organoids with 30% sucrose solution.\nCentrifuge the organoids to the bottom of the 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube at 300 × g for 3–5 s by using a table-top Centrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant PFA, wash 3 times with 1 mL 1 × DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL 30% sucrose solution, and then place in a 4°C refrigerator for 8–12 h for dehydration.\nObserve the suspension state of the organoids the next day. If they settle at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube, the dehydration process is complete.\nEmbed the dehydrated organoids in the sample holder for the following slicing.\nAspirate the completely dehydrated organoids with a wide-bore 200 μL pipette tip, place them in the center of the pre-cooled sample holder.\nQuickly embed them with approximately 500 μL OCT Compound™, then place them on the quick-freezing platform.\nAfter 3–5 mins, transfer them to the adaptation box. Keep the box at −20°C.\nSlice the organoids.\nInsert the sample holder embedded with organoids into the sample platform after 1 min. The slice thickness should be set to 10 μm.\nAttach the slices to poly-lysine-treated glass slides.\nPlace them into pathological slide boxes, and stored in a −80°C freezer for long-term storage.\nImmunostain the organoids slices.\nCritical: All immunostaining steps should be performed in a humidified chamber to avoid drying out the tissues.\nUse a waterproof pen to circle the area where the organoids are located.\nRinse the slices with 1 × DPBS 3 times, 10 mins each time, to remove residual OCT Compound™ on the slices.\nBlocking and permeabilization are performed by incubating for 1 h at 20°C–25°C in Blocking Buffer (1% Triton +5% donkey serum in 1 × DPBS).",
    "Remove the Blocking Buffer from poly-lysine-treated glass slides containing the organoids with a 200-μL pipette tip.\nNote: Avoid touching the organoids.\nIncubate with respective primary antibodies diluted in primary antibody vehicle solution (0.2% Triton+5% donkey serum in 1 × DPBS).\nPlace the slides at 20°C–25°C for 30 m and then transfer them to 4°C for 8–12 h.\nThe next day, wash the slides three times with 1 × DPBS, 10 mins each time, to remove the primary antibody/vehicle solution mix.\nIncubate the slides in appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in vehicle solution (5% donkey serum in 1 × DPBS) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nRinse the slides 3 times with 1 × DPBS, 10 mins each time, to remove secondary antibodies.\nMount the slides with the anti-fluorescence quenching mounting medium.\nObserve and take images with an appropriate microscope and camera (e.g., Eclipse 80i fluorescence inverted microscope (Nikon)).\nAnalysis of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in cerebral organoids with ImageJ software\nTiming: 1 h\nBrain development begins with the folding of embryonic neural tissue into a single tube, namely neural tube. Following the initial expansion of the progenitor cell pool, these cells differentiate into upper- and deeper- layer cortical neurons in vivo. Generation of cerebral organoids containing multiple neural tube-like domains may lead to an unpredictable number of germinal zones and tissue organization within an organoid. Therefore, phenotypic analysis focusing on single neural tube-like regions rather than entire organoid may accurately reflect the proliferative ability of neural stem cells.",
    "This step provides a detailed procedure for analysis of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in hPSC-derived cerebral organoids based on the open-source software ImageJ. Typically, cerebral organoids will exhibit obviously ventricular zone (VZ)-like structures by days 10–15. These expanding neuroepithelium are located adjacent to ventricle-like cavity and marked by PAX6 or SOX2 expression at early differentiation stage. Generally, organoids should begin to exhibit neuronal differentiation after 1 month, displaying a cortical plate marked by TBR1 and CTIP2. Loop tissue adjacent to fluid-filled ventricle and organized portions around the VZ-like structure are the target area for quantification of proliferation and neurogenesis, respectively.\nWe visualized organoids with an Eclipse 80i fluorescence inverted microscope (Nikon). We captured photographic images with a Nikon DS-Qi1Mc digital camera that was controlled by the NIS-Elements F software. We used open-source ImageJ software for processing images.\nQuantification of proliferative ability in hPSC-derived cerebral organoids with ImageJ software\nOpen ImageJ software, then load the pre-processed images stained with Ki67 and Hoechst by Drag&Drop.\nClick the tab “Image>Color>Merge Channels” to open a dialog to assign the Hoechst-stained image to the Blue channel and the Ki67-stained image to the Red channel, respectively.\nClick “OK” to create a new composite image with RGB format (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2531-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Assessment of proliferative and neurogenesis ability\n(A–F) Sequence of photographs from (A) to (F) showing step-by-step the quantification of proliferation and neurogenesis.\nSelect the composite image, and click the tab “Image>Adjust>Color balance” to adjust the brightness and contrast of the selected channel only, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nNote: The “Auto” button will calculate and apply a histogram stretch automatically, but does not always make an appropriate adjustment. Therefore, generally we moved the Minimum, Maximum, or Brightness sliders to get an optimizing adjustment.",
    "Click on the “Rectangle” button, then click on the right mouse button to select the “Rotated Rectangle” option (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nMove the mouse to circle the desired tissue area to be quantitated. In this case, we rotated the rectangle so that the apical membrane of the VZ-like region is parallel to one side of the rectangle and the defined box can cover the entire VZ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nClick on the right mouse button, and select “Duplicate” to create a new image that only includes the area to be quantitated (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nSplit two-channel merged images using the menu command “Image › Color › Split Channels”. Then a new RGB stack is created, the red channel being the Ki67-stained image, and the blue channel Hoechst-stained, respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nFinally, count the Ki67-positive cell numbers and Hoechst-stained cell numbers with the “Multi-point tool” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Then, the Ki67-positive percentage reflecting the proliferative ability of cerebral organoids can be calculated.\nQuantification of neurogenesis ability in hPSC-derived cerebral organoids\nOpen ImageJ software and follow steps 44–52 of “quantification of proliferative ability in hPSC-derived cerebral organoids with ImageJ software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.7.1].”\nNote: It is worth noting that you should define a longer frame to cover the entire stratified region from the apical surface of the VZ to the top surface including the cortical plate of the organoid when you reach step 49.\nAssessment of the architecture of neuroepithelial loops in hPSC-derived cerebral organoids with ImageJ software\nCalibrate the ImageJ software with the measurements in micrometers for the images (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nOpen ImageJ software, and load the image with a known scale as step 44.\nNote: It is necessary to load an image with an existing scale bar with the same magnification with which the organoid photographs will be taken.",
    "Using the “straight” line selection tool, draw a line along the scale bar from one end to the other end.\nGo to “Analyze>set scale”, ImageJ will input the pixel distance of the line you just drew.\nThen fill in the “Known distance” (in this case 100 μm) without units.\nDefine the units of length in the “Unit of Length” (in this case μm) field.\nClick on “Global” so that this calibration applies to all images that you open in this ImageJ session.\nClick “OK”.\nLoad the Hoechst-stained nuclei images as in step 44.\nQuantify the parameters including the length of apical and basal membranes, the area of ventricle-like region, total loop region and loop tissue region of neuroepithelium loop with the “Freehand selections” tool.\nQuantification of the length of apical and basal membranes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2531-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Assessment of the architecture of neuroepithelial loops\n(A and B) Windows with scale setting.\n(C and D) Original images of a Hoechst-stained neural tube together with the tools used and the outcomes of the measurements of the length of apical and basal membranes, the area of ventricle-like region, and total loop region.\nMark along with the apical and basal surface of VZ with the “Freehand selections” tool, respectively.\nClick the tab “Analyze>Measure” that pops up a new window with the measurement in μm determining the length of the apical/basal membranes (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nQuantification of the area of ventricle-like region, total loop region.\nMark along with the apical and basal surface of VZ with the “Freehand selections” tool, respectively.",
