    "1. Fabrication and Assembly\nPlace the aluminum heat sink inside the 22.96 cm (9\") pie pan approximately 2 cm from the side of the pan, as shown in Figure 1c.  Using a black marker pen, mark \n\tholes for the aluminum heat sink. Note: If the aluminum block (purchased at a local scrap metal shop or online at http://www.onlinemetals.com[href=http://www.onlinemetals.com]) does not come with \n\tpre-drilled holes, you will need to arrange to have holes drilled and countersunk prior to step 1 to secure the aluminum block to the pie pan.  We used 5 holes to secure\n\tthe block to the platform and 4 extra holes to allow nitrogen gas bubbles to escape from under the aluminum. \nPlace the cryo-grid box near the location of the aluminum heat sink and mark the notch and each side.\nDrill pilot holes for each marked position using a #17 drill bit for the aluminum heat sink holes and a #35 drill bit for the cryo-grid box holes.\nMount the aluminum heat sink using 5 - #10, 1.9 cm (3/4\") flat head slotted bolts and corresponding nuts as well as 15 - #10 washers. Place two washers beneath the\n\taluminum block and the third on the backside of the pie pan for each hole. Note: Unsecured overhangs of the aluminum block near the viewing area can \n\tresult in vibrations that limit imaging capabilities of the stage. Check to make sure all mounting bolts are firmly tightened.\nInsert 3 - #4, 0.95 cm (3/8\") round slotted bolts and corresponding nuts from the backside of pie pan to act as the cryo-grid box mount.\nTape 4 chopsticks together in pairs with one chopstick atop another. Tape each pair to opposite edges of the cake pan to act as spacers.",
    "Wet the top and bottom surface of the cake and pie pans respectively with ddH2O.\nFill the cake pan with two layers of insulating spray foam. Wetting each layer before going to the next step.\nPress the pie pan into the foam.\nFlip the pans upside down and press on the cake pan until the spacers contact the pie pan. Place any weighted object atop the cake pan and let sit overnight to cure.\nWith a serrated knife, cut away the excess dried insulating spray foam from the edge of the pans and remove the chopsticks.\nRemove the cake pan from the pie pan. The pie pan with aluminum heat sink is now insulated and will be referred to as the \"cryogenic stage\" (Fig 1a).\nPlace a transparent plastic clipboard (any color and greater than 3 mm thick) over the top of the cryogenic stage.  Mark with a black marker the location of the \n\tcryo-grid box mount by drawing a circle approximately 1.5 times the diameter of a single round cryo-grid box. Cut out hole with a 1.9 cm (3/4\") hole saw. This \n\tclipboard will be referred to as the \"loading screen\" (Fig 1b).\nPut a new transparent clipboard atop of the cryogenic stage and place on the microscope with the heat sink directly under the objective lenses. With a black\n\tmarker, mark the path of the objectives as they rotate.\nCut along the marked line removing a half circle from the edge of the clipboard. This can be accomplished with a jigsaw or using a 7.62 cm (3\") hole saw multiple times as shown in the video.\nFinally cut a 1.9 cm (3/4\") hole away from the half circle but still within the area of the dish.  This will be the port for refilling liquid nitrogen (lN2)",
    "if levels drop while imaging. This clipboard will be referred to as the \"viewing screen\" (Fig 1c).\n2. Sample Preparation\nDilute log phase yeast cells grown in synthetic complete (SC) media to an appropriate concentration of 1x106 cells/mL in water.\n2  mL of the diluted yeast are pipetted onto a R2/1 400 mesh holey carbon coated copper cryo-EM grid (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA) and allowed to adsorb for \n\t15 seconds.\nBlot away excess liquid from the grid surface by touching the back of the grid to a torn piece of soft cellulose tissue (Kimwipe) for 2 seconds.\nIf necessary, the grid can be washed with 3 μL drops of water (1-3 times), and wicked away as in step 3 by blotting from the back.\nBefore the final wash, the sample is loaded into the pneumatic plunge freezer and the hanging grid is washed as in step 2.4. After blotting the grid\n\twith torn tissue paper (Kimwipe) to remove the majority of the water from the surface, the grid is plunged into lN2 cooled liquid ethane and transferred to a \n\tcryo-grid box for storage 1. Note: it is important to leave a layer of liquid as thin as possible on the surface to keep the sample hydrated.  Improper blotting \n\twill either dry out the sample or leave ice that is opaque to the electron beam.\n3. Cryo-Light Microscopy\nFill the cryogenic stage with lN2 and quickly cover with the loading screen (plastic clipboard with single 1.9 cm (3/4\") hole).\nOnce the metal reaches lN2 temperature, transfer the cryo-grid box through the 1.9 cm (3/4\") hole of the loading screen and into the transfer mount created by the",
    "3 screws described in part A5. Unscrew the cryo-grid box from its holder and remove the holder for improved access. Keep the cryo-grid box holder under lN2 in a separate dewar \n\tuntil step 3.10. The cryo-grid box should also be kept under lN2 to prevent sample grid warming.\nRefill lN2 in the cryogenic stage to just below the top of the aluminum heat sink. Note:  lN2 levels must be periodically \n\tchecked and refilled during the imaging process to ensure lN2 is continuously in contact with the heat sink. In general, the refilling occurs every 10 \n\tminutes through the fill port in the viewing screen.\nPre-cool the tweezer tip in lN2, then transfer your grid(s) onto the flat viewing surface of the aluminum heat sink with tweezers, using the 1.9 cm (\n\t3/4\") hole of the loading screen.\nCarefully move the cryo-stage to beneath the reflected light microscope’s objective apertures.\nPlace the transparent viewing screen atop the loading screen. Then slowly remove the loading screen by sliding it underneath the viewing screen.  \n\tNote: At this point, the sample is most vulnerable.  All air currents around the microscope should be minimized, including: breathing, a nearby \n\tdoor opening, people walking past, etc. We suggest wearing a facemask or hanging a transparent face shield below the microscope eyepieces as a precautionary measure.\nRotate the objective lenses into the cold nitrogen gas environment of the cryo-stage and scan for the sample on the flat heat sink viewing area.  Using standard \n\tbright field light microscopy techniques focus on the grid with a low magnification objective to find the center and take an overview image. Specifications regarding \n\tthe light microscopy lenses used for this experiment are listed in the Experimental Materials section.  Note: lN2 does not come in contact with the objective lenses",
    "and we have yet to see degradation of images or damage to the lenses from the effects of cooling.\nFocus in high magnification on an area of interest and acquire data with bright field, dark field, polarized light or fluorescence imaging. Be sure to record the \n\tlocation of the area of interest on the low magnification bright field image for future correlation. If all precautions listed above for refilling the lN2 are followed, \n\tthen the positive pressure from the evaporating nitrogen is sufficient to maintain a contamination free environment (independent of room humidity) for the duration of \n\timaging.\nOnce finished, replace the loading screen by sliding it over the top of the viewing screen. Remove the viewing screen by slowing sliding it beneath the loading screen.\nRemove the cryo stage from the microscope and with pre-cooled tweezers, transfer the grid back to the cryo-grid box. Screw the cryo-grid box holder into \n\tcryo-grid box to seal against the environment and transfer the holder to a lN2 dewar for storage and future imaging.\n4. Cryo-Electron Microscopy\nFollowing standard and established techniques, load the sample grid into a cryo-EM transfer holder while keeping the specimen at liquid nitrogen \n\ttemperature at all\ttimes.\nInsert the cryo-holder with sample grid into a Transmission Electron Microscope.\nIn a suitable low magnification view (50-500x nominal magnification), find the center of the sample grid.\nUse the previously collected low magnification cryo-LM data from step 3.7 to determine the relative orientation of the grid’s central copper tabs (as described in\n\tFigure 2) and identify exact areas of interest for correlation.\nProceed with microscope alignment, low-dose cryo-EM imaging and data collection.\n5. Representative Results\nThe cryogenic stage (Fig 1a) is an effective way to gather cryo-LM data for cryo-fluorescence microscopy and correlative cryo-LM/cryo-EM",
    "analysis. Figure 2 shows how the combination of low and high magnification cryo-LM images allows you to build reference maps that direct you to specific areas in \ncryo-EM. The resulting cryo-LM reference map (Fig 2b) was utilized during cryo-EM data acquisition to locate exact regions shown in Figure 3. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2909/2909fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cryogenic Stage.  a) The layout of the cryogenic stage consists of a cryo-grid box transfer mount indicated with a\n white arrow and an aluminum heat sink.  Grids are transferred under lN2 from the cryo-grid box and placed directly on the heat sink’s viewing area as \n indicated by the black arrow.  b) Image depicting the cryogenic stage with loading screen.  The hole in the loading screen is placed directly \n over the cryo-grid box mount and acts as a port to transfer samples and for moving samples from the cryo-grid box to the sample viewing area on the heat sink with \n tweezers.  c) The cryogenic stage in position under the objective lenses with the viewing screen in place.  The special cutout on the viewing\n screen allows the objective lenses to easily swing into position without moving the cryogenic stage.  The hole in the viewing screen away from the sample area acts \n as a lN2 fill port to replenish lN2 levels if necessary.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2909/2909fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The center consists of a group of four squares, three having an extra metal tab and the forth open. For the three squares with an extra",
    "metal tab, two pairs share the tab about the long and short axes forming an asymmetric center. This asymmetric center can be seen in the upper left corner and was used \nto indicate the rotation angle and handedness of the grid between cryo-LM and cryo-EM. From one low magnification image many areas of interest can be marked and used as\n a reference map to locate identical areas in cryo-EM. c) A magnified fluorescence cryo-LM image of the area of interest in (b).
