    "NOTE: All cell culture materials need to be sterile and the entire experiment must be performed in a biosafety cabinet under sterile conditions.\n1. Culture and Electroporation of the U-118MG Glioblastoma Cell Line\nCulture the U-118MG cell line in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (culture medium) and Maintain at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2 incubator (culture conditions).\nUse 70– 80% confluent healthy cells for electroporation.\nFor harvesting cells, wash the cells growing in culture dishes with 1x PBS and add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Place in the incubator for 30 s and remove the trypsin-EDTA. Collect cells in the culture medium into a 15 mL tube.\nCount the cells using a handheld automated cell counter, centrifuge cells at 100 x g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the cell pellet in the culture medium and take 600,000 cells for each condition into a microcentrifuge tube. Adjust the cell number depending on experimental designs and growth rates. \nTransfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube and add 800 µL of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). Spin down using a minicentrifuge for 30 s and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 60 µL of resuspension buffer R to the cell pellet and add the siRNAs (i.e., non-targeting siRNA, Crk siRNA, CrkL siRNA, or both Crk and CrkL siRNAs) at a concentration of 6 µM to the respective microcentrifuge tube. Mix them gently by tapping.\nElectroporate 10 µL of cells with an electroporation system at 1,350 V for 10 ms with three pulses and transfer the electroporated cells into 5 mL of the culture medium. Repeat the electroporation for the rest of the cells prepared for each condition.",
    "Complete all respective electroporation. Transfer electroporated cells into two 35 mm dishes per condition and culture them under culture conditions for 3 days.\nOn the third day, treat all the electroporated cells in 0.5% FBS containing DMEM (low serum medium) for 6 h prior to the actual cell impedance measurement.   \n2. Preparation of the Real-time Cell Analysis System, Cell Invasion and Migration (CIM) Plates, and Electroporated U-118MG Cells for Plating\nPlace the real-time cell analysis system in a CO2 incubator under culture conditions 5–6 h prior to the start of experiment to stabilize the system to the culture conditions.\nFor the invasion assay, plate 50 µL of DMEM (plain medium) containing extracellular matrix (ECM) gel at 0.1 µg/µL in each well of the upper chamber of the CIM plate. To avoid having any air bubbles, use the reverse pipetting method. Immediately remove 30 µL of ECM gel, leaving 20 µL in the well.\nAfter the ECM gel coating, keep the plate in the incubator under culture conditions for 4 h with its lid on. During the ECM gel coating and drying, take preventive measures to avoid direct contact of the electrodes of the upper chamber of the plates with the hands, the surfaces of the biosafety cabinet, or the CO2 incubator.\nTo set up the impedance measurement program, double-click the associated software icon (see Table of Materials) to open the system software application (control unit). Each cradle has an individual window with different tabs to set the experimental conditions, the impedance measuring time interval and duration, and data analysis.",
    "Under the Layout tab, set quadruplicate wells for each biological condition and set two-step cell impedance measurements under the Schedule tab. The first step is for a one-time baseline measurement (one sweep with a 1 min interval), and the second step is to measure the cell impedance in respective individual cradles for an actual experiment. For migration, use 145 sweeps with a 10 min interval, and for invasion, 577 sweeps with a 10 min interval, individually set) in respective individual cradles.\nOne h prior to the start of the cell impedance measurement, add 160 µL of DMEM with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant in the wells of the lower chamber of the plate. Assemble either the upper chamber containing the ECM gel-coated wells or uncoated wells with the lower chamber to measure invasion and migration, respectively.\nFill the wells in the upper chamber with 50 µL of low serum medium and place them in the cradle of the system. Check whether all the wells are recognized by the control unit by clicking the Message tab. If the message displays as OK, the plate in the cradle is ready for the experiment. \nPreincubate the completely packed plates in the incubator under culture conditions for 1 h prior to measurements in the real-time cell analysis system cradle, which is essential for acclimation of a packed plate to the cell culture conditions.\nFor harvesting cells treated with low serum medium, trypsinize the cells as in step 1.3, collect them in low serum medium, and count the cells as in step 1.4.\nAfter counting, centrifuge cells at 100 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend 800,000 cells in 800 µL of low serum medium for the migration and invasion assays. Additionally, resuspend 300,000 cells in 2 mL of culture medium and seed in a 35 mm dish for Western blot analysis to confirm the regulated knockdown of Crk and CrkL.\n3. Baseline Reading, Seeding of the Cells, and Cell Impedance Measurement and Visualization\nMeasure the baseline reading by clicking the cradle Start button. The baseline should be read after preincubating the plates for 1 h in the cradle of the real-time cell analysis system under culture conditions in the CO2 incubator and before seeding the cells to the respective wells in the upper chamber.\nNOTE: Once the cradle Start button is clicked, the control unit will ask whether to save the experimental file. After the file is saved, the cradle analyzer measures the baseline cell impedance as set in the program initially and enters a pause mode until the cradle Start button is clicked again to measure cell impedance in the second step.\nTake out both plates for migration and invasion from the cradles after the baseline measurement and keep them in the biosafety cabinet.\nSeed 100 µL of cells (100,000 cells) in quadruplicates for each biological condition in the upper chamber of the CIM plate in the respective wells as programmed in the control unit of the cradle by reverse pipetting to avoid air bubbles.\nAfter seeding, keep the plate under a biosafety cabinet for 30 min at room temperature to allow cells to evenly settle down to the bottom. Transfer the plate back to the respective cradle and click the cradle start button to start measuring cell impedance as programmed in the second step of 2.5.\nAfter the last sweep, the experiment is finished, and the results are saved automatically.",
    "Under the Data Analysis tab, visualize the changes in cell impedance as cell index in a time-dependent manner during or after completion of the experiment. Each of the respective conditions of quadruplicates can be visualized either individually or as averages and/or standard deviations by clicking the Option boxes for average and standard deviation.\nTo export cell index data to a spreadsheet file, open an empty spreadsheet file, place the cursor in the middle of the Data Analysis window, and right-click. In the dialog box that appears, choose the option Copy Data into List Format, and paste the data into the open spreadsheet.\nAdjust the time in the raw data to represent the actual start time of the cell impedance measurement. The second step start time is set as zero.\nNOTE: The control unit has the option to obtain the cell index with or without normalization (i.e., normalized cell index) and visualize the results as a graphical presentation in a time-dependent manner. In this example, cell index data are exported without normalization for processing and graphical presentation.\nRelease the experiment by clicking the Release button in each cradle.\nSubscription Required.
