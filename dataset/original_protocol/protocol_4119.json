    "Protein purification and immobilizationNote: Before this procedure, it is suggested to pre-cool centrifuge to 4 ˚C and cool down all buffers used in this procedure on ice. Performing all steps at a cold condition is optimal.48 h post transfection (calcium phosphate assay is recommended for HEK293 cell transfection. In our experiment, a plasmid which encodes Merkel cell polyomavirus large T-antigen fusion to an IIT tag (IgG-IgG-TEV tag) was used in either 15 cm dishes or 10 cm dishes),wash transfected cells with cold PBS, scrape and re-suspend in cold PBS, and pellet at 500 x g for 5 min, 4 °C.Wash cells once with cold PBS and re-pelleted at 500 x g for 5 min, 4 °C.Wash cell pellet with IPP400 (100 µl buffer for each 1 x 107 cells. The ratio is adjustable dependent on cell line. For HEK293, a confluent 10 cm dish contains 1 x 107 cells and a confluent 15 cm dish contains 2.5 x 107 cells).Pass cells through a 20-G needle 10 times and rotate at 4 °C for 1 h.During rotation, wash IgG Sepharose6 Fast flow beads with at least 5x resin volume of PBS once. Sit on ice until most of the resin settles down. Usually, it will take 10-20 min.Remove PBS and pre-block IgG Sepharose6 Fast flow in 1% (w/v) BSA solution in PBS for at least 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Settle down resin on ice.Spin cell lysate from step A4 at 32,572 x g for 15 min, 4 °C to get rid of debris.Remove 1% BSA from resin in step A6, mix supernatant from step A7 with pre-blocked resin from step A6. Usually, 10-15 µl resin was used for cell lysate from each 15 cm dish in our experiment.Rotate for 2 h at 4 °C.",
    "Settle down resin on ice and gently remove supernatant with a fine tip. Add at least 5 volumes of IPP400 supplemented with NP-40 at a final concentration of 0.01% (v/v). Re-suspend resin.Repeat step A10 at least twice.Wash resin with IPP400 without NP40 twice as in step A10.Settle resin down on ice and remove supernatant.Spin down resin at 500 x g for 5 min, 4 °C. Gently remove all liquid with a fine tip.Equilibrate with 10 resin volumes of 1x helicase assay buffer. Settle resin down on ice. Use immobilized protein on resins as fresh as possible. Usually, use 10 µl beads and about 1 µg protein for each reaction (to measure how many recombinant protein you get from each dish, purify protein by IgG resin following manufacturer’s protocol and briefly quantify the purified protein). The usage of protein in each reaction is adjustable.Substrate labelingNote: Radioactive materials are used in this procedure. Please follow standard guidelines to safely handle radioactive materials.Dissolve synthesized oligo DNA in sterilized water to a final concentration 35 ng/µl.Prepare annealing reaction as follows:table:",

    "Heat to 95 °C for 15 min.Briefly spin down. Incubate at 50 °C for 1 h.Briefly spin down. Slowly cool down to room temperature.Add 5 µl NEB restriction enzyme buffer 2.Add dCTP and dGTP to a final concentration 0.1 mM and 1 µl [α-32P]-dATP (3000 Ci/mM, 1 mCi/ml)Add 1 µl DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment.Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Add 0.5 µl 10 mM dATP. Incubate at room temperature for another 20 min.Use labeled substrate as fresh as possible. Avoid freezing and thawing.Titrate labeled substrate as following: take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 µl substrate, add sterilized water to 9 µl and add 1 µl 10x DNA loading dye. Boil 5-10 min. Load on an 11% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electropherose. Dry gel and expose for autoradiography. Adjust the usage of substrate in the helicase assay depending on labeling efficiency and storage phosphor sensitivity (10-40 ng labeled DNA was used in our experiments). Helicase activity detectionNote: Radioactive materials are used in this procedure. Please follow standard guidelines to safely handle radioactive materials.Prepare reaction buffer as follows:10x helicase assay buffer5 µl100 mM ATP1 µlH2O44-x µlGently remove 1× helicase buffer from resins in step A15. Add reaction buffer to resin.Add x µl labeled substrate (dependent on your titration) to the reaction.Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min (during this process, keep shaking tubes on a Fisher vortexer with the speed 1.5).Add 5 µl stop buffer.Briefly vortex, shortly spin down resin at room temperature and take the supernatant. Mix with 10x DNA loading dye and 5-10 µl supernatant is loaded onto an 11% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophorese in 1x TBE buffer.Dry gel and subject to autoradiography."
