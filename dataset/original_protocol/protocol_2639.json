    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInduction anesthesia of the pregnant dam\nTiming: 3 min\nThese steps describe the transition of the pregnant dam from awake to a surgical level of anesthesia (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2298-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Outline of in utero ICV injection at E13.5\n(A–F) The schematic shows key steps of the surgical procedure: (A) Anesthesia with isoflurane, (B) Abdomen hair removal, (C) Incision of skin and abdominal wall, (D) Expose embryos, and (E) Inject virus into the lateral ventricle.\n(F) Injection site: Suture the abdominal cavity and skin followed by recovery and delivery.\nFigure created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nCheck that the anesthesia machine connects to the induction chamber and nose cone properly.\nPlace the pregnant dam in an induction chamber where a mixture of 1 L/min oxygen and 3% isoflurane circulates until loss of righting reflex.\nNote: 2%–4% isoflurane for induction, 1%–3% isoflurane for maintenance in oxygen during surgery via a nose cone; please follow local institutional guidelines.\nTransfer the mouse from the induction chamber to a prone position on the heating pad.\nApply ophthalmic gel to both eyes using a cotton-tipped applicator to avoid corneal drying.\nPlace the mouse on its back and position a nose cone with airflow at 1 L/min and 2% isoflurane as needed to maintain the absence of reflex withdrawal response to toe or tail pinch.\nIn utero ICV injection procedure\nTiming: within 30 min\nThese steps include the preparation for an aseptic surgical area, laparotomy, ICV injection, and suturing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nRemove hair from the abdomen by shaving and/or hair-removal cream using a cotton-tipped applicator.\nShave a larger region of the abdomen than what actual incision size will be.\nClean the skin with alternating solutions of 70% ethanol and Povidone-iodine 3 times (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Excess hair can induce infection following surgery.",
    "Note: To avoid skin irritation, be sure to rinse hair-removal cream thoroughly.\nNote: Apply the 70% ethanol and Povidone-iodine in a spiral manner moving from the center towards the periphery of the surgical field.\nNote: Standard laboratory gloves are recommended at all times up to this point.\nReplace standard laboratory gloves with sterile surgical gloves.\nTip: To minimize the need for glove changes, wrap frequently touched surfaces such as the LED illuminator with autoclaved aluminum foil.\nPlace a sterile surgical drape with a diamond-shaped aperture exposing the surgical field.\nPlace sterile gauze on top of the drape to absorb extra fluids.\nMake a 1.5 cm incision in the skin and carefully separate the underlying abdominal muscle fibers overlying the uterus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUse forceps to grasp one uterine horn and place it on the sterile gauze outside the mouse (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Avoid compression of the placenta or the blood vessels. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nUsing fingers or forceps, position an embryo to access the dorsal surface of the head. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nInsert the microcapillary into the lateral ventricle and inject 1 μL AAV by slowly releasing it from the glass capillary needle using a dropper bulb (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nCritical: Practice this procedure ahead of time by injecting a filtered solution of 0.1% Fast green dye to visually confirm that solution fills both ventricles and not in other brain regions. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nCritical: Between each injection, apply warm sterile saline to keep the embryos and uterine horns moist.\nAfter the desired number of embryos are injected, gently reintroduce the uterine horn to its original position into the abdomen.\nNote: This avoids tangling the related vasculature system, which can cause post-surgery bleeding.\nGently pull the other uterine horn.\nRepeat the same procedure 9–10.",
    "Suture the abdominal muscle and then the skin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nNote: When performing surgery on multiple pregnant dams on the same day, use a glass bead sterilizer between the dams to resterilize the surgery tools.\nPost-surgical care\nTiming: 15 min and follow-up daily for 3 days\nPost-surgical care describes both immediate care and 3 days of follow-up care.\nAdminister post-operative analgesia by subcutaneous injection in the interscapular area.\nNote: We inject Meloxicam (5 mg/kg) every 24 h for 3 days.\nNote: Analgesia protocols should follow local animal care committee guidelines.\nRecord analgesia administration on a surgery card for post-surgical care. An example analgesia documentation card is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2298-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of surgery and post-surgery cards for documentation\n(A) The surgery card contains anesthesia and analgesia information.\n(B) Post-surgery cards are used to indicate request to reduce mouse handling following the procedure.\nFollowing surgery, place mice in clean cages to lessen the chance of an infection.\nPlace cages on a heating pad until mice begin to move spontaneously.\nNote: Mice should move upon stimulation within 5 min and spontaneously within 15 min.\nFollow-up care: monitor and record the mouse’s weight, gross appearance, and behavior daily following surgery.\nNote: Check the suture region (mice may remove the stitches). If properly performed, laparotomy for in utero injection is unlikely to cause post-surgery discomfort or pain.\nNote: Lack of appetite, hunched posture, ruffled fur, and other posturing are examples of pain or distress.\nNote: Weight loss can occur as a result of dehydration.\nNote: Additional post-surgery complications include bleeding and infection near the surgical site. Any of these signs would warrant immediate attention and appropriate veterinary care.\nPause point: In general, we highly recommend finishing the entire injection procedure without delays, and as efficiently as possible."
