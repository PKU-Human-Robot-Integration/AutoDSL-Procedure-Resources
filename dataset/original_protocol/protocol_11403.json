    "Peripheral blood and serum were collected and stored from healthy donors and patients who gave written informed consent to take part in the study. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Blood Storage in DBS\nBlood sample collection\nCollect 3 mL of peripheral blood sample in a 3 mL tube with 5.4 mg of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\n\t\tNOTE: Store peripheral blood as DBS as soon as possible and within 8 h.\nWrite the patient code number on the bottom right-hand corner of the saver card.\nCarefully resuspend the blood with a 5 mL pipette.\nBlood spotting on DBS\nPipette and transfer one spot of blood (50 µL) onto the saver card (Table of Materials) with a 50–200 µL tip.\nRepeat step 1.2.1. to have a total of 3–5 blood spots. Discard the old tip and take a new one for each blood aliquot.\nLeave the DBS to dry overnight at room temperature in a horizontal position over an open non-absorbent surface, avoiding direct sunlight. Leave the cover of the saver card open to facilitate blood drying.\n\t\tNOTE: Any particulate in air or dust during this drying step does not affect downstream applications.\nStore the card at room temperature in a plastic bag with desiccant until use.\n2. DNA Extraction Starting from DBS According to the DNA Extraction Kit Datasheet (Section for Dried Blood Spots)\nSample preparation\nUse 3 dried blood spots from the card. Cut each of the dried blood spots from the card and separate them from the card with tweezers. Cut the separated dried blood spots into small pieces (diameter of about 1 mm).\nPlace the small pieces into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nSample digestion",
    "Add 180 µL of lysis buffer 1 provided in the kit (Table of Materials) to the tube. Add 20 µL of Proteinase K. Do not mix lysis buffer 1 with Proteinase k before pipetting into the 1.5 mL tube with blood spotted card. Mix by vortexing.\nPlace the tube in a thermoincubator and incubate at 56 °C for 60 min. If the thermoincubator is not equipped with a shaker, vortex the sample every 10–15 min for at least 10 s, taking care not to let the temperature of the sample decrease. Briefly centrifuge the tubes to remove drops from the lid.\nWash step\nAdd 200 µL of lysis buffer 2 (Table of Materials) and vortex for 10 s.\nPlace the tubes in a thermomixer or heated orbital incubator and incubate at 70 °C for 10 min. If the thermoincubator is not equipped with a shaker, vortex the samples once for at least 10 s, taking care not to let the temperature of the samples decrease.\nRepeat step 2.3.1. Transfer the 400 µL of lysate from the 1.5 mL tube to elution column (Table of Materials). Centrifuge the column at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nPlace the elution column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer 1 (Table of Materials) and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nPlace the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer 2 (Table of Materials) and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nPlace the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 x g for 3 min to dry the membrane.\nElution step",
    "Place the column into a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and discard the collection tube.\nPlace 50 µL of distilled water onto the center of the membrane. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 x g for 1 min. Collect the eluate and place it again on the center of the membrane.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the membrane.\nMeasure the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.\nStore DNA at -20 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA extracted from DBS can be used to perform several analyses such as SNP evaluation by Real Time PCR or DNA Sanger sequencing.\n3. Serum Storage for DSS\nBlood sample collection\nCollect 7 mL of peripheral blood sample in a 7 mL tube without EDTA. Leave the blood sample to coagulate for 30 min at room temperature.\nWrite the patient code number on the bottom right-hand corner of the saver card.\nCentrifuge the blood sample at 980 x g for 15 min at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Store serum as DSS as soon as possible and within 8 h.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from the tube and transfer it to a new 15 mL tube. Carefully resuspend the blood with a 5 mL pipette.\nSerum spotting in DSS\nPipette and transfer one spot of serum (50 µL) onto the saver card. Repeat this step to have a total of 3–5 blood spots.\n\t\tNOTE: Be very careful to pipette exactly 50 µL of serum into each spot. Serum should not go beyond from the dashed line of the card.\nLeave the DSS to dry overnight at room temperature. Leave the cover of the saver card open to facilitate blood drying.",
    "Store the card at room temperature in a plastic bag with desiccant until use. If the storage is longer than 14 days, store the card at -20 °C.\n4. ELISA Assay Starting from DSS\nElute protein from DSS.\nIf necessary, thaw a DSS for each sample. Cut DSS into small pieces (about 1 mm in diameter). Put the pieces into a 1.5 mL tube with 400 µL of PBS.\nShake the samples overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Shake them at low intensity. PBS should not wet the cover of the tube during shaking.\nUse the protein eluate as a serum sample for secreted protein/growth factor analysis according to ELISA kit instructions, after appropriate dilutions.\n\tNOTE: This procedure works well for DBP detection9. For other ELISA assays, an optimization step may be needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
