Susceptible cells (PHH, HepaRGNTCP, HepG2NTCP) infected with high mges (> 300) of HBV are lysed. A. Lysates are incubated at 70 °C in the presence of proteinase K and later loaded on silica column and eluted. B. T5 exonuclease (5 units/1 h) removes host genomic DNA (black) and HBV replicative intermediates (rcDNA, dslDNA, etc.) (green) and preserves cccDNA (red) intact. C. cccDNA is amplified by p1040/p1996 and detected by probe p1085.HBV DNA extraction from in vitro infected hepatocytes (Figure 1A)For infection performed in a 24-well plate (culture area: 2 cm2), trypsinize and resuspend infected PHH, differentiated HepaRGNTCP or HepG2NTCP cells (infection procedure see Ni and Urban, 2017) in 1 ml of culture medium. Take 10 μl of the resuspension for cell count by a cell counter (see Equipment). Calculate total cell numbers.Notes:At confluency, cells in one well of a 24-well plate approximately correspond to 180,000 PHH, 200,000 HepaRGNTCP and 500,000 HepG2NTCP cells. When smaller or larger plates are used, volumes of the respective buffers given in the protocol should be adjusted according to the respective culture area (cm2) of a well. Spin down the cells (900 x g, 5 min) at room temperature. Wash cells with 1 ml of PBS twice. Spin down the cells and carefully aspirate PBS (Optional: freeze cell pellet at -20 °C for long-term storage). For DNA extraction, manufacturer’s manual of the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (740952.250) is adapted with a minor modification regarding the incubation time in Step A2 (1 h instead of 10~15 min) and the elution volume in Step A6 (50 μl instead of 100 μl). Add 200 μl of lysis buffer T1, pipet up and down and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.",
    "Add 25 μl of proteinase K and 200 μl of lysis buffer B3, vortex and incubate the lysate at 70 °C for 1 h with shaking (500 rpm).Note: After proteinase K digestion, it is not necessary to re-centrifuge the lysates. Immediately perform the next step. Add 210 μl of ethanol (96%-100%) to the sample and vortex vigorously for a few seconds. Remove buffer from the lid by a short centrifugation and apply the samples to the column. Centrifuge (11,000 x g, 1 min) at room temperature. Discard flow-through.Add 500 μl of wash buffer BW. Centrifuge (11,000 x g, 1 min) at room temperature. Discard flow-through.Add 600 μl of wash buffer B5 (pre-add indicated volume of ethanol to the Buffer B5 Concentrate) to the column. Centrifuge (11,000 x g, 1 min) at room temperature. Discard flow-through. Repeat this step once.Remove residual ethanol from the column (13,000 x g, 1 min). Place the column into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 μl of pre-warmed (70 °C) elution buffer. Incubate at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuge (11,000 x g, 1 min). Freeze eluted DNA samples at -20 °C until use or analyze them immediately.Notes:Elution buffers are nuclease-free water or 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0). Do not use buffers with EDTA that may inhibit enzymatic activity in the next step. DNA concentration in eluates is 200-1,000 ng/μl. Preserve at least 10 μl of the sample without T5 exonuclease digestion for quantification of β-globin (internal standard) for normalization use. T5 exonuclease hydrolysis of total DNA elutes (Figure 1B)Assemble the reaction components in a 0.2 ml microcentrifuge tube following the table as shown:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190331/20190331073520_2209.jpgNote: Do not exceed unit and incubation time of T5 exonuclease since overdigestion leads to partial loss of cccDNA.",
    "Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h and inactivate the enzyme at 70 °C for 20 min in a thermocycler with heat-lid supply.Proceed quantification by real-time qPCR or freeze the products at -20 °C until use.Quantification of cccDNA relative to human β-globin (single-copy gene) by real-time qPCR (Figure 1C)Quantification of cccDNADilute primers and probe to 10 μM:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190403/20190403003059_7446.jpgFAM: 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA: 6-carboxytetramethylrhodaminePrepare the following qPCR reactions in a 96-well Hard-Shell PCR plate:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190331/20190331073628_0473.jpg#for absolute quantification, load 2 µl of each 1:10 serial-diluted plasmid (pSHH2.1: 109, 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, 103, 102 copies/μl) as templates on the same plate.Run qPCR program below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190331/20190331073654_0080.jpgRead absolute cccDNA copy numbers in the CFX ManagerTM Software.

Normalize cccDNA copies per well using values of human β-globin. Calculate cccDNA copies per cell (copies per well divided by cell numbers per well). For instance, if cell numbers in a well of 24-well plate are 4.2 x 105 (as determined in Procedure A1) and cccDNA copies per well are 8.52 x 105 (as determined in Procedure C), cccDNA copies per cell are 2.03."
