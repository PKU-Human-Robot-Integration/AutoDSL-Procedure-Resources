    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the IRST Human Research Ethics Committee.\nNOTE: In this protocol, we isolated DNA from urine samples to perform a UCF DNA integrity analysis. Lncap and MRC cell lines were used to construct standards. Techniques such as DNA extraction, DNA quantification (spectrophotometer and real-time PCR for the control gene, STOX1), and real-time PCR for specific oncogenes were performed (Figure 1).\n1. Urine Collection and Processing\nObtain a clean-catch first-morning urine sample in a clean, dry, plastic cup. Collect at least 50 mL of the urine sample.\nMaintain the urine at 4 °C for a maximum of 3 h and send it to the laboratory at the same temperature.\nMix each sample by inverting it twice immediately upon arrival in the laboratory and transfer into two 50-mL conical-bottomed polypropylene tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 850 x g for 10 min at 4 °C or at room temperature.\nCarefully transfer 10 mL of the upper part of the urine supernatant into two 5-mL tubes, leaving at least 2 mL of the supernatant above the cell pellet.\n\tNOTE: Transferring the upper part of the supernatant reduces the risk of contamination by cells or cellular debris. There is no clear delineation between the upper and lower parts.\nDiscard the pellet and immediately freeze the supernatant at -80 °C until use.\n2. DNA Isolation from the Urine Supernatant and Cell Lines\nNOTE: Isolate the DNA from a cell line (e.g., Lncap for prostate cancer or MRC for bladder cancer) using a commercial kit and following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of DNA from the urine supernatant should be performed using the commercial protocol, modified as follows:\nThaw one aliquot of the urine supernatant at room temperature.",
    "Vortex and mix the urine sample and transfer 1 mL of the urine supernatant into a clear 5-mL tube. Freeze the residual urine at -80 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of proteinase k directly to the sample.\nAdd 1 mL of AL buffer to the sample and mix well by pipetting.\nClose the tubes and incubate the samples at 56 °C for 15 min.\nDuring incubation, prepare one column for each sample and prepare the wash buffers, AW1 and AW2, as per the manufacturer's instructions (add the indicated amount of 100% ethanol).\nBring the samples back to room temperature and add 1 mL of absolute ethanol. Mix fully by pipetting.\nAdd 650 µL of the mixture obtained in step 2.7 to the column and centrifuge it at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nDiscard the tube containing the flow-through and place the column on a new, clean collection tube. Repeat steps 2.8 and 2.9 until all of the sample mixture has been used (5 times).\nAdd 500 µL of buffer AW1 without wetting the rim of the column. Centrifuge it at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nDiscard the tube containing the flow-through and replace it with a new, clean collection tube.\nAdd 500 µL of buffer AW2 without wetting the rim of the column. Centrifuge it at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.\nDiscard the tube containing the flow-through and replace it with a new, clean collection tube.\nRepeat step 2.12 to remove any residual washing buffer.\nPlace the column into a clean 1.5-mL tube. Add 50 µL of elution buffer AE and wait 7 min to ensure that the buffer wets the column.\nCentrifuge it at 8,000 x g for 1 min.",
    "Pipette the eluent from step 2.15 into the mini-column and centrifuge it at maximum speed for 1 min to ensure the maximum recovery of DNA.\n3. DNA Quantification and Dilution\nUsing a spectrophotometer, perform the quantification of DNA from both the cell line and the urine supernatant samples. Use 2 µL of sample on a bench-top spectrometer, as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nDilute the UCF DNA samples to obtain a concentration of 1 ng/µL and store the DNA at -20 °C until the DNA integrity analysis.\n\tNOTE: If the DNA quantity is not sufficient to proceed with real-time PCR (at least 100 ng), perform a new DNA isolation process.\nDilute the DNA from cell line samples to obtain six standards with different concentrations: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 0.5, and 2 ng/µL, each with a volume of 100 µL (st1, st2, st3, st4, st5, and st6). Store the cell line DNA standards at -20 °C until the DNA integrity analysis.\n4. DNA Integrity Test — PCR\nThaw the primers (the concentration depends on the type of assay), green supermix, cell-line DNA standards, and UCF DNA diluted samples on ice.\nPrepare strip tubes in the plate for the 72-well rotor disc. Aliquot 10 µL in duplicate for each standard and diluted sample and 10 µL of RNase-free water for the negative control.\nPrepare a mix of 1 µL of each primer (the concentrations are indicated in Table 1), 12.5 µL of green supermix, and 6.5 µL of RNase-free water for each sample. When preparing the mix, use the following number of samples: 6 standards for 2 replicates, number of samples for 2 replicates, negative control for 2 replicates, and 2 extra samples.\nAliquot 15 µL of the mix into each well. Do not pipette or spin the tubes.",
    "Start the protocol with the PCR conditions indicated in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: For the UCF DNA value, 29 DNA samples were processed for each real-time experiment using the 72-well rotor disc: 29 x 2 samples + 6 x 2 standards + negative control x 2 = 72 (UCF DNA value).\n\tNOTE: The protocol for the UCF DNA integrity analysis can also be performed using another PCR real-time instrument (when using another device, ROX dye may need to be added).\n5. DNA Integrity Test — Data Analysis and Interpretation\nNOTE: The UCF DNA value for each sample was obtained by a real-time instrument-detection system software using a standard curve construction for each individual PCR gene evaluation and using standard curve interpolation, as previously described7-9 (Figure 2).\nEvaluate the replicates; sample replicates with a difference ≥1 Ct must be discarded and re-evaluated in a second experiment.\nCalculate the median Ct for each sample and consider samples with a Ct value ≤ 36.\nEvaluate the specificity of the PCR products using melting analysis.\nEvaluate the concentration of each amplicon by interpolation with the standard curve; obtain a concentration value (ng/µL) for each amplicon.\nSubscription Required.
