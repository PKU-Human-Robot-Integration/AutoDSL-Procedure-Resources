    "Preparation of samples for FT-ICR/MS analysis   Homogenize samples with liquid nitrogen to create powder samples of whole plants using mortars and pestles.   Dissolve in extraction solvents to 20% fresh weight/volume. Two extraction solvents, 100% acetone and 100% methanol, are used to elute various polar compounds.   Filter extracted sample solutions through 0.45 µm filters (PTFE).   Transfer filtered sample solutions to vials.   Transfer 1 ml of sample solution to a separate vial. Place the sample solution into a draft chamber and apply nitrogen gas using EN1-16. At 40 °C solvents will evaporate using a heat block.   Dissolve samples in 50% acetonitrile (0.1~1 ml depending on sample varieties) and store at -80 °C.    Dilute samples 1:14 prior to ESI analysis.      FT-ICR/MS analysis   Perform Mass analysis using an IonSpec Explorer FT-ICR/MS in positive and negative ionization operation modes. Ions are generated from an ESI source with a fused silica needle of 0.005-inch i. d. (Oikawa et al., 2006). Samples are infused using a Harvard syringe pump mode 22 at a flow rate of 0.5 to 1.0 µl/min through a 100 µl Hamilton syringe. Set the potentials on the electrospray emitters to 3.0 kV and -0.3 kV for the positive and the negative electrosprays, respectively.    For positive mode, add 99.5% formic acid to extracted sample solutions (step A7) at a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Positive mode internal standards: Lidocaine (anaesthetic) m/z 235.18104, Prochloraz (agricultural chemical) m/z 376.03863, Reserpine (alkaloid sedative drug) m/z 609.28121, Bombesin (peptide) m/z 810.41479.   For negative mode, add 28~30% ammonia solution to extracted sample solutions at a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Negative mode internal standards: 2.4-D (plant hormone) m/z 218.96157, Ampicillin (antibiotic) m/z 348.10180, CHAPS 8 detergent) m/z 613.388865, (GluNAc)4 m/z 829.32023.   Mass spectra are acquired over the 100-1,000 m/z range and accumulate to improve the S/N ratio.",
    "The time period for accumulation depends on the total ion concentration. Analyze peaks using the IonSpec Omega ver.8 software. Proofread m/z of each peak referencing the internal standards. Measure the product ion mass spectra of each sample three times.    When ion peaks are detected at least twice out of three successive spectral scans, they are subjected to further data processing as ion signals from actual analytes.    A total of four mass spectral peaks from two different extraction solvents (methanol and acetone) and two ionization operation modes (positive and negative) are aligned using our in-house Java program. (If you are interested in this in-house Java program, please contact Prof. Ohta.)      Normalization of data Apply global normalization to data. To avoid zero division, missing values are filled with 105 as a background signal of FT-ICR/MS. Peak intensities are transformed using a logarithmic scale with a factor of 10. Four data matrices are used to apply global normalization. Global normalization calculation methods are as follows:    Average intensity is calculated by dividing the total signal by the number of detected peaks in each spectrum.   Average signal is calculated for all spectra in each elution and charge pair.    Normalization factor is calculated for each spectrum by dividing the average intensity for each spectrum by total average intensity.   Normalized intensity is calculated by multiplying the raw intensity in each spectrum by the previously calculated normalization factor. Empirical formulas are inferred by the accuracy of the FT-ICR/MS. Because the sample ions become adduct ions to attach protons and sodium ions, etc. on the ESI source, we assumed the following were involved in the detected peaks [M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M+H+methanol]+, [M+ammonium]+ in positive ionization mode and [M-H]- in negative ionization mode.
