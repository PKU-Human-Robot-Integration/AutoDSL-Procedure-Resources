    "1. Cell Preparation\nExperiments should be initiated using ex vivo cultured stem cell populations genetically engineered to express the Luciferase and eGFP reporter proteins. Here we use Luciferase/eGFP-expressing murine bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSC-Luc/eGFP) as previously described by Bergwerf et al.2, 5.\nTwo days before cell labeling, plate BMSC-Luc/eGFP cells at a density of 8 x 105 cells per T75 culture flask in 15 ml complete expansion medium (CEM) supplemented with 1 μg/ml Puromycine.\nAllow cells to grow for 48 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAdd 5 x 106 Glacial Blue micron-sized iron oxide particles (GB MPIO) per ml culture medium to the growing cell culture (total: 75 x 106 particles per 15 ml culture medium in a T75 culture flask).\nIncubate for 16 hr to allow particle uptake via endocytosis.\nWash away remaining particles and allow cells to grow for an additional 24 hr to obtain cell confluency and homogeneous distribution of the GB MPIO.\nValidate particle uptake visually using fluorescence microscopy by counting the ratio of eGFP+ and GB MPIO+ cells to the total amount of eGFP+ cells.\nWash GB MPIO-labeled BMSC-Luc/eGFP cells twice with 10 ml PBS and harvest cells following trypsin-EDTA treatment (5 ml per T75 culture flask for 5 minutes).\nWash harvested cells and resuspend at final concentration of 133 x 106 cells/ml in PBS.\nKeep cells on ice until transplantation.\n2. Cell Implantation in the CNS of Mice\nAnaesthetize mice by an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (80 mg/kg) + xylazine (16 mg/kg) mixture.\nWait for 5 minutes to allow mice to fall asleep.\nShave the mouse head to allow for sterile manipulations.\nPlace the mouse in a stereotactic frame.\nDesinfect the skin and wet the eyes of the mice to prevent dehydration.",
    "Make a midline scalp incision to expose the skull, and drill a hole in the skull using a dental drill burr at the given coordinates: 2 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to Bregma.\nVortex the cell suspension briefly and aspirate the cell suspension in the syringe.\nPlace the syringe needle at a depth of 2.5 mm under the dura and allow pressure equilibration for 1 minute.\nInject a 3 μl cell suspension (4 x 105 cells) at a depth of 2 mm under the dura and at a speed of 0.70 μl/min using an automated micro-injection pump.\nWait for an additional 5 minutes to prevent backflow of the injected cell suspension.\nSlowly retract the needle and disinfect the skin borders before suturing the skin.\nInject 300 μl 0.9% NaCl solution subcutaneously in order to prevent dehydration, and place the mouse under a heating lamp to recover from anaesthesia. Administer post-operative analgesic in accordance with institutional standards.\n3. In vivo Bioluminescence\nAnaesthetize the mice by a mixture of 3% isoflurane and oxygen.\nPlace the mice in the Photon Imager and reduce anaesthesia level to 1.5% isoflurane and oxygen.\nInject 150 mg D-luciferin per kg body weight intravenously.\nAcquire image for 5 minutes using the Photo Vision software.\nPerform image processing using the M3vision software. Quantify the observed signal using fixed regions of interest.\n4. In vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nAnaesthetize the mice with 3% isoflurane in a mixture of O2:N2O (3:7).\nPlace the mice in the restrainer of a horizontal 9.4T MR system and reduce anaesthesia level to 1% isoflurane in a mixture of O2:N2O (3:7).\nWet the eyes of the mice to prevent dehydration, attach a rectal probe to monitor the body temperature and monitor the breathing rate by placing a sensor underneath the mouse belly.",
    "Maintain breathing rate at 110 ± 10 breaths per minute and keep body temperature constant within a narrow range of 37 ± 0.5 °C.\nPlace the surface RF coil on top of the mouse head and position the mouse in the middle of the magnet.\nAcquire a set of 10 coronal T2-weighted spin echo (SE) images to obtain specific anatomical information and T2*-weighted gradient echo (GE) images in order to study stem cell migration with an in-plane resolution of 70 μm2. Set sequence parameters as follows: repetition time (TR): 500 ms, echo time (TE): 8 ms (GE sequence) and repetition time (TR): 4200 ms, echo time (TE): 12.16 ms (SE sequence); field of view (FOV): 18x18 mm2, matrix: 256x256, 1 mm slice thickness and 1 mm slice separation (Paravision 5.1 software).\nPerform data processing using Amira 4.0 software.\n5. Post Mortem Histology\nAnaesthetize the mice very deeply by inhalation of an isofluorane (4%), oxygen (0.5 L/min) and nitrogen (1 L/min) mixture for 2 minutes. Sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation.\nRemove the mouse brain from the skull and fixate the brain tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 hours.\nDehydrate the brain tissue by placing the brain subsequently in different gradients of sucrose: 2 hr in 5% sucrose in PBS, 2 hr in 10% sucrose in PBS, overnight in 20% sucrose in PBS.\nFreeze the brain tissue using fluid nitrogen and store the tissue at -80 °C until sectioning.\nSection the brain tissue in 10 μm thick sections using a cryostat.\nScreen unstained cryosections for blue fluorescence from the GB MPIO particles and green fluorescence from the eGFP expressing cells using a fluorescence microscope.\nScreen unstained cryosections for green/red background fluorescence from inflammatory cells.",
    "Perform further immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings to identify endogenous cell populations (e.g. microglia, astrocytes, T cells,...) interacting with cellular grafts.\n6. Representative Results\nWe here visually presented an optimized sequence of events for successful multimodal imaging of Luciferase/eGFP-expressing (stem) cell populations in the CNS of mice. At first, the described GB MPIO labeling procedure results in highly efficient labeling of BMSC-Luc/eGFP cells, which can easily be validated using fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2A). Next, upon grafting of GB MPIO labeled BMSC-Luc/eGFP in the CNS of mice, survival of the cellular graft can be monitored by in vivo BLI based on luciferase activity (Figure 2B). Additionally, the exact localization of grafted cells can be monitored by in vivo MRI based on the iron content of the GB MPIO (Figure 2C). Finally, histological analysis allows validation of the results obtained by BLI and MRI. Stable survival was confirmed by a stable eGFP expression in time (Figure 2D). For this, colocalization of eGFP-expressing cells with blue fluorescent MPIO allows for exact determination of localization and survival of grafted cells. In addition, this dual fluorescent labeling of the stem cells reduces the possibility to observe false positive results based on background fluorescence created by inflammatory cells5.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3906/3906fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Overview of the handling sequence\nCell labeling: BMSC-Luc/eGFP are labeled with 5 x 106 GB MPIO particles per ml culture medium. After 16 hr of incubation and a following rest period of 24 hr, cells are harvested for intracerebral implantation.\nCell implantation: GB MPIO labeled BMSC-Luc/eGFP are grafted in mouse brain at the following coordinates: bregma -2 mm, 2 mm right from the midline and 2 mm under dura.\nIn vivo BLI: Following intravenous administration of 150 mg D-luciferin/kg body weight, the generated light was acquired during 5 minutes using the Photon Imager.",
