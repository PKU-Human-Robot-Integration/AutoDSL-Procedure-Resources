    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol refers specifically to analyses utilizing an adherent cell line of pulmonary origin. However, it is recommended to incorporate multiple cell types into analyses as this will broaden the scope of cell-surface markers that can be candidate targets for autoantibodies. If cells are purchased from a commercial supplier, always refer to suppliers’ recommendations for optimal culturing practices, and ensure cells are cultured at sub-confluent densities. It may also be prudent to determine if the cell lines have Fc receptors. Cells lacking Fc receptors would be more reflective of the potential targets of circulating autoantibodies and thus are representative of targets which are vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of autoantibodies binding, such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity.\nPreparation of samples\nTiming: 1.5 h\nPrepare cells for staining.\nAspirate expended media from culture vessels.\nWash cells once with ambient temperature PBS. Swirl flask carefully whilst ensuring the cellular monolayer has made thorough contact with the PBS. Aspirate the PBS.\nDissociate subconfluent (<85%) target cells from T-175 culture flasks by adding 5 mL undiluted TrypLE Express reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog number 12604021) or an alternate dissociating reagent (like trypsin) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer flasks to 37°C incubator. Check flasks periodically to ensure cells have been dissociated. For a majority of cells this should occur well within five minutes; however, it is possible to incubate cells with TrypLE Express reagent for up to 20 min if they are refractory to detachment. However, prolonged exposure to TrypLE Express reagent may result in loss of certain surface antigens.\nCollect cells with 40 mL cold PBS and run through a 70 μm cell strainer into a new sterile 50 mL tube. Fill tube containing cells with cold PBS. Spin cells down at 500 × g for 3 min.",
    "Critical: Human plasma that contacts cell culture media may clot, and this will prevent recovery of the sample for analysis. It is therefore important to wash cells with ample PBS.\nResuspend cells at a concentration of 5.0 × 105 cells/mL in cold PBS and dispense 100 μL into a well of a U-bottom 96 well plate (5.0 × 104 cells/well). Dispense as many wells as there are biological samples, and an additional 9 wells for in-experimental controls. As a guide, refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example of a recommended plate format. Work with plates on a bed of ice to prevent cellular adhesion and upkeep of high cell viability.\nCritical: Ascertain cell viability; this can be made through automated counting methods or manually through trypan blue exclusion. For these experiments to be informative, cell viabilities must be greater than 90%. Dying cells are more likely to nonspecifically bind antibodies, including secondary antibodies, leading to false positive results. If cell viabilities are lower than 90%, return cells to culture following distributors’ guidelines, and reattempt experiments once cells have recovered.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1139-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sample plating layout",
    "To aid in the differentiation of control reactions from sample reactions, designate a row within a plate to controls (top row), followed by samples. Cells within the control wells will not be used to screen biological samples. The IgG Positive control will receive both the anti-CD98 antibody, as well as the staining cocktail. Single color controls, in concert with the unstained control will provide preliminary guidance as to where to draw positive-event gates. The placements of these gates are later refined by the boundaries set by the fluorescence-minus-one controls. We separated healthy human control samples from biological human samples of interest. These healthy human controls can further refine the lower limits of positive-event gates, as it is hypothesized that healthy human controls lack or have minimal circulating autoantibodies.\nTransfer up to 50 μL of biological sample, undiluted, from the previously prepared sample plate to corresponding wells containing the target cells.\nTo one of the control wells (i.e., the IgG positive control), add 48 μL PBS and 2 μL anti-CD98 antibody (20 μg/mL final concentration. Human anti-CD98 IgG; Absolute Antibody Clone CP1-5, Catalog number: Ab00361–10.0). CD98, an amino acid transport protein, is widely expressed on the surfaces of many mammalian cell types.\nNote: Ensure that the final volume per well is 150 μl. Alternate reagents may be used as the positive control in lieu of the human anti-CD98 antibody; however, these alternative reagents will need to be tested for binding to target cell types, and for their subsequent reactivity with the anti-human IgG secondary antibody.\nNote: At least six samples from healthy individuals should be included to serve as healthy controls, however the utilization of as many samples as possible is recommended.\nMix samples by gentle pipetting, then transfer plates to 4°C for one hour.\nStaining cells\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "Whilst plates are incubating at 4°C, prepare a cell staining mastermix using PBS as a diluent; this is to increase the signal to noise of the viability stain. It is advised to prepare a 10% overage to account for pipetting errors.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1139_2.csv\nNote: We used most stains at amounts that were below the manufacturer’s per-reaction recommendation (generally 0.5× the recommended volume) given that we were staining 5×104 cells.\nNote: Where applicable, include stains for other cellular markers as a means of providing assurances of cellular phenotype and/or cell health following culture. As a starting point, the minimal panel includes a viability dye, a stain for IgG, a stain for IgM, and a stain for IgA.\nCritical: As controls, ensure the inclusion of single-color stains and fluorescence-minus-one reactions. These control stains are performed in the absence of patient samples, and are used to inform where gates should be placed for positively-stained cellular populations during analyses. Single-color stain controls should also be prepared to aid in the placement of gates during data analysis and to control for non-specific binding of anti-Ig secondary antibodies to target cells. To this end, add only secondary anti-Ig antibody stains to cells (e.g., to create the single-color stain control for add only anti-IgG to cells that have not been exposed to patient samples). For fluorescence-minus-one control stains, add two anti-Ig antibodies, but omit the third (e.g., to create the anti-IgM fluorescence-minus-one reaction, omit the secondary anti-IgM antibody, but include the secondary anti-IgG and anti-IgA antibodies). Furthermore, these stains will provide assurances that cells tested lack Fc receptor expression.\nRetrieve plates containing cells from 4°C. Top each well with 100 μL of cold PBS and spin down at 500 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate supernatants. Wash cells once with 200 μL of cold PBS and repeat spin.",
    "Aspirate supernatants and add mastermixes to all wells except for wells designated for no-stain, single-color and fluorescence-minus-one reactions. Mastermix and other well volumes should be maintained to 100 μL. Gently mix by pipetting. Return plates to 4°C, in the dark, for 30 min.\nWhilst cells are undergoing staining, prepare a 1% (v/v) PFA solution by diluting PFA from stock, commonly available in 16% or 32% (v/v) stocks, in PBS, and store on ice.\nRetrieve cells from 4°C and top up with 100 μL of cold PBS. Spin plates at 500 × g for 3 min.\nWash cells two more times in cold PBS, centrifuging cells at 500 × g for 3 min between each wash.\nAspirate PBS and fix cells with 100 μL 1% PFA. Resuspend cells gently by pipetting. Plates should be immediately analyzed on a flow cytometer, however we have not observed decreases in fluorescence from plate stored for up to three hours at 4°C prior to acquisition. Record as many events as possible. Ensure height and if present, width parameters on side and forward scatter are recorded, as this would enable identification and exclusion of doublet events during analysis.",
    "Critical: Polychromatic flow cytometry often requires the creation of a compensation matrix to correct spectral overflow from partially overlapping fluorophores. Selecting fluorophores that minimally fluoresce at wavelengths of light as others within the same antibody panel will aid in limiting the effects of spectral overlap and improve resolution. Refer to the manufacturer of the flow cytometer to determine the correct steps in performing compensation. To perform compensation, we utilized non-fluorescent beads (BD CompBeads Anti-Mouse Ig, BD Biosciences, catalog number 552843 for antibody reagents; and ArC Amine reactive compensation beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number A10346 for viability dye reagents). As some of the antibody reagents used in this panel were not of murine origin, they were incompatible with the bead set. Thus, these reagents were substituted with murine isotype control antibodies (from the same vendor) conjugated to the same fluorophore.\nFor acquisitions, ensure a main cellular population (identified in Forward Vs. Side scatter) can be determined. Draw Forward scatter thresholds to eliminate the recording of background ‘noise’ events whilst leaving the main cellular population untouched. Draw a gate capturing the main cellular population and utilize the newly drawn gate as a stopping gate. Record at least 5000 events, or until IgM, IgA and/or IgG signals have stabilized, whichever is higher.\nFor analysis, first identify the cellular population in the Forward Vs. Side scatter area plot (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; left panel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1139-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example staining of human primary airway cells\nIn (A), the gating strategy allows for inclusion of single viable cells. Fluorescence-minus-one controls are shown in (B). Cells positive for IgM, IgG or IgA antibodies are demonstrated in (C).",
    "Next, draw a gate in the Forward scatter (Area) Vs. Forward scatter (Height) plot and draw a secondary gate around single events by identifying those with proportional Area and Height signals (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; middle panel).\nFollowing the previous step, select live cells based on the viability dye staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, right panel).\nLastly, determine limits for events positive for Ig staining by first using single-color controls to define negative populations (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), and refine these gates based upon the fluorescence-minus-one controls. Next, apply these gating strategies to samples (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C)."
