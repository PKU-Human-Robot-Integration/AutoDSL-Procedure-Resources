    "All animal work should be carried out according to relevant animal care guidelines. Obtain institutional approval for animal work prior to beginning protocol.\n1. Myointimal Hyperplasia Model (A)\nFor the intimal hyperplasia model, purchase C57BL/6J (Stock number 000664, C57BL/6J) mice at the age of 8 weeks weighing approximately 25 g. House mice for these experiments under conventional conditions; feed mice standard mouse chow and provide water ad libitum.\nMouse preparation: Introduce the mouse to an anesthetic state with isoflurane (2%) utilizing an induction chamber.\n\t\nRemove the abdominal hair using a hair trimmer, lay the mouse on its back and cover its nose and mouth with the facemask to assure the anesthesia.\nWith Provo-Iodine, disinfect the abdominal area universally, followed by 80% ethanol, in two cycles.\nAssure the absence of reflexes by pinching the hind limb to monitor the sufficient depth of anesthesia.\nSeparate the skin and muscle along the linea alba in two steps to expose the abdominal organs.\nLay the intestines in a saline moisturized glove. Wrap the glove around the intestines to keep them moist.\nAttentively clear away the fatty tissue sheeting the abdominal aorta. Expose the infrarenal aorta down to its bifurcation, taking care not to injure any branch vessels.\nFirst, place a microsurgical clamp on the proximal, infrarenal aorta to shut down the blood flow. Now, apply a second distal clamp next to the aortic bifurcation.\nWhen the blood flow is interrupted, make a small incision into the aorta close to the proximal clamp.\nInsert the balloon-tipped catheter, which has been moisturized with 0.9% saline, and advance towards the distal clamp of the aorta.\nFor endothelial injury, denude the aorta by inflating the balloon carefully and slowly pulling the catheter into the direction of the proximal clamp.\nRepeat the denudation maneuver twice.",
    "Remove the catheter and close the aortic incision using 10-0 prolene running sutures.\nCarefully open the distal clamp. In case of bleeding at the aortotomy site, close the clamp again, locate the bleeding and place additional interrupted stitches, as necessary.\nIf no bleeding can be observed, slowly open the proximal clamp.\nAn aortic pulse should be visible distally from the incision. Now the intestines can be arranged back in situ.\nRinse the abdominal cavity utilizing pre-warmed sterile saline.\nClose the abdominal wall beginning with the muscle layer using 6-0 prolene running sutures.\nNext adapt the skin under the use of 5-0 prolene performing running sutures.\nDuring the time the mouse is still anesthetized, apply 4-5 mg/kg Carprofen via a subcutaneous injection.\nAdd Metamizol to the drinking water (50 mg Metamizol per 100 ml) for pain control and continue for 3 days post surgery. Monitor animal throughout recovery.\n\t\tNote: The observation period for this model is 28 days.\n2. Atherosclerosis Model (B)\nFor the atherosclerosis model, purchase apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE -/-) mice (Stock number 002052, B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J) at an age of 4 weeks, and then fed for 4-6 months. House mice for these experiments under conventional conditions; feed mice high lipid western diet upon arrival (Harlan Laboratories TD.88137) and provide water ad libitum for a duration of 4 to 6 months.\nMouse preparation:\nFeed the ApoE -/- mice with western diet beginning at 4 weeks of age. Dietary manipulation should begin directly upon arrival.\nMaintain western diet throughout duration of experiment.\n3. Analysis\nMyointimal hyperplasia model (A)",
    "The region of interest in this model is the “lesion area”. Options for analysis include luminal obliteration, I/M ratio (intima/media ratio), maximal myointima thickness, myointimal area, Trichrome staining for fibrosis, and H&E staining for mononuclear cells (as illustrated in Figures 1A-1C). According to the scientific question numerous other stainings like Picrosirius red for collagen, immunohistochemistry, and confocal methods can be applied.\nAtherosclerosis model (B)The regions of interest in this model are the aortic valve, aortic arch as well as the descending aorta. Options for analysis: Sudan red staining for lipids and trichrome staining of aortic valve, aortic arch and descending aorta (as illustrated in Figure 1D).\n\tThis model also yields a variety of other staining options like for example Oil Red O for neutral lipids, Picrosirius red, immunohistochemistry, and confocal methods.\n\t\nSudan red staining: Perform the Sudan red staining on freshly harvested aortic tissue.\n\t\t\nRemove the diet 6h before harvesting.\nIntroduce the mouse to an anesthetic state with isoflurane (2%) utilizing an induction chamber. Assure the absence of reflexes by pinching the hind limb to monitor the sufficient depth of anesthesia.\nOpen the chest; cut off the apex of the heart and perfuse via the left ventricle, first with saline (3 ml), followed by 4% PFA (3 ml) through the aortic root to fix the aorta.\nFree the aorta from the root to its bifurcation. Try to remove fatty tissue as much as possible.\nCut off the heart and the aortic root, and store them in 4% PFA for histology.\nFor histology the aortic root has to carefully be placed in the paraffin block in an upright position to allow the cutting of the aortic root generating slides that display all 3 valvular leaflets.",
    "Cut one end of the aortic tree and fix it onto the silicone layer with fine pins. Open the aorta longitudinally and fix the aortic tissue.\nRinse the tissue with 50% ethanol. Immerse the tissue with Sudan III staining solution for about 15 min.\nRinse lightly with 50% ethanol to remove the excess Sudan III. (Note: 50% ethanol may wash the dye away.) Rinse with dH2O, and take photos for further analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
