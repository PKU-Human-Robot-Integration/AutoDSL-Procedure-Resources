    "Animal care followed the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the approval by the Université de Montréal Council on Animal Care (protocol #10-Rech-1560). Detailed information on materials and methods used is provided in the Table 1.\n1. Anesthesia\nInsert a single-lumen catheter into a jugular vein.\nSedate the ewe using acepromazine (Atravet 10 mg/mL) 2 mg intravenously approximately 30 min prior to the induction of anesthesia in order to reduce stress associated with the procedure which in turn reduces levels of cortisol.\nAdminister diazepam (Diazepam 5 mg/mL) 20 mg, ketamine (Ketalar 100 mg/mL) 4-5 mg/kg and propofol (Propofol 10 mg/mL) 0.5 to 1 mg/kg intravenously to induce general anesthesia.\nInsert an airway exchange catheter into the trachea using a laryngoscope with a Wisconsin type blade (Extra-long 350 mm Left-Handed Blade) to aid with the intubation. Slide the silicon endotracheal tube (9 to 12 mm Inner Diameter) off the airway exchange catheter and into the trachea. This technique facilitates the intubation process. Inflate the cuff of the endotracheal tube carefully to avoid pressure-induced ulceration of the trachea and fixate the tube to the head of the ewe.\nConnect the endotracheal tube to the respiratory circuit of the anesthetic machine and begin mechanical ventilation immediately. Adjust ventilator settings to maintain a PaCO2 within normal limits of 35 to 45 mmHg.\nInsert a catheter into the auricular artery (22 to 20 G; 1 in [0.9 x 25 mm] to 1.16 in [1.1 x 30 mm]) and connect to non-compliant tubing to monitor direct arterial blood pressure.",
    "Use a multi-parameter physiologic monitor to record the electrocardiogram, direct arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO2), capnography (PETCO2), and temperature every 5 min. Transfer all physiologic data via a serial cable to a central physiologic data-collecting computer. Maintain normal body temperature using a circulating water blanket.\nAdminister a balanced poly-ionic solution at 10 mL/kg for the first hour of general anesthesia and then reduce to 5 mL/kg/h.\nAdminister trimethoprim-sulfadoxine 5 mg/kg IV to the ewe just prior to the skin incision as antibiotic prophylaxis.\nUse standard aseptic techniques with all surgical manipulations of the ewe and fetus.\nBarrier nurse the ewes at all times. This includes also the non-surgical personnel. This will minimize the enzootic potential for e.g., Coxiella burnetii. Use gloves and masks (N-95 type) at all times.\n2. Overview of the Surgical Procedure\nMake a 20 cm midline incision through the lower abdominal wall immediately cranial to the udder through the linea alba to minimise abdominal muscle damage.\n\t\nRetract the greater omentum cranially and the uterine horns are palpated manually. Palpate each horn from the body of the uterus to the tip of the horn noticing the number of fetus and their size. If there is more than one fetus, choose the larger fetus by evaluating manually the head size and the width between the orbits.\nHold the head of the chosen fetus firmly through the uterus partially exteriorized. Perform a 10 cm hysterotomy on the large curvature with Metzenbaum scissors. Put immediately over the head a non-latex sterile surgical glove filled with sterile saline as if it were a hand. Alternatively, use moistened 4x4s to keep the fetal head moist. Secure the uterus to the abdominal wall.",
    "Exteriorize the right and left thoracic limbs and pull the fetus gently out of the uterus up to the xyphoid process.\nInsert polyvinyl catheters into the right and left brachial vein and arteries using a standard cut-down technique. Insert another polyvinyl catheter into the amniotic cavity by fixating its’ end to the sternum of the fetus.\n\t\t\nUse sterile catheters only. We recommend gas sterilization in your standard facility. Attach each catheter to a needle and the needle to a double stopcock to allow for later blood sampling or pressure monitoring.\nSuture stainless steel electrodes to the manubrium, xiphoid process and to each point of the shoulder to monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG).\nReturn the fetus to the uterus. All catheters and electrodes exit via a small stab incision in the left flank.\nClose the laparotomy incision using a three layer closure. Suture the abdominal wall with a synthetic absorbable monofilament suture USP 2 in a simple continuous fashion. Close the subcutaneous space with a synthetic absorbable braided suture USP 0 in a simple continuous fashion. Use surgical stainless steel staples to close the skin incision.\nDetailed description of the surgical procedure\n\t\nRemove wool by shaving the xyphoid process to the mammary gland and along the fold of the flank on each side with a blade # 40. Clean the ventral abdomen then thoroughly with a 4% chlorhexidine gluconate and a soft brush for 3 min.\n\t\t\nPerform a standard sterile scrub with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% starting from the center of the abdomen and progressing in a centrifugal fashion for 3 min. Pour sterile saline on the abdomen to remove the disinfectant soap. For the final step of the surgical preparation, perform three alternate passages of Chlorhexidine gluconate solution 2% and isopropyl alcohol 70%.",
    "Ensure the depth of anesthesia is adequate prior to incision. Make a standard laparotomy incision from the umbilicus to just cranial to the udder through the linea alba to minimise abdominal muscle damage.\nInsert a long sponge forceps in the abdomen along the left abdominal wall up to the planned exit site for catheters in the paracostal region.\n\t\t\nPush the tips of the forceps against the wall until an assistant can locate it and confirm the appropriate site. Open slightly (1 cm) the jaws of the forceps and let the assistant make a 2 cm full-thickness stab incision.\nExteriorize the tips of the forceps through the incision, open again, and gently grasp the catheters with the forceps that is finally pulled out of the abdomen through the ventral abdominal incision. Of note, some groups implant the catheters and then exteriorize them. This has the drawback that intrasurgical fetal ECG monitoring is not possible.\nPalpate the uterus to determine fetal position and numbers. Determine the largest fetus using the inter-aural distance. Incise the uterine wall on the large curvature over the dorsum of the head, avoiding the cotyledons.\n\t\t\nInsert a blunt-ended cannula through the placental membranes to obtain an amniotic fluid sample free from hemorrhage. Incise the placental membranes using scissors.\nExteriorize the cranial half of the fetus through this incision. Place a sterile non latex surgical glove filled with sterile saline at 37 °C over the fetus head to help maintain normothermia.\n\t\t\nDuring removal of the fetal upper body from the uterus, have the assistant hold the Babcock's up to prevent the loss of amniotic fluid. Then, again using Babcock forceps, clamp the fetal membranes and uterine wall to the skin to prevent abdominal contamination with amniotic fluid.",
    "Expose only the parts of the fetal body that need to be instrumented and keep the remaining parts inside the uterus or covered by moist and warm (37 °C) sterile cloths, respectively.\nAbduct both thoracic limbs to facilitate the exposure to the brachial artery and vein bilaterally. Incise along the medial aspect of both antebrachium and carefully dissect around the brachial artery and vein.\nInsert polyvinyl catheters into the right and left brachial arteries and the left brachial vein using a standard cut-down technique.\n\t\t\nFree the vessel to be catheterized from adjacent tissue over 1 cm. Ligate the distal portion of the vessel with a braided synthetic absorbable USP 2-0 suture. Preplace a ligature at the proximal aspect of the vessel but keep it untied.\n\t\t\t\nUsing Castroviejo scissors, cut the vessel transversally to approximately 30% of its diameter. Stop the blood flow partially by pulling on the proximal suture. Insert the catheter in a proximal direction.\nInsert the polyvinyl catheter up to 8 cm proximally or until resistance is detected and then pull back slightly. Temporally secure the proximal aspect of the catheter using a vascular clamp. Place another suture around both the proximal and distal aspect of the catheter. An assistant is continuously aspirating and flushing the catheter to ensure patency of the catheter.\nClose the fetal skin using a USP 2-0 braided synthetic absorbable suture, with a continuous suture pattern.\nTo the right and left shoulder, manubrium and xyphoid process, fixate an insulated stainless steel electrode to facilitate the monitoring of the fetal ECG.\nSuture the amniotic pressure and sampling catheter to the sternum. This catheter is fenestrated at its extremity.\nSecure all the catheters on the dorsum of the fetus using a USP 2-0 braided synthetic absorbable suture material.",
    "Prior to the replacement of the fetus back into the uterus, administer clenbuterol 30 µg IV slowly over 15 min to avoid hypotension and to provide uterine relaxation.\nSuture the fetal membranes using USP 4-0 braided synthetic absorbable suture material with a continuous pattern. Incorporate only one catheter or electrode at a time into the closure to ensure a tight closure. Use a double layer Cushing pattern respecting Halsted principles to close the uterine muscular layer using a USP 0 braided synthetic absorbable suture material. Bury the surgical knots carefully.\nUsing a purse-string suture pattern, secure all the catheters and ECG cables as they exit the left paracostal incision.\nUsing a USP 2 monofilament synthetic absorbable suture material secure the linea alba with a continuous pattern. Close the subcutaneous tissues using USP 2-0 braided synthetic absorbable suture material with a continuous pattern. Secure the skin layer with surgical staples.\nAdminister 250 mg of ampicillin intravenously and again via the amniotic catheter into the amniotic cavity. Replace lost amniotic fluids with warm saline.\nPlace all the exteriorized catheters and ECG electrodes into a place bag to maintain sterility. Place a stockinette around the torso of the ewe to secure all the catheters and electrodes to the body of the ewe.\nStop general anesthesia, and extubate the ewe once laryngeal reflexes have returned to normal.\nReturn the ewe to a metabolic cage once she is stable following general anesthesia. The ewe will reside in the metabolic cage for the duration of the experiment. The ewe should be able to stand, lie down and eat ad libitum while monitoring the non-anesthetized fetus without sedating the mother.",
    "For the following three days, administer antibiotics prophylactically to the ewe (Trimethoprim sulfadoxine 5 mg/kg) and fetus (250 mg of ampicillin intravenously and again via the amniotic catheter).\nEvaluate the metabolic status of both ewe and fetus using blood gas analyses.\nFlush all catheters with the minimal volume of heparinized saline possible. Caution – do not exceed the daily dose of heparin and fluids permissible to the fetus. It is possible to fluid overload the fetus. Flush slowly once a day ~5 mL NaCl per line after antibiotic prophylaxis.\nData recording and analysis\n\t\nDuring surgery, optionally record the maternal and fetal ECG and heart rates as well as maternal arterial blood pressure and airway pressure (Paw) continuously (Figure 1). Use the Life Window Monitor to acquire all maternal data except ECG. Feed these data into analog-digital converter along with fetal and maternal ECG signals; pass maternal and fetal ECG first into 1901 pre-amplifier. Record and display all data in manufacturer’s software.\nTake a 1 mL arterial sample simultaneously from the ewe and fetus for arterial blood gas analysis, lactate, glucose and base excess determination (in plasma) at the begin of the fetal surgery (immediately after inserting the first arterial catheter) and after closing the uterus.\nDuring postoperative recovery, take a 3 mL fetal blood sample to measure the IL-6 and TNF-α inflammatory profiles. Centrifuge the plasma at 4 °C (4 min, 4,000 x g), decant and store the plasma at -80 °C for subsequent ELISA testing.",
    "Note: For the purpose of the reported representative results, six days after surgery the animals were sacrificed using intravenous injection of 20 mL sodium pentobarbital. Fetal growth was assessed by body, brain, liver and maternal weights. The duration of the experimental period will obviously vary depending on the design chosen for the particular research question and can reach ~6 weeks.\nCytokine analyses (optional step)\n\t\nDetermine cytokine concentrations (IL-6, TNF-α) in plasma using an ovine-specific sandwich ELISA. Pre-coat mouse anti-sheep monoclonal antibodies (capture antibody IL-6) or mouse anti-bovine monoclonal antibody (TNF-α) at a concentration 4 µg/ml on ELISA plate at 4 °C for O/N, after 3 times wash with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, PBST).\nBlock the plates for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBST. Wash the plates with washing buffer 3 times.\nUse recombinant sheep proteins (IL-6, TNF-α) as ELISA standard, prepare a serial dilutions range from standard 1 of 2,000 ng/ml to standard 7 of 31.25 pg/ml.\nLoad 50 µl of serial diluted protein standards and samples per well and incubate for 2 hr at RT, wash the plates 3 times. Run all standards and samples in duplicate.\nApply 50 µl of rabbit anti-sheep polyclonal antibodies (detection antibody IL-6) or rabbit anti-bovine polyclonal antibody (TNF-α) at a dilution of 1:250 in wells and incubate for 30 min at RT. Wash the plates with washing buffer 5 times.\nAdd 50 µl of the goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated (dilution 1:5,000) for 30 min.\nIncubate with 50 µl of TMB substrate solution per well.\nStop colour development reaction at desired time with 25 µl of 2 N sulphuric acid.\nRead the plates on ELISA plate reader at 450 nm, with a 570 nm wavelength correction.",
    "Note: In our assays, the sensitivity of IL-6 ELISA was 16 pg/ml, the sensitivity of TNF-α ELISA was 13.9 pg/ml, respectively. For all assays, the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance was <5% and <10%, respectively.\nStatistical analyses\n\tNote: The exact statistical methods will depend on the research question. Here we report the methods used to test for any significant differences in the blood gases reported in Table 2.\n\t\nTest normal data distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by parametric or non-parametric tests with adjustment for multiple comparisons, as appropriate.\nUse K-means cluster analysis to identify the fetuses in the cohort that were spontaneously hypoxic and determine the respective pO2 and O2Sat values (consider pO2 < 20 mmHg or O2Sat < 55% as fetal hypoxia). 44-48\nUse statistical software such as SPSS for the analyses.\nPresent data as Mean±SD with statistical differences at p<0.05 considered significant.\nSubscription Required.
