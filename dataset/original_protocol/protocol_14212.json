  "procedures": [
    "The investigations described conform to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2015A00000029). All surgical manipulations were performed under deep anesthesia and the animals did not experience pain at any stage during the procedure. All experiments described were non-recovery.\n1. Preparation\nFreshly prepare 50 mL of ferric chloride (FeCl3) at 50% (w/v) diluted in deionized water.\nCut the umbilical tape into 5.5 cm pieces and soak in the freshly prepared 50% FeCl3 solution 1 week before the procedure.\n\tNOTE: The umbilical tape used is thick and takes some time to absorb the 50% FeCl3 solution.\nFast each canine overnight before surgery.\nLabel cryovials for plasma and urine collection, 50 mL sterile centrifuge tubes for all organ storage, and 10% formalin containers for brain and carotid fixation for H&E staining with animal identification, date of birth, date of surgery, and treatment.\nPrepare 100 mL of each solution for each canine procedure: 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), 10% neutral buffered formalin, and 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride [TTC in PBS (pH 7.4), store in the dark].\nAcquire ample liquid nitrogen for all cryovials and 50 mL tissue tubes for flash freezing for the day of the procedure.\nAcquire two ADP/collagen cartridges for PFA-100 (Platelet Function Analyzer) platelet reactivity for each canine for each time point of interest.",
    "Acquire one 4.5 mL sodium citrate blood collection tube, for each blood draw before sacrifice, for plasma separation and storage. At sacrifice, draw 16 blood collection tubes for the plasma storage. After each blood collection tube is full, spin at 4,000 x g for 30 s to isolate platelet rich plasma and transfer clear layer into cryovials. Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen before storage at -80 °C.\nAcquire one 4.5 mL lithium heparin blood collection tube, for each PFA-100 time point of interest to record platelet reactivity. At each blood draw, introduce 800 µL of whole blood from a lithium heparin blood collection tubes into each ADP/collagen cartridge without air bubbles to follow the platelet reactivity.\nAcquire two EDTA K3 blood collection tubes (1.8 mg of anhydrous EDTA per 1 mL of blood), for complete blood count (CBC) at baseline and at time of sacrifice.\n\tNOTE: This volume is adequate for most core facilities to run each twice in case of mechanical error. Although a CBC was run at both the baseline before injury and at the time of sacrifice, investigators can add more blood draws as approved in their animal protocols for additional analyses. Check with the facility as to volumes and delivery requirements for their equipment.\nPrepare a 2 mL heparinized syringe by filling and coating the syringe the day of the procedure for blood gas analysis at time of sacrifice.\n\tNOTE: Check with the facility as to volumes and delivery requirements for their equipment.\n2. Canine Carotid Artery Occlusion\nWeigh an adult (>18 months) beagle canine and pre-medicate with intramuscular acepromazine (0.025-.2 mg/kg) followed by an initial intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (5-20 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.01-.25 mg/kg). Induce deeper anesthesia with 1-5% isoflurane based on the heart rate, respirations, and jaw tone.",
    "NOTE: Exact anesthesia is dictated by the weight and the approved animal protocol. Although injections may result in pain for the animals, the duration of this discomfort will be minimal (less than 3 s).\nPrior to taking the animal to the surgery table, remove hair by clipping. Apply lubricating ophthalmic ointment to the anesthetized animal's eyes to prevent dryness.\nPlace the animal in supine position using a positioning system and attach electrocardiography (ECG) leads to foot pads. Intubate through the trachea with a 6.5 mm cuffed endotracheal tube, mechanically ventilate at 14 breaths/min, and maintain each dog with a continuous inhalation of 1-5% isoflurane (depends on the approved animal protocol).\nTo determine the extent of canalization of the carotid and the length of the occlusive thrombus, perform angiography before injury, before MRI, and at time of sacrifice (see below for additional instructions).\nInsert a femoral arterial sheath and a plastic catheter and secure with a loose 0-silk suture. Temporarily close the sheath and catheter during the transport and imaging studies. See canine angiography below for additional instructions).\nFor blood draws, insert a 16G x 45 mm intravenous catheter through the intact skin distal to the femoral arterial sheath cut down site. Advance the catheter into the surgical exposure and visualize it as it enters into the exposed femoral vein immediately adjacent to the arterial sheath. Once fully inserted into the vein, withdraw the needle, cap the catheter with a 3-way stopcock, and flush it with 2 mL of 0.9% sterile saline. Secure the catheter to the skin with a 0-silk suture.\nMake an 8-10 cm incision of the skin directly on the top of the right common carotid artery region and dissect the fascia to isolate the vessel from the surrounding tissue.",
    "Carefully introduce forceps between the carotid artery and the vagus nerve to separate. Avoid touching the carotid artery more than necessary as it may cause constriction of the vessel.\nDry the exposed area of the artery with the sterile gauze to avoid FeCl3 solution dilution.\nPlace the Doppler flow probe around the carotid allowing amble space to wrap the umbilical tape around the carotid without touching the flow probe and start recording the blood velocity and continue throughout the procedure (Figure 1 Top). Record the baseline flow for ~ 5 min before applying the umbilical tape.\n\tNOTE: Baseline flow before FeCl3 umbilical tape placement usually averages around 250 mL/min.\nWrap the prepared FeCl3 umbilical tape around the carotid using a hemostat immediately below the flow probe without touching it for 15 min, remove, and discard.\n\tNOTE: Occlusion is designated as zero flow mL/min.\nStabilize the occlusive thrombus for 45 min. Add additional saline to the probe as needed to maintain a signal.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the age, gender and the type of canine, additional placements of the prepared FeCl3 umbilical tape may be necessary for allowing 30 min for occlusion to occur before re-application. No differences were observed in thrombosis by ferric chloride application with gender in beagles. It was not found necessary with this model to reapply a fresh FeCl3 umbilical tape more than once and have never deviated from the FeCl3 umbilical tape preparation protocol. If the laboratory is using a different breed or age of canine, the FeCl3 umbilical tape should be applied to the initial subjects to make sure that the thrombosis protocol does not deviate, or a group of canines may be necessary to establish FeCl3 application time for that breed or age in their specific study. The occlusion times, in this experiment, range from 8-30 min after FeCl3 umbilical tape application.\nTo determine the stroke or hemorrhage volume in addition to the downstream thromboembolic events which may result from pharmacological interventions, transport canines with additional ketamine injection to a magnetic resonance imaging machine (see below for additional processing).\nWhile still under a deep surgical plane of anesthesia from a final angiogram/MRI (see below for imaging protocol), indicated by a lack of response to noxious stimuli, collect whole blood desired for later analysis, then open the chest by cutting through the ribs starting at the sternum, and excise the heart by cutting the blood vessels (exsanguination).",
    "NOTE: In this experiment, whole blood (<10 mL) was drawn at baseline, 5 min after agent administration, and 60 min after infusion from the femoral sheath and saw no effect on the process of thrombolysis. At sacrifice, an unlimited volume can be drawn for additional plasma storage if approved in the animal protocol. Analyze, process and store all whole blood within 30 min of sacrifice. Ensure that blood is not drawn in excess of the approved percentage of the animal's body weight as detailed on the approved animal protocol. All experiments described were non-recovery.\nRinse the heart with 0.9% saline and flash freeze samples in the liquid nitrogen if desired.\nBefore removing the carotids, measure the clot length by placing a ruler beside it and record. Place the tissue marker on the middle of the clot and at the same place on the contralateral carotid for ease in histology trimming. Mark the contralateral carotid at the same length.\n\tNOTE: The average clot length with this model is 1.75 cm.\nRemove the entire length of the clot on both vessels and fix in 10% formalin. Remove the contralateral carotid artery within the length marked by the tissue marker. Cut the contralateral carotid artery in half at the middle of the clot. Flash freeze half the contralateral carotid artery in liquid nitrogen for later analysis and fix the other half in 10% formalin to embed beside the injured carotid for histological analysis below.\nRemove organs for any desired analysis, rinse with 0.9% saline, and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nRemove the skull with a circular bone saw. Slowly remove the skull without damaging the brain beneath.",
    "After the brain is removed from the skull, rinse it in cold 0.9% saline, and cut two 4 mm sections from the middle of the brain, cutting laterally with a sharp scalpel. Place one of the 4 mm sections into 2% TTC for ischemic demarcation (see additional processing for brain TTC), while the other slice placed in 10% formalin for 7 days for H&E staining (see additional processing for brain H&E).\n3. Canine Angiography\nNOTE: This is shown in Figure 2 and is done during the surgery at time points of interest.\nFeel for a pulse in the right inguinal region and make a 3-5 cm ventral sagittal incision.\nExpose the femoral artery and separate it from the surrounding tissues using blunt dissection.\nUse a right-angle hemostat to place a 0-silk suture around the distal end of the exposed artery.\nTie the distal 0-silk suture and apply slight tension to the artery by clamping the loose 0-silk suture ends to the skin with hemostats.\nPlace a second 0-silk suture around the proximal end of the exposed segment.\nPuncture the artery midway between the proximal and distal 0-silk suture ties using an 18G introducer needle to pass a guide wire into the artery.\nLoad an assembled 6Fr sheath and dilator onto the guide wire, grasping the wire as it exits from the assembly.\nAdvance the dilator and sheath over the guide wire. Make sure to maintain a firm grasp of the wire as it protrudes from the dilator while advancing the dilator sheath assembly.\nAfter full insertion, tie the proximal 0-silk suture around the sheath to maintain hemostasis at the arterial puncture site.\nSimultaneously remove the dilator and the guide wire.\nOpen the one-way valve to verify the presence of pulsatile blood flow and flush with 3-5 mL of normal saline.",
    "Connect the access sheath one-way valve to a fluid filled extension line attached to a pressure transducer to monitor and record invasive blood pressure measurements.\nPre-load a 0.35\" guide wire into a 4Fr. angiographic catheter and connect to the contrast injection manifold set with a Tuohy y-adapter.\nPull the tip of the guide wire just inside the distal tip of the catheter and flush the entire assembly with saline.\nInsert the angiographic catheter into the hemostatic valve of the sheath and then advance the guide wire about 5 cm beyond the distal catheter tip.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance and using a retrograde trans-aortic approach, slowly advance the catheter into the aortic arch.\nInject 2-3 mL of contrast agent diluted 1:1 with normal saline to identify the take-off of the brachiocephalic trunk.\nUse the guide wire to direct the catheter into the brachiocephalic trunk, and then selectively into the right common carotid artery.\nRemove the guide wire and inject 2-3 mL of diluted contrast to verify that the catheter is placed in the carotid.\nInject 3-4 mL of undiluted contrast while recording angiographic runs using both digital subtraction and standard angiographic techniques.\nRepeat steps 3.18-3.21 for the repeated angiography at additional time points.\n4. Magnetic Resonance- Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) of canine brain\nNOTE: This is shown in Figure 3A-3B.\nEnsure that the dog is under deep anesthesia.\nEnsure that the dog's physiological parameters are monitored throughout the imaging including ECG and heart rate.\nEnsure that the dog is lying in the supine position with its head in the bilateral openings of the brain coil.\nEnable the 3 Tesla (3T) magnet.\nPerform T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), a basic pulse sequences in the MRI.",
    "NOTE: The sequence uses the differences in the T2 relaxation time of tissues at different pathological conditions.\nPerform localizer imaging to acquire pilot images of a dog brain before the anatomical imaging using T2-weighted gradient echo imaging sequence and determine the field of view (FOV), number of slices and slice thickness to completely cover the brain.\nUse the following T2-parameters: slice thickness = 3 mm, TR = 4,000 ms, TE = 75 ms, ETL = 7, acquisition matrix = 320 x 256, FA = 180ᵒ, FOV = 320 x 320 pixels, image resolution = 2.4615 pixels per mm.\nPerform diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using echo planer DTI sequence 4 h after MCA occlusion and immediately before sacrifice.\nUse the following DWI parameters: b = 1,500 s/mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, TR = 4,600 ms, ET = 86 ms, ETL = 55, acquisition matrix = 140 x 140, FA = 90ᵒ, FOV = 231x257, image resolution = 0.9333 pixels/mm (Table 1).\n5. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of the canine brain\nNOTE: This is shown in Figure 3D.\nAfter 7 days in 10% formalin, embed the 4 mm brain sections in paraffin.\nTrim the paraffin blocks until they are level with a microtome, removing any additional paraffin from the top of the brain tissue, then cut the brain tissue at 4 µm and place one brain section on each 2\" x 3\" inch slide.\n\tNOTE: Before staining, place all solutions in separate containers so that slides can be moved from one solution to another without drying out.\nDe-paraffinize each brain slide and hydrate with tap water.\nPlace each brain slide in Hematoxylin 560 for 8 min.\nRinse each brain slide in tap water.\nDifferentiate each brain slide with 1% Acid Alcohol for 1 s three times.",
    "Rinse each brain slide in tap water.\nBlue each brain slides with 1% ammonium hydroxide for 1 s.\nRinse each brain slide in running tap water for 2 min.\nDehydrate each brain slide in 70% Ethanol (EtOH) for 1 s twelve times.\nCounterstain each brain slide in eosin for 1 min.\nDehydrate each brain slide in 95% EtOH for 1 s twelve times.\nDehydrate each brain slide in 100% EtOH.\nClear each brain slide in xylene and then apply a 2\" x 3\" inch coverslip on top of the brain slide, removing air bubbles with resinous mounting media.\n\tNOTE: All solutions are reused except water and ethanol for multiple days of staining and multiple slides. All processing after brain sections are placed on slides are done in glass staining jars, but plastic staining containers are commercially available also. Replace any solution when it becomes discolored and keep them tightly covered.\n6. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of canine carotids\nNOTE: This is shown in Figure 1 (Left).\nAfter 24-72 h in 10% formalin, cut the injured carotid in half at the middle of the clot and embed ~ 1 cm of injured carotid and ~ 1 cm of the contralateral control in the same paraffin cassette.\n\tNOTE: The blood clot inside the carotid is fragile. Wait until the vessel has been fixed in 10% formalin before cutting so that the clot is not disturbed. Embedding both the injured and control carotid arteries in the same paraffin block will allow cutting at the same time at the same place in the blood vessel.",
    "Trim paraffin blocks until level with a microtome, removing any additional paraffin. Then cut sections at 4 µm on to 25 mm x 75 mm x 1 mm slides without rotating the paraffin block so that the contralateral carotid sections are placed at the top of the slide.\n\tNOTE: Three carotid sections were placed on to each slide, but one can add depending upon stains of interest.\nDe-paraffinize each carotid slide and hydrate in tap water.\n\tNOTE: Unlike the brain slide which should be processed individually, carotid slides can be processed in bulk by placing in jars which fit several slides at a time without touching one another.\nStain each carotid slide in hematoxylin for 8 min.\nRinse each carotid slide in tap water.\nDifferentiate each carotid slide with 1% Acid Alcohol for 1 s three times.\nRinse each carotid slide in tap water.\nBlue each carotid slide with 1% ammonium hydroxide for 1 s.\nRinse each carotid slide in running tap water for 2 min.\nDehydrate each carotid slide in 70% EtOH for 1 s twelve times.\nCounterstain each carotid slide in eosin or 1 min.\nDehydrate each carotid slide in 95% EtOH for 1 s x 12.\nDehydrate each carotid slide in 100% EtOH.\nClear each carotid slide in xylene and add a 24 mm x 50 mm coverslip with resinous mounting media to remove the air bubbles.\n7. 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining of the Canine Brain\nNOTE: This is shown in Figure 3C.\nPlace the other 4 mm section removed from the middle of the brain immediately proximal to the H&E section into previously prepared 2% TTC (carotid artery occlusion). Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for at least 20 min, turning over the brain section for even staining every 5 min.",
    "NOTE: After 20 min, the section should be cherry red on both sides. Additional time may be needed based on TTC freshness and thickness of tissue section.\nRemove the TTC solution and replace it with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4 to optimize the color contrast.\nWhen the contrast between white and red staining is optimal, place TTC brain slices between clear plastic sheets, dry of excess fluid, and scan at high resolution for tracing of ischemic regions.\n\tNOTE: Sections can be stored indefinitely in paraformaldehyde solution, but staining will fade.\nSubscription Required.
