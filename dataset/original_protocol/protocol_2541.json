    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLipid droplet staining protocol in cultured myoblast\nTiming: up to 3 days\nCultured myoblasts contain abundant lipid droplets (LD) in the cytosolic compartments. The morphology and size of these lipid droplets can be determined by the transmission electron microscopic images (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The LDs can be readily labelled with lipophilic dye or fluorophore such as BODIPY. In this scenario, LDs are visualized as fluorescent puncta in images captured with a 20× Plan Apochromat objective with a numerical aperture of 0.70 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The LD numbers on cultured myofibers are quantified on the same imaging plane and all fluorescently labeled LDs are quantified. From our staining results, LDs in cultured myofibers are well separated from one another, allowing unambiguous enumeration of the number of LDs. Quantitative analysis indicates that each cell contains an average of 5.1 LDs in LDHigh satellite cells and 1.2 LDs in LDLow satellite cells in myofiber culture; and the average size of the LDs are 0.6 μm as quantified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Here we describe the procedures and details to stain LD in cultured myoblasts.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2174-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: For other cell types with complex LD profiles and dynamics resulting in multiple intertwined LDs rendering the quantification difficult, accurate enumeration of the number of the LDs should be based on confocal images.\nPlating myoblasts for imaging.\nPrior to staining, trypsinize myoblasts, and plate them onto culture vessels of choice. For reference, 6 × 104 myoblasts are seeded onto surface areas equal to one well in a 24-well plate for staining 24–48 h later.\nNote: Due to auto-fluorescence in the plastic culture plate, and/or conditions that allow confocal imaging, other vessels or materials such as chamber slides or coverglass should be considered to eliminate auto-fluorescence and improve signaling specificity.\nCoat positively charged glass coverslips with Matrigel to provide the extracellular matrix for myoblasts to attach and support proliferation.\nSterilize the coverslips by covering in aluminum foil and autoclave before use. Carefully unwrap the slide and use hygiene practice in a cell culture hood to place the coverslip into a 6-well culture plate.\nDilute Matrigel in DMEM medium (without FBS) at 1:10 ratio and add about 1 mL to the coverslip to cover the entire coverslip, let the Matrigel sit for approximately 30-min at room temperature. Collect the excess Matrigel and leave the coverslip to dry for about 20-min in the cell culture hood.\nAfter quantification of cell number after trypsinization, 40,000 myoblasts can be diluted in 200 μL of culture medium (F-10 Ham’s nutrient mix, 20% Fetal Bovine Serum, 4 ng/mL basic Fibroblast growth factor, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and added dropwise to the coated coverslip.",
    "Carefully place the 6-well culture plate in the 5% CO2 cell culture incubator (Heraeus Heracell 240 CO2 Incubator) and check the cell status the next day. If the myoblasts have attached to the slide, add enough medium to submerge the entire coverslip in the well to prevent drying of the myoblasts. Harvest the myoblasts according to desired cell density, usually at around 60%–70% confluence.\nChamber slides/coverglass (IMEB) are optimal for IF staining of cells.\nNote: They offer detachable chambers for staining as well as relatively small cell number for visualization. Check with the manufacturer if the slides are coated/treated for cell attachment, if not, the slides/coverglass can be coated with matrigel as shown in step 1.b.ii).\nCulture plates/dishes are sub-optimal for IF staining.\nNote: Due to the auto-fluorescence especially if the signals are weak and if microscope equipped with long distance lens is not available in the lab, these vessels should be avoided. However, if other choices are not available, culture plates can also be utilized. Myoblasts generally attach very well in the plastic culture plates without coating but additional coating of the culture plate (collagen or Matrigel) can be up to user’s discretion.\nPreparing for IF staining with different culture vessels.\nNote: BODIPY is compatible with either fixed samples or live staining. Depending on the assay, different strategies can be used.\nLive staining of BODIPY.\nDilute BODIPY (1:1,000) directly in the culture medium, rock the plate gently so that BODIPY spread evenly in the medium.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at 37°C in the cell culture incubator. At this step, if no other staining is required for imaging, nuclei can be counterstained with DNA stains such as DAPI at 1 μg/mL or Hoechst-33342 at 10 μg/mL final concentration.",
    "If further staining is desired, please refer to the below instructions as to how to prepare the different vessels for future staining.\nCritical: Care should be taken to avoid the exposure of the culture plate to light as this may bleach the BODIPY signal. Culture plate can be wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid light exposure during the transportation from culture room to dark room designated for staining.\nBODIPY staining after fixation. If post-fixation staining is desired, directly take out the culture vessels at the time of choice, aspirate the medium off, wash the cells 3 times with 1 × PBS and fix with 4% PFA for 10 min at RT. In this method, BODIPY will be stained together with secondary antibodies against chosen primary antibody. Here we describe the different methods to prepare the culture vessels for staining.\nMatrigel coated coverslips. At the desired time point, take out the cell culture plate and transfer the coverslip out from the culture dish with the help of a tweezer. Carefully blot away the excessive medium underneath and on the periphery of the desired staining area with Kimwipes. Use a hydrophobic pen to draw a boundary so that the liquids will remain on the slide during the staining procedure. The slide can now be fixed for staining.\nNote: Drawing with hydrophobic pen will require a dry surface. Kimwipes can be carefully wrapped around a 1,000 μL pipette tip (or simply substitute using a Q-tip), and used to blot dry any wet areas. This step may wipe away cells in the area.",
    "Chamber slides/coverglass. The myoblasts can be stained with the chambers intact to better help distinguish different wells/treatments if such experimental design is desired. Aspirate the medium off and wash the cells with 1× PBS for 3 times. Fix the myoblasts on the chamber slides with 4% PFA for 10 min and proceed with next steps.\nCulture plates/dishes. Aspirate the medium from the plates/dishes and wash 3 times with PBS. The myoblasts can now be fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min and proceed with next steps.\nStaining primary antibodies of choice and BODIPY in cultured myoblasts.\nNote: Depending on the staining strategies, BODIPY can already be stained at this step. If that is the case, take care not to bleach the signals by exposing the vessels to any light source before vessels are ready for imaging.\nFix the myoblasts with 4% PFA for 10-min at RT, wash with 1× PBS 3 times and quench any residual PFA with 100 mM Glycine for 10 min. Then wash the myoblasts another 3 times with 1× PBS before blocking with blocking buffer for at least 1 h at RT.\nPause point: cells can now be kept in blocking buffer for up to 1 week.\nDilute PAX7 antibody (marker for myoblasts) in blocking buffer at ratio determined empirically and incubate in the cold room (4°C) overnight.\nNote: Other primary antibodies can be used depending on the cell types of choice at ratios determined by the lab accordingly.\nWash the myoblasts with 1× PBST with 0.1% Tween-20 for 3 times, 5 min each time.\nPrepare Alexa 568 goat anti-mouse IgG1 against PAX7, BODIPY and DAPI mixture in 1× PBST and stain the myoblasts for 1 h at RT in the dark room.",
    "Note: Pay attention to the choice of fluorophore of the secondary antibody against the primary antibody so that the fluorophore does not overlap with that of BODIPY.\nNote: The choice of secondary antibody should correspond to the species and isotypes of the primary antibody used in step b).\nThen wash the myoblasts with 1× PBST for 3 times, 5 min each, before mounting with mounting media.\nSeal the slides with nail polish, let dry and use for imaging.\nVisualization and quantification of the lipid droplets in MuSCs attached on myofibers\nTiming: up to 5 days, depending on the collection time points\nMyofibers are isolated based on the published protocol.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Upon isolation, single myofibers are resuspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF, Promega) and split into three parts. Transfer two parts of myofibers to two 6-cm horse serum coated culture dishes. These two plates will be used for 48 h and 72 h collection respectively. Rock the plate a couple of times so that the myofibers are spread evenly in the dishes to ensure that the myofibers are not intertwined after 48 h or 72 h in culture. Representative images of BODIPY staining on satellite cells associated with myofiber culture are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nCritical: Keep in mind that the myofiber staining procedure require using a dissection microscope and lighting to better visualize the myofibers and prevent losing the myofibers in between washes. Yet too much exposure of the BODIPY (if BODIPY has been stained already at this step) to the lights would diminish the signals and cause the quenching of fluorescence before imaging. Therefore, BODIPY staining after PFA fixation is preferred when staining LD in myofibers.",
    "Staining of myofibers collected from different time points.\nThe remaining one part of the myofiber (at 0 h) can be collected and fixed immediately in 4% PFA by transferring the myofibers with a glass Pasteur pipette to a well containing approximately 500 μL of 4% PFA in a 48-well plate. Collect the remaining myofibers at 48 and 72 h after culture. Similarly, collect the single myofibers from the culture with a large-cut Pasteur pipette to empty wells containing 500 μL 4% PFA in the 48-well plate used for collecting the 0 h myofibers. Pay attention to replace with fresh 4% PFA if excessive medium is transferred. Fix the myofibers and wash with 1× PBS for 3 times.\nNote: From this point on, the same procedure can be conducted on the myofibers collected from the 3 time points.\nNote: If too much medium is transferred to the well, remove the medium/PFA mixture after the myofibers settled to the bottom of the well under the dissecting microscope with a fine cut Pasteur pipette and then add 500 μL fresh 4% PFA and fix for 10 min at RT. Then wash the myofiber with 1× PBS for 3 times.\nPause point: the myofiber can be stored at 4°C until all the myofibers are collected.\nQuench residual PFA with 500 μL of 100 mM Glycine for 10 min at RT in the myofibers from different time points, then wash the myofibers with 1× PBS for 3 times.\nBlock the myofibers with blocking buffer for 1 h at RT.\nThen dilute the PAX7 and MyoD antibodies and stain the myofibers overnight at 4°C. PAX7 and MyoD are used to distinguish the different cellular status (PAX7+MyoD-: self-renewing; PAX7+MYOD+: proliferating; PAX7-MyoD+: differentiating).",
    "On the next day, wash the myofibers three times with 1× PBST for 5 min and then incubate with corresponding secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG1-568 for PAX7, anti-mouse IgG2b-647 for MyoD1 (SCBT-G1), DAPI for nuclei), plus BODIPY (493/503) for 1 h at RT. Wash the myofibers with 1× PBST for 3 times before mounting the myofibers onto a positively charged glass slides (IMEB).\nBriefly, pre-wet the central region of glass slide with 1× PBST, then transfer the myofibers to the slide using the large-bore Pasteur pipette, pay attention to not transfer too much 1× PBST on the slide. Then use a fine-cut Pasteur pipette to remove the 1× PBST from the slide with one end slightly tilted. Then add mounting medium onto the slide and use two 30-G syringe needle to separate the intertwined myofibers into individual myofibers. Add mounting medium if necessary, then carefully cover the slide with a coverglass. Place the coverglass at a 30 degree angle relative to the slide with one edge touching the slide, gradually lower the higher edge of the coverglass until it lies flat onto the slide. Blot with Kimwipes to remove the excessive mounting medium and seal the slide with nail polish.\nNote: Pay attention to slowly and carefully cover the coverglass to prevent formation of bubbles and movements of myofibers.\nMyofibers can now be visualized under the microscope.\nVisualization and analysis of lipid droplets in freshly isolated MuSCs\nTiming: Up to 1 day",
    "Muscle-derived single cell suspension preparation should be performed before sorting. Different labs utilize different surface markers for sorting MuSCs. In our lab, we use CD45, CD31 and SCA-1 as negative selection markers for hematopoietic, endothelial and mesenchymal cells respectively, and VCAM-1 (CD106) as a positive selection marker for MuSCs according to the method described by Liu et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Representative FACS gates for isolation of MuSCs from WT mice are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nCritical: One important consideration is the fluorophore of the antigen used to stain and sort MuSCs should not overlap with the fluorophore of lipid stain such as BODIPY or LipidSpot in your lab.\nCritical: FACS-based separation of BODIPY-labeled fresh-isolated satellite cells (FISCs) often bleaches out the green BODIPY signal during the prolonged washing and sorting steps. Therefore, we used a more stable far-red fluorophore LipidSpot for FACS-based applications. Readers are encouraged to test if BODIPY signals are stable throughout the sorting procedure in their system.\nStaining and separating MuSCs based on lipid contents.\nSort MuSCs by BD-FACS Aria III FACS system (BD Biosciences) into FACS wash medium (HAM’S F-10 medium supplemented with 10% Horse Serum, 1% P/S).\nPerform BODIPY/LipidSpot610 non-stained control by aliquoting a small volume of the sorted MuSCs.\nAnalyze the non-stained control cells first to establish the threshold of the BODIPY non-stained sample at 503 nm or LipidSpot610 non-stained sample at 638 nm.\nStain the remaining cells with BODIPY/LipidSpot610 as described below.\nFor BODIPY/LipidSpot610 staining, centrifuge the MuSCs at 4°C at 2,500 rpm (∼600 g) for 5 min. Resuspend the MuSCs with 1× PBS and then stain with BODIPY/LipidSpot610 at RT for 30 min, wash with 1× PBS again before analyzing the MuSCs with the FACS sorter again.",
    "Different intensities of the BODIPY/LipidSpot610 signals can be gated into low, medium and high, respectively, and the corresponding cells can be sorted based on the BODIPY/LipidSpot610 signals.\nNote: In our study, the LDLow MuSCs display higher self-renew capacity while the LDHigh MuSCs display higher differentiation potentials. Therefore, we separated the MuSCs into LDLow and LDHigh and sorted them out for transplantation experiments.\nPlate the resulting cells onto Matrigel coated plates to examine their proliferative and differentiation potentials or inject them into muscle-injured immune-deficient mice to assess their regenerative capacities.\nNote: Additional sorting strategies can be used to sort out MuSCs utilizing reporter mouse lines. Both sexes of mice at 2–3 months were used for this experiment. Here we briefly describe the sorting strategy using Pax7CreERT2(Gaka);Rosa26LSL-tdTomato mouse model. In this model, after TMX (Tamoxifen) injection, all the MuSCs are labeled by tdTomato. Single cell preparation from hind limb muscles from this mouse should be directed to the ref. 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], and the staining protocol of LipidSpot610 can be modified from step 3. Please note the emission wavelength of LipidSpot610 is at 638 nm. LDHigh population is defined as the top 27.5% and LDLow population is defined as the lower 27.5% based on the fluorescence intensity. Sorted MuSCs are visualized under the microscope to visualize the success of the gating (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nIdentification of lipid droplets with transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nTiming: Up to 1 week",
    "Due to the hydrophobic nature of LDs, their presence can be easily identified by Osmium Tetroxide treatment which binds to lipids and generates great contrast when visualized under electron microscope. Here we have described two procedures to prepare myoblasts and muscle samples for the visualization of lipid droplets under electron microscopy. Detailed TEM sample processing and troubleshooting can be found in a comprehensive protocol by Graham et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: For reference, the concentrations and duration of different reagents for TEM sample preparation can be found in Yue et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCritical: For this procedure, highly toxic and inhalable substances such PFA and glutaraldehyde may cause allergies in the respiratory tract or skin if exposed. Therefore, researchers should wear respirators and perform the designated steps in a fume hood or a well-ventilated area. Dispose of the hazardous waste according to the institute’s instructions.\nCritical: During muscle injury induced by cardiotoxin (CTX), resident muscle satellite cells quickly activate, followed by proliferation and differentiation to fuse with myofibers to repair the injury. During this process, MuSCs may exit their niche underneath the basal lamina. This challenged the identification of MuSCs among other infiltrating cells from the circulation. Researchers are encouraged to use this method with caution for their cell types of interest.\nPreparing myoblast samples for TEM.\nNote: TEM sample processing will require pelleting and processing the myoblasts in agarose. It is recommended to have approximately 1 million myoblasts for easier handling during sample preparation and enough myoblasts to quantify under the electron microscope. To this end, myoblasts can be grown in a 10-cm culture dish. Myoblasts can be harvested after desired treatments or can directly be subjected to TEM sample preparation.",
    "After myoblasts have established in the culture dish, take out the culture dish from the incubator and immediately wash with ice-cold 1× PBS once.\nAspirate the excess 1× PBS quickly and immediately add 2 mL of TEM fixation buffer (0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1.5% paraformaldehyde). Since there was residue PBS from the previous wash, aspirate the TEM buffer off and replace with 1.5 mL of fresh TEM buffer.\nIncubate the myoblasts (on the plate) for 5 min for initial fixation. Then use a cell scraper to carefully scrape the myoblasts off from the culture dish. Collect the myoblasts in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: This step should be conducted on ice for better preservation of the ultrastructure such as mitochondria in the myoblast.\nThe myoblasts can now be stored in 4°C until TEM sample processing.\nPreparing TA muscle for TEM.\nNote: We have previously demonstrated that lipid droplets in the muscle stem cells are dynamically remodeling during muscle injury to facilitate the regeneration.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Studying MuSCs in their native environment in vivo provide invaluable information about their physiology. MuSCs under homeostasis are unique as they are wedged between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Besides, quiescent MuSCs also manifest heterochromatin structure compared to myonuclei.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] These characteristics will aid in the quick identification of homeostatic MuSCs under electron microscopy.\nPerform cervical dislocation to quickly sacrifice the mouse, pinch the toes to ensure the death of the mouse before procedures.\nIn a timely fashion, remove the skin with surgical scissors and expose the TA muscle. Quickly add two drops of fixative to the muscle before dissecting the TA muscle out from the mouse. This will greatly help retain the ultrastructure such as lipid droplets and mitochondria.",
    "Carefully dissect the TA muscle by cutting the distal tendon first, take care not to stretch the muscle too much as this may damage the sarcomeres.\nTransfer the TA muscle to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of fixative. To ensure effective penetration of osmium tetroxide in the TA muscle, the TA muscle should be trimmed along the long axis to reduce the width to about 5–10 mm. The muscle can now be stored at 4°C until ready for TEM sample processing.\nNote: LD appears as a circular/round electron opaque structure lined with a single membrane under our TEM sample processing procedure. LDs can be in close proximity with mitochondria or nucleus. For reference, the average size of LDs in cultured myoblasts was around 0.6 μm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D)."
