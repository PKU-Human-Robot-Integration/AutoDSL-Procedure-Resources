The chest area does not require prior shaving.\nFloat each skin sample in a petri dish containing 10 mL of PBS on ice while other samples are being processed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1307-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Processing the tissues\n(A) Harvest skin along the dotted circle. Scale bar = 1 cm.\n(B) Flip the skin sample surface-side down. Fix the sample by pressing down on the neck side of the sample with a pair of curved forceps. Scrape off subcutaneous tissue with another curved forceps held in your other hand. The subcutaneous tissue will come off easier when it is scraped off in the direction of the hair pattern.\n(C) After 45 min incubation with epidermal digestion solution, fix the neck side of the skin with a pair of curved forceps. With another curved forceps, scrape on the skin surface, following the hair direction, to detach the epidermis. Dotted circles depict the dermis. Arrowheads depict detached epidermis.\n(D) Pump 8 to 10 times with a 50 mL syringe. Use the lid of the petri dish to make a slope.\n(E) Red circle indicates cell pellet after the cell suspension is spun down.\n(F) Mince skin well until it gets paste-like texture using ophthalmic scissors in 35 mm petri dishes on ice.\n(G) Images of tissues before and after enzymatic digestion.\n(H) Pump 8 to 10 times with a 12 mL syringe. Red circle indicates the cell pellet after the cell suspension is spun down.",
    "If more than 5 mice need to be harvested, repeat step 1–2b.\nTransfer skin samples (one sample at a time) surface-side down onto the lid of petri dishes and scrape off subcutaneous tissue using two forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, Method video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTransfer back the skin into each petri dish and float on PBS.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethod video S1. Subcutaneous tissue removal, related to step 2d\nGenerating cell suspension\nGenerating epidermal cell suspensions\nTiming: 1.5 h\nFloat skin surface-side up on 10 mL of epidermis digestion solution (0.15% trypsin and 0.75 mM EDTA) in 100 mm × 15 mm petri dish. Remove any air bubbles under the skin samples using two curved forceps.\nIncubate for 45 min at 37°C in a cell culture incubator. CO2 is not mandatory.\nBriefly transfer the skin onto the lid of the petri dish and discard epidermis digestion solution by decanting. Put the skin back onto the petri dish and pour 20 mL of 4°C 5% FACS buffer into each petri dish.\nScrape off the epidermis from the dermis gently with two curved forceps. If enzymatic digestion is effective, the epidermal component should detach without exerting excessive force. Discard dermis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, Method video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nThe epidermal cells are further mechanically dissociated with a 50 mL syringe (Covidien). Pump 8 to 10 times without applying too much pressure. Applying excessive force may affect cell viability (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nFilter the cell suspensions through sterile 100 μm Falcon® Cell Strainers (Corning) placed on 50 mL conical tubes. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nBreak the cell pellets and resuspend in 10 mL of 5% FACS buffer.\nFilter the solution through sterile 40 μm Falcon® Cell Strainers (Corning) placed on new 50 mL conical tubes.",
    "Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 300 μL of 5% FACS buffer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethod video S2. Detaching epidermis, related to step 6\nGenerating whole skin cell suspension\nTiming: 3 h\nAdd 5 mL of whole skin digestion solution into each well of 6-well plates. Keep on ice.\nPlace the skin sample on Kim wipe very briefly to remove excess PBS.\nTransfer each skin sample into 35 mm petri dishes and mince well using ophthalmic scissors.\nTransfer 1 mL of whole skin digestion solution from the 6-well plate and add it to the minced tissue. Further mince until paste-like textures are obtained (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Mincing process should be done on ice.\nPour the minced skin into 6-well plates with a whole skin digestion solution.\nIncubate for 2 h at 37°C in a cell culture incubator. CO2 is not mandatory.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-1 mM EDTA into each well for the last 10 min of incubation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nDeactivate the enzymatic reaction by adding 4 mL of 4°C 5% FACS buffer into each well.\nMechanically dissociate with a 12 mL syringe. Pump 8 to 10 times. Excessive force should not be applied.\nFilter the cell suspension through sterile 100 μm Falcon® Cell Strainers (Corning) placed on 50 mL conical tubes. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). In this final centrifugation step for whole skin, we recommend 8 min instead of 5 min to avoid cell loss since pellets may be loose compared to those obtained from epidermal cell suspensions.\nBreak the cell pellets and resuspend in 10 mL of 5% FACS buffer.",
    "Filter again with 40 μm cell strainers placed on new 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant and resuspend with 300 μL of 5% FACS buffer.\nStaining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nTransfer 150 μL of cell suspension into a 96 v-bottom well plate. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C. Resuspend the cells in 200 μL of PBS. Centrifuge again and remove supernatant.\nDilute Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS.\nResuspend the cells with 100 μL Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Kit solution and incubate at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 15 min. The plate should be covered with aluminum foil.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nDilute anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (Fc block) at a dilution of 1:200 with 5% FACS buffer.\nResuspend the cells with 100 μL Fc block solution and incubate the cells on ice for 5 min.\nDuring incubation, make a master mix solution of indicated antibodies (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) in Eppendorf tubes or 15 mL conical tubes, depending on the total volume required.\nAfter incubation with Fc block, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 100 μL of antibody master mix and incubate the cells on ice, in the dark, for 25 min.\nCritical: For the ILC panel, all antibodies except for two antibodies (GATA3 and RORγt) should be added at this step. Anti-GATA3 and -RORγt antibodies will be used in step 39.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cells with 200 μL of 5% FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.",
    "Repeat steps 35 and 36.\nResuspend the cells with 200 μL of 5% FACS buffer. Keep cells stained for keratinocyte and myeloid cell panels on ice until data collection.\nOptional: Cells stained for keratinocyte panel and myeloid panels may be fixed with FluoroFix™ Buffer after step 37 if immediate data collection is not possible.\nFix cells by adding 200 μL of FluoroFix™ Buffer. Incubate the cells at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 200 μL of 5% FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps (c) and (d).\nResuspend the cells with 200 μL of 5% FACS buffer. Keep cells on ice until data collection.\nTo detect transcription factors in the ILC panel, use eBioscience™ Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set.\nFix cells by adding 200 μL of 1× Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization working solution. Incubate the cells at room temperature, in the dark, for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 200 μL of 1× Permeabilization Buffer working solution.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nDuring the centrifuge step, prepare 1× Permeabilization Buffer working solution with 2% normal rat serum.

Keep cells on ice until data collection.\nData collection\nTiming: 2–3 h\nCollect data with LSR ll or LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and analyze by using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). Before acquiring samples, set appropriate PMT voltage and compensation by using compensation beads (Cat# 552845, BD) and a zombie aqua single-stained sample. Note that the compensation beads utilized here are specific for rat and hamster IgGs. If the antibody panels are modified to include antibodies generated in other host species, consider using other compensation bead products. Adjust compensation using the same set of antibodies from each panel."
