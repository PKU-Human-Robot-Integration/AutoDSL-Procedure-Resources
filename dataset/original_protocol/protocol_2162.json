    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDifferentiation and transfection of neurons (2D NSCs-differentiation)\nTiming: 15 days\nAt the beginning of the protocol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), NSCs should exhibit a typical triangular morphology, very short processes, and large cells. As the differentiation protocol progresses, cells begin to clump together, presenting a smaller cell body and longer processes typical of neurons. By day 7 of the neuronal differentiation protocol, phenotypic changes should be detectable by the untrained eye.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. 2D Neuronal differentiation protocol outline\nTimeline for 2D-neuronal differentiation protocol where all the essential steps are marked, from NSCs plate to live cell imaging.\nPlate 3 × 104 NSCs per cm2 in NSCs medium in one well of a 6-well cell culture plate pretreated with 1 mL of 1/100 Geltrex at 1 h at 37°C.\nDay 0: Start neuronal differentiation.\nRemove 2.5 mL of NSCs medium from the well of 6-well plate.\nWash with a 1 mL of warm (37°C) PBS 1×.\nAdd 2.5 mL of Neuronal differentiation medium to the well.\nNote: Neuronal differentiation medium must be warmed at 20°C–25°C and stored the dark at 2°C–8°C.\nCritical: Add medium and buffers through the walls of the well avoiding the detachment of the cells.\nDay 2–4: Change to 2.5 mL of fresh medium every other day.\nDay 6: Re-plate cells.\nRemove 2.5 mL of Neuronal differentiation medium from the well.\nWash with a 1 mL of warm (37°C) DPBS 1× with calcium and magnesium.\nIncubate cells with 500 μL of Accutase 1× for 7 min at 37°C.\nDilute Accutase 1× with 1 mL of DPBS 1× with calcium and magnesium and gently detach and transfer cells into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5- or 10-mL serological plastic pipette.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 200 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nDetermine cell viability after dissociation by Trypan blue exclusion dye assay:\nPrepare a 0.4% solution of Trypan blue in buffered isotonic salt solution, pH 7.2–7.3 (i.e., PBS).\nCentrifuge an aliquot of cell suspension being tested for viability 5 min at 200 × g and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet by pipetting up and down 10 times in 1 mL PBS.\nAdd 0.1 mL of Trypan blue stock solution to 0.1 mL of cell suspension.\nPipette up and down to thoroughly mix the two solutions. Allow mixture to incubate ∼3 min at 20°C–25°C. Cells should be counted within 3–5 min of mixing with Trypan blue, as longer incubation periods will lead to cell death and reduced viability counts.\nLoad a hemocytometer and examine immediately under a microscope at low magnification.\nCount the unstained (viable) and stained (non-viable) cells separately in the hemocytometer.\nPlate 7 × 105 cells per well in a 12-well cell culture plate pretreated with 1 mL Geltrex (1/100) for 1 h at 37°C.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCritical: Cell clumping reduces access to critical nutrients and, as a result, hinders overall cell growth. Gently pipet and thoroughly disaggregate cell clumps, to loosen monolayer into a single cell suspension, avoiding bubbles in the suspension when pipetting.\nDay 8–11: Change Neuronal differentiation medium to 2.5 mL of fresh medium every other day.\nDay 12: Change medium to a 2.5 mL of Neuronal differentiation medium without the addition of antibiotics.\nDay 13: Neuronal transfection of GFP-encoding plasmid with Lipofectamine Stem Transfection Reagent in a 12-well cell culture plate.\nDilute 4 μL of Lipofectamine Stem Transfection Reagent in 50 μL of Neuronal differentiation medium without antibiotics.",
    "Dilute 500 ng of DNA plasmid in 50 μL of Neuronal differentiation medium without antibiotics.\nAdd diluted DNA to the diluted lipofectamine and mix pipetting. Avoid bubble formation.\nIncubate the mix for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the medium from the well, add 900 μL of Neuronal differentiation medium without antibiotics and incubate at 37°C.\nMix gently by pipetting the DNA-lipofectamine complexes and add them to the wells.\nIncubate 12–16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nCritical: The average neuronal transfection efficiency we observed is 0.4%. It is important to work with transfections efficiencies ranging 1% or less, to avoid the presence of overlapping transfected cells and misinterpretation of the results.\nDay 14: Change medium containing lipofectamine with 2.5 mL of fresh Neuronal differentiation medium.\nNote: If high toxicity is observed, change the medium with lipofectamine for fresh medium after 4–6 hours of addition.\nDay 15: GFP expression will typically start around 6 h post-transfection and will reach to a pick at 48–72 h. Add Hoechst (1 μg/mL final concentration) and incubate for 15 min to visualize nuclei.\nCritical: In the case of not using Hoechst as a staining dye for nuclei, it is important to use another type of cell-permeable stain that marks living cells. We do not recommend using DAPI because it stains the nuclei of dead cells.\nVisualize and photograph transfected neurons using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nCritical: You need to confirm that NSCs are correctly differentiated to cells with neuronal phenotype. Perform immunofluorescence staining for neuronal markers such as βIII-tubulin/TUJ-1, Microtubule-associated protein 2/MAP-2 and Microtubule-associated protein 5/MAP-5.

    "Live cell imaging was visualized with an Eclipse TE2000-S inverted microscope (Nikon) using E-Plan 10× and 20× objectives with a long working distance and a super high-pressure mercury lamp. Photographic images were acquired with a Nikon DXN1200F digital camera, which was controlled by the EclipseNet software (version 1.20.0 build 61). Open-source FIJI software was used for processing images (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nOpen FIJI software, a window with different bars and menu should appear (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. FIJI software main parts for image processing\nThe FIJI software interface consists of 4 main parts. A MENU BAR where you can access file, edit, image, process, analyze, window and help submenus. A TOOLS bar where you can find selection shape as rectangle, oval, polygon, freehand, straight, angle, multi-point, wand, text, magnifying glass, scrolling, color picker tools, command finder, developer menu, paintbrush, flood fill, arrow and LUT menu. A STATUS BAR where you see information about TOOLS and FIJI version and finally a SEARCH BAR. For more information access the software page (https://imagej.net/tutorials/[href=https://imagej.net/tutorials/]).\nCalibrate the FIJI software with the measurements in micrometers for the photographs.\nFor this step it is necessary to photograph an element with a known distance with the same objective with which the neuron photographs will be taken (in this case a Neubauer chamber but can be a ruler) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setting photographs scale\n(A) Microphotograph of a Neubauer chamber obtained at the same magnification as the neuron images that will be quantified.\n(B) Access to the menu to set the scale of the photograph.\n(C) Window with scale settings.\n(D) Diagram with the measurements of the counting chamber provided by the manufacturer.\nLoad the Neubauer chamber photograph using the file button in the MENU BAR and then select “Open…” from the sub-menu (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Trace a line using “straight” tool from the TOOL bar between two points (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSelect the Analyze button from MENU BAR and select Set Scale… from the sub-menu (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSet the scale with the known distance in Set scale windows as you can see in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C. In this case we use 50 μm which corresponds to the width of the squares corresponding to the center of the counting chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). It is important to check the “global” box to keep the scale parameters in all the photos that will be uploaded.\nNote: In case the spatial information of the sample is not embedded in the metadata of the photo file. It is important to work with uncompressed file formats such as TIFF to have all the photo information available. This procedure must be done with each photograph captured with different objectives used and with files that have different pixel size (resolution).\nLoad the GFP-transfected neurons and Hoechst-stained nuclei images using the file button in the MENU BAR and then select “Open…” from the sub-menu.\nNote: The differentiation protocol detailed renders a high percentage (almost 100%) of neurons. The neurons display a very different morphology when compared to undifferentiated cells. Thus, only after a thorough observation of each neuron, cells would be included in the analysis. In case of having doubts, the analysis would not consider cells with doubtful morphology.\nUse images showing Hoechst-stained blue nuclei to distinguish the soma of the neurons, and then work with images showing the expression of GFP in transfected cells neurons (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Locating the neuronal soma in neuronal culture\nMicrophotographs of 2D neuronal culture stained with Hoechst (blue) and expressing GFP (green). The bar represents 100 μm.",
    "Mark the area corresponding to the neural body with the polygon selection tool from the TOOLS MENU.\nClick Analyze from MENU BAR and select Measure from the sub-menu.\nA new window would appear with the measurement in μm2 determining the area of the neuronal soma (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Measuring the soma\nOriginal image of a neuron together with the tools used and the result of the measurement of the neuronal body’s area.\nSave this quantification in a file.\nOpen the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin from the Plugin button in MENU BAR to measure the neurites length.\nMark the start and end of the main neurite and end the pathway to observe the length of the prolongation in micrometers (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Measuring the axon and neurites length\n(A–E) Sequence of photographs from (A) to (E) showing step-by-step the measurement of axon and neurites length.\n(F) In section (F), an example of how the results measured by the plugin is shown.\nMark “yes” if the parts are well connected (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nClick the “finish path” button if all the neurite is marked (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D).\nMake the same procedure for secondary neurites (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nYou can see the measurements in the path windows with all the quantification in μm (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F). Save this quantification in a file.",
    "Note: It is possible to save the paths made on the neurites by accessing the \"File\" menu of the SNT plugin and then accessing the \"Save all paths as SWC...\" submenu. This will allow you to save all the traces made. Once these data are saved, to access them you must load the corresponding image in FIJI and open the file with the .swc extension in the SNT plugin from the \"File\" menu option and the \"Load Traces/ (e)SWT\" option. File...\" from the submenu.\n3D NSCs differentiation protocol for the formation of neurospheres (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7])\nTiming: 15 days\nDuring 3D NSCs neuronal differentiation, it would be possible to observe shiny spheres, with abundance of large, healthy cells. After transferring the neurospheres to Geltrex-coated plates neuronal processes emanating from the neurospheres should be observed. The neurospheres remain as clumps and express the neuronal marker TUJ-1.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1746-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. 3D neurospheres differentiation protocol outline\nTimeline for 3D-neuronal differentiation protocol where all the essential steps are marked, from NSCs plate to neurospheres immunostaining.\nIncubate a 96-well conical V bottom plate with Anti-Adherent Rising Solution (30 μL per well) at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nCritical: NSCs cultured in a 6-well plate must be maintained in optimal conditions and good morphology. It is necessary to adapt this protocol according to the cell culture area. All reagents should be warmed at 20°C–25°C before use.\nAlternatives: Alternatively, PrimeSurface 3D culture Ultra-low Attachment plates 96-well, V bottom plates S-BIO technologies #MS-9096VZ can be used.\nRemove the 2.5 mL medium from the well of 6-well plate.\nWash NSCs with 1 mL of warm (37°C) DPBS 1× with calcium and magnesium.\nIncubate NSCs with 500 μL of Accutase 1× for 7 min at 37°C.",
    "Dilute Accutase 1× with 1 mL of DPBS 1× with calcium and magnesium and gently detach and transfer cells into a 15 mL conical tube using a 5- or 10-mL serological plastic pipette.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of NSCs medium and count cell number with your preferred method.\nPlate 8000 NSCs in each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 μL.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate at 200 × g for 5 min.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nRemove NSCs Medium and wash carefully with 150 μL of warm (37°C) DPBS 1× with calcium and magnesium.\nAdd 150 μL of Neuronal differentiation medium.\nChange the medium every other day (1–2 days) by removing 130 μL of medium and placing 130 μL of fresh medium.\nCritical: When removing the medium, tilt the plate at a 45-degree angle toward us and slowly remove it touching the wall of the well without reaching the bottom where the neurosphere is placed. The neurospheres are stressed when are without medium, therefore it is important to leave a small amount so that they are covered (20 μL). Change medium in turns alternating with 37°C incubations (i.e.: if we have a 96-well plate with neurospheres we will change in 24 wells per turn in a total of 4 times). The use of vacuum is not recommended; instead, we used a p200 with a 200 μL tip with a 10 μL tip at its end for greater precision when removing the medium.\nOn day 11 of the neuronal differentiation plate neurospheres into a 48-well cell culture plate pretreated with Geltrex at 37°C for 1 h.",
    "Add 300 μL of Neuronal differentiation medium per well of the 48-well plate and warm at 37°C.\nRemove medium from the 96-well plate and add 50 μL of fresh medium.\nUse a sterile cut P1000 tip to transfer the neurospheres carefully from the 96-well conical V bottom plate to each well of the 48-well cell culture plate without damaging them.\nPlate 1–2 neurospheres per well.\nNote: If 2 co-cultured neurospheres stick together they should be excluded from the analysis, only individual neurosphere must be included.\nChange the medium every other day to a final volume of 400 μL per each well of the 48-well cell culture plate until day 14 of the neuronal differentiation protocol. It is important to leave a small amount of medium.\nCritical: We recommend marking the location where the neurospheres were adhered to the plate with a marker. This allows us to know its location in the well and avoid manipulating the area when changing media or proceeding with the neurospheres staining. The use of vacuum is not recommended; instead, we used a p200 with a 200 μL tip with a 10 μL tip at its end for greater precision when removing the medium.\nNeurospheres immunostaining\nTiming: 2 days\nIt is important to be careful when performing the steps of the technique so that the neurospheres do not detach. For this reason, we recommend placing and removing the solutions slowly and never on the neurosphere but against the walls of the well. All buffers used in this section should contain calcium and magnesium to prevent neurospheres detaching from the plate.\nRemove the 400 μL of Neuronal differentiation medium from each well of 48-well plate.\nWash with 200 μL warm (37°C) DPBS 1× containing magnesium and calcium.",
    "Fix cells with 200 μL Fixation Immunostaining Solution for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPause point: Once neurospheres are fixed, they can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks in 400 μL of Washing Immunostaining Solution per well of 48-well plate. We still recommend performing this technique as soon as possible after fixing.\nWash with 200 μL Washing Immunostaining Solution for 5 min.\nRepeat the previous step twice.\nPermeate for 45 min with 200 μL Permeabilization Immunostaining Solution.\nIncubate with 50 μL Anti-tubulin ꞵ3 (TUJ-1) primary antibody (1:1000 in Permeabilization Immunostaining Solution) 12–16 h at 4°C without agitation or shacking.\nWash with 200 μL Washing Immunostaining Solution for 5 min.\nRepeat the previous step twice.\nIncubate with 50 μL of a secondary antibody recognizing primary antibody heavy chain (Alexa 488, 1:400 in Permeabilization Immunostaining Solution) for 45 min at 20°C–25°C protected from light.\nWash with 200 μL Washing Immunostaining Solution for 5 min.\nRepeat the previous step twice.\nPlace 400 μL of Washing Immunostaining Solution per well of 48-well plate.\nObserve under the fluorescence microscope.\nPause point: This plate can be stored at 4°C protected from light for up to 2 weeks.\nQuantification of 3D NSCs differentiation protocol with FIJI software\nTiming: 1 h\nWe visualized immunostained neurospheres with an Eclipse TE2000-S inverted microscope (Nikon) using a 4× E-Plan objective and a super high-pressure mercury lamp. We adquired photographic images with a Nikon DXN1200F digital camera, which was controlled by the EclipseNet software (version 1.20.0 build 61). We used open-source FIJI software for processing images (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nOpen FIJI software and repeat steps 10 and 11 of “quantification of 2D neuronal NSC-derived differentiation protocol with FIJI software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.2]”.",
