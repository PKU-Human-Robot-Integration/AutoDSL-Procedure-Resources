    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section describes the step-by-step procedure for two different instruments. The basic workflow is modular. It consists of four main sections: instrument setup[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.1], image acquisition[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], data preprocessing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] and FRET analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]. The first three sections are instrument-specific, while the section for FRET analysis is common for both workflows and described at the end of the protocol.\nIn the “instrument setup[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.1]” section, an acquisition protocol containing three spectrally distinct channels (CFP, FRET, YFP) is set up to obtain the corresponding images iCFP, iFRET, iYFP. In the “data preprocessing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]” section, the mean fluorescence values from ROIs in the images (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP) are determined using Fiji macros and stored as fluorescence data tables containing intensities of all channels (SCFP, SFRET, SYFP). The “FRET analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]” section uses the custom Matlab software to calculate Two-Hybrid FRET binding curves from these fluorescence data tables (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nConfocal microscope protocol\nInstrument setup\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how to create an acquisition protocol on the microscope to capture the three images required for the Two-Hybrid assay (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nGenerate an acquisition protocol to capture image stacks in the form (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP). This order is important for data processing.\nCreate a confocal track with 445 nm laser excitation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2884-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setup of FRET acquisition channels (confocal microscope)\n(A) The Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope used for image acquisition.\n(B) The top part of the panel highlighted in blue provides an overview of the Track 1 organization: The CFP channel and the FRET channel are incorporated in Track 1, since both use the 445 nm excitation laser. The wavelength interval in nm used for spectral detection in both channels are set up individually (red square). Both channels are scanned simultaneously in Track 1.",
    "(C) The top part of the panel highlighted in yellow provides an overview of Track 2. The YFP channel is scanned separately in Track 2 with the 514 nm excitation laser (green square). The wavelength interval in nm for the YFP channel is defined as shown.\n(D) Exemplary image settings for image acquisition.\n(E) Histograms from the Dimer D3 sample acquired with the settings shown above.\nWithin this track, define two channels, termed CFP and FRET with the respective spectral properties shown in the blue box and the snapshot in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nCreate a second confocal track with 514 nm laser excitation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nDefine the YFP channel with the respective spectral properties shown in the yellow box and the snapshot in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nSelect an objective with a numerical aperture ≥1 (oil or water immersion).\nAdjust the correction collar to correct the objective to the bottom thickness of the imaging dish.\nMaximize image brightness by slightly adjusting the correction collar further.\nDefine acquisition properties.\nPrepare the dish transfected with the shortest dimer (D3) for imaging.\nAnalyze emission in all three channels using histograms (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nLaser power, PMT voltage gain and pixel dwell time affect image brightness. Adjust these parameters to cover 25%–75% of the histogram for all channels (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nRefer to the CRITICAL note below to optimize the acquisition further. Exemplary settings are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D.\nNote: Adjusting the correction collar improves focus alignment in multi-wavelength image acquisition and minimizes aberration.\nNote: The D3 construct is characterized by the highest FRET efficiency and will yield the highest fluorescence signals. Using this construct to adjust acquisition properties helps to avoid oversaturation of pixels in subsequent measurements that include bright samples with high FRET efficiencies.",
    "Note: High quality imaging is essential for Two-Hybrid FRET. The acquisition settings must be carefully configured to accommodate all samples (protein interaction and calibration samples). Once set, they must not be altered between measurements. The laser power and pixel dwell time influence the number of photons collected. Collecting a higher number of photons improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, increasing these excitation parameters can lead to photo-bleaching. Averaging in the form of scan repeats can increase SNR but also photo-bleaching. Averaging also extends the acquisition time. The PMT gain can enhance data quality by optimizing histogram utilization. Live cell imaging is susceptible to sample movement during the acquisition, particularly when investigating organelles. Track switching should be set to line mode to reduce motion artefacts. Lowering the image resolution reduces the acquisition time. However, this is limited by the required resolution to see the biological system of interest clear enough to draw ROIs. Optimizing the parameters discussed above require finding a compromise. In contrast, the following adjustments should always be implemented: Avoid digital amplification of signals. Do not use a zoom factor lower than 1 to minimize image inhomogeneities. Always use a 16-bit signal depth. Acquisition settings shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B‒3D were suitable for the reference system.\nImage acquisition (confocal microscope)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes the acquisition of image stacks (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP) on the confocal microscope.\nCritical: Do not change acquisition settings during the subsequent data collection process.\nNote: Quantitative FRET methods are sensitive to photo-bleaching of fluorophores. Minimize illumination of cells when selecting a field of view for imaging.\nMeasurement process.\nAcquire a minimum of five fluorescent cells per calibration sample and at least 20 fluorescent cells per protein interaction sample.\nSave images in a lossless image format supported by Fiji’s Bio-Formats importer (∗.czi for Zeiss instruments).",
    "Data preprocessing (confocal microscope)\nTiming: 30 min\nThe following steps describe how the image stacks acquired in the previous section are converted into fluorescence data tables for FRET evaluation.\nCreate fluorescence data tables (SCFP, SFRET, SYFP) from image stacks (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP).\nLoad an image stack from step 4 b into Fiji by dragging the image on the Fiji user interface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2884-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Workflow of data preprocessing (confocal microscope)\n(1.) The confocal image stack (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP) is opened in Fiji by dragging the image file onto the Fiji user interface.\n(2.) The “FRET_ROI” macro (or alternatively the “FRET_Pix” macro, see Note) is opened similarly by dragging the file onto the Fiji user interface. Both the image stack and the macro are now open in the Fiji application. The “Run” button starts the macro (red ellipse).\n(3.) After pressing the “Run” button in step 2, two pop-up windows appear as displayed in step 3. ROIs are drawn in the image and are added to the ROI manager by pressing (t). In this figure, four ROIs were added to the ROI manager (Cytosol 1–4). After adding all ROIs, this step is completed by pressing the “OK” button.\n(4.) The fluorescence data table is generated and can be saved as shown in step 4.\nOptional: Apply a weak Gaussian blur to the image stack (r = 1 px). Click on the drop down menu Process->Filters->Gaussian Blur and set the radius to 1.\nLoad the “FRET_ROI” macro (refer to section “download and install software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]”) by dragging the macro file on the Fiji main window.\nStart the macro by pressing “Run” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 2).\nDraw ROIs in the image stack and press “t” to add them to the ROI manager, (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 3).",
    "Use at least 10 ROIs for each calibration sample and at least 30 ROIs for protein interaction samples.\nPress “OK” to generate data tables.\nSave data tables as comma separated values (∗.csv).\nRepeat this step for all samples from Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. We suggest to use the naming convention from Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nTo increase data abundancy, repeat step 5 for multiple images. Data tables can later be merged in the FRET analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8] software.\nContinue with step 15 in the section “FRET analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]”.\nNote: Applying a Gaussian blur reduces stochastic noise and can improve data processed from small ROIs or when using the “FRET_PIX” macro.\nNote: The FRET_ROI macro generates a mean fluorescence value from all pixels within a ROI for all three channels (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP) and generates .csv data tables containing those fluorescence values (SCFP, SFRET, SYFP) for each row as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 4. An alternative “FRET_PIX” macro computes one data triplet for each pixel within a ROI, thus generating more data points than the “FRET_ROI” macro. The workflow, layout and subsequent calibration results are identical for both macros. We recommend to use the “FRET_PIX” macro for calibration samples instead of the “FRET_ROI” macro to increase data visibility in diagrams.\nNote: Draw ROIs depending on your proteins of interest: For cytosolic proteins of interest and all calibration samples, draw ROIs in cytosolic regions exclusively.\nImaging plate reader (wide-field) protocol\nInstrument setup\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis section describes how to set up an acquisition protocol on the imaging plate reader to capture the three images (iCFP, iFRET, iYFP) required for the Two-Hybrid assay (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nInstall Filter cubes and LEDs corresponding to Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C on your device according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2884-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

This protocol generates the images iCFP, iFRET, iYFP.\nSelect the 20× objective and adjust the correction collar to the bottom thickness of the well plate as described in step 2.\nAdjust instrument specific parameters and take a representative image.\nDefine LED power, illumination time and gain on your device (exemplary settings are displayed in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nIf available, use the laser autofocus option.\nWe recommend using image stitching to capture a larger number of cells per image. A 3 × 3 field allows capturing several hundred cells per acquisition.\nStart imaging the shortest dimer sample (D3). Using the shortest dimer will ensure well balanced acquisition settings for all following measurements.\nAnalyze emission in all three channels and adjust Illumination time and LED power parameters to cover 25%–75% of the histogram in all channels (a representative histogram is displayed in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and applies to wide-field instruments as well).\nAdjust integration time (acquisition time) and illumination power from the presented acquisition settings in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D. Leave the Gain at 0.\nSave the acquisition protocol and acquire a representative image in all three channels.\nCreate a folder on your processing computer called “Training”.\nSave or export one representative image (any channel) into the “Training” folder and label it “TrainingImage” (used for training of classifiers in step 10 and 11).\nSetup of automatic cell detection\nTiming: 30 min",
    "The following steps explain how to train Ilastik classifiers for automatic cell detection.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] The pixel classifier segments an image in cells and background. The object classifier identifies and distinguishes healthy cells from debris and artefacts, acting as a quality control measure.\nWe recommend reading the Ilastik documentation for pixel classification and object classification for background information (https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/[href=https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/]).\nGenerate a pixel classifier.\nStart Ilastik, select “Pixel classification”.\nOpen the training image in the “Training” folder from step 9 i.\nLabel cells and background according to Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A.

Cell prediction confidence is displayed in light yellow shade, background in dark blue.\n(B) Object classification workflow: Dark green objects are user annotated “good” cell shapes, dark red objects are annotated objects that should be excluded (“bad”). Predicted objects are shown in light green and light red. The object classifier builds upon the pixel classification and serves as a quality control to exclude unwanted objects from evaluation.\nPress “Live Update” and test the cell/background prediction. The image should look similar to Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A with faint segmentation of cells (yellow) and background (blue).\nIf the prediction of cells and background is acceptable, save the pixel classifier in the “Training” folder.\nExport the Prediction.h5 file from the pixel classifier project into the “Training” folder.\nGenerate an object classifier.\nStart Ilastik, select “Object classification”.\nLoad the training image and the Prediction.h5 file from the “Training” folder.",
    "Annotate objects according to Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B: Single, healthy cells should be classified as “good”. Cell clusters, dead cells and artefacts should be marked as “bad”. Ordering of the two categories is important, with “good” being the first category and “bad” the second.\nPress “Live Update” to analyze the object prediction. The image should now look similar to Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B, classifying cells in light green and artefacts in light red.\nIf the prediction is acceptable, save the object classifier in the “Training” folder.\nVerify that the “Training” folder contains the training image, the pixel classifier, the pixel prediction map (.h5) and the object classifier.\nCritical: The TrainingImage, trained PIXEL_classifier, Prediction.h5 file and the trained OBJECT_classifier need to be saved in the same folder to allow processing by the Fiji macro.

After dragging the Cell_Detect macro into Fiji, the macro window is opening. Press “OK” to start the macro (red ellipse).\n(2.) Click on “Browse” beside the corresponding image dialogs and select images of the corresponding channels from one sample. Load the pixel- and object-classifier from step 10 and 11 into the corresponding fields. The images are converted to a hyperstack image. Leave the “channel to use for segmentation”-setting on the bottom on “Both”. This will create an additional maximum projection from the CFP and YFP channel from the hyperstack image, which is used for the automatic cell detection.\n(3.) The macro segments the image using the pixel classifier and then filters the detected objects according to the object classifier. The remaining objects are converted into ROIs. Mean fluorescence intensities are quantified from these ROIs and listed as tabulated values (SCFP, SFRET, SYFP). Do not click on the images while the macro is computing.\n(4.) The macro will generate a fluorescence data table as shown. Save this data table for each construct and continue with the Two-Hybrid FRET analysis.\nSpecify the files to load in the dialog box (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 2).\nLoad the three images iCFP, iFRET, iYFP from a sample (exclude the background sample) acquired in step 12.\nLoad the classifiers generated during step 10 and 11 in section “setup of automatic cell detection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]”.\nPress “OK” to start the automatic cell detection process.

Expected outcomes: Spectral correction factors and FRET calibration",
    "(A) Determination of spectral correction factors: RA1: Plot of fluorescence in the FRET channel (y-axis) vs. fluorescence in the YFP channel (x-axis). RA1 describes cross excitation of YFP by CFP excitation (FRET/YFP). RD1: Plot of fluorescence in the FRET channel (y-axis) vs. fluorescence in the CFP channel (x-axis). RD1 describes the bleed-through of CFP emission into the FRET emission detection range (FRET/CFP). RD2: Plot of fluorescence in the YFP channel vs. the fluorescence in the CFP channel. RD2 describes cross excitation of CFP from the YFP excitation (YFP/CFP). These spectral correction factors are determined by linear regressions between the specified channels.\n(B) Correlating sensitized emission versus donor quenching displays an affine relationship between these quantities when using dimer constructs. The Gratio corresponds to the slope of a linear regression line, while the Fratio is calculated from the y-axis offset.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n(C) Left: cartoon of the dimer constructs. Right: Plot of FRET efficiencies determined from donor quenching (ED) vs. Afree for the shown dimers. FRET calibration results in stable FRET efficiencies independent of the fluorophore concentration (Afree or Dfree). The plot for sensitized emission (EA) should look similar.
