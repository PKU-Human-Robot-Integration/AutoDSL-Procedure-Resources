    "Preparation of proteoliposomes containing proteinaceous factors such as SecYEG and YidCPlace the phospholipid solution (25 mg/ml in chloroform) in a glass vial. For one reconstitution sample, use 200 μg of phospholipids. Dry phospholipids up under a N2 gas stream until the bulk of chloroform is evaporated, and then place in a freeze-dryer under vacuum for 1 h.Suspend the phospholipids (200 µg/one reconstitution sample) in buffer A (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol) at 10 mg/ml, followed by bath-sonication (about 10 s) to form liposomes until a slightly opaque suspension is obtained.Solubilize liposomes thus prepared in 1.5% [w/v] OG in buffer A by adding 15% [w/v] stock.Mix the solubilized phospholipids (200 µg) with SecYEG (~10 μg) and/or YidC (~10 μg) solubilized in 1.5% [w/v] OG. Adjust the volume to ~100 µl, keeping the OG concentration at 1.5% [w/v]. Incubate the mixture on ice for 20 min.Change the detergents used to solubilize SecYEG and YidC to OG, if they were solubilized in DDM or DPC. Apply the sample to a TALON column, and then wash with buffer containing 1.5% [w/v] OG, followed by elution with buffer containing 100 mM imidazole. In the case of SecYEG, add 40% [w/v] glycerol to the buffer. Keep the DDM/DPC concentration as low as possible.Dialyze the mixture against 500 ml of buffer A at 4 °C for at least 3 h to form proteoliposomes by removing OG. The proteoliposome suspension becomes a bit turbid.Add 0.9 ml of buffer A to the dialyzed sample, followed by recovery of proteoliposomes by centrifugation (170,000 x g, 1 h, 4 °C). Resuspend the pellets in 50 µl of buffer A.Make proteoliposomes unilamellar by freezing (in liquid nitrogen)-thawing (at room temperature)-sonication (~10 s) once. Make sure that the suspension is not heated when it is sonicated.",
    "Store frozen proteoliposomes at -80 °C, if necessary, before thawing and sonication.Preparation of liposomes containing DAGMix phospholipids (1 mg) and DAG (0.05 mg), and dry the lipid mixture up as in Step A1.Suspend the dried residue in buffer A at 10 mg phospholipids/ml, followed by bath-sonication (~10 s).Preparation of liposomes containing DAG and MPIaseMix phospholipids and DAG in chloroform, and dry the mixture up, as described in Step B1. Typically, add DAG at 25% [w/w] to phospholipids.Dissolve the mixture in solvent C (chloroform/ethanol/water = 3/7/4), and then mix with MPIase dissolved in solvent C, typically at 25% [w/w] as to phospholipids.Evaporate solvent C under a N2 stream and then under vacuum.Suspend the dried residue in buffer A at 10 mg phospholipids/ml, followed by bath-sonication (~10 s).Fusion of proteoliposomes with MPIase/DAG-liposomes to incorporate MPIase and DAGMix the proteoliposome suspension obtained in Procedure A with MPIase/DAG-liposomes (Procedure C), typically in the ratio of 4:1, which yields proteoliposomes containing 5% [w/w] DAG and 5% [w/w] MPIase.Repeat the cycle of freezing (in liquid nitrogen)-thawing (at room temperature)-sonication (~10 s) three times to allow liposome fusion. With this way, proteoliposomes containing SecYEG, YidC, and MPIase/DAG can be prepared.Reactions for (3L-)Pf3 coat integration (Figure 1)Translate in vitro the substrate proteins, Pf3 coat and the mutant 3L-Pf3 coat (Kiefer and Kuhn, 1999; Serek et al., 2004), using the Pure System, a reconstituted cell-free system for in vitro translation (Nishiyama et al., 2010; Shimizu et al., 2001). The reaction mixture of the Pure System (20 µl) comprises [35S] methionine (2.5~10 MBq/ml; ~200 nM), plasmid DNA (pT7-3L-Pf3 or pT7-Pf3 [Kawashima et al., 2008; Serek et al., 2004]; ~20 µg/ml), and (proteo)liposomes (0.4 mg phospholipids/ml) (Table 1). When a high level of synthesis is necessary, add cold methionine (0.3 mM) to the mixture.",
    "Under these conditions, a ~200-fold increase in the synthesis level is observed. The Pure System is commercially available from Gene Frontier, but adjust the buffer system customly as described (Nishiyama et al., 2010). To avoid aggregation of proteoliposomes, make sure that the Mg concentration is 9 mM or less, and that PEG and polyamines such as putrescine and spermidine are not contained in the reaction mixtures.Allow the translation/integration reaction at 37 °C for 30 min.Terminate the reaction by chilling on ice for 5 min. Withdraw 3 µl and 15 µl of the mixture (20 µl) into new tubes.Add 3 µl of trichloroacetic acid (10% [w/v]) to an aliquot (3 µl) to precipitate the synthesized proteins.Mix an equal volume of proteinase K (1 mg/ml) with another aliquot (15 µl), and then incubate at 25 °C for 25 min to generate MPF.After proteinase K digestion, add 30 µl of 10% [w/v] trichloroacetic acid, followed by incubation at 56 °C for 5 min to inactivate proteinase K. Incubate on ice for at least 10 min to precipitate MPF.Recover the precipitates (both Steps E4 and E6) by centrifugation (10,000 x g, for 5 min), and then wash them with 100% acetone. After centrifugation (10,000 x g, for 5 min), dry the precipitates up at room temperature for 20~30 min.Solubilize the precipitates in 10 µl of SDS sample loading buffer A, followed by boiling for 3 min. The SDS sample loading buffer A is composed of 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 2.5% [w/v] SDS, 25% [w/v] glycerol, 2.5% [w/v] β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0125% [w/v] bromophenol blue.Apply samples onto SDS-gels containing 6 M urea as described in Nishiyama et al. (2006). The gel is composed of 12.5% [w/v] acrylamide-0.27% [w/v] N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) as described in Hussain et al. (1980).",
    "After electrophoresis, soak the gels in 10% [v/v] acetic acid for 10 min, and then dry them.Expose the gels to the imaging plates in a cassette overnight.Table 1.

Scheme of the assay for (3L-)Pf3 coat integrationReactions for MtlA (mannitol permease) integrationSynthesize MtlA as in E, using pET-MtlA (Kuruma et al., 2005) and the Pure System. Add Ffh (50 µg/ml), FtsY (17 µg/ml), and cold methionine (30 µM) to the reaction mixture.After the translation/integration reaction at 37 °C for 30 min, add 5% [w/v] trichloroacetic acid to an aliquot (9 µl), and digest another aliquot (9 µl) with proteinase K as described in Steps E4-E5. Recover the precipitate as described in Step E5.Solubilize the dried precipitates in 10 µl of SDS sample loading buffer B, followed by boiling for 3 min. The SDS sample loading buffer B is composed of 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3% [w/v] SDS, 10% [w/v] glycerol, 5.5% [w/v] β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% [w/v] bromophenol blue.Load samples onto SDS-gels as described (Laemmli, 1970). The gel is composed of 15% [w/v] acrylamide-0.4% [w/v] N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide).After electrophoresis, soak gels in 10% [v/v] acetic acid for 10 min, and then dry them. Place the gels on the imaging plates."
