    "We will describe the preparation of labeled thymidine solution and the stable isotopes that may be used. The choice of stable isotope label(s) should be carefully considered. Stable isotope distributions are studied by examining isotope ratio images. The sensitivity is the ability to measure a small excess of label over the natural abundance. A high sensitivity is easier to achieve with isotopes of low natural abundances. For example, 15N- or 18O-thymidine (natural abundances 0.36% and 0.20%, respectively) are preferable to 13C-thymidine (1.08% natural abundance).\nMaterials\nStable isotope−labeled thymidine and/or analogs (BrdU, IdU)\nCells or tissues of interest\nPropylene oxide (Polysciences, Cat. No. 00236-1)\nEpoxy, eg. Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences, Cat. No. 08792-1)\n35-mm culture dishes (see step 2, below)\nSi chips (5 mm × 5 mm; see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-prot-0003])\nCentrifuge\nVacuum oven\nEmbedding mold\nFreeze-drying apparatus (see step 4, below)\n1. Preparation of thymidine solution.\nThe solubility of thymidine in water is relatively low (50 mg/ml), giving a maximum concentration of 0.2 M. A useful trick is to prepare the thymidine stock solution directly in the bottle containing the powder received from the supplier.\nWorking concentrations of 15N-thymidine solution will vary depending upon the organ and duration of chase used in the study.\n2. Cell culturing.\nNormal cell culturing protocols may be followed. For MIMS analysis, more than enough cells are produced when seeded in 35-mm culture dishes.\nUse of culture dishes commercially manufactured for optimal cell attachment must be avoided. The surface layer treatment acts as a “sponge” that can retain the stable isotope label after washing steps. If necessary, dishes can be prepared in the lab with attachment factors such as fibronectin. For similar reasons, ultra-low-attachment culture dishes that are treated with a hydrogel must be avoided.",
    "For study of DNA replication, a molecule that is a precursor of DNA (in general thymidine) labeled with a stable isotope is added to the culture during the cell cycle, in the log phase of growth or in the lag phase. One can use serial labeling at different times in the cell cycle in a single experiment by using thymidine tagged with different stable isotopes (2H-thymidine, 13C-thymidine, 15N-thymidine, 18O-thymidine), or thymidine analogs such as BrdU and IdU. All of these are readily available except for 18O-thymidine. Radiolabels such as 3H-thymidine and 14C-thymidine can also be used. The labels incorporated into the replicating DNA will all be identified by the NanoSIMS on the same sample. Note that 2H-thymidine or 3H-thymidine should be used with caution, because even at room temperature substantial exchange with unlabeled hydrogen in cellular water can occur (Pinson, 1952[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0023]).\nCells may be fixed, resin-embedded, and prepared as thin sections, or cultured directly on sterilized Si substrate carriers, freeze dried, and analyzed as whole cells in the NanoSIMS.\n         \nThin-section preparation.\nCells can be prepared as thin sections (as in optical microscopy) but deposited on Si chip supports instead of glass slides. Thin-section preparations are also suitable for high-resolution SEM imaging. Excellent staining procedures for SEM imaging can be found in the literature (Bushong et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0003]; Deerinck et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0006]; Katchalski et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0014]). In general, the heavy elements contained in the stain will not interfere with signals from stable isotopes incorporated in precursor molecules used for MIMS analysis.\n         \nb.Whole mount preparation.",
    "Cells can be cultured directly on the Si chips, freeze dried, and analyzed as whole mounts. The chips must be sterilized before use. As NanoSIMS analysis peels away (sputters) the sample in slices as thin as a few atomic monolayers, it produces successive isotopic image slices through the cell at the same x-y location. By analyzing whole mounts, we can reconstruct mass-resolved 3D images of, for example, DNA distribution within a single nucleus. It does, however, require long durations (days or weeks) of analysis at the NanoSIMS.\n3. Fixation and embedding.\nCultured cells are fixed in situ while adhered to the culture dish and lifted off with propylene oxide to maintain cell structure (trypsinizing cells causes them to lose their original shape).\n         \nAdd sufficient propylene oxide to cover the cells in the culture dish. Cells will detach and float. They should be removed, transferred to a centrifuge tube, and soaked in propylene oxide for 20-30 min. Centrifuge the cells to obtain a tight pellet. Resuspend in propylene oxide and repeat the 20-30 min soak followed by centrifugation to a tight pellet.\nInfiltrate the cell pellet for several hours to overnight (covered) in equal parts epoxy (containing hardener and accelerator) and propylene oxide. The longer the better for embedding. If leaving overnight, place in the refrigerator to prevent the epoxy from becoming too sticky. The next day, let samples warm to room temperature in the hood before embedding.",
    "To embed, warm an appropriate amount of 50/50 epoxy/propylene oxide blend (to make it less viscous) in a 60°C vacuum oven for 10-15 min. Pour the warmed epoxy into a suitable mold. Let the epoxy sit in the oven 5 min before embedding to let air bubbles rise. Immerse infiltrated cell pellet into the epoxy and let sit in a 60°C oven under vacuum until hardened (at least 8 hr).\nChoice of embedding resin is important. For epoxy resins, one has to use a cross-linker for polymerization. These cross-linkers contain nitrogen. This fact has to be taken into account when one needs to measure small increments above the natural 15N/14N ratio. Alternatively, one can use the acrylic resin LR White®, which is hardened without the use of a cross-linker, resulting in a resin with lower nitrogen content.\nIt is also important to avoid cross-linking agents when antibodies are used post fixation. The crosslinking agent may occupy the sites where the antibody would otherwise bind.\nNote that the thickness of the sections should be around 500 nm. The usual 80- to 100-nm-thick histological sections may be analyzed if correlative TEM/MIMS is required, but they will be quickly sputtered in the NanoSIMS.\n4. Whole cells prepared by freeze drying.",
    "Cells cultured directly on Si chips and analyzed as whole mounts are prepared by freeze drying (Peteranderl & Lechene, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0022]; Tang et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0030]). Improper freeze drying can lead to growth of large ice crystals, which can cause morphological cell damage and redistribution of analyte. Thus, samples need to be quenched through the glass transition temperature (−138°C) of water to convert cellular water to vitreous ice. This may be achieved by quenching in solid nitrogen rather than liquid nitrogen, where nitrogen boiling considerably reduces thermal conductivity (solid nitrogen can be obtained by rapidly evaporating liquid nitrogen, for example by pumping liquid nitrogen in a cylindrical Dewar by a high-capacity mechanical pump). Store the samples in liquid nitrogen. At –80°C and above, the samples will be altered by growth of large crystals at the expense of smaller crystals because the sublimation pressure is higher with smaller radii of curvature. For the same reasons, freeze drying should not be performed with usual commercial equipment at –40°C, but at –80°C or below.\nTo suppress condensation from air water vapor, sample transfer should be done under a cloud of nitrogen. The cloud can be obtained by immersing paper laboratory wipes in liquid nitrogen and waving over the samples.",
    "Studies in stem cell research on live animals using MIMS introduce complexities that make defining a single protocol impossible. Each lab will have their own research project, to which each MIMS protocol will have to be tailored. Factors to consider are the length of time the stable isotope DNA precursor (thymidine) is administered, the length of chase period to be used, and the length of the cell cycle in the organ studied and its variation with age of animal. Surrogate parenting may also be useful in certain cases. Along with 15N-thymidine, additional DNA replication markers, 13C-thymidine, 2H-thymidine, 18O-thymidine, BrdU, and IdU, can be given at any time during the experiment.\nIn cell culture, cell cycles may differ in time scales on the order of days. In live animal experiments, the cell cycles in different organs can be different over a time scale of months to years. Cells in the small intestine will turn over every 2-4 days. Cardiomyocytes turn over at a rate of 1%/year in 25-year-old humans (Bergmann et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0002]). This will affect how a MIMS label is best administered to the live animal. For those experiments where the cell cycle is short, the stable isotope–labeled DNA precursor can be administered over a few days by injection (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or via tail veins in rats and mice) and be observed in the stem and daughter cells. Note, however, that injection into muscle can result in inhomogenous temporal distribution of the nucleoside. For experiments where the cell cycle is much longer, delivery of the label using an osmotic pump is more convenient.",
    "The length of chase period will dictate the dose of the labeled DNA precursor required. For example, if the study incorporates a long chase period and the organ of interest has a short cell cycle, higher doses will be required (while remaining below levels that will modify cell cycle) to ensure measurable label in the last generation of cell is achieved.\nExamples of MIMS labeling protocols in mice for stem cell studies in mouse intestinal crypt (Steinhauser et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0029]) and heart (Senyo et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0027]) give specifics on labeled DNA precursor administration modes, durations, and doses.\nThe following examples are only rough guidelines for studying DNA replication in intestinal crypt stem cells. All parameters (primary and secondary DNA marker doses and time sequences, duration of chases) can be varied and adjusted to the organ studied.\nIn this section, we will present considerations relevant to MIMS analysis of samples prepared from animals that have been administered stable isotope precursor molecules (through diet or injections). Note that the use of stable isotopes may require the same administrative permissions as radiolabels.\nMaterials\nMice\nStable isotope−labeled thymidine and/or analogs (BrdU, IdU) or stable isotope−containing diet (always perform a bulk analysis of the food to determine its stable isotope concentration)\nOsmotic minipump\nSi chips (5 mm × 5 mm; see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-prot-0003])\nAdditional reagents and equipment for injection (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0007]) and euthanasia (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0008]) of mice\n1. Examples of labeled nucleotide administration in mice.",
    "We will give specifics of DNA labeling of intestinal cells, which have one of the fastest cell renewal rates in the body. The stable isotope−labeled thymidine concentrations given are at least one order of magnitude below doses used to modify the cell cycle. They are, however, sufficient for detection by NanoSIMS even if diluted by several rounds of DNA replication during chase. For organs such as the brain, heart, and lung—which practically do not renew or have much slower rates of renewal—parameters will have to be adjusted accordingly.\nSpecifics regarding thymidine doses, administration mode and duration, and chase duration are tailored to answer specific questions. The following examples are only rough guidelines for studying DNA replication in intestinal crypt stem cells.\n2. Example of double labeling starting in utero.\n         \nInitiate labeling of the female before conception. Administer 500 µg/day of 15N-labeled thymidine by subcutaneous injection (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0007]). Upon impregnation, administer 20 µg/hr by osmotic minipump for variable time during pregnancy.\nWithin 24 hr of birth, transfer pups to a surrogate mother that has not received any labeled thymidine.\nAfter the desired duration of chase, one may administer 250 µg BrdU to the pups every 6 hr for 24 hr, then euthanize (Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0008]).\n3. Example of triple labeling starting in 4-day old pups.\n         \nBeginning on day 4 of life, administer 15N-thymidine (50 µg/g) subcutaneously every 12 hr for as long as desired. Then, administer BrdU (50 µg/g) subcutaneously every 12 hr for up to more than 10 days.\nProvide a chase period as desired.\nBeginning 24 hr prior to euthanization, administer 250 µg of IdU every 6 hr.\n4. Example of double labeling in adult mice.\n         \nAdminister 15N-thymidine at a dose rate of 20 µg/hr via osmotic minipump for 2 weeks.",
    "Provide a 5-week chase period (can be shorter or longer, as desired).\nAdminister BrdU via a single 250-µg bolus injection, followed by 20 µg/hr delivered by osmotic minipump for 24 hr prior to sacrifice.",

    "Note that Cameca Instruments has recently released (March 2021) a very detailed user manual to all NanoSIMS laboratories describing the use of the NanoSIMS. Here, we provide information gained by the practice of NanoSIMS analysis and MIMS studies of biological samples in general, and DNA replication in particular.\nMaterials\nSpecimens\nNanoSIMS “Harvard” holder (Cameca Instruments, Cat.

Mount the specimens in the NanoSIMS “Harvard” holder.\nIt is imperative to wear laboratory gloves when handling any part that will go into the NanoSIMS analysis chamber.\nIn this section, we describe the mounting of samples in the “Harvard” holder: it can accommodate up to 16, 5 mm × 5−mm Si chip sample supports. It is available from Cameca. Other holders (described in the Cameca manual, section 5.3.3.2.1 “Load”) that accommodate larger-sized Si sample supports, to a maximum of eight, are available from Cameca.\n         \nIn a clean area, for example a laminar flow hood, place a sample holder front face down on clean aluminum foil.\nUsing the fine-tipped forceps, begin placing the Si chips supporting the samples within the insets of the holder windows. Ensure that all four corners of the chip are contacting the inner lip of the inset (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0001]).\nMap the location of the Si chips in the holder windows. A template as in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0002] is very useful.\nCarefully align the holder component with the springs to the component with the samples. Make sure the two screw holes are aligned, and gently push down while tightening the two screws (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0003]).",
    "There should be no gaps between components when fully tightened.\nCarefully examine the front face of the holder. It is imperative that no chips protrude from the holder, in order to protect the objective lens. If there are, disassemble the holder, adjust the positions of the offending chips, and reassemble.\nUntil analysis, place the sample holder in a heated vacuum oven.\nAlways include chip(s) with (i) an unlabeled “control” sample and (ii) dried microdroplets of all stable isotope−containing media (mother solution, growth medium). A patterned Si grid is also helpful to tune the instrument.\nIf one wants to perform MIMS analysis of TEM ultrathin sections, one can use the adapter for the Cameca “Biology” holder (Cameca manual, section 5.3.3.2.1 “Load”), or a resized version can be custom made to fit the “Harvard” holder.\nSamples and sample holders must be perfectly dry in the NanoSIMS analysis chamber. They should be kept above ambient temperature until ready to be loaded (for example in an oven at 50°C) and in storage. They should never be breathed upon during transport to the NanoSIMS.\nNote that once the sample holder is in the NanoSIMS analysis chamber, navigation to specific Si chips and the analysis areas on those chips requires accurate documentation. The next sections describe the minimum documentation required.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7c8e302b-a248-4c19-b9b3-2717006c94ee/cpz1290-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nLoading the “Harvard” 16 window sample holder.

    "2. Acquire low-magnification optical image of the sample holder using a stereomicroscope or other means (tilting the holder slightly may provide more contrast) and differential interference contrast images of each section.\nIt is most useful to have low-magnification optical micrographs of the samples to aid navigation in the NanoSIMS. A low-magnification image using the NanoSIMS CCD camera is not possible, so navigation to the regions of interest in the sample can be time consuming and a waste of valuable instrument time.\n         \nAcquire an image of the entire sample holder (such as the one shown in Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0004]).\nUsing a reflected light microscope with an automated stage, acquire differential interference contrast (DIC) images. Samples are not always stained for SEM, so DIC can provide suitable contrast to identify specific sample locations. Record the stage positions.\nThis will allow location of samples in the NanoSIMS chamber by a coordinates transformation and reduce time spent navigating to the regions of interest, leaving more time for actual analysis. An example of a DIC image of a longitudinal section through mouse intestinal crypt is shown in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ed1557e8-f0f9-428e-b042-f0de2a830419/cpz1290-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nLow-magnification optical micrograph of Harvard holder showing locations of the sections (e.g., white arrows) and a Si grid useful for tuning NanoSIMS (red arrow).

Start Cs source.\nThe procedure for starting the Cs+ source is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.2.1, “Cs+ primary ion source start”).",
    "The source will be ready for use when a stable beam current is obtained, measured off-axis by a Faraday cup (Fcp) before all beam-focusing optics. The method for measuring the Fcp beam current is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.6, “Fcp and Fco beam current checking”). Target values for Cs+ ion currents vary from lab to lab, in general ranging from 20-40 nA. Higher currents will speed up analyses but necessitate more frequent source cleanings and replacement. A high Cs+ ion current (e.g., ∼ 80 nA) is also helpful when operating the NanoSIMS at high spatial resolution, allowing sufficient secondary ion currents to facilitate focusing the Cs+ beam on the sample\n4. Stop Cs source.\nThe procedure for stopping the Cs source is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.3.1 “Cs+ source shutdown and restart”).\nNote that when stopping the source, if the ionizer filament current is turned off first, the Cs will condense on the cold tungsten frit and effectively plug it—sometimes necessitating a change of source.\nNote that we do not stop the source when performing several days of consecutive analyses, but leave it in “Standby” mode where the 8-kV extraction voltage and a reduced heating of the ionizer tip remain applied. This cleans Cs from the tip and speeds up the re-starting and stabilization of the source.\n5. Load sample holder into NanoSIMS 50 airlock.\nAttach holder to shuttle (see Cameca manual, section 9.1.1.1, “Sample mounting”). Load holder/shuttle assembly into the airlock (see Cameca manual section 9.1.1.2, “Sample loading in the airlock). Beware that an incorrectly attached sample may fall inside the NanoSIMS, resulting in at least 2 days recovery time.",
    "Samples can be outgassed using the very hot halogen light source of the NanoSIMS airlock. To avoid burning, it is safer to degas biological samples in a vacuum oven around 50°C at least overnight before loading into the NanoSIMS.\n6. Move sample holder into the NanoSIMS 50L vessel chamber.\nThe process of moving the sample holder to the vessel chamber is described in the Cameca user manual (section 9.1.1.3, “Sample transfer from airlock to vessel chamber). Always ensure that the sample holder is locked, first to the airlock stage, then to the transfer rod.\nWhen the sample is docked into the vessel chamber carousel, retract the transfer rod slowly while observing through the vessel chamber viewport. Indeed, the sample holder may remain attached, but not locked, to the transfer rod and at risk of falling. If this is the case, push the holder forward so that it is fully back on the carousel, and try again to properly retract the transfer rod.\n7. Move sample holder into the NanoSIMS 50L analysis chamber.\nThis process is described in the Cameca user manual (section 9.1.1.4, “Sample transfer from the vessel to the analysis chamber”).\nEnsure that the sample holder is locked in the carousel by the pin on top of the vessel chamber. If the sample is not locked, the sample transfer rod will push the holder off the carousel into the NanoSIMS, causing significant downtime.\n8. Set NanoSIMS 50L stage Z-position\nThe Z-position set for focusing the CCD camera observation is also the focal point for the secondary ion immersion lens (EOS). Adjusting the Z-position of the sample is therefore critical. The procedure is described in the Cameca manual [section 9.1.5.1, “Moving the sample under optical microscope (CCD)].\n9. Measure primary ion beam current impacting the sample.",
    "Measurement of Fcp (see step 3, above) provides a measure of the state of the Cs source. Far more important is the measurement of the primary beam current impinging on the sample (Fco). This value is necessary for ion dose and ion yield calculations. It is a function of several parameters: the value of Fcp, the diameter of the D1 apertures, and the L1 lens voltage. It is measured with a Faraday cup (Fco). The procedure is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.6, “Fcp and Fco beam current checking”).\nMake note of Fco, because it is NOT recorded by the NanoSIMS software.\n10. Record regions of interest (ROI) to be analyzed.\nUse the NanoSIMS camera to locate the ROIs (Cameca manual section 5.3.1.3, “Getting Started”) or apply a coordinate transformation to ROI coordinates selected by other methods, e.g., optical microscopy, DIC, SEM (examples: scope2mims, Cameca manual section 6.2, “Point Logger”).\nAny additional ROIs should be manually saved to the .prs file.\nAfter one has saved the sample location positions and selected an area to be analyzed, an area on the sample needs to be implanted with cesium to begin tuning the instrument.\n11. Implant Cs+ in region near analytical area for tuning the instrument.\nThe overall implantation procedure is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.10, “Pre-implantation”). Pay attention to detector damage prevention.",
    "It is necessary to “implant” or deposit a sufficient amount of Cs onto the surface of the sample to elicit, maximize, and stabilize secondary ion emission. With biological samples, the CN ion count rate is useful for monitoring implantation. Initially, the count rate will increase very slowly with Cs implantation time, followed by a period of exponential growth, and finally reaching a constant rate, typically hundreds of thousands of counts when D1 Aperture 2 (Fco ∼2.5 pA) and Entrance Slit 3 are used. The dose of Cs+ ions required to reach a constant emission of ions is usually between 5 × 1016 and 5 × 1017 ions/cm2. This will be dependent on many parameters including embedding resin, and these dose values should only be used as a rough guide.\n12. Set detector pulse height distributions (PHD).\nSecondary ions are counted using electron multipliers (EMs). An immense advantage of EM detectors is that—when calibrated properly—they are noiseless and allow single ion counting. The design and principles of EM operation are described in Cameca manual section 2.1.4.3 (“Electron Multipliers”).\nThe entire procedure and an example of a proper PHD curve is described in the Cameca manual [section 9.1.12, “Manual EM pulse height distribution (PHD) adjustment”]. Check that the C4X deflector has been properly set (Cameca manual section 9.2.1.4, “Multi-collection”). The PHD should be measured on a sample that has been implanted until the count rate plateaus at a maximum value; this indicates that the sample has been fully implanted.",
    "The distribution of voltage pulses should be centered around 220 mV, and is a function of the voltage gain applied to the EM. This is determined by recording the pulse height distribution (PHD) curve and adjusting the EM voltage gain accordingly. The high number of pulses at very low voltages is due to electronic noise and is filtered out by setting a threshold voltage below which all pulses are discarded from counting. This is usually around 50 mV.\nTo practically measure the PHD's on all detectors, position all movable detectors 2 amu apart from each other at around 450 mm magnet radius. Move to an Si chip and change the magnetic field so that 28Si is measured on detector 1. Measure the PHD and adjust voltage gain and threshold if necessary. Change the magnetic field so that 28Si is measured on detector 2, measure the PHD, and change gain and threshold. Repeat this process for detectors 3-6. The PHD on the fixed detector will need to be set separately. If the fixed detector (described below in step 13, paragraph 4) measures a significantly heavier ion than Si (for example measuring 197Au), the PHD is best measured from a standard sample containing the same ion species.\nAfter calibrating the EMs, all conditions being the same, the count rate should be equivalent among detectors.\nDetector PHDs should be regularly checked or after measuring samples with high count rate.\n13. Gross positioning of the secondary ion detectors.\nIn stem cell studies with MIMS, one can identify replicating/replicated nuclei and can measure the number of divisions by using thymidine labeled with the stable isotopes 13C and/or 15N, and/or thymidine analogs containing 79Br or 81Br (BrdU) and 127I (IdU), which do not naturally occur in DNA.",
    "Detectors can be positioned, for example, to count 12C and 13C to measure incorporation of 13C-thymidine, 12C14N and 12C15N to measure incorporation of 15N- thymidine, and 81Br, and/or 127I for the thymidine analogs. 31P is a useful nuclear marker. Measuring an isotope of Si is helpful to indicate when the sample has been consumed, or the location of any holes in the section. By using a variety of DNA markers, one can study DNA replication serially in the same experiment at time points extending from days to months.\nNote that we analyze the nitrogen isotopes as the CN- ion. The secondary N- ion yield is very poor, and using the CN- ion improves ion yield by several orders of magnitude.\nWith six moveable detectors and one fixed detector, up to seven isotopes can be measured simultaneously in the NanoSIMS 50L. To measure a set of isotopes at the highest mass resolution, one should use the lowest magnetic field that allows the heaviest isotope to be measured on the fixed detector. The remaining isotopes are measured by moving the detectors to their appropriate positions along the magnetic radius.\nThe procedure for positioning the detectors is described below.\n         \nEnsure that multicollection is selected in both tuning and detection modes (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0006], red arrows).\nIn the Tuning/Counting window, enter the heaviest mass (either the value in amu or symbol) into the “Mass” location for detector 7 (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0006], black arrow). This will change the magnetic field to the approximate value required to measure these ions with detector 7 and change the mass values at the current locations of the movable detectors. Note it is not obligatory to use all seven detectors.\nTurn the beam ON (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0006], green arrow).",
    "If you do not see any counts appearing in the fixed detector (detector 7) window, change the magnetic field using the keyboard thumbwheel until counts appear.\nTurn “NMR” on (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0006], brown arrow). This starts the high-precision magnetic field regulation. At this point, you should not change the magnetic field.\nEnter the mass values of the other isotopes into the “Mass” location for the other detectors. This will move the detector to that position. Be careful to avoid possible detector collisions. It may be necessary to perform this step out of numerical detector order.\nIf no counts are observed on detectors 1 to 6 after movement, the fine adjustment arrows (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0006], orange arrows) may be used to move the detectors in small increments until signal is found. This is a trial-and-error process.\nAt this point, you should have counts on all seven detectors.\nNote that the secondary ion column has not yet been aligned, which can greatly enhance count rates.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/13d29af0-652d-4362-9191-e9412e869b42/cpz1290-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nTuning window showing location of multicollection tuning and detection modes (red arrows), mass selection window (e.g., black arrow), beam-on switch (green arrow), NMR regulation switch (brown arrow), and fine detector position (mass) adjustment controls (orange arrows).\n14. Align the secondary column.\nThe goal is to maximize the transmission of the secondary ions to the detectors. The procedure for aligning the secondary column is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.13, “Optimizing mass analyzer transmission”).\nWith biological samples, a faster method is to maximize the 12C14N- secondary ion current (count rate) using the thumbwheels by iteratively adjusting the triad [EOS-Cy-P2/P3] until no further increase in count rate is observed.\n15. Precise positioning of secondary ion detectors.\nThe full procedure is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.14, “Optimizing mass resolving power”).",
    "The HMR spectrum is acquired by scanning the focused secondary ion beam across the slit in front of each EM detector with a pair of voltage plates. This results in a plot of counts as a function of scanning voltage (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0007]). Because the resolving power of the instrument is not infinite, there may be a combination of elemental and molecular ions that are not separated. For example, the mass spectrum at mass 27 (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0007]) shows four plateaus, indicating the presence of three masses not completely separable by the mass resolving power of the instrument. From low to high mass, these are: 12C15N, 13C14N and 13C21H. Note that a greater separation between these mass lines could be achieved by using a narrower exit slit (see Cameca manual section 5.2.2, “EM/FC Detector Panel”), which however may create difficulty in peak stability.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/27e407fb-25d7-4bb9-a931-309496f1305c/cpz1290-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nMass spectrum (HMR) at mass 27. The spectrum shows a plot of detector deflection plate voltage along the abscissa and secondary ion counts along the ordinate. The arrow indicates setting for deflection voltage to measure 12C15N.\n16. Optimizing mass resolving power MRP using the quadrupole lens (Q).\nThe procedure for optimizing the mass resolving power (MRP) with the quadrupole lens (Q) is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.14, “Optimizing mass resolving power”).",
    "The optimum value for Q is dependent upon the magnetic radius. Thus, the best MRP value found by measuring the HMR on detector 7 will not be the same as that measured on detector 1. This discrepancy will be more pronounced the greater the difference in masses between detectors 1 and 7. Thus, Q should be optimized using the mass that requires the highest MRP, or one within a few amu (e.g., optimizing Q for best MRP for 12C15N can be done by optimizing Q using 12C14N). In some cases, a compromise value of Q may be required to span the entire mass range of the experiment.\nThe quadrupole lens has the largest effect on the MRP, but LF4 also has an effect and should be checked in a manner similar to Q. If the MRP still appears poor, the hexapole may also need to be checked. These procedures are described in the Cameca manual (section 9.3.1.3.2, “Secondary tuning in multicollection mode”). You should be able to get an MRP for 12C14N of at least 5000 using entrance slit 3 and aperture slit 1. If this cannot be achieved, it will be impossible to collect good data for mass 12C15N.\n17. Prepare for image acquisition.\nBasic image acquisition is described in the Cameca manual (section 9.1.15, “Basic image acquisition”).\nBefore launching the analysis, several acquisition parameters need to be selected. These are:\n         \nPixel resolution (e.g., 256 × 256, 512 × 512 etc.).\nDwell time per pixel.\nSingle image plane or multiple image planes?",
    "Single-scan images often provide all desired information, and for large fields of view this may be the preferred method. Long single-scan images will, however, be prone to drift effects and be more susceptible to sample charging. Multiple plane images can provide the data required for 3D information and imaging depth profiles, and a means for drift correction.\nThe pixel size of the final image should also be considered. One rule of thumb is that the spot size of the primary ion beam should be approximately twice the pixel size. This way, the tissue section or cell is neither undersampled nor heavily oversampled, which will consume the sample more rapidly with no added benefit.\nRather than randomly selecting a number of planes, the importance of counting statistics in MIMS should be considered. These play a large role in precision, which is given (in %) as 100/√N, where N is the number of counts (in a single pixel or ROI). Thus, in a measurement where the weakest-counting isotope yields 100 counts, one can expect no better than 10% precision in the ratio value. If only small increases in the isotopic ratio values are expected, then the length of the analysis should be sufficient for a precision based on counting statistics, to show that regions are indeed statistically significant in enrichment above the natural ratio value. The data can be processed during acquisition to allow a better judgement of how long it will require to achieve the desired counting statistics.",
    "In a single plane analysis, the Cs primary beam dwells at each pixel address once and the intensities of the selected secondary ions measured by the detectors are stored in a single “.im” file. In multi-plane analysis, this procedure is repeated up to a thousand times, with data from successive planes also stored in the single .im file.\nThe data measured at each secondary ion mass can be displayed as a quantitative image and statistically analyzed.\nWe analyze data from the NanoSIMS using the OpenMIMS plug-in that we developed for ImageJ. A manual describing the general use of OpenMIMS is available at https://usermanual.wiki/Pdf/OpenMimsManual.682350371/help[href=https://usermanual.wiki/Pdf/OpenMimsManual.682350371/help]. Here we will provide additional information using examples from stem cells and DNA replication.\n1. Processing raw NanoSIMS data files into quantitative MIMS images in a study of mouse intestinal stem cells.\nIn the example shown in Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0008], the mouse received 15N-thymidine from day 4 until 8 weeks old [day 4 to 4 weeks, two daily subcutaneous injections (50 μg/g); 4 weeks to 8 weeks, osmotic pump at 20 μg/hr], followed by a chase period of 4 weeks. Prior to harvesting, BrdU was administered for 24 hr (1 mg bolus followed with 20 μg/hr by osmotic pump).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8617dd24-6429-4c02-b63f-1583fcbfa0b5/cpz1290-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8",
    "Processing a .im file from a mouse intestine sample. Mouse was treated with 15N-thymidine from day 4 until 8 weeks old [day 4 to 4 weeks: two daily subcutaneous injections (50 μg/g); 4 weeks to 8 weeks: osmotic pump at 20 μg/hr], followed by a chase period of four weeks. Prior to harvesting, BrdU was administered for 24 hr (1 mg as a bolus followed with 20 μg/hr by osmotic pump). Image field is 30 μm × 30 μm recorded at 512 × 512 pixels. Dwell time is 0.75 ms/pixel. Quantitative image data for seven masses is stored for each plane in an image stack containing 271 total planes. Bar: 5 µm. First image plane for each selected mass in the stack of a multiplane acquisition: (A) 12C (B) 13C (C) 12C14N (D) 12C15N (E) 31P (F) 32S, and (G) 81Br. The image stack (containing 271 planes) is examined for bad images that should be discarded. (H) Example of a good 12C14N image plane; (I) bad 12C14N image plane showing non-uniform intensity distribution; (J) bad 12C14N image plane where top third of image is absent. Inset shows a zoomed image of the Paneth cells, marked by red arrow. (H) Bad 12C14N image with a zoomed image of the Paneth cells in (J) where the lower cell has clearly changed shape. All planes such as these should be removed from the stack of images. A total of 24 bad planes were found and discarded. The image planes for each mass are now summed, providing higher counts at each pixel and better statistical precision. If blurred sum images, such as those in (l) to (r) are observed, it indicates some spatial drift during the acquisition. The drift can be corrected by applying any necessary x-y translation to the images in the stack.",
    "The Autotrack algorithm in OpenMIMS computes and performs the x-y translations, using either the entire image or a selected smaller region of interest containing an object with high contrast (computationally faster). If the pixels in a single plane do not have a high enough count rate, it may be difficult to apply a drift correction and the “Compress” command may be helpful. Its function is to sum a few adjacent planes in the stack. No drift correction will be applied considering that adjacent images will have practically not drifted compared to the entire stack (acquired over several hours). Thus, for a stack of 1000 images and a compression of 10, the new stack will be of 100 images, with ∼10 times more counts per image, and it may then be possible to achieve a good drift correction on the compressed stack. After drift correction, much sharper sum images are observed: (s), 12C sum image; (t), 13C sum image; (u), 12C14N sum image; (v), 12C 15N sum image; (w), 31P sum image; (x), 32S sum image; (y), 81Br sum image.",
    "2. Deriving isotope ratio images.\nDeriving isotope ratios from the quantitative image data obtained by the NanoSIMS allows one to determine regions of the sample, if any, that have incorporated the stable isotopes. As the information content of a grayscale image is poor, we developed a method based on a hue saturation intensity (HSI) transformation of the ratio image, originally conceived by the Tsien lab (Poenie, Alderton, Steinhardt, & Tsien, 1986[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-bib-0024]) for expression and fluorescence data. In an HSI image, the hue codes for the ratio value, and the intensity codes at each hue for the statistical precision. As we will show, HSI images provide a wealth of information at a glance.\nHere, we had administered the DNA precursor thymidine enriched in 15N to mice for intestinal stem cell studies. The HSI images allow one to quickly observe which cells within the intestinal crypt have incorporated 15N into their DNA and how that DNA is distributed within the nuclei, and estimate the number of DNA replications. The process of producing an HSI image is described here and summarized in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0009].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a98a376d-70ca-439a-a384-4090ce5d5b82/cpz1290-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nImages from same mouse experiment described in Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0008]. Bar: 5 µm. (A) 12C14N image; (B) 12C15N image; (C) 12C15N/12C14N ratio image obtained by simple pixel by pixel division of counts. We prefer to display ratio images using a Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) transformation (D) where the hue codes for the ratio value, with the minimum (blue) representing the natural value and the intensity at each hue coding for the statistical precision. Higher intensities reflect areas with higher counting statistics. (E) 12C15N/12C14N HSI ratio image. Two cells within and one outside the crypt are observed to be labeled.\n3. Region of interest (ROI) analysis.",
    "Region of interest (ROI) analysis is performed to extract numerical values of the incorporation of the label into tables for statistical analysis. These regions can be individual cells in a population, subcellular structures in cells, and areas within the ratio image where one visually suspects label incorporation (brightness of un-normalized mass images of the label cannot be used because of matrix effects).\nRegions of interest are recorded within OpenMIMS using the ROI manager (https://github.com/BWHCNI/OpenMIMS/wiki/Manual#roi-manager[href=https://github.com/BWHCNI/OpenMIMS/wiki/Manual#roi-manager]), and the numerical parameters are selected using the tomography window (https://github.com/BWHCNI/OpenMIMS/wiki/Manual#Tomography[href=https://github.com/BWHCNI/OpenMIMS/wiki/Manual#Tomography]).\nAn example of ROI analysis is shown in Figures 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0010]-12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0012]. Twelve regions of interest were drawn around chromosomes, guided by the 31P image (Fig. 10C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0010]). We selected the 12 ROIs shown in Figure 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0010] using the OpenMIMS ROI manager, and from each ROI we extracted the values for: (i) the 12C15N/12C14N ratio (mean and standard deviation), (ii) the Σ12C15N counts/Σ12C14N counts (N/D; Numerator/Denominator), and (iii) the Br counts (mean and standard deviation) using the OpenMIMS tomography window. If there is a discrepancy between the mean of the ratios and the ratio of the sums, it suggests insufficient counting statistics or highly inhomogenous labeling within the ROI. In Figure 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.290#cpz1290-fig-0011], we show the table of output from OpenMIMS.
