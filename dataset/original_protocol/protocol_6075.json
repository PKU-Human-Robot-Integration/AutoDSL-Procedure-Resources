  "procedures": [
    "Human cell culture Obtaining Q-deprived (0Q) human cellsCulture your cells in dialyzed serum medium for at least five doublings. The Q-modification level is expected to decrease by a factor of 2 after each doubling.Generating fully Q-modified (100Q) human cellsAdd queuine hydrochloride solution to the cell culture media at a final concentration of 0.1-1 µM and incubate for at least 12 h.Note: Conditions provided here were verified for HEK293T cells, these need to be optimized separately for each cell line used. RNA extraction (described below)32P-labeling and purification of Northern probesBefore proceeding to the Northern blot analysis, prepare 5’ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes that are complementary to tRNA species of interest. If needed, prepare probes for a tRNA not modified with Q (e.g., tRNAAla) as a negative control.Warning: [γ-32P] ATP is highly radioactive. Follow all safety procedures required in handling radioactive material (e.g., ordering, storage, personal protection, shielding, preventing and detecting contamination etc.). Contact the appropriate lab/department safety inspector for more information, also about available trainings.Oligonucleotide probe sequences for human tRNAs are: (tRNAHis)5’TGCCGTGACTCGGATTCGAACCGAGGTTGCTGCGGCCACAACGCAGAGTACTAACCACTATACGATCACGGC; (tRNAAsn)5’CGTCCCTGGGTGGGCTCGAACCACCAACCTTTCGGTTAACAGCCGAACGCGCTAACCGATTGCGCCACAGAGAC; Oligonucleotides can be ordered from DNA synthesizing company (e.g., IDT, gel purified is good enough).Labeling the oligos with [γ-32P] ATP by T4 PNK reactionUse 20 pmol of each oligo for labeling.Set up the reaction with 1x T4 PNK buffer from the supplier, 6 U/µl T4 PNK, 28 µCi/µl [γ-32P] ATP and add water to the final volume of 10 µl.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a thermoblock.Inactivate T4 PNK by adding 2x gel loading buffer.Gel purification of the probesLoad the samples on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Run the gel at 18 W until the first dye BPB is at the bottom of the gel (typically about 1 h).",
    "Expose the gel to a phosphorimager screen for 1 min (this time can vary depending on the radioactivity of the probes). Based on the signal, excise the bands corresponding to the probe. Incubate crushed gel slices with gel extraction buffer and rotate the mixture at 4 °C overnight on a tube rotator. Precipitation of the probesCentrifuge the samples at maximum speed for 30 min and collect the solution from the gel slices above. Precipitate the DNA using 3 volumes of 100% ethanol at -20 °C for 2 h. Centrifuge the samples at maximum speed for 30 min and remove the supernatant.Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol. Centrifuge the samples at maximum speed for 5 min and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 400 µl of nuclease-free water. Use 1/4 of the prepared probe for each blot (described below).Note: Ideally, fluorescent probes could be used in place of 32P-labeled probes. However, we have not optimized the use of fluorescent probes ourselves. The sensitivity of fluorescent probes at this time can be quite a bit lower than 32P-probes, so more RNA samples might be needed.APB gel separation of total RNATotal RNA extractionExtract total RNA from mammalian cells (e.g., Trizol method, see Reference 6)Note: If using RNA extraction kit, choose one that does not lose small RNAs. Measure the RNA concentration of your samples.Aliquot 5 µg or more of RNA for each analyzed sample. If not available, as low as 1 µg total RNA may be used. Keep the total volume of the RNA sample low, so the whole sample can fit in one lane after adding 2x gel loading buffer (final volume: about 20 µl, Step B2c).Deacylation of RNA to remove amino acids attached to the 3’ end of tRNAsMix the RNA with 100 mM final concentration of Tris-HCl (pH 9.0).",
    "Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a thermoblock. Combine deacylated RNA samples with an equal volume of denaturing 2x gel loading buffer. (Store the samples at -20 °C if needed for future use) APB gelPrepare 10% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% 3-Acrylamidophenylboronic acid (adjust the volumes of the gel solution to the glass plates and gel spacers available in the lab). Pre-run the gel in 1x TAE buffer for 30 min (e.g., at constant 18 W using the electrophoresis apparatus listed in Equipment). Wash the wells of the gel using a syringe and 1x TAE buffer. Load your samples onto the gel. Run gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE buffer at 18 W until the first dye (BPB) reaches the bottom of the gel. Northern blotsGel transferAfter electrophoresis, take apart the glass plates.Put a Hybond-XL membrane on the gel (mark the orientation of the gel).Take the gel off the glass plate and create a “sandwich” as follows (from the bottom): Whatman filter paper-membrane-gel-plastic foil. Transfer RNA onto the membrane using vacuum gel dryer for 2 h at 80 °C.Pre-hybridizationRemove the membrane from the gel using distilled water.Wash the membrane twice for 30 min each in hybridization buffer at room temperature. HybridizationPut the membrane into hybridization tubes of appropriate size (adjusted to the size of your membrane). Add 15 ml of hybridization buffer per one tube. Add 100 µl of the 5’ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe prepared beforehand (described in Procedure A).Incubate and rotate the tubes in a hybridization oven for 16 h at 60 °C. Washing the membrane Remove the hybridization buffer.Wash the membranes twice for 30 min each at 60 °C in a washing solution. Take the membranes out of the tubes and dry them until you don’t see any bubbles from washing solution.",
    "Membrane exposurePut the membranes into a cassette, cover with plastic foil and expose to phosphor screen from 6 to 16 h.Reading the signalUse phosphoimager to scan and quantify the intensity of detected bands with the Imager software. An example of the result is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190313/20190313040859_2221.jpgFigure 2. Q-modification kinetics.
