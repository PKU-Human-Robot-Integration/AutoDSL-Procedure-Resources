    "This protocol is performed in accordance with the recommendations in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Association for research in vision and ophthalmology”.\n1. Egg Handling and Eye collection\nStore white Leghorn eggs at 12-14 °C for no longer than 1 week. If available, use a refrigerated wine cooler to store the fertilized eggs.\n\tNote: Higher store temperatures lead to abnormal development of embryos, while lower temperatures increases mortality. Extended storage time increases both mortality and abnormal development.\nIncubate the eggs in a 37.5 °C and 60% humidified egg incubator with gentle rocking at a frequency of 5 times per 24 hr.\nRemove the incubated eggs from the egg incubator at the desired embryonic age.\n\tNote: The age of the chicken embryo is determined as the time of incubation and is denoted as embryonic days (E) or as stages (st), according to the series of developmental stages described by Hamburger and Hamilton12.\nPlace the selected eggs in the laminar flow hood. Wipe the eggshell with 70% ethanol to avoid contamination of the embryo.\n\tNote: Conduct all procedures under aseptic conditions with sterile solutions http://www.jove.com/science-education/5030/making-solutions-in-the-laboratory\"lutions  and instruments.\nTap the side of the egg firmly against a hard surface to crack open the egg. Place the content in a 100 mm Petri dish. Use a small spoon to transfer the embryo to a 35 mm Petri dish containing pre-warmed (37 °C) 1x PBS to prevent the tissue from drying.\nPlace the 35 mm Petri dish containing the embryonic tissue onto a binocular stereovision dissecting microscope in the laminar flow hood. Decapitate the embryo by pinching the neck with fine forceps and discard the body.",
    "Use fine forceps to make an incision through the mouth, ventral to the eye. Starting at the site of incision, tear open the tissue surrounding the entire eye. Pinch off the optic nerve and remove the intact eye from the eye socket. Collect both the left and right eye from the same embryo for use as either the control or the treated eye.\nUse a small spoon to transfer the eyes to a new 35 mm Petri dish containing pre-warmed (37 °C) 1x PBS.\n2. Preparation of Whole Retinal Explants\nUse fine forceps to remove all tissue around the eye including the scleral anlage.\n\tNote: The tissue will detach easily leaving the retina on the vitreous body and lens with the pigment epithelium intact (Figure 1A-B).\nUse fine forceps to pinch a small incision into the pigment epithelium at the dorsal part of the eye without damaging the neural retina (Figure 1C).\nUse fine forceps to gently tear open the pigment epithelium starting at the site of incision, leaving the lens and the entire retina attached to the vitreous body (Figure 1D). Keep the eye in warm (37 °C) 1x PBS to facilitate the removal of the pigment epithelium.\n\tNote: The pigment epithelium may be difficult to remove, in particular along the ciliary body around the pupil, in the anterior region of the eye, and along the choroid fissure. Therefore, some of the pigment epithelium may be left on the neural retina (Figure 1E-F).\n3. Treatment of Whole Retinal Explants\nElectroporation of whole retinal explants\n\tNote: Electroporation of whole retinal explants can be performed directly after step 2.\n\t\nPrepare culture medium containing 1:1 DMEM:F12 Nutrient mix, 10% FBS, 10 U/ml penicillin streptomycin, 5 µg/ml Insulin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.",
    "Cut off a 1.5 ml disposable plastic cuvette (12.5 mm x 12.5 mm x 45 mm) (or any small container capable of holding 300-400 µl solution) approximately 8 mm from the bottom using a fine-bladed saw.\nDilute the DNA plasmid of choice in 1xDPBS to a final concentration of 0.1 µg/µl.\nTurn on the electroporator and set parameters to 15 V for st20 – st25 (E3-E4) retina and 20 V for st26 – st27 (E5) retina. Set the pulse-repeats to 5 pulses of 50 msec pulse-length with 1 sec intervals. Use a pulse generator that can be controlled by a foot-pedal on the floor as both hands will be needed to hold the electrodes in place.\nConnect two paddle shaped (flat, circular diam. 4 mm) platinum electrodes (Figure 2A) to the output socket on the pulse generator.\n\t\tNote: The platinum electrodes used in this protocol were made by the university workshop. The electrodes were made from 0.1 mm platinum plate “rondelles” (platinum grade: 950 Pt/5 Cu). The connecting 0.8 mm wire was insulated using plastic tubing.\nCarefully transfer the whole retinal explant from step 2.3 to the cuvette (or equivalent small container) using a polyethylene Pasteur pipette with the tip cut off to acquire the right tip-opening size for the retinal explant. Avoid using pipette tips as the retina tends to attach to the plastic and tear apart.\nUse a 100 µl pipette to gently remove the entire 1x PBS surrounding the retinal explant taking care not to touch the retina to avoid tearing.",
    "Add 100 µl plasmid solution to the cuvette to cover the whole retinal explant. Gently push down the retinal explant with forceps if it floats to the top. Use forceps or electrodes to position the lens to face any one side of the cuvette and the optic nerve to the bottom of the cuvette.\nPlace the positive electrode in front of the lens and the negative electrode behind the retina (Figure 2A), without touching the tissue.\nApply the current by pressing down the foot-pedal. Check for bubbles at the electrodes indicating successful discharge.\nUse a 100 µl pipette to remove all the plasmid mix from the cuvette without damaging the retina. The plasmid mix can be reused three to five times.\nFill up the cuvette with pre-warmed (37 °C) 1x PBS. Use forceps to gently detach the retinal explant from the wall of the cuvette. After electroporation the retina is sometimes covered with bubbles, which makes it adhere to the wall of the cuvette.\nUse the polyethylene Pasteur pipette to transfer the whole retinal explant into a 24-well plate containing 1 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) culture medium per well. Incubate one retinal explant per well.\nIncubate the retinal explant at 37 °C on a rotator shaker, with a constant speed of 50 rpm, inside a cell incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 hr. The rotation is to ensure maximum exposure to the medium and to prevent adhesion of the retina to the bottom of the 24-well plate.\nProceed to step 4.\nTreatment of whole retinal explants with chemical reagents\n\tNote: Chemical treatment of whole retinal explants can be performed directly after step 2.\n\t\nPrepare culture medium containing 1:1 DMEM:F12 Nutrient mix, 10% FBS, 10 U/ml penicillin streptomycin, 5 µg/ml Insulin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.",
    "Use a small spoon to transfer the retinal explant from step 2.3 into a 24-well plate containing 1 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) culture medium per well. Incubate one retinal explant per well.\nIncubate the whole retinal explant for 60 min at 37 °C on a rotator shaker, with a constant speed of 50 rpm, inside a cell incubator with 5% CO2 before adding a chemical reagent or vehicle.\nPrepare the chemical solution, for example Cdk1/2 inhibitor III, an inhibitor of M-phase progression13, at a final concentration of 30 µM in DMSO.\nRemove the 24-well plate, containing the whole retinal explant, from the cell incubator. Add 10 µl of the chemical reagent or the vehicle (DMSO) directly to the retinal medium, resulting in a final concentration of 300 nM Cdk1/2 inhibitor III in 0.01% DMSO. Manually rotate the 24-well plate to allow for even distribution of the chemical reagent or vehicle in the solution.\nIncubate the retinal explants at 37 °C on a rotator shaker, with a constant speed of 50 rpm, inside an incubator with 5% CO2 for the desired time (up to 24 hr).\nProceed to step 4.\n4. Fixation and Freezing of Whole Retinal Eexplants\nRemove the 24-well plate containing the treated whole retinal explant from the cell incubator.\nUse a small spoon to transfer the retinal explant to a 24-well plate containing 1 ml/well ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 1xPBS. Incubate on ice for 15 min.\nUse a small spoon to transfer the whole retinal explant to a 24-well plate containing 1 ml/well ice cold 1xPBS to wash the retina. Incubate on ice for 10 min.",
    "Use a small spoon to transfer the whole retinal explant to a 24-well plate containing 1 ml/well ice cold 30% sucrose in 1xPBS. Incubate on ice for 1-3 hr depending on the embryonic day of the retina. For st20 – st25 (E3) retinas, incubate for 1 hr, older retinas need longer incubation time in sucrose.\nUse a small spoon to transfer the whole retinal explant onto a paraffin film containing approximately 500 µl cryostat freezing mounting medium. Remove as much sucrose as possible by gently moving the retinal explant in the freezing medium using the small spoon.\nTransfer the retinal explant to an embedding mold containing freezing medium. Position the eye to facilitate future sectioning. Put the embedding mold containing the whole retinal explant on dry ice until the medium is frozen solid. Store at -80 °C.\nSubscription Required.
