    "1. Endpoint degradation studies with HiBiT CRISPR target proteins in lytic format with optional cell viability fluorescence analysis\nPreparation and plating of mammalian adherent or suspension cell line\n\t\nAdjust the cell density to 2.22 x 105/mL by dilution in appropriate cell media used for passaging and cell growth.\nDispense cells into plates with a minimum of 3 wells per experimental and control condition. Dispense 90 µL (20,000 cells) per well of cell suspension into 96-well white plates. For 384-well format, dispense 36 µL (8,000 cells) per well of cell suspension into 384-well white plates.\nPreparation and addition of compounds\n\t\nPrepare serially diluted PROTAC or degrader test compound plates at 1,000x final concentration in 100% DMSO. Then dilute it to 10x final concentration in the cell culture medium. Add an equal volume of DMSO to the medium, to be used as a no compound DMSO control.\nFor 96-well format add 10 µL of 10x compound and control solutions to 90 µL of cells. For 384-well format add 4 µL of 10x compound and control solutions to 36 µL of cells.\nIncubate the plates in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the desired amount of time or in conditions that are optimal for their growth.\n\t\tNOTE: As this is an endpoint assay, testing of multiple time points will require preparation of separate degradation plates for each time point, as described in above step 1.1.2. Incubation times to detect compound-mediated degradation are highly variable and are also likely dependent on compound concentration. Suggested initial time points would be 6 h and 24 h.\nIf measuring endpoint luminescent detection without the optional cell viability measurement, proceed directly to step 1.3 below. If performing multiplexing with cell viability measurement, proceed to the next section 1.4 below.\nLytic measurement of cells",
    "Immediately prior to HiBiT lytic measurements, prepare 2x lytic detection reagent by adding 20 µL of lytic substrate and 10 µL of LgBiT protein per every 1 mL of the lytic buffer. Prepare enough 2x detection reagent for number of wells to be assayed, including extra volume to account for pipetting error (i.e., number of wells + 10%).\nAdd prepared lytic detection reagent to cells. For 96-well format, add 100 µL of 2x lytic detection reagent to each well containing 100 µL of cells. For 384-well format, add 40 µL of 2x lytic detection reagent to each well containing 40 µL of cells. Mix the plate on a microplate vortex mixer for 10-20 min at 350 rpm.\nMeasure luminescence on a luminometer capable of reading luminescence in a 96- or 384-well plate.\nOptional cell viability multiplexing\n\tNOTE: This step is performed using a commercially available CellTiter-Fluor (CTF) kit (see Table of Materials).\n\t\n30-40 min prior to the desired endpoint measurement, prepare a 6x cell viability detection reagent solution by adding 10 µL of the substrate to 2 mL of the assay Buffer. Prepare enough 6x reagent for each well to be assayed, including extra volume for pipetting error (i.e., number of wells + 10%).\nAdd the prepared reagent to wells. For 96-well format add 20 µL of 6x reagent to each well already containing a 100 µL volume. For 384-well format add 8 µL of 6x reagent to each well containing 40 µL of cells. Mix briefly on a microplate vortex mixer, then incubate the plate for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator.\nAt the desired endpoint of measurement (i.e., 6 or 24 h post treatment, step 1.2.3), measure fluorescence on an instrument capable of reading fluorescence (380-400nmEx/505nmEm) in 96- or 384- well format.",
    "Prepare 2x lytic detection reagent by adding 20 µL of lytic substrate and 10 µL of LgBiT protein per 1 mL of lytic buffer. Prepare enough 2x detection reagent for number of wells to be assayed, including extra volume to account for pipetting error (e.g., number of wells + 10%).\nAdd the prepared lytic detection reagent to wells. For 96-well format add 120 µL of 2x lytic detection reagent to each well already containing a 120 µL volume. For 384-well format add 48 µL of 2x lytic detection reagent to each well already containing a 48 µL volume. Mix the plate on a microplate vortex mixer for 10-20 min.\nMeasure luminescence on a luminometer capable of reading luminescence in 96- or 384- well plates.\nQuantification of degradation and cell viability\n\t\nAverage the relative light units (RLU) from the DMSO control at the measured time point. Use this value as the baseline protein level of the target to calculate fractional degradation by normalizing all other treatments tested at this same time point to this value. For example, if the average RLU for the DMSO control wells at 6 h was 10,000, and the RLU for a given compound treatment at 6 h was 5,000, the fractional degradation would be calculated as 5,000 ÷ 10,000 = 0.5 (Equation 1).\n\t\tEquation 1: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61787/61787equ01.jpg\nDetermine the percentage degradation from Fractional RLU:\n\t\tEquation 2: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61787/61787equ02.jpg\nPlot fractional RLU or % degradation at specific time points to rank the activity of compounds.",
    "Optionally, analyze relative fluoresecence unit (RFU) data for the cell viability assay measurement by comparing the values from all treatments to the DMSO control. If a significant decline in RFU is observed for any treatment relative to the DMSO control, the degradation data can be additionally normalized to the cell viability assay data to determine changes in protein level relative to losses in cell viability.\n2. Real-time kinetic degradation of HiBiT CRISPR target proteins and optional cell viability luminescence assay\nNOTE: The ability to perform kinetic screening and degradation requires LgBiT protein co-expression in the cell, which has been described previously18,19,63. This can be achieved via transient transfection of a LgBiT vector, use of BacMam LgBiT, or by performing HiBiT CRISPR insertion into a LgBiT stable cell line.\nPlating of adherent cell lines.\n\t\nRemove medium from cell flask by aspiration, wash cells with DPBS, dissociate cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, and allow cells to dissociate from the flask bottom. For suspension cell lines, proceed to section 2.2.\nNeutralize trypsin using serum-containing cell culture medium, mix to collect and resuspend cells, and transfer cell suspension to a conical tube.\nSpin down cells at 125 x g for 5 min. Discard the cell culture medium and resuspend in an equal volume of fresh cell culture medium.\nPlate cells into assay plates with a minimum of triplicate wells per experimental and control condition. For 96-well format count to estimate cell density, adjust density to 2 x 105 cells/mL in assay medium and dispense 100 µL (20,000 cells) per well in a 96-well plate. For 384-well format count to estimate cell density, adjust density to 4.44 x 105 cells/mL in the assay medium and dispense 18 µL (8,000 cells) per well.",
    "Incubate plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight or in conditions which are optimal for their growth.\nPlating of suspension cells\n\t\nAdjust cell density to 2.22 x 105 cells/mL in CO2-independent medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x Endurazine (1:100 dilution of the stock reagent).\nPlate cells into assay plates with a minimum of 3 wells per experimental and control condition. For 96-well format dispense 90 µL (20,000 cells) per well. For 384-well format dispense 36 µL (8,000 cells) per well.\n\t\tNOTE: For suspension cell lines which have low signal to background (S:B) luminescence, e.g., when working with CRISPR pools rather than clones, it is possible to increase the luminescence by increasing the number of cells plated, up to 100,000 cells/well in 96-well format, or 40,000 cells/well in 384-well format.\nKinetic degradation assays using HiBiT CRISPR cells expressing LgBiT\n\t\nFor suspension cells already containing Endurazine, which was included at the plating step in 2.2., proceed directly to step 2.3.3. For adherent cell lines prepare Nano-Glo Endurazine solution. For 96-well format, prepare a 1x solution of Endurazine by diluting stock reagent 1:100 into CO2-independent medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For 384-well format, prepare a 2x solution of Endurazine by diluting stock reagent 1:50 into CO2-independent medium supplemented with 10% FBS.\nAdd Endurazine solution to each well of adherent cells. For 96-well format aspirate medium and add 90 µL of 1x Endurazine solution. For 384-well format, add 18 µL of 2x Endurazine solution to 18 µL of cells. Do not aspirate medium as the degradation assay is performed in a 50:50 mixture of culture medium and CO2 independent medium in 384-well format.\nIncubate suspension or adherent cell plates containing Endurazine for 2.5 h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow luminescence to equilibrate.",
    "Prepare a 10x concentration of test PROTAC titration in CO2-independent medium and add 10 µL to each well of 96-well plate or 4 µL for 384-well plate. For compounds with unknown efficacy, a final concentration of 1-10 µM at the highest point is recommended as a starting point.\nCollect kinetic measurements of luminescence in luminometer pre-equilibrated to 37 °C for a period between 0-48 h. The time increments of measurement can be customized for each experiment, but a recommended initial experiment would be luminescence measurements every 5-15 min for 24 h or the desired amount of time.\nOptional cell viability same-well multiplex analysis after final kinetic measurement\n\tNOTE: This assay is performed with a commercially available CellTiter-Glo (CTG) kit (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nEquilibrate CTG reagent to room temperature.\nFollowing degradation measurement at the last time point of the kinetic analysis, add 100 µL (96-well plate) or 40 µL (384-well plate) of the reagent per well of the plate, and mix on a plate shaker at 500-700 rpm (96-well plate) or a microplate vortex mixer (384-well plate) for 5 min.\nIncubate the plate at room temperature for 30 min to allow for cell lysis and quenching of HiBiT signal.\nMeasure total luminescence on a luminometer by following manufacturer’s recommendation.\nQuantification of kinetic degradation profiles\n\t\nUsing the kinetic luminescence measurements collected, normalize the raw RLUs for each PROTAC concentration to the replicate averaged DMSO condition at every time point to account for changes in free furimazine concentration over time. Calculate Fractional RLU using Equation 1.\n\t\tEquation 1: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61787/61787equ01.jpg\nFrom the degradation curves, fit a single-component exponential decay model using Equation 2 to the initial degradation portion of each curve to the point where the data reaches a plateau.",
    "NOTE: It may be helpful to exclude from the fit the first few data points as there may be a brief lag before degradation is observed.\n\t\tEquation 2: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61787/61787equ03.jpg\nFrom Equation 2, determine the parameter ƛ, which represents the degradation rate constant and the Plateau, which represents the lowest amount of protein remaining.\nCalculate Dmax, which is the maximum fractional amount of degraded protein and is calculated as 1-Plateau.\nPlot Dmax for each concentration of PROTAC to determine a time-independent degradation potency curve.\nDetermine the Dmax50 value for the plot in 2.3.5 to analyze efficacy of compounds.\n\t\tNOTE: To determine a DC50 at a specific time point, plot the calculated percent degradation for each concentration at the chosen time. This can be specified as DC50 t=4 h or DC50 t=12 h."
