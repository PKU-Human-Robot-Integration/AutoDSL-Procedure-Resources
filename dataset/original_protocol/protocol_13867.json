    "All animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Maryland Baltimore and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols.\n1. Preparation of the solutions\nNOTE: Prepare solutions in advance. Two types of basic solutions are used in the experiments: (1) physiological saline solutions (PSS) for bath superfusate and (2) Tyrode’s solutions for lumen perfusate. Continuous bubbling with CO2 is needed to maintain the pH of PSS. HEPES-buffered Tyrode’s solution is used in the lumen instead of PSS to avoid bubbles going into the vessels, since bubbles would damage the endothelial cells7 and occlude the flow.\nPSS solution: See the formula and composition of PSS solution in the Table 1. Make 10 L of Ca2+-free and glucose-free PSS stock solution and store at room temperature. 1 h before any procedure, take out 1 L of the stock solution and bubble with 5% CO2 (74% N2 and 21% O2) to keep the pH of solution at ~7.4. Add 1.8 g glucose and 1.8 mL CaCl2 (1 M stock)8.\n\tNOTE: Add Ca2+ only after bubbling when pH is ~7.4, otherwise, Ca2+ will be precipitated.\nTyrode’s solution: See the formula and composition of the Tyrode’s solution in Table 1. Filter the solution (0.22 μm) and stored at 4 °C for future use9.\nTyrode’s solution with BDM (2,3-Butanedione monoxime): Add BDM as a reversible myofilament inhibitor to prevent the contraction of the myocytes10. Weigh 600 mg BDM and add to 200 mL of Tyrode’s solution. Stir the solution with BDM until it is completely dissolved. No further filtration is required.\nStore the Tyrode’s solution containing BDM at 4 °C for future use.\n2. Chamber preparation\nCoat both dissecting chamber and experimental chamber in advance with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.",
    "Fill the dissecting chamber with the Tyrode’s solution containing BDM.\nTurn on the chiller 1 h before the procedure. Set the temperature at 4 °C.\n3. Cannula preparation\nTurn on the micropipette puller. Select the settings as per the manufacturer’s instructions.\nTake a clean borosilicate glass tube (the outer and inner diameter of the glass tubes used was 1.2 mm and 0.69 mm respectively).\nInsert a glass tube into the grooved clamps of a Sutter pipette puller with a U-shaped platinum heating filament.\nActivate the puller to produce two cannulae, each with a long thin tip.\nCut the tip of each cannula using a fine pair of scissors under a dissecting microscope to make the final diameter of the tip around 100 to 150 µm.\nFire polish the tip of the cut cannula to slightly round the sharp edges.\nBend the cannula along the shaft using a platinum wire (heated with fine control) positioned on the side of the shaft approximately 2 mm from tip. The angle of the bend in the cannula should be around 45°.\nInsert the open end of the cannula into the holder of the pressure myograph chamber and tighten the fitting. Connect a 5 mL syringe filled with Tyrode's solution to the other side of the fitting. Connect the cannula to a micromanipulator mounted on the chamber (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).\nFill the cannula with Tyrode’s solution using the syringe (5 mL), flushing it, the tubing and connector of air bubbles.\nPrior to the cannulation procedure, measure the perfusion pressure inside the cannula over a given range of flow (50 to 300 µL/min, Figure 3). Do so only when a new cannula is used.\n\tNOTE: The perfusion pressure inside the cannula is proportional to the flow and is linear fitted (Figure 3).",
    "4. Extraction of mouse heart\nPut a C57BL/6 mouse (either sex, 8-16 weeks old) in the anesthesia box that is connected to the tanks of isoflurane and oxygen.\nTurn on oxygen tank and start the flow of isoflurane. Wait ~5 min until the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nAfter anesthesia is established, take the mouse out of the anesthesia box and inject heparin IP (into the peritoneal cavity, 360 units, 0.5 mL/mouse) to avoid blood clot formation in the vasculature. Then put the mouse back into the anesthesia box.\n10 min after the heparin has been injected, move the mouse to the heated bed in a supine position and stabilize its paws using labeling tape. Keep the mouse under full anesthesia with isoflurane using a nose cone.\nLift the abdominal skin of the mouse above the diaphragm with forceps and use surgical scissors to cut and expose the diaphragm.\nCut the diaphragm and the sternum. Open the chest.\nDissect the heart out of the thoracic cavity, cutting as close as possible to the dorsal thoracic wall.\nPlace the heart into ice-cold Tyrode’s solution containing 30 mM BDM.\nClean the heart to remove the connective tissues such as lung.\nTransfer the heart into the pre-chilled dissecting chamber filled with Tyrode’s solution containing 30 mM BDM.\n5. Preparation and cannulation of septal artery\nTurn on the servo pump. Set the servo pump to “flow” mode. Let it run at high speed until the tubing is filled with the Tyrode's solution that will be used to perfuse the vascular lumen. Make sure there are no bubbles in the tubing. Then lower the speed.\nPin the heart onto the PDMS, avoiding any damage to the middle area of the heart.",
    "Remove both the right and left atria. Cut open the right ventricle and remove the right ventricular free wall using a dissecting microscope.\nExpose and identify the septal artery. Place a nylon thread (30 µm diameter) under the septal artery and tie a loose knot for future use.\n\tNOTE: The septal artery can be easily identified using a dissecting microscope. The septal artery is a major artery on the septum originating from the right coronary artery in most cases.\nRemove the left ventricular free wall using fine scissors.\nTransfer the papillary muscle preparation into the experimental chamber in which the cannula was positioned. The chamber is filled with Tyrode’s solution containing BDM. The bottom of this chamber is coated with a thin (~2 mm) layer of PDMS.\nAdjust the position of the cannula (using the micromanipulator) to enable cannulation of the septal artery. Tighten the knot.\nSecure the papillary muscle using small pins to the chamber floor so that the microscope objective has a clear view of the vasculature. Pay attention to the angle and the position of the cannula and ensure that the tip of the cannula is paralleled to the arterial wall.\nTest cannulation by gradually expelling the solution from the syringe through the cannula. If all elements function properly, residual blood in the papillary muscle will exit the tissue at the beginning of this process and only Tyrode's solution will be seen later.\n6. Stabilization of the preparation\nTurn on the peristaltic pump that will provide the superfusion solution. Then constantly superfuse the preparation in the bath with pre-gassed PSS at the rate of 3-4 mL/min.\nTurn on the temperature controller for the superfusion solution. Adjust the temperature of the bath superfusate to ~35-37 °C.",
    "Connect the cannula to the servo pump. Read the pressure displayed on the pressure servo controller.\nMonitor the flow and pressure. The flow (µL/min) and arterial perfusion pressure (mm Hg) is digitized using digitizer and recorded using an associated software (Figure 2).\nAdjust the flow to set the pressure ~10 mmHg and let it run for ~10 min.\nIncrease the flow of the luminal solution to make the pressure of artery ~60 mmHg. Obtain the final perfusion pressure of the arteriole itself by subtracting the pressure drop of the cannula (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: If the “pressure” mode on pressure servo controller is selected, the luminal pressure is set ~60 mmHg for these experiments. Then monitor the change of the flow.\nLet the sample stabilize for ~30-60 min by monitoring the flow and/or pressure levels. A gradual increase of arterial pressure is normally observed at the beginning of the perfusion after cannulation. A new steady state will get establish by itself in about 30 min (Figure 4).\nInitiate an experiment after the perfusion pressure is stabilized (at constant flow).\n7. Loading the preparation with fluorescently tagged wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA)\nPrepare Tyrode's solution containing Alexa-Fluor-488 conjugated WGA by adding 100 μg of conjugated WGA into 5 mL of Tyrode's solution.\nCarefully switch the perfusate from normal Tyrode's solution to one containing fluorescently tagged WGA. It is important to carefully switch the perfusate so that no bubbles are introduced.\nAfter ~30 min of WGA perfusion or when WGA solution is about to run out, change the perfusate back to normal Tyrode’s solution.\n8. Confocal imaging of arterioles and capillaries\nTurn on the Nipkow disk confocal microscope system.\nUse the microscope to locate the septal artery using a low power objective (4x) in transmitted light mode.",
    "NOTE: Septal artery can be located by following the position of the cannula.\nStart confocal imaging with the spinning disk confocal and choose 488 nm excitation laser, 40x objective magnification and adjust the laser intensity and the sampling rate (10 - 500 ms per image).\nSet up top and bottom imaging positions for the confocal microscope to define the imaging range and enter the parameters for the z-stack imaging.\nSet the step size as recommended for the system that is being used or set the step size as desired.\nChoose the z-stack setting and/or time series settings.\nSelect or set a new folder to store the new image.\nClick “Run” to start recording imaging for future analysis (Figure 5).\n9. Example vasodilator experiment: pinacidil-induced vasodilation (Video 1).\nPrepare pinacidil stock solution (100 mM in DMSO) and stored at 4 °C.\nPrepare 10 mL of Tyrode’s solution. Add 10 µL of pinacidil stock solution to make the final concentration of pinacidil 100 µM.\nImage the papillary muscle at low magnification (4x objective) to include the septal artery and the branch arterioles.\nSwitch luminal solution to the pinacidil containing solution.\n10. Example blood flow control experiments: vasoconstrictor-induced arterial perfusion pressure increase at constant flow (Figure 6)\nPrepare endothelin-1 (ET-1) stock solution (10 µM) and stored at -20 °C.\nPrepare 10 mL of Tyrode’s solution. Add 10 µL of ET-1 stock solution (10 µM) to make the final concentration of ET-1 10 nM.\nRecord the luminal pressure with constant flow and image the papillary muscle.\nSwitch luminal solution to the ET-1 containing solution.\n11. Example images of capillary with pericytes (Figure 7)\nSacrifice an NG2DsRedBAC transgenic mouse as described in section 4 of this protocol.\nExtract the heart, cannulate the septal artery and load the sample with Alexa-Fluor-488 conjugated WGA following protocols 5-7.",
    "Image the papillary muscle at 488 nm and 560 nm excitation, and 510-525 nm, 575-625 nm emission using confocal. The arteriole pressure will be around 40 mmHg.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
