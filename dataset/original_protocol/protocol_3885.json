    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol is divided into four main sections.\nCell seeding\nTiming: ∼24–30 h\nApproximately 2 × 105 HeLa cells in 2 mL of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) are seeded in a confocal glass bottom dish (recommended glass thickness: 0.13–0.16 mm) and allowed to attach for 20–24 h (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nHeLa cells are cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence of antibiotics. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with low glucose can also be used for the culture of HeLa cells.\nNote: We suggest that cell confluency in each dish should reach at least 70% at 24 h post-seeding. A low cell confluency may be insufficient for this experiment. Seeding with low cell numbers is recommended if you plan to culture for several days before use. Dishes seeded with higher cell numbers will be ready earlier for use. Standard HeLa cell culture guidelines often indicate to use media supplemented with antibiotics to prevent cell contamination. As previously reported, however, antibiotics can affect gene expression and regulation, so culture of HeLa cells without antibiotics is recommended for this experiment (Ryu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Please stick to the time of trypsinization to avoid generation of clumping cells, which inhibit even distribution of cells in the dish.\nOptional: For studies using siRNA knockdown or overexpression of genes of interest, cells should be seeded using at least 1.2 × 105–1.8 × 105 cells in each confocal dish and then allowed to attach for 24 h prior to transfection.\nTreatment with inhibitors\nTiming: 12 h\nFor pretreatment with Tubacin, dilute Tubacin to a final concentration of 10 μM in 2 mL of MEM supplemented with 10% FBS (MEM-Tubacin).\nChange to medium with MEM-Tubacin.",
    "Further incubate cells for 12 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nTo treat the cells with inhibitors, dilute inhibitors in 2 mL of MEM-Tubacin (MEM-Tubacin/inhibitor).\nDilute MG132 to a final concentration of 5 μM, MLN4924 to a final concentration of 3 μM, or use a combination of MG132 and MLN4924 in 2 mL of MEM-Tubacin.\nCritical: Care should be taken to avoid freeze-thaw cycles of inhibitors (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nRemove the media from dishes.\nChange to medium with MEM-Tubacin/inhibitors.\nIncubate inhibitor-treated cells for 12 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nNote: For dilution of inhibitors, culture media supplemented with 10% FBS in the absence of antibiotics should be used. All inhibitors used in this protocol were dissolved in DMSO. In the experiment treating with inhibitors, the same volume of DMSO should be used for the negative control. Cells should be passage at least once after thaw and the use of low-passage cells is recommended.\nImmunostaining of endogenous proteins\nTiming: ∼2 days\nThis section describes the immunostaining method for the endogenous proteins. This is a critical step in the observation of ALBs using confocal microscopy and quantification of cells containing ALBs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/827-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Immunofluorescence imaging of endogenous NEDD8 and HDAC6 in HeLa cells\n(A) HeLa cells were treated with 10 μM Tubacin for 12 h, followed by treatment with each reagent for 12 h. The cells were fixed and stained with anti-NEDD8 and anti-HDAC6 antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Scale bars, 10 μm.\nFigure adapted from (Kim et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\n(B) The cells containing ALBs in (A) were quantified as indicated. + sign denotes positive cells showing ALB formation with indicated markers. Data represent mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. ∗∗∗P ≤ 0.01.\nFigure adapted from (Kim et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",
    "Note: In our study, we used anti-NEDD8 and anti-HDAC6 antibodies to detect stress-induced ALBs.\nAfter a 12 h treatment of cells with inhibitors, carefully remove the medium from dishes.\nWash cells once with 1× PBS at 25°C and remove the residual PBS.\nFix the cells with 1 mL of 4% PFA for 15 min at 25°C.\nAfter 15 min of fixation, wash the cells three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nPause point: Cells fixed in PFA can be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C up to 1 week for the next step.\nAdd 1 mL of permeabilization buffer to the cells for 15 min at 25°C to permeabilize the cell membrane.\nNote: Methanol fixation method can be alternatively used for this permeabilization step. Other cell fixation methods were not tested in this protocol.\nAdd 1 mL of blocking buffer for 30 min at 25°C to block non-specific binding of the antibody.\nDuring blocking, dilute primary antibodies in blocking buffer.\nDilute the NEDD8 and HDAC6 antibodies at a ratio of 1:500 in blocking buffer.\nMix the diluted antibodies by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nAfter the 30 min blocking period, remove the blocking buffer from the dishes and then wash cells once with 1 × PBS to remove residual blocking buffer.\nAdd 100 μL of the diluted primary antibody solution to the cells and cover with both clear wrap and foil to prevent drying of the antibody solution.\nDishes are then left stationary for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nAfter incubation, wash cells three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nDilute the Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies at a ratio of 1:500 using blocking buffer.\nMix the diluted secondary antibodies by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.",
    "Add 100 μL of the diluted secondary antibodies solution to the cells.\nIncubation should be performed in the dark. Cover the dishes with a foil to protect them from light and prevent photobleaching.\nIncubate for 1–2 h at 25°C.\nNote: Incubation time should not exceed 2 h.\nWash cells three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nDilute DAPI in 1× PBS to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL, from a stock solution of 1 mg/mL.\nAdd 200 μL of diluted DAPI solution.\nIncubate for 15–30 min at 25°C.\nWash cells three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nRemove the PBS from dishes.\nAdd 50 μL of mounting solution.\nCover the cells with a 12-mm cover glass.\nNote: A large volume of the mounting solution will help to avoid bubble formation in step 32.\nPause point: Stained cells can be stored at 4°C up to 1 week for the next step.\nImmunofluorescence imaging\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis section describes the visualization of stained cells to analyze endogenous proteins. All images are acquired by confocal microscopy. To use NIS-Element AR software, researchers need to refer to the manufacturer’s manual for the Nikon A1R instrument.\nThe samples are observed using a confocal microscope equipped with a 60× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective in a 35 mm chamber.\nThe channel is set to 546-nm laser, 647-nm laser, and DAPI using NIS-Element AR software.\nAdjust the pinhole, laser power, PMT gain (HV), and offset.\nFor this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: pinhole to 1.2 A.U., laser power to at least “5.0,” PMT gain (HV) to “100–120,” and offset to “−20.”\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using NIS-Element AR software to adjust their intensity.\nScan field cells stained with DAPI.",
    "Capture images of at least 5 fields for quantification of ALB-containing cells.\nAcquired images are saved as “.nd2” files and can be opened using NIS-Element AR software. Images can then be exported to the Tagged image file format.\nPause point: Quantification of ALBs can be performed at any time."
