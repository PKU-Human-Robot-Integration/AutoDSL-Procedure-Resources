Briefly, aliquots 15 μg of cDNA was diluted in 150 μL of H2O. 1,500 μL of DMEM (w/o FBS) + 150 μL of PolyFect was added to the diluted cDNA. After 8 min, 5,900 μL of DMEM (with FBS) was added.\n24 h after transfection, the DMEM media was changed with 15 mL of fresh DMEM media with 5 mM Sodium butyrate (NaB) at 37°C for 24 h to enhance protein expression.\nCrude membrane purification.\nHEK293 cells were first trypsinized (0.0025% Trypsin for 5 min at 37°C and neutralized with HEK293 medium) and centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g. Then the cell pellet was re-suspended in 20 mL of Cell Lysis Buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 and 1 mM EDTA) plus protease inhibitors (1 tablet in 50 mL of cell lysis buffer). Cells were lysed using a cell disruptor (10,000 psi, 4°C for 5 min).\nAlternatives: other methods for cell disruption include sonication and the use of a French press.\nUnlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,900 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.\nCrude membranes were isolated from the resulting supernatant after a 1 h spin at 45,000 rpm for 60 min at 4°C.",
    "The crude membrane pellet was re-suspended in 250 μL of re-suspension buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM EGTA) using a 18 gauge needle (∼20 times on ice). The solution was then passed through a 27-gauge needle (∼20 times on ice).\nThe total protein concentrations of the crude membranes were quantified using Nanodrop (expected concentration ∼7–9 mg/mL).\nAlternatives: the total protein concentration could also be measured using the Bradford or BCA kit assay.\nMembranes were aliquoted (∼20 μg in ∼20 μL) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C.\nSpecific photolabeling of CFTR with VX-770-biot\nWe employed the photoaffinity probe (VX-770-DIAZ, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) modified with a biotin group (VX-770-BIOT, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) to enable confirmation of efficient and specific labeling of CFTR in its native environment, the cellular membrane. The biotin tag can be employed to enrich labeled CFTR after solubilization by virtue of its affinity to a mono-avidin column. Specific labeling with the VX-770-BIOT probe can be confirmed by competition with the parental drug molecule (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1543-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Major steps for confirming specific photolabeling of CFTR with VX-770-BIOT\nLabeling of CFTR in cellular membranes using VX-770-BIOT.\nTiming: ∼10 h\nTake 3 aliquots of crude membrane stocks (∼20 μL) and thaw in ice. Then add up to 50 μL of the re-suspension buffer plus cocktail of protease inhibitors (100× stock , this mixture contains individual components including Aprotinin, Bestatin, E-64, Leupeptin, Pepstatin A, AEBSF which inhibit serine, cysteine and acid proteases, and aminopeptidases).\nAdd DMSO, 10 μM of VX-770 (control) or 0.1 μM of VX-770-Biot (photoaffinity labeling probe stock solution in DMSO) and keep in ice for 20 min, minimizing exposure to light as much as possible. The VX-770 as control, should be used at high concentration for competition studies.",
    "Transfer the samples to 96 well plate (black sided, clear bottom, Corning) and keep on top of ice. If not accessible, the black sided plates are not required and clear sided plates can be employed.\nExpose the samples to UV lamp (30–50 mW cm-2) for 15 min on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1543-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Exposure of sample to UV lamp in 96 well plate (black, clear bottom) on top of ice\nPull down the biotinylated protein and elution.\nAfter exposure of the samples to UV light, add 100 μL of RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitor to each well and transfer back the samples to the 1.5 mL microeppendorf tube. After UV irradiation, it is no longer necessary to protect the samples from ambient light.\nCritical: be sure to wash the well two more times with another 100 μL of RIPA buffer and transfer everything to the 1.5 mL microeppendorf tube (total final volume ∼350 μL.\nShake the samples using a tube shaker for 20–30 min in the cold room (4°C).\nAlternatives: any other shakers (i.e., rocker or rotator shaker) can be used.\nTo wash the monomeric avidin agarose beads, transfer to the Eppendorf tube and add 300 μL of RIPA buffer (without Protease Inhibitors). Hand shake 5 times and centrifuge at 19,000 × g for 30 s. Then remove the supernatant and wash the beads adding 300 μL of RIPA plus PI twice.\nTransfer the samples to the Eppendorf tubes containing the washed monomeric avidin agarose beads. Shake the samples, using a tube shaker, at 21°C–25°C for 1 h.\nAlternatives: any other shakers (i.e., rocker or rotator shaker) can be used.",
    "Centrifuge the samples at 19,000 × g for 1 min, transfer the supernatant to the new 1.5 mL micro-Eppendorf tubes and keep in ice or cold room. These samples constitute “unbound” CFTR protein. Previous studies showed that the abundance of CFTR in “unbound” sample was consistently less than that in the “preloaded” sample, i.e., that sample tested before application to beads. CFTR protein is susceptible to being degraded and/or aggregated and this property likely accounts for its loss during these pull-down studies.\nAdd 250 μL of RIPA buffer + PI and wash the agarose beads 3 times.\nAdd 350 μL of Elution buffer (ThermoFisher kit, Cat# 20227) and linear shaking the samples at 21°C–25°C for 20 min. Any tube, rocker or rotator shaker can be employed.\nCentrifuge the samples at 19,000 × g for 1 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to concentrator tubes (30 kDa centrifugal filter unit with ultracel-30 membrane, Millipore) and centrifuge the samples at 19,000 × g for 7 min.\nCritical: The final amount of the samples should be ∼30 μL. Therefore, centrifuge until you have that volume.\nFlip down the centrifugal filter to a new Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30 s.\nAdd 6 μL of the 5× Laemmli buffer to each of the samples and analyze by SDS-PAGE on a 6% gel for full-length CFTR in running buffer at 150 V for ∼1.5 h. Good laboratory practice includes the addition of positive and negative controls for subsequent CFTR immunoblotting. A positive control includes lysate from HEK-293 cells transfected with CFTR cDNA and untransfected cells, the negative control.\nImmunoblotting for CFTR in flow-through and eluate from mono-avidin affinity column.\nTiming: 2 days\nAfter electrophoresis, proteins are transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 h in a Transfer buffer.",
    "Incubate the nitrocellulose membrane (blot) with 5% milk in T-PBS for 1 h. Then cut the blot in two parts around 110 kDa. Incubate the top part (130–250 kDa) with human NBD2-CFTR-specific murine mAb 596 (1:5.000). For the bottom part (75–110 kDa) incubate with human Calnexin-specific rabbit (1:10,000) for overnight at 4°C.\nWash the blots 5 times for 5 min with T-PBS (Phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20).\nIncubate the blots with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP for 1 h at 21°C–25°C. Then wash the blots 5 times for 5 min with T-PBS.\nDevelop the blots with ECL (Amersham) using the Li-Cor Odyssey Fc (LI-COR Bioscience) in a linear range of exposure (0.5–5 min) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1543-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Immunoblots of labeled Wt-CFTR (bound) and unlabelled Wt-CFTR (unbound)\nLeft panel shows that only CFTR labeled with the photo-label (bearing a biotin) is bound to the mono-avidin matrix.\nAlternatives: the immunoblots can also be exposed using a ChemiDoc Imaging system.\nIdentification of binding site for VX-770 by mass spectrometry\nTiming: 3 days\nThe peptides modified with the VX-770 photo-affinity labeling probe can be identified using mass spectrometric analysis. Following electrophoresis, the gel is stained by Coomassie Blue, the band corresponding to the 130–180 kD, the MW of CFTR is excised, and the proteins are in-gel digested with trypsin. The peptides obtained from CFTR labeled with VX-770-DIAZ are analyzed by nano-LC-MS for the detection and identification of the VX-770-modified peptides.\nIn-gel trypsin digestion is performed according to the standard protocol (Borchers et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nThe excised band is cut into approximately 1 × 1 mm pieces.\nGel pieces are destained with alternating washes of freshly prepared 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and 50 mM ABC 50% MeCN (Acetonitrile) until the color is removed.",
    "Following last wash with 50 mM ABC 50% MeCN, the solvent is removed and gel pieces are dried under vacuum in SpeedVac (Labconco) for 30 min–1 h (gel pieces should be easily detachable from the tube wall).\nFreshly prepared trypsin (sequence grade, Promega) solution in 50 mM ABC, at least equal to the gel band volume trypsin solution (for example 100 ul for excised 1 cm2 gel piece of 1 mm thickness) is added to the dried gel pieces and is allowed to soak in (approximate enzyme:protein ratio of 1:10 to 1:5).\nGel pieces are incubated 14–16 h at 37°C with orbital shaking at 450 rpm in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf).\nThe peptides are extracted from the gel by three changes of gel band volume 0.1% formic acid (FA), and one gel volume of each 25%, 50% and 75% MeCN in 0.1% FA (total of 6 extractions).\nThe peptide solution is dried under vacuum in SpeedVac, reconstituted in 0.1% FA and desalted using C18 ZipTip (Sigma).\nElution from the ZipTip is placed into autosampler vial glass insert (Agilent), supplemented with an equal volume of the 0.1% FA and is briefly dried under vacuum in SpeedVac to approximately 20% of the original volume.\nLC-MS analysis of the tryptic peptides:\nThe glass insert with the obtained trypsin digest is placed into a vial and loaded into the autosampler.\nNano-LC-MS analysis was performed with data dependent acquisition using an Easy-nLCTM 1200 System (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer as described (Borchers et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Peptides were pre-concentrated on an AcclaimTMPepMapTM 100 C18 pre-column (3 mm particle size, 75 mm inner diameter × 2 cm length) and separated on an AcclaimTM PepMapTM 100 C18 main column (2 mm particle size, 75 mm inner diameter × 25 cm length) using a 0–50% B 50-min binary gradient (Buffer A: 0.1% FA, buffer B: 84% ACN in 0.1% FA), at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.\nFull MS scans were acquired in positive mode from m/z 350–1,500 at a resolution of 70,000 with an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 1 × 106 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms.\nThe 15 most intense precursor ions (charge states +2 - +4) were isolated with a window of m/z 1.2 and fragmented using a normalized higher-energy collisional dissociation energy of 28, and a dynamic exclusion of 40 s.\nThe MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 17,500, using an AGC target value of 2 × 104 and a maximum injection time of 64 ms.\nLC-MS data processing:\nData are processed using the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software suite (Thermo Scientific) using the Sequest search engine and Percolator validation nodes against the human proteome database using variable modification settings corresponding to the covalent modification with VX-770-DIAZ probe (elemental addition of H19C22F3N2O3, mass addition of 416.1348) at any residue.\nMatched modified peptides are expected to be identified as having VX-770 modifications.\nAdditionally, data can be searched for the specific reporter fragment ions (246.11 and 417.14 m/z) in the MS/MS spectra, corresponding to the moiety of the photo-affinity probe attached to the peptides.\nDetection of low intensity MS1 precursors signals can be additionally improved with BoxCar-type acquisition (Meier et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) over five 200 Da mass ranges."
