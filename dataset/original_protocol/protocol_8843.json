    "NOTE: The following protocol is in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines as approved by the University of Oregon Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Acute Surgery\nAnesthetize the animal with a ketamine-medetomidine cocktail, via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: The mice used in these experiments are generated by crossing a cre-dependent ChR2-eYFP transgenic line10 to interneuron driver lines (Pvalb-iCre11, PV+; Sst-iCre12, SOM+; Cr-iCre12, CR+). Viral delivery of ChR2 or related opsins should work equally well, assuming similar expression levels are obtained.\nBefore beginning surgery, ensure that the animal exhibits no response to a gentle toe pinch. Re-administer anesthetics throughout the experiment as necessary to maintain this depth of anesthesia. If using injectable anesthetics, optionally implant an i.p. catheter for maintenance injections.\nKeep the animal hydrated with saline or lactated Ringer’s solution throughout the experiment (approximately 3 ml/kg/hr), for example by using an appropriately diluted anesthetic cocktail for maintenance injections (Table 1).\nPlace the animal in a stereotaxic or other head-holding apparatus. Ensure that the skull is well-secured. This is essential for maintaining stable single cell recordings.\nApply opthalamic ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness. Maintain body temperature at 36.5-37 °C.\nPerform a cisternal drain for additional recording stability. Using a scalpel blade, remove tissue from the posterior face of the skull to expose the cisterna magna. Make a small nick in the dura to drain the cerebrospinal fluid. Use only the very tip of the blade, and avoid contacting the cerebellum or brain stem.\nUsing the scalpel, perform a small craniotomy (~2 mm2) over the cortical area of interest (for auditory cortex, roughly -2.3 mm posterior of bregma, 4.5 mm lateral of the midline).",
    "Remove the dura and cover the exposed cortex with a layer of warm agarose 0.5 - 1 mm thick (1.5% agarose in saline, 0.9% NaCl; apply at ~37 °C). Keep the agarose moist throughout the experiment by periodically applying several drops of saline.\n2. Recording Set-up\nPrepare a tungsten electrode (7-14 MΩ, 127 μm diameter, 12° tapered tip, epoxy-coated). Superglue the electrode to a glass capillary tube and add heat shrink tubing for grip (Figure 1).\nMount the electrode on a motorized (or hydraulic) micromanipulator, set to travel orthogonal to the cortical surface. Slide a wire ground under the skin, against the skull. Avoid contact with the muscles on the side of the head and the back of the neck as they can generate electromyographic artifacts.\nAmplify the electrical signal using an extracellular ampliﬁer suitable for single-unit recording, preferably equipped with an impedance check mode. Monitor ongoing spiking activity (band pass 300 - 5,000 Hz) with two oscilloscopes and a set of powered speakers. Here, the recorded data is digitized continuously at a sampling rate of 10 kHz; spikes are extracted offline.\nAdvance the electrode through the agarose until the tip reaches the surface of the cortex. Observe this step through a microscope. “Zero” this position on the micromanipulator.\nTo best approximate the depth of recording, visually confirm that the electrode tip exits the cortical surface at a depth of zero when withdrawing the electrode at the end of a penetration.\n\tNOTE: A discrepancy between the manipulator reading and the observed electrode position indicates that it has drifted relative to the tissue. This can be caused by instability of the brain or animal, or manipulator drift.",
    "As an additional check to ensure that this zero set-point corresponds to the surface of the cortex, monitor stimulus-evoked field potentials while advancing through the first several hundred micrometers of tissue. When monitoring field potentials, lower the lower band-pass filter cutoff of the extracellular amplifier to 10 Hz. Confirm that the polarity of the local field potential reverses around a depth of ~100 µm, near the layer I/II border13. This is a reliable reference point for auditory cortex, but it may differ for other cortical areas.\nMount an optical fiber coupled to a blue light source (Figure 2) onto a manual micromanipulator. Using the microscope, position the tip of the fiber as close to the surface of the agarose as possible. Center the beam where the electrode will enter the tissue.\nRegulate the output of the light source with a control unit capable of delivering a TTL (transistor-transistor logic) pulse train of specified width and duration– e.g., an Arduino (Figure 3), a computer I/O card (as shown), or a commercially available pulse generator.\n\t\nMonitor the signal on both oscilloscopes.\nMeasure total light power (mW) at the tip of the optical fiber using a power meter. Use this value to calculate irradiance (mW/mm2) by dividing by the cross-sectional area of the fiber core. Begin with an intensity value in the range of 10 - 15 mW/mm2 and adjust downward if necessary, until artifacts are eliminated.\nCheck for light artifacts with the electrode in the agarose, poised to enter the tissue. Start the search pulse train (e.g., 30 msec light pulses, 500 msec interstimulus interval (ISI)).",
    "Eliminate transient light artifacts (Figure 4) by repositioning the optical fiber relative to the electrode to change the angle of incident light. If artifacts persist, try decreasing the light power. In the rare case that artifacts cannot be completely eliminated (only minimized), extend the duration of the search pulse. This can aid in identifying true neuronal spikes.\n3. Straight PINP-in’\nAdvance the electrode slowly through the brain at a rate of approximately 1 µm/sec. Use one oscilloscope to monitor ongoing activity. On the other, trigger off the laser pulses.\nListen for the faint ‘hash’ of light-evoked spikes on the audio monitor, which indicates that the electrode is approaching a ChR2+ cell and can often be perceived well before the electrical signal is apparent on the oscilloscope. Slow the rate of advance.\n\tNOTE: If the cell lies directly in the path of the electrode, the light-evoked activity will grow larger (and louder). As the electrode approaches a single interneuron, the hash will resolve into small but well-defined spikes of uniform size and shape.\nAs soon as light-evoked spikes are large enough to trigger off of individually on the oscilloscope, begin doing so. Adjust the scaling on the horizontal axis to observe the exact shape of the spike waveform.\nStop and wait for the tissue to settle. Resist the temptation to move the electrode closer to the cell. This step is critical for a stable recording. If after several minutes the signal-to-noise ratio has not improved – that is, the tissue has settled, but it hasn't brought the cell any closer to the tip of the electrode – advance 5 µm further and wait again.",
    "Repeat this process until either the peak or the trough of the action potential can be reliably captured with a voltage threshold set well above the noise floor (e.g., +/-300 µV or greater).\n\t\tNOTE: There’s little risk of false-positives or ambiguity when PINPing inhibitory interneurons. Most cells can easily follow a train of pulses with duration of 30 msec and inter-pulse interval 500 msec, or faster, with a reliable first spike latency of 2-5 msec (Figure 5). The majority of PV+ cells, in particular, can sustain firing for a full 1 sec (Figure 6). Because these are inhibitory neurons, disynaptic (indirect) activation isn’t a major concern.\nWhile recording, monitor ongoing activity on the first oscilloscope. Keep a close eye on the size and shape of spikes using the second oscilloscope. Note the quality of their sound on the speaker.\n\t\nListen attentively for abrupt changes, which indicate that the cell is either drawing too close to the electrode (where it risks being impaled or damaged), or is drifting away. If the spikes become large and distorted, back out; if they grow smaller, advance the electrode. Move slowly in 2 µm steps.\nConfirm the quality of the recording post-hoc by superimposing all spike waveforms, aligned to peak or trough. Vary the voltage threshold. Across a wide range of threshold values, there should only ever be one consistent spike shape of uniform height (Figure 5a).\nIf at any point the signal becomes contaminated with spikes from a neighboring neuron, move on. Advance slowly, on the off-chance that the electrode will pass out of range of the neighboring cell, but remain in range of the target neuron. (This is usually unsuccessful.)",
    "Move the electrode through the entire depth of cortex (900+ µm) in each penetration. If no light-responsive neurons are encountered after many penetrations or, conversely, recordings are routinely contaminated with spikes from neighboring ChR2- cells, try a new electrode.\n\tNOTE: Even within a single batch, the impedance and tip geometry of individual electrodes can vary considerably. Both factors contribute to the effective “listening radius” of the electrode, which must be large enough to detect light-evoked spikes while searching, yet restricted enough to enable recording a single interneuron in isolation.\nTest the impedance of electrodes as desired. To avoid damaging the tissue, do this with the tip of the electrode in the upper part of the agarose layer, well outside the brain. Within the range of 7-14 MΩ, the exact impedance is not a sure predictor of performance, or yield, for this application. That said, it’s a reasonable proxy for listening radius: lower-impedance electrodes pick up more units; higher-impedance, fewer.\nAt the end of the experiment, euthanize the animal by institutionally-approved means, such as anesthetic overdose, or cervical dislocation under a deep plane of anesthesia.\nSubscription Required.
