    "Sample preparationPrepare 10-15 plates with approximately 800-1,000 synchronized L4 worms per 9 cm NGM plate.Wash worms off from plates with 8-10 ml 1x PBS using a 10 ml serological glass pipette and collect worms into a 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge worms at 1,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature. Discard supernatant without disturbing the worm pellet.Repeat Step A2 (washing with 1x PBS) a total of three times or until supernatant is clear. Remove supernatant and leave 1.5-2.0 ml (or just enough volume to cover the worm pellet).Pre-wet a P1000 blue tip by pipetting PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 “up-and-down”. This helps to decrease worms sticking to the wall of the plastic tip.Use this P1000 blue tip and transfer worms to one 2 ml screw cap tube and briefly centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min to sediment the worms. Discard supernatant.Wash worms once with cold 500 μl FTA wash buffer.Add cold FTA sample buffer to the worm pellet in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., 10-15 plates yield about 250 μl of worm pellet).Add 0.5 mm glass beads in a 2:1 ratio by volume.Bead beat samples for 7 cycles of 20 sec at 4 m/sec with 5 min rest in between cycles. Keep the samples on ice whenever possible. Note: This protocol is performed using a bead beater at room temperature. Therefore, it is important to keep the samples on ice whenever possible (e.g., in between the 5 min rest cycles). Transfer supernatant to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.Safe stopping point: Flash freeze samples in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until further use. Measure protein concentration by using the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit.Note: For 10-15 plates of synchronized L4 worms, we find that the protein yield varies between 2-5 mg/ml.",
    "This variability will depend on factors such as the efficiency of the worm synchronization by bleaching (therefore the number of worms per plate to start with), how well the worms were washed off of the plates and transferred to microfuge tubes, etc. Transfer 100 μg of total protein to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and add cold FTA sample buffer to a final volume of 400 μl (final concentration 100 μg/400 μl). For loading control, take 1-5 μg of sample to run separately by a 10 or 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).Add 20 μl 1 M DTT.Boil samples at 98 °C for 5 min.Prepare two dilutions for each sample in new 1.5 ml microfuge tubes:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180925/20180925025800_2100.jpgSetting up the Bio-Dot microfiltration systemSoak two 11.3 x 7.7 cm Bio-Dot/Bio-Dot SF filter papers and one cellulose acetate membrane (cut to similar size) in about 25 ml of FTA wash buffer.Place these on the base of the Bio-Dot Microfiltration System, with the cellulose acetate membrane on top of the filter papers.Roll out any air bubbles using a glass pipette.Place the rubber seal and lid onto the Bio-Dot Microfiltration System, insert and tighten all four screws diagonally so the pressure is evenly spread (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180925/20180925024956_8612.jpgFigure 1. Bio-Dot Microfiltration System with rubber seal and diagonal tightening of the screwsApply vacuum and tighten the screws further. Turn off the vacuum.Using a multi-channel pipette, wash each well of the Bio-Dot Microfiltration System with 100 μl FTA wash buffer and apply full vacuum until the wells are empty.Repeat this step a total of three times.While the vacuum is turned off, turn the T-shaped connector 180° and place a P1000 blue tip on it to apply low vacuum (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180925/20180925025015_8573.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Schematic representation of how to set up the Bio-Dot Microfiltration System to low vacuum Load 100 μl of the undiluted, 5-fold and 25-fold diluted samples to adjacent wells while placing the pipette tip to the side of the well to avoid air bubbles.Apply low vacuum until the wells are empty (should take about 2 to 3 min).Wash the wells three times each with 100 μl FTA wash buffer.Dismantle the apparatus and clean it properly with demineralized water.Immunodetection of protein aggregates on cellulose acetate membraneApply 15 ml of blocking solution (5% milk in 1x PBS-Triton 0.1%) per membrane and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Remove blocking solution, then apply 15 ml of primary antibody diluted in blocking solution (see Table 1 for dilution). Incubate at 4 °C overnight.Wash the membranes three times for 5 min in PBS-Triton 0.1%.Apply 15 ml of secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution (see Table 1) and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.Wash the membranes three times for 5 min in PBS-Triton 0.1%.Place the membranes in a plastic wrap and apply 1 ml of ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent per membrane. Incubate for 1 min.Remove excess liquid and air bubbles and develop."
