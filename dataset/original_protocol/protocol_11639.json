    "1. Preparation of experimental materials\nPrepare oatmeal agar (OMA) by blending oatmeal until it is a fine powder. Add 25 g of oatmeal powder and 15 g of agar to 500 mL of ddH2O, and autoclave on media cycle (alternatively bring to a boil for 20 min). Pour the media into sterile 60 mm Petri dishes.\n\tNOTE: Other media types that induce sporulation, such as V8 agar, are acceptable for this protocol.\nPlate M. oryzae filter stocks directly onto the OMA plates using sterile forceps, and allow them to cover the entire plate (9-12 days). Place the plates in a growth incubator at 25 °C with 12:12 h day:night cycles to help induce sporulation.\n\tNOTE: Some mutants grow more slowly and require additional care (e.g., complete media first, then a transfer to the OMA), and could take an additional week to produce enough conidia.\nDirectly plant barley (Hordeum vulgare Lacey) seeds in a moist growth medium (e.g., soilless potting media) with 10-15 seeds per 6 inch pot. Place the pots in trays with 1-2 in of water.\nSet the barley growth chamber conditions as 22 °C for 12 h (daylight) and 19 °C for 12 h (dark) at 60% relative humidity. Continue to water from the bottom so as not to disturb the seeds.\nGrow the barley until the second leaf stage, approximately for 14 days. Using sterile scissors, cut the barley plant just above the soil line. Using forceps and a razor/scalpel, carefully cut the leaf sheath of the first leaf that is open longitudinally, and using the forceps, remove it from the base of the second leaf.",
    "NOTE: Clean the tools (forceps, scalpel, etc.) before use with 75%-80% ethanol. The sheath is the thin epidermis layer that provides the attachment from the first to the second leaf (second to third leaf, etc.; see Figure 1).\nPlace the first leaf flat in a sterile 60 mm Petri dish, containing a wet paper towel to maintain humidity inside the plate. Using the scalpel, cut the majority of the first leaf away from the sheath, leaving only 0.5 in of the leaf tissue for mounting.\nTape the leaf tissue to the bottom of the Petri plate.\n\tNOTE: The sheath curls, but this is acceptable as a curled sheath holds the conidial droplet more easily.\nCollect 9-12-day-old M. oryzae plates, and add 0.5-2 mL of sterile water to the plates. Using a sterile inoculation loop, gently scrape the mycelia to release the attached conidia. Carefully pipette the conidial suspension into a microcentrifuge tube containing a small piece of cheesecloth to filter out any large pieces of mycelium from the conidial suspension.\n\tNOTE: Spores can be collected as early as 7 days, if growth and sporulation are sufficient to reach the desired spore concentration. Collection can be delayed no more than 14 days if working with a slow-growing genetic mutant\nThe desired spore concentration is 5 x 104 spores per mL, but a range (1 x 104-1 x 105) is acceptable. Too high of a concentration makes imaging individual infection sites challenging; dilute the spore concentration with sterile water if necessary.\nCarefully pipette the conidial suspension inside of the rolled leaf sheath. Start with 25 µL (the droplet size can be increased depending on the size of the sheath, up to 50 µL).",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to perform three to five replicates of each mutant strain or barley line. It is common for damage to occur during the staining process, therefore additional sheath replicates are recommended.\nFill four or five 500 mL beakers with ddH2O, and heat until steaming (using a microwave or hotplate). Use caution when moving the hot water beakers. Hold the lid of the Petri dish over one of the steaming beakers to trap humidity inside the plate.\nStack the infected leaf sheath plates and surround them with the remaining hot beakers. This creates a humid, moist environment, required for the spores to germinate.\n\tNOTE: Use caution when steaming the lids to ensure no hot water or steam touches the sheaths.\nProtect the leaf sheaths from light, cover with a solid colored (black preferred) rubber or plastic box, and let sit for 48 h or the desired time-point for imaging.\n\t​NOTE: A cardboard box is not suitable because it does not lock in the moisture/humidity and absorbs the steam from the hot water beakers. A locking, plastic tub works well for containing the humidity, and it can be covered with black fabric or a larger dark container to block the light.\n2. Staining process\nPrepare the stain as follows: prepare a fresh dilution of 45% acetic acid and add 0.1% v/v trypan blue. Aliquot 1 mL of the dye solution into microcentrifuge tubes. Set a heat block or water bath to 40 °C.",
    "Carefully, using a razor or scalpel, cut the leaf sheath away from the tape. Using forceps, place the sheath into the microcentrifuge tube and ensure that it is completely submerged in the dye solution. Allow 2 h for the dye to penetrate the leaf. Heat the samples at 40 °C during the staining process time in a heat block or water bath to increase the penetration of the dye.\n\tNOTE: The sheaths try to float in the micro-centrifuge tube; to prevent unstained pockets of leaf tissue, fill the tubes, submerge the sheaths, and close the tube. Do not put multiple sheaths in the same micro-centrifuge tube.\nRinse the leaf sheaths carefully in 60% glycerol to remove the extra dye. Three rinses (each in fresh glycerol) are generally sufficient. Keep the sheath in glycerol until ready to mount on slides.\n3. Mounting and imaging process\nPlace the sheath on a clean glass slide and add a few drops of 60% glycerol. Using a dissecting microscope and two pairs of forceps, carefully unroll the sheath, leaving the inoculated center facing up. Hold the sheath open with the forceps, and place the coverslip on top to prevent the sheath from curling and blocking the infection site.\n\tNOTE: The leaf sheath is very fragile, and these steps need to be done with care to prevent damage to the sheath.\nSeal the coverslip using nail polish for long-term storage, or tape for short-term storage. Observe the slides under a compound light microscope.\nTake basic images using a microscope and a cell phone. Here, images were taken with a cell phone adapter mount and a smartphone. For Android devices, adjust the camera application to the following settings: flash off, disable Top Shot,disable automatic adjustment of brightness and shadows, and set the photo resolution to full.",
    "NOTE: Using the camera application on the phone decreases the battery life faster than usual, so having external power is recommended.\nOnce the cell phone is mounted on the microscope, take an image of a scale micrometer with the objective that will be used to acquire the data. The data in this study was acquired at a 40x 0.65 NA air objective, and the phone adapter was mounted on a 10x ocular. Adjust the zoom of the phone to 2.5x, and keep it consistent to maintain a constant pixel size.\nThe center of the sheath houses the largest concentration of spores and infecting appressoria; therefore, aim for 9-12 images of each sheath to obtain significant numbers for statistical analysis. The number of spores and appressoria vary based on the concentration of spores applied.\n4. Image assessment and counting using ImageJ (FIJI)\nTransfer the images to a computer running ImageJ (FIJI). To open the images, drag and drop the files onto the ImageJ bar.\nSet the scale of the images by loading the stage micrometer image and drawing a straight line between two markings for the scale. Open Set Scale, type in the Known Distance for the line measured, and type in the unit for the scale. On the micrometer, in this example, the smallest line was 10 µm. Check the Set Global box and hit OK. All subsequent images loaded will have the same scale.\nTo count appressoria, spores, or other objects, select the Point tool. Next, open the ROI Manager. Click the T key on the keyboard to add points to the list. These regions of interest can be saved if needed and reloaded onto the same image.\nDepending on the experimental goals, make additional measurements, such as spore length, appressoria size, and germ tube length.",
