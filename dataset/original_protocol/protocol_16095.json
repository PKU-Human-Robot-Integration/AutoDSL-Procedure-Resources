    "This protocol allows CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic insertion of HaloTag or HiBiT-HaloTag to the N or C terminus of any target protein of interest in any cell line that is amenable to CRISPR modification technology. If HiBiT is used, it should always be appended to the extreme terminus of the N- or C-HaloTag insertion by including its sequence in the dsDNA CRISPR donor vector (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0001]). This procedure uses a purified Cas9 protein, a site-specific guide RNA/trans-activating CRISPR RNA (guide RNA/tracrRNA) duplex, and a dsDNA donor plasmid template containing the HaloTag or HiBiT-HaloTag sequence flanked by 500 bp of genomic homology upstream and downstream of the insertion site. Examples are outlined with use of the Mirus Ingenio Kit and Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System, but the protocols can be adapted to other instruments which enable electroporation or nucleofection.",
    "When designing the dsDNA donor plasmid, we recommend including 500 bp of homology to the target of interest. However, if this sequence is too complex for PCR or synthesis, the homology arm can be shortened to between 300 and 500 bp. If introducing HaloTag or HiBiT-HaloTag at the N terminus of the protein, it is recommended that the tag(s) be placed immediately following the endogenous target start codons or any type of signal sequence that could be cleaved. If introducing HaloTag or HaloTag-HiBiT at the C terminus, place the tag(s) immediately upstream of the native stop codon. Generation of genomic maps that include the CRISPR insertions will aid in ensuring the tags are placed in the proper reading frame. As CRISPR insertion success can be highly dependent upon the choice of guide RNA, it is advisable to test a minimum of two different guide RNA sequences. Initial studies appending the tag(s) on the N- or C-terminal end of the protein using expression vectors can be used to determine the tag(s) effects on the protein's expression, binding interactions, and folding abilities. However, overexpression is not recommended for degradation studies with HaloPROTAC3, as little degradation will be detected due to the high expression levels of the fusion protein.\nMaterials\nAlt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (IDT, cat. no. 1072532)\nAlt-R CRISPR-Cas9 CRISPR RNA (crRNA; synthesized by IDT; use IDT crRNA design tool)\nNuclease Free Duplex Buffer (IDT, cat. no. 1072570)\nAlt-R S.p.

Reconstitute tracrRNA and crRNA to 100 µM using nuclease-free duplex buffer.\nEach crRNA used will require separate duplexing and RNP complexing steps. Calculate total amounts of tracrRNA and Cas9 that will be needed for each crRNA reaction before beginning to ensure that proper amounts of each are available.\n2. Prepare 50 µM tracrRNA:crRNA duplex by combining the following:\n         \ntable:\n﻿Component,Volume\n100 µM Alt-R tracrRNA,20 µl\n100 µM Alt-R crRNA,20 µl\nTotal,40 µl\n3.

    "Add the Cas9 very slowly to avoid precipitation, and swirl with pipet tip.\n5. Incubate RNP complex 10-20 min at room temperature.\n6. Determine total number of cells needed based on number of CRISPR reactions (4 × 106 cells/reaction), remove cells from plasticware using appropriate splitting techniques, centrifuge cells at 200 × g for 5 min, rinse cells with DPBS, and centrifuge again. For example, if using HEK293 cells, wash with DPBS, detach cells with trypsin, inactivate trypsin with DMEM + 10% FBS, and transfer cells to a conical tube for centrifugation.\nThe optimal density of cells used at this step can vary depending upon cell type. Refer to the Mirus Ingenio Full Electroporation Protocol for more information.\nElectroporative transfer of HaloTag or HiBiT-HaloTag to cells\n7. Resuspend 4 × 106 cells in 100 µl per CRISPR reaction in Mirus Ingenio Solution.\n8. Add 5 µg dsDNA donor plasmid to the tube containing RNP complex from step 4.\n9. Add 95 µl cell suspension to the RNP/donor mixture and mix by pipetting.\n10. Transfer the entire mixture to a 2-mm electroporation cuvette from the Mirus Ingenio Kit.\nBe careful to remove any bubbles, and ensure that the cell mixture is at bottom of cuvette.\n11. Insert cuvette into Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation system and pulse cells using the recommended values for a given cell type.\nExample for HEK293 cells: 160 V, capacitance = 950, resistance = infinity, cuvette = 2.\n12. Let cells recover for 5-10 min, add 1 ml growth medium, transfer to a flask or plate, and incubate to allow recovery.",
    "13. Allow cells to recover for 1-2 weeks in an incubator set to the standard growth conditions (temperature/humidity/CO2 level) for the cell type, and split cells if they become confluent. If performing HiBiT-HaloTag CRISPR insertions, HiBiT lytic luminescence assays can be performed to determine insertion efficiency (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0002]) by following steps 27-32.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e50691bc-9914-4e86-b31c-9d1d2f46e4fb/cpph81-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nEfficiency of multiple crRNAs used to insert HaloTag-HiBiT to the C terminus of the endogenous EPOP protein was tested using a Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Detection Assay. Analyzed data from raw RLUs shows the ratio of the luminescence from each CRISPR-edited pool of cells over background luminescence from HEK293 parent cells (A). crRNA 1 has the highest signal/background ratio, correlating to the highest HiBiT-HaloTag insertion frequency. Insertion efficiency of large tags with CRISPR/Cas9 editing is low. The fluorescent JF646 HaloTag ligand allows HaloTag-positive cells to be sorted from negative cells, enriching the edited population (B). Labeled parental HEK293 cells (blue) were used to determine negative cells. The β-catenin-HaloTag cells (red) contained a large HEK293 parent peak and a small JF646-HaloTag-positive peak that represented ∼6% of the total live cell population.\nObtain HaloTag CRISPR clones\nTo obtain a HaloTag CRISPR clone from this initial pool, FACS sorting can be performed according to the following general guidelines (though it will need to be tailored to individual FACs instruments.\n14. Prepare one confluent T75 flask of CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells and two T75 flasks of the unedited parental cell line to be used as controls.\n15. Add 71.1 µl DMSO to tube of JF646 HaloTag ligand to make a 100 µM stock, then add 50 µl of this stock to 25 ml of cell culture growth medium to make a 200 nM labeling solution.",
    "16. Remove medium from the CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell flask and from one flask of the parental cells, and replace with 10 ml each of the 200 nM labeling solution.\n17. Place cells in an incubator for 20-30 min.\n18. Reserve the second parental cell line flask in growth medium to serve as a no-label control.\n19. Prepare sort medium by adding 1× antibiotic/antimycotic to 100 ml of growth medium. For single-cell sorting into 96-well plates, transfer 200-µl aliquots into each well and then place plates in incubator; it is recommended that a minimum of three 96-well plates be used. For enrichment of HaloTag-positive cells, transfer 1-ml aliquots of sort medium into a 5-ml round-bottom tube. After sorting, cells can be transferred into tissue culture flask preincubated with the appropriate volume of sort medium.\n20. Prepare FACS instrument for single-cell sorting of cells into 96-well plates or bulk sorting into 5-ml round-bottom tube.\n21. Wash labeled CRISPR/Cas9-edited and parental cells twice with DPBS. For adherent cells, trypsinize cells after the wash.\nLabeled cells can remain resuspended in full growth medium overnight to further minimize any background fluorescence of unedited cells. This may be necessary when insertion efficiencies are very low.\n22. Resuspend cells in 1 ml FACS buffer.\nThe amount of FACS buffer needed will depend on the cell number and rate of flow. If cells are too confluent, clogging may occur, or dispensing single-cell clones may not be possible. If cells are too dilute, multiple wells may be left empty, and the total time spent sorting will be longer.\n23. Filter cells through cell strainer cap on round-bottom tube to remove any cell clumps. Keep cells on ice.\n24. Sort cells using Alexa 647 channel for JF646 HaloTag ligand (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0002]).",
    "Run unlabeled parental cells to establish appropriate gating strategies to isolate live singlets by forward and side scatter.\nRun labeled parental cells to determine background. Establish gates to collect everything with a signal intensity greater than the displayed histogram for background control cells using the Alexa 647 laser (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0002]).\nRun labeled, CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells to sort for JF646 HaloTag ligand positive cells. Set gate above the labeled parental cell gate peak as determined in b.\nMore stringent gating should yield more positive clones but potentially fewer cells, whereas less stringent gating may lead to sorting unedited cells. The histogram peak for positive cells may be small due to the low efficiency of the HiBiT-HaloTag insertion (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0002]). Even with only a small number of positive cells, multiple HaloTag-positive cells should be recovered from the sort.\n25. Incubate sort flasks or plates containing HaloTag-positive cells in an incubator set to growing conditions for cells until cells become confluent.\n26. Continue to expand cells and confirm insertion through sequencing of isolated genomic DNA.\nIf cells have been sorted to have a single cell per well of a 96-well plate, it may be several weeks before wells are confluent. Not every well containing a cell will result in formation of a colony/clonal cell line, and some cell types do not grow well from a single cell. If the insertion efficiency is very low, an initial sort of ∼10-30 cells/well can enrich the population before single-cell sorting.\nOptional HiBiT lytic protocol for HiBiT-HaloTag CRISPR insertions\n27. Count cells to estimate density, and resuspend to a final density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in cell culture growth medium.\n28. Transfer 100 µl of cells (20,000 cells) in triplicate to a white 96-well assay plate.",
    "29. Dilute the LgBiT Protein 1:100 and the Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Substrate 1:50 into an appropriate volume of room-temperature Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Buffer in a new tube. Mix by inversion.\n30. Add 100 µl Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Reagent to each well.\n31. Mix the samples by placing the plate on an orbital shaker (300-600 rpm) for at least 10 min.\n32. Read luminescence with GloMax Discover Microplate Reader using a 0.5-s integration time (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0002]).",
    "This protocol outlines the recommended concentrations and treatment times of HaloPROTAC3 for degradation of endogenous HaloTag or HiBiT-HaloTag protein fusions. As the extent of degradation will be highly dependent on the endogenous expression levels of the target and its subcellular localization, ranges of concentrations and treatment times are indicated. To ensure that the observed protein loss is specific to HaloPROTAC3 and occurs through a PROTAC mechanism, performing parallel studies with the control ent-HaloPROTAC3 (Buckley et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-bib-0003]), an enantiomer of HaloPROTAC3 that is unable to engage VHL, is also recommended here.\nThere are several ways to detect successful degradation after HaloPROTAC3 treatment, the most common of which is use of a target-specific antibody in a western blot application. As this will be dependent on the target as well as the antibody manufacturer, it is advisable to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for detection and antibody validation. Included in this protocol is an optional endpoint, lytic luminescence detection if HiBiT-HaloTag CRISPR insertions are performed. Also included (steps 8-18) is an alternate procedure for the live-cell kinetic degradation analysis of HiBiT-HaloTag insertions to better understand degradation rate, optimal time of treatments, and kinetic dose-response curves. The use of HiBiT for protein level detection is highly quantitative, directly correlative to the endogenous target protein level, and does not require the use of antibodies (Riching et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-bib-0030]; Schwinn et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-bib-0033]; Schwinn, Steffen, Zimmerman, Wood, & Machleidt, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-bib-0034]).\nMaterials\nHaloTag or HiBiT-HaloTag CRIPSR/Cas9-edited cells\nDPBS (Gibco, cat. no. 14190-144)\n0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, cat. no. 25300-054) or 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, cat. no 25200-056), depending on cell line\nComplete growth medium for cell type of choice\nHaloPROTAC3 ligand (Promega, cat. no.

Add ligands to growth medium in well to obtain final concentrations of (a) 300 nM HaloPROTAC3, (b) 300 nM ent-HaloPROTAC3, and (c) a volume of DMSO equivalent to that added in the PROTAC treatments.\nFor example, if there is 2 ml of growth medium in well, add 500 µl 1.5 µM HaloPROTAC3 stock to make a solution of 300 nM final concentration.\n6. Incubate cells in an appropriate incubator overnight.\nThese recommended HaloPROTAC3 concentrations and treatment times can be increased or decreased depending upon target and desired level of degradation.",
    "7. Detect degradation of endogenous HaloTag target fusion. If using HiBiT-HaloTag CRISPR insertions, HiBiT lytic luminescence assays can be carried out to quantitate degradation following Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-prot-0001], steps 27-32 (examples are shown in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0003] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0003]). To use antibodies to detect for HaloTag target protein degradation, follow recommended protocols for western blot analysis from the respective manufacturer. Alternatively, live-cell kinetic degradation analysis of HiBiT-HaloTag insertions can be performed to provide a more detailed understanding of the degradation process (steps 8-18 below).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71261fb2-0483-4808-a484-303b345bddbd/cpph81-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nEndpoint analysis of a homozygous β-catenin-HaloTag-HiBiT endogenous protein fusion in HEK293 cells that stably express LgBiT after degradation with HaloPROTAC3. Cells contained the endogenous β-catenin-HaloTag-HiBiT protein fusion were treated with HaloPROTAC3 for 3 or 24 hr, and degradation was detected with an endpoint HiBiT lytic assay (A). HaloPROTAC3 caused rapid reduction in the amount of tagged protein in the cell, which was visualized through luminescence imaging on an Olympus LV200 microscope (B). Phenotypic characterization was performed on cells that were treated with HaloPROTAC3. Cells containing the endogenous β-catenin-HaloTag-HiBiT protein fusion were transfected with a TCF firefly luciferase reporter before being treating with mWnt3a. HaloPROTAC3 was used to degrade the beta-catenin-HaloTag-HiBiT protein fusion, and after 24 hr a lytic dual luciferase assay was performed to measure firefly luciferase expressed from the TCF reporter (C) and β-catenin HiBiT luminescence (D). TCF expression was not induced in cells that were treated with HaloPROTAC3 because β-catenin-HaloTag-HiBiT protein fusions were degraded and could not enter the nucleus upon treatment with mWnt3a.\nOptional live-cell luminescence degradation detection of HiBiT-HaloTag CRISPR insertions\n8. Transfect the LgBiT vector into HaloTag- or HiBiT-HaloTag-edited cells using standard transient transfection and following manufacturer's recommendations.\n9. Incubate plates in an appropriate incubator overnight (18-24 hr).",
    "10. Prepare a 1× solution of Nano-Glo Endurazine Live Cell Substrate in CO2-independent medium with the appropriate percentage of FBS for the cell type, or proper assay medium for cells, by diluting the stock reagent of the substrate 1:100. If the luminometer provides CO2 injection or cells do not require CO2, regular assay medium can be used.\n11. Aspirate cell culture medium from plate, and add 90 µl of the Endurazine solution to each well.\n12. Incubate plate for at least 2.5 hr at in an incubator set to the appropriate growing conditions for the cells to equilibrate the luminescence. During this incubation period, it is advisable to pre-equilibrate the luminometer to the growth temperature and CO2 level (if possible or needed) of cell line in use.\n13. Prepare 10 µM solutions of HaloPROTAC3 and ent-HaloPROTAC3 either in CO2-independent medium containing the appropriate percentage of FBS for the cell type or in proper assay medium for the cells.\n14. Perform threefold dilutions of 10 µM HaloPROTAC3 or ent-HaloPROTAC3 in dilution reservoirs using assay medium that contains DMSO at the same concentration as the 10 µM stock. Reserve the last well of the dilution series to contain DMSO alone, as a negative control. This results in a 10× dilution series, which will be further diluted upon addition to cells for a final treatment concentration of 1 µM at the highest point.\n15. Add 10 µl of the diluted HaloPROTAC3 or ent-HaloPROTAC3 ligand to each well of the 96-well plate.\n16. Immediately place the plate in a luminometer plate reader pre-equilibrated to the growth temperature of the cell line in use.\n17. Read luminescence at desired intervals. A recommended starting point is every 15 min over a 24-hr total time frame.",
    "18. Calculate the fractional RLUs at each time point by dividing the RLU value from HaloPROTAC3-treated or ent-HaloPROTAC3-treated wells by those from the DMSO control (fractional RLU = PROTAC-treated RLU/DMSO RLU). Examples of kinetic degradation profiles of HiBiT-HaloTag CRISPR insertions are shown in Figures 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0004] and 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.81#cpph81-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/167eb8b4-025c-41d0-a595-1007d98dafdc/cpph81-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nKinetic degradation profiles of endogenous nuclear, mitochondrial membrane, and cytoplasmic HiBiT-HaloTag protein fusions after treatment with HaloPROTAC3. Cells were treated with a series of dilutions of HaloPROTAC3 (A, C, E) or ent-HaloPROTAC3 (B, D, F), and degradation was followed by luminescence detection in live cells through a kinetic degradation assay for 24 hr. An N-terminal HiBiT-HaloTag-nuclear endogenous protein fusion in HEK293 cells that stably express LgBiT, a C-terminal HaloTag-HiBiT mitochondrial membrane endogenous protein fusion in parent HEK293 cells with LgBiT introduced by transient transfection, and a C-terminal HaloTag-HiBiT-cytoplasmic protein fusion in HEK293 cells that stably express LgBiT were used, respectively. No degradation was detected in the ent-HaloPROTAC3-treated samples, confirming that the protein loss is due to a PROTAC-mediated mechanism. (G) Rapid degradation rates were observed in all samples, with >50% degradation occurring in the first 3 hr. Around 80% degradation was achieved with each HiBiT-HaloTag protein fusion regardless of cellular location (H). DC50 values were 8.1 nM for the mitochondrial membrane and nuclear protein and 18.6 nM for the cytoplasmic protein.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9841ab5d-90cf-4c4a-8c54-38b9aca78e1d/cpph81-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
    "Comparison between a HaloTag insertion with HaloPROTAC3 degradation and an FKBP12F36V insertion with dTag-13 degradation. Endogenous EPOP was tagged at the C terminus with either HaloTag-HiBiT or FKBP12F36V-HiBiT in HEK293 cells. HiBiT was used in combination with both tags to allow the detection of luminescent live cells once LgBiT was introduced by transient transfection. Both HaloPROTAC3 (A) and dTag-13 (B) produced rapid and robust degradation of the protein fusion with the ∼80% degradation after 24 hr and similar levels of compound (C). However, with the dTag-13 compound (B), a hook effect was detected in which at higher concentrations, the rate slows and degradation decreases."
