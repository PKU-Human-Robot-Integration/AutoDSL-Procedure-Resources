    "This protocol describes methods for decellularizing, washing, and storing extracellular matrix scaffolds derived from apple tissue. Because the numerous washes in this protocol are time-consuming, it can be advantageous to make scaffolds in bulk and store them until use. At the end of this protocol, scaffolds should be rigid and translucent-white, not soft or oxidized (yellow-orange).\nThis protocol is described for a large but manageable batch of 20 apple slices, with each slice being used to prepare a single scaffold plate later in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002]. Details are provided for adjusting the protocol for more or fewer slices. The “wash, sterilize, and store slices” section can be carried out several times in one day by starting batches at 15-min intervals, so that transfers between washes are staggered and done continuously. To keep track of wash steps and incubation times, it is recommended to create a table of steps and fill it in as the steps are carried out. For additional details, see Critical Parameters.\nCAUTION: Extreme care should be taken when manipulating large volumes of ethanol, as they are a significant fire hazard. Ethanol should be kept away from fire and heat sources. Flame-sterilized forceps should be totally cooled before any contact with ethanol.\nCAUTION: Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) should be kept away from heat and manipulated with appropriate personal protective equipment as it is flammable and causes irritation. SDS solution is also slippery. All working areas, shaking platforms, and flasks should be wiped clean of any spill to prevent falls.\nMaterials\nFresh MacIntosh apples (Malus domestica ‘MacIntosh’)\n0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Fisher Bioreagents, cat. no.

Manipulate apples and slices with gloves, as contact with human skin also speeds up oxidation.\n1. Make 3-mm-thick slices parallel to the core from two or three Macintosh apples using a mandolin slicer.\nThis will usually yield ∼20 usable slices depending on the shape of the apples. The chosen thickness of 3 mm allows C. elegans to navigate the habitat freely in all spatial dimensions. The thickness can be adjusted, however, for different uses. Thinner slices increase visibility through the scaffold, whereas thicker scaffolds can host more animals. If thickness is changed, Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002] may need to be fine-tuned (also see Critical Parameters).\n2. Cut out circles of hypanthium tissue from the slices using a round cookie cutter with a 4-cm diameter. Discard skin and slices containing ovary core.\nA 4-cm-diameter circle is used to create an environment that is as similar as possible to a standard agar plate for C. elegans culture, but slices can be cut to any shape for other uses. As the risk of contamination increases through the steps, it is preferable to cut slices to the desired shape at this step rather than later.\n3. Immediately soak slices in 2 L of 0.5% (w/v) SDS in a sterile 4-L glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flask. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminum foil to prevent introduction of debris and leave overnight (12-24 hr) at room temperature on a shaking platform at 125 rpm.",
    "Wide-mouth flasks facilitate transfer between flasks in later steps. Because slices float, a large flask with a relatively small volume of liquid is recommended to maximize surface area.\nFor a different number of slices, maintain a ratio of ten slices per liter of liquid and use a flask size that will accommodate the large volume of foam produced by shaking the SDS solution (∼1 L foam for 2 L solution). For different volumes, flask numbers, or flask sizes, adjust the speed of the shaking platform so that slices do not stay overlaid or clumped together while also avoiding spillage. If possible, set the shaking platform to reverse every 45 min to prevent clumps and free slices that have stuck to the sides of the flask. If several flasks are used, but only one shaking platform is available, position the flasks on the platform so as to keep track of batch identification, as markings or tape labels come off when cleaning.\nDay 2: Wash, sterilize, and store slices\n4. Add 2 L deionized water to a new sterile 4-L flask and transfer scaffolds to this flask. To do this, pour the liquid content of the flask into a waste container while using forceps (sterilized by flaming, but totally cooled) to catch the decellularized slices as they flow out of the flask and transfer them to the new flask.\nOffset broad flat-tip forceps are favored for scaffold manipulation throughout, as they minimize damage to the matrix and skin contact with solutions during transfer. Scaffolds should be grasped delicately, as squeezing them too hard with forceps can break them. Forceps should be sterilized between batches to prevent introduction of contaminants.\nCold or room-temperature deionized water should be used for washes, as warm water will damage scaffold integrity.",
    "Scaffolds should stay rigid and translucent-white, not soft or oxidized (yellow-orange), from this point on and throughout Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002]. If they are not rigid and translucent-white, they should be discarded.\n5. Cover the mouth of the new flask with foil, then shake and twirl by hand for 30 s.\nShaking too vigorously can break scaffolds.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 for a total of three quick washes.\nUsing sterile flasks across steps is preferable to limit introduction of contaminants, but flasks can be reused for washing within a protocol run if rinsed thoroughly. To do this, rinse thoroughly with deionized water to remove residues, clean with 100% ethanol, and let dry upside down before the next wash. Cleaning and drying flasks takes ∼10 min, so this should be done during wash wait times so the flasks are dry and ready when the next wash is done to minimize time between washes.\n7. Repeat step 4, then cover the mouth with foil and shake for 30 min at room temperature and 125 rpm.\n8. Repeat step 7.\n9. Add 2 L of 70% (v/v) ethanol to a sterile 4-L flask and transfer scaffolds to the ethanol.\n10. Cover the mouth with foil and shake for 1 hr at room temperature and 125 rpm.\n11. Add 2 L of 100% ethanol to a sterile 4-L flask and transfer scaffolds into it.\n12. Cover the mouth with foil and shake for 1 hr at room temperature and 125 rpm.\n13. Proceed directly to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002] or store if needed. To store, transfer to sterile sample bags, taking care not to transfer excessive amounts of ethanol. Vacuum-seal the bags and keep up to 3 weeks at 4°C.\nScaffolds in ethanol can be moved first to a small sterile beaker to facilitate transfer.",
    "Because opened sample bags should not be resealed, the scaffolds should be split according to future use, remembering that one scaffold is used to create one maintenance plate.\nExcessive ethanol in the bags will promote movement and tearing of the scaffolds. Failing to remove air or seal the bags properly can lead to scaffold oxidation, ethanol evaporation, and loss of scaffold integrity.",
    "This protocol is designed to create three-dimensional, controlled monoxenic maintenance plates (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-fig-0001]) from decellularized scaffolds. Due to the porosity of the scaffolds, it is not possible to obtain uniform bacterial growth throughout the scaffolds using standard methods (as outlined in Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]). This protocol was developed to ensure uniform bacterial growth through a series of washes and incubations.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af346211-cb14-48f7-9bdd-315be37bc289/cpz1288-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSeeded scaffold plate (reprinted from Guisnet et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0006]).\nFor parallel culture of animals on standard agar plates, we also describe how to prepare standard agar plates with a comparable cross-sectional bacterial density to the scaffold plates through a modification of the standardized methods outlined in Stiernagle (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]). We describe how to produce two plates of each type at once, with additional details for adjusting the protocol to produce more plates.\nNOTE: Scaffolds are more susceptible to contamination than traditional agar plates. Throughout this protocol and when using the resulting plates, always work under sterile conditions close to a flame, with sterile reagents, equipment, and working surfaces.\nMaterials\nDecellularized scaffold slices (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0001])\nNGML (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0004])\nE. coli OP50 plated stock (e.g., Caenorhabditis Genetics Center; see Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014])\n6-cm NGM agar plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0003])\nSterile water\n250-ml glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flask\nAluminum foil\nShaking platform\nSterile scalpel (optional)\n125-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks\n37°C shaking incubator\nSterile 6-cm Petri dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "1. Transfer two decellularized scaffold slices to 100 ml NGML in a sterile 250-ml glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flask under sterile conditions. Cover the mouth with foil and shake overnight (8-16 hr) at room temperature on a shaking platform at 145 rpm to dilute out the ethanol.\nFor scaffolds in sample bags, use a sterilized scalpel to cut the bag open and retrieve scaffolds using sterile forceps.\nA wide-mouth flask facilitates transfer of slices to Petri dishes later. Because slices float, a large flask with a small volume of liquid is recommended to maximize surface area.\nFor a different number of slices, maintain a ratio of one slice per 50 ml liquid and use a flask size that accounts for liquid movement and avoids spillage. For different volumes or flask sizes, adjust the speed of the shaking platform so that slices do not stay overlaid or clumped together. If possible, set the shaking platform to reverse every 45 min to prevent clumps and free slices that have stuck to the sides of the flask.\nIt is not necessary to stagger the start time for this protocol.\nCAUTION: Because scaffolds are filled with ethanol, extreme care should be taken when working close to a sterilization flame or using warm forceps.\n2. Inoculate three sterile 125-ml flasks containing 50 ml NGML with a single colony of E. coli OP50 from a plated stock. Cover flasks with foil and incubate on a shaking platform at 37°C overnight.\nBecause contamination tends to be common in these cultures, it is recommended to prepare 1.5 times as many flasks as scaffolds. Always make fresh.\nDay 2: Inoculate scaffolds and standard culture plates\n3. Add 5 ml saturated OP50 culture to each of two sterile 6-cm Petri dishes.",
    "4. Transfer one scaffold into each dish. Add more culture if necessary to completely submerge the scaffold.\n5. Pipet 100 µl of the same culture onto each of two 6-cm NGM agar plates and shake briefly to spread. If there is condensation on the lid, wipe it off with delicate-task wipers.\n6. Line the interior of a water-resistant tight-seal box with delicate-task wipers and saturate them with sterile water.\n7. Place scaffold dishes and agar plates inside the box and close tightly. Make sure plates are flat and stable inside the box.\n8. Incubate 5.5-6 hr at 28°C.\n9. Take a scaffold with forceps (sterilized by flaming) and gently tap your wrist on the work surface to release 1-2 drops of excess culture. Deposit on a new NGM agar plate and gently lay the flat portion of the forceps over the scaffold to push out air from between the scaffold and the agar surface. Repeat with the second scaffold.\nTo increase depth of visibility and imaging quality, scaffolds can also be passed through a vacuum chamber for ∼30 min or until all air is removed before moving them to agar plates. Note that this additional step tends to increase the risk of contamination and is thus not recommended for regular maintenance plates.\nTo restrict the bacterial culture to the scaffold, avoid moving the scaffold on the agar once it has been deposited.\n10. Seal scaffold plates and seeded agar plates with Parafilm and keep upside down in a closed box at room temperature for at least 24 hr before use. Store plates this way for up to 3 weeks.",
    "Several experimental designs require the use of synchronized eggs or animal populations. This protocol is adapted from Stiernagle (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]) for collection of synchronized eggs from scaffold plates. The inhabited scaffold is sectioned and washed to release the eggs, which are then collected in a pellet and can be used directly or added to a fresh plate to grow the synchronized population to the desired stage.\nThis protocol is not recommended for quantifying egg laying inside scaffolds. Eggs tend to adhere to the surface on which they are laid, and it is not possible to assess the proportion of eggs collected with this protocol due to the dimensionality of the scaffold.",
    "It is not uncommon for C. elegans stocks on culture plates to develop a fungal or bacterial contamination, and scaffold plates are more prone to contamination than standard agar plates. To address this issue, we also describe how to clean contaminants from scaffold plate worm stocks using an adaptation of the bleach method from Stiernagle (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]). Contamination spreads easily within and between scaffold plates, so it is important to clean stocks or dispose of contaminated plates rapidly once contamination occurs. Using bleach to remove contaminants also dissolves hatched animals, but embryos are protected by the eggshell and will survive. The bleach is subsequently washed out to protect these animals as they hatch. It is thus essential to start the protocol with a plate that contains eggs or gravid adults. If all eggs have already hatched, it is preferable to transfer a few young contaminated animals to a fresh plate and proceed with the protocol when they have laid eggs, because excessive contamination can impede growth and egg laying. After cleaning contaminated stocks with bleach solution, a sterile pellet of eggs is collected in a small centrifuge tube and can be re-plated onto a fresh plate to resume animal culture.\nSynchronization and decontamination use the same basic egg extraction method, and the slight differences between them are outlined below. The Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0004] can be used to collect non-synchronized larval or adult worms from scaffold plates.\nNOTE: If collected eggs or worms will be re-plated, carry out these protocols under sterile conditions close to a flame, with sterile reagents, equipment, and working surfaces.\nMaterials\nScaffold plates with C. elegans:\n               \nlate-L4 from any growing condition (for synchronizing)\ncontaminated plate containing eggs (for cleaning)\nSeeded scaffold plate (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002])\nNGML (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0004]) or bleach solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0004])\nSterile deionized, distilled water",

For synchronizing only: Place ten late-L4 C. elegans larvae on a freshly seeded scaffold plate using a sterile platinum worm pick and keep overnight (8-12 hr) at 20°C.\nUp to 200 animals can be added per scaffold plate if a large number of eggs need to be collected. Some strains may lay eggs more slowly and need to be kept longer before proceeding, depending on the number of eggs needed.\nTo clean a contaminated plate, skip this step and start directly at step 2.\n2. Cut the scaffold in three parallel pieces of equal width using a sterile scalpel. Be careful not to cut or scratch the agar while cutting the scaffold as eggs and animals can get stuck in the interstices.\n3. Use flat-tip forceps to lay the pieces on top of one another on one side of the dish using sterile forceps (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f0f223d1-6983-4bd8-b25f-9d36cc846b87/cpz1288-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCollection of eggs and animals from slices of scaffold.

    "5. Collect as much liquid without eggs or animals as possible from the bottom of the dish by observing under a microscope, and wash this solution over the scaffold pieces again.\nLiquid retained by the scaffold pieces can also be recovered by drawing it out delicately with the pipet.\n6. Repeat step 5 until no more eggs or animals are washed out of the scaffold pieces.\n7. Transfer the collected liquid to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nSome of the liquid should be absorbed by the agar, but use more than one tube if needed.\n8. Centrifuge for 1 min at 2000 × g, room temperature, in a tabletop microcentrifuge.\n9. Remove as much liquid (supernatant) as possible from the tube while being careful not to remove any eggs.\nIt is useful to carry out this step under a microscope. Eggs tend to sink in water but float in bleach.\n10. If eggs need to be washed completely of bacterial food before use, repeat steps 8-9 three to four times, filling the tube with sterile water each time.\nWhen cleaning a contaminated plate, it is absolutely necessary to perform this step in order to dilute out the bleach. Perform washes carefully, as residual bleach will kill hatching animals.\nEggs are now ready to use. If eggs were collected from a contaminated stock, they can be re-plated on a fresh uncontaminated plate and regular maintenance can be resumed.",
    "Animals can be picked directly from the scaffold, but a large portion of the population remains inaccessible within the scaffold. If the user requires a large number of animals, but does not need eggs or a synchronized population, this protocol can be used to force animals out of the scaffold and is faster than Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0003]. By shaking scaffold pieces in liquid, the animals are forced to exit the scaffold and can be easily collected with a pipet.\nAgain, this protocol is not recommended to assess population size, as it is not possible to know whether all animals have exited the scaffold. It is also not recommended as an alternative for collecting eggs, as cutting and shaking the scaffold breaks off pieces that are as small as eggs and can be difficult to differentiate from eggs.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0003])\nScaffold plate with growing C. elegans population\nReusable 6-cm glass Petri dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 08-747A)\nGlass Pasteur pipet\n1.

The Petri dish becomes saturated with material if more than half of the scaffold is added, however, so use more than one dish if needed.\n4.
