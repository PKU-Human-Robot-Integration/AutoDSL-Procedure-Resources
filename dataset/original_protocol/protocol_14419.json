    "All experiments in this protocol were approved by the Veterinary Authorities of the Canton of Zürich, Switzerland (number 60/2014). Furthermore, all experimental steps were performed in strict compliance with the Guidelines on Experiments with Animals by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS) and Guidelines of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).\n1. Animal Husbandry, Operating Room Equipment and Instruments, Anesthesia\nKeep male Wistar rats with a weight of 250-300 g in ventilated cages under standard pathogen-free conditions in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Give animals free access to food and water at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 1 °C.\nInduce anesthesia in a box, where isoflurane is flushed in with 5 vol% for 30 s (Figure 1A), followed by an isoflurane concentration of 3 vol% until the animal is under deep anesthesia. Confirm the level of anesthesia by the toe-pinch reflex.\nProvide analgesia using subcutaneously applied buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) during the surgical intervention, followed by 0.02 mg/kg every 12 h in the postoperative phase for 48 h.\nTransfer the animal to the working place, where they are spontaneously breathing exposed to a gas mixture of 1.0 - 2.5 vol% isoflurane in oxygen (flow: 600 mL/min).\nClose the eyes of the animal and use an ointment to protect the eyes. Inject 5 mL saline subcutaneously, half of it on each side of the abdomen, followed by 0.1 mg atropine.\nPerform surgery using a surgical microscope in a microsurgery room.\nKeep the animal under volatile anesthesia using a ventilation mask consisting of a latex membrane (Figure 1B), through which the rat's snout is pushed. Fix the extremities with tape (Figure 1B).",
    "Lay out the surgical instruments in sterile fashion on a side table: saline- and Betadine-soaked sponges (Figure 2A), abdominal wall retractors (Figure 2B) as well as 3-0 sutures for retraction of the abdominal wall and xiphoid, scissors, Adson forceps, fine tips microforceps straight and curved and pre-cut 6-0 silk ties for the ligation procedure (Figure 2C).\nUse non-sticking bipolar microforceps for transection of the hepatic parenchyma. Close the abdominal wall and skin using 3-0 silk sutures with SH-1 needles and 5-0 Maxon (Figure 2D). Use a bipolar forceps for hemostasis.\n2. Start of Surgery\nShave the abdomen of the animal with a small animal hair clipper from the xiphoid to the genitals with a 2-cm area lateral of the midline. Thoroughly remove the hair.\nDisinfect this area 3 times with betadine soaked sponges.\nPerform a midline incision using a scalpel for the skin, and then use surgical scissors to open the abdomen.\nRetract the right and left abdominal wall and the xiphoid with 3-0 silk sutures (Figure 3A).\nRetract the stomach, colon and small bowel from the hepatoduodenal ligament of the rat with self-made small wire retractors (Figure 3B).\n3. Portal Vein Ligation (PVL)\nAccess the portal vein and its branches by lateral retraction of the stomach and the small bowel (Figure 3B).\nDissect the portal vein bluntly by picking up the peritoneum with the microforceps and slowly peeling it medially.\nDissect the portal vein branches out (Figure 3C) in the following sequence: (1) right posterior branch, (2) left lateral and left median branch together, and (3) caudate branch.\nFirst, peel off the peritoneum with small, not too energetic moves to avoid tearing the small arterial branches to the liver lobes that run directly under the peritoneal coverage.",
    "Once the main portal vein is denuded, encircle the branches with slow forward pushing and spreading movements and then pull a 1-cm piece of 6-0 silk tie around the respective portal vein branch and ligate it.\nLigate the right posterior lobe branch. (Figure 3C) The technical difficulty of the right posterior branch consists in the fact that the artery to the right posterior lobe is running across the right posterior portal vein branch.\nPull the artery cranially together with the peritoneum to expose the right portal vein branch with the curved microforceps.\nLigate the right posterior lobe branch with the pre-cut 6-0 silk tie. The right posterior lobe turns visibly pale once the portal vein is ligated.\nAvoid pushing against resistance during the circling to prevent tearing the artery or the portal vein. In case of bleeding, apply pressure for at least one minute with a sterile cotton swab and then reassess. If bleeding does not stop, sacrifice the animal.\nLigate the left lateral (LLL) and left median lobe (LML) branches. These branches have one common trunk. (Figure 3C). The left median lobe branch arises from the portal vein within the parenchyma of the LLL.\nLigate the portal vein leading to both LLL and also the LML branch together using the pre-cut 6-0 silk tie.\nAvoid injuries to the arteries leading to LLL and LML, running within the peritoneal layer. As long as the peritoneum is peeled back carefully, they stay intact. The LLL and LML turn visibly pale once the branches are ligated.",
    "Ligate the caudate lobe branch (Figure 3C). The portal vein leading to the somewhat separate caudate lobes in rats takes off from the main portal vein, distally and medially to the takeoff of the right lobe branch from the main portal vein (not strictly inferiorly like in humans or larger animals).\nDissect it out and encircle it by lifting up the peritoneum plus bile duct and arteries from the main portal vein.\nEncircle the caudate portal vein branch with a curved microforceps coming from laterally. The two caudate lobes turn visibly pale, once the caudate lobe branch is ligated with 6-0 silk.\nTying these three portal vein branches leads to exclusive portal vein perfusion of the right median lobe (RML), which is visible by a distinct demarcation line between the right and left median lobe.\n4. Portal Vein Ligation with Transection (PVL+T)\nPerform the transection along the demarcation line between RML and LML after PVL (Figure 3D).\nUse a non-sticking bipolar silver forceps with a very fine neurosurgical tip to precauterize the liver tissue creating a 1-mm cauterization strip along the demarcation line.\nUse scissors to carefully cut the precauterized tissue. It is quite difficult to properly assess the depth of the transection. The goal is to get as close to the vena cava as possible, which runs intrahepatically in rats. Injury of the vena cava is accompanied by extensive bleeding, which can usually not be stopped.\nIn case of injury apply gentle pressure using a cotton-swab, but if the bleeding does not stop within 3 - 4 min, sacrifice the animal. Attempts at repairing the vena cava using sutures have generally been unsuccessful. Rats are very sensitive to air embolism, which may occur on occasion and lead to cardiac arrest.",
    "5. Intraoperative Measurement of Portal Vein Pressure and Volume Flow\nAssess portal vein pressure by direct cannulation with a G30 needle connected to a pressure monitor (Figure 4A).\nUse the 2-mm volume flow probe placed laterally connected to the flow device for direct measurement of portal volume flow over 2 min (Figure 4B). Only record data with stable measurement quality as indicated on the machine display.\nAssess portal vein flow and pressure separately after the group of steps that define the respective procedure, i.e. the tying off of three portal vein branches or the tying off of the three portal vein branches plus performing the parenchymal transection between the RML and the LML.\n6. Final Steps of Surgery\nMake sure that the small bowel is placed properly in the abdominal cavity before closing.\nClose the peritoneum and the abdominal wall with 3-0 silk sutures with SH-1 needles.\nFinally suture the skin using Maxon 5-0.\nDisinfect the skin again.\nApply again 5 mL saline subcutaneously into the subcutaneous tissue lateral to the abdomen.\n7. Liver Volumetry in Rats Using Small Animal CT\n24 h prior to the first CT imaging inject 200 μL of the contrast agent into the tail vein through a G26 intravenous catheter.\nUse a micro CT to scan the rats. Place the animal in a plexiglas box to induce general anesthesia (first flush in with 5 vol% for 30 s, followed by an isoflurane concentration of 2 - 3 vol% until the animal is under anesthesia and maintain it throughout scanning via a tubing system). For optimal image quality, synchronize the CT scan with the respiration of the animal.",
    "Export the digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) files and analyze them using the public domain imaging platform OsiriX 8.0. Use the \"closed polygon\" tool to draw the lobe borders based on the radiodensitiy of the nanoparticle contrast in the liver and use the region of interest (ROI) menu to calculate partial liver volumes (see Figure 2A in Schadde et al.17)\nIn the standard model, allow the liver to grow over 3 days and obtain daily CT scans to assess volume increase.\nSubscription Required.
