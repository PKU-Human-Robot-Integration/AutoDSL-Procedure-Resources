    "1. Surgery and Injections\nAnesthetize mice using an intraperitoneal injection (22-25 G needle recommended) of ketamine (100-120 mg/kg) and xylazine (7.5-16 mg/kg).\n\t\nAssess sedation using strong toe pinches until no responses are elicited. For all animal procedures described, modify to follow local IACUC guidelines as necessary.\nPlace sedated mice in a stereotaxic device by securing the head and ears in their respective holders.\n\t\nLubricate the eyes prior to placing the animal in the stereotaxic device with a sterile ophthalmic ointment.\nShave the scalp with a razor and sterilize the area with Betadine swabs.\nUsing a scalpel, cut a midline incision and reflect the skin and underlying muscles above the area to be injected.\nRotate a scalpel blade as a trephine to perform a craniotomy above the region to be exposed. Alternatively, use a small drill bit attached to a Dremel to perform the craniotomy.\n\t\nTo perform the craniotomy, place scalpel blade or drill bit on surface of skull and slowly rotate until enough bone has been excavate to reveal the pia mater underneath.\nOnce the initial excavation is made, enlarge the craniotomy using fine forceps to carefully remove bone from the edges.\nFill a 1 μl syringe with the viral solution to be injected (UNC Vector Core).\n\t\nTo enhance transfection efficacy, prepare viral solution with 4 μg/ml polybrene.\nLower the needle into the area to be injected and pressure infuse 200 nl of solution containing virus with a syringe pump.\n\t\nLet syringe sit for 10 min before withdrawing the needle.\nSuture the skin with nonabsorbable monofilament Nylon and cover the incision with antibiotic ointment.\n\t\nSutures should be removed after 7-10 days.\nInject buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) for post-operative analgesia.\nAllow animals to post-operatively recover for 14-21 days to allow for adequate expression of channel rhodopsin.\n2. Slice Preparation",
    "Following the recovery period, deeply anesthetize the animal with isoflurane anesthesia, as verified by absence of withdrawal reflex when the hind foot and/or toes are firmly pinched.\nDissect the brain by decapitation followed by midline and frontal cuts to the skull.\nPeel apart the skull from the midline to expose the brain.\nCarefully remove the brain using a fine scoop spatula to separate the cranial nerves from the base of the brain.\nQuickly place dissected brain in small 100 ml beaker containing chilled, ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in mM: 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose).\nRemove brain from ACSF and place on a microscope slide covered with filter paper prewetted with ACSF.\nMake a blocking cut of the brain in the desired orientation using a clean razor blade.\nAffix the blocked surface of the brain to cutting stage using instant adhesive glue.\nTransfer stage to a vibratome cutting chamber (kept in freezer until ready for cutting).\nPour ice cold ACSF into cutting chamber.\nSlice brain sections at 400-500 µm using a vibrating tissue slicer.\nTransfer brain slices to a holding chamber containing oxygenated ACSF, and incubate at 30 °C for at least 1 hr before experiment.\n3. Physiological Recording\nAfter the incubation period, transfer a slice to a recording chamber on a modified microscope stage.\nSecure the slice in the bath during the experiment using a few threads of Nylon filaments attached to a platinum wire slice holder.\nPerfuse the slice with ACSF constantly.",
    "Pull recording pipettes to a tip resistance of 3-6 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 127 K-gluconate, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.07 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 Na2-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 0.1 EGTA. The intracellular solution should have pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH or gluconic acid and the osmolality of 280-290 mOsm.\nUsing a standard visualized whole-cell recording setup, place recording pipette near neuron to be recorded while applying positive pressure22,23.\nRelease positive pressure while applying suction to form Gigaohm seal.\nApply brief suction to break membrane and form whole-cell configuration recording.\nRecord the responses of neurons in either voltage or current clamp.\n4. Laser-scanning Photostimulation\nStart data acquisition software and hardware, described in previous reports23-29.\n\tNote: We have utilized both Tidelwave25 and, more recently, Ephus26 acquisition programs, written in Matlab and developed by the laboratory of Karel Svboda at Janelia Farms30. For a full description of laser-scanning photostimulation in Ephus, see Suter et al.26 and the step-by-step guide30.\n\tNote: The setup described in this article is derived from that described by Shepherd (2012)23. The laser beam is guided via an open beam system of mirrors to the top port of the microscope through the objective lens onto the slice (Figure 2).\nDivert a small portion of the laser onto a photodiode with a microscope coverslip placed in the laser path and use the current output from this photodiode to monitor the laser intensity during experiments.\n\t\nCalibrate the photodiode current output recorded in the software to the measured laser power at the back focal plane of the objective using a power meter during equipment setup23.\nControl the laser power by rotating a variable neutral density wheel. The laser power used varied between 25-70 mW (at the back focal plane) in our experiments.",
    "Set the length and timing of the laser stimulating by modifying the pulse parameters for the laser and shutter. Laser stimulation is typically 2 msec long.\nCapture image of the region to be stimulated using the 'Grab Video' function.\nSelect the stimulation grid according to desired dimensions. We typically use a 16 x 16 stimulation array with 80 μm spacing between adjacent rows and columns.\nOverlay the mapping grid with the acquired image and adjust the x, y, and degree offset to the desired location and orientation.\nActivate the 'Map' function to start stimulation and acquisition of data.\nFollowing acquisition of photostimulation evoked responses, carry out analysis of mapped data using either the offline map analysis program in Tidelwave25 or the 'MapAnalysis' program in Ephus26.\n5. Fixed Slice Imaging\nAfter recordings, transfer brain slice to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.01 M PBS (pH7.4) overnight at 4 ºC.\nTransfer the slice in 30% sucrose in 4% PFA/0.01 M PBS overnight at 4 ºC.\nCut 50 µm sections using a cryostat and collect in 0.01 M PBS.\nRinse sections in 0.01 M PBS twice at room temperature.\nMount sections and coverslip in an appropriate antifade medium.\nTransfer sections to the confocal microscope.\nFocus into the ROI using white light.\nChoose the wavelength, imaging size, and repetition for image acquisition. For YFP, we use 514 nm (Ex)/527 nm (Em)."
