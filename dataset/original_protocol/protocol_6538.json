    "Seeding cells on cover glassesGrow LLC-PK1 cells in a T75 flask with culture medium (low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1% Pen-Strep, see Recipes) in an incubator with 5% CO2. Use flask of LLC-PK1 cells grown to about 90% confluence. Rinse with 5-8 ml PBS and add 1-2 ml trypsin according to standard cell culture procedures. Place back into incubator for about 10 min, until cells are floating. Note that details of culturing have to be adjusted for specific cell lines.While cells are in trypsin, place autoclaved coverglass in multi-well plates using sterile tweezers.When cells are floating, resuspend them in 8 ml fresh medium, mix well and seed an equal number of cells onto coverglasses. Use 2 x 105-5 x 105/ml cells in 1 ml medium/well (12-well plate).Gently shake the culture dish to evenly distribute the cells and place into culture incubator.Grow cells to 100% confluency (about 48 h). Of note, we found that expression of Cldn-2 is low in subconfluent cell cultures and increases as the cells become confluent (Amoozadeh et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to allow the cells to become fully confluent and generate mature TJs, before performing the immunostaining (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200712/20200712085445_9169.jpgFigure 1. Subconfluent (A) and confluent (B) LLC-PK1 cultures. Phase contrast images of live cells grown on cover glasses were obtained using a Nikon eclipse TS100 microscope (10x objective).FixationTreat cells according to experimental needs, e.g., with cytokines. At the end of the treatment, aspirate the medium and quickly rinse with 1x PBS. The steps after rinsing do not need to be performed under sterile conditions. The multi-well dish used for culturing cells can be used for the staining protocol under non-sterile conditions.Aspirate PBS and immediately fix with 0.5-1 ml methanol (stored at -20 °C) for 5 min.",
    "Make sure the methanol fully covers the cover glasses. These 2 steps should be done as fast as possible.Wash with 1x PBS 5 times. After this step the samples can be stored overnight at 4 °C if needed. However, we prefer to proceed to the next steps immediately. Longer storage is not recommended.Blocking, staining and mountingBlock with 0.5-1 ml blocking buffer in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Make sure the buffer fully covers the cover glasses.Primary antibody incubation:Dilute antibody 1:100 in antibody buffer.To reduce antibody use, place 50 μl of diluted antibody on parafilm and place the cover glass with cells facing the drop. Avoid bubbles and don’t let cover glass dry out. Incubate for 1h at room temperature.Non-specific secondary antibody binding control: use one of the cover glasses to demonstrate specificity of the secondary antibody. Omit primary antibody but do all other steps similarly.Control sample for primary antibody specificity: use samples where Cldn-2 was silenced or knocked down (Dan et al., 2019).At the end of the incubation use tweezers to place cover glasses back into the same culture dish turning the cells upside. Wash with 1x PBS 5 times.Secondary antibody incubation:Dilute secondary antibody (1:1,000) and DAPI (1:5,000) in antibody buffer.Add 500 μl antibody solution to the cover glasses.Incubate for 1h at room temperature in the dark.Wash with 1x PBS 5 times over 15 min.Label microscope slides to identify samples. Place a drop of fluorescent mounting medium on a microscope slide. Lift up cover glasses using a tweezer and touch the edge to a paper towel to remove excess fluid. Place stained cover glass onto the drop of fluorescent mounting medium with cells facing down. Avoid air bubbles. Aspirate access fluid.Let the fluorescent mounting medium dry for at least 30 min before imaging or storing.",
    "Store dried slides in the dark at 4 °C.Visualization using confocal microscopySet up the confocal microscopeSettings (e.g., laser, objective etc) will vary depending on your experiment. We use a 63x objective, which was chosen to give the desired resolution and size of the imaged field.Chose the excitation/emission settings for the fluorophore of your secondary antibody (Alexa488 or 555 in our experiments) and DAPI.Select exposure time to avoid image saturation. Obtain z-stack sections at both wavelength through the whole sample by defining the top and bottom focal plane positions and a step size of around 2 μm (12-16 focal planes).A single plane at the level of the TJs of the stack can be used for display. However, LLC-PK1 cells in a monolayer often have slight height differences and can also form domes. This causes the TJs in different areas of a visual field to be at slightly different focal planes, making some areas to be out of focus. Further, TJ-localized and intracellular Cldn-2 are also in different focal planes. To visualize all Cldn-2 within the cells, use Metamorph to generate a Maximum Intensity Projection from the z-stack (see Figure 2 for an example). This process uses the brightest pixel from each layer and displays its intensity value in the final image, thus allowing visualization of a 3D image collapsed into a 2D picture. The processing must be disclosed in the manuscript.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200712/20200712085533_5887.jpgFigure 2. Typical Claudin-2 staining in LLC-PK1 cells. LLC-PK1 cells were fixed with methanol, and Cldn-2 stained as described in the protocol. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Z-stacks were obtained using confocal microscopy for each staining, maximal intensity projection pictures were generated using the Metamorph software. The images obtained for the two wavelengths were combined. The bar represents 10 μm."
