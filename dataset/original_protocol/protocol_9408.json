    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare the dissection buffer preparation by adding the following compounds: 128 mM NaCl, 1mM EGTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 2mM KCl, 5mM HEPES, and 36 mM Sucrose in 1000 mL, PH to 7.2 and filter sterilize.\n2. Preparation for the Dissection\nSiligard cube: The gel is cut to approximately one inch wide, 1 inch long and about  1cm high. The gel cube is placed on a glass slide during dissection.  Cubes may be used more than once.\nPins: Pins used for dissection need to be extra short. The sharp bottom portion of minutien pins works best in dissection.\nNeed one sharp microdissection spring scissors.\nNeed two fine tipped forceps.\n3. Collection of Larvae\nWandering 3rd instar larvae that are expressing a GFP tagged vesicle protein are collected onto a petri dish.\nLarvae are washed in deionized water to get rid of all the food.\n4.  Live dissection of larvae\nA larva is transferred to the dissection gel cube on a glass slide.  Larva is immersed in dissection buffer.\nLarva is pined at the anterior and posterior using two fine pins with the dorsal side up.\nUsing microdissection scissors, a small cut is made at the midline near the posterior end. From this incision a cut is made through to the anterior. Using two pins, pin the cut cuticle on the lateral edges.\nAdd a drop of dissecting buffer. Carefully remove the gut, intestines and fat bodies with forceps. Most of these tissues normally ooze out during the dorsal cutting.\nReplace the buffer with fresh dissecting buffer. The larva should never be dry and should constantly be in dissecting buffer.",
    "Incubations using in vivo markers MitoTracker or LysoTracker are done at this time, by diluting the in vivo marker in dissection buffer. After the incubation of the in vivo marker wash the dissected larva several times (5 quick washes) using fresh dissecting buffer.\nAfter replacing the last wash push the pins into the syligard and immediately coverslip. The larvae is now ready for observation.\n5. Live imaging of dissected larvae\nPlace the coverslip and gel onto the microscope stage and image using an inverted microscope.\nWe use a 100x lens to image tagged vesicles within larval segmental nerves.  GFP expression in the cell bodies of the ventral ganglion is first evaluated before segmental nerves are imaged. If robust GFP staining is observed in the cell bodies in the ventral ganglion, the nerves are then imaged and used for evaluation.\nUsing a dual view system with filters for CFP/YFP or RFP/YFP and split view software we can simultaneously image two tagged protein in vivo.\n6.
