    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDEN/CCl4-induced HCC animal model\nTiming: 24 weeks\nThis section describes the injection dose, administration route and treatment cycle for DEN combined with CCl4 to induce HCC in mice.\nWeigh each wild type (WT) and FBXO45-OE mice aged at 14 days.\nPrepare DEN.\nDilute the stock solution 40 times to obtain a working solution at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL.\nCalculate the dose of DEN based on the body weight of each mouse (25 mg/kg). For example: a 15 g mouse need to be injected with 150 μL of DEN working solution.\nNote: DEN is highly toxic, which is irritating to the eyes, skin and mucous membranes, and may cause liver and kidney damage by ingestion, skin absorption and inhalation. Operators should wear protective glasses and gloves to avoid direct contact with DEN, and keep the operation site well ventilated.\nLoad the 1 mL syringe with solution.\nNote: Tap the syringe and press the plunger slowly to expel the air, then set the syringe aside and wait for injection.\nDisinfect the abdomen surface of mice with 70% ethanol.\nGently Immobilize the mouse neck with index and thumb finger, while the pinky and ring finger are used to prevent them from moving.\nInject DEN solution or saline intraperitoneally at a 45° angle.\nNote: Generally, only 1/3 depth of the needle can be inserted for avoiding damage to the organs.\nNote: The injection volume is about 150–200 μL per mouse and prepare an extra 30 μL in case of any spillage.\nPrepare CCl4.\nCCl4 should be diluted on the day of administration. Mix thoroughly in the ratio of CCl4 stock solution: olive oil = 1: 4 to obtain a final concentration of 20%.\nCalculate the amount of CCl4 at a final concentration of 0.5 mL/kg.",
    "Note: CCl4 is a typical liver toxin with mild irritation of mucous membranes and anesthetic effects on the central nervous system. If once in contact with the skin, take off contaminated clothing immediately and rinse with plenty of running water, and seek medical attention.\nAt 4 weeks of age (two weeks after DEN injection), administer CCl4 or vehicle (olive oil) twice a week for additional 14 weeks.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nNote: Operation details are consistent with DEN injection.\nLeave mice for 6 weeks after the last injection of CCl4 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2491-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental design in FBXO45-OE and WT mouse induced by DEN/CCl4\nObtained with permission and modified from Lin et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: The health condition of mouse should be monitored daily after injection. If in poor status, give some supportive care such as melon and eggs.\nTissue sample collection\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes how to harvest tissues and collect the different liver pieces for each experimental condition.\nWeigh all the mice.\nAnaesthetize the mice with isoflurane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation.\nOptional: You can choose other anesthetics as chloral hydrate, Nembutal, etc, approved by the IACUC for human euthanasia.\nFix the mouse limbs on the dissecting board with pins.\nDisinfect the abdomen surface (70% ethanol).\nLift the skin with forceps and then cutting along the mid-line to open the abdomen and chest using surgical scissors.\nNote: In order not to affect the experimental operation and the observation of the experimental results, it is better to shave the abdominal fur of the mice.\nSeparate livers from mice quickly.",
    "Optional: If hepatocytes analysis is planned, high quality liver perfusion is essential before liver tissue collection. Deliver the perfusion solution into inferior cava vein using the peristaltic pump to flush the inside of the liver for 10 min. All liver lobes should turn white as erythrocytes drain from the organ. Reference to published standard protocols.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nRinse the liver with a 50 mL syringe filled with ice-cold 1×PBS.\nObserve and count the number of macroscopically visible liver tumors, measure the largest diameter with vernier calipers.\nCritical: Tissues harvesting should be done in a relatively short period of time.\nTake photos of the liver and tumor.\nNote: A ruler should be placed underneath to accurately represent the size of the tumor.\nRecord data of each mouse about body weight, liver weight, number and size of tumors, occurrence of liver metastasis.\nResect different liver lobes for downstream analysis.\nFor protein and RNA, store a piece of fresh tissues in liquid nitrogen.\nFor histochemistry, immerse a slightly larger piece of tissue in 10% formalin for 24 h and then placed in 70% ethanol for 24 h before paraffin embedding.\nNote: It is important to cut the same liver lobe from the same area in each tissue sample.\nOptional: Collect other tissues such as spleen, kidney, and pancreas if required for your experiment.\nPerform paraffin embedding and slide cutting 5 μm sections for subsequent histopathological assay.\nKeep the rest of sample in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nRNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis section describes RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and how to determine gene expression levels by qRT-PCR.\nPlace tissue sample into a 1.5 mL RNase-free and DNase-free EP tube.\nAdd 1 mL RNAiso Plus reagent and using a homogenizer to release the total RNA from the tissue.",
    "Note: RNAiso Plus contains a strong denaturant and should be avoided in contact with skin and clothing.\nAdd 200 μL chloroform to the tube, and vortex for 10 s with an oscillator.\nNote: Because chloroform is toxic, working in a fume hood when using.\nIncubate the suspension for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully into a new RNase-free and DNase-free EP tube.\nCritical: There are 3 layers. The middle layer is semi-solid containing DNA, and the bottom layer is a red-colored organic solvent containing proteins, polysaccharides, fatty acid, cell debris, and a small amount of DNA. Upper aqueous layer containing RNA. Do not aspirate to the lower layer, otherwise it will easily cause DNA/protein contamination and affects subsequent experiments.\nAdd an equal volume of pre-cooled isopropanol, reverse up and down several times.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to precipitate the RNA.\nNote: Store some isopropanol in the freezer 24 h before the RNA extraction.\nTo remove impurities from the RNA, add 1 mL DEPC water with 70% ethanol to the precipitate.\nPause point: The purified RNA should avoid repeated freeze-thawing and can be stored at −80°C for six months.\nSynthesize cDNAs by the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (https://www.takarabiomed.com.cn/DownLoad/RR047A.pdf[href=https://www.takarabiomed.com.cn/DownLoad/RR047A.pdf]) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPerform Relative fold-change in the expression of indicated genes by qRT-PCR using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (https://www.takarabiomed.com.cn/DownLoad/RR820A.pdf[href=https://www.takarabiomed.com.cn/DownLoad/RR820A.pdf]).\nNote: Calculate results based on the Ct value using the 2−ΔΔCt method. We use GAPDH as a stable housekeeping gene; Each reaction takes 3 technical replicates and should show minimal changes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2491_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2491_5.csv\nHematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining)\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This section describes the morphological and structural pathological changes of liver tissues in WT and FBXO45-OE mice.\nPlace the slides on a sectioning rack and bake in an oven at 65°C for 2–3 h to fully melt the paraffin wax.\nNote: The baking time should not be too short as it is difficult to completely melt the paraffin, which may lead to uneven coloring of the sections; nor should it be too long as it may inactivate the antigens in the tissue and lead to false negative results.\nQuickly dip the slides into 3 baths of xylene to deparaffinize 5 min each.\nTransfer the slides to 100% anhydrous ethanol twice in sequence for 2 min each time.\nHydrate slides with 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol 75% ethanol and distilled water in a concentration gradient.\nNote: Each bath for at least 3 min. And having 2 baths for each condition is better.\nNote: Reagents must be placed in the right order when hydrating.\nAdd an appropriate amount of hematoxylin to the section for about 30 s, terminate the staining with distilled water.\nWash off the excess hematoxylin with tap water 15 min.\nDrop the Eosin on the slides for about 15 s after the moisture is moderately removed with drying, terminate the staining with distilled water.\nWash off the excess eosin.\nTransfer the slides sequentially to 3 concentration gradients of 70%, 80% and 95% ethanol solution for 2 min each time.\nPut the slides into xylene and let it stand at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for about 5 min.\nDrop a small amount of neutral balsam on the tissue, cover it with a coverslip.\nLeave dry for at least 2 h to observe.\nNote: Slowly press down the coverslip from one side to avoid air bubbles.\nImmunohistochemistry staining assay (IHC)\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This section describes the quantification of the protein by antibody binding to the target antigen in the tissue.\nFollowing the above steps 33–36, deparaffinize, rehydrate the tissue slides.\nBoil the slides in 10 mM sodium citrate with pressure cooker at high pressure for 2.5 min.\nNatural cooling to room temperature (20°C–25°C), remove and wash the slides with PBS or distilled water for 5 min 3 times.\nNote: If the slides were removed from the autoclave into PBS immediately, the large temperature difference may cause the tissue to fall off completely or wrinkle.\nUsing the pap pen to draw a circle of appropriate size around the tissue.\nBlock in 3% hydrogen peroxide (diluted in distilled water) for 15 min in a wet box at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: The fluid should be over the edge of the tissue to adequately block endogenous peroxidase.\nDiscard blocking solution and wash with PBS for 5 min 3 times.\nIncubate with 5% goat serum (diluted in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd specific antibodies (diluted in PBS): anti-FBXO45 (1:300) and anti-Ki67 (1:800) to the tissue slides at 4°C overnight.\nWash in PBS 3 times for 5 min.\nIncubate with secondary antibody (Immunohistochemistry Detection Kit) at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 60 min.\nRepeat step 53.\nIncubate with horseradish peroxidase (Immunohistochemistry Detection Kit) at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 30 min.\nRepeat step 53.\nAdd 1–2 drops of DAB to the slides.\nNote: DAB has a certain degree of toxicity and must be operated with good protective measures.\nNote: It is best to observe the degree of color development under a microscope to determine the moment of termination.\nRepeat step 53.\nSubsequently, counterstain the slides with hematoxylin, and rinse with tap water 3 times for 5 min each time.\nRepeat steps 41–44.",
