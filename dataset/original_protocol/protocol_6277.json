    "Harvesting, grinding and preparation of leaf materialHarvest Arabidopsis thaliana leaf material and place into a 20 ml Polyvial (containing steel balls of three different diameters 3, 5, and 7 mm, two of each size in each 20 ml Polyvial) pre-cooled in liquid N2 and snap-freeze in liquid N2.Note: If the metabolites of interest have extremely fast turn-over time, plant material should be harvested by cutting rosettes and quenching them instantaneously in a bath of liquid N2 under the prevailing irradiance. The quenched material is then transferred into a 20 ml Polyvial (containing steel balls) pre-cooled in liquid N2. For an optimal grinding process, fill the vial to a maximum of 2/3 of its volume with the plant material. For NAF, 4 g of material is necessary, but it is recommended to harvest slightly more in order to have extra material to perform additional analysis in this material (such as quantification of metabolites, see section Data analysis–4). For homogenization, replace the plastic lids of the Polyvials by steel caps and place the Polyvials containing the leaf material into a pre-cooled steel grinding adapter for the Retsch mill (Figures 1A-1D).Note: Our grinding adapters and steel caps are custom-made for the 20 ml Polyvials. Alternatively, the grinding of the leaf material can be performed by using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle. Make sure that the leaf material is kept frozen during the whole procedure. Homogenize the tissue for 1 min at 25 Hz (two times) in the Retsch mill (Figures 1E and 1F).Note: Make sure that the ground tissue is very well homogenized (thin powder). We suggest grinding the leaf material twice for 1 min each at 25 Hz. Cool down the vials and adapters in between with liquid N2 to avoid thawing of the material.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191014/20191014200909_3477.jpgFigure 1. Grinding procedure. A.",
    "Cool down the Polyvials, steel grinding adapter, and steel caps in liquid nitrogen. B. Remove the plastic lid of the Polyvials and place the steel cap frozen. C. Use a capper/decapper machine (custom-made) to close the vial with the steel cap. D. Closed vial. E. Place the Polyvial inside steel grinding adapter. F. Place the grinding adapter in the Retsch mill and proceed as in Step A3. After grinding use the same capper/decapper machine for replacing the steel caps for the plastic lids. The samples can be stored at -80 °C or proceed to Step A4. Note that to avoid overheating of the vial, steel caps and grinding adapter deep them in liquid nitrogen or make use of dried ice while preparing a second sample.Weigh ~4 g of frozen tissue into a 50 ml Falcon tube pre-cooled in liquid N2.The samples can be stored at -80 °C for up to three months. Prepare as many Falcon tubes as necessary (each one will be used for one NAF).Note: Label the Falcon tubes and their corresponding lids. Record the weights of the empty Falcon tubes (with lids) and the precise amount of plant material weighed. Freeze dry the homogenate. To avoid losing leaf material during this process, remove the lid and cover the Falcon tubes with paper tissue (KimWipes) fixed with an elastic band. Place the tubes in a metal rack into the freeze drier at 0.02 bar and -80 °C for 5 days. Close the tubes with their corresponding lids immediately after removing them from the freeze drier. The dried material can be stored under vacuum in a desiccator protected from light and humidity up to 6 months.",
    "Note: In order to avoid thawing, place the Falcon tubes in a polystyrene box containing dry ice and replace the lids by the paper tissue while the Falcon tubes are in the box.  Determine the plant material dry weight by weighing the closed Falcon tubes after the freeze drying process.Preparation of solutions and filters Prepare the solutions for the NAF three days before starting the fractionation.Add the activated molecular sieve 4 Å to the Heptane (C7H16) and Tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4) solutions to ensure that no residual water is present.Prepare a mixture of Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane 66:34 (v/v); density = 1.3 g cm-3. Add the activated molecular sieve 4 Å and store the mixture protected from light in a brown glass bottle.Note: We usually use the ~100 ml of activated molecular sieve in a 1 L bottle. For 10 samples it is needed: a) 1 L of the Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane mixture 66:34 (v/v): 660 ml of Tetrachloroethylene + 340 ml of Heptane, b) 2 L of Heptane, c) 500 ml of Tetrachloroethylene. Before use always check the pH of the solutions with a pH paper, especially Tetrachloroethylene. pH should be neutral. If Tetrachloroethylene solution turns acidic, the dried leaf material will become brown during gradient centrifugation and the NAF will fail.Cut 15 cm x 15 cm the nylon filters (one per NAF), weigh them and store them in clean 50 ml Falcon tubes. Fractionation procedureNote: The whole procedure should be performed under a fume hood. Only dried aliquots (after Step C17) can be processed on regular bench. For pouring solutions, use glass pipettes.Resuspend the dried leaf material in 20 ml of the Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane = 66:34 (v/v) mixture.Ultrasonicate the suspension for 2 min, with 6 x 10 cycles, 65% of power (Figure 2).",
    "To avoid overheating the suspension during the sonication process, keep the Falcon tube in an ice bath.Note: Place the sonicator tip inside the solution, but avoid touching the tube wall. Make sure the sonication is successful. This is a critical step in the fractionation, since insufficient sonication can produce aggregates that do not pass through nylon mesh.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191014/20191014200956_6584.jpgFigure 2. Setup for the ultrasonication procedure. Note that to avoid overheating the suspension during the process, the Falcon tube should be kept in an ice bath.Fold a nylon mesh into a glass funnel placed on top of a 50 ml Falcon tube and pour the suspension through the nylon mesh. Wash the nylon mesh 3 x with 10 ml of heptane. Note: The first two washing steps are performed by slowly pouring heptane on the nylon mesh and collecting the flow through in the Falcon tube below. For the third washing step, remove all the residual solution in the nylon mesh by squeezing it (while wearing adequate gloves). Place the nylon mesh back in a 50 ml Falcon tube and continue at Step C16. Be careful that all liquid go through the nylon mesh. If it´s the case, filter the whole obtained mixture again through a fresh nylon mesh.  Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,200 x g and 4 °C, using a swing-out rotor. Discard the supernatant (by pouring it into a waste glass bottle) and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane = 66:34 (v/v) mixture.Transfer 100 µl of the well homogenized resuspended pellet into a 1.5 ml screw cap tube. This aliquot is named fraction 0 (F0) and corresponds to the unfractionated material. Prepare three aliquots, add 900 µl of C7H16 to each, and keep protected from the light and continue at Step C15.",
    "Note: Use a cut 200 µl pipette tip to collect F0. Homogenize well the mixture before taking each aliquot. Prepare the NAF gradient (Figure 3A): Linear gradient (30 ml, density from 1.43 to 1.62 g cm-3)With a Pasteur pipette fill the 50 ml Falcon tube A with Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane mixture and the 50 ml Falcon tube B with Tetrachloroethylene.The dispensing needle is placed above a waste container. Note: Ensure that there are no air bubbles in any tubing by purging thoroughly the whole system. Set the peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.15 ml min-1 and the following program:table:",

    "Notes:*After 3 ml, pause the program. This step is used to ensure that the first mixture reaches the end of the dispensing needle before starting the actual gradient. **Remove the waste container and place the Polyallomer tube at this step. The needle should be placed slightly over the bottom of the Polyallomer tube and slightly touching the side of the tube (Figure 3B). Re-start the program.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191014/20191014201537_4979.jpgFigure 3. Setup of the gradient pump and the mixer. A. Overview of the setup for preparing the NAF gradient. Solution A (Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane mixture) and solution B (Tetrachloroethylene). B. Detail of the bottom-up preparation of the gradient. Tube holder is a 50 ml falcon tube with paper support on the bottom to help holding the gradient tube.Take the needle carefully out from the gradient and place the Polyallomer tube in a rack. Apply the suspension from Step C4 to the gradient, very carefully with a Pasteur pipette. Touch the wall of the tube with the pipette slightly above the gradient and release carefully to avoid disturbing the gradient.Place the gradients in the appropriate tube buckets from the ultracentrifuge. Verify their weights and to counterbalance, adjust the weight by adding 100% C2Cl4.Centrifuge for 50 min at 5,000 x g, and 4 °C using a swinging bucket rotor. Note: We always use the Ultracentrifuge Beckman Coulter OptimaTM L80 XP and Swinging bucket rotor Beckman Coulter SW32Ti. Set the acceleration/deceleration on three. Place the gradient tubes in a rack and mark eight fractions. Figure 4 illustrates how we usually separate the fractions based on the color.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191014/20191014201608_4734.jpgFigure 4. NAF gradient after centrifugation. Usually, we separate eight fractions based on their color. The dark green layer is enriched in chloroplast and usually divided into two fractions (F2 and F3) to avoid metabolite overloading.",
    "Note that fraction 8 is a pellet, which is the vacuolar-enriched fraction.Transfer carefully each fraction into clearly labeled clean 50 ml Falcon tube by using Pasteur pipette. The fractions are collected starting from the upper part (F1) to the bottom (F8). After F7 is removed, the pellet is resuspended in 20 ml heptane and the mixture transferred to a clean 50 ml Falcon tube. Use a new pipette for each fraction.Note: Transferring the fractions is a critical point for the method, since at this step cross contamination of the fractions should be avoided as much as possible. Therefore, always transfer the fractions from the very top of each layer. Add heptane up to 20 ml to the Falcon tubes containing F1 to F8 and mix carefully. Centrifuge all Falcon tubes for 10 min at 3,200 x g and at room temperature. Discard the supernatant (by carefully pouring it into a waste glass bottle) and resuspend the pellet with 7 ml of Heptane.Note: The volume depends on how many aliquots you will need for your analysis. We usually prepare seven sub-aliquots per fraction. This number is enough for various metabolite analysis and determination of the compartment-specific markers. Transfer 6 x 1 ml from each suspension into 1.5 ml screw caps tubes. The pellet can easily re-aggregate at this step. Keep mixing by hand the solution while transferring into the tubes in order to obtain homogeneous aliquots from the same fraction.Note: Use a cut 1000 µl pipette tip to collect sub-aliquots from each fraction. As adding 7 ml generally does not allow to obtain seven aliquots of 1 ml, we generally take 0.8 ml for the seventh aliquot and clearly label the corresponding tube. Centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g and at room temperature. Discard excess of supernatant (c.a.",
    "900 µl) carefully, using a 1000 µl pipette tip. Process the F0 aliquots obtained in Step C5 in the same manner. Place the screw caps tubes containing the sub-aliquots open in racks inside of a desiccator connected to a vacuum pump. Also, place the open Falcon tubes containing the filters from Step C3. Keep the aliquots under vacuum and protected from light overnight.Close the tubes and store them at -80 °C until further process. Weigh the dried filters.Measurements of metabolite markersExtractionAdd to the dried aliquots a steel ball and 250 µl 80% ethanol/10 mM HEPES pH 7 to the samples.Place the tubes in a cooled (4 °C) holder for the ball mill and disrupt the pellet for 1 min at 25 Hz.Incubate in a thermomixer for 30 min at 95 °C and 1000 rpm.Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a 96-deep well plate and keep it protected from light and on ice.Add to the Pellet 150 µl 80% ethanol/10 mM HEPES pH 7.Incubate in a thermomixer for 30 min at 95 °C 1000 rpm.Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Transfer and combine with the previous supernatant. Add to the Pellet 250 µl 50% ethanol/10 mM HEPES pH 7.Incubate in a thermomixer for 30 min at 95 °C and 1,000 rpm.Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Transfer and combine with the previous two supernatants. It can be stored at -20 °C until further use.Nitrate (vacuolar marker)Nitrate content is determined following Cross et al. (2006). Nitrate can be used as a vacuolar marker in addition or alternatively to Acid Invertase.Note: Nitrite content must be determined and subtracted from the Nitrate values.",
