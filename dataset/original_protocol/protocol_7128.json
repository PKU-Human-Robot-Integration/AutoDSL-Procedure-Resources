    "Solution Preparation Prepare E3, methylene blue, and blue E3 solutions ahead of time. Recipes are provided at the end of this protocol.Animal handling Raise animals in accordance with local institutional animal care and usage committee recommendations. Take care to minimize stress to ensure the health of animals and maximize reproducibility of behavioral experiments.Five days before the planned start of a behavioral experiment, set up mating tanks of well-fed sexually mature adult zebrafish pairs in the afternoon or evening, with a divider separating the male and female fish. See Notes 1, 2, and 3 on experimental design.The next morning, remove the dividers and tip the tanks to encourage zebrafish mating.Collect zebrafish embryos in blue E3 embryo medium and rinse well with system water to remove debris.House zebrafish embryos in 100 mm × 15 mm Petri dishes, immersed in blue E3, with no more than 50 embryos per Petri dish, and raise under 14 h light: 10 h dark conditions at 28.5°C. Use embryos from large healthy clutches of greater than 100 embryos, so that comparisons can be made between experimental and control siblings.At 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), carefully check all Petri dishes and remove debris and unfertilized embryos, as these can cause undue stress and impact development and behavior.At 48 hpf, carefully check all Petri dishes and remove debris.At 72 hpf, carefully check all Petri dishes and remove chorion fragments from hatched embryos. Change blue E3 media to standard E3 media.At 4 dpf (~100-110 hpf), set up animals and reagents for video tracking experiment. First, check on the health of the zebrafish under a stereo microscope. Zebrafish should be swimming upright with inflated swim bladders (Figures 3 and 4A). Do not use larvae with an uninflated swim bladder, or larvae that are resting on their sides.",
    "Clutches with large numbers of larvae with uninflated swim bladders should not be used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4313/bioprotoc-12-03-4313-g003.jpgFigure 3. Example of a 5-dpf larval zebrafish with an inflated swim bladder. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4313/bioprotoc-12-03-4313-g004.jpgFigure 4. Workflow summary of animal handling. A. Step 8: Ensure that zebrafish larvae are healthy. B. Step 11: Gently transfer animals into 96-well plates. C. Step 12: Check that all animals are healthy under a stereo microscope, before placing the 96-well plate into the video tracking rig. D. Step 14: Seal the 96-well plate to prevent evaporation. A single zebrafish larva should be in each well. Red highlights indicate animals in which locomotor activity is detected by the video tracking system. Wells with air bubbles or more than one animal are excluded from analysis. Figure 4 was created with BioRender.com. White scale bar (inner well) ≈ 8.5 mm.Fill a 50 mL reagent reservoir with E3 medium heated to 28.5°C.Gently fill a flat-bottom square-well 96-well plate (with a volume of 650 μL per well) with 600 μL of E3 medium per well using a 12-channel pipette. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles into the wells, as they can create video tracking artifacts. See Note 4 on using drugs in the experimental design.Gently place a single healthy larva into each square well of the 96-well plate, using a disposable transfer pipette (Figure 4B).Using a stereo microscope, check each well to make sure all animals look healthy, are upright, and have an inflated swim bladder (Figure 4C).Add E3 medium to each well, so that it bulges on top of each well, but not so much that the surface tension breaks and pools with neighboring wells.Seal the 96-well plate with an optical adhesive film using a seal applicator.",
    "The type of film used to seal the plate is very important, as some seals prevent O2 permeability or are toxic in some other way.  The E3 medium will spill over the sides of the 96-well plate, but if done carefully, there should be no bubbles in most of the wells. An image of a well-sealed plate is shown below (Figure 5). See Note 5 on using seals in the experimental design. Alternative steps:  Steps 13 and 14 can be omitted, in which case E3 medium should be added to the top of each well, without creating bulges. This is important for the video tracker, to accurately track animal movements. Due to evaporation, fresh E3 medium should be added to each well each day. We usually perform this soon after the lights turn on in the morning. Working with open plates (Video 1) is useful when access to the fish during the experiment is required (e.g., for adding drugs to the wells during an experiment).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Example of an un-sealed 96-well plate monitored using the Quantization mode with the following parameters: detection sensitivity, 25; burst (threshold for large movements), 900; freeze (threshold for no movement), 10; integration period (bin size), 60 s.Double-click to play video. Red highlights indicate animals in which locomotor activity is detected by the video tracking system.Video tracking experiment We use the ZebraBox, a commercial video tracking system from Viewpoint Life Sciences, Inc., to monitor zebrafish behavior from 4-8 dpf. Newer versions of the ZebraBox have been developed since the referenced article was published (Lee et al., 2017), and here we provide guidelines for using the fourth generation Zebrabox (latest version as of Spring 2021 of this writing).",
    "Like previous versions, the fourth generation Zebrabox contains an enclosed system, a high-resolution camera fitted with a fixed-angle lens, and a filter that transmits infrared light. White light illumination levels for standard behavioral experiments are set at ~1,200 lux during the day. We use a customized chamber that allows the 96-well plate to be immersed in recirculating water at 28.5°C, to maintain a constant and optimal temperature, which is essential for robust sleep/wake cycles (see Note 6). ZebraBoxes should be in a quiet and climate-controlled room, to ensure reproducibility of behavioral experiments. Video tracking data from two Zebraboxes can be recorded by a single computer, allowing for the simultaneous use of two 96-well plates in parallel.Prior to placing a 96-well plate inside the ZebraBox, ensure that the distilled water within the chamber is clean and continuously recirculating at 28.5°C. This is important because floating debris in the water may produce movement artifacts in the video tracking data.Place a 96-well plate inside the ZebraBox chamber and ensure that the plate is secure and not floating.Open the video tracking software (ZebraLab; Viewpoint Life Sciences) on the computer accompanying the ZebraBox.For most experiments, we use the Quantization mode with the following parameters: detection sensitivity: 25; burst (threshold for large movements): 900; freeze (threshold for no movement): 10; integration period (bin size): 60 s (Video 1). However, these values are only guidelines and must be empirically determined for each ZebraBox.Determining the values of these parameters involves calibration of the signal-to-noise ratio with a focus on false positive signal reduction. To this end, one can either increase the detection sensitivity value (i.e., the change in pixel intensity that is required for that pixel to register as having changed its value) or increase the freezing threshold (i.e.",
    ", the number of pixels per location that need to change from one frame to the next, for that location to be considered as registering a movement). The detection sensitivity and freezing threshold must be calibrated empirically for each ZebraBox. To determine these values, we use a 96-well plate containing both freely-swimming larvae and larvae that are anesthetized using 0.016% w/v tricaine, and record them for 1-3 h at each detection sensitivity and freezing threshold value (fish thus anesthetized will last for up to 8 hours without decomposition). Then, we analyze the data to identify the levels of false positive signals that are generated by the anesthetized fish with each of these parameters. In our hands, occasional values under 0.5 s of “movement” (for 60 s bins) from anesthetized fish has been an acceptable false positive signal. If higher levels are observed, increasing the sensitivity value or the freezing threshold can reduce the noise; however, this will also reduce the ability to detect real movements from the non-anesthetized fish. If a video tracker requires much higher detection sensitivity/freezing values than those mentioned here to ensure low levels of noise, we recommend servicing the machine.Open the grid interface, which overlays each well with a green box. Align the grid interface with the square wells of the 96-well plate (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4313/bioprotoc-12-03-4313-g005.jpgFigure 5. Example of the grid interface (green) that overlays the separate areas where behavior will be monitored (main figure). The PCR adhesive seal was applied from left to right on top of the plate. Most of the bubbles appear on the side where the seal was initially applied. Wells marked with an asterisk will be excluded from analysis due to the presence of air bubbles or multiple animals, respectively. Examples of such wells are enlarged and shown on the left.",
    "Red highlights indicate animals in which locomotor activity is detected by the video tracking system. White scale bar (inner well) ≈ 8.5 mm.Program the white lights to turn on and off at the desired times. We typically set them to turn on at 9 a.m. and off at 11 p.m., since these are the lighting conditions under which the animals have been raised. The chamber is continuously illuminated with infrared light to allow for video tracking regardless of whether the white lights are on or off.Program the length of the experiment on the ZebraLab software interface. Behavioral experiments typically begin at 4 dpf and end at 7 dpf.Save the ZebraLab software protocol for each experiment in a folder on your computer. Name and save the raw data files that will be generated.Start the behavioral experiment using the ZebraLab software user interface.Allow the behavioral experiment to run its planned time course (e.g., 48-72 h).End the behavioral experiment on ZebraLab and allow the data to compile. A large .CSV or .XLS file is generated that contains locomotor activity and inactivity raw data. Take a screenshot of the green grid overlay on the 96-well plate as a quality control step, to ensure that the data collected for each well was confined to its assigned well and has not shifted to overlap with a neighboring well.Remove the 96-well plate from the ZebraBox and inspect it using a stereo microscope. Note wells that contain bubbles or animals that appear to be unhealthy (e.g., uninflated swim bladder), and exclude these wells from analysis.Genotype the animals using PCR or, if applicable, based on the presence or absence of a fluorescent marker using a fluorescent stereo microscope. See Notes 7 and 8 for relevant comments on experimental design."
