    "1. Preparation of Microplate and Sensor Cartridge on the Day Prior to Running the Assay\nIslets were isolated from three year old Japanese macaques as previously described13. This method is very similar to that used to isolate human islets from cadaver donors, but differs from mice, in which pancreata are often inflated with collagenase solution while the animal is under sedation and prior to organ removal. Islet retrieval was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) and Oregon Health and Science University and were approved by the ONPRC IACUC. The ONPRC abides by the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health.\nPreparation of Spheroid Microplate\n\t\nPrepare 3 mL of a 0.1M solution of sodium bicarbonate. Filter sterilize the solution. We utilized a 0.45 µm filter (Table of Materials).\nIn a cell culture hood, add 200 µL of cell and tissue adhesive (Table of Materials) to 2.8 mL of 0.1M sodium bicarbonate. Then, add 20 µL of this solution to the bottom of each well of the 96-well spheroid microplate (Table of Materials). Ensure that air bubbles are removed from the pipet tip and only the bottom of the plate is covered. Coating of the microplate prevents islets from moving up the sides of the wells when drugs are added and mixed into the well during the assay.",
    "NOTE: It is only necessary to coat as many wells as will be used for islets when the assay is run. If only a few wells will be used, the cell adhesive solution can be scaled down appropriately. The cell adhesive used in the assay is a formulated protein solution extracted from the marine mussel. Alternatively, microplate wells can be coated with 20 µL of 100 µg/mL poly-D-lysine.\nIncubate the plate in a 37 °C, non-CO2 incubator for one hour.\nIn a sterile environment, aspirate cell adhesive solution from the plate. Wash each well two times with 400 µL of 37 °C sterile water using a multichannel pipet. Allow to air dry.\nAfter 30-40 minutes, cover the plate and store overnight at 4 °C.\nHydration of the Sensor Cartridge\n\t\nIn a sterile environment, open the sensor cartridge package (Table of Materials) and remove the contents. Place the sensor cartridge upside down next to the utility plate.\nFill each well of the utility plate with 200 µL sterile water and lower the sensor cartridge back into the utility plate. Place assembled sensor cartridge and utility plate in a 37 °C, non-CO2 incubator overnight.\nPreparation of Calibrant\n\t\nAliquot 25 mL of calibrant (Table of Materials) into a 50 mL conical tube. Place tube in a 37 °C, non-CO2 incubator overnight.\n2. Protocol for Media Preparation, Loading of Islets, and Loading of Sensor Cartridge on the Day of Assay\nPreparation of media\n\t\nTo 48.5 mL of base media (minimal DMEM, see Table of Materials), add 500 µL each of 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine. Additionally, add 496 µL of 200 mg/ml glucose (final concentration of glucose in the media is 5.5 mM).",
    "NOTE: Baseline glucose concentration was kept constant for these experiments. However, glucose can also be used to stimulate respiration in addition to the pharmacologic manipulations described blow10.\nConfirm that the pH is 7.4 +/- 0.1, adjusting if necessary.\nPreparation of sensor cartridge\n\t\nTake sensor cartridge out of incubator, remove sensor cartridge lid, and dump out water from wells. Place 200 mL of pre-warmed calibrant into each well and replace sensor cartridge lid.\nPlace sensor cartridge back in incubator for about 1 hour (until needed).\nPreparation of drugs for mitochondrial stress assay\n\t\nOpen the stress test kit (Table of Materials) and remove the contents. Make up stock and working solutions for Oligomycin, Carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and Rotenone/Antimycin A (AA) as follows.\n\t\t\nOligomycin: add 630 µL of assembled media to tube to make 100 µM stock. Then, dilute to 45 µM with media to obtain port concentration (final well concentration after injection will be 4.5 µM)\nFCCP: add 720 µL of assembled media to tube to make 100 µM stock. Dilute to 10 µM with media to obtain port concentration (final well concentration will be 1 µM)\nNOTE: BSA and/or FBS should not be added to media, as this can affect the action of mitochondrial uncouplers14.\nRotenone/AA: add 540 µL of assembled media to tube to make 50 µM stock. Dilute to 25 µM with media to obtain port concentration (final well concentration will be 2.5 µM)\nNOTE: The above concentrations have produced consistent results in our hands. Additional FCCP led to no further increase in respiration. However, drug concentrations may need to be adjusted depending on islet size, and especially with islets from different species or non-islet spheroids. For reference, the average diameter of a non-human primate islet is about 150 µm15.\nPreparation of spheroid plate and transfer of islets",
    "Hand-pick pancreatic islets into a 60 mm x 15 mm cell culture dish containing assembled media to obtain near 100% purity.\nNOTE: Islets should appear rounded, with a clearly defined periphery, and appear denser than exocrine tissue contaminants. Avoid islets that appear damaged or frayed. In this experiment, islet size was not directly measured, although we attempted to pick islets of approximately equivalent size for each well and sample.\nLoad each well of spheroid microplate with 175 µL of assembled media using a multichannel pipette.\nUsing a P20 pipette set to 15 µL, aspirate 15 islets from cell culture dish. Islets should be visible in the pipette tip to the naked eye.\nTo transfer islets to spheroid microplate, lower pipette tip to the bottom of the well, barely lift up, and slowly pipette out a very small volume (~5 µL). Confirm that all islets have left the pipette tip. Each well should receive 15 islets. Occasionally check spheroid microplate under the microscope to verify that islets are at the bottom of each well rather than stuck to the sides.\nNOTE: Avoid loading the corner wells with islets. Oxygen and pH flux out of the plastic can occur during the assay, and this is exacerbated in the four corner wells.\nOnce all islets have been transferred to the spheroid microplate, incubate the microplate in a 37 °C, non-CO2 incubator while completing the steps below.\nLoading the sensor cartridge and running the assay",
    "Remove sensor cartridge from incubator. Ports A-C for each well must be loaded with either drug or media. Wells containing islets and the four corner wells should be loaded with drug. Non-corner wells without islets should be loaded with media. Port D can be left empty. Load port A (top left of each sensor) with 20 µL of oligomycin or media. Load port B (top right) with 22 µL of FCCP or media. Load port C (bottom left) with 25 µL of Rotenone/AA or media.\nProgram an extracellular flux analyzer assay for a 30 minute baseline respiration period (5 cycles of 3 minute mix, 3 minute measure), 42 minute oligomycin measurement period (7 cycles of 3 minute mix, 3 minute measure), 30 minutes FCCP (5 cycles of 3 minute mix, 3 minute measure), and 30 minutes Rotenone/AA (5 cycles of 3 minute mix, 3 minute measure).\nRun the assay and follow instructions on screen for calibrating the sensor and inserting the microplate.\nSubscription Required.
