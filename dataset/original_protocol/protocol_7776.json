    "Injection of anterograde or retrograde tracerPrepare the tracer solution and all equipment needed (scissors, surgical knife, syringe needles etc).Note: BDA and Alexa488-CTb are used as an anterograde or retrograde tracer, respectively. Spin down tracer solutions before use.Anesthetize an animal with 3.5% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg body weight, i.p.).Check the animal being anesthetized by loss of righting reflex and lack of response to hitching its paws.Place the anesthetized animal on stereotaxic instrument with locking the nose and ears.Note: First, insert the auxiliary ear bar into the mouse ear canal and fix it tightly, but be careful not to insert it too deeply to injure the inner ear. Next, align the vertical level of the nose clamp and hook the mouse tooth on it, and then hold down the nose. Check whether the mouse head do not move wobbly to finish fixation.Shave the hair and incise the scalp along the rostro-caudal axis.Clip the incised scalp using syringe needles bent into a hook and remove lamina.Note: To remove lamina, snick it by scissors and wipe the surface of the skull bone by surgical cottons.Using a surgical knife cut the skull bone and make a square hole at the position of tracer injection.Prepare a glass pipette using a puller.Fill a glass pipette with ~1 μl of the tracer solution by a capillary phenomenon and attach it to a tube connected with a pneumatic pump.Note: If the tip of the pipette is too fine to draw the tracer solution by a capillary phenomenon, snap the tip slightly. Moreover, too fine tip often prevents smooth injection as tiny concomitants get jammed in the pipette.Position the tip of the glass pipette on the bregma and then stereotaxically insert the pipette into the target region.Note: To make injection space, insert the pipette 0.",
    "1 mm deeper and turn back to the target region.Inject the tracer solution by air pressure at 10 psi with 5 sec intervals for 1 min.Leave the pipette inserted for 15 min, and then pull out it carefully.Replace the removed skull bone on the square hole and suture the scalp.Note: Instant glue is used for closing incision site as substitute for a surgical suture.Release and place the animal back into a home cage.Keep the animal for several days until fixation.Note: Determine the period of survival depending on the distance of projection. In our experiments (between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA)), BDA-injected and Alexa488-CTb-injected animals are incubated for at least 4 and 2 days, respectively (Kudo et al., 2012).Perfusion and section preparationPlace a beaker containing 4% PFA fixative solution (100 ml for each mouse) in ice bath. Set on peristaltic pump a silicone tube with one end put into the fixative beaker and the other end equipped with a 25 G syringe needle.Prepare all equipment needed (scissors, forceps, syringe needles to impale hands/feet etc).Run the peristaltic pump and fill up tubes and the syringe needle with the fixative solution.Deeply anesthetize the animal with overdosed pentobarbital (100 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.).After confirming the animal asleep, impale the animal’s hands and feet on a cork board with syringe needles.Open the abdominal cavity by horizontal cutting of the belly skin and muscles. Then cut the skin of the chest along the midline up to the jaw, and detach the skin from the chest wall.Cut the diaphragm to open the thoracic cavity, and then cut both sides of the chest wall to expose the heart. It is important not to injure the internal thoracic artery, which runs vertically along the sternum.",
    "Snick the wall of the right auricle by sharp scissors or the pit of syringe needle, and prick the left ventricle with a syringe needle connecting to the fixative beaker.Start transcardial perfusion for 10 min, so that 3 fixative volumes of the body weight run in 10 min.Excise a fixed brain and post-fix it for 2 h. Using a razor blade, divide the brain into two blocks with one containing a tracer-injected site and another containing neural regions of interest.Note: In our experiments, we divided the brain into two parts containing the BST and VTA, respectively, by coronal cutting between the hypothalamus and mammillary body (Kudo et al., 2012).Prepare sections of the fixed brain (50 μm in thickness) using a microslicer, whose buffer bath is filled with 0.1 M PB.Note: Especially in free-floating in situ hybridization experiment, the fixed brain block and sections should be kept in PB. When PBS is used for buffer, detection sensitivity of mRNA signal tends to be lowered.Collect sections in 24-well plate and store in 0.1 M PB containing 0.1% sodium azide.Anterograde tracing combined with fluorescence immunohistochemistryNote: This method is used to determine neurochemical properties of axon terminals, which are projected from anterograde tracer-injected regions. Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluTs) and vesicular inhibitory transporter (VIAAT) are frequently used as excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic and glycinergic) terminal markers, respectively (Kudo et al., 2012; Figure 1 in this manual). By using other neurochemical markers for combination with anterograde tracing, one can also determine whether the projection is cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, histeminergic, or peptidergic. Prepare sections from BDA-injected brains.Select sections containing the injected region and visualize BDA signals by incubation in Alexa Flour 594-conjugated streptavidin (1:500 in PBS) for 10 min. Photograph the injection site of BDA using a fluorescence microscope.",
    "Submerge 1~3 sections for neurochemical testing in a 10 ml tube containing PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 10 min. Block with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS for 20 min.Note: Blocking and antibody solutions are ~0.5 ml per tube, and washing solutions are ~10 ml per tube in each wash. Solution exchange is efficient by using aspirator, but should be carefully done not to aspirate or dry up sections.Incubate in primary antibody solution (1 μg/ml in PBS-T) overnight.Wash with PBS-T for 5 min three times.Incubate in fluorophore-linked secondary antibody solution (1:200 in PBS-T) for 2 h for neurochemical marker detection.Wash with PBS-T for 5 min three times.Wash with PBS briefly.Incubate in Alexa Flour 594-conjugated streptavidin (1:500 in PBS) for 10 min for BSA detection.Wash with PBS for 5 min three times.Mount sections on glass slides, make coverslip, and observe using a fluorescence microscope.Note: Images are captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope, digitized at 12 bit resolution into an array of 640 x 640 pixels (pixel size, 0.1 μm). To investigate the neurochemical characteristic of BDA-labeled axon terminals, take images (x60 magnifications, x3 zoom) of the traced region from each slice. For analysis, we counted terminal marker-positive boutons whose center point matched with that of BDA labeling. Bouton-like structures which are only labeled with BDA are often observed. If they are not labeled with other terminal markers, they should not be used for counting (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130814/20130814190008_9596.jpgFigure 1. Combined anterograde tracer labeling and immunofluorescence. BDA is injected into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and anterogradely transported to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In sections containing the VTA, BDA staining (red) and immunofluorescence for type 2 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT2; green) and vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT; blue) are performed.",
    "Images are used for counting (x60 magnifications, x3 zoom). VGluT2-positive BDA axon terminals (arrows) and VIAAT-positive BDA axon terminals (arrowheads) are identified as glutamatergic and GABAergic afferents from the BST, respectively. Scale bars: 10 μm.Retrograde tracing combined with free-floating fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) Note: This method is used to determine neurochemical properties of neurons, which project their axons to retrograde tracer-injected regions. It is recommended to prepare sections and start FISH incubation on the same day, because detection sensitivity is drastically decreased after sectioning. Expression of VGluTs and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (or VIAAT) mRNAs are used to determine the neurochemical properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively (Kudo et al., 2012; Figure 2 in this paper). Prepare sections from Alexa488-CTb-injected brains.Check the injection site of Alexa488-CTb using a fluorescence microscope.Submerge a single section in a 10 ml tube containing PB.Note: It is recommended that one tube is used for one section, because more than two sections per tube decrease reaction sensitivity. For free-floating FISH, solutions for hybridization, antibody reaction, inactivation of peroxidases, fluorescence detection and counterstaining are ~0.5 ml per tube, and washing solutions are ~10 ml per tube in each wash. Solution exchange is efficient by using aspirator, but should be carefully done not to aspirate or dry up sections.Acetylate sections with 0.25% acetic anhydrate in 0.1 M triethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0) for 10 min.Note: Prepare the solution at time of use.Prehybridize in hybridization buffer for 1 h.Hybridize in hybridization buffer supplemented with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA probes at a dilution of 1:1,000, performed at 63.5 °C for 12 h.Note: Preparation of DIG-labeled cRNA probes is described in previous our reports (Kudo et al., 2012; Yamasaki et al., 2010). Hybridization is performed in a hybridization oven. Cover the tube tip with parafilm to avoid drying off.",
    "Wash with 5x SSC for 30 min, 4x SSC containing 50% formamide (Formamide 1) for 40 min, 2x SSC containing 50% formamide (Formamide 2) for 40 min and 0.1x SSC for 15 min, performed at 61 °C.Note: Solutions are prewarmed at 61 °C in hot bath, and washing steps are performed in hot bath.Incubate in 0.1x SSC for 15 min, NTE buffer for 20 min, 20 mM iodoamide in NTE buffer for 20 min, NTE buffer for 10 min and TNT buffer for 10 min, performed at room temperature (RT).Note: All subsequent steps are performed at RT.Block sections with DIG blocking buffer for 30 min and 0.5% TSA blocking buffer for 30 min.Incubate in peroxidase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody in DIG blocking buffer (1:1,000) for 2 h.Wash with TNT buffer for 15 min twice.Detect signals for peroxidase using Cy3-TSA plus amplification kit system (see Recipe 20) for 10 min, performed in shade.Wash with TNT buffer for 5 min three times.For inactivation of residual peroxidase activities, incubate in 3% H2O2 in TNT buffer for 30 min.Note: This inactivation step is important to enhance contrast of signals. If this step is skipped, background signals remain strong as well as true-positive signals.Wash with TNT buffer for 5 min three times.Check the fluorescence signals for target mRNAs using a fluorescence microscope.Note: Because the fluorescence of Alexa488-CTb becomes weak and readily extincts after hybridization and the post-hybridization wash, the tracer should be detected by immunofluorescence using anti-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody, as shown in Procedure III.After immunofluorescence for Alexa488-CTb, counterstain with TOTO-3 (1:50 in PBS) for 20 min.Mount sections on glass slides and observe using a fluorescence microscope.Note: To investigate the neurochemical composition of retrogradely traced neurons, collect tiled images to cover the whole traced region (x20 magnifications, x1.",
    "3 zoom), and counted the number of positive cells having the nucleus (show TOTO-3 signal) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130814/20130814190207_0206.jpgFigure 2. Combined retrograde tracer labeling and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Alexa488-CTb is injected into the VTA and retrogradely transported to the BST. In sections containing the BST, immunofluorescence for Alexa Fluor 488 (green), fluorescence in situ hybridization for GAD mRNA (red) and counterstaining by TOTO-3 (blue) are performed. The top image is a part of tiled image used for counting (x20 magnifications, x1.3 zoom) and bottom images are higher magnification (x60 magnifications, x1.0 zoom). Neurons co-labeled for GAD mRNA and CTb (arrows) are identified as VTA-projecting GABAergic neurons. Scale bar: top, 100 μm; bottom, 30 μm."
