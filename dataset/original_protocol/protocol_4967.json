    "Constructing shRNA library to target putative human Epithelial Integrity Regulating genes (hEIR)shRNAs were designed to target the first and/or longest ENSEMBL transcript of each hEIR gene and 1-3 shRNA target sequences were chosen per transcript. Altogether, 136 shRNA oligos corresponding to the selected optimal target sequences (1-3 per gene) were cloned first into a pENTR cloning vector and thereafter to pDSL_UGIH lentiviral shRNA vector. Additionally 40 shRNA in pLKO lentiviral vector and 43 shRNAmirs in the pGIPZ mir-30 based vector were acquired to fully cover the previously selected target genes. Further information on the shRNA library designed to target epithelial integrity regulating genes can be found in Marques et al. (2016).Production of lentiviral particlesLentiviral vectors are transfected to 293ft cells growing in ultra adherent 24-well plates. 200,000 cells in 1 ml DMEM per well seeded one day prior transfections. Details below:Lentiviral vector mix: selected transfer plasmid (shRNA expression vector): Delta 8.9 (packaging): pCMV-VSVg (envelope) are mixed in a weight concentration ratio of 4:3:2 (tot. 10 μg; 4.44 μg, 3.33 μg, 2.22 μg) in 25 μl of 150 mM NaCl and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Transfection: 1 μl JetPEI is mixed with 25 μl of 150 mM NaCl, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Lentiviral vector mix and transfection reagent JetPEI are mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature and dropwise added to the cells. The volume of media at the time of transfection is 0.5 ml.Transfected cells are incubated for at least 4 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 after which 0.5 ml of fresh media is added per well, making a total volume of 1 ml.After 72 h of incubation, viruses are harvested by filtering the media through a 0.45 μm filter.",
    "Occasionally viruses are produced in 6-well plates and the following formula is used: 293ft 1 million cells, 100 μl of 150 mM NaCl and 6 μl of JetPEI.MCF10A cells lentiviral infectionMCF10A cells are seeded in 6-well plates aiming for a 50-60% confluence (3-4 x 105 cells per well) with 2 ml of MCDB170 + supplements media.Following day, media is changed and cells are washed with PBS. Afterwards medium and freshly harvested virus is added to cells in the ratio 1:1 (in a 6-well plate format add 500 μl viral suspension to 500 μl media). Polybrene is added to the cells at a ratio of 1:1,000 (8 μg/μl).After incubating the cells with the viruses and polybrene for 10 min at 37 °C, plates are centrifuged at 770 x g for 30 min at room temperature for virus transduction improvement.Cells are further incubated for a minimum of 4 h, after which media containing virus particles is to be replaced by 2 ml of fresh media.Cell collection for assays72 h post-infection MCF10A cells are either lysed for RT-qPCR and/or Western blot analysis for knockdown efficiency analysis or seeded into Matrigel® for 3D culture assays.shRNA knockdown validationRT-qPCR: Cells are lysed using the buffer supplied in the RNeasy kit and subsequent RNA isolation is performed using the kit buffers and instructions.Western blot: Cells are lysed in 40 μl of ELB lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (1/2 tablet [Complete Mini and PhosphoStop] per 10 ml of buffer).Setting up 3D culture for shRNA transduced MCF10A cellsMatrigel® should be thawed overnight at 4 °C on ice. 8-chamber slides, pipets and pipet tips should be precooled at 4 °C for at least 1 h before starting the experiment.Each chamber is coated with 31 μl of Matrigel at 4 °C.",
    "Matrigel should be applied in a concentric way, avoiding contact with the chamber walls and the formation of bubbles. Matrigel-coated slides are incubated for 20-30 min at 37 °C to solidify the Matrigel. While Matrigel solidifies, shRNA transduced MCF10A growing cells should be trypsinized, counted and evaluated for viability. 1,500 viable cells are seeded per chamber on top of the Matrigel. Cells can be diluted in 20 μl to 400 μl of media, depending on the original concentration of viable cells in suspension. Media should be refreshed to the 3D cultures every third day, by carefully aspirating the old media and pipetting 400 μl of new media into the individual chambers.Fixing 3D cultured cellsMedia is removed and cells are washed twice with 400 μl of PBS.200 μl of 2% PFA is used to fix the cells for 20 min at room temperature.After fixation, cells are washed twice with 400 μl of PBS at room temperature.If 3D cultures are not immunostained on the same day, cells can be stored for a couple of days (maximum time advised would be one week). This should be done at 4 °C, keeping the cells in the last PBS wash and using the 8-chamber slides lids to avoid dehydration of the samples.Immunostaining of the 3D cultures3D cultures are permeabilized in their chambers for 10 min at room temperature using 200 μl of 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS.Permeabilized 3D cultures are incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of blocking solution (immunofluorescence [IF] buffer with 10% normal goat serum) for 1-1.5 h.Primary antibodies are diluted in the blocking solution and added in 150 μl volume to each 3D cultures chambers (Antibodies concentration ranges from 1:50 to 1:500, see Notes for further information).Primary antibodies are incubated overnight at 4 °C using the 8-chamber slides lids.",
    "Cells are washed for three times with 400 μl of IF buffer at room temperature. Each wash performed for 20 min in a rocker at moderate speed. Afterwards cells in 3D cultures are incubated at room temperature for 45 min in 150 μl of the appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibody diluted in the blocking solution (In a concentration ranging from 1:150 to 1:1,000, see Notes for further information). 3D cultures are subsequently washed two times with 400 μl of IF buffer at room temperature.Nuclei are counterstained for 15 min with 150 μl of Hoechst 33258 (1:10,000 in PBS) and washed one more time with 400 μl of IF buffer at room temperature. After immunostainings, the 3D cultures are mounted by carefully removing the chamber and glue keeping them attached to the microscope slide. The coverslip is mounted with few drops of Immu-Mount reagent. Imaging of 3D culturesThe formation of MCF10A structures should be monitored with a light microscope during the 3D cultures development (every other day is advised).Images for the morphometric analysis are acquired with an inverted epifluorescence microscope coupled with apotome system equipped with a 20x Plan objective (Figure 2).Cellular response (for example, Ki67, active caspase 3) and epithelial integrity markers (for example, α6-integrin, GM130, Desmoglein, Desmoplakin ZO-1) should be studied with higher resolution imaging using confocal microscopy. For further high-resolution morphological studies and 3D reconstructions, Z-stacks can be acquired from MCF10A structures and assembled into videos and 3D deconvolutions (Videos 1 and 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

    "3D structure reconstruction from the previously shown Z-stack   Analyses of the imagesOpen images using ImageJ software for morphometric analyses. Use software Image menu to convert images to 16-bit type. Image threshold should be manually adjusted (Image menu, adjust submenu). Threshold protocol allows one to enhance the binary contrast to better visualize the borders of the structures for computational quantifications. Visual side-by-side inspection of the original and thresholded images is essential to validate the authentic character of processed images (Figure 2).If the thresholding process fuses neighboring 3D structures, a Pen tool should be used to separate shapes that are obviously individual shapes in the original image. The images are analyzed for the morphometric parameters area and circularity. These and other shape descriptors can be found under analyze menu, set measurements submenu.At least 30 structures per genotype should be analyzed for the shape parameters (area and circularity). Example data are shown in Figure 3.The protocols for confocal image analyses of different cellular responses and epithelial integrity alterations are described in Marques et al. (2016)."
