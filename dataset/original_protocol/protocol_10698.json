    "1. Transformation of Yeast Cells with the Biosensors\nTransform the desired yeast strain with plasmid bearing mito-roGFP or mitGO-ATeam2 using the lithium acetate method27.\nTo confirm transformation with the plasmid-borne biosensor and to prevent loss of the plasmid, select and maintain transformants on the appropriate selective synthetic complete medium (SC-Ura for mito-roGFP, or SC-Leu for mitGo-ATeam2). If the fluorescent probe has been subcloned in a different plasmid than those described here, use the appropriate selective medium. Visualize transformants by fluorescence microscopy to confirm that they express the fluorescent biosensor and exhibit normal mitochondrial morphology.\n2. Growth of Cells and Preparation for Imaging\nCell function and response to drug treatment are highly dependent on cell density and metabolic activity. Best results are obtained when cells are actively dividing (mid-log phase, ~0.5 - 1 x 107 cells/ml). The most reliable way to generate mid-log phase cultures of consistent density is to inoculate from a stationary-phase pre-culture.\nPrepare a stationary-phase pre-culture: pick a single colony of transformed cells from a plate and inoculate selective liquid media (5 ml in a 50 ml conical-bottom tube). Grow at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm (OD600) has reached a plateau (24-48 hr).",
    "Prepare a mid-log phase culture for observation: use the appropriate volume of pre-culture to inoculate 5 ml of selective media in a 50 ml conical-bottom tube. YPD media is autofluorescent and should not be used for these studies. Use synthetic complete, glucose based, dropout (SC-Ura) media. Grow cells at 30 °C, shaking at 225 rpm, for 4-16 hr, until they reach mid-log phase (~0.5 - 1 x 107 cells/ml). Cell density can be determined by measuring OD600; calibrate the spectrophotometer to determine the correct OD600 reading. On our Beckman DU530 (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN), mid-log phase corresponds to an OD600 of 0.1-0.3.\nMito-roGFP1 senses fluctuations in the organelle in response to metabolic changes. For example, in this assay mitochondrial redox state changes when yeast grow on fermentable carbon sources (e.g. glucose, as in SC media) versus non-fermentable carbon sources (e.g. glycerol, as in SGlyc media), and even in different batches of the same media. Therefore, use the same batch of media for all experiments.\nCells are ready for concentration (see step 2.4) and imaging if no treatment is being performed. If cells are being treated, incubate cells with the appropriate treatment and continue to the next step.\nConcentrate 1 ml of culture by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 15 sec and resuspension of the cell pellet in 20 μl of media. These conditions maximize the number of distinguishable cells in the field of view.",
    "Apply 2 μl of the resuspended cells to a slide. Cover with a coverslip (No. 1.5, preferably high-performance 170±5 μm thickness), and seal the edges of the coverslip with clear nail polish or valap (see Reagents). To seal with valap, melt a small amount on a metal spatula by holding it over a Bunsen burner flame, then spread a small amount along the edges of the coverslip.\nMaintain cells at 30 °C during imaging. An objective heater on the 100x oil immersion lens used for imaging works well for this application. Under these conditions, mitochondrial morphology, redox state and ATP levels remain unchanged during imaging for 10-15 min.\n3. Imaging Setup\nSetup for imaging mito-roGFP1 on a wide-field fluorescence microscope\n The steps here are tailored to the AxioObserver.Z1 microscope equipped with a Colibri LED excitation source, a wide-field Orca ER camera and Axiovision acquisition software. Photobleaching of both channels and photoconversion of oxidized mito-roGFP1 is reduced significantly using LED illumination compared to mercury arc lamp illumination (see below).\n To maximize signal and resolution, use the highest numerical aperture possible in the objective, and the lowest magnification that provides sufficient spatial resolution. In addition, for mito-roGFP imaging, verify that the objective transmits well at 365 nm. The 100x/1.3NA EC PlanNeofluar objective (Zeiss) works well for this application.\n Configure the acquisition software to capture the oxidized and reduced mito-roGFP1 species. We use the following conditions.\n \nConfigure the channel for oxidized mito-roGFP to use excitation at 365 nm (100% LED power) and an emission filter suitable for GFP, such as the 38 HE filter set (Zeiss), with the included excitation filter removed from the cube. Removal of the excitation filter allows excitation at both 365 nm and 470 nm without the need to switch filters, thus increasing achievable time resolution.",
    "Configure the channel for reduced mito-roGFP to use excitation at 470 nm (100% LED power) and, as mentioned above, the same emission filter cube used for the oxidized mito-roGFP. Set the camera to 1x1 binning to optimize spatial resolution.\nSet software to acquire a z stack consisting of 11 slices with 0.5 μm spacing, collecting both channels at each z position. This mode of acquisition is slower than acquiring each z stack in turn, but it prevents artifacts arising from mitochondrial motion between acquisition of the oxidized and reduced channels.\nImage several cells to determine an appropriate exposure time, producing a strong but not saturating signal. It is important to maintain the ratio of exposure times for oxidized and reduced mito-roGFP1 for all experiments. For example, if the exposure times for oxidized and reduced mito-roGFP1 are 300 and 100 msec, respectively, then the exposure time for oxidized mito-roGFP1 should be 3 times that for reduced mito-roGFP for all experiments.\nSetup for imaging mitGO-ATeam2 on a spectral confocal microscope",
    "To quantify ATP levels using mitGO-ATeam2, the fluorescence from GFP (emission maximum 510 nm) must be distinguished from that from OFP (emission maximum 560 nm). There are fluorescence filter sets that resolve the fluorescence emitted from these fluorophores. However, we find that a spectral detector, available on many laser scanning confocal microscopes, works best for this application. A spectral detector separates the fluorescence emission into many components (typically 32 or more) according to wavelength. Several adjacent wavelength bands can be combined into one image channel. The wavelengths to be combined are selected empirically so as to maximize signal from GFP and OFP while avoiding crossover of signal that would confound the FRET measurement. Use the highest numerical aperture lens available. We use a 100x/1.49 or 60x/1.49 Apo-TIRF lens. We use the Nikon A1R confocal microscope running NIS Elements software. Configure the acquisition software to capture the ATP-bound and ATP-unbound mitGO-ATeam2 species. We use the following conditions.\n \nSet pinhole to 1.0 Airy units (AU), which on our system corresponds to a z resolution of about 0.42 μm.\nSet scan zoom to approach the Nyquist sampling limit, which will maximize spatial information in the image. On our system the pixel size is 0.12 μm.\nBecause mitochondria may move during imaging, it can be helpful to increase imaging speed by cropping the field to 512 x 256 pixels. The total time required to image one frame in our system is 1.0 sec, including a 2-fold scan average. Depending on desired spatial resolution, the field can be further cropped to increase time resolution.\nExcite at 488 nm, and collect emission from 500 - 520 nm for GFP, and from 550 - 580 nm for OFP. Actual optimal values may vary with characteristics of the imaging system.",
    "The optimal laser power for our system is between 6.0 and 6.4%. The optimal laser power will vary for each microscope system, but will ideally be as low as possible while still producing an interpretable image. Use an internal or external power meter to monitor changes in the laser power, which occur normally over time in any optical system.\nAdjust detector gain and illumination light intensity to maximize the detected range of pixel values but avoid saturating the signal, for as many cells as possible. Do not analyze any cells containing more than 1% saturated pixels. Image all samples using the same objective, laser power, scan zoom, pixel size, gain, and offset.\n4. Image Acquisition\nLocate the focal plane of cells of interest using transmitted light to minimize bleaching the fluorescent probe.\nAfter locating one or more cells of interest, collect a z-series through the whole depth of a typical cell (approx. 7 μm) using a step size of 0.5 μm.\nImage other cells of interest on the slide, but do not image a single slide for longer than 15 min. After 15 min on the slide, cells lose viability.\n5. Analysis\nMitochondrial ATP level is determined by measuring the ratio of the mitGO-ATeam2 emission at 560 nm to that at 510 nm.27 The redox state of the organelle is measured as the reduced to oxidized (R/O) ratio of mito-roGFP; i.e. emission at 510 nm upon excitation at 470 nm divided by emission at 510 nm upon excitation at 365 nm. Before calculating the ratio, we subtract background and determine a threshold value for pixels belonging to the fluorescent mitochondria.",
    "Public domain (e.g. ImageJ30) or commercially available (e.g. Volocity, Perkin-Elmer) software can be used for analysis of mito-roGFP1 or mitGO-ATeam2. Depending on the software used for image acquisition and for analysis, the images may first need to be converted to another format, such as TIFF, before opening them in the analysis software. If images are converted, it is essential to verify that pixel values are not changed during the conversion. Analysis of mito-roGFP1 data, using both programs is described below. Program menus and options to select within each menu are highlighted in bold italics.\n5.1 ImageJ analysis\nOpen images and change type to 32 bit: Image→ Type → 32 bit.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) in an area where there are no cells. Calculate the mean intensity in this ROI: Analyze → Measure.\nSubtract the calculated mean background from the stack:  Process → Math → Subtract.\nUsing the subtracted z-stack, find the middle slice and threshold on mitochondria: Image → Adjust → Threshold and click Apply on the Threshold window. Apply to all slices in the stack. Check Set background pixels to NaN.\nCreate the ratio z stack: Process → Image Calculator Divide the reduced stack by the oxidized z stack for mito-roGFP1 analysis. Divide the 560 nm (ATP bound) image by the 510 nm (ATP unbound) image for mitGO-ATeam2 analysis.\nDraw an ROI around the area of interest. Choose Analyze → Tools → ROI Manager, and click Add to record the ROI. Multiple regions may be stored in the manager. In ROI Manager, select all ROIs, then choose More → Multi-Measure to measure all stack slices. Export data to a spreadsheet for analysis.\n5.2 Volocity analysis\nImport images into a Volocity library and create an image sequence with 2 channels.",
    "Draw a region of interest (ROI) in an area where there are no cells. Choose: Tools → Ratio.\nUse Volocity to calculate the background: Get From ROI.\nAdjust the threshold to include mitochondrial structures.\nCheck the option to apply a rainbow LUT to the ratio channel. The intensity-modulated channel may produce a less noisy image for presenta-tion, but it should not be used for quantitation of average ratio.\nSelect the Measurement tab, select the ratio channel and draw an ROI around the area of interest. Measure the ratio channel, excluding zero values. Multiple regions may be selected and measured at the same time. Export data to a spreadsheet for analysis.\nSubscription Required.
