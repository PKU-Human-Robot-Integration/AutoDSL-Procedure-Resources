    "This study was approved by the Ben Gurion University of the Negev Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal experiments were approved by the IACUC (IL.80-12-2015 and IL.29-05-2018(E)). All aspects of animal testing, housing, and environmental conditions used in this study were in compliance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals13.\n1. Adeno-associated virus production\nDay 1: Cell culture\n\t\nSeed 4 x 106 HEK293T cells per 14.5 cm plate in 15 mL of DMEM. Prepare 10 plates for transfection with polyethylenimine (PEI) (1 µg/µL).\nDay 2: Transfection of HEK293T cells using PEI\n\t\nRemove media and refeed with warm DMEM 1 h before the transfection.\nPrewarm transfection reagents and DMEM.\nUse 10 µg of the plasmid of interest containing AAV ITR (AAV pCM109 EFS Cre sg APC sg KRAS sg P53- KRAS HDR), 10 µg of the AAV 2/9n capsid plasmid (with the rep gene of AAV2 and the cap gene of AAV9, and 10 µg of the helper plasmid (pAdDelta F5 helper) per plate (See Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: A new generation of helper plasmid - pAdDeltaF614,15,16 that can also be used for AAV production is available.\nMix the plasmids in 1 mL of plain DMEM per plate. Then add 90 µL of polyethylenimine (total plasmid: PEI concentration = 1:3) to the plasmid mix and vortex briefly.\nIncubate the PEI-plasmid DNA mix for 20 min at room temperature (RT).\nAdd the mix dropwise on top of the HEK293T cells and transfer the plates to the cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nDay 3: Medium change after transfection\n\t\nRemove the medium completely and add 15 mL of fresh DMEM.\nDay 5: Harvesting the virus\n\t\nPrepare a dry ice/ethanol bath.",
    "Collect the cells with a cell scraper and transfer them into 50 mL tubes (2 plates per 50 mL tube).\nSpin tubes at 800 x g for 15 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant from all the tubes. Add 0.5 mL of the lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.5) per plate (i.e., 5 mL for 10 plates) to the first tube only. Resuspend the cells and transfer the total volume to the next tube and continue until the last tube.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a fresh 50 mL tube. Wash the tubes with the same volume of lysis buffer (0.5 mL per plate) using the same transfer method as described in step 1.4.4.\nSubject the cell suspension to three rounds of ~10 min freeze/thaw cycles between a dry ice/ethanol bath and a 37 °C water bath. Vortex briefly after each thawing.\nIf the purification is carried out on the same day, set the equilibration and elution buffer (see Table 1 for the recipe) at RT.\nAdd 50 units of benzonase per plate and incubate at 37 °C for 1.5 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Benzonase is used to digest residual nucleic acids from the host producer cells and the plasmid DNA present in the cell suspension.\nSpin the tubes at 3,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant in a syringe using a 18 G steel needle and push the solution through a 0.45 µm filter into a 15 mL tube to obtain the crude lysate.\nStore the crude lysate at 4 °C for a few weeks until purification or continue purification.\n2. AAV purification\nDay 5 or later\n\t\nPlace the equilibration and elution buffer at RT.\nWash chromatography columns with 10 mL of the equilibration buffer.",
    "Add 0.5 mL per plate of heparin-agarose to the column17 and then add the equilibration buffer (4x the volume of the heparin-agarose). Mix the solutions by inverting the column and let the agarose sediment.\nElute the equilibration buffer from the column by gravity.\n\t\tNOTE: Leave some equilibration buffer to prevent the agarose from drying out.\nLoad the crude lysate onto the column and incubate for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Bring the column into an upright position and allow the agarose to sediment.\nElute the crude lysate by gravity.\nWash the column with equilibration buffer (4x the volume of the heparin-agarose).\nPlace a 100 kDa centrifugal protein filter below the column and elute the virus using an elution buffer (3x the volume of the heparin-agarose) into the filter.\n\t\tNOTE: The elution buffer should not exceed 15 mL.\nCentrifuge the filter at 3,000 x g for ~30 min until less than 1 mL is left in the filter.\nFill up the filter with PBS and centrifuge at 3,000 x g for ~30 min until less than 1 mL is left in the filter. Repeat this step 2x to remove all salts.\nConcentrate the virus solution in the filter by centrifugation at 3,000 x g to arrive at a volume as small as possible (less than 200 µL).\nAspirate the virus solution with a needle and syringe and push the solution through a 0.22 µm filter into a tube.\nMake aliquots of concentrated viral particles for storage.\n\t\tNOTE: The aliquots should be ~20 µL for short-term storage at 4 °C and ~5 µL for long-term storage at -80 °C.\nDetermine the viral titer and viral transduction efficiency as described previously14,18,19,20.\n3. Isolation and culture of primary cells\nDay 1",
    "Euthanize a 6-week-old male or female B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh/J by CO2 asphyxiation or any other IACUC approved protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: These CRISPR/Cas9 knockin mice have Cre recombinase-dependent expression of cas9 endonuclease and EGFP directed by a CAG promoter. The upstream Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) sequence present in the genome of these mice prevent the expression of Cas9 and EGFP in the absence of Cre recombinase. When used in combination with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and a Cre source, they allow editing of single or multiple mouse genes in vivo or ex vivo14.\nDissect the tongue from the euthanized mice using surgical scissors.\nManually dissociate the tissue by mincing the tongue tissue into very small fragments using a scalpel. Collect the tissue fragments in a 15 mL tube containing 4.5ml of RPMI plain medium (with out serum).\nAdd the triple enzyme mix (200 µl) (see Table 1 for the recipe) to the tissue fragments.\nIncubate the tissue-enzyme mix at 37 °C for 30 min and tap the tube every 10 min to enhance enzymatic dissociation of the tissue.\nAdd 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing HBSS/PBS to the tissue-enzyme mix to stop the enzyme action.\nFilter the above cell suspension through a sterile 70 µm nylon mesh to separate the dispersed cells and larger tissue fragments.\nWash the filtered cell suspension by centrifugation for 300 x g for 5 min in HBSS/PBS at RT.\nResuspend the pellet in culture medium (10% FBS in RPMI/DMEM) and grow in 60 mm culture dishes until distinct cell colonies are formed.\n\t\t\nCulture cell aggregates retained on top of the filter in a 60 mm culture dish containing 3 mL of complete media (10% FBS in RPMI/DMEM) until cell colonies are formed.",
    "Microscopically examine the primary cells for the presence of fibroblast contamination after 1 week of culture. Treat the primary cells developed from aggregates and cell suspensions with 0.25 trypsin 0.02% EDTA solution at 37 °C for 1 min to remove fibroblasts.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually the primary culture from cell aggregates produces more colonies compared to single-cell suspensions. The cells from these colonies provide better transduction efficiency with AAV transduction.\n4. AAV transduction of primary cells\nDay 10\n\t\nSeed 2 x 105 primary cells per well in 6 well plates in 2 mL of complete media (10% FBS in RPMI/DMEM).\nThe next day, transduce the cells with 1012 viral genome/mL (1010 transducing units/mL) and incubate the cells in viral particle-containing media for 48 h at 37 °C.\nRemove the viral particle-containing media and feed the AAV-transduced cells with complete media.\n\t\tNOTE: Only cells that underwent transduction will express GFP and start to proliferate. Cells that did not undergo transduction will eventually die within 2 weeks.\nAfter 2 weeks of culture expansion, seed the cells for validation and the in vivo tumorigenic experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: Genomic DNA fromAAV-transduced cells and normal primary cells from Cas9 mice were extracted for validating specific genome editing using standard protocols. Sequencing of the extracted DNA and analysis of the sequenced data (Table 2) were performed using a hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay (e.g., MSK-IMPACT platform) as described previously21.\n5. Validating the transformation of normal cells to tumorigenic cells using immunofluorescence and western blotting\nImmunofluorescence\n\t\nSeed 2 x 105 cells on 12 mm glass coverslips and place them in an incubator overnight.\nFix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH = 7.4) and process for immunofluorescence labeling.",
    "Incubate the fixed cells with the first primary antibody in 1% BSA or 1% serum in PBST in a humidified chamber for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used are the rabbit monoclonal anti-KRT 14, rabbit monoclonal anti-E-cadherin antibody, and Cas9 mouse mAb.\nRemove the primary antibody solution from the coverslips by washing the cells 3x for 5 min with 1x PBS.\nIncubate the cells with Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG and/or Cy3 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies in 5% BSA in PBST for 1 h at RT in the dark.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution from the coverslips and wash the cells 3x as described in step 5.1.4.\nMount the coverslips with a drop of mounting medium containing DAPI (DAPI Fluoromount).\nStore in the dark at 4 °C until the slides are imaged using fluorescence microscopy.\nWestern blotting\n\t\nSeed 1 x 106 transformed cells in a 100 mm culture dish and place them in an incubator overnight.\nWash and scrape the transformed cells into 200 µl ice cold PBS.\nCentrifuge the tube containing the cell suspension for 10 min at 2,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and lyse the cells using lysis buffer (see Table 1) containing phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and a protease inhibitor for 10 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge the lysates for 10 min at 10,000 x g and 4 °C and collect the cleared lysates.\nUse a commercially available Bradford assay kit to determine the protein concentration following the manufacturer's protocol. Use 4x sample buffer (500 mM Tris pH = 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 20% H2O, 0.02% bromophenol blue) to adjust the protein samples to 0.5 or 1 µg/µL. Boil at 96 °C for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: The samples can be stored at -80 °C or until a Western blot analysis is performed.\nSeparate equal amounts of total lysate (30 µg) by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Ensure that the dye reaches the bottom of the gel. Transfer the protein to the nylon membrane by semi-dry blotting at 25 V for 30 min.\nPour 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-0.1% Tween (TBST) over the membrane to cover it completely. Block the membrane for 1 h at RT. Incubate the mebrane with primary antibodies (anti-Cre, anti-Cas9, anti-GFP, anti-β catenin, anti p53, anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-β actin diluted in 5% BSA TBST) at 4 °C overnight.\nAfter incubation, wash the membranes for 10 min with 1x TBST making sure that the solution covers the membrane completely. Perform this wash 3x, and then add horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000 in 5% BSA TBST) to the membrane. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nAfter incubation, wash the membranes for 10 min with 1x TBST making sure that the solution covers the membrane completely. Perform the chemiluminescence imaging (see Table of Materials) to expose the bands, and capture images accordingly.\nValidating the tumorigenic potential of transformed cells in immunocompetent mice\n\tNOTE: Mice were maintained and treated according to the institutional guidelines of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. NOD.CB17-Prkdc-scid/NCr Hsd (NOD.SCID) and C57BL/6 mice were used for the in vivo studies. Mice were housed in air-filtered laminar flow cabinets with a 12 hour light/dark cycle and were fed food and water ad libitum.\n\t\nUse 6-8 week-old female NOD.CB17-Prkdc-scid/NCr Hsd (NOD.SCID) and C57BL/6 mice for the study.\nTrypsinize the AAV-Cas9 transformed cells. Stop the trypsinization using DMEM prewarmed at 37 °C and collect in a 50 mL tube.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 800 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in DMEM medium without FBS. Perform the centrifugation again and resuspend the cell pellet in 1x PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not keep the cells in 1x PBS for too long. Always keep the cell suspension on ice to prevent cell clumping.\nUse an automatic cell counter to count the cells and dilute the cells to the desired concentration (2.5 x 107 cells/mL) using 1x PBS. Generate tumors through a subcutaneous injection of the AAV-Cas9 transformed cell suspension in the right flank of each NOD.CB17-Prkdc-scid/NCr Hsd (NOD.SCID) mouse (2 x 106 cells/mouse). To generate an orthotropic model in syngeneic mice, inject 0.5 × 106 primary cells or the AAV-Cas9 transformed cells into the tongue of C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice.\nEuthanize the animals 2 weeks postinjection by CO2 asphyxiation, and dissect the tumors from the euthanized mice for immunohistochemistry analysis.\nSubscription Required.
