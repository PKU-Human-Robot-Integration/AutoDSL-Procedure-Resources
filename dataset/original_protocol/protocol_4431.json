    "Amplification of HBV RT domain from patients’ seraPrepare 100~200 μl of patient’ serum.Extract the HBV DNA using QIAamp MinElute virus spin kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and elute viral DNA in 50 μl of elution buffer (provided in the kit) or distilled water.Amplify HBV RT domain with primers following composition.table:\n﻿0,1\nHBV DNA (50 ng/μl),1 μl\nForward primer (10 pM),1 μl\nReverse primer (10 pM),1 μl\n10x Ex Taq polymerase buffer,2 μl\ndNTP mixture (2.5 mM),2 μl\nEx Taq polymerase (5 U/μl ),0.2μl\nDistilled water,12.8 μl\nTotal,20 μl\nRun PCR as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 50 sec, 62 °C for 50 sec, 72 °C 1 min 20 sec, and final extensions at 72 °C for 10 min.Identify the PCR products (HBV RT domain) on 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis (Figure 2) and purify with Gel/PCR DNA Extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (final elution volume is 30 μl of TE buffer).Sequencing of HBV RT domainMix the ligation reactions in 1.5 ml tube as described below and incubate overnight at 4 °C.table:\n﻿0,1\nPurified PCR products (60 ng/μl ),1 μl\npGEM-T Easy vector (50 ng/μl ),5 μl\n2x Rapid Ligation buffer,0.3 μl\nT4 DNA ligase (3 Weiss units/μl ),2.7 μl\nDistilled water,1 μl\nTotal,10 μl",
    "To inactivate the T4 ligase, incubate the ligation reactions at 65 °C for 15 min and place in ice.During step B2, prepare the E.Coli (DH5α) competent cells from -80 °C storage and place in ice until thawed.Transfer 50 μl of competent cells into ligation reactions and incubate in ice for 15 min.Heat-shock the competent cells for 90 sec in heat block at 42 °C, then immediately incubate in ice for 15 min.Add 500 μl LB medium to tube from step B5 and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking.Centrifuge the tube at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperate, and then remove the 350 μl of supernatant.Gently mix and plate the residue supernatant (approximate 150 μl) onto Ampr MacConkey agar plates using spreader.Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C and check the number of white colonies (approximately 100 colonies should be observed).Pick the white colonies, then transfer into 2 ml of LB medium with ampicillin in 15 ml tube and incubate overnight at 37 °C with shaking.Extract the DNA plasmids contained the HBV RT domain from bacterial culture (step B10) using the LaboPass Plasmid Mini Purification Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol and elutes plasmids in 50 μl of EB buffer (provided in Kit) or TE buffer.Confirm the correct insert DNA by simultaneous digestion reactions for 2 h at 37 °C as described below. table:\n﻿0,1\nPlasmid DNA (200 ng),-\nXhoI (20 U/μl ),0.25 μl\nNcoI (10 U/μl ),0.25 μl\n10x CutSmartTM Buffer,1 μl\nDistilled water,up to 10 μl\nTotal,10 μl",
    "Sequencing the HBV RT domain by T7 (5’-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3’) and SP6 (5’- ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TAG-3’) promoter primers (located in pGEM-T Easy vector) and analyze the mutations compared with WT HBV (genotype C, GQ872210).Cloning of HBV RT domain into HBV 1.2 replicon Simultaneously digest 200 ng of plasmids [HBV RT plasmid (step B12) for insert DNA and HBV 1.2mer replicon for vector DNA] with digestion reactions (see the procedure C step 12). Identify 1.2 kb (insert DNA, step B12) and 4.8 kb (vector DNA) fragment on 0.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis (Figure 3) and purify the digested DNAs with Gel/PCR DNA Extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (final elution volume is 30 μl of TE buffer).Mix the ligation reactions in 1.5 ml tube as described below and incubate overnight at 4 °C.table:\n﻿0,1\nInsert DNA (40 ng/μl),1 μl\nVector DNA (50 ng/μl),1 μl\n10x T4 ligase buffer,1 μl\nT4 DNA ligase (3 Weiss units/μl),0.3 μl\nDistilled water,6.7 μl\nTotal,10 μl\nTransform (see steps B2~7) and plate onto Ampr LB agar plates.Isolate and confirm the plasmid DNA (see steps B9~13)."
