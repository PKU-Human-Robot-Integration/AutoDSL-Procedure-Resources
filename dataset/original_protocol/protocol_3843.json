Alternatively, if not applicable, make sure that everything is sterile by cleaning bench, pipettes, etc. with 70% EtOH to avoid any contamination.\nAdd 0.5–1 μL (<100 ng) of plasmid to the competent cells.\nNote: Use 50–100 ng of plasmid. The volume of plasmid added to the competent cells shouldn’t exceed 10% of the final volume as the H2O may cause lysis of the cells.\nIncubate cells-DNA mixture on ice for 20 min.\nHeat shock competent cells at 42°C in a water bath (or heat block) for 45 s.",
    "Add 1 mL of sterile LB broth to the tube and incubate at 37°C in a shaker incubator at 180 rpm for 1 h.\nPlate 50 and 100 μL of cells onto LB/agar plates with 34 μg/mL Kanamycin and place the plates in a stationary incubator for 14–17 h at 37°C.\nDay 2\nTiming: 30 min\nInoculate two liquid starter cultures of 150 mL LB broth each, with 34 μg/mL Kanamycin using a single colony from each LB agar plate and incubate for 14–17 h in a shaker incubator at 37°C at 180 rpm. Day 3\nTiming: 8 h\nLarge scale liquid cultures\nInoculate 6× 800 mL of LB broth containing 34 μg/mL Kanamycin with 8 mL of starter culture (100-fold dilution) and grow at 37°C until the OD 600 nm reaches 0.6 (approximately 3 h).\nNote: The volume of bacterial cultures determines the final protein yield and can be adjusted to your needs\nNote: When growing bacterial cultures, it is important not to let the OD get any higher than 0.6. The OD should be carefully monitored and checked often, especially when it gets above 0.2, as the cell growth is exponential.\nAdd 800 μL of 0.5 M isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to each 800 mL culture to induce protein expression (HLA-A∗02:01, or β2-microglobulin) and incubate for 4 h.\nHarvest cells by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Resuspend cell pellets in MilliQ H2O (20 mL in total for the entire 6× 800 mL culture). We recommend using 50 mL falcon tubes for easy storage and manipulation.\nStore cell pellet in the −80°C (long term storage) or −20°C (short term storage) freezer.\nPause Point: You can either proceed to the preparation of insoluble proteins (Inclusion bodies) or store the cell pellets as described above.",
    "Preparation and extraction of insoluble proteins (Inclusion Bodies) Day 4\nTiming: 3 h\nThaw bacterial pellet in a 37°C water bath.\nUse Enzymatic Lysis Buffer on a rotating wheel for 20 min at ∼25°C for enzymatic cell lysis and DNA degradation.\nNote: Use 200 mL of Enzymatic Lysis Buffer per 6× 800 mL bacterial culture pellet.\nAlternatives: Other methods can also be used for the lysis of bacterial cells (e.g., French press, sonication).\nCentrifuge at 15,000 g at 4°C for 15 min.\nWash Inclusion Bodies.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet (from 6× 800 mL culture) in 150 mL of Wash Buffer 1.\nAdd 1 mM DTT (150 μL of 1 M stock) and 0.2 mM PMSF (150 μL of 200 mM stock)\nHomogenize and centrifuge at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRepeat i-iii until pellet is clean of dark debris (minimum of 4 washes).\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 150 mL of Wash Buffer 2.\nAdd 1 mM DTT (150 μL of 1 M stock) and 0.2 mM PMSF (150 μL of 200 mM stock).\nHomogenize and centrifuge at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 5 mL Guanidine·HCl Buffer for 6× 800 mL culture (1 mL/L of culture), on a rotating wheel for 14–17 h at 4°C.\nNote: If the mixture turns into a jelly-like consistency, add in 10 mM DTT.\nNote: For problems that may arise during this procedure please refer to troubleshooting problems 1 and 2 below.\nDay 5\nTiming: 3 h\nCentrifuge at 30,000 g at 4°C for 30 min and harvest the supernatant\nQuantification by SDS-PAGE\nUse 1 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as standard, with reduced loading dye (10% SDS, 500 mM DTT, 50% Glycerol, 250 mM Tris-HCl and 0.5% bromophenol blue dye, pH 6.8).",
    "Load wells to look like this as an example:\nProtein marker\n2 μL of BSA\n4 μL of BSA\n8 μL of BSA\n1 μL of sample diluted 10 times in 8 M Urea\n1 μL of sample diluted 5 times in 8 M Urea\nsample not diluted (if the sample looks yellow clear)\nLook for the size and thickness of the band for the protein of interest and estimate the concentration of your sample by eye compared to the BSA control of known concentration. This is a rough estimation of the concentration, as IBs are not 100% pure it is difficult to get an accurate concentration using nanodrop.\nNote: The molecular mass of HLA α-chain is ∼32 kDa and human β2-microglobulin is ∼10 kDa.\nAliquot them out to:\n10 mg for human β2-microglobulin\n30 mg for HLA-A∗02:01 heavy chain\nStore in −80°C or proceed to the next step (Refolding).\nPause Point: You can proceed to the refolding steps below or store the inclusion bodies long term at −80°C.\nRefolding of the HLA class I molecule with human β2-microglobulin and the peptide of interest (SARS-CoV-2 N222-230 LLLDRLNQL) followed by dialysis\nTiming: 1.5 days\nThe refolding step produces soluble peptide-HLA complexes. During this step, the pHLA complex will be formed, which is composed of the HLA-A∗02:01 heavy chain, human β2-microglobulin, and the peptide of interest, in this case the SARS-CoV-2 N222-230 LLLDRLNQL peptide.\nDay 5 continue\nTiming: 3 h\nRefolding of the HLA-class I molecule with human β2-microglobulin and the peptide of interest\nAdd the following to 0.5 L of Refolding Buffer:\n30 mg of HLA-A∗02:01 heavy chain\n10 mg of β2-microglobulin\n5 mg of the SARS-CoV-2 peptide dissolved in 0.4 mL 100% DMSO\nStir at ∼25°C for 3 h",
    "Note: Refolding conditions (temperature and time) may vary according to the protein. For example, we have found that protein yields were higher for certain HLA molecules (HLA-A∗11:01 and HLA-A∗68:01) when allowed a refold time of 3 days at 4°C. If the yield is poor the quantity of the peptide can be increased (10 or 20 mg).\nDay 5 continue – Day 7\nTiming: 36 h\nDialysis\nPlace refolding buffer (0.5 L) into dialysis membranes (10 kDa cut-off), and dialyze over 10 L of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 for 12 h (3× times) at 4°C.\nCritical: Make sure dialysis goes for at least 36 h, this will improve the yield of your refolded protein.\nPurification of the HLA-A∗02:01- SARS-CoV-2 N222-230 LLLDRLNQL complex\nTiming: 1 day\nDay 7\nTiming: 3 h\nIon exchange chromatography - Diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-C)\nPrepare, wash and equilibrate the DEAE-C resin as described in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”.\nFilter dialyzed protein sample using a 0.22 μm syringe filter and load onto the column at 4°C.\nElute bound proteins with 5 CV (column volume) of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl.\nVisualize your protein purity on SDS-PAGE.\nDEAE resin can be washed with 1 M NaCl followed by 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and stored in 20% EtOH to be reused at 4°C.\nDay 7\nTiming: 3 h\nIon exchange chromatography - HiTrap Q HP, 1 mL\nConcentrate the eluted protein using a centrifugal concentrator with a 10 kDa cut-off and buffer exchange over 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 four times.\nCritical: This step is crucial as NaCl needs to be removed from the sample before loading it onto the HTQ column.",
    "Note: Protein of interest must be filtered with 0.22 μm filter before loading onto the column to remove particulate material. The starting volume of the sample should be less than 1 mL for the HTQ column and diluted in equilibration buffer (see below) to less than 5 mL (5 fold dilution). 5 mL loop should be used on FPLC machine for injection onto the HTQ column. Check the pressure limit for the column and set this parameter on the FPLC. If sample volume is higher than the volume of the loop multiple injections can be done.\nConnect the column on the FPLC with desired buffer (Pump A: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0).\nWash the column with five column volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl (Pump B).\nEquilibrate the column with five column volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (Pump A).\nStart fractionation before protein injection. Ensure the deep well or tubes are at the right position. Collect 1 mL fractions.\nInject protein sample and run at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nAfter two loop volumes (10 mL) set a gradient from 0 to 20% of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl (Pump B) over 20 min.\nUsually, peptide-HLA complex elute at ∼15% of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl although this can vary between different proteins.\nRun SDS-PAGE gel of the fractions of interest.\nPool the fractions needed based on purification profile and gel analysis.\nConcentrate the protein sample using a 10 kDa cut-off concentrator and measure the concentration of protein using a UV spectrophotometer at 280 nm absorbance. The protein sample needs to be concentrated to the desired concentration for crystallization. The HLA-A∗02:01- SARS-CoV-2 N222-230 LLLDRLNQL complex was concentrated at 5 mg/mL to set up crystal trays.",
    "Note: Beer-Lambert law is used to calculate concentration based on absorbance at 280 nm: A = εcl, where A = Absorbance; ε = Molar absorption coefficient, M-1cm-1; c = Molar concentration, M; l= optical path length, cm.\nNote: The protein sample can be stored at 4°C short term or at −20°C long term. However, it is highly recommended to be used straight away to set up trays.\nNote: For problems that may arise during this procedure please refer to troubleshooting problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] below.\nCrystallization of the HLA-A∗02:01-SARS-CoV-2 N222-230 LLLDRLNQL complex\nTiming: time varies for crystal formation (hours to months)\nTiming: 2 h for step 7\nTiming: 2 h for step 8\nThis step describes the crystallization process of the HLA-A∗02:01-N222-230 LLLDRLNQL (pHLA) complex.\nThe condition used is: 20% PEG3350 w/v, 0.2 M Potassium Formate, 1 mM CaCl2, via sitting-drop, vapor diffusion at 20°C with a protein: reservoir drop ratio of 1:1, at a protein concentration of 5 mg/mL in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl (Szeto et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nThis process can be applied for a variety of different proteins/ peptides/ protein complexes, however, many factors such as the crystallization condition, protein concentration, use of seeds and additives, can vary significantly.\nNote: The purity of the protein sample should be evaluated prior to crystallization. For the initial crystallization screening, the protein sample should be at least 95% pure on SDS-PAGE. It is recommended, if possible, to also evaluate the homogeneity and monodispersity of the protein sample as both factors can significantly influence the crystallization outcome.",
    "Critical: Avoid freeze/thawing protein samples multiple times and try to use freshly purified protein for crystallisation. Try to set up the trays within a week after the purification or pass your protein sample through a HiTrap Q HP column again to remove any unfolded material prior to crystallisation trial set up.\nSet up sitting drop 48-well-plates according to or using reagent formulations from Hampton Research commercial screening kits. The kit used here is the PEG/Ion HT Crystallization reagent kit.\nPrepare approximately 50 μL (per plate to be set up) of pHLA-A∗02:01 peptide complex with concentration at approximately 5 mg/mL in the buffer used for protein purification (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl).\nNote: The concentration of the protein needed to form crystals can vary.\nPipette 100 μL of crystallization solution into the deep well\nPipette 1 μL of crystallization solution from each deep well onto the well, followed by 1 μL of the protein sample\nSeal the plate with Crystal Clear plate Sealing Tape and store the plate at 20°C\nNote: Alternatively, hanging drop plates can be used with silicon glass cover slides.\nWait until crystals appear\nNote: Crystallization trial is a multi-factor process, and not all factors are under your control. Please see below troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] for some alternative tips that may facilitate the process.\nOptimization Depending on the crystal quality such as size, shape, and diffraction quality, optimization steps may be needed. Here we optimized the initial conditions that crystals were grown in by using the Additive Screen HT and micro seeds from the drop that gave crystals.\nSet up sitting drop 48-well-plates using the condition that produced crystals.\nPipette 1 μL of the crystallization solution from each deep well onto the well, followed by 1 μL of the protein.",
    "Note: The concentration of the protein may need to be adjusted depending on the initial crystals. For example, if there are multiple clusters of crystals in the drop, or high precipitation, the protein concentration may need to be decreased.\nAdd 0.2 μL of additive included in the Additive Screen HT in your drop (protein and crystallization solution), in this case 1 mM CaCl2 was used.\nAdd crystal micro seeds if initial crystals have been obtained. Crush up the seeds finely and add 0.2 μL of crushed seeds into each drop.\nSeal the plate with Crystal Clear plate Sealing Tape and store the plate at 20°C.\nWait until crystals appear."
