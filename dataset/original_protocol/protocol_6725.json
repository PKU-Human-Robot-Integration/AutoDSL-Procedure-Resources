    "Preparation of truncated glass wool stock for wounding of C. elegans Pour 30 ml of M9 buffer into a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube and add glass wool as much as it can hold.Cut the glass wool into pieces using a scissors and make sure the glass wool is immerced in the buffer to avoid floating of fine glass shards in the air.Continue to cut the glass wool until it’s volume reaches 5 ml as displayed in Figure 1 and transfer the course truncated glass wool pieces to a morter and pestle along with the M9 buffer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3885/bioprotoc-11-02-3885-g001.jpgFigure 1. Truncated glass wool pieces transferred to a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube after cutting/grinding Grind it for 20 min to make it fine for the further purpose of injuring the miniature model, C. elegans.After grinding, transfer the truncated glass wool pieces to a new 50 ml Falcon tube and autoclave the same at 121 °C for 20 min.After autoclave, store it in room temperature and make sure that the glass wool is autoclaved before every wounding process to avoid contamination and ensure sterile wounding of C. elegans.Preparation of worms for woundingBleach the gravid hermaphrodites by exposing to equal volume of 5 M KOH and house hold bleach solution (1:1 ratio) for 50 s and transfer the eggs to an Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plate seeded with E. coli OP50 following two M9 wash by centrifuging at 3,500 x g for 1 min.Incubate the plates at 20 °C until the worms reach young adult stage (~2.5 days). Before going for wounding of C. elegans, collect the worms in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by washing from the plate using M9 buffer.Glass wool wounding of C. elegans Transfer 50 mg of autoclaved truncated glass wool pieces in a 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tube by pipetting using 1 ml pipet tips and add 5 µl of nile red (1%) to it by gentle mixing for traking the site of injury after glass wool wounding.Remove the M9 content as much as possible by pipetting and add equal volume of young adult stage worms above the glass pieces.Vortex the tubes strictly for 1 min by directly keeping it on the vortex mixer. Rotate the tube periodically to cover all the worms during vortex.Use another Eppendorf tube for wounding while handling higher volumes of worms to avoid the increase in propotion of uninjured worms in the resulted population.Use maximum of 100 µl of worms containing more than 5,000 numbers of worms/tube and ensure the usage of 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for successful wounding of C. elegans.Recovery of wounded worms after injuryFollow the below steps to recover the worms after injury based on the requirement.Recovery of wounded worms for microscopic imagingAfter vortex wounding, add 500 µl of M9 on the walls of the Eppendorf tube without disturbing the worms.Later, transfer the worms rested above the glass pieces by pipetting (T20 pipet) to a glass slide and cover it with a cover slip.Visualise the worms under stereo microscope and score the injured worms by differentiating the site of injury spoted in red by the application of nile red as shown in the Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3885/bioprotoc-11-02-3885-g002.jpgFigure 2. Glass wool wounded worm with unwounded control. Unwounded worm with intact skin layer (Left); Wounded worm with injury created by piercing with truncated glass wool indicated with an arrow mark (Right). Scale bars express 100 microns.Recovery of wounded worms for high throughput analysisAfter vortex wounding, add 1 ml of M9 and gently mix the content by pipetting using T1000 pipet.",
    "Let the worms settle above the glass piece and repeat the same for twice to clear out the Nile red and the inserted glass wool pieces.After washing, let the worms settle and transfer them all to a new Eppendorf tube by pippeting.Use edge cut tips with T1000 pipet for handling and washing of worms after glass wool wounding."
