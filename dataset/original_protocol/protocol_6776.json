    "Prepare the DNA substratesThe tail DNA substrate (T3 or T5) was assembled from a duplex-DNA segment with a sticky end (the 224 bp segment for T3, the 356 bp segment for T5) and a tail-DNA segment. The fork DNA substrate (F3 or F5) was assembled from two duplex-DNA segments with sticky ends (the 224 bp segment and the 356 bp segment) and a core fork segment.Assemble the T3 DNA substratePrepare the duplex-DNA segment (224-bp duplex-DNA) for T3Run PCR reaction: Prepare the 364-bp PCR product for the 224-bp segment:Use plasmid pUC19 (1 ng/μl) along with the designed forward primer (F364, 25 μM) and the reverse primer (R364, 25 μM) and amplify the substrate DNA using PCR:Mix 680 μl of DDI H2O, 80 μl of Dream Taq buffer, 12 μl of F364, 12 μl of R364, 12 μl of dNTP solution mix, 2 μl pUC19, and 2 μl of Dream Taq (total volume 800 μl) in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.Aliquot the mixture into the thin-walled PCR tubes (~100 μl for each tube) and place the reactions in a thermal cycler.Run the following program for 33 cycles after an initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C: 30 s denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s annealing at 62 °C, 70 s extension at 72 °C. Set a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min following the 33 cycles.Note: We usually take ~0.5 μl of the PCR product and run an agarose gel (~2%, w/v) to check the PCR reaction. Purification of the PCR product:Apply phenol-chloroform extraction or use Amicon Ultra-0.5 ml centrifugal filters.The phenol-chloroform extraction procedure:Collect the PCR product into several 1.5 ml microfuge tube, and keep the volume around 700 μl for each tube.",

It will let you know the place on the bottom where the pellet is precipitated (it will be under the tail on the bottom of the tube, in this case). Spin them at max speed for 15 min in the cold room (4 °C).Remove supernatant with a pipette and add 300-500 μl of cold 70% EtOH.

The stock solution can be kept for more than a year at 4 °C. Prepare 15 ml of the working APS (167 μM) from the APS stock.Cut 1 × 3 cm strips of mica from high-quality mica sheets. Check that the piece fits when placed diagonally in a cuvette. A schematic of the process to prepare APS functionalized mica for AFM imaging is shown in Stumme-Diers et al. (2019). Use a razor blade to cleave layers of the mica until both sides are freshly cleaved, and the piece should be thin (~0.1 mm). Immediately place the mica piece into the APS filled cuvette and incubate for 30 min.Rinse the mica piece under running DDI H2O droplets or slow fluid for ~10 s. Completely dry both sides of the APS-mica strip under the gentle argon flow.Note: Use the lock tweezer to take the mica piece. A non-woven cellulose and polyester wipe (recommended wipe detailed in Materials) can be used to aid in wicking water from the edge of the mica when drying; keep the mica piece perpendicular to the wipe to avoid damage to the functionalized mica surface. The APS-functionalized mica is ready to use.",
    "For storage, place the dry mica strip into a clean cuvette and keep it in a vacuum chamber. The functionalized mica can be stored in the vacuum chamber or in the argon atmosphere for at least a week.Prepare the protein-DNA complexPrepare the binding solution from the 10× binding buffer (see Recipes). Take 1 μl of the 10× binding buffer and make up the volume to 10 μl with DDI H2O. The binding solution contains 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT.Prepare the Protein-DNA mixturePrepare the PriA-DNA complex. Mix 3.6 μl of the PriA monomer (molar concentration: 100 nM) with 1 μl of DNA substrate (molar concentration: 45 nM) in a molar ratio of 8:1. Add 5.4 μl of the binding buffer to the mixture and incubate at room temperature (~20 °C) for 10 min.Prepare the PriA-SSB-DNA complex. Mix 10 μl of the SSB tetramer (molar concentration: 50 nM) with 10 μl of the PriA monomer, and the mixture was kept on ice for 30 minutes before use. Take 3.6 μl of the protein-mixture and add it to the fork DNA substrate in a 1:2:4 (DNA substrates: SSB: PriA) molar ratio. Make up the volume to 10 µl with the binding buffer and incubate the mixture for 10 min at room temperature (~20 °C).After incubation, dilute the complex-solution to achieve lower DNA concentration (~2 nM), which is ready for deposition onto the APS functionalized mica.Note: Arrange the experiment to have the APS-mica ready-to-use before this step. Once the mixture is diluted, it should be immediately deposited onto the mica. Prepare the protein-DNA samples on the APS-micaApply double-faced adhesive tape to several magnetic pucks and place them to the side.Cut the APS-mica substrate to 1 × 1 cm squares.",
    "Place these pieces in a clean petri dish and keep them covered.Prepare a dilution of the assembled protein-DNA complexes (keep the final DNA concentration at 1.0 to 2.0 nM) using the binding buffer.Deposit 10 μl of the diluted protein-DNA sample at the center of the APS-mica piece and incubate for two minutes. Gently rinse the sample with DDI H2O droplets for ~10 s to remove all buffer components.Dry the deposited sample under a light flow of clean argon gas with the help of a clean wipe. Attach the sample to the magnetic puck and store it in a vacuum cabinet filled with argon for at least 3 h before imaging.Note: Be careful not to touch the mica surface after sample deposition. AFM imagingImages were acquired using a MultiMode 8, Nanoscope V system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) operated in tapping mode in the air on TESPA probes (320 kHz nominal frequency and a 42 N/m spring constant) from the same vendor.Mount the probe into the cantilever holder. Be sure that it is in firm contact with the end of the groove. Mount the cantilever holder onto the end of the scanner head.Mount the sample on the AFM stage.Note: Be careful not to contact the sample surface. Adjust the laser until the sum is at the maximum so that it is on the cantilever. Adjust the photodetector and set the vertical and lateral deflection values to near zero.Tune the cantilever. Click 'AutoTune' to find the cantilever's free-air resonant frequency and adjust the peak offset to ~3%.Set Initial Scan Parameters. Set the initial Scan Size to 1 µm, X and Y Offset to 0, and Scan Angle to 0. Set Integral Gain to 1.0, Proportional Gain to 5, and Scan Rate to 1 Hz. Click the engage button to begin the approach.",
    "Once approached, gradually optimize the Amplitude Setpoint until the surface of the sample is clearly seen. Once the scan parameters are optimized, increase the resolution to 1024 × 1024 pixels. Check to see if Trace and Retrace are tracking each other well during the scan. Click the capture button followed by the engage button to begin image acquisition.Flatten the image. Click 'Flatten' in the tool panel and save as a copy in the same folder.Notes: AFM calibration is accomplished with the use of a calibration reference and the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer (NanoScope Software Version 5, 004-210-000). According to this protocol, use the Platinum Coated Calibration Grid ( PG  ), 1 µm × 1 µm period [100 nm Depth (± 10%)] as the calibration reference and follow the instructions in the manual for the instrument. For Z-axis calibration, by measuring the vertical features of the image using Depth analysis of the same software to correct the Z sensitivity parameter. To accomplish this, divide the actual depth of features (100 nm for  PG  ) by the measured depth (indicated in Depth analysis by the Peak-to-Peak value), multiply this quotient by the Z sensitivity value in the Z Calibration dialog box, and replace the former Z sensitivity value with the new result. During auto-tuning of the cantilever, the resonance frequency and drive amplitude are automatically selected for the largest signal-to-noise ratio. In our AFM imaging system (MultiMode 8, Nanoscope V system), the drive amplitude is usually 5-15 mV and yields 200-250 mV free amplitude. If needed, the free amplitude (in volts) can be converted to the deflection of the cantilever (in nm) with the calibrated spring constant and inverse optical lever sensitivity of the cantilever, following the detailed instruction provided by the manufacturer (NanoScope Software Version 5, 004-210-000).",
    "For the TESPA probe, the nominal spring constant is 37 nN/nm and nominal sensitivity is 60 nm/V, thus nominally, the free amplitude (200-250 mV) is ~12-15 nm. The setpoint values were manually adjusted to the maximal stable values during scanning to maintain the high-resolution image and minimize the tip sweeping effect. The operational amplitude varies on different instruments and or tips. In our AFM imaging system (MultiMode 8, Nanoscope V system), the amplitude setpoint is 150 mV, corresponding to ~80% of the free amplitude of the cantilever."
