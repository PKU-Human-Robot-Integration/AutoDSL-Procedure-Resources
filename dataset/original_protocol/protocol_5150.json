    "Preparation of collagen-coated plateWash each well of 96-well glass bottom microplates with 100 μl 0.2 N NaOH at room temperature for 30 min.Rinse each well with 100 μl PBS and then 100 μl distilled water.Coat the glass bottom of each well with 100 μl collagen solution at room temperature for 1 h (see Note 6).Wash each well with 100 μl PBS twice.Remove PBS completely from each well by pipetting. The plates can be stored at 4 °C for 1 week.Cell cultureThaw frozen cell stocks in a water bath at 37 °C, and retrieve the cells by low speed centrifugation (220 x g, 5 min). Remove the supernatant by pipetting.Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml growth medium (e.g., MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS) without antibiotics.Culture the cells in growth medium in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until 80% confluency is reached.For plasmid transfection, seed the cells into a 10 cm dish 1 day prior to use (see Note 7).Administration of plasmids with transfection reagentSeed 6 x 103 cells into 100 μl growth medium in each well of a collagen-coated 96-well plate 1 day prior to transfection. The cells should be used for transfection when they have reached 30-50% confluency.Add 100 ng Venus-tagged FLJ cDNA clone plasmids to 50 μl Opti-MEM I reduced medium in each well of a 96-well U-bottom plate. Add 0.3 μl TransIT-LT1 reagent to 50 μl Opti-MEM I reduced medium in each well of a separate 96-well U-bottom plate.Mix the solutions prepared in steps C2 and C3 and incubate at room temperature for 15-30 min to form the plasmid-TransIT-LT1 complexes. Add the resultant plasmid-TransIT-LT1 complexes (ca. 100 μl) directly to the growth medium in each well of the 96-well plate prepared in step C1.",
    "Culture the cells for 24 h in the incubator with 5% CO2 (see Note 8).RNase treatmentRemove the culture medium by pipetting and wash the cells once with 100 μl PBS.Wash the cells once with 100 μl permeabilization buffer and then permeabilize the cells with 100 μl 2% Tween 20-permeabilization buffer at room temperature for 10 min (see Note 9).Wash the cells once with 100 μl permeabilization buffer.Wash the cells once with 100 μl PBS and degrade RNAs with 100 μl 50 U/ml RiboShredder RNase Blend-PBS at room temperature for 20 min (see Note 10).Wash the cells twice with 100 μl PBS.Fix the cells with 100 μl 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 min.Wash the cells three times with 100 μl PBS for 5 min each.Stain the DNA with 100 μl DAPI solution for 1 min.Wash the cells three times with 100 μl PBS.(Optional, see Note 11) Stain the RNA with 100 μl Pyronin Y solution for 15 sec.(Optional) Wash the cells three times with 100 μl PBS.Add 100 μl PBS to each well and seal the wells with a 96-well plate sealing film. Visualize Venus signals and detect nuclear foci in the samples using the IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (Figure 2). The images were acquired under 400x magnification, with automatically optimized exposure times and hardware autofocus. Images of 25 different fields were acquired from each well.

Effect of RNase treatment was confirmed by visualizing cellular RNAs with Pyronin Y staining, and by monitoring the persistence of the RNase-resistant Cajal bodies (marked by COIL-Venus) and disappearance of the RNase-sensitive paraspeckles (marked by SFPQ-Venus). Sam68 nuclear body is a newly identified RNase-sensitive NB. Arrowheads indicate nuclear foci. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Bar = 10 μm."
