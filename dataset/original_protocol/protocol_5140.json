    "Part I. sgRNA design and preparation Design of sgRNA sequence (Timing 1-2 h)Download genomic sequence from genome database (e.g., NCBI in FASTA format).Open your sequence with ‘A plasmid Editor’ (http://biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape/[href=http://biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape/]) or similar sequence analysis software.Choose a target locus for CRISPR editing. Due to the variability of CRISPR knockout efficiency we generally choose 3 different exonic regions if possible. See introduction for discussion of additional considerations for target locus selection.Screen your target genomic locus for CRISPR guide RNA binding sites by inputting specific sequences into an online tool such as http://crispr.mit.edu[href=http://crispr.mit.edu]. Note: Initial work was done with the crispr.mit.edu online tool. But alternative CRIPSPR calculators like http://crispor.tefor.net/[href=http://crispor.tefor.net/] may offer additional prediction efficiency.Choose guides by score and location in the genome to determine targeting sites. Cas9 will cut 3 bp upstream of PAM site. We recommend choosing three different sgRNAs to improve the probability of achieving a full knockout.Copy the 20 nucleotide sequence of the selected guide RNA(s) without PAM and generate the complement sequence by using a bioinformatics software tool such as e.g., the Oligonucleotide Properties Calculator (http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu[href=http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu]).For ligation into pLentiCRISPR plasmids add additional nucleotide to the sequence to generate sticky ends complement to the Esp3I restriction site (CACC/AAAC) and the transcriptional start site for RNA polymerase III (single G/C).table:\n﻿0,1\nOligonucleotide,Additional sequence (5’-3’)\nFw_sg,CACCG(N20)\nRev_sg,AAAC(N20)C\nOrder the forward and reverse oligonucleotides (simple desalted oligonucleotides are adequate for this protocol).See example oligonucleotide design strategy for RIP1 in Figure 3.Annealing of single-stranded oligonucleotides (Timing 2.5 h)For lyophilized oligonucleotides, add an appropriate volume of ddH2O to obtain stock concentration of 100 µM.Pipette the following reaction for each pair of forward and reverse oligonucleotide.table:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Amount\nFw_sg oligo,10 µl\nRev_sg oligo,10 µl\nTango buffer,10 µl\nddH2O,70 µl",

    "Note: There is an additional BsmBI (Esp3I) site in the tagBFP sequence in the pLentiCRISPR-BFP vector. For this vector the final 37 °C step should be removed from the cycle protocol to improve yield.PAUSE POINT: After heat inactivation of Esp3I the plasmid can be immediately transformed into bacteria or stored at -20 °C.Transformation and identification of bacterial clones with pLentiCRISPR and double-stranded oligonucleotide insert (Timing 3 d)Day 1:Transform ligation mix into competent bacteria.Add 2 µl ligation mix into ice-cold competent bacteria (50 µl).Note: Do not use more than 5 µl ligation product for transformation of 50 µl competent bacteria.Incubate mixture on ice for 20 min and heat-shock it at 42 °C for 90 sec.Cool down on ice for 2 min.Add 200 µl SOC medium (without antibiotics) and incubate for 45 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking.Plate 100 µl bacteria suspension on LB plate containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin.Incubate overnight at 37 °C in the microbiological incubator.Day 2:Run a colony PCR for 3-5 colonies per transformed pLentiCRISPR. Note: No colonies? See notes in Table 2. Prepare separate LB-agar plate with a number for each clone that will be picked.Prepare PCR reaction mix.

    "Load PCR reactions on an agarose gel (2% [w/v] agarose/TAE buffer) (see Figure 5 for estimated product). Note: No positive colonies? Too many colonies? See notes in Table 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328210001_1485.jpgFigure 5. Example of colony PCR products. pLentiCRISPR clones with inserted double-stranded oligonucleotides give a band around 100 bp. Empty vectors should give no band and will show only the primer dimers.Pick positive clone(s) from numbered plates to start overnight cultures in LB medium at 37 °C in the microbiological incubator.Day 3:Isolate plasmid DNA by mini or midi prep according to manufacturer’s protocol. PAUSE POINT: Plasmids can be immediately transfected into HEK293T cells or stored at 4 °C or -20 °C.Part II. Lentiviral production and infection Production of pLentiCRISPR lentiviral particles (Timing 3-5 d) Day 1:In the afternoon seed 500,000 HEK293T cells per 6 well plate in 2 ml of DMEM complete. Note: Keep HEK293T cells always subconfluent. We also recommend working without antibiotics as we generally achieve higher titers without antibiotics in the medium. This protocol details the production of pilot-scale batches of viral supernatant (approximately 6-9 ml) appropriate for cell line applications but can be scaled up using T175 flasks to produce larger batches. Incubate overnight to allow HEK293T cells to adhere and equilibrate.Day 2Transfect HEK293T cells with lentiviral plasmids (pLentiCRISPR, psPAX2 and pVSV.G). We recommend using one of the two following techniques. Notes: a.Be careful not to disturb the cells while you add the transfection reagents. b.We use a ratio of 8:3:3 for LentiCRISPR:psPAX2:pVSV.G resulting in 4 µg pLentiCRISPR, and 1.5 µg of each of psPAX2 and p.CMV.VSV.G per well. But plasmid ratio should be titrated. PEI transfection reagentThaw all reagents to room temperature (RT, about 22 °C).Dilute the plasmids in 1 ml of serum free, antibiotic free DMEM.Add 20 µl of PEI reagent and vortex immediately.",
    "Incubate the PEI/plasmid mixture for exactly 20 min at RT. Add the mixture dropwise directly to the HEK293T cells.ProFection mammalian transfection systemThaw all reagents to RT.Replace the cell culture medium with 3 ml fresh antibiotic free DMEM complete and add 3 µl chloroquine (final concentration 25 µM).Mix plasmids with 2 M CaCl2 and add ddH2O up to 150 µl. Gently add DNA-CaCl2 solution dropwise to 150 µl HBS while vortexing.Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Add the mixture dropwise directly to the HEK293T cells.Note: All subsequent steps are subject to biosafety level 2 regulations. Perform all work in a biosafety cabinet and do not use vacuum to suction supernatants to avoid aerosolizing virus. After 4-6 h, remove the transfection medium and carefully replace by 3 ml pre-warmed DMEM complete. For PEI transfection, medium change is not strictly necessary, no obvious toxicity to cells could be observed.Day 3:The next morning examine the transfection efficiency by fluorescence microscopy. Some fluorescent signal should be visible in the majority of cells, although signal can be expected to increase for up to 72 h.Note: No fluorescence? See notes in Table 2. Collect the supernatant from the HEK293T cells and replace it with 3 ml pre-warmed DMEM complete medium. Keep viral supernatant on ice.Put HEK293T cells back to incubator (5% CO2) until next day.Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter to clear any remaining cells and freeze an aliquot of 100 µl for titer test at -80 °C.Supernatant can be kept at 4 °C in order to combine supernatant collected on subsequent days.Note: Do not user smaller filter size as it will decrease virus titer.Day 4:Repeat steps A6-A9 (Part II).Day 5:Repeat steps A6-A9 (Part II).",
    "Note: You can harvest viral supernatant up to 72 h after transfection, but the viral titer is decreasing after 48 h. Control the appearance of the HEK293T cells, cells should not overgrow massively. The highest titer is normally reached 24 h after transfection. PAUSE POINT: Supernatant can be immediately concentrated (see step C1, Part II) or aliquoted and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week, or at -80 °C with a marginal decrease in viral titer (> 1 year). Freeze and thaw cycles should be avoided, as it will reduce titer. Titration of pLentiCRISPR lentiviral particles (Timing 3 d) Note: For initial screening of sgRNA functionality viral supernatants can be used directly on target cells without titration, however it is recommended to still perform titrations as viral aliquots can be stored and used for later experiments. Day 1:Plate 50,000 HEK293T cells in 0.5 ml DMEM complete per well in a 24 well plate.Work in triplicates.Note: HEK293T titers are a relative measurement of infectious units, thus we recommend working always with HEK293T cells under the same conditions (incubation times, volumes etc.). Stable processes enables to compare the titers between different productions. Add 0.5 µl polybrene (final concentration of 8 µg/ml).Incubate HEK293T cells for 6 h in the incubator (5% CO2).Add viral supernatant in increasing amounts to the medium (20 µl-100 µl of unconcentrated virus).CAUTION: All subsequent steps are subject to biosafety level 2 regulations. Do not use the vacuum pump to suction supernatants to avoid aerosolizing virus. Note: If this is done for the first time use a broad range of concentrations (1/10 to 1/100,000 relative dilutions of viral supernatant) to ensure that the data will be evaluable. Centrifuge the 24 well plate for 1 h, 750 x g, RT and keep overnight in the incubator (5% CO2).",
    "Day 2:Replace medium by 0.5 ml fresh DMEM complete and incubate for 48 h.Day 3:Remove supernatant and wash cells with PBS.Add 0.5 ml trypsin/EDTA and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C until the cells detach from the surface.Add 0.5 ml DMEM complete, resuspend the cells and transfer into FACS tubes.Spin for 5 min, 750 x g, RT.Remove supernatant and resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml PBS with 2% (v/v) formalin.Measure the transduction efficiency via flow cytometry.The linear range of viral transduction is in between 5-30%. Calculate the titer only for those wells that are comprised. The titer is calculated with the following formula. For more details refer to Weber et al. (2012).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170329/20170329001321_0150.jpgNotes: Under the procedure described in this protocol we generally expect to achieve viral supernatants that show cfu/ml above 1 x 105.Low titer? See notes in Table 2.Concentration of lentiviral particles (Timing 1-8 h)To increase the titer and therefore the transduction potential you can concentrate the virus by (a) column, (b) ultracentrifugation or (c) PEG 6000 precipitation.Concentration by Amicon centrifugal filter units Centrifugation speed and time should be optimized.We recommend loading 15 ml viral supernatant into the upper chamber and centrifuge for 10 min at 1,800 x g at 4 °C.Volume of viral supernatant should be decreased to 1 ml.Concentration index 1:15.Concentration by ultracentrifugationLoad up to 40 ml viral supernatant to a Nalgene Oak Ridge centrifuge tube.Centrifuge for 6 h, at 8,000 x g, 4 °C.Afterwards virus is visible as a transparent jelly pellet.Discard supernatant carefully and resuspend pellet by vigorously pipetting in 1 ml medium of your choice.Concentration index: 1:40.Concentration by PEG 6000 precipitation Day 1. To 5 ml virus supernatant, add 1.3 ml of 50% PEG 6000 solution, 0.54 ml 4 M NaCl and 0.59 ml PBS. The ﬁnal PEG 6000 concentration will be 8.",
    "5% and the ﬁnal NaCl concentration will be ~0.3 M.Mix contents and store at 4 °C overnight.Day 2. Centrifuge mixture for 30 min at 2,000 x g, 4 °C.After centrifugation a white virus pellet is visible.Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100-500 µl medium by vigorously pipetting liquid up and down.Concentration index 1:50.Transduction of cell lines with pLentiCRISPR lentiviral particles (Timing 4 d)Note: This protocol is optimized for human leukemia cell lines (e.g., Jurkat). See below for optimized protocol for primary leukemic cells (step E1, Part II). CAUTION: All subsequent steps are subject to biosafety level 2 regulations. Do not use the vacuum pump to suction supernatants to avoid aerosolizing virus.Day 1:Count target cells and place 1 million cells in 150 µl RPMI medium per well in a 24 well plate. Add polybrene to the target cells at a concentration of 8 µg/ml. Thaw viral supernatant quickly in a water bath and keep it on ice as soon as it is melted.Add 50 µl-1 ml viral supernatant(s) on top of the cells, depending on desired MOI (multiplicity of infection).Note: For multiple target knockouts mix virus particles to transduce with the mixture in one step or perform serial transduction. In particular for triple and quadruple knockouts serial transduction can improve efficiencies. Gently shake the plate to mix the cells with the viral supernatant.After 2 h bring up to 2 ml with fresh RPMI medium.Incubate overnight at 37 °C.Day 2:Centrifuge the cells and gently remove the supernatant by pipetting and replace with 1 ml fresh RPMI.Day 3:Repeat steps D1-D8 (Part II). You can repeat viral transduction up to three times if higher transduction rates are desired.",
    "Day 4:Take a small aliquot of cells and fix by adding the same volume of 4% formalin (final concentration 2%) and incubate on ice for 10 min. Proceed to determine the transduction efficiency via flow cytometry.For a pure knockout cell line we recommend performing single cell clones either by limiting dilution or flow cytometry sort. But for a first validation of knockout efficiency and biological phenotype of the knockout we recommend using the bulk population after one or two rounds of flow cytometry sorting. Notes: Cells should not be transduced with more than 70-80% efficiency because this leads to multiple insertion, toxicity and higher risk of insertional mutagenesis.Low transduction efficiency? Too high transduction? See notes in Table 2.Transduction of patient derived xenograft cells with pLentiCRISPR lentiviral particles (Timing 4 d)Notes:This protocol is optimized for human patient derived xenograft ALL cells (PDX). For some PDX it might be sufficient to use the transduction protocol with polybrene.Work with PDX is regulated by the Declaration of Helsinki. You should seek approval for animal experiments from your local animal care authority. Day 1:Thaw frozen PDX cells quickly in the water bath and transfer to a 15 ml Falcon tube as soon as the suspension is solvent.Add 10 times volume of cold RPMI medium drop by drop to thawed cells suspension, gently shake the tube when adding. Wash cells by centrifugation and resuspension in fresh medium.Count and seed 1 million cells per well in a 24 well plate in 1 ml medium and incubate at 37 °C overnight.Note: Low viability? See notes in Table 2.Dilute RetroNectin to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in PBS. RetroNectin can be aliquoted and frozen at -20 °C. Solution can be reused for 5 times. Thaw solution quickly in the water bath and put on ice afterwards.",
    "Coat a 6 well plate with 2 ml RetroNectin solution for either 2 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight.Day 2:Remove the RetroNectin solution and block for 30 min with 2 ml 2% (v/v) BSA/PBS at room temperature. You can transfer the RetroNectin to a fresh plate to coat for the second transduction round.Wash the plate with 3 ml HBSS/2.5% (v/v) HEPES per well.Thaw viral supernatant quickly in the water bath and keep it on ice as soon as it is melted.Note: For multiple target knockouts mix viral particles to transduce with the mixture in one step or perform serial transduction/transplantation cycles. In particular for triple and quadruple knockouts serial transduction can improve efficiencies. Discard the washing buffer from the plate and add 2 ml viral supernatant.Centrifuge the plate for 20 min at 4 °C and 750 x g.Discard the viral supernatant but do not allow the plate to dry.Repeat steps E10-E12 (Part II) for 3 times.Transfer target cells to virus coated plate and centrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C and 750 x g.Incubate at 37 °C overnight.Day 3:Wash the cells 3 times with 10 ml of PBS by centrifugation for 5 min at 750 x g, RT.Transplant the cells directly into immunocompromised mice.An aliquot of primary PDX cells can also be transferred onto mesenchymal stroma feeder cells to maintain their survival in vitro for later analysis.Day 4:48 h after transduction cells can be tested by flow cytometry for fluorescent protein expression to determine the transduction efficiency.Note: Fluorescence maximum might be reached between Day 3 and Day 5, but the life span of primary cells in vitro can be shorter. We recommend transplanting cells before the transduction efficiency is directly measured via flow cytometry.Part III.",
    "Expansion and confirmation of knockout clones Expansion of knockout clones in NSG mice (Timing transplantation 2 h, engraftment weeks to months)Count the cells and spin down the required number. Good transplantation rates can be obtained with 1 million cells, but as few as 100 cells can successfully engraft. Resuspend cells in 100 µl PBS per injection.Transplant cells via intravenous or intrafemural transplantation (for more details see Schmitz et al., 2011).Note: Institutional animal care guidelines must be followed. Animal experiments performed in the development of this protocol were approved by the veterinary office and the ethics commission of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.Keep mice under antibiotic treatment until termination of the experiment.Follow up the engraftment by regular bleeding, according to local legal regulations. We use approximately 20 µl of blood taken via tail vein puncture and a Microvette tube with lithium heparin. Dilute blood with PBS to 100 µl and add 900 µl red blood cell lysis buffer. Incubate for 5 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 750 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Wash cell pellet with 500 µl PBS and centrifuge again.Resuspend in 100 µl PBS with anti-human CD19-PECy7 antibody, as it will not interfere with any of the fluorescent proteins used here (dilution 1:1,000). Incubate for 20-30 min at 4 °C.Add 500 µl PBS and centrifuge again.Resuspend in 150 µl PBS and analyse by flow cytometry.Calculate the engraftment with following formula.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170329/20170329001235_6925.jpgCAUTION: Criteria for euthanasia have to be applied according to the animal experimentation approval as approved by the responsible authorities.Notes: Depending on the PDX human engraftment can be detected in the peripheral blood already after a few days, but spleen is small. Other patients show high engraftment in the bone marrow and spleen but only low levels in the blood.",
    "For each PDX we recommend checking the blood regularly and to palpate the spleen. No engraftment? See notes in Table 2.To generate pure patient-derived knockout ALL cells, we suggest to do serial transplantations after sort amplification.To harvest the PDX cells from the spleen, sacrifice the mouse according to institutional standards and isolate the spleen from the abdomen.Transfer the tissue to a cell strainer, force spleen through the strainer and wash with 10 ml PBS to create a single cell suspension. Dilute cell suspension 1:1 with RBC buffer and incubate for 5 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 750 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend pellet in PBS.Count the cells and prepare for flow cytometry sort.PAUSE POINT: PDX cells can be stored at -80 °C (short term) or in liquid nitrogen (long term). For this spin down the cells and resuspend up to 50 million cells in freezing medium and freeze carefully in a freezing container.Flow cytometry sorting of single and multi-knockout cells (Timing 2 h)Pellet cells by centrifugation at 750 x g for 5 min at RT and resuspend at 5 million cells per ml in PBS, or a cell concentration recommended by flow facility.Filter cell suspension through cell strainer cap of a round-bottom tube.Use hierarchical gating to sort populations of single, double, triple, and/or quadruple positive cells (see below Data analysis). In case of low transduction efficiencies follow a serial sorting strategy to first enrich single or double positive populations with an inclusive gating strategy. Cells can then be regrown and later sorted to isolate multi-knockout cells (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328222710_5418.jpgFigure 6. Sorting strategy for double and triple positive CRISPR cells. A. To purify single, double and triple transduced cells that are represented with a low frequency, first sort for one color.",
    "This population will include single, double and triple positive cells. B and C. After expansion in vitro in cell culture or in vivo in the mouse, cells can be resorted by flow cytometry specifically for the double and triple positive populations.Return cells to culture conditions, or re-transplant into mice for later resorting and/or confirmation of knockout.For cell lines we recommend sorting single cell clones.For this prepare a 96 well plate with 100 µl medium in each well and sort one cell per well.Culture the cells until cell numbers are high enough to confirm the knockout by Western blot. Note that we have observed better knockout frequencies in sorted CRISPR containing cells after at least 3 weeks (and as long as 6 weeks) in culture, although this likely varies between different cell types.Confirmation of gene knockout by Western blot (Timing 2 d)Day 1:Count the cells and collect them in a 1.5 ml tube. Centrifuge at 750 x g for 5 min at RT and wash the pellet with PBS.Pellet the cells again and add 1x SDS loading buffer at a concentration of 300,000 cells in 80 µl.Note: It is not recommended lysing less than 100,000 or more than 1 million cells.Completely lyse cells by vortexing and denature the proteins by incubating the samples at 95 °C for 5 min in a thermomixer. PAUSE POINT: After lysis samples can be stored at -20 °C for up to several months before later analysis.Assemble a Western blot chamber with a precast gel according to the manufacturer’s instructions and remove the comb.Pour fresh 1x MES running buffer to the top posterior chamber and fill it completely. Pour 1x MES buffer to the front chamber until the mark or until the lower end of the comb.",
    "Note: The 1x MES running buffer used in the top chamber must be fresh. For the front chamber the buffer can be reused for up to 3 times. Wash the wells to remove excess of storage buffer and loose pieces of gel by pipetting up and down the running buffer inside each well with a volume of around 100 µl.Load the cell lysates on the gel.For a 26 well gel load 10-15 µl of lysate per well and 3 µl of protein ladder.For an 18 well gel load 20-30 µl of lysate per well and 5 µl of protein ladder.Load the same volume of 1x SDS loading buffer in the empty wells to make the samples run straighter.Cover the Western blot chamber and run the gel at a constant voltage of 120 to 140 V (it will take 1 h 30 min to 45 min approximately) until the blue mark of the samples reaches the end of the gel.Remove the gel from the chamber and open the plastic covers carefully with a spatula. Remove the top part including the wells until over the top band of the marker. Assemble the transfer stack according to manufacturer’s instructions.Transfer the proteins from the gel to the membrane. We routinely use a Bio-Rad protocol optimized for high molecular weight proteins: 2.5 A and 25 V for 10 min.Note: Avoid touching the membrane with your hands.To check that the loading was even and the transfer was complete, incubate the membrane with a Ponceau S solution for 1 min and wash it with tap water. Wash the membrane once with TBS-T until most of the Ponceau S stain is removed and block the membrane for 1 h with 5% milk in TBS-T.",
    "Incubate the membrane with the primary antibody diluted according to manufacturer’s instructions under agitation either overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at RT. You can add sodium azide (0.01%, v/v) to store it at 4 °C and reuse it.Wash the membrane with TBS-T 4 x for 5 min each with agitation at RT.Incubate with the appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibody diluted 1:5,000 in 5% milk in TBS-T for 1 h at RT with agitation. Day 2:Wash the membrane with TBS-T 4 x for 5 min each with agitation at RT.To acquire the images, cover the membrane with super signal and incubate it for 1 min. Remove excess super signal and place the membrane on a plastic cover. Acquire the chemiluminescence and the white light for the ladder without moving the membrane. To probe for other proteins in the same membrane, wash it once with TBST-T and strip it with SDS glycine solution for 45 min to 1 h under agitation at RT. Wash it 4 x for 5 min with TBS-T and repeat steps C14-C19 (Part III). Note: No protein signal in positive control? No knockout? See notes in Table 2."
