    "1. Preparation of the GST enzyme solution\nNOTE: The procedure for preparing the enzyme solution depends upon whether or not the units of enzymatic activity are known before the assay. One enzymatic unit is the amount of enzyme needed to synthesize 1 µmol of product per minute. Enzymatic activity is represented in unit/mL or µmol/min/mL and depends on the dilution of the enzymatic solution. Specific enzymatic activity is represented in unit/mg or µmol/min/mg and depends solely on the purity of the solution. Both these characteristics are determined below. If the enzymatic unit of an isolated GST isoform is unknown, it must be estimated to adjust the enzymatic concentrations for each reaction and provide reproducible results.\nIf the enzymatic unit of the GST used in the assay is known:\n\t\nPrepare a fresh stock solution of the GST enzyme at 0.1 U/mL in water and then proceed with step 2.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution can be stored at -20 °C in aliquots for several months or at -80 °C for longer periods, but the freeze/thaw cycle must be avoided.\nIf the enzymatic unit of the GST used in the assay is unknown:\n\t\nQuantify the enzyme solution’s protein concentration using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, or any other kit.\nDilute the protein solution to a final protein concentration of 0.02 mg/mL.\nAdd 20 µL of the enzyme solution, 20 µL of GSH 25 mM (molecular weight: 307.32 g/mol), and 150 µL of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to a 96-well plate. For the blank, add 20 µL of water instead of the enzyme solution.\nAdd 10 µL of CDNB 50 mM (molecular weight: 202.55 g/mol) substrate to each well.",
    "On a spectrophotometric microplate reader, set the parameters for reading the wells at 340 nm. It is recommended to measure the absorbance every minute for 10 minutes.\nInsert the plate into the microplate reader, and start the reading according to settings of step 1.2.5.\nCalculate the change in absorbance per minute for the enzymatic samples and the blank.\n\t\tNOTE: Verify that the reaction is linear by plotting absorbance on y-axis and minutes on the x-axis. If the reaction is not linear and reaches a plateau, it means that all the substrate is used and the reaction is too quick. Thus, reduce the amount of enzyme added to the well by diluting the stock solution by two.\nBlank-correct the test samples’ absorbance readings.\nWith equation 1, representing the Beer–Lambert law, calculate the concentration of GS-DNB formed (in µM) by the reaction each minute.\nEquation 1:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61347/61347equ01v2.jpg\n\t\twhere C is the concentration of the substrate in µM, A340/min is the change in absorbance per minute, as measured in step 1.2.7, ε is the molar extinction coefficient for the CDNB conjugate at 340 nm (0.0096 µM-1*cm-1), and l is the length of the light path in the well (in cm). For a 96-well plate filled with 200 µL of enzymatic solution, the path length is around 0.55 cm. This value can vary according to the plate model and should be verified with the manufacturer.\nTo determine the amount of product present in one well in µmol/min, multiply the results found using equation 1 by the volume of solution, 2 x 10-4 L.\nNormalize the activity per amount of protein used by dividing the results of step 1.2.9 by 4 x 10-4 mg. The result is the specific enzymatic activity in unit/mg or µmol/min/mg.",
    "NOTE: If the dilution was changed in step 1.2.6, because of a non-linear reaction, adjust the protein amount accordingly.\nTo find the enzymatic activity, adjust the results to the protein concentration in mg/mL by multiplying the specific enzymatic activity found in step 1.2.10 by 0.002 mg/mL. This will give the enzymatic activity in unit/mL or µmol/min/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: In contrast to the enzymatic activity, this measure will not change depending on the dilution of the protein solution. Same note as step 1.2.10 but for the protein concentration.\nPrepare a stock solution of the GST enzyme at 0.1 unit/mL in water and then proceed with step 2.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution can be stored at -20 °C in aliquots for several months or at -80 °C for longer periods, but the freeze/thaw cycle must be avoided. Control of the enzymatic activity is recommended if the experiments are conducted during an extended period of time as degradation of the protein solution might occur.\n2. Measurement of the Michaelis–Menten constant of the GST isoform for CDNB\nNOTE: The procedure is explained for a CDNB substrate but can be applied to any other substrate, such as GSH. Each concentration of CDNB needs its own blank, as the absorbance at 340 nm will increase according to the CDNB concentration.\nPrepare six different concentrations of CDNB, ranging from 10 mM to 100 mM, in ethanol 95% (v/v).\nPrepare the assay solution, with 10 µL of CDNB, 20 µL of GST enzyme, 20 µL of GSH 25 mM, and 150 µL DPBS. For the blank, instead of the CDNB solution, add only 10 µL of ethanol 95%.\nPrepare a blank for each CDNB concentration, with 10 µL of CDNB, 20 µL of water, 20 µL of GSH 25 mM, and 150 µL DPBS.",
    "Record the absorbance at 340 nm every minute for 10 minutes with a microplate reader.\nBlank-correct the absorbance by subtracting the results from the blank from that of the correct other test wells. According to the measured values, calculate the velocity of the reaction using Equation 2.\nEquation 2:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61347/61347equ02v2.jpg\n\twhere A340/min is the experimentally determined change in absorbance per minute, Vtotal (total volume) equals 0.2 mL, Venzyme (volume of enzyme) is 0.02 mL, and εGS-DNB is the molar extinction coefficient of the GS-DNB conjugate at 340 nm (9.6 mM-1*cm-1). In a 200 µL well of a 96-well plate, the path length is 0.55 cm (depending on the plate type) and the extinction coefficient equals 5.3 mM-1. The velocity can be represented either by µmol/mL/min or mM/min.\nPlot the Michaelis–Menten graph with the velocity (on the y-axis) against the substrate concentration (on the x-axis).\nDefine the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction and the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) (i.e., the substrate concentration at half of Vmax).\n\tNOTE: Using software such as GraphPad Prism, the enzyme kinetics curve can be fitted using a non-linear regression for the calculation of the Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics parameters, such as Vmax and Km.\nPrepare a CDNB stock solution at 20 times the calculated Km in ethanol 95% (v/v).\n3. Absorbance of the potential GST inhibitor\nNOTE: This step is performed to investigate whether the potential GST inhibitor used in the reaction produces a metabolite that increases absorbance at the wavelength being measured. If it does, the amount of inhibitor used will have an impact on the results and a specific blank should be prepared for each concentration.\nDilute the inhibitor to the required concentrations.",
    "NOTE: Prepare three different dilutions, preferably the lowest, middle, and highest concentrations tested during the inhibition assay. The maximum DMSO concentration in the well should be equal to or less than 1% (v/v). We tested the DMSO concentration’s effect on the assay in our laboratory, and 1% did not significantly change GST activity.\nIn a 96-well plate, add 2 µL of the potential GST inhibitor, 20 µL of GSH 25 mM, and 168 µL of DPBS. Use an appropriate control, with no inhibitor, by adding equal volumes of the solvent used for the inhibitor samples.\nIncubate the reaction for 10 minutes, to begin the enzymatic reaction.\n\tNOTE: This step can be optimized, by testing different incubation times, with the twin aims of beginning the reaction while avoiding total depletion of the substrate.\nAdd 10 µL of CDNB to each well to achieve a final concentration at the Km found in step 2.\nShake the plate for few seconds.\nRecord the absorbance at 340 nm every minute for 10 minutes with a microplate reader.\nCalculate the change in absorbance per minute.\nVerify the change in absorbance compared to both the blank reaction and the negative control reaction with no inhibitor.\n\t\nIf there is a significant change, use blank for each inhibitor concentration in order to adjust the results.\n\t\tNOTE: This result indicates that the reaction’s constituents, with no GST enzyme, react spontaneously and produce a metabolite that increases absorbance at 340 nm. To correct for this additional absorbance, a specific blank should be measured for each concentration.\nIf there is no significant change in absorbance, use a general blank, containing only the solvent used for the GST inhibitor dilution, for all the concentrations.\n4. Inhibition assay of GST and IC50 assessment\nPrepare nine concentrations of the potential GST inhibitor.",
    "NOTE: The concentrations can be adapted according to the results. The aim is to define the bottom and top plateaus of the non-linear regression curve. See the discussion section for more details about this step.\nPrepare the assay solution by diluting 20 µL of the GSH solution at 25 mM with 148 µL of DPBS. Adapt the volume according to the number of wells used in the assay.\nIn a clear 96-well plate, prepare the enzymatic reaction in a final volume of 190 µL. It is recommended to use a multichannel pipette for these steps.\n\t\nFor the test wells, add 20 µL of the enzyme solution, 2 µL of the potential GST inhibitor solution and 168 µL of the assay solution.\nFor the control, add 20 µL of the enzyme solution, 2 µL of the diluent used for the GST inhibitor and 168 µL of the assay solution.\nFor the blank wells, add 20 µL of water, 2 µL of the potential GST inhibitor and 168 µL of the assay solution.\n\t\tNOTE: If the GST inhibitor absorbs the 340 nm wavelength, then a specific blank should be prepared for each concentration tested.\nAdd 10 µL of the CDNB solution at 20x Km to each well, including the blank. It is recommended to use a multichannel pipette for this step.\nShake the plate for few seconds.\nMeasure the absorbance at 340 nm every minute for 10 minutes using a microplate reader.\nBlank-correct the absorbance by subtracting the results from the test well blanks.\nNormalize the results by dividing the values obtained using the GST inhibitor solution by the control’s absorbance per minute with no inhibitor.\nPlot the non-linear regression graphs of the logarithmic concentration (x-axis) of the inhibitor against the GST activity (y-axis), and thus determine the IC50.",
    "NOTE: GraphPad Prism calculates the IC50 from the non-linear regression plots by predicting the concentration that will show 50% of the enzymatic activity in the control. The prediction is based on the bottom and top plateaus, as well as the curve of the slope formed by the sigmoid graph.\n5. Assessment of the Kiand the type of inhibition\nPrepare four different CDNB concentrations: three higher and one equal to the Km previously found.\nPrepare three different GST inhibitor concentrations, equal to or below the previously found IC50.\nPerform the inhibition assay as described in steps 4.2 to 4.7.\nCalculate the velocity of the reactions using Equation 2.\nPlot the Michaelis–Menten graphs for each inhibitor concentration and calculate the Vmax and Km of each reaction.\nAccording to the changes in Vmax and Km when using different concentrations, assess the GST inhibitor’s mode of inhibition.\n\tNOTE: This step is explained in more detail in the results and discussion sections.\nBased on the mode of inhibition, calculate the Ki.\n\tNOTE: In GraphPad Prism, different equations will be used to calculate the Ki according to the nature of the inhibition. The equations used are based on the observed Km and Vmax after addition of the inhibitor and compared to the control’s Km and Vmax."
