    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nPart A. Preparation of Elastic Nano-textured Patterns\nThe soft elastically deformable PAA-based nano-textures are manufactured by confining the polymerizing PAA premixes (of chosen shear modulus G’ formulation) with molding negative replica of the desired nano-texture design. The cross-linking between biotin and streptavidin is used to functionalize the PAA surfaces with a protein of interest. Streptavidin is introduced directly into PAA premix (see Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) as a streptavidin-acrylamide (streptavidin-AA) conjugate (Thermo Fisher) whereas biotin ester tags (Sigma-Aldrich) the protein of interest (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details). The negative molding replica used for molding confinement is precoated with biotin-tagged protein of interest for better efficiency of protein-PAA cross-linking. Optionally, protein of interest is also pre-labeled with a fluorescent tag for further nano-texture visualization (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details).\nManufacturing PAA Molding Casts\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the generation of molding casts - negative PDMS replicas of the substrate topography prototype (positive master) used for casting the PAA nano-textured surfaces.\nNote: As a positive master, we use either the pre-passivated silicon-crystal matrix (UMN NanoCenter, MN, USA), fabricated via photoresist development method (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, step 1) or textured polyurethane nano-surfaces (NanoSurface Biomedical, Seattle, WA), glued onto the glass slide with SuperGlue® (Loctite, USA) and passivated with silanization solution-I (Sigma-Aldrich) as per commercial protocol[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/1/sl2pis.pdf].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/27-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Fabrication of the Elastic Polyacrylamide Protein-Functionalized Nano-Topographies\n(A) Passivated mold (matrix) with nano-features is either prepared commercially via conventional photoresist silicone crystal development or assembled from the polyurethane nano-surfaces (Nanosurface Biomedical, Seattle) by gluing the circular nano-features surfaces to the glass-slide with the following silanization in Silanization Solution-I (Sigma-Aldrich) (1).",
    "(B) Casting hPDMS-based mold: hPDMS premix 5 μL droplet (2 - arrowhead) is “sandwiched” between baked (450°C) plasma-treated cover-glass and the molding matrix (3 - dashed contour) to a submillimeter thickness. hPDMS in the “sandwich” is cured at ∼70°C, 30 minutes, then peeled from the casting surface together with cover-glass (4), and cut in ∼1 cm2 square pieces (5).\n(C) hPDMS molds placed “face-up” atop of the regular PDMS blocks (rPDMS pedestal) (6) to stick and immobilize the pieces. 5-7 μL droplet of the fluorescently labeled biotinylated 200 mg/mL protein of interest solution is “sandwiched” between the hPDMS molding surface and clean pre-baked coverglass (7-8).\n(D) ∼7 μL of PAA premix droplet is “sandwiched” between 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate-coated glass-bottom of 35 mm Petri dish and rinsed and dried protein-coated hPDMS mold (9-10 - hPDMS is oriented “face-down” toward the PAA). After 5 minutes the cured PAA “sandwich” is incubated in deionized water or Q-water for 30 minutes at 20-25°C or at +4°C for 8-24 hours. Glass-bottom Petri dishes with Q-water then placed into ultrasonication chamber for 10-30 seconds to release the hPDMS molds from the PAA gel (11). If hPDMS mold is not released on its own, gently peel the mold manually (12). The nano-textured soft PAA surface is examined for the quality and defects via 3D microscopy (13).\nNote: Use hard PDMS (hPDMS) (Odom et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) instead of the regular PDMS (rPDMS) air-containing xerogels (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details). hPDMS xerogel features a higher structural density than that of rPDMS, significantly reducing the diffusion of oxygen-containing air from hPDMS bulk into the molded PAA premix that otherwise inhibits PAA polymerization at the PAA/hPDMS interface and compromises the PAA nano-texture quality.",
    "Note: We use rectangular cover-glasses (24✕60 mm, #1 thickness, Premium™ cover-glass, Fisher Finest®, Fisher Scientific) as the bearing base for the negative hPDMS replica.\nPlasma-treat the baked cover-glasses (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) for 2 minutes in the low pressure, thin rarefied air, generated by vacuum pump (Platinum DV-142N 5CFM, USA), and ionized into plasma at 18W (maximum power setting) in the basic plasma cleaner/sterilizer (Harrick, PDC-32 G, USA), immediately before casting of the hPDMS.\nPut a 5-7 μL droplet of hPDMS between passivated master mold and plasma-treated cover-glass (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, steps 2 and 3) and then bake at 70°C for 30 min.\nPause Point: Fully cured casts are stable for several weeks at 20-25°C.\nGently peel the cured molding cast off the master mold together with its bearing base (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, step 4), and cut into the 1✕1 cm squares (Figure 1 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, step 5) by diamond pencil scribbling (on the reverse side of nano-surface).\nPause Point: Fully cured casts are stable for several weeks at 20-25°C.\nPrecoating of Molding Casts with Protein of Interest\nTiming: 1 or 12 h\nThis section describes the precoating of molding casts with protein of interest for better efficiency of protein-PAA cross-linking.\nNote: We precoat molding casts with biotinylated and fluorescent tag-labeled protein of interest (in our case - Fab fragments of anti-Fcγ antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) in 0.2 mg/mL PBS solution (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details).",
    "Put a 5-7 μL droplet of protein of interest solution atop of the hPDMS mold and cover it by the round 15 mm pre-baked cover-glass (Carolina Biological Supply Company) (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) in the “sandwich” fashion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, steps 6-7) to economize the use of protein solution and to ensure its even distribution. Incubate at 20-25°C for 40 minutes or at +4°C for 8-12 hours in a wet chamber (20✕160 mm Petri dish with Q-water-wetted tissue or cotton balls).\nAfter incubation, gently rinse the casting mold in deionized Q-water and gently dry it under the jet of filtered air, nitrogen or argon (Figure 1 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), use immediately.\nCasting PAA Nano-textures\nTiming: 24 h\nThis section describes the casting of PAA nano-textures using molding casts precoated with protein of interest.\nNote: We degas streptavidin-conjugated polyacrylamide premix (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for PAA premix formulations) of volume not greater than 0.5 mL in a vacuum chamber or in an ultrasonication water bath for 1 hour (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) before casting the PAA nano-topographic surfaces. To avoid TEMED degradation and evaporation during degassing procedure, we recommend to add TEMED after the degassing session.\nNote: We activate glass-bottom 35 mm Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) using 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details). Add 100 μL of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate to 20 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol, followed by the addition of the 600 μL of 10% acetic acid (water solution) and mix well prior to covering the glass-bottom Petri dishes. After 3 minutes of incubation, Petri dishes are rinsed with ethanol, dried and immediately used for PAA casting.",
    "Immediately before PAA nano-texture casting, mix the 7-10 μL volume of PAA premix of desired projected shear modulus G’ (see Table 1 [href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with ammonium persulfate solution (Fluka Analytical), and “sandwich” it as a single droplet between protein-coated casting mold and activated with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl glass-bottom 35 mm Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]D, steps 9 and 10).\nAfter PAA curing (1-5 minutes), place the resultant textured PAA nano-chip in cold deionized Q-water for 8-10 hours for reversible hypotonic “swelling” of PAA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) to loosen the steric interaction between the molding cast and PAA.\nNote: The PAA gel “swelling” is reversible and does not cause any structural damage to the PAA nano-surface.\nGently peel molding casts from the polymerized PAA surface with sharp tweezers. For the better molding nano-surface release from the cured PAA gel, gently apply pressure in the middle of the glass-bottom of the Petri dish from outside to generate the dome-like glass-bottom surface deformation, directed inward of Petri dish. The dome-like (i.e. spherical or bi-axial) deformation allows for an effective, yet gentle peeling of the molding nano-surface off the molded nano-textured PAA gel surfaces.\nOptional: For a better release of the sterically interactive nano-mold, hypotonically treated PAA “sandwiches” were optionally ultrasonicated in the water bath (Cole-Parmer ultrasonic cleaner with timer and temperature control, Model 8891, Cole-Parmer, USA) at 37°C for 10 seconds (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D, step 11). This step is particularly relevant to the nano-textures of low shear moduli, as soft PAA gel is susceptible to the structural damage during the casting mold peeling process.",
    "Critical: The incorrect peeling may cause structural damage to the PAA nano-texture surface. There is no possibility of reversing the damage caused to the PAA surface if the peeling of the molding nano-surface off the PAA gel fails. The percentage of the successfully peeled off substrates is usually ∼50%.\nCritical: The poor PAA polymerization or poor definition of the PAA nano-texture features are usually caused by the presence of oxygen in the PAA premixes. To avoid this issue, repeat the PAA premix degassing procedure before casting the PAA nano-topographic surfaces (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details).\nPlace released PAA nano-textures into isotonic PBS solution for 5 minutes to reverse PAA hypotonic swelling and check for the surface quality under the microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D, steps 12 and 13). PAA nano-textures are not sterile and can be stored in PBS at +4°C only for several days.\nPause Point: PAA nano-textured can be stored at +4°C in the dark for several weeks. Optionally, add 0.01% sodium azide as a protein preservative to prevent bacterial contamination of the protein-coated PAA surfaces.\nNote: We incubate successfully released PAA nano-textures with 200 μg/mL ICAM1-Fc (Sino Biological, China) solution in cold PBS (4°C, 8-12 hours), rinse with cold PBS, and immediately use for the T cell adhesion and contact guidance assays.\nPause Point: ICAM1-coated PAA surfaces can be stored for up to a week at +4°C in the dark.\nPart B. Preparation of High Precision 2D Nano-patterns",
    "Nano-patterns provide a powerful tool to study directed migration (Ray et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Taddanov et al, 2018b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). However, fabrication of flat elastic nano-patterns by the traditional soft lithography methods is a challenging task due to the suboptimal size of the printing bas-relief features of the nano-stamp. To address these issues and achieve high precision and definition for the resulting nano-patterns on elastic platforms we substituted regular soft PDMS (rPDMS) nano-stamps with the composite stamps. We combined soft cushioning rPDMS block with a veneering submillimeter-thick layer of hard PDMS (hPDMS, See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) that features rigid non-collapsing printing bas-relief nano-features ( Schmid and Michel, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Shen et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Tabdanov et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Thus, in this design, a soft rPDMS cushioning layer provides an even pressure distribution onto the hPDMS printing veneer for the even lithographic contact with the printed surface, while the submillimeter thickness of the non-collapsing printing layer prevents the effects of hPDMS fragility.\nCasting of Nano-stamps\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the generation of nano-stamps casts - negative PDMS replicas of the substrate topography prototype (positive master) used for nano-contact printing.\nNote: We use commercially manufactured polyurethane nano-surface disks (NanoSurface Biomedical, Seattle, WA) and the pre-passivated silicon-crystal matrix, commercially manufactured via photoresist development method (UMN NanoCenter, MN, USA) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) as the casting matrices. Textured nano-surface disks (NanoSurface Biomedical, Seattle, WA) were glued onto the glass platform with SuperGlue® (Loctite, USA) and passivated with silanizing solution-I as per the commercial protocol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, step 1) (Sigma Aldrich).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/27-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Fabrication of the Elastic Polyacrylamide Protein-Functionalized Nano-Patterns",
    "(A) Preparation of the composite nano-stamp: thin submillimeter layer of hPDMS premix is spread atop of the molding matrix passivated surface (manually or by spin-coating), cured at ∼70°C for 30 minutes. Regular PDMS (rPDMS) premix layer is poured at the top of the hPDMS layer to the final stamp thickness of ∼7 mm and consequently cured at ∼7°C for 1 hour. Cured composite PDMS is gently peeled off the matrix (1) and cut in ∼0.5-1 cm2 pieces (2, 3). For the composite double protein nano-grids printing, prepare 2 rectangular cover-glasses and label them as shown on (4).\n(B) Composite nano-stamps are coated with 5-7 μL of protein of interest (200 mg/mL, fluorescent, biotinylated) by “sandwiching” the protein solution between the stamp’s surface and clean coverglass in the wet chember (3) for at least 40 minutes at 20-25°C or at +4°C for 8-12 hours. Protein-coated, rinsed and dried nano-stamps are placed on the rectangular cover-glass (5) and aligned to the cover-glass’ edges either vertically or horizontally (6).\n(C) Clean dust-free cover-glass (“intermediate surface”) pieces are immobilized on the glass-slides with the Scotch-Tape™ (7). The protein-coated nano-stamp is gently placed with its printing surface facing the “intermediate” surface cover-glass, in one-touch movement with holding coverglass edges aligned to the glass-slide edges (8). A weight (∼100 g) is placed atop of the nano-stamp to ensure a proper nano-contact stamping.\nNote: For the convenience the weight’s bottom must be wet to ensure easy removal of the weigh together with the nano-stamp in one movement (9). For the dual protein grid printing, repeat steps 4-9 with the second protein of interest and nano-lines orientation orthogonal to the orientation of the previously printed nanolines.",
    "(D) 5-7 μL of PAA premix (10) of desired projected rigidity is “sandwiched” between 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate-coated glass-bottom of 35 mm Petri dish and nano-patterned “intermediate” surface, facing the PAA solution (11), to ensure submillimeter thickness of PAA gel. After gel polymerization (∼5 minutes) the Petri dish is filled with Q-water for 30 minutes at 20-25°C or at +4°C for 8-24 hours (12).\n(E) After hypotonic incubation the Petri dishes are briefly ultrasonicated for 10-30 seconds (13) and “intermediate’ cover glasses are peeled off the PAA gels (14). The microscopy-inspected for quality of the nano-patterns substrates are used for experiments (15).\nCoat silanized plastic nano-surface or silicone crystal matrix with ≤0.5 mm hPDMS gently spreading it with soft Parafilm-made spatula (Hach, USA), and then cure matrix at 70°C for 30 minutes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAfter hPDMS layer rigidification, pour the rPDMS atop of the hPDMS to the layer’s final thickness of 8 mm. Cure at 70°C for ∼1 hour.\nPause Point: Fully cured casts are stable for several weeks at 20-25°C.\nGently peel composite nano-stamps from the master matrix, and cut into 5✕5 mm or 1✕1 cm ready-to-use nano-stamp pieces (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, step 1).\nPause Point: Fully cured casts are stable for several weeks at 20-25°C.\nCoating of Nano-stamps with Protein of Interest\nTiming: 1 or 12 h\nThis section describes the precoating of nano-stamps with protein of interest for printing on “intermediate” cover-glass.\nPlace 5 μL droplets of 0.2 mg/mL solution of biotin- and fluorophore-labelled (see section 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. for more detail) protein of interest (anti-collagen type-1 (AbCam) antibody or Fab fragments of anti-Fcγ antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch)) atop of the 5✕5 mm or 1✕1 cm square nano-stamps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, step 2).",
    "Note: To ensure an effective stamp surface coating with protein of interest, “sandwich” protein solution droplet between the stamp’s printing surface and pre-baked 15 mm round glass coverslip (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) (Carolina, USA) as shown on Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] (step 2).\nIncubate the nano-stamps with “sandwiched” droplet of protein of interest solution for 40 minutes at 20-25°C or for ∼8-12 hours at +4°C in wet chamber (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, step 3).\nPause Point: Incubation in the wet chamber can be utilized as a pause point, 40 min or 8-12 hours.\nAfter the coating session the nano-stamps were gently rinsed in deionized milli-Q water (Q-water) and gently dried under the jet of filtered air, nitrogen or argon, and then used for nano-printing.\nNano-Contact Printing\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the printing of nano-patterns on “intermediate” cover-glass surface using nano-stamps pre-coated with protein of interest.\nNote: For elastic hydrogel micro- and nano-patterning we adopted an “intermediate substrate” technique in which biotin-conjugated protein micro- and nano-patterns were initially printed on “intermediate” cover-glass, then transferred onto hydrogels by cross-linking patterned proteins’ biotin tags to streptavidin-conjugated polyacrylamide (PAA) (Tang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nNote: To print nano-grids composed of two sets of orthogonally intersecting parallel nano-lines, constituted of two different proteins of interest, we use Alexa Fluor™ 568 fluorophore- and biotin-prelabeled anti-collagen rabbit pAb, and Alexa Fluor™ 488 fluorophore- and biotin-prelabeled Fab fragments of anti-Fcγ antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch).",
    "To ensure the orthogonality of the grid, align the nano-stamps’ nano-lines features directionality to the edges of the rectangular “loading” cover-glass (Figure 2 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], steps 4 and 5), to which the nano-stamps are attached by their non-printing rPDMS “sticky” side. Align the “loading” cover-glass horizontally or vertically to the microscope object table with the hand-made ruler and/or protractor. Use of the DIC microscope with the external monitor helps to align the nano-stamp to the pre-aligned “loading” cover-glass for the precise horizontal or vertical positioning of the corresponding lines patterns (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], steps 5 and 6): e.g. vertically for protein of interest #1 and horizontally for the protein of interest #2.\nImmobilize clean (not pre-baked) cut 1✕1 cm square “intermediate” cover-glasses to the glass-slide by a scotch-tape (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 7). The composite double protein nano-grid is printed in two printing sessions, one for each of the lines set.\nFirst session, gently place vertically oriented nano-stamp with protein of interest #1 atop of the immobilized cover-glass, with the edges of “loading” cover-glass aligned to the edges of the glass-slide with the immobilized “intermediate” cover-glass with nano-stamp’s printing surface facing down towards the “intermediate” cover-glass (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, step 8).\nTo ensure a tight lithographic seal between the nano-stamp and “intermediate” cover-glass, gently place 100 gram weight atop of the “loading” cover-glass for 30 seconds (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, step 9).\nCritical: To ensure an accurate, one-step removal of the nano-stamps, wet the bottom of the weight with a little amount of water, to provide a capillary “stickiness” between the weight and the “loading” cover-glass.\nFollowing 30 seconds of lithographic seal between the nano-stamp and “intermediate” cover-glass, gently remove the weight in one step together with the capillary effect-attached “loading cover-glass and the nano-stamp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, step 9).",
    "Second session, repeat the procedure (18-20) with the same “intermediate” cover-glass and with horizontally oriented nano-stamp, coated with the protein of interest #2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, steps 8-9).\nPause Point: Nano-printed intermediate glass surfaces can be stored in the dark for up to 2 hours at 20-25°C.\nTransferring Nano-patterns onto PAA Gels\nTiming: 24 h\nThis section describes the transfer of proteins printed on the “intermediate” cover-glass surface to PAA nano-textures via cross-linking of nano-patterned proteins to the polymerizing PAA gels.\nMix a 7-10 μL droplet of PAA with projected mechanical rigidity (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with APS in the center of the freshly prepared thoroughly dried 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-functionalized glass-bottom Petri dish (See Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for more details) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D, steps 10)\nGently place “Intermediate” cover-glass with pre-printed nano-pattern face-down atop of the droplet to form a PAA “sandwich” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D, steps 11).\nCritical: PAA begins polymerization immediately after APS addition, both 22 and 23 steps must be performed within ∼10 seconds.\nCritical: To ensure proper polymerization, wait at least 20 minutes before going to the release step.\nGently release cover-glass from PAA gel by reversible hypotonic “swelling” in deionized Q-water (8-12 hours at +4°C or at 20-25°C for 40 minutes) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D, step 12).\nOptional: For easy and gentle “intermediate” cover-glass release from the cured PAA, use an optional ultrasonication session of the “sandwiched” PAA gel in Q-water for ∼10-30 seconds (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E,  steps 13 and 14). This step is particularly relevant for the PAA gels of low shear moduli (G’<16 kPa), susceptible to the structural damage during mechanical peeling of the “intermediate” cover-glass.\nPlace released PAA nano-textures into isotonic PBS solution for 5 minutes to reverse PAA hypotonic swelling and check for the printing quality under the microscope.",
    "Pause Point: Nano-patterned PAA surfaces can be stored for up to a week in the dark in PBS with 0.25% sodium azide.\nCritical: Thoroughly rinse the PAA surfaces before utilization from cytotoxic sodium azide.\nNote: The resultant fluorescent PAA nano-patterns of α-collagen-1 (red) and α-Fcγ Fab (green) we incubate in two steps:\nThe α-collagen-1 nano-lines sets are functionalized with 1 mg/mL rat monomeric collagen type-I (Corning, NY) in cold PBS (Gibco) at +4°C for 8-24 hours, and then rinsed (cold PBS).\nThe α-Fcγ Fab nano-lines sets are functionalized with 200 μg/mL human E-cadherin-Fc chimeric protein (Sino Biological, China), PBS solution, +4°C, for 8-24 hours, then rinsed and used for experiments (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], steps 14 and 15)."
