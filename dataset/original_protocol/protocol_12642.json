    "1. Embryoid body generation from mouse embryonic stem cells\nPrepare mESC serum-free culture medium: DMEM/F12 and neurobasal medium mixed at a ratio of 1:1. The culture medium is supplemented with MEM non-essential amino acids solution (1x), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/mL), beta-mercaptoethanol (50 µM), N2 and B27 supplements (1x), PD0325901 (1 µM), CHIR99021 (3 µM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (1,000 U/mL).\nPrepare EB differentiation medium: DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MEM non-essential amino acids (1x), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/mL), beta-mercaptoethanol (50 µM).\nCulture mESCs on 10 cm plastic dishes precoated with 0.1% (w/v) gelatin in mESC culture serum-free medium.\nWhen mESCs reach 60% confluency, remove culture medium and wash gently 1x with 2 mL of sterilized PBS.\nRemove PBS completely and add 2 mL of cell detachment medium. Incubate the culture dish at 37 °C for 5 min.\nInactivate the reaction by adding 8 mL of EB differentiation medium into the dish.\nDissociate mESC colonies by pipetting up and down 15-20 times to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min and carefully remove the supernatant.\nCount cells (e.g., using a hemocytometer).\nResuspend the cell pellet with EB differentiation medium and adjust the concentration to 2 x 104 cells/mL.\nInvert the lid of a 15 cm culture dish and use a 200 µL multichannel pipette to deposit 20 µL drops of resuspended cells (~400 cells/drop) on the lid.\nInvert the lid carefully onto the bottom chamber and incubate the dish with hanging drops at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 3 days.",
    "Collect the EBs by washing the lid gently with 10 mL of PBS and transfer the EB-containing suspension to a 50 mL plastic tube.\nPlace the tube at RT for 30 min, so that the EBs will sink to the bottom by gravity. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the EBs gently with 10 mL of fresh EB differentiation medium and transfer to a 10 cm bacteriological Petri dish.\nCheck EB formation 3-6 days later using an inverted microscope. The EBs generated should be round and homogeneous in size.\nIncubate the cultures at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. EBs will continue to differentiate into the three germ layers and can be collected at various timepoints for analysis.\n2. Dissociation of EBs\nCollect the EBs from two to three 10 cm dishes into a 50 mL plastic tube. Centrifuge the EBs at 300 x g at RT for 5 min, then carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the EBs with 10 mL of PBS. Centrifuge EBs at 300 x g at RT for 3 min and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) to the pellet and incubate the tube at 37 °C for 15 min.

Store at -80 °C or proceed with the protocol below.\n4. Cell lysis and restriction enzyme digest\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 0.25 mL of freshly prepared ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA630, and 1x protease inhibitors) per 2-5 x 106 cells. To prepare 5 mL of lysis buffer, see Table 1.\nIncubate the cells for 15 min on ice.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.

Mix well by pipetting, avoiding excessive foaming.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 15 min.",
    "Add 25 µL of digestion buffer, mix by inverting, and take 8 µL as an undigested control. Keep the undigested control sample at -20 °C. Add 100 U MboI restriction enzyme (4 µL of a 25 U/µL stock) to the remaining nuclei and digest the chromatin for 2 h at 37 °C under rotation. Add another aliquot of 100 U of MboI and incubate for an additional 2 h.\nAdd another 100 U of MboI and incubate under rotation overnight at 37 °C.\nThe next day, add another 100 U of MboI and incubate for 3 h at 37 °C under rotation.\nTake 8 µL as a digested control sample. De-crosslink digested control samples and the undigested control samples from step 4.8 by adding 80 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH = 8, 1 mM EDTA) and 10 µL of proteinase K (10 mg/mL). Incubate at 65 °C for 1 h.\nRun 20 µL aliquots on a 0.6% gel to check digestion efficiency. Successful digestions show mostly fragments in the 3.0-0.5 kb range.\n5. Proximity ligation and crosslink reversal\nIncubate the MboI-digested samples at 65 °C in a heating block for 20 min to inactivate MboI, then cool to RT.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 5 min at 1,000 x g at RT, remove the supernatant, and dissolve the pellet in 200 µL of fresh ligase buffer.\nAdd 1,000 µL of the ligation master mix to each sample. To prepare 1,000 µL of the ligation master mix, see Table 2.\nMix by inverting and incubate at RT overnight with slow rotation (9 rpm).\nEliminate RNA and protein residues by adding 100 µL of proteinase K (10 mg/mL) and 10 µL of RNase A (10 mg/mL). Incubate samples at 55 °C for 45-60 min.",
    "Continue incubating samples at 65 °C for an additional 4 h.\n6. DNA shearing and size selection\nCool tubes to RT.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.\nSplit the sample into three 400 µL aliquots in 2 mL tubes and add 2 µL of glycogen (20 mg/m), 40 µL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH = 5.2), and 2.5x volumes (1 mL) of 100% ethanol to each tube.

If necessary, use pipetting to resuspend any precipitate.\nMeasure the DNA yield; 2.5-5 µg of chromatin can be expected for 1 x 106 cells. Check the ligation by running ± 200 ng of the 3C product on a 0.6% agarose gel. Successful ligations mostly show DNA fragments > 3 kb. Store the samples at -20 °C.\nDilute a sample in a 0.65 mL tube suitable for sonication to 10 ng/µL in 100 µL of 1x Tris buffer volume (1 µg per tube).

    "Shear DNA to a size of 150-700 bp (average = 400-500 bp) using the following parameters on the sonicator: Cycles: 6-8 of 20 s on -60 s off. This should make the DNA suitable for high-throughput sequencing library preparation using Illumina sequencers.\nTransfer the sheared DNA to a normal new safe-lock tube.
