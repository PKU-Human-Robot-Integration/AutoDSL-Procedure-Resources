    "All animal studies were approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Culturing Cortical Astrocytes from Neonatal Mice\nPreparation\n\t\nCrumple 2-3 delicate task tissues and place into the bottom of a flask containing 70% ethanol. Place dissecting scissors, curved forceps and 2 pairs of straight micro forceps into this flask. The tissues are used to avoid bending the micro forceps.\nAdd 1 ml of HBSS to a 60 mm tissue culture dish. Prepare a separate dish for each animal and maintain dishes on ice.\nAnesthetize animals per institutional regulations.\nWarm 7 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (complete DMEM) for each animal in a 37 °C water bath. NOTE: For 5 mice, steps 1.1.1-1.1.4 will take ~15 min.\nTissue Harvest\n\t\nSacrifice neonatal mouse (day 1-3) per institutional regulations.\nRemove dissecting scissors from ethanol, allow them to drip dry, and make a sagittal cut in the skin over the cranium from the spinal cord to the nose.\nMake a cut in the cranium along the sagittal suture, starting from the spinal cord and extending past the olfactory bulbs. Take care to keep the scissor tips near the inner surface of the cranium to minimize brain tissue damage.\nUsing curved forceps, gently peel each hemisphere of the cranium laterally away from the brain.\nUsing straight micro forceps, gently pinch away the dorsal portion of each cortical hemisphere and place it into the tissue culture dish containing HBSS. Take care to avoid the cerebellum and olfactory bulb. Do not take any tissue below the corpus callosum.\nUsing a dissecting microscope and 2 pairs of micro forceps, gently remove the meninges from each cortical hemisphere. Return the tissue culture dish to ice until beginning tissue homogenization.",
    "Repeat steps 1.2.1 through 1.2.6 for each additional animal. NOTE: For 5 mice, steps 1.2.1-1.2.7 will take ~30 min.\nTissue Homogenization\n\t\nUsing a clean razor blade, finely dice the cortical hemispheres and move the plate to a tissue culture hood.\nTransfer the diced tissue into a sterile 15 ml conical tube. Wash the plate with 1 ml of ice cold HBSS and transfer to the tube containing tissue.\nWait until tissue settles to the bottom of the tube, then carefully remove excess HBSS using a pipette.\nAdd 2 ml of room temperature trypsin/EDTA. Pipette ~10x with a 1 ml pipette to further dissociate cells.\nIncubate the cell suspension at 37 °C for 15 - 20 min. Carefully mix by inversion every 5 min.\nAdd 3 ml of complete DMEM to inhibit trypsin. Pipette ~10x with a 1 ml pipette to mix the solution.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant with a 1 ml pipette. Do not aspirate the medium because the pellet may be loose.\nResuspend the pellet in 4 ml of 37 °C complete DMEM. Transfer the cell suspension to a 75 cm screw top tissue culture flask. NOTE: For 5 mice, steps 1.3.1-1.3.9 will take ~50 min.\nApproximately 16 hr after astrocyte harvest, wash the flask with 4 ml of 37 °C HBSS, then add 4 ml of 37 °C complete DMEM. Maintain the cortical astrocytes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. NOTE: The wash step is important for removal of non-adherent cells and debris from the culture dish.",
    "When the culture is ~95% confluent, shake overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, remove the media containing the detached cells, then wash the flask with 4 ml of 37 °C HBSS. Add 4 ml of 37 °C complete DMEM and maintain cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2. NOTE: This step is important to enrich cultures for cortical astrocytes, as contaminating microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells detach with this procedure and are removed from the culture41.\nRepeat steps 1.3.1-1.3.11 for each animal.\nInduction of Genetic Recombination\n\t\n24 hr after completing step 1.3.11, replace the medium with 2 ml of 37 °C complete DMEM. Add 1 ml of 37 °C SCM containing 1 µl of >1010 pfu/ml of Ad5CMVCre or Ad5GFAPCre. Incubate for 6 hr at 32 °C in 5% CO2.CAUTION: Use BSL2 safety precautions when handling recombinant adenovirus.\nRemove the virus containing media and add 37 °C complete DMEM without virus to the cortical astrocytes. CAUTION: Use BSL2 safety precautions when handling recombinant adenoviruses and discard the virus-containing media per institutional regulations. NOTE: For 5 astrocyte cultures, steps 1.4.1 - 1.4.3 will take ~15 min excluding the 6 hr incubation.\nExpand cortical astrocyte cultures for in vitro and in vivo characterization. NOTE: Determine the presence of mutations following Cre-recombination by PCR with primers specific for the recombined gene or by immunoblots for either the specific mutated protein or its signaling consequences. The time required for phenotypic stabilization of cortical astrocyte cultures after Cre-recombination will be dependent on the mutations utilized and must be determined empirically (Figure 2).\n2.

NOTE: For 5 NSC cultures, steps 2.5.1-2.5.5 will take ~15 min excluding the 6 hr incubation.\nThe next day, repeat steps 2.5.1-2.5.5, followed by neurosphere passaging when necessary. The spheres can now be expanded for 2-3 passages before in vitro characterization and orthotopic injection in mouse brains in vivo. NOTE: Determine the presence of mutations following Cre-recombination by PCR with primers specific for the recombined gene or by immunoblots for either the specific mutated protein or its signaling consequences. The time required for phenotypic stabilization of NSC cultures after Cre-recombination will be dependent on the mutations utilized and must be determined empirically (Figures 2 and 3).\n3. Orthotopic Injection of Recombined Cells into the Brain of Recipient Iimmunocompetent Mice\nPreparation of 5% Methyl Cellulose",
    "Dissolve 5 g of 15 cPs methyl cellulose in deionized water to a final volume of 50 ml in a 100 ml screw cap bottle. Add the powder slowly while stirring at 4 °C to prevent clumping. It can take up to 24 hr of stirring at 4 °C for all the methyl cellulose to enter solution.\nWeigh the bottle and record the weight.\nAutoclave the 5% methyl cellulose solution. Once autoclaved, the methyl cellulose will become a semisolid gel.\nWeigh the bottle and calculate the weight lost during autoclaving.\nAseptically add 1 ml of sterile water for every gram of weight lost.\nPlace on ice and add 50 ml of ice cold 2x DMEM.\nMix overnight using a magnetic stirrer at 4 °C. Use sterile technique to divide the 5% methyl cellulose solution into 20 ml aliquots. Store aliquots at 4 °C for up to six months or until the 2x DMEM expires.

    "Transfer the desired number of cells to a new 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend cells in 800 µl of 37 °C complete DMEM. Determine the volume of the cell pellet (total volume of cell suspension – 800 µl). NOTE: It is essential to achieve an accurate cell concentration for injection. Thus, the volume of the cell pellet must be determined in this step in order to calculate the volume of 5% methyl cellulose to add in step 3.2.12.\nTransfer cells to a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and then centrifuge at 200 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate supernatant from the cell pellet and resuspend the cortical astrocytes in the appropriate volume of ice-cold 5% methyl cellulose (desired total volume – volume of the cell pellet) to obtain the desired number of cells/µl.\nPlace cells on ice until injection.\nPlace a 250 µl glass syringe into a Repeating Antigen Dispenser then place a blunt 18 G needle onto the syringe.\nWithdraw the plunger slowly with the needle in the cortical astrocyte suspension; there will be an air bubble above the cells that must be removed, since air bubbles will compress and diminish the volume actually injected into the brain.\nHold the tip of the needle just above the cortical astrocyte suspension and push the plunger in quickly. The air bubble will move faster than the cell suspension and will be mostly expelled.\nRepeat step 3.2.16 until all air bubbles are removed from the needle.\nFill the syringe to about ~200 µl, then hold the needle up and pull the plunger back until it stops. Little air bubbles can be removed by holding the needle tip up and rapidly pushing the plunger in about 50 µl then slowly withdrawing to full capacity.",
    "Keep the tip upright and repeat step 3.2.18 4-5x.\nDiscard the 18 gauge needle and fit a 27 G needle onto the syringe.\nPress the button on the antigen dispenser until fluid is expelled from the needle. NOTE: For 1 astrocyte cell line, steps 3.2.1-3.2.21 will take ~60 min.\nPreparation of NSC for Injection\n\t\nWhen neurospheres are > 100 µm in diameter, transfer to 15 ml tubes and let the neurospheres settle by gravity for >5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and dissociate the neurospheres with a gentle dissociation reagent, such as stem cell dissociation solution or accutase according to the manufacturer’s instructions or with %0.05 trypsin-EDTA as described42.\nInhibit the dissociation reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions without exposing the NSC to serum. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant, then resuspend the cells in 1 ml of 37 °C cHBSS to generate a single cell suspension.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or another appropriate cell counter to determine the number of cells/µl.\nTransfer the desired number of NSC to a new 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in 800 µl of 37 °C HBSS. Determine the volume of the cell pellet (total volume of cell suspension – 800 µl). NOTE: It is essential to achieve an accurate cell concentration for injection. Thus, the volume of the cell pellet must be determined in this step in order to calculate the volume of 5% methyl cellulose to add in step 3.3.9.\nTransfer the cells to a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and then centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and finish preparing the cells for orthotopic injection as in 3.2.12-3.2.21. NOTE: For 1 NSC cell line, steps 3.3.1-3.3.9 will take ~60 min.",
    "Preparation of Mouse for Injection\n\t\nAnesthetize the recipient animal via a I.P. injection of 250 mg/kg Avertin (2,2,2 Tribromoethanol) or 100 mg/kg ketamine plus 10 mg/kg xylazine, per institutional IACUC guidelines. NOTE: Utilized herein are mice at 3-6 months of age as allograft hosts. Mice at different ages may be utilized to investigate the microenvironmental impact of developmental brain age on tumorigenesis.\nShave the scalp over the incision site with clippers or scissors.\nSterilize the surgical site with 3 alternating swabs of 70% ethanol and betadine.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent any damage due to loss of blink reflex.\nAssess depth of anesthesia by pedal withdrawal (toe pinch) reflex. NOTE: For 5 mice, steps 3.4.1-3.4.5 will take ~15 min.\nOrthotopic Implantation\n\t\nSecure the animal in the stereotaxic frame.\nMake an incision over the sagittal suture approximately 0.5 cm long between the ears and eyes.\nLocate the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures (Bregma), as well as the intersection of the lambdoid and sagittal sutures (Lambda). Ensure that Bregma and Lambda are in the same horizontal plane.\nAttach the syringe containing the cell suspension and repeating antigen dispenser to the stereotaxic frame over the head. Bring the tip of the 27 G needle into contact with Bregma. This is the origin that will be used for the manipulation of three dimensional coordinates.\nRaise the needle slightly off the skull surface and move 2 mm lateral and 1 mm rostral from Bregma.\nLower the needle carefully through the skull to its destination 4 mm ventral from Bregma. NOTE: We utilized these stereotactic coordinates to target the basal ganglia. Different stereotactic coordinates may be utilized to investigate the microenvironmental impact of different brain regions on tumorigenesis.",
    "Inject 5 µl of the cell suspension by activating the repeating antigen dispenser one time. Leave the needle in place for 2 min to allow intracranial pressure to equilibrate.\nWithdraw the needle slowly over a period of 30 sec. Use a cotton swab to apply pressure to any bleeding that may occur.\nApproximate the wound edges and close the incision using tissue adhesive. Administer 20 µl of Lidocaine subcutaneously at the incision site. NOTE: For 5 mice, steps 3.5.1-3.5.9 will take ~50 min. The UNC IACUC approved the postoperative use of local anesthesia only. Consultation with local institutional IACUC is recommended regarding requirements for postoperative analgesic use after this procedure.\nPost-Surgical Care\n\t\nPlace the animals in a clean, warm cage to recover. Animals should not be placed directly into bedding, as accidental aspiration may occur.\nObserve the animals for resumption of normal behavior such as grooming, eating, and defecation. NOTE: Resumption of normal behavior can take ~60 min.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
