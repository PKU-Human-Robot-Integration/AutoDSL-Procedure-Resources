    "1) Cell Line Culture for Producing Lentivirus\nGrow fresh, low-passage (less than passage 30) 293T human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) base media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 1x non-essential amino acids (NEAA), Pen/Strep, 2-mercaptoenthanol in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Split the cells every 3 - 5 d and before they become > 95% confluent.\nPassage 293T HEK cells with 18 x 106 per 15-cm plate (one 15-cm plate for each virus produced).\n\t\nFor a 15-cm format, aspirate the old media, add 10 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), aspirate the PBS, and add 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin. Incubate the cells in trypsin for 8 min at 37 °C, rocking and tapping the cells halfway through the incubation.\n\t\t​NOTE: The goal of this step is to get the cells into a single-cell suspension.\nWhen the cells have reached 60% - 80% confluency the following day, perform a polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection with 13.5 µg of the psPAX2 plasmid, 4.5 µg of the pMD2.G plasmid, 18 µg of lentiviral-compatible delivery vector with the gene of interest (i.e., FKBP-Gal4), 108 µL of PEI, and 1.8 mL of transfection media.\n\t\nGently mix the DNA, PEI, and transfection media in a 15-mL conical tube, incubate the sample at room temperature for 15 min, and add it dropwise to the 15-cm plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Please use appropriate safety measures and follow all institutional and laboratory safety procedures after this step, as all reagents will contain a live virus.",
    "After 16 h of transfection and incubation in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2, aspirate the media and gently add fresh 293 HEK media (prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath) to the 15-cm plates. Incubate the cells in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 48 h after the media change. The virus is then ready to be harvested.\n2) Infection of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC) with Lentivirus\nGrow low-passage (less than passage 35), feeder-free adapted CiA mESCs in high-glucose DMEM base media supplemented with 20% ESC-grade FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1x NEAA, Pen/Strep, 2-mercaptoenthanol, and 1:500 leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n\t​NOTE: The LIF is obtained from the supernatant of COS LIF-producing cells, which are collected in batch and frozen at -80 °C.\n\t\nGrow cells on plates that have been preincubated for 1 - 3 h with 0.1% gelatin in 1x PBS, and subsequently washed with 1x PBS. Feed the cells daily and split them every 2 - 3 d, depending on their density.\n\t\t​NOTE: Morphologically, embryonic stem cell (ES) colonies should be small, round, and distinct from each other.\nPassage mESC into a 12-well plate format (100,000 cells/well) 1 d prior to infection.\n\t\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer. For cells grown in a 10-cm format, aspirate the old media, add 5 mL of 1x PBS, aspirate the PBS, and add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin. Incubate the cells in trypsin for 8 min at 37 °C, rocking and tapping the cells halfway through the incubation. The goal of this step is to get the cells into a single-cell suspension.\n48 h after changing the media from the 293T15-cm viral packaging cells from step 1.4, remove and transfer the supernatant to a 50-mL conical tube.",
    "Centrifuge the supernatant at 300 x g for 5 min to pellet cell debris.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.45-µm membrane.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to use surfactant-free cellulose acetate (SFCA) membranes, as some other materials can retain virus and significantly reduce yields.\nConcentrate the virus with ultracentrifugation, using a centrifuge with an SW32 rotor, and spin it at 20,000 rpm (~72,000 x g) for 2.5 h at 4 °C.\nWhile the virus concentrates under ultracentrifugation, treat the CiA mESCs in the 12-well plate with fresh ES media containing 5 µg/mL of polybrene.\nWhen the virus concentration has finished, carefully aspirate the supernatant and suspend the virus pellet in 100 µL of 1x PBS (avoid excess bubbles).\nAdd the virus and 1x PBS to a 1.5-mL microfuge tube. Vortex/shake the tube at 300 x g (or at the lowest setting) to fully suspend the virus. Spin down the tube in a mini-tabletop centrifuge for 5 - 10 s to remove bubbles.\nAdd 30 µL of the virus to each well of a 12-well plate. Swirl the plate and then centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 20 min.\n\t​NOTE: The amount of virus added can be varied depending on the viral titer, which is inversely related to delivery construct size.\n\t\nAlternatively, flash freeze the virus with liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C. However, freezing the virus will lower the viral titer.\nPlace the 12-well plate back in the 37 °C incubator and change the media the following morning (~16 h later) with fresh ES media (as described in step 2.1).",
    "After 48 h of infection, select for cells that integrated the viral plasmid by adding the appropriate antibiotic (i.e., 1.5 µg/mL of puromycin, 10 µg/mL of blasticidin, etc.). Change the media daily and wash the cells with 1x PBS if a majority of the cells are floating/dead. Keep the selection media on the cells for 72 - 96 h in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n3) Chemical Epigenetic Modifiers (CEM)s Preparation and Treatment\nSuspend the powdered CEM into dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration of 1 mM and a working concentration of 100 µM.\nAfter the cells have undergone the selection for 72 - 96 h, split the mESCs into a 12-well format with 100,000 cells/well. Incubate the cells in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Afterward, prepare a media solution of 100 nM CEM with ES media. Use this media to feed the CiA mESC with 1 mL/well. To serve as a control, keep a well of cells without any added CEMs.\n\t\nChange the media by aspirating old media and adding 1 mL/well of freshly prepared CEM-containing or CEM-free ES media every 24 h for the duration of an experiment.\n4) Analysis of the Expression by Microscopy and Flow Cytometry\nAfter 48 hours of CEM treatment, image the cells without CEM treatment and the cells treated with 100 nM CEM using a fluorescence microscope. Take representative images using phase or brightfield to record the mESC morphology at 20X magnification; the cells should have formed round colonies, with a few differentiated cells. Under the FITC fluorescence channel, image both cell conditions.",
    "Isolate the control and CEM-treated cells for flow cytometry by aspirating the media, washing the cells with 1 mL of 1x PBS, aspirating the PBS, and adding 0.25 mL of 0.25% trypsin with EDTA for 8 - 10 min.\nConfirm that the cells are no longer in large clumps by looking in the microscope. Use a 20X magnification. If the cells do not appear to be in a single-cell suspension, gently pipette up and down with a P1000 pipette to fully trypsinize the cells.\nQuench the trypsin with 1 mL of fresh media and resuspend the cells at high speed with a serological pipette (or using a P1000 pipette and tip) until the cells are in a single-cell suspension.\nSpin down the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant. Wash with 1x PBS and recentrifuge the cells. Aspirate the PBS supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 mL of FACS buffer (1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1x PBS, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin [BSA]).\n\t\nThe total volume of FACS buffer will be dependent on how many cells are present, but the concentration should be 1,000 - 3,000 cells/µL. Count the number of cells in 3 samples and average the concentration of cells. Add more FACS buffer if needed.\nPerform flow cytometry on > 50,000 cells with the suspended cells, keeping the cells on ice when they are not being analyzed. Use a 530/40 filter (FITC, AF488, GFP, etc.) for recording the changes in expression. Determine the appropriate fluorescent voltage using an untreated control cell sample and set the voltage to have the fluorescent peak be in the middle of the recorded intensity spectrum. Run the samples at a sheath speed of around 5,000 cells/s.",
    "Export the data and analyze the FCS files on a flow cytometry program (i.e., FlowJo) by gating first on forward scatter vs. side scatter for live cells and then on forward scatter height vs. area for singlets. Then, visualize GFP channel data on a histogram to determine the relative GFP expression in the targeted and control populations.\n5) Analysis of Chromatin by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Followed by qPCR\nSplit the mESCs into a 10-cm plate with 3 million cells and 10 mL of ES media (one 10-cm plate for each experimental or control condition). The following day, add 10 mL of CEM-containing or CEM-free media. After 48 hours of CEM treatment, aspirate the old media. Wash and aspirate the cells with 5 mL of 1x PBS. Next, dissociate the cells with 0.25% trypsin, and quench the trypsin with 10 mL of ES media. Count and isolate a sample of 10 million cells per condition.\nSpin down each of the 10 million cell samples at 300 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend each pellet in 10 mL of 1x PBS and recentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend each pellet in 10 mL of CiA Fix buffer (50 mM pH 8, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5 mM ethylene glycol-bis[ß-aminoethyl ether]-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid [EGTA] pH 8, and 100 mM sodium chloride [NaCl]). Add 1 mL of 11% formaldehyde solution and immediately invert the samples 5x - 10x. Incubate the sample at room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 2.5 M glycine. Invert the samples immediately and incubate the sample on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of CiA Rinse 1 (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 [NP40], and 0.25% Triton X100). Incubate the sample on ice for 10 min. Centrifuge it at 1,200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of CiA Rinse 2 (10 mM tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane [Tris] pH 8, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 8, and 200 mM NaCl). Centrifuge the sample at 1,200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nGently add 5 mL of CiA shearing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris pH 8) along the sides of the conical tube to wash off any salt without disrupting the pellet. Centrifuge the sample at 1,200 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Repeat the wash step.\nResuspend the pellet in 90 µL of CiA shearing buffer and fresh protease inhibitors (use a mixture of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A dissolved together at 10mg/mL each in DMSO to make a 1,000x stock solution, making a final concentration of 10 µg/mL). Add 10 µL of sonication-enhancing nanodroplets while keeping everything on ice13,14.\nTransfer 100 µL of the solution to a glass tube and cap the tube.\nSonicate the samples for 3.5 min (determined based on the cell line and number of cells). To avoid overheating the samples, process the samples in 2-min-maximum cycle times if the total sonication time exceeds 2 min.\n\tNote: The focused ultrasonicator used here functions at a high frequency (500 kHz). Run the machine at an acoustic power of 55 W. The sonication duration should be predetermined by each individual lab.",
    "Transfer each sonicated chromatin sample to a new 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. Spin the tubes at 8,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.\nTo analyze the shearing efficiency and to quantify the relative amount of chromatin, follow the ChIP kit manufacturer's protocol.\n\tNOTE: Determine the DNA concentration spectrophotometrically (e.g., using a DNA nanodrop instrument), and run ~200 ng of DNA on a 1% agarose gel to verify that the chromatin is sonicated to roughly 200 - 500 basepairs (bp) in size.\nTo perform immunoprecipitation and isolate the chromatin, follow the ChIP kit manufacturer's protocol.\n\t​NOTE: For the immunoprecipitation of samples with higher DNA concentrations, warm the elution buffer at 37 °C and elute the samples 2x with 30 µL of elution buffer (spinning for 1 min each time).\nTo perform qPCR, load the reagents into a 384-well plate. Add 5 µL of 2x asymmetrical cyanine dye master mix, 2.5 µM of each primer, water, and 0.1 - 10 ng of DNA for each reaction.\n\t\nDesign primers to amplify 50 - 100 bp amplicons, and CT values are normalized to a house-keeping gene, intracisternal A-type particles (IAP).\n\t\tNOTE: For further qPCR methods, see the kit manufacturer's protocol. The primer set used to target the Oct4 locus was: (F) CACATGAAGCAGCACGACTT; (R) CCTTGAAGAAGATGGTGCGC. The control primer set used to target IAP was: (F) ATTTCGCCTAGGACGTGTCA; (R) ACTCCATGTGCTCTGCCTTC.\nBased on the primers and the desired product, run the qPCR with 40 cycles of an annealing temperature of 60 °C for 1 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting data was quantitated using the delta-delta Ct comparisons between samples, with CiA:Oct4 normalized over IAP. The final analysis results are displayed as averages of triplicate experimental samples, with the error represented as the standard deviation from the mean.\nSubscription Required.
