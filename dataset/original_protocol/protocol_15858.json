    "In this first protocol, we will introduce the fundamental aspects of the NDEx web user interface (hereafter, NDEx UI) and prepare the ground for the “real world” use cases presented in Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0002], 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0003], and 4. You will learn to use the NDEx UI to search for networks, become familiar with the NDEx Network Viewer (NNV), and create your own NDEx account. NDEx accounts are free to use and provide you with 10 gigabytes of cloud storage space for your networks. It is not necessary to install the Cytoscape desktop application for this protocol, but it is required in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0002], so we recommend that you install the software now to avoid interruptions in the workflow. Here is a breakdown of the topics covered in this protocol:\n         \nOverview of the NDEx landing page\nNetwork search feature\nThe NDEx Network Viewer (NNV)\nQuerying a network to extract subnetworks of interest\nConvenience features: Open in Cytoscape\nCreating and managing an NDEx account\nSaving a network to your NDEx account.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nA computer with stable internet connection\nSoftware\nWeb browser (recommended: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)\nWhile we don't discourage the use of alternative web browsers, we cannot guarantee that all features will be available and functioning as intended.

Please make sure to always update your browser to the latest available version.\nCytoscape desktop application (optional but recommended)\nPlease visit https://cytoscape.org[href=https://cytoscape.org] to download and install the Cytoscape desktop application compatible with your operating system.\nOther",
    "Please add [email protected][href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f0838580809f8284b09e94958892999fde9f8297] to your e-mail contacts before proceeding. This is particularly important if you use a Gmail address, and necessary to ensure that you receive e-mails from the NDEx server to validate your account or reset your password (if necessary).\n1. Overview of The NDEx landing page.\nTo begin, launch a browser window and navigate to https://www.ndexbio.org[href=https://www.ndexbio.org] to load the NDEx landing page (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]).\nIn the left corner of the top bar, the NDEx logo shows the current software version (2.5.1). Next, several menu items provide access to documentation, bug report/contact forms, and the FAQ page (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]). Finally, in the top right corner, you can find the Login/Register button (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]), which you will use later in this protocol to create your account.\nYou can click the underlined version number to access the Release Notes for details about new features, improvements, and bug fixes.\nBelow the logo, a cluster of three buttons (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]) allows you to browse the latest network, explore the collection of NDEx featured networks, and visualize search examples. Click the Featured Networks button to open a dropdown menu with a variety of high-quality network models of different types and from different sources.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6d9e701a-d155-4f0d-8cbb-10effc737b56/cpz1258-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nNDEx landing page. (A) Top menu; (B) Login/register button; (C) Featured networks; (D) Network search feature.\n2. Network search feature.\nYou can run a custom network search using the textbox (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]). The most popular ways to search for networks are by keyword or gene name.",
    "When searching for genes, you can decide to activate Search Term Expansion by marking the available checkbox: this feature will expand your search terms to include all possible aliases, thus returning networks that contain your genes of interest even if they have unofficial names. This feature only works for human genes. Mouse over the small blue icon to display a tooltip with additional information.\nKeyword search: Type leukemia in the textbox and click the magnifier (or press Enter) to run the search: the results will be displayed as a table of networks that include leukemia in the network's name or description, or in a node name (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0002]).\nThe number of search results is displayed at the bottom left corner of the table (red oval).\nFor each network, you can see several property columns (such as number of edges, owner or date last modified).\nMouse over the network name to display a tooltip with a detailed network description (if applicable): try this with the first network in the results page, Acute Myeloid Leukemia.\nClick the browser's Back button to go back to the NDEx landing page.\nGene search: Now type FLT3 in the textbox and run the search: the results page will contain all networks that include FLT3 in that network's name or description, or in one of its node's name or alias properties. Please make note of the number of Total Items in your search results.\nGo back to the landing page and repeat the same search, but this time mark the checkbox to perform Search Term Expansion (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]): if you compare the Total Items in the expanded search results with what you noted earlier, you'll notice that you now find a few additional networks that refer to FLT3 by one of its aliases.",
    "When searching for genes, using Search Term Expansion will expand your search terms to include all possible aliases, thus returning results (networks) that contain your gene(s) of interest even if they carry unofficial names. This feature only works for human genes. Mouse over the small blue info icon to display a tooltip with more information.\nFor additional types of searches, please select the Search Examples button to view examples and access the advanced search documentation. The NDEx Search Feature is case-insensitive.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71a70c2e-5d7e-4c26-bc97-d4001ab89196/cpz1258-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSearch results table. The total number of results is displayed in the bottom left corner of the table as indicated by the red oval.\n3. The NDEx Network Viewer (NNV).\nClick the network called Acute Myeloid Leukemia to open the network view page. The network view page is shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003] and consists of Main Canvas, Info Panel, Query Feature, Action Buttons, and Menu Buttons.\nMain Canvas: This area occupies about two thirds of the screen and is where the network model is drawn and visualized (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]). Use the navigation buttons to zoom in/out and re-center the graphic view.\nClick a graphic element (node or edge) to open a pop-up window and inspect the data.\nHold the Ctrl key on your keyboard and use your mouse or touchpad to perform a multiple selection (nodes and edges): with a multiple selection, you can inspect the data associated to nodes and edges by clicking the relative tabs in the info panel (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]).",
    "For small networks like the pathway we are looking at, graphic rendering is achieved using cytoscape.js. For large networks, NDEx uses a new, high-performance rendering engine called the Large Graph Renderer (LGR). It achieves the performance required for the display of millions of elements by using a different underlying technology and supporting only a limited subset of Cytoscape visual styling.\nInfo panel: This is located on the right-hand side, next to the Main Canvas, and occupies about one third of the screen (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]). By default, the Info Panel shows the Network tab that provides information about the displayed network, including its description, reference publication, licensing information, and other properties.\nThe Info Panel has two additional tabs, Nodes and Edges, that become available only when you perform a multiple selection in the Main Canvas.\nQuery feature: It is located at the bottom left of the network view page (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]). The Query Feature lets you search the displayed network for a subnetwork (or neighborhood) of interest.\nType TP53 in the query textbox and click the magnifier (or press Enter) to run the query. The screen will split and display the original network and the retrieved subnetwork.\nClick the X in the Query Feature to close the result and restore the original network page\nYou can choose among 7 different types of query by using the dropdown selector. The default query type is “1-Step Neighborhood”; click the info button next to the query type selector to reveal embedded documentation explaining the different types of query.",
    "Action buttons: These buttons are located at the bottom right corner of the network view page and let you perform several actions on the displayed network (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]), e.g., edit network properties, share the network with others, or request a DOI. However, the most convenient action is the possibility to open your network in the Cytoscape desktop application with just one click.\nIf the requirements to use this feature are satisfied, the Open in Cytoscape button will be enabled (colored orange); otherwise, it will be disabled (colored gray). Mouse over the button to display a tooltip with info.\nMinimum requirements: you must have Cytoscape 3.6.0 or higher running on your computer (default port: 1234) and the CyNDEx-2 app installed.\nRecommended requirements: always use the latest Cytoscape version available (currently 3.8.2), as it comes with the CyNDEx-2 app pre-installed. If the CyNDEx-2 App needs to be updated, Cytoscape will notify you upon startup.\nMenu buttons: These buttons are located at the top left corner of the screen (Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]) and perform the same functions as the items in the top menu bar of the NDEx landing page: clicking the logo will bring you back to the landing page. The user avatar allows you to login/register an account while the three vertical dots provide access to the top menu items (contact form, FAQ, etc.).\nFinally, the largest button, “SWITCH TO CLASSIC MODE” lets you view the network using our legacy network viewer where you can access a few features that haven't been ported over to NNV yet, such as the ability to clone a network and automatically save the copy to your account.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a080bb43-871f-4617-8411-f24bd22c59ce/cpz1258-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nNDEx Network Viewer (NNV) page. (A) Main canvas; (B) Info panel; (C) Query feature; (D) Action buttons; (E) Menu buttons.\n4. Create an account.",
    "Now that you are familiar with the NDEx landing and NNV pages, let's guide you through the process of creating your own NDEx account.\nYou can do this by clicking the Login/Register button (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0001]) in the landing page or by clicking the User Avatar button (Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]) on any NNV page.\nIn the pop-up window, choose whether you want to Sign in/Sign Up with Google (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0004]) or if you prefer to proceed manually (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0004]).\nIf you have a Google account, we highly recommend that you Sign In/Sign Up with Google, as it makes the process simpler and faster. With this option, you will create your account with two clicks, and don't need to verify your e-mail address to activate the account.\nThe NDEx server will still send you a confirmation e-mail that contains a system-generated password: you will need this password to access your account programmatically later in Basic Protocol 4, so please make sure you keep it handy. You can also change the system-generated password to your favorite one from your account settings; we'll show you how to do this shortly.\nIf you don't have a Google account or prefer to create your NDEx account manually, click the link as shown in Figure 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0004], fill out the registration form, accept the Terms & Conditions, and click the Sign Up button.\nNext, check your e-mail and verify your e-mail address by clicking the activation link you received.\nYou can now go back to the NDEx landing page or NNV page and sign in to your new NDEx account with the username and password you have chosen.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1226d885-9600-454a-9c9a-e704fcf44391/cpz1258-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nLogin/register window. Users can choose to create an account either using Google as identity provider (A), or manually (B).\n5. Manage your account.",
    "Once logged in, your account page will look like Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0005]. On the left-hand side, expand the Account Settings button, then choose Change Password: in the pop-up window, you can change the password to access your account.\nIf you have created your account using Google in the previous step, you may want to change the system generated password with something you'll remember more easily.\nNow expand the Account Settings button again, then choose Edit Settings: in the pop-up window, you can adjust several settings including changing the e-mail address associated to your account, add a personal image or opt-out of monthly usage statistics e-mails for your networks (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0006]).\nTo add a personal image, you must provide the URL where the image can be fetched from. You cannot upload an image from file.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/188ca040-b5d1-453f-887a-f9880f682d01/cpz1258-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nNDEx account page.

The interface lets users modify and personalize their account page; for example, they can change the e-mail address associated to the account, set a custom image, or opt out of monthly usage statistics e-mails.\n6. Add your first network.\nNow that you have an account and 10 gigabytes of free cloud storage for your networks, let's add a network to your account.\nFrom your account's page, click the magnifier in the top right corner (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0005]) to open the Search modal window, which has the same features as the Search interface on the landing page.\nType leukemia in the textbox and run the search.\nIn the results page, click the Acute Myeloid Leukemia to display the network.\nNow type MDM2 TP53 in the query textbox (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0003]) and press Enter.",
    "When the query result is displayed in split screen, you will notice that a blue floppy disk icon is now available in the query control bar: click it to save the query result to your account, then navigate back to your account page using the User Avatar in the top left of the page.\nNow you should see your account page populated with one network, the query result that you just saved.\nYour network's visibility is PRIVATE, which means your network is only visible to you.\nNow click the network's name to open its page and display it.\nIn the bottom right corner where the Action Buttons are located, you can click the “pencil” button and access the network property editor (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0007]), where you can modify a variety of network properties, including the network's visibility.\nMake the network PUBLIC using the visibility dropdown, then click the green button to save your changes.\nThe network property editor screen also shows the NDEx Score for the network: the NDEx Score is calculated based on the amount of annotation a network has. The more information associated to a network, the higher its score. The score is considered by the NDEx server to rank search results; this way, networks that are well annotated will be ranked higher while those poorly annotated will be ranked lower. We strongly recommend that you annotate your networks thoroughly before making them publicly available, so that they will be more easily found in searches and be more informative to your audience.\nNow that you are familiar with the NDEx UI, let's move on to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0002] go through a typical workflow to prepare your networks for submission, peer-review and publication in a scientific journal.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a958576-6609-4036-a1da-a69f98ae139c/cpz1258-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",
    "Network property editor page. The interface lets users add/modify metadata to annotate their networks; for example, users can control a network's visibility or version, specify a published reference, and select a license. The NDEx score at the top of the page is a measure of the degree of annotation of the network and is used to rank the network in search results: the more the properties are annotated, the higher the score, the better the rank in search results.",
    "As seen in the previous protocol, an NDEx account unlocks several features not available to anonymous users such as the ability to save networks, manage their visibility, or open them in Cytoscape for subsequent analysis, visual styling, and layout. In this second protocol, we will describe the NDEx features that support collaboration, peer-reviewed publication, and distribution of network models. You will learn how to connect Cytoscape with NDEx and export (save) a network to your NDEx account, share it with collaborators, and finally request a DOI to make your network accessible as a stable reference resource. Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0002] uses one of the sample networks available in Cytoscape; however, we encourage you to follow the protocol using your own research network model if possible. If you are not familiar with the Cytoscape Desktop application, please refer to the manual at https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/[href=https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/]. Here is a breakdown of the topics covered in this protocol:\n         \nLaunch Cytoscape.\nOpen the sample network\nUse the Cytoscape NDEx interface to sign into your account from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0001].\nExport the network to your NDEx account.\nGo to the NDEx website and select the new network.\nAnnotate the network.\nEnable the network's “Share URL”\nRequest a DOI.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nA computer with a stable internet connection\nSoftware\nWeb browser (recommended: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)\nWhile we don't discourage the use of alternative web browsers, we cannot guarantee that all features will be available and functioning as intended.

A final pop-up window will be displayed: please review all information, then click the blue button to submit your DOI request. After the request is submitted, you'll be sent back to the network's NNV page: at the top of the info panel, below the network's name, you'll see a badge that says DOI Status: Pending. If necessary, you can delete the DOI request by clicking the gray trashcan icon next to the badge.",
    "Once the DOI is minted and assigned, you will be notified by e-mail. At that time, the badge will change and display the actual DOI. After the DOI is assigned, you will not be able to delete the request or operate on the network anymore.",
    "Programmatic access and interactive display via Python, R, and JavaScript enable a broad range of applications in network analysis and visualization. The ndex2 Python client library provides a convenient wrapper around the NDEx server API: NDEx networks are transferred using the CX (Cytoscape Exchange) format and ndex2 includes the NiceCX Python object to simplify the use of CX data. As NiceCX does not provide common network manipulation functionality, for this purpose data is cast into other data models such as NetworkX or iGraph. This protocol consists of a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the ndex2 Python client and NiceCX class to perform the following operations:\n         \nLoad a network starting from an existing network in NDEx and display it in the notebook\nCopy and apply a style from an existing template in NDEx\nApply a layout using NetworkX\nSave a network to your account in NDEx.\nThe Sphinx documentation for the ndex2 client is available at https://ndex2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[href=https://ndex2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/].\nThe CyJupyter documentation is available at https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-jupyter-widget[href=https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-jupyter-widget].\nAdditional Jupyter Notebook examples are available at https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks[href=https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks].\nExamples for JavaScript and R can be found in the tutorial “Automation in the Cytoscape Ecosystem” available at https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-ismb-2020/blob/master/README.md[href=https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-ismb-2020/blob/master/README.md].\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nA computer with stable internet connection\nSoftware\nPython 3.6 or higher\nndex2 Python Client\nThe ndex2 Python client module can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository using PIP: pip install ndex2\nIf you already have an older version of the ndex2 client installed, you can use this command instead: pip install --upgrade ndex2\nCyJupyter Widget\nThe CyJupyter module can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository using PIP: pip install cyjupyter\nOnce installed, you must enable it: jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix cyjupyter\nJupyter Notebook installed\nWeb browser (recommended: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)\nFiles",
    "Jupyter Notebook file “Working with NDEx Networks in Python”\nThis notebook is provided as a single file in Supplementary File 1. Alternatively, you can obtain it together with several other Python tutorials by cloning this repository: https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks[href=https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks].\n1. Load network from NDEx.\nIn this first step, you will import a public network from NDEx into the python environment. Every network in NDEx is assigned a Universal Unique ID (UUID) that can be used to reliably reference a specific network. You will load the network called \"Sonic hedgehog\" available at http://ndexbio.org/viewer/networks/cfd3528f-a7a4-11eb-9e72-0ac135e8bacf[href=http://ndexbio.org/viewer/networks/cfd3528f-a7a4-11eb-9e72-0ac135e8bacf]. Please click the link to look at the network before we move forward with the next steps.\nThe first block of code (Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0013]) shows how you can make a request to the specified NDEx server using the UUID of the network using the ndex2.create_nice_cx_from_server() call. The server returns the network in CX format which is used to create a NiceCX object.\nThe second block of code lets you print out a summary of the network.\nThe third block of code allows you to display the network within the notebook using the CyJupyter widget, while the fourth block generates a clickable link that you can use to view the page of the network you just imported from NDEx (for convenience, this same link is provided earlier in this paragraph).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9caea819-a69e-42ac-bff9-4a1eb642ced7/cpz1258-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nLoad network from NDEx. The code displayed loads a network from NDEx, prints a summary, and lets you display it in the notebook.\n2. Copy and apply visual style.",
    "One of the easiest ways to apply a visual style to a network is to copy that style from another network. This allows you to work on the style of your network in Cytoscape using the interactive style editor, then save the network to NDEx for future use as a template. The NiceCX class provides a special method for this common operation, both downloading the template and copying the style to the target network. You specify the network to use as template by defining its UUID, and the apply_template() method copies the visual style and applies it to the 'Sonic Hedgehog' network you imported from NDEx in the previous step (Fig. 14[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0014]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8a07c9d0-bb26-47f2-98f9-13834bbb6ec2/cpz1258-fig-0014-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 14\nApply a visual style. This code lets you copy the visual style from an existing template stored in NDEx and apply it to your network.\n3. Save (upload) network to NDEx.\nNiceCX networks have a convenient one-step upload method. Saving a network to your account requires you to provide your NDEx 'username' and 'password'. You will now save the 'Sonic Hedgehog' network with its colorful visual style to the NDEx account you created earlier on, in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0001].\nYou use the first three blocks of code (Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0015]) to set the credentials required to access your NDEx account.\nYou will need the credentials (account name and password) of the NDEx account you created during Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-prot-0001]. Please have the credentials handy before moving forward with this protocol. Also, please be beware of typos and make sure you hit the ENTER key in each field to set the input value!",
    "The fourth block of code assigns a new name to your network and saves it to your account using the upload_to() method. The function returns the URL of the network's RAW JSON, which you can use to generate a clickable URL to visualize your new network.\nYour new network is saved to your NDEx account as a ‘private’ network, so when you click the link to visualize it, you will be asked to login unless you already have a browser window opened and you are logged in to your NDEx account.\nUsing the CyJupyter widget, you can also display your new 'Sonic Hedgehog colorful (ndex2)' networks and compare the visual style differences with the original 'Sonic Hedgehog' network imported at the beginning of this notebook.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ea217b80-f7d6-4af7-a74a-edeabe40ff7c/cpz1258-fig-0015-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 15\nSave network to NDEx. This code prompts users for their NDEx account credentials and saves their network. It also returns a clickable link to view the network in a browser page and displays it in the notebook via the cyJupyter widget.\n4. Apply a layout.\nThe ndex2 client and NiceCX class do not provide network manipulation functionalities; for such operations, the data must first be cast into a different data model, in this case a NetworkX object (Fig. 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0016]).\nIn the first block of code, you start from our NiceCX network and generate a NetworkX object using the NiceCX to_networkx() method; then, you use the NetworkX spiral_layout() method to assign positions to the nodes. The result of the layout operation is a Python dictionary of positions keyed by node IDs that you assign to the variable ‘pos’. You can display the network with the new layout using the NetworkX draw method, passing in the NetworkX object and dictionary of positions.",
    "To apply the new layout to our NiceCX network, you need to transform the NetworkX positions into a CX cartesianLayout aspect. This is achieved in the second block of code by iterating through the dictionary of positions to create a list of Cartesian coordinates that you then apply to the NiceCX network via the set_opaque_aspect() method.\nThe minus sign in front of the ‘y’ coordinates in line 7 (Fig. 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0016]) is required to ensure that the layout of your NiceCX network will be identical to what you previewed when drawing the NetworkX network in the previous block of code. The reason for this is that NetworkX uses one convention for the zero position of Cartesian coordinates (zero at bottom left) while Cytoscape/cytoscape.js/CX use another (zero at top right). So, omitting the minus sign in line 7 would result in a NiceCX network with a vertically flipped layout (Fig. 17[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0017]). You can experiment yourself by removing the minus sign and saving a new copy of the network, then compare it with the previous one.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9b640caf-62e6-4e54-bfe5-979ecef38df8/cpz1258-fig-0016-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 16\nApply a layout. This code casts the network into a networkx object, applies a spiral layout, and then transfers the new node coordinates back to the original network by setting the CX cartesianLayout aspect.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/82810472-75b1-47fa-8844-baa868fb9370/cpz1258-fig-0017-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 17\nCartesian Coordinates. NetworkX and Cytoscape/cytoscape.js use different conventions for the zero position of Cartesian coordinates. NetworkX assumes the zero position is at the bottom left while Cytoscape/cytoscape.js set the zero to the top left. As a result, a minus sign is necessary in the code in line 7 in Figure 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0016] to ensure that the orientation of the CX network is not flipped vertically as compared to the NetworkX network.\n5. Save (update) network to NDEx.",
    "NiceCX networks also have an update_to() method to update an existing network instead of creating a new one. You will now update the 'Sonic Hedgehog colorful (ndex2)' network you saved in step 3 above with its updated version boasting the new spiral layout (Fig. 18[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.258#cpz1258-fig-0018]) and display it in the notebook.\nThe target network to be updated is specified by its UUID, and this MUST be the first argument passed to the update_to() method.\nYou can now verify that the 'Sonic Hedgehog colorful (ndex2)' network in your account has been replaced (updated) by the latest version that contains the spiral layout we added using NetworkX.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1d5d1a20-6af2-4f12-8634-0872ec10ec5b/cpz1258-fig-0018-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 18\nUpdate network in NDEx. This code shows how to update a network in NDEx by overwriting it with a new network. The UUID of the target network to update is the first argument that must be passed to the update method."
