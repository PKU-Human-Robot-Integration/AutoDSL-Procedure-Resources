    "Preparation of the target protein structure for virtual screeningThe hepsin protein structure (PDB id 1O5E, from protein structure database, www.rcsb.org[href=http://www.rcsb.org], see ‘Online tools’) can be automatically downloaded with Protein Preparation Wizard of Schrödinger suite using ‘biological unit’-option. With other types of softwares one should use the manual downloading and read in the structure by software preferred method. The pre-processing is carried out with default methods except keeping all the water molecules. H-bond refinement should be carried out with default pH value 7. All water molecules with at least 3 H-bonds with non-water atoms are saved and the whole structure is minimized with default settings with heavy atoms converged at RMSD 0.3Å. The Glide Grid file is created using the above mentioned structure and the center of the Grid was at Tyr94 (Figure 2). The center of the GRID is referring to the center of molecular field calculation during the GRID creation. Hydroxyl groups of Tyr94, Tyr146, Ser195 and Tyr228 are allowed to rotate for Grid generation. Addition of free rotatable bonds doubles the Glide calculation time and should be limited to keep the computational time at reasonable level. Also, it is strongly recommended that the Glide Grid file will be constructed so that OPLS3 force field is used, if possible. If another software is used, one should use the corresponding protein preparation method. The critical point is to make sure that the structural quality of the protein is checked, proper ionization status are fixed for polar sidechains and right rotamers for (pseudo)symetric residues are used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414204032_4223.jpgFigure 2. Definition of GRID region for docking. The center of the GRID is based on the location of residues TYR94, TYR146 and SER195 (residues marked with labels) and the GRIF region is shown with magenta box.",
    "Preparation of the virtual screening compound libraryThe virtual screening docking library must be prepared using the methods and settings recommended by the authors of the virtual screening software. When choosing the virtual compound library, one should take into account the number of compounds intended for screening, possibilities for own synthesis and if the resulting hits are intended to be used as such or further modified in subsequent medicinal chemistry programs. We use the drug-like subset of ZINC library, downloaded as a SDF-file from the ZINC web page. SDF-file format is supported by all the major software brands. The SDF-file is prepared by Schrödinger LigPrep module with default settings (Figure 3). In short the preparation includes checking of 2D structure quality, fast 2D-3D transformation, analysis and modification of protonation state, modification of all reachable tautomers and further minimization of resulting molecules. In a typical case each molecule will be represented with 2-4 different ionization/protomer/tautomer states. For other types of software other than the Schrödinger software, we recommend ligand setup via LigPrep. In our own experience, the benefit of this method is that it yields high quality predictions for both ionization status (i.e., pKa) and also for tautomers. The prediction of tautomers option is not included in most of the other software packages.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414204625_3794.jpgFigure 3. LigPrep window under Schrödinger Suite. The library for virtual screening is prepared according to the settings selected; the shown setting are the default ones in our protocol.Virtual screening and analysis of the resultsIn our study (Tervonen et al., 2016) virtual screening was carried out as follows:SP-docking is performed using the above-defined Grid file and the best 10% of compounds are further redocked with XP settings.",
    "In the first stage VHTS-settings were used and then SP settings were utilized only for the best 50,000-100,000 compounds (ranked according to the Glide-scoring function) and further, for the best 10%, XP-settings. In the original study OPLS2005 force field was used. However, we now strongly recommend OPLS3 force field, since it gives much better results compared to the original method.Clustering compounds was initially performed by visually studying the resulting docking poses. The aim of the visual inspection was to make sure that only reasonable docking poses are accepted. Typically some 10-20% of docking poses are unrealistic due to missing H-bonding contacts or unrealistic ligand conformations and these can be effectively screened by visual inspection.Compounds were then clustered by using the Interaction Fingerprint script available within Schrödinger. This script analyzed each of the docking pose based on the interaction profile (interaction fingerprints) and the poses are clustered by using those profiles. In our study we used the optimal number of clusters as evaluated by the script with default linkage method. For a detailed description of the method and its uses, see Deng et al. (2004) and Singh et al. (2006).As a result 24 clusters were created. In each cluster the most representative compounds are located in the center of the cluster. Those compounds are selected for in vitro assays. Validation of screen results by in vitro cell-free peptide cleavage assay for hepsin enzymatic activity protocolsRecombinant human hepsin (rhHepsin) is diluted to 100 µg/ml in activation buffer.rhHepsin is activated by incubating the solution at 37 °C for 24 h.rhHepsin is diluted into 0.1 nM solution with assay buffer just before use.Small-molecule compounds are dissolved in DMSO to give 10 mM stock solution.The assay is performed in assay buffer in a 96-well plate.0.",
    "1 nM final concentration of rhHepsin and 10 µM final concentration of small-molecule compound (and equal volume of DMSO control) in 100 µl reaction volume are incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Assay buffer is used as blank control.The reaction is started by adding a final concentration of 30 µM peptide substrate BOC-Gln-Arg-Arg-AMC.The plate is analyzed with ELISA plate reader by 350 nm excitation and 450 nm emission capture at room temperature.The inhibition % is determined by using the following formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171025/20171025231735_4788.jpg"
