    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCoating of coverslips\nTiming: 3–4 h (usually done simultaneously with cell isolation)\nThis step will enhance chromaffin cells adhesion to coverslips.\nDilute stock fibronectin solution (1 mg/mL) in water to obtain a fibronectin solution at 10 μg/mL.\nPlace cleaned and sterilized 12-mm coverslips in 4-well plates using sterile forceps.\nAdd 500 μL of 10 μg/mL fibronectin to each well containing a coverslip.\nNote: Carefully spread the fibronectin solution to evenly cover the surface of the coverslips.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for at least 3 h.\nNote: Coverslips incubation in coating solution should be completed by the end of chromaffin cell isolation.\nRemove fibronectin from the wells just before adding medium.\nPreparation of cells\nTiming: 4–6 h (depending on the number of adrenal glands)\nThis step will provide primary chromaffin cells after isolation from bovine adrenal glands.\nIsolate chromaffin cells from fresh bovine adrenal glands according to the protocol previously described (Thahouly et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nSuspend the needed amount of freshly isolated chromaffin cells into 10 mL of DMEM-D medium in a 50 mL Falcon® tube.\nNote: We use 7.5 × 106 cells for one electroporation condition, but it is possible to reduce this amount to 5 × 106 cells if needed.\nMaintain cells at 37°C until use (typically within 1 h).\nCritical: Electroporation should be performed as soon as possible after cell isolation to optimize cell viability and transfection efficiency.\nTransfection of bovine chromaffin cells\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis step will allow transient cell expression of the PA probe.\nAdd 400 μL of DMEM-D medium to each well of 4-well plates containing a fibronectin-coated coverslip and place the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nEquilibrate the transfection buffer (Nucleofector Solution for Primary Mammalian Neurons containing Supplement 1) at room temperature.",
    "Critical: Supplemented Nucleofector Solution can be used within 3 months and stored at 2°C–8°C to optimize cell viability and transfection efficiency.\nThaw an aliquot of Spo20p-GFP plasmid at room temperature and prepare 2 μg of plasmid into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: To optimize transfection efficiency, plasmids must be prepared with an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit. The concentration of plasmid preparation can be determined by optical density measurement using a Nanodrop spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Aliquot before storage at −20°C to avoid repeated freezing and thawing.\nNote: As a control to further estimate potential background labeling induced by GFP binding on plasma membrane, another sample of 7.5 × 106 cells should be electroporated with a GFP expression plasmid.\nCentrifuge the previously prepared cell aliquots at 100 g, 5 min at room temperature.\nEntirely discard the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the pellet with 100 μL of transfection buffer for 7.5 × 106 cells (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nCritical: Resuspension must be done as gently as possible with a 1000 μL micropipette to preserve cell viability. Otherwise, the suspension may turn viscous, indicating DNA release.\nCritical: From this step, electroporation and plating should be done in less than 15 min to preserve cell viability.\nAdd 100 μL of suspended cells to each 1.5 mL tube containing plasmid and gently mix.\nNote: One electroporation sample contains 7.5 × 106 cells, 1–3 μg plasmid DNA (2 μg for Spo20p-GFP) and 100 μL transfection buffer.\nTransfer the mixture into an electroporation cuvette with a single-use pipette.\nCritical: Mixing and transfer must be done as gently as possible to prevent formation of air bubbles that can reduce electroporation efficiency. If needed, try to get rid of air bubbles by gently tapping the cuvette on a hard surface (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).",
    "Insert the cuvette into the Nucleofector device and electroporate cells using the Amaxa nucleofector program X-001.\nImmediately after electroporation add 500 μL of DMEM-D medium to each cuvette.\nGently resuspend cells and collect suspension with a single-use pipette.\nNote: Pre-warm the DMEM-D medium to 37°C before use.\nPlate cells by adding 4–6 drops (each drop corresponding to ≈25 μL) to each well already containing 400 μL of warmed DMEM-D medium and mix gently.\nNote: With a 600 μL cell suspension after one electroporation, we typically plate 4 wells.\nIncubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nBetween 4–6 h after plating, add 1:1 (vol to vol) of pre-warmed DMEM-C2 medium to each well (500–550 μL) and put cells back at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nCritical: This step is critical for cell viability and helps to prevent contamination.\nNote: DMEM-C2 medium contains the same components than DMEM-D medium plus 2× concentrated antibiotics (Primocin) to prevent growth of microorganisms and antimitotics (cytosine arabinoside and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine) to prevent growth of few fibroblasts remaining in the chromaffin cell culture. Adding DMEM-C2 instead of refreshing medium preserves cell adhesion and prevents detaching loosely attached cells.\nNote: Pre-warm the DMEM-C2 medium to 37°C before use.\nStimulation of exocytosis and preparation of plasma membrane sheets\nTiming: 30 min\nThe purpose of this step is to apply mechanical forces to break open cells after they were stimulated to trigger exocytosis or placed in resting condition.\nPre-warm the Locke’s and high K+ depolarizing solutions in a water bath set to 37°C.\nAround 16–18 h after transfection, place cells onto a hot plate set at 37°C.\nCritical: Long-term expression of the probe Spo20p-GFP may induce cytotoxicity. In our hands, expression of Spo20p-GFP can be carried for up to 18 h after electroporation without significant cell death, but longer expression times are not recommended.",
    "Note: We recommend to simultaneously perform the next steps with untransfected bovine chromaffin cells cultured on coverslips to assess unspecific binding of antibodies (background).\nAspirate medium from wells and wash cells 3 times with Locke’s solution (1 mL per well) (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nNote: Chromaffin cells in culture are highly sensitive to mechanical stress. Manipulation and medium changes must be gentle to avoid mechanical cell stimulation.\nOptional: Before stimulation, observe cells under an inverted epifluorescence microscope to ensure cell viability and evaluate transfection efficiency.\nStimulate exocytosis.\nAdd 500 μL per well of high K+ depolarizing solution (stimulated condition) or Locke’s solution (resting condition).\nIncubate cells for 10 min at 37°C.\nNote: Pre-warm the Locke’s and high K+ depolarizing solutions in a water bath set to 37°C.\nNote: Treating each well every 60 s appears well-suited to accommodate further preparation of membrane sheets with several 4-well plates.\nDuring incubation, prepare the material required for preparation of plasma membrane sheets (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) as well as other 4-well plates for fixation of sheets by adding 400 μL of 2% ice-cold PFA per well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/589-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of plasma membrane sheets\n(A) Prepare material needed during the 10 min stimulation step.\n(B) Take a coverslip exposing Formvar-coated EM grids.\n(C) Flip the coverslip onto cells.\n(D) Place the cork in the center of the well and press during 25 s to allow cell adhesion to Formvar-coated grids.\n(E) Rapidly recover the upper coverslips with forceps to break off cells.\n(F) Lift the coverslip to expose membrane sheets on the upper side.\n(G) Transfer the coverslip carrying grids in fixative.\nImmediately after the end of stimulation, prepare plasma membrane sheets for each well of resting or stimulated chromaffin cells, according to the protocol previously described (Delavoie et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "Flip a coverslip carrying Formvar-coated EM grids onto cells (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nPlace the cork above the coverslips and slightly press for 20–25 s (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nRapidly dissociate the coverslips with 2 forceps and lift the one carrying grids (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nNote: This procedure promotes cell adhesion to the Formvar film to induce cell fracture by dissociation of the two coverslips, exposing cytoplasmic face of the upper cell membrane.\nCritical: Plasma membrane sheets must be prepared as quickly as possible (typically in less than 30 s) to preserve membrane organization.\nImmediately transfer the coverslip carrying grids to a well containing 2% ice-cold PFA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G) and fix sheets for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove fixative from wells and wash 6 times with 500 μL of PBS per well at room temperature.\nCritical: During washing steps, PBS changes must be very gentle to prevent detachment of Formvar film from the grids or detachment of the grids from the coverslip. If one grid completely pulls away from the coverslip, remove it and put it in another well to apply the following steps. These grids can be imaged if needed, but we preferentially use the grids still attached to the coverslip.\nPause Point: Sheets can be stored in PBS at 4°C for few days until performing immunocytochemistry.\nImmunolabeling and sample treatment for electron microscopy\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThe purpose of this step is to label GFP on plasma membrane sheets with specific antibodies and prepare the samples for TEM imaging.\nRemove PBS from wells and incubate sheets with 400 μL of blocking solution per well overnight at 4°C.\nIncubate sheets with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-GFP) (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nPrepare a 1:100 dilution of the primary antibody in the blocking solution.",
    "Retrieve coverslips from wells one by one using a forceps and dispose them on raised supports in a humidity chamber (we use caps of Eppendorf® tubes glued to a Petri dish).\nImmediately add 50 μL of primary antibody dilution onto each coverslip.\nAdd 2 mL of water in the dish to create a humidity chamber, seal, and incubate for 4 h at room temperature.\nCritical: Rapidly apply the antibody solution onto the grids to avoid sample drying and be careful to entirely cover the grids on each coverslip.\nNote: If needed, additional immunolabeling can be performed simultaneously, with other non-rabbit primary antibodies.\nNote: We recommend assessing unspecific binding of secondary antibodies by skipping this step for one sample.\nAfter incubation with the primary antibody, replace coverslips in wells of a 4-well plate containing PBS.\nGently wash 6 times for 5 min with 500 μL of PBS per well at room temperature.\nIncubate sheets with 15 nm gold particle-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])\nPrepare a 1% solution of the secondary antibody in the blocking solution.\nRemove PBS from wells and add 400 μL of secondary antibody dilution per well.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nNote: If several primary antibodies have been used simultaneously, use secondary antibodies with different diameter of gold particles.\nRemove secondary antibody solution and gently wash 6 times with 500 μL of PBS per well at room temperature.\nRemove PBS from wells and incubate samples with 400 μL per well of 2.5% ice-cold glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h at 2°C–8°C.\nNote: From this step, all the sample treatment should be done under a chemical hood.\nRemove fixative from wells and rinse in sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M for 2 h at room temperature.",
    "Postfix with 0.5% OsO4 solution for 45 min - 1 h at room temperature.\nRemove fixative from wells and rinse with sterile ultrapure water for the same time that osmium post-fixation (45 min - 1 h) at room temperature.\nDehydrate samples by incubating with a graded series of ethanol (25, 50, 70, 95 and 100%), each for 15 min.\nIncubate samples with 400 μL per well of HMDS - ethanol 50%/50% solution for 15 min at room temperature.\nIncubate samples with 400 μL per well of HMDS for 2 × 15 min at room temperature.\nAir-dry samples overnight under the chemical hood.\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at room temperature to be imaged later.\nImage acquisition by TEM\nTiming: 4–8 h (depending on the number of coverslips)\nThe purpose of this step is to obtain images of the localization of the PA probe on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane by electron microscopy.\nGently take out one grid from the coverslip with a forceps.\nMount the grid in a standard TEM holder and insert the holder into the TEM.\nScan the grid at low magnification (× 25,000) to find stained sheets with docked secretory granules.\nAcquire at least 30 images per condition at high magnification (× 60,000)."
