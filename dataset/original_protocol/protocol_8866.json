    "NOTE: ANIMAL ETHICS STATEMENT\nAnimal studies on rats followed the guidelines valid in France, and were approved by the local Ethics Committee (#40.04, University of Aix-Marseille Medical School, Marseille, France).\n1. Harvesting and Freezing Rat Brain\nPrepare items required: liquid nitrogen (N2liq.) in Dewar that is large enough to keep a freezing clamp (at least 2-3 L volume); anesthetic (e.g., isoflurane, or ketamine/xylazine); anesthesia chamber; sterile dissection tools: surgical scissors, scalpel, forceps; tissue wipes and bottle with cleaning alcohol (ethanol); needles (25 G); 1 ml and 10 ml syringes. Label aluminum sheets (ca. 10 x 10 cm) with sticky tape. Use sheets to wrap individual freeze-clamped rat brains.\n\tNOTE: Always wear protective gloves and eye protection goggles or mask when handling liquid nitrogen!\nFill Dewar with N2liq. and place freezing clamp in a Dewar. Make sure the amount of N2liq in the Dewar is sufficient for repeated freeze-clamp procedures (several liters; the amount of N2liq evaporating during each freeze-clamping depends on the size of the clamp).\nAnesthetize animal (e.g., by isoflurane, or by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine mixture). Proceed to euthanasia by cardiac puncture to prevent bleeding when scalp is removed and skull is opened. Steps 1.4-1.7 below describe this standard procedure.\n\tNOTE: In special protocols requiring maximum preservation of glucose and high-energy metabolites, sacrifice rat by funnel-freezing the brain of the anesthetized animal with N2liq11 after retraction of the scalp. Then, dissect brain out of the skull under intermittent N2liq to minimize post-mortem metabolism12.\nMoisten head of rat with cleaning alcohol. Use surgical scissors to (i) remove scalp, and (ii) open skull along cranial sutures.",
    "Use forceps to open skull further, and to remove entire brain from underneath the open skull, positioning the head upside down. Remove quickly any visible traces of blood using tissue wipes. If brain hemispheres are metabolically and morphologically symmetric, it is convenient to use one of the hemispheres for metabolic analysis after separating it from the other hemisphere by incision with the scalpel. If required, use the remaining hemisphere for other brain studies such as histology.\nQuickly remove freezing clamp from N2liq-filled Dewar, place entire or half rat brain on one inner surface, clamp and immediately insert freezing clamp into N2liq-filled Dewar while holding clamp firmly compressed. Ensure that steps 1.3-1.6 take no longer than 60 sec.\nAfter 1-2 min remove freezing clamp from the Dewar, open clamp, loosen frozen brain tissue from clamp, and wrap frozen tissue in appropriately labeled aluminum sheet (see 1.1 above). Make sure that the label is legible and stays firmly in place after the sample is wrapped. Quickly place wrapped sample in N2liq. Perform the entire procedure as quickly as possible to avoid thawing of frozen brain tissue.\nStore frozen sample in N2liq or in a freezer at -80 °C until metabolite extraction.\n\tNOTE: Whenever a biological sample is to be stored for more than one year, storage at N2liq temperature is to be preferred over -80 °C. This also applies to the remainder of this protocol.\n2. Preparation of Metabolite Extraction Procedure\nPrepare tissue homogenizer and matching test tubes (e.g., 10 mm inner diameter, depending on the diameter of the homogenizer shaft; usually made of plastic). Use electrical homogenizers rather than manually driven homogenizers (tissue grinders). Prepare vortexer and laboratory balance.",
    "Prepare bucket filled with crushed ice. Keep sufficient quantitites of methanol, chloroform and water on ice (4 ml each per 250-350 mg frozen brain tissue).\nPrepare transfer pipettes and vials.\n\t\nPrepare glass vials (≥20 ml volume) with screw caps and place on ice (one vial per tissue extract). Fit screw caps with a Teflon septa resistant to chloroform.\nPrepare 5 ml plastic pipettes for dispensing methanol and water, and glass pipettes or Hamilton syringes for dispensing chloroform. Prepare additional plastic pipettes (5 or 10 ml volume) for transferring mixtures of tissue homogenate and methanol.\nMake sure all glassware is thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and carefully dried before use to remove traces of impurities, notably NMR-detectable formate and acetate.\nFill porcelain mortar with N2liq, place porcelain pestle in mortar and refill with N2liq. Nitrogen will evaporate until temperature of mortar and pestle is sufficiently low. Keep small amount of N2liq in mortar.\n3. Extraction of Metabolites\nRemove frozen brain tissue sample from storage (N2liq tank or -80 °C freezer). Then, immediately transfer tissue sample to mortar partially filled with N2liq.\nUse the N2liq-cold pestle to break the frozen brain tissue into smaller pieces that easily fit into the test tubes used for tissue homogenization. To prevent pieces of frozen tissue from being projected out of the mortar in the process, break up the tissue while still being wrapped in aluminum sheet. Don't grind frozen tissue to powder as this would make transfer to the test tube more difficult (increased risk of water condensation). IMPORTANT: Throughout the entire procedure, add N2liq to mortar as needed to keep the sample deep frozen.",
    "Mix small pieces of frozen brain tissue thoroughly, weigh out 250-350 mg and transfer to a test tube filled with ice-cold methanol (4 ml for 250-350 mg brain tissue). Every time pieces of frozen tissue are added, homogenize these immediately with the tissue homogenizer.\n\tNOTE: Complete this entire procedure quickly to avoid (i) significant condensation of water on the sample which would lead to an overestimation of the sample weight, and (ii) heating and thawing of the sample. Individual tissue pieces should be in a frozen state at the beginning of the homogenization process.\nAfter the last piece of the frozen rat brain sample has been added to the test tube and homogenized, transfer the homogenate to a ≥20 ml volume glass vial, close screw cap and let stand on ice for 15 min. If the volume of the test tube is not sufficiently large for ≥4 ml methanol, use a smaller methanol volume to homogenize a part of the frozen brain tissue, transfer the mixture to the glass vial and continue homogenizing the residual tissue pieces with fresh methanol. Make sure the total methanol volume is 4 ml per 250-350 mg brain tissue.\nAdd the same volume of ice-cold chloroform (i.e., 4 ml per 250-350 mg brain tissue) to homogenate, vortex thoroughly and let stand on ice for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Always use ventilated chemical hood when handling volatile solvents, notably chloroform!\nAdd the same volume of water (i.e., 4 ml per 250-350 mg brain tissue) to homogenate, vortex thoroughly and let stand at -20 °C overnight.\n4. Preparation of Phase Separation and Solvent Evaporation",
    "Prepare cold centrifuge (4 °C, 13,000 x g at maximum radius) and centrifuge tubes. Ensure that the latter are ≥20 ml volume, resistant to chloroform, and can withstand centrifugal forces of 13,000 x g. Use dedicated glass centrifuge tubes but rinse (as all glass ware) with distilled water before use (see 2.3).\nPrepare thoroughly rinsed glass Pasteur pipettes and an appropriate propipettor (bulb, manual pipette pump, automatic pipette aid/pipettor, etc.).\nPrepare two additional thoroughly rinsed tubes (≥15 ml volume) per brain sample, one of which needs to be resistant to chloroform (made of glass or Teflon), the other one to methanol (made of plastic resistant to methanol, or glass).\nPrepare solvent evaporation apparatus (commercially available or homebuilt). Ensure that this device provides a finely controlled stream of dry nitrogen gas that is directed onto the surface of an extract solution containing volatile solvents (methanol, chloroform).\nPrepare two additional trays or buckets filled with ice: one for sample transport on ice, and another one for keeping samples cold during the evaporation process.\nPrepare lyophilizer (freeze-dryer) and materials needed for lyophilization: (i) one 50 ml centrifuge tube or vacuum round bottom flask per extract, and (ii) N2liq to freeze the aqueous phase of samples (≤0.3 L per sample). If centrifuge tube is used, also prepare wide-neck vacuum filter bottle suitable for lyophilizer.\n5. Phase Separation and Solvent Evaporation\nFor complete phase separation, transfer the methanol/chloroform/water/brain tissue homogenate (see 3.6) to a chloroform-resistant centrifuge tube (≥20 ml volume) and centrifuge at 13,000 x g and 4 °C for 40 min.\n\tNOTE: Two phases will form, separated by a layer of precipitated protein. The lower (heavier) phase consists of methanol, chloroform and dissolved lipids, whereas the upper (lighter) phase consists of water, methanol and dissolved water-soluble metabolites.",
    "Use a Pasteur pipette to transfer the upper phase to an appropriate ≥15 ml tube (plastic resistant to methanol, or glass). Keep on ice.\nUse a fresh Pasteur pipette to transfer the lower phase to an appropriate ≥15 ml tube (glass or Teflon). Keep on ice.\nStore the layer of precipitated protein at -80 °C if it is to be used for determination of total protein; or else discard.\nKeep the tube with the water/methanol phase (see 5.2) on ice and evaporate methanol by directing a dry nitrogen stream onto the surface of the extract solution. Alternatively, gently bubble nitrogen through the extract solution. Terminate the evaporation process when nitrogen bubbling no longer causes volume reduction in the extract solution. At this time, continue with lyophilization (see 5.7), or freeze and keep sample at -80 °C with the tube closed (screw cap or Parafilm) until ready for lyophilization.\nPlace the tube with the methanol/chloroform phase (see 5.3) on ice and evaporate methanol by directing a dry nitrogen stream onto the surface of the extract solution. When all solvent is evaporated, terminate the process and keep the sample at -80 °C with the tube closed (screw cap or Parafilm) until ready for NMR analysis.\nPrepare Aqueous Phase for Lyophilization\n\t\nAfter the end of the methanol evaporation process (see 5.5), transfer the sample to a thoroughly rinsed 50 ml centrifuge tube (if the sample is frozen, thaw before transfer). Alternatively, transfer to a vacuum round bottom flask.\nFreeze extract solution by rotating centrifuge tube (or round bottom flask) partially inserted in N2liq such that the inner surface of the tube or flask is progressively covered by frozen liquid. Make sure no N2liq. can enter the receptacle.",
    "When all the liquid is frozen, cover the tube with a punctured lid or screw cap to allow the vapor to escape, and place the tube in a wide-neck vacuum filter bottle.\nStart lyophilization after attaching the flask or bottle to the freeze-dryer.\nTerminate the lyophilization process when the sample is entirely dry. Keep the sample at -80 °C in a closed tube (with a tight cap!) until used for NMR analysis.\n\tNOTE: Usually no more than 24 hr are needed for lyophilization. Several samples can be lyophilized simultaneously, depending on the design of the lyophilizer, and on whether centrifuge tubes in wide-neck bottles or round bottom flasks are used.\n6. Preparation of NMR Samples\nStore dried and lyophilized extracts at very low temperature (≤-80 °C). Re-dissolve lyophilizates for preparation of NMR samples immediately before NMR experiment.\n\tNOTE: Storing samples in solution and/or near room temperature may result in sample degradation!\nPrepare an aqueous 200 mM solution of the chelating agent, trans-1,2-cyclohexyldiaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA), as follows:\n\t\nAdd pure water (e.g., 20 ml) to a test tube or centrifuge tube, and add the amount of CDTA powder necessary to generate a 200 mM solution.\n\t\tNOTE: A substantial proportion of CDTA will not be soluble, because the pH is very low since the acid form of CDTA was used rather than a CDTA salt.\nCarefully add, step by step, increasing amounts of CsOH powder to the CDTA solution, and vortex thoroughly after each addition.\n\t\tNOTE: The soluble CDTA fraction will increase with increasing CsOH content in the aqueous solution. Avoid \"overtitration\", i.e. add less than the stoichiometric amount of CsOH to the CDTA solution.",
    "When nearly all the CDTA powder is dissolved, start measuring pH after each CsOH addition and thorough vortexing. Terminate CsOH addition when the final pH is reached (Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: At this time, all the CDTA will be dissolved. The use of Cs+ as a counterion to CDTA is generally preferred over Na+ or K+. Cs+ is a soft Lewis acid due its large ionic radius, as opposed to Na+ and K+ that have smaller ionic radii and are hard acids. Consequently, Cs+ forms complexes with phosphates (hard bases) less readily than do Na+ and K+. This is advantageous for 31P NMR spectroscopy of phosphorylated metabolites because complexation tends to increase NMR linewidths, notably under conditions of slow to intermediate ion exchange.\nFor 31P NMR analysis of phospholipids (PL), dissolve dried lipids (see 5.6) in 700 µl of a solvent mixture consisting of deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), methanol and the CDTA solution prepared as described in 6.2 (5:4:1 volume ratio). Transfer the sample to a microcentrifuge tube. Use direct-displacement (or positive-displacement) micropipette with chloroform-resistant tips in both steps.\n\tNOTE: Keep in mind that changing any of the following parameters will affect the appearance (chemical shift and line widths) of PL 31P NMR spectra 13-17:\n\t(i) volume ratio CDCl3 : MeOH : CDTA solution\n\t(ii) total solvent volume used\n\t(iii) pH of the aqueous component of the solvent\n\t(iv) CDTA concentration of the aqueous component of the solvent.\n\tNOTE: In general, fine-tuning of these sample parameters (Table 1) is not necessary, and should be performed with extreme care if desired in special cases. Changing the volume ratio between solvents easily results in the formation of a system consisting of two phases instead of one homogenous phase! The one-phase system was found to be more practical than the two-phase system in most applications13,14.",
    "For 1H NMR analysis of water-soluble metabolites, dissolve lyophilizate (see 5.8) in 700 µl deuterium oxide (D2O) containing 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TSPd4) in the millimolar range (D2O containing 0.05% TSPd4 is commercially available). Transfer the sample to a microcentrifuge tube.\nAdjust the pH of the resulting aqueous extract solution to 7.3 by adding small amounts (ca. 2 µl) of deuterium chloride (DCl) and sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) solutions. First, start with 0.02 N DCl or NaOD solutions. If 2 or 3 subsequent additions do not cause sufficient pH change, continue with 0.2 N DCl or NaOD solutions. Be careful not to overtitrate.\n\tNOTE: The overall amount of DCl or NaOD solution needed depends on the amount of brain tissue extracted; note this value for precise metabolite quantitation. In most cases the combined volumes of the added DCl and NaOD solutions should be virtually negligible (close to 1% of NMR sample volume).\n7. Performance of the 31P NMR Experiment for Brain Phospholipid Analysis13,14\nFor best results, use a multinuclear high-resolution NMR spectrometer (≥9.4 Tesla field strength, corresponding to 162 MHz 31P, or 400 MHz 1H resonance frequencies). Besides the 31P coil, ensure that the 31P NMR probe possesses a 1H coil for proton decoupling. Set temperature regulation of the NMR probe to desired target value (usually 25 °C).\n\tNOTE: Probe temperature may need 10-20 min to stabilize!\nCentrifuge PL extract solution in microcentrifuge tube (see 6.3) at 4 °C and 11,000 x g for 30 min to spin down solid residues in the sample. Transfer 600 µl of the supernatant to a high-quality NMR tube (5 mm outer diameter).",
    "Prepare appropriate coaxial insert stem filled with an aqueous 20 mM methylenediphosphonate (MDP) solution at pH 7.0 for chemical-shift referencing and quantitation. Place this insert in the NMR tube filled with PL extract solution.\nFit the NMR tube with the appropriate spinner and transfer to the NMR magnet. Now spin the sample at 15-20 Hz and wait until the sample has adjusted to the set temperature (ca. 10 min).\nCarefully minimize magnetic-field inhomogeneity across sample by adjusting on-axis and off-axis shim coil currents18.\nSet NMR spectrum acquisition parameters to optimal values, which may vary as a function of magnet field strength (for a 9.4 T system, see Table 1 for recommended parameter values).\nSet number of transients per experiment (= NS).\n\t\nSet NS to about 80 (total duration of data acquisition ca. 20 min) if only the most prevalent PLs are to be quantitated with precision (phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), ethanolamine plasmalogen).\nSet NS to about 100-200 (total duration of data acquisition 1-2 hr) if less concentrated PLs are to be quantitated (alkyl-acyl-phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid).\nSet NS to about 1,500-2,000 (total duration of data acquisition 7-10 hr; overnight experiment) if very-low-concentration PLs are to be quantitated, e.g. phosphatidylinositol mono and diphosphates (PtdIP and PtdIP2), cardiolipin, lyso-PLs, alkyl-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, and occasionally others.\nAfter the end of spectrum acquisition, process free induction decay (FID) using optimized parameters. The values of these parameters vary as a function of magnetic-field strength, shim quality, and the PL signal to be quantified.\n\t\nTo obtain best results for the whole range of PLs, repeat processing using multiple (at least two) different filtering procedures. Use strong resolution enhancement for strongly overlapping signals, e.g., for PtdCho and PtdEtn regions.\nUse strong filtering (weak or no resolution enhancement) for weak signals.",
    "Filter very weak and broad signals without significant overlap by apodization (e.g., LB = 3 Hz) to increase signal-to-noise ratio, e.g. PtdIP and PtdIP2. See Table 1 for characteristic processing parameters.\nQuantify the area of each PL signal with respect to the area under the signal of the reference compound (MDP) in the same spectrum.\nCalibrate the signal of the reference compound (MDP) in a separate experiment, using a 5 mm NMR tube filled with (i) a phosphorus compound of known concentration, and (ii) the same coaxial insert stem used in PL 31P NMR experiments (see 7.3 and 7.9).\nCalculate individual PL concentrations based on relative areas of PL signals on the one hand (see 7.9), and on calibration value obtained for MDP from coaxial insert on the other (see 7.10). Take into account that the number of phosphorus nuclei contributing to a particular 31P NMR signal may vary as a function of the molecular origin of that signal.\n\tNOTE: The MDP phosphonate signal (usually referenced to 19.39 ppm) represents two phosphorus nuclei, as does the cardiolipin phosphate signal. All other PL 31P NMR signals detected in brain extracts represent one phosphorus nucleus each.\nUse statistics software as needed to compare brain PL levels between groups of animals.\n8. Performance of the 1H NMR Experiment for Analysis of Water-soluble Brain Metabolites\nSet temperature regulation of the 1H NMR probe to desired target value (usually 25 °C). See also remarks in 7.1.\nCentrifuge the aqueous extract solution in microcentrifuge tube (see 6.5) at 4 °C and 11,000 x g for 30 min to spin down solid residues in the sample. Transfer 600 µl of the supernatant to a high-quality NMR tube (5 mm outer diameter).",
    "Transfer NMR tube to NMR magnet, shim and set NMR spectrum acquisition parameters to optimal values as explained in 7.4-7.6. See also Table 1 for recommended parameter values.\nSet the number of transients per experiment to about NS = 32 (total duration of data acquisition ca. 13 min). To obtain good signal-to-noise ratios for very weak signals, notably in the aromatic region, use NS = 64 (total duration of data acquisition ca. 26 min) or more.\nAfter the end of spectrum acquisition, process free induction decay (FID) using optimized parameters. The values of these parameters vary slightly as a function of magnetic field strength, shim quality, and the metabolite signal to be quantified.\n\tNOTE: In most cases, it is sufficient to process each spectrum once, employing a set of processing parameters presenting a good compromise for all metabolite signals. See Table 1 for characteristic processing parameters.\nQuantify the area of each metabolite signal (often a multiplet, sometimes overlapping with other singlets or multiplets stemming from different molecules) with respect to the area under the signal of the reference compound (TSP-d4) in the same spectrum.\nCalculate individual metabolite concentrations based on TSP-d4 concentration (see 6.4). Take into account that the number of protons contributing to a particular 1H NMR signal may vary as a function of the molecular origin of that signal. The TSP-d4 trimethyl signal (referenced to 0.0 ppm) represents nine protons.\nUse statistics software as needed to compare brain metabolite levels between groups of animals.\nSubscription Required.
