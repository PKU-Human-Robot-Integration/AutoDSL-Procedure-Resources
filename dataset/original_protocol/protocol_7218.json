Incubate cells with BrdU for 30 min.Collect cells in FACS tubes.Abl pre-B cells:Resuspend cells briefly by pipetting and transfer cells directly to FACS tubes.Spin down cells, decant supernatant by inverting tubes quickly to pour out media and tapping the inverted tubes on a paper towel, and wash cells by resuspending them in 1mL of 1X FACS wash, followed by spinning down cells again.Note: Do not use vacuum to avoid loss of samples.

Prepare Click-iT Plus reaction cocktail according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: Use Click-iT Plus reaction cocktail within 15 min of preparation. Resuspend cells in each tube in 250 μL of Click-iT Plus reaction cocktail and incubate at room temperature for 30 min, protected from light.Wash cells with 2 mL of 1× BD Perm/Wash Buffer.",
    "Add 15 μL of 7-AAD and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.Add 300 μL of 1× PBS to each tube.Record DNA content (7-AAD), RPA (Alexa Fluro 488), and phospho-H2AX (S139) or EdU (Alexa Fluro 647) on BD FACS Fortessa X-20 or equivalent flow cytometer.Note: The choice of fluorophores should be based on the availability of reagents and the flow cytometers. As we use Alexa Fluro 647 for visualizing phospho-H2AX (S139) and EdU in our RPA assay, we typically do not perform phospho-H2AX (S139) staining in the analysis of proliferating cells.
