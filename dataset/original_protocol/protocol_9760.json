    "NOTE: Users should review all MSDS for the materials and supplies used in this protocol. Appropriate PPE should be worn at each step and sterile technique used during experimentation. Sections 1-7 discuss the device fabrication.\n1. Device fabrication- Mask design\nNOTE: Refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of the microfabrication process. The microfabrication steps are to be carried out in a cleanroom environment. Additional PPE is necessary (hair net, facial hair net, mask, cleanroom suit, shoe covers).\nInstall a CAD software of choice, design a 2-Dimensional 'mask' of both the microfluidic channel and electrodes and save the design in desired file format (i.e., .dxf, .dwg).\n\tNOTE: Refer to Supplementary Figure 1 for an example of a 2-Dimensional mask schematic.\nSend to a supplier of choice to be printed. Ensure the dimensions of the designs are within the resolution capabilities of the supplier.\n2. Device fabrication- Photolithography\nNOTE: The provided microfabrication recipes are adopted from the photoresists' manufacturer's recommendations and should only be used as a starting point34. Exact values for baking times, exposure times, etc., need to be optimized for each fabrication protocol. It is recommended to use wafer tweezers for handling both silicon wafers and glass slides.\nMicrofluidic channel fabrication\n\t\nSilicon wafer and soda-lime glass slide cleaning: Follow steps 2.1.2-2.1.3 to perform silicon wafer and 1\" × 3\" soda-lime glass slide cleaning (both referred to as 'substrate').\nSubmerge the substrates in an acetone bath, an isopropanol (IPA) bath and a deionized water bath for 10 min each. Perform this 3-step wash serially at room temperature.\nRemove and dry the surface using a pressurized nitrogen or filtered air gas source. Place the substrates into a 150 °C oven for a minimum of 30 min to allow evaporation of the remaining moisture.",
    "SU-8 photolithography on silicon wafer: Perform photolithography on the silicon wafer following steps 2.1.5-2.1.14.\n\t\tNOTE: To achieve a microfluidic channel height of 20 µm, SU-8 2000 series negative photoresist was used. Exact spin rates will vary depending on the formulation of SU-8 (i.e., 2010, 2015, etc.); however, the following conditions are for the SU-8 2010 formulation35.\nRemove the silicon wafer from the 150 °C oven and allow it to cool to room temperature (RT).\nSecure the wafer to the chuck of the wafer spin coater using the spin coater's vacuum system. Program the spinner. Step 1 - 500 rpm for 10 s at an acceleration of 100 rpm/s, Step 2 - 1000 rpm for 30 s at an acceleration of 300 rpm/s.\nDispense 4 mL of SU-8 2010 photoresist onto the center of the silicon wafer. Run the program. Once the system comes to a halt, turn off the vacuum.\nUsing tweezers, transfer the SU-8 coated silicon wafer on a hot plate at 95 °C for 4-5 min for soft bake. Then remove the wafer from the hot plate and allow it to cool to RT.\n\t\tNOTE: Follow the proper start up procedure for the lab-specific photolithographic mask aligner.\nSecure the photomask with the 2D microfluidic channel designs onto the mask holder. Insert the silicon wafer, with the SU-8 coating facing upwards, onto the wafer chuck.\nSet the exposure settings for 150 mJ/cm2 and run the machine.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not look directly at the UV light source to avoid potential eye damage.\nPlace the SU-8 coated silicon wafer on a hot plate at 95 °C for 4-5 min for post-exposure bake.",
    "Submerge the silicon wafer in the SU-8 developer solution (see Table of Materials) for 3-4 min. Apply gentle agitation. Remove the wafer from the solution and rinse the surface with IPA.\nDry the surface using a pressurized nitrogen or filtered air gas source. Inspect the features under a microscope using a UV filter and ensure no obvious defects in the microfluidic channels.\nPlace the silicon wafer into a 150 °C oven for a minimum of 30 min for a hard bake.\nAllow to cool down to RT and use stylus profilometry to measure the exact height and slope of the channel sidewalls.\nPhotolithography on Glass Slides\n\tNOTE: Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) is used as an adhesion promoter for the S1818 positive photoresist36.\n\t\nRemove the glass slide from the 150 °C oven and allow it to cool to RT.\nSecure the glass slide to the chuck of the spinner using vacuum and program the spinner. Step 1 - 500 rpm for 10 s at an acceleration of 100 rpm/s. Step 2 - 3000 rpm for 30 sat an acceleration of 300 rpm/s.\nDispense 3-4 droplets of HMDS across the surface of the glass slide. Run the program.\n\t\tNOTE: To achieve a surface coating of ~3 µm, S1800 positive photoresist series should be used. Exact spin rates will vary depending on the formulation; the recommendations below are for the S1818 formulation34.\nDispense 1 mL of photoresist onto the surface of the glass slide. Ensure enough to cover the surface area.\nRun the program. Once the system comes to a halt, turn off the vacuum, and remove the glass slide.\nPlace the S1818 coated glass slide on a hot plate at 120 °C for 4 min for a soft bake. Remove and allow to come to RT.",
    "Secure the photomask with the 2D electrode designs onto the mask holder.\nInsert and align the glass slide, with the S1818 coating facing upwards, onto the wafer chuck. Set the exposure settings for 250 mJ/cm2 and run the machine.\n\t\tNOTE: Different contact aligner models may be more or less accommodating to non-circular, varying thickness substrates.\nSubmerge the glass slide in MF-319 developer solution for 2 min. Apply gentle agitation. Rinse the surface of the glass slide with deionized water.\nDry the surface using a pressurized nitrogen or filtered air gas source and observe the features under a microscope using a UV filter. Make sure there are no obvious defects in the lithographic patterns.\nPlace glass slide into the 150 °C oven, ensuring substrate surface of interest is facing up, for a minimum of 30 min for a hard bake. Remove from the oven and keep protected from light.\n3. Device fabrication: Hydrofluoric acid (HF) etch\nCAUTION: This step involves the handling and disposal of hydrofluoric acid (HF), which can cause deep, painful chemical burns. Additional PPE should be used to protect the handler (face shield, elbow-length chemically resistant gloves, chemically resistant apron with sleeves). Calcium gluconate acid neutralizer and skin gel should be kept in proximity of the lab bench. This step should not be performed alone. HF should never be stored in or dispensed into glass containers as the container will be etched by the acid.\nNOTE: The HF uniformly etches the exposed glass (i.e., the electrode design) to form a recess in the glass, allowing for better edge resolution of the electrode pattern after metal deposition (section 4).",
    "Submerge the glass slide in 10:1 buffered HF solution for 1 min in a polytetrafluoroethylene container. Transfer and wash the glass slides in deionized water. Repeat the wash step 3 times.\nDry the surface using a pressurized nitrogen or filtered air gas source. Place glass substrates in a 65 °C oven overnight to remove any remaining moisture. Cover the substrates from light.\n4. Device fabrication: Physical vapor deposition\nNOTE: This step involves the metal deposition onto the glass slide substrates to define the electrode patterns. Commonly used metal electrodes are chromium/gold and titanium/platinum. Gold and platinum do not adhere to the glass substrate, so a seed adhesion layer of chromium or titanium, respectively, is required to promote adhesion37.\nFollow the cleanroom-specific protocol to operate the in-house PVD system. This work uses a DC sputtering system and sputter with 100 SCCM Argon gas at a pressure of ~8 mTorr and 200 W power.\nSputter titanium for 8 min at a rate of ~100 Å/min. Sputter platinum for 10 min at a rate of ~200 Å/min. Remove the substrates from the PVD chamber.\n5. Device fabrication: Photoresist lift-off\nNOTE: This step involves dissolving the photoresist layer in an acetone bath, leaving the adhered platinum electrodes patterned on the glass slides.\nSubmerge the metal-coated glass slides in an acetone bath for ~10 min.\nSonicate the bath to introduce agitation to break up the unadhered metal film. Use an acetone-soaked wipe to remove any residues if necessary.\nOnce all photoresist/metal is removed, wash the electrode patterns with deionized water, and place them in a 65 °C oven overnight to remove any remaining surface moisture.\nUse stylus profilometry to measure the profile of the patterned electrodes.\n6. Device fabrication: Soft lithography",
    "NOTE: This step involves replica molding the microfluidic channel onto the SU-8 master relief structure using an elastomer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\nSilicon wafer silanization\n\tNOTE: This is an optional step; however, it will increase the lifetime of the SU-8 relief structure that was fabricated in subsection 2.1. This step should be performed in a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nSecure the wafer to the bottom of a Petri dish and place the Petri dish into a desiccator.\nSurround the perimeter of the silicon wafer with approximately 50 µL of Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane. Connect vacuum (vacuum pump or house vacuum line) and run for 20 min.\nPDMS replica molding\n\t\nIn a disposable container (e.g., weigh boat, plastic cup), mix PDMS elastomer base to hardener at a 10:1 weight ratio on top of an electronic balance. Pour the PDMS solution over the silicon wafer and place the mixture under a vacuum to remove all air bubbles.\nCure at 65 °C for a minimum of 4 h allowing the PDMS to solidify. Using the tip of a razor blade, cut out the molded PDMS and peel from the silicon wafer.\nUsing a sharpened biopsy punch, remove PDMS from the inlet/outlets of the device. For this device, 0.75 mm and 3 mm biopsy punches were used for the inlets and the outlets, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: The biopsy punch used should have a slightly smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the interconnecting tubing to ensure a tight seal of tubing in the reservoirs.\nSonication cleaning of PDMS\n\t\nSubmerge the PDMS devices in IPA and place them into a sonicator for 30-45 min to remove any PDMS debris from the inlet/outlets. PDMS may swell in the IPA solution.",
    "Rinse with deionized water and place in a 65 °C oven overnight to allow the PDMS to de-swell back to the normal size.\n\t\tNOTE: Any leftover debris can clog the device during experimentation. Large pieces of debris can be removed from the PDMS surface using a piece of scotch tape prior to sonication.\n7. Device fabrication: PDMS bonding/wire attachment\nNOTE: This step involves treating the surface of the PDMS and glass substrate with an oxygen plasma to form an irreversible bond between the PDMS and glass38. The recipe provided may need to be adapted to the exact system used in the laboratory.\nCut the devices to size and ensure the surface of the PDMS device is clean. If not reclean, follow the steps in subsection 6.3.\nProgram the plasma generator. Set Power to 70 W, Time to 35 s, Pressure to 325 mTorr, Flow Rate of oxygen gas to 60 SCCM. Place PDMS and electrode glass slide into the system with the features facing up and run the program.\nRemove the devices and quickly align channel features to the electrodes using a stereoscope. Firmly apply pressure from the center of the PDMS towards the sides to remove any unwanted air bubbles at the bonding interface.\nPlace on a hot place at 95 °C for at least 2 min to finalize the bonding procedure and let the device cool down at RT.\nCut 2 pieces of 22-G solid wire at ~6\" lengths and strip the insulator from both ends.\nBond the wires to electrode pads using silver conductive epoxy. Place completed devices in a 65 °C oven overnight.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63103/63103fig02.jpg",

    "Plate the cells at a 5:1 to 20:1 dilution in a 6-well plate (2 mL of DMEM per well) to be harvested for electroporation experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: HEK293 cells plated 24 h prior to electroporation experiments to achieve ~70% confluency at cell harvest (subsection 8.3). An inconsistent harvest schedule can lead to variability in electroporation results.\nElectroporation buffer\n\t\nPrepare electroporation buffer\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to Sherba et al. for specifics on the electroporation buffer preparation8. The buffer composition was 285 mM Sucrose, 0.7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM NaOH (pH: 7.4; osmolality: 310 mOsm, conductivity: 500 µS/cm). Electroporation buffer should be formulated in a sterile fashion and stored at 4 °C for a shelf life of ~1 month. Electroporation buffer formulation should be optimized on a per cell type basis.\nCell harvest and pDNA addition\n\t\nFollow the same steps as cell passage (8.1.2-8.1.4).\nWash the cells in sterile 1x PBS, transfer-cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge cells at 770 x g for 2 min.\nWash HEK293 cell pellet in the electroporation buffer and centrifuge at 770 x g for 2 min.

Gently mix the pDNA/cell suspension and transfer the suspension into a 1 cc syringe for experimentation.\n9. Hardware/experimental setup\nNOTE: Prior to harvesting cells for experimentation, ensure the experimental setup is completed to minimize the amount of time the cells are suspended in the electroporation buffer. Turn on electronics 20-30 min prior to experiments to warm up. Refer to Figure 3 for a schematic of the experimental setup for the operation of the single-cell detection module.",
    "NOTE: A custom-built PA90 Op-Amp circuit was developed to accommodate both the sensitivity required for single-cell level detection using the lock-in amplifier and the high voltages required to apply sufficiently strong electroporation pulses. Refer to PA90 datasheet for specifications on recommended circuitry39.\nInitialize the lock-in amplifier with current pre-amplifier settings and set via the algorithm.

Connect the output to the input of the 50x amplifier.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember the 50x gain when programming the pulse amplitude. I.e., to achieve an electric field strength of 1 kV/cm, a total of 30 V is required, 30 V/300 µm (distance between electrodes), therefore the function generator output should be set to 30/50, or 600 mV.\nVerify the outputs of the 50x Amplifier using an oscilloscope. Output 1-100 V from Power Supply 2 (9.2.2). Output 2-Variable amplitude for the electroporation pulse (9.2.4).\nConnect a 10x probe to an oscilloscope channel and to the completed micro-device (device under test, DUT) in step 7.6 where the electroporation pulse is going to be applied.

Double-check all lock-in settings in the algorithm code (most importantly, lock-in output frequency).\nMicroscope/CCD camera",
    "Place the micro-device onto the stage of the microscope via a slide holder. Turn on the CCD camera and bring the microfluidic channel into focus. Use a 4x or 10x objective.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63103/63103fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Experimental setup schematic-Single cell detection. The high-power op-amp (PA-90) allows for the superposition of the high voltage electroporation pulse onto the lock-in Output AC signal that is required for the single-cell detection. This excitation signal passes through the micro-electroporation device (Device Under Test, DUT) where the current is then amplified by the current pre-amplifier and fed into the algorithm. The system continuously monitors for the cell detection event. Upon cell entry, a digital signal is generated by the lock-in amplifier to trigger the application of the electroporation pulse to the cell(s) in transit.
