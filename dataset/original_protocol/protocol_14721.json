    "Ethics Statement: All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Hunter College of The City University of New York.\n1. Pre-experiment Procedures\nUpon arrival to the animal facility, initially house 3 BALB/c mice to a cage with a filtered top and wood chip bedding. Ensure that the mice have free access to food, purina rodent chow, and water. Bedding and food should be changed twice a week while cages should be cleaned once a week.\nInduce general anesthesia in mice using an isoflurane vaporizer along with oxygen at a constant flow rate of 1 L per min. The system is self-reliant and includes a precision vaporizer.\nPosition animal in a plastic box that has the precision vaporizer and gas/anesthetic system connected to it. Initially set the vaporizer to 2.5 until animal is unconscious, at which point lower the vaporizer to 2.\nAt that time, switch the valve line, sealing it to the box and opening it to the nose cone.\nMove the animal to the preparation area, with the nose cone placed properly and connected (for maintenance anesthesia).\nPrepare 5 × 106 BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse HCC cells for implantation per mouse. BNL 1ME A.7R.1 should be growing in medium (10% heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-Glutamine) incubating in a cell culture dish at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with air and 5 % CO2.\nWith a syringe having a 20 G needle, implant 100 µl of PBS containing 5 x 106 BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells into a lobe of the livers of BALB/c mice to produce the primary tumors. Post-implantation, house the BALB/c mice in a cage with the same house requirements as pre-implantation.",
    "At the experimental end point, clinical evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is observable as significant reduction in body condition score (usually detected after 4 weeks). At this point, there is a likelihood that primary tumors have developed in the liver while metastatic deposits have formed in the lungs. Thereafter, commence the process of the isolation and propagation of circulating tumor cells.\n2. Collection of Whole Blood for Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation\nNOTE: Properly sanitized the surgery area and make sure it is clutter-free. Autoclave all surgical instruments or soak in a disinfectant according to manufacturer's recommendation\nSacrifice mice by humane euthanasia at experimental end-point (clinical evidence of tumor development). Euthanization of mice should involve CO2 asphyxiation. Observe the mice properly to confirm anesthesia is correctly distributed. Carbon dioxide should be released slowly into the chamber over a period of 5 - 10 min, causing respiratory arrest. Follow by intracardiac exsanguination and cervical dislocation.5\nUse a 25 G needle attached to a 1 ml syringe for collection of whole blood. Heparanize the syringe with 0.01 ml heparin. Puncture skin immediately with the needle inferior to the xyphisternum at approximately 45° angle. Advance needle slowly to puncture the heart, and then lower the angle of the needle. Steadily hold the needle and syringe in place, and draw out 500 µl - 1,000 µl of whole blood from the heart.\nRemove the syringe and needle and transfer the blood into a pre-labelled 1.5 ml pyrogen-free tube. Centrifuge the whole blood collected into 1.5 ml pyrogen-free tube at 1,167 x g for 5 min.  \n\tNOTE: The centrifugation separates the whole blood sample into three layers: the bottom or hematocrit layer consisting of red blood cells, an intermediate thin layer of buffy coat, and a top plasma layer.",
    "Remove the plasma carefully by pipetting and collecting it into a separate 1.5 ml pyrogen-free tube for further experiments such as detection of cell-free nucleic acids7.\nFor isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), collect the buffy coat into a separate 1.5 ml pyrogen-free tube in preparation for red blood cell (RBC) lysis. This is necessary to remove residual RBCs in the buffy coat layer.\n3. Recipe for Red Blood Cell (RBC) Lysis Buffer\nMake a 1 L solution of RBC lysis buffer.\nMake a 500 ml of Ammonium Chloride and 500 ml of Tris. Then mix to create a 1 L solution of RBC lysis buffer with a final concentration of 155 mM of Ammonium Chloride and 10 mM of Tris.\nBuffer the solution to a pH of 7.5. Store the RBC lysis buffer at +2 to +8 °C, and bring to RT immediately prior to use.\n4. RBC Lysis of Buffy Coat\nAdd 1 ml of RBC lysis buffer to the sterile pyrogen-free 1.5 ml tube containing the collected buffy coat.\nMix the contents of the tube by inverting multiple times. Incubate the mixed contents of the tube for 5 min at RT on the bench. Centrifuge the mixed contents for 5 min at 1,167 x g.\nAfter centrifugation, a whitish pellet will be obtained. Discard the reddish supernatant slowly and carefully into 10% bleach without any disruption to the pellet. If the pellet is not whitish, re-do steps 3.1 - 3.5. Increasing the incubation time in RBC lysis buffer to 10 - 15 min may also be helpful.\nSafely dispose the biological waste once decontamination of biological waste in 10% bleach is complete after 24 hr.\n5. Propagation in Cell Culture",
    "NOTE: Tumor cells are typically rapidly growing cells white blood cells that are abundant in the original mix of cells seeded into the dish. Following repeated change of medium, and subsequent passages of CTCs, all the white blood cells are removed and a relatively pure population of CTCs remains.\nAfter discarding the supernatant into 10% bleach, wash the whitish pellet in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at least once, and resuspend in complete culture medium for propagation in cell culture.\nOnce wash is completed, add 1 ml of complete BNL 1ME A.7R.1 culture medium (10% heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2mM L-Glutamine) to the pellet and resuspend the pellet in the culture medium.\nSeed the resuspended mix of cells into a cell culture dish. Incubate the cell culture dish at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with air and 5% CO2.\nChange the cell culture medium every two to three days. After five to seven days, CTCs will have adhered to the cell culture dish and started proliferating. These cells will remain viable beyond 25 passages and after repeated freezing and thawing cycles5.\n6. Verification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Circulating Tumor Cell Line\nPerform a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method, to amplify only one specific DNA segment of the mouse β-globin gene to confirm that the novel established CTC cell lines are mouse cells like the original implanted BNL 1ME A.7R.1 HCC line. Method was originally described and validated by Steube et al.5,8\nPerform immunostaining for the hepatocyte-specific marker cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 3 (CREB3L3) by using a specific antibody. This will confirm that novel established CTCs are indeed hepatocytes like the original implanted BNL 1ME A.7R.1 cell line.5\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
