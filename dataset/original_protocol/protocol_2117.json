    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProtein expression and purification—3 days\nThis first part of the protocol is an optimization of the pMAL™ Protein Fusion & Purification System protocol (NEB #E8200S). pMAL is one of the most used systems for the purification of fusion proteins. An advantage of this method is the fact that maltose-binding protein (MBP) binds to a positively charged resin at pH 5.5, where most other proteins do not bind. Moreover, the MBP-fusion protein can be purified in a one-step MBP affinity purification with high quality. This step is critical since the resultant purified protein will be used for the second step of this protocol.\nPre-culture\nTiming: 10 min; day 1\nNote: For this protocol we used the pDESTH1 vector (Ampicillin resistant).\nAdd 5 mL LB medium, 0.2% glucose, and 10 μL Ampicillin (stock 50 mg/ mL) to a culture tube.\nInoculate with a single bacterial colony from the agar plate (from day 0).\nCulture at 37°C and shake for 16 h.\nNote: The LB medium can be stored at 20°C–25°C for 1 month. 50% glucose can be stored at 4°C for 6 months and Ampicillin should be store at -20 for up to 6 months.\nProtein induction\nTiming: 5–6 h; day 2\nIn an Erlenmeyer flask, inoculate 500 mL of rich medium glucose (0.2%) and Ampicillin (100 μg/ mL) with 5 mL of a culture of cells grown for 16 h containing the fusion plasmid. Mix well and measure the starting OD of the culture.\nNote: The rich medium can be stored at 20°C–25°C for up to 1 month.\nNote: Glucose is necessary in the growth medium to repress the maltose genes on the chromosome of the E. coli host, one of which is an amylase that can degrade the amylose on the affinity resin.",
    "After 2 h, measure the optical density (OD) of the culture A600 ∼ 0.5 (2 × 108 cells/mL), add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM, and incubate the culture at 37°C for 3 h.\nNote: IPTG can be stored at −20°C in dark for up to 9 months.\nNote: The time and temperature until the OD of the culture reach an optical density of 0.5 can vary with the host strain and the stability of the protein.\nDivide the induced culture to two 500 mL polypropylene bottles (e.g., Beckman Coulter), centrifuge the culture at 4,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellets in 25 mL column buffer (500 mL of culture), and freeze the sample for 16 h at −20°C.\nCritical: To avoid degradation of the protein, add 0.1 mM PMSF (phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride) and protease inhibitor cocktail (1×). Harvest the cells quickly and keep them chilled.\nNote: PMSF can be stored at −20°C in dark; it should be stable for at least two years. The column buffer can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.\nPause point: The resuspended pellet can be stored at −20°C for up to one month.\nProtein purification\nTiming: 5–6 h; day 3\nThaw the sample in cold water.\nTransfer the sample to a 50 mL Nalgene centrifuge tube, place in an ice bath, and sonicate in short pulses of 15 s.\nNote: The sonication program parameters used were: amplitude: 37, process time: 2:00 min, pulse on: 0:15 s, pulse off: 0:15 s, temperature monitoring and shutdown: 115°C.\nNote: Keep the samples on ice to avoid degradation of the protein.",
    "Centrifuge the sample at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, keep the supernatant (crude extract), and dilute the crude extract 1:2 with column buffer (total = 50 mL).\nNote: It is important to add 0.1 mM of PMSF (phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride) and protease inhibitor cocktail (1×) to avoid degradation of the protein.\nTransfer 3 mL of amylose resin to a 1.5 × 12 cm polypropylene column.\nNote: The binding capacity of the amylose resin is 2–3 mg fusion protein/mL bed volume.\nWash the column five times with 15 mL column buffer.\nLoad the diluted crude extract at a flow rate of no more than 1.87 mL/min.\nNote: The flow rate should be 1.87 mL/minute for a 1.5 cm column ([50 × (1.5)2] mL/hour).\nWash the column with 36 mL of column buffer at a flow rate of no more than 3.75 mL/min.\nNote: The flow rate should be 3.75 mL/minute for a 1.5 cm column ([100 × (1.5)2] mL/hour).\nElute the fusion protein with column buffer + 10 mM maltose and collect 15 fractions of 500 μL each.\nNote: The elution buffer (column buffer + 10 mM maltose) should be prepared fresh.\nNote: The maltose solution can be stored at 4°C for 3 days; for long-term storage (6 months), stock solutions should be stored at −20°C. It is recommended that the maltose solution is prepared and used at the same day.\nRun 15 μL of each elution in an acrylamide gel and quantify using Bradford protein assay, the fractions containing the purified protein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1703-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Recombinant CPC-MBP fusion protein purification\nThe figure shows an example of protein purification using the protocol described here. Fractions were analyzed by SDS–PAGE (MW molecular weight markers). E; elution fractions.",
    "If the concentration is lower than desired, pool the protein-containing fractions and concentrate to about 1 mg/mL using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter unit.\nNote: The pore size of the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter should be selected according to the molecular weight of the purified protein.\nPerform a western blot using 5 μg of purified protein to check the quality. A representative western blot is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1703-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Immuno-detection of purified ZML2, ZML1-MBP, ZML2-MBP, and MBP proteins using purified antibodies raised against MBP\nTo validate the quality of the purified protein, three different dilutions (50, 40 and 30 ng) of two MBP fusion proteins (ZML1-MBP and ZML2-MBP) and MBP alone as a control were loaded in a gel and a western blot was performed using antibodies raised against MBP. The red arrows indicate the presence of the proteins. Adapted from Vélez-Bermúdez et al. (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nPause point: The purified protein can be stored for 1 day on ice at 4°C.\nAffinity purification of antibodies—2 days\nTiming: 10 min; day 4\nThis second part of the protocol is critical for a successful immunoprecipitation assay. Currently, different protocols for affinity purification of antibodies are available. Here, we offer an inexpensive and accurate method to obtain a pure and intact antibody for the IP experiment.\nTake 800 μg of the purified protein and run on an SDS-PAGE gel.\nNote: This protocol is an optimization of the protocol provided by Agrisera (https://www.agrisera.com/en/info/affinity-purification-of-antibodies-low-amount-of-antigen-available.html[href=https://www.agrisera.com/en/info/affinity-purification-of-antibodies-low-amount-of-antigen-available.html]).\nNote: We suggest using Nupage 4–12 Bis-Tris gel 1.5 mm × 10 wells (Invitrogen, NP0335B0X) and a run time of 38 min. The sample can be loaded into the lanes 1–8. Keep two lanes empty and use the last lane for the protein marker (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1703-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Purified protein is indicated by an arrow.\n(C) Membrane after removing the strip containing the protein of interest. The absence of the strip containing the purified protein is indicated by an arrow.\nNote: The BIO-RAD transfer buffer should be stored at 4°C before use for at least 30 min.\nNote: This protocol can be use when the amount of purified protein is at least 230 μg.\nTransfer the protein onto a membrane.\nNote: We use the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System. Standard SD protocol, 30 min, and up to 1.0 A; 25 V.\nStain the membrane with Ponceau S (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nLocate the size corresponding to your protein, cut out the band, and mark the protein side (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nDe-stain the strip with 1× PBS-Tween 0.1% and block with 5% BSA (fatty acid-free) in 10 mL 1× PBS for 1 h at 25°C.\nNote: PBS 1× can be stored at 20°C–25°C for up to 1 year. BSA should be prepared immediately before use and stored at 4°C.\nWash (by shaking) the strip 5 times with 10 mL 1× PBS-Tween 0.1%.\nIncubate the strip with the antibody serum for 16 h at 4°C.\nNote: Since in our case the specific antibody constitutes 1%–10% of the total antibody pool, we have used at least 5 mL of the antibody (if the concentration of the antibody is ∼1 mg/mL) and 1 mg of the antigen (purified protein).\nNote: 1 mg of purified protein can theoretically bind around 0.5–2 mg of the specific antibody.",
    "Note: Since the antibodies have been produced in rabbit, this step is required to obtain a clean antibody for the immunoprecipitation.\nRemove the serum.\nNote: We suggest storing the antibody at −20°C until validation of the purified antibody.\nWash the strip twice with 10 mL 1× PBS-Tween 0.1% during 5 min each time.\nWash the strip twice with 10 mL 1× PBS during 5 min each time.\nNote: Measure the last wash with 1× PBS spectrophotometrically at A280 to make sure that the optical density it is below 0.1.\nCollect 11 elutions of the purified antibody bound to the strip with 0.2 M glycine pH 2.6 in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1703_13.csv\nNote: The glycine solution can be stored at 20°C–25°C for up to one month.\nNote: 1 M Tris pH 8.0 buffer is used to neutralize the glycine.\nNote: Wash the strip 3 times with 1× PBS for 5 min each time and store samples at −20°C for further use.\nStore the elutions at −20°C until use.\nPause point: The purified antibody can be stored at −20°C for 1 month or at −80°C for up to 2 years.\nPerform a western blot using recombinant protein and total plant protein extract to verify the quality of the different fractions of the purified antibody (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1703-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Immuno-detection of ZmZML2 using the purified antibody raised against this protein",
    "(Left) Immunoblot using three different dilutions of the purified recombinant proteins ZML1-MBP, ZML2-MBP, and MBP (50, 40 and 30 ng). The membrane was hybridized with an antibody raised against ZmZML2, and a band of 80 KDa corresponding to the ZML2-MBP was detected. (Right) Western blot analysis using 50 μg of total protein extract from leaves of 9-day-old maize B73 plants hybridized with the purified antibody raised against ZmZML2. The native ZML2 is detected at 28 kDa. Adapted from Vélez-Bermúdez et al. (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nImmunoprecipitation of protein complexes—2 days\nTiming: 10 min; day 6\nImmunoprecipitation is one of the most widely used methods for studying protein-protein interactions. Here, an antibody against a specific target protein is used to detect an immune complex with that target under a particular condition. This part of the protocol details the associated procedures of co-immunoprecipitation and considerations associated with this experiment. The use of a clean and specific secondary antibody is critical for the successful detection of a specific putative partner through western blot analysis.\nAntibody coupling\nResuspend the Dynabeads protein A in a vial.\nNote: Do not vortex the Dynabeads, mix gently by hand.\nTransfer 50 μL (1.5 mg) of Dynabeads protein A into a 2 mL low-binding protein Eppendorf tube for each immunoprecipitation (antibody), place on the magnet and discard the supernatant.\nWash the Dynabeads three times with 200 μL 1× PBS+1 mM PMSF.\nNote: The washing buffer for Dynabeads should be prepared immediately before use and stored at 4°C until use.\nNote: During the IP protocol, the Dynabeads should be washed by turning the Eppendorf tubes 4 full turns without removing the tube from the magnet. Discard the supernatant each time, it is important to avoid that the Dynabeads dry out.",
    "Note: We suggest using low-binding protein Eppendorf tubes for all the steps involving Dynabeads.\nIncubate the Dynabeads with the purified antibodies for 16 h at 60 rpm rotation at 4°C.\nNote: The final volume (antibody + 1× PBS + 1 mM PMSF) should be 200 μL per 50 μL of Dynabeads.\nNote: 50 μL of Dynabeads correspond to 1.5 Ab/mg beads for IgG.\nNote: For an efficient immunoprecipitation the amount of purified antibody is typically between 5 to 7 μg/mL of Dynabeads.\nCell lysate and Co-IP\nTiming: 10 min; day 7\nGrind 1 g plant material in liquid nitrogen in a pre-chilled mortal to a fine powder, resuspend in 500 μL extraction buffer A or B, and incubate in ice during 30 min with 5 min vortex every 5 min.\nCritical: The extraction buffer (Option A) is supplied in the Dynabeads™ Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit (Invitrogen). In case of selecting this buffer, continue the process using the buffers included in the kit.\nNote: The extraction buffer (Option A) should be prepared immediately before use and stored at 4°C. IP buffer (Invitrogen Co-IP kit, 10×) can be stored at 20°C–25°C according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NaCl can be stored at 20°C–25°C for up to 28 days. DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) can be stored at 4°C for 1 year or indefinitely at −20°C in dark conditions. MG132 can be stored at −20°C for up to 1 year. cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets should be stored dry at 4°C; stock solutions can be stored at 4°C for 1–2 weeks or at −20°C for at least 12 weeks. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride can be stored at −20°C for at least two years.",
    "Note: The extraction buffer B is described in Abraham-Juárez (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. Buffer B is suitable for proteins that are dynamically transported between nucleus and cytosol in native conditions, and can be used as an alternative to the kit. If your protein has another subcellular localization or some specific conditions, the buffer should be optimized for this purpose.\nNote: The extraction buffer (Option B) should be prepared immediately before use and stored at 4°C. Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Stock 1 M) may be stored at 2°C–8°C for at least 1 year. NaCl can be stored at 20°C–25°C for up to 28 days. IGEPAL-CA-630 can be stored at 8°C–25°C in a cool and dry area for up to 5 years. MG132 can be stored at −20°C for up to 1 year.\nCritical: Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic that expands 695 times in volume when it vaporizes, has no warning properties such as odor or color, and may cause asphyxiation hazards. Use protective clothing and handle in well-ventilated areas.\nCentrifuge at 11,200 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nCollect the supernatant and transfer to a fresh Eppendorf tube.\nQuantify the total protein from the lysate using a protein assay.\nNote: We use the Pierce 660 nm protein assay (Thermo Fisher).\nWash twice the Dynabeads-Ab complex with 1× PBS + 1 mM of PMSF during 5 min each time at 4°C.\nIncubate the Dynabeads-Ab complex with 500 μL (1.5 mg) of the lysate for 3 h at 4°C in rotation. Keep 100 μL of the lysate for the input.\nNote: Depending on the stability and abundance of the protein complex of interest, you can use 1–20 mg of total protein extract.",
    "Note: The incubation time for the Dynabeads-Ab complex + lysate depends on the antibody. For purified antibodies, we suggest to incubate 3 h, commercial antibodies should be incubated for 1 h to avoid background.\nWash the Dynabeads-Ab complex three times with 200 μL washing buffer 1 for 5 min each time at 4°C.\nWash the Dynabeads-Ab-Ag complex once with 200 μL washing buffer 2 in rotation at 30 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Washing buffers 1 and 2 should be prepared immediately before use and stored at 4°C.\nPlace the Dynabeads-Ab-Ag complex on the magnet and discard the supernatant, immediately resuspend in 35 μL 1.5× sample buffer, and boil at 95°C for 5 min.\nNote: 1.5× Sample buffer can be stored at 4°C for at least 1 year. Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (Stock 1 M) can be stored at 2°C–8°C for at least 1 year. 2-mercaptoethanol (14.3 M) can be stored at 2°C–8°C for at least 3 years. Glycerol 50% can be stored at −20°C for 2 weeks or indefinitely at −80°C.\nStore stock solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (10% w/v) at 25°C for use with a recommended minimum shelf life of 3 years. Bromophenol Blue sodium salt can be stored at 20°C–25°C for up to 2 years.\nPlace the Dynabeads-Ab-Ag complex on the magnet and recover the supernatant in a fresh Eppendorf tube.\nNote: You can collect a second elution of 30 μL and recover in another Eppendorf tube (do not mix elutions).\nUse the first elution (35 μL) for western blot or mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1703-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "The presence of ZML2 and MYB11 was detected by immunoblot analyses using ZML2 and MYB11 antibodies. Input extracts from 9-d-old maize leaves were immunoprecipitated with MYB11 antibody, and ZML2 was detected by immunoblot. The presence of MYB11 in the immunoprecipitated samples was detected as a control. Adapted from Vélez-Bermúdez et al. (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −80°C until immunoblotting or mass spectrometry analysis.\nNote: Keep 100 μL of lysis sample to use as a control for the experiment.\nNote: To avoid background during western blot analysis, we suggest using Clean-Blot™ IP detection reagent (HRP), Thermo Scientific, cat# 21230 for polyclonal antibodies.\nNote: For mass spectrometry analysis, you can also make the digestion directly in the beads."
