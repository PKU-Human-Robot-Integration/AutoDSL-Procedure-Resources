    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: 1–2 h culturing and passaging of Vero CCL-81 cells\nTiming: 1–2 h for passage of Vero CCL-81 cells\nCulturing and passaging of Vero CCL-81 cells\nThaw cryopreserved vial of Vero cells by gently swirling in 37°C water bath until few ice crystals are present; do not submerge the cap. Wipe the vial with 70% ethanol and place it into the biosafety cabinet.\nCritical: The water bath should be regularly calibrated for accurate temperature. Inappropriate temperature regulation may decrease cell viability. Mix 1 part of 0.4% trypan blue and 1 part cell suspension, load them onto cell counting chamber slide and insert the slide into counting chamber.\nGently transfer the cells to a new 15 mL conical tube and add 9 mL of warmed growth medium, dropwise, to the cells. Mix gently.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C (using the full brake setting).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 5 mL of warmed growth medium. Transfer to a new T-25 cm2 flask.\nGrow cells to 70%–80% confluency in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nPassage of Vero CCL-81 cells.\nMonitor cells until they reach 80%–90% confluency.\nAspirate growth medium from the flask and discard.\nWash cell layer with trypsin to remove residual growth medium (coat surface then immediately aspirate and discard).\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the flask to cover the cells and place at 37°C for 3–5 min (or until cells detach when viewed by bright-field microscopy).\nCritical: Use fresh cells at 80%–90% confluency. Do not over-incubate cells with trypsin.\nAdd warmed growth medium (10% FBS DMEM) to dilute the original trypsin volume at least five-fold.",
    "Critical: For T-225 flasks, add ∼10 mL of growth medium, then complete steps in (f). After the cells have been resuspended, add the remaining growth medium to ensure a five-fold dilution of trypsin.\nRinse flask surface to ensure all trypsin is deactivated.\nResuspend cells by gently aspirating and dispensing against the side of the flask.\nCount the number of cells per volume in the cell suspension.\nSeed flasks at minimum 0.4 × 104 cells/cm2 (∼2–3 day passage) with fresh warmed 10% FBS DMEM.\nFor RTCA plate seeding: Count the cell suspension and perform the following calculations:\nUse the viable cell density to calculate the total viable cells in the cell suspension (viable cell density ∗ volume = total cells viable).\nPrepare cells at a density of 0.3–0.35 × 106 cells/mL (which translates to ∼18,000 cells/50 μL) and add 50 μL/well to the plate.\nCritical: Use fresh cells at 80%–90% confluency. Seeding the plate at the proper cell density is essential. Using too many cells, cells at excess density, or cells that are excessively passaged could result in experimental artifacts. Also, use 2% FBS containing DMEM for assay.\nMonoclonal antibody, serum or plasma neutralization experiment on xCELLigence:\nTo start an experiment, open instrument software, select a cradle, go to the first tab labeled as “Experiment” and label the experiment to save in the desired location.\nIn the “Layout” tab, prepare the scheme of the experiment as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1633-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental design for running a neutralization assay using RTCA",
    "(A) Plate design for 96-plate layout for assessing mAb neutralization potency. Columns 1–6 highlighted wells are for the mAbs being assessed, columns 7–9 boxed wells are for a negative control mAb, columns 10–11 boxed wells for positive control mAb, pink boxed wells for virus-only control and purple boxed wells are for the cells-only control. It is important to include all controls in the plate so that the results can be interpreted properly.\n(B) Graphic of representative results after analyzing data using neutralizing mAbs associated with lack of neutralization (full cytopathic effect [CPE] shown in the pink line), intermediate neutralization indicated by partial CPE (orange line) or lack of neutralization associated with no CPE (purple line).\nIn the “Schedule” tab, add three steps using the ‘Add Step’ button or by right-clicking.\nThe first step is to read the background with the medium only.\nThe second step is for cellular adherence (plating cells and allowing them to create a monolayer).\nThe third step is for measuring the impedance after virus addition.\nCritical: Always add extra time to this step. If the experiment reaches the end of the set hours, the machine will stop, causing a gap in readings.\nUnwrap 96 well E-Plate in a biosafety cabinet, while avoiding touching the contact pads (gold-colored) on the bottom of the plate.\nCritical: Fouling of the contact pads with residue from gloves could affect performance and data readout.\nAdd 50 μL of warmed 2% FBS DMEM to each well and tap gently on the sides to avoid bubbles.\nGently place the plate into the cradle, ensure the plate position A1 is located as indicated and check for any errors in the Messages tab.\nCritical: Ensure the message reads “Plate scanned. Connections okay”. If an error is obtained, take the plate out and reseat it.",
    "Measure the background of the medium alone.\nCritical: Background readings for all wells should read between -0.063 and 0.063. Avoid bubbles that may appear after addition the medium to obtain correct background readings.\nOnce background reading is recorded, remove the plate from the cradle. Return it to the biosafety cabinet and add 50 μL of cell suspension (∼0.3–0.36 × 106 cells/mL) to each well.\nCritical: If using multiple plates, mark each plate to ensure placement back onto the same cradle used to measure the background reading.\nAfter seeding the cells, incubate plates with covers at 20°C–25°C in the biosafety cabinet for 30 min.\nCritical: Incubation is necessary to avoid edge effects and ensures uniform seeding.\nGently place each plate back into its cradle and ensure A1 is located as indicated on the cradle.\nEnsure there are no error messages. Instrument report should read “Plate scanned. Connections okay”.\nCritical: If any wells do not have a good connection, open the cradle and reseat the plate.\nIn the Schedule tab, select the second step to restart the reading. Monitor the sensograms on the “Plot” tab until cells reach a plateau which usually takes 12–16 h.\nCritical: Before running the actual assay, it is recommended that a titration of the virus be done to establish the dilution of the virus stock suitable for the assay. We found 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (Case et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) is suitable for the applications we describe in this protocol. Start by calculating the volumes/concentrations/dilution of the antibody and virus required for executing the experiment. The Table below shows a serial dilution of an antibody to obtain half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) estimates or dose-response curves.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1633_1.csv",
    "Perform virus + antibody or serum/plasma incubation steps. The Table below provides volumes and incubation time of heat-inactivated serum/plasma or mAb + virus mixture for neutralization.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1633_2.csv\nWhen ready, go to the “Schedule” tab, select the current step and press the pause button. Press the lock/unlock button. Remove the plates from the cradle and place them in BSC.\nAdd 100 μL of serum, plasma or mAb + virus (or reagent to be tested) to the wells.\nCritical: Avoid any agitation to the cell monolayer.\nWhere possible, include serum-, plasma- or mAb-only, virus-only, and cell-only controls on each plate.\nCritical: Always include positive and negative controls such that positive control neutralizes the virus and does not cause CPE and vice versa for negative control.\nGently place the plates back into their cradles, ensure there are no error messages, and plates should read ‘Plate scanned. Connections okay.’\nCritical: Ensure A1 is located as indicated. Open the cradle and reseat the plate in case of any errors.\nRestart the experiment by initiating step three. Curves will stabilize once the temperature of the incubator returns to 37°C.\nChange the axis to ‘Normalized Cell Index’ and move the cursor to the left side of the line at the point where cells reached a plateau prior to infection.\nMonitor the curves for any changes due to virus infection. Typically, it takes 24–36 h to observe full CPE caused by the virus (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B for example curves of full CPE (pink line), partial CPE (orange line), or no CPE (purple line).\nAt the end of the run, pause the step, unlock the instrument, and remove the plate(s), and electronically release the plates via the file menu.",
    "Analyze data by normalizing the cellular index (CI) values at the endpoint (48 h after incubation with the virus) using the RTCA software (Agilent Technologies).\nResults are expressed as percent neutralization in the presence of respective mAb relative to control wells with no CPE minus CI values from control wells with maximum CPE at the assay endpoint.\nNote: Endpoint can be defined by both time and CPE caused by virus, we in this assay defined endpoint to be where we see complete CPE between 36–40 h after virus addition. Endpoint can vary from virus to virus due to the level at which it causes CPE.\nRTCA IC50 values are determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for representative mAb neutralization curves are calculated using nonlinear fit with variable slope analysis (Gilchuk et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1633-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization curves of mAbs using RTCA\nRepresentative rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization curves for COV2-2489, COV2-2196, COV2-2676 or negative control antibody rDENV-2D22. Error bars indicate mean ± SD for 3 technical replicates.\nGenerating and identifying antibody escape variant viruses:\nTo generate escape mutant virus, repeat steps 2a, and steps 3a through 3t and monitor for the escape of virus.\nCritical: It is important to mix the virus with a saturating neutralizing concentration of the antibody being evaluated.\nNote: For escape mutant virus generation we used 10-fold excess virus (i.e., MOI:1) from the regular neutralization assay. Here in for escape selection experiment we used one concentration of antibody (i.e., 50 μg/mL for COV2-2489 and 10 μg/mL for COV2-2676) unlike, for IC50 calculation or neutralization experiment.\nThe escape variants are identified by delayed CPE in wells containing antibody, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1633-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Confirmation of the antibody escape phenotype for variants previously selected in the presence of a neutralizing mAb",
    "(A) RTCA sensogram for neutralization of parental virus by mAb COV2-2489 (blue), COV2-2489 escape virus (pink), cells + virus, i.e., the no-mAb control (red) or cells-only control (green).\n(B) RTCA sensogram for neutralization of previously selected variant viruses that had replicated in the presence of COV2-2489 or COV2-2676. The COV2-2196 control mAb neutralized all variants (blue) but mAbs for which the virus variants were previously selected to escape did not neutralize (COV2-2489; red), COV2-2676; green). The pink curves show CPE caused by escape virus only (the no-mAb control).\nCritical: It is essential to differentiate between CPE caused by the virus only and delayed CPE caused in the presence of antibody to identify escape virus.\nTo verify escaped viruses, isolated viruses are re-assessed in a subsequent RTCA experiment in the presence of 5 μg/mL of a distinct mAb that also neutralizes the virus, see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B.\nCritical: Validation of escape virus in the presence of a higher concentration (2-fold higher than saturating neutralizing concentration) of the corresponding mAb is critical.\nTo identify mutations that cause escape, escaped viruses are isolated after RTCA-based escape screening and propagated in 6-well culture plates with confluent Vero CCl-81 cells in the presence of 10 μg/mL of the corresponding mAb.\nCritical: Propagation of escaped virus and making stocks of escaped virus is important to isolate viral RNA.\nIsolate viral RNA according to QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) instructions from aliquots of supernatant containing a suspension of the selected virus population.\nCritical: Proper yields of RNA are required to get adequate amplification.\nPipet 560 μL of prepared Buffer AVL containing carrier RNA into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 140 μL supernatant to the Buffer AVL–carrier RNA in the microcentrifuge tube. Mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.",
    "Briefly centrifuge the tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid.\nAdd 560 μL 100% ethanol to the sample.\nMix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. After mixing briefly, centrifuge the tube to remove drops inside the lid.\nCarefully apply 630 μL of the solution from step 5 to the QIAamp Mini column (in a 2 mL collection tube).\nClose the cap, and centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min.\nDiscard the collection tube and repeat steps i and m to apply the rest of the solution.\nCarefully open the QIAamp Mini column and add 500 μL Buffer AW1.\nClose the cap, and centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min. Place the QIAamp Mini column in a clean 2 mL collection tube and discard the tube containing the filtrate.\nCarefully open the QIAamp Mini column and add 500 μL Buffer AW2.\nClose the cap and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 × g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min.\nDiscard collection tube and spin column again at full speed for 1 min to remove any residual buffer.\nPlace the QIAamp Mini column in a clean 1.5 mL Lobind microcentrifuge tube.\nDiscard the old collection tube containing the filtrate.\nCarefully open the QIAamp Mini column and add 40 μL Buffer AVE equilibrated to 20°C–25°C.\nClose the cap, and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min. Store RNA samples in a clean labeled 1.5 mL Lobind microcentrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific, catalog no 13-698-791) at −80°C.\nPause point: Extracted viral RNA can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 year.\nTo amplify spike protein gene cDNA, use SuperScript IV One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using primers flanking the virus gene encoding spike protein.",
    "Critical: Before Sanger DNA sequence analysis, confirming the amplification is recommended. Add SPRI beads to each reaction at a 1:1 ratio.\nPrepare 50-μL PCR reactions according to the instructions of the SuperScript IV One-Step RT-PCR kit.

Add SPRI beads to each reaction at a 1:1 ratio.\n50 μL for a 50 μL reaction.\nMix 15 times with a pipette.\nAdd tubes to magnetic PCR tube holder and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Do not remove tubes from the magnet and carefully remove the supernatant from tubes.\nWash with 200 μL 80% ethanol.\nDilute ethanol in nuclease-free water.\nDo not mix, rather, pipette ethanol over beads while still on the magnet and remove supernatant, leaving beads undisturbed.\nRepeat step ad.\nQuick spin tubes and put them back in the magnetic holder.\nRemove any residual ethanol from tubes.\nLet beads air dry on the magnet for 2 min.\nRemove from the magnet and resuspend beads in 50 μL of elution buffer.\nAdd tubes back to the magnet and incubate for 2 min.\nRemove supernatant and place in clean, labeled 1.5 mL Lobind microcentrifuge tube and store at −20°C.\nPause point: Purified PCR products can be stored at 4°C for several days or −20°C for months.\nAnalyze cDNA on 0.8% agarose gel to verify successful amplification, purity, and size before sequencing.",
    "Mix 1 μL of purified PCR sample with 10 μL loading dye supplied by Agilent.\nSimilarly, mix 1 μL of standard provided with 10 μL loading dye.\nShake before loading samples to mix. Analyze the results. Usually, PCR will yield a single DNA band with a size of 4 kilobases.\nAfter obtaining the sequencing results, analyze the sequences by aligning to the wild-type virus sequence using appropriate software to identify the sequence changes in the variants.\nNote: The inclusion of both positive (COV2-2196) and negative controls (rDENV-2D222) is critical in calculating the percentage of neutralization in the assay. An optimal negative control is vital for assay success for novel targets lacking a clear positive control. An mAb that recognizes an unrelated target antigen can be used as a negative control."
