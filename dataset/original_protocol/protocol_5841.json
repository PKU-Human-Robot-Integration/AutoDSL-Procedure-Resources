    "Cartridge preparationSterilization of Reservoir Cap/Bottle AssemblyInsert a 33 ml reservoir cap into the 125 ml bottle. Fit screw cap loosely. Attach fresh reservoir cap tube (non-sterile), included with the cartridge, to the cap.Loosely wrap the Luer fittings on the end of the reservoir cap tubing with foil. Place entire assembly into an autoclave bag and seal.Autoclave at 121 °C, 15 lb/in2 for 20 min (High Vacuum).Connection of the reservoir cap to the Flow PathRemove Fibercell module from its packaging. Check the Luer fittings between the hollow fiber module and the flow path to ensure that they are finger tight.Remove the foil from one of the Luer fittings on the reservoir cap.Choose one of the Luer fittings on the flow path. Spray with 70% ethanol and wipe with an alcohol pad.Remove the Luer cap from the Luer fitting and attach the Luer fitting to the 33 ml reservoir cap. Apply ½ turn counter rotation to the tubing prior to attachment to prevent kinking of the tubing.Repeat steps to attach the other Luer fitting.Check fitting and be sure they are tightly attached.Pre-cultureWhen working with adherent cells, the cartridge should be washed with 2-volumes of 125 ml of sterile PBS each for 24 h prior to filling the cartridge with 125 ml of cell culture medium.Ensure the left and right end port side clamps are open. Aseptically fill 100 ml of sterile PBS into 125 ml bottle attach to cartridge using the 33 mm caps (The flow path and cartridge for medium cartridge holds about 30 ml of media). Use thumb and forefinger to manually prime the pump until air is pushed out of the tubing then close the left and right end port side clamps.",
    "Fill a sterile 60 ml syringe with 30 ml sterile PBS and attach to the left extra-capillary space (ECS) port and attach an empty 60 ml syringe to the right ECS port. Open the clamps on the left and right ECS side ports and push the sterile PBS into the ECS. Tilt cartridge upwards and fill medium taking care to remove all air present in the ECS. If the volume is not sufficient, repeat.Close the left and right ECS side ports, spray with 70% alcohol and remove the syringes, spray with 70% alcohol and wipe with an alcohol pad prior to attaching clean sterile 3 ml syringes to the ports. Open the left and right side port clamps.Connect the Fibercell hollow fiber module to the Fibercell pump unit in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. Set a medium flow rate of 5, leave for 24 h. After 24 h, the left and right end port clamps are closed and the PBS reservoir bottle is aseptically changed for a fresh 125 ml bottle containing 100 ml of sterile PBS and returned to the incubator for 24 h. Aseptically fill a sterile 125 ml reservoir bottle with 100 ml of MEM media. Leave the reservoir cap loose by ½ turn.Fill a sterile 60 ml syringe with 30 ml sterile MEM and attach to the left ECS port and attach an empty 60 ml syringe to the right ECS port. Open the clamps on the left and right ECS side ports and push the sterile MEM into the ECS. Tilt cartridge upwards and fill medium taking care to remove all air present in the ECS. If the volume is not sufficient, repeat.",
    "Close the left and right ECS side ports, spray with 70% alcohol and remove the syringes, spray with 70% alcohol and wipe with an alcohol pad prior to attaching clean sterile 3 ml syringes to the ports. Open the left and right side port clamps.Connect the Fibercell hollow fiber module to the Fibercell pump unit in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Set a medium flow rate of 5 and leave overnight.Repeat Steps B8-B12 using MEM plus 10% horse serum.Inoculating Cells into the ECS (refer to Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Procedure for loading either host cells or C. parvum into the HFB Close the left and right end port slide clamps.HCT-8 monolayers are trypsinized using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%), phenol red, washed with MEM and resuspended 1 x 106 in a total volume of 5 ml of ICS mix (see Recipe 2), and placed into a trough.Spray the left side port Luer connection with 70% ethanol and wipe with an alcohol pad. Remove syringes with an alcohol pad.Draw up cells using a 10 ml syringe with a blunt end needle.Following same aseptic procedure attach an empty syringe to the right side port Luer fitting.If closed, open the side port clamps.Gently flush the cell suspension through the ECS back and forth between the 2 syringes 3-5 times. This ensures distribution of the cells.Loosen the reservoir cap ½ turn.Leave the left end port slide clamp closed. Open the right-hand end port slide clamp. This will allow excess medium to flow into the reservoir bottle. Close the right side port slide clamp.Gently depress the plunger of the syringe attached to the left side port until all the medium and cells have been forced into the ECS.Close the left side port slide clamp and open the right side port slide clamp.",
    "Gently depress the plunger of the syringe attached to the right side port until all the medium and cells have been forced into the ECS.Close the side port slide clamps. Replace the syringes with new sterile syringes.Tighten the reservoir cap.Open the left end port slide clamp. Place the cartridge into the Fibercell pump inside a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and set flow rate to 5. After 3 days, increase the flow rate to 10.Addition of C. parvum oocystsFresh MEM plus 10% HS is replaced daily. The pH and glucose concentration of the 48 h and fresh medium are monitored in the ECS using an Accumet® pH meter and an Accutrend Plus® glucose meter. When the glucose drops by 50% in 24 h, the ECS is seeded with 1 x 105 C. parvum oocysts that have been treated with 10% Chlorox®, washed 7x each with 30 ml sterile distilled water and suspended in 10 ml of MEM containing the supplements shown in Recipe 1 (ECS mix). The intra-capillary space (ICS) medium is replaced with that shown in Recipe 2 (ICS mix).Remove the unit to a sterile hood and slide the L and R end port clamps to closed. Spray the left and right ECS ports with 70% alcohol using an alcohol pad and remove the syringe from the left ECS port.Attach the syringe containing the 10 ml of C. parvum oocysts suspended in the ECS mix to the left ECS port. Attach a clean sterile 10 ml syringe to the right ECS port.Open the slide clamps to the left and right ECS ports. Push down on the syringe attached to the left port (containing C. parvum oocysts), gently pull up on the right syringe.",
    "When the left syringe is fully depressed, push down on the right syringe to mix the contents of the ECS. Repeat the procedure (Steps 5 and 6) 3-4 times end up with both the left and right syringe approximately 50% full (5 ml in each).Close the right ECS port clamp, open the right end port slide clamp. Push down on the syringe attached to left ECS port until the contents have been added to the ECS (Take care not to add air to the cartridge). Slide the left ECS port clamp closed. Open the right ECS slide clamp and push down on the syringe until the contents of the syringe attached to this port have been added (Take care not to add air to the cartridge). Slide the right ECS port clamp closed. When inoculating the cartridge initially the user should experience minimal backpressure, after several months (> 6 months) of continuous culture an increase in backpressure can be experienced presumably due to build-up of the host-cell layer and debris from sloughed cells. When using the 3 ml ECS cartridge after a year of continuous culture, the backpressure is significant and it is not recommended for studies beyond this point. The 20 ml ECS cartridge was maintained for over 2 years without encountering this problem and is the cartridge of choice for long-term studies.Slide the left end port clamp to open. Spray the left and right ECS ports with 70% alcohol and use an alcohol pad to remove the syringes and replace with clean, sterile 10 ml syringes.Ensure both left and right end port clamps are closed and replace the reservoir bottle with 125 ml of the complete ICS medium mix (Recipe 2). Open both left and right end ports and return the cartridge to the pump.",
    "Set the flow rate to 10.The pH and glucose in the ICS medium are monitored daily, by removing 5 ml directly from the reservoir bottle. When the glucose concentration falls from 360 mg/dl to approx. 200 mg/dl in 24 h, change the reservoir for a 500 ml bottle of the complete ICS medium mix, containing 460 mg/dl of glucose. Continue to monitor the pH and glucose, and when the glucose concentration falls to 50% (200-230 mg/dl) in 24 h, change the reservoir for a 1 L bottle of the complete ICS medium mix, containing 500 mg/dl glucose. The pH and glucose are monitored every 48 h for the duration of the culture as an indicator of the integrity of the host cell layer.Analysis of C. parvum growth by changes in Cp18S-rRNA RNA Preparation: Centrifuge a 50 μl sample, discard the supernatant and add 100 μl of iScript Buffer (lysis buffer).Freeze/thaw 6x by immersing in liquid nitrogen for 1 min followed by rapid thaw at 70 °C for 1.5 min.Centrifuge the lysate for 5 min at 16,162 x g (14,800 rpm). Carefully transfer the supernatant using a 200 μl pipette (DO NOT TOUCH THE PELLET) to a clean tube.Add 1 volume of 70% ethanol to the lysate, and mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge. Transfer up to 700 μl of the sample, including any precipitate, to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8,000 x g (10,412 rpm). Discard flow through.Add 350 μl of Buffer RW1 to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8,000 x g (10,412 rpm).Add 10 μl DNase I stock solution to 70 μl buffer RDD. Mix gently by inverting the tube. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8,000 x g (10,412 rpm).",

Centrifuge for 1 min at 8,000 x g (10,412 rpm) to elute the RNA. Label tubes with sample description, date, and amount of water added.Either quantitate RNA immediately or store samples at -80 °C.RNA is quantitated using the broad range Qubit RNA assay kit using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Enumerate C. parvum by quantitating Cp18S-rRNA in HFB samples and compare it to a standard prepared using 106, 107 and 108 C. parvum oocysts. Carry out the procedure using 5 ng of RNA with Luna Universal One-Step® RT-qPCR kit (NEB E3005) employing C. parvum 18S-rRNA primers: (Cp18S-995F: 5’-TAGAGATTGGAGGTTCCT-3’ and Cp18S-1206R: 5’-CTCCACCAACTAAGAACGCC-3’) and compare it to human 18S-rRNA primers: (Hs18S-F1373: 5’-CCGATAACGAACGAGACACTCTGG-3’ and Hs18S-R1561: 5’-TAGGGTAGGCACACGCTGAGCC-3’). Perform the procedure according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a Quant Studio 6 Flex 44. The HFB reproducibly produces 5 x 107 to 108 oocysts per ml after 2 weeks of culture, and this is maintained if not more than 50% of the ECS volume is sampled every 7-10 days. Sampling 90% of the cartridge volume at one time resulted in 4-week recovery time to obtain 108 oocysts per ml.",
    "Stain oocysts with Crypt-o-Glo® according to the manufacturer’s instructions and evaluate using a NikonTM Optiphot fluorescence microscope.Stain motile stages with Spor-a-Glo® according to the manufacturer’s instructions and evaluate using a NikonTM Optiphot fluorescence microscope.Tips to aid reproducibilityKeep the inlet and outlet lines to the reservoir bottle behind the line used to prime the pump, this prevents kinking of the lines and reduces the chance of contamination when handling the cartridge.Use an alcohol pad to wrap around fittings when changing the syringes prevents contamination.If the glucose concentration of the reservoir bottle does not drop significantly after 48 h, replenish the host cells by adding 106 HCT-8 cells to the extra-capillary space.To achieve the consistent growth of C. parvum, it is important to maintain a low redox balance of the extra-capillary medium. Note: To achieve this, we prepared the redox mix using sterile distilled water that is boiled and purged with 0.4 μm filtered N2 gas. When cooled to ambient temperature, thiols are dissolved under an N2 atmosphere. Removal of 50% (10 ml) of the culture is possible by displacing the extra-capillary medium with an equal volume of fresh ECS medium. When displacing the cells depress the syringe gently (10 sec with a 10 ml syringe) so as not to cause turbulence. It is advised that the culture not be disturbed for 10-14 days post-sampling to enable repopulation of the culture."
