    "Total Protein extraction from plant tissuesHarvest tissue in liquid nitrogen. If not used immediately, keep at -80 °C until processing.Grind tissue in liquid nitrogen and weigh out 0.5 g of the ground tissues in empty falcon tube that has been pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen and used to tare the scale.Add 6 ml of ice cold protein extraction buffer to ground tissues on ice.Vortex at room temperature to mix thoroughly.Filter homogenized tissue through four layers of cheese cloth andtransfer filtrate (flow through) to 2 ml-microcentrifuge tubes, on ice.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 45 min at 4 °C and transfer supernatant to new tubes on ice.Use supernatant to estimate protein concentration and to measure glycolate oxidase activity.Protein estimation using Bradford microassay (160 μl)Prepare BSA standards ranging from 5 μg-25 μg/ml as follows.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230605/20230605011901_6278.jpgUse 96 well microtiter plate to estimate protein content.Prepare blank by160 μl of water to one well in triplicates.Prepare test samplesby adding 2 μl of supernatant (from section 1) to 158 μl of water.Add 40 μl of Bradford Assay reagent to BSA standards, blank and test samples.Mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min and read absorbance at 595 nm (A595) on plate reader spectrophotometer.Note: If spectrophotometer does not include a software to generate standard curve to automatically estimate protein content, generate a BSA standard curve by plotting known protein concentration (X-axis) vs. Absorbance (in Y-axis). Protein concentration for a given unknown sample is estimated by plotting the A595 absorbance of the unknown (in the y-axis)and determining the intersection point with the BSA standard curve and then find the concentration associated with that particular point (in the x-axis). If using excel, after plotting concentration vsA595, obtain the trendline and use the equation for the line and the A595 of the unknown to resolve the unknown concentration.",
    "Glycolate oxidase activity assayPrepare blank by adding 10 μl of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3), to 250 μl of glycolate oxidase assay bufferin 96 well microtiter plate.Prepare test samples by adding 10 μl of supernatant (from section 1) to 250 μl of glycolate oxidase assay buffer.Read blank and samples at 440 nm for 0 min and then at 20 min intervals for one hour or until saturation point reached, on plate reader spectrophotometer.Calculate the generation of O-dianisidine radical using the following formula:(ΔA440nm/min test-ΔA440nm/min blank))/ (11.60) (0.04)ΔA440nm/mintest =A440 (sample X) at saturation point - A440 (sample X) at 0 minΔA440nm/min blank = A440nm (blank) at saturation point - A440nm (blank) at 0 minWhere11.60 =extinction coefficient for O-dianisidine. (Macheroux et al, 1991)0.04= dilution factor (10 μl/250 μl)To calculate specific activity, divide the value obtained in equation by the amount of protein present in the sample (converted to mg/ml)."
