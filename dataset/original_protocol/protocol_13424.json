    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). The study protocol was approved by and in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Fu-Jen Catholic University.\n1. Preparation before surgery\nPreparation of saline wet cotton balls\n\t\nPut on a surgical mask and gloves.\nPinch off a small portion of sterile cotton and roll it to form a ball. Repeat this procedure.\nDip the cotton balls in sterile 0.9% saline and squeeze out excess saline.\nStore the cotton balls in a clean box sterilized with 75% ethanol.\nPreparation of holding hooks.\n\t\nPut on a surgical mask and gloves.\nSterilize clips and rubber bands with 75% ethanol.\nBend the clips into the shape of a hook for the chest wall and tissue.\nConnect the bent clips with one, two, or three rubber bands to ensure the tension from the wound of the surgical window is wide enough for LAD ligation.\nPrepare and store at least five homemade hooks in a clean box sterilized with 75% ethanol.\nPreparation of a ligation loop.\n\t\nPlace the middle of a 7-0 silk stitch in the 1/2 circle size 3 spring eye of a tapered nonswaged surgical needle.\nPreparation of a snare loop controller\n\t\nCut a 5-mm polyethylene (PE)-10 tube using scissors.\nHeat and soften the tube under flame to smooth both of its edges.\nPreparing the rats\n\t\nSelect 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats with a minimum weight of 250 g.\nHouse and maintain the rats under a 12 h light/dark cycle at a controlled temperature (21 °C ± 2 °C) with free access to food, standard mouse pellets, and tap water.",
    "Anesthetize the rats with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally).\n\t\tNOTE: Additional anesthetic (pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg) should be administered after every hour.\nCheck the rats' reflexes by pinching the tail and hind feet to ensure that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized.\nOpen the tissue between two cartridge rings below the glottis using scissors and insert a 3 cm PE-10 tube to act as an endotracheal tube25.\nConnect the endotracheal tube to a ventilator manually.\nInspect the animal's thoracic movement synchronized with the respiration cycle to ensure the lungs are adequately ventilated.\nOpen the neck region and cannulate the jugular vein26.\n2. LAD ligation\nPut on a surgical mask and gloves.\nTouch the chest and find the manubrium and sternal angle (the junction of the manubrium and sternum body).\nIdentify the left-side rib that connects with the sternal angle (rib A) by touching manually.\nIdentify the intercostal space immediately below rib A. Use fine-tip forceps to gently lift the skin close to the intercostal space, and then use a surgical scalpel with a blade to create a 1 cm oblique incision along the skin tension lines from the point approximately 5 mm to the left of the sternal body.\nUse curved forceps to gently separate the skin and muscle layers from the incision. Hook the muscle layers outside the left anterior chest wall downward with bent clips to expose the ribs underneath.\nIdentify the rib below rib A (rib B). Cut rib B with a blunt scissor from the middle of the rib cartilage (approximately 2-3 mm from the sternal body). Gently touch and compress the wound with a saline wet cotton ball for several seconds if bleeding occurs.",
    "Open the thorax carefully from the cut of rib B with four bent clips. Each bent clip should hook the intercostal muscle and ribs to gently spread the chest wall in four directions (namely, upper then left, upper then right, left downward, and right downward) and create a rectangular surgical window.\nHook gently against the left lung and other adjacent tissues covering the pericardium with another bent clip to prevent accidental tissue damage during the procedure.\nExpose the heart by gently removing the thin pericardium with forceps. Identify the 1st branch of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), which is usually between the pulmonary artery and left auricle. The LMCA and LAD present as a superficial bright red line that runs from the edge of the left auricle toward the apex.\nUse the prepared surgical needle to create an open ligation loop by inserting and passing the silk stitch under the LAD at a location immediately distal to the 1st branch of the LMCA in the direction from the left toward the right side of the LAD to avoid accidentally puncturing the left auricle. With a single suture, the open loop is created. Gently swab the surface of the heart to visualizethe coronary arteries if the LAD is invisible because of fluid or blood covering the surface of the heart.\nHold one side of the suture and gently separate the needle from the suture using a needle holder.\nInsert the two ends of the silk suture on one side of the open loop into the circle on the other side to form a snare loop.\nInsert the two ends of the silk suture of the snare loop into the prepared snare controller before closing the loop.",
    "Slide the snare loop controller along the silk suture while gently stretching the silk to close the snare loop. Cease the coronary flow of the LAD to induce temporary myocardial ischemia for 1 h.\nHold the silk to fix the position of the snare loop controller with Kelly forceps once the loop has been tied securely. Place the other end of the Kelly forceps on the surgical table during LAD ligation.\nCover the surgical window with saline wet cotton balls during LAD ligation.\nOpen the Kelly forceps.\nRelease the snare loop controller for reperfusion of the coronary flow for 2 h.\nResect the heart along the base and vascular borders carefully and avoid grabbing the tissue.\n\tNOTE: Euthanize the rat with CO2 at a flow rate of 40%  cage volume/min.\nSubscription Required.
