Optokinetic thresholds should be assessed using a virtual optomotor system (VOS; CerebralMechanics) comprising of four computer monitors arranged in a square, displays facing inwards. On the monitors, a virtual cylinder displays sine-wave gratings that can be rotated either clockwise or counter clockwise permitting evaluation of both the left and right eyes independently; the left eye responds to clockwise, and the right eye to counterclockwise movement (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).",

Allow the animals 5 min to acclimate to the pedestal.\nUsing the Cerebral Mechanics software, set up the simple staircase examination for both eyes, keeping the contrast set to 100%.\nThe program will begin with a low spatial frequency, the cylinder will rotate and if the grating is resolved, the animal will respond with a reflexive head and neck movement tracking the grating. If the animal responds click ‘yes’, if the animal doesn’t respond click ‘no’. Based on this input, the spatial frequency of the grating will then incrementally increase until the animals no longer track the stimulus, resulting in a maximal spatial frequency threshold.\nOnce the exam is finished, take the animal off the pedestal and return them to their home cage.\nNote: The RCS rat has a near normal OKT through PD60. To determine the functional rescue resulting from the cell transplantation, this exam is most optimal no earlier than PD90.\nFundus photography.

Fundus images can be obtained at any time post-injection to verify successful transplantation of cells and the length of cell survival (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nDilate pupils with 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine.\nAnesthetize eyes with topical 0.5% proparacaine HCl.\nSedate animals with intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg).\nKeep eyes lubricated with 2.5% Goniovisc Hypromellose.\nUsing the Micron IV (Phoenix-Micron, Inc.) imaging system use the white light to capture bright field images of the retina.\nWhen imaging, use the optic nerve head as a guide, but then position the animal so that the peripheral/temporal region of the retina, where the injection took place, is in view.",
    "Place 0.5% erythromycin ointment on eyes and let animals recover from anesthesia.\nTissue preparation. Tissue samples must be appropriately harvested and prepared for histology and immunohistochemistry studies. Sample preparation include processes such as fixation, dehydration, embedding and sectioning.\nAfter euthanasia following IACUC guidelines, enucleate the eye as rapidly as possible.\nPlace the enucleated eye into cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Try to maintain a 10–20× fixative to tissue ratio.\nAfter 10–60 min of fixation, remove the anterior chamber of the eye including the lens and replace the remaining eye cup into 4% PFA. Place samples in PFA on ice.\nPlace the eyes in 2°C–8°C for 24–48 h.\nAfter 24–48 h, remove the PFA solution and add an equal volume of cold 10% sucrose solution in 1×PBS.\nPlace the eyes in 2°C–8°C for 24 h.\nRemove the 10% sucrose solution and replace the solution with an equal volume of cold 20% sucrose solution.\nPlace the eyes in 2°C–8°C for 24 h.\nRemove the 20% sucrose solution and replace the solution with an equal volume of cold 30% sucrose solution.\nPlace the eyes in 2°C–8°C for 24 h.\nRemove the eye cup from the 30% sucrose solution and dab dry on a piece of filter paper.\nPlace the eye cup cut side down on filter paper to allow the vitreous to drain out of the eye cup. Repeat until the filter paper remains dry. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A to view complete vitreous removal on filter paper (black represents vitreous imprint on the filter paper).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2123-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tissue preparation for histopathology\n(A–C) Diagramatic representation of vitreous removal on filter paper (A), orientation of eye cup (B) and freezing of cryomold (C) for histopathology.\nPlace the eye cup into a labeled cryomold and fill with OCT media.",
    "Orient the eye cup toward the front of the cryomold and orient the injection site at about 2’oclock for OS (oculus sinister left) eyes and 10’oclock for OD (oculus dextrus right) eyes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nFreeze the cryomold, containing the eye, in a liquid nitrogen bath. Ensure that the liquid nitrogen does not directly touch the OCT media, but only contacts the walls of the cryomold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Direct contact of liquid nitrogen to OCT media creates air bubbles, ruining sample integrity.\nOnce the media no longer has a glossy shine, remove it from the liquid nitrogen bath.\nTightly wrap the cryomold in aluminum foil to try to limit the block’s exposure to air.\nPlace wrapped blocks in a −20°C freezer.\nHistology / Immunohistochemistry. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical staining are valuable tools for detecting histopathological changes and specific antigens in tissues.\nSection eye blocks at 12 μm.\nObtain approximately 40 slides containing 4 sections per slide from each eye.\nCollect sections in a 5-slide series to provide a representative section every 60 μm on each slide throughout the eye-cup.\nStain the first slide of each series with cresyl violet or hematoxylin and eosin and examine retinal damage/toxicity and evidence of photoreceptor rescue (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2123-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. RPE transplantation in RCS rats\n(A and B) Fundus imaging (A) and H & E staining (B) of the saline and RPE injected (sub-retinal) eye of RCS rats. Inset (A) shows human nuclear antigen positive cells in cell injected eye at P90.\n(C) Optokinetic tracking of saline and RPE transplanted animals showed improved visual acuity.\n(D) Immunostaining of retinal sections with cone arrestin after transplantation.",
    "(E and F) Quantification of retinal thickness (E) and number of cones (F) from low and high dose RPE transplanted animals between nasal and temporal regions of the retina. Scale bars 100 μm.\nFor immunohistochemistry, dry slides for at least 30 min after removing from freezer.\nBlock for 45 min with 4% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5% triton x in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd primary antibodies (anti-cone arrestin, generously provided by W. Clay Smith, PhD, University of Florida) to blocking buffer and incubate overnight (minimum 15 h) at 4°C.\nThe next day, wash 3 × 5 min with 1×PBS.\nAdd secondary antibodies (1:300) in blocking buffer and incubate for 45 min in the dark at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash 3 × 5 min with 1×PBS.\nIncubate with DAPI in the dark for 10 min.\nWash 2 × 5 min with 1×PBS.\nCoverslip the slides with 100 μL of Fluoromount G.\nQuantification of photoreceptors. The outer nuclear layer thickness (ONL) was measured with the help of immunohistochemical staining as the primary indicator of photoreceptor rescue (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D–4F).\nUse a scanning laser confocal microscope (Leica SP5 using LAS AF software; Leica) to image stained slides. Keep laser intensity settings (gain) consistent for each emission wavelength.\nCollect Z-stack images at ×10 and ×20 magnification at 1024 × 1024-resolution with 1-μm step size.\nKeep color channels separate as each color channel z-stack is flattened. Save each color channel image and the color merged image as TIFF files.\nCount ONL cell bodies within the rows of the ONL in both temporal (injected) and nasal (non-injected) regions to obtain retinal thickness – nuclei values.\nCount cone arrestin positive cells in both temporal (injected) and nasal (non-injected) regions to obtain cones per image values.",
    "Have three observers blinded to the dosage and age group generate counts.\nUsing data collected in steps d-f , average ONL counts and photoreceptor counts per group and present data from both temporal (injected) and nasal (non-injected) regions."
