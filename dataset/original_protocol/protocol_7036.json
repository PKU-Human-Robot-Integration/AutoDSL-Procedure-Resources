    "Diaphragm separationEmbryonic diaphragm (E16.5) separation (Video 1)At the E16.5 stage, euthanize pregnant mouse by cervical dislocation.Spray 75% ethanol on the mouse and place the mouse facing up.Use the ophthalmic scissors to quickly cut the skin and muscle along the midline, then take out the embryos.Fix whole embryos with 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.Put the embryo in PBS, and cut along the ribs to remove the lower body. Then cut along the armpit to remove the upper body.Separate the lungs, diaphragm, and liver together from the chest cavity. Remove the lungs and livers carefully. This step ensures the integrity of the diaphragm.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Separation of the diaphragm from a mouse embryo Neonatal diaphragm (P1) separation (Video 2)Euthanize pup at the P1 by carbon dioxide inhalation and decapitation.Cut along the ribs to remove the lower body.Use the ophthalmic scissors to cut a small opening at the junction of the diaphragm and the chest cavity.Carefully separate the diaphragm with curved tip eye forceps and straight forceps.Put the diaphragm in PBS and flatten it.Remove other tissues from the diaphragm.Fix the diaphragm with 4% PFA.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.

    "Separation of the diaphragm from an adult mouse Immunofluorescence staining of diaphragmsEmbryonic/neonatal diaphragm stainingFix the neonatal diaphragm in a 12-well plate with 4% PFA for 1-2 h at room temperature (this step can be omitted as embryonic diaphragms were isolated from embryos fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4°C).Wash the diaphragm with PBS three times, 5-8 min each, at room temperature, and shaking slightly at 50-60 rpm.Wash the diaphragm with 0.1 M glycine for 1 h at room temperature, shaking slightly at 50-60 rpm (a long time fixation will increase fixation-induced autofluorescence, and 0.1 M glycine can reduce the autofluorescence).Wash the diaphragm with PBS three times, 5-8 min each, at room temperature, and shaking slightly at 50-60 rpm.Permeabilize the diaphragm with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature without shaking. This step is especially critical for the following blocking and staining procedures.Transfer the diaphragm onto the glass slide and draw a circle around the outside of the diaphragm with a hydrophobic pen. Then, block it with 100 μl blocking solution overnight at 4°C in a black incubator box containing a wet towel inside (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4215/bioprotoc-11-21-4215-g001.jpgFigure 1. Method of embryonic/neonatal diaphragm blocking Remove the blocking solution and add the primary antibody solution. Incubate it overnight at 4°C in a black wet incubator box.Remove the primary antibody solution and wash the diaphragm with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS three times, 1 h each, at room temperature.Incubate overnight at 4°C with a-BTX and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution.Remove the secondary antibody solution and wash the diaphragm with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS three times, 1 h each, at room temperature.Mount the diaphragm with 100 μl of mounting medium and cover it with a coverslip. Store it at 4°C overnight until confocal imaging.",
    "Adult diaphragm stainingMake a small hole (4 × 4 × 2 cm) on the foam board covered with aluminum foil and place the diaphragm inside; pin it in place with needles and fix it with 4% PFA for 1-2 h at room temperature (Figure 2).Note: This step should be performed immediately after the diaphragm separation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4215/bioprotoc-11-21-4215-g002.jpgFigure 2. Method of adult diaphragm fixation Wash the diaphragm with PBS three times, 5-8 min each, at room temperature, and shaking slightly at 50-60 rpm.Wash the diaphragm with 0.1 M glycine for 1 h at room temperature, shaking slightly at 50-60 rpm. For adult diaphragms, carefully remove connective tissues that cover their surface with arrow forceps at this step (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4215/bioprotoc-11-21-4215-g003.jpgFigure 3. Removal of connective tissues from the adult diaphragm. Debris of removed connective tissues are indicated by red arrows.Wash the diaphragm with PBS three times, 5-8 min each, at room temperature, and shaking slightly at 50-60 rpm.Permeabilize the diaphragm with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS overnight at 4°C without shaking.Perform blocking in a 12-well plate with 500 μl blocking solution at room temperature without shaking (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4215/bioprotoc-11-21-4215-g004.jpgFigure 4. Method of adult diaphragm blocking The remaining staining procedures are the same as for Steps B1g to B1k, Embryonic/neonatal staining. For an adult diaphragm, keep pipetting the antibody solution onto the middle of the diaphragm for 5 min to allow the antibody to penetrate into the diaphragm. Then, incubate overnight at 4°C."
