    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of organotypic gels (Day 1)\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThis step describes the organotypic gel preparation, which will serve as a 2D matrix to coculture the cells of interest.\nGel preparation (Day1).\nPre-coat a 24-well plate with collagen type I 1:100 in PBS.\nAdd 300 μL of 1:100 collagen type I in PBS for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nWash 3 times with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM 1× to the wells and keep on ice. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nPause point: Pre-coated 24-well plates can be stored at 4°C in DMEM for up to a week.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Pre-coating of 24-well plates (step: 1a)\nPreparation of organotypic gel mix (10 mL).\nGently mix 5.25 mL of type I collagen, 1.75 mL of Matrigel with 1 mL of 1× DMEM, 1 mL of 10× DMEM, 1 mL of FBS, and on-ice using pre-cooled tips. Pipette up and down several times with pre-cooled tips until the gel mix becomes homogenous. Keep on ice.\nGel mix will typically be yellow. Correct gel pH by adding 1 N NaOH drop-by-drop to the gel mix (see note by the end of the step). Gently pipette up and down with pre-cooled tips until the gel mix becomes homogenous. pH is assessed based on phenol red color change (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Keep on ice.\nRemove the DMEM from the pre-coated 24-well plate and add 1 mL of the gel mix using pre-cooled tips. Let the gel polymerize for 1 h at 37°C.\nGently add 1 mL of 1× DMEM and equilibrate the gels for 18–24 h at 37°C. See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C and Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].",
    "Critical: Collagen type I and Matrigel must be always on ice to avoid polymerization. Organotypic gel mix must be on ice before adding it to the plate. Use pre-cooled tips in every step before gel polymerization.\nNote: The pH of the gel needs to be adjusted. Since the gel mix needs to be sterile, cannot be filtered, and should be kept on ice, the pH correction is based on the color change of phenol red of DMEM. NaOH for pH correction can be added drop-by-drop followed by gently pipetting up and down until color change (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Most of the cells grow in pH from 7.0 to 7.7.\nAlternatives: Organotypic co-culture can be also performed using cancer cells, adipocytes, or adipose tissue. In this alternative protocol, 300,000 adipocytes or 40 mg of minced white adipose tissue (WAT) in a 100 μL DMEM 1× is mixed with 900 μL of the organotypic gel mix and then seeded in a 24-well plate. Let the gel polymerize for 1 h at 37°C and add 1 mL of 1× DMEM and equilibrate the gels for 18–24 h at 37°C.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Preparation of the organotypic gels (step: 1b)\nPreparation of cells and membranes (Day 2)\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the seeding of cancer and stromal cells on top of the organotypic gel and the preparation of the nylon membranes that will support the gel on top of the metallic grid.\nPrepare cancer/stromal cells and membrane.\nDetach the cells. Use pre-warmed reagents.\nAspirate the DMEM from the cells.\nWash 1 time with 5 mL of PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin and incubate 5 min at 37°C.\nNeutralize the trypsin using 2 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.",
    "Centrifuge 5 min at 250 g at 20°C–22°C and resuspend in 2 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nCount cancer and stromal cells and prepare aliquots containing 1 × 106 cells/mL in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Mix the cells in proportion 1:1, by adding 500 μL of each cell type (500,000 cancer cells and 500,000 stromal cells) for making up to 1 mL.\nNote: This is a standard protocol for cell detaching, however, any other detaching protocol can be used.\nSeed the cells onto the equilibrated organotypic gel.\nAspirate the DMEM from the equilibrated gels using a p1000 micropipette to avoid disruption of the gel.\nAdd 1 mL of cancer/stromal cell mix on top of the gel and let the cells embedded into the gel overnight (18 h) in the incubator.\nPrepare the pre-coated nylon membrane (Day 2).\nPrepare collagen type I gel mix (2.5 mL).\nGently mix 1,750 μL of type I collagen with 250 μL of 1× DMEM, 250 μL of 10× DMEM, and 250 μL of FBS on ice using pre-cooled tips. Pipette up and down several times with pre-cooled tips until the gel mix becomes homogenous. Keep on ice.\nGel mix will be typically yellow, correct gel pH by adding 1 N NaOH drop-by-drop (see note by the end of the step). Gently pipette up and down with pre-cooled tips until the gel mix becomes pink. Keep on ice.\nPlace the desired number of autoclaved membranes in a sterile cell culture p100 or p150 plate. Use 1 membrane per gel.",
    "Add 250 μL of collagen type I mix per membrane using pre-cooled tips. The collagen type I mix will do a bubble on top of the membrane and then collapse, covering it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Incubate the membranes with the collagen type I mix for 15 min at 37°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1913-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Incubate the membranes for 1 h at 4°C. This step will fix the collagen type I gel. Discard the membranes that detach from the plate.\nAspirate the 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS solution and wash it four times with 5 mL of PBS.\nAdd 10 mL of 1× DMEM, seal the plates with parafilm and incubate them overnight (18 h) at 4°C.\nSee Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B and Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nPause point: Pre-coated nylon membrane can be stored at 4°C in DMEM for up to a week.\nCritical: Collagen type I reagent and gel mix must always be on ice to avoid polymerization. Use pre-cooled tips in every step before gel polymerization.\nNote: NaOH for pH correction can be added drop-by-drop, followed by gently pipetting up and down until color change is observed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Most of the cells grow in pH from 7.0 to 7.7.",
    "Alternatives: For coculture of cancer cells with adipocytes, on day 2, only cancer cells are seeded on top of the gel as the adipocytes, or the WAT is already embedded in the gel.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Cell seeding and coating of collagen membrane (steps: 2 and 3)\nGel casting (Day 3)\nTiming: 20 min\nIn this step, the organotypic gel containing the cells will be placed on top of the pre-coated membrane placed over the grid. This will build an air-liquid culture as the gel will not be in contact with the media, but the nylon membrane will moisten it by capillarity.\nPlace the 2.5 cm2 stainless steel grid in a 6-well plate.\nPlace the 2.5 cm2 pre-coated 100 μm nylon membrane on top of the grid (organotypic structure).\nPlace the organotypic gel containing the cells on the top organotypic structure (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1913-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Add approximately 6–7 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to cover the structure and avoid touching the gel. The media is added from the vertex of the grid to prevent the formation of bubbles below the mesh (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Replace the media every 2–3 days.\nSee Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, 4B, and 4C and Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5].\nCritical: Passing the gel from the well to the structure is a challenging step. We encourage to practice with pilot gels before an experiment.\nCritical: Avoid bubble formation under the grid; this could dry your gel.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S5. Casting of organotypic cultures (steps: 4–7)\nMembrane processing (Day 15)\nTiming: 3 h\nAfter 15 days, the organotypic gel will have collapsed on top of the membrane. It will remain attached to the membrane after fixation. We will fix the membranes and process them as paraffin-embedded samples that can be cut to perform any staining.\nFix the membrane.\nLabel 6-well plate with 2 mL of 10% Neutral buffered formalin (NBF).\nUsing a pair of forceps, pick up carefully the membrane from the vertex and the gel and transfer it into the NBF. The gel will be collapsed and “fused” with the membrane.\nLet the membrane fix for 2 h at 20°C–22°C without movement.\nTransfer the membrane from the NBF to the new 6-well plate containing 70% ethanol.\nParaffin embedding of the membrane.\nCut the membrane into three pieces and place them in a tissue cassette (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). The membrane can be cut on top of an eraser using a scalpel or cut using a pair of scissors (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]). Keep it in 70% ethanol until paraffin embedding. It is recommended to process the samples as fresh as possible.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1913-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Membrane fixation and embedding",
