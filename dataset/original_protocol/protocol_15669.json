  "procedures": [
    "All animal care and procedures were performed under appropriate licenses issued by the UK Home office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) and were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board of Imperial College London.\n1. Preparation of buffers\nNOTE: This part of the protocol can be carried out well in advance of the rest of the protocol, except for the final steps involving the preparation of modified Krebs-Henseleit Buffer (mKHB) at 1x concentration.\nPrepare 1 M CaCl2 stock solution\n\t\nAdd 14.701 g of CaCl2 dihydrate to a clean 100 mL beaker. Add ~75 mL of deionized water and stir until complete dissolution of the salt.\nTransfer the solution to a 100 mL graduated flask and add deionized water until 100 mL volume has been reached. Transfer the solution to a bottle and store it in a refrigerator at 4 °C.\nPrepare 10x concentrated mKHB stock\n\t\nAdd 66.03 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), 3.57 g of potassium chloride (KCl), 1.63 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), and 1.44 g of magnesium sulfate to a 2 L beaker.\nAdd ~750 mL of deionized water to the beaker and stir until the salts have dissolved (there may be small salt crystals left at the bottom). Add 25 mL of 1 M CaCl2 stock solution (step 1.1) and stir; ensure this is the last salt added.\nTransfer the solution to a 1 L graduated flask and add deionized water to reach a total volume of 1 L. Transfer the solution to a 1 L bottle. Store concentrated 10x mKHB at 4 °C in a refrigerator.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentrated mKHB stock can be stored for approximately 1 month before replacement.\nPrepare dissection Petri dish (coating)",
    "Prepare a clean glass Petri dish (120 mm diameter) for coating by washing and drying the dish carefully.\nFollowing the manufacturer's instructions for usage and curing of the conformal alkoxy coating, coat the bottom of the Petri Dish with ~3-5 mm of coating by carefully pouring the conformal coating mixture into the dish until the desired thickness has been reached.\nCure the coating in an oven at 60 °C until it is firm to the touch. The dissection Petri dish is now ready.\n\t\t​NOTE: Gentle cleaning of the dish after each use will ensure that the coating lasts for years before replacement is needed. When replacing the coating, ensure to remove all the coating material before applying a new coating. Note that the conformal alkoxy coating (Table of Materials) used in this protocol has a shelf life shorter than a year.\n2. Pre-dissection preparations\nNOTE: This step starts the experiment. The below steps must be carried out on the same day, in this order.\nPrepare 1x mKHB\n\t\nPrepare a clean 2 L beaker for the buffer. Transfer 200 mL of 10x mKHB stock to the 2 L beaker. Add 2.1 g of sodium carbonate (NaHCO3) and 0.99 g of anhydrous Dextrose (D-glucose) to the 2 L beaker.\nAdd approximately 1 L of deionized water to the beaker. Stir until salts have been completely dissolved. Transfer the solution to a 2 L graduated flask and add deionized water to reach a total volume of 2 L.\nTransfer the solution to a 2 L glass bottle placed on a heating stirrer with the temperature set to 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: Smaller heating stirrer will often be unable to reach the target 37 °C temperature due to the thermal inertia of large containers full of water. Adjust the temperature upward so the contents of the bottle reach 37 °C with stirring. Monitor the temperature during the experiment and lower the set temperature in the event of overshoot.\nPlace a thermometer in the 2 L bottle to monitor the temperature, using grippers to prevent the thermometer from being impacted by the stirring flea. Aerate the buffer with carbogen for a minimum of 30 min to oxygenate the solution. This should set the pH to 7.4. Measure the pH with a pH meter to ensure it is within 0.1 pH units of 7.4 (at 37 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: To adjust the pH to 7.4, use hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide when needed.\nFill two 15 mL centrifuge tubes and one 100 mL bottle with mKHB and place them on ice to cool.\n\t\tNOTE: The centrifuge tubes and the bottle can be cleaned and reused after each experiment without autoclaving.\nFor later parts of the experiment, continue to aerate the buffer in the 2 L bottle with carbogen at 37 °C with continuous stirring.\n\t\tNOTE: Unsupervised use of carbogen may be dangerous if no automatic systems are in place to shut off gas flow in the event of a leak. An automated sensor and electronic shutoff valve can mitigate this; otherwise, a person must be left to supervise the equipment if dissection takes place in a different room. In all cases, an oxygen sensor should be used near the setup to warn operators when ambient oxygen concentration rises above 25%. Use a room with active ventilation if possible.",
    "Turn on the signal acquisition device, low-noise preamplifier, line noise filter, and oscilloscope for recording and stimulation, to allow enough time for temperature stabilization.\nEnsure all electrical recording equipment is correctly configured\n\t\nSet the low-noise preamplifier to AC-coupled input with the input band-pass filter set to 6 dB roll-off per decade, and cutoff frequencies set to 30 Hz and 3 kHz for the high-pass and low-pass filters, respectively.\nSet the gain of the low-noise preamplifier to 100.\n3. Animal anesthesia and euthanization\nNOTE: Female rats between 250 and 330 g (Table of Materials) were used for the studies.\nPrepare surgical tools and consumables: 12 cm straight scissors (blunt); 2 mm cutting edge angled spring scissors; 4 cm fine scissors, sharp or semi-sharp; #7 Dumont forceps; 45° angled fine forceps and 6-0 suturing silk or thread.\nPlace the rat in an anaesthetization container or chamber. Connect oxygen and the anesthetic diffuser to the container. Set anesthetic (isoflurane) concentration to 3.5% and wait approximately 10 min or until the animal shows signs of anesthesia such as loss of righting reflex.\nAfter the rat shows signs of anesthesia, confirm the loss of consciousness with a toe pinch withdrawal reflex test. Proceed only when there is no toe withdrawal; otherwise, check all the connections and anesthetic levels in the diffuser and repeat step 3.2.\nTake the animal out of the container and proceed with cervical dislocation, followed by incision of a femoral artery for confirmation of death.\n4. Dissection protocol\nNOTE: Place the animal with its belly down on the dissection table. Repeat the following steps for both legs. Typically, the right leg is dissected first.\nHolding the ankle firmly between the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, sever the calcaneal tendon using 12 cm straight blunt scissors.",
    "With fine sharp scissors, make a skin incision from the calcaneal tendon along the back of the leg all the way up to the base of the spine, taking care not to dissect the muscle tissue below.\nUsing fine forceps and fine scissors, make careful incisions through the muscle layers near the middle of the back of the leg until the sciatic nerve is exposed. As soon as the sciatic nerve is visible, moisturize the cavity using ice-cold mKHB to prevent the nerve from drying out.\nUsing hemostats, pull the flaps of skin on each side apart, and maintain the incision open for finer dissection work. Starting from the location of the calcaneal tendon incision, with fine scissors, interrupt the muscle on the medial side of the leg to free the nerve. Continue to maintain moisture levels in the area with ice-cold mKHB.\nAs the nerve is exposed while moving up the leg, dissect the overlying muscle tissue. Free the nerve nearer to the spine from connective tissues until reaching the spinal cleft at which point there is a kink in the nerve. Do not attempt to clean the nerve yet as speed is essential at this stage.\nSever the nerve as close to the spine as possible with fine scissors. To make the dissection easier, very gently pull the end of the nerve near the ankle using forceps. Never pinch the nerve in the middle, but only the ends. Never pull a nerve taut.\n\tOPTIONAL: At this point, if time allows, suturing of both ends of the nerve can be carried out to help maintain viability. Keep handling to a minimum to prevent damage. If there is insufficient time (see step 4.5), skip this step and follow step 5.2 later on.",
    "Place the dissected nerve in the 15 mL centrifuge tube filled with mKHB (step 2.1.5), close the tube, and place the tube back on ice until the start of the cleaning procedure.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.7 for the other leg. Ideally, each nerve should take 5-10 min to extract, in order to maximize tissue viability.\n5. Nerve cleaning procedure\nFill the coated Petri dish approximately halfway with chilled oxygenated mKHB. Place one of the dissected sciatic nerves in the dish and pin both ends of the nerve to the dish such that the nerve is straight without kinks, torsion, or twists. Pin the nerve as close to the ends as possible.\nUsing 6-0 silk sutures or fine thread, tie a double knot around each end of the nerve to prevent cytosol leakage into the buffer. Place the knots just next to the insect pins on the side closer to the center of the nerve, as this will prevent leakage from nerve tissue into the buffer. Do not carry out this step if the nerve has been previously ligated.\nUsing the microscope for precision and the 2 mm angled spring scissors, remove fat, blood vessels, and muscle tissue from the nerve. Prune any nerve branches that will not be used in the stimulation and recording protocol.\n\t\nEvery 5 min of cleaning, replace the buffer with fresh chilled oxygenated mKHB. Use fine forceps to pull on connective tissues, fat, and blood vessels to ease dissection.\nPlace the nerves back in the transport tubes filled with fresh oxygenated chilled mKHB and place the tubes on ice.\n6. Equipment setup",
    "NOTE: The equipment setup used to carry out experiments is illustrated in Figure 1. Briefly, it consists of a dual-compartment nerve bath, a 2 L bottle placed on a heating stirrer, a source of carbogen for buffer aeration, and tubing to allow the buffer to flow from the bottle to the bath, and back to the bottle using a peristaltic pump. The bath can be machined out of plexiglass or 3D-printed from watertight materials. It has a depth of approximately 2 cm, and the partition separating the two chambers of the bath features a 1.5 mm diameter hole to allow the threading of a peripheral nerve across both chambers. One chamber is large, must be at least 4 or 5 cm long, and will be filled with buffer. The other chamber should be at least 3 cm long and will be filled with silicone or mineral oil. The bath must not be made too large as this will degrade control of perfusion, temperature, and pH. Different bath sizes may be required depending on the size of the nerve tissue being studied.\nPrepare a clean dual-chamber nerve bath (see Supplementary File for design specifications). Place the nerve bath below the level of the 2 L bottle placed on the heating stirrer, using standard laboratory boss heads and grippers. Connect the drain of the bath to the peristaltic pump inlet.\nConnect the outlet of the peristaltic pump to a tube leading back to the 2 L buffer bottle. Connect the bath inlet to a tube with an adjustable flow valve and put the tube inside the 2 L bottle. Use a three-way valve with a syringe connected to the middle outlet to help with priming the tube as a siphon for gravity-assisted buffer inflow.",
    "Prime the siphon by drawing the syringe until buffer flows into it. Configure the valve such that the flow rate of buffer into the bath is ~5-6 mL·min-1. The flow can be increased initially to fill the bath. Once the bath buffer level has reached the drain, place the nerves in the bath.\nUsing an insect pin, secure the end of the nerve at the corner of the buffer-filled bath chamber. Using 45° angled fine forceps and pinching the nerve only at the ends, carefully thread the nerve to be stimulated through the hole in the partition between the two bath chambers.\nSecure the other end of the nerve in the oil chamber of the bath with an insect pin, ensuring that the nerve is straight without being stretched and is free of kinks and twists. Using silicone grease, make a seal to prevent buffer leakage from the buffer chamber into the oil chamber. Fill the oil chamber with silicone or mineral oil.\nPlace the Ag/AgCl recording electrode hooks in the oil bath chamber and secure them using boss heads and grippers. Drape the portion of the nerve in the oil bath over the hooks without pulling the nerve taut. Do not pinch the nerve; use angled forceps to lift the nerve without pinching.\nAdjust or repair the silicone grease seal if any leakage is observed after moving the nerve.\nConnect the reference Ag/AgCl electrode to the amplifier ground and place the electrode in the buffer-filled bath chamber by securing it using a laboratory gripper.\n7. Electrode implantation on the nerve in the bath",
    "Prepare a clean nerve cuff electrode for stimulation according to reference21. Place the electrode in the buffer-filled bath chamber. Using forceps or fine tweezers with blunt or angled tips, open the electrode in the bath to wet the inside of the cuff.\nIf bubbles remain, use a fine syringe to draw buffer from the bath and force the bubbles out of the cuff. With a tweezer under the nerve, gently open the cuff and slide it under the nerve. Close the cuff around the nerve, taking care to avoid any kinking or twisting of the nerve.\nConnect the stimulation electrode to the stimulator and secure the stimulation electrode lead with tape. Connect the current return electrode to the stimulator and secure the lead with tape. If using a square platinum sheet as the current return electrode, position the sheet away from the nerve in the bath.\n8. Stimulation and recording\nConnect the stimulator TTL signal output to channel 4 of the oscilloscope, which will be used to trigger the oscilloscope. On the oscilloscope screen, press the Trigger channel tab, and specify Channel 4 as the triggering channel. Set the trigger level to 1 V using the Level knob.\nOn the oscilloscope, set time resolution to 1 ms/division and voltage resolution to 10 mV/division. Center the trigger reference in time and set the trigger level to 1 V.\n\tNOTE: Follow steps 8.3 to 8.6 if using the custom stimulator (see Table of Materials). It is assumed that the MATLAB software and device drivers have been installed on the laboratory computer using instructions provided freely online for the custom neural stimulator21. Otherwise, follow the manufacturer's instructions for the use of a commercially available stimulator as an alternative.",
    "Connect the stimulator to the laboratory computer. Turn on the stimulator by connecting the battery power supply to the power input. Start the MATLAB software on the laboratory computer.\nExecute the custom MATLAB script: HFAC_4ch_Stimulator_Initialization.m (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The USB communication cable between the computer and stimulator should flash green. If it does not, then there is a configuration error, and the power supply and connections must be verified.\nOpen the MATLAB script: HFAC_4ch_Monophasic_Stimulation.m (Table of Materials). By directly editing the MATLAB script, set the parameters as follows: stimulator pulse amplitude = -300 µA, stimulator pulse width = 300 µs, stimulator number of pulses = 10 and stimulator time between pulses = 1 s.\nStart the stimulation protocol by clicking on Run in the MATLAB software.\nSubscription Required.
