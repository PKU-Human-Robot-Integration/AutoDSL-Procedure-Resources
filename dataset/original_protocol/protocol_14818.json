    "NOTE: Experiments were performed in accordance with international guidelines on the ethical use of animals and were approved by the local animal welfare commission of the University Medical Center, Hamburg.\n1. Preparation of Tumor Cells, Mice, and Antibody Constructs\nPreparation of Lymphoma Cells and Aliquoting of Basement Matrix (Matrigel).\n\t\nThe day before injection of tumor cells put a sterilized tip box (1,000 µl tips) and the appropriate pipette in -20 °C freezer.\nThaw the bottle with the basement matrix on ice in the 4 °C fridge O/N.\nOn the day of injection fill an ice bucket and place the basement matrix along with pipette, tips, and 1 ml syringes with 30 G needles on ice.\nAliquot lymphoma cells in a volume of 100 µl of RPMI medium in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and mix carefully with 100 µl of the basement matrix. Draw up into pre-cooled syringes and put on ice until injection.\n\t\tNOTE: Use good sterile technique and to work on ice the whole time to prevent clogging of the basement matrix.\nMice Preparation\n\t\nUse 8-10 week old athymic nude mice (NMRI-Foxn1nu).\nTo reduce autofluorescence of the intestine keep mice on an alfalfa-free diet for 1 week prior to in vivo imaging.\nFor injection of lymphoma cells anesthetize mice to effect with 2% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Maintain 1-2% isoflurane for the duration of the procedure using an isofluorane manifold.\nInject lymphoma cells subcutaneously into the shoulder flanks. For direct intra-individual comparison inject antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells on the right and left side, respectively.",
    "Use a thumb and index finger to pinch the skin of the mouse and pull it away from the body of the mouse. Inject slowly and evenly into the pouch created by the fingers, creating a single cluster of cells beneath the skin. The basement matrix helps keeping injected cells in place.\nPreparation of Antibody Constructs\n\t\nLabel monoclonal antibodies and single domain nanobodies with a commercially available protein labelling kit to the fluorescent dye AlexaFluor-680 (AF680) (excitation wavelength = 679 nm, emission wavelength = 702 nm) according the manufacturer’s instructions. Calculate the number of dyes per nanobody and conventional antibody using molar extinction coefficients of 15,720 mol-1 cm-1 and 203,000 mol-1 cm-1, respectively. Assess the purity of antibody constructs by SDS-PAGE size fractionation and Coomassie brilliant blue stain.\nEnsure the specificity of the labeled conjugates by conducting a series of in vitro experiments before the actual imaging studies. Test the specificity of labeled antibody constructs in vitro through blocking studies and unspecific isotype controls 8,20.\n\t\tNOTE: In step 1.2.4 cell numbers for antigen-negative and antigen-positive cells (or different cells lines) may have to be adapted according to different growth rates. For these experiments, 0.5x106 DC27.10 ARTC2 negative and 1.5x106 DC27.10 ARTC2 positive cells were used to obtain tumors of similar size. In step 1.3.1 the process of labeling and labeling efficacy of antibody probes with fluorophores may differ by the labeling kit used.\n2. In Vivo Imaging\nAfter 7-9 days, when tumors reach ~8 mm in diameter, inject 50 µg of AlexaFluor680 labelled antibody constructs in a volume of 200 µl saline intravenously into the tail vein of the mouse (mAb-AF680: 50 µg with 2 dyes/molecule ≈ ~4^14 fluorochromes ≈ ~0.8 µg fluorochromes; Nanobody-AF680: 50 µg with 0.3 dyes/molecule ≈ ~5.6^14 fluorochromes ≈ ~1.1 µg fluorochromes).",
    "Initialize the imaging system and anesthetize mice to effect with 3% isoflurane using an XGI-8 anesthesia system in the induction chamber prior to imaging. Maintain 1-2% isoflurane for the duration of the imaging procedure using the isoflurane manifold housed in the imaging chamber.\n\t\nPosition mice on heated imaging stage with tumors directed towards the camera. Monitor the proper anesthetization by pinching the toe or tail of the animal; any reaction of the animal indicates that anesthesia is too light.\nMonitor the respiration rate; the anesthesia is too light if the respiration rate is increased and too deep if the respiration rate is decreased, deep or irregular. Protect animal’s corneas with an eye ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nChoose fluorescent filter sets of 615-665 nm for excitation, 695-770 nm for emission, and 580-610 nm excitation for background subtraction with a 51 2x 512 pixel matrix size. Set exposure time to auto, pixel binning to medium and F/Stop to 2.\n\tNOTE: Shorter exposure times enable faster frame rates; longer exposure times provide greater sensitivity. Binning controls the pixel size on the CCD camera. Increasing the binning increases the pixel size, sensitivity, and frame rate, but reduces spatial resolution. F/Stop sets the size of the camera lens aperture. The aperture size controls the amount of light detected and the depth of field.Note that settings can differ by imaging device and experimental set up. Consult the manufacturer’s manual for optimal results.\n\t\nIn the imaging software optimize exposure time, F/stop and pixel binning based on the expression level of the cell line. Change these settings at any time during an experiment without impacting the quantitative result. Alternatively, let the Imaging Wizard software automatically determine the parameters.\nImage mice before injection and 6 hr after injection of antibody constructs.",
    "NOTE: The labelling efficacy may affect the required dose needed for optimal imaging results. Therefore the amount of required antibody-construct for optimal imaging results has to be determined empirically. It may vary depending on labelling efficacy and size of the construct as well as the tumor model and the target-antigen expression.\n3. Harvesting and Preparation of Tumors\nFill an ice bucket and place 4%, paraformaldehyde (PFA) phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/protease inhibitor (AEBSF) and PBS/0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) on ice.\nOnce the imaging session is finished, increase the concentration of isoflurane to 4%. After animal ceases breathing, remove it from the imaging stage and perform cervical dislocation.\nMount mouse on a Styrofoam block and spray with 70% ethanol.\nUse scissors and forceps to cut the outer skin and pull it back carefully to expose tumors. Remove tumors with scalpel to ensure tumor tissue remains intact.\nCut tumors in half using a scalpel. Place one half in a collection tube with PBS/AEBSF for FACS analyses and the other half in a 50 ml tube with 4% PFA for immunohistochemistry.\nPreparation for immunohistochemistry\n\t\nKeep tumors in 4% PFA in the fridge at 4 °C for 24 hr. Transfer tumors to a tube with PBS/30% sucrose and keep in the fridge at 4 °C until the tumor sinks to the bottom of the tube.\nCut the tumors in appropriate pieces for the cryomolds. Put the tumors in cryomolds and fill with OCT compound so that the tumors are covered.\nPut molds on dry ice and wait until the compound is completely frozen. Transfer frozen tumors to -80 °C freezer and store for immunohistochemistry.",
    "Cut frozen tumors in sections of 8 μm with a microtome. Use standard immunohistochemistry protocol to stain with antibody against CD31-AF488 to visualize blood vessels and diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize nuclei.\n\t\tNOTE: Tumor sections are very sensitive to light as they already contain fluorescently labelled antibodies. Minimize exposure to light as much as possible.\nPreparation for FACS analysis\n\t\nPlace petri dish on ice and remove the plunger from a 2.0 ml syringe. Put the tumor in the cell strainer and cut it gently into 3-4 pieces using a scalpel. Pour the initial PBS in the petri dish and use the flat end of the plunger to mash the tumor within the cell strainer.\nFlush the cell strainer with the initial PBS to wash out all cells with a 10 ml pipette. Transfer cell suspension in a new tube and spin at 500 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 ml PBS/0.2% BSA. Count cells.\nAliquot 1-5 x 106 lymphoma cells in a 5 ml FACS tube. Spin cells again (500 x g), discard supernatant and resuspend in 100 µl PBS/0.2% BSA.\nOptionally, block FcR using an anti-CD16/CD32-mAb (FcgR3/2) that binds to FcγR on ice for 10 min. Wash cells once with PBS/0.2% BSA.\nAdd anti-CD45-mAb to discriminate leucocytes from other cells. Incubate for 20 min on ice in the dark, followed by two washes with PBS/0.2% BSA.\nRight before FACS analysis stain with propidium iodide for 15 min on ice to discern dead cells, followed by two washes with plain PBS. Resuspend in 150 µl for FACS analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: In step 3.7.4 and step 3.7.5 other antibodies may be used depending on the tumor entity.\n4. FACS Analysis",
    "Use a series of gating tools to gate the population of interest in the form of large scatter, doublet discrimination, exclusion of dead cells, gating for CD45 positive cells, and gating for antigen-positive cells.\n\t\nAt first, gate out cell debris in a forward scatter (FSC-A) versus side scatter (SSC-A) using a two-parameter plot. Next discard cell doublets. Finally, gate out non CD45-antigen-positive (CD45) and dead/dying cells (LD – live/dead-stain).\nRecord samples using the same template for all experiments.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the manufacturer’s protocol for technical advice regarding the use of hardware and analytic software.\n5. Microscopic Analysis\nAnalyze stained tumor cryosections using a confocal microscope with an oil immersion lens (40X objective). Use a He-Neon 633 nm laser excitation of AF680, an Argon Laser for AF488, and a 405-Diode for DAPI.\nProcess the raw image data using a software compatible with the microscope. Perform background-correction and noise filtering if necessary. Perform additional image adjustments such as sectioning, cropping as well as brightness and contrast adjustments.\n\t\nFinally generate a single composite overlay image from all detection channels. Adjust the brightness and contrast of the individual layers. The composite images will show localization of cells (DAPI-stain, blue), distribution of labelled antibody constructs (AF680-stain, red) and blood vessels (AF488-stain, green).\n6. In Vivo Imaging Analysis\nOpen image files in imaging software and create an overlay image by combining photograph image data with fluorescence image data. Optimize image display by removing tissue autofluorescence background signal from the specific fluorescent signal. This can be done by subtracting the image acquired with a background filter set from the image acquired with the filter set specific for the tracer.",
    "Draw identical circular measurement regions of interest (ROI) around the antigen-positive tumor and the antigen-negative tumor. To determine background signal intensity, place a circular ROI in an area of the animal where fluorescence signal is expected to be low (e.g., hind leg).\n\t\nUse the same ROIs for all animals at all time points. For positioning, use the photographic black-and-white images to identify tumor margins.\nDisplay ROI data in a measurement table. Use average radiant efficiency data, which enables a more quantitative comparison of fluorescent signals for further statistical analyses.\n\t\nDisplay and compare data as absolute signal intensities or calculate the signal-to-background ratio using measured ROI data from targeted tissue and background tissue. Calculate the tumor-to-background ratio by dividing the tumor uptake value by the background value determined from the hind limb.\nAs controls, also analyze antigen-negative and antigen-positive tumors in the same animals as well as animals injected with labelled isotype controls to assess the specificity of signals in vivo."
