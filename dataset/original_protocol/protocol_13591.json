  "procedures": [
    "This protocol describes all steps required for the snRNA-seq of murine cervical and/or cervicothoracic (stellate) ganglia. Female and male C57BL/6J mice (15 weeks old, n = 2 for each sex) were used. One additional Wnt1-Cre;mT/mG mouse was used to visualize the ganglia for dissection purposes17,18. This additional mouse was generated by the crossbreeding of a B6.Cg-Tg(Wnt1-cre)2Sor/J mouse and a B6.129(Cg)-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J mouse. All animal experiments were carried out according to the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by NIH and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Leiden University (License number AVD1160020185325, Leiden, The Netherlands). See the Table of Materials for details regarding all materials, equipment, software, and animals used in the protocol.\n1. Preparations\nNOTE: All steps are performed in a cell culture flow cabinet.\nClean the forceps and scissors by immersing the instruments in 70% ethanol for 20 min.\nPrepare the ganglion medium consisting of Neurobasal Medium supplemented with B-27 plus (1x), L-glutamine (2 mM), and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic. Prewarm the ganglion medium at room temperature.\nPrepare the digestion solution: 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (1:1) and 1,400 U/mL collagenase type 2 dissolved in the ganglion medium.\nPrepare fresh, cold (4 °C) cell wash buffer (0.4% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) and lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% nonionic detergent, 40 U/mL RNAse in nuclease-free water) for the nucleus isolation.\nPrepare nucleus wash buffer (1x phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with 2.0% BSA and 0.2U/µL RNase Inhibitor).\nPrepare ST staining buffer (ST-SB) (10 mM Tris-HCl, 146 mM NaCl, 21 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 2% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20 in nuclease-free water).\n2. Dissection of adult mouse superior cervical ganglia (SCG)\nEuthanize the mice and keep them on ice.",
    "NOTE: In the current study, a total of 4 C57BL6/J mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Alternatively, isoflurane can be used followed by exsanguination when a large amount of blood needs to be collected for other study purposes.\nFix the mouse on a dissection board with pins and douse it with 70% ethanol to minimize the dispersion of fur (shaving is not necessary).\nUnder a stereomicroscope, open the skin of the neck region by making a midline cut with scissors, move the submandibular glands aside, and remove the sternomastoid muscle to expose and locate the common carotid artery and its bifurcation (Figure 1A, B, see arrow).\nDissect the right and left carotid artery bifurcation and the tissue attached to it. Transfer each dissected piece of tissue to a separate 3.5 cm Petri dish containing cold PBS.\nLook for the SCG attached to the carotid bifurcation. Clean the SCG further by removing the artery and other attached tissue in the Petri dish (Figure 1E).\n3. Dissection of adult mouse stellate ganglia (StG)\nTo dissect the StG, make a midline cut in the abdomen, followed by opening the diaphragm and the ventral thoracic wall.\nRemove the heart and lungs to expose the dorsal thorax. Look for the left and right StG anterolateral to the musculus colli longus (MCL) at the level of the first rib (Figure 1C, D, indicated by dashed lines).\nDissect both left and right StG with forceps and separately transfer them to 3.5 cm Petri dishes containing cold PBS (Figure 1F).\n\t​\n4. Isolation and cryopreservation of mouse ganglionic cells\nSteps 4-6 are summarized in Figure 2.\nCarefully transfer all individual SCG and StG to separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with forceps.",
    "NOTE: Do not use pipette tips to transfer the ganglia because the ganglia are prone to adhere to the wall of plastic pipette tips.\nAdd 500 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution to each microcentrifuge tube and incubate in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 40 min.\n\tNOTE: This step is aimed to facilitate the digestion and cell release hereafter in the collagenase type 2 solution.\nPrepare a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of ganglion medium for each sample. Allow the ganglia to settle down at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes. Collect the supernatant, which contains very few ganglionic cells, transfer the supernatant to the prepared 15 mL tubes, and label each tube. Alternatively, to save some time, aspirate the trypsin-EDTA supernatant without collection as very few dissociated cells can be detected in it.\n\tNOTE: A small amount of trypsin-EDTA solution (~10-30 µL) can be left in the microcentrifuge tube to avoid removal of the ganglia. Avoid pipetting at this step because it may damage the ganglia and lead to low output of ganglionic cells afterward.\nAdd 500 µL of collagenase type 2 solution into each microcentrifuge tube and incubate in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 35-40 min. Try to resuspend the ganglion after 35 min; if the ganglion is still intact and does not dissociate, prolong the incubation time or increase the concentration of collagenase type 2 solution as necessary.\n\tNOTE: The incubation time could vary depending on the ganglion size.\nResuspend the ganglia in collagenase solution by pipetting up and down ~10 times or until tissue clumps are no longer detected.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension to the previously used 15 mL tube that contains the ganglia culture medium and the trypsin-EDTA suspension from the same ganglion. Spin down the cell suspension with a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge for 10 min, 300 × g at room temperature. Carefully discard the cell supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Because the ganglionic cells are dissociated from a single ganglion, the cell pellet may be too small to detect by eye; a small amount of supernatant can be left in the tube to avoid accidental removal of the cell pellet.\nResuspend the ganglionic cells in 270 µL of fetal bovine serum (FBS, low endotoxin) and transfer each cell-FBS suspension into a 1 mL cryovial.\nTo count the cells, mix 5 µL of the ganglionic cell suspension with 5 µL of 0.4% trypan blue dye and load the mixture into a hemocytometer. Count the total and live-cell numbers under a microscope.\n\tNOTE: The cell viability (live cell count/total cell count = viability %) is usually above 90% with this dissociation protocol. The live cell count of a single ganglion (either SCG or StG) usually falls within the range of 9,000-60,000 cells when the ganglion is isolated from a mouse aged 12 to 16 weeks.\nAdd 30 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to each cell-FBS suspension in the cryovials, mix well, and transfer the cryovials into a cell freezing container, which is kept at room temperature. Store the cryovial loaded container at -80 °C overnight, and transfer the cryovials to liquid nitrogen the next day for long-time preservation before sequencing.\n5. Nucleus isolation",
    "NOTE: Left and right SCG isolated from four mice (in total 8 samples) were used as an example in the following nucleus isolation and sequencing preparation. Keep everything on ice during the whole procedure. Because of the invisibility of small nucleus pellets, a centrifuge with swinging buckets is highly recommended to facilitate supernatant removal throughout the whole procedure.\nPrepare 15 mL tubes with a strainer (30 µm) on top and prerinse the strainer with 1 mL of the ganglion medium.\nTake out the cryovials from liquid nitrogen and immediately thaw them in a water bath at 37 °C. When a small pellet of ice is left in the cryovial, take the cryovials out of the water bath.\nRecover the ganglionic cells by dropping 1 mL of the ganglion medium into each cryovial while shaking carefully by hand. Optional: To evaluate cell recovery, mix the cell suspension after recovery and take 5 µL of cell suspension out for live-cell counting, as described in step 4.8.\nLoad each ganglionic cell suspension on a separate strainer (prepared in step 5.1) and rinse each strainer with 4-5 mL of ganglion medium.\nCentrifuge the strained cell suspension for 5 min at 300 × g, remove the supernatant carefully, and resuspend the cells in 50 µL of cell wash buffer.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a low-binding DNA/RNA 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove 45 µL of the supernatant without touching the bottom of the tube to avoid dislodging the cell pellet.\nAdd 45 µL of chilled Lysis Buffer and gently pipette up and down using a 200 µL pipette tip.\nIncubate the cells for 8 min on ice.\nAdd 50 µL of cold nucleus wash buffer to each tube. Do not mix.",
    "Centrifuge the nucleus suspension at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove 95 µL of the supernatant without disrupting the nucleus pellet.\nAdd 45 µL of chilled nucleus wash buffer to the pellet. Optional: Take 5 µL of nucleus suspension, mix with 5 µL of 0.4% trypan blue to count, and check the quality of nuclei under a microscope with a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the nucleus suspension at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant without touching the bottom of the tube to avoid dislodging the nucleus pellet.\n6. Nucleus barcoding with hashtag oligos (HTOs) and multiplexing\nNOTE: HTO staining steps were modified and optimized for nuclear labeling of very low amounts of (ganglionic) nuclei according to the previous application in cortical tissue by Gaublomme et al.15.\nAdd 50 µL of ST-SB buffer to the nucleus pellet, gently pipette 8-10 times until the nuclei are completely resuspended.\nAdd 5 µL of Fc Blocking reagent per 50 µL of the ST-SB/nuclei mix and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nAdd 1 µL (0.5 µg) of single-nucleus hashtag antibody per tube of the ST-SB/nuclei mix and incubate for 30 min on ice.\n\tNOTE: Shorter incubation time leads to lower efficiency of hashtag labeling, as demonstrated in the representative results.\nAdd 100 µL of ST-SB to each tube. Do not mix.\nCentrifuge the nucleus suspension for 5 min, 600 × g at 4 °C.\nRemove 145 µL of the supernatant without disrupting the nucleus pellet.\nRepeat steps 6.4 and 6.5. Remove the supernatant as much as possible without touching the bottom of the tube to avoid dislodging the nucleus pellet.\nResuspend the nucleus pellet in 50 µL of ST-SB, and gently mix the nuclei.",
    "Take 5 µL of the nucleus suspension and mix it with 5 µL of 0.4% trypan blue to count the nuclei under a microscope. See Figure 3A for a representative image of nuclei mixed with trypan blue and loaded in a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the nucleus suspension for 5 min at 600 × g at 4 °C.\nResuspend the nuclei in ST-SB to achieve a target nucleus concentration of 1,000-3,000 nuclei/µL for each sample according to the corresponding nucleus count.\nPool the samples to achieve the desired number of cells.\n\tNOTE: For example, in this experiment, 8 samples were equally pooled to achieve a total of 25,000 nuclei to immediately proceed to 10x Genomics Chromium and snRNA-seq afterward. The nucleus count usually falls within the range of 6,000-40,000 cells when the ganglion is isolated from a mouse aged 12 to 16 weeks. Only around half of the total loaded nuclei can be captured by droplet-based snRNA-seq. For example, a 25,000 nucleus mixture was prepared to ensure capture of 10,000 nuclei, which is needed for further library preparation and sequencing.\nSubscription Required.
