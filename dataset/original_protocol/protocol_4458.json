    "The primary antibodies need to be optimized through concentration titration to make sure that they work properly before the start of proximity ligation assay (usually ranging from 1:100 to 1:500), and IgG from the same isotype and species was usually used as negative control.Breast cancer cells (e.g. Hs578T and MDA-MB-468) were transferred on the coverslip in plates/culture dishes and grown to 50%-70% confluency. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed, and then blocked using Duolink blocking buffer for 1 h (all these steps are usually performed at room temperature; if you have previously optimized your assay, use the same conditions for Duolink). The coverslips were transferred into a humidified chamber (Figure 1) and then a small volume of primary antibodies targeting the proteins under investigation were pipetted onto each coverslip (for a 12 mm coverslip, 20-40 µl of antibody added in antibody diluent is more than enough). Antigen-antibody interaction will mostly accomplish in an hour at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation (the residual solution can be absorbed using tissues to obtain an equal residual volume on each slide as this will affect reproducibility, However, do not allow the samples to dry before adding the primary antibodies as this will cause background).The two corresponding PLA probes were mixed and diluted (1:5) in the antibody diluent. Allow the mixture to sit for 20 min at room temperature (e.g. for a 50 μl reaction take 10 μl of PLA probe MINUS stock, 10 μl of PLA probe PLUS stock and 30 μl of the antibody diluent). The samples were washed with PBS+0.05% Tween twice, and then incubated with PLA probes MINUS and PLUS for 1 h at 37 °C.",
    "The samples were washed in 1x wash buffer A for 2 x 5 min under gentle agitation, and the probes were ligated with two other circle-forming DNA oligonucleotides by ligation-ligase solution for 30 min at 37 °C (1:40 dilution, consisting of two oligonucleotides and ligase to hybridize oligonucleotides to the two PLA probes and join to a closed circle if they are in close proximity).The samples were washed in 1x wash buffer A for 2 x 2 min under gentle agitation and two added oligonucleotides by enzymatic ligation were amplified via rolling circle amplification by the incubation with amplification-polymerase solution (1:80 dilution) over 90 min at 37 °C (consisting of nucleotides and fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides, which is added together with polymerase. The fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides will hybridize to the rolling-circle amplification (RCA) product using the ligated circle as a template, and the signal is easily visible as a distinct fluorescent spot by fluorescence microscope). The samples were washed in 1x wash buffer B for 2 x 10 min followed by 0.01x wash buffer B for 1 min by diluting 1x buffer B 1:100 in high purity water. Note: In steps 6-8 above, the volume of wash buffers A and B depends on the size of coverslip, for a small one (12 mm), we usually wash in a 12-well plate using 1 ml wash buffer.The samples were dried in hood for approximately 10 min at room temperature in the dark, and mounted onto a slide in a minimal volume of ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI.Fluorescent signal amplification was used for the assay and interactions were detected using a fluorescence or confocal microscope, using at least a 20x objective. After imaging, the slides can be stored at -20 °C in the dark.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519202104_9212.jpgFigure 1. The chamber for incubation.",
    "The 6-well plate was covered with a piece of parafilm to support the coverslip with cells, and another lid was used to prevent sample drying. The chamber is designed to be incubated in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C for most of the PLA reactions."
