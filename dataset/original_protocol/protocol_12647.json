    "1. Drug library preparation\nIdentify and prepare a drug library to be screened using appropriate solvent at a desired concentration (e.g., 10 mM in DMSO).\n\tNOTE: A specific example for a drug library is the Oncology Set III from National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP). Compounds in this set are provided as 20 µL at 10 mM in 100% DMSO in two 96-well PP U-bottom plates and stored at -20 °C. The NCI Plate maps, and the basic chemical data of each drug could be found at the following websites:\nNCI plate number 4740[href=https://dtp.cancer.gov/dtpstandard/servlet/PlateMap?searchlist=4740&outputformat=html&searchtype=plate&Submit=Submit]\nNCI plate number 4741[href=https://dtp.cancer.gov/dtpstandard/servlet/PlateMap?searchlist=4741&outputformat=html&searchtype=plate&Submit=Submit]\n2. Screen for heterochromatin-promoting drugs using Drosophila\nDrosophila Breeding strategy (Figure 1A)\n\t\nDay 1: Cross three w1118/Y; DX1/CyO male flies and three or more virgin w1118 female flies in a 25 mm x 95 mm food vial with 9 mL of standard Drosophila food media (Bloomington recipe). Set up three replicate vials for each drug and one control for the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: DX1 flies were kindly provided by James Birchler (University of Missouri)9,13.\nDay 2 and Day 3: Allow the flies to lay eggs for 2 days at room temperature (22 °C).\nDay 4: Use a short burst of CO2 gas to anesthetize the parent flies and dispose of the parent flies in a \"fly morgue\" (a bottle containing 70% alcohol).\nFeed drugs to Drosophila for screening.\n\t\nDilute each drug compound from the original stock (20 µL at 10 mM in 100% DMSO in 96-well PP U-bottom plates) to a 10 µM final concentration with 33% DMSO in water. Use 33% DMSO in water without any drug as the control.\n\t\tNOTE: Some drugs are poorly soluble in water and were dissolved in DMSO. 100% DMSO is toxic to flies. 33% is tolerable.",
    "Day 4: Pipette 60 µL of a 10 µM drug solution or control onto the top of fly food. At this point, ensure that the parent flies have been removed and there are fly eggs and crawling first-instar larvae on the food.\nDay 6: Repeat pipetting 60 µL of the same 10 µM drug solution to the food vial.\n\t\tNOTE: Since drugs were added on to the fly food, the top surface food contains nearly 10 µM concentration and the bottom food could be not be fully penetrated. All the flies lay eggs on the food top and eat the top surface food.\nObserve and score eye color changes.\n\t\nTwo days after the F1 flies emerge (approximately on day 14), examine the flies. Use a short burst of CO2 to anesthetize the F1 flies and remove the flies from their vial onto a porous dissecting pad with CO2 sipping through from underneath a filter paper.\nInspect the flies on this pad under a dissection microscope. Examine the whole fly and identify all w1118/Y; DX1/+ heterozygous males by their lacking the CyO dominant curly wing phenotype.\nScore the eye color of each of the w1118/Y; DX1/+ heterozygous male flies on a scale of 1 to 5 (Figure 1B). The percentage of white eye color was rated as follows:\n\t\t1. <5% red scattered eye total surface area\n\t\t2. 6% - 25% red spots eye total surface area\n\t\t3. 26% - 50% red spots eye total surface area\n\t\t4. 51% - 75% red spots eye total surface area\n\t\t5. >75% red spots eye total surface area",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, homogenize fly heads in 100% methanol and use a spectrometer to measure eye pigmentation at OD 450 nm. Select only males because PEV is more pronouced in DX1 males. Score more than 10 males in each vial.\nCalculate the mean color index of all the males from each vial scored. Perform triplicates for each compound (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: Since eye color varies with age, this is a time-sensitive step. The eye color should be calculated at the same age – 2 days old. Usually >10 flies should be scored in each vial.\nTo confirm that the compounds indeed promote heterochromatin formation, use a different technique such as western blotting to validate (Figure 1G).\nSubscription Required.
