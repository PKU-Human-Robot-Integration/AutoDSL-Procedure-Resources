    "All procedures described in this protocol have been performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nPrior to surgery, lung metastases are to be generated in mice using cancer cells that express a photoconvertible/photo-switchable protein; several protocols for lung metastasis generation have been published26,27,28.\n1. Preparation for surgery\nPrepare distinct work areas for mouse preparation (hair removal and intubation), surgery, and recovery.\nSterilize all surgical instruments in an autoclave.\n\tNOTE: As a tips-only technique is used for this surgery, a hot bead sterilizer may be used to resterilize instruments for subsequent procedures.\nTurn on the heated surgical platform and allow it to reach and stabilize at 37-40 °C.\nInduce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane, and then lower the isoflurane to 3%. Perform toe pinch tests periodically throughout the procedure to assess anesthesia adequacy.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in a right lateral decubitus position. Remove the hair of the upper-left chest/side body (see Figure 1A) by applying depilatory cream to the area. Dampen a piece of gauze or paper towel with water and wipe the hair and depilatory cream away. Repeat as necessary until all hair is removed from the surgical field.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave depilatory cream on the mouse for longer than 20 s, as this can damage the skin.\nTie a double knot ~3 mm above the base of a 22 G catheter with 2-0 silk suture. Leave 2-inch-long tails.\nIntubate the mouse with this catheter as previously described29,30. To confirm successful intubation, attach an inflation bulb to the end of the catheter and gently squeeze.\n\tNOTE: Mice that have been intubated successfully will experience bilateral chest rise with bulb squeeze.",
    "Tightly secure the 2-0 silk suture around the mouse's snout with a double knot to keep the intubation catheter in place.\n2. Surgery to expose the lung\nNOTE: Perform all steps of the surgery (Figure 1), including photoconversion, in a hood or laminar flow cabinet to avoid contamination of the surgical field.\nWash hands with antiseptic soap and don new sterile gloves.\n\tNOTE: As a tips-only technique is used for this surgery, non-sterile gloves may also be used. Sanitizing non-sterile gloves with an alcohol-based disinfectant is recommended.\nPrepare a 0.1 mg/kg dose of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/mL) and inject subcutaneously for analgesia.\n\tNOTE: Multimodal analgesia, including local pain blockers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should be used in conjunction with buprenorphine if they are not expected to interfere with the biology of interest.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both mouse eyes to prevent corneal damage.\nPlace the mouse in the right lateral decubitus position on the heated surgical platform.\nConnect the ventilator to the intubation catheter. Take care to hold the catheter steady, as even slight movements can disturb the catheter placement and lead to poor ventilation.\nObserve stable, ventilator-controlled, bilateral chest rise and fall.\nSecure the limbs to the surgical platform with labeling tape. Stabilize the surgical field by placing another piece of tape along the mouse's back and securing the dorsal skin and fur to the surgical platform (Figure 1A).\nOpen the sterilized surgical instruments.\nApply chlorhexidine solution to the mouse's skin to sterilize the surgical site.\nIdentify the area ~7 mm to the left of the sternum and ~7 mm above the subcostal margin. Lift the skin over this area with forceps and make a ~10 mm circular incision using sharp micro-dissecting scissors, taking care to cut only the skin.",
    "Remove the soft tissue over the ribcage (Figure 1B). Cauterize any major vessels at both ends with a cautery pen.\n\tNOTE: In addition to excising all soft tissue underlying the 10 mm circular incision in the skin, removing some additional non-muscular soft tissue from the perimeter facilitates future steps of the procedure.\nWith one hand, use forceps to elevate the 6th or 7th rib. With the other hand, use a single blade of the blunt micro-dissecting scissors - angled parallel to the chest wall, rounded edge facing down - and carefully pierce the 6th or 7th intercostal muscle to enter the thoracic cavity (Figure 1C). Gently rotate the scissors as needed and cut to make a ~10 mm incision in the intercostal space, taking care to avoid touching the lung tissue and cutting the ribs.\nDelicately discharge compressed air towards the intercostal incision to increase the space between the lung and the chest wall. Discharge the air first at one's wrist or hand to find the appropriate flow strength and clear the nozzle of any debris, then in short bursts at the incision to prevent lung injury.\nWith one hand, use forceps to elevate the 6th or 7th rib. With the other hand, hold the retractor shut and insert it into the intercostal incision. Orient the blades of the retractor such that they are parallel to the chest wall, taking care to avoid touching the lung itself (Figure 1D).\nOnce the retractor is in place, slowly release the handle, allowing the retractor to open and expose the lung (Figure 1E). Figure 2A shows representative images of exposed lung metastases prior to photoconversion, including what they look like to the naked eye, and in the FITC (green, non-photoconverted) and TRITC (red, photoconverted) fluorescent channels while using wide-field illumination.",
    "3. Lung metastasis photoconversion\nNOTE: Details and variations on the following steps can be found in the Discussion.\nGently apply 2-3 drops of sterile PBS warmed to 37 °C to the exposed lung tissue to prevent drying.\nPlace a piece of sterile aluminum foil with a small cutout over the mouse. Position the cutout directly over the exposed lung tissue and size it to expose only the open portion of the thorax and a few millimeters of surrounding soft tissue and skin to ensure photoconversion of only the exposed lung.\nPlace a box with a cutout over the mouse and aluminum foil. Ensure that the cutout is directly over the exposed lung.\nPlace the photoconversion lamp directly over the cutout on the box (Figure 1F).\nTurn on the photoconversion lamp and allow 6 min of continuous illumination of exposed lung tissue.\n\tNOTE: Monitor the mouse's vital signs using the physiologic monitoring programs on the ventilator.\nAfter photoconversion, turn off the lamp, and remove the lamp, box, and aluminum foil mask from the mouse.\n4. Procedure to close chest wall\nRepeat step 2.13 to separate the lung from the chest wall.\nCarefully take hold of the retractor handle and squeeze to close the blades.\nManeuver the closed retractor out of the intercostal space, taking care to avoid touching the lung tissue.\nUsing the 5-0 silk suture, close the intercostal incision with a simple continuous suture pattern that incorporates the rib on both sides of the incision (Figure 1G). Pull the suture tight to ensure that the wound edges are appositional and re-establish the integrity of the chest wall (Figure 1H). Take care not to overtighten the suture as this may tear the intercostal muscles.",
    "Secure the suture by knotting the two ends of the suture together 4x. Cut the suture tails as close to the knot as possible.\nClose the skin with surgical staples.\nRemove excess air from the thoracic cavity with a 1 mL insulin syringe with a 28 G needle attached. Locate the xiphoid process tactilely, and insert the needle just below, advancing toward the left shoulder to enter the thoracic cavity through the diaphragm. Draw back on the syringe to ~1 mL; remove the needle from the mouse and discharge the air from the syringe. Repeat this process 3-4x.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to puncture any internal organs. Furthermore, it is important to use a 1 mL syringe and repeat the procedure 3-4x rather than using a larger volume syringe and trying to remove all the air at once. Use of a larger volume syringe may result in too great of a vacuum in the thoracic cavity and lead to lung tissue distension and damage.\nTurn off the isoflurane.\nContinue ventilation with 100% oxygen until the mouse shows signs of awakening.\nOnce the mouse shows signs of awakening, disconnect the intubation catheter from the ventilator, cut the suture around the snout, and extubate the mouse.\nUntape the mouse and transfer it to a clean cage placed ~2 feet below a heat lamp. Monitor until fully recovered. If the mouse shows signs of breathing difficulty or lack of mobility, anesthetize it with 5% isoflurane for 5 min, ensure adequate anesthesia by observing a loss of reflexes upon toe pinch, and euthanize via cervical dislocation.\nOnce the mouse fully awakens from anesthesia and begins to move, prepare another 0.1 mg/kg dose of buprenorphine and inject it subcutaneously for postoperative analgesia.",
    "Following the surgery, ensure that the mice are housed individually. Provide antibiotics in the drinking water (enrofloxacin, final concentration 0.4 mg/mL).\nIn the 3 days following the surgery, check the mouse twice per day for signs of distress. For pain management, administer 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine (0.03 mg/mL) subcutaneously every 4-6 hours. Euthanize the mouse if it shows signs of infection, immobility, or breathing difficulty. After the third day, mice can be checked once per day.\n5. Sample processing and detection of photoconverted cells using tissue clearing\nBetween 3 and 5 days (or the desired length of time) after photoconversion surgery, anesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane, reduce isoflurane from 5% to 2.5% after induction, ensure adequate anesthesia by observing a loss of reflexes upon toe pinch, and perform a terminal transcardial perfusion with 10 mL of room-temperature PBS, followed by 10 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde chilled to 4 °C as previously described31.\nCollect the organs of interest and optically clear them as previously described31.\nImage the cleared tissues with a light sheet microscope as previously described31. Alternatively, place the cleared tissues in a glass bottom dish and image in the FITC and TRITC channels to visualize green (non-photoconverted) and red (photoconverted) cells using a confocal, spinning disk, or multiphoton microscope.\n6. Sample processing and detection of photoconverted cells using tissue disaggregation\nAnesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane for 5 min, ensure adequate anesthesia by observing a loss of reflexes upon toe pinch, and sacrifice via cervical dislocation 3-5 days after photoconversion.\nCollect and digest the organs of interest as previously described13.\nPlate the digested tissues and place them in an incubator to adhere overnight as previously described13.",
    "The following day, image the plated cells in the FITC and TRITC channels to visualize green (non-photoconverted) and red (photoconverted) cells as previously described13.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
