    "1. Generation of Confocal Images\nIn preparation for the analysis of modified forms of cytosine, perform immunohistochemical staining as described by Abakir et al.34.\nCarry out imaging of slides out using a microscope and save files in an LSM format.\n\tNOTE: When comparing intensity profiles between samples the values used for laser power and gain for each channel must be maintained throughout the image taking procedure to allow for direct comparison at the image analysis stage.\n2. Generation of 2.5D Intensity Plots\nOpen the software (e.g., Zen Black) and select 'Image Processing'.\nGo to the File menu and select Open. Select the image that requires processing.\nClick on 'Show All' below the image to make all graphical controls visible. In the lower half of the screen there are three tabs; 'Dimensions', 'Display' and 'Graphics', select the 'Graphics' tab.\nChoose the 'rectangle' tool to select nuclei/area of interest.\nSelect 'Cut region' to crop the image. This will generate a new image for the cropped region in a separate tab.\nGo to the File menu and select Save As. Give the file a name and save it as an LSM or CZI file.\nOpen software (e.g., Zen Blue) and select the 'Zen Desk'.\nSend the cropped image from Zen Black to Zen Blue by selecting the file and clicking on the File menu and select Send to Zen 2012-blue edition. The cropped image will then open in the relevant program.\n\tNOTE: The image file is transferred because the 2.5D intensity plot feature in Zen Black 2012 does not display multiple channel images simultaneously.\nOn the left hand side of the image choose the tab labelled '2.5D', this enables visualization of the image in 2.5D. Click 'Show All' to make all graphical controls visible.",
    "Alter visualization settings using four grey bars situated to the left and below the image.\n\tNOTE: Left hand bar, top of the screen = zoom. Left hand bar, bottom of the screen = turn image on axis. Bottom of screen, left hand bar = rotation of image. Bottom of screen, right hand bar = expand and contract scale bars.\nEnsure that render mode selected is surface as this gives the best visualization of the individual peaks.\nAlter grid distance by changing the percentage, the lower the percentage the more defined each individual peak.\nTo save the 2.5D image, first hide the file list on the right side and the graphical tools below the image by clicking on the grey arrow below the 2.5D plot (next to 'show all'), this will hide the graphical tabs allowing for the image to expand to fill the screen. To save the 2.5D plot, press the 'PrtSc' key on the keyboard. This will capture a screenshot of the display. Paste the screenshot in Microsoft Paint and crop the image before saving.\n3. Intensity Profiling\nOpen the software (e.g., Zen Black) and select Image Processing.\nGo to the File menu and select Open. Select the image that requires processing.\nAS the image will appear on the screen, on the left hand side of the image select the tab labelled 'Profile'.\nIn the lower half of the screen select (tick) the 'Show All' tab. This will enable access to all formatting options.\nIn the lower half of the screen there are three tabs; 'Dimensions', 'Display' and 'Profile'; select 'Profile' and select (tick) the 'Table' box. Select the 'Arrow' button.",
    "On the image use the mouse to select a start point and drag the mouse over a continuous number of cells. Release the mouse to produce an intensity plot for the cells along the line; additionally the table will be populated by intensity measurement data for the pixels along the line for each wavelength.\n\tNOTE: The table will provide the distance (µm) at which pixel intensity is read for the red, green and blue fluorescence.\nTo export this data, right click on the table, select 'Save table…' and save to an appropriate location as a .txt file.\nTo save the selected intensity profile image select the File menu and select 'Export…'. In the pop-up window choose 'Tagged Image File (Format)' and 'Contents of Image Window - single pane (Data)' followed by clicking 'Select file name and save…' choose an appropriate location and click 'Save'.\nRepeat the process for each individual Intensity profile depending on the fields of vision and number of profiles to analyze.\nImport intensity profiles data saved (see 3.7) and analyze in a spreadsheet followed by statistical analysis.\n4. Co-localization Analysis\nOpen the software and select 'Image processing'.\nGo to the File menu and select Open. Select the image that requires processing.\nAs the image will appear on the screen, on the left hand side of the image select the tab labelled 'Coloc'.\nIn the lower half of the screen select (tick) the 'Show All' tab. This will enable access to all formatting options.\nIn the lower half of the screen there are four tabs; 'Dimensions', 'Display', 'Graphics' and 'Colocalization'; select 'Colocalization' and tick the box for 'Table' and 'Image'.",
    "Select the third icon along at the top of this tab (Close Bezier text will appear when the mouse hovers over the tool) then use this tool to encircle a single nuclei, values for this nuclei will then appear in the table.\n\t\tNOTE: For each encircled nuclei a scatter plot is produced for red versus green fluorescence which is visualized in the left hand panel on the screen. The axis is then moved in order to gate out cells depending on the threshold. As the nuclei of interest are selected manually in the images, adjusting the gating thresholds above zero is not required. All pixel intensity values observed within the nuclear perimeters are considered as positive signal.\nRepeat this process by selecting the third icon in the tab and encircling subsequent nuclei until the dataset is completed.\nTo export this data, right click on the table, select save table and save to an appropriate location.\nTo save the colocalization image, select the File menu and select 'Export…' then choose; Tagged Image File (Format) and 'Contents of Image Window – single plane (Data)' followed by clicking 'Select file name and save…', choose an appropriate location and click 'Save'.\nPlot colocalization data in a spreadsheet followed by statistical analysis."
