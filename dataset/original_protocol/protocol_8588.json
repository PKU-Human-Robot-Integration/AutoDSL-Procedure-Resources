    "1. The CAFE Assay\nNOTE: The assay consists of three components: an experimental vial, a specific lid and micro- capillaries. A plastic box with cover is used to transport the prepared vials and to control the humidity more efficiently.\nUse a Drosophila melanogaster culture plastic vial (optional 8 cm height, 3.3 cm diameter) as a tube for the assay.\nSeal the vial with a manufactured Plexiglas lid containing an O-ring (Figures 1A, 1B). Load flies by tapping or with a blowpipe through the lid's central opening (0.9 cm diameter), which also allows for air circulation and water supply, and close the hole with a sponge bung. Six smaller conical openings (0.4 cm upper diameter, 0.3 cm inner diameter) surround the central hole and fit the pipette tips of 2 - 20 µL volume to hold the capillaries in place. (see supplementary figures for technical details of the lid.)\n\tNOTE: The use of a sponge stopper with openings for the capillaries instead of the custom-made lid used in our manuscript is possible. Our customized lid allows safe handling of the prepared vials minimizing the risk of capillaries falling down.\nTo present the liquid food, use 5 µL microcapillaries with 1 µL marks. Position the capillaries in the conical openings in the lid by cutting off the top of a 2 - 20 µL pipette tip and inserting the tip into the hole (Figure 1B, marked with red edge). To prevent flies from escaping, insert an uncut 2 - 20 µL pipette tip into the same opening.\nTo safely handle multiple prepared vials, place them into a plastic box with a gridded inlay (Figure 2A).\n2. Preparation of Flies\nKeep flies on standard food at 25 °C, 60% relative humidity and a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle.",
    "To control breeding conditions, introduce 35 virgin females and 15 males for each experimental group into a plastic culture vial (9.8 cm height, 4.8 cm diameter) containing 50 mL fly food. Allow flies to lay eggs for the first 3 days, then transfer adult flies to fresh food vials and let them lay eggs for two more days. After this repeat the transfer again. Discard adult flies after 2 more days.\nAs food intake is dependent on fly size, determine the weight of a group of 100 flies by anesthetizing 2- to 3-day-old adult flies using a CO2 fly pad and collect them into a 1.5 mL plastic tube and measuring with a standard laboratory scale. Determine the wet weight of at least four independent fly groups sorted by sex (Table 1); use the weight to calculate µL food consumption per mg fly. Use the value to determine the amount of food that a single fly feeds per experiment and adjust the number of food-filled capillaries accordingly to avoid emptying of the capillaries by feeding.\n\t\nFor a 3 h assay, use 20 flies and two filled capillaries. For a long-term experiment (> 3 h and up to 9 days), use a group of eight flies with a supply of four filled capillaries (reliable results cannot be obtained with less than eight flies under the described conditions).\nSeparate flies into groups (8 or 20 flies) after measuring weight under CO2 exposure. Transfer the group to a new food vial (containing 15 mL standard food) to allow recovery from CO2 sedation for 48 h prior to the experiment. Use 4- to 6-day-old flies for the CAFE assay.",
    "As non-starved wild-type flies feed only marginally19, 21, pre-starve flies for 3 h feeding experiments. No fasting is required when food consumption is monitored over several days. For fasting, transfer flies 16 to 20 h prior to testing by gently tapping them into a vial containing only a 45-mm diameter folded filter paper moistened with ~0.5 mL ddH2O (double-distilled water), and close with a plugged CAFE assay lid.\n3. Preparation of Liquid Food\nPrepare a 3 M (10%, w/v) sucrose stock solution by filling 102.6 g sucrose (C12H22O11) to 100 mL ddH2O. Pipette 3 µL, 33 µL, 333 µL, 3.3 mL and 6.6 mL of the stock solution into a 15 mL plastic tube; add 2 mL of food color (for red: Cochineal [E124]; for blue: Indigo carmine [E132]) and fill to 10 mL with ddH2O. The resulting concentrations are 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 2 M sucrose.\n\tNOTE: The food dye allows visualizing the meniscus more easily. However the dye might have an impact on the food intake. To avoid a bias due to the dye dispense the food dye or randomized the usage of dyes to the food samples during the experiment and groups.\nTo test for alcohol preference pipette 333 µL of the 3 M sucrose stock solution in a 15 mL plastic tube. Add 1.5 mL (2.3 mL) of 100% EtOH (ethanol) and add ddH2O up to 10 mL to result in 15% (0.25 mM) and a 23% (0.39 mM) working solutions.\nKeep stock solutions at -20 °C and working solutions at 4 °C; use within 1 week.",
    "Fill up to 10 capillaries at the same time with a colored food solution, by capillary force. Insert the ends of the capillaries into the sucrose solution (holding the capillaries at a 45° angle to the solution). Stop if the liquid reaches the top (5 µL) mark of the capillary, and remove excess solution on the outside and inside with tissue paper.\n4. Assembly and Performing the CApillary FEeder Assay\nIf fasting is not needed, transfer the experimental flies to the assay by tapping or by blow-pipe. Make sure to include three control vials without flies to quantify evaporation.\nCarefully remove a pipette tip (2 - 20 µL volume) that is closing one of the outer openings, and insert a filled glass capillary, bottom-end first. Secure the capillary by placing the pipette tip back next to the capillary. If several food solutions are being tested, repeat this procedure accordingly.\nPlace the capillary ends inside all vials at the same level to avoid bias that could occur if the food sources were located at different heights (3 - 4 cm from the lid); keep a distance to the filter paper to prevent the capillary from leaking by accidently touching the filter paper or different viscosities of food sources.\nLabel the upper end of the colored liquid using a marker pen (markbeginning). To ensure the different capillaries can be identified, label them individually using a color or stripe code.\nPlace multiple prepared CAFE assays inside a plastic box with gridded inlay and transfer the box (Figure 2A) to a secure position under laboratory conditions or in a temperature-, light- and humidity-controlled climate chamber (parameters: 25 °C, 60% relative humidity, 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle) for the experimental period (e.g. 3 h or days).",
    "As bottom filter paper dries out if the assay is performed over several days, apply fresh water every 24 h via the sponge bung (100 µL) to keep humidity constant inside the assay. Use four separate vials (8 cm height, 3.3 cm diameter) filled with 30 mL ddH2O as humidity devices and place them next to the CAFE assays in the plastic box. Use a cover for the plastic box to create humidity controlled environment during the experiment (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: Broader variability occurs under laboratory conditions; however, it is feasible to perform the CAFE assay at room temperature (e.g., in a classroom). The use of a humidification device (filter paper, with or without a wet sponge bung, filled water vials and cover for the plastic box) is highly encouraged to decrease evaporation (Figure 2B).\nReplace the capillaries with freshly filled ones for long term experiments every 24 h. Make note of dead flies before each 24 h interval and use the number of live flies to calculate consumption per fly for the following period. Discard the old capillaries after measuring the decline of the meniscus (see 5.1).\n\tNOTE: During a 3 h experiment we hardly see any dead flies. During a 4 days study we usually find 1 - 3 dead flies.\nAt the end of the assay or before replacing the capillary, mark the lower meniscus of the capillary (markend) with a marker pen while the CAFE assay is still in the upright position. Discard the data if markend is not below the initial mark (markbeginning). Do not remove the lid, as this might change the meniscus.",
    "Carefully remove the capillaries from the assay and store them for data collection. Check if the liquid inside the capillary reached the lower end if not discard the data, as food was not accessible to the flies. Collect all capillaries per vial as a group. Insert uncut pipette tips into all openings to prevent flies from escaping. Dismantle the setup and wash the vials, lids and sponge bungs in a soap bath and dry overnight at room temperature for further use.\n\tNOTE: Flies can be further analyzed after the assay. Confirm food uptake by eye or under a dissection microscope.\nRepeat experiments with the same genotypes on at least three different days.\n5. Data Collection and Analysis\nMeasure the distance between markbeginning and markend on the capillary using a caliper or a ruler. To transfer data directly to a spreadsheet, use a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connected digital caliper (Figure 1E). Discard the capillaries after the measurement.\nAccount for capillary size to calculate food uptake or evaporation. For example, consider a capillary that is 73 mm long and contains 5 µL of food solution. A 14.6 mm decrease in the meniscus reflects the uptake of 1 µL solution. Calculate food uptake using the following formula:\n\tFood uptake (µL) = measured distance (mm)/ 14.6 mm\nTo exclude the effect of evaporation on food intake, calculate mean evaporation in the three (at minimum) control vials without flies. Subtract this mean value from the value obtained for food consumption by the flies.\nUse the following formula to determine total consumption per fly:\n\tFood consumption (µL) = (Food uptake [µL] - Evaporative loss [µL])/total number of flies in the vial. For long-term experiments use the number of flies alive before the start of the 24 h interval.",
    "To account for differences in body size, such as between male and female flies, normalize food consumption to body weight (µL food/mg fly).\nUse statistical software for data analysis. For normally distributed data, use student's T-tests to determine differences between two fly groups, and use ANOVA (analysis of variance) with post hoc Tukey Cramer tests for more than two groups. In a choice situation, analyze differences from random choice using a nonparametric one-sample sign test.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
