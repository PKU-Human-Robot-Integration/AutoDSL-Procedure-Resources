    "All animal procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the National Law N° 18611 for Care of Animals Used for Experimental Purposes. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (CEUA IIBCE, Protocol Number 004/09/2015).\n1. Muscle dissection (Day 1)\nNOTE: Before starting, make 40 mL of 0.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA), pH 7.4 in Dulbecco´s phosphate saline (DPBS). Optionally, make 20 mL of 4% PFA. Prepare 5 mL aliquots and freeze at -20 °C. On the day of dissection, defrost a 4% aliquot and add 35 mL of DPBS to obtain 40 mL of 0.5% PFA.\nIsolation of EDL (fast-twitch muscle)\nEuthanize a rat. Place the animal with the abdomen facing upwards. Make an initial incision using a surgical blade between the toes towards the hind limb.\n\t\tNOTE: In this case, an intraperitoneal injection of 90:10 mg/Kg ketamine:xylazine was given to euthanize the rat, but other options of anesthesia are also allowed.\nPeel off the skin, pulling it upwards until the rat knee is exposed.\nTo find the EDL, follow the foot tendons up to the annular ligament. This ligament circles two tendons. Cut the ligament between the two tendons with uniband scissors (or similar). Identify the EDL tendon by lifting both and choose the one that makes the toes move upwards.\nCut the tendon with uniband scissors. Then, while holding the tendon with fine biological tweezers, begin to slowly separate the EDL muscle from the tibialis anterior, the peroneus brevis, and peroneus longus40 (see Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the muscle is separated without any damage. Do this by cutting the rest of the lateral muscles to open a path between them (the EDL does not have a superficial location) while holding and lifting the EDL muscle.",
    "To completely isolate the muscle, cut the tendon attached to the rat knee with uniband scissors.\nImmerse the dissected muscle in 5 mL of 0.5% PFA and leave for 24 h at 4 °C. Optionally, staple the muscle in a piece of cardboard and turn it with the muscle facing down. Then immerse it completely in 8 mL of the fixative solution. This step helps in maintaining the muscle elongated during the fixation process.\nIsolation of soleus (slow-twitch muscle)\nFlip the animal (the abdomen is now facing downwards). Through the skin, cut the calcaneal tendon using a surgical blade.\nWith the help of the biological tweezers and uniband scissors, separate the gastrocnemius muscle from the bones, creating a \"muscular lid\". The soleus will be on the internal side of the muscular lid. It can be identified because it is red in color and has a flat morphology.\nWith a pair of biological tweezers, reach and lift the soleus tendon that lies above the gastrocnemius (see Figure 1B).\nCut the tendon with uniband scissors. Lift the whole muscle while cutting some of the weak attachment points (i.e., neurovascular elements). Finally, to completely free the soleus muscle, cut the soleus fascicle that forms the calcaneal tendon with uniband scissors.\nRepeat step 1.1.6 to fix dissected soleus muscle.\n2. Teased fiber preparation (Day 2)\nAfter 24 h of fixation, rinse the muscles with 6 mL of DPBS solution 3x for 10 min each before isolating the muscle fibers.",
    "To isolate the fibers, put a muscle on a microscope slide. Using a stereomicroscope, gently hold one of the tendons with one pair of biological tweezers. Then, with the other biological tweezers, begin to pinch the tendon slowly to separate the muscle fibers. After that slowly pull the pinched tissue upwards towards the opposite muscle tendon. It will be necessary to repeat this action several times until obtaining multiple small, isolated bundles.\nPlace them carefully on a pre-treated slide (silanized). It is necessary to keep all the fibers in order so that they do not overlap. At this point, air-dry the fibers for 24 h.\n3. Immunofluorescence\nPrimary antibody incubation (Day 3)\n\tNOTE: All steps were performed at room temperature, except if otherwise stated. The most efficient way to remove the different solutions without detaching fibers from the slide is to use an insulin syringe.\n\t\nTo start the immunostaining process, encircle the dried isolated muscle fibers with a pap pen to create a waterproof barrier.\nTo hydrate the muscle fibers, add 200 µL of distilled water for 5 min, and then change the water to 200 µL of DPBS for the next 5 min incubation. At this point, start the immunofluorescence labeling.\nIncubate fibers with 300 µL of a blocking buffer (BB) containing 50 mM glycine, 1% BSA, and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min.\nReplace BB with the primary antibody at a concentration suggested by manufacturers. Use the BB to dilute the antibody. This experiment used 400 µL of SMI 32 or SMI 31 that recognized non-phosphorylated (Nf) or phosphorylated (Phos-Nf) neurofilament H at 1/800 dilution to detect the NMJ presynaptic component.\n\t\tNOTE: When deciding to recognize the whole presynaptic element instead of evaluating neurofilament phosphorylation, choose antibodies against synapsin, synaptophysin or SV2a that were previously successfully employed.",
    "Incubate the fibers with the primary antibody dilution at 4 °C overnight (optionally, incubation can be performed at 37 °C for 1 h). In both cases, it will be important to perform the incubation using a humid chamber.\nImmunofluorescence: Secondary antibody incubation (Day 4)\nRemove the primary antibody and rinse the fibers 3x for 10 min each with 500 µL of DPBS and the last time with BB.\nRemove this last wash and add the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody diluted in BB. For this experiment, 500 µL of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 at 1/1000 dilution in BB was used. To view the postsynaptic element of the NMJs, 1:300 α-Bungarotoxin (Btx) biotin-XX conjugate was added to the secondary antibody dilution.\n\t\t​NOTE: The addition of Btx-biotin XX allows better signal-to-noise images once detected with streptavidin that amplifies the signal. In addition, streptavidin conjugation to different fluorophores increased color combinations in co-labeling assays. Alternatively, fluorescently labeled Btx allows obtaining images of similar quality.\nIncubate the secondary antibody and the Btx for 2 h at room temperature or 1 h at 37 °C protected from light.\nRemove the secondary antibody and the Btx. Wash 3x for 10 min each with 500 µL of DPBS and the last rinse with BB.\nIncubate with 500 µL of Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 555 at 1/1000 dilution with BB for 1 h at room temperature. At this point, if desired, add a probe to counterstain the nuclei, such as diaminophenylindole at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL.\nRemove the incubation solution and wash fibers 3x for 10 min each with 500 µL of DPBS. Then, mount the fibers.\nMounting",
    "Place 4 dots of transparent nail polish on the microscope slide as if they were the vertices of a square. Let them dry 1-2 min. These will be the points where the coverslips will rest, helping to avoid tissue crushing.\nRemove the last DPBS wash and add enough mounting media (~ 200 µL) to cover the fibers; avoid drying.\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare 10 mL of the mounting media mix, use Tris-HCl 1,5 M pH 8,8: glycerol in a 4:1 (v:v).\nUse a 200 µL pipette tip to carefully spread the mounting media over the fibers to ensure a complete immersion of all of them. Before placing the cover glass, remove air bubbles.\nPlace the coverslip onto the samples trying to prevent the generation of air bubbles. This movement can be done with the aid of forceps.\n4. Microscopy and morphometric analysis\nImage the teased fiber preparations using laser confocal microscopy.\nTake a series of optical sections (30 µm Z stacks) across the entire synapse using a one-micrometer interval. To set the stack, use the Btx signal. Image at least 15-20 NMJs for each muscle condition with a 2048 px x 2048 px resolution. This method was chosen to obtain images with sufficient optical quality and resolution for the morphometric analysis.\nTo perform the measurements, use the projection images of stacks with any analysis software.\n\tNOTE: Although the explained morphometric analysis was done manually, there are two recently developed Image J-based tools for studying many different aspects of pre and postsynaptic NMJ morphology33,34.",
    "To obtain the Total NMJ area values, select the external border (external outline of the stained area, see Figure 2) of the endplate using the Photoshop Magnetic lasso tool and determine the number of selected pixels in the Histogram window. Then, the pixel areas can be converted to square micrometers using the scale specified by the confocal software.\nWith the same lasso tool, select the internal border (outlines of the stained area within the endplate, see Figure 2) and determine the non-stained area in the whole structure (or empty area) as detailed above (step 4.4.). The Postsynaptic Area values will be obtained after subtracting the total area from the empty area of each NMJ.\nObtain the Presynaptic Area, that is defined as the area with anti-neurofilament immunofluorescence, in a similar way that the Total NMJ area.\n\tNOTE: All these parameters were used to determine the Post-Synaptic Density index (Postsynaptic Area/Total Area) and the NMJ Coverage (Presynaptic Area/Postsynaptic Area). A higher Postsynaptic Density index implies a denser -or more compact- endplate, whereas a smaller NMJ Coverage reflects a much poorer interaction between nerve terminal and endplate (both compatible with a denervation process). In the case shown here, since phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of neurofilaments were detected at the nerve terminal level, the phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated presynaptic signal ratio and the phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated coverage ratio were calculated.\nSubscription Required.
