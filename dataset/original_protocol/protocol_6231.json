Set the protocol to transfer 40 nl of compound in DMSO from the source plate to each well on the destination plate.

Set the protocol to deliver 6 technical replicate wells for each test compound, and 12-16 technical replicate wells for the positive control and 12-16 technical replicate wells for the negative control (DMSO only). We discovered a compound in house that increased Hb9-GFP+ mMN survival in the co-culture assay, which we will refer to as compound A, and used that as our positive control. For a comprehensive dose response of select test compounds, we recommend testing a 7-point dose response at every half-log, i.e., 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 µM.Write an ‘Hb9-GFP MN’ protocol for imaging the Hb9-GFP+ motor neurons on the In Cell Analyzer 2000 software.
