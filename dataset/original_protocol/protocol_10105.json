    "All methods described here have been approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board.\n1. Participants and acquisition system set up\nObtain informed consent from participants.\n\tNOTE: Participants should either be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disorder, or should not be diagnosed with any neurological disorder to serve as healthy control participants. Healthy participants should be gender and age matched to the patient participants. All participants should have the mobility to continuously walk for 5 minutes.\nMeasure the participant’s body dimension (body height, foot length, arm span, ankle height, hip height, hip width, knee height, shoulder width, shoulder height; Figure 2A) to later create his/her body avatar in the motion capture system.\n\tNOTE: This information is used in the motion capture system to accurately record positional data of the participant’s body.\nSet up the motion capture system, including the 17 wireless motion-tracking sensors and motion-tracking software.\n\t\nPlace sensors on the following body parts: head, sternum, pelvis, right shoulder, right upper arm, right lower arm, right hand, left shoulder, left upper arm, left lower arm, left hand, right upper leg, right lower leg, right foot, left upper leg, left lower leg, left foot (Figure 2B). Secure these sensors with strap bands to allow for unobtrusive movement.\nOnce all sensors are placed at proper places, calibrate the participant’s position to create his/her avatar.\n\t\tNOTE: Details on calibration method can be found in Roetenberg et al.9.\nSet up EEG device and EEG recording software.\n\t\nPosition 31 sensors across the scalp and the recording device on the back of the participant’s head. Place channel sensors on the following locations: P7, P4, Cz, Pz, P3, P8, O1, O2, T8, F8, C4, F4, Fp2, Fz, C3, F3, Fp1, T7, F7, PO4, FC6, FC2, AF4, CP6, CP2, CP1, CP5, FC1, FC5, AF3, PO3 (Figure 2C).",
    "Attach the remaining channel sensor (Oz) to a connector to measure the heart signal, by positioning that connected sensor on the participant’s left-side stomach (Figure 2C).\nAttach two reference channel sensors behind the participant’s left ear, and then insert electrode gel into the sensors on the EEG cap using a syringe (Figure 2C).\nOnce completed, start streaming the electrical activities on the recording software for a few minutes until it stabilizes.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 2D shows sample traces from the EEG signals harnessed from the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS).\nSet up microphone to capture the participant’s voice. Place the microphone in front of the participant and connect it to the computer where lab stream layer (LSL) will be running (see LSL below) (Figure 2E).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59827/59827fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Set up to digitize traditional clinical tests, while integrating multiple waveforms from unobtrusive wireless wearable biosensors.

    "NOTE: The Mouse app will be used to timestamp events during the experiment.\nLink EEG, motion, and audio streams to the Lab Recorder app by checking the boxes AudioCaptureWin, LSL-EEG, Position in the Record from Streams section.\n\t\tNOTE: The LSL system enables a unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments that handles time-synchronization, along with networking and real-time access, and centralized collection, viewing and disk recording of the data. In the context of this protocol, the LSL system synchronously streams from the CNS, peripheral nervous system (PNS) and ANS, as the person naturally performs traditional clinical tasks.\nSet up recording for pen movement, including pen tablet and movement analysis software (Figure 3B).\n\t\nPlace the drawing tablet and tablet pen in front of the participant.\nConnect the tablet to the computer from which movement analysis software will be recording.\nPlace a white paper on the tablet and secure with a tape.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare in advance the papers to show a box to indicate space where the participant would be drawing in.\nStart recording.\n\t\nPress record in LSL, motion capture software, and EEG recording software.\nAt the start and end of each task, timestamp with mouse clicks by pressing on the timestamping button on the motion capture software.\n\t\tNOTE: This way, timestamps will be recorded in both LSL stream data and in the motion capture data. This will ensure that there is a back-up timestamp, in case one of the timestamping functions fails during recording.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59827/59827fig3.jpg",

Experimental procedure\nConduct task 1 — Benson Complex Figure Copy (Immediate)10 (1 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to copy the Benson figure on the paper, and to remember the design because the participant will be asked to draw it again from memory later.\n\t\tNOTE: This test is designed to assess the participant’s visuo-constructional and visual memory function (Figure 4A).\nConduct tasks 2 and 3 — Trail Making Test Part A (3 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to draw a line between circles that are numbered in ascending order.\n\t\tNOTE: There are two tasks in this section, where the first (task 2) is to complete a sample test (consisting of 8 numbers), and the next (task 3) is to complete the actual test (consisting of 25 numbers). This test was a component of the Army Individual Test Battery11, and assesses processing speed and executive function and depends on visuomotor and perceptual-scanning skills (Figure 4B).\nConduct tasks 4 and 5 — Trail Making Test Part B (5 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to draw a line between circles that contain either numbers or letters, in ascending order, while alternating between numbers and letters. For example, the sequence would be: A to 1; 1 to B; B to 2; 2 to C.",
    "NOTE: There are two tasks in this section, where the first (task 4) is to complete a sample test (consisting of 4 numbers and 4 letters), and the next (task 5) is to complete the actual test (consisting of 13 numbers and 12 letters). Trail Making Test Part B is similar to Trail Making Test Part A, but requires more cognitive flexibility as the participant shifts from number to letter sets. (Figure 4B).\nConduct task 6 — Clock Drawing (1 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to draw an analog clock with numbers 1 through 12 and set the time to 10 past 11.\n\t\tNOTE: This test is part of the MoCA12 and assesses the participant’s visuo-constructional skills. (Figure 4C).\nConduct task 7 — Benson Complex Figure Copy (Delayed)10 (1 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to draw the Benson complex figure from memory on a blank piece of paper.\n\t\tNOTE: This test assesses the participant’s visuo-constructional and visual memory function. (Figure 4A).\nConduct tasks 8 and 9 — Number Span Test (Forward and Backward)13 (10 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to repeat the numbers that the experimenter reads out loud.\nFor task 8 (forward), instruct the participant to repeat the numbers in the same order, and for task 9 (backward), to repeat them in the reverse order. For both tests, there are two trials per sequence length ranging from 3 to 9 digits for the forward, and 2 to 8 digits for the backward test. Continue testing until two number strings at the same length are failed.",
    "NOTE: Both tests measure the capacity to briefly hold information, but the backward test (task 9) also measures the ability to manipulate the numbers and reverse the sequence. As such, in the context of the present protocol, this task measures a memory and a cognitive component in relation to the voice biorhythms output.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59827/59827fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Towards clinically informed digital biomarkers and scoring cards: Digitization of traditional clinical tests to enable integration of clinical criteria and digital biophysical data.

(B) Trail A task involving numbers to be connected by a line in an ascending order (top), and Trail B task involving alternating between letters and numbers (bottom). (C) Drawing a clock with instructions to set time to 10 past 11. For all sample traces, gray lines represent the trajectory of pen lifts during the drawing task, and blue lines represent the actual pen drawings. For analysis, we examine both types of trajectories.

    "NOTE: The pointing task allows for separating the participant’s motion by deliberate (forward movement, from the time the hand is resting until the hand reaches the target) and spontaneous (backward movement, from the time the hand is touching the target until the hand reaches back to its resting position) segments, thereby analyzing the biophysical signals when the participant is exerting voluntary control (deliberate motion), and when the participant is exerting little control (spontaneous motion) (Figure 5A). By introducing the metronome beats and requiring the participant to pace the pointing at the metronome beat, comparison can be made of the biophysical signals when the participant is moving at a self-paced manner, and when the participant is actively controlling the movement pace to an external beat.\nConduct tasks 13, 14, and 15 — Walking (25 min).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to walk naturally for 5 minutes under three different conditions.\nFor task 13 (control), instruct the participant to walk naturally around the room.\nFor task 14 (metronome), instruct the participant to walk naturally around the room while setting the metronome to beat in the background for 12 bpm.\nFor task 15 (paced breathing), instruct the participant to walk naturally around the room while he/she paces the breathing rate to the metronome beat set at 12 bpm.\n\t\tNOTE: By introducing the metronome beat, comparison can be made of the biophysical signals while the participant is using the entire body to move and breathe at a self-paced manner, and when the participant is actively controlling the breathing pace (which usually occurs automatically) while moving the entire body (Figure 5B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59827/59827fig5.jpg",
