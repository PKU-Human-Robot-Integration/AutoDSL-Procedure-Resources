    "The human fibroblasts used in this study were obtained from a skin punch biopsy after getting informed consent and ethical clearance by the ethics committee of the University of Würzburg, Germany (ethical report no: 96/11 dated 10.06.2011).\n1. Punch Biopsy\nDisinfect skin of patient. Anesthetize skin part of which biopsy will be taken from (preferentially a less sun-exposed area) using 0.5 to 1 ml mepivacaine hydrochloride intracutaneously and prepare skin biopsy using a sterile 3mm biopsy punch, rinse biopsy with DPBS + 1 µl/1ml Gentamicin and remove fat. Rinse biopsy twice with DPBS + Gentamicin, aspirate DPBS completely and cover biopsy with Dispase II (2.4 U/ml) and incubate 16 - 18 hr at 4 °C.\nAspirate Dispase completely, wash twice with DPBS and remove epidermis with tweezers. Wash biopsy twice with DPBS, add 2 ml Collagenase Type 2 (500 U/ml CDU), transfer in 15 ml tube and add Collagenase up to 5 ml total volume. Incubate for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 180 x g and discard supernatant afterwards. Resuspend pellet in 10 ml DMEM-FCS-Gentamicin-media (10% FCS, 1 µl/ml Gentamicin) and centrifuge again for 5 min at 180 x g. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1.5 ml DMEM-FCS-Gentamicin-media. Transfer to T25 adherent tissue culture flask and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange media every 3 days.\nAfter approximately 2 weeks, when cells are confluent around skin parts, split cells using Trypsin/EDTA (0.05%): wash cells once with DPBS, incubate 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 after addition of 2 ml Trypsin/EDTA (0.05%), add 2 ml of DMEM-FCS-Gentamicin-media, transfer to 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 180 x g for 5 min; discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in appropriate amount of DMEM-FCS-Gentamicin-media.",
    "Further expand the cells by changing the medium every 3rd day and splitting as described above when cells are confluent; addition of Gentamicin can be stopped after passage 2.\nBefore using the cells for direct conversion experiments, make sure to exclude mycoplasma contamination by standard assays.\nWhen cells have been expanded, you may directly start conversion or freeze cells down using 10% DMSO and 90% FCS. Cells should be stored in -80 °C for 2 days and then transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nFor preparation of conversion, wash cells once with DPBS, aspirate DPBS and add 2.5 ml Trypsin/EDTA (0.05%). Keep for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Tap flask gently to detach cells, resuspend in 2.5 ml of fibroblast media (DMEM incl. L-Glu + 10% FCS + 1% NEAA + 1% Sodium pyruvate) and transfer to 15 ml tube. Centrifuge at 180 x g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend cells in 1 ml fibroblast media  and pipette up and down to generate single cell suspension.\nCount the number of cells using a Fuchs-Rosenthal- or Neubauer-cell counting chamber and plate 3 x 104 cells per well of a 24 well-plate. Incubate O/N at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n2. Infection of Human Fibroblasts with Sendai Virus and Transdifferentiation\nNOTE: To ensure safety, the following steps handling virus have to be performed in a biological safety cabinet and a laminar flow hood, and with appropriate personal safety equipment, especially a surgical mask, to prevent mucosal exposure.",
    "Switch cells to 100 µl fibroblast media (Step 1.9). Thaw aliquots of Oct4-, Klf4-, Sox2- and c-myc-Sendai virus and resuspend each virus in 1 ml fibroblast media. Add each virus with a MOI of 3 to cells (virus titer varies from lot to lot, but one aliquot of each virus can generally be used for infection of 10 wells of a 24 well-plate) and mix gently. Incubate O/N at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 hr aspirate the medium and add 500 µl of neuroinduction media (1:1 DMEM/F-12 : Neurobasal, 1x N2, 1x B27, 1% GlutaMAX, 10 ng/ml hLIF, 3 µM CHIR99021, 2 µM SB431542) and culture at 39 °C, 5% CO2 from now on. Change the media every other day.\nOn day 6 after infection prepare laminin-coated 6-well-plates: dilute laminin to 1 µg/ml in DPBS, add 1 ml of solution onto 6 well-plates and keep at 4 °C for 24 hr.\nOn day 7 after infection split the cells using DPBS/EDTA: aspirate the media and wash cells once with DPBS, then add 500 µl of DPBS/EDTA and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAdd 500 µl of DMEM/F12 and remove suspension from plate in a 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 180 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of neuroinduction media, plate on laminin-coated 6 well-plates and add ROCK inhibitor Y27632 in a final concentration of 10 µM to the cells, culture at 39 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange the media every other day.\nFrom day 14 after infection culture the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Neuroepithelial colonies become apparent around day 17 after infection by phase contrast microscopy. They should be large enough to be picked around day 20 after infection.",
    "3. Isolation of Putative iNPC Colonies\nOne day before picking, coat one 48 well-plate with laminin: dilute laminin to 1 µg/ml in DPBS, add 300 µl of solution onto plates and keep at 4 °C for 24 hr. One day later aspirate laminin from plates and add 200 µl of neuroinduction media to the wells.\nWash the 6 well-plates containing the colonies to be picked once with DPBS and add 2 ml DPBS per well of 6 well-plate. Pick the colonies mechanically: scrape around colonies using a thin needle to get rid of surrounding cells; set the 200 µl pipetman on 50 µl and pick the colonies using the respective pipette tips.\nTransfer one colony each into one well of a laminin-coated 48 well-plate and generate a single cell suspension mechanically by pipetting up and down 10 times. Add ROCK inhibitor Y27632 in a final concentration of 10 µM to the cells.\nGrow the cells on the 48 well-plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 days. Change the media every second day until cells reach 80 - 90% confluency (approx. 3 - 4 days).\n4. Expansion and Cryo-preservation of iNPCs\nPassaging and Expansion of iNPCs\n\t\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells with DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS and add 200 µl DPBS/EDTA and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2, add 200 µl of DMEM/F12 and remove suspension from plate in a 15 ml tube, centrifuge at 180 x g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of neuroinduction media (Step 2.2), plate on laminin-coated 12 well-plates and add ROCK inhibitor Y27632 in a final concentration of 10 µM to the cells, culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After cells reach 80 - 90% confluency they can be either further expanded or frozen down as follows.\nFreezing of iNPCs\n\t\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells with DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS and add 300µl DPBS/EDTA and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2, add 300 µl of DMEM/F12 and remove suspension from plate in a 15 ml tube, centrifuge at 180 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of commercial NSC freezing medium. Transfer suspension to freezing vials and put in cell-freezing container. Store at -80 °C for 2 days, then transfer to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n5. Differentiation of iNPCs\nDifferentiation towards neuronal lineage\n\t\nCulture cells on laminin-coated plates as described above. Change media to neuro-diff-media (DMEM/F-12, 1x N2, 1x B27, 300 ng/ml cAMP, 200 µM vitamin C, 10 ng/ml BDNF, 10 ng/ml GDNF) when cells are approximately 70% confluent. Change media every other day for three weeks. Do not split cells during differentiation.\nAfter three weeks cells should express the neuronal marker TUJ1. To gain more mature neurons and neuronal subtypes continue differentiation up to 3 months.\nDifferentiation towards glial lineage",
    "Change media to glial induction media (1:1 DMEM/F-12 : Neurobasal, 1x N2, 1x B27, 10 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 µM non-essential amino acids, 1.5 mM L-Glutamine, 5 µg/ml insulin, 40 ng/ml T3) including 20 ng/ml EGF to induce differentiation into glial precursor cells. Remove half of the media and replace by fresh media every other day for about 2 weeks. During this period cells should be split 1:3 in presence of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 when 100% confluency is reached.\nAfter 2 weeks differentiate cells further into astrocytes: when cells are nearly confluent change media to commercial available astrocyte media, change media every second day. After about 7 days cells start to express astrocyte markers (e.g., GFAP). If cells get 100% confluent during the differentiation protocol, split them in a 1:2 ratio in presence of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y27632.\nSubscription Required.
