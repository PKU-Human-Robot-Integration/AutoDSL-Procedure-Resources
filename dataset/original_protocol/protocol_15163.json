    "1. Donor Organ Recovery\nSet up the stereotactic microscope, record weight of the 8-10 week old rat (donor and recipient body weight should match).\nAnesthetize the donor rat (Lewis Brown Norway F1, LBN F1) using oxygen/isoflurane inhalation (isoflurane 4 %/2 L/min oxygen). Maintain anesthesia by lowering isoflurane to 2-2.5%.\nPlace the anesthetized rat on the surgery pad. Fix the rat's extremities with adhesive tape onto the pad and apply ophthalmic ointment (Bepanthen, Bayer) to the rat's eyes.\nShave and disinfect the abdomen of the rat and perform a ventral midline incision from the pubis to the caudal border of the liver. Expose the left kidney and its vessels by carefully moving the intestine to the right side. Place a thin sheet of gauze over the left kidney and moisten it with warmed isotonic saline solution to prevent desiccation.\nCarefully dissect the fat tissue with Dumont Angled Tip Forceps (Dumont SS-45 Forceps Inox Medical, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 11203-25) enveloping the left ureter. Avoid any direct contact with the ureter, instead, mobilize it with sufficient surrounding fat tissue.\nSeparate the left renal vein from the renal artery using Dumont Angled Tip forceps. Remove all fat and connective tissue from both vessels and cauterize the adrenal and testicular vessels.\nDissect aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) above and below its junction with the left renal artery and vein, respectively, and cauterize all outgoing arteries.\nClamp the suprarenal aorta with a microsurgical clamp (Micro Serrefines, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 18055-04) above the left renal artery, as near as possible to the superior mesenteric artery. Ligate the infrarenal aorta using surgical silk (5-0, Vömel, art no. 14739) approximately 5 mm below the left renal artery.",
    "Ligate the infrarenal IVC with surgical silk (5-0, Vömel), and clamp the suprarenal IVC with a microsurgical clamp (Micro Serrefines, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 18055-03).\nCut the renal vein as close as possible to the IVC using fine scissors (Iris Scissors - ToughCut Straight 11.5 cm, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 14058-11).\nSlowly perfuse the kidney in situ with 2 ml ice-cold HTK perfusion solution (CUSTODIOL HTK, Dr. Franz Köhler Chemie) by inserting a canula (Microlance 3 27G ¾, BD, cat.no. 302200) in the infrarenal aorta. Confirm that the renal color changes (now olive-tinted).\nFirst, transect the suprarenal aorta, then the infrarenal aorta and finally the ureter as close as possible to the urinary bladder.\nRemove the kidney and its vascular supply together with the ureter and store in HTK perfusion solution on ice.\nEuthanize the donor rat by removing the vascular clamps and consecutive excision of the heart under anesthesia.\n2. Recipient Preparation and Transplantation\nSet up the stereotactic microscope, record weight of the rat.\nAnesthetize the recipient rat (Lewis) using isoflurane 4%. Maintain anesthesia by lowering isoflurane to 2-2.5%.\nPlace the anesthetized rat on the surgery pad. Fix the rat's extremities with adhesive tape onto the pad and apply ophthalmic ointment to the rat`s eyes. Monitor and control core body temperature using a rectal temperature sensor and a warming pad. During surgery repetitively control temperature, breathing and heart rate of the animal.\nShave and disinfect the abdomen and perform a ventral midline incision from the pubis to the caudal border of the liver. Use a scalpel forcutting the skin in order to minimize skin trauma.  Expose the left kidney and its vessels by moving the intestine to the right side.\nCarefully remove the renal capsule using Dumont Angled Tip forceps and cotton swabs.",
    "Occlude the left renal artery, vein and ureter near the renal hilum with two ligations using surgical thread (Mersilene 4-0, Ethicon, cat. no. EH6732H). Excise the greater part of the kidney, leaving only the renal hilum. Clean the cut surface with cotton swabs and check for bleeding. Add another ligature if necessary.\nCarefully dissect bluntly through the connective tissue covering the infrarenal aorta and vena cava on the caudal site with cotton swabs.\nSeparate any visible nerve from the infrarenal aorta and vena cava using Dumont Angled Tip forceps.\nCarefully dissect through the connective tissue sheet between the infrarenal aorta and vena cava, forming two openings of 2-4 mm length: The first below the branching of the testicular vessels, and the second one above the branching of the common iliac vessels. Cauterize the iliolumbar arteries and veins in between.\nDraw a single surgical thread (Mersilene 0; Ethicon, cat. no.EH6665E) through each of the two openings. Using these threads pull the infrarenal aorta and vena cava gently to the right side of the animal to gain access to the vessels branching on the dorsal site. Cauterize any of these vessels between the two openings and remove the surgical threads thereafter.\nNext, occlude aorta and IVC by clockwise application of four microsurgical clamps (Micro Serrefines, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 18055-04) beginning at the upper opening with the aorta and ending with the vena cava at the upper opening (Micro Serrefines, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 18055-03).",
    "Afterwards carefully pierce the upper ending of the isolated part of the aorta with a needle (Microlance 3 27G ¾, BD, cat.no. 302200), insert the lower blade of a fine spring scissor (Vannas Spring Scissors - 3 mm Blades, Fine Science Tools, cat.no 15000-00) through the puncture opening and perform a short longitudinal incision. Flush the isolated aorta with ice-cold HTK perfusion solution to remove any remaining blood.\nLikewise, carefully pierce the lower ending of the isolated part of the vena cava with a needle, insert the lower blade of a fine spring scissor through the puncture opening and perform a longitudinal incision ending shortly below the aortic incision. Again, flush the vessel to remove any remaining blood.\nRemove the kidney graft from the storage solution. Place it below the former position of the left kidney, and ensure that it is correctly oriented.\nCheck the orientation of the grafts renal artery and ensure that there are no twists. Then place a thin sheet of gauze over the graft and moisten it with ice-cold HTK perfusion solution to cool it, and to prevent desiccation.\nFixate the opening of the suprarenal part of the aortic piece in which the renal artery of the graft opens into with surgical thread (Ethilon 9-0, Ethicon, cat. no. 2809G) - first at the upper, then at the lower end of the aortic incision. Close the incision clockwise with a continuous suture using surgical thread (Ethilon 9-0), Dumont Angled Tip forceps and a curved Castroviejo needle holder (Fine Science Tools, cat. no. 12061-01). Afterwards, cover the first suture with connective tissue through a counterclockwise second continuous suture. Now, only the lower part of the aortic piece of the graft remains to be closed. Regularly cool the graft with ice-cold HTK perfusion solution.",
    "Perfuse the graft with 1 ml of ice-cold HTK perfusion solution through a blunt needle inserted into the open end of the grafts aortic piece validating the tightness and integrity of the suture, as well as removing remaining blood in the graft. Afterwards, ligate the open end of the aortic piece with surgical silk (5-0, Vömel).\nCheck the orientation of the grafts renal vein and ensure that there are no twists.\nFixate the opening of the vein of the graft with surgical thread (Ethilon 9-0) - first at the upper, then at the lower end of the incision at the vena cava. Close the incision clockwise with a continuous suture using surgical thread (Ethilon 9-0), Dumont Angled Tip forceps and a curved Castroviejo needle holder. Regularly cool the graft with ice-cold HTK perfusion solution.\nCounterclockwise remove the microsurgical clamps, beginning with the uppermost vena cava clamp. After removing the last aortic clamp, carefully stop eventually mild bleeding with cotton swabs. After a few seconds the graft will turn rosy-tinted, and uretric contractions should appear.",
    "For the insertion of the grafts ureter into the recipient`s bladder carefully remove a small patch of the musculature at the top of the bladder using a Vannas Spring Scissor (Student Vannas Spring Scissor straight, Fine Science Tools, cat.no. 91500-09). Then, remove the surrounding tissue (mostly fat) from the graft ureter using Dumont Angled Tip forceps. Therefore, carefully grab the tip of the ureter and gently separate the surrounding fat, connective tissue and the embedded vessels from it by pulling them in the opposite direction. Fixate the uretric tip at the end of a surgical thread (Prolene 6-0, Ethicon, cat. no. 8697H) and perforate the previously prepared top of the bladder with the attached needle. Pull the ureter through the bladder and exit it at the base through a second perforation.\nFixate the previously from the ureter separated tissue at the top of the bladder with surgical thread (Ethilon 9-0). Cut off the tip of the ureter with the attached surgical thread and pull the ureter back into the bladder by gently pushing from below. Afterwards, close the second bladder puncture with surgical thread (Ethilon 9-0).\nClose the abdominal wall and skin by two continuous but separate sutures using surgical suture thread (Mersilene 0). Disinfect the wound using Pividon Iodine and administer buprenorphine (0.1 mg per kg/BW/bid) s.c. for three days after surgery to control wound pain.\n3. Imaging Allograft Rejection\nAnesthetize nonfasting rat using isoflurane 2-2.5%.\n30 MBq FDG (30 MBq FDG in 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl) are administered i.v. via catheterizing a lateral tail vein using a 24 G catheter (Braun, Introcan, 4252500-01). Afterwards, purge the catheter with 0.9 ml 0.9% NaCl solution.",
    "Leave the rat in a restrainer without anesthesia until start of the scan and hydrate the animal by i.v. injection of 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution hourly.\nRe-anesthetize rat using isoflurane 2% immediately before the scan starts.\nPlace anesthetized rat in a high-resolution multi-wire chamber-based animal PET camera quadHIDAC (Oxford Positron Systems Ltd, Oxford, UK). The spatial resolution of the PET scanner is 1.0 mm and is constant over the whole FOV (diameter, 165 mm; axial length, 280 mm). Monitor and control body temperature during the scan using a rectal temperature sensor and control anesthesia with a pulse oxymeter.\nStart dynamic acquisition for 60 min starting 180 min after FDG-injection to reduce tracer accumulation in the kidneys caused by renal excretion of FDG.\nApply 5 MBq of 18F-fluoride i.v. and perform another PET scan immediately after 18F-fluoride injection for 60 min without moving the position of the rat in the scanner for identification of renal parenchyma and for calculation of 18F-clearance 5. Reconstruct images from both scans. Trace manually a volume of interest (VOI) on reconstructed images 2 min after 18F-fluoride injection (perfusion-phase) around renal cortex and transfer the VOI to the FDG images. Carefully exclude the renal pelvis from the VOI. Reconstruct images from both scans and manually trace a volume of interest (VOI) around renal cortex. List-mode data were reconstructed into images with a voxel size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm3. Carefully exclude the renal pelvis from the VOI.\nCompute FDG uptake by the ratio of total counts and volume and calculate the percentage of injected dose (%ID). We used MATLAB (Version R2011b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and tomographic imaging (TIM) Version 2.8 for image analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
