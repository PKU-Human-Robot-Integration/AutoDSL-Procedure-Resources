    "1. Preparation of Stock Solutions\nPrepare an aqueous solution of 4% ethanol by diluting 4 mL of absolute ethanol with 100 mL of ultrapure water. Store the solution at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Ultrapure water is defined as water without contaminants such as bacteria, particulates, ions, or nucleases. Ultrapure water was obtained from a water purification system with a target resistivity of up to 18.2 mΩ·cm, which means low anionic contamination.\nPrepare a 1 mg/mL soybean lecithin stock solution by dissolving 20 mg of soybean lecithin in 20 mL of the aqueous solution of 4% ethanol. Store the soybean lecithin stock solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare a 25 mg/mL DSPE-PEG (2000)-COOH stock solution by dissolving 100 mg of DSPE-PEG-COOH in 4 mL of the aqueous solution of 4% ethanol. Store the stock solution at -20 °C.\nPrepare a 10 mg/mL DOX stock solution by dissolving 50 mg of DOX in 5 mL of ultrapure water. Store the DOX stock solution at 4 °C in the dark.\nPrepare a 2 mg/mL PLGA stock solution by dissolving 20 mg of PLGA in 10 mL of acetonitrile. Store the PLGA stock solution at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Acetonitrile is flammable and toxic. Operate with care in a fume hood, and wear appropriate personal equipment, such as lab coats, safety glasses and latex gloves.\nPrepare a 0.1 M 2-(morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES, pH 6.0) stock solution by dissolving 2.17 g of MES in 100 mL of ultrapure water. Store the stock solution at 4 °C.\n2. Synthesis of DNPs\nNOTE: To avoid DOX photochemical degradation, all operations were performed in the dark.\nNanoparticles were synthesized by a previously reported single-step sonication method11,13,14.",
    "Add 3 mL of the aqueous solution of 4% ethanol to a sterile 10 mL centrifuge tube. Then, add 90 µg of the soybean lecithin stock solution, 210 µg of the DSPE-PEG-COOH stock solution and 750 µg of the DOX stock solution to 3 mL of the aqueous solution of 4% ethanol.\nPlace the centrifuge tube into an ice bath, and place the ice bath on an ultrasonic processor.\nWith a 1 mL syringe, pipette 2 mg of the PLGA stock solution dropwise (1 drop/4-6 s) into the centrifuge tube. Meanwhile, sonicate the tube using an ultrasonic processor at a frequency of 20 kHz and an output amplitude of 30% for 5 min to synthesize the DNPs.\n\tNOTE: To synthesize uniform particles with small sizes, the speed at which the PLGA solution is dripped into the tube needs to be slow, and bubble generation should be avoided.\nPurify the DNPs by washing the above solution in 0.1 M MES buffer (pH 6.0) 3 times using a centrifuge filter (MWCO, 10 kDa). Centrifuge at 4 °C and 1000 × g for 3 min each time. Finally, approximately 1 mL of MES-solved nanoparticles should remain.\n\tNOTE: This is an acceptable stopping point in the procedure. If not used to conjugate peptides, the nanoparticles can be purified by PBS buffer (pH 7.4), and the purified DNPs can be stored at 4°C in the dark.\n3. Conjugation of Peptides to DNPs\nEster activation\nAdd 0.4 mg of EDC (final concentration 2 mM) to 1 mL of DNPs.\nAdd 0.24 mg of NHS to the reaction (final concentration 2 mM).\n\t\tNOTE: For easy addition of the correct quantity of EDC and NHS, a stock solution may be prepared if the reagents are dissolved and used immediately.",
    "Mix the reaction components well, and place the reaction on a shaker; allow reaction for 30 min-1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nAmine reaction\nIncrease the buffer pH to 7.2-7.5 using PBS (20×, pH 7.4).\nAdd 0.5 mg of the plCSA-targeting peptide (plCSA-BP, EDVKDINFDTKEKFLAGCLIVSFHEGKC) to the reaction solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Before addition, dissolve the peptides in 20% acetonitrile. If peptides are not dissolvable, sonication in a bath sonicator may helpful.\nMix the solution well, and then place on a shaker; allow the reaction to proceed at 4 °C overnight in the dark.\nPlace conjugate solution into dialysis bags (MWCO, 3,500 Da) to dialyze and purify the plCSA-DNPs using PBS (pH 7.4) buffer at room temperature for 24 h in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, purification could be performed as in step 2.4 to obtain plCSA-DNPs.\nFor cell culture applications, filter the reconstituted solution through a 0.22 µm sterile syringe filter to remove potential precipitates.\n4. Characterization of plCSA-Targeted Lipid-Polymer Nanoparticles\nMeasurement of the hydrodynamic nanoparticle size using dynamic light scattering (DLS)\nDilute nanoparticles with ultrapure water (50-fold dilution). Load 500 µL of the sample into a cuvette according to the instructions of the DLS or zeta potential instrument.\n\t\tNOTE: Zeta potential and DLS cuvettes can differ based on the instrument's specifications.\nAfter the measurement is completed, record the particle diameter, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential. Average the results obtained from 4 repeated readings, and calculate the standard deviation.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n\tNOTE: The morphology of the nanoparticles was observed by TEM with the negative stain method.24\nDilute nanoparticles with ultrapure water (400-fold dilution). Add 20 µL of the sample onto a TEM grid, and allow to sit for 5 min.",
    "Add 100 µL of 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid and allow to sit for 2 min. Wick away the droplet.\nDry the TEM grid at room temperature.\nSet the TEM acceleration voltage at 80 kV, and magnify the image to 100,000× to visualize the nanoparticles.\nDetermination of the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and LE\nStandard curve generation.
