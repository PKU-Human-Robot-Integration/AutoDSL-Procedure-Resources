    "All experimental procedures on laboratory animals were approved by the National Ethical Committee and the Ministry of Agriculture (EP 185/2018). The experiments were conducted in accordance with the Ethical Codex of The Croatian Society for Laboratory Animal Science and ARRIVE guidelines. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Zagreb, School of Medicine (UP/I-322-01/18-01/56). In this study, we present the results from three female participants (BMI: 29 kg/m2 ± 5 kg/m2). Informed consent was obtained from all human volunteers for their participation in the study and for presenting the data.\n1. Measuring the activation of brown adipose tissue after a meal in humans\nNOTE: Perform the experiments during the summertime when the daily temperature is not below 22 °C to keep basal BAT activity as low as possible.\nCarefully choose the control healthy participants (if BAT activity is to be estimated under pathological conditions) since BAT activity is gender, age, BMI, and even the phase of estrous cycle dependent.\n\t\nTo estimate the phase of the menstrual cycle of female participants, ask them questions about how long their average menstrual cycle is and the date of the first day of their last menstruation. Do not forget to mark the date of the experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: Proper selection of matching control subjects is the hardest part of clinical studies since healthy controls and participants with pathological conditions should be as similar as possible and differ only in the disease investigated.\nAsk the participants to rest well, not to have breakfast (fasting-no intake of calories), to gather in the morning hours for the experiments, and to rest for at least 30 min to avoid possible BAT activation during muscle activity via sympathetic activation.",
    "Ask the participants to remove their upper clothing 15 min before the measurements to avoid the possible effects of warming the skin surface (thermal effects of clothes) while determining the baseline BAT activity. Perform measurements at appropriate room temperature (22-27 °C).\nPerform infrared measurements.\n\t\nWhile the participants are resting, mount the thermal camera (detector type: uncooled microbolometer; detector pitch: 17 µm; camera spectral range: 7.5-14.0 µm; thermal sensitivity: 20 mK at 30 °C; lenses: 36 mm; resolution: 1024 pixels x 768 pixels; instantaneous field of view [IFOV]: 0.47 mRad) on the tripod and position it 1 m away from the spot where the participant will be seated.\n\t\tNOTE: If the measurements are performed in colder weather (outside air temperatures below 15 °C at 50% humidity), put the camera at room temperature and turn it on for at least 1 h before performing the measurements. Cold instruments can give different results after warming up to room temperature due to autocalibration.\nConnect the thermal camera to a computer and software as instructed by the manufacturer. Record aluminum foil (crumpled then stretched aluminum foil) at a focal distance of 1 m to determine the reflected temperature of the room, presented as measured temperature. In the camera software, input the distance of 0 m and emissivity of 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The reflected apparent temperature is a parameter obtained when the emissivity of the camera is set to 1.0 and the distance to 0 m and the measurements are taken on crumpled then stretched aluminum foil. Reflected apparent temperature represents an approximation of the total incident infrared radiation on the detector from the environment.",
    "Just before starting the measurements, determine the room air temperature and air humidity (necessary for later analysis). Instead of taking one thermal image, record a movie. From the movie, later choose the best possible image frame for analysis to reduce the possibility of losing valuable data.\nBefore starting the recording, set the following parameters: the duration of video recording at 10-15 s (or any other desired value), the frame rate at 5 fps (frames per second) or any other value (in our hands, 5 fps is the maximum needed), and a location on the disk where the movie will be saved, as described below.\n\t\t\nIn the software above the main camera window, choose the third icon from the left. In the pop-up menu, choose Edit Record Settings, after which a new window will open.\nIn record mode, select Record to Disk, and below that, set the Record for This Duration at the desired time. In the record options of the same window, limit record rate to 5 (Hz) and choose the location where the recordings will be saved.\nTo set the frame rate, close the existing window, open Edit in the main menu, and select Preferences. In the right part of the opened window, enter 5 in Target Frame Rate. In the same window below, select Hotkey/Remote Start Can Stop Record, and from the drop-down menu, select In Start/Stop mode.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Try to make the shortest possible movies with the lowest possible frame rate since it is memory-consuming. At these settings, one record will have approximately 100 Mb.",
    "Position the participant so that the supraclavicular area of the neck, above the collarbone where BAT is located (Figure 1), is at a 1 m focal distance and record a short movie (10-15 s) at a frame rate of 5 fps by pressing the F5 key. The recording will stop at the designated time.\nIn the room at the time of the measurements, ensure only the participant and the person who is performing the measurements are present. Avoid air movement or draft (e.g., from air conditioning). Ensure the participants are away from cold draft, sunlight (direct or indirect), or any source of heat like light bulbs.\nIf suitable, measure the blood glucose concentrations in capillary blood from the fingertip with a standard glucometer and the body temperature using an axillary thermometer.\nEnsure all the participants eat the same meal. Pay attention to the food restrictions and requirements of the tested subjects (for example, the meal for diabetic patients). All participants, including control (healthy) people and participants with metabolic disorders, should eat the same meal.\n\tNOTE: For more details about meals that diabetic patients can consume, contact a local endocrinologist or discuss it with the participants suffering from diabetes mellitus.\nAt the desired time after a meal, make the new recording by pressing F5 using the same setting values. Do not repeat the set protocol for recordings. Repeat the measurements at 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after a meal12. For your specific study design, the time after a meal could be shorter or longer, but we recommend at least the first three time points.",
    "​NOTE: The limitation of the number of participants is four to six, even though the measurements are done fast. With a higher number of participants, the delay time for some will be too long.\n2. Measuring the activation of brown adipose tissue after a meal in laboratory animals\nNOTE: Since the animals are housed in an animal facility with regulated room temperature and a day/night cycle of 12 h/12 h the experiments could be performed during any season. The room temperature during experiments should be between 22 °C and 27 °C. In this study, six female animals in diestrus and six male wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6NCrl animals were examined.\nAnesthetize the animals as per the institution's ethical guidelines. In this study, anesthesia was performed using i.p. injections of ketamine/xylazine (80-100 mg/kg and 6-8 mg/kg, respectively). Apply eye gel to both eyes to prevent corneal drying during anesthesia. Shave the interscapular regions of the test animals a day before the experiments (the region of the skin between the shoulder blades) using a small animal trimmer.\nThe day before the experiments, also determine the phase of the estrous cycle in female animals.\n\tNOTE: The phase of the estrous cycle is determined by vaginal smears.\n\t\nDip a cotton tip swab in room-temperature sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and insert it into the vagina. Gently scrape the vaginal wall with the swab, spread the attached cells onto a glass slide, and allow it to air dry.\nPut the animals back in their cages. Stain the cells with 500 µL of 0.1% cresyl violet acetate for 1 min, after which rinse them 3 times with water.",
    "View the cells under a light microscope with 100x magnification and bright-field illumination. Determine the phase of the estrous cycle based on the number of leukocytes and nucleated and cornified epithelial cells observed in the smear25.\nRemove the animals' food the evening before the experiments (fasting overnight) with water ad libitum. The best way is to transfer the animals to new clean cages to avoid possible remnants of food in the cages.\nOn the morning of the experimental day, prepare the thermal camera and recording settings as done for testing the human participants.\nDo not disturb or cause stress to the animals before performing IR measurements. Carefully place the animal in a clean cage (ensures there are no effects of other animals' scent on the animal's sympathetic system). Place the cage under the thermal camera at a focal distance of 1 m. Record a movie by pressing F5.\nWeigh the food pellet before giving it to each animal so that food intake can be calculated. Allow the animal to eat for 30 min in its cage and weigh the food pellet again after the meal. In this study, female animals ate 0.038 ± 0.004 g food/body weight.\n\tNOTE: If you decide to measure blood glucose concentrations, perform the measurements before a meal but after IR measurements to ensure that this will not lead to BAT activation by the sympathetic system.\nRepeat IR measurements at the desired time after starting a meal (usually 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after a meal)17,26.\nAfter all the experiments are completed, test again the phase of the estrous cycle in female animals as described above (female animals may exit the desired phase of the estrous cycle sooner than anticipated).\n3. Analyzing the thermal recordings",
    "NOTE: The thermal camera software calculates the object's temperature using five variables.\nSet the following variables in the software before analysis: skin emissivity, e = 0.9815,27, reflected room temperature (as calculated from the image of aluminum foil), air temperature, relative humidity, distance to the object = 1 m. Perform the analysis by using the software with these values.\n\tNOTE: The preferred color palette is rainbow since it uses more hues, which allows for easier detection of BAT above the collarbone.\nFor each movie, enter the listed variables into the camera software on the right side of the main window. Select the suitable frame (image) from the movie by moving the play head at the bottom of the screen or pressing the Pause button.\nSelect the region of interest (ROI) by choosing the desired shape of the area on the left side of the main window. Choose the shape that best corresponds to the area of skin above or between the collarbones.\nWhen the ROI is chosen, the minimal, maximal, and average temperatures of the ROI are displayed on the right side. In the image, the red triangle represents the point of maximal recorded temperature, and the blue triangle represents the minimal recorded temperature. Repeat this step for several frames to be sure that the measured temperature is stable during a few seconds of the recording.\nSubtract the maximal temperatures of the skin area above BAT before a meal from the maximal temperatures after a meal to determine the increase in postprandial BAT activity in laboratory animals.\nSubscription Required.
