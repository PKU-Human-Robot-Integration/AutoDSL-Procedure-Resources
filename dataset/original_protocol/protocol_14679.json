    "All animal work in this protocol is performed with strict adherence to University of Newcastle Animal Ethics Committee approved procedures.\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Media and Dishes\nPre-warm Media 199 (TC199) or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) media to 37 °C. Pre-oxygenate the medium by bubbling with 95% O2/5% CO2. Check that the medium has a final pH of 7.3.\nPrepare suture by cutting two 5 cm sections for each sac. Loop the sutures into an unclosed knot.\n2. Dissection and Preparation of the Gastrointestinal Tract\nWithdraw solid food 12 hr before euthanasia. If desired, place animals on nutrient gel supplements during this time.\nEuthanize mice by sodium pentobarbitone overdose ([200 mg/Kg], intraperitoneal injection) followed by cervical dislocation in accordance with institutional ethics protocols and spray 70% ethanol onto the abdomen and thorax.\nUsing a scissors, make a horizontal incision in the middle of the abdomen and expose the peritoneum.\nProceed to separate and the remove the gastrointestinal tract by cutting the upper small intestine from the stomach at the pyloric sphincter and cutting the large intestine at the anal verge. Use a forceps to gently remove the mesentery. Place the intestinal tract in pre-warmed, oxygenated medium.\nIdentify the section of intestine to be assessed for permeability (Figure 1) and cut this section free from the rest of the intestinal tract.\n\t\nIn order to maintain consistency between animals, measure sections of duodenum and jejunum relative to the stomach, and measure sections of colon and ileum relative to the cecum.\nWhen selecting tissue segments, note the presence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues such as Peyer's patches. These can be identified as small nodules on the serosal side of the lumen.",
    "Using a 1 ml syringe, gently flush the luminal contents of the intestinal segment into a petri dish with pre-heated PBS (37 °C). These faecal contents may be discarded or stored at -80 °C for future analysis as desired.\n3. Preparation of Intestinal Sacs\nPrepare a 1 ml syringe with a 300 µl volume of the test compound or molecule. For mucosal integrity, a 1 mg/ml solution of FITC-Dextran M.Wt. 4,400 may be used. Probes ranging from 4,400-70,000 Da in size may be used for increased sensitivity. Securely fit a small animal vascular catheter onto the syringe.\nMeasure 5 cm from the opening of the intestinal segment and tie the segment securely closed with a suture-loop at this point. Gently place a pre-tied suture-loop around the opening of the intestine and insert the blunted catheter. Pull the noose closed so as to secure the intestinal segment and release the 300 µl volume from the syringe into the intestine, ensuring that all the solution is injected.\nGently remove the catheter while simultaneously pulling the suture noose to secure closure of the intestinal sac. Cut the intestinal sac loose from the intestine and place into a 50 ml conical tube filled with 20 ml of oxygenated medium, preheated to to 37 °C.\n4. Measurement of Permeability\nPlace conical tubes containing the intestinal sacs in a heated water bath set to 37 °C. At 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min time points, take a 100 µl sample from the conical tube and transfer to a 96 well plate, replacing the volume with 100 µl of fresh media in each instance.\nAfter the final sample is taken, cut open sacs at the point of suture and down the length of the segment, exposing the mucosal surface.",
    "Measure the length and width of each intestinal segment. If desired, snap freeze the segments and store at -80 °C for protein or biochemical analysis, or alternatively, store in RNA stabilization solution for molecular assays.\nConstruct a standard curve of log dilutions for FITC-tagged molecules ranging from 1 to 1 x 10-6.\nMeasure samples and standards for FITC on a fluorescent plate reader, FITC excitation/emission: 495 nm/519 nm.\n5. Calculation of Apparent Permeability for Each Individual Intestinal Sac\nConvert time units to sec.\nFor each time point, calculate the cumulative concentration, Q\n\tQt = (Ct*Vr) + (Qt sum* Vs), Where:\n\tQt = Cumulative concentration at time t\n\tCt = Concentration at time t\n\tVr = Volume at receiver side\n\tQt sum = Sum of all previous Qt\n\tVs = Volume sampled\n\t \nPlot Q versus time (T) and calculate the slope: δQ/δt\nCalculate the apparent permeability (Papp)\n\tPapp = (δQ/δt)/(A*Co), Where:\n\tA = Area of tissue\n\tC0 = Initial concentration\nSubscription Required.
