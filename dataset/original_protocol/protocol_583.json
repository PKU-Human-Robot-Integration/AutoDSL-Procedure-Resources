    "**Mouse anesthesia \\(Timing: 40min)**\n1. Attach the Gaymar T/Pump with the warming pad and fill it with water. Turn on the pump to pre-warm the warming pad. \n  2. Weigh the mouse. Prepare the anesthetic: add 2.4 ul of ketamine per gram of body weight, 1ul of xylazine per gram of body weight, and sterile 0.9% NaCl solution to a final volume of 200 ul \\(solution A). Add 2.4 ul of ketamine per gram of body weight and 0.9% NaCl solution to a final volume of 200 ul \\(solution B). Inject Solution A for the initial anesthesia. After 1 hour, inject 50 ul of solution B every 30min or as needed \\(use paw pinch reflex to test whether more anesthesia is required).\n  _For example: for a mouse of 25 grams, mix 60ul ketamine and 25 ul xylazine, and add 115 ul 0.9% NaCl solution to make 200 ul of solution A. Mix 60 ul ketamine and 140 ul 0.9% NaCl solution to make 200 ul of solution B._ \n3. Inject 100 ul of solution A \\(i.p.) with a 1ml syringe and 30G needle. Start the timer right after the injection \\(T=0min). The mouse should become anesthetized in 3 min. \n  4. Transfer the mouse onto the warming pad at T=3min. Mount the mouse to the nose-holder at T=10min in a supine position \\(fig2). Insert the rectal probe to monitor the body temperature. Adjust Gaymar T/Pump to maintain the mouse body temperature at 37 degrees. Caution: after anesthesia, rinse the tongue with artificial saliva every 5-10min during the surgery to prevent the tongue from dehydrating.",
    "5. Pinch the mouse paw to check if the mouse is fully anesthetized at T=15min. Wait until the mouse loses the pinch reflex to begin surgery. It usually takes 15 to 20min to reach an adequate surgical plane of anesthesia. \n  \n**Tracheotomy  \\(Timing: 5min)**\n6. Apply mineral oil to the neck and upper chest area \\(fig2). Make a 1 cm midline incision to expose the salivary glands. \\(fig3)\n  \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4073/original/fig2.jpg?1448313593\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4073/thumbnail/fig2.png?1448313593\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4075/original/fig3.jpg?1448313595\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4075/thumbnail/fig3.png?1448313595\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4077/original/fig4.jpg?1448313656\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4077/thumbnail/fig4.png?1448313656\" > </a>\n7. Separate the two lobes of the salivary glands with blunt dissection. You should be able to see the trachea and the trachealis muscle. Blunt dissect the muscle to expose the trachea. \n  8. Make a horizontal cut in the trachea with spring scissors but do not cut it through completely. Insert the tracheal cannula about 0.5cm \\(fig4); no sutures are needed if using catheter tubing.\n  \n**Insert esophageal tube \\(Timing: 10min)**\n9. Locate the esophagus underneath the trachea and carefully separate it from the surrounding tissue. Place a suture thread underneath the esophagus. Make a horizontal cut in the esophagus caudal to the thread. Do not cut through completely the esophagus. \n  10. Insert the esophageal tube into the oral cavity between the tongue and the palate. Gently press the tube through the throat until the end of the tube exits the incision of the esophagus made in step 9. \n  11. Pull the tube out through the incision until the pad lies between the tongue and the palate. Tighten the suture around the incision to fix the tube in place. \n  \n**Expose the tympanic bulla \\(Timing: 20min)**",
    "12. Retract the skin and the trachea to expose the digastric muscle on the left side using the 3cm Goldstein retractor as shown in fig5. Separate the tendon of the digastric muscle slightly and cauterize the tendon to detach the caudal part of the digastric muscle. Be careful not to disturb the blood vessels underneath the digastric muscle. After cauterization, the surgery should be as shown in fig 6. The hyoglossus muscle covers the tympanic bulla \\(fig6)<sup>9</sup>.\n  \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4079/original/fig5.jpg?1448313658\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4079/thumbnail/fig5.png?1448313658\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4081/original/fig6.jpg?1448313659\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4081/thumbnail/fig6.png?1448313659\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4087/original/fig7.jpg?1448313660\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4087/thumbnail/fig7.png?1448313660\" > </a>\n13. Blunt dissect the hyoglossus muscle to expose the tympanic bulla. Clean the muscles and connective tissue around this area as much as possible \\(fig7). \n  **\\(? Troubleshooting1)**\n**Expose the geniculate ganglion \\(Timing: 60min)**\n14. Retract the jaw rostrally with the hook to enlarge the area above the tympanic bulla \\(fig8). Using #2 Inox forceps, break the transparent portion of the bulla and the opaque part of the bulla. Be careful to not damage the tympanic membrane while breaking the bulla. The interior structure of the tympanic cavity is shown in fig 9. \n  \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4089/original/fig8.jpg?1448313662\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4089/thumbnail/fig8.png?1448313662\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4091/original/fig9.jpg?1448313663\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4091/thumbnail/fig9.png?1448313663\" > </a>\n15. Within the tympanic cavity, carefully remove the stapes of the ossicles with #5 Inox forceps. Cut the tendon connecting the tensor tympani muscle to the ossicles with #55 Inox forceps and remove the muscle. There usually is minor bleeding mixed with tissue fluid. The chorda tympani nerve travels around the malleus of the ossicles and along the tympanic membrane. You must be very careful not to damage these structures \\(fig 10,11).",
    "16. Attach suction pipette I to the vacuum to remove any the tissue fluid and blood that accumulates. Grasp the tensor tympani muscle by #55 Inox forceps and remove it. It usually takes several attempts to remove the muscle completely. The temporal bone will be exposed after removing the tensor tympani muscle. \n  \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4093/original/fig10.jpg?1448313665\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4093/thumbnail/fig10.png?1448313665\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4095/original/fig11.jpg?1448313666\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4095/thumbnail/fig11.png?1448313666\" > </a>\n17. Rotate the mouse and the stage to a horizontal position \\(clockwise 90 degrees) to enable a better view of the tympanic cavity. Break and remove the cochlear promontory using forceps \\(fig12, 13). There will be large quantity of tissue fluid and possibly some bleeding while removing the promontory, remove the fluid and blood by suction pipette I. The tissue fluid will appear for the rest of the surgery, it is important to remove the tissue fluid continuously. \n  \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4097/original/fig12.jpg?1448313668\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4097/thumbnail/fig12.png?1448313668\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4099/original/fig13.jpg?1448313669\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4099/thumbnail/fig13.png?1448313669\" > </a>\n \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4101/original/fig14.jpg?1448313671\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4101/thumbnail/fig14.png?1448313671\" > </a>",
    "18. \\(CRUCIAL STEP) At this point, the facial nerve and the greater superficial petrosal \\(GSP) nerve will be visible. Figure 13 shows the location of the geniculate ganglion \\(GG). The dashed white lines indicate the facial nerve and GSP nerve. The GG lies at the junction of the facial and GSP nerves, as indicated by dashed green lines. Note, there are several blood vessels around GG and the nerves, as indicated by dashed red lines. During the surgery, use the facial and GSP nerves as markers to localize the GG. Use #5 carbon steel forceps to break the temporal bone along the edges of GG, inside the dashed red lines in fig 13 to avoid blood vessels. Remove the bone by breaking into large fragments. Avoid generating too many small bone fragments. If there is bleeding around the GG, remove the blood with small pieces of kimwipe. \n  **\\(? Troubleshooting2)**\n19. Use #5SF Inox forceps to remove the bone fragments directly over the GG \\(fig14). Do not touch the ganglion with forceps. Remove the fluid with suction pipette I continuously. \n  \n**Calcium imaging \\(Timing: 30min)**\n20. Tighten the ear bars and the nose clamp to minimize any movement of the geniculate ganglion. Install suction pipette II close to the geniculate ganglion to remove the fluid continuously while imaging \\(fig15, 16). Fix the suction pipette by taping it to the head holder. \n  \n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4103/original/fig15.jpg?1448313672\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4103/thumbnail/fig15.png?1448313672\" > </a>\n<a href=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4105/original/fig16.jpg?1448313673\" > <img src=\" http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4105/thumbnail/fig16.png?1448313673\" > </a>\n21. Transfer the mouse with the warming pad to the confocal microscope and fix the stage under the confocal microscope. Connect suction micropipette II to vacuum.",
    "22. Geniculate ganglia in GCaMP3 mice have a faint green fluorescence. Locate the ganglion using epifluorescence with a DAPI filter and a 4x objective. Check the fluorescence of geniculate ganglion neurons using the 20x long working distance objective. \n  23. Use the 488nm laser at 30% power to scan the geniculate ganglion. Set the pinhole at 400 um and adjust hv around 600-700. You should be able to see the bright green fluorescence of individual neurons. \n  **\\(? Troubleshooting3)**\n24. Load taste solutions into reservoirs of the perfusion system and connect the perfusion manifold to the esophageal tube.  Place a suction tube close to the mouth of the mouse to withdraw taste solutions. \n  25. Record the fluorescence at a scanning speed ~ 300 ms/scan with Olympus’ Fluoview software \\(<continuous scan mode?>). Perfuse taste solutions into the oral cavity. Different numbers of neurons will respond based on the preparation and the taste stimuli. \n  **\\(? Troubleshooting4)**"
