    "Take 2 x 106 of ATP-depleted or regular IB4 LCL cells and replenish with 10 ml of ATP-depletion or regular culture medium. Add 274 μl of 36.5% formaldehyde to 10 ml of cells to make the final concentration as 1% and wait 10 min to allow cross link reaction to complete at room temperature.Add 1 ml of 10x glycine to 10 ml of cells to quench unreacted formaldehyde and swirl gently and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Pellet cells at 2,000 rpm (400 x g; Eppendorf 5415D) for 5 min then aspirate supernatant and wash cells twice with 1 ml ice-cold 1x PBS. Finally, add 1 ml ice-cold ChIP lysis buffer and sit on ice for 30 min.Break down cells on ice by using a douncer homogenizer with 10 strokes and transfer whole cell lysate to a 1.7 ml cryptal vial. Collect nuclei by spin at 2,300 x g for 5 min. After removal of supernatant, resuspend the isolated nuclei with 260 μl digestion buffer (prewarm at 37 °C for 5 min prior to use).Add 12.5 μl of enzyme solution and allow enzyme digestion at room temperature for 15 min.Add 20 μl ice-cold EDTA to stop the reaction and pellet the digested chromatins by spining at 13,200 rpm (16,100 x g; Eppendorf 5415R), 4 °C for 10 min. The digested chromatins will be retained in supernatant (around 300 μl: can be applied for up to 5 IP) and cell debris will be left in pellet. Please keep 50 μl of supernatant as input of chromatin DNA. Aliquot 50 μl of supernatant into 3 new tubes [3 IP: Ab1, Ab2/H3-Ac (positive control), and IgG], and refill each sample with 950 μl ChIP dilution buffer to make a 1 ml volume.",
    "Add 20 μl Protein A/G agarose to preclean the non-specifically bound chromatins by sitting on a rocker for 1 h at 4 °C.After removal of the preclean protein A/G agarose, add 3 μg of the desire Ab1 (in this case PE2), Ab2 for H3-Aceylated (positive control), or IgG (negative control) to the digested chromatins and immunoprecipitation will be carried out by sitting the ChIP samples on a rocker for 4 h at 4 °C.Note: Up to 5 IP is allowed.Add 30 μl Protein A/G agarose to each ChIP sample and allow additional 2 h of reaction at 4 °C. Collect protein A/G agarose by a brief centrifugation using a bench top mini centrifuge.Wash protein A/G agarose with 1 ml of ice-cold low salt immune complex wash buffer once, 1 ml of ice-cold high salt immune complex wash buffer once, 1 ml of ice-cold LiCl immune complex wash buffer once, and 1 ml of ice-cold TE buffer twice.Apply 200 μl elution buffer (freshly prepared) for each collected protein A/G agarose sample in order to elute protein by vortexting and incubating at room temperature for 15 min. 200 μl eluent will be obtained for each IP reaction after a brief spin.Add 8 μl 5 M NaCl to each eluent and incubate at 65 °C from 4 h to overnight to reverse the crosslinking. At this step, the samples can be stored at -20 °C or continue to proceed to the next step.Add 4 μl 0.5 M EDTA, 8 μl 1 M Tris-HCl, and 1 μl Proteinase K (10 μg/μl) to each sample and incubate at 45 °C for 2 h.Isolate DNA by using spin columns.Amounts of DNA will be quantified by performing real time PCR analysis. 5% input DNA will be used as the internal control."
