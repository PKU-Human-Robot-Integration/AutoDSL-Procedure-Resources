    "The skeletal muscle procedure as described follows the guidelines of the Appalachian State University Institutional Review Board.\nNOTE: The team consists of an operator (Ph.D. or M.D. trained in the biopsy technique), and at least one, but ideally, three or more technicians. The operator is responsible for conducting and overseeing all aspects of the skeletal muscle biopsy procedure. One technician (technician #1) is immediately responsible for assisting the operator with all aspects of muscle extraction. This includes being the “non-sterile hands” and applying suction with a sterile syringe. A second technician (technician #2) engages in conversation with subject and massages the subject’s opposite leg during procedure to minimize the subject's anxiety. The third technician (technician #3) is responsible for handling and processing the skeletal muscle sample. Downstream analytical measures dictate how many additional technicians are required for processing/preparing the skeletal muscle sample.\n1. Subject Preparation\nGather, prepare, and organize the materials specified for the muscle biopsy procedure (Table 1). Decontaminate and sterilize the Bergström needle (outer cannula and inner trocar) and the plunger according to standard practice16.\nReview the consent form with the subject. The skeletal muscle biopsy portion of the Consent to Participate form used at Appalachian State University is provided in online supplement 1.\n\t\nTalk to the subject about the general aspects of the muscle biopsy procedure with a focus on possible risks of the procedure, skin preparation, application of the anesthetic, typical sensations. Instruct the subject to carefully read the Consent to Participate form and sign it to confirm that the study design and procedures are understood.\nConfirm that the subject is not allergic to “___caine”-type medications (e.g., lidocaine).",
    "Instruct the subject to lie supine on a padded table with the thigh exposed. Place two disposable absorbent underpads with plastic backing under the subject’s leg. Position the leg in a relaxed manner with a small towel roll under the heel, such that the knee is fully extended (elevated ~1 cm), thus placing the vastus lateralis in a shortened position.\nHave the operator instruct the subject to momentarily contract the exposed thigh muscle so that the biopsy site can be visualized. Note: The vastus lateralis biopsy site is just anterior to the fascia lata (illiotibial band), approximately one-third of the distance between the top of the patella and the greater trochanter7.\nHave the operator mark just below (~0.5 cm) the incision site with a fine point permanent marker.\nHave the operator determine the approximate skinfold thickness by pinching the skinfold.\nHave the operator and technicians wash their hands with soap and warm water and don disposable gloves.\nHave the operator remove the hair from a region ~15 cm x 15 cm around the biopsy site (via clippers). Note: clipping the hair from the biopsy site prevents hair from getting into the incision during the procedure and during closing, and hair removal allows for better contact between the tape closures and the skin (see 3.4).\nHave the operator sterilize the area with swabs pre-soaked with a topical antiseptic, (such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate for subjects allergic to iodine/shellfish). Begin in the center and work in concentric circles towards the outer edge of the clipped area. At a minimum, repeat twice more with a new pre-soaked swab each time.\n2. Biopsy Procedure\nHave the operator remove disposable gloves, wash hands with soap and warm water, and don sterile surgical gloves using aseptic technique.",
    "Have technician #1 present the sterile fenestrated drape to the operator. Have the operator, using aseptic technique, place the drape over the biopsy site to maintain a sterile field.\nHave technician #1 present the operator a 5 ml syringe fitted with a 21 G needle while maintaining aseptic technique. Clean the top of the lidocaine vial with an alcohol swab.\n\t\nHave the operator immediately withdraw 5 ml of lidocaine. Remove the 21 G needle from the syringe and discard the needle into a sharps container.\nHave technician #1 present the operator with a 1-½ inch 25 G needle while maintaining aseptic technique. Have the operator place the 1-½ inch needle onto the syringe and evacuate the air bubbles from the syringe.\nHave technician #1 spray ethyl chloride on the incision site (~0.5 cm above the indelible ink mark on the skin) until the skin appears to “blanch.”\n\t\nHave the operator insert the needle approximately horizontal to the skin into the dermis, aspirate the needle, and then infiltrate with ~100 µl of lidocaine to produce a “bleb” 2-4 mm in diameter.\n\t\t\nHave the operator aspirate the needle (slightly withdraw the plunger of the syringe) to confirm that the needle has not been placed in a blood vessel. If blood appears in the syringe, withdraw the needle, discard in a sharps container, and begin again at 2.3.\nHave the operator advance the needle into the subcutaneous tissue, aspirate the needle, and then infiltrate the tissue with ~1 ml of lidocaine to form a bleb. Once the bleb has subsided, insert the 1-½ inch needle on the lidocaine-loaded syringe vertically into the incision site, stopping superficial to the fascia. Note: The subject may feel a slight momentary stinging sensation upon the initial injection of lidocaine (similar to a bee sting).",
    "Ensure that the operator does not infiltrate the muscle with lidocoine because it is myotoxic17-19.\nHave the operator aspirate the needle and then slowly inject the remaining 4 ml of lidocaine while withdrawing the needle from the thigh. Place sterile gauze over injection site and allow the subject to relax while the local anesthetic takes effect.\nAfter 2-3 min, have technician #1 present the operator a scalpel while maintaining aseptic technique.\n\t\nHave the operator lightly probe the biopsy site with the tip of the scalpel to confirm that the area is anesthetized. If necessary, inject another 3-4 ml of lidocaine into the incision site, see 2.4.1.2.\nHave the operator make a straight 1-cm incision through the skin and subcutaneous tissues (~2-3 mm above the ink mark) parallel to the femur.\n\t\nHave the operator insert the scalpel deeper to make an incision through the fascia into the muscle. Do this once in each direction. Note: The subject may feel a twinge or pressure with the deeper cut if the scalpel blade cuts into the muscle.\nHave technician #2 engage the subject in conversation and massage the opposite leg.\nHave the operator place a liberal amount of sterile gauze over the incision and biopsy site and apply direct pressure to the incision to reduce bleeding.\n\t\nHave technician #1 connect the 3-way metal stopcock to the disposable 60 ml syringe and the 30 cm extension tubing (Figure 1).\nHave technician #1 connect one end of the tapered plastic tubing connecter into the free end of the extension tubing and firmly insert the other end of the tapered plastic tubing connecter into the large end of a 200 µl pipette tip with ~15-18 mm of the tip cut off.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51812/51812fig1highres.jpg",
    "Figure 1. The Bergström needle. (A) The Bergström needle (5 mm) is composed of the (a) outer cannula and (b) inner trocar, the associated components include (c) plunger, (d) 200 µl pipette tip with ~15-18 mm cut off, (e) tapered plastic connector, (f) 3-way metal stopcock, (g) 30 cm extension tubing, and (h) disposable 60 ml syringe. (B) The Bergström needle (5 mm) and associated components assembled. (C) The inner trocar of the Bergström needle (5 mm) withdrawn approximately 1 cm opens the window of the outer cannula.\nAfter the bleeding has subsided, have technician #1 open the sterilized autoclave pouch and present the 5 mm biopsy needle and inner trocar (Figure 1) to the operator while maintaining aseptic technique.\n\t\nHave the operator assemble the needle (outer cannula and inner trocar), check alignment and sliding action.\nHave the operator firmly hold the needle assembly (outer cannula and inner trocar) with both hands to prevent the inner trocar from rotating. Have technician #1 firmly insert the cut pipette tip into the top of the inner trocar portion of the biopsy needle with a slight downward twisting motion. Ensure that technician #1 does not touch the operator or the biopsy needle, only the pipette tip.\nHave the operator introduce the biopsy needle into the tissue through the incision. Locate the incision in the fascia (an acquired “feel”) with the tip of the biopsy needle. Advance the needle just past the fascia and then angle the needle downward toward the floor as the needle is advanced into the muscle. Note: Subjects may experience some mild discomfort (e.g., “deep pressure,” or mild cramping sensation) as the incision through the fascia is located with the tip of the biopsy needle and the needle is advanced into the muscle.",
    "Have technician #2 instruct the subject to stay “relaxed” and not to contract their thigh muscles while the operator is advancing the needle into the muscle.\nOnce the biopsy needle is in position, have the operator signal technician #1 to open the disposable 60 ml syringe.\n\t\nHave technician #1 rapidly pull the disposable 60 ml syringe open to the 40-50 cc mark to create suction within the biopsy needle.\nHave the operator pull the inner trocar out approximately 1 cm to open the window of the outer cannula while maintaining the position of the outer trocar within the muscle. Have the operator rapidly close the inner trocar to cut (clip) and collect the muscle sample. Have the operator signal technician #1 to release suction.\nHave technician #1 open the stopcock to the room to release the suction.\nHave the operator rotate the biopsy needle 90° and repeat the process. If required, have the operator repeat the rotation procedure up to 3x (for a total of 4 clips).\nHave the operator apply direct counter-pressure to the incision site with sterile gauze while removing the biopsy needle from the thigh, being careful not to catch fascia or skin. If significant resistance is felt, re-cut while applying a twisting motion to the inner trocar.\nUpon removal of the biopsy needle from the thigh, have the operator pull the inner trocar back 1 cm to visually inspect the lumen of the outer cannula to estimate if an adequate amount of tissue was collected.\n\t\nHave the operator hand the biopsy needle to technician #1. To maintain aseptic technique ensure that technician #1 only touches the needle, not the operator. Have technician #1 hand the biopsy needle to technician #3.\nHave technician #3 remove the tissue from the biopsy needle.",
    "Have technician #3 use the plunger (Figure 1) and a pair of fine tip forceps to ensure that all muscle tissue is removed from the inner trocar and outer cannula.\nHave technician #3 quickly weigh the sample to confirm that an adequate amount of muscle tissue was collected and place the samples on an ice-cold dissection block.\nHave technician #3 carefully dissect visible connective tissue and fat from the muscle samples. Have technician #3 prepare the muscle samples for storage according to downstream analyses. For example, immediately place samples in a cryovial and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen, mount and freeze for histology, or place in a cryovial with RNase inhibitor, etc.\nIf necessary, repeat the procedure with a second sterilized biopsy needle while maintaining aseptic technique.\n3. Closure\nHave the operator apply direct pressure to biopsy site with sterile gauze and an ice pack for 10-15 min.\nOnce hemostasis is achieved, have the operator use alcohol prep pads to remove dried blood from the area around the incision.\nHave technician #1 present a tube of topical surgical adhesive and applicator to the operator. Have the operator assemble the tube of surgical adhesive and applicator without touching the applicator tip or the top of the tube.\nHave the operator pull the incision closed with one hand while applying a single layer of surgical adhesive over the top of the dry incision with the other hand. After the adhesive cures (~ 90 sec), apply tape closuresperpendicular to the incision. Alternatively, close the incision with two sterile 4-0 sutures.\nHave the operator apply direct pressure by placing 3-4 2” x 2” non-sterile gauze pads on the incision site and secure with self-adhering adhesive wrap.",
    "Have the operator provide the subject verbal and written instructions on proper wound care, normal and abnormal reactions, and activity guidelines for the following 1 to 4 days (see online supplement 2).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
