    "The Institutional Review Board at the College of St. Scholastica has approved the study under which this protocol was developed and tested.\nNOTE: The manufacturer's specifications of the vibrator used in this protocol indicated that the frequency on 'high' was 11,00 rpm (183.3 Hz). This frequency was confirmed using a sample of vibration data collected through one input of a differential amplifier sampled at 2 kHz. The mean period of the signal was 5.56 x 10-3 s, which is equivalent to 180 Hz. In individuals with Raynaud's disease, vibration may cause Raynaud's phenomenon, a temporary vasoconstriction at the site of application, which may last minutes to hours, and may be accompanied by numbness, itching or pain.23 Figure 1 shows an example of Raynaud's phenomenon caused by vibration similar to that used in this protocol. Potential participants should be screened for Raynaud's prior to participating in this protocol.\n1. Proprioception Knockdown Protocol:\nGather pen, 183 Hz vibrator, 2.5-inch wide strap and a rubber band (see the Table of Materials).\nPalpate the ulnar nerve within the ulnar groove of the upper extremity being tested.\n\t\nPlace an \"x\" mark on the skin over the ulnar groove just superior to the line between the olecranon process of the humerus and the medial epicondyle of the ulna.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 2 shows this location on the dorsum of the elbow .\nPlace head of the vibrator onto marked location with handle of massager superior to head.\n\t\nApply the wide strap around handle portion of vibrator and participant's arm.",
    "Place rubber band around neck of vibrator head and participant's arm to hold vibrator head into place and maintain contact between participant's skin and the vibrator head, ensuring that the rubber band is a proper size to retain the head against the skin but not to restrict movement or circulation.\nAsk the participant to bend and straighten his/her elbow. He/she should feel no interference from the straps. If he/she reports interference, adjust the straps and rubber band so that freedom of movement is ensured.\nTurn vibrator on high, wait for 2 min (based on unpublished data).\n\t\nConduct a measure of proprioception performance (results from the tablet version of the BKT are presented here) with the vibrator running on high for the duration of the test\n\t\t\nConduct the BKT. Seat the participant in a standard height chair (18-inch seat height), at a standard height table (29-inch height) with their vision occluded from the tablet using a curtain. Sit across from the participant.\nGuide the participants index finger, held at the distal phalanx only, from the start of the line to the end of the line (target) and back to the start of the line. Release the participant's finger and instruct them to touch the target. Complete 20 trials with each upper limb.\nAssign the participants' scores for each upper limb as the average absolute error (distance from the target) in centimeters.\nConduct psychophysical measures (such as the VDT) immediately upon removal of the vibration stimulus.\n\t\tNOTE: In the results presented, the duration of the vibration stimulus prior to the VDT was 5 ± 1 minute.\n2. Vibration Detection Threshold (adapted from13)",
    "Gather 128 Hz tuning fork, a stopwatch, textbook (provides a firm yet compliant surface on which to strike the tuning fork), table (29-inch height), standard chair (18-inch seat height), masking tape, and pen.\n\t\nCreate a 1 ½ inch x 1 ½ inch square on the textbook using masking tape to be used as a target for consistency in striking the tuning fork.\nUsing a permanent marker, color the bottom 1 mm of the stem of the tuning fork (this mark will be used to standardize the pressure of tuning fork application during the test).\nSeat the participant in the chair at the table. Ask her/him to extend the forearm of the extremity being tested supinated and completely rest it on the table, including the elbow. Ask them to relax the extremities.\n\t\tNOTE: The examiner should be seated across from the participant.\nMark a dot on the skin over the distal biceps tendon, approximately 1 cm superior to the elbow crease.\n\t\nPlace the book at the edge of table closest to participant, between participant's elbows.\nSay: \"This is a test of your ability to detect vibration. Now I will put this tuning fork on your biceps tendon. Please tell me if you feel any vibration, then say 'Now' immediately when the sensation of vibration disappears. This procedure will be repeated 3 times on each arm.\"\nEnsure that the discs at the ends of each prong of the tuning fork are tight prior to beginning. If they are loose they will rattle and reduce the duration of the tuning fork's resonance making the test unreliable.\n\t\nHold the stem of the tuning fork loosely between thumb and index finger and strike it on the book inside of the square target with enough force to produce resonance.",
    "Immediately after striking, place tuning fork on the test location, using enough pressure to depress the skin and conceal the 1 mm band on the tuning fork from vision.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Figure 3 shows the tuning fork on the distal biceps tendon test location used in this protocol.\nUsing the stopwatch, quantify the time from placement of the tuning fork onto participant's skin until the participant no longer feels vibration (says 'Now').\nRepeat two more times on the same arm for a total of three trials.\n\t\t\nCalculate the mean time to disappearance of vibration stimulus across the three trials to determine the vibration detection threshold (VDT).\nSubscription Required.
