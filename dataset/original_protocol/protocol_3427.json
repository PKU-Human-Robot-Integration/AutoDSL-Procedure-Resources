    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1. Methionine-deficient diet\nTiming: 7 days\nThe goal of this step is to reduce the amount of available methionine in cells.\nPut the mice on a methionine-deficient diet for seven days prior to AHA injection to enhance competitive incorporation of the AHA into the nascent polypeptide chain.\nPart 2. AHA injection\nTiming: 3–4 h (for one mouse)\nThis section aims to incorporate AHA, a methionine analog, into the newly synthesized polypeptide chain.\nDissolve the AHA (Click-iT AHA (L-Azidohomoalanine), Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat No. C10102) in sterile 0.9% saline solution.\nAdd 500 μL of sterile 0.9% saline to the 5 mg AHA vial.\nVortex the vial to obtain a transparent solution at 10 μg/μL final concentration.\nInject the AHA (100 μg/ gram of body weight) intraperitoneally (i.p.) and return the mice to their home cages for 3 h.\nNote: To confirm the specificity of the AHA incorporation, inject another group of mice with a protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (dissolve anisomycin in saline 0.9% to obtain a 40 μM solution and inject at 100 mg/kg (i.p.) one hour before the AHA injection).\nCritical: As stress can potentially affect protein synthesis, minimize the animal’s stress level by returning the mouse to its home cage immediately after AHA injection and keep the cage in a quiet and well-ventilated place until perfusion step.\nPart 3. Perfusion and brain extraction\nTiming: 2 days\nThe purpose of this step is to prepare the brains for click chemistry and immunohistology experiments.\nAnesthetize the mouse using anesthesia machine.\nPlace the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber where the mouse inhales a mixture of oxygen (flowmeter is set at 0.8–1.5 L/min) and 3%–5% isoflurane.",
    "Once the mouse is unconscious, transfer it to the nose cone connected to the anesthesia machine to maintain a stable level of anesthesia.\nAdjust the oxygen flowmeter to 0.4–0.8 L/min and the isoflurane to 2%–2.5%.\nAssess the anesthesia level by pinching the tail or toe with a pair of tweezers. The perfusion can be started only if the surgical level of anesthesia is met.\nCritical: Ensure the mice are deeply anesthetized and reached the surgical level.\nPerfuse the mice transcardially with 4% PFA (refer to Wu et al.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16])\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on its back and tape the four paws to the perfusion board.\nExpose the heart with surgical incisions.\nInsert the 28-gauge needle into the heart from the apex of the left ventricle.\nPerfuse the mouse with 10 mL 1× PBS using a peristaltic pump with 30 RPM (∼2 mL/5 s) flow rate and then switch the 1× PBS to PFA 4% and keep perfusing with 50–100 mL of PFA, depending on the stiffness of the tail and limbs.\nExtract the brain.\nCut and peel the skin and muscles to expose the skull.\nWhile holding the skull firmly with forceps, cut through the skull to expose the brain.\nAfter detaching the cranial nerves and blood vessels, gently scoop out the brain.\nPost-fix the extracted brain in 4% PFA for 12–18 h at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: For each brain, add 7–10 mL of 4% PFA. Keep the extracted brain in 7–10 mL of 4% PFA for 12–18 h at 20°C–22°C.\nUsing the vibratome, cut the brains to obtain 40 μm thickness coronal sections.\nPrepare the ice-cold 1× PBS. Prepare 1 L of ice-cold 1× PBS by placing it at −20°C for 20–30 min.",
    "Prepare the brain. Locate the cerebellum while the brain dorsal side is up and make a transverse cut rostral to the cerebellum and discard the caudal part.\nPrepare the vibratome.\nPrepare the vibratome by filling the slicing chamber with ice-cold 1× PBS and adding ice to the tray surrounding the chamber.\nMount a razor blade on the blade holder of the vibratome.\nSet the vibratome cutting thickness at 40 μm.\nSet the vibratome speed to 0.36 mm/s and amplitude to 1.20 mm.\nStart cutting.\nMount the brain onto the cutting stage of the vibratome using super glue.\nNote: The brain's rostral side is up and the dorsal side is facing the blade.\nStart the vibratome and slowly lower the cutting blade into the 1× PBS solution until it touches the brain’s surface.\nStart cutting the brain.\nCollect the coronal sections in a 24-well plate filled with 1× PBS.\nNote: transfers the free-floating sections using a paint brush to the wells pre-filled with 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nSelect three sections per cortical area/animal and transfer them to a new 24-well plate.\nNote: Cortical sections have been used in this protocol. Sections from other areas such as hippocampus and amygdala can be collected based on the area of interest.\nWash the sections 6 times for 5 min each with 500 μL PBS on rocking shaker at 50 RPM at the 20°C–22°C.\nPart 4. Click chemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nAt this stage, click reactions are used to label the azide group of AHA with the alkyne chemical group present in the fluorescent alkyne antibody, allowing for subsequent visualization.\nBlock the sections for 12–18 h at 4°C in 500 μL of blocking buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% normal goat serum, and 5% sucrose in PBS.",
    "Note: The blocking solution for click chemistry must be freshly prepared.\nNote: the blocking step should be performed on orbital shaker with gentle agitation at 20 RPM.\nPerform 6 washes of 5 min using PBS on rocking shaker with gentile agitation (20–30 RPM).\nNote: aggressive washing (shaking at more than 50 RPM) at this step can interfere with the blocking quality.\nIncubate the sections in 500 μL of click buffer for 12–18 h at 4°C and keep the plate on a shaker at 20 RPM speed, based on the following protocol and order.\nCritical: Add the reagents according to the following order. In click chemistry reactions, the order of the reagent addition ensures that all necessary components are present in the correct form at the appropriate time for the reaction to proceed effectively. An essential step in the click reaction involves adding TRIzol and TCEP before CuSO4. This is a critical step because TRIzol and TCEP play a key role in reducing copper (II) ions (Cu2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]⁺) to copper (I) ions (Cu⁺). These copper (I) ions then catalyze and facilitate the reaction.\nPrepare fresh PBS at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 1 μL of 200 mM TRIzol per 1 mL of click buffer. [Vortex the buffer with high speed for 10 s].\nAdd 1 μL of 500 mM TCEP per 1 mL of click buffer. [Vortex the buffer with high speed for 10 s].\nAdd 1 μL of 2 mM fluorescent Alexa Fluor 647 alkyne per 1 mL of click buffer. [Vortex the buffer with high speed for 10 s].\nNote: There are a variety of Alexa Fluor alkyne antibodies with different wavelengths such as 488, 555, and 647 nm. Consider the wavelength of interest based on the channel you plan to image.",
    "Add 1 μL of 200 mM CuSO4 per 1 mL of click buffer. [Vortex the buffer with high speed for 30 s].\nNote: Protect the click buffer from light. All reagents should be prepared fresh before the click step.\nPart 5. Co-staining with the antibodies of interest\nTiming: 12–18 h\nThe goal of this step is to label different neuronal types using primary antibodies. Use antibodies against CaMKIIα and GAD67 to label excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively.\nWash the sections after the click step 10 times for 5 min each with 500 μL of the “FUNCAT wash buffer” consisting of 0.5 mM EDTA and 1% Tween-20 in PBS on rocking shaker (50 RPM).\nNote: The wash buffer can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks.\nTransfer the sections to a new 24-well plate and block the sections with 500 μL of the immunohistochemistry (IHC) blocking buffer (1% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h at 20°C–22°C on an orbital shaker (20 RPM).\nNote: The blocking solution must be freshly prepared.\nIncubate the blocked sections in the 500 μL of the primary antibody of interest for 12–18 h at 4°C on an orbital shaker.\nNote: The primary antibody should be selected based on the cell types of interest. For example, we used antibodies against CaMKIIα (1:800 dilution, in 1× PBS and 2% NGS) and GAD67 (1:5000 dilution, in 1× PBS and 2% NGS) to identify the excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively.\nWash the sections 3 times for 5 min each with 500 μL PBS on rocking shaker.\nIncubate the sections in 500 μL of corresponding secondary antibody (such as Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500 dilution) at 20°C–22ºC on orbital shaker for 1 h.",
    "Critical: The Alexa Fluor antibody required for this step differs from the Alexa Fluor antibody required for the click chemistry step. Click chemistry requires Alexa Fluor to have an alkyne group in order for the reaction to proceed.\nWash the sections 3 times for 5 min each at 20°C–22°C with 500 μL of PBS.\nPrepare the glass slides, coverslips, and mounting media.\nMount the sections on the slides and cover each section with 20 μL of DAPI-containing mounting media.\nPlace the coverslips, apply the sealant (nail polish), and allow the slides to dry at 20°C–22°C for 2 h and then keep them at 4°C in darkness.\nPart 6. Confocal microscopy\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this part, tissue sections will be imaged using confocal microscopy.\nImage the slides using a confocal microscope. For better resolution and reliable quantification of the AHA signal, use the 63× oil objective in Z-stack mode to capture images.\nUse the 63× oil objective and ensure the objective lens is clean and properly aligned.\nPlace one slide on the microscope stage, adjust the stage and the pinhole size for confocal microscopy.\nChoose lasers with appropriate wavelengths of interest and select proper emission and excitation filters to allow specific wavelengths to pass through.\nAdjust laser power to an optimal level.\nChoose the Z-stacks mode and start imaging. From each region of interest, such as the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus, stacks of 15–20 optical sections spaced at 2–2.5 μm intervals are taken.\nCritical: Avoid the high laser power as it can lead to photobleaching.\nImage at least 3 sections per area (prefrontal cortex) for each mouse.\nNote: Depending on the number of sections, the imaging step may take less or more time.\nPart 7. Quantification and data analysis\nTiming: 2–5 h",
    "This step aims to quantify the AHA signal in the cytoplasm of different neurons to assess the rate of de novo protein synthesis.\nMerge all Z-stacks using Image >> Stacks >> Z project >> Max intensity on ImageJ.\nMeasure the integrated density of the AHA signal in the cytoplasm with the guidance of the neuronal marker and DAPI.\nOpen the merged image using ImageJ.\nFollow the following steps on ImageJ software. Color >> Image >> Channels tool >> select color mode.\nSelect the marker channel. For example, the CAMKIIα channel (red)\nUsing the marker, select one neuron.\nMake a region of interest (ROI) that fits inside the cytoplasm of the neuron.\nThe aim is to measure the AHA signal in the cytoplasm of neurons. One effective technique to ensure that the AHA signal is measured in the cytoplasm, and not in the nucleus, is to confirm that the ROI does not overlap with the nuclear stain, DAPI. Therefore, select the DAPI channel alongside the AHA channel, and only if there is no overlap, the DAPI channel will be de-selected and the AHA signal will be measured. Relocate the ROI if it is not appropriately located within the cytoplasm.\nSelect the AHA channel and deselect the marker and DAPI channels before measuring the integrated density of the AHA.\nNote: to measure the integrated density in ImageJ, select: Analyze >> Set measurement >> Integrated density >> Ctrl + M.\nContinue this procedure with the next neuron until you have quantified the desired number of neurons.",
    "Critical: Once ROI is defined for the first image, it is critical to maintain the same dimensions of ROI across all images and experimental groups. To ensure that the signal quantification remains comparable across different images, the ROI dimensions must be consistent. To achieve this, save your ROI dimensions by using the Ctrl + T key command on your computer. Quantify the AHA signal in 20–40 excitatory or 10 to 20 inhibitory neurons.\nNormalize and analyze the data.\nDivide all values for the control and Fmr1-/y groups by the control’s average, then multiply the result by 100 to normalize the data. The normalized numbers will then be subjected to a student’s t-test statistical analysis.\nNote: Restrict your quantification to the cytoplasm and average the values from each mouse (please refer to quantification and statistical analysis section). This step may take less or more time depending on the number of images."
