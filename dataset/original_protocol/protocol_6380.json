    "For those using the bespoke method, as in Stratford et al. (2019) all steps must be followed. For those using the CytePulse system (Cytecom Ltd), skip to Procedure C “Sample preparation” section. Also, of note, those steps demarcated with an asterisk (*) in the procedure only pertain to those following the bespoke method. If using the CytePulse product and consumables, disregard these steps.Bespoke electrode dish constructionThe following methods are based on the use of an electron beam vapor deposition system. Different methods may vary between different constructions. Figure 2 provides an illustrative instruction.Construct a negative stainless-steel mask (Figure 1). This is done by a Laser Manufacturing Company.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115013115_9789.jpgFigure 1. Negative electrode mask.

Mounting wafer construction process. i. Materials required for mounting wafer construction (1x stainless steel mounting wafer; 4x stainless steel washer; double-sided adhesive tape). ii. Apply double-sided adhesive tape to the bottom of each washer. iii. Secure each washer to the mounting wafer.Place the mask into the glass-bottomed microscope dish (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115013430_9204.jpgFigure 3. Bespoke Electrode Dish Construction; Steps A3-A6. All numbers correspond to their respective steps within the bespoke electrode construction process.Using non-magnetic tweezers place 12 nickel magnets in positions parallel to each electrode. This ensures that the mask is in contact with the glass.Mount the dish with mask, magnets and wire onto the stainless-steel platform on the mounting wafer. Place into the electron vapor deposition system.Deposit the Titanium-Gold Alloy onto the dish using Electron Vapor Deposition (20 nm Ti; 80 nm Au).Remove the dish from the vapor deposition machine. Check the electrode gap is uninterrupted for each position using an optical microscope.Solder 7 copper wires of approximately 5 cm to the corresponding pins of a male IDC connector.",
    "Using the soldering iron, create 7 small holes in the plastic rim of the now patterned glass-bottom electrode dish. Feed each of the copper wires through a hole. Secure the male IDC connector to the rim of the dish with Araldite two-part epoxy.Trim the copper wires to appropriate lengths in order to contact each electrode terminal (including ground) as denoted in Figure 3. Bond the copper wire with conductive graphite epoxy. Once graphite epoxy has solidified, further coat the graphite bond with Araldite two-part epoxy for the purpose of waterproofing.Relay circuit constructionThe following circuit is for controlling electrical stimulation across electrodes. Individual electrodes are gated until triggered either manually or after a predetermined number of microscope images, dependent on user microscope configuration. The bill of materials may be found in Table 2. Code to run the circuit is deposited at github (github.com/ConorEd/ElectrodeStimulation).Solder two female BNC connectors; 6 Relays; 6 1MΩ resistors and two 10-way male IDC connectors to the prototyping board, as shown in Figure 4.Mount the Arduino UNO microcontroller to the prototyping board and connect the Arduino GPIO pins to the circuit as in Figure 4. This may be accomplished by either extruding breadboard jumper wires from the circuit and plugging them into the pins, or creating a ‘shield’ by soldering 2.54 mm pitch header pins to the circuit board.Cut ribbon cable to appropriate lengths to reach the microscope and a signal recording device.Connect two 10-way female IDC connectors to either end of the microscope cable.Connect the Arduino UNO microcontroler to a computer with the USB B cable and upload the code found at www.github.com/ConorEd/ElectrodeStimulation[href=http://www.github.com/ConorEd/ElectrodeStimulation].imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115013524_6919.jpgFigure 4. Relay Circuit Diagram. Detailed schematic for construction of the relay circuit.",
    "Sample preparation (Figures 5 and 6)The method may be applied to many bacterial strains or species, subject to appropriate choice of liquid and solid growth media. Wildtype Bacillus subtilis (NCIB3610) or Escherichia coli (K12), at a density of OD600 = 1.5, serves as a good model organism for the method and was used in Stratford et al., 2019.  The following protocol details the procedure for a culture of wildtype B. subtilis (NCIB3610), OD600 ~1.5. Using cultures treated with or without antibiotic vancomycin, the procedure determines between antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant cells. In Stratford et al. (2019), we showed that cells treated with UV, ethanol or CCCP show the response distinct from untreated proliferative cells. Cells treated with different antimicrobial agents or procedures can be tested for their electrical responses for rapid AST.Note: While this method should apply to a broad range of microbes, adaptation may be required for use with species and/or strains with different growth requirements.LB culture Place a single colony of B. subtilis into 5 ml aliquots of LB liquid media. Use the standard aseptic technique of microbiology.Place in overnight in a shaking incubator (37 °C; 200 rpm). Monitor the optical density of cell cultures using a spectrophotometer, the benchmark OD600 for this procedure at the time of experimentation is approximately 1.5.MSgg liquid culture Centrifuge B. subtilis LB cultures at 3,220 x g (4,000 rpm) for 5 min; retain the pellet and discard the liquid supernatant.Resuspend the pellets in the equal volume of liquid MSgg media supplemented with or without vancomycin (or other antimicrobial agents).Place the culture in a shaking incubator (30 °C; 200 rpm) for 1 h.",
    "Creating agar pads * ~30 min prior to retrieving the cultures, create the agar padsPlace a microscope cover glass on Parafilm, this ensures the liquid MSgg agar solution remains on the cover glass. Add 1 ml of liquid MSgg agar to a single 22 x 22 mm glass slip, carefully covering the whole slip.Immediately place another coverslip on top of the agar, then wait for the agar to solidify. Avoid bubbles to be formed.Using tweezers and scalpel, prize the top glass slide off the solid agar, then cut the agar into ~50 mm2 square pads.Loading samples into electrode dish or Cytecom sample holder (Figures 5 and 6)Add 1.5 μl of cell suspension to each of the agar pads, ensuring the droplet is central and not touching edges of the pad, to prevent lateral pad drifts due to bacterial growth.Wait 10 min for the drop to dry into the agar pad at room temperature.Using a scalpel and tweezers, slowly lift the agar pad from the bottom and flip onto the electrode, sample side down, so as the sample is in direct contact with the electrode.*Note: The agar pads can be very fragile, take care not to break or scratch agar pads. Make sure to place the inoculated side facing the electrode. Close the lid on the dish or Cytecom sample holder to prevent sample drying.Note: If using the Bespoke electrode dish, ensure Parafilm seals the dish shut, to prevent excessive moisture loss from the samples.Preparing sample for microscopySecure the dish in the microscope stage insert. If using an oil immersion lens, add immersion oil onto the bottom of the dish or Cytecom sample holder, over each electrode.Place the stage insert onto the microscope stage.Open MetaMorph (or equivalent microscope operating software).",
    "Locate the position of an electrode and find the correct focus under phase contrast, DIC or brightfield illumination. Save the position of electrode using the microscope software. Repeat this for all 6 electrodes.Note: Add a ‘rest’ position well away from the electrodes, this should be a place for the objective to remain away from the electrodes between imaging sequences. This helps prevent the pads from drying out. Leave the sample to settle in the microscope chamber for 1 h at 30 °C to prevent focus drift due to thermal shift.Time-lapse microscopy settingsSet the microscope parameters as per Table 4. Time-lapse is taken for each position separately.Table 4.

Either manual or microscope-triggered relay control may be set prior to upload within the Arduino IDE.Verify that the electrical stimulation settings are correct (as per Table 5).Turn on the signal generator.*Connect the electrode dish to the device via IDC connector (Figure 7).Table 5.
