    "A schematic diagram depicting the whole experimental procedure is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3964/bioprotoc-11-06-3964-g001.jpgFigure 1. Overview of experimental procedures. (a) RT-LAMP assays can be performed with purified or unpurified clinical specimens and then analyzed using a colorimetric or LAMP-sequencing read-out. (b) Flow-chart of LAMP-sequencing library preparation.RT-LAMP assaysRT-LAMP assay on purified samples Isolate RNA from clinical specimen according to manufacturer’s protocol.Assemble RT-LAMP master mix in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by adding 6.25 μl of the 2× Master Mix, 1.25 μl of 10× primer mix, and 4 μl nuclease-free water per reaction.Vortex and spin down.Distribute 11.5 μl of master mix into each well of a 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.Add 1 μl of isolated RNA into wells with master mix.Seal plate with optically clear adhesive seal.Briefly spin down plate.Incubate for 30 min at 65 °C in a thermocycler (with the lid heated to 75 °C).RT-LAMP assay on unpurified samples For hot swab-to-RT-LAMP assays, pipette 50 μl of clinical specimen into 96-well plate and seal with pierceable foil.Heat up plate for 5 min at 95 °C in 96-well plate in a PCR cycler (with the lid heated to 105 °C).Cool down, spin briefly, and keep plate on ice.Assemble RT-LAMP master mix in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by adding 10 μl of the 2× Master Mix, 2 μl of 10× primer mix, and 7 μl nuclease-free water per reaction.Vortex and spin down.Distribute 19 μl of master mix into each well of a 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.For direct swab-to-RT-LAMP assays, pipette 1 μl of clinical specimen directly into wells with master mix.For hot assays, pipette 1 μl of prepared specimen (1-3) into wells with master mix.Seal plate with optically clear adhesive seal.Briefly spin down plate.",
    "Incubate for 30 min at 65 °C in a thermocycler (with the lid heated to 75 °C).RT-LAMP assay analysisColorimetric read-out Cool down 96-well plate to 4 °C and spin down briefly.Place 96-well plate into absorbance reader.Measure absorbance at 434 nm and 560 nm.LAMP-sequencing (All concentrations are given as final concentrations in reactions.) Prepare transposon adapters by mixing individual barcoded adapter (P5-UMI-xi5XXX-ME.fw) with the primer Tn5hY-Rd2-Wat-SC3 at a final concentration of 25 μM per primer in 5 μM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a 96-well PCR plate using the Liquidator. Heat up to 99 °C for 5 min and let the primers slowly anneal by cooling down to 20 °C within 15 min using a thermocycler.Mix transposase to a final concentration of 100 ng/µl with 1.25 μM annealed adapters from step 1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in 96-well PCR plates using the Liquidator. Assemble transposons by incubating the reaction for 1 h at 23 °C in a thermocycler.Freshly prepare the 5× tagmentation buffer according to the indicated composition.Per well mix 1.2 μl of the RT-LAMP product (equivalent to ~200 ng DNA) with 1.5 μl of loaded transposase, 1.12 µl 5× tagmentation buffer from step 3 and 1.8 µl water to assemble the transposon reactions in 96-well PCR plates with the Liquidator. Incubate reactions at 55 °C for 10 min in a thermocycler.Stop the tagmentation reactions by adding 1.13 µl 0.2% SDS per well and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Pool the reactions into one single reaction each plate.Perform size selection for fragments of approximately 300 to 600 bp by using the following two-step AMPure XP bead protocol (written for a pooled reaction from one plate).Mix 50 µl of pooled reaction with 50 µl of water.",
    "Remove large fragments by adding 55 µl of AMPure XP beads to the diluted samples. Mix by pipetting ten times and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Separate beads from supernatant by placing on a magnetic stand for ~5 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh eppendorf tube using a pipette without transferring beads.Remove small fragments by adding 25 µl of fresh beads to the supernatant. Mix by pipetting ten times and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Separate beads from supernatant by placing on a magnetic stand for ~5 min. Discard the supernatant containing the small fragments using a pipette without disturbing the bead pellet.Wash DNA bound to beads by two washes with ethanol. For this, add 200 µl ethanol (80%) to the beads, mix by pipetting ten times and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Separate beads from ethanol by placing on a magnetic stand for ~5 min. Repeat this for a second wash. Let the beads air-dry for 10 min.Elute DNA from beads by adding 10 μl of 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), incubating for 5 min at room temperature and separating on a magnetic rack for ~5 min.Perform one PCR reaction per plate using 1 µl of size-selected eluate from step 6 as a template. Prepare PCR reactions with RT-LAMP-specific and Tn5-adapter-specific primers (P7nxt-GeneN-A-LBrc and P7-xi7YYY, P5.fw) with the NEBNext Q5 HotStart polymerase according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Use the following PCR conditions for amplification with a thermocycler: Two cycles at 62 °C for annealing and 90 s elongation, followed by two cycles at 65 °C for annealing and 90 s elongation, and 13 cycles at 72 °C annealing and 90 s elongation.",
    "Pool all PCR reactions and perform a second size selection for fragments of approximately 400 to 550 bp: Run 20% of the pooled PCR reactions on a 2% agarose/Tris-acetate-EDTA gel, cut out the respective part of the lane and use a gel purification kit according to the manufacturer.Quantify the library using for example a qPCR-based library quantification kit.Perform a custom Illumina sequencing run on a NextSeq 550 machine based on the instructions of the manufacturer using 20% phiX spike-in and 136 cycles for the first read, 11 cycles to read the 11-nt-long plate index (i7) and 20 cycles to read the 11-nt-long well index (i5) and the 9-nt-long UMI."
