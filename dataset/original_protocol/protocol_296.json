    "**Preparation of single-cell suspension from murine secondary lymphoid tissues:**\n**1.** Prepare single-cell suspensions of murine secondary lymphoid tissues, e.g. lymph nodes or spleen, in PBS. One convenient method is to gently disrupt the tissues between the frosted ends of microscope slides. Filter cell suspension through fine mesh. Collect cells in 5ml or 15ml conical tubes.\n_Note: Tfh cells can be assessed in other tissues as well. Pilot experiments should be performed to ensure that enzymatic digestions needed to release single cell suspensions do not interfere with antibody detection of CXCR5, PD-1 or BCL6._\n**2.** Optional: Red blood cell lysis \\(recommended for spleen).\n**3.** Spin down cells in centrifuge, discard supernatant, and resuspend pellet in PBS.\n**4.** Count cells.\n**5.** Adjust cell numbers with PBS and add ≤3x10<sup>6</sup> cells in 100µl per well of a 96-well round-bottom plate.\n**6.** Continue with step **7** or step **17**.\n**Staining protocol for identification of viable CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Tfh cells for analysis and/or sorting:**\n**7.** Prepare primary antibody 2x mixes in flow buffer in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes. Calculate with 20µl volume to be added per well of the plate \\(40µl final staining volume). If several samples are to be stained, calculate the total volume needed by multiplying the number of samples by the volume of the 2x mix to be added to each well of sample \\(20µl), e.g. for 10 samples: 10x 20µl + 40µl extra void volume = 240µl. Include anti-CXCR5-biotin \\(1:25 for 2x mix; final dilution will be 1:50), anti-CD4, and anti-PD-1. Also prepare compensation control stains if necessary. Keep tubes on ice until needed.\n_Note: Optimal dilutions of antibodies should be determined in pilot experiments. B cells express high levels of CXCR5 and can be used as a positive control for this chemokine._",
    "_Note: Right before use, spin tubes in a microcentrifuge for 3min at full speed to remove excess protein aggregates; only use supernatant._\n**8.** Spin down plate at 700g for 2min, discard supernatant by quickly flicking the plate, and loosen cell pellet by briefly vortexing the plate on full speed setting \\(add a paper towel on top of the plate to avoid any potential spill-over)\n**9.** Wash cells with 200µl flow buffer \\(for analysis only use flow buffer with 0.05% sodium azide, for sorting viable cells use flow buffer without sodium azide).\n**10.** Repeat step **8**.\n**11.** Add 20µl of blocking solution: 5µg/ml anti-CD16/32 \\(“Fc-block”) and 2% normal mouse serum/2% normal rat serum in flow buffer. Incubate for 5min on ice.\n**12.** Add 20µl of 2x primary antibody mixes \\(from step **7**) on top of the blocking solution \\(don’t wash in between). Incubate for 30-40min on ice. \n**13.** Add 160µl of flow buffer and repeat step **8** and **9** and again **8**.\n**14.** Add 40µl of streptavidin-APC \\(0.5µg/ml final concentration in flow buffer) per well and incubate for 15-20min on ice.\n**15.** Repeat step **8** and **9**.\n**16.** Resuspend cells in flow buffer for subsequent analysis on a flow cytometer or for cell sorting. Include a viability dye \\(e.g. 7-AAD) that allows for the exclusion of dead cells, e.g. resuspend cells in 100µl flow buffer and add 1µl of 7-AAD.\n_Note: Exclusion of dead cells is a very critical step, as dying cells stain non-specifically with antibodies for CXCR5 and PD-1._\n**Staining protocol for identification of CXCR5<sup>+</sup>BCL6<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells for analysis:**\n**17.** Following steps **1** through **6**, add 100µl of 1:1000-diluted eFluor780 Fixable Viability Dye \\(eBioscience) in PBS \\(no serum/protein, no sodium azide) to the 100µl of cells. Incubate for 10min on ice.",
    "_Note: Exclusion of dead cells is a very critical step, as dying cells stain non-specifically with antibodies for CXCR5, PD-1, and BCL6._\n**18.** Follow steps **7** through **15** for regular surface staining.\n**19.** Prepare Fixation/Permeabilization solution as well as Permeabilization buffer from the eBioscience FoxP3 staining buffer set according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n**20.** Loosen cell pellet and add 100µl Fixation/Permeabilization solution from the eBioscience FoxP3 staining buffer set per well and incubate for 15min at room temperature.\n**21.** Prepare transcription factor antibody 2x mixes in Permeabilization buffer from the eBioscience FoxP3 staining buffer set in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes. Calculate with 20µl volume to be added per well of the plate \\(40µl final staining volume). If several samples are to be stained, calculate the total volume needed by multiplying the number of samples by the volume of the 2x mix to be added to each well of sample \\(20µl), e.g. for 10 samples: 10x 20µl + 40µl extra void volume = 240µl. Include anti-BLC6-PE antibody \\(1:25 for 2x mix; final dilution will be 1:50) and/or other transcription factor antibodies. Also prepare compensation control stains if necessary. Keep tubes on ice until needed.\n_Note: Optimal dilutions of antibodies should be determined in pilot experiments. If available, GC B cells express high levels of BCL6 and can be used as a positive control._\n_Note: Right before use, spin tubes in a microcentrifuge for 3min at full speed to remove excess protein aggregates; only use supernatant._\n**22.** Add 100µl Permeabilization buffer from the eBioscience FoxP3 staining set to the 100µl of cells per well and spin down.\n**23.** Wash 1x with 200µl Permeabilization buffer.",
    "**24.** Loosen cell pellet and add 20µl of blocking solution: 5µg/ml anti-CD16/32 \\(“Fc-block”) and 2% normal mouse serum/2% normal rat serum in Permeabilization buffer. Incubate for 5min at room temperature.\n**25.** Add 20µl of 2x transcription factor antibody mixes \\(from step **21**) on top of the blocking solution \\(don’t wash in between). Incubate for 30-40min at room temperature.\n**26.** Wash 2x with Permeabilization buffer.\n**27.** Resuspend cells in flow buffer for acquisition on a flow cytometer."
