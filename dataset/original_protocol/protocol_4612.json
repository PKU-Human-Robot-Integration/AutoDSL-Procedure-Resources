    "All experiments must be performed under an IACUC approved protocol. For human tissue xenografts, the appropriate IRB approvals must also be met.ScheduleAllow tumor in mice to develop to at least 0.5 cm and up to 1.5 cm according to specific protocols for ectopic or orthotopic xenografts of cells or fresh tissue (PDX model) as well as other tumor models (e.g., transgenic tumor model).PreparationsThe day before Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) experiment:Pre-label Al squares with date, mouse number and tissue (e.g., tumor), and blood collection tubes (2 per mouse for collection immediately after tracer injection, and at the time of necropsy) with date, mouse number, collection time.Label storage box for -80 °C freezer.Prepare tracer solutions e.g., 25% 13C6-glucose (1.344 M) or 36.2 mg/ml 13C5, 15N2-Gln (0.2 M) in sterile PBS, sterile filter, and store in aliquots at < -20 °C. Label formalin bottles with date, mouse number and tumor source.Assemble all components in sealable boxes for transport.Prepare schedule sheet (see example below, Table 1).Tracer InjectionWhen mice are ready, restrain the mouse in the mouse restrainer, sterilize the injection area of the tail vein using a sterile wipe. Inject stable isotope tracers through the tail vein (or other convenient vein, such as submandibular vein) into individual immobilized mice*. Placing the mouse on a warming blanket or gently heating the tail visibly dilates the vein to make injection easier. Record time of injection.Immediately take blood sample (see step 5 below).For 13C6-glucose (can be purchased from Sigma Isotec or Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories, see above): Inject 80 µl (20 mg) each 25% (w/v) stock solution (in PBS and 0.2 µm sterile filtered) at 15 min intervals 3 times (total = 322 µmol). For 13C5, 15N2-Gln: Same as above except for injecting 200 µl (7.2 mg) each 36.2 mg/ml stock solution (in PBS and 0.",
    "2 µm sterile filtered) at 15 min intervals 3 times (total = 142 µmol).The bolus injections take a few seconds. The extremely high heart rate of mice (500-600 beats per minute for resting adult mice) ensures that the tracer is systemically distributed very rapidly, therefore approximating a pulse.Note: *We have tried injection into ketamine-anesthetized mice. Since anesthesia slows metabolism, the timing has to be lengthened. Anesthesia can also alter metabolism. With the physical restraint method, it is important to minimize stress to the restrained mice during injection. Black mice are more difficult to inject via tail vein. The ability to do timed injections reproducibly takes considerable practice. Tissue harvestAt 45 min after the first injection (15 min after the last injection), take photographs of the mouse and the tumor.Take blood sample before killing mice by cervical dislocation (do not use CO2 asphyxiation or lethal injection of barbiturates as they interfere with metabolism) Measure tumor size using calipers (Figure 1).Dissect relevant tissues, e.g., tumor, lung, liver, heart, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, adipose, lower bowel and flash freeze tissues immediately (within 5 min of necropsy) in liquid N2, followed by placing frozen tissues in screw-cap 2 ml microfuge tubes pre-equilibrated in liquid N2 or in aluminum foil (made into a boat shape) floating on liquid N2, followed by wrapping**.Note: **Use non-erasable (solvent-resistant) permanent ink Sharpie pens to label sample tubes or aluminum foil to avoid label washout.The order of dissection is dictated mainly by the major organ of interest, which should be removed first if possible. Dissected tissue is rinsed briefly in cold PBS, blotted and flash-frozen in liquid N2 within 2-6 min of euthanasia.Tumor should be rinsed in cold PBS, blotted and weighed before flash freezing in lN2 (Figure 1) and photographed.",
    "Typically at least three people are needed for this work.With multiple injections, it is practical to do three mice as a group, timing injections 5 min apart. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151119/20151119014127_0747.jpgFigure 1.

Tumor pieces being weighed after blotting.Blood sample processing Blood should be collected***immediately into K2-EDTA microtubes ['purple top'] (designed for mice) after tracer injection (1st) and just prior to necropsy (2nd). Initial blood collection should be no more than 150 µl; collect as much blood as possible for the 2nd collection. Let blood stand at room temperature for 5 min before storage on ice****. Centrifuge blood at 3,500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Separate plasma from blood cells and flash freeze the separated components in liquid N2.Notes:EDTA anticoagulant is preferred over citrate, heparin etc. as EDTA interferes least with metabolism***We collect blood intraorbitally or via the submandibular vein using a lancet which is generally preferred (Golde et al., 2005); other methods may be applicable (e.g., from other vein) and at sacrifice, cardiac punch for maximal blood collection.****It is important to keep blood at RT for 5 min to reduce hemolysis but store blood on ice thereafter until centrifugation.All samples are stored at -80 °C or colder.If necessary, samples for analysis should be shipped overnight on dry ice.Metabolites are extracted from tissues and blood according to established protocols, and then analyzed by high resolution NMR, GC-MS, and FT-ICR-MS to establish not only the content of metabolites, but also their labeled isotopomer and isotopologue distributions, which represents metabolic transformation from the source tracer to the observed metabolites in the interval between injection and necropsy (Fan et al., 2011; Fan, 2012a; Fan et al.",
    ", 2012; Lane et al., 2011)."
