    "1. Preparation of Fluorescent-labeled Cholesterol and Lipid-lowering Drugs\nNOTE: Fluorescent-labeled cholesterol aggregates and statins were prepared as described in our previous article21. Please see Table of Materials for details of reagents, imaging flow cytometer, chemistry analyzers, and data analysis software used in this study.\nSolubilize fluorescent-labeled lyophilized cholesterol (1 mg, Ex/Em = 495 nm/507 nm) powder in 1 mL of 100% alcohol.\nCentrifuge the sample for 3 min at 2,040 x g and use the supernatants containing soluble fluorescence-labeled cholesterol aggregates in the plaque array assay.\nFor the preparation of drugs, individually solubilize the powders (2 mg) of simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, and omega-3 fatty acid in 1 ml of 100% alcohol.\nAfter centrifugation for 3 min at 2,040 x g, use the supernatants containing drugs in the assay.\nSimilarly, solubilize individually the powders (2 mg) of fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, niacin, and fibrate in 1 mL of deionized water to make a stock solution of 2 mg/mL.\nAfter centrifugation for 3 min at 2,040 x g, use the supernatants containing drugs in the plaque array assay.\n2. Plaque Array Assay for Examining In Vitro Cholesterol Particles Formation\nUse chemistry analyzer-1 (see Table of Materials) to set up the plaque array assay for cholesterol particles formation. Perform the assay in a round bottom, low protein binding 96-well plate using the reagents prepared in Section 1. Maintain the final reaction volume in each well at 200 µL and perform all assays in triplicate.\nFirst, load 194.5 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to each well.\nTo each well, add 2.5 µL (5 µg) of each lipid-lowering drug solution and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate to uniformly mix the drug into solution. No drug is added to the negative control samples.",
    "Finally, add 2 µL (2 µg) fluorescent-labeled cholesterol aggregate solution to each well and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate.\nIncubate the plate on a lab shaker for 2 h set at 37 °C and 200 rpm.\nAfter incubation, acquire the images of particles by imaging flow cytometry.\n3. Capturing Images of Cholesterol Particles Using Imaging Flow Cytometry\nOpen the data acquisition template to load the correct instrument settings. Click \"File\", then select \"Open Template…\" and select the template file.\nClick \"Flush, Lock, Load\" to prepare the instrument for sample loading.\nWhen the \"Load Sample\" dialogue box opens, click \"OK\" to load 50 µL of the samples from each well prepared in Section 2 into the imaging flow cytometer.\nClick \"Run|Setup\" to view the particles in the imaging area in real time.\nWhen the particles in the imaging area are in good focus, click \"Run|Acquire\" to acquire images of each object simultaneously in a high-throughput manner for dark field (side scatter/SSC), bright field (BF), green fluorescence, and yellow fluorescence.\nRepeat steps 3.2 - 3.5 to acquire 5,000 - 10,000 particles from each sample.\nAnalyze all raw image files using the image analysis software for determining object fluorescence intensity and morphological variations.\nClick the \"Tools\" button at the top of the image analysis software, then select \"Batch Data Files\" from the drop-down menu, which will open the \"Batches\" window.\nIn the \"Batches\" window, click the \"Add Batch\" button, which will open the \"Define a Batch\" window.\nIn the \"Define a Batch\" window, click the \"Add Files\" button and select the raw image files, click the \"Template\" button and select the appropriate data analysis template file, then select \"OK\" and \"Submit Batches\" to begin processing and analysis of the raw image files.",
    "4. Plaque Array Assay Based Evaluation of Lipid-lowering Drugs Effect on Purified Cholesterol Particles\nAs described in step 2.1, perform the cholesterol particles formation assay using purified VLDL, LDL, and HDL lipoproteins/particles. Perform the plaque array assay in a 96-well plate.\nFirst, load all wells with PBS; use a 200 µL final volume for each well.\nFor negative control, add 4 µg VLDL, LDL, or HDL proteins/particles individually in each well without drugs and shake the plate for 30 s.\nFor examining the lipid-lowering drug effect, add 4 µg VLDL, LDL, or HDL proteins/particles individually to each well and shake the plate for 30 s.\nFor wells added with 4 µg VLDL, LDL, or HDL, add 2.5 µL (5 µg) ezetimibe, lovastatin, simvastatin, or niacin solution and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it in chemistry analyzer-1.\nFinally, add 2 µL (2 µg) fluorescence-labeled cholesterol aggregate solution to all wells and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate.\nIncubate the plate for 2 h in a lab shaker set at 37 °C and 200 rpm.\nAcquire the samples using imaging flow cytometry following steps 3.1 - 3.5.\nAnalyze raw image files using image analysis software as described in step 3.7.\nIn the analysis template, use the following gating scheme for identification of cholesterol particles subpopulations.\nOn a plot of green channel saturated pixel count (x-axis) and dark field channel saturated pixel count (y-axis), reject objects with one or more saturated pixels in either channel.\nPlot the objects/particles without saturated pixels using green channel intensity (x-axis) and SSC intensity (y-axis): objects fall into one of three regions (VLDL, LDL, HDL) based on their green channel and SSC intensities.",
    "NOTE: These gates were created based on data generated from control experiments carried out using purified VLDL, LDL, and HDL particles/proteins without the drug.\nTo determine the lipid-lowering drug effect for each sample, calculate the total lipoprotein particles concentrations, as well as the percentage of each subpopulation (VLDL, LDL, HDL) as described in step 6.5.\nCalculate the particle concentrations (particles/mL) using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56596/56596eq1.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: The VLDL, LDL, and HDL gating regions in the fluorescence dot-plot detect ~ 80% of their respective subpopulations, and the remaining ~ 20% of the particles overlap with other gating regions.\n5. Measurement of Lipid Concentrations in the Serum Samples\nFor determining concentrations of LDL, HDL, cholesterol, and triglycerides by chemistry analyzer-2, use serum samples obtained from age-matched normal and dyslipidemia subjects.\nDefine abnormal concentration of LDL, HDL, cholesterol, and triglycerides based on their concentration identified beyond the upper and lower reference values in serum samples.\nFollow the normal reference value recommended by the reagent manufacturer: cholesterol (4 - 200 mg/dL), HDL (3.0 - 65 mg/dL), LDL (4 - 100 mg/dL), and triglycerides (9 - 200 mg/dL).\nIdentify serum samples that have an abnormal value as either below the lower reference value or above the higher reference value for cholesterol and triglycerides, and use them for screening in the presence and absence of lipid-lowering drugs.\n6. Analyzing the Effect of Drugs on Cholesterol Particles Formation in Serum Samples\nUse the chemistry analyzer-1 to set up the plaque array assay for cholesterol particles formation in serum samples. Perform the assay in a round bottom, low protein binding 96-well plate. Use a final reaction volume of 200 µL/well and perform all assays in triplicate.\nPrepare the plate by loading reagents in a stepwise manner.\nPrepare the control wells.\nLoad 193 µL of PBS to each well.",
    "Add 2.5% (v/v) patient serum (only one serum sample per well) and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on chemistry analyzer reaction plate.\nAdd 2 µL (2 µg) of fluorescence-labeled cholesterol aggregate solution into each well and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on a chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate.\nPrepare the wells with drugs.\nLoad 191 µL of PBS to each well.\nAdd 2.5% (v/v) patient serum (only one serum sample per well) and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on a chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate.\nAdd 2 µL ezetimibe, lovastatin, simvastatin or niacin solution (4 µg) to all wells except the negative control wells. Add only one drug per well and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on a chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate.\nAdd 2 µL of fluorescence-labeled cholesterol aggregate solution (2 µg) into each well and shake the plate for 30 s by placing it on chemistry analyzer-1 reaction plate.\nLoad drugs only after all wells (control and drug-treated) have been loaded with their respective serum samples, and add fluorescence-labeled cholesterol at the end of this step.\nIncubate the plate for 2 h in a lab shaker set at 37 °C and 200 rpm.\nAcquire the samples by imaging flow cytometer following settings described in steps 3.1 - 3.6.\nUse the image analyzing software for batch processing all the image files using the same template as described in steps 3.7.\nPerform the data analysis by drawing gates on the plot as described in steps 4.5 and 4.6.\nTo determine the lipid-lowering drug effect/response (low, moderate, and high) for each sample, calculate the total lipoprotein particle concentration, as well as the percentage of the total particles comprising of VLDL, LDL, and HDL subpopulations.",
    "Plot the VLDL, LDL, and HDL populations on a histogram of the object's bright field image, width subtracted from length (length - width), and gate into either globular or linear regions: objects with (length - width) ≤2 µm fall into the globular region for calculating the percentage of globular and linear shaped particles.\nCompare the percentage of globular and linear shaped LDL and HDL cholesterol particles identified for each serum sample incubated with and without each drug. Among triplicate values obtained for each serum sample, accept the percentage of globular and linear shaped LDL and HDL particles that fall within SD ±2 range for determination of the drug effect."
