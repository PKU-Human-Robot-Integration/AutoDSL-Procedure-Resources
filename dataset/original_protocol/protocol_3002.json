    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFertilized egg collection at 15-min interval\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes egg collection to acquire a large number of embryos at desired stages for nuclei isolation.\nRemove the divider for fish mating (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A):\nNote: Zebrafish initiate breeding after the onset of light. Mature oocytes of female fish would degrade without spawning after midnoon. Therefore, this step is generally done between 8 and 12 o’clock in the morning.\nExchange water with fresh system water to remove excrement in the bottom tank.\nPrepare an equal number of alternative bottom tanks filled with fresh water for transferring inner tanks.\nRemove the dividers from all tanks quickly, and set a timer of 15 min for egg collection.\nNote: The duration of each cleavage before MBT is 15 min for zebrafish embryos at 28.5°C. Therefore, we set a 15-min interval for easy collection of abundant embryos at a matchable stage.\nCollect eggs in batches at 15-min interval. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTransfer all inner tanks to the alternative bottom tanks once the 15-min time is up (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nSet the next 15-min timer again immediately.\nCollect fertilized eggs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPour most water and leave about 35 mL water to drown eggs, once fertilized eggs sink to the bottom of bottom tank .\nGently pour eggs into a 100-mm dish. Each dish can accommodate a maximum of 1000 eggs.\nMark every dish with spawning time, fish strain, approximate number of eggs, date, and owner’s name.\nExchange the water with Holtfreter’s solution, and incubate at 28.5°C.\nRepeat the above steps for 2 or 3 times once the next 15-min timer is up (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, left).",
    "Note: Different batches of embryos can be pooled when they develop to a matchable developmental stage (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, left). Fertilization time can be controlled by managing divider removal time to collect embryos at different developmental stages at the same time (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNuclei exposure of zebrafish early embryos\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nThis step provides details on nuclei exposure from zebrafish early embryos at desired stages around MBT.\nCollect zebrafish early embryos at desired stages with chorion detached:\nMonitor zebrafish early embryonic development under a microscope by referring to the classical developmental stage definition and developmental time at 28.5°C9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: Unfertilized eggs, abnormal or degraded embryos (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) should be picked out in advance.\nNote: Several batches of fertilized eggs were collected with 15-min interval, so embryos from different batches were also collected with 15-min interval to achieve the same developmental stage. Therefore, the collection and deyolking processes of embryos from different batches are timely overlapped (steps 3a – 4h) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, right). Prepare the next batch when the previous one is in centrifugation, standing, or pause point.\nNote: About 20 min before the embryos reach a desired stage, move on to the next step.\nPrepare embryos for pronase treatment.\nTransfer embryos to a suitable dish, such as a 35-mm dish for about 2000 embryos.\nAspirate surplus Holtfreter’s solution to a minimum level while the embryos are still submerged.\nAdd 30 mg/mL pronase stock solution into the Holtfreter’s solution to a final concentration of about 1 mg/mL.\nNote: Static electricity from plastic or scratches on the surface of recycled plastic dish may disrupt embryonic yolk. Therefore, glass dishes or plastic dishes coated with 3–4 mm thick 2% agarose, which is prepared in Holtfreter’s solution, are strongly recommended.\nIncubate at 28.5°C for about 7 min.",
    "Fill the dish with Holtfreter’s solution to dilute and wash out the reaction solution when chorion of about 1/3 embryos are broken.\nNote: Excessive digestion would be harmful to embryos and reduce the efficiency of nuclei isolation, so stop pronase digestion once partial chorions are detached. Shrunken chorions in the rest of embryos would be detached after being washed with Holtfreter’s solution.\nWash embryos with Holtfreter’s solution for additional two or more times in order to remove detached chorion and residual pronase as much as possible.\nNote: Residual pronase would affect the efficiency of nuclei isolation.\nTransfer the embryos to a 1.5-mL EP tube on ice, after confirming that the majority of the embryos have reached the desired stage under a microscope.\nNote: Fertilized eggs were collected every 15 min, which is the length of one cleavage before MBT, so most embryos in one batch develop to a matchable stage at the same time. Furthermore, only embryos with formed nuclei, which are beyond mitosis, are suitable for nuclei isolation. Thus, it is better to quickly check by microscopy if most embryos stay at interphase, at which cells are just cleaved from the previous stage with obvious cell boundary, and then harvest embryos.\nCritical: Transfer no more than 500 embryos into one 1.5-mL EP tube, otherwise efficient deyolking process may not be achieved. 500 chorion-removed embryos settle to a volume of about 0.1 mL. Generally, 1–8 EP tubes are set up for embryos at one desired stage in one batch.\nDeyolk zebrafish early embryos:\nAspirate the Holtfreter’s solution, and then wash embryos twice with ice-cold Ringer’s solution. Aspirate the Ringer’s solution.",
    "Add ice-cold Ringer’s solution with final 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (one cocktail tablet is dissolved in 1 mL ddH2O as 50× stock concentration) to each EP tube to a final volume of 1 mL.\nAdd 67 μL 8% PFA to each EP tube to a final concentration of about 0.5% PFA. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: This step significantly helps preserve early embryonic nuclei and enhances the efficiency of intact nuclei isolation. The thickness of the nuclear envelope in zebrafish early embryos before MBT is typically thinner than that after MBT.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This may explain the reduced toughness of early embryonic nuclei.\nPipette up and down as gently as possible with a 1-mL tip to disrupt yolk.\nNote: Pipetting should be as gentle as possible to prevent cell membrane or even nuclear envelope rupture. Initial deyolking is accomplished when no large yolk granules are visually observed, but it is acceptable for some tiny yolk granules to remain. It is better to transfer 10 μL of suspension into a 35-mm dish and examine blastomere cell integrity under a stereomicroscope.\nNote: For earlier stage embryos (e.g., 16-cell stage) with larger blastomeres, a 1-mL tip could be cut at the most distal tip (about 1 mm long) and polished by fire.\nPlace the tube lying on bench top at room temperature for 5 min (starting the timer when PFA is added).\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL cold Ringer’s solution (containing protease inhibitor cocktail) with 1-mL tips.\nPellet blastomeres by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant with minimal residual just covering the pellet.",
    "Optional: Wash blastomeres with ice-cold Ringer’s solution one more time if the yolk is not removed well. Blastomeres look white in the upper layer of the pellet, while the yolk looks pale yellow in the lower layer.\nPause point: The pellet could stay on ice for up to about 30 min. This allows collection and deyolking of more embryos from other batches (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, right), which were collected at 15-min interval in step 2.\nGently resuspend the blastomere pellet in 200 μL ice-cold PBS once blastomeres from all batches are collected.\nPool suspensions from up to 5 tubes into one EP tube, and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nHypotonic treatment of blastomeres for nuclei exposure:\nAspirate PBS as much as possible.\nNote: Too much residual PBS would alter the concentration of hypotonic buffer and affect hypotonic treatment.\nAdd 200 μL ice-cold hypotonic buffer into each tube.\nGently resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down with a 200-μL tip.\nIncubate on ice for 5 min.\nGently pass blastomeres thrice through a 21-G needle connected to the hub of a 1-mL syringe (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nNote: For other cell types, the length of incubation, the handling procedure of the needle, and the number of passes are required to be optimized empirically. A short incubation of 5 minutes and gentle handling of the needle for three times are sufficient for zebrafish early embryos to release nuclei, whereas a longer incubation and more harsh handling may be required for some tissue cells or culture cells.\nPass the blastomere suspension through a 40-μm cell strainer.\nCritical: This step removes large particles of undisrupted embryonic remnants such as residual yolk, which would otherwise compete for silicon chip attachment for FESEM or reduce the purity of nuclei for mass spectrometry.",
    "Centrifuge the filtrate at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: The pellet contains a crude nuclear fraction likely contaminated with mitochondria and other membrane fractions.\nNote: The pellet is now ready for nuclei exposure onto the silicon chip for FESEM analysis. Alternatively, this crude nuclear pellet may be further purified for additional mass spectrometry analysis or other applications such as RNA-seq.\nNuclei collection and sample preparation for FESEM\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis step is for nuclei preparation of FESEM analysis.\nLoad nuclei onto the silicon chip:\nDiscard the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of PBS + 10% glycerol.\nTransfer the cell suspension to 900 μL of PBS + 10% glycerol inside the improvised centrifugation holder (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPut the device inside a conventional 50-mL tube densely stuffed with facial tissues to a certain level (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C in a swing-bucket rotor (e.g., Eppendorf 5810 R).\nNote: The nuclei and cell debris are spread onto the silicon chip at this step. The improvised centrifugation holder helps spread the nuclei and other residual cellular components.\nPre-fixation of nuclei on the silicon chip (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B): Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2751-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic illustration of solution exchange for preparation of FESEM samples\n(A) Place silicon chips, with the nuclei attached side facing upwards, in the wells of a 48-well cell culture plate for FESEM sample preparation. Solution exchange is accomplished through the transfer of silicon chips between two wells.",
    "(B) Scheme of solution exchange involving the transfer of a silicon chip between two wells. For the first solution exchange, introduce solution into the second well (e.g., B1), and then transfer the silicon chip using a high precision tweezer to the second well (e.g., B1). For the second solution exchange, remove the solution from the first well (e.g., A1), replace it with new solution, and then transfer the chip again. Repeat the subsequent exchange in the same way.\n(C) Schematic of dehydration through a graded ethanol series. A graded ethanol series is achieved by removing some of the old solution and introducing the same amount of ethanol. Repeat for each step and final step in 100% ethanol is done by transferring chips between wells as shown in (B).\nCarefully transfer the silicon chip into a 48-well cell culture plate filled with 1 mL PBS for washing.\nNote: Use high precision tweezers to transfer the silicon chip. Keep track of the chip and make sure not to turn over the chip.\nTransfer the chip to another well in the plate filled with 2% PFA + 2% GA solution. Fix for 30 min at room temperature, or overnight (typically 8–16 h in this protocol) at 4°C under dark condition.\nNote: Avoid the chip being dried during all processes. To achieve this goal, we transfer the chip using high precision tweezers between two wells filled with solution in advance.\nPost-fixation of nuclei on the silicon chip:\nWash the chip thrice in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 2 min each.\nNote: Add an equal volume of ddH2O to 0.2 M cacodylate buffer for a final concentration of 0.1 M.\nPost-fix samples in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 10 min at room temperature under dark condition.",
    "Note: Mix an equal volume of 2% OsO4 and 0.2 M cacodylate buffer freshly.\nNote: OsO4 is highly toxic. Store at −20°C and be protected from light anytime. Wear gloves, protective clothing, and safety goggles to handle this solution in a chemical hood at any step. The liquid waste should be wet-sealed by vegetable oil and treated according to institutional instruction.\nTransfer the silicon chip to a new 48-well cell culture plate filled with ddH20 and wash for 2 min.\nNote: The ddH2O should be filtered through a 0.22-μm filter before use.\nNote: The used plate should be properly treated according to institutional instruction after OsO4 treatment.\nRepeat ddH2O wash for additional two times, 2 min each.\nDehydration and critical point drying (CPD):\nDehydrate through a graded ethanol series: 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 95%, 3 min each, and twice repeat for each step. Finally, transfer the silicon chip to 100% ethanol, 6 × 3 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nPause point: Samples can be stored in 100% ethanol overnight.\nTransfer the silicon chip to a CPD apparatus (e.g., Leica EM CPD 300) filled with ethanol for drying.\nNote: Exchange with high purity liquid CO2 for 12 times to ensure the complete exchange of fluid. Finally, the CO2 is converted to gas under its critical point of specific temperature and pressure so that the specimens on the chip get dried.\nNote: The samples will be examined with FESEM under vacuum, and thus the fixed biological samples must be fully dried beforehand. However, if aqueous biological samples are directly air-dried, the surface of the specimens would be damaged due to surface tension.",
    "Note: The critical point is the intrinsic physical property of a liquid. It is the specific pressure and temperature that allow a liquid and its vapor to coexist. The critical point of water is 374 °C and 229 bar, but CO2’s critical point is 31°C and 74 bar, making it more compatible with biological samples. However, water and CO2 are not miscible, so ethanol is used as an intermediary fluid. The aqueous biological samples should be dehydrated first through a graded series of ethanol.\nNote: The dried samples should be processed to the next step of sputter coating as soon as possible. Otherwise, the dried samples should be stored in a desiccator for a short time under vacuum.\nSputter coating and FESEM imaging:\nTransfer the silicon chip onto aluminum stab covered with a carbon adhesive tab, and then transfer it to a sputter-coating apparatus.\nCoat the specimens with 10-nanometre thick gold for FESEM imaging.\nNote: About 3-nm thick chromium or 2-nm thick iridium coat is reported to be more suitable for other nuclei specimens.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] In zebrafish early embryonic nuclei, we tested 3-nm thick chromium coat, but the conductivity of coated specimens was relatively poor. Therefore, we chose to use a 10-nm thick gold coat, though it slightly reduced resolution.\nImage NPCs on the nuclear surface under a FESEM instrument (e.g., FEI Helios NanoLab G3 UC) after professional training or with assistance from an instrumental technician. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIsolation of pure nuclei (optional)\nTiming: 3 h",
    "This step is optionally performed for additional purification of nuclei after hypotonic treatment (step 5). The usage of a dense sucrose solution followed by high-speed centrifugation would help separate nuclei from mitochondria and residual plasma membrane in the crude pellet fraction based on their densities. We purified intact nuclei from zebrafish 32-cell and 512-cell stage embryos with a successful rate of 1.5% (number of isolated intact nuclei/total number of cells) and successfully used them for mass spectrometry analysis.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nDiscard the supernatant with liquid residual as little as possible.\nGently resuspend the pellet in hypertonic sucrose buffer:\nAdd 500 μL hypertonic sucrose buffer to the pellet.\nGently pipette the pellet using a 200-μL tip for suspension.\nTransfer the suspension to the cylinder of a Dounce homogenizer.\nNote: Using high concentration of sucrose helps prevent diffusion of proteins into the homogenizing medium.\nHomogenize the suspension in a Dounce homogenizer with the “loose” or named “A” pestle for 8–10 passes, up and down the cylinder, on ice.\nNote: Zebrafish early embryonic nuclei are slightly larger than those of somatic cells. Therefore, the “loose” but not the “tight” pestle should be used in order to maintain intactness of nuclei.\nNote: For zebrafish early embryos, up to 10 passes through the Dounce homogenizer are sufficient and keep most nuclear membrane intact. For other cell types, the number of strokes should be optimized to preserve both sufficiency and the nuclear membrane.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 1.5 mL polypropylene ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman 357448) using a 200-μL pipette.\nNote: Avoid using conventional 1.5-mL EP tubes, which are incapable of withstanding ultracentrifugation.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 80,000 × g for 80 min at 4°C.\nNote: This step aims to separate nuclei from mitochondria, membranes, and yolk remnants based on density.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant sucrose buffer as far as possible, especially the residuals on the tube wall. Take care not to disturb the nuclei pellet at the bottom.\nNote: The number of nuclei isolated from zebrafish early embryos is very limited, so the pellet is typically invisible to the naked eye. The nuclei pellet is expected to sediment toward the bottom of the EP tube along the direction of centrifugal force.\nResuspend the pellet in 205 μL PBS by gently pipetting using a 200-μL tip. Transfer the resuspension to a new 1.5-mL EP tube.\nNote: PBS without Triton X-100 was used to preserve the nuclear envelope, which contained embedded proteins of interest like nucleoporins.\nOptional: To remove the nuclear envelope, use PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100. However, the addition of Triton X-100 or other detergents would increase the tendency of nuclei aggregation, which is hard to be disassociated into individual nucleus.\nNuclei collection.\nCentrifuge 200 μL suspension at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the nuclei.\nDiscard the supernatant. Aspirate PBS absolutely, but don’t touch the potential nuclei pellet.\nSnap freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C for up to 1 month.\nNote: Leave 5 μL nuclei suspension for subsequent number counting and quality check.\nQuality check and number counting of isolated nuclei.\nAdd 5 μL PBS to the remaining 5 μL resuspension to expand the volume.\nStain the isolated nuclei with WGA AF647 (final concentration of 5 μg/mL) and DAPI (final concentration of 1 μg/mL) for 10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer about 2 μL nuclei suspension into a confocal dish and take photos under a confocal microscope for quality check (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2751-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The quality of an intact isolated nucleus is determined by WGA and DAPI staining as well as bright field observation. WGA, FG-Nups for labeling NE integrity; DAPI, DNA for labeling nucleus; bright field, reflecting well isolated nucleus devoid of cytoplasm (upper) or nucleus in the whole cell (bottom).

Magnification values are displayed in the lower-left corner of each image. Enlarged regions are denoted by dotted boxes. Scale bar, 1 μm (left and middle) and 100 nm (right).\nNote: WGA labels FG-Nups, which reflects the integrity of NE; bright field images show the successful exposure of nuclei; and DAPI labels DNA to indicate the nucleus.\nCount the number of nuclei with a hemocytometer. Estimate the total number of collected nuclei based on the whole volume.\nRecord the location of storage and the number of nuclei for each tube.\nNote: Different tubes containing the same sample could be pooled to obtain sufficient nuclei for subsequent mass spectrometry.\nPerform mass spectrometry analysis.\nNote: Obtaining nuclei from zebrafish early embryos was largely limited by cell number and isolation efficiency. We used an optimized label-free mass spectrometry method with about 12500 nuclei per sample."
