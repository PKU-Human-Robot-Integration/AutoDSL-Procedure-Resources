  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #8041401). All animals were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) approved vivarium at the University of Iowa. All mice were wild type strain C57Bl/6J.\n1. Establishment of FEMI in pregnant mice\nLPS preparation\n\t\nUse LPS derived from Escherichia coli O55:B5 (stock concentration 2 mg/mL).\nDilute LPS stock concentration 1:100 with sterile saline for a working concentration of 20 µg/mL.\nMaternal LPS injection\n\t\nInject pregnant dams at gestation day e15. This timepoint is approximately 75% through the murine pregnancy, making this model developmentally similar to the early third trimester of human pregnancies, which is when the majority of preterm births due to chorioamnionitis occur.\nWeigh pregnant mice immediately prior to injection to determine appropriate LPS dosing.\nCalculate the dose of working concentration by using the following formula: 5 µL x gram body weight (gbw), for a total dose of LPS of 100 µg/kg. For control animals, use an equivalent volume of normal saline for injection.\nVortex LPS solution three times for 15 seconds on high prior to each injection.\nDraw up LPS volume into a 1 mL syringe.\nRestrain pregnant mouse with scruffing technique. Hold in dorsal recumbency position and perform the injection.\n\t\t\nInsert a 30 gauge 8 mm needle bevel up overlying the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (to avoid bladder and abdominal vessels) at a 30‒40° angle. Insert about ¼ to ½ the length of the needle.\nPull back on the syringe plunger to ensure negative pressure prior to injecting. Proceed with injection if negative pressure is present.\nFollowing injection, monitor mice for approximately 30 min and then return to cages for the remainder of the pregnancy.",
    "2. Delivery and care of offspring, and intestinal harvesting\nDeliver pups normally via vaginal delivery at e20.\n\tNOTE: This model does have an expected dose-dependent fetal loss rate that can be seen in Figure 1 and is discussed in the results below.\nAllow pups to remain with mothers and receive ad libitum feeds.\nOn the day of harvest, typically postnatal day 14 (P14), euthanize pups via cervical dislocation in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.\nUsing scissors and forceps, make a vertical incision down the midline of the abdomen, through the skin and peritoneum, for the entire length of the abdomen. Excise the small intestine from the stomach to the cecum with scissors and remove the mesentery with forceps. \nIsolate and keep the distal 1/3 of the small intestine (section representative of human ileum), discarding the proximal small intestine, the cecum, and the colon.\nDivide the ileum portion in half using scissors.\nPlace the proximal half in an RNA stabilization solution for later RNA quantification.\nPlace the distal half in 10% neutral buffered formalin for slide preparation.\n3. Intestinal injury scoring\nSection paraffin embedded tissue into 5 µm thick slices and mount on glass slides.\n\tNOTE: We send the specimens to a histology core for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and mounting onto slides.\nDeparaffinize slides according to standard procedures.\nStain sections with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard procedures.\nScore sections on a 3-point scale for intestinal injury as previously described42,43.\n\t\nUsing light microscopy, assess generalized intestinal injury by two separate blinded investigators on a 3-point scale evaluating villus integrity and separation from the basement membrane43 (Supplementary Figure 1). Intestinal injury is best assessed at 20x magnification and numerical aperture 0.50.\nAssign a score of 0 to describe normal mucosa.",
    "Assign a score of 1 describe mild injury which encompasses the development of subepithelial Gruenhagen’s space, vacuolization or subepithelial lifting limited to the lamina propria or tips of villi.\nAssign a score of 2 to describe severe injury, indicated by epithelial lifting and vacuolization greater than half of the villi, villi distortion, or mucosal ulceration and disintegration of the lamina propria.\n4. Quantification of Paneth and goblet cells\nFollowing deparaffinization, stain slides of tissue sections from Step 2.8 with Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff stain to denote both goblet and Paneth cells as previously described44,45 according to the following steps.\n\tNOTE: While Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff stain is not specific to either Paneth or goblet cells, in our experience, blinded experienced investigators have equivalent cellular quantification using this stain compared to cellular targeted antibodies, with significantly less background staining46.\nDeparaffinize, stain, and dehydrate slides as follows.\n\t\nSubmerge slides in xylene for 10 min twice.\n\t\tCAUTION: Xylene should be used in a fume hood.\nRinse with 100% EtOH.\nSubmerge slides in 100 % EtOH for 3 min, then in 90% EtOH for 3 min, followed by 70% EtOH for 3 min, and lastly submerge slides in 50% EtOH for 3 min.\nWash under running tap water for 5 min.\n\t\tCAUTION: Point the section away from the running water to prevent loss of tissue sample.\nFilter Alcian blue stain solution with a standard coffee filter.\nStain slides in Alcian blue stain for 15 min and then wash under running tap water for 2 min.\nDilute 1 mg of periodic acid in 200 mL of double distilled water. Submerge slides in this solution for 5 min. Then wash under running tap water for 1 min.\nStain with Schiff’s reagent for 10 min. Wash under running tap water for 5 min.",
    "Stain the slides with hematoxylin for 1 min and then wash under running tap water for 2 min.\nSubmerge them in acid alcohol (1 mL of hydrochloric acid mixed in 99 mL of 70% EtOH) for 1 min.\nSubmerge in Scott’s tap water (0.1% concentration of NaHCO3 in tap water) for 1 min and then wash under running tap water for 1 min.\nDehydrate the slides.\n\t\t\nDip each slide 10 times in 70% EtOH, then dip 10 times in 90% EtOH, and 10 times in 100% EtOH.\nSubmerge slides in 100% EtOH for 10 min, followed by submerging twice in fresh xylene for 3 min each.\nPlace a drop of mounting media on the specimen and place a coverslip over it.\nGoblet cell counting\n\t\nUsing light microscopy, count goblet cells (Supplementary Figure 2). For each piece of intestinal tissue, count the number of goblet cells and 500 epithelial cells and express goblet cell ratio as a ratio per 100 epithelial cells. Goblet cells are best counted at 20x magnification and numerical aperture 0.5.\nPaneth cell counting\n\t\nUsing light microscopy, count Paneth cells (Supplementary Figure 2). For each piece of intestinal tissue, express as a ratio of Paneth cells per intestinal crypt. Count 100 intestinal crypts per each piece of intestinal tissue. Paneth cells are best counted at 20x-60x magnification and numerical aperture 0.50-1.30.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
