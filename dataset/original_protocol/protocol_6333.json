    "Synthesis of cnvK-rG puromycin-linker (Figure 2)Please refer (Nemoto et al., 2018 or Terai et al., 2019) for the detailed protocol of formation of the cnvK-rG puromycin-linker.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191218/20191218012312_6313.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagram of puromycin-linker DNA. The puromycin-linker DNA comprises four parts: a photo cross-linking site for mRNA (cnvK), a primer region for reverse transcription, a biotin moiety for immobilization onto SA beads for purification, and a restriction site for release from SA beads. In addition, the linker has puromycin moiety and FITC moiety for detection.Construction anti-GFP VHH DNA templates and their PCR amplificationPrepare the Anti-GFP VHH coding DNA construct as follows. If you want to use other VHHs, please change “Anti-GFP VHH” part. The DNA construct can be chemically synthesized as an artificial gene on a plasmid or overlap extension PCR from several fragments. Please ensure that there is no stop codon before cnvK NewYtag region.table:\n﻿0,1\n14-33,T7\n34-36,5′ cap\n37-107,Ω\n110-114,kozak\n118-498,Anti-GFP VHH\n499-522,GGGSGGGS\n523-540,His Tag\n541-549,GGS\n550-571,cnvK NewYtag",

Mix 0.5 µl of DNA sample, 1.5 µl of UPDW and 2 µl of 2x loading buffer. Use 100 bp DNA Ladder as the marker (Recipe 1).Denature the DNA by heating at 85 °C for 5 min before loading.Perform PAGE analyses for 20 min at 60 °C, 200 V using gels (1 mm thickness) containing 8 M urea (Recipe 2), with 0.5x TBE as a running buffer (Recipe 3). Purify the DNA using FavorPrep DNA purification kit.
