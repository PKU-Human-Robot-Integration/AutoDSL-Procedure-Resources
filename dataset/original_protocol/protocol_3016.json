Furthermore, critical steps are provided, which can help researchers to troubleshoot their experiments.\nCritical: Before starting, ensure you have ample plasmid for the production of the EcoHIV. All of the EcoHIV plasmids used in this paper carry ampicillin resistance. The full plasmid maps can be requested from Drs. Mary Potash, David J. Volsky, or Jennifer Kelschenbach.\nNote: There are companies that will do virus production, but because EcoHIV is replication-competent, this will limit the number of potential vendors.\nAmpicillin-containing LB agar plates.\nMake the ampicillin-containing LB agar plates as follows:\nMake 500 mL of LB media.\nAdd 7.5 g agar (15 g/L is the standard ratio).\nMix, but the agar will not dissolve.\nAutoclave on liquid small cycle (20 min exposure).\nLet the agar cool until it is warm but not hot to touch.\nAdd ampicillin (100 μg/mL, final).\nPour into plates approximately 25 mL/plate.\nLet plates sit capped to solidify. This step can be done in a sterile hood if needed.\nOnce agar is solidified, cap the plates and store at 4°C until use, preferably not exposed to light and upside down to prevent water accumulation on the agar.\nBacterial transformation.\nNote: The EcoHIV plasmids can be transformed into DH5α E. coli.\nClean the lab bench with 70% ethanol, and set the water bath at 42°C.\nThaw a 50 μL aliquot of DH5α E. coli on ice.\nAdd 1 μL of the plasmid (100 ng/μL of the plasmid should be enough) into the DH5α E. coli and keep it on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock the bacteria at 42°C for 1.5 min.",
    "Critical: Do not exceed 1.5 min as you might kill the bacteria.\nKeep the cells on ice for 2 min.\nAdd the bacteria to the agar plate and spread them.\nIncubate the plate upside down at 37°C overnight (maximum for 16 h).\nBacterial amplification and plasmid purification.\nNext day, in the morning, pick one colony and add it to 4 mL autoclaved LB media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin in a sterile culture tube.\nIncubate at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 h.\nTransfer the 4 mL autoclaved LB media containing the colony into 1 L autoclaved LB media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and shake at 250 rpm at 37°C overnight.\nOptional: Keep the closure loose on the flask to enhance aeration and bacterial growth.\nNote: Next day, the LB media should be turbid.\nHarvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.\nWe highly recommend using the Hispeed plasmid Maxi kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions to isolate EcoHIV plasmids. (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=52d67294-f2d7-4181-a532-7ea147b28b36&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=52d67294-f2d7-4181-a532-7ea147b28b36&lang=en]).\nMeasure the plasmid concentration using Nanodrop. Usually, 1 L of LB growth media yields ∼700 μg–1 mg of the EcoHIV plasmids.\nEcoHIV plasmid quality check\nTiming: 4 h (for steps 4 to 5)\nBefore proceeding with EcoHIV production, it is critical to check the plasmid integrity and quality.\nThis section describes detailed steps to confirm the quality of the produced EcoHIV plasmids from the above section.\nEcoHIV plasmids have many Hind III restriction sites that can generate a diagnostic restriction digest. Using Hind III, EcoHIV-NDK is cut into 6 fragments with the following sizes: 1086, 1172, 1786, 2686, 3235 and 5353 bp and EcoHIV-NDK-EGFP is cut into 7 fragments (1086, 1172,1308, 1786, 2686, 3235 and 5353 bp) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2765-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Diagnostic restriction digestions of EcoHIV-NDK and EcoHIV-NDK-EGFP plasmids",
    "Mw ladder (lane 1). EcoHIV-NDK (lanes 2 and 3) and EcoHIV-NDK-EGFP (lanes 4 and 5) plasmids were either cut or not with Hind III-HF. While cutting EcoHIV-NDK plasmid results in 6 fragments (lane 3), cutting of EcoHIV-NDK-EGFP results in 7 fragments (lane 5). The black arrows indicate the shortest two fragments of both plasmids (1086 and 1172 bp). The bold red arrow refers to the extra fragment (1308 bp) that makes the difference between the two plasmids as a result of EGFP fragment insertion.\nMaking 1% agarose gel.\nAdd 100 mL of 1 X TBE buffer into an Erlenmeyer flask.\nAdd 1 g agarose.\nClose the top of the Erlenmeyer flask with a paper towel.\nMicrowave for 55 s to melt the agarose.\nSwirl the Erlenmeyer flask to mix the agarose.\nMicrowave again for 15 s.\nAdd 6 μL Ethidium Bromide and mix well.\nPour the solution into the Owl™ EasyCast™ B2 Mini Gel Electrophoresis Systems, insert the appropriate gel comb, and let it set to solidify at RT.\nDiagnostic restriction digest of the EcoHIV plasmids using Hind III-HF.\nFor each plasmid label two Eppendorf tubes as (cut and no cut).\nAdd 16 μL distilled H2O to each tube.\nAdd 2 μL of smart cut 10 X buffer to each tube.\nAdd 1 μL of (160 ng/ μL) of the plasmid of interest to each tube.\nAdd 1 μL of Hind III-HF to the “cut” tube and 1 μL distilled H2O to the “uncut” tube.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1.5 h.\nAdd 2.2 μL of 10 X DNA loading dye and load 10 μL into the 1% agarose gel.\nRun the gel at 120 V for 1.5 h using 1 x TBE as the running buffer.\nImage the gel using Ethidium Bromide filter using the ChemiDoc imaging system.\nEcoHIV production",
    "Timing: 5 days (for steps 6 to 15)\nThis section outlines the necessary steps for producing EcoHIV viruses and critical steps that should be followed to have a high viral titer.\nDay 1: Plate 6×106 Lenti-X™ 293T cells in 150 mm × 20 mm tissue culture treated dish in 20 mL growing media without antibiotics.\nCritical: Cell viability must be >85% to get good viral titers.\nCritical: Cells should be 60–70% confluent before transfection.\nOptional: We recommend passaging the cells at least three times before trying to use them for viral production and avoid cells that have been passaged >15 times.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nDay 2: For each plate, prepare 12 mL of DMEM with 18 μL of 40,000 PEI MAX (linear) (stock concentration: 5 mg/mL) and 30 μg of EcoHIV plasmid.\nNote: We recommend a 1:3 ratio of PEI to plasmid for optimum EcoHIV production.\nVortex for 1 min then mix by inversion for 1 h at RT.\nRemove the media from the plates with a sterile pipet and add 12 mL of the transfection media in a dropwise manner.\nCritical: Add the transfection media dropwise against the side wall of the dish and not directly on the cells to prevent cell detachment.\nAfter 6 h, add 13 mL of growing media without antibiotics to the plate in a dropwise manner.\nNote: If you are generating EcoHIV-NDK-EGFP, the transfected cells will be slightly green, and the intensity will increase after 24 h.\nCollect the supernatant after 24 h.\nSpin at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nStore the supernatant for viral concentration at 4°C.\nNote: EcoHIV is not sensitive to cold inactivation as we have tested the possibility of cold inactivation of the viral preparation after storing at 4°C (Data not shown).",
    "Add 20 mL of growing media without antibiotics to the cells and incubate for 24 h.\nRepeat steps 11–14 twice.\nEcoHIV concentration\nTiming: variable\nNote: There are two methods to concentrate EcoHIV; ultracentrifugation and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) precipitation. Both yield similar viral infectivity; however, a significant difference between them is the purity of the viral preparations. If an ultracentrifuge is available, it should be used to generate a viral batch with high purity especially if used with a sucrose pad or sucrose gradient. PEG precipitation can be used if the appropriate ultracentrifuges are not available. We will describe both methods here and show the ultracentrifugation method results as it is very commonly used, trickiest to do, and a pure virus preparation is needed for most experiments.\nUltracentrifugation to concentrate the viral preparations.\nNote: Different viruses can tolerate centrifugation up to a certain g force without losing infectivity. For EcoHIV, we found that it can be centrifuged up to 35,300 × g for 3 h without losing infectivity (Data not shown).\nTo concentrate the EcoHIV with the ultracentrifuge:\nPlace SW28 rotor in the ultracentrifuge and cool it to 4°C before starting the run.\nAdd up to 35 mL of the media from infected cells into ultra-clear centrifuge tubes.\nOptional: To increase the purity of the viral preparations:\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.2 μm filtration unit.\nUse a sucrose pad (20% sucrose) or a sucrose gradient (20–70% sucrose) and add the filtered supernatant as described in step b.\nCritical: It is critical to add the supernatant slowly on the top of sucrose to prevent mixing the layers together.\nMake sure the tubes are properly balanced.\nSpin at 35,300 × g using the acceleration of 7 and brake of 7 (slow acceleration and slow brake) for 3 h.",
    "After centrifugation, bring the viral preps to a tissue culture hood and discard the media via aspiration or by carefully and quickly dumping the media from the tube into the appropriate waste container containing bleach.\nAdd 350 μL of cold PBS to each tube and swirl gently to re-suspend the virus pellet (100-fold concentration; the viral pellet might not be visible).\nNote: As mentioned above, EcoHIV is not sensitive to cold inactivation as we have tested the possibility of cold inactivation of the viral preparation after storing at 4°C (Data not shown).\nPlace the tubes on a rocker for 10 min at 4°C.\nPool the collected virus suspensions together and put them on the rocker again at 4°C for 5 min to mix well.\nAliquot the virus preparations (100 μL) into cryogenic vials.\nNote: As recommended by the gene vector and virus core of Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute at Stanford University, do not use polystyrene tubes to store the virus (use the cryogenic vials). Also, do not introduce air bubbles while you are suspending the viral pellet to keep the viral particles intact.\nSnap-freeze the tubes in a methanol/dry ice bath or with liquid nitrogen.\nStore at −80°C.\nNext day, thaw an aliquot to calculate the virus titer.\nCritical: It is critical to calculate the virus titer using an aliquot that has been subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle so the virus titer can be assumed to be the same for the other frozen aliquots once they are thawed and ready to use.\nCritical: EcoHIV can tolerate one freeze/thaw cycle. Do not exceed more than one freeze/thaw cycle.\nPEG-8000 precipitation to concentrate the viral preparations.",
    "Note: This method is affordable, easy to perform in most research institutions and yields more viable viral particles. Its main limitation is the lack of specificity to precipitate only viral particles. This method will precipitate much of the soluble macromolecular material in the media, which can complicate experiments. To use this method, follow these steps:\nPrepare 40% PEG-8000 solution (1.2 M NaCl in PBS pH 7.4), then filter sterilize in a biological safety cabinet.\nMix the collected supernatant (after the 3,000 × g spin) with the PEG-8000 solution as 4:1 (20 mL of the supernatant with 5 mL of the PEG solution) and incubate at 4°C overnight.\nNext day centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 30 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nSpin the pellet tube again at 1,500 × g for 1 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 μL sterile PBS if the starting volume was 20 mL media (100-fold concentration).\nNote: As mentioned above, do not use polystyrene tubes to store the virus (use the cryogenic vials). Also, do not introduce air bubbles while you are suspending the viral pellet to keep the viral particles intact.\nViral preparations quality controls\nTiming: 2–3 days (for steps 18 to 26)\nIt is essential to calculate the viral titer and check the quality of the prepared viral batches as they may vary between different viruses and batches. It is worth noting that disrupted viruses are still detectable by the p24 ELISA. Therefore, it is crucial to check the infectivity and quality of the newly made virus preparations.\nEvaluation of viral infectivity using HEK293-mCAT1 cells.\nNote: For the following assays using the HEK293-mCAT1 cells, HEK293 that do not express mCAT1 cells can be used as a negative control.",

Currently, there are two fluorescent versions of the EcoHIV expressing EGFP (EcoHIV-EGFP NL4/3 and EcoHIV-EGFP NDK).7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] To utilize this method, one of these EcoHIV versions is recommended. Below is a summary of the infectivity assay.\nSplit HEK293-mCAT1 cells into a 24-well plate (plate A) with 1 × 105 cells/well (1 mL final volume) for next-day infection.\nThe next day, in a fresh 24-well plate (plate B), add 450 μL/well growing media.\nAdd 50 μL virus to the first well of plate B, mix thoroughly, and then serially transfer 50 μL into the remaining wells (10-fold dilutions).\nAspirate and discard the media from plate A.\nTransfer 400 μL from the first well of plate B into the first well of plate A and then continue to transfer the media from the other wells of plate B to plate A in this fashion.\nNote: Make sure to include a non-infected cell control to determine the background.\nIncubate the cells for 24–48 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nAnalyze the infectivity of the viral preparation.\nAfter 24–48 h, four options can be utilized to evaluate the infectivity of the viral preparations depending on the availability of resources:\nAnalysis by Flow Cytometry.\nAnalysis by Fluorescence Plate Reader.\nAnalysis by Fluorescence Microscopy.\nAnalysis by RT-qPCR.\nAnalysis by Flow Cytometry.\nNote: This method is the most accurate, quantitative, and sensitive way to calculate the viral titer and to check the quality of the viral prep while using EGFP-containing constructs of the EcoHIV. The availability of flow cytometry is the major limitation of this method. To use this method:",

    "HEK293-mCAT1 cells were infected for 24 h with 1:100 diluted EcoHIV-NDK-EGFP to calculate the virus titer after concentration and one freeze/thaw cycle. The cells were harvested as described under the “Analysis by Flow Cytometry” section and stained with Zombie Red™ Fixable Viability Kit to exclude dead cells. The cells were analyzed using BD Symphony A3, with 10,000 events acquired. This experiment demonstrates a successful concentration process of the EcoHIV-EGFP and the production of a highly infectious virus. The virus titer calculated by this method is ∼ 5.2 × 106 TU/mL.\nCalculate the viral titer (Transducing Units/mL) using the following formula:\nTU = (% of transduced cells X dilution factor X 105)/well volume (mL).\nAnalysis by Fluorescence Plate Reader.\nThis method is sensitive and gives quantitative data regarding viral infectivity as well, but the viral titer cannot be calculated, because single infection events cannot be scored. In addition, the percentage of cells infected with the virus cannot be calculated. To use this method, follow the same steps as mentioned in the flow cytometry section (above) except there is no need to add the viability dye, but the cells should be resuspended in phenol red-free media or PBS as phenol red gives a false positive signal in the fluorescence plate reader (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2765-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

This method can be used to calculate viral titer based on how many cells express EGFP. To utilize this method:\nUse the Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 or EVOS cell imaging system to titer the virus, choose the first well that has a countable number of cells (between 50–100 cells), then count the number of EGFP-positive cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2765-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "HIV-1 is an enveloped virus, and the presence of the envelope is essential for effective viral infection. EcoHIV differs from HIV-1 by having a Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) envelope, which enables it to infect only murine cells.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Therefore, the presence of an intact viral envelope is essential for infection.\nA major limitation of the p24 ELISA is the presence of free p24 in the sample, which can confound attempts to measure intact viruses. However, the number of intact viral particles can be determined by comparing the amount of p24 following detergent lysis of the viral preparations and subtracting the amount of free p24 in the unlysed sample.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2765-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. p24 ELISA of the lysed and un-lysed concentrated EcoHIV-NDK\nThe supernatant of transfected Lenti-X™ 293T cells was concentrated at 35,300 × g for 3 h at 4°C. The concentrated virus was then either diluted first in 1% Triton™ X-100 and vortexed to lyse the viral particles or diluted with PBS (for the un-lysed). The difference between the lysed and un-lysed concentrations resembles the concentration of p24 from the intact viral particles (n = 6). The data is represented as mean ± SEM with statistical significance indicated as ∗∗p < 0.005.\nNote: We recommend doing a serial dilution between 104 and 106 of the concentrated viral preparations before doing the p24 ELISA assay to be within the linear range of the standard curve.\nNote: To calculate the concentration of free p24, dilute the viral preparations in PBS only and avoid using any detergent. To calculate the total concentration of p24 (free and inside the viral particle), lyse the viral preparations with the assay diluent buffer included in the p24 ELISA kit or with 1% Triton™X-100 and vortex the sample (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).",

    "Move the spleen into a small dish that has 300 μL cold PBS and use the plunger of sterile 1 mL syringes to release the splenocytes gently.\nPlace a mini-strainer (100 μm) on a 15 mL tube and prime it with 300 μL RNAase-free PBS.\nTransfer the splenocytes from step b to the strainer and add 700 μL PBS.\nSpin at 500 × g at RT for 7 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 5 mL of cold ACK buffer to lyse the RBCs. Keep on ice for 2 min, then spin again as in step e.\nNote: There should be a visible brown pellet after the spin.\nAdd 600 μL of the lysis buffer provided in the PureLink™ RNA Mini kit to lyse the cell pellet.\nFollow the steps as described in the cellular and viral RNA isolation section (steps b-t).\nPerform RT-qPCR on the purified RNA (500 ng of RNA) and measure either one of the following spliced genes: spliced vif, spliced tat or spliced nef as they are metrics of de novo virus production (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7])."
