    "1. Generation of a mother plant for clonal propagation\nSelect a healthy, female mother plant that exhibits desirable morphological and chemical characteristics specific to its intended use.\nAllow the mother plant to reach the appropriate size (roughly 25 mature shoots) for clonal propagation (i.e., cuttings).\nAllow the mother plants to remain in the vegetative growth stage (light: dark = 18 h:6 h) to promote shoot growth for future propagation.\n2. Construction and preparation of aeroponic system\nBegin by positioning the lid on top of the container (38.1 cm x 25.4 cm x 30.48 cm). Drill the desired number of holes into the lid while providing adequate space (preferably 3 cm) between each.\nPosition the water pump (Table of Materials) in the center of the container.\nPour 7-8 L of distilled water into the container so that the pump nozzle remains roughly 2.5 cm above the waterline.\n\tNOTE: This ensures the submersible water pump (Table of Materials) is able to push water with enough force to spread across the container lid. Distilled water is recommended; however, regular tap water may also be used.\nSituate the appropriate amount of Rockwool cubes (3.81 cm) (Table of Materials) or media cubes of choice into each slot. Turn on the pump and allow it to run for 24 h.\n\t​NOTE: Rockwool cubes are preferred due to their \"anchoring\" ability on the newly rooted cuttings that help keep plants upright following transplant.\n3. Selecting and excising appropriate shoots\nCollect shoots near the apical meristem using a sterilized scalpel or scissor. Cuttings are ~10 cm in length, ideally with several nodes.",
    "NOTE: Cut the stem at a 45° angle. Cutting at a 45° angle increases the surface area of the basal portion of the cutting, allowing more space for root development. It's optional to make a small slit (1-2 cm) in the middle of the 45° cut to further increase surface area.\nRemove all foliage except foliage present on the top three nodes.\nDip the newly excised cutting into the rooting solution containing indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (Table of Materials) ~2-5 cm up from the base of the stem for ~5 s.\nInsert the cutting into the center of a Rockwool cube positioned in the aeroponic system.\n\tNOTE: The cutting insertion depth is to remain ~1-2 cm from the bottom of the Rockwool cube.\nSpray the unrooted cuttings with the nutrient mist solution (Table of Materials) every 3 days.\nGrow the cuttings with 18-24 h of light per day with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 100 µmol/m2/s at 24-29 °C and 40-60% relative humidity.\n4. Aeroponic system maintenance and propagule health\nReplenish the system with water at a pH between 5.0- 6.0 every 2-5 days.\nLightly mist the cuttings (one mist per cutting) with the nutrient mist solution (Table of Materials) every 3 days.\nAdd 5 mL of each nutrient solution (Table of Materials) to the reservoir every 3-5 days.\n\tNOTE: The nutrient addition causes water to be brown and murky.\nAdd 15 mL of the algae and bacteria cleaning solution containing hypochlorous acid (0.028%) per 10 L of water every 5 days (Table of Materials).\n5. Transplanting propagules\nSelect the cuttings with long, white, fibrous roots.",
    "NOTE: Avoid cuttings with brown, slimy, and short root systems as this is an indicator for the presence of root rot and will usually take longer to acclimate to the new growing medium and can bring unwanted diseases.\nCarefully dislodge the Rockwool cube from the system and untangle the roots.\nTransplant the Cannabis propagules to 4 L nursery pot filled with a nutritious soil mix (Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: Watering immediately is recommended to prevent the roots from drying out.\n6. Cleaning and storage of aeroponic system\nWhen the system is no longer in use, wash with water and clean with 70% ethanol or another disinfectant.\nRemove the filter from the water pump and rinse with water to remove debris.\nDry the system by wiping it down with paper towels or a washcloth.\nPlace the pump inside the tub with the lid on and store it until it is needed.\nSubscription Required.
