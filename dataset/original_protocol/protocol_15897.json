    "This protocol describes the method used to isolate both NHEKs and melanocytes from the same tissue sample. Primary cells are isolated from neonatal foreskin, though primary cells can also be isolated from adult skin (e.g., samples can be derived from abdominoplasty), if desired. Tissue samples can be stored in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) for up to 72 hr.\nNOTE: Federal regulations require that research projects involving human subjects be reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB must approve or determine the project to be exempt prior to the start of any research activities.\nNOTE: This protocol involves working with human tissue. Follow all institutional biosafety procedures. All steps should be performed inside a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) cabinet.\nNOTE: Both NHEKs and melanocytes can be isolated from the same tissue sample, allowing for the use of matched cells when making the organotypic culture. This protocol describes isolating melanocytes and NHEKs from the same sample. This is achieved by dividing the solution containing the isolated single cells, followed by isolation of melanocytes from one portion and the keratinocytes from the other portion. This strategy results in the best purity of each cell type when performing the isolation. However, this does reduce the overall yield of cells. If a high yield of cells is required, all cells can be isolated from the same sample using differential trypsinization. The Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-prot-0002] describes this method.\nMaterials",
    "Human neonatal foreskins (can be acquired under IRB approval through one's institution; neonatal foreskins used in this work were provided by the Northwestern University Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based Center): Collect and place in transport medium, HBSS without calcium or magnesium, and store at 4°C until ready to perform the isolation; foreskins can be stored for up to 72 hr before beginning the isolation protocol with minimal loss of viability\nPBS containing no Ca2+ or Mg2+\nM154 supplemented medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-rec-0008])\nFBS (MilliporeSigma, F0926-500ML)\nBasic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-rec-0002])\nDispase solution, 1.4 U/ml: Reconstitute dispase powder (Roche, 04942078001) at 105 U/ml following the manufacturer's instructions; for dispase solution, dilute to 1.4 U/ml in PBS without calcium and magnesium and sterile filter; store at 4°C for up to 3 days\n0.25% trypsin (Gibco, 25200072)\nSterile Forceps\nSterile Scissors\n100-mm TC-treated Culture Dish (Corning, 430167)\n60-mm TC-treated Culture Dish (Corning, 430166)\n40-μm nylon cell strainers (Corning, 352340)\n70-μm nylon cell strainers (Corning, 431751)\nDay 1: Prepare foreskin for isolation\nThis step is best performed at the end of the day; extended incubation in dispase solution can lead to a small reduction in the number of viable NHEKs and melanocytes isolated from the foreskin.\n1. Add 3 ml dispase solution to a 60-mm cell culture dish. Set aside while preparing the foreskin.\n2. Remove transport solution from the tube containing the foreskin and wash two times in PBS containing no Ca2+ or Mg2+.\nAll solutions that touch the foreskin should be placed in a beaker containing bleach.\n3. Move foreskin to a clean 100-mm dish and using sterile forceps and scissors, cut foreskin so that it will lay flat in the dish, remove excess fat and vessels, and cut into smaller (roughly 8 mm × 8 mm) pieces.",
    "4. Carefully place pieces, dermis side down, into the 60-mm dish containing dispase solution. Place this dish inside a 100-mm culture dish and place in 4°C refrigerator overnight.\nDay 2: Prepare single cells for NHEK and melanocyte isolation\nThis step is best performed early in the day following the day 1 protocol, as leaving the foreskin in dispase for too long can lead to a small decrease in cell viability.\n5. Add 3 ml of 0.25% trypsin solution to a 100-mm dish, with the dish propped up on a lid so the solution collects on one side. Set aside while working with the foreskin in dispase solution.\n6. Collect the 100-mm dish containing the foreskin in dispase solution from 4°C refrigerator and bring to the laminar flow hood.\n7. Using two pairs of sterile forceps, separate epidermis from the dermis from each piece of the foreskin and float epidermis on trypsin solution.\nIncubation overnight in dispase allows for the epidermis and dermis to be separated but the NHEKs together with the melanocytes will remain in an intact sheet of cells in the epidermis. Incubating in trypsin allows disassociation of the sheet into single cells, though leaving the cells in trypsin for too long can reduce yield of viable cells.\n8. Incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\n9. Inactivate trypsin by adding 0.5 ml FBS to the dish and release single cells from the epidermis by scraping the epidermal sheets along the bottom of the dish using sterile forceps.\nThe sheets will not dissociate during this process, as the upper layers of the epidermis will remain intact; however, cells will be released from the lower layers of the epidermis.",
    "Scrape each chunk of tissue for ∼1 min to release all the cells. At this point the single cells present in the solution will include both NHEKs and melanocytes. When scraping cells, it is easiest to use a set of curved forceps, with the curved end of the forceps to hold the tissue down while scraping (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0002]).\nTrypan blue can be used to check cell viability at this step. Typically, viability should be >90%.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fc83dd53-cfb5-4719-8566-ace1dace4890/cpz1536-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nNeonatal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) and melanocyte isolation protocol. When scraping the tissue along the bottom of the dish to dislodge cells from the epidermal sheet it is easiest to use curved forceps to hold the tissue flat on the bottom of the dish. (A) Note that the dish is held at an angle to allow the solution to pool at the bottom of the dish, allowing the epidermal sheets to be scraped on an area of the plate not covered in solution. (B) Zoom in of the tissue being held to the bottom of the plate using curved forceps.\n10. To isolate both NHEKs and melanocytes from the same tissue sample, divide sample into two portions for further isolation.\nTypically, melanocytes will expand to a greater extent after isolation than keratinocytes, thus we isolate NHEKs from three-quarters of the solution and melanocytes from the remaining one-quarter. The method for isolating NHEKs and melanocytes are described separately below.\n11. For the isolation of NHEKs, pass the single cell suspension through the 40-μm nylon cell strainer into a 50-ml conical tube. Rinse plate with 5 ml PBS and pass this rinse solution through the 40-μm strainer into the 50-ml conical tube.\n12. For isolation of melanocytes, pass the single cell suspension through the 70-μm nylon cell strainer into a separate 50-ml conical tube.",
    "13. Centrifuge tubes containing the single cell suspensions at 300 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\n14. Resuspend NHEKs in 7 ml M154 medium and plate in a 100-mm dish.\n15. Resuspend melanocytes in 3 ml bFGF medium and plate in a 60-mm dish.",
    "This protocol describes methods to isolate melanocytes and NHEKs from the same tissue sample using differential trypsinization. This allows for higher yields of each cell type from a given tissue sample, noting that cells cannot be perfectly separated by differential trypsinization and there will be some contamination of both cell types in each culture.\nMaterials\nSingle cell suspension (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-prot-0001])\nM154 supplemented medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-rec-0008])\nbFGF medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-rec-0002])\n0.25% trypsin (Gibco, 25200072)\n0.05% trypsin/1 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25300054)\nDMEM with 10% FBS\nPBS\nSterile Forceps\nSterile Scissors\n100-mm TC-treated Culture Dish (Corning, 430167)\n60-mm TC-treated Culture Dish (Corning, 430166)\n70-μM nylon cell strainers (Corning, 431751)\nDay 2: Isolate primary cells\nThe day 1 isolation protocol is the same as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-prot-0001], steps 1 to 4 and this protocol will start just after Day 2, step 5 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-prot-0001].\n1.

Centrifuge tubes containing single cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\n4. Resuspend cells in 7 ml M154 medium and plate in a 100-mm dish.\n5. Change medium every day until the cells are roughly 60%-70% confluent.\nAt this point there will be both melanocytes and NHEKs present in the culture.\nDifferential trypsinization to separate melanocytes and NHEKs",
    "This step takes advantage of the fact that melanocytes will release from the culture dish much more quickly than NHEKs in the presence of trypsin. The exact timing will vary between batches of trypsin, so it is necessary to check the culture under a microscope and inhibit the trypsin once the melanocytes have lifted from the dish while the NHEKS are still attached.\n6. Remove medium from cell culture dish and wash with PBS.\n7. Add 3 ml 0.05% trypsin/1 mM EDTA to the culture well and incubate 2 min at 37°C. After 2 min, check cells under a microscope.\nAt this point the melanocytes should begin to retract their dendrites and lift off the bottom of the cell culture dish while the NHEKs will remain attached.\n8. Inactivate trypsin by adding 3 ml DMEM with 10% FBS and collect this solution in a 50-ml conical tube.\nThis solution contains a majority of melanocytes.\n9. Wash plate with PBS and add this solution to the 50-ml conical tube containing melanocytes.\n10. Add 3 ml 0.05% trypsin/1 mM EDTA to the culture well and incubate for 3-5 min at 37°C. Check cells under a microscope to determine if the cells have lifted off the bottom of the culture dish.\n11. Inactivate trypsin by adding 3 ml DMEM with 10% FBS and collect this solution in a 50-ml conical tube.\nThis solution contains a majority of NHEKs.\n12. Centrifuge tubes containing single cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\n13. Resuspend NHEKs in 7 ml M154 medium and plate in a 100-mm dish.\n14. Resuspend melanocytes in 7 ml bFGF medium and plate in a 100-mm dish.",
    "This protocol describes the generation of organotypic cultures. To generate a final organotypic culture that has melanocytes and keratinocytes in a similar ratio to normal skin, we plate at a ratio of 1:5 melanocytes/keratinocytes. This ratio is much higher than in normal skin, where the ratio is 1:32 melanocytes/keratinocytes. Plating at the 1:5 ratio is necessary as keratinocytes proliferate at a higher rate than melanocytes in the organotypic cultures.\nNOTE: The J2 subclone of 3T3 cells is incorporated into the collagen plug to support the growth of the organotypic skin culture. J2 3T3 cells are available through ATCC (CCL-92), which also provides instructions for propagation and maintenance.\nNOTE: Collagen plugs must be prepared 2 to 3 days prior to seeding of the NHEKs and melanocytes onto the surface. The number of collagen plugs needed will determine the number of J2 cells and volumes of all solutions that are needed. Final concentrations of J2 cells should be 2.66 × 105 cells/ml, and the final collagen concentration should be 4 mg/ml. The following protocol will describe the final concentrations of each component and will give volumes/cell numbers required to make ten collagen plugs as an example.",
    "NOTE: This protocol lifts the organotypic skin cultures to an air liquid interface by moving the cultures to a metal grid that lifts the cultures above the medium below. Other methods for achieving this include growing the cultures in transwell inserts that can be “lifted” to the air liquid interface by removing the medium in the top of the transwell and lowering the medium level in the bottom well. Using transwell inserts is required for some experiments, such as measuring transepithelial electrical resistance. Using transwells to create organotypic skin cultures requires a larger number of cells for each culture, which can be limiting in some instances. For methods on creating organotypic skin cultures using transwells see Arnette et al.

    "Creating grids for lifting cultures to an air liquid interface. (A) Grab close to the edge with a pair of forceps and (B) bend the edge down to create a leg to hold the grid above the bottom of the dish. (C) Repeat this process two more times around the circumference of the grid. (D) The final grid should stand above the surface it is resting on and should be level with the surface below.\nPrepare collagen plugs\nKeep all solutions on ice while creating the collagen plug to keep the collagen from forming a gel before it is placed into the culture wells.\n1. Incubate J2 3T3 cells in 3 ml 0.05% trypsin/1mM EDTA to dissociate the cells. After cells have dissociated and released from the bottom of the culture dish, inactivate trypsin by adding serum containing medium.\n2. Count the number of J2 3T3 cells and calculate the number needed to generate collagen plugs.\nFor the grid system, plugs are made in volumes of 1.5 ml and J2 cells should be at a final concentration of 2.66 × 105 cells/ml (for example, if ten collagen plugs are needed, then pellet 4 × 106 cells).\nPellet the number of J2 cells need by spinning at 300 × g for 5 min.\n3. Resuspend J2 cells in 10× reconstitution buffer (for ten collagen plugs this would mean resuspending in 1.5 ml of reconstitution buffer, leading to a final concentration of 1× in the collagen plug). Also add 10× DMEM to the cell suspension (add 1.5 ml if making ten collagen plugs). Add molecular grade water and collagen to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml of collagen in the final solution. Mix solution by carefully inverting, trying to minimize the amount of air bubbles that are added into the mixture.",
    "The concentration of purchased collagen changes between batches so the exact volumes of water and collagen that need to be added will have to be calculated for each experiment.\n4. Adjust pH to ∼7.4 with 0.5 N NaOH and mix by inverting, again trying to minimize the addition of air bubbles to the mixture.\nThis adjustment is based on the color of the phenol red indicator in the medium. Add NaOH until the medium corresponds to a pH of ∼7.4 using the color of the phenol red as a rough measure of pH (an example of the proper color would be the color of phenol red containing DMEM in an unopened bottle). Typically, this will involve adding μl volumes to adjust; we recommend starting with 50 μl volumes. Do not allow the pH of the collagen solution to increase above ∼7.4 as a proper gel will not form if this occurs.\n5. Pipet 1.5 ml collagen/cell mixture into each well of a 12-well plate and allow collagen to polymerize for 30 min at 37°C in a cell culture incubator.\nIf the collagen does not polymerize to form a collagen plug, potentially the pH of the mixture was not correct.\n6. After 30 min, add 2 ml supplemented DMEM to each well and incubate 48 hr at 37°C in cell culture incubator.\nSeeding melanocytes and NHEKs onto collagen plugs\nFor these cultures, we plate NHEKs and melanocytes in a 5:1 ratio. Melanocytes are grown in bFGF medium originally developed by Ruth Halaban, which we have found supports pigment production in melanocytes (Halaban, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-bib-0010]; Zhang et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-bib-0019]) and are seeded onto the collagen plugs in this medium for 24 hr. Once the NHEKs are seeded on the plugs, the medium is changed to E-medium supplemented with EGF.",
    "7. Trypsinize melanocytes and count the number of cells using a hemocytometer. Pellet the required number of melanocytes by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min; 1.2 × 105 melanocytes are plated on each collagen plug (pellet 1.2 × 106 cells if seeding onto ten collagen plugs).\n8. Resuspend melanocytes in bFGF medium at a concentration of 6 × 104 cell/ml. Carefully remove medium from the collagen plugs and add 2 ml melanocyte cell suspension to each plug. Evenly distribute melanocytes by moving the plate in a figure eight motion and incubate the organotypic cultures 24 hr at 37°C in a cell culture incubator.\nThis step allows the melanocytes to adhere to the collagen plug prior to adding NHEKs. Take care not to swirl the plate in a circle, as this will cause the melanocytes to cluster in the center of the well.\n9. The following day, trypsinize NHEKs and count cells. Each plug will get 6 × 105 NHEKs (pellet 6 × 106 NHEKs if seeding ten collagen plugs). Pellet the required number of cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspend cells in E-medium supplemented with EGF (5 ng/ml) to a final concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml.\n10. Carefully remove bFGF medium from the collagen plugs and replace it with 2 ml NHEK suspension. Evenly distribute NHEKs by moving the plate in a figure eight motion and incubate plug at 37°C in a cell culture incubator for 24 hr.\n11. Change E-medium by carefully aspirating the medium in the well without disturbing the collagen plug or the cells on top. Add another 2 ml E-medium supplemented with EGF (5 ng/ml). Incubate at 37°C in a cell culture incubator for 24 hr.",
    "Incubating the cells for 48 hr after seeding ensures that the NHEKs will be 100% confluent before lifting to an air liquid interface, which is required for proper stratification and differentiation.\nLifting organotypic cultures to air liquid interface\nCultures will be lifted to an air liquid interface by removing the collagen plugs and placing them on a metal grid that will raise them slightly above the bottom of the dish, allowing the plug to sit on the surface of the medium in the dish (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0004]). To prepare for lifting the cultures to the air liquid interface, the metal grids must be cleaned and autoclaved. To lift the collagen plugs from the 12-well plate to place on the grids, use a cleaned and autoclaved laboratory spatula.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5c94df2e-a857-49e9-a89b-d696c05794f0/cpz1536-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nLifting organotypic cultures to an air liquid interface. (A and B) Carefully break the connection between the collagen plug and the side of the well by pressing a sterile lab spatula up and down around the edge. Do not run the spatula around the edge once pressed down. This can cause the cells on the plug to pull from the plug itself. (C and D) Using the sterile lab spatula, scoop underneath the collagen plug and place the collagen plug onto the metal grid with E-medium underneath the collagen plug.\n12. Begin the process by placing one of the autoclaved grids in a 60-mm culture dish (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0003] for the preparation of the metal grids).",
    "13. Remove medium from the organotypic culture in the 12-well plates and break the attachment between the collagen plug and the wall of the 12-well plate using a laboratory spatula. To achieve this, press spatula between the edge of the collagen plug and the side of the culture well until the spatula hits the bottom of the well. Pull the spatula back out vertically and repeat this around the entire circumference of the plug.\nDo not run the spatula around the periphery of the plug, as this can cause the cells on the collagen plug to separate from it.\nCarefully, using the spatula, lift the collagen plug from the culture well and place it on the metal grid in a 60-mm culture dish (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0004]).

Carefully add E-medium to the culture dish until the bottom of the metal grid is in contact with the medium. Make sure that there are no air bubbles between the metal grid, collagen plug, and medium, and incubate plug at 37°C in a cell culture incubator.\nIf there are air bubbles underneath the collagen plug, the cultures above that point will not be fed by the medium and will not properly form. It is also important at this point to ensure that the top of the organotypic cultures stay free of medium, otherwise the organotypic cultures will not form.\nThis video cannot be streamed at this time, please download the video instead.[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/75f560b1-04af-4260-afaf-b9673a65d2ed/cpz1536-vid-0001.mov]\nMovie\nDemonstration of the lifting technique used for removing the collagen plug from the culture well and placing it on the metal grid.",
    "15. To maintain the organotypic cultures, change medium every other day with fresh E-medium. To change the medium, carefully remove the exhausted medium and add fresh medium until it comes into contact with the bottom of the metal grid. Follow the same guidelines as above.\nThe cultures can be maintained for 12 days after lifting to an air liquid interface following this protocol. The organotypic cultures will begin to stratify and differentiate quickly after lifting to an air liquid interface and by day 3 multiple layers of cells will be present, granular markers such as keratohyalin granules will be visible by day 4-5, and by day 6 the cornified layer will be present.",
    "NHEKs and melanocytes must be expanded in cell culture prior to genetic manipulation or creating organotypic skin cultures.

Carefully remove the medium from the cells and replace with fresh M154 with 0.07 mM Ca2+.\nFor the first 7 days after NHEK isolation, we recommend changing medium daily with M154 medium with 0.07 mM Ca2+ to remove floating cells. After 7 days, the medium can be changed every other day.\nDo not allow NHEKs to become 100% confluent when maintaining in vitro; passage cells at ∼80% confluence.\nNHEKs can be sustained in cell culture for ∼30 days, or six to eight passages. In our experience, the days since isolation offer a more consistent view of the lifespan of NHEKs than passage number.\n1. Remove medium from the culture dish and wash with PBS.\n2. Add 3 ml 0.05% trypsin/1 mM EDTA and incubate at 37°C for 5-8 min.\nThe exact time will vary between NHEK isolations; it is best to check the cells every couple of minutes to determine when cells have been released from the cell culture dish. Tapping the side of the dish can help detach some cells if there are a small number still attached.",
    "3. Neutralize trypsin by addition of 7 ml DMEM with 10% FBS and pellet cells by spinning at 300 × g for 5 min.\n4. Resuspend cells in M154 medium and re-plate cells in a cell culture dish.\nPassage protocol for melanocytes\nCulture of melanocytes: The first day after isolating melanocytes, the cells will have attached to the cell culture dish and will have flattened out and projected dendrites into the surrounding area. There will also be contaminating NHEKs and fibroblasts attached to the dish as well. Most of these contaminating cells will be removed during the first passage and do not need to be addressed immediately. Change the bFGF medium with fresh medium every other day as the cells divide. The cells can be grown on a coverslip and stained to check for cell purity. Labels for specific cell types include: Melan-a for melanocytes, keratin 14 or keratin 5 for keratinocytes, and alpha smooth muscle actin to label fibroblasts.\nThis protocol uses bFGF medium that in our hands is effective at supporting pigment production by melanocytes. However, melanocyte behavior is heavily influenced by medium composition and it will benefit the investigator to identify a medium that works best for the specific use.\nDo not allow melanocyte cultures to reach 100% confluence; passage the cells before reaching 80% confluence.\n5. Remove medium from the culture dish and wash with PBS.\n6. Add 3 ml 0.05% trypsin/1 mM EDTA and incubate at 37°C for 3-5 min.\nThe exact time will vary between melanocyte isolations and it is best to check the cells every couple of minutes to determine when the cells have released from the cell culture dish.",
    "When passaging melanocytes for the first time, pay close attention to when they release from the bottom of the dish, as they will release much more quickly than other cells. Neutralizing the trypsin and collecting the cells as soon as the melanocytes release will aid in removing many of the contaminating cells.\n7.

    "It is also possible to genetically manipulate NHEKs prior to incorporating into organotypic cultures. There are many ways to successfully genetically manipulate NHEKs for use in organotypic cultures that each have their advantages and disadvantages. Electroporating small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into the NHEKs can be used to knockdown genes of interest before creating organotypic cultures. siRNA is much easier to create compared to other methods and is often commercially available to knockdown a gene of interest. However the duration of knockdown can be short, limiting the timepoints that can be used. NHEKs can also be transduced using lentiviruses and retroviruses. In our experience using a retroviral system provides more effective transduction with less toxicity when compared to lentivirus but both can be used effectively. Viral transduction can be used to either knockdown or overexpress a gene of interest. Viral transductions also provide more stable genetic modification of the NHEKs than other methods, allowing for sustained knockdown or overexpression. Viral systems do take more time to develop and test, which can be a disadvantage of this system. The following protocol describes the method to transduce NHEKs using a retrovirus containing supernatant.

    "Whole mount staining of organotypic cultures allows for the analysis of three-dimensional structures present in the cultures that are difficult to visualize using tissue sections. This includes melanocyte dendrite morphology, which is difficult to observe in tissue sections but is easily observed and quantified in whole mount staining. It is recommended that antibodies, or other labels such the F-actin label phalloidin or DAPI, are tested to determine if they work in a pilot experiment before beginning a large experiment, as not all antibodies or labels work well in whole mount staining. We have successfully used ProLong Gold as a mounting medium for prolonging fluorescence staining in whole mount samples. If another mounting medium is used, we recommend testing first in a pilot experiment.\nTo image stained whole mount samples, it is best to use a fluorescent microscope that can image through thicker tissues. These would include confocal microscopes, multi-photon microscopes, or light sheet microscopes as examples. Grid-based optical sectioning techniques, such as those used by the Zeiss Apotome, do not work well for imaging whole mounts as the tissue is too thick. See Figure 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0005] for example images of whole mount stained samples taken on a confocal microscope. Another option is to whole mount unstained organotypic skin cultures and image with a brightfield microscope. This allows visualization of the pigmented melanocytes and any pigment released into the culture. To be able to visualize the pigment without prior staining, melanocytes isolated from type 5 or 6 skin from the Fitzpatrick scale are required, as melanocytes isolated from type 1-4 skin do not produce easily visible pigment.

    "To facilitate transfer of pigment between melanocytes and surrounding keratinocytes, melanocytes extend dendrites into the surrounding tissue. This allows a relatively smaller number of melanocytes to transfer pigment to a large number of surrounding keratinocytes. During the normal tanning response, melanocytes will increase the length and branching of dendrites, which is thought to further facilitate pigment transfer. The opposite, retraction of melanocyte dendrites, is observed during melanomagenesis. An advantage of the organotypic culture models, combined with whole mount staining and imaging, allows for quantification of 3D melanocyte dendricity, including total dendrite length and number of branchpoints. To measure changes in melanocyte dendrites, we use a tool originally developed for the analysis of neuron dendrites, SNT, available in the free image analysis software FIJI (Arshadi, Günther, Eddison, Harrington, & Ferreira, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-bib-0003]). Below we describe a method using SNT to model and measure changes in melanocyte morphology in 3D confocal images. General instructions about all functions of SNT and FIJI are also available through the FIJI website (https://imagej.net[href=https://imagej.net]). To see an example of images used for mapping and data generated from this method see Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0006].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4602e9e7-d741-4114-82ba-48d0dd8de6d9/cpz1536-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",
    "Measuring changes in melanocyte dendricity in organotypic skin cultures. Activation of the tanning response in melanocytes results in both an increase in pigment production, as well as an increase in melanocyte dendricity to promote transfer of pigment to the surrounding keratinocytes. Activation of the tanning response can be mediated by loss of keratinocyte desmoglein 1 (Arnette et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-bib-0002]). To measure melanocyte morphology the melanocytes were transduced with a construct expressing tdTomato allowing visualization of the cells in the organotypic culture. To whole mount stain the organotypic cultures the epidermal equivalent was removed from the collagen plug and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI before mounting to a slide. The entire thickness of the organotypic culture was then imaged using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope equipped with GaAsP detectors and 20× Plan-Apochromat objective with a NA of 0.75. To measure changes in melanocyte morphology the SNT plugin for FIJI was used to generate 3D models of the melanocytes, and these were used to determine dendrite length and branches of the melanocyte dendrites.

    "In general, analysis that can be performed on normal skin can also be performed on organotypic cultures. The cultures can be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE), and sectioned like normal skin, and pigment can be stained using the Fontana-Masson stain protocol as would be used for normal skin. Fontana-Masson stain will stain melanin black and the kit used here uses a nuclear fast red stain to label the tissue. The intensity of the nuclear fast red stain can be modified by increasing or decreasing the time incubated in the stain, and if quantifying Fontana-Masson stain, reducing it is best to reduce the nuclear red fast stain as much as possible. For quantification of Fontana-Masson stain, the images can be taken in brightfield and areas that are positive for stain can be quantified. For an example of Fontana-Masson stained organotypic skin cultures used for quantification see Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.536#cpz1536-fig-0007].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6d07b8f7-346a-4884-9baf-192db6d6e49a/cpz1536-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nMeasuring changes in pigment in organotypic skin cultures.
