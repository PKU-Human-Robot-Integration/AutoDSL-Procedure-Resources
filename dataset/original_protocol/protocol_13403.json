    "All the experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals at Zhejiang University and were approved by the Animal Advisory Committee at Zhejiang University.\n1. Left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (LAD ligation) surgery\nNOTE: Eight week old male C57BL/6J mice were used as models. The hearts were harvested 2 weeks after MI. Left anterior descending coronary artery ligation surgery was carried out as previously described and demonstrated11.\nDisinfect the surgical instruments with 70% ethanol before surgery.\nWeigh the mouse, and then anesthetize the mouse with intraperitoneal injections of 1% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Observe the toe-pinch reflex, and measure the respiratory rate to evaluate the depth of anesthesia during the procedure.\nPlace the mouse on the operating table with a 37 °C heating pad. Use ophthalmic ointment to prevent eye dehydration.\nDepilate its left precordial chest and neck with depilatory cream, and use cotton swabs to remove hairs. Disinfect its skin with iodophor, followed by 70% alcohol to clean the area three times.\nPerform a midline cervical incision (0.8-1.0 cm) under a microscope. Separate the skin, muscle, and tissue surrounding the trachea, and then insert a 20 G cannula into the trachea.\n\tNOTE: Observe while inserting the cannula into the trachea under microscopic view to ensure that the tube is not inserted into the esophagus.\nConnect the mouse to a rodent ventilator set at 0.2 mL tidal volume with 150 strokes per minute.\nIncise the mouse chest obliquely along the midclavicular line with a sterile scissor. Dissect the subcutaneous tissue to expose the ribs.\nUse sterile scissors to cut the skin obliquely along the left mid-clavicular line (0.8-1.0 cm). Perform left thoracotomy to separate the third and fourth ribs to expose the heart. Use a rib retractor for a clear view.",
    "Open the pericardium with curved forceps, and then ligate the left anterior descending artery (below the left atrium appendage) using a 7-0 silk suture. A pale anterior wall of the left ventricle indicates that the myocardial perfusion is successfully interrupted.\nRelease the rib retractor, and stitch the thoracic incision in layers with a 5-0 silk suture while expelling air from the chest. Stitch the neck incision with a 5-0 suture silk suture.\nRemove the tracheal tube from the mouse once its spontaneous breathing is restored. Intraperitoneally inject 0.5 mL of pre-warmed sterile saline. Inject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) every 12 h subcutaneously to minimize pain.\nFinally, place the mouse on the heating pad to wait for resuscitation. Monitor the mouse to ensure it does not suffer from excessive dyspnea or hemorrhaging via visual observation.\nReturn the mouse to its cage after it wakes up. For the first week, monitor the mouse daily to verify that its mobility, grooming, and eating habits are adequate. According to the experiment's needs, harvest the heart at different time points after MI.\n\t​NOTE: In this protocol, the single-cell suspension was prepared with the heart 2 weeks after MI.\n2. Preparation of the cardiac single-cell suspension\nPreparation of the solutions and media\n\t\nCardiac tissue dissociation buffer: Mix 10 mg of collagenase IV (600 U/mL), 5 mg of dispase II (0.5 U/mL), and 50 µL of DNase I (100 µg/mL) in 5 mL of RPMI 1640. Pre-warm this medium to 37 °C in a water bath before use.\nCell wash buffer: Prepare 1% BSA or 10% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, PH 7.4), and keep at 4 °C or on ice.\nPerfusion solution: Pre-cool PBS (PH 7.4) as a perfusion solution.\nRed blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer: Use the RBC lysis buffer as mentioned by the manufacturer.",
    "NOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for the list of reagents and equipment used in this study.\nEuthanize the mouse by an intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium (150 mg/kg) injection.\nHeart dissection\n\t\nPlace the mouse in a supine position by fixing its hindlimbs in place with adhesive tape.\nSpray the body with 70% ethanol, and then cut vertically through the abdominal skin and muscles while avoiding piercing the liver. Carefully open the thorax while avoiding puncturing the heart.\nUse the pre-cooled PBS (PH 7.4) to perfuse the left ventricle until the colorless perfusion fluid is observed (approximately 15 mL of PBS [pH 7.4] is needed).\nGently lift the heart from the thorax with forceps, and cut away the excess tissue attached to the outside of the heart with ophthalmic scissors. Place the heart in 1 mL of pre-cooled PBS (PH 7.4) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nEnzymatic dissociation of the heart tissue\n\t\nTransfer the mouse heart into one well of a 24-well plate with 150 µL of the cardiac tissue dissociation buffer placed on ice, and cut it into small pieces (~1 mm) with a scissor.\nTransfer the minced heart tissue into a 15 mL centrifuge tube with 5 mL of the tissue dissociation buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The recommended cardiac tissue dissociation buffer volume is 5 mL/heart.\nPlace the centrifuge tube in the electrically thermostatic reciprocating shaker at 125 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C. Pipet the tissue suspension up and down 10 times every 20 min.",
    "Filter the cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove undigested tissue and clumps. Add 25 mL of the cell wash buffer to rinse the original tube, and then transfer it to rinse the cell strainer. Next, filter the cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer to further remove cell clumps.\nCentrifuge the filtered cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, and then resuspend the cell sample in 1x RBC lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nAdd four times more volume of the cell wash buffer, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of the cell wash buffer. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of the cell wash buffer.\nMix 18 µL of the cell suspension with 2 µL of acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (9:1), and add 10 µL of the mixture to a counting chamber slide. Evaluate the cell numbers and viability using an automatic cell counter.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
