    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all the materials, reagents, and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Fluorophore labeling of cells by lentiviral transduction\nThaw an aliquot of the solubilized basement membrane matrix of choice on ice.\nWhile the aliquot is thawing, add sterile water to fill in the gaps between the wells in a 24-well plate, along with all the outer wells.\n\tNOTE: This leaves eight wells open in the middle for use and ensures that the cells remain in high humidity, thus minimizing evaporation-induced variability.\nDilute the solubilized basement membrane matrix 1:100 in ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium (a final concentration of 0.089 mg/mL was obtained with the lot used here).\nAdd 300 µL of the diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix to one of the middle (open) wells of the prepared 24-well plate per infection to be performed. Be sure to evenly cover the entire bottom of the well, and add more, if needed, to ensure an even coating.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at 37 °C to allow a layer to solidify along the well bottom. Verify at the end of this incubation that the liquid is still fully covering the well bottom and has not evaporated in the center. Evaporation is a sign that the humidity is too low; if this happens, repeat the coating.\n\tNOTE: The plates can be coated the evening before and left in diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix without evident ill effects; however, the risk of evaporation is greatly increased, so they must be carefully inspected before use.\nRemove the medium from one well of confluent iPSC-derived NPCs growing in a well plate.\n\tNOTE: For this paper, iPSC-derived neural progenitors produced using a commercial kit as per the manufacturer's instructions between passage 3 and passage 10 were used.",
    "Gently add 1 mL of PBS to the side of the well, and rock the plate to ensure even washing.\nRemove the PBS, and replace with 300 µL of the proteolytic-collagenolytic enzyme mix, again rocking the plate to ensure to fully coat the well bottom. Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Verify that the cells are detaching from the plate surface by light microscopy.\nWith a P1,000 pipette, add 700 µL of DMEM/F12, and detach the cells by spraying this mixture across all the surfaces of the bottom of the plate. Pipette up and down to ensure the cell aggregates are broken up into a uniform single-cell suspension. Take up the cells, and add to 9 mL of DMEM/F12 medium in a conical 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nDuring this time, prepare enough medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 for 500 µL per well to be plated, plus 1 mL for resuspension.\n\tNOTE: Y-27632 is necessary to ensure high survival of the NPCs after passage as single cells.\nRemove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of Y-27632-supplemented medium, pipetting up and down gently several times to break up the cell aggregates.\nTake out a few microliters of cells, and dilute them (1:5 to 1:10) in trypan blue.\nCount the viable (trypan blue-negative) cells on a hemocytometer. Adjust the trypan blue dilution to get at least 50 viable cells per quadrant of the hemocytometer to ensure the counts are accurate. Calculate the volume of cell suspension needed for 100,000 cells to be present in each well.",
    "Mix the cells gently up and down by pipetting, and take up the calculated volume (for 100,000 cells per well). Add this to the Y-27632-supplemented medium (from step 1.11) such that the final volume is 500 µL per well to be plated.\nRemove the diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix from the previously coated wells (assuming the 30 min or longer incubation has been completed).\nMix the cells gently by pipetting, and add 500 µL of the cell suspension to each well.\nTo evenly distribute the cells, move the plate in a large \"+\" sign motion with gentle linear sweeps (forward-backward, stop, back-forth) immediately prior to placing into a cell culture incubator.\nIncubate overnight (16-24 h) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the medium, and add the titrated lentivirus. If single integration events are required, aim for a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 infectious units per cell (ideally titrated on the cells of interest), and top up to 500 µL in medium (without Y-27632).\n\tNOTE: The lentivirus of interest can be purchased pre-titrated or produced in-house as done previously22. Here, an in-house-produced GFP lentivirus with puromycin resistance was used to generate and select the NPCs expressing EGFP. If the lentivirus has not been titrated on the cells of interest and the copy number is critical, it is recommended that several volumes be added to a couple of wells and that the well with ~30% EGFP+ cells 48-72 h be used later. If the copy number is not critical, excess virus can be added with the caveat that insertional mutagenesis may result in anomalous behavior in some clones. CAUTION: Lentiviral vectors are a level 2-3 biological hazard (depending on their contents). Follow local biosafety regulations for handling the lentivirus, the decontamination of surfaces and plasticware, and liquid waste.",
    "Return the cells to the incubator, and incubate them for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the cells from the incubator, and remove the supernatant.\n\tCAUTION: As the supernatant from the cells still contains lentiviral particles at this point, continue to follow local biosafety regulations for its handling and disposal.\nRinse the cells with 2 x 500 µL of PBS by gently adding PBS to the wall of the well; then, remove from the well corner to wash away any remaining lentivirus.\n\tCAUTION: As the supernatant from the cells still contains lentiviral particles at this point, continue to follow local biosafety regulations for its handling and disposal.\nChange to 500 µL of fresh medium (without Y-27632), and continue to grow at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight.\nUse live-cell fluorescence microscopy to verify the proportion of cells that express EGFP and select the well with which to proceed.\nIf the lentiviral vector of choice contains a selection cassette (antibiotic resistance gene such as puromycin resistance), add the selection agent (here, 1 µg/mL puromycin) to the medium at a previously validated dose that kills sensitive but not resistant cells. Otherwise, use fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate the EGFP+ cells at the time of the first split.\nFrom now onward, maintain the cells with daily monitoring for confluency, and perform complete medium changes daily.\nWhen confluency is reached, prepare one or more wells of a fresh 6-well coated plate (with 1 mL of diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix; see steps 1.3-1.5), and harvest the cells as described in steps 1.6-1.15.",
    "NOTE: If no selection agent is included, sort the cells by flow cytometry at this stage. Ensure that the cells are sorted with a sufficiently wide nozzle and low pressure to minimize stress, as well as that 10 µM Y-27632 is included at every step in the sorting process.\nPlate the cells to a final density of 200,000 cells/cm2.\nMaintain the daily monitoring and complete medium changes daily.\n\tNOTE: When the cells again reach confluency, they are now ready for use. Alternatively, a stock can now be frozen down for future use as follows.\nSplit, harvest, and count the cells as described in steps 1.6-1.15.\nPre-label a set of cryovials with the relevant information (e.g., passage, EGFP%, line).\nResuspend at 400,000 cells/mL in medium + 10% DMSO.\n\tNOTE: DMSO is toxic to cells when not frozen, so minimize the time spent at room temperature in the presence of DMSO.\nAdd 1 mL (400,000 cells) of the mixture from step 1.33 per cryovial, and place in a cell-freezing container.\nTransfer the container to a −80 °C freezer overnight.\nThe following day, transfer the cells into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n2. Labeled cell injection into the brain organoid\nNOTE: For this paper, cerebral organoids were produced using a commercial kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. This can be replaced with the cerebral organoid of interest. The materials used in this part of the protocol must be prechilled to avoid the gelling of the solubilized basement membrane matrix at above 4 °C.\nPlace the insulin syringe(s), tips, and tubes that are going to be in contact with the solubilized basement membrane matrix at −20 °C to let them cool.",
    "Thaw a suitable-size aliquot of solubilized basement membrane matrix on ice depending on the number of injections that are going to be performed (~2 µL/injection). This takes approximately 30 min.\nWhile the aliquot is thawing, split, harvest, and count the cells as described in steps 1.6-1.15.\nCalculate the volumes needed per injection. If doing multiple injections, place the total volume of cells in a 1.5 mL tube, and add up to 1 mL of DMEM/F12.\n\tNOTE: A volume that allows for a few extra injections should be used to account for losses/pipetting errors.\nPlace the cells into ice while the next steps are being prepared.\nAfter thawing, dilute the solubilized basement membrane matrix to a final concentration of 3 mg/mL in ice-cold DMEM/F12.\nTake the single-cell suspension from the ice, and spin it down at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, spinning at room temperature generally appears to be tolerated.\nGently remove the medium completely without disturbing the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting in the diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix (3 mg/mL) to obtain a final volume of 2 µL per injection to be performed, and immediately place it back on ice until use.\n\tNOTE: The resuspension of the cells needs to be performed slowly and with prechilled tips to avoid the formation of bubbles and gelling.\nTransfer the prechilled syringe(s) from the −20 °C freezer into an ice bucket. Keep them there until use.\nRemove the plate with the brain organoids from the incubator. Use a wide-bore tip to transfer the organoid to be injected into a 35 mm dish. Remove all the medium possible without damaging the organoid to stabilize it and facilitate the injection.",
    "NOTE: It is important to use wide-bore tips to avoid destroying the organoid. If they are not available, cut the end of a regular P1,000 tip with sterile scissors.\nPlace the 35 mm dish containing the organoid under a dissecting microscope to help guide and facilitate the injection.\n\tNOTE: If a dissecting microscope is not available in a sterile area, it is possible to perform the injection without one, albeit with somewhat reduced control. Another alternative is the use of a magnification loop or glasses.\nOnce the organoid(s) are ready to be injected, gently resuspend the cells with a chilled P20 pipette tip, and move 2 µL (containing the desired number of cells to be injected) onto a prechilled sterile glass slide.\n\tNOTE: For multiple injections, additional 2 µL volumes can be added across the glass slide. Keep it on ice, and take care to avoid evaporation.\nTake a prechilled insulin syringe from the ice, and slowly draw up the 2 µL of cell suspension with the bevel of the needle facing down to allow all the cells/medium to be taken up.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to go extremely slowly to avoid drawing in any air.\nOpen the lid of the dish containing the organoid, and focus the microscope on it. Hold the dish with one hand. Place the bevel of the needle up, and with the other hand, inject the cells slowly into the organoid surface.\n\tNOTE: It is important to inject slowly to avoid damaging the tissue.\nAfter the injection, place the lid back into the dish, and let the injected organoid sit for 1-2 min.\n\tNOTE: This allows the diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix to gel, holding the cells in place. If the medium is added too early, it can wash away the cells sitting at the surface.",
    "Gently add 500 µL of the organoid medium, and transfer the organoid with a wide-bore tip into a well of a 24-well plate. Incubate the organoid at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight. Perform complete medium changes every second day.\n\t​NOTE: It is important to include a negative control organoid (mock injected), which will be used for imaging adjustments. To do this, inject an organoid as previously described with diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix (3 mg/mL) to obtain a final volume of 2 µL without cells.\n3. Graft tracking by live-cell fluorescence imaging\nNOTE: Use a fluorescence microscope that can excite the fluorophore of interest and has the filter set needed to detect its fluorescence. As mentioned before, the NPCs used here were EGFP+, with an excitation peak of 488 nm and an emission peak of ~510 nm.\nLoad a negative control organoid (non-injected or mock injected), and set the illumination intensity and exposure time such that autofluorescence is minimal. For the instrument used here, the illumination intensity was set between 1 and 2 and the exposure time between 80 ms and 100 ms.\n\tNOTE: As many excitation wavelengths (particularly lower wavelengths) can be toxic to cells, it is recommended to keep the intensity low and to avoid looking for too long to prevent damage to the organoid.\nLoad the positive control organoid, and raise the exposure time if necessary to ensure that labeled cells are clearly visible. Reposition the organoid with a wide-bore pipette tip to find the injection site (EGFP+ region).",
    "Remove the medium completely from the negative control organoid. Load the negative control organoid, and image it with the selected settings (for the instrument used here, the illumination intensity was set between 1 and 2 and the exposure time between 80 ms and 100 ms). When the imaging is complete, immediately add fresh medium to prevent the organoid from drying out.\n\tNOTE: Medium removal is critical for obtaining a good image as it fixes the height and orientation of the organoids, which are otherwise floating and constantly moving, precluding high-quality imaging.\nRepeat the medium removal/imaging with each of the test organoids.\nReturn the organoids to normal incubation/medium changes (as in step 2.16), and repeat the imaging at desired intervals. Here, the organoids were imaged at week 1, week 9, and week 16 post injection to follow and test the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of the injected EGFP+ NPCs.\n4. Histology and immunofluorescence\nAt the endpoint, transfer the organoid to a histology cassette labeled with the ID of the organoid and other necessary identifiers.\nFill the cassette with 10% formalin, and close it. Keep it at room temperature for 24 h.\nTransfer the closed cassette with the organoid to a tissue process, and set the following protocol: ethanol 70% 10 min, ethanol 80% 20 min, ethanol 95% 30 min, ethanol 100% 30 min, ethanol 100% 40 min, ethanol 100% 50 min, toluene 30 min, toluene 40 min, toluene 50 min, paraffin 25 min at 59 °C, paraffin 35 min at 59 °C, paraffin 40 min at 59 °C, paraffin 50 min at 59 °C.",
    "NOTE: The above steps are done under a vacuum at room temperature unless otherwise specified. This protocol replaces the water with gradients of alcohol up to 100%. The intermediate step with toluene is a transition between the alcohol and paraffin, as both are soluble in it. CAUTION: Toluene and paraffin are considered hazardous materials as they can be highly flammable liquids and can cause damage by inhalation or contact with the skin or eyes. Make sure to store them tightly closed in a secure space. Wear proper personal protective equipment when handling them. Dispose of waste according to local chemical hazard regulations.\nTransfer the closed cassette with the organoid into a paraffin bath in the embedding station.\nTake the cassette from the bath, open it, and transfer the organoid into a steel base mold. Place the mold under the paraffin dispenser, and cover it completely with paraffin.\nPlace the empty cassette on the top of the steel base mold. Here, add more paraffin on top of the cassette.\nTransfer the steel base mold with the cassette on top into ice, and let it cool for 5 min. Remove the steel mold, and keep the cassette with the organoid embedded in a paraffin block.\nTransfer the cassette into a microtome to cut sections. Cut sections as desired.\n\tNOTE: Here, sections of 15 µm thickness were made throughout the organoid.\nDrop each section onto the surface of a water bath set at 45 °C, and pick it up on a glass microscope slide.\nLet the slides dry in an incubator at 42 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: The slides can now be stored at room temperature until the time of staining.\nPlace the slide in a Coplin slide staining jar filled with toluene for 2 min. Repeat this step once more.",
    "CAUTION: Toluene is considered a hazardous material as it can be a highly flammable liquid and can cause damage by inhalation or contact with the skin or eyes. Make sure to store it tightly closed in a secure space. Wear proper personal protective equipment when handling it. Dispose of waste according to local chemical hazard regulations.\nTransfer to a glass Coplin slide staining jar filled with EtOH 100% for 2 min. Repeat this step once more.\nTransfer to a glass Coplin slide staining jar filled with distilled water for 2 min. Repeat this step once more.\nFor antigen retrieval, prepare citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0).\n\tNOTE: Citrate buffer can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 months or at 4 °C for longer storage.\nSet a water bath between 95 °C and 100 °C.\n\tCAUTION: This water bath can cause burns if one is not careful. Take all necessary precautions to avoid direct contact with the bath or its components.\nIn the water bath, float a plastic container that can fit the slides inside. Ensure the plastic does not touch the bottom of the bath (assuming it is a bottom-heating bath) to avoid melting. Pour the citrate buffer inside the plastic container, and let it reach 95-100 °C.\nOnce the buffer reaches the desired temperature, place the slides inside the buffer, and loosely cover the container with a lid. Leave the slides inside the container in the water bath for 30-40 min.\nRemove the plastic container from the water bath, and let it cool at room temperature for 20 min more.\nWash the slides for 3 x 2 min with PBS. Remove the PBS with a paper tissue without touching the sample or overdrying it.",
    "Prepare the permeabilization buffer (90 mL of PBS + 0.1% Tween-20), and fill a glass slide staining jar with it. Immerse the slides in the permeabilization buffer, and incubate for 10 min.\nWash the slides for 3 x 2 min with PBS.\nPrepare enough staining mix to cover each sample (~25 µL).\n\tNOTE: See Table 1 for the antibodies and the final concentrations used here.\nAdd 25 µL of staining mix to cover each organoid slice. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the samples remain at a high humidity to prevent the evaporation of the staining mix. If a container to keep the slides humid is not available, put them inside a box with some wet tissues on the corner.\nWash the slides for 3 x 2 min with PBS.\nRinse once with distilled water inside a glass slide staining jar to remove the salt.\nAdd 10 µL of liquid mountant + 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to each of the samples.\n\tNOTE: The slides can be sealed if a second round of staining is not performed. Here, the slides were not covered to allow access for quenching/restaining as coverslip removal can damage the tissue.\nImage the slides using the selected fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to have positive and negative controls for each antibody to allow the proper setting of the intensities and exposure times (for the instrument used here, the illumination intensity was set between 5 and 6 and the exposure time between 2,000 ms and 3,000 ms), though this can vary depending on the antibody. Additionally, ensure the microscope has adequate detectors for each channel used. Be aware that as the samples are not covered, they need to be placed face up while imaging them.",
    "After imaging, prepare fresh 2x quenching buffer (9% H2O2 + 50 mM NaOH in PBS).\n\tNOTE: The quenching solution must be prepared fresh immediately before using it. The reaction is sensitive to the activity of the H2O2, which will decrease over time. CAUTION: H2O2 is an irritant, and NaOH is caustic. These should be treated with appropriate safety equipment, and skin contact should be avoided. Ensure they are disposed of in accordance with local chemical safety policies.\nFill the glass Coplin slide staining jar halfway with 2x quenching buffer (45 mL), add 45 mL PBS, and put the slides inside. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nCheck by fluorescence microscopy that the fluorophores were effectively quenched.\nRepeat the staining and imaging as above.\n\tNOTE: The quenching and restaining can be repeated for additional rounds as needed, though the risk of damage increases with each additional round.\n5. Image registration\nOpen FIJI.\nMake a folder with the DAPI images from round 1 and round 2. Change the names to clarify which is which, if needed.\nMake an empty folder for the output of the image registration.\nClick on Plugins | Registration | Register Virtual Stack Slices.\nUnder Source directory, select the folder containing the DAPI images from each round.\nUnder Output directory, select the folder made for the registration output.\nSet the Feature extraction model to Rigid and the Registration model dropdown menu to Rigid - translate+rotate to fix the registration, only allowing the image to be moved and rotated for alignment rather than be deformed.\n\tNOTE: Should deformation be expected, the feature extraction model and registration model could be adjusted to Affine or other models as desired, though this can result in undesired transformations. Occasionally a slice may be damaged between rounds, which can prevent successful registration.",
    "Check the Save transforms box to save the transformation parameters, allowing them to be applied to the other channels.\nClick on OK.\nSelect the location to save the transform file (defaults to the input directory), and click on Open.\nSelect the DAPI image to serve as a reference for the transforms. The DAPI image from each of the other rounds will be aligned to this one.\n\tNOTE: When complete, the registered images will appear as a stack (and in the output folder).\nUse the slide bar on the bottom to flip back and forth between the images to verify that the image registration was successful (the nuclei are in the same place in both images, at least for the overlapping areas).\nVerify that an .xml file has been created for each round of the input images.\n\tNOTE: These contain the translation parameters needed for the files from that round.\nMake a folder containing all the images to be registered (each channel of each round). Note the order of the files.\nMake a folder for the transformation parameters, and make one copy of the .xml file for each round per channel to be registered. Double-check that the file order (by name) is the same between the images to be registered and the transformation parameter copies, as the next step will go through and transform each image in the order of the transformation parameter files.\nClick on Plugins | Transform | Transform Virtual Stack Slices.\nUnder Source directory, select the folder containing the images to be registered.\nUnder Output directory, select the folder made for the registration output.",
    "Under Transforms directory, select the folder containing the .xml files with one copy per image file to be transformed. Again, make sure the order matches the files (i.e., one copy of the round 1 .xml for each round 1 channel, one copy of the round 2 .xml for each round 2 channel, etc.).\nClick on OK.\n\tNOTE: When complete, the registered images from that round will appear as a stack (and in the output folder).\nUse the slide bar on the bottom to flip back and forth between the channels. Verify that all the channels were transformed in the same way. If not, this is likely due to a wrong .xml file in the transforms directory; in this case, fix the file and repeat.\n\tNOTE: The brightness range displayed will be based on one channel, but this does not affect the actual saved images, just the display.\nObserve that the registered images are all successfully aligned across rounds and ready for overlays/downstream analysis.\n\tNOTE: There are more efficient programmatic ways to accomplish registration for large batches. The method presented here is just an easy one that does not require programming."
