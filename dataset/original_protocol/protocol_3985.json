    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nInjection of SB-Based Plasmids into the Lateral Ventricle of Neonatal Mice to Generate Glioma In Situ\nTiming: 1–1.30 h\nThis workflow for inducing brain tumors in neonatal day 1 pups has been adopted from (Wiesner et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and is extensively used in our group to develop low or high grade glioma models harboring different genotypes (Calinescu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Koschmann et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Núñez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Garcia-Fabiani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Comba et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Brain tumors are induced by transposon-mediated integration of genetic alterations delivered in plasmid DNA into the host genome, without the need of viral vectors ( Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). The tumors arise from the glial cells next to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricle, where plasmids are injected ( Koschmann et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Núñez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Gliomas generated with the SB-based method recapitulate salient features of the human disease ( Calinescu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Koschmann et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Núñez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), thus representing a versatile and reliable model to study brain tumor’s biology and the efficacy of therapeutic agents.\nLoad the syringe with 10 μL of the DNA/jetPEI solution.\nInduce anesthesia by hypothermia by placing the mouse pup wrapped in a gauze on wet ice for 2 min.\nPlace the pup on the previously cooled stereotaxic stage and immobilize the head using the ear bars. Wipe the head with ethanol 70%.\nCritical: Make sure that the head is placed firmly and parallel to the stereotaxic stage.\nAdjust the microdrive screws to lower the needle close to the head and place it in the midline intersection of the parietal and occipital bones (lambda).\nAdjust the stereotaxic coordinates to 0.8 mm lateral and 1.5 mm rostral to the lambda (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Lower the needle until it touches the skin, record the dorso-ventral coordinates.\nLower the needle 1.5 mm to pierce the skin and skull. At this position, the tip of the needle should be inside the lateral ventricle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUsing an automatic injector, inject 0.75 μl of the DNA/jetPEI solution at a rate of 0.5 μl/min.\nAfter the DNA/jetPEI solution has been injected, keep the pup in the frame for 1 min.\nCritical: To prevent burns, make sure that the temperature of the frame does not go below 2 ˚C.\nAnesthetize the next pup by repeating step 2.\nSlowly and gently lift the needle to pull it out from the brain.\nPlace the pup under a heating lamp until normal breathing resumes, monitoring that it recovers its mobility and its rosy color. Apply a gentle lung massage if necessary to aid the breathing recovery.\nCritical: Limit the time between mouse anesthesia and the post-injection warm up. This will ensure the pup will survive better after the SB plasmid injection. Mouse survival is usually absolute when this procedure lasts less than 10 min. If the procedure lasts more than 10 min, mouse survival could be reduced by 10%.\nOnce the pup is breathing and moving normally, place it back in the cage with the mother and monitor the mother’s response to the pups. Start the injection on the next pup, already anesthetized in step 10.\nCritical: If there are more pups in the breeding cage, mark the tail of the injected animal before putting it back in the cage to avoid injecting the same pup twice.\nAfter all the injections are done, monitor the cage for another 30 min to ensure that the mother is nurturing the pups.",
    "Critical: Usually, mothers instantly accept the pups after the procedure. However, if it is observed that the mom is not nurturing the pups, a surrogate mother can be added to the cage.\nPlace cage back to the animal room and monitor tumor growth.\nCritical: The pT2/SB100x-Luc not only encodes for the SB transposase, but also for the Luciferase enzyme, which gets inserted into the host genome. Thus, plasmid uptake by brain cells can be monitored 24 h after the intraventricular injection using an IVIS bioluminescence imager (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D, first panel) (Calinescu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Koschmann et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Núñez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Garcia-Fabiani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Monitoring tumor growth by bioluminescence as the animals grow might be challenging because of the increased optical density of the fur, skin and skull. However, when the tumor reaches a threshold size, 1–2 mm3 for darkly pigmented C57BL6 mice, tumor detection is possible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D, second and third panels).\nTumor Monitoring by Bioluminescence Imaging and EdU Administration\nTiming: 1–4 h\nDepending on the genetic alterations introduced into the mouse brain cells, animals will display tumor burden symptoms in two or more months after the SB procedure (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). These symptoms consist of weight loss, ruffled fur, hunched posture, impaired mobility or other abnormalities in movement. Usually, tumor progression can be monitored by bioluminescence two or three weeks before signs of tumor burden become evident. Endpoint tumors commonly display a bioluminescence of 10 7–108 photons/s/cm2 /sr (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] D). EdU injections should be performed before mice show signs of tumor burden; when tumor is easily detectable by bioluminescence but is not yet necrotic or hemorrhagic. For this procedure, EdU is injected when animals display 106 photons/s/cm2/sr IVIS signal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nMeasure tumor volume using an IVIS bioluminescence imager.",
    "Anesthetize the animals in the anesthesia chamber with oxygen/isoflurane flow (1.5–2.5% isoflurane).\nInject 100 μl of Luciferin solution (30 mg/mL) intraperitoneally and start a timer for 5 min.\nPlace the animal back to the chamber and wait for 3–4 min.\nStart oxygen/isoflurane flow in the bioluminescence chamber and place the animal in the slot equipped with the glass nose cones.\nPlace the animal in the bioluminescence chamber and when the timer goes off acquire a series of 6 images, at 2 min intervals with an automatic exposure time, median binning, and an open aperture of f = 1.\nSelect the area of interest (i.e. the head) with an oval figure and measure the luminescence intensity using the calibrated unit photons/s/cm2/sr.\nIf the animal has a 106 photons/s/cm2/sr signal, proceed to EdU administration.\nEdU injection\nInject 10 mg/kg of the EdU dilution intraperitoneally. For instance, for mice weighting 30 g, inject 300 μl of the EdU dilution.\nWait 3 h and proceed with the next steps.\nTumor Dissection and Depletion of CD45 Cells\nTiming: 2.5 h\nCritical: For the next steps, work quickly, always keep the cells cold, and use pre-cooled solutions. This will prevent cell death, capping of antibodies on the cell surface and non-specific cell labeling.\n3 h after EdU injection, euthanize the animal with an overdose of isoflurane. Examine animal responsiveness by toe and tail pinch.\nDecapitate the animal’s head and gently dissect the brain from the skull.\nPlace the brain into a Petri-dish on wet ice. Since the SB plasmids encoding for the oncogenes also encode for fluorescent proteins (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), tumor tissue can be visualized and accurately dissected from the brain using a stereo-zoom microscope equipped with a fluorescent light illumination system (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/95-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Images Depicting Critical Steps of Tumor Dissection and CD45+ Cell Depletion Procedure\n(A) Images showing a mouse SB-generated glioma under a stereo-zoom microscope equipped with a fluorescent light illumination system. In this example, the tumor was generated with SB plasmids encoding for genes coupled to GFP (middle picture) and Katushka (right picture) expression as reporter genes. Scale bars, 0.5 cm.\n(B) Image showing a 50 mL conical tube, with a cell strainer on the top and a pestle, used to disintegrate the tumor tissue.\n(C) Image illustrating MACS CD45-depletion column set up.\nDissect the tumor from the brain using scalpels.\nPlace the tumor pieces into a 50 mL conical tube with 5 mL of NS complete media.\nUsing a cell strainer on a 50 mL conical tube and the sterile pestle of a 1 mL syringe, disaggregate the tumor tissue. Rinse the strainer with 10 mL of NS media through the strainer. Continue homogenizing the tissue through the strainer. Rinse two more times with 10 mL of NS media. Keep the single cell suspension on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 xg for 5 min at 25°C.\nRemove supernatant and add 1 mL of 1X cold RBCLB. Incubate 1 min on ice. To stop cell lysis, add 9 mL of DPBS.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 xg for 5 min at 25°C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 90 μl of cold BSA-EDTA buffer.\nCount the cells using trypan blue and a hemocytometer.\nAdd 10 μl of CD45 MicroBeads per 107 total cells. Mix well by pipetting.\nCritical: When working with 107 or less cells, follow the volume of reagents listed above. When working with higher amount of cells, scale up all reagent volumes accordingly.\nIncubate beads-cell suspension for 15 min at 4°C.",
    "Critical: Do not incubate on ice, as it might require longer incubation time.\nAdd 1 mL of BSA-EDTA buffer to wash the cells and centrifuge at 300 xg for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μl of cold BSA-EDTA buffer.\nPlace the LS column on a suitable MACS separator.\nCritical: LS columns allow the retention of up to 1×108 labeled cells and processing samples with up to 2×109 cells. There are different column size options available and we recommend evaluating which is the one that best suits the tissue to be used and the approximate amount of cells to be analyzed.\nPrecondition the LS column by rinsing it with 3 mL of BSA-EDTA buffer and letting all the solution to go through it.\nPlace a 15 mL collection tube below the column and add the pre-separation filter on top of it.\nNote: Pre-separation filters on the top of the columns are important to prevent cell clumping and column clogging.\nApply the cell suspension onto the filter and collect the CD45- cells that pass through the column ( Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nOnce the suspension stops dripping, wash the column once with 3 mL of cold BSA-EDTA buffer, collecting the eluate in the same tube (first eluate).\nTo further deplete CD45+ cells from this suspension, pass this first eluate through a second pre-conditioned column placed in the magnetic field, with a pre-separator filter on the top. Collect the eluted cells.\nWhen the entire cell suspension has gone through the column, apply 3 mL of cold BSA-EDTA buffer to rinse it, collecting the eluted cells (second eluate). These cells are mostly tumor cells, depleted of immune cells.\nPellet the CD45-depleted tumor cells by centrifuging the second eluate at 300 xg for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: This method allows the separation of tumor cells from immune cells with a substantial amount of viable cells. The number of CD45+ cells in the tumor enriched cell fraction is negligible (Garcia-Fabiani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nFlow Staining: Click-iT Reaction and Phospho-Ser10-Histone 3 Intracellular Staining\nTiming: 2.5 h\nEdU is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into DNA during active DNA synthesis. The detection of EdU is based on a click reaction between a picolyl azide, which is coupled to a fluorescent dye, and an alkyne (EdU nucleoside). In this protocol, we used a Pacific Blue-coupled azide. Moreover, the phosphorylation of the serine residue 10 in the histone 3 tail (p-Ser10-H3) is a critical event in mitosis. Histone-3-Serine-10 phosphorylation is important for chromosome condensation, and starts at late G2 phase, peaks at metaphase and decreases from late anaphase to early telophase (Kim et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). To study cell cycle characteristics, we performed EdU and p-Ser10-H3 intracellular staining on tumor cells.\nNote: It is highly recommended to use single stained compensation controls and single stained samples as controls, i.e., “EdU only” and “p-Ser10-H3 only” samples. Also, keep unstained cells for compensation set up.\nAdd 3 mL of 1% BSA-PBS buffer to wash the cells and centrifuge at 300 xg for 5 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant.\nFor 106 cells, add 100 μL of Click-iT fixative (Component D) and mix well by pipetting.\nIncubate the samples in fixative for 15 min at 25°C, protected from light.\nAdd 3 mL of 1% BSA-PBS buffer to wash the cells and centrifuge at 300 xg for 5 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets in 100 μL of 1X Click-iT permeabilization and wash reagent. Mix well.\nIncubate the samples 15 min at 25°C.",
    "Add 1 μL of p-Ser10-H3-PE antibody resuspended in 100 μL 1X Click-iT permeabilization and wash reagent to each sample.\nIncubate the samples for 30 min at 25°C, protected from light.\nAdd 3 mL of 1% BSA-PBS buffer to wash the cells and centrifuge at 300 xg for 5 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant.\nAdd 100 μL of 1X Click-iT permeabilization and wash reagent. Mix well.\nPrepare Click-iT EdU buffer additive 1X: dilute Click-iT EdU buffer additive 10X 1:10 in deionized water. For each reaction 50 μL of Click-iT EdU buffer additive 1X are necessary.\nFor each reaction, prepare the following cocktail:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_95_5.csv\nNote: Use the Click-iT cocktail within 15 min of preparation.\nAdd 500 μL of the Click-iT cocktail to each sample with the fixed cells and mix well. At this point, the total volume is 600 μL.\nIncubate the reaction for 30 min at 25°C, protected from light.\nAdd 3 mL of 1X Click-iT permeabilization and wash reagent to wash the cells and centrifuge at 300 xg for 5 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in flow buffer and analyze.\nPause Point: Once the cells are fixed, data acquisition by flow cytometry can be performed the next day. Store stained cells at 4°C protected from light.\nData Acquisition\nTiming: 1–2 h\nUse the single stained samples and the unstained sample to perform laser compensation. Once the laser set up is done, proceed to run the samples.\nThe gating strategy is to perform doublet discrimination first by gating in a SSC-W vs SSC-H plot and then FSC-W vs FSC-H plot ( Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] A), before EdU and p-Ser10-H3 positive cell identification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/95-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flow Cytometry Gating Strategy Used to Identify EdU+ and p-Ser10-H3+ Glioma Cells",
    "(A) Total cells are gated to exclude cellular debris (top left plot). Then, doublet discrimination gating is performed to filter out cellular aggregates (top middle and right plots). Lower panel: Left histogram: glioma cells positive for EdU (black=unstained control, blue=EdU (Pacific Blue staining)). Right histogram: glioma cells positive for p-Ser10-H3 expression (black=unstained control, red=p-Ser10-H3 (PE staining)).\n(B) Representative results for p-Ser10-H3 and EdU staining of tumor cells isolated from SB gliomas. Tumors were generated by the introduction of the following genetic alterations: NRASG12V overexpression, p53 and Atrx silencing for NPA; or NRASG12V overexpression, p53 and Atrx silencing, and IDH1R132H overexpression for NPAI (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] ). Results are shown as the % of positive cells (left table) or the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) (right table) ± SD, for each staining. NPAI tumors are less aggressive than NPA tumors and cells show different cell cycle characteristics.\nTo identify EdU positive cells, plot single cells as a histogram to analyze the distribution of the dye (i.e., Pacific Blue) ( Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, lower left panel). To identify p-Ser10-H3 positive cells, cells were plotted on a separate histogram and PE staining was measured ( Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, lower right panel).\nRun the single stained controls and set the gates.\nRun samples, collecting at least 30,000 events.\nAnalyze data using FlowJo software."
