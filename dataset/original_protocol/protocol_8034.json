    "1. Preparation of reagents\nNOTE: The materials necessary for this procedure are the following: forceps (nº 5 and nº 55), surgical tweezers, dissection Petri dishes (black bottom), 24-well plates, plastic Pasteur pipette, fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette, 10 mL syringe, 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nPrepare and sterilize all the material needed for the protocol including glass coverslips, forceps (nº 5 and nº 55), surgical tweezers, Petri dishes (black bottom), distilled H2O, pipettes and material for surgery.\nPrepare 0.1 mg/mL Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) solution.\n\t\nReconstitute PDL in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.2) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL (10x solution).\nDilute 1:10 in 166.6 mM borate buffer (pH 8.2) to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.\nPrepare 10 µg/mL laminin solution.\n\t\nDilute 1 mg/mL laminin in plain neurobasal medium to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL.\nPrepare Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS): 5.36 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 4.16 mM NaHCO3, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4·2H2O, 5 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 0.001% phenol red. Adjust pH to 7.2.\nPrepare 0.1% trypsin solution.\n\t\nDissolve 5 mg of trypsin 1:250 powder in 5 mL of HBSS for a final concentration of 0.1%.\nPlace in a roller mixer at 4 °C until completely dissolved.\nFilter using a 10 mL syringe and a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nPrepare ciliary ganglia incomplete medium: neurobasal medium without glutamine, 1X B27 (photo-sensitive), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2% heat-inactivated FBS, 12.5 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (0.25x) and 2 mM glutamine. Use sterile reagents and prepare the medium under sterile conditions.\nPrepare ciliary ganglia complete medium (supplemented with growth factors): to the incomplete medium, add 5 ng/mL GDNF and 5 ng/mL CNTF.\n2. Preparation of glass coverslips for 24-well plates",
    "Place the desired number of glass coverslips inside an acid resistant container and add 65% nitric acid until all coverslips are submerged. Place the container in an orbital shaker and incubate overnight at room temperature (RT) at a speed of 1000 rpm.\nThe next day, carefully transfer the nitric acid to a small reservoir and store for further use. Nitric acid can be re-used 2-3x.\nCarefully, add distilled H2O to the coverslips to remove the remaining nitric acid. Place in agitation for 30 minutes, discard the washing solution and repeat this 5x.\nRinse the coverslips with 75% ethanol twice.\nCarefully separate and place individual coverslips in a metal rack covered with aluminum foil and incubate at 50 ºC for 10-15 minutes or until fully dry.\n\tNOTE: Do not autoclave glass coverslips as they will stick to each other.\nSterilize the coverslips under UV light for 10-15 minutes. Maintain coverslips sterile for neuronal tissue culture.\n3. Coating of glass coverslips for 24-well plates\nUsing a sterile tweezer, place one coverslip in each well of a 24-well plate.\nAdd 500 µL of 0.1 mg/mL PDL and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nThe next day, rinse the coverslips twice with sterile distilled H2O. Then, add 500 µL of distilled water to each coverslip and leave for 30 minutes at room temperature.\nDiscard the water and add 350 µL of 10 µg/mL laminin solution in each well.\nPlace in a 37 °C incubator for 2 h.\nBefore cell plating, remove the laminin solution and wash twice with plain neurobasal medium.\n\tNOTE: It is important that the coverslips do not dry at any time.\nAdd 300 µL of complete medium and leave in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until plating time. Before plating cells, remove this medium.",
    "4. Culture of ciliary ganglia from chicken embryo (embryonic day 7)\nDissection of ciliary ganglia (CG)\n\t\nRemove eggs from incubator and spray them with 75% ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: Eggs are stored at ~16 °C before being incubated at 37.7 °C for 7 days (or the desired embryonic stage). Eggs used here are from Ross chicken species.\nCut the top of the egg with a scissor and take out the embryo using a spoon. Place the embryo in a Petri dish with ice-cold HBSS and separate the head from the body by cutting in the neck region.\n\t\tNOTE: As soon as the embryo is removed from the egg, it can produce proteases that are responsible for cell death. It is important to rapidly separate the head from the body once the embryo is outside the shell to minimize cell death.\nKeep the head of the embryo in ice-cold HBSS.\nHold the embryo head up and fix it in the beak of the chick with nº 5 forceps. Then with nº 55 forceps, start to remove the thin layer of skin around the eye.\nCarefully remove the eye and rotate it to access the posterior part. While separating the eye from the head of the chick, notice the optic nerve being sectioned. This will help to localize the ciliary ganglion.\nOnce the eye is separated, keep it with the posterior side up and notice the ciliary ganglion adjacent to the sectioned optic nerve and the choroid fissure. The preganglionic nerve might still be attached to the ciliary ganglion, which facilitates its identification.\nDissect the ciliary ganglion from each eye and clean very well by removing the excess tissue around each ganglion.",
    "NOTE: To have a yield of ~1x106 cells/mL, dissect ~70 CGs. Please note that the cell population obtained contains non-neuronal cells as well. To decrease the number of non-neuronal cells and, consequently, increase the purity of the neuronal population, it is very important to clean the ciliary ganglia as much as possible, removing all the excess tissue.\nDissociation and culture of ciliary ganglia\n\t\nCollect all ciliary ganglia to a 15 mL tube using a sterile plastic Pasteur pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to pre-wet the Pasteur pipette to minimize the attachment of the ganglia to the wall of the pipette.\nCentrifuge the ciliary ganglia for 2 minutes at 200 x g.\nCarefully, remove all the HBSS medium using a Pasteur pipette and then a P1000 micropipette. Add 1 mL of 0.1% trypsin solution and incubate for 20 minutes at 37 °C in a water bath, without agitation.\nCentrifuge for 2 minutes at 200 x g.\nImmediately remove the trypsin solution and add 1 mL of incomplete medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Incomplete medium contains serum which will immediately stop the effect of trypsin.\nCentrifuge for 2 minutes at 200 x g and remove all medium.\nAdd 350-500 µL of complete medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The necessary volume to dissociate cells depends on the number of ciliary ganglia obtained and, thus, on the obtained pellet size. For ~70 CG it is recommended to use 500 µL of medium.\nDissociate CGs by pipetting up and down 10-15x first using a P1000 followed by 10-15x using a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette. Avoid air bubble formation to minimize cell loss.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the cellular suspension on ice until plating.\nDetermine cellular density using a Trypan blue solution and a standard Neubauer chamber.",
    "Plate 1 x 104 cells/mL in each well of the 24-well plate by diluting the appropriate volume of cell suspension in 500 µL of complete medium (supplemented with 10 µM 5’-FDU).\nIncubate cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n5. Immunocytochemistry and image analysis of ciliary neurons\nPerform the immunocytochemistry assay presented in this paper as previously described16,17.\nUse the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal b-III tubulin (1:1000, T8578), chicken monoclonal neurofilament M (1:1000, AB5735), mouse monoclonal SV2 (1:1000, AB2315387).\nAs secondary antibodies, use Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000, A11031), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-chicken antibody (1:1000, A11041), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000, A21235).\nMount coverslips using mounting medium with DAPI, for nuclear staining (P36935).\nSubscription Required.
