    "Prepare Lysis buffer (Recipe 2) on the day of use. Leave the protease inhibitor cocktail to be added just before usage. Keep buffer on ice.Calculate the volume of Kinase buffer that will be needed, considering 10 µl per reaction tube, and taking into account that each condition (and controls) will be performed in triplicates. While prepare Kinase buffer (Recipe 4) adding all components but Kemptide, protease inhibitors, and ATP-32Pγ, which will be added before use.Isolate the insoluble PKA fraction from mouse sperm extractsNote: This section describes how to obtain PKA from the Triton-insoluble fraction of mouse sperm extracts, to be used as source of PKA in the activity assay. Euthanize 1 male mouse (8-20 weeks old) and perform surgery to extract the cauda regions from both epididymides (Figure 1). To do this:Lay the euthanized mouse dorsally on a dissection board.Spray the ventral area with 70% ethanol to prevent dry hair from detachingUsing scissors, incise the skin and muscle tissue from the abdominal wall, exposing the lower abdominal viscera (Figure 1A).Using forceps, remove the fat pads that cover the testis to get the epididymis exposed (Figure 1A).Identify the epididymis attached to the testis, excise it, and localize the cauda region (Figure 1B, red area). Remove it from the caput and corpus regions (Figure 1B grey area), and adipose tissue (Figure 1B blue area).While holding the cauda with forceps, perform 3 to 4 incisions, using surgery scissors (Figure 1C).Place both epididymides in a round-bottom 2 ml Eppendorf containing 500 µl of H-TYH medium (Figure 1D) and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200617/20200617014033_7128.jpgFigure 1. Sperm preparation. A. Ventral incision to excise the epididymis. Note the tweezers holding the cauda epididymis, attached to the testicle (red circled). B. Whole epididymis excised. Red, cauda; grey, caput and corpus; blue, adipose tissue.",
    "The cauda region is used for sperm swim out. C. Three to four incisions should be performed in each cauda, before allowing the sperm to swim out. D. Place both epididymides in a round-bottom Eppendorf tube containing 500 µl of H-TYH medium.Transfer the sperm suspension (500 µl) to a new round-bottom 2 ml Eppendorf tube, leaving the epididymides behind.Check sperm concentration by counting in a Neubauer chamber. Adjust concentration to 25 x 106 sperm/ml in H-TYH medium.Transfer the swim-out to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge the sperm suspension at 10,000 x g for 3 min at RTDiscard supernatant. If the amount of swim out was of 25 x 106 sperm in 1 ml, resuspend the pellet in 330 µl of ice-cooled Lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail before use. If a different amount of sperm is used, modify buffer addition accordingly.Incubate cells in Lysis buffer on ice for 30 minCentrifuge cells at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 330 µl of Lysis buffer (or same amount used in Step C7), with freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail. This fraction contains PKA. Each condition with 10 µl of fraction will have the soluble PKA fraction extracted from 7.5 x 105 sperm. Consider that a minimum of 1.5 x 105 sperm are needed for each condition, which should be tested in triplicate.Keep on ice for PKA activity assays. From now on this fraction is called PKA fraction.Kinase reaction assayConsider as many tubes as needed, keeping in mind that each condition should be performed in experimental triplicates, plus the following controls:Negative control: it contains all the reaction reagents except for PKA fraction, which is replaced by Lysis buffer.",
    "It is used to determine the amount of Kemptide that is marked by 32P in the absence of PKA.Positive control: it is a control of maximum PKA activity, i.e., in the presence of 1 mM cAMP and 100 µM IBMX.Add 10 µl of Lysis buffer containing any drug to be analyzed. Consider that it will be diluted 3x at the time of the reaction. Whatever drug to be tested must be considered within the 10 µl corresponding to the addition of this 10 µl of Lysis buffer.Add to each tube 10 µl of PKA fraction, except for the Negative control, in which PKA fraction should be replaced by 10 µl of Lysis buffer.Keep all tubes on ice until used.From Step D5 onwards the procedures must be performed in the radioisotope room. Please note that security measures must be taken when working with radioactive material. Proper shielding for the personnel is required, as well as adequate waste disposal according to institutional regulations.Complete preparation of the Kinase buffer by adding the proper amount of ATP-32Pγ (see Table 1), taking into consideration of the decay time and manufacture date, then add 1 µCi/assay.Table 1. Stock solutions and concentration for the preparation of Kinase bufferimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200617/20200617014522_6212.jpgNotes:All reagents are dissolved in distilled water, unless specified otherwise. The protease inhibitor cocktail is added as to prepare a 2x concentrated buffer, since the PKA fraction already contains cocktail. Addition of BSA is done to help precipitate all proteins after TCA addition, but keeping the Kemptide soluble.Sequentially add 10 µl of Kinase buffer to all tubes and place them at 37 °C. Start a new reaction every 30 s by adding 10 µl of Kinase buffer. Keep track of the sequential order of all tubes. This is crucial in order to stop the reactions exactly at the specified time.",
    "Incubate tubes at 37 °C for 30 min.Stop the reaction after 30 min by addition of 10 µl 40% TCA. Note that the total volume in each tube now is 40 µl.Incubate tubes on ice for 20 min.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 3 min, at RT.For each tube, take 10 µl of the supernatant, and spot onto the center of a P81 piece of paper, while holding it with tweezers (Figures 2A and 2B). Each piece of P81 paper should be labeled with pencil in order to identify them later. Wait 5 s for the drop to be absorbed, and release it in a 5 L beaker containing 1 L of 5 mM ortho-phosphoric acid (Figure 2C).Wash together all papers 6 x 5 min using 1 L of 5 mM ortho-phosphoric acid each time, in a beaker placed on an orbital shaker.While the washing in Step D12 proceeds, spot 1 µl of Kinase buffer on a P81 paper. Do this in triplicate using 3 different papers, and then directly insert each one in a different plastic vial, without washing. This step is necessary for data analysis to calculate the total amount of total ATP-32Pγ, initially present in the reaction media.After washing, place the P81 papers on a plastic tray, without contact between each other, and let them air dry for at least 2 h (Figure 2D). At this step, you can discontinue the protocol until the next day. Papers are identified according to the pencil mark written on them before spotting the reaction mixture.Once dried, place papers individually in a plastic vial, containing 1 ml of scintillation counter liquid, and register counts per minute (CPM) a vial counter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200617/20200617014610_5552.jpgFigure 2. P81 paper spotting. A. Prepare 2 x 2 cm P81 papers labeled with pencil marks. B.",
    "Spot each paper with 10 µl the supernatant of the reaction mixture after centrifugation (Step D11). Notice that the washing is being performed behind the protecting shield in a radioisotopes room. C. Place one by one all the papers in the same beaker with 1 L of 5 mM ortho-phosphoric acid (Step D11). D. Let all pieces to air dry without touching each other."
