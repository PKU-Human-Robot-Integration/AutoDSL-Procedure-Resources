    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFasting of mice\nTiming: 1 h\n      This section details how to fast mice prior to glucose uptake assessment\n      to reduce variability in blood glucose levels.\n    \nPrepare 5–10, 8-week-old male mice per experimental group.\nNote: All mice should be acclimatized for\n      one week after import into the facility before the experiment.\n    \nNote: Metabolic assays are dependent on\n      the strain, age, sex, diet, and housing (single or group housed)\n      conditions. Keep these parameters the same between experiments.\n    \n        Transfer mice to new cages with clean, non-corn bedding with no food but\n        allow free access to water.\n      \nFast the mice for 1 h.\nIn vivo tissue-specific glucose uptake assay\nTiming: 4 h\n      This step describes the administration of radioactive\n      2-deoxy-D-[1,2–3H]glucose into mice in the presence or absence\n      of insulin, monitoring of blood glucose levels, tissue dissection, and\n      processing of samples to measure tissue-specific glucose uptake.\n    \nWeigh mice and calculate the injection volume.\n        Administer Solution A: 2-deoxy-D-[1,2–3H]glucose, or\n        Solution B: 2-deoxy-D-[1,2–3H]glucose with insulin by\n        I.P. injection in a total volume of 100–150 μL/mouse.\n      \nNote: When administering the\n      2-deoxy-D-[1,2–3H]glucose solutions, stagger the mice by\n      5–10 minutes to ensure all animals are sacrificed at the same time point\n      after injection.\n    \nNote: Metabolic studies should be\n      performed at the same time of day due to circadian changes in\n      physiological and biochemical parameters.\n    \n        After 30 min, clean the tail with an ethanol wipe. Nick the tail vein\n        with a razor blade. Use a glucometer to measure blood glucose.\n      \nCritical: Do not omit the plasma blood\n      glucose measurements as those serve as controls that insulin has been\n      administered accurately. Typically, an insulin dose of 0.5–1 U/kg in lean,\n      male C57BL/6J mice will reduce blood glucose levels by 50% from baseline\n      after 15–30 minutes.\n    \n        30 min after the 2-deoxy-D-[1,2–3H]glucose injection,",
    "sacrifice animals and collect tissues in clean weighing boats.\n      \nCritical: Always collect the tissues\n      in the same order to avoid variability between animals and experiments.\n    \nWeigh and record the wet tissue mass using an analytical balance.\nPause point: The protocol can be\n      paused after step 8 and tissues can be stored in −80°C for up to 2 weeks.\n    \nTransfer each tissue to a clean 2 mL snap cap tube.\n        Using a handheld homogenizer, homogenize each tissue in 300 μL 1% SDS\n        for 1–2 min using a handheld homogenizer at room temperature\n        (20°C–22°C).\n      \nOptional: Tissues can also be\n      homogenized using a beadrupter. If so, replace snapcap tubes with O-ring\n      tubes. Using radioactive materials in a beadruptor requires additional\n      approvals. Consult institutional guidelines for radioactive materials\n      before using a beadruptor.\n    \n        Add the homogenized tissues to scintillation vials with 3.5 mL of Ultima\n        Gold Scintillation Fluid. Cap the tubes and invert to mix.\n      \n        Read samples on a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, LS6500) at\n        1 min per sample measuring 3H activity in counts per minute\n        (CPM).\n      \nOptional: 3H activity can\n      also be measured at 5 minutes per sample.\n    \n        Calculate CPM/mg wet weight by dividing the CPM with the wet weight of\n        each sample.\n      \n        Depending on the need, measurements from tissues from the left and right\n        side can be averaged upon data analysis."
