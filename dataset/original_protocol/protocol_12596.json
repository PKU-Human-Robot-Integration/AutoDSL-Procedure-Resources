    "1. Probe design\nGenerate the secondary structure of the lncRNA using a specialized free web server software : RNAstructure software7 or Vienna RNA web suite8. Select regions that display a low probability of internal base pairing and design 25 bases long antisense oligonucleotide probes for different regions of this lncRNA.\nCheck all the oligonucleotides designed with the free academic software, AmplifX (https://inp.univ-amu.fr/en/amplifx-manage-test-and-design-your-primers-for-pcr), in order to obtain different information on these probes and to choose those with the best parameters.\n\tNOTE: Check for optimal parameters on the software as following. Percentage of GC: between 40 and 60%, 3' stability, complexity, self-end dimer: \"good\". Melting temperature (TM) is not important because the affinity is performed at room temperature.\nUsing an alignment search tool (i.e., Blast, etc.), ensure that the selected antisense oligonucleotide probes do not recognize nucleotide sequences in any other RNA expressed in the cells of choice.\n\t\nDesign a 25 bases long non-specific DNA oligonucleotide probe. Ensure this probe neither shows an affinity for the lncRNA of interest nor any other RNA sequences in the genome of interest.\nOrder all probes with a biotin modification added to their 3'-end along with a triethyleneglycerol spacer (TEG). This spacer increases the oligo-biotin distance in order to avoid steric hindrance.\n\t​NOTE: To obtain an optimal result and assess the specificity of results of the pull-down, design a minimum of two different antisense oligonucleotide probes in the same region and then compare their efficiency experimentally.\n2. Cross-linking\nGrow cells (e.g., GH4C1 cells used in this experiment) until confluence in 78.5 cm2 cell culture dishes. After removing the cell culture medium, rinse the cell layer with 5 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline enriched with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS+) and add 3 mL of psoralen-derived molecule (4′Aminomethyltrioxsalen hydrochloride) solution prepared in PBS+ at 0.1 mg/mL concentration.",
    "Place the culture plate for 30 min in a mammalian cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 30 min, remove the lid, place culture dishes on ice at 2.5 cm away from 365 nm UV tubes in an UV crosslinker for 10 min. Agitate the dishes delicately and restore the UV exposure for an additional 10 min period.\nDiscard media by aspiration, add 1 mL of PBS+ to collect cells with a cell scraper, and transfer to a micro-tube. Centrifuge at 4 °C, 400 x g for 5 min. Remove as much supernatant as possible and stock pellets at -80 °C.\n3. Cell lysis\nPrepare Proteinase K buffer by adding 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS and 5 µL/mL RNase inhibitor.\nResuspend the cell pellets in this buffer (approximately 200 µL per 1 x 107 cells). Add proteinase K to a final concentration of 0.1 µg/µL and incubate for 45 min at 50 °C. Then incubate for 10 min at 95 °C, to inactivate the proteinase K.\n4. Sonication\nDistribute 100 µL of this lysate (corresponding to 5.106 cells) in two micro-tubes and add 200 µL of hybridization buffer (700 mM NaCl, 70 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1.25% SDS, 5 µL/mL RNase inhibitor solution and 15% formamide) in each tube.\nPlace the tubes in the 4 °C water bath of a sonicator and start the sonication with 2 series of 30 s pulses (high intensity) separated by 30 s off.\nCollect 20 µL of samples to serve as input control samples and store at -80 °C.",
    "​NOTE: This sonication procedure was previously optimized for the GH4C1 cell line in order to obtain RNA fragments ranging in 2,000 nucleotides9. For others cell lines, the sonication procedure must be optimized. When this technique is performed to study the RNA partners of a very long non-coding RNA, the sonication step proves to be indispensable to obtain an adequate recovery of the lncRNA. In this case, it is, therefore, necessary to design several probes with a binding site located every 4,000 nucleotides maximum along the lncRNA length. To recover the full length of the lncRNA, use a pool of several specific probes. However, if the purpose is to identify the regions of the lncRNA involved in RNA-RNA binding, the specific probes must be used separately. Furthermore, if studying RNA partners of a smaller lncRNA, experiments should be performed to determine if the sonication step is required.\n5. RNA pull-down\nDay 1 - Hybridization step\n\t\nAdd 150 pmol (1.5 µL of a 100 µM stock solution) of a biotinylated specific or non-specific probe to each sample tube. Incubate for 4 h under agitation on a tube rotator at room temperature (RT) (approximately 30 rpm).\nTake the necessary volume of magnetic beads (i.e., 40 µL of beads per 150 pmol of probes hybridization reaction). Use magnet support to separate beads from commercial media. Discard the supernatant and wash the beads with 900 µL of the Hybridization buffer. Once done, resuspended the magnetic beads in the same volume of the Hybridization buffer.\nAdd magnetic beads in each sample tube (40 µL of beads per 150 pmol of probes hybridization reaction). Incubate overnight under agitation on a tube rotator at RT (approximately 30 rpm).\nDay 2 - RNA isolation step",
    "Separate beads from the cell lysate using magnet support (2-3 min). Discard the supernatant and wash the beads with 900 µL of the Wash buffer (0.5% SDS, 2x SSC) with 5 min incubation under agitation on the rotator at RT. Repeat this wash 5 times.\nAfter removing the last wash, add 95 µL of Proteinase K buffer on the beads. Defrost the input samples and add 75 µL of Proteinase K buffer. Add 5 µL of proteinase K to a final concentration of 1 µg/µL in all tubes (samples and input samples). Incubate at 45 °C for 45 min and then at 95 °C for 10 min.\nKeep the sample on ice. Use magnetic support to separate beads from RNAs present in the supernatant. Purify RNAs with an RNA purification kit that includes a DNase digestion step. Store purified RNAs at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Eluted RNA can be subjected to RT-qPCR or high throughput RNA sequencing to detect enriched transcripts. For RNA sequencing analysis, the reads can then be aligned to the genome of interest using free software, such as STAR10 or HISAT211, and the quantification can be done using FeatureCounts12 or HTSeq count13.\nSubscription Required.
