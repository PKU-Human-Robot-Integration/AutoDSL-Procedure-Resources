    "Co-transfection of TALEN and EGFP plasmids into Huh7.5 cellsPlate Huh7.5 cells onto 100 mm cell culture plates in 15 ml 10% DMEM culture media without antibiotics 18-24 h before transfection such that the cells will be ~60-70% confluent at the time of transfection. Scale up and down the culture according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the cell type used. Combine 8 µg of the right TALEN, 8 µg of the left TALEN and 8 µg of EGFP plasmid in 1.5 ml Opti-MEM medium. Mix gently. Prepare separate tubes for controls, such as mock transfection, which controls for potential side effects of the transfection reagent (only to be included in step A).In a separate tube, add 60 µl Lipofectamine 2000 to 1.5 ml Opti-MEM medium for each sample. Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add the DNA-Opti-MEM solution (from step A2) to the Lipofectamine-Opti-MEM solution (from step A3). Thoroughly mix the solution by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. Add 1.5 ml of the DNA-lipid complex to the cells drop-wise and gently rock the plate back and forth to evenly distribute the complexes. (Optional) ~6 h later, replace the media with fresh 10% DMEM culture media. Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h. Approximate transfection efficiency by measuring the number of GFP positive cells using a fluorescence microscope.Enriching for GFP positive cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h post-transfection, wash cells with 1x PBS, then trypsinize cells and pipette up and down forcefully to break up cell aggregates.Add 10% DMEM culture media to inactivate trypsin. Centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in FACS buffer (see Recipes) at a concentration of 10 x 106 cells/ml.",
    "Pipette up and down thoroughly to attain single cell suspensions. Place a cell strainer over a FACS tube (sterilized in ethanol) and carefully pipet the cells through the filter into the tube to remove cell clumps. Cells should be sorted immediately or placed on ice and covered until ready to be sorted.Sort the GFP positive cells into 20% DMEM culture media using the FACSAria cell sorter. Cell viability is typically diminished following transfection and sorting. Thus, the sorted cells should be seeded at a fairly high cell density in fresh 20% DMEM culture media and allowed to recover for ~1 week. Replace the media every 3-4 days during this recovery time.Note: If cells fail to recover, repeat the experiment starting with a larger cell number.Generation of single-cell clones by serial dilution onto 96 well platesOnce the cells have recovered, add 100 µl of 20% DMEM culture media to all but the first well, A1, of a 96 well plate. Suspend sorted cells at a concentration of 1 x 104 cells/ml. Add 200 µl of sorted cell suspension to well A1, then transfer 100 µl to well B1, and so on, until all the wells in the first column contain cells. Discard 100 µl from H1, and then add 100 µl of media to wells A1-H1 for a final volume of 200 µl. Using a multi-channel pipette, transfer 100 µl from the first column to the second column and repeat for all columns. Bring the final volume of all wells to 200 µl. Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in 20% DMEM culture media. Analyze the wells daily marking those that contain a single cell. Close monitoring and stringency is crucial at this step for obtaining single-cell clones.",
    "Allow single-cell clones to become confluent in 96 well plates, then gently trypsinize and transfer to 48 well plates. Repeat this process so that the cells are slowly expanded to larger surface areas to promote cell growth (e.g. transfer from 96 well to 48 well to 24 well to 12 well to 6 well plates).Analyze protein expression by Western blotting to identify single-cell clones with gene knockoutIn 12 well plates, wash cells with 1x PBS then collect cells by trypsinization. Add 10% DMEM culture media to inactivate trypsin.Centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 10 min.Aspirate supernatant and lyse the cells with 2x SDS loading buffer (see Recipes) to extract protein.Immediately boil samples at 100 °C for 10 min using a hotplate, then centrifuge at max speed for 1 min. Samples can be stored at -20 °C. Analyze protein expression via Western blotting (Figure 1A).Confirm gene knockout by DNA sequence analysisExtract DNA using QuickExtract DNA solution per the manufacturer’s protocol.Perform PCR with genomic primers flanking the TALEN target site. Analyze the PCR products by gel electrophoresis.Isolate and purify DNA using the Qiagen gel extraction kit per the manufacturer’s protocol.Sequence DNA to confirm the presence of TALEN-induced indels that result in the loss of gene expression (Figure 1B)."
