  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All steps of the procedure should be conducted at room temperature (RT).\nCAUTION: Deposit all media containing pathogenic microbes, as well as the plants and plant tissue used in the assay, into the appropriate waste containers and autoclave before discarding.\n1. Preparation of plasmid constructs containing putative effectors\nSelect putative secreted effectors that are highly expressed during infection, as determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and further by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) technique.\nDetermine the signal peptide cleavage site of each effector using a software tool such as SignalP18.\nDesign primers and perform PCR to amplify the gene encoding the effector of interest using high fidelity DNA polymerase. Perform agarose gel electrophoresis to check the PCR product, then clone the amplicon into Gateway entry vector pQBV3 using the ligation-free cloning kit (Table of Materials), and subsequently into the destination expression vector pEG100 using the LR recombination reaction19.\nTransform 3−5 µL of LR reaction mixture into 100 µL of competent E. coli cells (e.g., TOP10, DH5α), spread the transformed bacterial cells on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin, and incubate at 37 °C for 16−20 h.\n\tNOTE: Positive transformants can be identified by colony PCR20 and further analyzed by plasmid miniprep and sequencing.\nIntroduce 50−100 ng of recombinant plasmids carrying effector protein into 100 µL of chemically competent A. tumefaciens cells (e.g., GV3101 or C58C1), mix gently, and then freeze in liquid nitrogen for 1 min. Thaw the cells in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.\nAdd 500 µL of LB broth and incubate at 30 °C for 4−6 h with gentle shaking, and then transfer and spread all the agrobacteria cells on LB agar medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and 50 µg/mL rifampicin at 30 °C for 2 days.",
    "NOTE: Positive clones can be verified by colony PCR.\nUse a single transformed colony for agro-infiltration experiments unless otherwise directed.\n\tNOTE: In the present research, none of the tested effector genes contained predicted introns; each of the genes was directly amplified from genomic DNA of a Phytophthora sojae isolate. A Gateway plant expression vector without any tag is recommended, but not necessary.\n2. Preparation of N. benthamiana 16c plants\nPrepare potting soil mixes consisting of (by volume) 50% peat moss, 30% perlite, and 20% vermiculite, and autoclave at 120 °C for 20 min.\nSoak autoclaved soil mixes with plant fertilizer solution (1 g/L) and sub-package them into smaller pots (80 mm x 80 mm x 75 mm) stored in a larger tray (540 mm x 285 mm x 60 mm).\nSow one or two seeds of N. benthamiana 16c onto the soil surface of each pot. Cover the tray with a plastic dome and allow seeds to germinate.\nPlace the tray under light and temperature-controlled growth chambers with a temperature of 23−25 °C, 50−60% relative humidity, and a long-day photoperiod (14 h light/10 h dark, with illumination at 130−150 µE·m-2s-1).\nTake the plastic dome off after the seeds germinate (3−4 days) and allow the seedlings to grow under the same conditions used for the germination step.\nAdd an appropriate amount of water, keeping soil moist but not soaking, every 2−3 days; add fertilizer every 10 days to promote further growth. Maintain N. benthamiana 16c plants under normal conditions until they are ready for use; at this stage the plant should have at least five fully developed true leaves and no visible axillary or flower buds, and the leaves should have a healthy green appearance).",
    "Use 3−4 week-old leaves of N. benthamiana 16c for local RNA silencing assays, and young N. benthamiana 16c plants (10−14 days old) for systemic RNA silencing assays.\n\tNOTE: Plant growth conditions and facilities vary across laboratories; choose healthy, well-developed and fully expanded leaves for infiltration.\n3. Preparation of Agrobacterium culture for infiltration\nPick a positive colony from the LB plate and inoculate the cells into glass tube containing 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and 50 µg/mL rifampicin. Grow the cells at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 24−48 h.\nTransfer 100 µL of culture into 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with same antibiotics, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES; pH 5.6) and 20 µM acetosyringone (AS). Grow bacteria at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 16−20 h.\nCentrifuge cells at 4,000 x g for 10 min. Pour off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of 10 mM MgCl2 buffer.\nRepeat step 3.3 to ensure the complete removal of antibiotics.\nDetermine the density of the Agrobacterium culture by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). Adjust to an OD600 of 1.5−2.0 with 10 mM MgCl2 buffer.\nAdd 10 mM MES (pH 5.6) and 150 µM AS to the final suspension cultures and incubate the cells at RT for at least 3 h without shaking.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave the final suspension cultures overnight.\n4. Co-infiltration N. benthamiana leaves\nMix equal volumes of an Agrobacterium culture containing 35S-GFP with an Agrobacterium culture containing 35S- cucumber mosaic virus suppressor 2b (CMV2b), putative effector, or empty vector (EV).\nCarefully and slowly infiltrate the mixed agrobacterium suspensions on the abaxial sides of N. benthamiana 16c leaves using a 1 mL needleless syringe.",
    "Remove the remaining bacterial suspension from the leaves with soft tissue wipers and circle the margins of the infiltrated patches with a maker pen.\nLeave the infiltrated plants in the growth chamber under the same growth conditions.\n\tNOTE: For safety and health reasons, protective eye goggles and a mask should be worn during infiltration. To prevent cross-contamination, gloves should be changed or sterilized with ethanol between infiltrations. Normally at least 1 mL of agrobacterium suspensions per leaf is needed for infiltration. For systemic silencing, at least two leaves will be required for infiltration.\n5. GFP imaging analysis\nVisually detect GFP fluorescence in newly grown leaves of whole plants 2 weeks post-infiltration (for systemic RNA silencing) or infiltrated patches of leaves 3−4 dpi using a long-wave ultraviolet (UV) lamp without leaves collection.\nPhotograph collected plants and/or detached leaves with a digital camera fitted with both UV and yellow filters.\n\tNOTE: For assays of local silencing suppression, investigate infiltrated patches of N. benthamiana 16c leaves, whereas for systemic silencing suppression activity, investigate newly grown leaves. RNA silencing suppression activity may vary across individual effectors. Therefore, observe the patches or leaves over a few days starting at 3 dpi. Use CMV2b and EV as positive and negative controls, respectively.\n6. Northern blot analysis of GFP mRNA levels in infiltrated leaves\nIsolation of total RNA from leaf tissue using the RNA isolation reagent (Table of Materials)\n\t\nCollect leaf tissues from infiltrated N. benthamiana 16c patches at 4−7 dpi, pulverize in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder, and transfer the powder to a sterile 2 mL tube.\nAdd the RNA isolation reagent (1 mL/100 mg tissue) immediately to the sampled tube in a hood, shake vigorously to homogenate, and incubate at RT for 5 min.",
    "Add chloroform (200 µL/1 mL RNA isolation reagent) to each tube in a hood, shake vigorously for 15 s, and incubate at RT for 5 min. Centrifuge the homogenate at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new RNase-free tube and discard the pellet. Add 0.7 volume of isopropanol to the supernatant, gently invert several times, and incubate the mixture at RT for 10 min.\nPrecipitate the RNA pellet by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant, wash the pellet with 70% ethanol, and air-dry the pellet in a hood. Dissolve the RNA in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water by incubating in a 65 °C water bath for 10−20 min.\nNorthern blot analysis of GFP mRNA level in the infiltrated leaves\n\t\nPrepare a 1.2% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel in 1x MOPS running buffer.\nMix RNA 1:1 with RNA loading dye and denature by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min, immediately chill the denatured samples on ice for 1 min.\nLoad the samples on the gel and electrophorese at 100 V for 50 min until the RNA is well separated.\nRinse the gel in 20x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer to remove formaldehyde and transfer the gel to nylon membrane by capillary transfer in 20x SSC buffer overnight. Soak the membrane in 2x SSC and fix the RNA to the membrane by exposing the wet membrane to UV cross linking.\nAdd the appropriate amount of hybridization buffer (10 mL per 100 cm2 membrane; Table of Materials) in a hybridization tube and agitate at 60 °C in a hybridization oven.",
    "Put the membrane into the hybridization tube and incubate for 60 min at 60 °C. Dilute a 5'DIG-labeled DNA probe (final concentration, 50 ng/mL) into the hybridization solution containing prewarmed hybridization buffer.\nDiscard the prehybridization buffer and immediately replace with prewarmed hybridization solution containing the DIG-labeled probe. Incubate the blot with probe at 60 °C overnight, with gentle agitation.\nAfter hybridization, wash the membrane twice in buffers of increasing stringency at 60 °C for 20 min each. Gently wipe the membrane to remove extra washing buffer and add reagents as suggested in the chemiluminescent hybridization and detection kit (Table of Materials).\nDetect hybridized signals by chemiluminescent reaction combined with the imaging system.\nSubscription Required.
