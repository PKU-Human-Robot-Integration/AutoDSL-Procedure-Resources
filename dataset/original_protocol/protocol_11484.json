    "The animal experiments presented here were independently reviewed and permitted by an institutional and a governmental Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted according to Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) guidelines. All possible measures were taken to minimize suffering including anesthesia and analgesia or, if necessary, premature euthanasia.\n1. Preparation of Cells and Organoids\nNOTE: Use a volume of 20 µL with 100,000 cells for each injection. Use basement membrane matrix (BMM) in order to prevent leakage and ensure standardized injection. In order to ensure reproducible results, conduct cell line authentication assays (e.g., via STR profiling) at regular intervals.\nPreparation of primary cell suspensions from fresh tissue\n\tNOTE: Always work under sterile conditions. Immediate transfer of the freshly resected tissue from the operating room to the laboratory on ice is required to ensure high viability of the cells.\n\tThe patient's well-being and optimal treatment must always be the first priority. Therefore, tissue samples for research must be obtained in a manner that does not interfere with the subsequent pathological work-up and staging of the resected tumor. In most cases, it is therefore reasonable to have the samples for research obtained by a trained pathologist in order to ensure non-interference with the pathological diagnosis.\n\t\nImmediately after sterile removal from the resected specimen (ideally ~1 cm3), place the tissue sample in a 50 mL tube pre-filled with 20-30 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Store the tube on ice and transfer to the laboratory immediately.\nPut the tissue in a Petri dish and wash it twice with plenty of PBS to remove the remaining blood.\nCut the tissue into small pieces (~ 2-4 mm) with a scalpel (e.g., with a #20 or #36 blade).",
    "Use the dissociator according to the manufacturer's instructions in order to further dissociate the tumor tissue to a single-cell suspension. Alternatively, use other protocols of enzymatic tumor digestion.\nCount the cells of the resulting single-cell suspension (e.g., in a coulter counter or a hemocytometer).\nCentrifuge (5 min at 1,500 x g) and wash the cell suspension twice with PBS.\nResuspend the cells in BMM at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL and keep them on ice.\nPreparation of cell lines for injection\nGrow all colorectal cancer cell lines under standard culturing conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) and prepare them at the day of surgery.\nHarvest the cells according to standard cell culture protocols, count the cells (e.g., in a coulter counter or a hemocytometer) and calculate the required amount for all injections depending on the numbers of animals to be injected.\nPrepare 3-5x of the actually needed volume to account for pipetting losses and the dead volume of the injection syringe.\nCentrifuge (5 min at 1,500 g) and wash the cell suspension twice with PBS.\nResuspend the cells in BMM at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL and keep them on ice.\nOrganoid preparation\n\tNOTE: All 3D organoid cultures are grown under standard culturing conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). Detailed protocols for organoid culture have been published before.18,19,20 Similar to conventional cell lines, we recommend a volume of 20 µL BMM with 100,000 cells per injection. The organoids are prepared at the day of surgery as follows:\n\t\nPrepare the following medium (in the following referred to as DMEM/F12+++): Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 + 1% HEPES (1M) + 1% Glutamine (200 mM) + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nPre-fill 15 mL tubes with 1 mL DMEM/F12+++.",
    "Carefully aspirate the organoids from the surface of the culture plate and transfer the contents of 3 to 5 wells into one 15 mL tube.\nCarefully break the organoids up into smaller pieces by pipetting them up and down with an extended glass pipette.\nAdd 5 mL DMEM/F12+++ to the tube, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 600 µL enzymatic dissociation buffer and transfer the suspension to one well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1-5 min and then carefully pipet the suspension up and down in order to dissolve the organoids.\n\t\tNOTE: Verify the digestion via microscope; it is complete when all cell clusters have been dissociated to single cells.\nUpon successful digestion, add 1.4 mL of DMEM/F12+++ to stop the digestion. Then transfer all wells of digested organoids to a 50 mL tube.\nCount the cells and calculate the required amount for all injections.\nPrepare 3 - 5x of the actually needed volume to account for pipetting losses and the dead volume of the injection syringe\nCentrifuge (5 min at 1,500 x g) and wash the cell suspension twice with PBS.\nResuspended the cells in BMM to a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL and keep them on ice.\n2. Orthotopic Mouse Model\nPreparation of recipient animals for surgery\n\tNOTE: Use 6-8 week-old NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NOD scid gamma, NSG) mice as recipients.21 NSG are among the most immunocompromised mice, lacking mature B, T and NK cells along with multiple other immune defects.21 They reliably grow tumors even if low cell numbers are injected and are highly prone to distant metastases. NSG mice are excellent breeders and can be kept in conventional specific pathogen free (SPF) units.",
    "Prior to the first incision, inject 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously.\nUse sevoflurane at 3-3.5 vol% for general anesthesia. A loss of the toe pinch reflex indicates sufficient anesthesia.\nCover the eyes of the anesthetized mice with ophthalmic ointment to avoid desiccation of the cornea.\nRestrain the mice in a supine position on a small table.\nShave the abdomen with an electric shaver (depilatory cream can be used alternatively) and disinfect with at least 3 times clorhexidine/iodine and 70% alcohol alternatively.\nCover the surgical field with sterile drapes.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of perioperative antibiotics is optional and subject to institutional guidelines.\nMidline laparotomy and exposure of the cecum\nUse scissors (scalpels can be used alternatively) to make a small midline incision (3 - 5 mm) of the skin on the lower abdomen. Pick up the abdominal wall musculature with forceps and carefully incise it with scissors, thus opening the abdominal cavity.\nIdentify and carefully exteriorize the cecum with atraumatic forceps. Position the blind ending pouch of the cecum on the abdomen pointing cranially.\nOnce exteriorized, keep the cecum moist using warm saline swabs at all times.\nOrthotopic injection, closure of the abdomen and postoperative recovery\nFor intracecal injection, use a standard 1 mL syringe with a 30 G cannula. Mount this syringe on a microinjection pump, which is in turn mounted on a micromanipulator.\nCarefully grasp the tip of the cecum with atraumatic forceps and gently smoothen it by stroking it downward with a second set of forceps moistened with warm saline.\nPosition the cannula directly above the cecum.\nPerform the following steps under visual control with a binocular surgical microscope.",
    "Carefully grasp the cecum with two atraumatic forceps at both ends of the exteriorized part of the cecum, slightly stretch it and then slowly pull it over the cannula which is positioned parallel and directly above. It is crucial not to perforate the entire bowel wall (thus injecting the cells into the lumen) as well as not to perforate the serosa beyond the initial point of penetration, as this would lead to leakage and peritoneal dissemination.\n\t\t\nMove the bowel towards the cannula, not the cannula towards the bowel. Hold and stretch the bowel between two forceps. The surgeon's hands must be resting on a surface in order to reduce tremor.\nInject the cells between the serosa (seen as very thin, translucent lining above the intramural blood vessels) and the muscularis. The cannula must therefore be visually placed above the blood vessels and underneath the thin translucent membrane.\nUse a foot switch to start the injection in order to reduce tremor while the cannula is inside the bowel wall.\nOnce the cannula is in position, start the injection. Use a duration of 20 s, resulting in 1 µL/s setting on the control unit of the pump.\n\t\tNOTE: The injection into or near a damaged blood vessel leads to direct intravascular dissemination and distant metastasis and should therefore be avoided.\nAfter completion of the injection, carefully remove the cannula by pulling it backward.\nPlace a dry swab under the cecum, and then thoroughly rinse the cecum with distilled water in order to lyse leaked cells and thus prevent artificial peritoneal dissemination.\nClosure of the abdomen and postoperative recovery\nAfter rinsing, gently return the cecum to the abdominal cavity.\nClose the abdominal wall with 6-0 rapidly absorbable running sutures.\nClose the skin with surgical wound clips.",
    "Place the mouse on a heating map set to 38 °C until it has fully recovered from the anesthesia.\nClosely observe the postoperative condition of the mice for the following 48 h. In case of distress, treat with 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine every 12 h.\nMonitor the mice at least once daily for signs of distress due to tumor growth.\n3. Isolation of Circulating Tumor Cells from Whole Blood Samples\nNOTE: Obtain blood by transcutaneous cardiac puncture on anesthetized mice, followed by euthanasia. Ideally, 1,000 µL of blood are drawn into a syringe prefilled with 100 µL of an anticoagulant (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparin). Use an anti-human-EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) antibody to identify the CTCs. This works very well if human epithelial cell lines are used in the mouse model. For other appliances, different antibodies may be required.\nCTC enrichment:\nPre-fill 15 mL tubes with 5 mL density gradient medium and carefully transfer the blood into the 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge (30 min at 300 x g without brake) and carefully remove the upper supernatant.\nPour the rest into a new 15 mL tube and centrifuge (15 min, 300 x g with brake).\nRecover the interphase containing the mononuclear cells (discard the rest) and wash the cells twice with PBS.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 µL PBS/1% EDTA and add 4 µL of EpCAM antibody. Incubate 20 min on ice in the dark.\nScreening and picking\nPrepare the following buffer (in the following referred to as picking buffer): PBS + 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (1%) + 0.8% EDTA.\nUse a PAP pen to draw a ~1 cm circle in a 6 cm sterile Petri dish (prevents the fluid from dispersing in the dish), and pipet 700 µL of picking buffer into this circle.",
    "Add 50 µL of cell suspension to the 700 µL picking buffer within the circle. Check the density of cells with the microscope. Split the sample into different dishes if it is too dense.\nWait for the cells to settle down (~5 min).\nScreen the drop of cell suspension for stained (= EpCAM-positive) cells.\nOnce a cell is found, pick the cell with the micromanipulator and put it in 50 µL buffer depending on the intended downstream analysis (e.g., RNA extraction buffer or culturing medium).\nDepending on the intended downstream analyses, isolate EpCAM-negative cells and/or medium as negative controls.\nProceed with downstream analyses (e.g., cell culture, PCR).\nSubscription Required.
