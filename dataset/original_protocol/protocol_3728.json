    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCritical: All animal experiments must be performed in accordance with the guidelines of your institution. For each step, the type of drug or anesthetic used should be modified according to the applicable guidelines.\nExpose the skull of the mouse\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section follows previous protocols with partial modifications (Holtmaat et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Goldey et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAnesthetize the adult mouse (over 8 weeks old, regardless of gender) with isoflurane using an inhaled anesthetic (MK-A110D, Muromachi Kikai, Japan).\nNote: For induction of anesthesia, the concentration of isoflurane is 3%. After induction, the mouse is anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane for the remainder of this protocol including the imaging session.\nCritical: Change the concentration of the isoflurane depending on the condition of the animal. For example, the concentration should be decreased if the mouse breathes with large motions.\nWipe the scalp hair with cotton swabs soaked in 70% ethanol.\nApply an eye ointment (Tarivid, Santen Pharmaceutical, Japan) to the eyes to protect against drying.\nRemove the scalp hair (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/653-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Surgical procedures for a large cranial window utilizing the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet\n(A) Remove the hair and clean the scalp. Scale bar: 1 cm.\n(B) Remove the skin.\n(C) Remove the periosteum.\n(D) Fix the head plate with a super-bond.\n(E) Remove the skull leaving the dura intact.\n(F) Place the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet supported by the nonwoven fabric on the brain surface.\n(G) Transfer the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet from the nonwoven fabric to the brain surface. The dotted line indicates the edge of the nanosheet.\n(H) Fix the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet with an ultraviolet curable resin.\nGently shave the hair using a razor blade.",
    "Alternatives: Application of hair-removal cream (Veet hair-removal cream for sensitive skin, Reckitt Benckiser) can be performed instead of shaving with a razor blade.\nClean the remaining hair with cotton swabs soaked in 70% ethanol.\nSet the head in the head holder (SG-4N, Narishige, Japan).\nNote: any stereotaxic frame can be used for this protocol.\nApply local anesthesia (to the skin, e.g., a few drops of xylocaine).\nWait 3 min for induction of local anesthesia.\nCut the skin from the whole dorsal part of the head using scissors. This includes the parietal area as well as the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nApply a few drops of xylocaine to the skull.\nWait 3 min for induction of anesthesia.\nPush away the temporal and occipitalis muscle from the skull using tweezers.\nGently remove the periosteum on the skull surface using a scalpel or cotton swab (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: The periosteum should be removed entirely. To create a large cranial window, the head plate must be strongly fixed. troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nFix the head plate\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to fix the head plate on the skull.\nPlace the head plate parallel to the transverse plane of the skull.\nCritical: If the head plate is non-parallel to the transverse plane of the skull, optical aberrations can occur, which may result in reduced image quality. To avoid this problem, the system reported by Kawakami et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] can be used to adjust the tilt of the head plate. Fix the head plate by applying a dental resin (Super-Bond C&B Bulk-mix, Sun Medical Company, Ltd., Japan) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: Cover the exposed skull entirely with dental resin since the fixation of the head plate is limited to a small area.\nWait 15 min for the dental resin to cure.",
    "Note: Ensure the head plate is firmly fixed to avoid the head plate detaching from the brain during imaging. troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nRemove the skull\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes how to expose the brain surface to create a large cranial window.\nAdminister the GLYCEOL Injection (15 μL pe (15 μL per body weight (μL/g)) by intraperitoneal injection to reduce the brain tissue's intracranial pressure.\nNote: This process makes it easier to remove the skull because the reduction in intracranial pressure increases the volume between the brain tissue and the skull.\nAlternatives: 20% mannitol solution (15 μL per body weight (μL/g)) can be used instead of GLYCEOL Injection.\nDrill the skull to make the groove around the intentional craniotomy area using a drill bit (#140 ϕ1.4, Minitor, Japan). The skull should be drilled and thinned until the bone thickness can be easily pushed down by low pressure using the tweezers.\nCritical: After the begging of drilling, do not press the groove strongly with the drill bit vertical to the skull, as this can injure the brain tissue. Instead, move the drill bit in a circle along the edge of the intentional craniotomy area in a position horizontal to the skull, like scratching.\nNote: The size of the window can be preferably defined. Unlike a glass coverslip, the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet can be easily cut to any size.\nNote: Bone debris should be cleared away using a cotton swab or air.\nRemove the skull (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nSoak the groove of the skull made by drilling with saline.\nInsert the tweezers between the skull and the brain surface and gently remove the skull, leaving the dura intact.",
    "Note: The dura is sometimes stripped when the skull is removed. By reducing the intracranial pressure (step 15), the dura can be easily peeled from the skull.\nCritical: Keep the tweezers as parallel as possible to avoid injuring the dura and the brain tissue.\nCritical: Lifting the bone too quickly can tear the skull-connected blood vessels, which will severely injure the sagittal sinus. Therefore, it is important to slowly remove the skull while it is soaking in saline. troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nStop the bleeding using a sponge hemostat (Spongel) soaked in saline.\nCritical: During this surgery, bleeding from the sagittal sinus is inevitable because the skull covering the sinus must be removed. However, a Spongel will stop the bleeding unless the blood vessels have been severely injured. troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nSealing the brain surface with a PEO-CYTOP nanosheet\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis step describes how to seal the brain surface with PEO-CYTOP nanosheet.\nUse scissors to cut the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet and the nonwoven fabric to a size suitable for covering the exposed region of the brain.\nCritical: The cut piece should be slightly larger than the exposed brain area to allow the edges of the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet to be glued. It is not necessary to cut the nanosheet to a strictly defined size, because the size of the nanosheet can be adjusted after attachment if it is larger than the exposed region of the brain.\nSeal the brain surface with the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAdd a few drops of saline to the brain surface. Remove any excess water and slightly dry the surface using a paper towel or a suction pump (SP30, MARKOS MEFAR, Italy).",
    "Critical: Do not dry the brain surface completely. A wet surface is necessary for the successful attachment of the nanosheet. The wetting procedure is required to transfer the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet to the brain surface because of its hydrophilic adhesive surface. However, nanosheet transfer cannot be achieved if the brain surface is too wet. troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nPlace the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet on the brain with the hydrophilic side to the brain surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). The hydrophilic surface enhances the strength of the adhesion to the surface of the mouse brain, resulting in the suppression of bleeding from the brain surface.\nAttach the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet to the brain surface by gently pushing it via the nonwoven fabric with the tweezers.\nCritical: Do not push the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet too firmly, as this can cause injury and bleeding.\nAfter transferring the nanosheet, peel the nonwoven fabric away using the tweezers.\nCritical: The PEO-CYTOP nanosheet can be peeled off by applying saline to the brain surface. To redo the transfer, remove the already transferred nanosheet and then return to step 19.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Transferring the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet to the brain surface, related to step 20\nAdjust the area of the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet covering the skull by scratching the area with tweezers. Keep the edge of the nanosheet approximately 0.5 - 1 mm away from the exposed brain area so there is sufficient area to glue the nanosheet.\nNote: Do not reduce the area of the PEO-CYTOP nanosheet covering the skull too much, as the resin should not make direct contact with the exposed brain.\nFix PEO-CYTOP nanosheet by gluing its edges to the head plate (the surface covered with dental resin) using ultraviolet curable resin (Ionosit baseliner, DMG, Germany) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).",
    "Critical: The brain surface may swell because the intracranial pressure is too high. Prior to fixation, the intracranial pressure can be reduced by administrating GLYCEOL Injection (5 μL per body weight (μL/g)) via intraperitoneal injection. troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9].\nPost-surgery care for the imaging session\nTiming: 5–10 min\nFix the mouse to the stage with a heating pad (Lotte, Japan) to maintain the body temperature during the imaging session.\nKeep the mouse anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane during the imaging session to reduce body movement."
