    "The Ethical Committee of the University of Lausanne approved the experiments, which are in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 1983 for the use of human tissues.\n1. Human Great Saphenous Vein Harvest\nObtain surplus segments of non-varicose human saphenous veins from patients undergoing lower limb bypass surgery for ischemia. In the operating room, disinfect the entire leg with an iodine solution and drape the patient to expose the leg from the groin to the foot.\nMake a median incision from the groin to the knee (leaving the interrupted skin portion).\nHarvest the great saphenous vein with a pedicle of surrounding tissue (no-touch technique). Secure side branches of the veins with 4-0 silk ties. Immediately store a minimum of 9 cm long surplus segment of the greater saphenous vein, with an external diameter of 2.5-4 mm at 4 °C in a RPMI-1640 Glutamax medium, supplemented with 12.5% fetal calf serum and bring it to the laboratory.\n2. EVPS Design\nAssemble the general equipment shown in Figure 1. Autoclave all equipment and keep all components under sterile conditions. In addition, ensure that the system is waterproof and does not leak chemicals into the medium. Use polymethacrylate methyl (PMMA-GS) for the cover. Steel (X5 Cr Ni 18 10) and polyoxymethylene plastic (POM) as the vein support.\nDesign the perfusion chamber to the desired geometry to allow the placement of the vein and its connection. Make sure the depth (or radius if using cylindrical construction) is at least 2.5 cm so it allows minimal flexion and dilatation of the vessel along with constant coverage by the culture media (Figure 1). Sealing is a major issue and is the reason rectangular PMMA-GS construction is used.",
    "Design the vein support to the desired geometry. To avoid vein kinking or over distension, allow length adjustment by pushing or pulling (screw cannot be used to that purpose, as the vein would be twisted along with the screw).\n\tNOTE: A full steel rod connected by 2 sliding L-shaped pieces that support the 2 vein cylinders (5 mm diameter to fit the vessel) and the vein (Figure 1B and Figure 2) is used here.\nDesign the pressure column, such that the “resting pressure” applied to the system is: p = 0-10 = h x ρ x g, where p = pressure (N/m2, Pa) h = height of fluid column (m) ρ = density of liquid (kg/m3) and g = the gravitational constant (9.81 m/sec2). Design four connection ducts, from top to bottom: to apply pressure, for the outflow (from the vein), the inflow (to the vein) and to allow medium change.\nPrepare the medium. Based on previous studies5,11-14, choose RPMI-1640, supplemented with Glutamax, 12.5% fetal calf serum, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (10,000 U/ml penicillin G, plus 10 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, plus 25 mg/ml amphotericin B, plus 0.5 μg/ml: gentamycin). Shear stress (SS) is given by SS= 4 μQ/π*r3Q is the flow rate (ml/sec), r the radius (cm) of the vein segment, and μ is the viscosity of the perfusion medium.\n\t\nModulate SS by adjusting the viscosity through addition of 70 kDa dextran. Measure the viscosity with a viscometer. Here, add 8% 70 kDa dextran to set SS to 9-15 dyn/cm2.",
    "Set the gearing pump to induce a pulsatile cardioid signal of 60 pulses/min and constant amplitude generating a unidirectional flow of 150 ± 15 ml/min, independent from the pressure applied in the system and controlled by a computer. Ensure that the driving software integrates constant acquisition and monitoring of pressures, flow velocity, pulse rate, and signal. If desired, use a second pump (non synchronized) to produce a non-laminar, turbulent flow.\n3. EVPS Assembly (Figure 1)\nBefore starting, make sure all the equipment is sterile. Perform all the following steps under asepsis in a laminar flow hood.\nPlace the vein in a Petri dish filled with medium. Use a surgical blade and divide the vein into 3 equal segments.\nImmediately rinse one segment in PBS. Divide the segment in 3 parts, fix one in formalin for morphometry. Freeze the other two for quantitative transcript (RT-PCR) and protein (western blot) analysis. Consider these segments as a control, non-perfused vein.\nUse the 2 remaining segments for perfusion.\n\t\nVery gently inject medium into the vein and determine the normal flow direction; in presence of valves the vein is reversed.\nSealing the veins is of utmost importance to experimental success. Check for leaks through collaterals. Secure any leaks with 6-0 silk sutures.\nConnect the vein segment between the two metallic cylinders, one end at a time (2.3, Figure 1). Secure the cylinders with Ethibon 3-0 around the indentations (Figure 1A and B).\n\t\nPlace the entire venous segment into the perfusion chamber previously filled with medium. Repeat the same procedure for the second segment.\n\t\tNOTE: Failure to properly seal the vein to the cylinder will be a source of leak, require reintervention, and significantly increase the risk of infection and experimental failure.",
    "To reinforce (mesh) the second segment, release the two cylinders (with the vein attached) from the L-shaped pieces (2.3 and Figure 1).\n\t\nBe gentle and do not touch the vein with any instruments. Slide the mesh first on the cylinder then onto the vein. A push/pull jostling will get the mesh on the vein.\nOnce the mesh covers the entire surface of the vein secure the jacketed vein to the cylinders with Ethibon 3-0.\nReassemble the vein/cylinder compound to the L-shaped support and transfer it to the perfusion chamber, previously filled with medium.\nConnect each metallic cylinder (in-and outflow) to a Y-splitter using peroxide-treated silicone tubing with an internal diameter of 3.2 mm.\nConnect the outflow splitter to a second Y-splitter using the same type of tubing. From this Y-splitter, use one tube to measure the perfusion pressure through both vessels. Connect the other one back to the column to form a closed loop system (Figure 2).\nInside the incubator, use a long (one-meter length) tube to connect the pressure column to the pump head.\nComplete the set up by connecting the pump head to the inflow Y-splitter with another long length tube (Figure 1).\n4. Veins Perfusion\nAfter the EVPS assembly has been completed, fill the column with medium (stay below the vein outflow duct to allow refilling). Add more medium into the column until the system is full. Move all the system into the incubator maintained at 37 ± 0.1 °C with a pH kept constant at 7.40 ± 0.01 (using a CO2/pH algorithm based on the Henderson-Hasselbach equation).\nBring the gear pump head outside the incubator and connect it to the gear pump drive. Screw the rods to secure the assembly.",
    "Switch on the pump power, make sure it is activated on the driving software and allow 5 min for the medium to be equally distributed in every compartment.\nTo monitor the pressure, use an arterial line monitoring. Connect the EVPS pressure output (it corresponds to the arterial catheter) to the pressure transducer linked to the computer.\n\t\nMake sure the tube is entirely filled with medium and does not contain any bubbles. De-bubble the culture system through the “arterial line” tube (Figure 2). Pay attention to the display and look for a pulsatile cardioid signal of 60 pulses/min of constant amplitude. At this point, the average pressure is between 0-10 mm Hg. If the pressure is < 0 and the column progressively empties look for a leak (vein collateral or inadequate seal between the vein and the tube).\nSet the minimal pressure to 6 mm Hg for a venous test or at 90 mm Hg for an arterial test. Under these conditions, an air injector applies the required pressure to the column and system.\nChange the medium every 2 days by using the tube connected to the pressure column. To prevent pressure change damage, open the column plug first.\n5. Completion of the Perfusion\nAfter 3 or 7 days of perfusion: take the EVPS out of the incubator and dismount the veins. Discard the 5 mm proximal and distal vein ends attached to the equipment. Cut a central, 5 mm thick rings from the remaining segment and fix in formalin (morphometry). Freeze the remaining fragments and reduce into powder for further molecular analyses.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
