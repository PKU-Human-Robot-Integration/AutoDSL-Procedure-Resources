    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSTEP 1: Cell harvest, fixation, and preparation of (metaphase) spreads – Day 1\nTiming: 3 h sample processing excluding pretreatment and slide drying, ∼24 h inclusive\nMitotic cells are harvested following experimental treatment, fixed, and spread on glass slides.\nNote: Equal cell numbers between experimental conditions as well as homogenous cell distributions are very important, as cell density impacts fluorescence intensity and cell aggregates display atypical fluorescence signals (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for an example). While this is not an issue for more classic localization applications of FISH, the quantitative nature of exo-FISH requires extra attention to this detail. As such, cells are counted to maintain constant cell numbers between experimental conditions, well homogenized during harvesting, and kept at low concentrations throughout fixation and washes. In addition, prepared slides should be inspected using a light microscope after making spreads to disregard slides with non-homogenous cell distributions or numbers.\nNote: Please see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for troubleshooting options related to this step.\nTreat cells cultured in 10-cm dishes with 5 μM S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC) in complete media for >5 h to enrich for mitotic cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2901-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(D) Left: image of slides undergoing ExoIII treatment with parafilm strips to equally distribute treatment across slide. Example of a liquid ‘spillover’ highlighted in red. Right: comparison of appropriate liquid distribution (left) and bubbles / spillovers (right).\nNote: Cells should be actively replicating to enrich for mitotic cells, and so should be seeded far below confluency, to be ∼2–4 million cells per 10-cm dish, or ∼25%–50% confluency, at the point of collection. Multiple 10-cm dishes per experimental condition can be used if mitotic cell yields are low.\nAlternatives: Any reagent enriching for mitotic cells (e.g., colcemid, Roche cat. #10295892001) can work in place of STLC, but we have primarily performed exo-FISH using STLC for mitotic enrichment.\nAspirate 90% of the remaining media and perform mitotic shake-off to dislodge mitotic cells. Collect supernatant in a 15-mL conical tube.\nNote: Mitotic shake-off – mitotic cells are isolated by banging plates ∼10 times with force, against your palm or a hard surface. Inspection under a light microscope should reveal that most of the rounded (mitotic) cells are dislodged.\nNote: If not using mitotic cells, cells can be harvested by trypsinization (e.g., with TrypLE) cells for 3–5 min at 37°C, followed by collection in complete media or PBS with 1% BSA.\nWash plate(s) with PBS to collect any remaining mitotic cells and add to 15-mL conical tube.\nAlternatives: Any 15-mL conical tube can theoretically be used, but we used ThermoFisher Cat. No. 12604013 for this protocol.\nCentrifuge 4 min, 500 xg at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: Room temperature (20°C–25°C) centrifugation is used throughout the protocol to prevent excessive cell aggregation.\nAspirate media and resuspend pellet in 1 mL PBS.\nCount cells for each experimental condition.\nCentrifuge 4 min, 500 xg at room temperature (20°C–25°C).",
    "Wash pellets in PBS, diluting to ∼1 million cells per 1 mL of PBS.\nMove 200 μL cell suspension to a fresh 15-mL tube (∼200 K cells).\nGradually add ∼10 mL of 0.56% KCl per 200 K cells to the side of the tube.\nInvert tube gently 4 times to mix well.\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nNote: We used the Cole-Parmer Gyro Rocking Shaker (mini, 120 V) at 20 rpm. However, any appropriate rocking shaker can be used.\nCentrifuge 5 min, 300 × g.\nDuring this time, prepare fresh 3:1 MeOH:AA Fixative Solution.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving ∼100 μL liquid. Pipette up and down very gently to resuspend cell pellet.\nGradually add 1 mL fixative (3:1 MeOH:AA) dropwise on the side of the tube using a P1000 micropipette, while gently shaking the tube. Gently tap the tube to mix.\nAdd an additional 9 mL 3:1 MeOH:AA (10 mL total per 200 K cells), while gently shaking the tube.\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a rocking shaker at low speed.\nCentrifuge 5 min, 300 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving ∼100 μL liquid per 200 K cells. Pipette up and down very gently to resuspend cell pellet.\nNote: When aspirating, we use a standard to indicate the volume corresponding to ∼100 μL. It is important that remaining volumes are constant between experimental conditions.\nDrop 10 μL of cells (such that ∼20 K cells are dropped per slide) onto glass slides on to the middle of a 15 μL ddH2O drop.",
    "Note: Repulsion between the fixative and ddH2O will cause cells to disperse more evenly. It helps to expel the 10 μL from the pipette tip until it forms a hanging drop, and then gently placing the hanging drop directly onto the center of the water droplet. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for an example.\nNote: Two well-separated spreads can be made per slide to test different experimental conditions on the same slide.\nInspect slides with a light microscope to ensure consistent cell densities and distributions between experimental conditions. Discard aberrant slides.\nNote: When choosing slides with appropriate cell densities and distributions, we look for slides with homogenously spread cells, often with lighter cell outlines. Slides with excessive cell aggregates are identified by having high cell densities or clusters of cells surrounding empty regions, often with darker cell outlines. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C for examples.\nNote: We typically make at least twice the number of required slides, to ensure having enough slides with consistent cell densities and spreads.\nDry slides overnight (12–24 h) at room temperature (20°C–25°C), protected from light.\nCritical: All steps from this point should be performed while protected from light (e.g., covered coplin jars, covered incubation chambers, etc.). This is to avoid UV exposure and minimize induction of DNA breaks.\nPause point: After creating cell spreads, it is possible to store slides at −20°C for several days, up to a month. However, ExoIII digestion becomes less efficient with longer storage periods, and so it is not recommended to store slides for more than a day or two.\nSTEP 2: Slide treatments and FISH probe hybridization – Day 2\nTiming: 6–7 h",
    "Slides are treated with RNaseA to remove RNA and prevent probe binding to RNA instead of DNA. Slides are then further treated to perform (optional) restriction enzyme digestion and expose ssDNA surrounding DNA breaks through ExoIII digestion. FISH probe hybridization then fluorescently labels exposed ssDNA.\nNote: This protocol includes BsmAI / Nt.BsmAI positive control restriction enzyme digestions (steps 29–32). These may be skipped once the user is familiar with the protocol.\nNote: Please see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] for troubleshooting options related to this step.\nRehydrate slides in PBS for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in coplin jars.\nDab slide edges on tissues to remove excess PBS and place slides with cells facing upwards on parafilm.\nGently add 500 μL 0.5 mg/mL RNaseA in PBS dropwise across the slide and cover with a parafilm strip.\nNote: Parafilm strips are cut to slightly smaller dimensions than the size of the slide, ∼1–2 mm smaller on each side, and laid on top, taking care to prevent any bubble formation.\nIncubate at 37°C for 10 min in a humidified incubation chamber.\nWash slides in PBS for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in coplin jars placed in the middle of the platform on a rocking platform shaker set to low speed.\nDab slide edges on tissues to remove excess PBS and dry the bottom of the slides to remove any moisture. Place slides with cells facing upwards on fresh parafilm.\nCritical: Any liquid on the bottom of the slides may cause the restriction enzyme-containing solution to spill under the slide, preventing equal treatment between slides. As such, slide bottoms should be well-dried before placing on parafilm. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D for examples.",
    "Add 200 μL 1× CutSmart containing either 0 or 1 total units BsmAI or Nt.BsmAI to each slide in order to induce double-stranded or single-stranded DNA breaks, respectively. Cover with a parafilm strip, ensuring no liquid spillover, equal distribution across the slide, and no bubble formation.\nNote: BsmAI and Nt.BsmAI were chosen as positive controls for cenFISH probes based on their recognition sequence abundance in human centromeres (∼900 bp between recognition sites, on average). As a positive control, the user should identify restriction enzymes appropriate to the FISH probe they are using. This can be done by assessing the distribution and frequency of restriction enzyme digestion sites in their region of interest using any standard cloning software (e.g., SnapGene).\nIncubate at 37°C for 60 min in a humidified incubation chamber.\nWash slides in PBS for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in coplin jars on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nDab slide edges on tissues to remove excess PBS and dry the bottom of the slides to remove any moisture. Place slides with cells facing upwards on fresh parafilm.\nCritical: Any liquid on the bottom of the slides may cause the ExoIII-containing solution to spill under the slide, preventing equal treatment between slides. As such, slide bottoms should be well-dried before placing on parafilm. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D for examples.\nAdd 200 μL of 0 mU/μL or 200 mU/μL ExoIII solution to each slide, diluted in 1× buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Cover with a parafilm strip, ensuring no liquid spillover, equal distribution across the slide, and no bubble formation.\nNote: A condition without ExoIII, hereafter referred to as -ExoIII (i.e., 0 mU/μL), must be included in every experiment as a negative control, to account for differences in baseline FISH probe hybridization levels.",
    "Note: The ExoIII concentration should be optimized for each cell line to identify optimal signal ratios between +ExoIII and -ExoIII samples. If ExoIII concentrations are too high, it may be difficult to visualize -ExoIII samples without saturating fluorescent signals in the +ExoIII samples. On the other hand, if ExoIII concentrations are too low, it may be difficult to detect any differences between +ExoIII and -ExoIII samples. As such, we recommend trying 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mU/μL ExoIII in preliminary experiments.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min in a humidified incubation chamber.\nWash slides in PBS for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in coplin jars on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nWash slides in ethanol series: 5 min each in 70% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 100% EtOH in coplin jars on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nAir dry slides at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for at least 1 h.\nPause point: Slides can be stored in the dark at this point until the following day or can be proceeded with after fully drying (∼1 h).\nAdd 200 μL FISH Probe Solution (1:200 of stock, diluted in Hybridization Solution) to dried slides and cover with a parafilm strip, ensuring no liquid spillover, equal distribution across the slide, and no bubble formation.\nNote: We have successfully used up to three FISH probes in the same solution (e.g., Cy3-CENPB, Cy5-Tel, A488-HSat2/3) without issues or fluorescence bleed-through.\nIncubate for 1.5 h in the dark, at room temperature (20°C–25°C), in a humidified incubation chamber.\nTransfer slides to coplin jars and wash in Hybridization Wash Buffer #1 for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.",
    "Transfer slides in Hybridization Wash Buffer #2 for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nWash slides in Hybridization Wash Buffer #2 containing 0.5 μg/mL DAPI for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nWash slides in Hybridization Wash Buffer #2 for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on a rocking platform shaker at low speed.\nWash slides in ethanol series: 5 min each in 70% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 100% EtOH.\nAir dry slides for ∼20 min, until no liquid remains on the slide surface.\nCover glass slides with 22 mm × 64 mm coverslips using ∼30 μL ProLong Gold Antifade Mounting media. Wait for mounting media to dry (at least 3 h) before proceeding to Imaging and Analysis (STEP 3).\nPause point: Slides can be stored short-term at 4°C or long-term at −20°C prior to imaging. We have not tested how long slides can be stored without losing fluorescence, but they can be stored for at least 1 month.\nAlternatives: Any appropriate mounting media can be used in place of Prolong Gold (e.g., Millipore MOWIOL® 4–88 Reagent, cat. #475904).\nSTEP 3: Imaging and analysis\nImage slides.\nCritical: We have observed that FISH signal intensities can have local differences across the slide, so it is important to take images throughout the slide. In addition, it is critical to avoid imaging aggregates given their abnormal FISH staining patterns. Cell selection should be done by DAPI staining. We typically image at least 30 cells per condition. At 60×–100×, this is typically 2–5 cells per image, or ∼10 images, taken from throughout the slide, per condition.",
    "Critical: Since fluorescence intensities will be quantified and compared to other experimental conditions, ensure that the laser settings are set such that there is no saturation in any of the channels or conditions.\nImage analysis (see suggested approach in the ‘quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]’ section below)."
