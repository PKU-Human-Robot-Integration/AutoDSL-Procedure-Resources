    "1. Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (hiPSC) Expansion\nNOTE: hiPSCs can be cultured on a suitable protein mix substrate in the presence of mTeSR1 medium containing mTeSR1 5x supplements (prepared following the manufacturer's instructions; plate ~100 colony fragments/60-mm Petri dish). When the hiPSC colonies reach an appropriate size (see an example of a colony in Figure 2A), passage the cells as described below (once a week).\nCoat dishes with hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix (hereafter called \"qualified matrix\") or any other suitable protein substrate.\nStore the qualified matrix (see the Table of Materials) at -80 °C in 200-µL aliquots in cold 1.5 mL tubes and cold 5 or 10 mL pipettes.\nPrior to passaging, thaw 200 µL of qualified matrix on ice.\nDilute 200 µL of qualified matrix in 20 mL of DMEM/F12 medium (1:100 dilution).\nCoat 60-mm Petri dishes with this solution (5 mL/dish).\nIncubate coated dishes at 37 °C for at least 1 h.\nHiPSC colony fragment cryopreservation and thawing\nAfter cutting the hiPSC colonies (see step 1.3 for the hiPSC colony cutting procedure), gently and slowly resuspend the hiPSC colony fragments in stem cell freezing medium, ~100 fragments/250 µL (see the Table of Materials).\nAliquot the colony fragments in suitable vials for cryopreservation (250 µL/vial).\nPlace the vials in a container filled with 2-propanol and place the container at -80 °C for a minimum of 2 h and up to 2 weeks.\nTransfer the vials into the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen tank.\nTo restart the culture, thaw 1 frozen vial in water bath at 37 °C.\nGently collect the hiPSC colony fragments in 7 mL of pre-warmed complete hiPSC medium (see the Table of Materials) in a 15 mL tube using a 1, 2, or 5 mL pipette.",
    "Centrifuge the hiPSC colony fragments at 130 x g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and gently resuspend the hiPSC colony fragments in 1 mL of complete hiPSC medium using a 1, 2, or 5 mL pipette.\nFurther dilute the cell suspension in 3 or 4 mL of complete hiPSC medium.\nPlate the hiPSC colony fragments in a qualified matrix-coated 60-mm Petri dish (~100 fragments/dish; coat the dishes as described in step 1.1).\nIncubate the hiPSCs at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPerform a total medium change every day.\nPassaging of the hiPSC colonies\n\tNOTE: Undifferentiated hiPSCs should be round in shape, with large nucleoli and without abundant cytoplasm. Undifferentiated colonies should be characterized by a flat and tightly-packed morphology. Only undifferentiated colonies (about 1 mm in diameter) should be cut for further passaging.\n\t\nCut the stem cell colonies in squares of about 200 µm x 200 µm using a 1-mL syringe with a 30G needle or any other commercially available tools (see the Table of Materials). Use a stereoscopic microscope at 4x magnification in a laminar flow cabinet at room temperature.\nDetach the colony fragments from the dish surface using a 200-µL pipette by gently pipetting the medium underneath to lift the pieces.\nTransfer the colony fragments (~100 pieces) to a qualified matrix-DMEM/F12-coated plate filled with 4 mL of complete hiPSC medium (see the Table of Materials; coat the dishes as described in step 1.1).\nIncubate the new plate(s) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPerform a total medium change every day and inspect the morphology of the colonies using a phase-contrastmicroscope at 4X and 10X magnifications.\n2. HiPSC Differentiation into Mixed Neurons and Glia\nNOTE: The procedure takes approximately 28 days to complete, with the main steps outlined in Figure 1 (upper part).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55702/55702fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Schematic Representation of the Neuronal Differentiation Protocol. (Upper part) IMR90-hiPSC colonies can be cut into fragments to form embryoid bodies (EBs). After 2 days in vitro (DIV), EBs can be plated onto laminin- or standard matrix-coated dishes and cultured in the presence of neuroepithelial induction (NRI) medium to generate neuroectodermal derivatives (rosettes, here stained for nestin (green) and β-III-tubulin (red)). Rosettes can be dissociated, collected, replated on laminin- or standard matrix-coated dishes, and further differentiated into mature neuronal (NF200, red) and glial (GFAP, green) cells in the presence of neuronal differentiation (ND) medium. (Lower part) rosette-derived NSCs (nestin, red) can be expanded in the presence of neural induction (NI) medium, cryopreserved, or further differentiated in the presence of ND medium to form mixed neuronal (NF200, green) and glial (GFAP, red) cultures.

HiPSC colony fragments should be of equal size to obtain homogenous embryoid bodies (EBs) in the next steps. Morphologically differentiated colonies (with large cytoplasmic fractions and small nucleoli) should be discarded.\n\t\nRefresh the hiPSC medium (3 mL/60-mm Petri dish) prior to cutting the undifferentiated hiPSC colonies (about 1 mm in diameter, see Figure 2A) under sterile conditions (as described in step 1).\nCut the undifferentiated colonies (as shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2B) into fragments of approximately 200 µm x 200 µm using a 1-mL syringe with a 30G needle. Use a stereoscopic microscope at 4X magnification in a laminar flow cabinet at room temperature.\nDetach the colony fragments from the dish surface using a 200-µL pipette by gently pipetting medium underneath to lift the pieces.",
    "Transfer all detached fragments and the medium to a 15-mL tube using a 1, 2, or 5 mL pipette.\nRinse the dish with 2 mL of complete hiPSC medium to recover all fragments.\nCentrifuge at 112 x g for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the fragments in 5 mL of complete hiPSC EB medium (see the Table of Materials).\nPlate the colony fragments in a 60 mm ultra-low attachment Petri dish (5 mL/60-mm Petri dish).\nIncubate the Petri dish overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn the next day (Day 1), collect the EBs and their medium in a 15 mL tube using a 1, 2, or 5 mL pipette.\nCentrifuge the EBs at 112 x g for 1 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the EBs in 5 mL of complete hiPSC EB medium using a 1, 2, or 5 mL pipette.\nReplate the EBs onto a new 60-mm ultra-low attachment Petri dish (5 mL/60 mm Petri dish).\nIncubate the Petri dish overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn Day 1, coat the dishes with basement membrane matrix (e.g., matrigel, referred to hereafter as \"standard matrix\") or any other suitable protein substrate (e.g., laminin).\nStore the standard matrix (see the Table of Materials) at -80 °C in 200-µL aliquots using cold 1.5 mL tubes and cold 5 or 10 mL pipettes.\nThaw 200 µL of standard matrix on ice.\nDilute 200 µL of standard matrix in 20 mL of DMEM/F12 medium (1:100 dilution).\nCoat 60-mm Petri dishes with this solution (5 mL/dish).\nIncubate the coated dishes at 37 °C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: These dishes will be used to plate the EBs (about 50 EBs/dish) and generate neuroepithelial aggregates (rosettes); see step 2.3.\nGeneration of neuroepithelial aggregates (rosettes) (Days 2 → 7)",
    "On Day 2, remove the standard matrix coating solution from the 60-mm Petri dishes (no need to rinse the plates) and fill them with 5 mL/dish of complete neuroepithelial induction medium (NRI); see the Table of Materials.\nTransfer the floating EBs (from step 2.1.14) to coated dishes (~50 EBs/dish) using a 200 µL pipette under a stereoscopic microscope at 4x magnification and placed in a laminar flow cabinet.\n\t\tNOTE: It is critical to select homogenous, medium-sized EBs (~200-300 µm in diameter). Too-small EBs may not survive well during neuroectodermal differentiation, while too-large EBs tend to undergo core necrosis.\nIncubate the dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nThe day after (Day 3), check the dishes under the microscope at 10x magnification to ensure that the EBs are all attached.\nGently perform a total medium change with complete NRI medium.\nChange the NRI medium every other day up to day 7, when neuroepithelial aggregates (rosettes) should be visible.\nOn Day 7, coat standard matrix (or laminin), as described in step 2.2, onto any required plate or dish format: 96-well plates (100 µL/well), 24-well plates (250 µL/well), 12-well plates (500 µL/well), MEA chips (for electrical activity, 1 mL/single-well chip), or 60 mm Petri dishes (4 mL/dish).\nIncubate the coated plates/dishes for at least 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRosette dissociation and neuronal differentiation (Days 8 → 28)\n\tNOTE: This procedure requires good manual skills and precision. To avoid collecting mesodermal and endodermal cells, only ectoderm rosette-like structures should be dissociated and collected.\n\t\nOn Day 8, cut the rosette-like structures into fragments under a stereoscopic microscope at 10X magnification in sterile conditions. Use a 1 mL syringe with a 30G needle. Note that the rosettes tend to easily detach from the dish when touched with the needle.",
    "Complete the detachment of the rosette fragments using a 200-µL pipette.\nTransfer the dish under the laminar flow hood and collect the rosette fragments and their medium into a 15 mL conical tube using a 1, 2, or 5 mL pipette. Rinse the dish with 2 mL of NRI medium to recover all fragments.\nSpin down the rosette fragments at 112 x g for 2 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1x DPBS (without calcium and magnesium) and gently pipette the rosette fragments up and down using a 1,000-µL pipette to partially dissociate them.\nAdd 4 mL of complete NRI medium and count the cells using trypan blue and an automated cell counter (see the Table of Materials)\n\t\tNOTE: Dilute 20 µL of cell suspension in 20 µL of Trypan blue. This step may be omitted if the cells cannot be brought into a single-cell suspension. If the rosette fragments do not look completely dissociated, rosettes fragments derived from about 50 EBs/60-mm dish can be resuspended in 50 mL of complete NRI medium and plated, as indicated in Table 1.\nAspirate the standard matrix (or laminin) coating solution from the Petri dishes, plates, and/or MEA chips (from step 2.3.7). Do not let them dry.\nPlate the cells in complete NRI medium according to the study plan (about 15,000 cells/cm2; see Table 1 for plating volume indications).\nIncubate the plates overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn Day 10, perform a total medium change using complete neuronal differentiation medium (ND); see the Table of Materials.\nRefresh the complete ND medium twice a week until Day 28.\nCharacterize the neuronal/glial cell derivatives, as described in step 5 (see Table 2 for general acceptance criteria).",
    "3. HiPSC-derived Neural Stem Cell (NSC) Expansion and Differentiation into Mixed Neurons and Glia\nNOTE: NSCs derived from rosette fragments can be expanded and maintained following the procedure described below (Figure 1, lower part). This allows for incrementing the number of cells for differentiation and chemical testing.\nCoat a 60 mm Petri dish (or a T-25 flask) with 5 mL of standard matrix DMEM/F12 coating solution and incubate it for at least 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (as described in step 2.2).\nSpin down the rosette fragments derived from steps 1-2 (see step 2.4.) in a conical 15 mL tube at 112 x g for 2 min.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of neural induction medium (NI); see the Table of Materials.\nTransfer the cells onto a standard matrix-coated 60 mm Petri dish (or T-25 flask).\nCulture rosette-derived NSCs in the presence of NI medium, refreshing the medium every other day until the cells reach confluence.\nWhen confluent, passage the NSCs as described in the following steps.\n\tNOTE: Passage the NSCs about once a week; consider using freshly coated dishes, flasks, or plates, depending on the study plan.\nRemove the complete NI medium and gently rinse the NSCs with DPBS (without calcium and magnesium).\nAdd 1.5 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA pre-warmed to 37 °C to the 60-mm Petri dish (or T-25 flask) containing the cells and place it in the incubator for 1 min.\nGently tap the dish (or flask) to detach the cells.\nAdd 1.5 mL of trypsin inhibitor pre-warmed to 37 °C and transfer the cells to a 15-mL tube.\nRinse the Petri dish (or T-25 flask) with an equal volume of NI medium (1.5 mL) and collect the volume in the same 15-mL tube.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 130 x g for 3 min.\nRemove supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in 1 mL of complete NI medium using a 1,000-µL pipette.\nFurther dilute the cell suspension in 3 or 4 mL of complete NI medium and count the cells using trypan blue and an automated cell counter.\nPlate the NSCs onto the 60-mm Petri dish (or T-25 flask) from step 3.1 at a density of about 50,000 cells/cm2.\nPerform a total medium change with complete NI medium every other day.\nCharacterize the cells for the presence of neuronal/glial cell derivatives, as described in step 5.\n\tNOTE: NSCs can be differentiated into mixed cultures of neurons and glia in complete ND medium (as described in steps 2.4.11-2.4.13), refreshing the complete ND medium twice a week for 21 days.\n4. HiPSC-derived NSC Cryopreservation and Thawing\nNOTE: Upon passaging, NSCs can be frozen and re-thawed following this procedure.\nCentrifuge passaged NSCs (from step 3.12) at 130 x g for 3 min.\n\tNOTE: The cells should be counted at step 3.14.\nGently and slowly resuspend the NSCs at 3 x 106/mL of freezing medium (see the Table of Materials).\nAliquot the cells in suitable vials for cryopreservation (about 0.5 mL = 1.5 x 106/vial).\nPlace the vials in a container filled with 2-propanol and place the container at -80 °C for a minimum of 2 h and up to 2 weeks.\nTransfer the vials to the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen tank.\nTo restart the cell culture, thaw 1 frozen vial in a water bath at 37 °C.\nGently collect the cells in 7 mL of pre-warmed complete NI medium in a 15-mL tube using a 1,000-µL pipette.\nCentrifuge the cells at 130 x g for 3 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in 1 mL of complete NI medium using a 1,000-µL pipette.\nFurther dilute the cell suspension in 3 or 4 mL of complete NI medium and count the cells using trypan blue and an automated cell counter (note: dilute 20 µL of cell suspension in 20 µL of trypan blue; the viability after thawing should be ≥ 80%).\nPlate the NSCs in a coated 60-mm Petri dish (or T25 flask) at a density of about 50,000 cells/cm2.\n5. Characterization of hiPSC-derived Neuronal and Glial Cells\nNOTE: Upon differentiation, neuronal and glial derivatives can be characterized using different techniques, such as the ones described in the following sections.\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses10\nSpin down hiPSC colony fragments, EBs, and/or NSCs at 130 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 µL of cold RNA lysis buffer provided in a suitable kit for RNA extraction.\nAlternatively, collect neuronal/glial derivatives directly from the plates by aspirating the medium and adding cold RNA lysis buffer to the wells to collects the cells.\nIsolate the RNA following the manufacturer's instruction.\nReverse-transcribe 500 ng of the total RNA using a suitable kit for RNA to cDNA retrotranscription.\nRun qPCR reactions in duplicate using appropriate master mix and primer sets (see the Table of Materials).\nRecord the fluorescent emission in real-time: 45 cycles with primers annealing at 60 °C.\nNormalize the relative RNA quantities to GAPDH and β-actin as reference genes and use undifferentiated hiPSCs or untreated cells for the calibrating conditions (ΔΔCt method). Alternatively, use another suitable method.\nImmunocytochemistry and high-content imaging (HCI)6,11\nFix the hiPSC colonies, NSCs, and/or neuronal/glial derivatives with cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Gently wash the cells in 1X PBS and store the plates at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nWhen ready for staining, permeabilize the cells in permeabilization buffer (1x DPBS containing 0.1% triton-X-100 and 3% BSA) for 15 min at room temperature.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer and incubate the cells in blocking buffer (3% BSA/1X DPBS) for 15 min at room temperature to prevent the nonspecific binding of antibodies.\nRemove the blocking buffer and incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing suitable primary antibodies (see the Table of Materials).\nWash the cells 3 times with 1x PBS.\nIncubate the cells for 45 min at room temperature in blocking buffer containing fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (see the Table of Materials), counterstaining the nuclei with DAPI dye.\nQuantify the mean fluorescence intensity and the relative percentages of cell types using a suitable high-content imaging platform, if available (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTES: To determine the intensity level of the fluorescent background, incubate some cells/wells with secondary antibodies alone. The flow cytometric analysis of live (not fixed), undifferentiated hiPSCs can be performed to assess the expression of PSC-specific markers, such as SSEA4 (see the Table of Materials). Undifferentiated hiPSC colonies can be analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity using commercially available BCIP/NBT kits, following the manufacturers' instructions (see the Table of Materials). Additionally, reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays and analyses may be performed, as described in Reference 12 (for a list of tested antibodies, see the Table of Materials).\nElectrophysiological measurements13\nPlate the dissociated rosette fragments (after 7 DIV) or NSCs derived from rosettes on coated multielectrode arrays (MEAs; see the Table of Materials) in complete ND medium (~1 x 105 cells/single-well MEA chip).",
    "Differentiate the cells for 3 weeks in complete ND medium, refreshing the medium twice a week.\nAt the end of differentiation, seal the MEA chips with a semi-permeable membrane under a laminar flow hood to keep the cultures sterile for repeated measurements.\nReplace one of the electrodes with one ground reference, allowing for recordings from the remaining electrodes.\nRecord the mean firing rate (MFR; number of spikes/min) using an MEA amplifier with the integrated temperature process control adjusted to 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nDetect peaks from the MEA raw data using threshold limit of -4.7σ (σ represents the standard deviation of the basal noise).\nProcess the post-recording data with a suitable software."
