    "All animal care and procedures were in accordance with China Nanfang Hospital policies for heath and well-being (application No: NFYY-2019-73).\n1. Mouse preparation\nAnesthetize the mouse.\n\t\nPrepare sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) in a syringe.\nGrab the mouse (8-week-old male C57BL/6) with the left hand so that its belly is facing up and its head is lower than its tail. Disinfect the abdominal skin with 75% alcohol.\nHolding the syringe in the right hand, pierce the abdomen white line with the needle slightly to the right side of the skin by 3-5 mm. Ensure that the syringe needle and the skin are at a 45° angle, inject the pentobarbital slowly into the abdominal cavity.  After shaving, disinfects around the mouse’s incision site 3 times alternately with 75% alcohol and Chlorhexidine solution.\nCheck whether the anesthesia was successful by the lack of a righting reflex.\nInject Rhodamine B isothiocyanate–dextran into the caudal vein.\n\t\nPrepare 100 µL of 10 mg/mL Rhodamine B isothiocyanate–dextran in a syringe.\nWipe the mouse’s tail with 75% alcohol.\nHold the tail with the left hand, hold the syringe in the right hand with the needle parallel to the vein, and inject the 100 µL dye.\nStop the bleeding with a cotton swab after the injection.\nSoak the mouse’s abdominal fur with gauze wetted with sterile water, and shave the mouse’s abdomen using a razor, making strokes in the direction of the fur.After shaving, disinfects around the mouse’s incision site 3 times alternately with 75% alcohol and Chlorhexidine solution.\nAfter wiping a heating pad with 75% alcohol, open the heating pad, and place the mouse on its back in the heating pad to maintain its body temperature at 37 °C.\n2. Fixing the mouse liver with the body organ imaging frame",
    "NOTE: The commercial organ imaging frame has not been released yet.\nPlace a clean suction cup in a fixed position.\nInstall an organ imaging fixture (Supplementary Figure 1) and wipe the heating pad and suction cup with 75% alcohol.\nConnect the suction cup (5 mm diameter) to the vacuum pump hose and turn on the vacuum pump.\nOn a sterile table sterilized with 75% alcohol, disinfects around the mouse’s incision site 3 times alternately with 75% alcohol and Chlorhexidine solution, then disinfects around the mouse’s incision site 3 times alternately with 75% alcohol and Chlorhexidine solution, then use surgical scissors to cut 2 cm of skin off the lower sternal border of the mouse and expose the liver.\nPlace the mouse together with the heating pad on the holder base.\nAdjust the organ imaging fixture so that the suction cup holds the liver. Then use a negative pressure of 30-35 kPa for suction so that the liver attaches to the suction cup (Supplementary Figure 2).\n3. Adjusting the multiphoton laser scanning microscope\nTurn on the multiphoton microscope and select the 60x/1.00 W objective.\nFix the frame and mouse under the objective lens.\nAdd a drop of normal saline that can cover the entire lens, which is the center of the suction cup, and adjust the objective lens to just touch the normal saline.\nDouble-click on the computer icon to turn on the laser software and turn on the switch. Then press and hold the power button and shutter for 3 s.\nSet the wavelength to 800 nm.\nStart the microscope operating software using the computer.\nFor the Acquisition Setting, set Laser 800.\n4. Observation using multiphoton laser scanning microscope\nFor Image Acquisition Control, click the Fluorescent switch.",
    "Ensure that the room and equipment lights are switched off. To reduce noise levels, use the microscope in a darkened environment.\nOpen the light path shutter on the microscope.\nRotate the fluorescence filter to the fourth gear and pull the two levers of the optical switch.\nLooking through the eyepiece, use the coarse and fine focusing quasispirals to adjust the focal length, and use the X/Y axes to adjust the field of view to find the target area.\n5. Multiphoton laser scanning micrography\nTurn off the fluorescent switch on the software, switch the fluorescent filter to the second gear (second gear is RXD1), and push the two levers of the optical switch.\nClick on Focus ×2 to preview the target area and adjust the acquisition setting and image acquisition control parameters (image resolution: 1024).\nPress Control + C and adjust the high voltage, gain, and offset (to reduce noise levels).\nClick Stop to stop preview, click the XY button to scan in two dimensions, and save after completion (Figure 1).\nSelect a region, click on Depth, and then Preview to select the end set and start set (see the complete required part of the blood vessel) in the Microscope setting. Scan 3D images and save after completion (Figure 2).\nSelect a region, click on Time, and adjust other acquisition setting and image acquisition control parameters (Step Size: 1 μm; Slices: 10; Time Scan Number: 40). Scan different slices and save after completion to obtain moving images (Video 1).\n\tNOTE: Have someone care for the mice during the scan and add anesthesia accordingly.\nSacrifice the mouse by neck dissection.\nSubscription Required.
