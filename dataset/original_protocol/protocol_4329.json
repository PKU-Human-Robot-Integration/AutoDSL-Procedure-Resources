    "Transient expression assays in N. benthamiana  Transient expression assays were performed as described previously (DeYoung et al., 2012). Briefly:   N. benthamiana plants were grown in small plastic pots filled with Metro-Mix 360 under an 8/16 h photoperiod at 150 μmol/m/s and 23 °C.   Dexamethasone-inducible constructs of N20sYFP:HA and n20sYFP:HA were mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation.    After overnight culture in Luria-Bertani liquid medium, cells (7 ml culture) were pelleted and resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2 solution with 100 μm acetosyringone and suspensions were diluted to OD600 = 0.3 before infiltration.    The cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and infiltrated with a needleless 1 ml syringe into leaves of 4-week-old (best age for transient expression) N. benthamiana plants. A minimum of six fully expanded leaves should be infiltrated for one experiment.    Transgenes were induced by spraying leaves with 50 µM dexamethasone 40 h after inoculation. Samples were harvested for protein extraction 4 to 6 h after dexamethasone application.    Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed at 5 h after dexamethasone application to confirm the expression of sYFP fusions. A 1 cm x 1 cm tissue was clipped from the infiltrated leaf area and placed in a drop of ddH2O in the center of a slide. After a cover slip was placed, the slide was examined using the Leica SP5 system.      Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting   For total protein extraction, six infiltrated leaves were ground in lysis buffer. Tissues can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C till needed.   Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes.    100 μl an anti-HA monoclonal antibody matrix was added into each homogenate. The mixture was then incubated at 4 °C overnight and rotated end-to-end.",
    "The resin was pelleted by centrifuging at 16,000 x g for 10 sec and washed three times with 1 ml lysis buffer.   For immuno-blot, the immuno-precipitates were mixed with 4x SDS loading buffer at a ratio of 3:1 and boiled for 10 min before resolving on 4% to 20% (w/v) gradient Tris-HEPES-SDS PAGE.    Protein samples were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for probing with anti-HA peroxidase.   The ImmunoStar HRP Substrate Kit was used for detecting antibody complexes.      Detection of S-Acylation The in vitro detection of PBS1 S-acylation was performed as described by Berzat et al. (2005). Briefly:   The immuno-precipitates of N20-sYFP:HA or n20-sYFP:HA were incubated in 1 ml lysis buffer with 50 mM N-ethylmaleimide on an end-to-end rotator for 48 h at 4 °C to block free sulfhydryl groups.    The immuno-precipitates were then washed, incubated in 500 μl 1 M hydroxylamine solution on an end-to-end rotator for 1 h at room temperature to hydrolyze Cys-palmitate thioester bonds.   The immuno-precipitates were washed and incubated in 500 μl 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0) solution containing 1 μm EZ-Link Biotin-BMCC on an end-to-end rotator for 2 h at room temperature to label cleaved thioester bonds.    The immuno-precipitates were washed, resuspended in nonreducing protein sample buffer, resolved on 4% to 20% (w/v) gradient Tris-HEPES-SDS PAGE.   The protein samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.    The membrane was blocked in 5% biotin-free BSA TBST solution for 1 h and then probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase.   The ImmunoStar HRP Substrate Kit was used for detecting biotin-streptavidin complexes."
