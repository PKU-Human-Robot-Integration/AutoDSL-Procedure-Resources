    "1. Mutagenesis cloning to generate  Ube3a variants\nClone all Ube3a variants into the pCIG2 plasmid (Figure 1A), a bicistronic vector that contains a chicken-β-actin promoter and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for EGFP expression19. Full-length Ube3a constructs contain an N-terminal Myc-tag sequence and are cloned into pCIG2 using a 5' SacI site and a 3' XmaI site. In addition, naturally occurring EcoRI, EcoRV, and PstI sites within the Ube3a coding sequence are also used to subclone fragments.\n\tNOTE: De-identified variants for Ube3a can be obtained through the literature and in publicly accessible repositories such as the ClinVar database1. Additional unreported variants can be obtained through personal communication with medical centers.\nUse an adapted two-step megaprimer mutagenesis method20 to introduce mutations into the Ube3a reading frame. In the first step, design the mutagenic oligonucleotide that contains the desired mutation (the example shown in this protocol is to generate a UBE3A Q588E variant) flanked by at least 30 base pairs (bp) of homology 5′ and 3′ to the mutation (Figure 1B and Table 1).\nUse the mutagenic oligonucleotide along with a complementary oligonucleotide for the first round PCR to generate a 200-400 bp megaprimer containing the mutation (Figure 1C; Table 2 and Table 3). Use the entire 50 μL of the PCR reaction volume for agarose gel electrophoresis using a 1% gel and subsequent gel purification (Table of Materials). Elute the PCR product in 30 μL of deionized H2O (diH2O) for use in the second round PCR step below.\nSet up the second round PCR as indicated (Figure 1C; Table 2 and Table 3). This step will generate larger DNA fragments (typically ~1-1.5 kb in length) containing the mutation and terminal restriction sites suitable for sub-cloning (Figure 1C).",
    "After completion of the PCR reaction, purify the resulting product using a PCR purification kit (Table of Materials). Elute in 30 μL and digest all of the purified product and the pCIG2 Ube3a WT construct with the appropriate restriction enzymes (the example shows digestion with EcoRI and XmaI).\nAfter 2 h of digestion at 37 °C, resolve the digestion products through agarose gel electrophoresis (1% gel), and gel-purify the appropriate products. Set up ligations according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table of Materials), transform the ligation products into a DH10B bacterial strain (Table of Materials), and then plate with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) selection.\nThe next day, pick two to four colonies to inoculate 3 mL cultures containing Luria Broth (LB) and 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Let the cultures grow overnight at 37 °C in an orbital incubator with shaking (225 rpm).\nThe following day, use 1-1.5 mL of the bacterial culture to miniprep the plasmid DNA (Table of Materials). Save the remaining culture by placing them at 4 °C. Screen the miniprepped plasmids by Sanger sequencing using an oligonucleotide that binds ~200 bp from the desired mutation.\nUse the bacterial cultures saved at 4 °C to re-inoculate 50 mL cultures to midiprep the correct plasmid (Table of Materials). Fully sequence the Ube3a coding sequence to validate the correct sequence of the DNA.\nCreate working stocks of Ube3a variant plasmids, as well as the β-catenin activated reporter (BAR)21, TK-Renilla luciferase, ligase-dead Ube3a (UBE3A C820A mutation), and pCIG2 empty vector at a concentration of 100 ng/μL using sterile H2O for the subsequent transfection steps.\n2. Preparation and transfection of human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells",
    "Perform the assays in HEK293T cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) pre-supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotic-antimycotic agent as described previously17. Grow the cells in a sterile, humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nUsing a biosafety cabinet, first plate the suspended HEK293T cells onto tissue culture-treated 96-well flat-bottomed plates at a density of 2.2 × 104 cells per well in 100 μL of culture media and allow them to grow overnight.\nOn the second day, transfect the cells in a biosafety cabinet with Firefly and Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids (Table 4) and Ube3a plasmids in triplicate. Perform the transfections in 10 μL of total volume per well using a 10:1:8 ratio of plasmids (50 ng of BAR, 5 ng of TK-Renilla, and 40 ng of Ube3a plasmid per well, respectively), as previously described18, and 0.4 μL of transfection reagent (Table 4).\n\tNOTE: For each experiment, an empty vector (GFP only) and a plasmid encoding ligase-dead Ube3a are also transfected to serve as negative controls.\nCreate a master mix for the transfections for each variant in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (Table 4) and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. After the incubation, gently agitate the transfection mixture by tapping the tube, and then add 10 μL of the transfection mixture directly to the existing growth media in the wells.\nAfterward, return the cells to the incubator and allow the plasmids to express for 48 h. Replacement of the growth media is not necessary.\nMonitor the transfection efficiency by GFP fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope. HEK293T cells are efficiently transfected by this method, and >80% of cells should express GFP after 48 h.\n3. Measurement of luciferase activity",
    "NOTE: Luciferase activity is assessed using a commercially available system that assays both Firefly and Renilla luciferase (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nCarefully aspirate the culture media from transfected HEK293T cells, and then wash the cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Aspirate the PBS and lyse the cells by adding 25 μL of non-denaturing lysis buffer and incubate for 15 min with gentle rocking on ice.\nAfterward, add 20 μL of the resulting lysate (no centrifugation is necessary) into a new 96-well assay plate containing 100 μL of a Firefly luciferase substrate reagent. Mix the plate gently by tapping.\nLoad the plate onto a plate reader and measure the luminescence using a top detector with a read height of 1 mm and an integration time of 1 s.\n\tNOTE: The gain of the detector may need to be adjusted based on the strength of the signal.\nImmediately after reading the Firefly luciferase luminescence, add 100 µL of Renilla luciferase substrate to the wells. This step simultaneously quenches the Firefly luciferase activity while assessing Renilla luciferase activity. Mix the samples by gentle agitation of the plate and measure the luminescence again to assess the Renilla luciferase activity.\n\tNOTE: While other plates can be used for this assay, using plates with black frames and white wells will provide the most sensitive results as this amplifies the luciferase signal while minimizing noise.\nQuantify the reporter responses as the Firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase ratio (Firefly/Renilla), and average the values of the triplicate measurements. Afterward, normalize the Firefly/Renilla value for each variant against the values for wild-type (WT) Ube3a expressing cells to compare the relative activity of variant proteins.\nSubscription Required.
