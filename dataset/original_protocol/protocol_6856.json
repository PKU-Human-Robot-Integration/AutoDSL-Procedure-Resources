    "Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultureNote: All work with Mtb should be conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory by trained personnel wearing appropriate PPE and be approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS). Prepare the pre-culture by inoculating 10 ml of 7H9-GOT (Middlebrook 7H9 media supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 10% OADC supplement, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80) with 0.5 ml of the thawed Mtb glycerol stock (1:20 dilution). Grow cells in 50 ml conical tubes at 37°C for 48-72 h, until cultures reach an OD600 of 0.2-0.4 (early logarithmic phase).Subculture by diluting 0.5 ml of the pre-culture in 10 ml of 7H9+GOT (1:20 dilution). Grow cells in 50 ml conical tubes at 37°C for 48-72 h, until cultures reach an OD600 of 0.2-0.4 (early logarithmic phase).Dilute the culture for spotting on the ODELAM plate (see Part E of Procedure for further instructions).ODELAM agarose aliquotGather the 1 L media bottle, high purity agarose, pipettes, and Falcon tubes.Weigh 2 ± 0.02 g of agarose and place into 1 L media bottle.Add 150 g of 18 MΩ H2O to the media bottle.Record the total weight of the bottle, agarose, and water.Microwave the media bottle, water, and agarose until all agarose is dissolved.Weigh the media bottle, water, and agarose again to evaluate the amount of water lost during boiling.Add 18 MΩ H2O until the mass equals the previously recorded total weight.Aliquot agarose by mass, 15.1 g into 50 ml Falcon conical tubes or 3.0 g into a 15 ml Falcon conical tube.ODELAM agarose media preparationNote: The steps in this section can be performed outside of a biological safety cabinet if the lab is relatively dust free. Clean the previously printed gasket slide (see 3D printing gaskets of Notes section) using lab labeling tape.",
    "Heat two 1 L beakers with approximately 750 ml of Di H2O, one with boiling water and the other with water warmed to 40°C.Add the appropriate amounts of 10× media and additional reagents needed to the prepared agarose aliquots (Table 1).Note: Do not add reagents that are temperature sensitive.

    "Clean a 50 mm × 75 mm × 1 mm glass slide using 70% ethanol. When dry, wipe with lens paper to remove any residual particles and fibers.Place the clean glass slide on top of the printed gasket slide and secure slides with binder clips (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4027/bioprotoc-11-10-4027-g002.jpgFigure 2. Assembly of agar slide. A. Ensure the gaskets are clamped directly over the gasket; otherwise, the glass will flex, and the agar will be uneven. B. Fill the slides with agarose media by injecting with a syringe needle. C-D. After allowing the media to set, use binder clip loops to pry slides apart gently (D).Assemble the syringes and 20-gauge needles for each media condition.Place the tube with the media formulation in boiling water. The 20 ml media tubes should be in the boiling water for 18 min and the 4 ml media tubes for 8 min.Note: Make sure the cap does not go below the water surface as this will cause water to leak into the tube. Additionally, ensure the beaker is covered; otherwise, the agarose will not melt completely. After boiling the appropriate amount of time and the agarose is melted, vortex the agarose media tube and place it in the 40°C water bath.Wait 3-5 min for the agarose to equilibrate at 40°C and then add the temperature-sensitive components (e.g., drug and OADC additive).Vortex the tubes thoroughly to mix the media and additives.Quickly draw the media into the syringe and then push the plunger slightly down and back up to remove air bubbles from the syringe.Fill the glass slide by injecting the media into the gasket slide assembly (Figure 2B). Note which media is injected into each chamber.Wait approximately 20-30 min for the agarose to solidify (Figure 2C).Remove the binder clips.",
    "Using a binder clip loop (or other convenient leverage), slowly and carefully pry the glass slides apart (Figure 2D). Try to keep the agarose from sticking to the blank slide.Note: This step takes some practice. Store the agarose slide in a clean plastic container (e.g., an empty tip box) for transport into the BSL-3 environment. Agarose slides can be stored 3-4 h at RT. Only use agarose slides prepared on the day of the ODELAM experiment.Preparation for ODELAM experimentSelect the cultures and media conditions of interest.Prepare directories and data storage space. Create file directories and ensure there is sufficient storage capacity for the experiment.Create-Spot layout files. Double-check the file to ensure the strain layout is correct. Common mistakes include not correcting for flipping the array and not sorting the array correctly.ODELAM Spotting Cell CulturesClean and sterilize all ODELAM chamber components (except the agarose slide and electrical contacts) with 70% ethanol and dry them with Kimwipes®.Use a clean plastic container to transfer the ODELAM chamber components to the Biological Safety Cabinet.Measure the OD600 of all Mtb cultures.Dilute cultures to an optimal OD600. The goal is to have 500-1,000 cells per ROI. The ratio of OD600 to CFU varies from strain to strain; therefore, the OD600 value may need to be adjusted slightly for different organisms and strains. An OD600 value of 0.03-0.05 is optimal for many mycobacterium strains.Array 150 μl of the diluted cultures into a 96-well plate. The locations in the 96-well plate should be determined by the spot layout pattern (see examples in Figures 5 and 6).Organize and layout the tips in tip-boxes for spotting (see Notes for suggestions).Place the base plate on the pipette alignment tool. Ensure the screws that level the alignment tool fit into the three recessed holes in the base plate (Figure 3A).",
    "Note: The following steps (E7-E10) should be performed in a Biological Safety Cabinet over an absorbent pad soaked in a tuberculocidal agent. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4027/bioprotoc-11-10-4027-g003.jpgFigure 3. Assembly of ODELAM chamber. A. The base plate has recessed holes for mounting the pipette alignment tool, as indicated by the red arrows. B. Place the agar slide in the recession. C-D. Place the clean silicon gasket on the bottom plate (C) and secure it with the appropriate button head and countersunk screws (D). E. Spot the cultures onto the agar pads using the correct tip sequence. F. Complete assembly of the chamber by adding the ITO slide, top plate, top gasket, and electrical contacts.Place the previously prepared agar slide in the recessed section of the ODELAM base plate (Figure 3B).Place the bottom silicon gasket on the ODELAM bottom plate. Smooth out the gasket and ensure the screw holes are correctly aligned and the gasket has a minimal overhang around the edges of the bottom plate (Figure 3C).Place the bottom plate onto the base plate and secure the two with the appropriate screws (Figure 3D).Flip the assembly over and place the pipette alignment tool onto the base plate. Ensure the screws protruding from each leg are set into the three corresponding holes in the base plate.Note: Be careful that the forward screw does not fall into the vent hole, as this sometimes happens and will cause the pipette tips to mark the agar. Check the agar surface to see if the pipette tips mark the agar (Figure 3E). If they do, adjust the height of the alignment tool using the screws on the legs until the tips are within 1 mm of the surface. They should be close but not mark the media.",
    "Use diagrams to guide spotting patterns for transferring from 96-well plate to ODELAM (see Notes)Spot 0.8-1.1 μl of culture. If needed, increase or decrease the volume of culture spotted to adjust its diameter slightly.Place the ITO glass slide into the recession in the base plate. Make sure the ITO conductive side of the slide is facing up.Note: Mark the conductive side of the ITO slide with an alcohol-resistant marker to identify the conductive side. Place the upper silicon gasket onto the upper plate (similar to Step E6, Figure 3C). Ensure the gasket does not overhang the center hole in the plate as this could interfere with the electrical contacts to the ITO slide.Secure the top plate to the base plate with screws.Screw in the vent plugs on the bottom plate.Disinfect the ODELAM chamber by wiping with a disinfectant-soaked towel but avoid touching or getting disinfectant on the ITO slide as this will cause condensation that will interfere with imaging.Attach the electrodes and silicon gasket electrode spacers with the plastic screws to the top plate and flip the chamber over (Figure 3F).Keeping track of plate orientation, place the assembled chamber onto the microscope stage.Connect electrodes to the power supply, turn on the heater power supply, and ensure that the current flows through the ITO slide. If the electrodes are in contact with aluminum, the power supply may indicate a short or have a high current. Look for a current from 0.15 A to 0.2 A at 10 V.Proceed to the next section on ODELAM microscope control.ODELAM microscope controlOpen the Visual Studio Code.Create a python terminal and activate the odelay virtual environment.Run the python file ODELAY microscopecontrol.py (e.g., python ODELAYmicroscopecontrol.py).Select the appropriate directories, files, and ODELAY experiment type for the experiment.",
    "Once the new graphical user interface has loaded, check to ensure the ROI layout on the microscope control panel matches that of the desired experiment (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4027/bioprotoc-11-10-4027-g004.jpgFigure 4. ODELAM microscope control interface and image display. The ODELAM microscope interface consists of a microscope control panel and an image display panel. An image of mycobacterium is displayed. The red circles in the control panel center indicate the ROIs that will be recorded, and the grey circles indicate the ROIs that will be ignored. Autofocus parameters for phase 1 and phase 2 are indicated and editable on the right. Camera exposure times are listed above the fluorescent cube selected.Start the camera by pressing the focus button.Move the stage to a spot in the upper left corner of the array, where cells are present.Focus the image and then move the upper left most ROI on the array (Spot E06 is the origin).Press the set origin button.Move to a ROI close to a leveling screw that has cells to focus on and use the leveling screw to focus the image.Repeat this step for all three leveling screws until the image is in focus at all three ROIs next to the leveling screws.Evaluate other ROIs and use the Autofocus 1 button to evaluate if those can be brought into focus by the default Autofocus parameters. Increase or decrease the Autofocus as needed to ensure all ROI can be found by the Autofocus settings (see Notes for additional Instructions).Press the ODELAY button to begin recording data.ODELAM Chamber SterilizationFill two small plastic containers (e.g., tip box lids) and one the size of the ODELAM chamber with LoPhene. Prepare the biological safety cabinet with LoPhene-soaked absorbent pads as a working surface.After the experiment, remove the chamber from the microscope. Check for leaks. If necessary, apply disinfectant.",
    "Remove the copper contacts using the 3/32 hex driver and place the contact and screws in an appropriate storage container.Move the chamber to the biological safety cabinet.Use the 1/16-inch driver to remove the 10 flat head and button head screws from the bottom plate.After removing each screw, drop them into one of the two tip box lids with LoPhene.Gently but firmly, pry the bottom plate and gasket from the base plate. Do not use a tool for this as it could damage the gasket or either plate. Take your time as the silicon will stick to two plates together but will slowly release with firm but constant pressure.Gently pry the agarose slide from the gasket and place the slide in the second tip box filled with LoPhene. Make sure LoPhene completely covers the agar. Usually, some condensation forms on the edges of the slide at this point. Avoid touching it and clean the gloves thoroughly as they can become contaminated with Mtb at this point.Completely separate the bottom gasket from the bottom plate and place both in the plastic container filled with LoPhene. Make sure each part is covered.Repeat Steps G5-G7 for the top plate. Gently but with constant and firm pressure, pry the top plate and top gasket from the base plate.Remove the ITO coated slide and place it in the tip box lid with the screws. Ensure the ITO slide is immersed in LoPhene.Separate the top gasket from the top plate and the top plate, top gasket, and base plate into the plastic container with LoPhene. Add extra LoPhene if needed to cover all parts completely.After approximately 15-20 min, remove the agarose slide from the LoPhene. Place the agarose into a solid waste disposal within the hood and glass slide in the sharp container.",
    "Dump the LoPhene that the agarose slide was in into a liquid waste container.Spray LoPhene on the other containers and remove them from the biological safety cabinet.Wash all parts and screws with generous amounts of deionized water to remove the LoPhene. Finally, spray all parts with 70% ethanol and dry with a paper towel.Store the disassembled chamber for future use."
