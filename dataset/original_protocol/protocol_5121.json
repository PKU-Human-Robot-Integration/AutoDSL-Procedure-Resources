    "Note: Chronic social defeat stress experiments must comply with governmental and institutional guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. Screening of CD-1 aggressor miceOrder male CD-1 retired breeder mice at 4-6 months of age (order at least 2-3 times more than required, as less than half of CD-1 mice will be aggressive enough). CD-1 mice should be singly housed in standard mouse cages with access to food and water ad libitum. Allow CD-1 mice to habituate to their new environment for a week prior to initiating screening process. C57BL/6J ‘screener’ male mice are used only to screen CD-1 mice. The screener mice can range in age (8-20 weeks) and can be used for subsequent screening processes. Remove any aggressive ‘screener’ mice (rare).Screening of CD-1 mice is performed in the cage of the resident CD-1 mouse. C57BL/6J ‘screener’ mouse should be placed directly into home cage with aggressor CD-1 mouse for 5 min. Latency to aggression should be noted for each CD-1. Perform three screening sessions for 3 consecutive days (once daily) with different screeners.CD-1 aggressor mice should be selected based on two criteria: During three 5-min screening sessions, the latency to initial aggression must be less than 60 sec during two consecutive sessions. And the CD-1 must continuously attack the C57BL/6J screener mouse for at least 10 sec without interruption for all the three 5-min sessions.House CD-1 aggressor mice selected for experimentation with access to food and water ad libitum (ready to use). Aggressor mice can be used for up to 3 months after initial screening (CD-1 aggressor mice can habituate to social defeat sessions, and thus need to be rescreened prior to the next social defeat experiment).Chronic social defeat stress (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326202425_5648.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of social defeat and social interaction test.",
    "Chronic social defeat scheme uses 10-days of consecutive social defeat using CD-1 aggressor mice in the divided cages, followed by social interaction test and subsequent analysis.To assemble social defeat cages (Figure 2A), take standard rat cage and fill the bottom of cage with woodchip bedding. Place the perforated Plexiglas divider in the center of cage. Divider will physically separate the mice after defeat sessions and allow for sensory interaction during non-defeat housing periods. Place cylinder (additional water bottle holder) on side opposite of standard water bottle side. Insert assembled water bottle with cylindrical holder. Ensure that water is easily accessible. Place food on bottom of each side (water and food should be available ad libitum). Place lid of standard rat cage securely onto cage. At least 10 social defeat cages with CD-1 aggressors are needed for the 10-day social defeat protocol.Note: The divider should be firmly positioned to prevent escapes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326202538_8473.jpgFigure 2. Standard cage setup in chronic social defeat stress. A. Standard rat cage used in chronic social defeat stress sessions. The resident aggressor CD-1 mouse is permanently housed on one side of the perforated divider, while C57BL/6J mice are rotated each day following defeat session to avoid habituation to aggressor mouse. B. Dimensions of additional parts for standard rat cage (custom made). The Cylinder holds an additional water bottle on side opposite of standard water bottle side. The perforated Plexiglas divider physically separates mice during non-social defeat periods (perforations allow for sensory interaction).Place resident CD-1 aggressor mouse on one side of the divided home cage overnight prior to the start of social defeat sessions for habituation in the new cage.Note: The cylinder side is preferred for efficient defeats in smaller space.",
    "On the first day of social defeat sessions, place intruder C57BL/6J mouse directly into the cage side of CD-1 aggressor mouse. After 5-10 min of social defeat (Video 1), transfer the intruder mouse to opposite side of perforated divider and house within compartment for the remainder of the 24-h period.Note: Placing intruder mouse close to the aggressor at session start is helpful to initiate aggressive behaviors. Social defeat stress may be done with up to 10 subject mice at a time to allow close observation.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. A bout of aggression in social defeat by CD-1 aggressor. Approximately 3 to 5 bouts of consecutive aggressive behaviors can be observed during a social defeat period.For the control group, place C57BL/6J mice pairs in an identical social defeat cage set up with one mouse on each side of perforated Plexiglas divider for the duration of the 10-day social defeat test without any physical contact. The mice are rotated daily between control cages (‘intruder’ side only).Repeat daily social defeat sessions in a novel CD-1 aggressors’ homecage for 10 days.Immediately following the last social defeat session, singly house all C57BL/6J intruder mice. Provide animals with ad libitum access to food and water. All CD-1 aggressor mice are returned to their singly-housed cages and used for future social defeat experiments (need to be rescreened).Social interaction testSocial interaction tests can be performed 24 h after the last social defeat session. In the social interaction test, the CD-1 aggressor mouse should be completely novel to the defeated C57BL/6J mouse being tested. Screen the CD-1 aggressor mouse prior to performing social interaction test to ensure mouse meets criterion for aggression.Assemble social interaction arenas as shown in Figure 3. Set up video-tracking system (e.g., EthoVision XT) to collect all data automatically by tracking software.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326202903_5519.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Schematics of the social interaction test arena. A. Social defeat open field arena and zones for social interaction analysis. B. Removable, perforated Plexiglas enclosure for ‘target’ CD-1 aggressor mice.Habituate defeated C57BL/6J mice to behavioral testing suite at least 1 h prior to social interaction test (under red light condition, isolated from external noise sources and animals). Each social interaction test is composed of two 2.5 min phases under red light condition. In the first phase (‘target’ absent), place the C57BL/6J defeated mouse into the social interaction arena (at the center of opposite side to the enclosure) and allow to explore freely without a ‘target’ CD-1 mouse.Note: Do not clean the arena after the first phase.After the first phase, return the defeated C57BL/6J mouse back to its home cage until the second phase. Then, place the ‘target’ CD-1 mouse directly into the removable enclosure.Note: Drop the CD-1 mouse gently from top of the enclosure.In the second phase (‘target’ present), reintroduce the defeated C57BL/6J mouse and let it move freely around in the presence of the ‘target’ CD-1 mouse. Note: Place the defeated mice in a consistent manner between phases.At the end of each test session, remove the target and defeated mouse and place them into their home cage. Sanitize all equipment using cleaning solution. Data can be analyzed as discussed in Data analysis section."
