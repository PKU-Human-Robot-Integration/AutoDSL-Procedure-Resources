    "Production of HBVcc Detach and count HepG2-NTCPsec+ cells.Place the cells (5 × 107 cells resuspended with 2–5 mL HepG2-NTCPsec+ culture medium) into a 50 mL conical tube.Prepare the transfection mixture in 50 mL conical tubes (Table 1).Table 1. Composition of transfection reagent table:\n﻿Reagent,Amount\nMixture A,\nOpti-MEM I reduced serum medium,2 mL\nHBV molecular clone plasmid (2 μg/μL),40 μL\nP3000 enhancer reagent (included in Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent kit),80 μL\nMixture B,\nOpti-MEM I reduced serum medium,2 mL\nLipofectamine 3000 reagent,80 μL",
    "Mix the prepared mixtures A and B and incubate for 5 min following the manufacturer’s protocol.Transfer the generated mixture into HepG2-NTCPsec+ cells in the 50 mL conical tube and mix well by vortex.Seed the transfected cells into a collagen-coated T225 flask with 45 mL of HepG2-NTCPsec+ culture medium.One day after transfection, wash the transfected and seeded cells with 12 mL of PBS three times and add 45 mL of HepG2-NTCPsec+ culture medium with 2% DMSO. The addition of DMSO improves the yield of HBVcc.Culture the transfected cells for an additional seven days, monitoring HBsAg levels in the culture medium by the automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system (Murayama et al., 2019) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4779/bioprotoc-13-14-4779-g002.jpgFigure 2. Production of HBsAg in the culture medium of hepatitis B virus (HBV) molecular clone-transfected cells. HBsAg levels in the culture medium of the HBV molecular clone-transfected cells were monitored. A time-dependent increase was observed.Eight days after transfection, harvest the culture medium into a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge (2,380× g, 5 min, 4 °C) to precipitate the cell debris.Pass the culture medium through a 0.45 μm syringe-top filter unit to remove cell debris.Concentrate the culture medium approximately 30-fold by centrifugation (2,380× g, 90 min, 4 °C) with Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (100 kDa) (Table 2). If the recovery rate is quite low, confirm that the centrifugal filter unit is intact, and the condition of the centrifugation is appropriate. The generated HBVcc in the culture medium can be stored at -80 °C before or after concentration.Table 2.

Preparation of stepwise iodixanol density gradient. Two milliliters each of the 40%–10% iodixanol solutions were layered. After that, the concentrated culture medium was put at the top of the iodixanol density gradient.Layer the concentrated culture medium (2–3 mL) on top of the 10%–40% iodixanol gradient.Centrifuge the culture medium on the gradient at 178,000× g for 16 h at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge apparatus with an SW-41 Ti rotor.After centrifugation, collect 500 μL of 20–22 fractions, depending on the volume of the layered concentrated culture medium, from the top of the density gradient. The collected HBVcc in the fractions can be stored at -80 °C.Take a 100 μL aliquot of each fraction and measure the weight of the 100 μL aliquot using the analytical balance to determine the density of each fraction.Dilute the collected fraction 200-fold with HepG2-NTCPsec+ culture medium and measure the HBsAg and HBcrAg levels for each fraction by the automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system as described in the manufacturer’s protocol (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4779/bioprotoc-13-14-4779-g004.jpgFigure 4. Profile of cell culture–generated hepatitis B virus (HBVcc) in an iodixanol density gradient. HBVcc in the culture medium was applied to an iodixanol density gradient, the titers of HBsAg and HBcrAg were measured in each fraction, and the HBV DNA titer was quantified by real-time PCR.Treat the 50 μL of diluted fraction with DNase (RQ1 RNase-free DNase) at a concentration of 50 unit/mL, 37 °C, 1 h. Extract the total DNA using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.",
