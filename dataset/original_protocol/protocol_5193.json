    "Transwell permeability assayGrow 2 x 105 HMEC-1 cells in 300 µl endothelial growth medium on the membrane of each 6.5 mm transwell insert (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170501/20170501204005_7742.jpgFigure 1. A schematic outline procedure and typical results of transwell permeability assayFill the 24-well plate with 1 ml endothelial growth medium.Transfer the inserts to the wells with medium by using forceps, and then cover the plate with the lid. The sterilization of the forceps is not necessary, although treating with 80% ethanol is recommended. Incubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator for two days.  Aspirate the medium from the top and bottom chamber, then replace with the same volume of fresh Medium 200 medium as described above. Note: Every movement in this step should be done carefully and slowly as to not activate the endothelial cells. Pipet tips should not touch the membrane. Refill the chambers with fresh medium in a dropwise manner to avoid shear flow.Put the plate back into the 37 °C incubator for another two days.Move the inserts to empty wells with forceps, and wait for 5 min to observe whether medium from the upper chambers leaks into the lower chamber. If there is no leak, then proceed to the next steps. If there is a leak repeat steps A6-A7 and wait till the cells are confluent. The endothelial cells must be fully confluent to ensure the formation of cell-cell junctions and a good endothelial barrier. In general, the cells form confluent monolayer after 5 days of incubation.Repeat step A5 and add the desired stimulation to the medium in the top chambers. The stimulation can be cytokines (TNF-α), molecules which induce inflammatory responses (lipopolysaccharide, histamine), or recombinant proteins (thrombin, dengue virus nonstructural protein 1).Incubate the plate in the 37 °C incubator for desired time period.",
    "This assay works best when the cells are stimulated between 10 min to 24 h. Here we show the result of stimulating the endothelial cells with thrombin for 30 min (Figure 1).Before measuring the permeability of the endothelial monolayer, prepare medium containing streptavidin-HRP (15 µl streptavidin-HRP per 1 ml of serum-free medium).Aspirate medium in top chambers and refill them with streptavidin-HRP-containing medium. Note: As mentioned in step A6, every movement should be gentle and careful, and pipet tips should not touch the membrane.    Add 1 ml serum-free medium in each well of a new 24-well plate. And then put the inserts in.Cover the plate, and place the plate in the 37 °C incubator.After incubation for 5 min, the inserts are removed, and 20 µl of media from the lower chamber is transferred to a new 96-well plate. Every condition should be aliquoted in triplicate.  Add 50 µl TMB substrate into each well of the 96-well plate, and wait 5 min at room temperature for the reaction to stabilize. After incubation, TMB substrate should turn blue. If there is no change in the color, extend the incubation time. However, the incubation time should not exceed 20 min.Add 25 µl stop solution into each well, and acquire the absorption at 450 nm with an ELISA reader. A schematic outline procedure and typical results are shown in Figure 1.RTCAGrow 1 x 104 HMEC-1 cells in each well of a 96-well E-plate, and fill the well with 100 µl of endothelial growth medium.Place the plate in the xCELLigence RTCA System, which is set up in a 37 °C incubator.Set the program to detect the resistance every hour and monitor when the cells have grown to confluency.",
    "In general, the cells grow to confluency after incubating for 2 days, so we suggest checking the cell index curve after 36 h of incubation.After the cell index curve stabilizes, refresh the medium, and wait 2 h for the cell index curve to stabilize again.Add the desired stimulation into each well. Every condition should be done in triplicate.Put the plate back into the xCELLigence RTCA System in the 37 °C incubator.Set up the desired detection period and time interval, and start the recording.The typical results of RTCA are shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170501/20170501204233_2006.jpgFigure 2.
