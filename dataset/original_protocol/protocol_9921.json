    "The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Wright State University, and informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the experiment.\n1. Subject preparation\nPower up the FD-fNIRS and DCS system to warm up for at least 10 min (see sections 2 and 3 for more details) before starting any measurements of the subject. An example of subject measurement with the compact DCS instrument is shown in Figure 1.\nFirst, use a tape measure to measure the distance between the nasion to inion on each subject’s head (Figure 2A).\nWith the nasion as the starting point, mark the location that is 10% of the distance to the inion with an ink marker. This denotes the point between Fp1 and Fp2 of the EEG 10/20 montage (Figure 2A).\nUsing an EEG 10/20 cap (see Table of Materials), adjust the cap so that the marked point is between Fp1 and Fp2.\nMark the point between Fp1 and F7 (left cortex) and the point between Fp2 and F8 (right cortex). This represents the boundaries between the superior prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC) and between the DLFC and inferior prefrontal cortex (IFC), respectively, for the left and right hemispheres (Figure 2A).\nUsing a 3D-printed probe, place the multi-mode fibers (MMF) on the newly marked points (points “S” on Figure 2C) and connect each to the 785 nm laser light source (Figure 2B,C).\nPlace the single-mode fibers (SMFs) 2.75 cm away from the MMF. Two fibers should be placed on the DLFC (locations “DLFC,1” and “DLFC,2”) and one on the IFC (location “IFC”). The placement of the SMF is replicated on each side of the cortex for a total of six SMFs (Figure 2c).",
    "Place another SMF 1 cm below the MMF at location “Ds” in both sides of the cortex (for the detection of blood flow in the scalp) and connect each of the SMFs to individual single-photon counting machines (Figure 2C).\np class=\"jove_title\">2. FD-fNIRS settings and calibration\nTurn off any lights and turn on the FD-fNIRS system to prepare for calibration.\n\tCAUTION: As a general precaution, do not look directly at the light sources and fiber outputs, as this may cause eye damage. Use an IR sensor card (Table of Materials).\nAvoid unnecessary exposure of the detectors to room light levels to maintain noise-free operation and avoid damage to the detectors.\nWarm the light sources and detectors by powering up the system and letting it run for at least 10 min (preferably, 20 min minimum and 1 h maximum for optimal accuracy and stability) with the light on, modulation on, and detector voltage on.\nRun GUI-based data acquisition software. Adjust the detector gain to achieve an optimal signal with the sensor attached and secured to a calibration phantom (polydimethylsiloxane-based phantom of known optical properties, see Table of Materials) by pressing the “auto-bias” button. If the overvoltage warning flashes, lower the gain.\nAfter adjusting the detector gain to get the maximum signal, disconnect one of the source fibers from the detector and verify that the direct current (DC) is less than 20 counts per measurement period for the corresponding source fiber. If it is greater than this value, there may be excessive room light leaking into the detector45. If this is the case, the system should be powered down, then any excess light in the room should be blocked/removed and steps 2.4–2.5 repeated.",
    "Verify the proper signal level from every source and detector. The system defines this as above 100 and below 1,500 counts per measurement cycle.\nPerform calibration by pressing the “Calibrate” button in the GUI. The system will take measurements and apply calibration factors to correctly measure the optical properties of the known phantom. These calibration factors are saved and applied automatically to the in vivo measurements.\nLog the calibration data, which will provide a record of system performance on a standard phantom.\n3. DCS settings\nCAUTION: As a general precaution, do not look at the light sources and fiber outputs directly to avoid potential eye damage. Use the IR sensor card (see Table of Materials).\nAvoid unnecessary exposure of the detectors (i.e., room light) to obtain accurate raw data for the autocorrelation curves and prevent damage to the detectors.\nWarm up the DCS laser light sources and SPCM (see Table of Materials) by switching them to the “on” position and allowing them to run for at least 10 min (preferably, 20 min minimum and 1 h maximum for optimal accuracy and stability).\nRun GUI-based DCS data acquisition software, which displays the photon counts for each detector and semi-quantitative real-time blood flow values. Adjust the fiber position, angle (fiber face should be perpendicular to the skin surface), and data acquisition timing to obtain a signal of at least 5,000 counts/s (for an adequate signal to noise ratio) and below 1,000,000 counts/s (to avoid damaging detectors) (Figure 3A).\nVerify sufficient photon count levels (from step 3.3) from each detector by checking the photon count level and near real-time autocorrelation curves shown on the monitor.",
    "Verify sufficient fiber contact without any ambient light leakage by checking the y-intercept of the autocorrelation curve displayed on the monitor. The optimal value is ~1.5 without the use of polarizers (Figure 3B).\nVerify that the probe and measurements are not prone to motion artifacts by tightening the elastic band so that it is tight enough to resist motion but loose enough to prevent any discomfort to the subject. The user should also check the autocorrelation curves on the monitor concurrently such that the autocorrelation curve decays to 1 for longer correlation time (τ > 10 ms) (Figure 3C).\n4. Data collection\nInstruct the subject to minimize any movements during the 8 min measurement.\nTurn off the lights and make sure that the subject is seated in a comfortable position with his/her eyes closed.\nPerform a baseline FD-fNIRS measurements using by placing the FD-fNIRS system optical probe on the forehead adjacent to the DCS probe. Then, press the “Acquire” button in the FD-fNIRS acquisition GUI. This data will provide static optical properties, absorption parameters, and scattering parameters (μa, μ's) that will be used for quantification of the dynamic optical parameter, CBFi17,20.\nAfter completion of the FD-fNIRS measurements, begin data acquisition on the optical DCS measurements by pressing the “Run” button in the DCS data acquisition GUI. Collect data for a total of 8 min with a maximum 2 s integration time (less is preferred, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio for each subject).\nIf necessary, repeat the experiment within 1 h of the initial experiment or repeat the experiment during a similar time of day to reduce external variations such as fatigue, stimulants, or temperature.\n5. Data analysis\nFor FD-fNIRS data, extract the optical absorption and scattering properties (μa, μ's) that are processed by the slope method46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53.",
    "For DCS, since post-processing is needed, import the auto-correlation raw data from each of the eight channels into the data analysis software.\nCBF-related parameter quantification is detailed in recent reviews6,27,54. Briefly, from the normalized intensity autocorrelation function (g2 [r,τ]), extract the normalized diffuse electric field temporal autocorrelation function (g1 [r,τ]) using the Siegert relation: g2 (r,τ) = 1 + β | g 1 (r,τ)|2.\n\tNOTE: β is a constant, proportional to the number of spatial modes detected6,17,27,55,56, ranges from 0 to 1, and obtained by fitting the (normalized) electric field autocorrelation function g1.\nTo obtain a blood flow-related parameter (αDB) from the fit, use the analytical solution for g16,27,54 and fit the data to the model or decay rate:\n\tEQUATION ONE\n\tNOTE: In the equation above, ko is the wavenumber of light in the medium, α is a factor proportionate to tissue blood volume fraction, and DB is the effective Brownian coefficient. αDB can be defined as the blood flow index (BFI)6,54 or CBFi17. Here, CBFi is used.\nFit the model using the optical parameters obtained from FD-fNIRS. The main parameters to fit for are CBFi and β.\n\tNOTE: Figure 3A shows representative data that is sufficient for analysis. DCS data is discarded if (1) the autocorrelation function is significantly lower that 1.5 (β < 0.5) (i.e., in the case of Figure 3B, where the function is ~1.2, β < 0.2, due to room light leakage) or if (2) the autocorrelation curve does not decay to 1 for longer correlation time (τ > 10 ms) (i.e., in the case of Figure 3C, where the motion artifact, such head or probe movement, leads to unusable data).\nDetrend the quantified results using a second-order polynomial fit to remove slow drift (Figure 4A).",
    "Use a zero-phase second-order Butterworth filter with a passband of 0.009–0.080 Hz to remove any unwanted brain frequencies such as Mayer waves (Figure 4A).\nUse linear regression to obtain the residuals from each channel against the short distance measurement to remove the superficial scalp signals on each side of the cortex (Figure 4B).\nCalculate the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between each pair of channels to identify the resting state functional connectivity between brain regions (Figure 5).\nTransform the correlation value into a z-value using a Fisher Z transformation and perform a t-test to obtain the p-value (Figure 5). Use false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparisons correction.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
