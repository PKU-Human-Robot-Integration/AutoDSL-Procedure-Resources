    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nElectrophysiological Detection of Hemichannels in Neurons in Acute Brain Slices\nTiming: 5–6 h\nThis protocol provides a method for testing using electrophysiology whether changes in CO2 levels can modulate neuronal excitability.\nMaking recordings from identified neurons in acute brain slices\nPerfuse the recording bath (2–3 mL/min) with the 35 mmHg CO2 buffer (bubbled with 95% O2 /5% CO2) and allow to reach recording temperature (~30 ˚C).\nPlace brain slice in the bath (hold in place using a slice hold down for example, Multichannel systems #64-1418) and allow to equilibrate for 10–15 min\nMake patch clamp recording in current clamp mode from neuron(s) of interest. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for details of the process or refer to the axon guide (Molecular Devices, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) for a more thorough overview of the patch clamp technique.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/220-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Firstly, identify the neuron of interest using the brightfield image. Then using a glass pipette (5–7 MΩ resistance) approach the cell with positive pressure on the pipette. We monitor and control the pressure with our mouths, but it is also possible to use a syringe to apply pressure (but there is less control). Upon making contact with the target cell you should see a dimple form on the cell at the end of the pipette (as a result of the positive pressure). To monitor the resistance of the pipette and sealing, a square step voltage of 5-10 mV (at 1 Hz, as shown in A) is applied. The amplitude of the current response gives a measure of the resistance B) Once the dimple is observed, release the pressure and this will allow a high resistance seal to form between the end of the pipette and the cell membrane (some negative pressure may also need to be applied). Since I = V/R (Ohms law), as the resistance of the pipette goes up (as the pipette seals to the membrane), the current response will get smaller until the trace appears flat with only the pipette capacitance transients remaining (B). The seal resistance needs to be at least 1 GΩ but hopefully higher for a good recording (if the seal is poor then a new recording has to be made from a new cell, using a new pipette). The pipette transients can be zeroed off at this point. Increasing negative pressure is slowly applied to the pipette in order to rupture the cell membrane under the pipette and this allows break through into whole-cell. At this point the capacitance transients for the cell are detected (C).",
    "At this stage we would then move from voltage clamp into current clamp mode (the resting potential for a good recording will be ~−60 to −70 mV depending on cell type) (D). The contents of the patch pipette will start to dialyze into the cell and it is good to wait for 5–10 min for equilibration before starting recording. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for suggested recording protocols. Created in part with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com]",
    "Note: Any standard patch clamp electrophysiology rig can be used for this protocol. There are many possible options for rig set up, but for clarity our slices were visualized using IR-DIC optics with an Olympus BX151W microscope (Scientifica, Bedford UK) and a CCD camera (Hitachi). Voltage recordings were made using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA) and digitized at 20 KHz (Digidata 1440A; Molecular devices, USA). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices, USA).\nNote: Patch pipettes (5–10 MΩ) were manufactured from thick walled glass (Multichannel systems).\nNote: Use any standard intracellular patch solution for making recordings. We use and would recommend the following composition: 135 mM potassium gluconate, 7 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 2 mM MgATP, and 0.3 mM NaGTP (293 mOsm, pH 7.2).\nNote: Always ensure intracellular solution is filtered directly before use.\nCarry out the standard IV protocol (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) to check the health of the neuron, seal stability and identity (resting membrane potential, firing pattern) and allow cell to equilibrate for 5 min. Can also inject naturalistic current to measure firing rate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/220-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Suggested Stimulation Protocols\nIn our experiments we run three different current input protocols in order to fully assess the effects of the CO2 sensitivity on neural function.\n(A) The first is a repeated hyperpolarizing step of −50 pA, for 100 ms, delivered every second. This is given continuously and can therefore provide a measure of the voltage response and input resistance over time.",
    "(B) The second is a standard stepwise current voltage (IV) protocol, often referred to as a SIV protocol. The current steps to use and the voltage response will depend on the cell type that you are recording from. Here is an example from a CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron, where current steps from −300 pA increasing by 50 pA have been introduced. The protocol should be run until a regular firing pattern is induced. This can be used to assess cell identity and health and to measure resting membrane potential and input resistance (from the current steps around the membrane potential).\n(C) The third current injection protocol (as used to produce a dynamic IV) injects a naturalistic current into the cell (top panel) and the voltage recorded (bottom panel) can be used to extract to determine the firing rate under a naturalistic state (for more detail, see Badel et al, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Harrison et al, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; used in the DIV protocol).

(2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; eNeuro on a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nCritical: Monitor the bridge balance/ series resistance across recordings to ensure stability. Any recordings where this diverges by more than 20% over the period of recording should be disregarded.\nBegin running current steps (50 pA hyperpolarizing step, 1s interval; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) so you can monitor the input resistance of recorded neuron.\nGenerate a baseline of current steps over 10–15 min.\nChanging the level of CO2 to open or close hemichannels\nChange perfusion of the slice from 35 mmHg CO2 buffer to either 55 mmHg CO2 buffer (to open hemichannels) or to 20 mmHg CO2 buffer (to close hemichannels)\nContinue running current steps for at least 10–15 min\nOnce stable, carry out standard IV and inject naturistic current injections to measure firing rate.",
    "Optional: Change perfusion of slice back to 35 mmHg CO2 buffer to attempt reversal of the effect. Note that this can be quite challenging.\nRun current steps for a further 10–15 min\nNote: Ensure that you save all SIV, firing rate traces, and sweep files of the current steps for analysis. A measure of the size of the voltage response can be taken from each step. Steps can be averaged easily in time-bins if required in Clampfit. SIV measurements can be used to measure resting membrane potential and input resistance and the voltage response to the naturalistic current injection can give a measure of the cells firing.\nNote: In our study we chose to record in current clamp (recording the cell’s membrane potential) as this allowed us to run the SIV protocol to validate cell type at the start of recording and also inject naturalistic current to look at firing. This protocol could also be used to record the current directly (in voltage clamp), although additional stimulation protocols will need to be used.\nDye Loading of Neurons through Hemichannel Opening\nTiming: 5–6 h\nThis protocol outlines the fluorescent imaging of neurons that express CO2 sensitive hemichannels by trapping a cell impermeant dye (which can move through open hemichannels). The protocol is simplified in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/220-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Simplified Schematic of the Dye Loading Protocol",
    "A slice is transferred to the recording chamber, submerged, and perfused with control aCSF (35 mmHg CO2) at 30°C. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings can be used to confirm the identity of the target region of cells. Slices were then allowed to equilibrate for 20 min. The control aCSF was then exchanged for 55 mmHg CO2 aCSF (hypercapnic) containing 5(6)-carboxy-fluorescein (CBF, 100 μM) for 20 min to allow the CO2 sensitive-hemichannels to open. The solution was then exchanged for 35 mmHg CO2 aCSF containing CBF (100 μM) for 5 min to allow the hemichannels to close. Finally, the slice was washed with 35 mmHg CO2 aCSF for 3 h to reduce the background staining before imaging. The dye loading method is based on that described in Huckstepp et al (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]. Created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com]\nPreparing a slice for the dye loading of neurons\nPerfuse recording bath with the 35 mmHg CO2 (control) buffer (bubbled with 95% O2 /5% CO2) and allow to reach recording temperature.\nPlace brain slice in the bath and allow to equilibrate for at least 15 min. Researcher could make initial recordings from neurons or use landmarks to ensure that they are imaging the correct region of the slice.\nNote: If performing dye-loading experiments following electrophysiology, you could potentially include in your pipette solution a different membrane impermeable dye so that you could identify with dye loading the neurons you recorded from and found to be sensitive to CO2 changes.\nOpening hemichannels\nThe control buffer is exchanged for 55 mmHg CO2 aCSF buffer (hypercapnic) containing 5(6)-carboxy-fluorescein (CBF, 100 μM) for 20 min to allow the CO2-sensitive hemichannels to open.\nClosing hemichannels and trapping dye\nSolution is exchanged for 35 mmHg CO2 buffer containing CBF (100 μM) for 5 min to allow the hemichannels to close, trapping the dye inside.",
    "Solution is exchanged to 35 mmHg CO2 aCSF without the dye for at least for 3 h to reduce the background staining before imaging.\nImaging of filled cells\nImages are taken using a CCD camera with 488 nm fluorescence (CoolLED). As CBF rapidly bleaches, images need to be quickly acquired from regions of interest. CBF cannot be fixed using PFA (as it lacks the required groups for cross-linking).\nCritical: Do all the dye loading without the microscope light on to avoid bleaching. Prolonged washing of the dye is required for brain slices compared to use of cultured cells or cell lines due to the thickness of the tissue. The dye rapidly bleaches so it is important to take the images rapidly.\nNote: A suitable control is to not change the buffer from 35 mmHg CO2 and show neurons do not dye load. It is also possible to block dye loading with carbenoxolone (100 μM; an indiscriminate hemichannel blocker) to further show that the effects are hemichannel mediated.\nNote: We use CBF as we know it passes through connexin 26 hemichannels. It is not fixable with PFA as it lacks the required groups for cross-linking. There may be other dyes that can pass through the hemichannels and can be fixed. A trial and error approach would have to be used to discover such dyes.\nImmunohistochemistry to Confirm Connexin Expression Profile\nThis protocol outlines how to confirm the connexin expression profile of your region of interest, as further evidence of the observed effects being mediated by CO2-sensitive hemichannels (in this case Cx26, see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: For the best results with immunohistochemistry, mice/ rats should be cardiac perfused 4% PFA and then post-fixed overnight at 4 ˚C (18–24 h).\nThe slices are then washed 5 times in PBS.",
    "They are then blocked for 1 h (1% BSA, 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS, 400 μL per slice).\nThe slices are washed 5 times in PBS.\nThe primary antibodies: a marker for your cell of interest (at required concentration; Green 488) and an antibody against connexin 26 (1:200, Mouse; Red 594) are added to the slices (400 μL per slice) for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C) on a shaker and then kept at 4°C–8°C overnight (12–16 h) static in the fridge.\nSlices are washed five times for 5 min with PBS.\nThe corresponding secondary antibodies are then added (400 μL per slice) for 4 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nNote: Cover the plate in foil after addition of the secondary antibodies to avoid contact with light. Maintain all further steps in as little light as possible.\nThe slices are washed 5 times with PBS\nSlices are mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector laboratories, Peterborough UK) and stored in foil at 4 ˚C until imaging.\nNote: The earlier the imaging can be done following mounting the better. All our imaging was completed within 2 weeks of the initial immunohistochemistry to ensure the best staining.\nNote: Any standardized protocol for imaging can be used. The immunohistochemistry protocol will need to be optimized for the antibodies that you are using and the cells of interest. We image with a Leica 880 confocal microscope and perform image acquisition and processing in the Zen black software suite."
