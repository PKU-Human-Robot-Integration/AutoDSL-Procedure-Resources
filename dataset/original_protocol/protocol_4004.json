Furthermore, efficiency of infection, measured as the time required for complete lysis of a bacterial culture by the virus, is also a crucial feature to be monitored in virus adaptation studies and is actually incorporated in our protocol (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for a schematic depiction of the complete experimental procedure):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/967-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Bacteriophage T7 evolution experiments, lysis curve determinations, and genomic DNA extraction\nDepiction of the general protocol for characterizing T7 adaptation to the new host, including pfu determinations based on plaque assays and lysis profiles of the evolved phages. In addition, a final step including DNA extraction allows for new generation sequencing of viral genome. Figure adapted from Luzon-Hidalgo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nBacteriophage T7 evolution experiments\nTiming: 2 days per round of adaptation\nThree parallel experiments are followed up in our evolution rounds (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): propagation of evolved T7 in the engineered and in the original hosts (panel A) and a control experiment in which wild type T7 infection in the original host is monitored (panel B). The general scheme of evolution experiments can be represented as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/967-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Description of infections performed in a typical evolution experiment\n(A) The amplified T7 stock is used to infect the new host. The resulting evolved T7 suspension, V1, inoculates both the original and the engineered hosts. The new evolved T7 suspension, V2, is subjected to a new round of evolution.\n(B) Control experiment to monitor the infection of original host with wild type T7.",
    "V 0 ⇒ V 1  →  R 1   V 2  →  R 2   V 3  →  R 3   V 4  →  R 4    ⋯ ⋯  \nAmplified phage stock from step 4d of before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section, V0, is actually the starting point for evolution experiments. The titer should be within the 109–1011 pfu/mL range, as quantified according to step 8b of the same section.\nLet the wild type virus sample infect the engineered host (E. coli Trx- complemented with a plasmid encoding for the ancestral thioredoxin). To this purpose, a plaque assay as described in steps 5–7 of before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section should be carried out. Thus, successive ten-fold dilutions of phage suspension are used to inoculate our engineered host culture following the same protocol described previously.\nNote: Typically, high wild-type phage dilutions, above 10−3–10−4, do not infect efficiently the engineered host in the first/second rounds. Therefore, plating those dilutions might not be required at this point since a bacterial lawn will develop, and no plaques will be observed.\nNote: Do not forget to add kanamycin to LB media, 30 μg/mL final concentration, as the engineered host strain carries antibiotic resistance gene.\nNote: A number of routine controls should be set up including: control to verify LB broth + kanamycin sterility (no growth should be observed after overnight or 15 hours incubation of media); control for engineered host growth in the absence of infection (a typical bacterial growth curve is expected to be obtained); and a negative control of phage infection using FA41 cured cells without plasmid complementation (in the absence of thioredoxin, T7 infection should not be successful).",
    "For this first infection, plaques show up only occasionally at the highest phage concentrations. Thus, it is advisable to set around 10 plate replicates for those concentrations to assure obtaining a minimum number of plaques. Incubate the plates overnight or for 15 h.\nProceed with pfu quantification as explained in step 8 of before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section.\nPlaques size is remarkably small, reflecting the fact that propagation at this point (double-line arrow in the previous scheme) is inefficient. Pick a single, well-isolated plaque (the bigger the better) by using an inoculation loop. Then resuspend the plaque into a 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of phage dilution buffer, vortex gently and let it stand at 25°C for two hours, to allow phage particles to diffuse towards the solution (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). This first plaque suspension actually corresponds to phage suspension V1 in previous scheme and Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. It is obtained from the initial propagation of wild type T7 in the new host and is used for the first evolution round R1 (scheme, Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/967-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic representation for phage stock preparation from a plaque\nNote: To remove the plaque from the plate, use a thin inoculation loop to carefully excise the actual piece of soft agar (solidified on top of the standard agar plate) containing the plaque. It should come out easily after gently stabbing the top agar around the plaque.\nNote: If you are not going to use the phage immediately after the two-hour diffusion step, keep the suspension at 4°C for the day or freeze it.\nNote: V1 could be also used as starting point for lysis profile determinations (see Determination of lysis profile for the evolved phage section below).",
    "Note: Infection of V0 with the original host (FA41 cells complemented with E. coli thioredoxin) must be also carried out in parallel, as mentioned before (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). This control is crucial in order to extract future conclusions regarding the performance of wild type and evolved phages. To this purpose, repeat steps 2 to 5 of this section.\nNote: Plaques resulting from the first infection of the engineered host are clearly smaller and display a different morphology when compared with those from the original host. In particular, the typical circular shape is not so well defined, presenting irregular borders.\nFirst round of phage evolution, R1, is initiated with standard plaque assays, as previously described, where V1 stock infects both, the engineered host and the original host, in parallel experiments (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). We are interested in following up infectivity of evolved phages in the two hosts to gain experimental evidence on the virus adaptation mechanism.\nTake 100 μL directly from the top agar suspension V1 and prepare serial dilutions as indicated in step 6 of phage plaque assay for titer determination[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section.\nPerform the two plaque assays in parallel, using the different phage dilutions to inoculate the engineered and the original hosts, respectively, according to steps 7a and 7b of the cited section.\nPlate the resulting suspensions (steps 7c, 7d).\nQuantify pfu/mL (step 8 of phage plaque assay for titer determination[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section) for both infections. The comparison between pfu/mL results for both infections is a measurement of the capability of the evolved virus to propagate in the two hosts.\nNote: Take pictures of plates to compare morphology and size of plaques.",
    "The new evolved phage suspension, V2, for the next round of evolution is obtained from an appropriate plaque of the engineered host infection, following step 5 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) in the current section.\nNote: Evolved phage stock V2 is used for lysis profiles determinations (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), according to next section.\nRepeat as many evolution rounds as required.\nNote: A second round of evolution for the wild type phage (control experiment) infecting the original host should be also performed in parallel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPlot log10 pfu/mL values versus rounds of evolution. As shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], after the second round adaptation of evolved phage to the engineered host takes place. Furthermore, the size and the number of plaque forming units increase reaching typical values measured for the infection of the original host. This surprising result reveals not only a fast adaptation of the phage but also a promiscuous adaptation, meaning that infective virions from evolved phage sample are capable of replicating in both, the engineered and the original hosts.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/967-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Results of plaque assays over several rounds of laboratory evolution\n(A) Pictures showing the increase in size and number of plaques along with rounds of adaptation of T7 to the engineered host.\n(B) Number of plaque forming units for virus samples from two laboratory evolution experiments, using the engineered host (red) and the original host (blue). A control experiment where wild type T7 inoculates the original host is also shown (black). Figure taken from Luzon-Hidalgo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].",
    "Note: Results presented in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B for two laboratory evolution experiments demonstrate host promiscuity of evolved T7 but they do not provide experimental evidence regarding the efficiency of virus replication. To shed light into this relevant aspect, determination of lysis profiles is also integrated in our protocol for assessment of virus evolution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nDetermination of the lysis profile for the evolved phage\nTiming: 1 day per round of adaptation\nPfu determinations based on plaque assays shed light on the capability of virion particles to propagate in a particular host although do not provide information on virus replication efficiency. Thus, we aim to address this issue by integrating in our experimental protocol, combined with plaque assays, the characterization of lysis profiles in liquid medium. Please note that both, plaque assays and lysis profile determinations, can be carried out alongside adaptation experiments as indicated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]:\nLeave a 5 mL bacterial pre-inoculum to grow overnight or for 15 h at 37°C, with shaking.\nNote: In fact, two parallel bacterial cultures corresponding to the engineered and the original hosts should be grown to be inoculated by the evolved T7 and the wild type T7, following the general scheme in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/967-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Determination of the lysis profile for the evolved phage\nUpper panel: Schematic representations of the different infections carried out. Control experiments for negative infection of thioredoxin minus cells (knock-out) with T7 are also included. Lower panel: experimental profiles of turbidity versus time obtained for each infection, according to color code. Figures adapted from Luzon-Hidalgo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nNote: In addition, a pre-inoculum of the knock-out thioredoxin minus cells (FA41 F- strain without plasmid complementation) should be grown to be used as a control of negative infection.",
    "Transfer 350 μL of the overnight culture into 70 mL of fresh LB broth (1/200 dilution), with antibiotic if necessary, and let bacteria grow until an OD600nm of 0.25 is reached (typically after 2–3 h approximately).\nSplit up the bacterial culture into three tubes (20 mL each): one will be inoculated with evolved T7, another one with wild type T7 and the last one is set as a bacterial growth control (in the absence of virus).\nPhage infection starts when a volume of 150 μL of the corresponding phage stock is added to the bacterial culture from step 14.\nNote: For the evolved phage infection, use suspension V1 corresponding to the first round of viral adaptation.\nLeave the infection to proceed at 37°C with shaking.\nTake culture aliquots to monitor turbidity, OD600nm, as a function of time. The decrease in absorbance is taken as a measurement of cell lysis. Typically, measurements are carried out every 10, 15 or 30 min depending on the infectivity of the phage, until complete lysis.\nNote: It is advisable to prepare in advance a worksheet to keep track of raw data corresponding to parallel experiments, in an organized manner. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], as an example:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_967_8.csv\nPlot OD600 values versus time for each infection. Typical lysis profiles are shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], lower panel.\nNote: To avoid handling large volumes, microtiter plates can be used to monitor the lysis profiles. If so, please be aware that this may prevent the extraction of enough phage genomic DNA for NGS.\nOnce the cell lysis is completed, you can freeze these samples or extract phage DNA (see next section).\nPause point: At this point samples may be stored at −20°C and continue with DNA extraction another day.",
    "Repeat the above protocol (steps 13–20) to monitor lysis profiles for evolved phage suspensions V2, V3, V4, etc. obtained from successive evolution rounds (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: When performing lysis experiments for the first time, we recommend doing a “quick and dirty” experiment to estimate the time frame for complete lysis. Otherwise, you can run out of culture if too many turbidity measurements are taken.\nNote: Avoid bacterial debris when you withdraw media to make your absorbance measurements.\nPhage genomic DNA extraction\nTiming: 1 day per round of adaptation\nA step forward can be taken in order to tentatively elucidate the molecular bases for virus adaptation. We include here the protocol for genomic DNA extraction from lysed engineered host samples to be used for Illumina next generation sequencing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nAdd 0.1 mL of chloroform to 6 mL of virus lysate from step 20, at 25°C (thaw on ice if necessary). Vortex the mixture. Chloroform helps to separate DNA from bacterial lipids and proteins.\nCentrifuge at 4000 g, 10 min, 4°C.\nTake 1 mL of the supernatant to extract viral DNA and freeze the rest.\nWe use the phage DNA Isolation Kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. and follow its instructions. In the last step, DNA sample is eluted in 50 μL of water. To evaporate possible traces of organic solvents from the kit that might interfere with the sequencing process, leave the sample open at 50°C for 30 min. Typical yield obtained is within 3–15 μg DNA when starting from a 106–1010 pfu/mL enriched phage solution, in good agreement with specifications of the commercial kit. Moreover, the quality of the resulting DNA sample is appropriate for Illumina new generation sequencing of phage genome. Absorbance measurements were taken using a Nanodrop One spectrophotometer.",
    "Note: Please, be aware that the resulting phage DNA sample (50 μL of a concentration within 50–300 μg/mL) is extracted from 6 mL of virus lysate obtained according to steps 16–20.\nCritical: Lysis Buffer B from DNA Isolation Kit may cause eye or skin irritation and may be harmful if swallowed. Wear protective gloves, eye shields and clothing. If there is any skin or eye contact, wash with water for several minutes.\nPause point: At this point samples may be stored at −20°C and continue with agarose gel electrophoresis another day.\nFinally, the purity of the phage DNA is assessed by 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Mix 10 μL of DNA sample with 2 μL of loading dye and load 12 μL in each well. Run the gel at 100 V.\nNote: Include an appropriate molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel. T7 DNA is ∼40 Kb long (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/967-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.
