    "General preparationsCoating of cell culture vesselsMonolayer cultures as well as the differentiation of neurospheres require poly-D-lysine (PDL)/Laminin coated surfaces for attachment.Add the appropriate amount of PDL (5 µg/ml in ddH2O) and assure that the surface or the coverslips are fully covered (for volumes see Table 2).Incubate for at least 4 h or overnight at room temperature.Remove the solution and wash the vessels three times with ddH2O.Let them dry properly until no residual water remains.Add Laminin (5 µg/ml in cold DMEM/F-12) and incubate for at least 4 h or overnight at 37 °C.Either use them directly or store them at -20 °C until required.Fire polished pipettesDuring the isolation process, fire-polished pipettes with either small or medium size bores are required.Rotate the glass Pasteur pipettes for about 3 sec over a hot blue flame of a Bunsen burner until the edges become rounded. Small Pasteur pipettes show an internal diameter of 0.3-0.4 mm while the medium size bore of the pipettes measures approximately 0.6-0.8 mm.Pipettes should be autoclaved prior to use.Brain dissectionNote: Monolayer cultures require coated 24-well plates, which should be prepared at least two days prior to isolation.The protocol for neural precursor cell isolation is based on the protocols of Babu et al. (2011), Walker and Kempermann (2014) (which also includes a video of the dissection procedure) and Ehret et al. (2016). Neurosphere assays can be performed using one mouse per neurosphere experiment (per 96-well plate). Monolayer cultures can also be generated using a single mouse, however we recommend pooling 3-4 brains.Anesthetize 6-8 weeks old mice according to the appropriate institutional guidelines. Perform cervical dislocation.Spray the head with 70% ethanol to sterilize the area and to reduce the amount of fur adhering to the dissection tools and tissue.Decapitate the animal at the base of the brain stem using sharp scissors.",
    "Cut the skin sagittally along the midline approximately until a point between the eyes. Expose the skull.Place one blade of a small pair of scissors into each eye cavity to perform a coronal cut of the skull between the eyes. Afterwards, make two lateral cuts at the base of the skull, followed by a longitudinal cut along the sagittal suture.Expose the brain by peeling back the skull with a pair of forceps.Remove the brain from the skull by using a small spatula and place it into cold PBS.Transfer the brain into a 10 cm plastic Petri dish containing PBS (see Figure 1B).Place the Petri dish with the brains under a stereo microscope at low magnification and position the brain on its ventral surface. Remove the olfactory bulbs using fine angled forceps while holding the brain in position by the cerebellum.SVZ dissection Rotate the brain onto the dorsal aspect and make a coronal cut through the brain at the area of the optic chiasm using a scalpel (see Figure 1C).For microdissection of the SVZ (for more details see Azari et al. (2010) and Walker and Kempermann, 2014), have the rostral portion of the brain exposing the lateral ventricles of the cut coronal surface. Increase the magnification, remove and discard the septum using fine curved forceps.Dissect the SVZ by placing the tip of one blade of a pair of fine curved forceps in the lateral corner of the lateral ventricle immediately under the corpus callosum and the other roughly 1 mm into the tissue immediately adjacent to the ventricle. Press down the forceps towards the base of the dish and the ventral aspect of the ventricle to remove a small triangular piece of tissue (see Figure 1E). Place the dissected tissue into a small Petri dish on ice.",
    "DG dissection For microdissection of the DG (for more details see Hagihara et al. (2009) and Walker and Kempermann, 2014), place the caudal portion of the brain into the Petri dish and use a scalpel to cut along the longitudinal fissure (see Figure 1D).Carefully remove the cerebellum and the diencephalon using fine angled forceps.Refocus the microscope to visualize the borders around the DG. To remove the DG, use a 27 G ¾ needle and carefully slide along the border between the DG and Ammons’s horn.Free the DG from the surrounding tissue using fine angled forceps (see Figure 1F). Place the dissected tissue into a small Petri dish in 10 µl PBS on ice.SVZ tissue dissociationPreheat 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in a 15 ml centrifuge tube in a water bath at 37 °C for 10-15 min.Mince the dissected SVZ tissue with a scalpel in a 6 cm Petri dish for about 1 min (see Figure 1G).Transfer tissue pieces into the warm trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 7 min at 37 °C. Gently mix by inverting the tube occasionally.Stop the enzyme reaction by adding 1 ml of trypsin inhibitor containing DNaseI (see Recipes) and mix gently by flicking the tube.Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of growth medium (see Recipes) by carefully pipetting up and down 7 to 10 times using a P1000 pipette (see Figure 1H). Note: To increased cell death, it is important to triturate the tissue very gently.Add up to 5 ml of growth medium and pass the cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer into a 50 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.Resuspend the cell suspension in 500 µl of growth medium.",
    "DG tissue dissociationNote: The average yield of cells that can be obtained from one animal varies depending on the age of the animal as well as on the strain. However, to provide a rough estimate, we usually gain about 100,000-200,000 cells/ml from one 8-week old C57BL/6J animal.To obtain a single-cell suspension from the isolated DG tissue, the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) containing papain is applied as follows:To prepare Enzyme Mix 1 add 1,900 µl Buffer X and 50 µl Enzyme P (both supplied in the kit) to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. To increase the stability of the enzymes and viability of the cells add beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer X to a final concentration of 0.067 mM.Preheat Enzyme Mix 1 in a water bath at 37 °C for 10-15 min.Mince the dissected DG tissue with a scalpel in a 6 cm Petri dish for about 1 min (see Figure 1G).Transfer the tissue pieces into 1,950 µl of preheated Enzyme Mix 1.Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C and gently mix by inverting the tube every 3-5 min.Prepare Enzyme Mix 2 by adding 20 µl of Buffer Y to 10 µl of Enzyme A (both supplied in the kit).Add Enzyme Mix 2 to the tissue-enzyme mix.Dissociate the tissue mechanically by gently pipetting up and down 10 x with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette with the medium bore. Note: To avoid increased cell death, it is important to triturate the tissue very gently.Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C and gently mix by inverting the tube every 3-5 min.Further dissociate the tissue mechanically using a small bore, fire-polished Pasteur pipette by gently pipetting up and down 10 x (see Figure 1I).To wash the cell suspension, add Hank’s buffered salt solution up to 10 ml.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.",

DG tissue after enzymatic incubation.Monolayer cultureMonolayer cultures are established from primary cells, which are then cultured as adherent cells over several passages under proliferation conditions (Figure 2A). This leads to a rather homogeneous culture that can be used to perform single cell analyses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171101/20171101184048_4202.jpgFigure 2. Neural precursor cells from the adult mouse brain can be cultured as adherent monolayer cultures (A) or as neurospheres (B). Scale bars = 50 µm.Culturing Add 20 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml EGF and 2 µg/ml Heparin to the single cell suspension in growth medium obtained from the tissue dissociation.Seed the cell suspension into a coated well of a 24-well plate.24 h after seeding, remove the growth medium and exchange it with fresh growth medium with growth factors (20 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml EGF and 2 µg/ml Heparin).Note: This step can be skipped if the cells don’t seem to be sufficiently attached.24 h later, wash the cells with prewarmed PBS and add fresh growth medium with growth factors (20 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml EGF and 2 µg/ml Heparin).Every other day, exchange 50% of the old growth medium with fresh growth medium containing 100% of the growth factors to counteract the growth factor consumption in the residual medium (e.g., for a T25 flask containing 5 ml medium, remove 2.5 ml and add 2.",
    "5 ml fresh medium containing 40 ng/ml EGF and FGF2 and 4 µg/ml Heparin).Once cells reach 70-80% confluency, remove the medium and wash once with PBS.Note: This can take up to two weeks.Add 150 µl of Accutase and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.Tap the plate strongly onto its surface as well as from the side to agitate the attached cells.Check under the microscope if the cells are detached. If not, prolong incubation time (max 10 min).Add 2 ml of growth medium to the cell suspension and spin at 300 x g for 3 min to pellet the cells.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of growth medium.Take out 10 µl of cell suspension and mix it with 10 µl of trypan blue.Count the cells with a hemocytometer.Seed the cells in a density of min. 1 x 104 c/cm2 in growth medium with growth factors (20 ng/ml FGF2 and 20 ng/ml EGF; no more Heparin) into a new vessel.Further passaging (passage only once cells have reached 70-80% confluency) Remove the medium and wash once with PBS.Add Accutase and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.Tap the plate strongly onto its surface as well as from the side to agitate the attached cells.Check under the microscope if the cells are detached. If not, prolong incubation time (max 10 min).Collect the cells in 4.5 ml of growth medium (volume for a T25 flask) and spin at 300 x g for 3 min to pellet the cells.Add 10 µl of trypan blue to 10 µl of cell suspension and count cells with a hemocytometer.Seed the cells in a density of min. 1 x 104 c/cm2 (live cells) in growth medium containing growth factors (20 ng/ml FGF2 and 20 ng/ml EGF) into a new vessel.",
    "Freezing Prepare freezing mix (see Recipes) and store at 4 °C.Remove growth medium from flask/plate and wash with 5 ml of PBS.Add Accutase to the flask/plate and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C, check if all the cells are detached. If not, prolong incubation time (max 10 min).Collect cells in 4.5 ml of growth medium (volume for a T25 flask) and spin at 300 x g for 3 min to pellet the cells.Remove the supernatant.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of growth medium.Add 10 µl of trypan blue to 10 µl of cell suspension.Count the cells and adjust the cell density to 2 x 106 c/ml (live cells) with growth medium.Add 0.5 ml of freezing mix to each freezing vial.Add 0.5 ml of cell suspension to each freezing vial, mix and put into a freezing container.Place the freezing container directly in the -80 °C freezer.After 12 h, vials can be transferred into liquid nitrogen.Cell seeding and analysis of cell characteristics under proliferation conditions (Figure 3)Note: To analyse cell characteristics under proliferation conditions, cells can either be fixed directly 48 h after seeding or labeled with BrdU.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171101/20171101184609_8975.jpgFigure 3. Monolayer cultures under proliferation conditions. A. Monolayer cultures under proliferation conditions express cellular markers for progenitor cells of the nervous system such as Nestin (green) and Sox2 (magenta). B. Progenitor cells can be labeled to assess their proliferation capacity by examining the fraction of cells undergoing S-phase (BrdU label, green) relative to the overall number of cells (Hoechst 33342, blue). Scale bars = 50 µm.Thaw PDL/Laminin-coated plates (24-well plates with coverslips) for about 15 min at 37 °C.Remove the Laminin from the 24-well plates.Plate 20,000 cells/well onto coated coverslips in 24-well plate wells under proliferation conditions (add 20 ng/ml EGF and 20 ng/ml FGF2 to the medium)Incubate for 48 h.",
    "Add BrdU (final concentration 10 µM) to each well and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.Note: Skip this step if no BrdU labeling is required and continue with step 6.Remove the medium, add 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer to each well and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.Wash twice with PBS and add 1 ml of fresh PBS into the wells.Store at 4 °C until staining is performed.

CultureNote: Neurospheres are cultured in growth medium that additionally contains 2 µg/ml Heparin. Dilute the single cell suspension obtained from one mouse in 20 ml of neurosphere growth medium containing 20 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml EGF and 2 µg/ml Heparin.Plate 200 µl per well across a 96-well plate using a 10 ml multistepper pipette.Incubate SVZ-derived neurosphere cultures for 7 days and DG-derived neurosphere cultures for 12 days at 37 °C. Note: Extended incubation times can lead to overgrowth and may result in spontaneous attachment, differentiation or cell death in the core of the neurospheres.Count and size neurospheres using an inverted light microscope.Differentiation (Figures 4B and 4C)Note: For one experiment, we recommend seeding at least 4 coverslips with randomly sized neurospheres per 96-well plate. Thaw PDL/Laminin-coated plates (24-well plates with coverslips) for about 15 min at 37 °C.Remove the Laminin from the 24-well plates and wash the plate with PBS.Add 1 ml of growth medium to each well.Collect the medium containing the neurospheres from all wells of the 96-well plate into a 10 cm Petri dish.",
    "Using a stereo microscope collect the neurospheres from the Petri dish with a P100 pipette (final volume of 75 µl) and transfer them onto the coverslips in the 24-well plates.
