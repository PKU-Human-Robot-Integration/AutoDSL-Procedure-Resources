    "C. Membrane integrity following detergent induced injury using digitonin Part 1: Determining the optimal digitonin concentration for creating plasma membrane damage that most cells are able to repair (see Figure 3A for flowchart of the protocol).The following procedure is necessary to determine the optimal digitonin concentration for creating plasma membrane damage that can be repaired by most cells (~80%) in Ca2+ containing media, without any pre-treatments. The procedure should be performed regularly, as reagents (e.g., digitonin stocks) and cellular conditions may change over time. Performing this procedure ensures consistency of the number of injured cells, and reproducibility of the results obtained. The procedure should be performed for each cell line separately.Seed 6 × 103 cells per well in 100 µL of culture media in a 96-well plate, and allow cells to adhere overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37°C. Make two plates: one plate is used for determining optimal digitonin concentration, and the other plate is used for measuring membrane integrity.Adjust the number of cells per well for each cell line, as the cells need to be 50% confluent on the day of the experiment.Immediately before use, heat up the digitonin stock (5 µg/µL) to 95°C for 5 min to dissolve any precipitates.Note: Digitonin usually precipitates and needs to be redissolved by heating and occasional mixing by vortexing. Prepare the following ten dilutions of digitonin in preheated culture media (37°C): 0, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 100 µg/mL digitonin,Note: A digitonin solution of 100 µg/mL is used for total/complete permeabilization of cells. Add 100 µL of digitonin dilutions per well in triplicates. Add the digitonin solution to the side of the well to avoid detachment of adherent cells.Incubate in a cell culture incubator at 37°C for 30 min.",
    "In the meanwhile, prepare media with PI and Hoechst 33342 dye dilutions; the final concentrations should be: 0.25 µg/mL PI, and 6.25 µg/mL Hoechst 33342.Carefully add 50 µL of PI/Hoechst dye mix to each well in the 96-well plate, and incubate in a cell culture incubator for 5 min.Measure membrane integrity using the Celigo® cytometer, by measuring the number of total cells [Hoechst 33342 (excitation 350 nm, emission 461 nm) positive cells] and the number of permeabilized cells [PI (excitation 535 nm, emission 617 nm) positive cells] per well.Determine optimal digitonin concentration.Calculate the percentage of PI positive cells for the different conditions. The digitonin concentration that enables approximately 80% of the cells to repair [i.e., around 20 % of permeabilized cells (PI positive)] is optimal.In this example, where MCF7 cells are treated with digitonin for 30 min, an optimal digitonin concentration is 7.5–10 µg/mL (see Figure 3C).Part 2: Measuring membrane integrity following detergent induced injury using digitonin In the following procedure, the membrane integrity is measured for cells treated with digitonin in media with or without Ca2+. The assay can also be combined with different pre-treatments, such as trifluoperazine (TFP), or knockdown of a gene of interest by siRNAs. For examples where the assay is combined with different pre-treatments, see Sønder et al. (2019), and Heitmann et al. (2021). See Figure 4A for a flowchart of the protocol.Optional step: pretreat cells with an inhibitor.Prepare digitonin solutions (using the optimal concentration obtained in step C8) in media containing Ca2+ and in Ca2+-free media. Immediately before use, heat up the digitonin stock (5 µg/µL) to 95°C for 5 min, to dissolve any precipitates.Notes:  Digitonin usually precipitates and needs to be redissolved by heating and occasional mixing by vortexing. As negative control (i.e., no repair) include samples with cells in Ca2+-free media.",
    "Wash cells twice in HBSS without Ca2+. In the final wash, only add HBSS without Ca2+ to the wells that will be treated with digitonin in media without Ca2+. The rest of the wells should contain normal culture media.Add 100 µL of each digitonin dilution per well, in triplicates, as descripted in step C4. Add the digitonin solution to the side of the well to avoid detachment of adherent cells.Incubate in a cell culture incubator at 37°C for 30 min. In the meanwhile, prepare PI and Hoechst 33342 dye dilutions, in media with and without Ca2+. The final concentrations should be 0.25 µg/mL PI, and 6.25 µg/mL Hoechst 33342.Carefully add 50 µL of the respective PI/Hoechst dye mixes to the respective wells in the 96-well plate, and incubate in a cell culture incubator for 5 min.Measure membrane integrity using an imaging cell cytometer (e.g., Celigo®) by determining membrane integrity using the number of total cells (Hoechst 33342 positive cells: excitation 350 nm, emission 461 nm) and the number of permeabilized cells (PI positive cells: excitation 535 nm, emission 617 nm) per well.The Celigo® is a multichannel imaging cell cytometer that can be used to perform whole-well live cell analysis using optical microscopy. In this experiment, cells are labeled with permeable Hoechst 33342 dye and impermeable PI dye, prior to scanning and analysis. The cytometer scan the selected area, e.g., a 96-well in the selected channels. Then, the software can be used to identify labeled cells in the selected channel, and thereby calculating the number of total cells (Hoechst positive cells) and the number of permeabilized cells (PI positive cells).Note: The user should get particular training in their equipment before setting up the experiment."
