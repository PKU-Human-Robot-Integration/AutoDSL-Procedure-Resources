    "The treatment protocol follows the guidelines for animal experimentation adopted by Nagoya University.\n1. Preparation of Cell Suspensions\nHuman ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell line.\n\t\nMaintain ES-2 cells12 in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (penicillin: 100 units/ml, streptomycin: 0.1 mg/ml). Culture cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nCollect cells in the logarithmic growth phase in 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA solution (trypsin/EDTA).\n\t\t\nFirst, remove the old media from the cell culture vessel, then wash the cells once with PBS (PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+, 3 - 4 ml per 25 cm2).\nNext, add 1 ml per 25 cm2 of trypsin/EDTA. Rotate the cell culture vessel to cover the cell monolayer with trypsin/EDTA. After removing and discarding trypsin/EDTA, return the cell culture vessel to the incubator for 3 - 5 min or until cells are detached.\nExamine the cells under a microscope to ensure the cells are detached from the surface of the cell culture vessel and floating.\nAdd fresh serum containing growth medium to inactivate the trypsin (5 ml per 25 cm2), and re-suspend the cells. Transfer re-suspended cells to a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Perform centrifugation either at 4 °C or room temperature. Carefully remove supernatant and re-suspend cells with growth medium (5 ml per 25 cm2).\nCount cells (e.g., by trypan-blue exclusion) then re-suspend in growth medium at a density of 2 x 108 cell/ml. Put the suspended cells on ice.\nThaw frozen extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel aliquots in an ice bath.\nAdd the cell suspension to ECM-based hydrogel aliquots at a ratio of 1:1 (final cell concentration: 1 x 105 cells/µl of medium-ECM-based hydrogel) and mix thoroughly. Place the prepared cell suspensions in an ice bath until use.\n2. Orthotopic Inoculation with Cell Suspensions",
    "NOTE: Surgery does not require a dedicated suite. Surgery can be performed on a laboratory benchtop in an area of the room that is separate and has minimal activity. A laminar hood also may be used. Sterile surgical instruments must be used and scissors should not be used to make skin incisions.\nUse female nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu) at 8 weeks of age for this orthotopic inoculation model.\nFirst, anesthetize the mouse using inhalation with isoflurane (2 - 4%). Check anesthetic depth by verifying lack of withdrawal upon firm toe pinch. After the mouse is anesthetized, apply a bland sterile ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent drying as necessary.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on an operating stage belly-side down. Disinfect the surgical area several times with both alcohol and an iodine-based or chlorhexidine-based scrub.\nMake a ~ 2-cm incision vertically near the spine between the right costal arch and femur. Use a sterile surgical drape around the incision site. Fix the incised skin surfaces with clamps to maintain the opening.\n\tNote: Retractors can be used instead of clamps.\nNext, make a second incision (approximately 1 cm) at the parietal peritoneum under the first incision to open the abdominal cavity. Clamp the incised abdominal surfaces. Clip the fat tissue that surrounds the ipsilateral ovary and fallopian tube with a clamp to remove the ovary from the abdominal cavity. Carefully place the ovary and fallopian tube on gauze. Then, place the mouse belly-side down under the dissecting microscope.",
    "Place the cell suspension in an insulin syringe (1/2 cc, 29 G) just before injection. Carefully inject the prepared cell suspension (1 - 2 µl) into the ovary. For several sec, retain the needle within the ovary to ensure gelation of the ECM-based hydrogel. After gelation, the injected tumor cells remain inside the ovary.\nCarefully return the ovary into the body. Suture the second incision with sterile medical silk, and then seal the skin with wound clips.\nAfter surgery, the mice will be administered an analgesia (e.g., meloxicam, intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous (s.c.), 0.2 mg/kg) for initial 24 hr period.\n3. Post-surgical Treatment\nPlace each mouse in a separate cage on clean paper with a hot pack to keep the mouse warm until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Then, return the animals to their cages for rearing and monitoring. Monitor the mice daily for 3 - 7 days following surgical treatment.\nMonitoring of postoperative mice\n\t\nIn case of signs of pain, administer analgesics daily (e.g., meloxicam, i.m. or s.c., 0.2 mg/kg).\nIf mice have signs of infection (e.g., redness, swelling, discharge), administer daily injection with an anti-infective reagent (e.g., penicillin, i.m., 100,000 IU/kg).\nRemove skin closure materials 10 - 14 days after post-surgical treatment.\n4. Analysis of Tumors and Metastases\nNOTE: The tumor will be formed at the injected ovary 2 - 3 weeks after inoculation.\nSacrifice the mice by carbon dioxide, and then collect the samples (e.g., tumors, metastases, organs)13-15 for further analysis14,16-20.\n\tNOTE: If an in vivo imaging system is available, cells bearing enzymes that produce bioluminescence (e.g., luciferase) or fluorescent protein (e.g., GFP) can be used in this protocol. This modified protocol will provide useful information for the dynamics of the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor.",
