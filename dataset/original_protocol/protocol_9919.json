    "The use of animals in this protocol was approved by the National Animal Care and Use Committee.\nNOTE: Calcium carbonated coral skeletons should be used in the crystalline form of aragonite. The coral types tested so far for neural cultures are Porites Lutea, Stylophora Pistillata, and Trachyphyllia Geoffroyi. The skeletons can be purchased whole or ground.\n1. Cleaning the coral skeleton pieces\nCAUTION: The following steps should be performed in a chemical hood at room temperature, because the solutions described below are hazardous and may cause burns and irritations.\nUse a hammer to break the coral skeleton and divide it into 0.5–2 cm fragments. In order to dissolve organic and non-organic residues, soak the coral skeleton fragments in 10% sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 min, then wash once with double distilled water (DDW).\nTo remove the remaining organic residues, soak the fragments in a 1M NaOH solution for 5 min, then wash once with DDW. Continue with the removal of the organic deposits by soaking the fragments in 30% H2O2 solution for 10 min, then wash the fragments 3x with DDW.\nRemove as much excess DDW as possible and leave the coral fragments in the hood to dry (1–8 h).\n2. Cleaning the glass coverslips\nTransfer the glass coverslips into a 100 mm glass Petri dish. Add 10 mL of 95% ethanol for 15 min.\nRemove the ethanol and wash with DDW 3x, waiting 10 min between each wash. Place the dish on an 80 °C pre-warmed heating plate until the DDW evaporates. Gently stir the coverslips within the plate several times while drying to keep them from sticking to each other.\nAutoclave the coverslips.\n3. Preparation of coral skeleton grains",
    "Grind the coral skeleton fragments using a mortar and pestle (manual grinding) until complete breakdown. The outcome is a mixture of grains with sizes ranging from 20 µm–200 µm.\nAlternatively, grind the coral skeleton fragments using an electrical grinding machine at a velocity of 1,000 rpm for 30 s (blade length = 6 cm; width = 0.5 cm–1.0 cm). The resulting grain size is similar to the size range produced by the manual grinding.\n4. Purification of grains of a specific size range\nNOTE: If control over the size of the grains in a matrix is desired, use the following filtration-based grain purification procedure.\nTransfer the grains onto a manual or electrical 40 µm filter mesh strainer.\nDivide the grains into two specific ranges by sieving the grains through the strainer (if using an electrical strainer, the following conditions are recommended: shaking = 600 amplitudes/min, bouncing = 6/s). This procedure produces two groups of grain sizes, one <40 µm, and the second >40 µm.\n\tNOTE: The two sizes can be determined by using strainers of varying meshes. If a more restricted range is desired, then re-sieve each group from step 4.2 through strainers with different meshes.\nAutoclave the grains.\n5. Preparation of coral grain-coated dishes or coverslips\nFor coating flasks, plates, or Petri dishes\n\tNOTE: The following steps should be performed under sterile conditions.\n\t\nAdd the coral skeleton grains into a 20 µg/mL poly-D-lysine (PDL) solution dissolved in Hanks' solution. The concentration recommended is 5 mg/10 mg of grains per 1 mL PDL solution.\nPour the solution into flasks and dishes (approximately 2 mL/25 cm2) and incubate overnight at 4 °C. The grains sink and attach to the bottom.\nThe next day, wash the flasks and dishes once with sterile DDW. Let the flasks and dishes dry in the hood.",
    "NOTE: It is preferable to use freshly coated flasks and dishes. The coated flasks and dishes can be used up to a week after coating if preserved at 4 °C. However, the effectiveness of the matrix may be compromised.\nCoating glass coverslips (12 mm diameter, 0.17 mm thickness)\n\t\nAdd coral skeleton grains to DDW at any desired concentration. The common densities used for neural cells are 5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL. Pour 40 µL of the grain solution onto the center of the coverslip (Figure 4).\nPlace the coverslips on a heating plate prewarmed to 80 °C and wait for complete evaporation (usually 15 min). Under these conditions, the grains adhere to the coverslip. Autoclave the coated coverslips. Store in sterile conditions.\nA day before culture, place the coverslips on the lid of a sterile 24 well plate. Add 100 µL of 20 µg/mL PDL solution to each coverslip. Use the tip to ensure that the liquid covers the entire grain region and the rest of the coverslip surface.\nCover the lid with the bottom of the plate. Wrap the sides of the plates with paraffin film. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nThe next day, wash once with DDW and dry in the hood.\n\t\tNOTE: It is preferable to use freshly coated coverslips.\n6. Cultivation of hippocampal dissociated cells on coral skeleton grain-coated glass coverslips\nNOTE: The method for hippocampal dissociated cell culture was modified from previously published procedures24,27. The preparation of the culture is described for four rat pups. The expected yield from each hippocampus is 1–1.5 x 106 cells.\nSetup\n\t\nPrepare an empty 60 mm Petri dish. Pour 2 mL of minimal essential medium (MEM) into a 60 mm Petri dish and put on ice.",
    "Pour 2 mL of MEM into a 35 mm dish and put it in an incubator at 37 °C, 5–10% CO2. Pour 2 mL of MEM into a 15 mL tube and keep it at 4 °C.\nPour 1 mL of First Day Medium into a 15 mL tube and put it in an incubator at 37 °C, 5-10% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: The composition of the First Day Medium is described in the Table of Materials.\nThaw 200 µL of a 2.5% trypsin solution and incubate at 37 °C.\nPrepare three glass Pasteur pipettes with 0.5 mm, 0.75 mm, and 1.0 mm diameter heads using a flame.\nPrepare adequate surgical tools: one big scissor, two small scissors, one big tweezer, four small tweezers, and one scalpel.\nPrepare a stereomicroscope in the hood.\nUsing a big scissor, sacrifice 0–3 day old Sprague Dawley rat pups by separating their heads from their bodies into an empty 60 mm Petri dish (step 6.1.1). Dispose of the bodies.\nPick up the head by holding it from the mouth with a big tweezer. Cut the skin covering the skull with a small scissor.\nWith a clean scissor, enter beneath the skull (on the side of the cerebellum) and cut the skull to the right and to the left to enable its removal. Using a small tweezer, peel the skull off from the brain.\nWith a clean tweezer, separate the brain from the head and put it in a 60 mm Petri dish containing 2 mL of cold MEM (see step 6.1.2).\nUsing two small tweezers, dissect the hippocampi under a stereomicroscope. Transfer the hippocampi into the prepared 35 mm dish (from step 6.1.2) containing MEM.\n\tNOTE: Steps 6.3–6.6 should be repeated for each pup.",
    "Cut the hippocampi to approximately 1 mm slices using the scalpel. Add 200 µL of the trypsin solution (diluted to a final concentration of 0.25%). Mix gently and incubate at 37 °C, 5–10% CO2 for 30 min.\nAfter incubation, add 2 mL of cold MEM (step 6.1.2) to the dish to deactivate the trypsin. Transfer the trypsinized tissue to a 15 mL tube containing 1 mL First Day Medium preheated to 37 °C (step 6.1.3) using the glass Pasteur pipette with the largest diameter (step 6.1.5).\n\tNOTE: The best medium to tissue (v:v) ratio for further processing of the tissue is 1 mL/8 hippocampi. Avoid transferring the medium with the tissue as much as possible.\nTriturate the tissue by passing it through the largest diameter glass pipette 10–15 times. Then, repeat this process using the glass pipette with the medium diameter. Continue triturating with the smallest diameter pipette. Avoid bubbling to reduce cell death.\nLet the remaining tissue pieces sink for 2–5 min, then transfer the supernatant into another 15 mL tube. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\n\tNOTE: The preferable cell density is 200,000–400,000 cells/mL. Use First Day Medium to dilute or centrifugation at 470 x g to concentrate the cells.\nSeed 100 µL of cells on each glass coverslip. While seeding, make sure to cover the entire coverslip with cells. Incubate at 37 °C, 5–10% CO2.\nThe next day, add 500 µL of Neuronal Growth Medium to the wells.\n\tNOTE: The composition of the Neuronal Growth Medium is described in the Table of Materials.\nGently transfer each coverslip to its appropriate well using a tweezer while removing the First Day Medium by tilting the coverslip. Suction the remaining media from the lid.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C, 5–10% CO2. Avoid replacing the medium throughout incubation. Cultures can be maintained under these conditions up to 1 month. The major concern is humidity. Therefore, make sure to maintain the incubator maximally humidified.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
