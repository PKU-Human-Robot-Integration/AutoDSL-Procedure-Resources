    "Glycogen and trehalose measurements in 2 ml screw-capped tubesNote: Methods are based on Becker, 1978; Parrou and Francois, 1997.  Cell concentration is measured carefully (e.g., using a Coulter Counter or light scattering in a spectrophotometer) and noted. Transfer samples (of necessarily different, carefully-measured volumes) containing either 5.0 x 107 cells, or, if available, 1.0 x 108 cells, to a 2 ml screw-capped tube and centrifuge at about 20,000 x g for 10 sec. (e.g., 10 sec at maximum speed [~16,000 rpm] at room temperature in an Eppendorf 5415 D). Remove the supernatant, wash the cell pellet once in 1 ml ice-cold water to remove residual glucose from the medium. Resuspend cell pellets in 125 μl of 0.25 M Na2CO3 solution with initial vigorous/violent vortexing to thoroughly disperse all cells, and incubate at 95 °C for about 3 h with occasional vortexing (~once per hour, 5 sec), with care to maintain temperature at the top of the tube to avoid excessive condensation. Note: This can be done by incubating the tubes in an enclosed water bath, so that the air above the tubes is ~95 °C. Somewhat longer or shorter incubations have no apparent effect on the result; Becker (1978) and Quain (1981) incubated for only 90 min. At later times, the alkali-treated cells tend to clump together and are difficult to disperse, but failure to disperse the cells at these late times has no apparent effect on the result.After incubation at 95 °C, adjust the pH to 5.5, and the volume to 0.5 ml, by addition of 75 μl 1 M acetic acid and 300 μl 0.2 M NaAcetate, pH 5.2 (an appropriate mixture of acetic acid and NaAcetate was made first, and then 375 μl of the mixture was added to the 125 μl of sample).",
    "Vortex the sample vigorously to resuspend and disperse cell debris, then immediately divide it into two 250 μl in fresh tubes, for glycogen and trehalose measurements respectively. Note: It may be important to divide the cell debris equally, because the permeabilized cells may still contain glycogen granules, from which glucose will be liberated by amyloglucosidase in the glycogen assay.For glycogen measurement, make a 20 mg/ml solution of Aspergillus niger α-amyloglucosidase (~70 U/mg) freshly in 0.2 M NaAcetate, pH 5.2. (The pH optimum of the enzyme is ~pH 5, but with high activity between pH 3.0 and pH 6.5 [Pazur and Ando, 1959]). Add 10 μl of this solution to the 250 μl sample. Incubate the mixture overnight at 57 °C, close to the temperature optimum, with occasional vortexing as convenient. Note: The exact length of the incubation has little apparent effect on the result. However, incubation at temperatures below 55 °C may allow contaminating trehalase activities in the amyloglucosidase to become active, and to release glucose from trehalose, resulting in an over-estimation of the amount of glycogen (Parrou and Francois, 1997).For trehalose measurement, adjust the pH slightly upwards by addition of 15 μl of 0.2 M NaAcetate (as made by dissolving NaAcetate trihydrate in water, ~pH 8) to the 250 μl sample. The pH optimum for porcine trehalase is about pH 5.8. Add 3 μl of porcine trehalase (2.27 U/ml) (i.e., about 0.007 U of trehalase is added) and mix it well. Incubate the mixture overnight at 37 °C.Glucose liberated in the above procedures is quantified using a glucose assay kit. a.Briefly, prepare the glucose oxidase/peroxidase/o-dianisidine reagent as described by the manufacturer. b.Centrifuge cell samples for 5 min to pellet cell debris. c.",
    "Mix 50 μl of supernatant from the cell samples with 100 μl of assay reagent, and incubate the mixture in a pre-warmed rack at 37 °C for 30 min. d.Then add 100 μl of 9 N H2SO4 carefully to each reaction to stop the reaction and develop color (see Recipe 4). Prepare 50 μl samples of glucose standards (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 μg glucose) in 0.2 M NaAcetate buffer pH 5.2 and assayed in parallel. Typically prepare four or more ‘blank’ (0 glucose) standards. Finally, measure absorbance at 540 nanometers.Samples are diluted and re-developed if A540 readings are > 0.5, above which the assay is highly non-linear. A540 readings are converted to absolute amounts of glucose using the standard curve, and normalized for the number of cells used in the sample.Glycogen and trehalose measurements in 96-well microtitre dishesFor large numbers of assays, the above protocol has been adapted to 96-well microtitre dishes. Cell concentration is measured carefully (e.g., using a Coulter Counter or light scattering in a spectrophotometer) and noted. Transfer samples (of necessarily different, carefully-measured volumes) containing either 5.0 x 107 cells, or, if available, 1.0 x 108 cells, in less than 250 μl of liquid into the wells (~360 μl) of a polypropylene 96-well plate. Centrifuge the plates and aspirate the supernatant. Wash the cell pellets once in 250 μl ice-cold water to remove residual glucose. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant by aspiration.Resuspend the cell pellets in 125 μl of 0.25 M Na2CO3 solution. Seal the plates are tightly with a peelable PCR foil microtitre dish sealing film (e.g., QuickSeal Foil PCR Self Adhesive Seal [Biosero] or 4titude PCR Foil Seal) (see Notes). Shake the sealed plates violently by hand, then press to a vortex mixer, to thoroughly disperse all cells.",
    "Incubate the plates at 95 °C for about 3 h with occasional vortexing, with care to maintain temperature at the top surface of the plate to avoid excessive condensation. This can be done by incubating the plate in an enclosed water bath, so that the air above the plate is ~95 °C. Note: The polystyrene plates should not be used at this temperature. At later times, the alkali-treated cells tend to clump together and are difficult to disperse, but failure to disperse the cells at these late times has no apparent effect on the result.After incubation at 95 °C, plates are cooled to room temperature. Immediately before the contents are dispensed into new 96-well plates for treatment with amyloglucosidase or trehalase, shake the plates violently and vortex to disperse cell debris, then tap on the benchtop to bring liquid to the bottom of the wells, then unseal. For the glycogen assay, add 188 μl of concentrated amyloglucosidase buffer to each well of a 96-well plate (see Recipes). Pipet 62 μl (half) of the heat-and-alkali treated, freshly-shaken cell suspension into each well. It may be important to divide the cell debris equally, because the permeabilized cells may still contain some glycogen granules, from which glucose will be liberated by amyloglucosidase in the glycogen assay.Make a 20 mg/ml solution of Aspergillus niger α-amyloglucosidase (~70 U/mg) freshly in 0.2 M NaAcetate buffer, pH 5.2. Add 10 μl of  Aspergillus niger α-amyloglucosidase (~70 U/mg) solution to the 250 μl already in each well (step B3). Seal the plates using ordinary foil seals (e.g., Corning aluminum tape) (see Notes) and shake violently and vortex to mix. Incubate the plates overnight at 57 °C, with occasional vortexing as convenient, with care to maintain high temperature at the top of the plate to prevent condensation (e.g.",
    ", by placing the entire plate inside a water bath or air incubator. Note: The exact length of the incubation has little apparent effect on the result. However, incubation at temperatures below 55 °C may allow contaminating trehalase activities in the amyloglucosidase to become active, and to release glucose from trehalose, resulting in an over-estimation of the amount of glycogen (Parrou and Francois, 1997).For the trehalose assay, add 188 μl of concentrated trehalase buffer (see Recipes) to each well of a 96-well plate. Pipet 62 μl (half) of the heat-and-alkali treated, freshly-shaken cell suspension into each well. Porcine trehalase (2.27 U/ml) is diluted ~3 fold in trehalase dilution buffer (see Materials and Reagents) to 0.7 U/ml, and 10 μl of the diluted enzyme (i.e., about 0.007 U of trehalase) is added to each well. Seal the plate with ordinary foil seals (e.g., Corning aluminum tape) (see Notes), then shake violently and vortex. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.Glucose liberated in the above procedures is quantified using a glucose assay kit. Prepare the glucose oxidase/peroxidase/o-dianisidine reagent as described by the manufacturer.Add 100 μl of this reagent to each well of a fresh 96-flat-bottom-well, polystyrene plate (i.e., a plate suitable for a plate reader, see Materials and Reagents). Centrifuge the 96-well plates containing cell samples for 5 min to pellet cell debris. Pipette 50 μl of supernatant from the cell samples into the 100 μl of assay reagent in the assay plate. Seal the plates and mix by violent shaking and vortexing. Incubate the mixture in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Unseal the plates and then add 100 μl of 9 N H2SO4 carefully to each well to stop the reaction and develop color.",
    "Note: Mixing can be accomplished by pipetting up and down; alternatively the plate could be resealed and shaken/vortexed, but with care (e.g., after wrapping in paper towels) because of the sulphuric acid in the wells. Measure absorbance at 540 nanometers using a plate reader. (see Recipe 4)Prepare 50 μl samples of glucose standards (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 μg glucose) in 0.2 M NaAcetate pH 5.2 and assayed in parallel. Typically four or more ‘blank’ (0 glucose) standards are prepared and assayed (Zhao et al., 2016).Samples are diluted and re-developed if A540 readings are > 0.5, above which the assay is non-linear. A540 readings are converted to absolute amounts of glucose using the standard curve, and normalized for the number of cells used in the sample."
