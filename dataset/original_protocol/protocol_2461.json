Schematic of delivering particles into living cells\n(A) By coculture with cells, fluorescent particles enter cells in the form of endocytic vesicles.\n(B) Fluorescent particles are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n(C) The fluorescent particles are delivered into the cytoplasm via lysis of pinocytic vesicles. Cultured cells are exposed to hypertonic medium with high concentration of fluorescent particles, which is delivered into cells via pinocytic vesicles (left panel). Then when the cells are placed in hypotonic medium, the pinocytic vesicles burst and release the particles in the cytosol (middle panel). At last, the cells are incubated in culture medium to recover at least 10 min (right panel).\n(D) Comparison of three methods of internalizing fluorescent particles.",
    "Note: Living cells are constantly exchanging substances with the culture medium, so when the fluorescent particles are mixed with the culture medium, some particles may be endocytosed in the form of vesicles (Rejman et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nPrewarm the stock solution containing 100-nm fluorescent beads with carboxylate coating (Molecular Probes, F8803) at 37°C for approximately 10 min.\nCentrifuge the stock solution in a microfuge at 5,000 × g for 3 min.\nCritical: Centrifugation is performed to avoid aspirating the sediment from the solution.\nThen aspirate 0.5 μL of the supernatant reagent using a pipette.\nThe reagent is mixed with 2 mL of complete DMEM at a final concentration of 9 × 106 microspheres/mL in a 15 mL centrifuge tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: To mix the reagent and medium well, we cannot add the reagent to the Petri dish directly.\nPipette up and down at least 10 times to mix the liquid with the medium.\nReplace the medium in the Petri dish with the mixed medium.\nCulture the cells in an incubator for approximately 4 h.\nDiscard the medium and rinse the cell 3 times with 4 mL prewarmed PBS to remove excess fluorescent beads (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Make sure to rinse the cells to remove beads attached to the cell membrane.\nIncubate at least 10 min before imaging.\nLabeling of intracellular vesicles via the endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRs), as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B (Li et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Lidke et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: In response to the ligand EGF binding, the transmembrane protein EGFR is activated and undergoes endocytosis with the EGF. By labeling the EGFR with biotinylated EGF and streptavidin-coated fluorescent probes consecutively, the intracellular vesicle containing the endocytic complex is labeled.",
    "Culture the cells in serum-free DMEM with 10 nM biotin-EGF on ice for 15 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nAfter being washed with cold PBS three times, incubate the cells with 0.5–1 nM streptavidin-coated quantum dots (QDs, Invitrogen, Q10123MP) for 5 min.\nNote: QDs are commonly used fluorescent probes in single-particle tracking, because of their high brightness and photostability (Pinaud et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nThen, wash the cells three times with cold PBS again to remove unlabeled streptavidin-QDs (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nTransfer the cells to 37°C to initiate the internalization of EGF-QDs for at least 1 h before imaging.\nDelivery of fluorescent particles into the cytoplasm via lysis of pinocytic vesicles, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C (Jiang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Li et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Okada and Rechsteiner, 1982[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nNote: To maintain the osmotic pressure balance, the cells will undergo pinocytosis under the culture of hypertonic solution so that the hypertonic solution mixed with fluorescent particles will be engulfed by the cells in the form of vesicles, and then the hypotonic solution will cause the vesicles to rupture in the cytoplasm, releasing fluorescent particles into the cytoplasm.\nMake the hypertonic loading medium and hypotonic medium following the protocol of pinocytic cell-loading reagent (I-14402).\nRepeat steps 4a and 4b to centrifuge the stock solution of fluorescent particles, before aspirate the supernatant for the next step. Both the fluorescent beads (F8803, ∼100 nm in diameter) and QDs (Q10123MP, ∼25 nm in diameter) could be applied.\nAdd approximately 0.2 μL of fluorescent particles to a 0.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 100 μL of hypertonic loading medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: Because fluorescent particles are only introduced into the cells at the 10-mm bottom well of the Petri dish, 100 μL of solution is enough to fill the bottom well.",
    "Discard the medium in the dish. Then, quickly, but gently, pipette the hypertonic medium containing the particles to the dish.\nCulture for 10 min in the incubator.\nCritical: The concentration of particles in the hypertonic solution determines the efficiency of particle entry into cells.\nNote: Concentrations that are too high or incubation times that are too long can cause excessive particles to adhere to the glass bottom and cell surfaces, which can interfere with imaging.\nDiscard the hypertonic solution in the Petri dish. Then, quickly add 2 mL of hypotonic solution (serum-free medium and deionized water in a 6:4 ratio) and incubate for 2 min.\nCritical: Longer exposure to the hypotonic lysis medium may result in blebbing of the cell membranes and loss of cell viability.\nNote: If the cells are sensitive to osmotic pressure, the incubation time can be reduced to approximately 1 min.\nAspirate the hypotonic solution with a pipette, add 2 mL of complete medium, and incubate in the incubator for 10 min.\nRinse the cells at least 3 times with PBS, add 2 mL PBS each time and shake the dish gently for approximately 10 s to remove the particles adhered to the cell membranes (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nThe cells are then left in complete DMEM in an incubator to recover for 10 min before imaging.\nPrewarm the incubation chamber on microscope\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThis step allows the incubation chamber’s temperature and carbon dioxide concentration to stabilize before the experiment begins.\nPrepare the following equipment and materials.\nAn on-stage incubation system (TOKAI HIT).\n5% CO2 tank.\nDistilled water 20 mL.\nNote: Live cell imaging is performed at 37°C with 5% CO2, which is important for maintaining the physiological environment of cells.\nAdd 20 mL distilled water to the bath of the incubator to keep the humidity.",
    "Open the valve of the gas cylinder and the pressure relief valve in sequence to maintain the CO2 supply of the incubator. Adjust the valve to set the pressure to be approximately 0.1 MPa.\nNote: Keep the pressure reducing valve closed when opening the valve of the gas cylinder to avoid the disconnection of the pipe from the controller due to excessive pressure.\nTurn on the power of the incubation system. Place an empty Petri dish in the chamber. Set the temperature of the top heater, stage heater, bath heater and lens heater to 37°C for half an hour before live cell imaging.\nNote: The temperature setting for different heaters is instrument dependent and not necessarily generalizable.\nNote: Placing a Petri dish in the chamber can prevent water vapor from spreading to the lens.\nNote: Turn on the incubation system to maintain a stable culture environment before the experiment.\nOpening the focus locking system\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThis step achieves the focus-locking and prevent the vertical drift.\nTurn on the 940 nm laser light source, piezoelectric stage and focus-locking software.\nThe working distance of the piezo stage is 100 μm, so we set the initial position of the stage at 50 μm so that the working range of the platform is ±50 μm.\nNote: We need to adjust the focal plane by approximately 50 μm and focus on the target plane again.\nStart the imaging of the infrared spot, which is reflected by the interface between the specimen and coverglass. Set the laser intensity, gain, and exposure time for best imaging.\nNote: The principle of focusing is to detect the vertical drift of the lens according to the position shift of the infrared spot and then adjust the piezoelectric stage to compensate for the drift of the lens.",
    "Set the parameters on the focus lock panel.\nThreshold: For 8-bit images, set a threshold between 0–255. Pixels with intensities above the threshold are used to locate the centroid of the imaged points. Setting this parameter ensures that there are enough pixels to fit the center of the spot. We usually set this parameter to 100.\nStep: Set the step size of the piezo stage. Setting this parameter ensures that the piezo stage is fast enough to compensate for lens drift. We usually set this parameter to 20 nm.\nSensitivity: Changes in the distance exceeded the sensitivity cause the piezo stage to compensate for the drift. Setting this parameter determines the sensitivity to lens drift. We usually set this parameter to 1 pixel.\nClick lock to start focus.\nNote: Except for the calibration experiment, we need to lock the focus after setting the focal plane.\n3D single-particle tracking in living cells\nTiming: 2 h\nWe generally apply HILO imaging to excite fluorescent probes inside cells while achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This step includes the imaging of immobilized fluorescent particles on glass, calibration and 3D single-particle tracking in living cells.\nPlace the dish in the observation chamber on the microscope (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nTurn on the brightfield light source and look down the eyepieces to focus the sample and position on a region of interest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2096-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The radius of the ring measured by the binarized image is 6.5 pixels, which can be used as the initial value of the Gaussian fitting.\n(J) 2D Gaussian Fitting of Image Intensity Based on Spatial Location. The measured radius of the diffraction ring is 6.62 pixels.\n(K) Sample data of the stage positions in the z direction (blue line) and the radii of the diffraction rings (black points).\n(L) Calibration data between the z coordinate and the measured radius (r) of diffraction rings.\n(M) Plot of a typical trajectory with the time indicated by color.\nTurn off the brightfield light source. Use a laser that is compatible with the fluorescent particles and start at a moderate power.\nNote: We usually choose the weakest possible power of the laser to image the fluorescent particles, which reduces the photobleaching of fluorescent particles and avoids damage to cells.\nUse the appropriate optical path, open the shutter, and detect the fluorescent signal with the EMCCD. Focus on the fluorescent particles on the bottom and adjust the illumination angle for HILO imaging.\nNote: The HILO mode is ideal for single-particle tracking because it can significantly improve the imaging signal-to-noise ratio.\nCritical: HILO mode may cause uneven light field.\nCool down the EMCCD to −75°C. Set the camera exposure time at 30 ms. Set the gain of the EMCCD between 0–300. Select the frame transfer of the EMCCD (troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]).",
    "Note: The linear signal amplification range of CCD is 0–300, so we should set the gain in this range. For the fluorescence bead experiment, the gain can be set to approximately 50. For the QD experiment, because the brightness of the quantum dot is relatively low, setting the gain value above 250 can obtain a good imaging effect. For different probes, the key to setting the gain is that the CCD can detect clear diffraction rings.\nSet the repeat to be 2,000 times (e.g., total acquisition duration is 60 s under the 30 ms interval). Choose the stream mode to realize the fastest frame rates.\nNote: We have tried intervals of 30 ms and 100 ms, which are able to track the movements of the labeled vesicles and fluorescence particles. It should be noted that a shorter time interval means a shorter exposure time, which will reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging.\n3D tracking in living cells. Select a cell containing fluorescent particles to take 2,000 frames of video. After taking the video, switch to brightfield illumination and take a single snapshot of the cell. It can be used to further determine the position of the nucleus and the cell outlines, which are important for analyzing the spatial distribution of intracellular transport (troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).\nCritical: The number of fluorescent particles in different cells varies greatly, so we usually select cells with no more than 30 particles to avoid overlapping diffraction rings.\nNote: Do not touch the optical table during the experiment, which may cause vibrations of the imaging platform.",
    "To determine the localization precision of the imaging platform, we image the immobilized particles under the same conditions and protocol as that for living cells. If the system is not stable, the coordinates of the fixed point will exhibit movements instead of fluctuation around the center.\nNote: During the experiment, focus locking is very useful to avoid measurement bias in the z direction.\nTo determine the calibration between the z position and radius of the diffraction ring of the fluorescent particles, we take 2,000 frames of video of the fixed particles and simultaneously lift the lens in 50 nm steps every 5 s (troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.19]).\nFor each sample, we usually finish imaging in 2–4 h to avoid impairing cell function. Finally, save all the images in TIFF format for the following processing.\n3D trajectory reconstruction\nTiming: 1 day\nReconstruct 3D trajectories from video using ImageJ and MATLAB. Extract the lateral trajectory from the focal plane through the ImageJ plugin particle tracker and then determine the axial coordinates by fitting the diffraction ring with the script written in MATLAB.\nSelect a region consisting cells, duplicate the video and save the file.\nNote: The raw video contains images on both the focused and defocused planes. For the convenience of processing, we duplicate and save the videos of the region of interest on the two planes.\nOpen images using ImageJ, an open-source image analysis software program.\nAdjust the video brightness through the Image–Adjust–Brightness/Contrast tool to make the image clear.\nUse the Rectangle Tool to draw a region of interest containing cells on the focus plane. Duplicate the image stack of the selection with the Image-duplicate tool.\nMove the rectangular region 256 pixels horizontally to the defocused plane with the Edit–Selection–Specify tool and then use the duplicate tool to duplicate the defocused image stack.",
    "Save the duplicated stacks of the focused plane and defocused plane areas to a folder.\nCreate a new subfolder named “def”. Use the File–Save As–Image sequence tool to save the defocused image stack in the folder “def” in the form of an image sequence.\nNote: Set the stack's name to empty on the dialog screen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nObtain the transformation matrix between the two planes.\nOn the stack of the focused plane, use the polygon selection tool to select at least three bright spots to construct a polygon, then use the magnifying glass tool to zoom in on the image, and adjust the position of the polygon vertices to be approximately in the center of the bright spots (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nNote: Fitting the diffraction ring in subsequent steps would recalculate the center position of the diffraction ring. Therefore, the vertex position of the polygon does not need to be 100% in the center of the bright spot.\nCopy the polygon to the defocused plane stack with the Edit–Selection–Restore Selection tool. Similarly, adjust the position of polygon vertices with the magnifying glass tool.\nNote: Display the same frame image on the focused and defocused stacks.\nSave the polygon coordinates on the two stacks using the File–Save As–XY Coordinates tool.\nExtract motion trajectories from the focused stack using ImageJ’s plugin Particle Tracker (Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) and draw the region occupied by the intracellular trajectories (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nSelect the focused stack, start the plugin Particle Tracker, which displays a dialog screen. The dialog has two parts: “Particle Detection” and “Particle Linking”.\nIn the Particle Detection part, we need to set Radius, Cutoff and Percentile.",
    "The radius is set to determine the radius of the particle, and we usually set it to 3, to ensure that the circle with the given radius could cover the entire light spot.\nCutoff is set to remove the possibly few aggregations as well as the blurred particles, and we usually set it to 0.\nPercentile (percent %) is the intensity threshold. The local region that has an intensity above the threshold is recognized as a particle. We usually set this parameter to 0–5 depending on the total intensity of the stack and the density of the particles.\nNote: When we set the percentile, we should use the Preview Detected button and the slider to view the detected particles in other frames.\nIn the Particle Linking part, we need to set the displacement and the link range.\nDisplacement is set to 2 or 3.\nThe link range is set to 2 or 3.\nNote: These parameters need to be optimized by checking the extracted trajectories in the following procedures. Here, a link range over 1 could bridge QD blinking events.\nAfter completing the particle tracking, the result window will be displayed.\nClick on the Visualize All Trajectories button to open a new window that visualizes all the trajectories and the original movie frames in an overlay.\nAfter opening the visualization window, click the filter button at the bottom. We set the minimum length (in frames) to be 50 for trajectories to be displayed (the default is to display all), and trajectories below that length will be excluded.\nNote: Check the trajectories optically for inappropriate linking and optimize the linking parameters repeatedly. These parameters could be adjusted on the menu bar of the result window.",
    "In the trajectory window, select a region that covers all the trajectories by clicking and dragging the mouse.\nClick on the Trajectories in Area Info button, which displays the information of all trajectories in the selected area on the verbose information panel. In this panel, trajectory information can be exported to any text editor.\nThe trajectory information includes the frame number, the xy coordinates and the intensity parameters.\nNote: A trajectory will have at least 2 rows. Each row represents a frame in this trajectory and holds the information about the particle related to this trajectory in that frame. The first column indicates the frame number, starting at 0 for each trajectory. The second and third columns contain the x- and y-coordinates of the particle, respectively. The x-axis points top-down, and the y-axis is oriented left-right in the image plane. The 4th and 5th columns contain the intensity moments of orders 0 and 2, respectively (m0, m2). The 6th column contains the non particle discrimination score. When more than one trajectory is displayed, a blank line separates each individual trajectory.\nSelect the All Trajectories visual window. Capture the image and use polygon selections to draw a polygon region that covers all the trajectories needed.\nNote: With the region, immobilized trajectories and trajectories that do not belong to this cell can be excluded.\nCut and save the ROI image.\nImport the trajectory information into MATLAB and store it in a structure and the coordinates of the region into MATLAB and store them in arrays.\nExclude trajectories whose mean coordinates are not within the polygon region (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nImport the coordinates of the two polygons into MATLAB and store them in arrays.\nThrough simple matrix operations, calculate the transformation matrix between the two planes.",
    "Using the transformation matrix, transform the xy coordinates of the trajectory on the focus plane to the defocus plane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nCreate a subfolder named “Image” to store diffraction ring images.\nFor each trajectory, read the image in file “Dec” frame by frame, and the intensity of the image is stored in an intensity matrix I0.\nDefine a square region of interest (ROI) with a side length of 31 pixels (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nFor the kth point on the trajectory, obtain the value of the intensity matrix I0 of the size of the ROI centered at (xk, yk).\nConvert the ROI matrix to a grayscale image and save the image named “ith track kth frame” in the folder “Image”.\nNote: The results of each trajectory can be previewed through the ROI images in the folder. Some images with overlapping or poor imaging results can be deleted manually.\nCalculate the radius of the diffraction ring from MATLAB (troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.21]).\nFor each trajectory, read the ROI image frame by frame and store in a matrix I.\nThrough a real-space bandpass filter, obtain a matrix I1 with an improved signal-to-noise ratio.\nSet the appropriate threshold to binarize the matrix and save it as a new matrix I2.\nUse the circleHough function to obtain the radius r0 of the binary image, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I (Wang and Boyer, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nPerform fitting to the matrix I1 with the following equation, which is a Gaussian peak surrounded by a ring of radius r:",
    "I =  c 0  +  c 1  ∗ exp  [  −  c 2  ∗  (    (  x −  x 0   )  2  +   (  y −  y 0   )  2   )   ]  +  c 3  ∗ exp  [  −  c 4  ∗   (    (    (  x −  x 0   )  2  +   (  y −  y 0   )  2   )   1 2   − r  )  2   ]   \nwhere I is the intensity matrix of the ROI, x0 and y0 are the coordinates of the ring center, and r is the ring radius (Jiang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Toprak et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nNote: Cftool can directly generate the fitting code.\nCritical: For the fitting of such a complex function, it is easy to get stuck. The try catch end structure can be used to skip the error operation and continue the subsequent fitting.\nThe loop is used to set different fitting initial values for fitting, and the result with the largest r-square is selected (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nSave the frame number, xy coordinates and radius of each track in an array.\nFor each trajectory, plot the radius as a function of frame number and use the brush tool to remove discontinuous points in the array.\nNote: Fitting images with overlapping or poor signal-to-noise ratios may produce points with discontinuous radii.\nNote: Usually, there will be more than 10 trajectories in a cell, which will generate more than 10,000 frames of images to be processed. When using a computer with an i5 3.2 GHz processor and 16 Gb of RAM, and the script will take more than 5 h.\nDetermine the calibration between the ring radius and z position.\nIn the defocus plane, the multipoint tool is used to directly select the center position of the diffraction ring.",
    "Use the File–Save As–Image Sequence tool to save the image stack as an image sequence to a folder named “Def”.\nImport the position of the diffraction ring to MATLAB.\nRepeat steps 29f-29j to save the ring images and repeat step 30 to calculate the ring radius.\nPlot the radius as a function of frame number.\nWith the function getline, obtain the averaged value of each step (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nWith cftool, linearly fit the value with the z position of the piezo stage recorded in the experiment. The slope is the calibration between the ring radius and the z position (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L).\nThe axial coordinates (z) are obtained by multiplying the ring radius by the slope of the calibration.\nDetermination of localization precision.\nFor the fixed points on the glass, repeat steps 26-30 to obtain the xy coordinates and radius.\nFor a fixed point, MSD = 2∗σ2 in each direction, where σ is the localization precision (Savin and Doyle, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nRandomly select 10 fixed points and calculate the average MSD curve in the xyz three directions to determine the localization precision.\nThe z-coordinate of the trajectory can be calculated from the ring radius obtained in step 30 and the calibration obtained in step 32. In this way, a complete 3D trajectory with xyz coordinates over time can be reconstructed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]M).\nDynamic analysis of 3D trajectories\nTiming: 4 h\nDynamics analysis of 3D trajectories is performed with a custom script written in MATLAB.\nSelect the trajectories with track lengths longer than 50 frames.\nNote: Selecting trajectories longer than 50 frames can ensure that there are enough points to compute the 1 s (33 frames) MSD curve.",
    "The MSD curve is calculated by the equation MSD(τ) = |r(t + τ) − r(t)|2, where r is the 3D coordinates and τ is the lag time (Lerner et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Calculate the mean squared displacement between all point locations in each direction (x, y, z) with time interval τ=n∗0.03 s (n=1, 2, 3, … 33) along the entire trajectory.\nThe diffusion coefficient and the anomalous exponents are calculated by fitting the MSD to lag time.\nThe MSD of each trajectory is plotted as a function of lag time in log-log. Observe whether the MSD curve is a straight line or a curve. If it is a straight line, then the motion patterns at different time scales are consistent, and the dynamic parameters of the entire curve can be directly fitted. If the MSD curve changes at different time scales, it means that the motion of particles follows different motion modes at different time scales; then, the parameters should be fitted separately at different time scales (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2096-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dynamic analysis of the 3D trajectories\n(A) Comparison of the particle MSD in each direction as a function of lag time in A549 cells (solid lines, 107 trajectories from 6 cells) and on the cover glass (noise floor, dashed lines, 15 trajectories).\n(B) Plot of MSD/t versus time. The solid and dashed lines in black represent slopes of -0.7 and 0, respectively. Error bars indicate the SEM.\n(C) Comparison of the exponent α in each direction at short and long timescales. For boxplots, the line in the box indicates the median value, the dot indicates the mean value, box edges correspond to 25% and 75% of the dataset, and error bars indicate the SD. ∗∗∗p < 0.001; NS, not significant.",
    "(D and E) Comparison of the exponent α for each direction between the perinuclear and peripheral regions. Exponent α determined at short timescales (B) and long timescales (C).\n(F) Fraction of confined (a < 0.5), subdiffusive (0.5<a < 1), and superdiffusive (1<a < 2) motions in the two different regions. Figure (D–F) is reproduced from Jiang et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nTo clearly determine if MSD changes linearly with time, plot MSD/t as a function of t in a logarithmic coordinate system (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: With the plot of MSD/t, the negative slope of MSD/t indicates the subdiffusive motion. The positive slope indicates superdiffusive motion. The increased slope suggests that the motion gradually alters to normal diffusive motion.\nEach 1D MSD can be fitted with MSD = 2∗Dα∗tα. α is the anomalous exponent: α ≈ 1 is free Brownian motion (e.g., pure random walk or free diffusion), α < 1 subdiffusion (e.g., diffusion within a confined area), α > 1 superdiffusion (e.g., diffusion overlaid with directed motion), and α ≈ 2 directed motion, Dα [μm2/sα] is the anomalous exponent-dependent diffusion coefficient, which describes the ability of the particle to diffuse (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4F).\nNote: For superdiffusive and subdiffusive motions, the units of diffusion coefficient Dα [μm2/sα] are α-dependent and cannot be used directly to evaluate dynamics. Here, we suggest using α to compare the dynamics in different conditions. For trajectories on longer time scales, since alpha is close to 1, the apparent diffusion coefficient Dapp can be calculated with uniform units [μm2/s]. For 1D MSD, calculate Dapp by fitting MSD with MSD=2∗ Dapp ∗t, and set α=1.\nFinally, dynamic parameters α in different directions at different time scales are presented as box plots.",
    "The position of the nucleus and the outline of the cell can be identified according to the captured brightfield image of the cell. The perinuclear region and the peripheral region can be defined according to the distance of the particle to the nucleus, and then the difference in transport in the two regions can be compared for further analysis (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D–4F)."
