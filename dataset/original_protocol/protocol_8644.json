    "1. Preparation of Single-cohort Colonies\nPrepare three honeybee colonies to create two single-cohort colonies and to obtain a sufficient number of newly emerged workers.\n\t\nCheck that some pupae in the capped peripheral cells in the combs have brown eyes and a pigmented cuticle by opening the capped combs using tweezers. If these pupae exist in peripheral comb cells, most of pupae in the whole combs will emerge in approximately 1-3 days.\nSubsequently, collect the combs containing these pupae after all adherent adult bees have been removed with a brush, and mix combs from the three colonies to minimize variability among colonies.\nPlace the collected combs in an empty hive box and incubate at 33 °C under humid conditions (>60% relative humidity). Collect approximately 6,000 newly emerged workers over 3 days (3,000 workers per colony) from the collected combs.\nDetermine the quantity of workers based on the weight of five newly emerged workers randomly collected from unmanipulated colonies.\n\t\nWeigh five newly emerged workers randomly collected from unmanipulated colonies using weighing machines.\n\t\tNote: The weight of five newly emerged workers is generally 500-600 mg.\nEstimate the quantity of collected workers by dividing the weight of the collected workers by the average weight of five newly emerged workers.\nApply paint marks to the thoraces of approximately 1,800 workers (900 workers per colony) using water-based poster paint markers.\n\tNote: Washable marker which is used to apply the paint is listed in the Table of Materials.\nIntroduce a queen and approximately 3,000 of the 0-2 day old workers to a new hive box that contains two combs, one comb containing honey and pollen as preserved foods and another empty comb for egg-laying by the queen. Collect the comb containing honey and pollen from another unmanipulated colony after all adherent bees are removed.",
    "Note: The use of nuclear hive box (small sized hive box) is recommended.\nCollect nurse bees and precocious foragers with paint marks 6 to 8 days after creating single-cohort colonies.\n\t\nTo collect nurse bees, pick up workers that put their heads into comb cells to take care of the brood. Use tweezers to collect the nurse bees from combs that contain many brood and adult workers.\n\t\tNote: If HPGs of collected workers are developed when dissected as described in step 1.7, these workers are defined as nurse bees. Holding the thoraces by tweezers is recommended to pick up workers from the combs.\nTo collect foragers, use an insect net to capture workers that return to their hives with pollen loads on their hind legs.\n\t\tNote: If HPGs of captured workers appear shrunken when dissected as described in step 1.7, those workers are defined as foragers.\nClassify the HPG into three groups, 'Developed', 'Intermediate', and 'Shrunken' by the dissection under a stereomicroscope.\n\t\nAnesthetize 10-15 bees in an insect cage in a refrigerator for 10-15 min until bees cannot fly or walk. Then, move bees onto ice and complete the anesthesia on ice for 5 min.\n\t\tNote: It takes about total 15-20 min to achieve anesthesia. If the anesthesia time needs to be shortened, the number of bees in a cage should be reduced to 1-3 bees per cage.\nDissect the head from the body with scissors and tweezers. Fix the head on dental wax placed on a Petri dish with pins. Insert two pins into the bases of the antennae to fix the head. Soak fixed heads in insect saline (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2).\nRemove the anterior aspect of the cuticle of the head using fine tweezers and a surgical knife under a binocular microscope.",
    "Note: The HPGs can be easily found in the head after removal of cuticle. The HPG is a botryoid organ that exists around the brain in the head.\nRemove the tracheal tissue which is a white membranous tissue under the cuticle. Then, dissect the HPGs from the head by slowly pulling them with tweezers.\nClassify HPGs with large and circular acini as 'Developed'. Classify HPGs with small and distorted acini as 'Shrunken'. Classify HPGs corresponding to neither 'Developed' nor 'Shrunken' as 'Intermediate'.\n\t\tNote: Representative photographs that show these three classes of HPG states are indicated in Figure 2.\nSubject 'Developed' and 'Shrunken' HPGs to RNA extraction as 'nurse bee HPGs' and 'forager HPGs', respectively, and compare gene expression in the HPGs between nurse bees and foragers (section 4).\n2. Injection of 20E\nCollect nurse bees from typical colonies as described in the procedure 1.6.1.\n\tNote: HPGs cannot be examined in these bees as the bees will be reared.\nAnesthetize the bees at 4 °C in a refrigerator (not on ice).\n\tNote: It takes about 30 min to achieve anesthesia. If the anesthesia time is shortened, the number of bees in the cage should be reduced to 1-3 bees per cage.\nUsing tweezers, immobilize the bees on dental wax placed on a Petri dish.\nInject 1 µl of 20E solution into the anterior aspect of the head using an injection tip made from a calibrated capillary micropipette using a glass needle puller.\n\t\nDissolve 20E in ethanol-insect saline (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2) mixture (1:4) at 2.5 µg/µl.\nConnect the injection tip to a rubber tube, and connect a yellow micropipette tip to the opposite side of the tube.",
    "Place 1 µl of 20E solution on parafilm using a micropipette, hold the yellow micropipette tip in the mouth, and draw the solution into the injection tip.\nInsert the injection tip into the base of the antennae, and inject the solution by blowing through the yellow micropipette tip.\n\t\tNote: The protocol shown in this step is the representative injection method, but the use of the automated injection machine is recommended for safety as necessary20.\nRear the injected bees in insect cages at 33-36 °C (the ideal temperature is 35 °C) under dark and humid conditions (>60 % relative humidity) for 1 or 3 days. Supply honey-water mixture (1:1) to the bees. If needed, count surviving bees after injection.\n3. Application of Methoprene\nCollect the combs that contain pupae from typical colonies after all adherent adult bees are removed with a brush. Incubate the combs at 33-36 °C (the ideal temperature is 35 °C) in humid conditions (>60% relative humidity) for up to 1 day.\nCollect newly emerged bees from the collected combs and apply paint marks to their thoraces using poster paint as described in the protocol for preparing single-cohort colonies. Return the marked bees to their colonies.\nAfter 6 days, collect painted workers (6 day old) from the colonies. Pick up painted workers from the combs by holding their thoraces with tweezers.\nAnesthetize the bees at 4 °C in a refrigerator (not on ice) as in the procedure 2.2. Using tweezers, immobilize the bees on dental wax placed on a Petri dish and apply 1-5 µl of methoprene solution (50-250 µg/µl) dissolved in acetone to their heads using a micropipette. Use a filter tip that is resistant to acetone.",
    "Note: Acetone may have the harmful effects on bees leading to death. If the high mortality of bees is observed, the reduction of the volume of acetone to 1 µl at the minimum is recommended.\nRear the bees in insect cages at 33-36 °C (the ideal temperature is 35 °C) for 7 days under dark and humid conditions (>60% relative humidity). Supply honey-water mixture (1:1) to the bees. If needed, count surviving bees after topical application.\n\tNote: In this article, surviving bees are counted 7 days after application (Table 3).\n4. RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR\nAnesthetize bees and dissect HPGs as described in steps 1.7.1 to 1.7.4.\nCollect the dissected HPGs in a microcentrifuge tube on dry ice and store at -80 °C until use.\nAdd 400 µl of the reagent for protein denaturation.\n\tNote: This reagent is commercially available (see the Table of Materials).\nHomogenize the HPG tissues using a hand held electric mixer with a homogenization pestle that fits inside a microcentrifuge tube. Homogenize at a rotation speed of approximately 300 rpm for 1 min on ice to break and lyse tissue cells.\n\tNote: The hand held electric mixer is commercially available (see the Table of Materials).\nAdd 80 µl chloroform and mix well. Incubate for 5 min at RT.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at 14,170 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube. Add an equal volume of isopropanol and 1 µl glycogen (5 mg/ml). Incubate at -20 °C for at least 20 min.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at 14,170 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant.",
    "Add 400 µl of 75% ethanol to the pellet and mix well, centrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at 14,170 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant. Repeat these procedures once more.\nAir-dry the pellet for 5-10 min and then dissolve it in 10 µl RNase-free water.\n\tNote: Complete drying of the pellet may cause insolubilization of the RNA pellet in water. Thus, the pellet which is slightly wet is appropriate for dissolving.\nMeasure the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer such as NanoDrop or similar.\nTreat 500 ng of total RNA with 2.0 U of DNase I by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min to degrade any contaminating genomic DNA.\nReverse-transcribe 200 ng of DNase I-treated RNA and perform real time PCR using commercially available kits (see the list in the Table of Materials and Reagents) and gene-specific primers (mrjp2; 5'-AAATGGTCGCTCAAAATGACAGA-3', and 5'-ATTCATCCTTTACAGGTTTGTTGC-3', Hbg3; 5'-TACCTGGCTTCGTGTCAAC-3' and 5'-ATCTTCGGTTTCCCTAGAGAATG-3'). Perform the PCR as follows: [95 °C x 30 sec + (95°C x 5 sec + 60°C x 15 sec + 72 °C x 20 sec) x 45-55 cycles].\nNormalize the amount of transcript with that of elongation factor 1α-F2 (EF1α˗F2) or ribosomal protein 49 (rp49)9,16,21,22. These genes are reliable control genes for analyzing gene expression in the HPGs using qRT-PCR.\nPerform two-tailed t-test to detect the significant differences between two experiment groups (nurse bees vs. precocious foragers, 20E-treated bees vs. control bees, and methoprene-treated bees vs. control bees) using statistical software.\n\tNote: If F-test assumes the homogeneity of variance, Student's t-test can be used. If not, Welch's t-test can be used.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
