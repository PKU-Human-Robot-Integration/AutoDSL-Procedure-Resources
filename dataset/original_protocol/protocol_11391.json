    "All animal experiments were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee.\nNote: The sequence, construction and generation protocol for the adenoviral vectors pAd-CMV-Td-Tom, pAd-CMV-GFP and pAd-CAGA12-Luc/Td-Tom have been previously described11,12,13. All vectors are commercially available.\n1. Virus Titer Determination Using 50% Tissue-culture Infectious Dose (TCID50)\nPrepare 1 x 106 HEK293A cells in 10 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS media.\nSeed 100 µL of cell suspension into each well of a 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plate.\nPrepare 1 mL of a 1:100 dilution of virus stock in complete medium. Add 11 µL of diluted virus to each well of column 1.\nPerform serial 10-fold dilutions directly in the 96 well plate by mixing 11 µL of diluted virus with 100 µL of cell suspension until a final dilution of 1 x1012 is reached. Although cells are non-adherent at this stage, the number of cells transferred between wells remains constant.\nPipette 11 µL of each dilution into each column starting with the highest dilution of 104. Replace pipette tips with each dilution to limit cross-over of viral particles.\nAdd 11 µL of virus-free complete media to column 12 as a negative control.\nIncubate plate for 7 - 10 days at 37 °C with 10% CO2.\nUsing a microscope, score the number of wells in each column displaying signs of cytopathic or cytotoxic effects. Consider a well positive if any sign of infection is present.\nCalculate the fraction of positive wells for each dilution using the Reed and Muench (1938) statistical method14.\nCalculate the proportional distance (PD) using: (A-50)/(A-B), where A is the percentage response above or equal to 50% and B is the percentage response below 50%.\nCalculate TCID50 using: 10X-PD, where X is the dilution giving a response greater than 50%.",
    "Calculate viral titer from using the following: 0.69/(0.011 x TCID50) PFU/mL\n2. Adenovirus MOI Determination\nSeed 1.0 - 1.5 x 105 MDA-MB-231 cells with 500 μL of DMEM culture media containing 5% FBS in each well of a 12 well plate (35% cell confluency, 6 wells in total).\nCalculate the volumes of Ad-CMV-Td-Tom stock required for 0, 250, 500, 2500, and 5000 MOI using following formula: MOI = (volume [μL] x PFU/μL)/number of cells. For Ad-CMV-Td-Tom with a titer of 1 x 1010 (PFU/mL), the volumes of virus infection required MOIs are 0, 3.75, 7.5, 37.5, and 75 μL respectively.\nInfect the cells with the calculated volumes of Ad-CMV-Td-Tom in Section 2.2 by directly pipetting viral stock into the wells with thorough mixing.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C with 10% CO2 for 24 h.\nRemove the media from the wells and immediately fix the cells with 500 μL of 10% formalin for 5 min.  \nAspirate the formalin from wells and wash wells with 500 μL of PBS once.\nStain the cell nucleus with 500 μL of Hoechst solution for 5 min.\nRemove the Hoechst solution and wash the wells with 500 μL of PBS 3 times.\nImage the Td-Tomato protein and cell nucleus signal using 200X magnification on a fluorescence microscope. Excite Td-Tomato protein at 554 nm and the Hoechst dye at 352 nm.\nAnalyze images using ImageJ to determine the working MOI required for 100% infection of Td-Tomato15.\n3.

In Vitro Luciferase Assay\nPrepare a cell suspension of 3 - 5 x 104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 1 mL of DMEM media containing 5% FBS.\nInfect cell suspension with 2.5 μL of Ad-CAGA12-Luc (titer = 5 x 1010 PFU/mL, MOI = 2,500).\nSeed the infected cells into a 96 well plate at 3,000 cells/100 µL/well.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C with 10% CO2 for 24 h.\nRemove old media from wells and replace with 100 µL of fresh 5% FBS media with or without 0.1 μL of TGF-β per well (1 mg/mL in stock, 1 ng/μL as the final concentration) and in the presence or absence of 0.17 μL of TGF-β inhibitor per well (7 mg/mL in stock, 12 ng/μL as final concentration) (a novel TGF-β ligand trap protein, Chen et al., unpublished work).\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C with 10% CO2 for 24 h.\nThaw out the luciferase assay system substrate and prepare 1x cell culture lysis reagent in double distilled water (DDW).\nRemove media from the 96 wells and lyse wells with 50 μL of 1x cell culture lysis buffer on ice using an orbital shaker with gentle agitation for 30 min.\nTransfer 30 μL of lysate from each well into an opaque luciferase plate and allow the plate to warm to room temperature.",
    "On the luminometer software, create a new protocol. Select for 1 injector with measurements before and after injection. Set measurements before injection at 1 s for both Delay in Measurement and Integration Time. For after injection measurement, set the Injection Volume to 40 µL with a Delay in Measurement of 1 s after injection and 5 s Integration Time. Confirm settings by selecting OK.\nPlace the injector tube into DDW and click the Injector 1 button under the Prime settings to clean the injector tube before use. Next remove the injector tube from the DDW and place in air followed by two further Primes of injector 1 to flush all solution from the tube. Place the injector tube into Firefly substrate and again Prime twice to prepare the substrate.\nPlace the opaque luciferase plate with the samples into the luminometer and select Options on the software. Highlight the wells of interest and click Apply. Press Start to measure luciferase signal.\nOnce measurements are complete, remove and rinse the plate with water. Recover any remaining substrate into the injector tube by placing the tube into air and Prime injector 1 back into firefly substrate tube. Place the injector tube into DDW and perform two further Primes to clean the injector tube of any remaining substrate.\n6. Cell Preparation for Live Signaling Imaging In Vivo\n48 h before tumor implantation, seed 2 - 3x106 MDA-MB-231 cells into 175 cm2 flasks (10 flasks in total). Culture cells in 20 mL of DMEM media containing 5% FBS at 37 °C, 10% CO2.\n24 h later, add 300 μL of Ad-CAGA12-Luc (titer = 5 x 1010 PFU/mL, MOI = 2,500) into each flask. Keep cells in culture for another 24 h.",
    "On the day of implantation, remove the old media and wash the adenovirus infected cells once with 20 mL of PBS, pH 7.4. Add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA into the flask and shake the flask slightly to allow trypsin to cover all the flask surface. Place the flask in to the incubator 37 °C, 10% CO2 for 3 min.\nQuench the trypsin by adding 8 mL of FBS-containing DMEM media into flasks. Transfer all cell suspensions into a glass reagent bottle.\nCount the cell number using a hemocytometer and transfer 4.8 x 107 cells in two 50ml centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at RT to remove trypsin and resuspend cells in 720 mL of fresh FBS-DMEM media.\nTransfer the cell suspensions into a sterile 5 mL tube and add 160 μL Matrigel (10% total matrigel suspension).\nKeep cells on ice until implantation.\n7. Orthotopic Implantation\nWeigh 12 SCID mice and randomly allocate mice into control and treatment groups (6 mice/group).\nPerform the implantation in a sterile bio-cabinet to maintain a sterile environment. Anaesthetize the mouse using 2.5 - 4.5% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min. Place the mouse on a heat pad and dispense a drop of lubricating eye ointment onto both eyes to avoid corneal damage. Fix the mouse to the heat pad in a supine position while maintaining anaesthesia by placing the snout into a nose cone connected to the isoflurane.\nConfirm the success of anaesthesia by the lack of reaction to toe pinch. Reduce isoflurane to a maintenance dose of 1.5 - 2.5% with 1 L/min oxygen for the reminder of implantation.\nClean the skin from the fourth nipple on both sides to the midline by using the cotton swab dipped into 80% ethanol.",
    "Find the 4th mammary fat pad through palpation and squeeze the fat pad to further expose the tissue.\nMix the cell suspension well by pipetting up and down. Gently aspirate 50 µL of cell mixture into a 27G insulin syringe and inject into the mammary fat pad on both sides of the mouse.\nConfirm a successful injection by feeling for swelling of the fat pad. Release the fat pad gently and place the mouse back into the cage.\nLeave the cages on the heat pad for at least 30 min to allow the mice to gain consciousness and then place the cages back in the holding room for 3 days.\n8. IVIS Imaging\nOpen the Living Image software.\nInitialize the IVIS system by clicking the Initialize IVIS System button on the control panel. Wait until the temperature sign turns green.\nSelect the Luminescent Imaging Mode on the control panel.\nTurn on isoflurane anaesthesia to the chamber and IVIS system.\nAnaesthetize the mice by using 2.5 - 4.5% isoflurane with 1 L/min oxygen. Once anaesthetized, set isoflurane at 1.5 - 2.5% for maintenance. Inject 150 mg/kg body weight of D-luciferin into mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.\nImmediately transfer mice into the IVIS system, place them onto the temperature-controlled imaging platform and place their nose into the nose cone.\nClick on the Sequence Setup button on the control panel and select Medium Binning.\nSet up the imaging exposure time as follows: 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s, and 120 s. Start imaging approximately 3 min after the luciferin injection and continue to image until the signal starts to drop (normally this will take around 20 min).",
    "Remove the mice from IVIS while maintaining isoflurane anaesthetic through a nose cone and treat the mice with 50 µL PBS or 50 µL TGF-β signaling inhibitor (50 μg/tumor) via intra-tumor injection.\nPut the mice back in the cage and leave them on the heat pad for at least 30 min. Then place the cage back in the holding room.\nRepeat IVIS imaging procedure as described above the day following treatment.\n9. Data Analysis\nOpen saved files in Living Image software.\nFind the image information using View | Image Information.\nSelect photos taken at a similar time point with the same exposure time. Load photos as a group.\nUncheck the Individual box in Image Adjust to normalize the intensity.\nSelect Photon mode to analyze the intensity. Quantify the intensity of the signal by selecting the Region of Interest (ROI) button in ROI Tools.\nDrag the ROI circle to the region containing the bioluminescent signal and click the Measure button to acquire the signal intensity.\nSubscription Required.
