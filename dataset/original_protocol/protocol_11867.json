    "1. Collection of Samples\nEmbryo collection\nIn each embryo collection cage, use a minimum of 50 virgin females with 20−25 males for collections. Incubate these flies in a bottle with cornmeal-agar food (Table of Materials) for 1−2 days before beginning collections23.\nNOTE: More flies can be used, but the female-to-male ratio should be kept at 2:1.\nPre-warm apple juice agar plates (Table 1) at 25 °C overnight.\nNOTE: This is required for proper staging of embryos. If plates are drying out quickly, add a bowl with water to the incubator to increase the humidity of the chamber.\nAnesthetize flies from step 1.1.1 with CO2 and transfer flies to a collection cage. Place a pre-warmed apple juice agar plate with a small smear of yeast paste on the open end and secure to the cage with the red sleeve (Table of Materials). In order to clear older embryos, allow flies to lay embryos/eggs on an apple juice agar plate for 1 h at 25 °C.\nRemove the collection cage from the incubator. Invert the cage mesh side down and tap flies down to the bottom of the cage. Replace the apple juice agar with a new pre-warmed apple juice agar plate with a small smear of yeast paste. Discard the first plate.\nAllow flies to lay embryos/eggs on the new apple juice agar plate for 1 h at 25 °C. Discard this plate following the 1 h collection and proceed to the next step to collect embryos for injection.",
    "To collect late stage 17 embryos (20−21 h AEL), allow flies of desired genotype from steps 1.1.1−1.1.5 to lay on a new pre-warmed apple juice agar plates with a small smear of yeast paste at 25 °C for 1 h. Age plate for 19 h in a 25 °C incubator, so embryos will be 20−21 h of age at the time of imaging.\nNOTE: This step can be repeated as desired for multiple rounds of sample collection, injection, and imaging.\nCollect embryos from plates into a cell strainer with 70 μm nylon mesh by adding phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% nonionic surfactant (PBTx; Table 1) to cover the surface of the plate and loosen embryos from the surface using a paintbrush.\nDechorionate embryos collected in the cell strainer in a 50% bleach solution (Table 1) in a 100 mm Petri dish for 5 min with occasional agitation at room temperature. Rinse embryos 3x by swirling the cell strainer in PBTx in a Petri dish, using a fresh dish of PBTx each time.\nIf all embryos are of the correct genotype, proceed directly to step 1.1.10. If generation of embryos of the correct genotype requires a cross with heterozygous flies, select embryos of the correct genotype using the presence or absence of fluorescently marked balancer chromosomes. Use a stereomicroscope with fluorescent capabilities for genotype selection.\nNOTE: Balancer chromosomes marked with Deformed-yellow fluorescent protein; Kruppel-Gal4, UAS-green fluorescent protein (GFP); and twist-Gal4, UAS-GFP work well for genotype selection in late embryogenesis (Table 2)24,25,26.\nUsing a glass pipette, transfer embryos in PBTx to a 2% agarose gel slab (Table 1). Remove excess liquid with filter paper. Align ~6−8 embryos on the 2% agarose gel slab with posterior to the right and dorsal side facing up (Figure 1B).",
    "NOTE: The micropyle, the small hole through which spermatozoa enter the egg, is located at the anterior end of the embryo. The posterior end is more rounded. The trachea appears white and is located dorsally in the embryo, allowing for the distinction of the dorsal and ventral sides of the embryo (Figure 1B).\nPrepare a slide with one piece of double-sided tape. Firmly press the slide on top of the embryos to transfer them to the double-sided tape.\nDesiccate embryos by incubation at room temperature for ~25 min (no desiccant is used). Following desiccation, cover embryos with halocarbon oil.\nNOTE: Desiccation periods may vary depending on the temperature, humidity, and ventilation in the room. The incubation period should be used to set up the apparatus for injection and the confocal microscope for imaging, as described in sections 2 and 3 of this protocol.\nLarval collection\nSet up a cross with 5−10 virgin female flies of the desired genotype and half as many males of the desired genotype in a vial with cornmeal-agar food and incubate at 25 °C23.\nAfter 5−7 days, depending on the genotype, collect wandering third instar larvae from the vial gently with forceps. Rinse larvae in 1x PBS to remove food stuck to the larvae. Transfer larvae to an apple juice agar plate for genotyping as described in step 1.1.9 if necessary.\nRoll larvae on a tissue using a paintbrush to dry them off. Transfer 6−8 larvae to a slide prepared with double-sided tape using forceps.\n2. Preparation of Needles and Specimen Injection",
    "Pull needles on a micropipette puller prior to the initiation of this protocol. Secure capillary tubes into the needle puller and pull according to the standard needle shape and parameters for D. melanogaster injections (Table 3)27. Store needles in a Petri dish by anchoring in clay until use for injection.\nLoad a needle with 5 μL of 10 kDa dextran conjugated to sulforhodamine 101 acid chloride (Table of Materials) using a 20 μL gel-loading pipette tip during the 25-min desiccation period for embryos (step 1.1.12), or immediately following the transfer of larvae to the slide (step 1.2.3).\nLoad the needle into a needle holder and position in a micromanipulator secured to a steel base (Table of Materials).\nNOTE: The needle should be nearly parallel to the microscope stage for embryo injection and angled slightly downward for larval injections.\nSet the injection apparatus (Table of Materials) to 50 psi, 5−10 ms with a range of 10.\nNOTE: It may be necessary to alter these settings for the particular injection apparatus being used.\nPlace the slide on stage and brush edge of the needle against the edge of the double-sided tape at a 45° angle to create an angled, broken tip.\nNOTE: For embryos it is only necessary to break the tip enough to allow for flow of the 10 kDa dextran. A perfect needle has a slightly angled tip and only a small drop of dye will come out with each injection. For larvae, it is necessary to break the tip more, but with an angled tip to penetrate the larval body wall. A larger drop of dye will come out.\nPump foot pedal until the dye is at the tip of the needle.",
    "Align the needle so that it is parallel with the embryo or angled slightly downward toward the larva.\nMove the needle to puncture the posterior end of the specimen and inject the specimen by pumping the foot pedal. Inject ~2 nL of dye into embryos, and ~220 nL of dye into larvae.\nNOTE: The embryo or larva should flood with dye if the injection is successful.\nNote the time of injection for incubation purposes. Incubate embryos for 10 min at room temperature. Incubate larvae for 30 min at room temperature.\nContinue down the slide to inject additional specimens, noting the time of injection for each specimen.\nNOTE: Depending on the speed with which subsequent dissection and imaging steps can be performed, 4−8 specimens can be injected at a time.\n3. Preparation of Samples for Imaging\nImaging of embryos\nFollowing injection, prepare embryos for imaging. Apply petroleum jelly with a cotton-tipped applicator on the right and left sides of the samples on the slide as a spacer to prevent damage to the embryos upon placement of the coverslip.\nImage samples using a confocal microscope throughout the depth of the embryo with a 20x objective. Calculate the percentage of total samples with dye observed in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) using the following equation: % of samples with compromised BBB = Number of samples with dye accumulation in the VNC/total number of samples assayed.\nDissection and imaging of larvae\nPrepare slides for larval samples ahead of time. Mount two coverslips spaced approximately 0.5 cm apart to the slide with nail polish.\nNOTE: The coverslips function as spacers for the brain, so it is not damaged during the mounting process.",
    "Following the 30 min incubation, dissect the larvae in 1x PBS directly on the slide that will be used in imaging. First, use one pair of forceps to grab the larva halfway down the larval body, and use a second pair of forceps to separate the anterior and posterior halves of the larva.\nNext, use one pair of forceps to grip the anterior region at the mouth hooks, and use a second pair of forceps to invert the body wall over the tip of the forceps gripping the mouth hooks. The brain and VNC will be exposed.\nSeparate the brain and VNC from the body wall by severing the nerves, and remove the body wall from the slide (Figure 1C,D). Remove imaginal discs if desired.\nCover the sample with 10 μL of 80% glycerol and place a coverslip on top of the sample for imaging.\nImage through the depth of the nervous system tissue using a 20x objective. Calculate the percentage of total samples with dye observed in the VNC.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
