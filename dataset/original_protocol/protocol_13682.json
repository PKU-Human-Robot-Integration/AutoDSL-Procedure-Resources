    "All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research and Care Committee at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preoperative Preparation\nAdminister inhaled isoflurane (1 - 3% for maintenance and up to 5% for induction) via a nose cone to an appropriate anesthetic level. Monitor the adequacy of anesthesia by toe pinch with forceps. The lack of a response is considered adequate, and be sure not to overmedicate, as respiratory depression may occur.\nPlace the animal on its back on the dissecting microscope stage, with the abdomen centered in view of the objective. Immobilize the animal with surgical tape. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the animal to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nApply a smooth, thick layer of hair removal cream and leave it in place for 3 min. Check a small area for hair removal. Gently wipe off the cream and hair with 70% ethanol-soaked gauze.\nCleanse and disinfect the abdomen of the animal by wiping it with a 70% ethanol-soaked gauze followed by a betadine-soaked gauze. Maintain sterile conditions throughout the surgical procedure.\n2. Proper Exposure\nMake a midline incision in the skin from the xyphoid process to the umbilicus using a scalpel. Lift the peritoneum with Adson forceps and make a small hole in the midline using scissors.\nExtend the peritoneal incision to the length of the skin incision, taking care to remain on the midline (linea alba).\n\tNOTE: This will produce an upper midline abdominal laparotomy.\nElevate the liver with blunt retractors to expose the common bile duct. Clamp the common bile duct with a curved bulldog vascular clamp.\n\tNOTE: This maneuver prevents undesired infusion into the liver.\n3. Identification of the Pancreatic Papilla and Duodenotomy",
    "Identify the duodenum and, with Arruga forceps, retract it caudally to display the papilla.\n\tNOTE: The papilla is a white spot on the anterior surface of the second portion of the duodenum.\nRetract the duodenum caudally, allowing for the identification of the course of the pancreatic duct. With a 30½-gauge needle, puncture the wall of the duodenum tangentially, directly opposite the papilla.\n\tNOTE: The needle should follow the same angle as the duct as it enters the duodenum.\n4. Infusion.\nPass the catheter through the duodenotomy created in step 3.2 until the catheter is visible within the duct. Advance the catheter into the duct no more than 1 cm to prevent the bypass of minor ductal tributaries.\nClamp the catheter in place with a second curved bulldog vascular clamp. Turn on the pump and infuse the selected volume. The volume infused may range from 25 - 250 µL, with an ideal volume of approximately 150 µL.\nAdminister an intraperitoneal injection of approximately 1.5 mL of saline to offset losses. Cover the exposed bowel with a moist gauze to prevent desiccation.\nAt the conclusion of the infusion, remove the bulldog clamp that was holding the catheter in place. Use the bulldog clamp to gently remove the catheter from the pancreatic duct. Release the clamp from the common bile duct.\nClose the peritoneum and the skin in one or two layers using a running suture.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to close the duodenotomy, as it will seal on its own.\nAs postoperative analgesia, administer a dose of ketofen at 5 mg/kg during the procedure and one on the following day.\nReturn the mouse to its cage under a heat lamp until it recovers. Provide the mouse with food and water ad libitum.",
    "Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\n5. Sample Preparation\nPlace the animal in a carbon dioxide chamber or perform cervical dislocation.\nHarvest the pancreas, with the spleen, liver, and duodenum as controls. Fix the tissues in paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Cryoprotect the sample in 30% sucrose overnight, as previously described6.\nSnap-freeze the samples. Section the tissue at a thickness of 6 µm using a microtome. Perform imaging on a microscope with fluorescence imaging, as previously described7.\nSubscription Required.
