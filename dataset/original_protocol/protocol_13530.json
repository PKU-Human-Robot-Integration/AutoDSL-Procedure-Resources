    "NOTE: Refer to Figure 2 for a graphical representation of the protocol.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63927/63927fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic of the protocol. Row and column labels are indicated as a guide for setting up the breakable 96-well plate. Anticipated binding is shown in an example well for the antigen and the BSA. The curved arrow designates the rAb that is expected to be washed out of wells with BSA only. This figure was created with BioRender.com.

Buffer preparation\nPrepare 50 mL of immobilization buffer (aqueous solution of 50 mM Na2CO3; pH = 9.0).\n\t\nWeigh 191 mg of NaHCO3 and 23.9 mg of Na2CO3 on weighing paper and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube. Add 40 mL of 18 MΩ water and vortex to dissolve. Adjust the pH to 9.0 if needed before bringing the total volume to 50 mL with 18 MΩ water.\nPrepare approximately 200 mL of washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20) by adding 200 mL of PBS and then 100 µL of Tween-20 to a 250 mL bottle.\nPrepare 50 mL of binding buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)).\n\t\nWeigh 50 mg of BSA on weighing paper and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube. Add 50 mL of PBS and then 25 µL of Tween-20 to the tube. Vortex gently to mix.\nPrepare 50 mL of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS).\n\t\nWeigh 1.5 g of BSA on weighing paper and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube. Add 50 mL of PBS, and vortex gently to mix.\n\t\tNOTE: All buffers are recommended to be stored for up to 1 week at 4 °C for best results.\n2. Antigen immobilization",
    "Dilute the antigen in immobilization buffer to reach a concentration of 5 µg/mL.\nAdd 100 µL per well of antigen to the bottom of 24 wells of a breakable 96-well, flat-bottom plate in an 8 x 3 array (columns 1-3 for rows A-H). Cover the plate with sealing tape.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure that the surface of the well-plate had been treated to maximize adsorption of mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. These pretreated plates are commercially available.\nIncubate at 4 °C overnight.\nThe following day, wash the plate 3x with washing buffer.\n\t\nInvert the plate briskly in the sink to dispose of the liquid and tap the plate on a pile of paper towels to remove the excess liquid.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 300 µL per well of washing buffer to wells containing the antigen. Remove the liquid as described in 2.4.1. Repeat the washing step a total of three times.\n3. Blocking of nonspecific sites with BSA\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 300 µL per well of blocking buffer to the 24 antigen-coated wells and 24 empty wells of the 96-well plate (columns 1-6 for rows A-H).\nIncubate the plate for 1 h at ambient temperature.\nWash the plate with 300 µL per well of washing buffer a total of three times. Refer to step 2.4 for a detailed description of washing the plate.\n\t \n4. Serial dilutions and addition of the rAb solution\nCAUTION: The following steps involve radioactivity. Steps should only be performed by those with radiation safety training. Researchers should double glove and perform steps with adequate shielding.\nSynthesize the rAb under investigation using the method of choice. The rAbs used as an example were synthesized as described previously19.\n\tNOTE: This protocol focuses on the characterization of a rAb once radiolabeled.",
    "Make 8 x 3-fold serial dilutions (designated for rows A-H on the plate) of the rAb in the binding buffer.\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of the serial dilutions will vary for each rAb. Details are discussed in the Discussion section. If the dilution factor changes, the volume needed for each dilution should be recalculated to ensure enough volume for 1) binding of the rAb in each well, 2) seeding the following dilution, and 3) aliquoting a rAb standard solution for gamma counting to measure the radioactivity of the total rAb added to each well.\n\t\nCalculate the volume of stock rAb needed to make a 1.2 mL solution of the first concentration (label as A).\nAdd 800 µL of binding buffer to microcentrifuge tubes labeled B, C, D, ... to H. Add 1.2 mL minus the volume calculated in step 4.2.1 of binding buffer to a microcentrifuge tube labeled A.\nAdd the volume of stock rAb calculated in 4.2.1 to tube A. Vortex gently to mix and then spin down using a mini microcentrifuge to collect all liquid at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 400 µL from tube A to tube B. Vortex to mix and then spin down using a mini microcentrifuge. Repeat adding from B to C, C to D, ..., G to H.\nAdd 100 µL per well of each dilution to three wells immobilized with antigen and three wells blocked with BSA only. For example, add dilution A to wells A1-A3 (antigen) and A4-A6 (BSA).\nAdd 100 µL of each dilution to microcentrifuge tubes labeled A std - H std. Save these tubes as rAb standards to be assayed in the gamma counter.\nIncubate the plate for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle rocking.\n5. Wash plates and assay radioactivity",
    "Label microcentrifuge tubes for each well (A1 to A6, B1 to B6 ... through H1-H6). Use two different colored markers to color-code samples if desired-one for wells coated with antigen and one for wells with BSA only.\nAspirate the rAb from each well using a vacuum aspirator.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 300 µL of washing buffer to each well. Aspirate the washing buffer. Repeat the wash a total of five times.\nBreak apart the wells into the appropriate microcentrifuge tubes.\nCount the radioactivity in the tubes using a gamma counter. Count first the tubes with the antigen (H1, H2, H3 to A1, A2, A3), and then those with BSA only (H4, H5, H6 to A4, A5, A6). To minimize interference, separately count the standards for each dilution (H std to A std) at a different time.\n6. Data analysis\nNOTE: The supplemental files contain corresponding spreadsheet and statistical analysis templates for analyzing and plotting the data.\nIn a spreadsheet, calculate the total, specific, and nonspecific binding for each sample (see the spreadsheet template attached as a supplemental file).\n\t\nCalculate \"Bound Activity\" as the counts per minute (CPM) of the sample (obtained from the gamma counter) divided by the CPM of the appropriate standard. Calculate \"% Bound\" as Bound Activity times 100.\nCalculate \"Total Bound, mol/L\" by multiplying \"% Bound\" with the concentration (mol/L) of the rAb added. Calculate \"Total Bound, mol\" by multiplying \"Total Bound, mol/L\" with the volume of rAb added in liters (0.0001 L).\nCalculate \"Specific Binding, mol\" by subtracting \"Total Bound, mol\" of the BSA dilutions from the antigen dilutions such that A1 pairs with A4, A2 with A5, A3 with A6, B1 with B4, etc.\nCalculate \"Nonspecific Binding, mol\" by subtracting \"Specific Binding, mol\" from \"Total Binding, mol\" for each well.",
    "In the statistical analysis plotting software, plot the concentration of rAb added (nmol/L) on the x-axis versus binding (mol) on the y-axis. Create separate groups to plot in triplicate total binding, specific binding, and nonspecific binding. Perform a nonlinear fit analysis by selecting the following parameters in the software used (Table of Materials; see the statistical analysis template attached as a supplemental file).\n\t\nSelect New Analysis. Under XY analyses, select Nonlinear regression (curve fit). Make sure all the data is selected under Analyze which data sets? and then select Ok.\nOn the Model tab, under Binding - Saturation, select One site - Specific binding. On the Confidence tab, select Identify 'ambiguous' fits. Leave all other parameters as default and select Ok.\n\t\tNOTE: This will calculate the KD and Bmax for the total, specific, and nonspecific binding. The KD of the specific binding is the KD in nmol/L of the rAb bound to the antigen.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
