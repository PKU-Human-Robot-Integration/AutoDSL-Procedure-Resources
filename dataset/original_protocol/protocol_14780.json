    "This protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethical Committee (Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie) of the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands.\n1. Preparation of the Perfusion Fluid\nNote: The total volume of the perfusion fluid prepared for normothermic machine perfusion according to this protocol is 2,233 ml and the targeted osmolarity of the perfusion fluid is 302 mOsmol/L.\nFrom the components of the perfusion fluid described in Table 1, keep the human packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and human albumin separated. Mix the rest of the components in a sterile manner and store the solution in a sterile bag for transportation to the operating room (OR). Do this in a sterile environment (ideally a Good Manufacturing Practice facility) or in a laminar flow cabinet in a culture room.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nComponents,Quantity\nPacked red blood cell (Hematocrit 60%),840 ml\nFresh frozen plasma,930 ml\n\"Human albumin 200 g/L (Albuman, Sanquin)\",100 ml\n\"Modified parenteral nutrition (Clinimix N17G35E, Baxter International Inc.)\",7.35 ml\n\"Multivitamins for infusion (Cernevit, Baxter international Inc.)\",7 μl\n\"Concentrated trace elements for infusion (Nutritrace , B.

Priming of the Perfusion Device",
    "Add the components of the perfusion fluid, including the human packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, human albumin and the solution prepared in step 1.1 to the machine via the connector on top of the oxygenators and remove all the air bubbles from the tubing.\nSwitch on the venous pump and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the screen. Then turn on the arterial pump and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the screen.\nNull the pressure meters against atmospheric pressure by following the instructions on the screen. This ensures that the pressure measured during the perfusion is the real pressure at the level of the portal vein and the hepatic artery.\nStart the oxygenation using carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) at a flow rate of 4 L/min. The air flow will be divided among the two oxygenators (2 L/min per oxygenator) and this should result in a pO2 of around 60 kPa (or 450 mmHg) in the perfusion fluid. For longer perfusions, it is advisable to use separate sources of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This allows for small adjustments in the O2/CO2 ratio, which can be used to adjust the pH and pCO2 of the perfusion fluid.\nTake a perfusion sample for blood gas measurement 15-20 min after the device has been primed and monitor the pH and electrolytes accordingly.",
    "NOTE: Be sure to discard about 3 ml of perfusion fluid before taking the samples, as this fluid is in the peripheral tubing and does not represent the perfusion fluid in the system. Add an 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution for buffering capacity, aiming for a physiological pH (7.35-7.45). For example, add 25-35 ml of an 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution and check the pH and bicarbonate levels in the perfusion fluid by taking samples for blood gas measurement at regular intervals.\n3. Procurement and Preparation of Donor Livers\nNote: Procure the organ using the standard technique of in situ cooling and flush out with cold preservation fluid (0-4 °C)19. To facilitate cannulation of the artery, leave a segment of the supratruncal aorta attached to the hepatic artery (Figure 2A).\nFlush out the bile ducts with the preservation fluid (i.e., University of Wisconsin solution). Ligate the cystic duct with a surgical suture.\nPack and store the organ in a standard sterile donor organ bag and box with crushed ice for subsequent transportation to the MP center.\nStart the back table procedure immediately upon arrival of the donor liver in the operating room.\n\t\nTake a sample of at least 10 ml of the preservation fluid for microbiological testing.\nRemove the diaphragmatic attachments to the bare area of the liver as well as any remaining cardiac muscle from the upper cuff of the vena cava with surgical scissors.\nDissect the artery and portal vein using dissecting scissors and ligate side branches using surgical sutures or hemoclips.",
    "Close the distal end of the supratruncal aorta segment using a non-absorbable monofilament suture (e.g., 3-0 Prolene). Insert the arterial cannula into the proximal end of the supratruncal aorta and secure with sutures (Figure 2A). Use the cannula provided in the disposable package as supplied by the manufacturer of the perfusion device.\nInsert the venous cannula in the portal vein and secure with sutures. Use the cannula provided in the disposable package. The hepatic vein remains uncannulated.\nFlush out the bile duct with the preservation solution. Insert a silicon catheter into the bile duct and secure with sutures.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not insert the catheter too deeply into the bile duct as this may cause injury to the biliary epithelium.\nFlush out the liver with 0.9% NaCl solution via the portal vein cannula as follows:\n\t\t\nIf the graft has been preserved in University of Wisconsin solution as the preservation solution, flush out the liver with 2,000 ml of cold (0-4 °C) 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 500 ml of warm (37 °C) 0.9% NaCl solution.\nIf the graft has been preserved in Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution as the preservation solution, flush out the liver with 1,000 ml of cold (0-4 °C) 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 500 ml of warm (37 °C) 0.9% NaCl solution. The purpose of the warm flush is to prevent a significant drop in the temperature of the perfusion fluid.\nPerform the warm flush immediately before connecting the liver to the perfusion device.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Always keep the duration between warm flush and start of NMP less than 1-2 min.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nDonor characteristics (N = 12),Number (%) or Median (IQR)\nAge (years),61 (50-64)\nGender (male),8 (67%)\n\"Type of donor  DCD, Maastricht type III  DBD\",10 (83%)  2 (17%)\nBody mass index (BMI),27 (25-35)",

Normothermic Machine Perfusion\nPosition the liver in the organ chamber with the anterior surface facing downward. Immediately connect the liver to the primed perfusion device by connecting the portal vein cannula to the portal inflow tube of the perfusion device and the arterial cannula to the arterial inflow tube of the device.",
    "Start perfusion on both portal and arterial side by following the manufacturer’s instructions on the screen. Set the mean arterial pressure at 70 mmHg and the mean portal venous pressure at 11 mmHg.\nTake perfusion fluid samples every 30 min for immediate analysis of blood gas parameters (pO2, pCO2, sO2, HCO2- and pH) and biochemical parameters (glucose, calcium, lactate, potassium and sodium) using a conventional blood gas analyzer. Be sure to discard about 3 ml of perfusion fluid before taking the samples, as this fluid is in the peripheral tubing and does not represent the perfusion fluid in the system.\n\t\nTo take these samples aspirate the perfusion fluid using a 1 ml syringe from the sampling connectors that are part of the disposable tubing set of the perfusion device. For each sample use a new syringe and immediately remove any air bubbles from the syringe upon aspiration of perfusion fluid. Then insert the syringe in the blood gas analyzer and follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the manual of the analyzer.\nCollect plasma from the perfusion fluid, freeze and store at -80 °C for determination of alkaline phosphatase (AlkP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea and total bilirubin. Collect plasma after 5 min of centrifugation of the perfusion fluid at 1,500 x g and 4 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
