  "procedures": [
    "**Whole blood assay:**\n1. Collect blood into two heparinized blood tubes \\(for unstimulated control and forskolin).\n  2. Add forskolin stock to one tube, 10 &#xB5;M final concentration.\n  3. Incubate control and forskolin stimulated sample for 24 hrs at 37&#xB0;C incubator or water bath.\n  4. Centrifuge in table top centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 min.\n  5. Store plasma at -80&#xB0;C.\n  \n**Tissue preparation:**\n1. Euthanize and debleed animals and rapidly excise DRGs and spinal cord tissue, immediately freeze on dry ice or liquid nitrogen, store at &#x2013;80&#xB0;C.\n  \n**Tissue homogenization, acidic oxidation \\[1] and solid phase extraction:**\n1. Add 200 &#xB5;l of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid containing 20 ng/ml of the internal standard rhamnopterin to the defrosted tissue \\(small pieces of about 2-3 mg) or plasma sample \\(50 &#xB5;l) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\n  2. Homogenize tissue with reusable pellet pestles and motor \\(Kontes Glass Company, Vineland, New Jersey, USA) for 45 s with at least 10 strokes, remove 10 &#xB5;l of the suspension for protein determination.\n  3. Add 100 &#xB5;l of iodine solution \\(1% \\(w/v) iodine and 2% \\(w/v) potassium iodide in 1 M hydrochloric acid), mix and incubate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.\n  CRITICAL STEP: Always prepare fresh iodine solution.\n4. Stop the reaction by adding 200 &#xB5;l of 5% \\(w/v) ascorbic acid in water and vortex up to decolorization.\n  CRITICAL STEP: Always prepare fresh ascorbic acid solution.\n5. Activate the cation-exchange cartridge \\(Oasis MCX extraction cartridge) with 1 ml methanol and 1 ml water before loading of the sample.\n  6. Load the completely decolorized sample onto the cartridge, allow binding and vacuum elute unbound substances, wash with 1 ml 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and 1 ml methanol.\n  7. Elute bound substances with 1 ml of 8% \\(v/v) ammonia solution in 25% methanol.",
    "CRITICAL STEPS Points 5-7: Use a maximum speed of 1 ml per min for vacuum elution\n8. Evaporate the organic solvent to dryness by a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40&#xB0;C.\n  9. Reconstitute the residue with 200 &#xB5;l water/0.002% formic acid \\(v/v) and transfer the solution in a screw vial with a glass insert containing a Silikon/PTFE seals in the screw cap \\(e.g. Macherey-Nagel).\n  \n**Chromatography**\n1. Use a Gemini C18 column \\(150 &#xD7; 2 mm i.d., 5 &#xB5;m particle size, 110 &#xC5; pore size) for chromatographic separation, connected to a pump and autosampler for injection of the samples \\(e.g. Agilent 1100 Series binary pump \\(G1312A) and degasser \\(G1379A) connected to an HTC PAL autosampler).\n  2. Use as mobile phase eluent A \\(water with 0.002% formic acid) and eluent B \\(methanol with 0.002% formic acid) and apply the following gradient:\n  \n0 - 0.5 min A/B 100:0\n0.5 - 4 min a linear gradient from 100:0 to 5:95\n4 - 7   min A/B 5:95\n7 - 8   min a linear gradient from 5:95 to 100:0 and finally\n8 - 13  min A/B 100:0\n3. Inject 10 &#xB5;l of the sample onto the LC-MS/MS.\n  4. Set the flow rate to 0.3 ml/min and the runtime to 13 min.\n  5. Biopterin, neopterin and rhamnopterin elute after 5.7, 4.1 and 5.5 min, respectively.\n  \n**MS/MS analysis**\nFor determination of total biopterin and neopterin concentrations use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry employing a 4000 Q TRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a Turbo V source.\n1. Choose the negative ion mode with an electrospray voltage of -4300 V at 400 &#xB0;C and set the auxiliary and nebulizer gas to 50 psi, the curtain gas to 10 psi and the collision gas to 5 psi Use pure nitrogen as gases.",
    "2. Use precursor-to-product ion transitions of m/z 236 to 192 for biopterin \\(collision energy -20 V), 252 to 192 for neopterin \\(-22 V) and 265 to 192 for rhamnopterin \\(-20 V) as quantifier for the multiple reaction monitoring \\(MRM) with a dwell time of 150 ms.\n  3. Evaluate concentrations of the samples with calibration standards \\(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 ng/ml) using Analyst software 1.4 \\(Applied Biosystems). Every tenth sample in each run should be a quality control \\(1, 10, 50 ng/ml)."
