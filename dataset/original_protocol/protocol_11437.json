    "NOTE: This protocol is described in McArdle et al.11. A timeline is provided in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of the culture plate\nWash the 35-mm culture dish containing a 10-mm glass-bottom well with 1 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) for 15 min to lower the hydrophobicity of the glass-bottom.\nWash the culture plate twice with 1 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to get rid of all the HCl.\nWash the culture plate twice with 1 mL of 70% ethanol.\nRinse the culture plate with 1 mL of the cell specific culture medium (here, use α-MEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% non-essential amino acids).\nNote: The treated culture plate containing the culture medium can be stored in the CO2 incubator with a humidifier at 37 °C until the next day.\nGrow the cells (MSCs and MCF-7 co-culture) in the treated glass-bottom well of the 35-mm culture dish to 100% confluency. Co-culture 35,000 MSC cells and 75,000 of MCF7 cells for 24 h.\n2. Preparation of the collagen gel\nStore the micropipette tips used for pipetting the collagen gel in the freezer to prevent the polymerization of the collagen upon contact.\nNote: This is the most critical step.\nDetermine a volume of rat tail collagen I to be used based on the concentration of the collagen stock. Prepare 100 µL of collagen gel for this assay.\nNote: High concentration of rat tail collagen I stock works better. Determine the volume of 10x Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium to be used to dilute the collagen accordingly.\nCombine on ice rat tail collagen I (3.8 µg/mL stock), 10x Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and 1x cell culture medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and the appropriate chemoattractant to a final concentration of collagen of 2.4 mg/mL.",
    "Add to the mixture 4.5% of sodium bicarbonate solution to neutralize the collagen gel.\nNote: The volume of sodium bicarbonate solution added may vary based on the exact pH of the other reagents. It is best to test the mixture with pH strips to ensure neutral solution, or use a pH indicator in the culture medium.\nLay 80 µL of the collagen mixture over the cells within the glass-bottom well of the culture dish.\nAllow the collagen gel to polymerize for 30 min in a CO2 incubator with a humidifier at 37 °C.\nCover the collagen gel with 2 mL of cell medium with reduced serum (2%) and incubate the cells at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator with a humidifier for 24, 48, or 72 h.\nCaution: The plate should be handled with care to prevent the collagen gel from detaching from the glass bottom.\n3. Example of preparation of collagen gel using a rat tail collagen stock of 3.8 µg /mL\nOn ice, combine 114.5 µL of rat tail collagen, 16.6 µL of 10x DMEM, and 33.1 µL of culture medium containing the chemoattractant.\nNeutralize the collagen mixture with 14.0 µL of sodium bicarbonate.\nContinue as in step 2.5.\n4. Imaging of the cells\nGently remove the media from the dish.\nGently rinse the gel with 1 mL of PBS.\nFix the cells with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min.\nWash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nStain the cells with DAPI solution (100 ng/mL) for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Image the cells using a confocal microscope at different locations and taking 400 µm z-stack images of each location in 16 µm steps. The microscope used has a disk scanning unit that enables confocal imaging using a white light, arc excitation source. Use a 20X lens utilized with numerical aperture of 0.75.\nReconstitute images .\n\t\nOpen images for a given gel (approximately 25 images) and create an image stack by clicking image → stacks → images to stack. The first image corresponded to the bottom of the gel (z = 0 µm), the second image corresponded to the first step in the z direction (z = 16 µm), the third image corresponded to the second step in the z direction (z = 32 µm). Assess each nucleus at each image depth and designate the depth at which the nucleus was in sharpest focus as the invasion depth for that particular cell.\nSubscription Required.
