Plasmids used for cotransformation are in the note below (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2910_28.csv",
    "Note: The OUT cells are cotransformed with the plasmids encoding the HBT-xUB - xUba1 (xE1) pair and the xUbc1 (xE2) - xRsp5 (xE3) pair. The control cells are cotransformed with the same set of plasmids, except that the xRsp5 gene is replaced with the C777A mutant gene of xRsp5 that is catalytically inactive. A comparison of HBT-xUB conjugated proteins purified from the OUT cells and control cells would enable us to identify proteins with enhanced levels of HBT-xUB conjugation in OUT cells, and these proteins are assigned as the potential substrates of Rsp5.\nAdd 300 μL PEG 4000/LiOAc/TE to the mixture of the cells and the plasmids and vortex the mixture thoroughly.\nShake the tubes at 30°C for 30 min and then add 35 μL DMSO to each transformation mixture and vortex for 10–30 s to mix thoroughly.\nHeat shock the transformation mixture by putting the tubes in a 42°C water bath for 15 min.\nSpin down the cells at 1,800 × g for 3 min and wash the cells with 1 mL of sterile water.\nSpin down the cells again at 1,800 × g for 3 min and resuspend the cell pellet with 100 μL sterile water.\nPlate resuspensions onto SC Dex ura- trp- plates. Incubate the plates in a 30°C incubator for 1–2 days until colonies appear.\nVerification of the expression of the OUT components in the cell\nTiming: 5 days\nPick colonies from transformation plates and use each colony to inoculate 5 mL SC Dex ura- trp- media.\nCulture the cells overnight in a 30°C shaker at 220 rpm. The OD600 of the overnight culture should reach 1.2 in the next morning.\nDilute the culture to OD600 0.3 in 150 mL SC Dex ura- trp- media supplemented with 4 μM biotin in a 500 mL autoclaved flask.",
    "Shake the culture at 30°C for 5–6 h until the OD600 reaches 1.0.\nPellet the cells with an autoclaved centrifuge bottle or three 50 mL Falcon tubes at 1,800 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cell pellet with 30 mL of deionized water three times.\nResuspend cells with a same volume (150 mL in total) of SC ura- trp- media containing 1% raffinose.\nIncubate the cell culture for 2 h in a 30°C shaker.\nInduce protein expression by adding 20% galactose to a final concentration of 2% (w/v).\nCulture the cells in a 30°C shaker overnight.\nThe next day, aliquot the culture to three 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 1,800 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cells.\nResuspend each tube of the cells with 1 mL of DI water.\nTransfer the cell suspension to three clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge each tube to remove DI water.\nResuspend the cell pellet with an equal volume of Buffer A (0.2–0.4 mL).\nLyse the cells.\nAdd an equal volume of glass beads.\nLyse the cells with Mini-Beadbeater-16 by beating the cells for 60 s for each cycle and use a total of 4 cycles.\nTransfer the cell lysate to a centrifuge tube.\nNote: You may add a small amount of defoamer, for example, about 4–5 μL of Antifoam C Emulsion (Sigma, Cat#A8011) to avoid foaming during beads-beating. After each cycle, wait for about 1 min on ice to cool down the samples. Do not put the tubes on ice for long because the high concentration of urea in buffer A may be crystallized at icy temperature.\nLysate clear up.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 20,000 g for 30 min.\nTransfer and combine the clear supernatant to a clean tube.",
    "Save 50 μL as \"lysate\" for western blot analysis.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the cell lysate by Bradford assay after diluting the lysate 1,000 fold.\nNote: The typical protein concentration of the lysate should be around 10 mg/mL. Save 50 μL of the lysate to assay the expression of the components of the OUT cascade by SDS-PAGE gel analysis and western blotting.\nCritical: The urea concentration in the 1,000-fold diluted cell lysate is low and would not affect the Bradford assay. To prepare diluted cell lysate, one may add 0.8 μL cell lysate to 800 μL deionized water, followed by the addition of 200 μL Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate, and measure the concentration at 595 nm with a spectrophotometer.\nPause point: Now it is a good time to check the expression of xE1, xE2, and xE3 in yeast lysates by SDS-PAGE and western blot probed with anti-Flag (xE1), anti-V5 (xE2) and anti-myc (xE3) antibodies, respectively.

We calculate the amount of streptavidin beads to be used according to the input of total protein at the beginning of the purification (step 33). During the subsequent purification steps, the high concentration of SDS in buffer B would interfere with the measurement of protein concentration by Bradford assay.\nWash the streptavidin resin.\nThe next morning, spin down the streptavidin resin at 120 × g for 1 min.\nSave the supernatant as \"flowthrough 2″ for western blot analysis.\nWash the streptavidin resin by resuspending sequentially with 1.5 mL of each of Buffer C, Buffer D, and Buffer E and centrifuge the tubes after each wash to collect the beads.\nSave the wash solution as \"wash 2″ for western blot analysis.",
    "Keep the streptavidin resin bound with HBT-xUB conjugated proteins in 1 mL Buffer E.\nNote: This is the sample for trypsin digestion and proteomic analysis in the subsequent steps.\nPause point: You may keep the resin at room temperature temporarily or at −80°C for long-term storage.\nSave the sample of streptavidin resin for western blot analysis.\nTransfer 50 μL of the resin resuspension to a clean tube.\nWash the resin three times with 500 μL of PBS each time.\nWestern blot analysis for tandem purification.\nAdd 10 μL of 6× SDS loading buffer to 50 μL samples collected from step 32c, 34c, 34e, 35e, 37b, 37d and 39b.\nMix and boil the samples at 100°C for 5 min.\nLoad 10 μL of each sample to PAGE gel for western blot analysis.\nUse an anti-UB antibody to probe for substrate proteins conjugated with HBT-xUB.\nCheck the western blot.\nNote: If there is enough HBT-xUB conjugated protein bound to the resin, as shown by the western blot, the beads can be digested by trypsin to prepare samples for MS analysis.\nSample processing for proteomics analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nWash beads with ABC buffer.\nAdd 300 μL streptavidin beads to a PierceTM spin column with a crew cap.\nWash the beads with 400 μL of 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate (ABC) buffer three times.\nWash beads with ABC/DTT buffer.\nAdd 297 μL ABC and 3 μL of 100 mM DTT dissolved in 50 mM ABC buffer to the beads.\nIncubate for 1 h with shaking and rotation at 37°C.\nWash with ABC/IAA buffer.\nAdd 3 μL of 500 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in ABC buffer to the bead mixture to give a final concentration of 5 mM IAA in the solution.\nIncubate the mixture in the dark at room temperature with rotation for 40 min.",

    "Note: Proteomic analysis of proteins bound to the streptavidin resin provides the name of the proteins, the sequence of the peptide fragments identified by MS, and the PSMs as an indication of the abundance of the proteins purified from the cell lysates. Software such as Perseus14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] may also be used for analyzing the proteomics data in steps 49–53. Users are suggested to consult resources in the literature to see if they are suitable for their needs.\nIdentify the proteins with a PSM ratio greater than 2 between the two cell populations.\nNote: Proteomics analysis of HBT-xUB conjugated proteins purified from the three biological repeats of OUT and control cells is performed to identify proteins with PSM ratio >2 in at least two of three repeated experiments and these proteins are assigned as the potential substrates of Rsp5 from the OUT screen. These proteins show enhanced conjugation to HBT-xUB in OUT cells compared to the control cells and are the likely substrates of Rsp5. Log2 PSM ratio is listed in the table so we prioritize the proteins with Log2 PSM ration > 1 for further analysis\nCalculate the p-values of PSM by student’s t-test for all the proteins identified by proteomics.\nConvert the p-values to -Log10 p-values.\nA volcano plot is generated to plot Log2 PSM ratio (x-axis) of each identified protein against the Log10 p-value (y-axis).\nNote: A volcano plot is to reveal the statistical significance of the proteins purified from the OUT and control cells to facilitate the analysis of the proteomic results.

This may cause insufficient cooling of the tubes and overheating of the cell lysate.\nProtein purification.\nTransfer the lysate into centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 30,000 × g for 30 min.\nCollect the supernatant by transferring it to a new and clean 50 mL tube.\nWash 500 μL of Ni-NTA beads with 1 mL PBS three times.\nAdd Ni-NTA beads to the cell lysate in step 57b.\nIncubate the mixture at 4°C overnight with rotation.\nLoad the suspension into a clean gravity-flow column.\nWash once with 15 mL lysis buffer and twice with 15 mL wash buffer sequentially.\nElute the protein bound to the Ni-NTA resin with 5 mL of elution buffer.\nNote: For sufficient elution, close the stopper of the column, resuspend beads with 5 mL of elution buffer and wait for 10–15 min so that the proteins can dissociate from the resin.

    "To verify the ubiquitination of potential substrates by Rsp5, we need to compare the ubiquitination level of the substrates between yeast cells with suppressed and elevated Rsp5 activity. Rsp5 is an essential gene for yeast viability, so the deletion of Rsp5 gene will make the yeast cells nonviable in a standard growth medium without supplementing oleic acid.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] We thus conditionally express a dominant negative mutant of Rsp5 (Rsp5-DN) to suppress the native Rsp5 activity in the cell. The gene of Rsp5-DN has a premature stop codon at L451 before the HECT domain and would express a truncated Rsp5 without the UB ligase activity. We cloned Rsp5-DN into the pYES vector for expression under the pGAL promoter. The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is also important for assaying substrate ubiquitination in yeast. We chose to use yeast strain cim3-1 for the assay because the strain is deficient in proteasome activity at 37°C.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] By coexpressing Rsp5 and the substrate proteins in the cim3-1 cells, we can enhance the level of ubiquitinated substrates of Rsp5 in the cell for their detection by western blots following immunoprecipitation.\nUse the glycerol stock of the cim3-1 strain to inoculate 3–5 mL YPD media and culture the cells in a 25°C shaker to prepare the cells for yeast cotransformation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2910_30.csv\nNote: Please refer to the Preparation Step (steps 3–16) for procedures of yeast cell transformation and refer to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for the cotransformation of plasmids.\nPlate transformed yeast cells on the SC Dex ura- leu- plates. Incubate the plates at 25°C for 3–4 days until colonies appear.",
    "Note: The cim3-1 cells grow slower than wild-type yeast cells. It will take a longer time for transformed cim3-1 cells to grow into visible colonies. Since pYES-URA and pESC-LEU vectors are used for cotransformation, Ura- and Leu- plates should be used to select for cells cotransformed with the two plasmids. According to the genotype of cim3-1, histidine must be present in the synthetic media, while tryptophane is optional.\nPhenotype check\nTiming: 2–3 days\nSteps 78–82 in the procedures below are to check the phenotypes of cim3-1 cells transformed with pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). A phenotype check is performed in order to identify the clones showing growth inhibition due to the expression of Rsp5-DN in the cell. Cells with the pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN plasmid are induced to express Rsp5-DN on the galactose plate but not on the dextrose plate. Because of the lethality associated with Rsp5-DN expression and the deficiency of proteasome activity in the cim3-1 strain at 37°C, cim3-1 cells expressing Rsp5-DN would not grow on galactose plates at 37°C but would grow on dextrose plates at 25°C. Colonies cotransformed with the pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN and pESC-Leu-substrate plasmids showing such a phenotype are selected for assaying the ubiquitination of the Rsp5 substrates in the cell. In contrast, cells cotransformed with plasmids expressing wt Rsp5 and the substrate would not show any difference in growth on dextrose and galactose plates at 25°C or 37°C, respectively.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2910-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The scheme for phenotype check of cim3-1 cells co-transformed with the pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN plasmid and the pESC-Leu-substrate plasmid\nTransformations 1–4 correspond to the co-transformation reaction of pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN with different substrate expressing plasmids. For each transformation reaction, colonies 1–8 are picked for growing on both the dextrose and galactose plates.",
    "Prepare selection plates (SC ura- leu-) with dextrose and galactose, respectively. Draw rows of squares on the back of the plates.\nFor yeast cells co-transformed with the pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN plasmid and pESC-LEU-substrate plasmids (from step 77), pick 6–8 single colonies from each plate.\nResuspend each colony in 30 μL of sterile water in separate tubes.\nAdd 1 μL of resuspended cells from each transformation to the center of each square and spread the liquid drop with a sterilized inoculating loop.\nNote: Each colony should be assigned the corresponding squares on the dextrose and galactose plates for seeding (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Make sure there is no cross-contamination and label the transformations and colonies well.\nIncubate the dextrose plates at 25°C and galactose plates at 37°C overnight or longer until colonies appear. Colonies showing the Rsp5-DN phenotype should grow on the dextrose plate at 25°C but not on the galactose plate at 37°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nSubstrate pulldown and Western blot for UB\nTiming: about 1 week\nCulture enough yeast cells for the ubiquitination assay.\nPick up colonies from the dextrose plates with cotransformation of plasmids expressing substrate proteins and wt Rsp5 or Rsp5-DN.\nInoculate 5 mL of SC Dex ura- leu- medium with each colony.\nGrow the culture overnight at 25°C with shaking.\nThe next day, use the 5 mL overnight culture to inoculate 35 mL of SC Dex ura- leu- medium for the growth of another overnight culture at 25°C.\nCritical: Only pick the colonies showing the Rsp5-DN phenotype from the cotransformation reaction with the pYES-URA-Rsp5-DN plasmid and the pESC-Leu-substrate plasmid. Use 150 mL Erlenmeyer flasks for the 35 mL culture and shake the culture at 250 rpm for efficient aeration.",
    "Note: The Rsp5-DN cells would grow much slower than the wt Rsp5 cells. If the overnight culture for the wt Rsp5 cells is much higher than that of the Rsp5-DN cells, make a proper dilution of wt Rsp5 cells before inoculating the 35 mL culture so that the starting ODs of the two cell cultures are similar.\nChange the yeast cells from dextrose medium to galactose medium.\nPellet the cells at 1,800 × g for 3 min.\nWash the cells three times with 1 mL DI water, and then remove all the liquid.\nTransfer all the cells into 35 mL of SC Gal ura- leu- medium.\nGrow the cells overnight in a 25°C shaker.\nNote: Again, use 150 mL Erlenmeyer flasks for the 35 mL culture and set the shaker at 160 rpm for good aeration.\nNote: We change the cells from dextrose to galactose medium so that the genes under pGAL promoter in the pYES-URA and pESC-LEU plasmids would be induced for expressing Rsp5 and the substrate proteins, respectively.\nThe next morning, shift cells to 37°C and incubate for 7–8 h.\nNote: After being induced for protein expression, the cim3-1 cells are shifted from 25°C to 37°C to induce proteasome-deficiency in the cell so the ubiquitinated proteins in the cell can accumulate.

Rsp5-mainly catalyzes the attachment of K63-linked UB chains on the substrate proteins, which is responsible for non-degradative functions, such as mediating protein-protein interactions in the cells.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] Still, Rsp5 catalyzed substrate ubiquitination has been associated with protein degradation through proteasome or lysosome pathways.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] So we check and compare the stability of Rsp5 substrates in wild-type (wt) yeast strain and rsp5-1 strain that encodes a L733S mutation in the HECT domain of Rsp5.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19],20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] The mutation will render the cell deficient in Rsp5 activity at 37°C. If the Rsp5 substrate is degraded by the proteasome upon their ubiquitination, they would have prolonged stability in rsp5-1 cells.\nSEY6210.1 (WT) and YXY705 (rsp5-1) cells were cultured in YPD media at 25°C and prepared for the transformation reaction with 1 μL (∼ 1 μg) pCM189-URA-substrate-Flag plasmids that express Flag-tagged substrates.",
    "Note: SEY6210.1 is a wt yeast strain with endogenous Rsp5 expression and it is used as a positive control. YXY705 (rsp5-1) carries the L733S mutation in the HECT domain of Rsp5 that inactivates its UB ligase activity.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] The pCM189-URA plasmid has a tetO operator and a URA3 marker. Expression of genes in the pCM189-URA plasmid is inhibited when doxycycline is added to the culture media.\nThe transformed yeast cells are plated onto SC Dex ura- plates and incubated at 25°C for 3–4 days until colonies appear.\nTET-off system check.\nPick a single colony from each plate and inoculate 4 mL of SC Dex ura- media.\nAliquot to two separated 15 mL tubes.\nAdd doxycycline to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL into one of the tubes and mark the tubes well.\nCulture the tubes at 25°C overnight with shaking.\nCentrifuge at 1,800 × g for 3 min to collect the cells.\nResuspend the cells and boil the cells with 30 μL 1× SDS loading dye at 100°C for 10–15 min to break the cell.\nSpin down the cell debris at 16,000 × g for 1 min.\nLoad 10 μL supernatant to SDS-PAGE gel for western blot analysis with anti-Flag antibody to check the expression of the substrate under the TET-off system.\nNote: This step is optional, the aim is to check the substrate expression with or without doxycycline in TET-off system and make sure it works before the stability assay.\nIn the morning, pick colonies from plates and use them to inoculate 2 mL of SC Dex ura- media.\nIncubate the culture tubes at 25°C with shaking.\nIn the evening, dilute the starting culture into 40 mL of media in a 250 mL sterilized flask.\nIncubate the flask at 25°C overnight with shaking.",
    "Note: A growth curve of each strain should be measured before the stability test in order to estimate the growth time of the yeast cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Based on the growth curve, the overnight culture should be inoculated with a proper amount of starting culture so it can reach the mid-log phase the next morning.\nThe next morning, measure OD600 of the culture, which should be in the mid-log phase (0.4–0.6). If the OD600 is too high, dilute the culture to 0.2 and grow it again to mid-log phase.\nShift the culture to 37°C for 20 min to prewarm the cells, and prewarm some fresh media to 37°C.\nNote: 37°C is the non-permissive temperature for protein degradation in rsp5-1 cells, while the WT strain is not affected at 37°C.\nSpin down the cells and resuspend the pellet in 40 mL prewarmed SC Dex ura- media supplemented with 2 μg/mL doxycycline.\nMeasure OD600 again and collect 7 OD600 of cells. This is marked as time zero.\nNote: The volume of the cells collected is calculated by the formula V = 7/OD600 of the current culture.\nPut the culture back in the 37°C shaker.\nTreat cells with TCA.\nPellet the cells in the collected culture by centrifugation.\nResuspend the cell pellets with 1 mL 10% TCA.\nIncubate the cell suspension on ice for 30 min.\nNote: TCA is a strong acid, and it is corrosive to the skin. Wear gloves and avoid touching it directly. Cells treated with 10% TCA are dead, and all activities in the cells are stopped.\nMeasure the OD600 of the cell culture growing at 37°C every 2 h (0, 2 and 4 h) and collect 7 OD600 of cells at each time point.\nRepeat step 101 with all samples collected.",
    "Pause point: After the last sample was collected, the cells treated with TCA can be stored at 4°C for one week.\nCell wash.\nSpin down cells in the TCA solution at 16,000 × g for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the cell pellet with 500 μL of 0.1% ice-cold TCA.\nSpin down the cells again at 16,000 × g for 1 min.\nCarefully remove all the supernatant.\nCell lysis.\nResuspend the pellet with 70 μL 2× urea boiling buffer and one pellet-volume of glass beads.\nLyse the cells by beads-beating for 5 min using Mini-Beadbeater-16.\nQuickly spin down the samples to settle the beads to the bottom.\nHeat the tube to 42°C for 5 min to aid the denaturation of the proteins.\nAdd 70 μL 2× urea sample buffer with DTT.\nRepeat steps 105b-d to lyse the cells by bead beating again.\nCentrifuge the cell lysates at 16,000 × g for 5 min.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\nNote: This is the sample for analyzing the level of substrate proteins in the cell lysate. Do not boil the samples as the urea in the buffer may be decomposed by high temperature.\nAnalyze the samples by SDS-PAGE and western blot.\nNote: Use the anti-Flag antibody to probe for Flag-tagged substrates and use an anti-G6PDH antibody to probe for G6PDH as a loading control. 20 μL of the cell lysate corresponds to 1 OD600 of the cells as the source of the lysate."
