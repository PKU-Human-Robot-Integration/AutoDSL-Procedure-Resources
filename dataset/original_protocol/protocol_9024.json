    "1. Prepare Dye-coated Needles\nElectrolytically sharpen a 160 μm diameter tungsten wire15. Final needle tip diameters should range from 5-50 μm. The number of needles needed depends on the size of the region being labeled. We prepared 5 needles for 3-5 injections into the posterior exterolateral nucleus (ELp).\nThe night before the experiment, place a drop (<0.25 μl) of 2 mM dextran-conjugated Alexa Fluor 10,000 MW dye onto the distal 100 μm of each needle.\nAllow the needles to air dry at room temperature, leaving concentrated dye at the tip. Store the needles at 4 °C in a dark container to protect them from light.\n2. Prepare Animal for Surgery\nInduce general anesthesia by placing the fish in a solution of 300 mg/L MS-222 in tank water.\nWeigh the fish and measure fork length (tip of snout to fork of caudal fin) and body depth (maximal dorso-ventral distance in the transverse plane). These measurements should fall within the ranges indicated in Table 1 so that the fish fits inside a recording chamber small enough to place under a water-immersion microscope objective (Figure 1).\nImmobilize and electrically silence the fish by injecting 100 μl of 3 mg/ml flaxedil into the dorsal body musculature.\nFill the recording chamber (Figure 1A) with tank water. Place the fish ventral-side down on the platform in the center of the chamber (Figure 1). Deliver an aerated solution of 100 mg/L MS-222 using a pipette tip placed in the fish's mouth (1-2 ml/min). Stabilize the fish with rods fixed in wax placed on both sides of the body (Figure 1C). Monitor the fish's health by checking for continuous blood flow in the ocular vessels and a normal body color.",
    "Rotate the platform along its long axis and lower the back end of the platform so that one side of the dorsal surface of the fish's head is exposed above the water while the rest of the fish's body remains submerged. A small piece of Kimwipe should be placed on any non-submerged portion of the skin to prevent drying.\n3. Surgery (Figure 2)\nThe basic surgical procedure described here is well established and reliably used for blind in vivo recordings in mormyrids16. For other applications, expose the desired regions for labeling and recording. The region containing axon terminals of the cells of interest must be reachable by a dye-coated needle. The region containing more proximal segments of those same axons must have sufficient space above the tissue to accommodate the working distance of the water-immersion lens (2 mm in our case).\n \nApply a 0.4% solution of lidocaine to the exposed surface of the head using a Q-tip.\nUsing a scalpel blade, cut the perimeter of a rectangular piece of skin. Remove the rectangle using a pair of forceps. The size of the rectangle will scale with fish size, but should be approximately 3 mm X 5 mm for a 6.2 cm fish (Figure 2A). The lateral edge of the rectangle should align with the center of the eye, the anterior edge of the rectangle should be just posterior to the eye, and the medial edge of the rectangle should be just lateral of the fish's midline.\nExpand the exposed skull region anteromedially to expose an additional 2.5 mm square non-overlapping area (Figure 2B).\nCompletely clear and dry the exposed surface of the skull using the scalpel blade to scrape away any excess tissue and Kimwipes and forced air to dry the surface (Figure 2C).",
    "Glue a metal post to the anteromedial exposed skull region using Super Glue. Wait until the glue is completely dry (Figure 2D).\nRemove a rectangle of skull, approximately 2 mm X 4 mm for a 6.2 cm fish. Use a dental drill with a ~0.5 mm diameter ball mill carbide tip to thin the perimeter of the rectangle. Then, using a scalpel and forceps, cut the perimeter of the rectangle and peel it away to expose the underlying brain. Additional drilling or cutting with small scissors may be necessary to fully expose EL (Figure 2E). If muscle bleeding occurs, an electrocautery unit may be used.\nCut away both the dura mater (pigmented) and the pia mater (clear) using spring scissors or a needle and remove the cut portions with a pair of forceps. The anterior and posterior portions of the exterolateral nucleus (EL) are now visible, ELa and ELp, respectively (Figure 3A).\n4. Retrograde Labeling of Axons of Interest\nPosition a manipulator with a dye-coated needle (made in Step 1) above the target region containing axons of interest, in our case ELp.\nSwiftly insert the needle approximately 25 μm into the tissue. Wait 15-30 seconds, until all the dye has come off, and then retract the needle.\nRepeat with additional fresh needles as needed, placing each one in a different location so that the dye is distributed throughout the target region. We used 3-5 needles per preparation.\nRinse excess dye from the cavity with Hickman's ringer solution.\nWait at least 2 hours for dye uptake and transport.\n5. Visualization of Axons of Interest",
    "Place the recording chamber, along with the fish, underneath the objective of an upright, fixed-stage epifluorescent microscope. As the body of the fish occludes light penetration, both white and fluorescent light sources must come from above. Careful placement of a fiber optic light source above the skull cavity allows satisfactory brightfield images. For epifluorescence viewing, fluorescence filter specifications should match the absorption/emission spectrum of the dye.\nSwitch respiration to fresh tank water and maintain the same flow rate. Place a ground wire in the exposed brain cavity and connect to the ground of the recording headstage (see 6.3).\nPlace a pair of recording electrodes next to the base of the tail and connect to a differential amplifier and recording device (e.g. audio monitor, oscilloscope, or computer) to monitor the electric organ discharge command (EODC). After the fish recovers from anesthesia, the EODC can be used as an indicator of the fish's condition.\nPrepare a scaled sketch of the brain region viewed at low magnification. Include major blood vessels as landmarks (may vary from fish to fish) to identify the exact location of labeled axons visible only under high magnification (Figure 3D).\nConfirm dye placement. First view entire tissue with brightfield illumination for orientation (Figure 3A). Then view with fluorescent illumination (Figure 3B). ELp will have diffuse labeling (Figures 3B and 3C). Minimize fluorescence excitation to limit the photodynamic and phototoxic effects of the dye.\nUse the vessels as landmarks to locate ELa under high magnification. Illuminate with fluorescent light while searching for a labeled axon near the surface. (Figure 4).\n6. Record Extracellular Activity",
    "Pull suction recording electrodes using 1 mm OD, 0.58 mm ID borosilicate capillary glass with filament. Ideal tip size will depend on the diameter of the target axons, which in our case is 0.1-0.2 μm17. For our application, electrode tip diameters were 1.5 ± 0.4 μm (range: 1.0-2.4 μm) with a 5 mm long, narrow shank in order to approach labeled axons without moving the surrounding densely packed tissue.\nFill electrodes with filtered Hickman's ringer solution. Final tip resistance is 45.2 ± 38.0 MΩ (range: 16 to 155 MΩ).\nPlace the electrode in an electrode holder with a pressure port and connect it to an amplifier headstage mounted on a manipulator. Run a pressure line from the pressure port to a T-junction ending in a manometer and a syringe for monitoring and controlling pressure, respectively.\nConnect the headstage to an amplifier and an analog-to-digital acquisition device.\nWith 30 mbar outward pressure in the electrode line, place an electrode next to a labeled axon. A low-light level camera interfaced with imaging software is used to visualize pipette placement. Start near the tissue surface and advance the electrode towards the axon. As you approach the axon, the outward pressure should cause a slight, but noticeable movement of the axon.\nWhile the electrode is next to the axon, (Figure 4A, top) record the potential at the electrode while presenting test stimuli (in our case, we used 100 msec monophasic positive and negative transverse pulses at an intensity of 20 mV/cm; Figure 1A). Action potentials should not be observed, although an electrical artifact confirms proper recording/stimulation (Figure 4A, bottom).\nRelease the outward pressure in the electrode and repeat stimulation/recording. Action potentials should still not be observed (Figure 4B).",
    "Apply slight (125 ± 25 mbar) suction to the electrode and repeat stimulation/recording. Action potentials should now be observed in response to stimulation (Figure 4C). Spontaneous activity may also occur. If action potentials are not observed, release the suction, clear the electrode with slight pressure, move the electrode slightly, and attempt suction again. Once action potentials are visible, close the pressure line.\nStimulate and record as desired.\n7. Termination and Disposal\nOnce all desired recordings are complete, switch to respiration with 100 mg/L MS-222 until the EODC has stopped. No EODC should be detected for at least 10 minutes.\nDispose of the fish according to institutional guidelines and approved animal care protocols.\n8. Representative Results\nFor our particular application, we are interested in studying stimulus coding by central sensory neurons. Successful recordings from labeled axons allow analysis of single-unit responses to sensory stimulation18. Figure 5A shows representative action potentials evoked by transverse electrosensory stimulation using bipolar electrodes located on the insides of the left and right walls of the recording chamber. Spike times can be presented as a spike raster plot (Figure 5B). A 25 msec pre-stimulus recording window shows the low level of spontaneous activity. This particular ELa \"small cell\" is long-pass tuned to stimulus duration at a stimulus intensity of 6 mV/cm, increasing the number of spikes per repetition as stimulus duration increases (Figure 5C). The mean first spike latency is 4.28 ± 0.16 msec, consistent with the expected latency for small cells in ELa11.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3921/3921fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Specifications for a recording chamber that can fit underneath the objective of a fixed-stage epiflourescent microscope. (A) To-scale square recording chamber made from plexiglass showing top, side and back views. Paired sets of stimulating electrodes (asterisks) at the periphery allow for either transverse (red-black) or longitudinal (blue-yellow) stimulation. An additional piece of plexiglass in the corner, with a rubber-lined hole in the center (orange), holds a suction pipette that maintains a constant water level. Two vertical stainless steel posts screwed into the bottom of the chamber (solid green) connect to stainless steel posts (green outline) attached to the platform supporting the fish (light grey, detailed in C) via adjustable disc clamps. A photograph of the chamber is shown below the to-scale drawing. (B) Individual and assembled views of the circular plastic disc clamps used to secure the platform to the vertical posts. Each disc clamp has a groove (green) for a post and a center hole for the tightening screw. Disc clamps are rotated so the grooves are perpendicular to each other. Tightening the screw (red) clamps the posts in place to prevent further vertical and rotational movement of the platform. (C) Front and side to-scale views of the plexiglass platform used to hold the fish in place. The platform is coated with a layer of paraffin wax (blue) that holds wooden dowels (black bars) in place to support the fish. Tubing for respirating the fish passes through a hole in the 'headboard' of the platform and ends in a pipette tip placed in the fish's mouth. A stainless steel head post (gray bar) connects to the platform via a ball joint allowing 360 degree rotation. Stainless steel horizontal posts (green) are screwed into either end of the platform.

Fish that are too small may be less likely to survive the surgery and will have a small ELp, making dye placement challenging.
