    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol is divided into three main sections that each offers a unique readout for culturing animal cap cells by monitoring lysosomal activity and macropinocytosis, cell migration and focal adhesions, as well as drug treatments that mimic Wnt signaling.\nCultured animal cap cells for lysosomal studies\nTiming: 1 day\nThis assay provides a powerful tool to study and visualize lysosome movements utilizing animal caps as an in vivo model in Xenopus using lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1-RFP) or the multivesicular body maker CD63-RFP after microinjection of DNA plasmids (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1C′). Animal cap cells also provide a good model to study how Wnt signaling stabilizes lysosome accumulation (Albrecht et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) using the CD-63-RFP multivesicular body marker co-injected with xWnt8 mRNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). SiR-Lysosome is a very useful reagent that specifically labels active lysosomes (Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). It contains a fluorescent photostable silicon rhodamine (SiR) dye linked to a pepstatin A peptide (Marciniszyn et al., 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). SiR-Lysosome binds to the activated and cleaved form of lysosomal Cathepsin D actin as a reporter of lysosomal activity. Its far-red emission (imaged in standard Cy5 filter sets) decreases phototoxicity and autofluorescence with compatibility for GFP- and mCherry-tagged proteins. By simply adding SiR-Lysosome to the culture medium, lysosomes containing active Cathepsin D can be visualized and their activation is increased by the Wnt mimic lithium chloride (LiCl) lysosomes (Albrecht et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3B′).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1823-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B–B‴). Co-injection of xWnt8 mRNA results in a striking stabilization of CD63, a marker of the intraluminal vesicles presents in multivesicular bodies and lysosomes. Canonical Wnt is a potent regulator of lysosome function. The images on the right panels show the merged red, green, blue and visible light channels. Scale bar, 10 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1823-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Xenopus animal cells display lysosomes and macropinocytosis activation after LiCl treatment, which mimics Wnt signaling by inhibiting GSK3 inhibition\n(A and A′) Control cells treated with SiR-Lysosome.\n(B and B′) LiCl treatment increases active lysosomes. Mimicking Wnt signaling with LiCl shows that lysosomes become more active.\n(C and C′) Untreated cells show low uptake of the macropinocytosis marker TMR-Dextran 70 kDa.\n(D and D′) LiCl treatment increases macropinocytosis (arrowhead). Scale bar, 10 μm.\nDilute SiR-Lysosome (1 mM stock) to a working concentration of 1 μM in culture medium (0.5 μL of the reagent per 500 μL L-15 medium 50% diluted with water).\nOptional: Addition of the calcium channel blocker, verapamil (working concentration of 1 μM), to SiR-Lysosome L-15 solution can increase signal intensity. This reagent is included with the commercial kit indicated in the Table above. Final concentrations of DMSO should not exceed 2% for treatment of cells, and a DMSO alone control should always be carried out.\nFor visualizing and studying lysosomes by microinjecting MVB markers in frog embryos by dissociating and culturing animal caps:\nFertilize Xenopus laevis embryos in vitro using excised testes and culture them in 0.1 × MMR solution. Then inject frog embryos with DNAs or mRNAs (in our examples 20 pg per blastomere of LAMP1-RFP or CD63-RFP DNAs) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1C′), as well as CD63-RFP and membrane GFP DNAs ± Wnt8 mRNA) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Note: Perform the microinjection into the animal pole at 2–4 cell stage and culture them until midblastula stage 8.5 before excision (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nDissect Animal caps at blastula stage 8.5–9 in 1 × MMR solution.\nDissociate the cap manually by pipetting the caps 3–5 times with a glass Pasteur pipette in 1 × MMR solution.\nPlate the cells in L-15 medium diluted to 50% with H20 (Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]) on fibronectin-coated coverslips in a 12-well plate (6–8 caps per condition).\nIncubate the cells for 12–18 h between 15°C–20°C in normal atmosphere.\nWash with PBS 3 times to remove dead cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nFix cells for 15 min using 4% Formaldehyde diluted in PBS (4% PFA) at 20°C with limited light exposure (0.5 mL per well).\nWash with PBS 3 times to remove PFA (0.5 mL per well).\nApply mounting medium with DAPI onto a glass microscope slide using 10 μL per coverslip. Avoid air bubbles in the pipette tip and place the coverslip carefully onto the mounting medium.\nMicroscopic examination of RFP and GFP and image acquisition was performed using a Carl Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Inverted Microscope with Apotome and Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent filters for DAPI, FITC, and rhodamine. Images were acquired using 63× objectives and the Zeiss Zen software.\nFor image acquisition Fiji software is recommended. This can be downloaded at http://fiji.sc[href=http://fiji.sc].\nFor live-cell analyses (as seen in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]): plate the dissociated animal cap cells (6–8 caps per condition) in a glass-bottom chamber (#0 cover glass, Cell E&G: GBD00003-200) for 12–18 h.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

Scale bar, 10 μm.\nAfter step 6 of the preparation of explants[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section described above:\nInsert cell chamber for live imaging with conditions in the inverted microscope at 20°C (without CO2).\nImage cells for 20 min or more with an image acquisition rate of 1 frame per 30 s. Images were collected with a Zeiss Observer.Z.1 inverted microscope with Apotome, DIC, and Colibri LED with green fluorescence filters using a 63× oil Plan-APOchromat objective. The microscope, including the fluorescence filters, was controlled by Axiovision 4.8 software. Both vertical and inverted microscopes were fully motorized.\nVideo editing was performed using the Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2021 software.\nCell viability was maintained for 72 h.\nFor SiR-Lysosome assay (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3B′), after step 6 of preparation of explants[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]:\nIncubate cells with SiR-Lysosome in 50% L-15 culture medium for 60 min at room temperature (500 μL per well).

Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nAnimal cap cells for migration and focal adhesions\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This section provides a way of monitoring changes in cell-cell adhesion, as well as cell migration, that can be triggered by activation of the Wnt pathway (Bachir et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Nusse and Clevers, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) driving a cell growth program that can become inappropriately activated in cancer. Knowing how Wnt, focal adhesions, and cell migration cooperate will improve our understanding of embryonic development and tumorigenesis. In this improved protocol animal cap cells are able to adhere to fibronectin and display focal adhesions and actin stress fibers.\nFor live-cell analyses of focal adhesions:\nFollow steps 1–6 in the preparation of explants[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section using frog embryos microinjected with 20 pg of DNA/cell at the 2–4 cell stage encoding the focal adhesion marker Tes-GFP or the F-actin tracer LifeAct (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4C).

    "The activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is a driving force in many human cancers, especially colorectal, hepatocellular, and mammary carcinomas (MacDonald et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Nusse and Clevers, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Galluzzi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]; Tejeda-Muñoz and Robles-Flores, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). Wnt causes the stabilization and nuclear transport of newly-synthesized transcriptional regulator β-catenin, and the generally accepted view in the field is that the canonical effects of Wnt growth factors are caused by the transcription of β-catenin target genes. Recent studies indicate that Wnt is also a regulator of many other cellular physiological activities, such as macropinocytosis, endosome trafficking (Colozza et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), protein stability, lysosomal activity (Holland et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Taelman et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]), and cell adhesion (Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nFor drug treatment assay of cultured animal cap cells:\nAfter 12–18 h following cell plating onto glass-bottom chambers (steps 1–6 in the preparation of explants[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section):\nWash 3 times in 50% L-15 medium.\nProceed with the movie generation by mounting a cell chamber for live imaging in the inverted microscope at room temperature and imaging as described in the section on cultured animal cap cells for lysosomal studies[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] under the live-cell analyses protocol.\nAdd drug treatments: GSK3 inhibitors (40 mM LiCl) or controls (40 mM NaCl or DMSO). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nStart recording immediately.\nGenerate a movie in the same cells using the conditions used to film before drug treatment.\nNote: The use of antibodies for focal adhesions such as Tes, Zyxin, Vinculin can also be performed in cells plated on coverslips. In this case, following steps 1–6 in preparation of explants:\nWash 3 times with PBS (0.5 mL per well) to remove dead cells.\nFix cells for 15 min in 4% PFA diluted in PBS (0.5 mL per well).",
    "Wash with PBS 3 times to remove PFA (0.5 mL per well).\nPermeabilize cells with digitonin (6.5 μg/mL) for 10 min in PBS (0.5 mL per well).\nWash 3 times with PBS to remove detergent (0.5 mL per well).\nBlock cells for 1 h in blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS to reduce background from nonspecific binding.\nIncubate the samples with the primary antibody for 24 h at 4°C.\nWash 3 times with PBS (0.5 mL per well).\nIncubate with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 20°C (0.5 mL per well) (ab150117 goat anti-mouse and ab150084 goat anti-rabbit are recommended).\nWash 3 times with PBS (0.5 mL per well).\nMount cells in mounting media with DAPI.\nDry slides in a dark area at 20°C for 16 h prior to imaging."
