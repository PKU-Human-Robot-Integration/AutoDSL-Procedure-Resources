    "Growth and synchronization of nematode populationSelect L4 larvae of transgenic animals, which express mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) or co-express mitochondria-targeted GFP (mtGFP) together with the autophagosomal marker LGG-1 fused with DsRed in body wall muscle cells, on a freshly E. coli (OP50) seeded NGM plate. Use at least three plates for each nematode strain.Incubate the nematodes at the standard temperature of 20 °C.Four days later the plates contain mixed animals population.Synchronize nematodes by picking L4 transgenic larvae and transfer them onto separate freshly E. coli (OP50) seeded plates (Palikaras, K. and Tavernarakis, N. [2016]. Intracellular Assessment of ATP Levels in Caenorhabditis elegans. Bio-protocol 6(23): e2048; Palikaras, K. and Tavernarakis, N. [2016]. Measuring Oxygen Consumption Rate in Caenorhabditis elegans. Bio-protocol 6(23): e2049).Add 20 L4 larvae per plate. For each experimental condition, use at least five plates (see Note 1).Oxidative and mitochondrial stress assayKill E. coli (OP50) bacteria seeded on NGM plates by using a UV crosslinker (UV irradiation for 15 min; 0.5 J).Add paraquat or CCCP to the top of seeded NGM plates at 8 mM and 15 μM final concentrations in the total agar volume respectively. Paraquat and CCCP are well-known inducers of mitophagy in mammalian cells (Narendra et al., 2010).Gently swirl the plates and allow each drug to spread to the entire surface.Let the plates dry at room temperature.Transfer 2- or 4-day-old of adulthood adult transgenic animals on paraquat- or CCCP-containing plates.Incubate the transgenic animals at 20 °C.Upon two days of exposure to each drug prepare the nematodes for microscopic examination.Mounting nematodes for imagingAdd a droplet of 10 μl M9-levamisole buffer (20 mM final concentration, see Note 2) on 2% agarose pad (see Note 3).Collect transgenic animals with an eyebrow/eyelash hair and place them in M9-levamisole droplet immobilizing transgenic animals for imaging (see Note 4).",
    "Gently place a coverslip on the top press. Samples are ready for microscopic examination with either a Zeiss AxioImager Z2 epifluorescence microscope or a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 confocal microscope.Imaging of transgenic nematodesCapture single transgenic animals or single body wall muscle cells using a camera attached to the microscope.Acquire (a) fluorescent images of whole transgenic nematodes expressing mtRosella in body wall muscle cells by using Zeiss AxioImager Z2 epifluorescence microscope or perform (b) z-stack method of an entire single body wall muscle cell expressing mtGFP together with autophagosomal marker DsRed::LGG-1 by using Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 confocal microscope. Imaging parameters such as microscope and camera settings (lens and magnifier used, filters exposure time, resolution, laser intensity, gain etc.) should be documented and kept the same during the imaging process. Save collected images from each method (a or b) and proceed to data analysis.Analyze data from imaging processProcess images acquired from (a) method with ImageJ software to measure the average pixel intensity values and total area for each fluorescent image of transgenic worm. Focus on body wall muscle cells of the head region avoiding intestinal autofluorescence (Figures 1 and 2; see Note 5). To analyze the area of interest manually:Select the ‘split channel’ command via the ‘image’ and ‘colour’ drop-down menu to convert images.Use the ‘freehand selection’ tool to enclose the fluorescent area. Select the ‘measurement’ command via the ‘analyze’ drop-down menu to perform pixel intensity analysis. Normalize pixel intensity values by dividing with the selected area values by using the Microsoft Office 2011 Excel software package (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).Upon normalization calculate GFP to DsRed ratio.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328041119_5638.jpgFigure 1. Mitophagy induction upon oxidative and mitochondrial stress. Transgenic nematodes expressing mtRosella in body wall muscle cells, were exposed to paraquat or CCCP.",
    "Mitophagy induction is signified by the reduction of the ratio between pH-sensitive GFP to pH-insensitive DsRed (n = 100; ***P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA). Arrowheads point out intestinal autofluorescence. Size bars denote 20 μm. Images were acquired using a 10x objective lens. Error bars denote SEM values.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328041213_1682.jpgFigure 2. Image analysis by using ImageJ software. 1. Open an acquired GFP signal-image with ImageJ software; 2. Select split channel’ command via the ‘image’ and ‘colour’ drop-down menu to convert images; 3. Keep ‘green channel’ image; 4. Use the ‘freehabnd selection’ tool to enclose the fluorescent area (head region); 5. Select the ‘measurement’ command via the ‘analyze’ drop-down menu to perform pixel intensity analysis; 6. Perform the same analysis pathway with an acquired DsRed-signal image.Process images collected from (b) method with Zeiss ZEN 2012 software to find mitochondria engulfed by autophagosomes, known as mitoautophagosomes.Determine mitoautophagosomes number by manually counting the co-localization events between mitochondrial (mtGFP) and autophagosomal marker (DsRed::LGG-1) displayed in each stack of body wall muscle cell (Figure 3). Analyze the data by using the Microsoft Office 2011 Excel software package (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328041402_6412.jpgFigure 3. Monitor mitoautophagosomes formation in vivo. Transgenic nematodes co-expressing a mitochondria-targeted GFP (mtGFP) in body wall muscle cells together with the autophagosomal protein LGG-1 fused with DsRed, were treated with paraquat or CCCP. Mitophagy stimulation is signified by co-localization of GFP and DsRed signals (for each group of images mitochondria are shown in green on top, autophagosomes in red below, with a merged image at the bottom). Increased number of mitoautophagosomes upon oxidative and mitochondrial stress (n = 50; ***P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA). Size bars denote 20 μm. Images were acquired using a 40x objective lens. Error bars denote SEM values."
