    "Prior to the start of the BL-CFC culture, ESCs are differentiated according to previously described protocols (Sroczynska et al., 2009). Flk1+ cells are isolated using magnetic sorting following the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). The procedure described below has been optimized for adherent BL-CFC culture allowing the use of time-lapse microscopy. The quantities and volumes listed were further adapted for the comparison of two culture conditions: with or without doxycycline.Note: Before starting, prepare working solutions as described in “Recipes”. Careful, BL-CFC culture medium should be prepared fresh.Day 0 Put 1 ml/well of 0.1% gelatin solution (see Recipes) into eight wells of Costar® 6-well cell culture plates (one plate of four wells for each line) and leave at room temperature (RT) for at least 20 min.For each line, introduce 0.425 million Flk1+ cells obtained after embryoid body differentiation of ESCs and counted using a Neubauer counting chamber (Sroczynska et al., 2009) into a 15-ml Falcon tube containing 5 ml of IMDM + 20% FBS.Centrifuge at 290 x g for 5 min.For each line, remove the supernatant using an aspirating pipet connected to the vacuum pump BVC control, gently tap the bottom of the tube to loosen the cell pellet and resuspend into 8.5 ml of BL-CFC culture medium.Note: Always use individual pipets and tips for each cell line to avoid cross-contamination. Aspirate the gelatin from the pre-coated Costar® 6-well cell culture plate wells using an aspirating pipet.Resuspend and evenly distribute 2 ml/well of cell suspension into four gelatin-coated wells for each cell lines.Note: This means that 0.1 million Flk1+ cells are added per well. Agitate the plates parallel to the bench doing vertical and horizontal small jolting movements.",
    "Note: Careful not to do circular movements which would result in the formation of a vortex and, consequently, in all the cells going to the center of the well. Place the plate into a 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator for 24 h.Keep the BL-CFC culture medium in the fridge for the doxycycline dilution on the next day.Note: The differentiation rate can be affected by cell confluence. Make sure the cells are equally spread across the surface of the wells to insure that the emergence of round blood cells will occur at the same rate everywhere in the wells. Day 1Prepare 0.2 μg/μl doxycycline dilution by adding 4 μl of 10 mg/ml doxycycline stock solution (see Recipes) to 196 μl of BL-CFC culture medium kept in the fridge from the day before. Mix well.Take out the culture plates from the incubator and check under the microscope that the wells are all similar to each other.Add 10 μl of 0.2 μg/μl doxycycline dilution to each +dox condition well (two wells for each line at a final doxycycline concentration of 1 μg/ml). Add the doxycycline directly in the center of the wells and mix directly after by agitating the culture plates carefully.Add 10 μl of the BL-CFC culture medium to each -dox condition well as control (two wells for each line).Put back the two plates inside the incubator and place them carefully into the IncuCyte HD microscope.Note: Don’t write on top of the wells and avoid splashes of the medium on the lid to prevent malfunctioning of the IncuCyte HD as it takes pictures from the top. While the lid condensation is going away, set up the IncuCyte HD device using the IncuCyte software on the computer:Connect to the device and log in.",
    "Click on “Schedule Upcoming Scans” in the Task List panel on the left (see Figure 1 A).In the Drawer Setup window, select an empty vessel on the screen, right-click on the location where you inserted your first plate and click on “New” (see Figure 1).Keep this vessel selected and select the following settings in the Scan Setup tab, on the left side of the drawer map (see Figure 1 B):Tray Type: MicroplatesVessel Type: 6-well CorningScan Type: Phase ContrastScan Pattern: Select the appropriate scan pattern or create one clicking on “Edit Scan Patterns” on the bottom left of the window (see Figure 1 C). Select 16 images/well for each 6-well.Note: The IncuCyte can take up to 121 images per well in a 6-well plate format. However, by choosing this option, we would have increased the time of imaging considerably, therefore leading to time points spaced by at least two hours instead of the 15 min needed to capture the morphological changes occurring during the BL-CFC culture.  With the vessel selected, go to the Properties tab (see Figure 1 D) and fill the following fields (see Figure 2 A):Label: Name of your experiment/vessel typeCell type: Exact name of the cell line/cell type usedPassage: Number of passagesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190101/20190101201034_8126.jpgFigure 1. IncuCyte setup Click on “Plate Map” (see Figure 2 B) and in the new window set up the plate map of your experiment (see Figure 3):Add a new compound and name it “+dox” (see Figure 3 A).Select the +dox compound, the wells that you treated with doxycycline and click on “Add +dox” (see Figure 4 A).Select the concentration and click on OK.Click on OK.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190101/20190101201057_8780.jpgFigure 2.

    "Right-click on the upper timeline (see Figure 2) and click on “Set intervals”.Set intervals every 15 min starting from time 0, for a total of 24 h.Note: Even with a total of 24 h, the Incucyte device will scan your vessels every 15 min until you manually remove your vessels from the software. Check the grey bars to make sure they are not overlapping (see Figure 5 A), check that IncuCyte device is not scanning (see Figure 5 B) and click on “Apply” (see Figure 5 C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190101/20190101201151_2280.jpgFigure 5. Set IntervalsNote: When the plate is put in the incubator, the difference of temperature between the room and the incubator generates water condensation on the lid (as an example, see Figure 6 A). Wait at least 30 min before initiating the imaging so that the microscope can focus properly on the cells. Come back after 15 min to check that everything is working and switch off the computer if you wish.Day 3After 48-h treatment, click on “Schedule Upcoming Scans” in the Task List panel of the IncuCyte software.Right-click on the upper timeline and select “Delete Intervals”.Click on “Apply” to stop the scanning by IncuCyte.Take out your plates and proceed with flow cytometry analysis according to standard protocols."
