    "1. Heated fixture preparation\nGather 2 pieces of 1 mm thick insulative rubber trimmed to 25 mm x 40 mm in width and length, respectively, 2 pieces of a 6 mm-thick rubber that are also 25 mm x 40 mm, a prepared aluminum base fixture assembly, and an acrylic oil reservoir that fits in the viewing window of the aluminum base fixture (see Figures S1, S2, and S3 for details on fabrication and an exploded view of assembly). Prepare the aluminum fixture first by attaching to the bottom of the fixture a glass coverslip viewing window with UV curable adhesive and adhering 1 resistive heating element to the top of each 25 mm x 25 mm side flange of the fixture.\nPlace the thinner rubber pieces onto the stage of the microscope such that the long edge of each piece is tangential to the stage opening as shown in (Figure 1).\nPosition the aluminum-base fixture on top of the insulative pads with the viewing window of the fixture centered above the objective lens. Proper alignment is required for imaging the connected droplets.\nPlace a thicker piece of rubber on top of each resistive heating element and use a microscope stage clip to hold it in place. These pieces protect the heating elements from damage caused by the stage clips and insulate against accidental electrical shorting between the heating elements and both the aluminum fixture and the microscope stage.\nCarefully bend the measurement-end of a thermocouple to achieve a 90° angle at ~4 mm from the end.\nInsert the bent tip of the thermocouple into the lower left corner of the aluminum fixture and gently secure it with the locking screw.",
    "Place the acrylic reservoir into the well of the aluminum fixture. This is done prior to adding hexadecane oil to the well (step 1.8) of the aluminum fixture to minimize the risk of trapping air bubbles between the viewing window and the bottom of the acrylic reservoir, which can obstruct the view of the droplets.\n\tNOTE: Oil added to the viewing compartment of the aluminum fixture is used to match the refractive indices of the acrylic and glass for clearer imaging of the droplets contained within the acrylic reservoir. Thus, it is worth noting that oil in the well of the aluminum fixture does not contact the contents of the acrylic reservoir and rigorous cleaning of the aluminum fixture is not required.\nDispense ~1,000 µL of hexadecane oil into the well of aluminum fixture (i.e., between the walls of the acrylic reservoir and aluminum fixture), taking care to not overfill. The oil level in the well of the aluminum fixture should be as high as allowable to maximize surface area for heat transfer, while not allowing oil to spill over the edges of the fixture onto the microscope stage or objective lens.\nDispense ~1,000 µL of hexadecane oil into the acrylic reservoir, while remaining mindful to not overfill.\n\t​NOTE: The acrylic reservoir should always be thoroughly cleaned between experiments. The user must employ a regiment consisting of successive rinses with ethyl-alcohol and deionized water followed by drying in a desiccator bowl for over 12 h.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62362/62362fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Heated stage assembly.

    "2. Instrumentation for simultaneous feedback temperature control and electrical characterization of a DIB\nNOTE: This protocol integrates the following instruments for enabling feedback temperature control and simultaneous electrical characterization of a DIB: a personal computer (PC) with two available universal serial bus (USB) connections, a patch clamp amplifier paired to a dedicated data acquisition (DAQ-1) system, a waveform generator, a second programable DAQ (DAQ-2) with voltage output and temperature input modules, and a power supply/amplifier. The following steps describe the necessary connections of these instruments (as illustrated in Figure 2a) needed for isolating the measurement and control of temperature from simultaneous electrophysiology of a DIB. Substitutions for equivalent instruments may be made as required.\nEstablish output and input connections to the DAQ-2 modules.\n\t\nSelect two pairs of screw terminals on the voltage output module for differential voltage connections and attach wire leads to these locations. Odd number terminals are common ground connections, and the even number terminals are ungrounded outputs, as shown in (Figure 2c). Connect each of these two pairs of lead wires to separate screw-terminal-BNC adapters and then connect each adapter to a separate BNC cable used to route voltage signals to other instruments.\n\t\tNOTE: In this setup, differential connections at terminals 0 and 1 are assigned for the temperature control output to the power amplifier, while another pair of connections at terminals 6 and 7 are designated for voltage output to be sent to the droplets via the patch clamp amplifier.\nReferring to (Figure 2c), select one set of thermocouple terminals (e.g., terminals 2 and 3 are designated as the TC1 pair) on the thermocouple input module and connect to it the thermocouple wires.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62362/62362fig2v2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: System wiring connections. A schematic of the devices and wiring required for the system is shown in (a), while a detailed look at the DAQ-2 connections is provided in (b). The illustration in (c) shows aqueous droplets on hydrogel-coated electrodes submerged in oil for DIB formation. The two electrodes are connected to the grounded and ungrounded (V+) connections, respectively, on the headstage unit of the patch clamp amplifier. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62362/62362fig2v2large.jpg]\nAfter electrical connections to the DAQ-2 modules have been made, connect the DAQ-2 chassis to a PC via a USB connection and connect to an electrical power source. Then confirm successful driver and software installation prior to use with a commercial software.\nConfigure and connect a power amplifier between DAQ-2 and resistive heating elements.\n\t\nConfigure the amplifier to operate in fixed-gain amplification mode with a gain of 10X.\nUsing a banana jack-BNC adapter, connect the BNC cable originating from terminals 0 and 1 on the voltage output module (Figure 2b) to the input connections on the power amplifier.\nUsing additional BNC adapters and cabling, connect the output terminals of the power amplifier to both sets of heating elements, which are wired in parallel to one another and the amplifier to ensure that both elements maintain the same voltage drop during use.\nEstablish necessary connections for the electrophysiology equipment.\n\t\nConnect a BNC cable originating from terminals 6 and 7 on the voltage output module (Figure 2b) to the Rear Switched External Command BNC connectors on the rear of the patch clamp amplifier.\nConnect a second BNC cable between the output of waveform generator and the Front Switch External Command connection on the rear of the patch clamp amplifier.",
    "NOTE: These two connections provide alternative methods for generating voltage waveforms that are applied to the droplet electrodes via the patch clamp amplifier. The waveform generator is especially useful for generating triangular waveform voltages used to measure membrane capacitance. The user may decide which, if either, are necessary for their own application.\nWith a third BNC cable, connect the output of the measured current located on the front panel of the patch clamp amplifier to an available analog input BNC connector on the front of DAQ-1.\nWith a fourth BNC cable, connect the output of measured membrane voltage (on the rear of the patch clamp amplifier) to a separate analog input connector on DAQ-1. This enables digitization of the voltage applied across the electrodes.\nWith the two droplet electrodes prepared and supported on micromanipulators as described in Steps 7-9 in ref.40, connect the electrode leads to the patch clamp headstage, which is the attached via cable to the patch clamp amplifier.\n\t\tNOTE: The role of the headstage is to control the voltage between the electrodes and measure the resulting current, which is converted into a proportional voltage that gets output by the patch clamp amplifier to DAQ-1.\nConnect DAQ-1 to a PC via a USB connection and connect the corresponding power supply cables to both the patch clamp amplifier and DAQ-1.\nPower on all measurement equipment.\n\t​NOTE: Perhaps the most important detail in this setup is to ensure the power amplifier output (mA-A) connections are electrically isolated from the headstage unit of the patch clamp amplifier, which uses a sensitive circuit to measure pA-nA level currents in a DIB.\n3. Feedback temperature control of droplet interface bilayers",
    "NOTE: The following steps for operating the feedback temperature control system are based on a custom graphical user interface (GUI) created for implementing proportional-integral (PI) feedback temperature control40,41 (see Supplementary Coding Files). Other software and control algorithms may be used instead. A copy of this program is provided to the reader with the supplementary information for the paper, however the user is responsible to configure it for their own equipment and needs.\nStart the DAQ-2 software on the PC and open the temperature control program file. Once the GUI opens, open the program again by clicking on the folder icon in the bottom left corner of the GUI and selecting the temperature control program (Figure 3).\nEnter appropriate numerical values for the proportional control gain (KP) and integral control gain (KI).\n\tNOTE: KP and KI values of 0.598 and 0.00445, respectively, were found to work well in the setup. These values were determined iteratively through simulation using a system model that incorporates parameters obtained from measured open-loop heating responses (see Figure 4). During open-loop heating, the prescribed heating power is independent of the measured temperature. In contrast, closed-loop heating consists of continually adjusting the applied power to the heaters in a manner that helps drive the measured temperature closer to the desired temperature. This is achieved herein using a PI control scheme.",
    "To test the temperature control scheme, enter a desired set point temperature (above room temperature) and then turn on feedback temperature control within the GUI. Observe the measured temperature signal under feedback (closed-loop) control, which is displayed in the GUI for the next few minutes. If the measured temperature of the oil greatly overshoots the desired temperature, reacts too slowly to changes, or fails to converge to the desired set point, the user will need to adjust the control gains to achieve desired closed loop performance.\n\tNOTE: The program defines a saturation limit for the power (and thus voltage) supplied to the resistive heating elements. For example, two elements reported herein consume up to 5 W power each. Wiring them in parallel means that total power consumption should not exceed 10 W. The user is advised to consider the maximum amount of power that should be supplied to the devices and know that this limit can affect the speed at which the closed-loop system will respond to desired temperature changes. Higher power heating elements enable faster heating and higher set point temperatures but require higher supplied currents for heating.\nWith the system tuned to acceptable closed-loop performance, enter the desired oil temperature for DIB formation as the set point in the GUI.",
    "NOTE: For example, a set point temperature of 60 °C yielded good results in experiments with BTLE liposomes in the aqueous droplets37. The user is referred elsewhere2,40 for protocols explaining DIB assembly between droplets hanging on wire-type electrodes and configuration of electrophysiology equipment using the patch clamp amplifier, DAQ-1, and electrophysiology measurement software. Specifically, the protocol by Najem, et al.40 can be closely followed until Step 13. Beyond that step, a slightly different approach is employed for successful monolayer and bilayer formation when using lipids that require heating to promote monolayer or bilayer formation.\nLower the tips of the silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes into the oil until they nearly touch the bottom of the acrylic reservoir. This positioning of the electrode tips is crucial for keeping the droplet on the electrode in heated oil, where convective currents in the oil have been observed to detach droplets from the hydrogel-coated electrodes (Figure 2c).\nPipette a 250 nL droplet of aqueous lipid solution containing 2 mg/mL of BTLE, 100 mM potassium chloride (KCl), and 10 mM 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) onto each electrode tip and let them incubate in the heated oil for a minimum of 10 minutes to promote monolayer formation.\nCover the headstage and heated stage fixture with a grounded Faraday cage.\nBring the droplets into gentle contact by slowly",
    "manipulating the horizontal positions of the electrodes until the user sees the droplets deform from contact or begin to displace one another and wait a few minutes until bilayer formation commences. If after several minutes a bilayer has not formed, the droplets can be coerced together more to facilitate bilayer formation. The formation of a thinned interfacial bilayer can be confirmed through visual inspection (Figure 5a) or by measuring the increase in the amplitude of a square-waveform capacitive current induced by a waveform generator outputting a 10 mV, 10 Hz triangular voltage22. Allow the bilayer to equilibrate for a minimum of 10 minutes to reach a steady interfacial area, upon initial formation and prior to subsequent characterization at the initial set point.\n\t​NOTE: The type of oil can have a significant impact on bilayer thinning, membrane thickness, and inter-droplet contact angle. In general, the smaller the oil molecule the more easily it can remain in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer occupied by lipid acyl chains. Oil retention increases both monolayer and bilayer tensions and thickness and decreases the area and angle of contact between droplets. These metrics signify a weaker state of adhesion. Larger, bulkier molecules exert the opposite effect. For example, squalene is a bulkier molecule than alkanes such as hexadecane, which enables it to be readily excluded from between monolayers during bilayer thinning. As such, DIBs formed in squalene are thinner, they display higher contact areas and angles, and they exhibit higher free energies of formation22,42 (a measure of droplet-droplet adhesion).\n4. Characterization of temperature-dependent behaviors in DIBs\nNOTE: Many physical processes can be studied in DIB-based model membranes, including how changes in temperature affect the structure and transport properties of the membrane. The following steps should be performed after successful bilayer formation at a desired temperature.",
    "Measure the nominal capacitance of the membrane while lowering the temperature of the oil bath from a set point that permits bilayer formation to identify thermotropic phase transitions of the lipids in the membrane38.\n\t\nRight click the temperature graph on the GUI and clear the displayed data. This ensures sufficient space in the buffer is available for subsequent recordings.\nUsing the waveform generator connected to the patch clamp amplifier, apply a triangular voltage waveform (e.g., 10 mV, 10 Hz) across the DIB electrodes and record the induced current response through the bilayer.\nCool the bilayer by reducing the set point temperature in 5 °C increments and waiting a minimum of 5 min at the new steady state temperature between temperature changes until the desired temperature is achieved. Alternatively, try passively cooling the bilayer by turning off the feedback control system. Be aware, however, that experiments implementing passive cooling from 50-60 °C resulted in higher rates of  coalescence.\nAfter the oil bath and bilayer cool to the desired minimum temperature, right click the temperature graph in the GUI again and export the temperature data versus time to a spreadsheet software. Stop the current recording.\nFrom the measured current, calculate the nominal capacitance of the square wave-current response versus time during the cooling period.\nPlot nominal capacitance (C) versus temperature (T) to observe how membrane capacitance changed. Locate nonmonotonic changes in C versus T to identify TM.\n\t\tNOTE: Nominal capacitance can be calculated from the amplitude of square-wave current43 (|I|) using the relationship |I| = C dv/dt, where dv/dt is equal to four times the product of the voltage amplitude (|V|) and frequency (f) of the applied triangular voltage. From these equations, C = |I|/(4|V|f).",
    "Similarly, assess the quasi-static specific capacitance (Cm) of the bilayer at fixed temperatures by successively incrementing the temperature of the oil bath and the bilayer area.\n\t\nChange the set point temperature in 10 °C increments using the GUI and allow the system to equilibrate to the new temperature.\n\t\t\nPerform Step 4.1.2 to initiate the measurement of capacitive current and recording.\nChange the bilayer area by carefully adjusting the positions of the electrodes using the micro-manipulators (i.e., separating the electrodes reduces bilayer area). Allow for the square-wave current to reach a steady state amplitude and collect images of the DIB to enable calculation of membrane area versus time by using a camera mounted to the microscope to image the bilayer as seen from the aperture of the microscope stage. Simultaneously, add a digital tag in the current recording software to mark the corresponding timepoint for image collection.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Micro-manipulators allow for the precise control of the electrodes and thus gentle contact between droplets. Coarse manipulation of the droplets can lead to a failed experiment by coalescence of the droplets or by causing a droplet to fall off the electrode. As discussed elsewhere22, bilayer area is calculated from the contact length between droplets, which appear as overlapping circles in a bottom-view image. The positions and dimensions of the droplets, and the length of the contact line, can be calculated using an image-processing software or with other scientific programming tools.\nRepeat Step 4.2.1.2 a minimum of 4 times to obtain a total of 5 DIB images and steady-state regions of bilayer current.\nRepeat Step 4.2.1 at each desired temperature.\nAt the tagged timepoints corresponding to steady-state bilayer areas for acquired images, analyze the current recordings and DIB images to extract C and A data for each temperature.",
    "Plot C versus A data for each temperature and compute the slope of a first-order regression, which represents the Cm of the bilayer at each temperature22.\nPlot values of Cm obtained from Step 4.2.4 versus T.\nExamine the Cm versus T data for non-monotonic variations to identify melting temperatures, TM.\nAssess the dynamics of voltage-dependent ion channel formation by generating a dc voltage step input across the bilayer.\n\t\nSet Initial Voltage to the desired step value in mV (e.g.,100 mV).\nSet Final Voltage and Step Size to a value higher than the desired step (e.g., 110 mV final voltage and 110 mV step size).\nSet a desired duration time for the step input in seconds (e.g., 90 s).\nChoose the desired polarity for the step input (e.g., positive).\nSwitch the patch clamp amplifier to send to the headstage the command voltage originating from the GUI/voltage output module.\nInitiate current recordings.\nTurn on the voltage and record the induced current response, which should exhibit an S -shaped response to a critical voltage (e.g., ~70 mV for 1 µg/mL Mz in 2 mg/mL BTLE).\nSeparately, dynamic current-voltage relationships for a membrane can be obtained at desired temperatures to reveal voltage-dependent relationships, such as ion channel behaviors.\n\t\nSwitch the patch clamp amplifier to send to the headstage the command voltage originating from the waveform generator and initiate current recordings.\nOn the waveform generator, output a continuous sinusoidal waveform with a desired amplitude, offset, and frequency.\nRecord the induced current response across one or multiple cycles.\nRepeat as desired for different sine wave amplitudes and frequencies and temperatures.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62362/62362fig03.jpg",
