    "All experiments were completed in accordance and compliance with all relevant regulatory and institutional guidelines, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n1. Animals\nObtain male adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats at 4 weeks of age. House the animals in polycarbonate rat cages in a temperature-and humidity-controlled room on a 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle with light onset at 0600 h. Provide the animals with ad libitum access to water.\nAllow rats to acclimate for 1 week to reduce stress associated with transportation. Pair-house the animals (N=16) to preclude isolation stress, and at 5 weeks of age, begin the chronic variable stress (CVS) regimen for 3 weeks.\n2. Chronic Variable Stress\nAdminister the CVS regimen once in the morning (9-11 AM) and once in the afternoon (1–3 PM) at irregular times to keep the routine unpredictable. Incorporate overnight mild stressors. The CVS regimen includes: 1) 3 h in a restraint cylinder; 2) 10 min swim; 3) 3 h cage tilt 4) 1 h slow shaking platform; and 5) 1 h in the 4 °C cold room.\n\tNote: Overnight stressors include social crowding (5 per cage), social isolation, wet bedding, food restriction, and lights-on. A typical weekly schedule of the stress regimen is provided in Table 1.\n3. Endocrine Assays\nDetermine levels of corticosterone (CORT) using tail blood (~50 μL) samplings collected at the same time (9 AM) twice per week throughout the experiment, prior to CVS regimen to establish baseline hormone levels (Day 0), once during the middle of the weekly CVS (Days 4,11, and 18), after every 7 days of CVS (Days 7 and 14), and at the conclusion of CVS (Day 21). Collect blood samples prior to the daily stress regimen.",
    "Collect one final trunk blood sample during euthanasia (Day 25) for RIA and genomic DNA extraction.\nCentrifuge all blood samples (600 x g, 4 °C, 10 min) to separate the plasma from the blood cells. Pipet out the plasma (supernatant) and store the samples at -80 °C.\nThaw and use the plasma to determine CORT levels by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Ensure that the 3 week plasma CORT levels are elevated in the stressed animals to verify the robustness of the stress regimen.\n4. Behavior\nAfter the CVS regimen (Days 23–24), assess each animal for anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze (EPM)14.\nUsing a video camera, record the animals on the EPM apparatus for 300 s and score the time spent in the center, closed arms, and open arms.\n5. Design of the Rat Methyl-Seq\nUsing the UCSC Genome Browser, obtain non-redundant genomic coordinates (rat Nov 2004 rn4 assembly) for CpG islands and island shores (± 1 kb flanking CpG islands), promoters (± 1 kb of each TSS) of each RefSeq gene, and other sequences that may be available from relevant literature.\n\tNote: For the rat Methyl-Seq, ­­additional GC-rich sequences from a previous array-based methylation platform was added12. For regions greater than 5 kbps, alternating regions of 500 bps were sampled followed by 1 kbps that were skipped. The final rat Methyl-Seq design consists of 111 Mbps, 2.3 million CpGs; and an average region size of 594 bps. It targets 228,800 unique loci.\nEnter a compiled list of genomic coordinates into a commercially-available target capture design software for appropriate probe design.\n6. Construction of the Rat Methyl-Seq Library from Genomic DNA",
    "NOTE: To eliminate batch effects, process multiple samples at the same time, and scale up the master mixes accordingly. Extract DNA using a commercially available DNA extraction kit. Column- or precipitation-based methods both yield high-quality genomic DNA (260/280 ratio ~1.8). Use of phenol-based methods are not recommended. Elute or resuspend DNA in Low TE buffer (10 mM TE, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).\nSample Preparation\n\tNOTE: For every step using DNA-binding magnetic beads, make sure the beads are acclimated to room temperature for at least 30 min and well mixed before use.\n\t\nShear DNA\n\t\t\nUse a fluorometer to determine initial double-stranded DNA concentration of each sample. Dilute >1 µg of gDNA to 50 µL with Low TE buffer (10 mM TE, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) in low DNA-binding microcentrifuge tubes.\nShear samples using an isothermal sonicator (10% Duty Cycle, 5 Intensity, 200 Cycles per Burst, 6 cycles of 60 s, Frequency sweeping, 4 °C).\nAssess quality of DNA using an electrophoresis-based system that measures DNA size and quantity.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The DNA amount recommended is 1 µg, or 3 µg.

Assess quality using a bioanalyzer.\n\t\t\tNote: If the total amount of DNA is less than 500 ng, shear and process additional DNA prior to proceeding with the subsequent steps. If the average DNA size does not increase by more than 30 bps, check to ensure that the reagents are new, as T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow, and/or T4 ligase may be old.\n\t\t\tStopping Point: After ligating methylated adapter, samples may be sealed and stored at -20 °C.\nHybridization\nTransfer samples to low DNA-binding microcentrifuge tubes and use a heated vacuum concentrator to reduce sample volume to less than 3.4 µL.
