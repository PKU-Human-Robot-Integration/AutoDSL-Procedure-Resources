    "The experimental procedures using laboratory animals were approved by the Experimental Animal Welfare Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University. New Zealand rabbits aged 10 months (of both sexes; body weight, 3.18 ± 0.24 kg) were used for this study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Animal preparation\nAnesthetize the rabbits using a mixed intravenous injection of tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam hydrochloride (3 mg/kg) into the marginal ear vein and an intramuscular injection of sumianxin II (0.02 mL/kg) (see Table of Materials) into the hindlimb muscle.\n\tNOTE: After about 1-3 min, the anesthetic effect stabilizes. Before proceeding, the level of anesthesia should be checked by pinching the skin behind the neck and observing the corneal reflex. Tiletamine hydrochloride, zolazepam hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg), and sumianxin II (0.01 mL/kg) could be added during the operation if needed.\nLay the rabbit on a fixed table (see Table of Materials) in a supine position, and tie the limbs and incisors with binds.\nShave the neck and upper chest using an electric razor, and remove the hair by animal depilatory cream (see Table of Materials).\nMaintain sterile conditions during the surgery by autoclaving the surgical equipment and cleaning the surgery area with povidone-iodine solution.\n2. Skin incision\nPosition the rabbit with its head toward the surgeon.\nMake a longitudinal incision of ~3 cm between the mandible and the sternoclavicular joint using surgical scissors or a scalpel blade.\n3. Preparation of the external jugular vein (EJV)\nExpose the incision, and identify the right EJV. Ensure that the EJV and its perivascular tissues are clearly visible and not dissected.\n\tNOTE: The EJV shows an inverted \"Y\" pattern, and the branch close to the medial neck needs to be anastomosed.",
    "Make a tunnel that a vascular clamp can be passed through (see Table of Materials) along the direction perpendicular to the EJV. Ensure that the distances between the openings on both sides of the tunnel and the EJV are >1 cm.\nPlace a vascular clamp along the tunnel.\nMake another tunnel (same as in step 3.2) at the distal EJV using the same method.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the distance between the two tunnels is ≥2 cm.\nApply a 4-0 suture (see Table of Materials) and a vascular clamp along the tunnel to control the blood flow (Figure 1A).\n4. Dissecting and preparing the common carotid artery (CCA)\nUse forceps (see Table of Materials) to explore the CCA lateral to the trachea and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n\tNOTE: The CCA has a pulsatile sensation and runs parallel to the cervical nerve.\nBluntly dissect the CCA to a length of about 2 cm.\n\tNOTE: Avoid injury to the vagus nerve and its branches with a deep arterial course.\nPlace a 4-0 suture thread around the CCA to control the blood flow when needed.\nApply vascular clamps (see Table of Materials) as distally and proximally as possible (Figure 1B).\n5. Preparing the anastomosis\nFor phlebotomy and anastomosis, use microscissors (see Table of Materials) to dissect the internal part of the EJV (4 mm long) free from the surrounding tissues.\nMake a 4 mm long longitudinal incision with microscissors in the middle of the vein. Rinse the vein with heparin solution (100 IU/mL) to prevent thrombosis.\nMake a longitudinal incision measuring approximately 4 mm in the anterior wall of the artery using a sharp blade and microscissors. Rinse the artery with 100 IU/mL heparin solution until the vessel is clear of blood.\n6. Side-to-side anastomosis",
    "Pull the EJV and CCA closely together, as close as possible.\nApply Kunlin's technique12 for the side-to-side anastomosis of the CCA and EJV using 8-0 nonabsorbable sutures (see Table of Materials). Suture the posterior wall of the vessel first (Figure 1C), followed by the anterior wall of the vessel.\n\tNOTE: Since the EJV wall in a rabbit is thin, care should be taken during the surgery to prevent damage to the vessels that could later compromise the patency of the anastomosis. During the process of vascular anastomosis, heparin solution (100 IU/mL) must be used repeatedly to rinse the lumen to prevent thrombosis.\n7. Vascular clamp removal and ligation of the vein\nRemove the distal vascular clamp of the CCA, the proximal vascular clamp of the EJV, and the proximal vascular clamp of the CCA in turn. Observe active blood flow through the anastomosis.\nLigate the distal end of the EJV using the 4-0 suture that was placed earlier. Remove the distal vascular clamp of the EJV.\nRemove the suture thread that was placed around the CCA (Figure 1D).\n8. Skin closure and postoperative care\nAfter ensuring no significant bleeding in the surgical field, close the skin of the neck using interrupted sutures (4-0).\nPlace the rabbit in a cage until it completely recovers. Typically, this takes 30-45 min.\n\tNOTE: In case of incomplete or delayed recovery, care should be taken to ensure that the rabbit does not experience hemodynamic shock due to bleeding in the surgical area. If required, administer Sumianxin II (0.01 mL/kg) post-surgery.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
