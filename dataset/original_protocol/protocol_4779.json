    "Cell cultureMouse stable fibroblast cell lines were derived from MEF cultures from E14.5 TTP KO and littermate WT embryos, as described previously (Lai WS et al., 2006). These stable cell lines have been cultured for more than 200 passages and are well matched in terms of growth rates, morphology, and responses of rapidly inducible genes, such as Fos, to serum stimulation. The two stable fibroblast cell lines are maintained in complete medium in T-75 flasks, and passaged every 2-3 days after achieving approximate 70-80% confluence and trypsin treatment. Note: Cell culture, stimulation and actinomycin D treatment are performed in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet.  Serum starvation and stimulationTo plate the cells for experiments, cells are harvested from 3-5 T-75 flasks after washing with 10 ml of PBS followed by trypsinization with 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA and neutralization with 8 ml of complete medium per one T-75 flask, and plated into 60-mm Petri dishes at a density of 2-3 x 105 cells in 5 ml culture medium per Petri dish. Note: The estimated cell counts harvested from each T-75 flask range between 8 x 105 and 3 x 106 for both the 66 KO and 67 WT stable cell lines, with an average yield of approximate 1.4 x 106 cells.When the cells reach 70-80% confluence, the cells are washed in serum-free DMEM and then cultured in 5 ml serum-starving medium for at least 16 h of serum starvation. Add recombinant murine TNF (or other stimuli) into serum-starving medium for a final TNF concentration of 10 ng/ml, and then harvest cells at various time points after treatment.Actinomycin D treatmentActinomycin D solution is prepared by dissolving the powder in DEPC water. The solution is stored at 4 °C in the dark for a final concentration of 2-5 mg/ml.",
    "Note: It often takes at least 1-2 days for the actinomycin D to get fully dissolved in water at 4 °C; gently invert the bottle several times to mix the solution prior to use. DMSO is not used as a solvent in this protocol.After 30 min or other times of TNF treatment of fibroblast cells (10 ng/ml in this example), or treatment with other stimuli, actinomycin D is added directly to the serum-starving medium for a final concentration of 5-10 μg/ml; TNF and other stimuli are not removed at the time of actinomycin D addition. Note: We routinely perform a time course study first for an individual stimulus to determine the kinetic expression pattern of the gene of interest. The time point at which cells express the highest levels of the transcript of interest is then usually chosen as the time for actinomycin D addition. Cells are then harvested at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the addition of actinomycin D, or other times as indicated; each sample is comprised of pooled cells from three 60-mm dishes.Note: It is not recommended to use trypsin/EDTA for cell harvest followed by RNA extraction. It is necessary to proceed immediately to Procedure D by adding sample lysis buffer directly into the Petri dishes after one rinse with ice-cold PBS. RNA extraction, reverse transcription and semi-quantitative real-time PCRTo prepare cells for RNA extraction, the culture medium is aspirated and the cells are washed once in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS per one 60-mm dish. RA1 lysis buffer (from the Illustra RNAspin MiniRNA isolation kit) supplemented with freshly added mercaptoethanol (ME, 1:100 dilution) is added directly into the Petri dishes, and the lysates are then scraped off using cell scrapers.",
    "The lysates are then pooled from triplicate plates and transferred into a new fresh 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube. This procedure can be performed on the bench at room temperature. Note: For cells in suspension other than adherent cells such as fibroblasts, samples are harvested first by centrifugation, and then washed once in PBS before adding RA1 lysis buffer with ME.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions in the GE Healthcare illustra RNAspin MiniRNA isolation kit for total RNA extraction; this includes steps of lysate vortexing, filtering through the shredder column to decrease the viscosity of lysates, and on-column digestion with RNase-free DNase I. Lysates that have flowed through the shredder column can be transferred into a new tube and stored at -80 °C.Take 1 μl of RNA from each sample to check for RNA quantity and quality with Nanodrop.Note: The expected RNA yield from three combined dishes in this protocol is around 16 µg. 750 ng RNA is used to synthesize first-strand cDNAs using oligo (dT)12-18 primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s protocol.cDNA is then diluted to 1.5-2 ng/µl with DEPC water, and is ready for use or can be stored at -20 °C.Real-time PCR is performed using SYBR Green master mix and the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System in a 384-well plate. Each reaction is comprised of 1x SYBR Green master mix, 1-2 ng cDNA, 250 nM of each primer in a total of 10 μl reaction volume, i.e., 5 µl of 2x SYBR Green master mix, 0.5 µl of each forward and reverse primer at 5 µM, 1 µl of cDNA, and 3 µl of DEPC water per reaction. Each plate contains “no template” controls for individual transcripts as well as housekeeping transcripts such as Actb mRNA for every sample as an internal control.",
    "Results are analyzed using the ΔΔCt method (Pfaffl MW 2001). Ct values from duplicate or triplicate samples are first normalized to their respective internal housekeeping transcripts, Actb mRNA in this example, and then normalized to their respective samples before the addition of actinomycin D, which are set at 1. The results are expressed as percentages of mRNA abundance relative to time 0. A representative experiment is shown in Table 1.Note: It is critical to validate primer amplification efficiency and specificity prior to use. To check primer amplification efficiency, a 10-fold serial dilution of cDNA across 4-5 log range is used. The relative Ct values after normalization to an internal housekeeping transcript are plotted against the concentrations at log values for linear regression curves. Any absolute values of slopes less than or equal to 0.1 are considered to pass the efficiency test when paired with the housekeeping gene in the assay. A representative experiment is shown in Figure 1.Table 1. Calculation of the Relative Transcript Abundance using the ΔΔCt Methodimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160704/20160704031651_3463.jpg*∆Ct = Ct (Fos, column 2) – Ave Ct (Actb, column 4); **∆∆Ct = ∆Ct (column 5)– Ave ∆Ct at time 0 (column 6). Actinomycin D (ActD) was added after 30 min of TNF stimulation.The transcript turnover rates are then calculated based on the non-linear fit one phase exponential decay curves using GraphPad Prism software, and are generally expressed as times to 50% mRNA decay for each experiment. A representative experiment is shown in Figure 2."
