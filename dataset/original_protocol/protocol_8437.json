    "All experimental procedures were performed according to the German guidelines on animal welfare under the supervision of local ethics committees (LaGeSo). Human and bat brain data were derived from Naumann et al.5 The following procedure is performed on a male adult Wistar rat (strain: RJHan:WI).\n1. Perfusion and Brain Extraction\nNOTE: In order to obtain a homogenously fixed and blood-free brain, transcardial perfusion of the animal is highly encouraged, as residual blood increases unspecific background signal during staining. Nevertheless, it is also possible to obtain flattened sections from un-perfused specimen and stain them. The ease of handling the specimen varies with the concentration of fixative used. Too little fixation increases the risk of handling damage to the brain during flattening and cutting, while too high concentrations lower the flexibility for flattening and the quality of the staining signal.\nTranscardially perfuse the animal, using a 23G needle. For a more detailed guide, see Gage et al.9\nUse phosphate buffer saline10 (PBS; 0.02 M; pH 7.4) to flush out blood from the brain and body of the animal. Continue until infusion liquid appears clear, with at least 150 mL PBS being infused through the vascular system.\n\t\tNOTE: Best results are achieved at a pressure similar to the range of the physiological blood pressure of the animal being perfused (e.g., rat: 120-130 mmHg). Optionally, add heparin (10 U/mL) to the solution to avoid blood coagulation11.\nTo fix the brain, transcardially infuse a minimum of 100 mL paraformaldehyde12 (PFA, 4%; in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB)13) until the neck of the animal is stiff.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is a potential carcinogen.\n\t\tNOTE: Best results for histochemical activity staining, such as for cytochrome oxidase, are achieved, when using 2% PFA. For other staining, such as immunohistochemistry, 4% PFA is preferred.\nExtract the brain from the skull.",
    "NOTE: See Gage et al.9 for details.\n\t\nIsolate the head using large scissors or bone shears.\nUsing fine scissors, cut the skin along the midline from neck to nose. Pull apart the skin to expose the skull. Remove the neck and temporal muscles using fine scissors.\nMake a midline cut through the interparietal bone starting from the foramen magnum up to the parietal bone.\nUse Rongeurs to peel off the interparietal bone. Slide fine scissors along the sagittal suture and cut from the posterior end of the parietal to the anterior end of the frontal bones.\nUse Rongeurs to peel off the parietal and frontal bones. Alternatively, lift the bones away using forceps. Use a spoon to cut ventral nerve cords and remove the brain. Transfer the brain to PB (0.1 M; pH 7.4).\nFix un-perfused brains by immersion in 4% PFA for 1-3 h at 4 °C (depending on the brain size and probe: Shrew: ~ 1 h, Human: ~ 3 h).\n\tNOTE: For large and gyrencephalic brains like humans, isolate and cut out the area of interest to reduce fixation time.\nTo obtain larger cortical areas in a section, flatten the brain prior to further post-fixation; proceed to step 2. However, to obtain sections of harder to reach areas like the medial entorhinal cortex, post-fix the brain in 4% PFA for 24 h before proceeding to step 2.\n2. Brain Dissection and Flattening\nSeparate the brain hemispheres by using a razor blade (lissencephalic brains) or scalpel (gyrencephalic brains).\n\tNOTE: If the brain has not been post-fixed, it is susceptible to damage by handling.\nOptional step for aiding subsequent section registration and shrinkage estimation:",
    "Puncture the cortex in an area of non-interest, with a 35G needle normal to the cortical surface. Repeat the step two times at defined distances along the cortical sheet. To determine the distance along the cortical sheet, use a pre-cut thread at a fixed length (e.g., 5 mm) and lay it along the cortical surface to determine points of puncture.\nLissencephalic brains: Remove subcortical structures by using a dissecting spatula. Critical: Keep the brain moist with PB (0.1 M; pH 7.4) throughout the whole procedure.\n\t\nHold the brain by the cerebellum and gently insert the spatula to open a dissection plane in the corpus callosum. The round tip of spatula should point away from the cortex.\nSlide the spatula further and pull gently until the spatula is between the thalamus and cortex. Separate subcortical structures with scratching motions.\nInspect the hemisphere for even thickness.\n\t\tNOTE: Any uneven regions might result in a trans-layer gradient during sectioning. For tangential sectioning, use a scalpel to make a clean cut through the brain, parallel to the pial surface of the region from which tangential sections are desired.\nOptional steps to improve flattening quality:\n\t\t\nMake a clean cut through the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and orbitofrontal cortex, since they increase the thickness of the cortex in the lateral region. Also, add a relieving cut at the base of the inner region of prefrontal cortex, which allows unfolding of medial portions of the cortex.\nPlace the hemisphere (cortex facing down) on a glass slide. Proceed to step 2.6.\nGyrencephalic brains: Remove white matter to unfold gyri (for detailed protocols, see: Sincich et al.14; Tootell and Silverman15). Critical: Use PB (0.1 M; pH 7.4) to keep the brain moist at all time.",
    "Put the area of interest on a damp filter paper in a large Petri dish, with the cortex facing up.\nRemove the arachnoid membrane and pia using two forceps.\nUse a damp cotton swab and insert gently in each sulcus to detach adhesions between gyri.\nTurn the brain around by using another damp filter paper.\nUse two curved micro spatulas to unfold single gyri. Use the convex side of the spatulas to tease apart the white matter until reaching close to the concave end of the gyrus. Use a damp cotton swab and proceed with swirling motions to reach the concave end of the gyrus.\nTease apart single gyri. If necessary, add small relieving cuts if the tension is too high.\nFlatten the unfolded brain in the Petri dish or a similar container.\nOptionally, place larger brains on a filter paper covered sponge, to ensure that regions do not dry out.\nPlace two rolled pieces of clay on both sides. Critical: As the thickness of the clay defines how much the hemisphere can be flattened, ensure that the clay is 10-20% thinner than the un-flattened cortex.\nGently press a second glass slide/small Petri dish on the cortex until the hemisphere is fully flat. To obtain the best results for a desired region, place the glass slide first on the respective area. To obtain the best results for lissencephalic brains, place the glass slide tangentially at the lateral portion first and apply concentrated pressure on this region.\nPut a weight (e.g., a ceramic watch glass) on the glass slides/Petri dish and flatten the hemisphere for 3-5 h at 4 °C in PB.\nFor post-fixation, release the pressure and remove the glass slides. Put the flattened hemisphere in PFA (free floating) for 24 h on a shaker at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Best results for histochemical activity stainings are achieved when using 1% PFA. For other stainings, such as immunohistochemistry, for un-perfused brains, 2% PFA can be used.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56992/56992fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of workflow for flattening of a rat cortical hemisphere and visualization of modules in somatosensory cortex. Subsequent to the transcardial perfusion, the brain of a mouse was dissected (A). Subcortical structures were removed and cortex was flattened between two glass slides in phosphate buffer (B). Flattened hemisphere (C) was post-fixed, tangentially sectioned, and stained for cytochrome oxidase activity (D). Scale bars = 1 cm. R: Rostral, C: Caudal, L: Lateral, M: Medial.

Cutting Tangential Sections\nNOTE: Depending on the requirements of the staining protocols, the cutting procedure and thickness can be adapted. A vibratome was used to cut the hemispheres for further histochemical processing (step 3.2) at 80-150 µm. However, for immunohistochemical processing, thinner sections are desired and a freezing microtome was used for sectioning (step 3.3) at 10-60 µm. See Video 1.\nWash the flattened hemisphere in PB (0.1M; pH 7.4) for 15 min.\nCut the hemisphere on a vibratome.\n\t\nPlace the hemisphere tangentially on the slicing holder. Optionally, press again gently with a glass slide before fixing it in position (e.g., with superglue).\n\t\tNOTE: Minimize the amount of glue used, because cutting artifacts could result due to the small thickness of flattened hemispheres.\nCut the hemisphere from the thicker and more stable end towards the thinner end (posterior to anterior, here) at the required thickness. Proceed to step 3.4.\n\t\tNOTE: If low fixation concentrations were used, cut it at a slow speed and a high amplitude.\nCut the hemisphere on a freezing microtome.",
    "Cryoprotect the brain by immersing it in a 30% sucrose solution (in PB) until it sinks.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the size of the tissue being cryoprotected, sinking in the solution can range from a few hours to a few days. For larger brains alternative cryoprotection methods might be considered (see Rosene et al.16).\nForm an ice base on the freezing microtome to mount the brain. Construct the ice base by freezing PB on the block face of the freezing microtome. Critical: Ensure that the surface of the ice base is parallel to the microtome blade. To do this, cut the empty ice base using the microtome blade to exactly align the ice base parallel to the cutting surface.\nEmbed the brain in freezing medium and mount it to the block face of the microtome with the area of interest parallel to the block face. Face the pial surface of the brain towards the block face of the microtome. Critical: Adjust the freezing temperature depending on sample size; higher temperatures ensure better section integrity while sectioning, but larger sections require lower temperatures to freeze sample uniformly.\nCut the brain tangentially at the required thickness (slower and uniform cutting speeds result in best section quality).\nWash the sections in PB for 15 min on a shaker.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56992/56992video1.jpg",
    "Video 1: Schematic video of tangential sectioning from a rat medial entorhinal cortex and layout of parasubicular and entorhinal modules. The medial entorhinal cortex of a rodent brain is situated at the posterior end of the cortex and is tilted towards the medial and ventral side. Tangential sections are obtained by orienting a knife along this angle. Consequently, appropriate cell-type specific staining reveals modular structures in the medial entorhinal cortex and adjoining parasubiculum. Video adapted from Ray and Brecht8.

Visualization of Cortical Modules Using Cytochrome Oxidase Staining\nNOTE: Different staining protocols have been developed for histochemical detection of cytochrome oxidase activity, e.g., first by Wong-Riley17 and later modified by Divac et al.18 This protocol is based on the one by Divac et al.18, since the use of nickel-ammonium sulfate (NiAS) results in a higher contrast and better defined modules in stained cortical areas.\nPrepare the cytochrome oxidase staining solution (see Divac et al.18). For 10 mL of solution, add: 10 mL HEPES buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), 400 mg sucrose, 12.5 mg NiAS, 2 mg cytochrome C, 6 mg diaminobenzidine (DAB).\n\tCAUTION: DAB and NiAS are carcinogenic.\n\tNOTE: Add DAB just prior to incubation of sections.\nWash the sections in HEPES buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) on a shaker for 15 min.\nIncubate the sections in the staining solution at room temperature on a shaker.\n\tNOTE: Observe the speed of the staining. If there is no visible reaction, change to incubation at 37 °C. Depending on the amount of fixation, staining can be observed after 10 min or in several hours.\nStop the reaction by adding 4% PFA; this prevents unwanted re-dying and increase of background signal.\nWash the sections three times using HEPES buffer for 10 min.",
    "Mount and dry the sections on glass slides.\nDehydrate the sections with an increasing alcohol row:\n\t\nWash the slides in 60% ethanol for 1 min. Wash the slides in 80% ethanol for 1 min. Wash the slides in 96% ethanol for 2 min. Wash the slides in 100% ethanol for 3 min. Wash the slides in isopropanol for 5 min. Wash the slides in xylene for 5 min.\nImmediately add a quick hardening-mounting medium, and add a coverslip. Critical: Do not use water-based mounting mediums, as NiAS will be washed out and degrade the staining.\nKeep the sections at 4 °C for long term storage.\n5. Visualization of Cortical Modules Using Immunohistochemical Staining\nNOTE: Multiple protocols are available for immunohistochemistry, optimized for the specimen and the type of probe. Adaptations can be made as required, by varying concentrations of antibodies, permeabilizing agents, and incubation times. The following protocol leads to good results for detecting a large range of antibodies and visualization by fluorescent probes.\nWash the sections in PBS (0.1 M; pH 7.4) for 15 min.\nOptional: Perform antigen retrieval to unmask an epitope using a water bath (based on Jiao et al.19; for alternative methods, see Pileri et al.20).\n\t\nPreheat a water bath to 80 °C. Prepare tri-sodium citrate buffer19 (pH 8.0) and preheat it in the water bath to 80 °C.\nTransfer the sections to tri-sodium citrate buffer. Incubate the sections for 30 min at 80 °C\nCool the sections down to room temperature\nWash the sections in PBS for 15 min.\nWash the sections two times in PBS-X (0.5% Triton-X, in 0.1 M PBS) for 15 min.\nBlock unspecific epitopes by incubating the sections in a solution of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; 2.5%) and Triton-X (0.75%) in PBS for 2 h.",
    "Incubate the sections in primary antibody, e.g., Calbindin- D28k (1:5,000, 1% BSA in PBS-X), for 2-3 days on a shaker at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Optimal dilution for the primary antibody depends on the specific antibody used. Refer to manufacturer's information to obtain dilution criteria for a specific antibody. Multiple antibodies can be used together but must be raised against different species.\nWash the sections three times in PBS for 15 min each.\nIncubate the sections overnight in secondary antibody (1:200, 1% BSA in PBS) at 4 °C on a shaker.\n\tNOTE: Multiple secondary antibodies can be used at different spectra if multiple primary antibodies were used.\nWash off the secondary antibody by washing the sections three times in PBS for 10 min each.\nMount and dry the sections on a glass slide for microscopy.\n\tNOTE: The sections should still be moist prior to mounting the coverslip.\nApply mounting medium suited for fluorescence dyes on the tissue sections and apply a coverslip.\nDry the sections for 1 h.\nFor long term storage, seal the coverslip using nail polish and keep in the dark at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
