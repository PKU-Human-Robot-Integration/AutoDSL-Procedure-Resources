    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLive-cell CH-STED microscopy of microtubule growth events within k-fibers\nTiming: ∼ 1 h 30 per coverslip (for step 1)\nThe following assay was established to assess microtubule growth events within individual k-fibers. To do that we used Indian muntjac fibroblasts stably expressing 2×GFP-CENP-A to visualize kinetochores, and EB3-Halotag conjugated with a far-red shifted dye, JF646, to label microtubule growing ends, imaged by live CH-STED nanoscopy.\nNote: All the steps were troubleshooted and validated using an Abberior Instruments ‘Expert-line’ STED microscope. Additional optimization steps may be required if other super-resolution microscopes are used.\nSet temperature of the objective controlled heating band to 37.5°C (set-point, that corresponds to 37°C at the acquisition spot in this specific setup) 1 h before imaging;\nNote: To determine the ideal temperature set-point for a given microscope setup, perform the following steps: (1) place a temperature sensor on the imaging dish containing water or medium, just above the objective - acquisition spot; (2) leave it overnight (∼16 h); (3) in the next morning, check the temperature. If not stable at 37°C, adjust the set-point accordingly and repeat the measurement.\nSet CO2 levels to 5%, if the microscope is equipped with a source of CO2. In this case, there is no need to use a CO2-independent medium such as L15, and MEM without phenol red would be appropriate;\nIncubate cells with 3 μM MG-132 (proteasome inhibitor) to induce metaphase arrest, together with 75 nM of the Halotag® fluorescent ligand JF646 ∼30 min prior to imaging;\nAlternatives: Other Halotag fluorescent conjugates can be compatible and used for this experiment, but further optimization might be required. More information on Janelia Fluor® dyes is available at Promega’s website[href=https://ch.promega.com/products/protein-detection/protein-labeling/janelia-fluor-halotag-ligands/?catNum=GA1110].\nPlace the imaging chamber on the microscope;",
    "Co-align the excitation and STED beams at the Abberior’s Inspector software;\nNote: The 2D grating periods should be tuned every 1–2 h to warrant co-alignment of the two beams (see ‘troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’).\nScan the coverslip for metaphase cells using the eye pieces;\nNote: Cells at this stage show all kinetochores (here labeled with 2×GFP) aligned at the equatorial region, with increased inter-kinetochore distance.\nCritical: Avoid tilted mitotic spindles, in which the kinetochore pair is not in the same focal plane (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2346-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative examples of Indian muntjac tilted spindles\n(A) Small spindle tilting, but k-fibers in focus.\n(B) Moderate spindle tilting, but k-fiber of interest in focus.\n(C) Severe spindle tilting and k-fiber out of focus. Spindles resembling the representations in (A and B) can be used for imaging and subsequent analysis, but not in (C). Stills of Indian muntjac cells stably expressing EB3-Halotag conjugated with JF646 (green) and 2×GFP-CENP-A (magenta) (A', B′ and C′); and GFP-α-tubulin (green) and mScarlet-CENP-A (magenta) (A″, B″ and C″), depict each spindle type. Scale bars 5 μm.\nAcquire a confocal image of the full spindle as a pre-recording example of spindle length (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) to monitor phototoxicity and photobleaching;\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2346-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Indian muntjac fibroblasts stably expressing EB3-Halotag conjugated with JF646 (green) and 2×GFP-CENP-A (magenta) were used to track microtubule polymerization events within one k-fiber by live CH-STED nanoscopy (time lapse, 750 ms; pixel size, 40 nm)\n(A) Pre- and post-recording snapshots (confocal) of the full spindles.

Yellow arrowheads point to EB3 comets in confocal and STED stills. Scale bar, 1 μm.\nDefine the live-recording parameters:",
    "Adjust 488 nm laser intensity (∼0.2 kW/cm2 is enough to define the position of the kinetochore);\nAdjust 640 nm excitation laser intensity (∼1.2–1.8 kW/cm2);\nAdjust 775 nm depletion laser intensity (∼27.5 MW/cm2);\nNote: To determine laser intensity, the objective is removed, and the sensor is held at the opening of the nosepiece. The measured power level (Thorlabs S121B) is divided by a PSF-equivalent disk of 240 nm radius, yielding an estimated time-averaged power per area at the sample.\nDefine the radius of the bi-vortex phase mask (rho value);\nNote: This parameter (rho) is intrinsic to the CH-STED module developed in Pereira et al.,10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] which offers the ideal compromise between image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with decreased phototoxicity.\nAdjust the time-lapse to 750 ms and collect 80 frames;\nDefine pixel size to 40 nm;\nDefine pinhole size to 0.8 airy unit.\nNote: Pixel and pinhole size are transversal to all acquisitions (confocal and CH-STED);\nNote: The parameters defined in step 8 can be adjusted depending on the object and purpose of imaging. An evaluation of the imaging conditions - phototoxicity and SNR - should be carried after the first day of experiments (read ‘post-imaging analysis of microtubule growth events within k-fibers[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]’ and ‘troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ sections for further insight). Regarding the time-lapse and the number of repetitions parameters, we aimed for sub-second temporal resolution, as microtubule growth is a highly dynamic process. One-minute-long acquisition was sufficient to track EB3 comets within single k-fibers. To minimize phototoxicity, we chose a relatively coarse sampling in xy and a single focal plane.\nNote: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B depicts a representative example of a confocal vs CH-STED acquisition of EB3-tagged microtubule plus ends (for a more detailed analysis on the gains in resolution please see Almeida et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Select a smaller ROI that includes both sister kinetochores and one k-fiber in the same focal plane for live-cell imaging (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]);\nNote: Typical ROI size used ∼2.5 × 6.5 μm (width × length). Selecting a ROI that includes the kinetochore pair ensures that the kinetochore of interest is always in frame - chromosomes experience oscillations of around 1.5 μm relative to the spindle equator.\nCritical: the full-length of the k-fiber must be within a single focal plane. K-fibers that extend beyond a single focal plane should not be used.\nAcquire the STED time lapse movie according to the conditions previously defined;\nTake a confocal image of the full spindle as a post-recording example of spindle length (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) to monitor phototoxicity and photobleaching;\nNote: Check the ‘post-imaging analysis of microtubule growth events within k-fibers[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]’ section for in-depth analysis of phototoxicity readouts.\nSave the .msr file and open it in Fiji (ImageJ) to start data analysis.\nK-fiber maturation assay\nTiming: ∼ 2 h per coverslip (for step 13)\nThe k-fiber maturation assay was designed to study mechanisms that promote microtubule amplification within a pre-formed kinetochore microtubule fiber. To that end, we ablate part of a mature k-fiber with a pulsed laser microbeam and follow fluorescent signal recovery as a proxy for the efficiency of fiber recovery. To identify mature (metaphase) k-fibers, we use Indian muntjac fibroblasts stably expressing mScarlet-CENP-A to visualize kinetochores and GFP-α-tubulin which decorates the spindle.",
    "Critical: Fusing α-tubulin to a blue-shifted fluorescent protein prevents its excitation, and thus photo-bleaching, by the microsurgery laser radiation. This ensures that all signal reduction observed effectively corresponds to microtubule loss. Surgery efficiency should be validated by correlative live and fixed cell microscopy, in which we fix a cell seconds after performing k-fiber surgery and assess its integrity through CH-STED microscopy (see ‘troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’).\nPlace the chamber on the microscope;\nAlign the microsurgery laser:\nObtain a course prediction of the laser position by looking at breakage marks on the glass coverslip;\nFocus the coverslip by going a few micrometers below the interphase cells;\nHit the glass with 1 pulse of laser to identify its position and mark the coordinates on the software;\nNote: To increase accuracy in position prediction, adjust laser power to the minimum required to break the glass.\nRefine position prediction by identifying the center of the signal depletion region after surgery:\nFocus on a bright fluorescent structure that is stationary;\nNote: Prefer structures marked with a fluorophore that resists photo-bleaching by the microsurgery laser radiation. In our setup, we avoid the use of red-shifted fluorophores.\nHit the structure with one/multiple pulses of laser to identify its position and adjust the coordinates on the software;\nNote: Adjust laser power to the minimum required to damage the structure; find a compromise between the minimum laser power and number of pulses required to cause damage.\nNote: The microsurgery laser beam is narrow, hence the structure needs to be carefully focused; do small adjustments in the Z-position while applying pulses of laser to the sample to find the focal plane, before increasing the laser power.\nScan the coverslip for metaphase cells;",
    "After selecting a cell, focus a k-fiber where microsurgery will be performed and acquire a pre-surgery fluorescent image of the entire area of the cell (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B);\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2346-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Indian muntjac fibroblasts stably expressing GFP-α-tubulin (green) and mScarlet-CENP-A (magenta) were used to track k-fiber healing after laser-induced damage by live high-resolution microscopy (time lapse, 1 s; pixel size, 113 nm)\n(A) Schematic representation of the cut routine. The laser beam is positioned on the cortex-facing side of the k-fiber (gray cross). Three sequential pulses (bright red crosses) spaced by 0.35 μm, combined with three pulses in Z (spaced by 0.4 μm) at each point (faint red crosses), are applied to the fiber.\n(B) pre-cut image of the whole cell (yellow dashed rectangle highlights the ablated k-fiber; Scale bar, 5 μm) and insets showing the partially ablated k-fiber (GFP-α-tubulin, inverted grayscale; Scale bar, 1 μm) over time. Magenta arrowhead points to k-fiber injury at time zero (first frame after laser cut). Time is shown as minutes:seconds.\n(C) Schematic representation of the 3 regions of interest defined at each k-fiber: a - stub; b - spacer; c - dip.\n(D) Kinetics of the fluorescence recovery after surgery of the k-fiber shown in (A). Each data point corresponds to the average fluorescence intensity of the dip region (cavg) normalized to the average fluorescence intensity at the stub region (aavg), both relative to pre-cut levels.\n(E) Schematic representation of the pattern engraved on the glass coverslip (black lines) used to mark the cell on which microsurgery was performed in correlative live and fixed cell microscopy experiments. The upper right corner of the square that contains the two perpendicular lines (shown by the intersection of the gray dashed lines), points to the cell of interest.",
    "Note: Select a focal plane that contains the entire k-fiber where microsurgery will be performed. When possible, choose a plane that also contains both poles to track changes in spindle length.\nCritical: When selecting the k-fiber a few considerations should be taken into account: the full length of the fiber needs to be on a single focal plane, hence avoid cells with tilted spindles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]); the outermost fibers of the metaphase plate should be prioritized as they offer a clearer view both to perform surgery and to follow its outcome.\nInduce a partial cut along the transverse axis of the fiber by applying 2–5 sequential pulses (spaced by 0.35 μm), combined with 3 pulses in Z (spaced by 0.4 μm) at each point (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and proceed with imaging immediately after (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B);\nCritical: The cut should be performed from the periphery to the cell center to avoid affecting other spindle microtubules.\nProceed with imaging immediately after surgery, sampling the entire area of the cell every 1 s for 2 min and thereafter every 1 min up to 5 min using both 488 nm and 567 nm excitation wavelengths on a single focal plane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B);\nCritical: This routine was optimized to achieve a compromise between phototoxicity and the required time resolution. Spindle morphology, namely spindle length, was used as a readout of phototoxicity (additional details can be found in the ‘post-imaging analysis of microtubule recovery after microsurgery[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.2]’ and ‘troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ sections).\nNote: Light sensitivity will vary according to the cell line and further optimization might be required to determine the ideal conditions for other systems (e.g., acquire multiple focal planes or decrease acquisition time interval while monitoring for phototoxicity).\nSave the image sequence file and open it in Fiji (ImageJ) to start data analysis;",
