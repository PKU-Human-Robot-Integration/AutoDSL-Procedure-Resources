Next, mild fixation is performed by perfusing the cochlea to preserve the hair bundle structure without \"gluing\" the tectorial membrane onto it. The cochlea is then dissected, and the tectorial membrane removed cleanly, revealing the underlying hair bundles. The sample is then strongly fixed to increase its rigidity and resistance to mechanical damage during the remaining sample preparation and imaging.\nThe mouse is euthanized following laboratory animal care procedures, and then decapitated.\nAn incision is made with scissors to the skin from the back of the head, and the skin is peeled off the skull.\nThe skull is sectioned in two halves with scissors, and the brain tissue is removed with a thin spatula (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1465-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Inner ear extraction and mild fixation (steps 1–15)\n(A) Hemi-section of a P11 mouse head with removed skin (steps 1–2).\n(B and C) The brain is removed with a spatula, and the portion of the temporal part of the skull containing the inner ear is cut out and placed in a 35 mm dish with dissection buffer (steps 2–4). The blood vessels surrounding the inner ear can be used as a cutting landmark. Graphics of the inner eare adapted with permission from Shutterstock.\n(D and E) The inner ear is detached from the skull (steps 5–6).\n(F) Using a spoon, the inner ear is transferred to a 35 mm dish containing mild fixative, and the mesenchymal tissue and stapes ossicle are removed (step 7–9).\n(G) Make a hole at the cochlear apex (step 10).",
    "(H) Using a 1 mL syringe and a 35G needle, perfuse 0.5 mL of the mild fixative through the oval window. The fixative should be observed exiting the apical hole (steps 11–13).\n(I) Repeat the step through the round window (step 14).\n(J) Incubate in the fixative for 30 min without shaking and at RT (step 15).\nThe skull halves are cut with scissors to keep only the portion with the inner ear. The inner ear is visible at the inner surface of the temporal part of the skull. Blood vessels surrounding the inner ear are evident anatomical hallmarks that guide the cut (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: If the cut is not done with care, the inner ear can be damaged. Learn this step under a stereomicroscope.\nThe skull pieces containing the inner ear are placed in a 35 mm plastic petri dish containing the dissection buffer at room temperature (RT) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nThe inner ear is detached from the skull using forceps by gently removing the connecting tissue between both structures (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nThe inner ear is transferred to a new 35 mm dish with mild fixative (4% Paraformaldehyde) at RT (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCritical: The transfer of the inner ear tissue must always be performed in liquid. If the hair bundle is in contact with air, even momentarily, irreversible damage will occur. The tip links connecting stereocilia are particularly susceptible to this type of damage.\nFrom this point, use the stereomicroscope.\nMesenchymal tissue is cleared from the cochlea, and the stapes ossicle is removed from the oval window.\nA hole is made near the apex of the cochlea using a pick or a forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nFill a 1 mL syringe connected to a 26G needle with the mild fixative.",
    "Place the syringe at the oval window and slowly perfuse 0.5 mL of mild fixative (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H; Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nThe fixative should be seen coming out of the apical hole (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nPlace the needle at the round window and gently perfuse 0.5 mL of mild fixative (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nCritical: Stop the perfusion before any air bubbles come out of the syringe; otherwise, damage to the tissue will occur.\nThe inner ears are incubated in the fixative for 30 min at RT in the 35 mm petri dish without rocking (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nThe inner ears are transferred with a spoon in the dissection buffer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1465-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organ of Corti dissection (steps 16–24)\n(A) After fixation, the inner ear is transferred to a dish containing dissection buffer (step 16).\n(B and B') A cartoon representing a cross-section of a cochlear turn before its dissection and picture of a P7 mouse inner ear before dissection (step 17).\n(C and C') Cochlear bone is removed (step 18).\n(D and D′) Stria vascularis and inner sulcus are removed, pinching the structures at the base of the cochlea and unrolling them toward the apex (step 19).\n(E and E') The Reissner's membrane is removed (step 20).\n(F and G) The translucent tectorial membrane covers the hair cell hair bundles and is removed from the organ of Corti (step 21).\n(H) The organ of Corti is free from the tectorial membrane and still attached to the central cochlear bone, which facilitates downstream sample manipulations (step 22).\n(I) The dissected cochlea is transferred to a 2 mL round bottom tube containing strong fixative. The tube is kept a 4°C (without agitation) for at least 2 h (step 23–24).\nWith one forceps, grip the inner ear at the vestibule level.",
    "Critical: Depending on the age, the inner ear will vary in hardness as it progressively ossifies. Apply enough force to maintain control of the tissue without crushing it.\nUsing forceps with a crooked tip (e.g., damaged forceps), gently remove the cochlear bone like the shell of an egg (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, 3B', 3C, and 3C'; Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: Again, the tissue will react differently depending on the animal's age dissected. At P0-P3, the structure is fragile; between P4-P7, it is more robust, and the dissection is easier. Starting from P8 onwards, the cochlea dissection becomes increasingly challenging with its ossification: pieces of cochlear bone could come out with the sensory epithelium. In P10 and older animals, the apical turn can consistently be dissected; it is more challenging for the rest of the cochlea.\nThe stria vascularis and inner sulcus are removed by pinching the structures at the cochlear base or apex and unrolling them up slowly until they detach from the cochlea (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 3C', 3D, and 3D'; Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: For animals older than P7, the medial and basal part of the cochlea should be dissected differently: from the base, insert a forceps branch in the roof of the scala tympani and gently tear apart the tissue and progress apically. Skip step 20 (leave the Reisner's membrane in place; you will remove it after critical point drying).\nThe Reissner's membrane is removed (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, 3D', 3E, and 3E'; Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).",
    "The tectorial membrane (TM) is removed. Because of its translucence, the TM is difficult to visualize. Instead, gently pinch the forceps at the organ of the Corti surface either from the apical or the base. Once the TM is grabbed, it will detach easily and can be unrolled from the cochlea (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F–3H; Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]). However, the TM is stickier at early postnatal age and may need to be removed in pieces.\nThe vestibule is removed from the cochlea by repeatedly puncturing the junctional area with a branch of forceps (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]). The organ of Corti can be left on the central cochlear bone (the modiolus), which facilitates the transfer procedure and better protects the hair bundle during the rest of the procedure. Alternatively, the organ of Corti can also be removed from the cochlear bone and processed (Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).\nThe dissected samples are then transferred with a smaller spoon to a 2 mL tube containing the strong fixative (2.5 % Glutaraldehyde, 4% Paraformaldehyde in dissection buffer) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nThe samples are placed at 4°C (without agitation) for the fixation, which should last a minimum of 2 h and can be extended to 15–20 h without adverse effects.\nPause point: Once in the fixative, samples are safe, and can be synchronized.\nCritical: Appropriately dispose of the generated biological and chemical wastes (fixatives).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Detaching the organ of Corti from the cochlear bone (step 22) from a P7 cochlea\nStep 2: Sample dehydration\nTiming: 2 h 30 min\nTo prevent damage of biological samples when in the high vacuum of the SEM microscope chamber, the samples must be dehydrated. Otherwise, the water will exit the sample and damage its structure. First, optimal dehydration is reached by progressively replacing the aqueous solvent with ethanol, then replacing the ethanol with liquid CO2. Finally, taking advantage of the low temperature and pressure at which liquid CO2 becomes fluid, effuse it gently in a critical point drying (CPD) instrument.\nAfter fixation, the samples are washed with dissection buffer (3 × 5 min). Use plastic Pasteur transfer pipettes to remove or fill solutions efficiently, but always leave some liquid in the bottom covering the samples to prevent tissue damage (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1465-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sample dehydration and critical point drying (steps 25–34)\n(A) After fixation, the samples are washed with dissection buffer (2 × 5 min) and then washed with ice-cold H2O, 15%, 30%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and twice 100% ethanol for 5 min each and on ice (steps 25–27).\n(B) The samples are transferred with a spoon to a critical point drying sample holder that has itself been submerged in a glass container filled with ice-cold 100% ethanol (steps 28–29).",
    "(C and D) The critical point drying sample holder is placed in the chamber of a critical point drying instrument, pre-filled with 100% ethanol. The instrument will cool the ethanol, replace it with liquid CO2, and reach the CO2 critical point drying at 31°C and 1,070 psi. At this point, liquid CO2 will come fluid and slowly effuse from the sample without damaging the sample structure (steps 30–33).\n(E) After the procedure, the samples become white and highly fragile. The samples can be stored in a desiccator or directly mounted. The diameter of a well from this sample holder (2 × 12 wells) is 4 mm (step 34).\nDuring this time, prepare the ethanol dilutions in water (see next step) and cool them on ice.\nThe samples are then washed with water (2 × 5 min) and then with increasing percentages of ethanol diluted with water each time for 5 min and on ice without rocking:\n15% ethanol\n30% ethanol\n50% ethanol\n75% ethanol\n95% ethanol\n100% ethanol\n100% ethanol\nPlace the open CPD sample holder in a glass container filled with 100% ethanol (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nTransfer the dehydrated samples to the wells of the CPD sample holder using the spoon.\nCritical: The samples must stay in liquid at all times.\nCritical: Keep track of the location of each sample in the sample holder. Close the lid of the sample holder while it is in the ethanol.\nPause point: The samples can be kept at 4°C at this stage (seal the glass container with parafilm)",
    "Note: An alternative to CPD for dehydration is using low surface tension solvent hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). HMDS is miscible in ethanol and used after ethanol dehydration. HMDS evaporates from the tissue in less than an hour without special equipment. However, like stereocilia, the delicate cellular protrusions are distorted from the HMDS evaporation (Forge et al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTo use a CPD instrument, go to an EM facility with the samples.\nThe sample holder is quickly transferred from the glass container to the CPD instrument chamber, pre-filled with 100% ethanol.\nThe lid of the CPD chamber is tightly closed.\nThe CPD machine is started (follow instrument running instruction). The chamber will be cooled to −20°C, and liquid CO2 will be injected into the CPD chamber, followed by a double purge to replace the ethanol with liquid CO2 fully. The machine will then increase the pressure and the temperature of the chamber to reach the liquid CO2 critical point, where the physical state of CO2 is at the liquid/gas interface (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D). In this way, the liquid within the sample becomes fluid and is gently effused without damaging the sample. As a result, the sample is entirely dehydrated at the end of the run and becomes white (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nThe samples can be stored in a desiccator or directly mounted.\nCritical: CPD samples are incredibly fragile and sensitive to electrostatic charges. Samples can \"fly\" away when attempting to hold them with forceps.\nPause point: Samples (still in the CPD sample holder) can be stored in a desiccator without adverse effect for a few months as long they stay dry.\nStep 3: Sample mounting and metal coating\nTiming: 30 min per sample and 15–20 h drying",
    "Biological samples need to be made electrically conductive to produce good SEM images. This is critical for the experiment's success: if the sample is not conductive enough or improperly grounded, electrical charges will accumulate and be discharged cyclically, generating the \"charging\" artifact. This artifact prevents image acquisition and, when extreme, even sample observation.\nThe sample must be further dissected to minimize the distance between the tissue of interest and the metallic mounting stud.\nCritical: The CPD samples can be dissected with forceps but with extreme care: touching or grabbing the sample will damage it. A decision must be made about a part of the sample that is not critical; this area will become the holding part. The experimenter can also take advantage of the electrostatic sensitivity of the sample to \"attach\" it transiently to the forceps to transfer it.\nNote: The final dissection of the tissue can also be done before the dehydration. However, the surrounding tissue will not protect the hair bundles from damage against tube walls, and smaller pieces can be lost during dehydrations steps.\nPlace a piece of double-sided carbon tape on a stud. This stud will be used to transiently attach a sample for final dissection so that it does not fly away.\nTransfer the sample and gently deposit it onto the tape (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1465-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Dried-sample dissection, mounting on a stub, and metal coating (steps 35–46)\n(A) The sample must be further dissected to minimize the distance between the tissue of interest and the metallic mounting stub. Because the samples are highly sensitive to electrostatic charges and can “fly” away easily, a sample is temporarily held in place on a double-sided carbon tape placed on a stub (a so-called holder stub) (steps 35–37).",
    "(B) Dried apical turn of a P11 mouse cochlea (steps 35–37).\n(C) A mixture of silver paint and epoxy is placed on another stub (the mounting stub). This stub has a 45° radius beveled face that is optimal for imaging the front side of hair bundles (steps 38–39).\n(D) Parts of the cochlear turn are positioned tangentially to the stud middle edge (step 40).\n(E) After drying 15–20 h in a desiccator, a thin layer of metal is deposited onto the sample. To coat all sides of the hair bundles and obtain optimal conductivity, the coating is first performed on the backside (using a custom-made adaptor) with 2 nm of Palladium (step 45a).\n(F) Next, the front side of the hair bundles are coated with 2 nm of Palladium (steps 45b).\n(G) A total of 4 nm of palladium had been coated onto the hair bundle with a sputter coater instrument (step 46).\n(H) An uncoated sample for visual comparison with the coated sample in G (step 46). Stub diameter: 11 mm, Scale bar: B: 0.5 mm\nPrepare a second stud where the sample will be mounted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: Two major types of studs can be used: flat ones or beveled ones. The choice depends on the type of image you are looking for. For example, it is best to use a flat stud for a top view of the hair bundle. However, if your goal is to image the hair bundle is inside/front view to see the tip links, then a 45° radius beveled stud is better.\nChoose and prepare the mounting medium. Two types of mounting media can be used:\nThe same double-sided carbon tape. It is the easiest way to mount samples but not always possible to use in the SEM microscope (see below).",
    "Note: While using the double-sided tape is convenient and easy, because of the tape's atomic composition, imaging will vaporize carbon atoms. This can affect the results of elemental analysis of surface experiments that other users of the SEM microscope might be doing. Confirm the compatibility of the mounting with the EM facility.\nA conductive silver paint and epoxy resin mixture at a 1:1 ratio using a pipet tip and a plastic petri dish. This mounting medium will not affect the elemental analysis of surface experiments.\nCritical: You need to test the appropriate time after mixing the two parts of the mounting medium: If used too early, the mixture may be too liquid and can penetrate your sample by capillarity and damage it. If used too late, the mixture could be too hard, and the electrical contact between the sample and the mixture will be too weak, increasing the risk of charging during imaging.\nTo obtain the best images, the working distance (the distance between the sample and the electron gun) must be short.\nFor a flat stud, if the samples are to be imaged from the top, they can be distributed in the stud's entire surface. However, if a tilted-sample view is needed, the sample should be mounted along the perimeter edge of the flat stud, with the front side of hair cells facing outward. If the sample is too far from the edge, the working distance after tilting the stage might be too long to obtain a good resolution.\nFor a beveled stud (with the goal of imaging the front side of the hair bundle), the sample must be placed at the edge between the beveled and the flat portions of the stud, with the hair bundles facing toward the flat surface of the stud.",
    "To increase the number of hair bundles parallel to the central stud edge, it is recommended to \"break\" the cochlear turns into smaller parts with forceps and position them tangentially to the central edge. In addition, it is recommended to mount the samples in the cochlear apicobasal order (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nOnce a stud is filled, draw a sample map on a sheet to reference it. This map will be handy to navigate between samples and link your results to a specific sample part.\nFor samples mounted with the conductive silver paint and epoxy resin, dry the sample 15–20 h by placing them in a desiccator.\nCritical: The sample must not contain liquid; otherwise, electric conductivity will be affected. The silver paint/epoxy resin mixture takes some time to dry. Do not shortcut it.\nThe sample needs to be coated with a metal layer to be electrically conductive. Choose the appropriate metal for your application.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1465_5.csv\nFor more information, see (Heu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: The choice of the metal is based on the resolution you are interested in, the price, and the durability of the coating. Different metals produce different grain-sized, and some are more conductive than others. Historically, gold has been widely used because of its high conductivity, but its large grain-size (10–12 nm) is incompatible with fine surface details preservation. In our hands, iridium or palladium is the best option (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and Heu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] for more information).\nPlace your sample in the coating chamber of a sputter coater (likely found in your EM facility) with the appropriate metal target inserted.",
    "The amount of metal to be coated needs to be determined: A thick coating will provide optimal electric conductivity but will affect the sample's surface; a too thin coating might still show charging artifacts. In our lab, we coat the sample in two steps to maximize the coverage of sample:\nFirst, the sample is placed onto a custom-made adaptor (made with epoxy putty found in home improvement store) for the 45°degree beveled stud samples to be used in the sputter coater: this compensates for the 45°degree, so the mounting surface is horizontal. Then, the samples are positioned away from the center so that the coating will mainly affect the backside of the hair bundles. About 2 nm of metal are sputter-coated this way (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nSecondly, the sample is placed directly on the flat sample holder of the sputter coater, with the hair bundle facing the center of the holder. In this way, the front side of the hair bundle is coated with 2 nm of metal (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nThe coated sample (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G and 5H) is then placed in a sample box and stored in a desiccator until observation.\nCritical: Samples are sensitive to water in the air. Always seal the sample box with parafilm when out of the desiccator. If the sample is protected from humidity, it can be reimaged for years. A fresh thin metal coating can be added to the sample to reimage it.\nStep 4: SEM sample imaging and analysis\nTiming: 3–5 h session\nAll the steps described above must have been correctly executed to produce good SEM images.\nReserve the microscope\nVent the SEM chamber and place your sample in the sample holder of the SEM stage.\nClose the chamber and generate a vacuum.\nFollow the standard procedure for plasma sample cleaning.",
    "Proceed with the standard procedure of the SEM (beam centering, stage-height positioning, alignment of the condenser lens, and stigmatism).\nCritical: Aligning the microscope is critical to obtaining high-resolution images. It can take 45 min to perform alignment properly. The ETD (Everhart-Thornley Detector) detector is used for initial inspection of the sample and low mag imaging as it has a larger depth of field. The TLD (Through the Lens Detector) detector is recommended for high-resolution pictures, particularly in its \"lens immersion mode.\" In this setting, sub-nanometer resolution can be reached. However, the depth of field is reduced. Alignment of the beam, lens, and stigmatism must be redone when the detector or the beam current is changed.\nIdentify the region of interest. If necessary, tilt the stage to be in the optimal viewing position.\nCritical: Be extremely careful when making this adjustment, so the sample does not touch and damage the electron gun.\nObtain the best focus on a hair bundle that is not critical. By doing so, you will determine the effect of the beam current on the structure.\nMove to a nearby hair bundle, obtain a quick focus, zoom out to frame the entire hair bundle, adjust the image angle (scan rotation), and start the acquisition.\nNote: The standard imaging settings at the Grillet lab are obtained at 5 kV, 25 pA, 4 mm Working Distance, imaging 30 sec dwell timeline at 2048 × 1887 pixels (7.7 MB), which takes about 4 min.\nSave and name the file with all information about the sample.\nCritical: Always shoot a low mag picture of your sample of interest for future reference and be able to assign higher resolution pictures to a position along the cochlea length.\nAnnotate your sample map to record the quality of the sample according to your goals.",
    "End your SEM session by stopping the beam, bringing the stage to the loading position, and venting the chamber.\nRemove the sample from the microscope, close the chamber, and start the pump to re-establish the vacuum.\nCompare SEM pictures of each sample to find differences. Then, we recommend making some picture plates in Photoshop (Adobe), with all the sample pictures in one column.\nIf a difference is suspected, it needs to be quantified to ensure statistically significant and not just an experimental artifact."
