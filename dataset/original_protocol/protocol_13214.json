    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Xingtai General Hospital of North China Medical Health Group (Approval number: ZCKT-2021-0009). This study used healthy skeletally mature New Zealand white rabbits (female, 1 year, 3-5 kg).\n1. Pre-operative preparation\nFast the rabbits and deprive them of water for 6-8 h before general anesthesia.\nWeigh the rabbit.\nSwab the ear with 70% ethanol using a gauze sponge.\nApply local anesthetic cream to the ears.\nApply pressure around the base of the ear to distend the marginal ear vein.\nSedate the rabbits using midazolam (1-2 mg/kg) by injecting into the marginal ear vein20.\nAdminister the inhalation anesthesia with a mask. Set the oxygen rate to 1 L/min and the isoflurane concentration to 4%-5% to induce anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: To judge the depth of anesthesia, pull the animal's hind leg out straight and pinch the foot hard using the thumb and forefinger. Animals should not be operated on until the withdrawal reflex has abated21.\nMaintain the isoflurane concentration at 2.5%-3.5% (depending on the rabbit's weight).\n2. Intra-operative procedures\nAutoclave the surgical tools (vessel clamp/forceps, tissue scissors, stitch scissors, scalpel handle, #22 scalpel blade, double-ended handheld retractor, sterile gauze, 3-0 absorbable suture, 4-0 non-absorbable braided suture, needle holder, peanut gauze [a hand-made ball-shaped gauze], 5 mL syringe, 1 mL syringe, 16 G needle, 26 G needle, a depth of 5 mm stopper) before proceeding with the surgical procedure.\nSterilize the operating table with 75% alcohol.\nUsing an electric razor and depilatory paste, shave the region defined from the lowest rib to the iliac crest level on the ventral side of the rabbit.\n\tNOTE: Avoid damaging the nipples.\nPosition the rabbit on the operating table supinely and secure the limbs.",
    "Take the line of the iliac crest on both sides as the midpoint and draw the line 2 cm above and below as the landmarks for the surgical incision site. Mark these landmarks with a sterile pen.\nDisinfect the skin with a povidone-iodine solution twice. Place a sterile fenestrated square drape over the surgical site and a large square drape to cover the operating table. Maintain a strict aseptic environment throughout the entire procedure.\nInject 2 mL of 2% lidocaine subcutaneously before the surgical incision to relieve post-operative pain.\nMake the incision along the landmarks using a #22 scalpel blade, and bluntly separate the fascia, muscle, and abdominal wall using curved forceps and tissue scissors.\nEnter into the peritoneal cavity until the bladder is seen. Use the double-ended handheld retractor to pull the bladder and other intestinal cavity organs to the left carefully. Then find the bifurcation of the iliac vein, and take this as the mark point for the L5-6 disc underneath it.\n\tNOTE: Pay attention to avoid injuring any abdominal organs, especially the intestines.\nUse a finger to touch the abdominal aorta pulsating on the right side of the spine and pull the blood vessels and organs to the left.\nAfter manipulating the protruding disc (L5-6), incise the posterior peritoneum and then use the peanut gauze to obtuse dissect the prevertebral muscle tissue.\nTo confirm the correct level of the target disc and the direction of the needle, use a 26 G needle to puncture the vertebrae next to the target disc and check this under the guidance of C-arm.",
    "After locating the target disc, place the 16 G needle tip parallel to both the upper and lower cartilage endplates. Then, use the needle tip to puncture the IVD center to a depth of 5 mm (using a stopper), holding for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: Take a lumbar anteroposterior and lateral x-ray to check whether the position of the needle tip is at the center of the IVD and the direction of the needle tip is parallel to the upper and lower endplates, respectively.\nRepeat the same procedure for the next L6-7 disc.\nUse warm saline to irrigate the abdominal cavity and check hemorrhaging before closing the incision.\nPerform layered closure. Use 3-0 synthetic absorbable sutures to close the fascial layer continuously. Suture the full-thickness skin by using 4-0 non-absorbable braided sutures.\nTurn off the vaporizer and stop the anesthesia. Keep the rabbit under constant observation in a metabolic cage until it can move normally.\n3. Post-operative management\nInject ceftriaxone sodium (25 mg/kg) intramuscularly immediately post-surgery.\nAllow animals to move and feed freely. Continue to observe for signs of any neurological complications, such as paralysis of the legs, problems with urination and defecation, or digestive system complications.\nSubscription Required.
