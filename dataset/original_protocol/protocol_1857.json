    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStarting from pretraining and until the completion of the experiment, octopuses should only be fed during training.\nOur pretraining and training schedule was the same as the feeding schedule, with pretraining/training sessions every other day.\nNote: While any form of food deprivation is not recommended, feeding only during training enhances motivation to participate in the trials.\nPretraining: maze-food association\nTiming: 20 min/day per octopus\nIn this phase the octopuses learn to generally associate the maze with food, and then associate inserting arms into the maze with food.\nNote: For this phase, use the basic Y maze.\nFor this stage the entire maze is baited with food: both goal boxes, both side tubes and throughout the central stem, and especially in the maze opening which is visible to the octopus (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nExperimenter 1 uses an aquarium hand net to ensure that the octopus remains in the den or the back of the tank, preventing the animal from interacting with the maze before it is properly positioned and secured to the front glass (see example in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nExperimenter 2 attaches the opaque plexiglass maze to the front glass of the tank, ensuring that water fills the entire maze and goal boxes.\nCritical: In order to secure the food in the vertical maze the pieces of food must be cut large enough to wedge into the maze tubes and not fall out. Care must be taken that when placing the baited maze into the water the water reaches throughout the whole maze.\nWhen the maze is secure, remove the net.",
    "If the octopus does not approach the maze, lure it to approach with movement near the front glass (see example in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). This usually results in the octopus reaching an arm or swimming to the front and then accidentally encountering the food at the entrance to the maze.\nIf the octopus tries to insert more than one arm into the maze at the same time, or if it tries to open the goal boxes directly (see goal box detail in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), gently push it back with the hand net.\nAllow the octopus to insert its arms multiple times and remove multiple pieces of food, until the food is removed from one of the goal boxes.\nWhen the food is removed from one of the goal boxes remove the maze from the tank.\nNote: The maze is removed from the tank to prevent an arm reaching a goal box without getting a food reward.\nCritical: The removal of the maze should be immediate, after food is removed from a goal box. At this stage the octopus is trained to associate the maze with food, and inserting an arm into the maze as the interaction that is required to get food. Reaching an empty goal box from which food cannot be retrieved is information we want to add only in the experiment phase, in which the octopus must learn that not all interactions will result in a food reward.\nRepeat this procedure until the octopus has consumed a total of 10 pieces of shrimp.\nNote: This stage is completed once the octopus purposefully approached and inserted arms into the maze for 2–3 sessions.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Example of Y maze Side preference trial",
    "Available food is present in both goal boxes, related to steps 10–14.\nExperimenter 1 holds the octopus at the back of the tank with a hand net. Experimenter 2 fixes the maze in place. The hand net is removed for the start of the trial. Experimenter 2 lures the octopus in the direction of the maze. The octopus approaches, inserts a single arm into the maze, into the side 2 goal box, and retrieves and eats the food reward.\nPretraining: arm insertion - subsequent food reward association\nTiming: 20 min/day per octopus\nIn this stage the octopuses learn to associate inserting an arm through the central stem and into the side tubes, with a subsequent food reward. Food is placed only in the side tubes and goal boxes, and not at the central stem or intersection. No food is visible at the entrance to the maze (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nRepeat steps 1–6\nNote: This stage is completed once the octopuses consistently recovered the food from the maze and entered the arm all the way into a goal box for at least 2 sessions.\nSide preference\nTiming: 2–4 days; 1 h/day per octopus\nNote: For this phase, use the basic Y maze.\nAs in pretraining, side preference training sessions are conducted according to the feeding schedule. We conducted trials once every other day.\nIn this phase of the training, each session consists of 10 trials.\nPlace available food (no net insert) in both goal boxes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nStart the filming camera.\nExperimenter 1 uses an aquarium hand net to ensure that the octopus remains in the den or the back of the tank. (See example in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Experimenter 2 attaches the opaque plexiglass maze to the front glass of the tank, ensuring that water fills the entire maze and goal boxes.\nWhen experimenter 1 removes the aquarium hand net, experimenter 2 starts a timer.\nIf within 1 min from the beginning of the trial the octopus does not make any attempt to approach the maze, lure it with movement outside the tank.\nThe trial ends when the octopus arm passes into either of the goal boxes. At this point the octopus can retrieve the food reward.\nOnce the arm has grasped the reward the maze should be removed. It is important that the arm only reach one goal box.\nExperimenter 2 marks the trial duration, the side choice, whether the animal was lured and whether it took the food.\nCritical: After the food in the goal box is grasped, the removal of the maze should be immediate. The animal should not be allowed to make a second choice.\nIf within 3 min the octopus does not make a choice, end the trial and remove the maze.\nSwitch the locations of the experimenters.\nWait until the food reward is fully eaten before starting the next trial.\nComplete steps 10–16 until reaching a total of 10 trials.\nIf the octopus does not approach the maze in three consecutive trials end the session.\nA minimum of 20 trials should be conducted to assess a potential side preference.\nAt the end of the trial, the time, the choice made, whether the animal was lured and whether it took the food, were recorded.",
    "Note: The experiment is best performed with two experimenters in the room, their position relative to the camera switches between trials. In order to perform the experiment in a balanced manner with only one experimenter, the position of the experimenter relative to the camera should be randomized. In this case, preferably 20 trials per experimenter position should be conducted (a total of at least 40 trials).\nTactile discrimination experiment\nTiming: varies; 1 h/day per octopus\nNote: For this phase, use the tactile discrimination maze.\nAs in pretraining and side preference, tactile discrimination sessions are conducted according to the feeding schedule. We conducted trials once every other day.\nAs in side preference, each session consists of 10 trials.\nAssign each of the octopuses a correct and incorrect stimulus-\nHalf of the octopuses should be assigned rough as the correct stimulus (rough+/smooth-). For them a correct trial is inserting an arm to the goal box of the rough side tube. Use the tactile discrimination maze with the net in front of the food on the smooth side goal box, and behind the food on the rough side goal box.\nThe other half should be assigned smooth as the correct stimulus (smooth+/rough-). For them a correct trial is inserting an arm to the goal box of the smooth side tube. Use the tactile discrimination maze with the net behind the food on the smooth side goal box, and in front of the food on the rough side goal box.\nCreate a random presentation sequence for the position of the correct goal box. In order to randomize the position of the correct goal box, use the two tactile discrimination mazes, and present them following a restricted randomness sequence (Fellows, 1967[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "The octopuses are prevented from using chemical information to find the correct side, by placing food in both goal boxes, but blocking the food with the net on the incorrect side.\nNote: Using a restricted randomness sequence in a 2-choice task (Fellows, 1967[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), ensures that an animal cannot reach a significantly correct level of performance using any other rule, such as win-switch or a win-stay strategies, but must follow the discrimination cue in order to succeed.\nFollowing the stimulus presentation list, and according to the trained octopuses’ correct stimulus, out of view of the animal:\nPlace food in both goal boxes.\nPlace a net in front of the food in the incorrect goal box.\nPlace a net behind the food in the correct goal box\nStart the filming camera.\nExperimenter 1 uses an aquarium hand net to ensure that the octopus remains in the den or the back of the tank. (See example in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nExperimenter 2 attaches the opaque plexiglass maze to the front glass of the tank, ensuring that water fills the entire maze and goal boxes.\nWhen experimenter 1 removes the aquarium hand net, experimenter 2 starts a timer.\nIf within 1 min from the beginning of the trial the octopus does not make any attempt to approach the maze lure it with movement outside the tank.\nThe trial ends when the octopus arm passes into either of the goal boxes.\nIf the arm entered the correct goal box, allow the octopus to grasp the food reward and then remove the maze.\nIf the arm enters the incorrect goal box, immediately remove the maze.",
    "Critical: When an incorrect choice is made, removal of the maze should be immediate. If the octopus manages to make a second choice, it cannot learn the association between the correct stimulus and the location of the correct goal box.\nExperimenter 2 marks the trial duration, the choice, whether it was correct or incorrect, whether the animal was lured and whether it took the food.\nIf within 3 min the octopus does not make a choice, end the trial and remove the maze.\nSwitch the locations of the experimenters.\nWait until the food reward is fully eaten before starting the next trial.\nRepeat steps 21–30, at 10 trials per session, until reaching the learning criterion.\nIf the octopus does not approach the maze in three consecutive trials end the session.\nNote: In order to prevent unintentional food deprivation, if the octopuses make more than seven mistakes, it is necessary to feed the animal additional food outside of the training trials. In this case it is important to wait at least an hour between training and feeding so that the octopus does not associate the feeding with the experiment.\nEnd of experiment\nThe experiment ends when the learning criterion is reached. We chose a criterion of 8 of 10 correct choices in a single training session. This is a statistically significant difference between correct and incorrect trials (Post experiment video analysis is used to confirm the learning result – see video analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.6] below).",
    "Note: For all the stages it is important to let the octopus finish consuming the food before beginning a new trial. Octopuses can hold food in the mouth area and consume it for long periods of time while still continuing to interact. However, this might influence motivation and which arm they choose to use to interact with the maze.\nVideo analysis\nTiming: At least twice the amount of recorded hours\nImport all videos to Observer XT, for manual frame-by-frame analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1450-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example of post experiment video analysis of experimental trials - arm insertion, stimulus interaction and movement duration\nNote: Video analysis can be done by any behavioral observation video analysis software.\nAnalyze videos without consulting the notes and times written during the experiment.\nThe tactile discrimination task requires interaction with a stimulus once the arm is in a side tube, and only then a decision regarding whether the side is correct is made.\nSeveral measures can be collected to evaluate the presence of stimulus interactions, decision making after stimulus interaction and information transfer between arms. For this purpose, we recorded time points for:\nFirst touch of the maze – This sometimes helps determining motivation to participate in the experiment.\nArm insertion into the central stem – The start of movement into the maze\nArm at bifurcation point- The time at which one of the side tubes is first entered.\nArm entered side 1; Arm entered side 2 – Measure for first stimulus encountered and potential change between sides.\nChoice time – Used for determining the duration of the arm insertion to choice. Each trial was also marked with:",
    "Movement strategy of the arm inside the maze (Gutnick et al. 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])– In our experiment two strategies were seen – search or straight. Search movements allowed for potentially more interaction time with the stimulus area required for making a choice. Comparison of arm insertion to choice duration confirmed that these movements were different in time, with search movements being significantly longer.\nThe identity of the individual arm making the choice (r1, r2, r3, r4, l1, l2, l3, l4) – This is used to determine if information is transferred between arms or learned by each arm independently. It can show whether the learning is at arm level or at the level of the CNS and then communicated to the arms.\nThe number of entries to each maze side– This can indicate restarting or redirecting the arm to find the correct stimulus side.\nPosition of the animal relative to the maze (as marked by eye level and position of the mantle: side 1, side 2, below, above) – In some cases this might influence the identity of the arm inside the maze. Usually if the animal sits covering the maze, it can only use hind arms for the task.\nAdditional measures of learning;\nLearning should be confirmed by comparison with performance in the beginning of the experiment, as well as comparison with choices in side preference trials. The restricted randomness sequence (Fellows, 1967[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) ensures that criterion cannot be reached by following non learning rules, such as repeating a sequence, repeated choice of a single side or following a win-switch or lose-switch strategy.",
    "The additional details regarding the movement of the arm in the maze help confirm learning. In our experiment animals shifted from using the straight and search arm movement strategies equally in the beginning of the experiment to primarily using the search movements. These details showed that one aspect of the learning process was shifting to the more successful movement strategy.\nTest observer reliability by comparing choices recorded from video analysis with choices recorded during the experiment. Additionally, an independent evaluator, not involved in filming, should fully analyze at least 20% of the trials and those results compared to analyzed data."
