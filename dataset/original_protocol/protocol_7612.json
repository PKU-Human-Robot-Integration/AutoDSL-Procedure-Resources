    "DNA donor PCR primer design and synthesisPrinciple for design of dsDNA donor primers:Only two homology arms (HAs) with 50 nt sequence are designed at the 5′ end of the synthesized forward and reverse primers.Note: Longer HA sequences generally lead to higher HDR efficiency, but also likely increase the PCR difficulties. Principle of design for odsDNA donor primers:i. Likewise, two 50 nt HA sequences are designed at the 5′ ends of the synthesized forward and reverse primers, respectively.ii. Specify the five consecutive phosphorothioate modifications in the synthesized 50 nt primers at designated positions, as needed. “*” represents phosphorothioate (PT) modification. Lower-case letters are HA sequences and upper-case letters depict exogenous KI sequences. We used the first PCR product as a template in order to save the cost of primer synthesis; long primers are not needed. The primer sequences are shown in Table 2.Table 2.

Grow the bacteria until the OD600 reaches ~0.6–0.8.Note: The optimal growth time for TB is different, which requires OD600 to be more than 1.0–1.5 prior to IPTG induction.",
    "Cool on ice or in a cold room for 20 min, then add IPTG to a final 0.2 mM concentration. Continue the shaking at 18 ℃ overnight (18–20 h).The next day, pellet the culture medium and weigh the pellet. Resuspend the cells with buffer A at ~6 mL/g.Add 50 μL of β-mercaptoethanol to per 50 mL of bacterial suspension. Sonication: set up at 35% amplitude, 1.5 s ON, 8.5 s OFF, to get the whole ON time for ~10 min, for a total time of ~66.7 min.Note: The parameters vary depending on the sonicator; the goal is to attain a homogeneous lysate (more whitish in appearance). Spin the lysate at 16,000× g for 30 min at 4 ℃ and transfer supernatant to a new 50 mL tube.Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 μm filter.Equilibrate a 5 mL His-trap column (GE) with buffer A (at least 25 mL).Note: If using a previously used column, it can be recovered through the washing cycle by NaOH, ddH2O, and HCl, and then keep the column submerged in 5 mL of ddH2O. Cleaning of His-trap column:Note: This step is only required for recovery of old columns. Before use, first wash with 10 mL of 0.1 M NiSO4, 10 mL of ddH2O, and finally with 20 mL of buffer A.In use: Slowly compress the pipette to ensure that the filter filters out drop by drop (not forming a liquid flow).After use: ddH2O wash 10 mL0.1 M EDTA, 1 M NaCl wash 10 mLddH2O wash 10 mL1 M NaOH wash 10 mLddH2O wash 10 mL1 M HCl wash 10 mLddH2O wash 10 mLNote: The column must be kept in water. Filter to ensure that there are no air bubbles in the column. Store at 4 ℃ .Next purification step using FPLC protocol.",
    "Note: The buffer needs to be prepared in advance! The filtered column should not be sucked by water and cannot contact other solutions (so ensure that all connections are correct). Instrument settings: place the start buffer in Pump A1, place the elution buffer in Pump B1, select the column connection line of position 2, place the connection point of A1 upstream, and place the connection point of B1 downstream. Wash step:i. Open the AKTA Explorer UNICORN software, select Execute... in Manual, select Pumps B in wash, and then click Inlet.ii. Select position 2 for the middle circle and waste for the filtered interface.iii. Select Pumps A wash after the automatic stop. The steps are as above.iv. Finally, clean the whole system flow, select the flow rate of 5 mL/min, pressure OFF, wash for 10 min.Note: Use all buffer A and gradient options as 0% buffer B. All tubes after elution need to be replaced with new ones. Starting from No. 1, approximately forty 1.5 mL tubes are placed in order. Lift the outflow tip up, move directly onto the first tube, and position the column in place.Set up the flow rate and channel in the Manual option.i. Flow rate: 1.5 mL/minii. Pressure: System pressureiii. Gradient: Target 4% buffer Biv. Fraction collection-fraction volume: 5 mLv. Alarms: Alarm system pressure: High clarm-1.00 MpaNote: After completing the setting, double-check whether the elution system functions automatically in order. Once the mAU value stabilizes, change the target of gradient to 10% buffer B and set the time to 15 min, in order to wash possible non-specifically bound protein. This gradient takes ~15 min to go from 4% buffer B to 10% buffer B.",
    "Wait again until it stabilizes and the peaks disappear; then, change the gradient to 20% buffer B and set the time to 15 min.Note: The safety imidazole concentration for Cas9 protein ranges between 50 and 250 mM. After reaching 250 mM, it indicates substantial absence of impurities if no peak present. Collect the eluent at peaks approximately within the range of 50–250 mM imidazole.Run SDS-PAGE for gel verification of the protein molecular weight.In the peak effluent, take 8 μL of crude protein product from each tube, add 2 μL of SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer (5×), and denature at 95 ℃ for 10 min.Note: The first flowthrough serves as control. Marker: add 5 μL BeyoColor Prestained Color Protein marker 10–170 kDa. Running conditions: 150 V, 30 min. Stain in protein staining solution after completion.Note: Microwave for 15 s or shake for 5 min. Then, shake for 30 min.Check the protein sizes: Cas9 is ~163 kDa and Cas9-PCV2 is ~179 kDa.

    "Approximately 10 tubes of 100 μL of Coomassie Brilliant Blue are required to detect in real time when elute has protein presence and to compare protein concentrations.Wash the PD-10 column with Cas9 storage buffer three times for 5 min every time.Then, add 2.5 mL of concentrated solution to PD10, followed by centrifugation. Add 500 μL of storage buffer, collect the elute with a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, add 500 μL each time for a total of seven times, and collect seven tubes for each 500 μL product.Take out 3 μL of the product and mix with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, distinguish the blue brightness, select the brightest five tubes of product, transfer to the second PD-10, which has been exchanged with Cas9 buffer, and perform the second desalting.Measure the brightness, pick up four tubes with the highest blue staining, and proceed to the next protein concentration.Note: Perform these steps in a cold room; load PD-10 column with less than or equal to 2.5 mL volume. Concentrate the desalted protein.Add 2 mL of the desalted product to a 3 K 15 mL pre-cooled centrifuge filter and then centrifuge in a pre-cooled centrifuge at 4,000× g for approximately 30 min.

Preparation of the RNP complex for odsDNA attaching to Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein Design and synthesis of the PCV2 linker.Because PCV2 protein recognizes DNA sequence (AAGTATT^ACCAGAAA) in 5′ to 3′ direction, odsDNA has 3′ overhang, and a PCV2 linker is needed as a bridge to attach odsDNA to Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein.Note: “^” represents the cleavage position of the PCV2 protein.",
    "The PCV2 linker is divided into two parts: the 5′ end is a fixed sequence recognized by the PCV2 protein for cleavage, followed by subsequent covalent linkage to PCV2 protein, and the 3′ end is a sequence that anneals to the 3′ overhang of odsDNA.The PCV2 linker sequence for the Lamin A/C locus is shown in Table 11.Table 11.

    "Prepare RNP complex composed of odsDNA/PCV2 linker/Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein.In order to verify that odsDNA/PCV2 linker can be effectively attached to the Cas9-PCV2 protein, different molar ratios of 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 were incubated with Cas9-PCV2 protein and then verified by 2% agarose gel. As shown in Figure 4, when the molar ratio of Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein to odsDNA/PCV2 linker was 3:1, the free odsDNA/PCV2 linker below was almost completely reacted, and all odsDNA/PCV2 linker was attached to the Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4853/bioprotoc-13-20-4853-g004.jpgFigure 4. Verification for the attachment of odsDNA to Cas9-PCV2 protein. Efficient tethering of odsDNA donors to Cas9-PCV2 when the ratio of Cas9-PCV2 to pre-annealed odsDNA/PCV2 linker reaches > 3:1.Add 30 pmol Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein to the odsDNA/PCV2 linker complex from step D2.Because Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein is much more abundant than odsDNA, almost all odsDNA is reacted completely attached to Cas9-PCV2 fusion protein.The working condition of PCV2 protein requires the presence of at least 1 mM Mg2+. Since the buffer C: storage buffer of Cas9-PCV2 protein has 10 mM MgCl2, no additional Mg2+ is needed here.Nucleofection of the odsDNA/Cas9-PCV2/sgRNA RNP complex into HEK293T cells Before nucleofection, sub-culture the HEK293T cells three days prior to nucleofection experiments using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and 10% fetal bovine serum.Nucleofection of HEK293T cells with odsDNA/Cas9-PCV2/sgRNA:Cell preparationi.
