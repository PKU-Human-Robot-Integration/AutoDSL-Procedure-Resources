    "Animal experiments were approved by the University of Würzburg and the legal state authorities (Lower Franconia, approval number: 54-2531.01-102/13) and performed according to the recommendations for research in experimental stroke studies17 and the current Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments Guidelines (http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines).\n1. Anesthesia\nCheck the anesthetic system to ensure adequate amounts of supply gas (oxygen) and isoflurane for the duration of the procedure. Connect the nosecone with the incisor bar of the stereotaxic instrument and put the incisor bar on -3.3 mm.\nTurn on the supply gas (2 L/min). Place the rat into a box and seal the top. Turn on the isoflurane vaporizer to 3.5%.\nWhen the rat is recumbent, switch the system so that the anesthetic gas flows to the nosecone which is fixed to the incisor bar. \nRemove the rat from the box chamber and shave the area between the ears and the eyes; using a cotton bud soaked with Jodosept PVP, swab the shaved area to remove any loose hair.\nPosition the rat in the nosecone (Figure 1) and continue the anesthesia with isoflurane 2.5% in O2 (1 L/min). Check the level of anesthesia by pinching the interdigital area. If the rat is anesthetized adequately, the defensive reflexes are abolished (i.e., withdrawal of the foot).\nMonitor respiration and response to stimulation during procedure and adjust the vaporizer as needed.\nApply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Monitor and maintain body temperature at 37 ± 0.5 °C by a feedback-controlled heating system.\n2. Surgery",
    "Keep the surgical field sterile during the whole surgery. Once the surgeon´s hands are sterile and the operating field is sterile, move only carefully and remember not to break sterility. This includes having also a sterile field (i.e., sterile waterproof drapes) on which one may set down instruments.\nInject 0.2 ml mepivacaine subcutaneously into the center of the shaved area. Mepivacaine is a local anesthetic that has a duration of action of up to 3 hr. It will further anesthetize the surgical area. \nUsing a scalpel, make a midline incision starting between the ears and extending towards 2 cm. Ensure that the periosteum (shiny membrane under the skin) is also incised. Expose the skull with four clamps (Figure 2).\nUsing a cotton bud, gently remove the periosteum until the coronal and sagittal sutures are exposed; thereafter, stanch the blood with cotton wool.\nDetermine the coordinates of the bregma using a needle fixed at a probe holder, and then mark the tip of the needle with a black felt-tip pen. Using the anterior/posterior (AP), midline/lateral (ML) and dorsoventral (DV) drive screws, position the tip of the needle directly over the bregma.\nTake the AP and ML vernier scale readings: subtract 3.6 mm from the AP reading and 2.5 mm from the ML reading for electrode implantation into the right STN, or add 2.5 mm for electrode implantation into the left STN. This position will be marked by the dye of the felt-tip pen after lowering the tip of the needle to the surface of the skull.",
    "Clamp the dental drill onto the large probe holder of the stereotaxic instrument. Move the dental drill to the calculated area – i.e., the marked point on the skull. Looking through the microscope, drill a hole (diameter about 1 mm) through the skull until the dura is visible (the skull is about 1 mm thick). Retract the dura using micro-dissection forceps or a sterile needle. The dura is tough enough to destroy the tip of the electrode.\nDrill a hole with the dental drill in each frontal squama, and in the interparietal squama opposite to the electrode hole. Disconnect the probe holder from the stereotaxic instrument. Do not drill on a skull suture as venous vessels follow the sutures under the skull.\nScrew a bone screw into each of the five holes. Avoid threading the screws in too deep. For stainless-steel screws (M1.6), 2–3 turns of the screw will adequately hold the screw without putting pressure on the brain. The number of turns will depend on the pitch of the screw. Clamp the probe holder with the electrode in the micromanipulator (Figure 3).\nUsing the AP, ML and DV drive screws, move the probe holder with the electrode until the tip is almost touching the bregma. Note the AP, ML and DV vernier scale readings at the bregma. When the readings are made, raise the electrode a few millimeters to prevent the electrode from scraping the skull during movement. To determine the coordinates of the position where the electrode has to be inserted into the hole, add 3.6 mm to the AP reading and add (or subtract) 2.5 mm to the ML reading.",
    "Using the AP and ML drive screws, move the electrode to the calculated position. At this point, the electrode tip should be situated directly over the drilled electrode hole. Then, by looking through the microscope, lower the electrode to the level of the dura (Figure 4). This level serves as zero-level in the DV direction. Thereafter, gently insert the tip of the electrode into the brain by looking through the microscope.\nConnect the electrode pin to the connector of the recording system. Put a Faraday cage (or substitute it with aluminum foil) over the rat in the stereotaxic instrument (Figure 5). Ground the stereotaxic instrument with the counterpoise of the room that is being worked in.\nStart the recording system. If available, also use a loudspeaker to obtain an acoustic signal of discharges/salves of single units during advancing the electrode.\nSlowly insert the electrode into the brain by recording the electric activity during advancing the electrode. At a depth of between 7.5 and 8.1 mm from the dura, the specific electric activity of the STN is usually detectable (Figure 6). The typical activity of neurons in the STN is characterized by an irregular firing pattern and a high firing rate (mean frequency: 40.9 ± 12.9 Hz)18.\nDuring the recording, reduce anesthesia as much as possible (e.g., to 0.8–1.0%); low-anesthetized animals show a clearer electric brain activity.\nSwab away any blood or cerebrospinal fluid that was displaced at the surface of the skull when lowering the electrode.\nMix up a small amount of dental cement and apply it around the electrode and around four of the five screws using a small spatula (Figure 7). The fifth screw will be used to fix the ground wire of the plug.",
    "Disconnect the electrode pin from the electrode holder and connector of the recording system when the dental cement is fixed.\nUnscrew the screw that was not fixed by dental cement. Put the plug on the electrode pin. Fix the ground wire of the plug with the fifth screw (Figure 8).\nMix up dental cement and apply it around the plug. As the cement thickens, mold it around the plug to form a cap. Avoid sharp edges of the dental cement that may harm the animal and remove them during hardening (Figure 9A and B).\nDebride wound edges and close them with a suture at the front and behind the cap. Disinfect the wound edges.\nConnect the head plug to the wire that is fixed on a swivel. Remove the rat from the stereotaxic instrument.\nApply tramadol (12.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the end of the intervention and then once daily for 2-3 days. Place the rat in a clean cage with thermal support, fix the swivel on this cage (Figure 10) and inspect it carefully for 1 hr.\nDo not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\n3. Stimulation\nDetermine the resistance in the animal before stimulation using an impedance meter.\nConnect the plug of the swivel with a wire and the plugs at the other end of the wire with the current output and the output for the ground wire of the stimulator. Connect the stimulator with a computer in order to program the stimulator.",
    "Choose the parameters of stimulation in the program; for example, the parameters used in Parkinson’s disease are pulse length: 60 μsec; frequency: 130 Hz. Stimulate the rat with an increasing current amplitude until dyskinesia are recognized. Reduce the electric intensity by 10–20% below the intensity that elicited dyskinesia or until neurologic signs disappear and the animal is comfortable. Monophasic rectangular pulses were used in this study.\nAfter completing the experiment, euthanize the animal with isoflurane: Adjust the isofurane flow rate or concentration to 5% or greater. Continue isoflurane exposure until 1 min after breathing stops.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
