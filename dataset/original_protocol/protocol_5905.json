    "In the protocol below we describe luciferase imaging to measure the metastatic spread of OVCAR-5 cells after the establishment of primary tumors following subcutaneous injection in immunocompromised mice. However, other cell types are equally amenable to this approach, and we have used this protocol to track OVCAR-8 cells for metastatic spread and monitor the persistence and survival of pericytes in vivo, when co-injected with OVCAR cells (Sinha et al., 2016).Lentiviral vectorAll work with lentiviruses was performed with due regard to biosafety concerns in line with guidelines set down by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator of the Government of Australia and with Institutional approval (#09/2006). The replication defective 3rd generation lentiviral vector pFUGW-Pol2-ffLuc2-eGFP (Addgene plasmid #71394) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jellyfish Aequorea victoria and the firefly luciferase gene (Day et al., 2009) is used to transduce OVCAR-5 cells in this protocol, by co-transfection of the HIV-1 packaging vector and VSV-G envelope glycoprotein (Sinha et al., 2016).Lentiviral productionThe packaging cell line HEK293T is used to produce lentivirus for transduction of OVCAR-5 cells (Sinha et al., 2016). Briefly, HEK293T cells are plated at 2 x 105 cells per 60 mm plate in 3 ml DMEM containing 10% FCS, and allowed to adhere and grow overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% (v/v) CO2. HEK293T cells are then transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at a FuGENE (μl): pFUGW-Pol2-ffLuc2-eGFP plasmid DNA (μg) ratio of 3:1 as follows:Add an appropriate volume of FuGENE 6 to serum free media and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Determine the concentration of plasmid DNA using 260 nm absorption; then add it to the FuGENE/media mix at the appropriate concentration, and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Add the FuGENE/DNA/media mixture dropwise to the plated cells at 100 μl per 60 mm plate. Incubate the plate for 24-48 h at 37 °C. Collect viral supernatant from HEK293 cells, place it in a sterile tube and concentrate by spinning at 1,000 x g at 25 °C for 90 min in an ultracentrifuge using an SW28 rotor; aspirating the media and resuspending the viral pellet in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 media.Lentiviral transductionOne day prior to infection, plate OVCAR-5 cells into 6-well plates at 1 x 105 cells per well in RPMI-1640 (Sinha et al., 2016).For each well of OVCAR-5 cells to be transduced, add 2.5 μl of 10 mg/ml polybrene to 2 ml of media, and add to 500 μl of viral supernatant. This is the infection cocktail. Overlay OVCAR-5 cells with infection cocktail for 12 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, aspirate virus-containing medium and replace with fresh medium.Assess transduction efficiency of OVCAR-5 cells using fluorescence microscopy, as judged by the number of GFP positive cells. Propagate transduced cells and expand in culture for up to two passages monitoring GFP transduction efficiency by fluorescence microscopy, prior to sorting for enrichment for GFP-positive cells. To sort, trypsinize cells and resuspend in blocking buffer (2% [v/v] FCS and 2% BSA in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing DAPI at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Viable (DAPI negative) GFP+ cells are sorted and collected on a BD FACS DivaTM sorter and expanded prior to use in luciferase imaging experiments. Lentiviral transduction efficiencies are extremely high and transduction efficiencies of 85-90% were routinely achieved in our laboratory even with primary cells such as pericytes. GFP-luciferase+ OVCAR-5 cell culture and preparation for injection into miceCulture GFP-luciferase+ OVCAR-5 cells to 80-90% confluency.Aspirate culture media using sterile Pasteur pipette.",
    "Wash cell monolayer with a small volume of pre-warmed PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.Add an appropriate volume of 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C and incubate for 1-2 min.Tap plate gently to dislodge adherent cells.Quench trypsin activity with an equal volume of media containing FCS.Transfer cell suspension to centrifuge tube and spin at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant.Perform cell count using trypan blue stain and hemocytometer.Resuspend 8 x 105-8 x 106 cells in 100 μl of a PBS/MatrigelTM (5 μg/ml) mixture per mouse on ice.Animal preparationInject immunocompromised mice with 100 μl cell suspension subcutaneously under the front flank using a Hamilton® syringe with a 26 G needle. (See video clip of procedure at https://youtube.com/watch?v=nrOTzLiWC8U[href=https://youtube.com/watch?v=nrOTzLiWC8U])Keep mice under daily observation after injection to ensure full recovery, looking for signs of stress.Monitor tumor volume by taking metric measurements using electronic calipers.Note: OVCAR-5 tumors were monitored every alternate day. Modify protocol depending on the tumor growth rate of cell lines in use.Luciferase ImagingInject mice subcutaneously on the non-tumor bearing flank with 150 μg per gram of body weight in 100 μl sterile PBS of D-luciferin, the substrate for the luciferase enzyme.Note: Acquire imaging within 10-12 min of injecting with D-Luciferin. Allow mice free movement for 6-8 min.Anesthetize mice with 2.5% Forthane (commercial isoflurane anesthetic) in oxygen.Note: Take care not to anesthetize for longer than 3 min. Place anesthetized mice to inhalation cones in induction chamber of Xenogen Real-Time Imaging System on the heated platform.Close chamber door securely.Acquire images at the same exposure length and time interval for all experimental groups within 10-12 min of luciferin injection prior to signal decay.End pointRepeat above luciferase imaging (Steps F1-F6) every 7 days to continue to track metastatic spread.",
    "At the experimental end point, the luminescent signal from large primary tumors is saturated and can block the signal from the smaller metastatic nodules. In order to overcome this, inject mice with D-luciferin and allow free movement for 6-8 min, euthanize the animals and surgically excise the primary tumors. Open the peritoneal cavity surgically, remove skin tissue over the anatomical sites to be imaged and proceed with BLI, adjusting exposure length to ensure signals from smaller metastatic nodules are captured. Note: All experiments were performed in compliance with Institutional ethics committee guidelines which stipulate that animals should not be subjected to undue distress–experimental animals were monitored daily for signs of distress and were sacrificed when tumors reached a volume of 1,500 mm3 (where tumor volume = [width]2 x length x 0.5) even if this occurs before the planned end point of the experiment. No experiments were taken beyond Day 35 after injection."
