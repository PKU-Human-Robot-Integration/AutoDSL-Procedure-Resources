    "All experimental protocols and animal procedures complied with the ethical principle guidelines of the National Research Council.\n1. Preparation of materials\nSterilize all instruments and ddH2O using an autoclave before performing the experiment. Instruments include but are not limited to surgical scissors, ophthalmic scissors, forceps, spoons nucleus divider, glass dishes (60–100 mm in diameter), and glass breakers.\nPrepare the Krebs solution as follows (Table 1): Dissolve all the chemicals together with ddH2O prior to use. Dissolve CaCI2 separately and add slowly into the mixed solution while stirring to avoid sediment.\nPrepare the Rinse media, which consists of F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (100x). Add 5 mL of FBS and 0.5 mL of antibiotic/antimycotic to 44.5 mL of F12 media.\nPrepare neuron media A, which comprises neurobasal A media with 2% B-27, 1% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (100x), and 0.1% glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Add 200 µL of B-27, 100 µL of FBS, 100 µL of L-glutamine, 100 µL of antibiotic/antimycotic (100x), and 10 µL of GDNF (10 µg/mL) to 9.5 mL of neurobasal A media.\n\tNOTE: Prepare neuron media A within one week of usage to ensure freshness of B-27, L-glutamine and GDNF.\nPrepare neuron media B using the same procedure as the preparation of neuron media A but without adding FBS.\nPrepare digestion solution 1 by dissolving 20 mg of collagenase type II, 6 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 200 µL of antibiotic/antimycotic (100x) in 10 mL of oxygen-stable Krebs solution.\nPrepare digestion solution 2 by diluting 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin with 4 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution.\nPrepare a plate with coated coverslips.\n\t\nUse forceps in a laminar flow bench when placing glass coverslips into a 48-well culture plate.",
    "Dilute poly-D-lysine with ddH2O to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL as poly-D-lysine stock. Store the stock at –20 °C, and thaw before use.\nAdd 40 µL of poly-D-lysine stock on top of each coverslip, and incubate the solution at room temperature for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: For different plates with different basal areas, adjust the concentration to 4 µg/cm2. For example, if the basal area of one well from a 24-well plate is 2 cm2, then we should transfer 80 µL of poly-D-lysine stock in a well. Each cm2 would contain 4 µg of poly-D-lysine.\nRemove poly-D-lysine in the 48-well plate, and rinse coverslips with ddH2O thrice.\nDry the plate in a laminar flow hood for at least 30 min to ensure that the plate is anhydrous.\nStore the plate at 4 °C before laminin coating for 1 day at most. Storing the plate at −20 °C is preferable for long-term storage.\nThaw laminin at 4 °C. Dilute laminin with ddH2O to a concentration of 50 µg/mL as laminin stock. Store the stock at –20 °C, and thaw at 4 °C before use.\nUse a pipette to transfer 100 µL of diluted laminin to the top of each coverslip and incubate laminin at 4 °C for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: For different plates with different basal areas, adjust the concentration to 5 µg/cm2. For example, if the basal area of one well from a 24-well plate is 2 cm2, then transfer 200 µL of diluted laminin in a well. Each cm2 would contain 5 µg of laminin.\nRemove the laminin solution, and rinse coverslips with ddH2O once. Perform this operation on the edge of the coverslip to avoid scraping.\n\t\tNOTE: Coated coverslips could be stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks at most.\n2. Bladder harvest\nObtain five-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats.",
    "Infuse carbogen (95% oxygen, 5% CO2) into the Krebs solution for at least 30 min in an ice bath to reach a stable oxygen status and pH level.\nAfter euthanasia via cervical dislocation, soak the rats in 75% ethanol for 30 s for sterilization.\nPlace rats on a sterilized surgical towel and expose their abdomen. Open the abdominal cavity, and reveal the bladder with a set of scissors and forceps.\nLift the bladder gently and cut the bladder from the bladder neck with another set of scissors and forceps to avoid cross-contamination. Place the bladder rapidly in cold oxygen-stable Krebs solution to improve cell survival.\n\tNOTE: Once the bladder is removed, perform the following operations rapidly to improve the prospect of neuron survival.\nAdd Krebs solution into three glass dishes and glass breakers.\nPrepare glass dishes and glass breakers with Krebs solution in an ice bath for precooling.\nMark these containers with numbers 1–3 correspondingly to prevent confusion.\nPair each glass dish with forceps and a spoons nucleus divider.\nIn glass dish 1, cut open the bladder with ophthalmic scissors, and unfold it with forceps and a spoons nucleus divider.\nRinse the bladder in glass breaker 1, and place it in glass dish 2.\nEliminate adherent fat on the tissue surface using the forceps and ophthalmic scissors in glass dish 2.\nRinse the bladder in glass breaker 2, and place it in glass dish 3.\nGently scrape the bladder using the forceps and the spoons nucleus divider onto glass dish 3 to remove exogenous attachments.\nRinse the bladder in glass breaker 3, transfer the bladder to a 15 mL centrifuge tube with 14 mL of cold Krebs solution, and spin the sample for 1 min at 356 x g and 4 °C.",
    "Repeat the previous step twice in two other tubes with Krebs solution to reduce contamination.\n3. Two-step bladder digestion\nTransfer the bladder from the centrifuge tube to a 2 mL vial containing 1 mL of digestion solution 1. Use ophthalmic scissors to cut the bladder into small pieces (smaller than 1 mm) in solution.\nMix the bladder solution with 9 mL of digestion solution 1 in a sterile cell culture dish (100 mm in diameter). Perform step 1 digestion in a shaking incubator for 1 h under 5% CO2, 37 °C, and 200 rpm.\nAfter step 1 digestion, centrifuge the solution at 356 x g at 4 °C for 8 min.\nPlace digestion solution 2 in a 37 °C water bath for preheating.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the supernatant that contains digestion solution 1, and harvest the cell sediment. Some remaining liquid is allowed. Complete removal of the solution may promote cell loss.\nMix cell sediment with warm digestion solution 2 in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and shake the mixture while digesting in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. Do not exceed 7 min of step 2 digestion or neurons will perish.\nAfter digestion, immediately deactivate trypsin in the mixture with 10 mL of cold rinse media.\n\tNOTE: Perform the following steps at 0 °C–4 °C. An ice bath could provide such condition.\nHarvest the cell sediment after centrifugation at 356 x g at 4 °C for 8 min. Remove as much media as possible because the remaining trypsin is harmful to cell growth.\nResuspend sediment with 3 mL of neuron media gently. Ensure that air bubbles are not generated in the solution containing cells for a high survival rate.\nFilter the mixture media through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Keep the filtrate on a shaker at 30 rpm in an ice bath for 30 min. This step is not necessary but recommended.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 356 x g at 4 °C for 8 min, and gently resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL of neuron media A.\nAdd 500 µL of cell mixture into each well of the prepared 48-well plate.\nCulture cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nReplace all the media with neuron media B in 1 h to provide a serum-free culture.\nChange half of the neuron media B every 3 days.\n\tNOTE: Neurons are ready for immunocytochemical experiments after 5–7 days of culture.\nSubscription Required.
