    "Preparation of whole-cell extracts for ChIP analysis (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614195828_4571.jpgFigure 1. Flowchart showing steps in the ChIP experiment. Transcriptional factor (TF), Antibody (AB).Start a 50-ml preculture of Synechocystis cells at 0.5 µg Chl/ml from a fresh plate (less than 2 weeks old) in liquid BG110C-NH4 medium at 30 °C under constant illumination (45 µmol photons/m2 sec) on a rotatory shaker.Using the preculture (2-3 µg Chl/ml) inoculate a 2 L flask with 500 ml of BG110C-NH4 and continue its incubation under the same conditions until cells reach a chlorophyll concentration of 3-4 µg/ml.Split the culture between two autoclaved centrifuge bottles, each containing 250 ml of the original culture for ammonium (NH4+) and nitrogen depletion (-N) treatments. Spin down the cells at 5,000 x g at room temperature for 5 min and discard the supernatants. Wash the pellets twice with 250 ml of BG110C-NH4+ for NH4+, and BG110C for -N treatments. Resuspend the pellets in 250 ml of the corresponding media and transfer the cultures to two 1 L flasks. The cultures were grown as above for 4 h.Add 6.75 ml of 37% formaldehyde to both cultures (NH4+ and -N) to reach a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde (for cross-linking). Incubate for 15 min at room temperature with occasional gentle shaking.Stop the cross-linking reaction by adding 12.5 ml of 2.5 M glycine to obtain a final concentration of 125 mM and incubate at room temperature for 5 min with occasional gentle shaking.Pass the cultures to two autoclaved centrifuge bottles and spin down the cells at 4 °C for 5 min at 5,000 x g. Discard the supernatant (containing formaldehyde) into a suitable waste container. Wash the pellet twice with 10 ml of cold TBS buffer.Spin down samples at 4 °C for 5 min at 5,000 x g and discard the supernatant.",
    "For each centrifuge bottle, resuspend the cell pellets in 2 ml of cold TBS buffer and distribute the suspension into two screw-cap tubes of 2 ml. Finally, spin down samples again and remove the remaining supernatant with a micropipette. You should have two screw-cap tubes for each treatment (NH4+ and -N)Optional: cell pellets can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at this point and stored at -80 °C.Cell LysisNote: If tubes with cross-linked cells were stored at -80 °C, it is important to thaw the cell pellets on ice before continuing. Put the tubes containing cell pellets on ice and resuspend the cells in 500 µl of Lysis buffer (pre-cooled at 4 °C).Add 0.5 g of acid-washed glass beads and break cells using 10 bead-beating cycles of 1 min in a FastPrep-24, with 1 min on ice between cycles.Spin the tubes at 4,000 x g for 2 min and, carefully collect 90% of the supernatant (lysate) using a micropipette. Mix all collected lysate (approx. 2.7 ml) and divide it into 2 tubes of 2 ml (approx. 1.35 ml per tube). Note: To avoid contamination of the samples with unbroken cells and glass beads, leave behind 10% of the supernatant.Sonicate the lysate, 15 cycles (10 sec at 10% amplitude, with 40 sec on ice between cycles) to fragment chromosomal DNA into sequences of sizes between 200 and 400 bp. Note: This step is critical to retrieve good quality DNA fragments. Duration of sonication and signal amplitude must be adjusted for each apparatus to avoid low or excessive DNA shearing. To optimize this step, we recommend replicating our settings to shear freshly extracted genomic DNA (to avoid wasting valuable sample).",
    "Then, load part of the sheared DNA (5-20 µl) on an agarose gel and check whether the DNA fragments are concentrated around 400 bp. Adjust the number of cycles and intensity to compensate for excessive or insufficient shearing. If fragments are mainly > 400 bp, then incrementally increase either amplitude or cycle number, while if they are around < 150 bp, then reduce the number of cycles used.Centrifuge the sonicated samples at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min to eliminate cell debris and transfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5 ml microtube.To check the length distribution of DNA fragments after shearing, load 20 µl of your sonicated samples in a 1% agarose gel. Your sheared DNA must be concentrated around 200-400 bp.Collect 10-20 µl to measure protein concentration of the whole-cell extract, using the Bradford protein assay. Whole-cell extracts can be either stored at -20 °C or immediately used for immunoprecipitation.Prepare magnetic beads for chromatin immunoprecipitationPrepare 20 µl of Protein G magnetic beads per reaction in 1.5 ml tubes (minimum of 2 tubes: one with beads for the immunoprecipitated (IP) sample, and another with beads for the first wash step).Add 480 µl of Blocking buffer to each tube to reach a final volume of 500 µl.Wash the beads with 500 µl of blocking solution (always use fresh solution) by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 1 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat the wash twice. Resuspend the beads in 20 µl of Lysis buffer.Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reversion of cross-linkingPrepare 500 µl of whole-cell extract with a concentration of 4 mg/ml of total protein in Lysis buffer. Transfer 50 µl of the supernatant to a 1.5 ml tube and store at -20 °C. This is the 10% total Input DNA (Figure 1) sample for each ChIP sample.",
    "Note: Input DNA sample control contains cross-linked and sonicated DNA that will not be immunoprecipitated. Input DNA is a very important control in ChIP-seq experiments because it will be used to normalize the signal from ChIP enrichment. It also helps to control for biases in the experimental method by comparing read count enrichment between ChIP and input samples.Pre-treat cell extracts with 20 µl of magnetic beads washed to reduce unspecific binding of DNA or proteins to magnetic beads. Incubate for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation.Collect the beads with the DynaMagTM magnetic stand and pass the supernatant (500 µl) to a clean 1.5 ml tube. Add 2-5 µg of antibody to IP samples (depending on the antibody; for commercial antibodies refer to the manufacture’s ChIP-seq protocols).Incubate IP samples at 4 °C with rotation overnight (at least 16 h).Add 20 µl of pre-washed magnetic beads to each IP sample and incubate for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation.After incubation, discard the supernatant carefully using the DynaMagTM magnetic stand and wash the magnetic beads twice with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer with 5 min rotation at room temperature. Repeat washing step using Wash buffer 1, Wash buffer 2, and TE buffer.Resuspend the magnetic beads in 100 µl of TE buffer containing 20 µg of DNAse-free RNase A, incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Wash the beads with 1.5 ml of TE buffer.To elute the immunoprecipitated material, resuspend the magnetic beads in 100 µl of Elution buffer and incubate at 65 °C for 30 min with occasional vortex rotation (gently, under medium speed).Repeat the elution step and combine the two eluates.Thaw the input sample on ice. Add 20 µl of 5x elution buffer plus 30 µl of MilliQ water to reach the same buffer concentration as the eluted sample.",
    "To reverse the cross-linking, incubate the ChIP samples (Antibody-IP and Input) at 65 °C for 5 h.DNA purificationAdd 100 µl of MilliQ water to the input sample (to reach 200 µl of volume, as for the IP samples). Add 2 µl of proteinase K to a final concentration of 0.4 µg/µl to all ChIP samples and incubate at 37 °C for 1.5 h.Extract DNA with 200 µl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) by vortexing for 1 min and centrifuging at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer the upper phase from each extraction to a clean 1.5 ml tube.Repeat extractions twice with 200 µl chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Add 53 µl of 7.5 M NH4AcO and 2 volumes (500 µl) of freezer-cold ethanol. Incubate for at least 2 h at -20 °C (best results are achieved, when stored overnight).Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and wash twice with 1,000 µl of freezer-cold 70% ethanol. Air-dry the samples and resuspend the pellet in a convenient volume of nuclease-free MilliQ water (25-50 µl).Measure the quantity and quality of the ChIP DNA samples using the Quibit® 2.0 and the Quibit dsDNA assay kit following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.To check whether enrichment of the potential or well-known TF binding regions was achieved during the immunoprecipitation, DNA of specific genomic regions can be amplified by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). To carry out this assessment, add 2.5 pg of IP and Input DNA samples to a 0.5 ml tube per genomic region (locus to study) and perform qRT-PCR using a CFX connect RT-PCR machine and ssoFast EvaGreen Supermix kit.Note: This step is optional.",
    "If information about well-known targets of the TF analyzed is available, then we encourage researchers to analyze the IP DNA by qRT-PCR prior to library construction. In our study, two well-known NtcA binding promoters (glnA and glnB) were analyzed (Giner-Lamia et al., 2017).Use a minimum of 10 ng of IP and Input DNA samples for library preparation, using the Illumina TruSeq ChIP-seq DNA sample preparation kit v.2, as recommended in the kit manual.Note: If the yield of IP DNA recovered was low, then the resulting IP DNA samples from different experiments can be pooled using a DNA purification column (miniElute kit, QIAGEN) to obtain > 10 ng IP DNA samples."
