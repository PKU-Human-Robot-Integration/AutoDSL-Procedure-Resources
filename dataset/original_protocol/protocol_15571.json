    "All the mice were obtained commercially and maintained in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (light on at 08:00 A.M. local time) at a room temperature of 22-25 °C and a relative humidity of 50%-60%. The mice had access to a continuous supply of food and water. All the experiments were carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of South China Normal University and approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Male C57BL/6J mice aged 3-5 months old were used for the experiments.\n1. Micro-drive system assembly\nConnect two computer-designed boards using two stulls and a screw that holds the movable micro-drive and attach the connector to one board (Figure 1A, Bi-iii). Drive the micro-drive by twisting a screw (0.5 mm/circle).\nEnsure the micro-drive can carry two sets of eight guide tubes (~3 cm long, ~50 µm internal diameter, ~125 µm external diameter) for each side of the MC region, and then cut it to the same length (at least 15 mm; Figure 1Biv, v).\nCut 16 Ni-chrome wires (~5 cm long) with a 35 µm diameter, and then load them successively into the guide tubes, followed by applying the glue to fix them (Figure 1Bi, vi, vii).\nStrip the wire insulation, successively twine each exposed wire to each pin from the connector following the channel map, as well as the reference and ground electrodes, and then slowly coat conducting paint onto each pin (Figure 1Bviii-x).\nCover the pins using epoxy resin (Figure 1Axi, xii), and then perform gold plating via an impedance tester to reduce the impedance of the electrode tips to ~350 kOhm (Figure 1Bxiii, xiv). Set the parameters of the impedance tester as follows: −10.08 µA direct current for 1 s with gold plating solution, including 5 mM PtCl4.",
    "Finally, move the micro-drive to the top by twisting a screw. Check the overall size of the micro-drive system modified as shown in Figure 1A (approximately 15 mm long, 10 mm width, 20 mm height, ~1 g weight). Check the detailed specifications of the computer-designed board and movable component in Figure 1Ai, ii.\n2. Electrode array implantation\nSterilize the surgery kits, wear sterile gloves and put on a doctor's sterile white coat before the operation starts.\nTo manage the pain, use subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of meloxicam injectable (5 mg/kg) for the mouse in an induction chamber. Then anesthetize the mouse by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of pentobarbital (80 mg/kg) in an induction chamber18,19. Apply a supplemental dose of pentobarbital (20 mg/kg/h) if the toe pinch reflex is still present.\nFix the mouse in a stereotaxic apparatus and maintain its rectal temperature at 37 °C by using a temperature controller.\nApply tetracycline eye ointment to both eyes of the mouse and change sterile gloves again before surgery.\nShave the mouse's fur and disinfect the surgical site with three alternating rounds of betadine scrub and alcohol using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator in concentric circles starting at the center and moving outward (Figure 2i, ii). Make a small midline incision (~15 mm) to expose its skull. Immediately, apply the 1% lidocaine locally to the neck muscles for pain relief. Then, remove the residual tissue using scissors, and clean the skull using saline-coated cotton buds (Figure 2iii).\nUsing a glass microelectrode filled with ink, mark the desired locations of the bilateral MC for implantation (Figure 2iv, v). Based on a previous study20, the locations of the bilateral MC are as follows: 0.74 mm anterior to the bregma, and 1.25 mm lateral to the midline.",
    "Implant four stainless steel screws (0.8 mm diameter) to protect the micro-drive system, and then link all the screws together with the reference and ground electrodes, followed by covering with mixed dental cement to form walls (Figure 2vi-xi).\nCarefully drill two small holes (~1.5 mm2) with a skull drill on both the left and right sides of the coordinated skull in the MC regions (Figure 2xii). Use the stereotaxic coordinates of the bilateral MC: 0.74 mm anterior to the bregma, 1.25 mm lateral to the midline, and 0.5 mm ventral to the dura.\nRemove the dura mater from the holes carefully with fine forceps (Figure 2xiii).\nInsert the micro-drive system into the center of the holes using a micromanipulator at 10 µm/s (Figure 2xiv-xvii).\nFill the petroleum jelly into the dental cement walls after finishing the insertion of the micro-drive system (Figure 2xviii).\nJoin the bottom plate of the micro-drive system and the dental cement walls with the mixed dental cement (Figure 2xix)\nWash the incision with saline followed by local treatment with a gel containing lincomycin hydrochloride and lidocaine hydrochloride to relieve post-surgical pain.\nWind the conductive copper foil tape around the implanted micro-drive system (Figure 2xx).\nMove the mouse into a cage kept at 31-33 °C and monitor the mouse for recovery from the anesthesia.\nAllow the mice to recover for 1 week with separate feeding. Check and treat the incision with 3 days of continuous application of a gel containing lincomycin hydrochloride and lidocaine hydrochloride.\n3. Multichannel recording in the bilateral MC in free-moving mice\nHold the head of an awake mouse lightly and carefully. Move down the electrode arrays (~0.1 mm depth) by twisting the screw on the movable part of the micro-drive system (Figure 1Aii) at least 1 day in advance.",
    "Hold the head of the awake mouse lightly and carefully. Link the center of the headstage and a helium balloon (filled with approximately 0.02 L of helium) with a thread to offset the weight of the headstage and the micro-drive system (Figure 3A, B).\nCapture raw signals using the recording electrodes and multichannel systems by sampling at 30 kHz in the recording software, and then digitize using a digital-analog (DA) converter from the multichannel systems.\nExtract the LFP signals from the raw data by resampling at 10 kHz in the recording software, and then use a notch filter from the recording software to remove the 50 Hz line noise.\nRecord raw data in a stable state from a free-moving mouse for at least 60 s. After finishing the recording, slowly remove the connection between the headstage and the micro-drive system and return the mouse back to its home cage.\nStore the recorded data in the computer and analyze it offline (Figure 4 and Figure 5).\nAfter finishing the experiment, perform euthanasia as per the institute's guidelines and then confirm the locations of the electrodes by using the power supply at 3 V output to perform a 1 min electrolytic lesion, followed by performing histological analysis. Cut the mouse's brain into 30 µm slices using a freezing microtome, collect the MC sections, and then capture the images with a microscope (Figure 3C, D).\n4.
