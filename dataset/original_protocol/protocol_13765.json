  "procedures": [
    "The following protocol was approved by the local medical ethics committee at the Radboudumc hospital, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The following steps should be followed when performing continuous thermodilution to calculate absolute flow and resistance.\n1. Preparations\nWithhold vasoactive medications for at least 24 hours (48 hours in case of calcium channel blockers).\n2. Diagnostic Coronary Angiography\nInject local anesthesia (1 to 2 mL of 20 mg/mL lidocaine) either in proximity to the right radial artery or the left radial artery. In case radial access is not possible, inject local anesthesia either in proximity to the right femoral artery (usually 10 mL of lidocaine) or the left femoral artery.\nConfirm local anesthesia by pricking the anesthetized-skin with the needle and check whether pain is still present.\nPuncture the radial or femoral artery with a cannula, insert the wire through the cannula and remove it. Insert a 6 Fr sheath over the wire. Make sure to perform this under sterile conditions.\nAdminister heparin according to local protocol (patient weight-adjusted 100 international units per kilogram, minimum of 5000 international units, maximum of 10.000 international units).\nAdvance the wire through the sheath to the ascending aorta and place the diagnostic catheter above the aortic valve. Then remove the wire and connect the catheter with the contrast syringe.\nEngage the right coronary artery with a diagnostic catheter. After intracoronary administration of 0.2 mg of nitroglycerin, perform coronary angiography with manual injections of contrast agent.\nEngage the left coronary artery with a guiding catheter (to avoid switching from diagnostic to guiding afterwards). After intracoronary administration of 0.2 mg of nitroglycerin, perform coronary angiography with manual injections of a contrast agent. Use a 6 Fr size guiding catheter or larger to facilitate the dedicated monorail catheter (step 4).",
    "Exclude the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease: any relevant epicardial stenosis by visual assessment, and intracoronary physiological assessment in case of an intermediate epicardial stenosis (40-90% angiographic stenosis) 9.\n3. Set up of continuous thermodilution measurements\nEnsure that all coronary pressure tracings and temperatures are wirelessly transmitted and analyzed by a dedicated console equipped with software that automatically calculates Q and R.\nPrepare a contrast injector with pressure-limit containing 100 to 150 mL of saline at room temperature.\n4. Continuous thermodilution measurements\nManually flush a guidewire with pressure and temperature sensors (further referred to as the \"pressure wire\") using syringes with saline.\nMake sure the pressure wire is connected to the appropriate software (so that pressure/temperature are visualized real-time) and pass the pressure wire through the guiding catheter. Ensure that the proximal part of the radiopaque section of the pressure wire is placed in the ostium of the coronary artery using angiography.\nEqualize the pressure wire to the aortic pressure. It is essential that this step is completed before any measurements are initiated.\nAdvance the pressure wire to the distal 1/3 of the coronary artery of interest.\nConnect a dedicated monorail catheter to the contrast injector.\nFlush the monorail catheter with saline using the automated contrast injector set at 10 mL/min to remove air from the monorail catheter. When saline exits the infusion holes at the tip of the monorail catheter, advance the monorail catheter through the guiding catheter while flushing.\nWhen the monorail catheter passes the hemostatic connector, stop flushing and advance the monorail catheter further into the guiding catheter.\nPlace the radiopaque marker of the monorail catheter in the proximal part (first centimeter) of the coronary artery of interest.",
    "NOTE: Make sure there is at least 3 cm distance between the radiopaque marker of the proximally placed monorail catheter and the radiopaque marker of the distally placed guidewire to ensure optimal mixing of blood and saline 10,11.\nOn the dedicated software, select the Absolute flow program, select the coronary artery of interest, and set the temperature to zero (reference temperature comparable to 37 Â°C in humans).\nSelect the appropriate infusion rate of (room-temperature) saline (Qi) on the infusion pump and make sure the program settings are updated accordingly.\n\tNOTE: Qi is usually 20 mL/min for the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX) and 15 mL/min for the right coronary artery (RCA). Do not start the infusion yet.\nStart the absolute flow measurement on the dedicated software program. Do not stop the measurement until step 4.16. Ensure several seconds are measured before the infusion of saline is initiated.\nStart the infusion of saline at the infusion pump at the selected flow rate (Qi). Do not stop infusion until step 4.15.\n\tNOTE: After the start of the infusion with saline, the temperature in the distal coronary artery will decrease.\nEnsure that a steady state distal temperature of the blood/saline mixture is recorded for at least 10 s.\nPull the guidewire back into the monorail infusion catheter to obtain a proximal temperature (Ti). Ensure that a stable Ti is recorded for approximately 10 s.\nStop the infusion of room temperature saline on the infusion pump.\nEnsure the temperature returns to the zeroed value. After this, stop the absolute flow measurement on the dedicated software program.\n\tNOTE: FFR, absolute Q and R are now automatically calculated by the dedicated software.\nRemove the dedicated monorail catheter.",
    "Ensure that the pressure wire is placed in the ostium of the coronary artery similar to step 4.2 and perform a drift check of the pressure measurement. If drift is more than 2 mmHg, repeat measurements. If there is no drift, remove the pressure wire.\nPerform one or two final angiographies visualizing the coronary artery of interest to check for possible complications (e.g., coronary artery dissection).\n5. Calculation of absolute flow and absolute resistance\nNOTE: As shown in Figure 1, the dedicated monorail infusion catheter allows the infusion of saline only through four outer side holes, resulting in complete and optimal mixing with blood; two inner side holes allow the measurement of temperature by the used guidewire.\nCalculate absolute flow (Q) in mL per minute with the following equation7:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62066/62066eq1.jpg\n\tAs mentioned above, Qi is the saline infusion rate in mL per minute and Ti is the temperature of the infused saline near the dedicated monorail catheter exit. T is the temperature of the homogenous mixture of blood and saline in the distal part of the coronary artery during infusion. The constant 1.08 relates to the difference between the specific temperature and density of blood and saline, and when saline is infused in blood.\nCalculate R, expressed in Wood Units (WU) or mmHg * (L/min), by the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62066/62066eq2.jpg\n\tThere is a readily available advanced platform to measure physiological indices, that communicates with the pressure wire and that allows live calculation of FFR, Q and R (Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
