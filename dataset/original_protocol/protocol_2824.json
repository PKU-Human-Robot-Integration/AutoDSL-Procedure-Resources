    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExamine target protein sequence properties and determine the number of expected phosphorylation sites\nTiming: 1 h\nThe purpose of this step is to identify the number and position of CDK1 sites expected to be phosphorylated in the target protein sequence. The recognition motif for CDK1 is S/TP, where proline is an absolute requirement in the +1 position, and there is a preference for basic residues (lysine or arginine) at the +2 or +3 positions.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nUsing the target protein sequence, identify and record all of the expected CDK1 sites (S/TP).\nNote: For example, the protein sequence for human SLX4MBR, consisting of residues 1528–1613, can be retrieved from the UniProt database[href=https://uniprot.org/] using the primary accession ID: Q8IY92. There are three TP sites located in the SLX4MBR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The target protein in this example (SLX4MBR) was purified from Escherichia coli and lacks phosphorylated residues.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Target proteins purified from other organisms, such as insect or mammalian cells, may include some phosphorylated residues.\nEvaluate the physical and chemical properties of the target protein sequence using Expasy ProtParam[href=https://web.expasy.org/protparam]. Record the parameters described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for the target protein.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2529-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The SLX4MBR amino acid sequence contains three CDK1 recognition motifs\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2529_12.csv\nThe molar and mass extinction coefficients shown below are calculated assuming a 1 cm path length and that all pairs of Cys residues are reduced.\nNote: Protein sequences lacking tryptophan residues, like SLX4MBR, can result in more than 10% error in the computed extinction coefficient.\nAlternatives: If the protein sequence lacks both tryptophan and tyrosine residues, an alternative spectroscopic method for measuring protein concentration can be employed by using the absorbance at 215 nm (A215) and 225 nm (A225) (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nDialysis and protein concentration determination\nTiming: 18–24 h",
    "Prior to dialysis, the target protein (e.g., SLX4MBR) should be purified to >95% purity, with approximately 1 mL at 100–300 μM. The target protein is then dialyzed into a buffer suitable for phosphorylation with CDK1-cyclin B. This step is especially important if the target protein is stored in a phosphate-based buffer, as phosphate can inhibit kinases16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] and may lead to the unwanted formation of insoluble magnesium phosphate salts. Notably, magnesium is an essential component to the phosphorylation reaction, acting as a cofactor to form the ATP:Mg2+ chelate. Before performing dialysis, users should select dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) that is lower than the molecular weight of the target protein. For example, SLX4MBR is approximately 10 kDa, so 3.5 kDa MWCO dialysis tubing is used to retain the target protein within the dialysis tubing. After dialysis, the protein concentration is measured to determine the appropriate concentrations of ATP and CDK1-cyclin B to add for the phosphorylation reaction.\nHydrate the dialysis tubing.\nFill a 400 mL beaker with 300 mL of ddH2O.\nFill one Maxi GeBAFlex (3.5 kDa MWCO) dialysis tube with 3 mL of ddH2O.\nPlace the dialysis tubing in a floating rack and into the 300 mL of ddH2O.\nAllow the dialysis tubing to hydrate for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove and empty the dialysis tubing.\nLoad the dialysis tubing with the target protein sample (e.g., SLX4MBR). Perform the following steps in a cold room:\nPipette 1 mL of SLX4MBR (400 μM or 2.5 mg/mL) into the dialysis tubing.\nPlace the dialysis tube in a floating rack and into 5 L of pre-cooled Protein Dialysis Buffer.\nAdd a clean stir bar to the 5 L of Protein Dialysis Buffer and move to a stir plate.",
    "Add 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 1 mM into the Protein Dialysis Buffer.\nTurn on the stir setting to allow gentle mixing of the dialysis solution.\nAllow dialysis to occur for 18–24 h at 4°C.\nAlternatives: The target protein can be prepared using other buffer exchange methods, such as a centrifugal protein concentrator or using an ÄKTA FPLC instrument equipped with a 5 mL HiTrap Desalting column (Cytiva). Although these methods are more costly than dialysis, one advantage is that they can often be completed in under 1 h.\nAfter dialysis, remove the target protein sample (e.g., SLX4MBR) from the dialysis tubing.\nUse a pipette to remove the SLX4MBR sample from the dialysis tubing and transfer into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nRecord the approximate volume of SLX4MBR removed by pipetting.\nMix the SLX4MBR sample well using a pipette.\nStore the sample on ice.\nNote: Step 5 should be performed in a cold room or cold cabinet.\nDetermine the target protein concentration by absorbance spectroscopy.\nUsing a 10 mL syringe fitted with a 0.2 μm syringe filter, filter 10 mL of Protein Dialysis Buffer into a 15 mL conical tube.\nPerform a blank measurement using the 0.2 μm filtered Protein Dialysis Buffer.\nMeasure the absorbance at 280 nm (   A 280   ) for the dialyzed SLX4MBR.\nUsing the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (   ε 280  m o l a r    ) from Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and the path length (  l  ), calculate the molar concentration:\nm\no\nl\na\nr\nc\no\nn\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nm\no\nl\n/\nL\n=\nA\n280\nε\n280\nm\no\nl\na\nr\n⋅\nl",

Before proceeding with the phosphorylation reaction, consider the number of sites expected to be phosphorylated in the target protein sequence. For example, SLX4MBR contains three consensus sites for CDK1, with phosphorylation expected on T1544, T1561, and T1571 in full-length human SLX4 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Thus, 100 nmol of SLX4MBR will require 300 nmol of ATP to obtain stoichiometric phosphorylation of all three sites. In practice, the ATP concentration should be in molar excess to ensure that the phosphorylation reaction proceeds efficiently and to account for ATP hydrolysis, which decomposes into inorganic pyrophosphate and adenosine 5′-phosphate in alkaline solutions.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]\nCalculate the initial concentration of ATP to add to the phosphorylation reaction mixture, using 5-fold molar excess of ATP:\nA\nT\nP\n=\n5\n⋅\ntarget\np\nr\no\nt\ne\ni\nn\n⋅\nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\no\nf\ne\nx\np\ne\nc\nt\ne\nd\np\nh\no\ns\np\nh\no\nr\ny\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\ni\nt\ne\ns\nCalculate the concentration of CDK1-cyclin B to add to the phosphorylation reaction mixture, using a molar ratio of approximately 1:150 of CDK1-cyclin B to target protein.",

Remove a 10 μL aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2529_13.csv\nAdjust the volumes specified above, depending on the concentration of the target protein, ATP, and CDK1-cyclin B.

Mix thoroughly.\nIncubate at 30°C in a ThermoMixer for 1 h with gentle agitation (500 rpm).\nNote: Aliquots of 10 μL can be removed at different time intervals to monitor reaction progress by 15% SDS-PAGE. Aliquots that are removed should be immediately resuspended in 4× SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer and boiled for 5 min to stop the phosphorylation reaction.\nAlternatives: CDK1-cyclin B has optimal activity at 30°C. However, if the target protein is unstable at 30°C, the phosphorylation reaction can be performed at 4°C for an extended amount of time.\nSupplement the reaction mixture with an additional 1 mM ATP (i.e., an additional 10 μL of 100 mM ATP per 1 mL of sample).\nIncubate at 4°C for 18–24 h in a ThermoMixer with gentle agitation (500 rpm).\nAfter 24 h, monitor the reaction progress using 15% SDS-PAGE (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2529-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Incomplete phosphorylation can be detected as a band that migrates at the same apparent molecular weight as the negative control sample (i.e., SLX4MBR alone). Conversely, the phosphorylated product migrates at a higher apparent molecular weight. A total of 3 μg of each sample was loaded into a 15% SDS-PAGE gel before performing electrophoresis in 1× Tris-Glycine-SDS buffer at room temperature (150 V, 75 min). The SDS-PAGE gel was stained in InstantBlue and de-stained in water.\nNote: If there is still a detectable quantity of non-phosphorylated material (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), repeat steps 8–10 and allow the reaction to continue for an additional 24–48 h. Supplementing additional CDK1-cyclin B may also aid in bringing the reaction to completion.\nAlternatives: If there is poor separation between the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated product(s) on denaturing SDS-PAGE, Phos-tag™ Acrylamide (Wako) may be used to improve resolution (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nPurification and analysis of the phosphorylated protein target\nTiming: 4 h\nAfter in vitro phosphorylation is complete, it is necessary to purify the phosphorylated target away from CDK1-cyclin B and reaction by-products. Size-exclusion chromatography is well-suited for this task, with the added benefits of removing protein aggregates and allowing for exchange into a buffer suitable for downstream analyses. Using a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column, CDK1-cyclin B (91 kDa) and protein aggregates elute in the void volume, while excess ATP and reaction by-products (such as ADP, AMP, and pyrophosphate) elute with the salt front (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). This protocol has been used to reproducibly generate phosphorylated SLX4MBR using initial concentrations from 100 to 300 μM (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2529-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) Phosphorylated SLX4MBR has an elution volume of 12 mL, whereas aggregates and CDK1-cyclinB elute in the void volume (approx. 7–8 mL), and reaction by-products elute in the salt front (approx. 18–22 mL).\n(B) An overlay of four independent preparations of phosphorylated SLX4MBR using varying initial concentrations of SLX4MBR. The negative control (dotted black line) indicates non-phosphorylated SLX4MBR.\nFollowing size-exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE is performed to screen fractions containing the phosphorylated protein, where selected fractions are pooled and concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator. Lastly, the sample needs to be analyzed by mass spectrometry. Intact mass spectrometry can be used to determine phosphorylation stoichiometry, and an SDS-PAGE gel slice can be used for tandem mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylated residues.\nConnect a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column to an ÄKTA Pure FPLC, according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://cdn.cytivalifesciences.com/api/public/content/digi-16308-original].

Remove any bubbles or excess air.\nAttach the 10 mL syringe to the injection port.\nEquilibrate the 500 μL loop using 9 mL of Gel Filtration Buffer.\nCritical: Do not remove the syringe, which contains excess buffer.\nUsing the Method Editor software from Unicorn, create the following method:\nBlock 1: Method Settings.\nUnder Column selection, set the “Column type” to Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL. Use the default pre-column and delta-column pressure limits.\nUnder Column position, select the position where the column is attached.\nUnder Flow rate, set this value to 0.500 mL/min.
