    "Institutional approval from Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the researcher's institution is necessary to carry out the following animal experiments. Additionally, standard animal care facilities (e.g., housing chambers, sterile animal hoods, isofluorane chambers for anesthetization, and CO2 chambers for ethical endpoint euthanization) are necessary to properly carry out these experiments. Special training and assistance with these facilities can be provided by the Physiological Research Laboratory (PRL) at one's institution. All animal work was approved by IACUC at Georgia Tech (protocol: A14100).\n1. Iron Oxide Nanoparticle (IONP) Synthesis\nNOTE: Safety: The entire Iron Oxide Nanoparticle synthesis should be performed using personal protective equipment and underneath a chemical fume hood.\nIn a 15 mL conical tube, chill 1 mL of 30% ammonium hydroxide in an ice bucket for 30 min.\nWash a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with deionized water and add 10 mL double distilled water (ddH2O). Submerge the outside of the flask in an ice bath resting on a stir/heat plate. Use a plastic pipette to flow N2 gas into the ddH2O in the flask. Bubble for 15 minutes with N2 to deoxygenate.\nWeigh 224 µmol (4.5 grams) of dextran (Molecular Weight (MW) = 20 kDa) into a 50 mL conical tube. Add H2O such that the final volume of the mixture, including the dextran, is 20 mL. Vortex vigorously to dissolve the dextran.\nWeigh 290 µmol (78.5 grams) of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate, add to dextran solution and vortex to dissolve.\nFilter the resulting solution through a 0.2 µm filter.\nTransfer 1 mL chilled ammonium hydroxide into 9 mL of the deoxygenated water. Return to 4 °C.\nWeigh 367 µmol (73.0 grams) of iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate, dissolve in 1 mL of oxygen-free ddH2O, and filter through a 0.2 µm filter.",
    "Transfer the dextran-iron(III) solution into the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and deoxygenate with N2 for 15 minutes on ice. Mix with a magnetic stir bar spinning at 1600 rpm.\nTo create a homogenous nitrogen atmosphere, cap the flask with a rubber septum. Puncture the septum with an 18 gauge needle to flow N2 into the flask. Insert a separate 18 gauge needle as a flow outlet.\nAdd 467 µL of the iron(II) solution to the dextran-iron(III) solution with a 1 mL syringe, stirring with a magnetic stir bar at 1600 rpm. This ratio of iron(II) to iron(III) results in a balanced reaction that will produce magnetite, or Fe3O4.\nAdd the chilled dilute ammonium hydroxide dropwise into the Iron(II)-Iron(III)-dextran solution to initiate the nucleation process21. Make sure each droplet mixes well before dropping in another. Finish the reaction after the addition of 1-2 mL of ammonium hydroxide.\nStop the flow of N2 and remove the rubber septum. Remove the ice bath and replace with a bath of warm water, while continuing to stir the solution. Ensure that the temperature of the solution reaches 75 °C and incubate for 75 minutes.\nRemove the flask from the stir/hot plate and doubly filter the solution through 0.2 µm then 0.1 µm filters to remove coarse particles.\nBuffer exchange the particles into ddH2O, using 100 kDa molecular weight cut off (m.w.c.o.) concentrators to remove excess dextran from the solution, which should be very viscous. Replace filters if the flow through remains dark even after 2 - 3 spins, which indicates that the filter may have broken.\n\t\nTo buffer exchange with spin filters, centrifuge at 4 °C at 4800 X g for 15 minutes, discard the flow-through, and add new buffer to the IONP solution. Repeat 3-5 times.",
    "Determine the concentration of the nanoparticles using a spectrophotometer/plate reader. Take absorbance measurements at 400 nm and use the molar absorptivity of IONP at this wavelength (ε = 2.07 x 106 cm-1 M-1) to determine the concentration of IO particles.\nResuspend the IONPs to 10 mg/mL in ddH2O (usually total volume is ~3 mL) and make sure to use polypropylene tubes for this step for chemical compatibility. Add 1.6 volumes of 5 M NaOH, then add 0.65 volumes of epichlorohydrin. Rigorously mix on a plate shaker at room temperature for 12 hours to crosslink dextran.\nUse a 20 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle to transfer the IONP solution into the 50 kDa m.w.c.o. dialysis membrane. Place the dialysis membrane into 4 L ddH2O and replace H2O a few times (every 2 - 3 hours). Incubate overnight.\nMeasure the concentration and bring IONPs to 5 mg/mL (see step 1.15). Add ammonium hydroxide to reach 20% (v/v) and shake at room temperature for > 12 hours to aminate the surface of IONPs. Buffer exchange using 30 kDa m.w.c.o. filters (see 1.14).\nAdjust the volume down to 2.5 - 3.5 mL before final purification by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC; see Table of Materials for gel filtration column).\nUse dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the hydrodynamic radius of IONPs (expected range 10 - 100 nm, average size 40 - 50 nm). Do this by aliquoting 1 mL of 100X diluted IONP sample in a cuvette, place in the machine, and use the manufacturer's software to take the measurement.",
    "NOTE: The total population of IONPs will be between 10 and 100 nm by DLS measurements, but the majority of the population is around the average diameter, which ranges from 40 - 50 nm. If one wants to limit the size range, one can further use size exclusion chromatography to isolate fractions with different diameters. IONPs should be stored at 4 °C.\n2. Peptide Design, Conjugation to IONP, and In Vitro  Validation\nSynthesize a peptide substrate (e.g., by a core facility or commercially) for a target protease with an N-terminal fluorescent reporter such as Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and a C terminal cysteine residue to allow thiol-mediated coupling.\n\tNOTE: In the case of this study for MMP9, the peptide used was FITC-PLGVRGK-C, with kcat/Km ~ 2.0 x 105 M-1s-1.\nAliquot 0.5 mg of IONP (at 1 mg/mL), and buffer exchange into coupling buffer (50 mM Sodium Borate with 1 mM EDTA, pH = 8.5) using a 10 kDa m.w.c.o. spin filter (see step 1.14).\nDissolve Succinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA) in dimethylformamide (DMF) to reach a concentration of ~30 mg/mL, and add SIA to IONP at a mole ratio of 500 SIA:IONP.\n\tNOTE: SIA is a heterobifunctional cross linker that mediates coupling of amines on IONPs to the sulfhydryl groups on the peptide substrate.\nIncubate for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature in the dark. If leaving overnight, incubate at 4 °C.\nBuffer exchange using a 10 kDa m.w.c.o. spin filter into coupling buffer to remove unreacted SIA (see step 1.14).\nBring the final product solution to 1 mg/mL (0.5 mL solution). Mix the peptide of interest at a molar ratio of 90:1 (peptide:IONP) with 20 kDa thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG) at a molar ratio of 20:1 (PEG:IONP). Mix this peptide-PEG solution with IONP.",
    "Incubate overnight at room temperature on a plate shaker on highest speed, covering tubes in foil to prevent photobleaching of fluorescent molecules.\nAdd L-cysteine at a molar ratio of 500:1 (C:IONP) to neutralize any unreacted SIA molecules. Incubate for 1 hour at 25 °C on a shaker at highest speed at room temperature.\nPurify via FPLC (see 1.1.19). Use a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance of the sample solution and calculate the Peptide:IONP ratio according to the following. After purification, store product at 1 mg/mL at 4 °C in PBS.\n\t\nUse a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance of the sample solution at 400 nm (Asample,400) and the wavelength of maximum absorbance for the fluorophore used, which is 488 nm for FITC (Asample,488). Measure the absorbance of a stock amine IONP solution at the same two wavelengths (400 nm and 488 nm), which are respectively represented as ANP,400 and ANP,488.\nUse equations 1 and 2 to calculate the normalized A400 and A488 values.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq1.jpg          Equation 1\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq2.jpg          Equation 2\nA400 and A488 represent the normalized values of the sample. Use these values to calculate the ratio of Peptide:IONP with equation 3.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq3.jpg          Equation 3\nWhere imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq4.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq5.jpg are the molar absorptivities of the IONP and the fluorophore, respectively. For these particles imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq4.jpg = 2.06 x 106 M-1cm-1 and for FITC imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq5.jpg = 72,000 M-1cm-1, so the value of  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq6.jpg should be 28.75. Typical Peptide:IONP ratios should be in the range of 20:1 to 50:1.\nValidate functionality of the probes by performing an in vitro cleavage assay.\n\t\nWith PBS (1% BSA), make an 18 µL nanoparticle solution with a 200 nM concentration of peptide. Mix with 2 µL of protease of interest (MMP9; 0.1 - 1 mg/mL).",
    "Incubate in a plate reader at 37 °C for 1 hour, taking fluorescence measurements (using the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths, which are 485 nm and 528 nm for FITC, respectively) every 1 - 2 minutes to monitor cleavage.\n3. Administration of Nanosensors and Urine Detection of Cancer\nNOTE: For more details on the example model, see our previous report13.\nCreate a metabolic cage for urine collection by securing a cylindrical sleeve to the top of a 96 well plate. During urine collection, place a mouse inside the sleeve and cover with a Petri dish cover to prevent escape of the animal.\nPrepare an injection solution (200 µL maximum volume) containing nanosensors at a concentration of 3000 mg/kg (~50 µmol) by peptide in sterile saline.\nIn female, 8-week old, nude mice bearing xenograft LS174T colorectal tumors at a burden of ~100-300 mm3, which should occur on approximately day 10, administer nanosensor solution via tail vein injection. Immediately after injection, place mice into metabolic cages and note the time of injection for each mouse.\nAt 60 - 90 minutes after injection, remove cylindrical sleeve from 96-well plate. Restrain mouse and apply slight pressure on the bladder to induce mice to void any remaining urine onto the plate. Collect all urine (200 - 500 µL).\nAnalyze urine samples by immunoprecipitation to purify FITC from the urine and increase sensitivity. Use magnetic beads coupled with anti-FITC antibodies.\n\t\nFirst, wash 25 mg of the magnetic beads 3 times with coating buffer, and bring the final volume to 225 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to make the coating buffer (0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.5), blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4), and washing buffer (PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4) fresh each time, and approximately 20 mL of each is necessary.",
    "Add 200 µL of anti-FITC (5 mg/mL) and 200 µL of ammonium sulfate (3 M). Incubate for 16-24 hours at 37 C on a rotator.\nAdd the solution to a magnetic separator, remove the supernatant, replace with 625 imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57937/57937eq7.jpgΛ blocking buffer, and incubate at 37 C overnight. Then wash 3 times with wash buffer and store in 1.25 mL wash buffer.\nIncubate 2 µL of urine with 5 µL of magnetic beads (20 mg/mL) and bring to a total volume to 50 µL with PBS (0.01% Tween 20). Incubate for 60 min.\nWash twice with 50 µL PBS (0.01% Tween 20) using a magnetic separator to collect magnetic beads after each wash.\nElute twice with 32.5 µL of 5% glacial Acetic Acid. Neutralize pooled elution (70 µL) with 35 µL of 2 M Tris to achieve a final pH of ~7.\nRead on a plate reader (see Table of Materials) at appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths to quantify urine fluorescence. Calculate the concentration of fluorescent reporter against a ladder of known concentrations of free fluorophore.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
