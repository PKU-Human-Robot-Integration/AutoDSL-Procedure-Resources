    "Harvest and tissue dissociationAnesthetize mice using isoflurane.Open the abdominal cavity. Using 50 ml syringe, perfuse the liver with 30 ml of perfusing media through the inferior vena cava with a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and cut the portal vein to drain the perfusion media.Remove the liver and weigh it to correlate cell number with liver weight.Scrap the perfused liver with a scalpel; this will help to separate the bile ducts from the rest of the liver parenchyma. Mince the bile duct and left-over liver tissue mass into very small pieces using forceps and a scalpel.Place the minced pieces in 50 ml tubes containing 10 ml of digestion media.Place the 50 ml tubes in the shaker and shake at 280 rpm for 30 min at 37°C.After 30 min of constant shaking, remove the tubes from the shaker and add 5 ml (33%) of heat-inactivated FBS. The addition of FBS deactivates enzymatic activity.Pass the cell suspension through a 100 µm nylon mesh cell strainer into a 50 ml tube.Use a 3 ml syringe plunger to scrape and press tissue pieces through the strainer. Wash the strainer with 35 ml of isolation buffer and make up the volume to 50 ml.Centrifuge at 300 × g for 7 min at 4°C.Wash the cells two times with isolation buffer.Cell isolation by gradient centrifugationMake percoll gradient solutions as shown in Table 1.Table 1. Concentration of percoll gradient solutions used for cell isolation table:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nDensity,Vol. of percoll,PBS,Final vol.\n26.25%,6.3 ml,17.7 ml,24 ml\n41.5%,6.65 ml,9.35 ml,16 ml\n73.3%,8.8 ml,3.2 ml,12 ml",
    "The calculations shown in Table 1 are sufficient for four livers.Place a Pasteur pipet in the 15 ml tube.Resuspend the cells in 6 ml of 26.25% density gradient percoll and add into 15 ml tube with Pasteur pipet.Using a 5 ml pipette, add 4 ml of 41.5% density percoll through the Pasteur pipet and let it flow under the 26.25% gradient layer in the tube. Add 3 ml of 73.3% percoll solution through the Pasteur pipet in the tube. The 73.3% density solution will layer under the 41.5% density solution, as shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4192/bioprotoc-11-20-4192-g002.jpgFigure 2. Overlaying of percoll gradient solution Centrifuge at 796 × g for 30 min at 4°C without breaks.Remove the 15 ml tubes from the centrifuge.Aspirate the upper layer of hepatocytes and collect to 3 ml of interphase containing cholangiocytes; place it in the 50 ml tube.Wash the cells using 50 ml of isolation buffer by centrifuging at 300 × g for 7 min at 4°C. Repeat another time; this will help remove the percoll.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of isolation buffer.Assess the fraction of Epcam positive cells using the Epcam PeCy7 labeled flow antibody on a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer and BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (Figure 3).Count the cells using a hemocytometer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4192/bioprotoc-11-20-4192-g003.jpgFigure 3. Fraction of Epcam+ cholangiocytes isolated with the gradient centrifugation method Purification/enrichment of cholangiocytes using the Dynabead cell isolation kitWash the Dynabeads before proceeding to cell isolation.Add desired volume (based on cell number) of beads to a tube. Wash the Dynabeads using 1 ml of isolation buffer.Place the tube in a magnet for 2 min and discard the supernatant.Remove the 15 ml tube from the magnet and resuspend the beads in the 1 ml of isolation buffer.Use approximately 10 μg of EpCAM G8.",
    "8 primary antibody (rat IgG) per 107 cells, mix well, and incubate at 4°C on a rotator for 20 min.Wash the cells by adding 2 ml of isolation buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 7 min. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in isolation buffer. Add 20 μl of anti-rat IgG Dynabeads to 15 ml tube with cells. Incubate at 4°C on a rotator for 20 min.After incubating with Dynabeads, add 1 ml of isolation buffer, pipet up and down 2-3 times, and place the tube in a magnet for 4 min.For positive isolation, while the tube is still in the magnet, carefully remove and discard the supernatant containing unbound cells. Repeat Step C8 one more time to remove unbound cells; this will increase the purity of isolated cells.Resuspend the cell pellet in isolation buffer and wash the cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 7 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and proceed.Releasing bead-bound cellsResuspend the bead-bound cells in 1 ml of release buffer.Incubate for 15 min with rolling and tilting at room temperature, and then mix by pipetting up and down 10 times, preventing the formation of air bubbles. This will help in efficiently separating the cells from beads.Place the tube in a magnet for 4 min.Transfer the supernatant containing the bead-free cholangiocytes into a new 15 ml tube.Add Isolation buffer to 15 ml and centrifuge at 300 × g for 7 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1ml of cholangiocyte culture media. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.Keep the cells from 2°C to 8°C until further use in downstream applications.Cells isolated from neonatal cholangiocytes are expanded as described below. Note: In addition to the above-discussed method.",
    "Epcam positive cells can be purified using the PE anti-mouse CD326 (Ep-CAM) Antibody and EasySepTM Release Mouse PE Positive Selection Kit. This method can be used after counting cells with a hemocytometer in Procedure B.  Expansion of cholangiocytesMedia: To make a 500 ml stock, add the following reagents in the appropriate concentrations (Table 2).Table 2.

    "Note: The complete media containing ITS, dexamethasone, triiodothyronine, mEGF, and Forskolin is usable for 1 week. Gentamicin (100 µg/ml) is used for cholangiocyte culture. Culturing/PassagingNote: For initial cultures, start with 48-well plates and move to 12-well plate once cells are confluent; then, transfer the cells to T-25 or T-75 flasks depending on requirements. Cell growth is very slow for the first few passages. T-25 flaskTo coat 1 T-25 flask, add 31 µl of collagen (4 mg/ml) + 3 ml of 0.1% acetic acidT-75 flaskTo coat 1 T-75, add 94 µl of collagen (4 mg/ml) + 5 ml of 0.1% acetic acidIncubate for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.Remove coating solution by washing with 5 ml of sterile PBS (when using T-25 flask).Gently rock the flask with PBS; repeat washing three to four times to remove acetic acid.If passaging, dissociate the adhered cells using TrypLE. Prewarm TrypLE to 37°C.Wash cells with 5 ml of DPBS without Ca++ and Mg++. Aspirate and discard.Add an appropriate volume (2 ml in T-25, 2-5 ml in T-75 flask) of TrypLE to flask.Incubate at 37°C for 2 to 4 min until cells detach. Gently tap the flask to dislodge cells if necessary.Wash cells with 13 ml DPBS without Ca++ and Mg++. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge at 300 × g for 7 min 4°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in pre-warmed complete medium. Count the cells and divide them accordingly. After a few passages, cells grow fast; therefore, split the cells based on requirements.Check the purity of cultured cells using Epcam PeCy7 labeled flow antibody on the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4192/bioprotoc-11-20-4192-g004.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Fraction of Epcam+ cholangiocytes from passage 6 Immunoblotting for CK19 and β-actin was performed on purified and in vitro expanded cholangiocytes. Protein was quantified using the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit, and 35 μg of protein per lane was used.For detection of β-actin and CK19, membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibody.On the next day, blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. CK19 was detected using a Bio-Rad ChemiDocTM MP Imaging System using the ECL Substrate.β-actin, used as internal control, was detected with donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Immunoblots were visualized using the Odyssey system (LI-COR) (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4192/bioprotoc-11-20-4192-g005.jpgFigure 5. CK19 expression in cholangiocytes from passage 6 SummaryCholestasis is defined as an impairment in bile formation or flow, while the etiology of cholestasis differs, ranging from genetic mutation to autoimmunity. Bile is the digestive fluid produced in the liver by hepatocytes, and disorders in hepatocytes, biliary ducts/biliary cells, and pancreas can cause cholestasis causing retention of bile salts in the body. Bile acids precipitated during cholestasis mediate biliary injury and further cause obliteration of cholangiocytes, a cellular lining for bile ducts known as the biliary tree. Cholangiocyte damage causes obstruction of bile transport and bile modification. We identified a homozygous, nonsense pathogenic variant in ABCC12 encoding an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter, multidrug resistance-associated protein 9 (MRP9) in a patient. These patients elicit bile duct paucity while showing lesser GGT levels. Expression of MRP9 transporters was restricted to cholangiocytes in the liver. So far, the role of this transporter has not been discussed in the liver. Therefore, we aimed to explore the role of ABCC12 and its biological function using primary cholangiocytes isolated from neonates and adult mice. Biliary epithelial cells were isolated from 2-day-old pups and from adult mice.",
    "In adult mice, the liver was perfused with DMEM+F12 media containing collagenase D. Liver tissue was diced into small pieces and further digested with Collagenase D, Hyaluronidase, and DNase I. Then, 5 ml of heat-inactivated FBS was added to digested tissue to inactivate enzymes. The digest was further washed with DMEM+F12 containing 10% FBS. Three different concentrations/densities of percoll were used to isolate cholangiocytes. Cells resuspended in percoll were centrifugated at 2,000 rpm for 30 min without brakes. The interface layer was collected, washed with DMEM+F12, and incubated with the EpCAM Ab to purify cholangiocytes from the rest of the liver cells. Cells were washed and incubated with Sheep Anti-Rat IgG Dynabeads, and the bead-bound Epcam positive cells were separated from other cells using magnetic columns. Epcam positive cells were used for different experiments or expanded in vitro to identify the role of ABCC12 in cholangiocytes. This protocol was used in our recent study published in Gastroenterology (Pham et al., 2021)."
