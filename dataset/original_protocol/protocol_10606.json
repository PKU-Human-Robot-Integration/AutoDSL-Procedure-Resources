    "1. Priming the SynVivo-SMN Microfluidic Device\nEach port (inlet/outlet) of the device is comprised of two parallel ports – one for flowing in surface coating moieties (adhesion molecules, growth matrices, etc.) and/or cells for seeding and the other for running the assay (Figure 1A).\nCompletely submerge the SynVivo-SMN microfluidic device (Figure 1B) in a Petri dish containing sterile deionized (DI) water and place the dish into a vacuum desiccator. Allow the desiccator to run until all of the air is removed from the channels of the device. This should take approximately 15 min.\nBefore removing the device from the water, place Tygon tubing (O.D. of 0.06\" and I.D. of 0.02\") primed with water into each port of the device with fine-point forceps. The tubing should be approximately 1 inch in length. The device can now be removed from the water. Figure 1C shows image of the device with the tubing.\n2. Coating the Microfluidic Device with Desired Protein (e.g., Avidin)\nUsing a pipette, place a drop of water (approximately 100 µl) around the base of the one inlet port tubing. Carefully remove the tubing used to prime the device. The drop of water will prevent air from entering the device.\nPrepare a 1 ml syringe loaded with avidin at a concentration of 20 µg/ml. Connect the syringe to a 24 G stainless steel needle and tubing. Insert the tubing to one of the inlet ports of the device. Clamp the inlet port not being utilized with a jaw clamp.\nInject avidin at a flow rate of 1 µl/min for 10 min to allow complete perfusion of the device. At the end of the flow time, clamp the tubing with the jaw clamp and place the device at 4 °C overnight.\n3. Flowing the Biotinylated Particles for Adhesion Experiments",
    "Allow the device to come to room temperature. Place the device on an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a motorized stage and a high performance camera.\nPrepare a solution of 2 µm biotinylated particles at a concentration of 5 x 106 particles/ml in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS). Load the particles into a 1 ml syringe. Prepare a second 1 ml syringe of PBS only. Load each syringe on a syringe pump and connect to needle and tubing.\nUsing a pipette, place a drop of water (approximately 100 µl) around the base of the inlet port tubing. Carefully remove the tubing used to coat the device. The drop of water will prevent air from entering the device.\nCarefully insert the tubing's for biotinylated particles and PBS from step 3.2 into each of the inlet ports. Figure 2A shows image of the set-up.\nStart injecting biotinylated particles at a flow rate of 2.5 µl/min. Monitor the inlet port on the microscope. At the first sign of particles, begin the timer and continue flow for 3 min.\nAt the end of the 3 min, stop the flow of biotinylated particles while simultaneously staring the flow of PBS at a flow rate of 2.5 µl/min. Allow PBS to flow in the device for 3 min to wash off unbound particles.\n4. Acquiring Images and Making Area of Interest (AOI) Measurements Using Imaging Software (NIKON Elements)\nUse the \"scan large image\" function in the imaging software to acquire the image of the entire device.\nSequentially number the bifurcations in the device and create a circular AOI with twice the diameter of the channels. In this case, set the AOI diameter to 200 µm since the channel diameter is 100 µm.",
    "Use the automated count function in the imaging software to export the number of particles in each AOI to an MS Excel sheet.\nLikewise, use the automated count feature to export the number of particles in the entire device.\n5. Particle Flux Analysis Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Models\nCFD simulations are run using commercially available software (CFD-ACE+, ESI Inc.) for the SynVivo-SMN device topology. The results are stored in a database for analyzing experimental observations. The simulation results store information on wall shear rates, velocity, particle flux, and adhesion in the device.\nThe simulation results are used to determine the number of particles entering each AOI based on a given inlet particle concentration.\n6. Generating Shear Adhesion Map\nCalculate % of adhesion by dividing the adhered particles in the bifurcation by the particles flowing in the bifurcation as shown in equation 6.1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51025/51025eq1.jpgwhere the number of particles adhered and the particles flowing are obtained from protocol steps 4.3 and 5.2, respectively.\nPlot the shear adhesion map using the shear rate at each bifurcation of the networks obtained from the database in step (5.1) and the % adhesion values obtained from equation 6.1.\nSubscription Required.
