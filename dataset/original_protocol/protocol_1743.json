    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample preparation and cell staining\nThis section describes a workflow for staining two donor samples with the 16-color panel shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. In addition, we included FMO controls to aid in identifying lowly expressed markers and single-stained control cells for all 16 parameters (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]). As described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], we stained 200 μL of freshly drawn heparinized whole blood with the full panel. Conversely, the control samples, including FMOs and single-stained control cells, were prepared with 100 μL of blood. Staining 200 μL of blood allowed us to acquire 500,000 lymphocytes for good visualization and characterization of rare subsets. A total of 30,000–50,000 lymphocytes were acquired from the control samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1332_2.csv\nPerm, Permeabilization.\naSee Certificate of Analysis for antibody concentration.\nCritical: Red blood cell lysis and cell fixation require a volume of 1× BD Phosflow™ Lyse/Fix Buffer that is 20 times the volume of blood or 4 mL for 200 μL of blood. Thus, 200 μL of blood is the maximum volume that can be stained in 5 mL polystyrene tubes.\nNote: We recommend creating antibody cocktails with at least 20% overage to ensure adequate volumes for labeling. We suggest increasing the percentage overage to 30%–40% when staining more than two samples with the full panel.\nNote: We used BD Vacutainer® Heparin Tubes for blood collection but ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or other anticoagulants can also be used in this analysis. However, heparin instead of EDTA may provide better results in protocols that require cell stimulation and analysis of signaling pathways, since EDTA could disrupt processes that depend on divalent cations.",
    "Note: Although we have not tested in this protocol, compensation beads can potentially be used as single-color controls for compensation. However, we would recommend treating the beads similarly to the cells, including the incubation steps in fixation and permeabilization buffers.\nSurface staining\nTiming: ∼30–40 min making antibody cocktails; 25 min cell surface staining\nPlace BD Pharmingen™ Stain Buffer (FBS) and BD Horizon™ Brilliant Stain Buffer (BSB) Plus on ice.\nBring antibodies and FVS575V to room temperature (RT), protected from light.\nQuickly spin the antibody vials and pipette volumes from the top of the tube to avoid possible antibody aggregates.\nCalculate the number of polystyrene tubes required, and label the tubes as suggested in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1332-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Experiment setup\nThe tubes are labeled with the names of the specificities and abbreviations for single-stain controls (SC), fluorescence minus one (FMO) and full panel (FP). The colors indicate fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies primarily excited by the violet, yellow-green, blue and red lasers of the instrument.\nPooling antibodies for the full panel.\nDetermine the volume of each antibody based on predetermined optimal concentrations as shown in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nFirst pipet BSB Plus into a polystyrene tube and subsequently add the antibodies to cell surface markers (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1332_3.csv\nBSB, Brilliant Stain Buffer; Note that antibody cocktails DO NOT include FVS575V.\nPooling antibodies for FMO controls\nSimilarly, as described in step 5, add BSB Plus and all surface antibodies, except one. Herein we created 5 FMO controls, each missing one of the following antibodies: CD159a-BV480, CD314-BV711, HLA-DR-BV786, CD95-PE-Cy5 and CD127 PE-Cy5.5.\nPreparing single-stain controls\nAdd BSB Plus (10 μL per sample) to a total of 14 labeled polystyrene tubes, one for each surface marker in the panel and one for unstained cells.\nAdd each antibody to its respective labeled tube.",
    "Gently vortex and place tubes on ice, protected from light. Here we set the vortex to run continuously at 300 rpm and press the tubes against the vortex for 5 s, carefully to avoid spills.\nDistribute equal volumes of the full panel cocktail into new polystyrene tubes, one tube per sample.\nExample in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]:\n1 donor sample: 1 cocktail = 185 μL\n2 donor samples: 2 cocktails + 20% overage = 407 μL total > > 185 μL/donor\nDispense 100 μL of blood into the single control tubes for cell surface markers and FMO tubes and 200 μL of blood into the full panel tubes.\nAdd 1 μL of FVS575V into the FMO tubes and the FVS575V/BV605 single control tube and 2 μL into the full panel tubes.\nBriefly vortex the tubes and incubate at RT for 25 min, protected from light.\nWhile the cells are staining for cell surface markers, prepare the single-stain control tubes for intracellular markers and unstained cells by adding 100 μL of blood to the tubes, labeled as unstained, GzmB, GzmK and perforin.\nCritical: BD Horizon™ Brilliant Stain Buffer (BSB) has been developed to reduce possible staining artifacts when using multiple BD Horizon Brilliant™ Reagents in the same tube. BSB Plus is formulated to allow for reduced test volume (10 μL/test) to reduce the final size of the cocktails and avoid excessive dilution of the antibodies during staining.\nCritical: Because FVS575V is used in its concentrated form, we recommend agitating the samples by vortexing immediately after adding the dye, to guarantee uniform dye incorporation in the cells.",
    "Alternatives: This panel was designed for a FACSymphony A1 and tested in a FACSymphony A5. It can potentially be used in any instrument equipped with Blue, Violet, Yellow-Green and Red lasers and filter sets indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] also shows relative brightness of fluorochromes for easier selection of alternative reagents that are compatible with these filter sets.\nRed blood cells lysis and cell fixation\nTiming: ∼15 min incubation for simultaneous red blood cell (RBC) lysis and leukocyte fixation; ∼25 min washes\nAfter incubation with the antibodies against surface markers and FVS575V, add 2 mL of BD Phosflow™ Lyse/Fix Buffer to the tubes with 100 μL of blood (unstained cells, single-stain controls and FMO controls) and 4 mL to the tubes with 200 μL of blood.\nVortex the tubes or pipet the blood/buffer solution up and down 5 times very gently to avoid spills.\nIncubate at room temperature for 15 min to permit complete RBC lysis and leukocyte fixation.\nSpin down the tubes at 500 g and RT for 7 min, and aspirate the supernatants.\nHomogenize cell pellets by flicking the bottom of the tubes or gently vortexing. Then, wash the cells with 2 mL of BD Pharmingen™ Stain Buffer (FBS) by centrifugation at 500 g and RT for 7 min.\nRepeat step 18 once.\nCritical: Adding a volume of BD Phosflow™ Lyse/Fix Buffer working solution that is 20 times greater than the blood volume is important for proper RBC lysis.\nPause point: After RBC lysis/cell fixation and washes, the cells can be stored for 16–24 h at 4°C in 200 μL of BD Pharmingen™ Stain Buffer (FBS). However, loss of fluorescence signal might be observed with prolonged storage (Diks et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCell permeabilization and intracellular staining",
    "Timing: 20 min cell permeabilization; 45 min intracellular staining; ∼15 min washes\nUse a pipette to resuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL of BD Phosflow™ Perm/Wash Buffer I and incubate at 4°C for 20 min for cell permeabilization.\nAdd the antibodies for intracellular staining to the respective single-stain control, FMO and full panel tubes.\nMix with a pipette and incubate at 4°C for 45 min protected from light.\nWash with 2 mL of BD Phosflow™ Perm/Wash Buffer I by centrifugation at 500 g and 4°C for 7 min.\nRepeat step 23 once.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 300 μL of BD Pharmingen™ Stain Buffer (FBS) and acquire the cells in the flow cytometer.\nCritical: BD Phosflow™ Perm/Wash Buffer I is an aqueous buffer solution containing saponin. Thus, the permeabilization step is reversible and intracellular staining must be carried out in the presence of the buffer (Lacaille-Dubois and Wagner, 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPause point: We have not extensively tested saving the samples in the fridge overnight after intracellular staining. However, in the case that samples cannot be immediately acquired by the flow cytometer, the cells can be saved for 16–24 h at 4°C, protected from light.\nNote: The BD Phosflow™ Lyse/Fix Buffer 5× is also compatible with other permeabilization buffers such as BD Phosflow™ Perm/Wash Buffer II, BD Phosflow™ Perm/Wash Buffer III and BD Cytoperm™ Permeabilization Buffer Plus.\nNote: BSB Plus or BSB are routinely added to the cell sample during the surface staining step and there is no need to add it again during intracellular staining."
