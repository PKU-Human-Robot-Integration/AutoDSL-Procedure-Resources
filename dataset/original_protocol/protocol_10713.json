    "1. Spinning Dope Preparation\nTake lyophilized eADF4(C16) protein.\nWeigh 20 mg of eADF4(C16) in a 1 ml reaction vessel by using a high precision scale.\nAdd 200 μl of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and seal the vessel with Parafilm.\nNote: HFIP is highly volatile and deleterious. As it can cause harm in the respiratory track, work under a safety hood, pipette carefully, and cap the tube.\nVortex the suspension for 1 min and further shake it to clear the solution. To ensure, that the entire amount of protein is completely dissolved, wait over-night.\n2. Electrospinning\nPrepare the electrospinning device (Figure 1): place the filter material on top of the counter electrode and preset the voltage of both the electrode (-22.5 kV) and the counter electrode (+2.5 kV). Set the volume flow to 315 μl/hr.\nNote: while electrospinning, toxic HFIP will be evaporated. Make sure your electrospinning device is connected to a fume hood.\nTake a commercially available 20 G needle and grind the sharp tip with a hand grinder to a residual length of 30 mm. Connect the needle to a 1 ml syringe.\nNote: A plane needle tip is required in order to generate a well-defined Taylor cone.\nLoad the entire spinning dope (200 μl) into the syringe. Overlay the dope with 100 μl of air, in order to allow the complete solution to be extruded during the spinning process.\nNote: In order to avoid clogging of the needle, make sure that there are no particles (aggregates or impurities) in the spinning dope. Work under a fume hood!\nAttach the filled syringe to the syringe pump of the electrospinning device and carefully press the piston onto the syringe until a droplet appears at the tip of the needle. Lock the piston.",
    "Set the distance between the tip of the needle and the counter electrode to 8-20 cm.\nStart the syringe pump and remove the (usually dried out) droplet from the opening of the needle. Activate all safety installations of the electrospinning device immediately and start the high voltage source as soon as a new droplet appears. Electrospinning of the spinning dope will start subsequently. Use a stopwatch to control spinning duration.\nNote: In order to avoid drying out of the solution and thus clogging of the needle, it is necessary to immediately start the spinning process after removing the dried droplet.\nSince electrospinning of recombinant spider silk proteins depends on humidity and temperature, an adaptation of process parameters towards individual lab conditions might be necessary (Figure 2).\nNote: To prevent the droplet from drying (Figure 2B) enable a sufficient flow rate. If there is a low humidity in the surrounding atmosphere, adjust the relative humidity or raise the flow rate. Lower the voltage until a proper Taylor cone occurs (Figure 2A). When there is no solution at the tip (Figure 2C), raise the flow rate and lower the voltage until a droplet occurs. Then adjust voltage in order to establish a regular and stable Taylor Cone (Figure 2A).\nAfter 30 sec / 60 sec / 90 sec of electrospinning switch off the syringe pump. In order to avoid falling droplets, wait 10 sec before turning off the high voltage source to release the residual pressure in the syringe.\nSteps 6 to 8 can be performed on different types of filter materials, such as polyamide, polypropylene and polyester nonwoven meshes, as well as black paper for comparison.",
    "To produce a nonwoven mesh for subsequent stability experiments, use black paper instead of filter material and perform steps 5 to 7. After 5 min of electrospinning, stop the process as described in step 8.\n3. Post-treatment of Silk Nonwoven Meshes\nPre-heat an oven to 60 °C.\nPlace the filter substrates with eADF4(C16) nonwoven meshes vertically and with a minimum distance of 2 cm in a lockable glass container. The container should have two openings that will be used to subsequently introduce ethanol and water.\nNote: When fixing the filter materials, make sure that the area necessary for permeability experiments is not damaged by the clamps.\nConnect two 60 ml syringes, one filled with ethanol and one filled with water, with silicone tubes pointing into the interior bottom of the post-treatment container (Figure 3).\nNote: In order to be able to remove the liquid from the container after the treatment, place the openings of the pipes as close as possible to the bottom.\nPlace the post-treatment container in the oven and add 60 ml of ethanol by extruding the syringe. Use a stopwatch to control treatment duration.\nAfter 90 min of ethanol vapor treatment, remove the ethanol with the syringe from the glass, and add 60 ml of water from the second syringe.\nWait for another 90 min, then remove the water and switch off the oven. In order to avoid droplets by condensation, leave the container in the oven until it has completely cooled down.\n4. Analysis of Spider Silk Nonwoven Meshes",
    "Prepare the silk nonwoven meshes for stability tests on black paper or any other removable support. Cut two frames out of cardboard and adjust double-sticky adhesive tape. Press one frame onto the silk nonwoven mesh deposited on black paper and use a scalpel to cut off the excess of silk fibers (keep the excess fibers for subsequent SEM-imaging). Carefully remove the frame in order to detach the nonwoven from the paper. Repeat this step with the second frame (Figure 4).\nPractical dip test: Cut a piece (1 cm2) of each, the post-treated and non-treated silk nonwoven mesh and dip it into deionized water. The non-treated silk nonwoven mesh will immediately dissolve, while the treated nonwoven mesh will be stable (Figure 5). After dipping, dry the dipped sample and prepare it for SEM imaging.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-measurement and subsequent Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD): In order to gain information about the structural changes of the silk proteins upon post-treatment of the nonwoven meshes, FTIR can be applied using the parameters: Transmittance-mode, scan from 800 to 4,000 cm-1, 60 accumulations are measured and averaged for each spectrum, one reference is measured per spectrum. For quantitative analysis of the data, FSD can be employed (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Thereby, the curves are reduced to the data area between 1,590 and 1,705 cm-1 and a baseline correction is performed. A local least square fit is calculated according to the peak positions taken from previous studies (1611, 1619, 1624, 1630, 1640, 1650, 1659, 1666, 1680, 1691, 1698 cm-1) 22.",
    "SEM imaging: SEM can be applied to investigate fiber diameters and the morphology of silk fibers on different filter substrates and to analyze the influence of the post-treatment on the fiber morphology (Figure 8). Use magnifications of 5,000x to 25,000x in order to get sufficiently detailed images.\n5. Determination of Air Permeability\nPlace a proper fitting part of the filter material on the measuring area of an Akustron air permeability device. Note:: If you use another type of air permeability device, make sure that it fulfills the requirements of DIN 53 887, DIN 53 120, ISO 9237 and ASTM D 737-96 standards.\nEmploy an Akustron air permeability device (or any other as depicted in 5.1) . If necessary calculate the normed data [l / (m2 x sec)].\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 at least 10 times with different parts of your sample and calculate the arithmetic middle (Figure 9).\nNote:  Measuring air permeability requires contact of the device and the nonwoven mesh. Thus, a careful handling of the samples is essential to prevent rupture of the delicate silk nonwoven mesh.\n6. Determination of Filter Efficiency\nUse a proper machine with pressure control and particle counter, such as a Universal particle sizer (Palas GmbH, Karlsruhe, Ger).\nPlace the filter samples in the device and measure particle retention (Figure 10). Aerosol: Di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacat (DEHS); particle sizes: 0.3-3 μm; duration: 30 sec; liquid velocity: 2,350 cm/sec; air flow: 3,400 m3/hr.\nNote: Handle the sample with care and do not touch the surface to prevent destruction of the nonwoven mesh and avoid any pollution. Be sure to create enough samples of equal quality for performance measurements."
