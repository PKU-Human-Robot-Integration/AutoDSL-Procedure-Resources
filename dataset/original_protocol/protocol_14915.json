    "Animal use protocols were approved by the Health Science Animal Care and Use committee at the University of Alberta.\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Animals and Operative Setup\nTransfer animals to a new, clean cage absent of all solid food 24 hr prior to the procedure. They may have free access to water, and liquid diet ad lib until the time of the procedure.\nAutoclave all instruments required for the procedure. Clean operating surface and anesthetic nose cone with 70% ethanol.\nSet up the operating surface with operating microscope, anesthetic machine and supplies in a manner which is comfortable for the operating surgeon. The elbows of the surgeon should be allowed to rest comfortably on the operating table, with hands and arms unobstructed by equipment. Instruments, sutures, cotton swabs, and a 10 ml syringe should be placed in a location that permits easy access during the procedure.\nSet up overhead heat lamps to provide both warmth for the animal during the procedure and light for the operating surface.\nFill a 50 ml conical tube with 0.9% saline, and a 1.5 ml tube with petroleum jelly and place near the operating surface.\n\tNOTE: Sterilize all instruments and surgical supplies. Because the intestine is transected, the procedure itself is not sterile. It is considered clean-contaminated. Take measures to avoid the introduction of exogenous sources of infection.\n2. Ileocolic Resection with Anastomosis",
    "Induce anesthesia by administering 4% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 2 L/min via nose cone from the isoflurane vaporizer until the animals respiratory rate slows to approximately 30-40 breaths/min. Apply moderate pressure to the hind foot of the mouse to ensure there is no pain response prior to initiating the procedure. At this point, turn down isoflurane to 2% and oxygen flow to 0.5 L/min. Intermittently check pain response during the procedure and adjust isoflurane flow rate accordingly.\nApply petroleum jelly to the eyes to prevent drying during surgery, and immobilize the mouse in the supine position with limbs secured using transparent tape.\nClean the abdomen with povodine/iodine solution, and change into new sterile gloves.\nMake a 1.5 cm skin incision in the upper midline of the abdomen using sharp point dissecting scissors to expose the fascia and peritoneum. Open the fascial/peritoneal layer in a similar fashion through the linea alba to expose the peritoneal contents.\nIn contrast to humans, the mouse cecum is typically found in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Once identified, gently grasp the cecum with forceps and deliver it through the incision. Use moistened cotton swabs to fan out approximately 3 cm of terminal ileum extending from the cecum over a sterile gauze draped on the abdominal surface (Figure 1A). Ensure the exposed bowel is kept moist with 0.9% saline during the entirety of the procedure.",
    "Identify the ileocecal artery branching off the superior mesenteric artery along the colon (Figure 1A) using the operating microscope. Dissect out the avascular tissues adjacent to the ileocecal artery, encircle and ligate the artery with a 5-0 silk tie. Next, locate the regional blood supply to the terminal ileum and choose a transection point 1.5-2 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction. Ligate the branches to this section of ileum as above. Divide the arteries with micro dissecting scissors.\nDivide the ischemic portions of ileum and colon ensuring there is adequate blood supply to the transected ends (Figure 1B). It is often helpful to spatulate the ileum by dividing it at a 30 degree angle to increase the diameter of the lumen so it more closely matches the colon. Once the ileocecal portion of bowel has been removed, align the transected ends of ileum and colon on the gauze, ensuring the mesenteric borders of each are aligned.\nConstruct the anastomosis by approximating the transected end of ileum to the transected end of colon using interrupted 8-0 polypropylene sutures (Figure 1C). The first stitch is placed at the mesenteric border, with subsequent sutures placed every 0.5 mm until the Ileocolic anastomosis is watertight. When passing the suture needle through the ileum and colon, ensure that the cut edge is not rolled, and needle bites are 0.5 mm from the cut edges of the bowel. A typical anastomosis will require 14 to 16 interrupted sutures. Test the integrity and patency of the anastomosis upon completion by rolling a cotton swab proximal to distal over the ileum to force contents through the anastomosis. Small bowel contents should freely pass into the colon without anastomotic leakage.",
    "Rinse the exposed bowel with 3-4 ml of 0.9% saline from the 10 ml syringe to wash away stool from the surface of the bowel, and deliver bowel back into the peritoneal cavity. Using 2 ml of 0.9% saline flush the peritoneal cavity, and then drain this fluid by applying gentle pressure to the abdominal wall laterally.\nClose the incision with a 3-0 silk running suture, and discontinue the flow of isoflurane. Administer 0.1 mg/kg of the long acting opiate –buprenorphine- subcutaneously for post-operative pain control.\nObserve the animals under the heat lamp until they are mobile then transfer them to a continually warmed cage.\n3. Post-operative Care and Monitoring\nMonitor animals in a continually warmed cage for signs of distress for the remainder of the day. Transfer animals back to the animal care facility in a new sterile cage with access to liquid diet and water ad lib. Animals may be housed in groups of 3-4.\nPerform a check on the post-operative animals the following morning, ensure the animals do not appear in distress. Feed only liquid diet. If they appear uncomfortable (i.e., hunched posture or minimal activity) administer an additional dose of subcutaneous buprenorphine. Check on the animals once more in the afternoon on post-operative day 1.\nOn the morning of post-operative day 2 the animals should appear fully recovered. Evidence of food consumption and stooling are positive signs of recovery. Now, resume a solid chow diet for the animals.\n\tNOTE: Signs of distress include hunched posture, poor grooming, and minimal activity. If signs of distress are prominent the animals should be euthanized.\nEuthanize the animals by inducing deep anesthesia with 4% isoflurane at an O2 flow rate of 2 L/min until animals are unresponsive to foot pressure. Perform cervical dislocation, and observe for signs of proper euthanization.",
