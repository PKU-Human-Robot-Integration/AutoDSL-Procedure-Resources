    "1. Processing of SLNs\nSynthesis of SLNs\n\tNote: Use the PIT method 1,17,20 to prepare the sub-20 nm SLNs 1.\n\t\nUse aseptic technique, bioreagents or cell culture grade reagents, and sterile materials (i.e., pipettes, spatulas, vials, etc.).\nUse a biosafety cabinet for the synthesis of SLNs (Figure 2).\nCombine 0.6 mg of fluorescent dye (Nile Red (NiR), NiR concentration is approximately 0.3 mg/ml) and 0.10 g of Heneicosane (Lipid, 5 wt/wt% lipid concentration) into a vial (15 ml), co-melt at 90 °C, and stir.\nAdd 0.11 g polyoxyethylene (10) oleyl ether (Surfactant, 5.5 wt/wt% surfactant concentration). Co-melt the resulting mixture at 90 °C and stir.\nAdd 1.79 g of sterile water to the mixture, heat to 90 °C, and stir until a transparent nanoemulsion is formed.\n\t\tNote: Under continued stirring and controlled cooling, SLNs are created. These conditions cause an inversion of the water-in-oil emulsion to an oil-in-water emulsion. Lipophilic molecules such as NiR partition to the lipid droplets.\nPrepare a nanoemulsion in parallel without adding the fluorescent dye, in order to serve as a control sample. Combine 0.10 g of Heneicosane and 0.11 g polyoxyethylene (10) oleyl ether into a vial (15 ml) co-melt at 90 °C, and stir.\n\t\t\nAdd 1.79 g of sterile water to the mixture, heat to 90 °C, and stir until a transparent nanoemulsion is formed.\nFurther sterilize each nanoemulsion using a sterile 0.2 µm filter.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53102/53102fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Prior to the measurements of the samples, measure the particle sizes of two known standards following the manufacturer’s protocol for the standards preparation and measurement.\nFill the glass cuvette with 1.5 ml of standard solution and measure the standard solution using the same measurement conditions as the samples.\n\t\tNote: Previous step was repeated for each standard.\nMeasure the samples as prepared. For each, use the following experimental parameters: a run time of 100 sec, refractive index of water (1.33), viscosity of water at 20 °C (1.002 mPa·sec).\n\t\tNote: This technique uses frequency shifted light to measure the size of the nanoparticles.\nReport the average particle diameter and polydispersity of particle size distribution.\nMelting Point and Latent Heat of Melting\n\t\nUse a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) equipped with an auto-sampler and liquid nitrogen cooling source to investigate the thermal behavior of SLNs 1.\nPipette the as-prepared SLNs into a 40 µl aluminum pan with a mass of approximately 25 mg and hermetically seal the pan using a universal crimper press to minimize moisture loss during the DSC scan.\nMeasure each nanoemulsion from 5 to 80 °C.\nReport the melting point and the latent heat of melting from the DSC plot, where the valley represents the melting point and the integral of the area under the curve in the DSC plot divided by the amount of material represents the latent heat of melting.\n2. SLNs Interaction with Fibroblasts and Dendritic Cells\nCulture of Primary Human Fibroblasts\n\t\nCulture primary human fibroblasts according to the manufacturer’s instructions in liquid medium for the culture of human dermal fibroblasts (medium 106), supplemented with the low serum growth supplement (LSGS) kit. Maintain cells in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and subculture upon reaching 80% confluence.",
    "For both MTT and imaging analysis, seed cells in a 96-well plate, at a density of 2 x 104 cells per well, and allow to equilibrate at 37 °C O/N prior to SLN exposure.\nAt time zero, dilute SLNs in complete medium as indicated (Figure 4), with respect to lipid concentration, and add 10 μl per well to each replicate well in the 96-well plate.\nMaintain cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, during the incubation period.\nMTT Toxicity Assay\n\t\nAfter 24 hr of incubation with SLNs, determine cellular viability using the MTT assay, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nWash cells once and add fresh medium to each well (100 μl/well). Kill control wells by incubating in a 70% methanol solution for 10 min before replacing with fresh medium.\nAdd MTT reagent (10 μl per well) to each well of the microplate and incubate O/N at 37 °C.\nAfter O/N incubation, solubilize intracellular formazin crystals with the provided detergent solution (100 μl per well) according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nAfter 3 hr of incubation at RT, obtain absorbance values at a measurement wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader.\n\t\tNote: MTT reagent used should be less than 1% (w/v) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide.\nFluorescence Microscopy\n\t\nAt specific time points following dosing of fibroblasts with SLN, wash the fibroblasts twice with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fix for 10 min with cold 70% methanol.\nAfter 10 min, replace the methanol with PBS and capture images using an inverted microscope, using a band pass (BP) 690/50 nm filter set.\nCulture of Mouse Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells",
    "Induce mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) as previously described 23,24. Briefly, plate single cell suspensions of C57BL/10 bone marrow in 100 mm Petri dishes at 2 x 106/plate with recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, 300 U/ml) and recombinant murine IL-4 (B cell stimulating factor, 200 U/ml). Change media every 3 days.\nOn day 7, add NiR-loaded SLNs to the dishes at a final concentration of 0.5 and 5.0 µg/ml lipid and maintain the cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for the desired length of exposure.\nCollect cells from the dishes by aspirating all the media in the plate, collecting it in a 50 ml tube, followed by thorough washing of the plate (to dislodge loosely adherent cells) with 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Collect the obtained cell suspension in the same 50 ml tube.\nAssessment of SLNs Incorporation via Flow Cytometry\n\t\nDetermine the concentration of the cell suspension obtained in point 2.4.3 and distribute 3x105 cells into a 12 mm x 75 mm round bottom FACS tube.\nWash the cells by adding 1 ml of PBS and then centrifuging the tubes for 5 min at 400 x g, at a temperature of 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 100 µl of PBS/2 mM EDTA/0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (staining buffer) containing anti-CD11c-FITC monoclonal antibody (0.25 μg/ml final). Incubate for 30 min on ice in the dark.\nWash the cells with 1 ml of PBS and then centrifuge the tubes for 5 min at 400 x g, at a temperature of 4 °C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet with 400 µl of staining buffer. The cells are now ready for acquisition of the samples with a flow cytometer (possibly equipped with blue and red lasers).\nUsing flow cytometry analysis software, assess the level of incorporation of SLNs by DC by gating on the population of CD11c+ cells (FITC positive) and comparing the intensity of SLNs-associated fluorescence (measured in the PerCP-Cy5.5 or APC channels).\nSubscription Required.
