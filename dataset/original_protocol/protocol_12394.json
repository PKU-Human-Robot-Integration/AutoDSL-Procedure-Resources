    "This research was performed in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki regarding the ethical conduct of research involving humans and was approved by the Research Ethic Board of Facultad de Medicina, UNAM (project number 101-2012).\n1. Isolation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell\nPreparation of reagent\n\t\nPrepare phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and supplement with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.\nPrepare Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, high glucose (HG-DMEM), and add 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.Sterilize this culture medium by filtration through a 0.2 µm filter.\nPrepare a collagenase II solution at 100 U/ml in HG-DMEM without FBS or antibiotic-antimycotic solution.\nSterilize the following surgical instruments,which are needed for the isolation, by autoclaving: standard scissors, simple dissecting forceps, fine-point and toothed forceps and a scalpel handle (#4).\nIsolation of mesenchymal stem cells of human amniotic membrane\n\t\nHold the umbilical cord with one hand and with the other hand, detach the amniotic membrane (AM), which looks like a translucent sheet, to obtain a fragment of approximately 5 cm2. If the chorion section is present in the sample, separate the underlying chorion by manual dissection as the chorion section is thicker than the amnion.\nRemove residual blood with three washes of 5 ml of PBS and remove clots with the simple forceps. Make a small cut in the AM with the scalpel to generate fragments of approximately 0.5 cm2.\nEnzymatic digestion of amniotic membrane\n\t\nIncubate the AM with 5 ml of 0.125% trypsin/0.5 mM EDTA solution at 37 °C for 30 min in a 50 ml conical tube at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Centrifuge at 250 x g and 25 °C for 5 min and then remove the trypsin solution by discarding the supernatant.",
    "Add 15 ml of collagenase type II solution and incubate for 2 hr at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with occasional shaking according to Leyva et al.9\nImmediately after digestion with collagenase II, add 15 ml of PBS and centrifuge at 250 x g and 25 °C for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cellular pellet with 15 ml of PBS solution and centrifuge at 250 x g and 25 °C for 15 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cellular pellet in 10 ml of HG-DMEM by shaking gently.\nExpansion of mesenchymal stem cells\n\t\nSeed 2 ml of cell suspension (1 x 104 cells/cm2) in culture flask, and add 2 ml of HG-DMEM and incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Eliminate the non-adherent cell by changing the culture medium after 5-7 days.\nAfter this time, change the culture medium every 3 days for an additional 7-10 days to obtain a cellular confluence of 90%.\nRecover the cells and incubate them for 5 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA solution (trypsinization).\nImmediately after trypsinization, collect cells with a pipette and transfer to a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cellular pellet in 10 ml of HG-DMEM.\nCulture cell suspension in two 75 cm2 culture flasks (5 ml in each flask), and maintain the culture until 90% confluence.\nRepeat steps 1.4.3. to 1.4.6, until the 9th passage or subculture.\nRecover cells by trypsinization as in steps 1.4.3 to 1.4.5 for flow cytometry or other studies.\n2. Preparation of the Porous Bone Matrix Disk (NKB)",
    "To wet the NKB disks (diameter, 12 mm; thickness, 2 mm), incubate each disk overnight with 3 ml of HG-DMEM without FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C, according to Fassina et al. 5\nAfter the wetting process, place the disk in a 50 ml conical tube and spin at 250 x g for 5 min to remove excess culture medium. Place the disk in a 24 well cell culture plate.\n\t\nAdd 500 µl of HG-DMEM and incubate for 30 min at 25 °C. Ensure that no bubbles are present on the NKB disk to favor the correct distribution of nutrients and cells.\nIf bubbles are observed on the disk, shake and add 300 µl of culture medium and incubate for 15 min in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After this time remove 300 µl of culture medium sucking through the wall of well cell culture and confirm that no bubbles form.\nPlace the disk in a new 24-well plate using simple forceps.\n3. Culture of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells on the Porous Bovine Matrix\nSeed a cellular suspension (5 x 105 AM-hMSCs in 100 µl of HG-DMEM) from three subcultures, on the surface of the pre-wetted biomaterial disk and incubate for 30 min in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Perform this step slowly and continuously on the upper face of the biomaterial to allow the cells to interact with the topography of all scaffold. Note: This procedure achieves the 60% of the cells attached on the biomaterial shown in the Table 1.",
    "Add 1.5 ml of HG-DMEM at 37 °C, and maintain the culture for 3 days in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Do not generate turbulence in the addition of culture medium for avoid that the deposition of cells on the bottom of culture plate dish. This is initial time.\n4. Cell Surface Markers Characterization by Flow Cytometry\nDetach the cells from 9th subculture before seeding them on the matrix disk. Use 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA and fix them for 30 min in ice-cold 2% formaldehyde. Following fixation, wash the cells once with 0.05% PBS.\nBlock non-specific binding by incubating the cells with 20% human immunoglobulin for 3 min on ice and incubate 0.1 x 106 cell aliquots with phycoerythrin (PerCP)-conjugated MAb against CD73, FITC-conjugated MAb CD90, PE-conjugated MAb against CD34, FITC-conjugated MAb CD45 and PE-conjugated MAb CD105 for 1 hr at 25 °C in the dark. Isotype-matched FITC-conjugated MAb, PE-conjugated MAb andPerCP-conjugated MAb will serve as negative controls.\nCalculate the expression levels of the surface markers using software for data acquisition and analysis.\n5. Cell Adhesion Detection by Scanning Electron Microscopy\nRinse the cell-disk samples at 3 days of culture twice with PBS and fixthe samples with 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solutionin a 0.1 M Na-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2).\nPrepare the samples for microscopic observation, as previously reported by Rivera-N et al.10 and observe using a scanning electron microscope at an electric potential of 15 kV and at a magnification of 500X and 2000X.\n6. Cell Proliferation Assay\nTo the cell-disk samples containing 1.5 ml of culture medium, add 150 µl of vital colorant(AB) according to manufacturer’s guidelines and incubate the cells in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.",
    "Immediately after the addition of AB (0 hr) and each 24 hr until reaching 7 days of cell culture, measure the absorbance at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 600 nm.\n7. Colony Forming Unit (CFU)11\nCulture 100 cells per 100 mm tissue culture diskin HG-DMEM and incubate for 14 days in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nWash the culture with PBS and stain with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol for 5-10 min at room temperature.\nWash the plates with PBS twice and count the visible colonies using a hemocytometer."
