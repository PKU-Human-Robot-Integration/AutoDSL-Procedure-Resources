The percentage of GFP+ cells in PB of a representative CML mouse at day 14 post transplantation\nNote: Typically, the percentage of leukemia cells (GFP+) in peripheral blood (PB) from CML mice is more than 50% at day 14 post transplantation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nHarvest splenic cells.\nNote: We recommend working on ice during the following steps.\nSnip the skin over the midsection using scissors and tweezers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2490-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Isolate the spleen and place in a sterile 6 cm dish containing BM flush buffer (refer to materials and equipment) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCut the spleen into small tissue pieces using scissors. Grind tissue pieces by the plunger of a 1 mL syringe in 6 cm dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAdd 2 mL of BM flush buffer into the dish, break down the tissue homogenates by pipetting several times with 1 mL pipette tip. Transfer the suspension into a sterile 50 mL tube through a 40 μm cell strainer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Repeat 2–3 times for step 7d. We recommend working on ice during steps 7b–7d to maintain cell viability.\nHarvest BM cells.\nNote: We recommend working on ice during the following steps.\nUse scissors to snip the skin over hind legs and pull the skin apart using tweezers.\nHold one hind leg via tweezer and cut off the hip joint using scissors.\nTransfer it into a sterile 6 cm dish containing 1 mL BM flush buffer.\nRepeat the process for the other hind leg (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2490-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Dissect hind legs into femurs and tibias (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nHold each bone with tweezer.\nInsert the needle of a 1 mL syringe containing 1 mL of BM flush buffer into the marrow cavity.\nFlush into the sterile 50 mL tube through a 40 μm cell strainer, repeat flush 6 times.\nRepeat this procedure for all bones (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Perform step 8c on ice to maintain cell viability.\nRemove erythrocytes from BM and splenic cell suspension, respectively.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 800 × g for 10 min.\nDiscard supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL of erythrocyte lysis buffer (refer to materials and equipment), and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g for 10 min.\nNote: The volume of erythrocyte lysis buffer is dependent on the number of erythrocytes.

We firstly sorted the GFP+ population from BM and splenic cells using flow cytometer. We then isolated c-Kit+ population from the sorted GFP+ cells using a CD117 Microbeads Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-091-224) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
