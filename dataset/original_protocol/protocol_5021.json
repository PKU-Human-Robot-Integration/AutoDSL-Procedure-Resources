    "Routine culture of MDA-MB-231 cellsCulture control (scrambled plasmid) and MCU knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells in Advanced DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAXTM, 100 U ml-1 penicillin and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin.Maintain cells as monolayers in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks containing 10-12 ml growth medium in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.Passage every 3-4 days is ensured by splitting at a 1:10 ratio at 70-80% confluence.Dissociate cells by an initial wash with 2 ml trypsin followed by incubation with 2 ml fresh trypsin for 5 min.Plating of cells for microscopyDiscard growth media from 75 cm2 flask and detach cells by incubating with 3 ml trypsin for 5 min.Collect cells and inhibit the enzyme by adding 5 ml growth medium.Transfer the contents of the flask to a 15 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature (24 °C).Resuspend cells in 5 ml fresh medium and transfer a small amount (~100 μl) to an Eppendorf tube for cell counting.Count cell concentration in resuspension using haemocytometer and tally counter on bench top microscope, ensuring to mix contents of the Eppendorf tube thoroughly with pipette to account for settling.Using results of cell counting, pipette 1,800,000 cells from cell suspension into a new 50 ml Falcon tube (300,000 cells per well of a 6 well plate). Top up tube to contain a total of 12 ml (2 ml total medium per well).Using forceps, transfer one coverslip into each well of a 6 well plate.Pipette 2 ml of the 1,800,000 cell mix into each well, again ensuring to mix contents of the tube using pipette prior to transfer.Place 6 well plate in incubator and leave overnight to allow attachment of cells to coverslips prior to imaging the next day.",
    "Repeat process for each cell type under analysis in a separate 6 well plate.NAD redox state assayUse forceps to transfer a coverslip from the 6 well plate into the metal imaging ring (see Figure 3). Tighten until a small amount of resistance is felt to ensure a watertight seal.Wash cells by gently (to ensure cells are not detached) pipetting 400 μl of imaging buffer onto coverslip in order to remove remaining phenol red.Dispose washing medium and gently pipette 400 μl of imaging buffer onto cells.Transfer coverslip onto heated stage of confocal microscope and bring cells into focus under brightfield illumination.With 375 nm long pass dichroic and 435-485 nm emission filters in place, gradually increase intensity of 351 nm excitation laser until NAD(P)H fluorescence is clearly observed.Search coverslip and magnify image such that 10-20 cells can be observed in the field of view.Begin a time-series acquisition, imaging the field of view every 2 min.After 4 images (6 min from the start of time-series), gently add 100 μl of 5 μM FCCP solution directly onto cells, giving a final FCCP concentration of 1 μM. The NAD(P)H fluorescence signal should begin to decrease due to increased ETC activity.Following acquisition of 4 images under FCCP treatment (8 min after addition), gently add 100 μl of 30 μM rotenone solution directly onto cells, giving a final rotenone concentration of 5 μM. The NAD(P)H fluorescence signal should begin to increase, due to inhibition of the ETC.Terminate experiment 10 min after rotenone addition, giving a total experiment time of 24 min.Dispose of cells and use 100% ethanol to clean any experimental equipment that may come into contact with FCCP or rotenone (e.g., imaging rings, microscope objective).Repeat procedure for all coverslips and save data for subsequent analysis.",
    "NAD(P)H FLIM assayPrepare a coverslip in the metal imaging ring with 400 μl imaging buffer (identically as for the redox state assay) and mount on microscope, adjusting focus to observe cells clearly under brightfield illumination.With 650 nm short pass dichroic and 435-485 nm emission filters in place, gradually increase intensity of 720 nm excitation laser until NAD(P)H fluorescence can be observed with the internal detectors of the microscope.Search coverslip and magnify image such that 10-20 cells can be observed in the field of view.Adjust microscope settings to send fluorescence signal to non-descanned port where FLIM detector is located.Begin FLIM data acquisition, scanning for 2 min total.Move to a new location on the coverslip and repeat process. Acquire 3-5 images per coverslip.Dispose of cells and use 100% ethanol to clean any experimental equipment that may come into contact with FCCP or rotenone (e.g., imaging rings, microscope objective).Repeat procedure for all coverslips and cell types."
