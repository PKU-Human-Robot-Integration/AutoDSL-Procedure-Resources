    "The research presented here was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee of Montclair State University. All participants have been treated within the ethical guidelines of the APA.\n1. Participants\nFirst, obtain IRB Committee Review Approval for the protocol (see Discussion for non- Research 1 institutions). Consultation with experienced researchers is recommended. Obtain forms such as Screening (Supplementary File 1) and Side Effects (Supplementary File 2) forms from other researchers-they are readily shared across the TMS community. NOTE: For the purpose of this experiment, forms were obtained from Simone Rossi.\nTrain all investigators on consenting and informing participants of all risks, side effects, and potential adverse events. If necessary, the Principal Investigator (PI) takes a TMS course if further knowledge is needed. Prior to running participants, ensure that the PI performs a pilot test of the protocol including consent and debriefing.\nRecruit participants through flyers around campus. Screen participants in person; initial contact need not be in person. Ensure that the flyers describe the compensation and risks in general terms only, including any special circumstances (e.g., COVID).\nEnsure participants read the consent form aloud including specific questions including: Are you a current student of ____PI______? Do you have a: history of epilepsy, family history of epilepsy? Do you have a history of seizures? Do you have any of the following-stroke, cranial metal implants, structural brain lesion, implanted device, pacemaker, medication pump, cochlear implant, implanted brain stimulator, metal worker? Do you have a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness? Do you have a high potential for pregnancy? Are you younger than 18? Are you older than 65?\nExcuse any participants affirming any questions from the study.\nBefore being enrolled, ensure that the Screening Checklist is administered.",
    "Pay all participants $25 for their participation and treat in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Review Board at Montclair State University and of the American Psychological Association.\nDeliver all TMS within the parameter appropriate for the institution (see Discussion).\nParticipant safety and comfort is critical so at all points forward, ask and monitor the participants closely both verbally and visually. Nervousness can be the norm which in some cases leads to more difficult outcomes and this is monitored.\n2. TMS equipment handling\nUse a single-pulse TMS device for all stimulation. Trigger the device by simultaneous depression of hand and foot switches manually by the PI. Use the maximum stimulation rate of the stimulator (i.e., 0.75 Hz).\nUse a 70 mm figure-of-eight coil throughout the experiment. Ensure that the coil never reaches dangerous/shut-off temperatures during the experiment. Backup coils are ready in case needed as replacements.\nPresent all stimuli using a laptop computer. Open up the software (e.g., Testable) and login to the account. Click on the appropriate experiment.\nScale the monitor using a credit card. Enter demographic information. Clean/sanitize the laptop before and after each participant is tested.\nDetermine the motor threshold using visual inspection (5/10 evoked Abductor Pollicis Brevis) or via an EMG (Electromyograph).\nUse swim caps to preserve markings. Use a standard coil holder for training and as demonstration only, not for active stimulation.\nUse cloth tape measures to take coordinates for CZ and OZ from the 10/20 system and take MPFC from a previous study on overclaiming10. To determine MPFC, take 1/3 of the distance of nasion to inion, and MPFC is 1.5 cm anterior to this location. This will focus at the BA 10/9 (Medial Frontal Gyrus).",
    "Confirm measurements at the PI's discretion using the fiducial method in which a vitamin E tablet is adhered to the cap of the coil location which will contrast easily in a standard MRI. Due to the cost, this option is limited.\n3. COVID - 19\nDue to COVID-19, include the following protocols14. In the Consent Form, add a disclaimer: \"As a participant in this study, you will spend time in an indoor space within close proximity of the researcher. This poses a significant additional risk to getting COVID-19. We are taking the following precautions to protect you such as: Only PI will be within 6 ft of participant; Only one assistant is allowed in the vicinity but they must stay socially distanced; The participant must wear two masks; PI must wear two masks, gloves and a face shield; The assistant must wear a mask and a face shield; All contact equipment is sanitized.\"\nPerform all experiments in the lobby/hall outside of the normal lab as ventilation is significantly increased. All equipment is sanitizable and portable.\nOnce COVID-19 protocols are relaxed, use normal procedures.\n4. Motor threshold\nMark swim caps along the nasion/inion line and the midpoint taken using a magic marker. Measure pre-auricular points and take those midpoints, as well. From here, plot 10/20 coordinates (see 2.6).\nUsing the right hemisphere pre-auricular line, then go 33% down (in the ventral direction) and begin the search for the optimal location for the Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB) using the TMS coil. Discharge the TMS machine using the coil trigger, the footswitch, and disengaging the safety.\nOrient the TMS coil at 45° for all searches and TMS deliveries.",
    "Start the stimulation output at 30% total machine output by using the dial on the front of the machine and raise in 2% increments using the dial until a movement is noted. Here, as the stimulation is increased in terms of intensity, move the location also. There is a careful interplay between coil movement and stimulation intensity.\nOnce the optimal location is found (i.e., the site that provided the maximum APB response), determine the MT.\nPrior to starting MT determination, mark the coil tip site on the cap to allow accurate placement. Trace the entire anterior portion of the coil on to the swim cap using a magic marker.\nFor the visual inspection method, use approximately 20 pulses (varying machine intensity) to find what stimulation level results in 5/10 (50%) APB responses. The dial should be raised and lowered in response to increased or decreased finger movements. Start at 20% of machine intensity and work up. Once 5/10 responses have been obtained, record the individual's MT by noting what the machine is displaying as the intensity.\nFor the (preferred) MEP method, place disposable electrodes on the APB and the tendon of the thumb and a ground (usually around the back of the wrist), and instead of using visual inspection, a positive MEP must be observed on the recording unit.\nDefine a positive MEP response as an MEP with ≥50 µV peak-to-peak amplitude.\nSimilar to visual inspection, stimulate until 5/10 positive MEPs are observed. The MEPs should be greater than 50 µV. If 50% of the MEPs are above (and 50% below), MT has been identified.",
    "Once established, set the TMS machine to the appropriate stimulation level. 90% of the motor threshold is an ideal balance between effective active TMS and safety. Do not exceed 45% of the machine's total output. There are occasions that a person's MT is 60% of the machine's total output, but this is rare.\n5. Active single-pulse TMS\nRandomly select the order of all sites (e.g., SMA, PZ, MPFC, or Sham over CZ; Figure 5).\nPlace the coil over the active site and start a presentation software, (e.g., Testable (see below)). Stimulation should proceed automatically and in sync with stimuli.\nAlways have a spare coil in case of overheating.\n6. Presentation\nCollect all behavioral data using a presentation software (e.g., Testable) This software is easily configured, and scripts are simple.\n\tNOTE: Three separate blocks are created-one for each of the brain conditions. Demographics to be collected are first chosen using Testable's automatic selection routine. Then real words and fake words are placed into the scripting software. The size and duration of the words are chosen, as is the location on the screen of the stimulus words.\nOnce the script is made, collect demographics first and perform screen calibration. This is done matching the slider to a credit card. Perform all experiments on a computer. All responses are made on the built-in keyboard and sensor pad.\nGive two practice trials and introduce the analog scale. All participants easily adjust to the equipment. The instructions are given orally, and the participants are told to rate how well they know the word.\n\t\nIf the word is familiar to them (such as 'desk') it should be given a high rating.\nIf they 'sort of' know the word, they are to give a medium rating (such as 'chlorophyll').",
    "If it is not that familiar to them, they will assign a low rating (such as '5HTTlpr'). A total of 144 words should be used (36 per brain site).\nParticipants have unlimited time to respond. Following the response on the analog scale, the next word is presented.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
