    "Setup of clean testing chamber and wire cupLine a clean mouse cage bottom with new bedding to a depth of 1-2 cm. The cage used should be equivalent to the type typically used for housing. Food and water should not be present in the testing chamber.Clean a wire cup with 70% EtOH, followed by DI water, ensuring it is completely cleaned and dry before placement in the testing chamber. The wire cup should have a diameter and height large enough to accommodate one mouse.Note: If the wire cup is not tall enough to prevent the mouse from climbing and perching on top, extend the height of the wire cup by affixing the bottom of a 400 ml plastic beaker to the underside of the wired cup with glue or tape, as shown in the Figure 1. An overall cup height of > 14 cm should prevent most mice from perching on the top of the cup.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003549_3508.jpgFigure 1. Example of extended stimulus cup. To prevent the mouse from climbing on top, the height of the cup can be extended by attaching the bottom of a 400 ml plastic beaker. This cup is extended by 3.75 cm to a total height of 14.6 cm. A height of at least 14 cm is typically sufficient to prevent a mouse from perching on top.The testing area should be isolated from other laboratory activity. If a separate room is not available, isolate the testing area by hanging opaque sheets around it and keep the room as quiet as possible to minimize disruption.Within the testing area, the lights should be dim, and there should not be any bright light directly above, as light level can influence exploratory behaviors in mice (Morato and Castrechini, 1989).",
    "Use a light level (approximately 3-6 lux) sufficient to visualize the entire cage and the test mouse through the video camera. This illumination can be achieved through indirect light.Setup of camera and computer for video recordingPosition camera to ensure it captures the entire area of the testing chamber. The camera should be placed perpendicular to the long end of the cage. The camera should be close enough for detailed quantification, but far enough away that the entire cage can be visualized (Figure 2).Connect the camera to the video software iSpy.Edit the camera settings to set the recording time to 610 s (10 min plus 10 s), the max frame rate to 10 FPS, and the buffer time to 2 s. Each trial is 10 min long; the additional 10 s are used to place the stimulus mouse within the cup.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003636_2969.jpgFigure 2. Testing area setup including testing chamber, camera, stimulus cup, and opaque sheets for light control. In this setup, the lights directly over the cage are turned off, so the light in the testing area comes from the other side of the opaque sheets. Laboratory tape is placed on the bench to indicate consistent placement of the cage.Acclimatization of mice to testing room and chamberBring stimulus and test mice to the testing room in their respective home cages. During transport, cages should be individually covered by opaque cloths or dark plastic bags. Keep mice in home cages until ready for individual acclimatization to the testing chamber. Cages holding stimulus mice and test mice should be placed at least 1.5 m away from each other to prevent any interaction prior to the test.Place one test mouse in a fresh testing chamber and place the chamber within the enclosed testing area for 30 min.",
    "(This habituation period will not be analyzed, so video recording during this period is optional.)Separate stimulus mice to individual clean cages kept outside of the enclosed area for 30 min.Following the test mouse’s 30-min habituation to the testing chamber, place an inverted wire cup in the middle of the right half of the testing chamber (Figure 3). The stimulus mouse should be able to explore the entire cup perimeter.Allow the mouse to explore the cup for 10 min.Note: This exploration period will not be analyzed, so video recording during this period is optional.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003703_8635.jpgFigure 3. Placement of stimulus cup with testing apparatusHabituation test trials (Trials 1-8)Begin video recording.Lift one side of the cup and gently place stimulus mouse #1 underneath (Figure 4). Complete placement underneath the cup within 10 s.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003731_0922.jpgFigure 4. Placement of stimulus mouse under wired cupImmediately start a stopwatch or use a clock to time 1 min. Note the time of day in a lab notebook. An example worksheet that can be used for this purpose is provided as Supplemental File 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20191216/Supplemental File 1.pdf].After 1 min, quickly remove the stimulus mouse from the wire cup and place back in its individual cage.Allow the test mouse to explore the testing chamber and empty wire cup for the remaining 9 min. This marks the end of the first trial.Repeat Steps D1-D5 until 8 trials have been completed, using stimulus mouse #1 for each trial.Dishabituation test trial (Trial 9)After completion of the 8th trial, repeat Steps D2-D4 using stimulus mouse #2 (Figure 5). This marks the end of the 9th trial and the end of testing.Note: If testing another mouse immediately after, clean the wire cup and the sides of the cage with 70% EtOH followed by DI Water, wipe dry with a paper towel, and replace the bedding.",
    "When testing for a given day is completed, stimulus mice can be returned together to their home cage, if housed together prior to testing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003832_7974.jpgFigure 5. Timeline of protocolVideo Coding for Blinded AnalysisEach 90-min testing period is recorded as 9 separate 10-min video recordings.Create an Excel spreadsheet (Figure 6A).In the first column (e.g., Column A), type the original names for the files (e.g., CageId-Trial#), such that each row represents one trial.In the second column (e.g., Column B), type the following code into the function tab above the Excel cells: =CHAR(RANDBETWEEN(65,90))andCHAR(RANDBETWEEN(65,90))andRANDBETWEEN(10,99)Use the corner of the bottom right of the cell and drag it down to assign that function to all the rows to create a key.Highlight the codes and copy them. Right-click in the first cell of the column to the right (e.g., Column C), select “Paste Special,” and select “Paste Values” (Figure 6B). (If “Paste Values” is not used, the values generated by the code will continue to change anytime a change is made in the spreadsheet.)Rename the files according to the corresponding codes. Sort files alphabetically by file name to shuffle the files out of order (Figure 6C). Follow the alphabetical order of coded file names during analysis.Note: When renaming files for blinded analysis, make sure to have an alternate way of identifying the video. For example, videos recorded in iSpy have the time in the corner of the image, which can serve as back-up identification. When running the behavioral tests, note the times of each trial in a notebook in case a file is misnamed. Once blinded analysis is complete, refer to the key created In the Excel sheet to match the code-named file to the respective mouse and trial.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003856_8518.jpgFigure 6. Example of random file naming/coding on Excel and sample blinding file. A.",
    "The “key” is created in Excel by listing the original file names in Column A. The function is added to the adjacent column to produce the randomized “blinding” names. B. After copying the names and selecting “Paste Special: Values”, the key is complete and will not change. From there, the respective file names are renamed with this randomized 4-digit name. C. Finally, the files are sorted alphabetically by 4-digit name. When scoring the videos, follow this alphabetized order to shuffle the videos for blinded analyses."
