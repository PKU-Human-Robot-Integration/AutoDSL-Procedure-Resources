    "Preparations before imagingBuffer preparationFilter ddH2O through 0.2 µm syringe filter into clean glass vials before use.Prepare 50 mM NaOAc buffer (pH 5.2). Filter buffer through 0.2 µm syringe filter into clean glass vials before use.Prepare protein stock solutionsDissolve protein samples to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in filtered buffer as stock solutions using 1.5 ml Eppendorf Protein LoBind Tube (see Note 1). Aliquot stock solutions into 100 µl fractions (see Note 2). Store stock aliquots at -20 °C before use.Preparation of imaging “substrate” (see Note 3)Clean one glass slide with ddH2O followed by rinsing with 75% ethanol. Air dry the slide and apply the Loctite® Epoxy instant mix glue to the center of the slide. After a quick mix of the two glue components, carefully remove the HOPG from its case using tweezers and place it on top of the glue. Allow overnight incubation for the tight binding of HOPG to the slide.Sample preparation for AFM imagingPrepare diluted protein samplesDilute protein stocks to desired concentration (see Note 4) with corresponding buffer or ddH2O using Eppendorf Protein LoBind Tubes (see Note 1), mix the dilutes by gentle vortexing and then spin down the protein solutions at 3,000 x g for 2 min.Substrate preparationHOPG has multiple layers and each layer is atomically flat. Carry out each AFM experiment on a fresh layer. To obtain a new layer of HOPG, simply use Scotch tape to adhere to the previous surface and peel off the old surface. Note that sometimes multiple attempts are required to achieve a visually flat HOPG surface (see Note 5).Protein binding to HOPGAfter obtaining the fresh HOPG surface, place the glass slide with HOPG in a petri dish and deposit 100 µl of protein solution onto the center of the HOPG surface.",
    "Cover the petri dish with lid to prevent unnecessary contamination from the surrounding environment. Place moist Kimwipes in the petri dish (avoid direct contact with HOPG) if long incubation time (more than 30 min) is needed to reduce sample evaporation. Allow the protein solution to incubate on HOPG for one minute or longer (see Note 6) at room temperature. Following incubation, use Kimwipes (see Note 7) to blot away the protein solution and rinse the HOPG surface with 100 µl ddH2O. Blot away the remaining liquid and dry the surface further under a slow steam of N2 gas flow for 2 min. At this point, the sample preparation is complete and the HOPG surface is ready for AFM scanning.AFM imaging of the self-assembly of extensinsRefer to the user’s manual (http://mmrc.caltech.edu/Asylum/Asylum%20MRP-3D%20manual.pdf[href=http://mmrc.caltech.edu/Asylum/Asylum%20MRP-3D%20manual.pdf]) from Asylum Research for the operation of the MFP-3D SA AFM. Use “AC mode” (Chapter 6 in the manual, pp 121-142) for the scanning of samples in air. The probe we used was a NCS18 silicon probe from Mikromasch (see Materials and Reagents). For better resolution, Hi'Res-C14 probes (catalog number: Hi'Res-C14/Cr-Au-5) are recommended because of their finer tip radius (~1 nm).After probe installation, optical detection laser alignment and probe tuning, on the master panel (see pp136 in the manual), select the initial scan parameters as follows:Scan Size = 5.00 µmScan Rate = 0.75 Hz (see Note 8)Scan Points/Lines = 256Set Point = 800.00 mVIntegral Gain = 4 (see Note 9)Engage the AFM probe to sample surface by lowering the AFM head and start scanning. Here note that the “Drive Amplitude/Frequency” values on the master panel are the values automatically filled in by the instrument upon the finishing of probe tuning, thus no changes of these values are needed.",
    "After the start of scanning, first allow the system to scan for 2 min to stabilize the probe and adjust the instrument to surrounding environmental vibrations. Then manually lower the “Set Point” value until surface features start to appear on the height image. Imaging optimization can be achieved by adjusting “Set Point” and “Integral Gain” values. Finally, the “Scan Points” and “Scan Lines” can be increased to 512 or even 1,024 (see Note 10) for more pixels in each image thus enhance the image quality.For the determination of self-assembly pattern, take at least five images at five different locations on the HOPG surface for each sample.Image processingImages need to be flattened using the “flatten” function in IGOR Pro software before any measurements. Information of height (i.e. the diameter) and length of a molecule can be directly measured on the images using the IGOR Pro software. The default color setting of the images is grey but IGOR Pro has a variety of built-in color schemes that can be used to false-color images afterwards. In the meantime, the contrast and brightness of each image can also be adjusted for a better presentation of the image."
