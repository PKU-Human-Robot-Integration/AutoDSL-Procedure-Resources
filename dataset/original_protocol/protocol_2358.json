Schematic illustration of the tissue preparation steps before cryosectioning\nAdd 10 mL pre-cooled 4% PFA solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and place the tube on ice.\nCull the mouse and surface-sterilize the skin using 75% ethanol.\nPlace the mouse on a dissection board and use sterile forceps and scissors to cut through the lower extremity skin.\nCarefully remove the surrounding muscle and expose the femur.\nDissect the femur by proximally separating the femoral head from the acetabulum and distally separating the lower end of the femur from the upper end of the tibia.\nNote: When the femur is separated from the upper and lower joints, it is recommended that the articular surfaces of the two adjacent bones be accurately separated in a visual environment so as to avoid damage to the femur.\nFurther remove the attached soft tissue on the femur.\nCritical: It is important to completely remove all the residual muscle and connective tissue on the bone surface, the remaining of which will interfere with the process of fixation and decalcification.\nImmediately transfer the separated femur to the prepared fixation solution (4% PFA solution) and fix for 4 h on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1993-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B) Decalcification of femora on a shaker at 4°C, and side by side images of freshly harvested (left) and decalcified (right) bones.\n(C) Dehydration of femora by 30% sucrose solution, during which the bones will first float for a few minutes and then descend through the solution to the bottom of the tube.\nNote: It is best not to put more than four long bones in each tube, so as not to lower the fixation efficiency.\nAfter fixation, discard the fixative completely and add 10 mL pre-cooled PBS to wash the bone on a shaker (100–150 rpm) at 4°C for 5 min. Repeat this step another two times and replace PBS after each wash.\nNote: It is important to wash the bone samples thoroughly so as to remove all of the PFA.\nNote: For the femur, 4 h is sufficient, and over-fixation will inactivate the antigen, leading to decreased signal in imaging.\nDiscard the PBS completely and add 10 mL pre-cooled decalcification solution (Harms et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Incubate the mixture on a shaker (100–150 rpm) at 4°C for 24–48 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: In this protocol, rapid decalcification method is applied, as indicated by previous study (Kusumbe et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), which uses a sufficient amount of decalcification solution and maintains constant shaking for 24–48 h, without changing the decalcification solution, thus helping preserve antigenic activity.\nNote: In principle, the time needed for decalcification depends on the calcification degree of bones. For example, due to insufficient bone calcification, the femur of juvenile mice (2–4 weeks old) can be decalcified in 24 h. Nevertheless, the decalcification of bones from aged mice (> 50 weeks old) requires incubation for at least 48 h.",
    "After decalcification, discard the decalcification solution completely and add 10 mL pre-cooled PBS to wash the bone on a shaker (100–150 rpm) at 4°C for 5 min. Repeat this step another two times and replace PBS after each wash.\nDiscard the PBS completely and add 10 mL 30% sucrose solution. Incubate the mixture at 4°C for 12–16 h with the tube being upright (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: When adding sucrose, the degree of decalcification can be determined. In specific, if the decalcification is complete, the bones will first float for about 20 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and then descend through the solution to the bottom of the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). If not, repeat the above decalcification process.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Determining the degree of decalcification, related to step 11\nEmbedding and cryosectioning: Day 4\nTiming: 1 h for tissue embedding; 30 min for cryosectioning of one sample\nThis major step describes embedding (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and cryosectioning of mouse femur, resulting in tissue sections that are ready for immunofluorescence staining.\nSet the temperature of the cryostat to −23°C in advance for pre-cooling.\nChoose an appropriate embedding mold according to the shape and size of the bone sample, or use tin foil to make a personalized mold.\nNote: The size of the mold should be appropriately larger than that of the tissue sample, so that when slicing the tissue sample, there is sufficient margin left.\nDiscard the sucrose solution and add an appropriate amount of embedding medium (OCT) to the tube that can completely cover the tissue sample. Incubate at 25°C for 20–30 min.",
    "Add a small amount of OCT into the mold and put the mold in the pre-cooled cryostat for solidification. The purpose of this step is to form a base for the sample.\nAdd an appropriate amount of OCT into the mold and embed the bone sample into the OCT. Adjust the position and angle of the bone so that the long axis of the bone is parallel to the base of the mold, the posterior side of the bone faces the blade and the anterior side faces the base of the mold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]), and put the mold in the pre-cooled cryostat for at least 30 min to allow complete solidification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1993-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative images showing the steps of tissue embedding and cryosectioning\n(A) Embedding of mouse femur in OCT.\n(B) Cryosectioning of mouse femur.\n(C) Flattened tissue section before collection.\n(D) Collected tissue section on slide.\nNote: Take care to avoid bubbles during the embedding process.\nPause point: The embedded bone samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months.\nSet the slice thickness to 30 μm and install the blade in the holder for pre-cooling. Also, place tweezers and a camel-hair brush in the cryostat for pre-cooling.\nTake out the sample from the mold and glue it to a specimen disc using OCT. If samples are kept at −80°C, place them in the cryostat for 60 min before isolating them from the mold.\nNote: It is important to ensure strong adhesion between sample and disc so as to avoid movements or detachments when sectioning.\nFix the disc on the specimen head, and slice the solidified embedding agent on top of the sample. During this step, the position of the sample as well as of the anti-roll glass plate is adjusted.",
    "When the bone tissue is revealed, further adjust the position of the sample to ensure sectioning of the bone as a whole (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Then, slice the bone sample according to the set thickness (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCritical: Be careful with the blades since they are very sharp.\nFor collection of bone tissue sections, open the anti-roll glass plate, quickly use tweezers to hold one end of the slice and gently flatten the slice with a camel-hair brush (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nTake out the slide placed at 25°C and press down quickly towards the section to allow adherence of the section to the slide as a whole (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCritical: Try to transfer the tissue section to the slide within 1 min of slicing to avoid freeze-drying of the tissue. Besides, do not use the same slide to collect consecutive sections so as to keep the temperature of slide at 25°C.\nAir-dry the slides for 30 min at 25°C to avoid section detachment caused by insufficient drying.\nPause point: The slides can be stored at −20°C for up to 1 year.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.

Tissue sectioning and collection, related to steps 20–22\nImmunofluorescence staining: Day 5–6\nTiming: 24 h\nThis major step describes the immunofluorescence staining of sections, which includes membrane permeation, blocking, primary antibody labeling, secondary antibody labeling, and nuclear staining.\nTake out the frozen slides from the refrigerator and thaw them at 25°C for at least 20 min.\nUse a PAP pen to draw a circle or square around the tissue section to avoid the spillage of liquid during the staining process (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1993-Fig4.jpg",

Representative images showing the steps of immunofluorescence staining\n(A) Drawing of hydrophobic barrier around femur section, marked with dotted line.\n(B) Rehydration in a staining jar.\n(C) Example of adding solution to section.\n(D) Mounting with coverslip.\nNote: When drawing the hydrophobic barrier, be careful not to touch or get too close to the sample.\nRehydrate the sections by putting the slides inside a staining jar with PBS at 25°C for 5 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Repeat this step another two times and carefully replace PBS after each wash.\nCritical: It is important to keep the tissue sections rehydrated from this point forward.\nPlace the slides in a humidified chamber and add 200 μL freshly prepared permeabilization solution to each section (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Incubate at 25°C for 20 min.\nNote: Instead of being added directly onto the tissue sections, the solution should be pipetted adjacent to the tissue sections so as to prevent damage to the sample.\nNote: In principle, permeabilization solution is used for thicker sections (> 30 μm) or staining of intracellular targets.\nDiscard permeabilization solution via pipetting and wash the slides in a staining jar with PBS at 25°C for 5 min. Repeat this step another two times and carefully replace PBS after each wash.\nPlace the slides in a humidified chamber and add 200 μL freshly prepared blocking solution to each section. Incubate at 25°C for 30 min.\nCritical: Blocking solution will vary with host background of the used primary antibodies. In this protocol, goat serum is used since the primary antibodies are generated in goats.\nDiscard blocking solution via pipetting and add 100 μL freshly prepared primary antibody dilutions to each sample. Incubate at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nThe primary antibody dilutions: anti-β-galactosidase (1:200) and anti-CD31 (1:100) in blocking solution.",
    "Critical: In this protocol, the anti-β-galactosidase requires a secondary antibody step, while the anti-CD31 is directly conjugated and does not require a secondary antibody step.\nNote: For primary antibody coupled with fluorescent dyes, perform this step and subsequent experimental steps away from light to avoid fluorescence quenching.\nNote: Use secondary antibody alone as the negative control for background signal.\nTake out the humidified chamber and allow the tissue sections to return to 25°C for 20 min.\nDiscard the primary antibody via pipetting and wash the slides in a staining jar with PBS at 25°C for 5 min. Repeat this step another two times and carefully replace PBS after each wash.\nPlace the slides in a humidified chamber and add 100 μL freshly prepared secondary antibody dilutions to each sample. Incubate at 25°C for 1.5 h.\nNote: For steps 33–39, be careful to protect sections from light.\nDiscard the secondary antibody via pipetting and wash the slides in a staining jar with PBS at 25°C for 5 min. Repeat this step another two times and carefully replace PBS after each wash.\nPlace the slides in a humidified chamber and add 100 μL freshly prepared Hoechst solution to each sample. Incubate at 25°C for 30 min.\nDiscard the Hoechst solution via pipetting and wash the slides in a staining jar with PBS at 25°C for 5 min. Repeat this step another two times and carefully replace PBS after each wash.\nCarefully wipe off excess PBS and add a drop of mounting medium around the tissue which gradually flows to cover the tissue.\nGently use forceps to lay coverslips on top of the sections (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).",
    "Note: Too much mounting medium will cause the coverslip to easily slip while too little will cause the generation of air bubbles. According to our experimental experience, it is recommended that the amount of mounting medium for small coverslips (24 mm × 32 mm) be about 50 μL, and that for large coverslips (24 mm × 50 mm) be about 100 μL.\nDry slides at 25°C for 30 min and store dried slides at 4°C for imaging.\nPause point: The slides can be stored at 4°C for a few days, protected from light.\nNote: Imaging within 72 h and avoiding repeated imaging are recommended as the immunofluorescence signal diminishes with time or repeated imaging.\nConfocal image acquisition: Day 7\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis major step describes how to set the confocal laser scanning microscope, scan the sections, and acquire images.\nTurn on the computer, the lasers (405 nm light, 488 nm light and 633 nm light), and the mercury lamps.\nNote: The purpose of this step is to allow warm-up of the equipment.\nWipe off extra liquid on the prepared slide and put it on the stage.\nOpen the FV10-ASW Viewer software, and choose the Hoechst fluorescent channel (i.e., DAPI).\nCritical: Be careful to avoid direct eye contact with the high-power lasers.\nObserve the sample through microscope eyepiece, and move the region of interest (ROI) to the center of the visual field.\nChoose the desired fluorochrome channels that match the used secondary antibodies and preview the chosen ROI. Here, we will introduce the steps for Z-stack scanning that can realize sequential depth imaging of the sections and obtain 3D-reconstructed images.\nChoose the desired magnification.\nConfigure the parameters of laser powers and channel detectors, including HV, Gain and Offset.",
    "Set the scanning speed, the upper and lower limits of focal planes, and the StepSize. The number of slices will be automatically calculated by the software.\nCritical: When adjusting the parameters, try to make the brightness of the images moderate. If the brightness is too high, it will cause overexposure and increase the background, which may lead to false positives; if the brightness is too low, it may lead to false negatives.\nScan the sections with a resolution of 1,024 × 1,024.\nNote: During scanning, it is important to keep the space protected from light and the operating desk stable.\nAcquire the confocal images and overlay the Z-stack images by the composite button. Save the files and make further quantification analysis by appropriate softwares, such as ImageJ and Image Pro-Plus."
