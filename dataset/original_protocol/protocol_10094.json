    "This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the Stony Brook University Chancellor's Animal Research Committee.\n1. Set-up of motion capture system\nSet-up\nMount six cameras on the wall (or tripods) using finely adjustable geared heads. Position three cameras above on each side of the treadmill, with each camera angled 20°-45° below the horizon, approximately 2.0 m away from the treadmill and approximately 0.5 m away from adjacent cameras for maximum coverage of markers (Figure 1).\n\t\nEquip each camera with a ring light for the visualization of retroreflective markers.\nStart the motion capture system.\n\t\nUnder Project | Specification, define the desired markers for the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: For demonstration purposes, a total of 22 markers is used for both the forelimbs and hindlimbs (11 markers on each side) to assess bilateral quadrupedal locomotion. Alternatively, the Import marker set with specific marker ID option allows for preset calculations within the software.\n2. Calibration of motion capture system\nCapturing the calibration video\n\t\nPlace the L-shaped calibration frame (hereafter referred to as the \"L-frame\") orthogonally on the treadmill, with the long leg of the L-frame pointing in the rat's walking direction (Figure 2).\nOpen the motion capture software and select Record to capture the calibration video.\nMove the trident shaped calibration frame (hereafter referred to as the \"wand\") throughout the treadmill area in space so as to cover all areas that the rat will be walking in.\n\t\tNOTE: The L-frame contains four markers that establish the global coordinate system and the wand contains three markers that will calibrate the 3D walking space of the rat.",
    "Record a minimum of 1 min of footage to ensure adequate wand data points are present for proper calibration at 120 frames/s.\nSave the videos as 3D calibration files.\nL-Frame tracking\n\t\nRight click the camera group and select 3D tracking. Under the drop-down window, select 3D calibration videos, then All calibration cameras.\nUsing the fixed point function, track the L-frame origin, L-frame short, L-frame mid, and L-frame long on each of the six calibration videos. Define all points and select the Search Automatically button.\n\t\tNOTE: L-frame position must remain consistent relative to the treadmill during the whole experiment to prevent the coordinate system shifting.\nWand tracking\n\t\nRight-click on the camera group and select Automatic 3D-Wand Tracking.\nSelect all cameras in the camera selection. On the bottom right of the window, select Options, de-select Detect L frame, and select Start Tracking.\nAfter automatic tracking, select Assign Wand Short, Wand Mid, and Wand Long markers for all six cameras.\nOn the 3D tracking window, select Export to raw data, then select the Overwrite existing wand data option to save the tracking.\nSelect Yes in the window that appears after the last step to save the most accurate data.\n\t\tNOTE: This new tracking will be saved as Tracking under Automatic tracking tab in the left sidebar. Saved tracking can be accessed and edited later.\nCalculating calibration\n\t\nRight-click Camera calibration groups and select New wand calibration group.\nSelect All cameras and hold down the Ctrl (control) key while selecting Ok.\nChange wand length to 100.00 mm, L-frame floor offset to 7.00 mm, iterations for outlier-detection to 4, and allowed wand length-deviation to 0.300.\nChange the Camera that the wand must be visible in option to 4, and turn on the following: fix aspect ratio, fix skew parameter, and fix principal point (Table 1).",
    "NOTE: These settings were experimentally determined to be optimum for this set-up.\nAccept calibrations with standard deviation of wand length less than 3 mm and residual value of less than 0.004.\n\t\tNOTE: If the cameras or associated equipment is moved beyond this point, one will be required to recalibrate the system.\n3. Training and preparing the animal for treadmill locomotion\nTraining rats for treadmill locomotion\n\t\nAcclimatize rats to the treadmill for 5 min prior to a training session12.\nTrain the rats to walk with full weight bearing on their limbs at 13 cm/s for 15 min/session in the mornings for 1 week. Train all rats until they are capable of consistently walking (minimum of 10 continuous steps) on the treadmill12.\nComplete training sessions around the same time of the day for each rat.\nPrior to data collection, anesthetize the rat by placing the rat in an incubation chamber.\n\t\nDeliver Isoflurane gas (1.0%-2.5%) and 0.4 L of oxygen for approximately 5 min. Pinch the foot of the rat to check for the depth of anesthesia.\nProceed when the rat does not respond to the paw pinch (negative paw withdrawal reflex).\nShave the rat in regions where markers will be placed to avoid the fur from interfering with marker tracking (Figure 1).\n\t\nPalpate the skin for the bony landmark to place the markers. Use pen markers for joints distal to the elbow and the knee (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: The retroreflective markers are plastic hemispheres 0.5 cm in diameter covered with retroreflective tape.\nPlace the markers as desired on bony landmarks prior to data collection (Figure 3).",
    "NOTE: In healthy, non-neurotraumatic rats, the retroreflective markers placed over distal joints are often removed by rats. For demonstration purposes, retroreflective markers are placed over the proximal bony landmarks (iliac crest, hip, knee joint for the hindlimbs, shoulder and elbow joints for the forelimb), and pen markers are used for the more distal landmarks. In our hands, this has yielded reproducible results between and within rats (unpublished data).\n4. Motion capture\nSelect the red camera button on the top bar of the motion capture software to record a trial. Designate the saving location on the computer and select Begin recording to record at 120 frames/s.\nSet a user-defined treadmill speed and allow the rat to walk for approximately 30 s, or a minimum of 10 continuous steps.\nStop the recording and check that the footage contains at least ~10 continuous steps before continuing.\nCreate a new camera group for each trial after saving the recorded video.\n5. Motion tracking\n Select the \" +\" sign adjacent to the saved camera group. This will display a list of all six cameras.\nAssign 3D calibration to the camera file\n\t\nGo to Camera calibration group and right-click on Calculated calibration. Select Assign 3D camera parameters. Assign the calibration file to the appropriate camera files in the saved camera group. Hover over the camera file to verify calibration (reads as 3D calibration valid).\nIndividual camera 2D tracking\n\t\nRight-click the camera group for motion tracking. Select 2D tracking.\nSelect seven to ten best continuous and consistent steps for tracking. Record the frame number at the first contact of the reference limb on the treadmill for each step.\n\t\tNOTE: For demonstration purposes, the left hind limb was selected as the reference limb.\nVarious tracking options are available.",
    "Right click the marker of interest and select Automatic Tracking, which will detect bright circular spots created by retroreflective markers (Figure 4).\nAlternatively, track markers using Pattern matching, which will use an algorithm built into the software to track markers based on size and color (Figure 4).\nManually track and correct undetectable markers or errors in tracking.\nUse black markers when distal joints retroreflective markers are not possible.\n\t\nTrack black markers using advanced image processing by inverting black markers to bright spots for automatic tracking.\n\t\tNOTE: The Image processing option can be used to help track markers that are difficult to detect or see.\nRight-click on the rat video in the 2D tracking window. Select Image processing.\nSelect Advanced view and add a combination of the four filters (brightness, contrast, gamma) to make the black marker as dark as possible in comparison to its surroundings. Lastly, add Invert, and the black marker will become a bright marker that can be tracked automatically (Figure 5).\nMarker placement correction\n\t\nManually track and correct undetectable markers or errors in tracking.\nTo manually track the video, select the desired marker on the right sidebar. Right-click and select Manual tracking. Begin tracking the selected marker on the rat video that appears frame-by-frame.\nTo rectify any errors, go to the frame where the tracking error occurred. Right-click on the specific marker tab in the right sidebar and click Delete point. Retrack the point manually at the accurate position.\nUsing the above method, complete 2D tracking for all cameras used for all desired markers in the frame range of continuous steps.\nClick on Save throughout the tracking process.\n6. Kinematic analysis\nPhase assignments\n\t\nRight-click Phases and select Edit phase model.",
    "Customize gait cycle phases for each limb according to the deficits one chooses to study (e.g., addition of drag phases, toe curl phases, etc.) within the traditional stance and swing phases of a step cycle. Define the phases for the experiment (Figure 6).\n\t\tNOTE: For demonstration purposes, three phases are shown here, and the left hindlimb is used as the reference limb for the seven to ten gait cycles.\nRight-click the camera in the camera group and select show video.\nAssign phases of the gait cycle for each limb within the software using the add phase button or F11 shortcut key.\nSelect the appropriate limb under analysis and designate the first frame of tracking as the start of the Stance phase.\nProgress the video to the frame where stance phase ends and swing phase starts. Designate this frame as the start of Swing phase.\nProgress the video to the first frame where foot begins to descend. Designate this frame as the start of Mid swing phase.\n\t\tNOTE: Herein, the stance phase of a step cycle for each limb is defined as the first frame in which the limb contacts the treadmill surface. Swing phase is defined as the first frame in which the limb leaves the treadmill surface. Mid swing phase is the frame where the limb achieved maximum clearance and begins to descend. A complete gait cycle is defined from the onset of initial stance to the stance phase assignment of the next gait cycle.\nRepeat these steps until the limb phases assignments are complete for each step. Repeat for the other three limbs.\n3D coordinate calculations\n\t\nPerform 3D calculations after tracking all six cameras.\nRight click on the camera group and select New 3D calculation, click All for camera selection and then select OK.",
    "NOTE: A new folder will appear. This folder contains all the 3D coordinate data for all the markers tracked. To view and/or edit phases, right-click on 3D coordinates in the left sidebar and select Edit Phases (Figure 7).\nGenerate data of interest such as joint height or velocity diagrams with data points by dragging out marker of interest to view side by side with the assigned gait phases. (e.g., joint kinematics in Figure 8).\n3D diagram\n\t\nClick 3D diagram to generate a 3D figure of the trial.\nExport raw data by right-clicking 3D coordinates/Export.\n\t\nRight-click the 3D coordinate file and select Export.\nOpen the file in a spreadsheet software and import the data into MATLAB.\nCreate a program to create plots of limb step height coordination.\n\t\tNOTE: 3D coordinate data can be exported into analysis softwares or custom defined macro scripts to generate more data, beyond what the software features offers."
