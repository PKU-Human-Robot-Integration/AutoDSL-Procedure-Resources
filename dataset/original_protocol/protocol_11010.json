  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins University, where the original study6 was performed.\n1.Creating Stimuli\nCreate an initial list of concrete nouns from which prime-target pairs will be made.\nFrom a selected corpus such as Subtlex19, select approximately 500 concrete nouns and obtain variables of interest (e.g., frequency, length, concreteness, imageability, etc.) for each word.\n\t\tNOTE: Other corpuses, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) Psycholinguistic Database18 or Corpus of Contemporary American English20, can also be used. Subtlex was used in the original study because this database is just a large Excel file and thereby easily allows for searching for stimulus generation. Other corpuses have different graphical interfaces and may require the user to input a specific text string into an input box and check the variables of interest being requested.\nPerform latent semantic analysis (LSA) between stimuli to establish semantic relatedness\nSelect LSA method or tool. A useful online tool is provided by Colorado University Boulder (http://lsa.colorado.edu/).\n\t\t\nFrom the main landing site, click on Matrix Comparison.\nEnter individual words to compare, separated by a blank line.\nClick Submit Texts.\nUsing a spreadsheet, create a matrix of LSA values between each word and every other.\nDivide stimuli into related and unrelated conditions based on LSA (Figure 1A).\nManually select 200 word pairs with high LSA values (approximately 0.5 or higher)for the \"related\" condition.\nManually select 200 word pairs with low LSA values (approximately 0.1 or lower) for the \"unrelated\" condition.",
    "NOTE: The experimenter may need to manually inspect word pairs to ensure that the semantic relation makes sense for the category. Some word pairs may have high LSA ratings but the semantic relatedness may not be immediately apparent to participants. Similarly, some may have low LSA ratings but may be semantically related in other ways.\nWhen creating related and unrelated pairs, manually match words on frequency, length, and any other variables that have been noted to be relevant in the literature (e.g., direction of association7,8) or that are of interest for the specific study. Match words as closely as possible on the variables of interest (e.g., within 1-2log10 frequency units; within 1-2 letters or syllables).\nDivide stimuli into word and picture modalities (Figure 1A).\nWithin the stimulus file in the spreadsheet, add another column of \"condition\".\nIn the \"condition\" column, label 100 of the related pairs and 100 of the unrelated pairs as \"picture\" condition. Label the other remaining stimuli as \"word\" condition.\nObtain picture stimuli.\n\tNOTE: Picture stimuli may be obtained from online sources (e.g., Google image searches) or from other sources available to the experimenter.\n\t\nSelect 2–3 pictures to represent each word.\nPerform initial pilot testing by having one or more independent raters (e.g., students, research assistants who have not been involved in stimulus development) decide which picture best represents the concept.\n\t\t\nOpen all potential picture files at once using a photo viewer program, then read the word aloud and ask the rater to choose the most representative picture. Record each rater's responses for every word.\nFor each word, identify the picture that the majority of raters selected as best representing the concept, and use this file as the stimulus for that word. If no majority exists, select a different array of pictures and repeat step 1.5.",
    "Using GIMP (or another photo editing program of choice), scale pictures to all be the same size (approximately 400 pixels or 3–5 inches height or width).\n\t\tNOTE: The precise size of the pictures may differ depending on the size of the monitor stimuli will be presented on. Horizontal and visual angle of the stimuli should be between 7 and 13°.\nPerform pilot testing\nPilot test word and picture pairs by asking 3–4 independent raters (e.g., students, research assistants who have not been involved in stimulus development) to rate each pair as related or unrelated.\n\t\t\nProgram the experiment in E-Prime (or other stimulus presentation program of choice) to present both words on the screen at once, either one above the other or side by side. Ask participants to rate the words as related or unrelated by pressing a button (e.g., 1 for related, 2 for unrelated). See the E-Prime manual21 for details on how to program an experiment in this software package.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Pilot testing can take place in the lab where the experimental testing will take place, or at any computer running the stimulus presentation program. No special room is required.\nRepeat pilot testing (with new independent raters who have not seen the stimuli) until a set of words and pictures is obtained with reliable ratings of related and unrelated. Obtain a total of 100 related word pairs, 100 unrelated word pairs, 100 related picture pairs, and 100 unrelated picture pairs.",
    "NOTE: It has been suggested that investigators using the N400 component to investigate cognition in clinical populations collect a minimum of 40 usable trials per trial type to elicit a reliable effect22. Anticipating that some trials will be lost during the data cleaning process, the number of trials included in the paradigm should be increased. In prior work using this specific paradigm 6, 100 trials per trial type was more than enough to ensure robust N400 effects on both an individual and group basis. Because the N400 component is similar between words and pictures10, this estimated number of trial types is recommended to be kept consistent between modalities.\nRetain an additional 8 pairs (4 words, 4 pictures) for a practice session (see step 2.2.1below)\n2. Task Programming\nCreate stimuli lists.\nFrom the final set of stimuli, sort stimuli into 8 blocks. Modality (picture/word) should be blocked (4 blocks each).\nWithin each block, ensure an equal number of related and unrelated stimuli.\nManually pseudo-randomize presentation lists within each block such that there are no more than 5 related or unrelated stimuli in a row, and pairs next to each other are not semantically related. Avoid trials such as \"carrot-broccoli\", \"apple-pear\" immediately next to each other.\nProgram the task using E-Prime, or other stimulus presentation software of choice.\n\tNOTE: Steps described here are specific to E-Prime and NetStation, and will differ if another stimulus presentation software or EEG acquisition software is used. Please see the E-Prime manual21 and the E-Prime Extensions for NetStation tutorial23 for more specific details on how to program an EEG experiment in this software package and how to enable communication between E-Prime and NetStation.\n\t\nProgram two practice sessions for the picture and word blocks (4 pairs each), to be performed before the experimental testing begins.",
    "Program an instruction screen at the beginning of the practice session to read: \"You will see two words presented on the screen one after the other. Please try to sit as still as possible and do not blink while the words are being presented. After the pair is presented, you will see a black cross on the screen. When you see the black cross, please indicate if the words were related or not. Press button 1 if the words ARE related. Press button 2 if the words are NOT related. Press any key to start the practice session.\"\nFor each of the word stimuli, double-click on the TextDisplay icons in the experiment structure. Click the Properties icon at the top left. Under the Font tab, select Courier New font size 28. Under the General tab, select ForeColor as black and BackColor as white to present the words in black font on a white background.\n\t\tNOTE: The specific font size may need to be amended depending on the size and resolution of the monitor used for presentation. Horizontal visual angle of the words should be between 1 and 6°.\nFor each of the picture stimuli, double-click on the Slide icons in the experiment structure. Click the Properties icon at the top left. Under the General tab, select BackColor as white to present pictures on a white background.",
    "Program each trial to present the following stimuli in this order: a red pre-trial fixation cross (400 ms); stimulus 1 (1,000 ms); interstimulus interval (blank white screen; 300 ms); stimulus 2 (1,000 ms); blank screen (400 ms); intertrial interval (black fixation cross; randomly jittered between 1,000–1,400 ms in 100 ms intervals, average 1200 ms); see Figure 1B. To set durations, double-click the TextDisplay or Slide icons in the experiment structure and hit the Properties button on the top-left of the window. Set the duration under the Duration/Input tab.\n\t\tNOTE: The blank screen is included before the intertrial interval to provide a visual break between the second stimulus and the black cross, and to provide a subtle prompt for the upcoming semantic relatedness judgment.\nProgram a TextDisplay object called \"Break\" after each block is completed saying \"End of block, please take a break\"\nInclude parameters for communication between E-Prime and NetStation. See the E-Prime Extensions for NetStation manual23 for specific instructions on how to include this information.\nFor each \"word1\" or \"word2\" Text Display object, select the object in the Experiment structure. Under the \"Properties\" window, set the Tag as \"WRD1\" or \"WRD2\", respectively.\nFor each \"picture1\" or \"picture2\" Slide object, set the Tag as \"PIC1\" or \"PIC2\", respectively.\nUnder \"Unreferenced E-Objects\", create a new List called \"CellList\". Enter the cell numbers as: 1 = picture related; 2 = picture unrelated; 3 = word related; 4 = word unrelated. Within the trial list for each block, include a column called \"CellNumber\" and enter the corresponding cell numbers for each trial according to condition and modality.\n3. EEG Testing\nNOTE: The specific procedures described here are for an EGI system. Procedures may differ if other systems are used.\nPrepare for EEG testing.",
    "Mix 2 teaspoons (10 g) of potassium chloride with 1 quart (1 L) of water and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of baby shampoo in a clear plastic bucket to create electrolyte solution\nMeasure circumference of participant's head, passing through the inion and nasion, to determine appropriate net size. Select the appropriate sized net according to the participant's head circumference.\nImmerse the electrodes in the electrolyte solution, ensuring that all sponges are fully submerged, and let soak for at least 5 minutes.\nApply EEG net.\nHave participant sit comfortably in a chair, facing the experimenter. Explain to the participant that you will be putting the net on now, then will adjust it and check the signal before beginning the test.\nPlace towels around participant's shoulders. Instruct participant close their eyes, then apply net to participant's head. Adjust the net and tighten ties to ensure a snug fit to participant's head.\nWork through all electrodes to seat them against the scalp. Use a sweeping motion with the electrode to move hair away. Rewet sponges using a pipette if necessary.\nOnce all electrodes have been seated, check impedances. Reseat or rewet any electrodes with impedances above 50 kiloohms (kΩ).\nRun semantic priming experiment during EEG recording.\nOnce the net is applied, impedances have been checked, and the participant is ready to begin, start the semantic priming task.\nReiterate the instructions to participants before testing. Instruct participants to judge whether the word or picture stimuli are related or unrelated by pressing a button on a keyboard or button-box. To avoid motor artifacts confounding the EEG signal, instruct participants to wait to make their response until the second stimulus has disappeared from the screen and the black cross has appeared.\nRun the practice session at least once to ensure that participants understand the task.",
    "After every 2 blocks, during the break, rewet electrodes and recheck impedances.\n4. EEG Preprocessing\nOpen NetStation Tools.\n\tNOTE: The steps described here are specific to preprocessing in NetStation 5. See the NetStation 5 User Manual24 for more details on how to use NetStation Tools. Other preprocessing packages may include EEGlab, ERPlab, FieldTrip, or other software of the experimenter's choice. Note that preferred order of preprocessing steps may differ between software packages. Observation of an N400 effect should not differ based on choice of analysis package.\nFilter the data.\nAt the bottom of the NetStation Tools window, create a new filtering tool by selecting \"Filtering\" in the 'Create' drop-down menu. Rename the tool appropriately.\nSet the highpass filter to 0.1 Hertz (Hz) and the lowpass filter to 50 Hz.\n\t\tNOTE: The highpass filter can be lower than 0.1 Hz but it is not advised to exceed this cutoff, to avoid risk of introducing spurious effects25. A lowpass filter as low as 30 Hz can be used.\nSave the tool, then drag the original EEG recording file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nSegment the data into trials.\nCreate a new \"Segmentation\" tool and name it appropriately.\nUnder \"Categories to create\", hit the plus sign to create a new category and rename it \"picture related\". Drag the \"Code\" icon into the \"Create category based on criteria\" box and set it as \"Code is PIC1\" to time-lock to the presentation of stimulus 1. Drag the \"Key Code\" icon into the \"Create category\" box and set it as \"Key Code cel# is 1\".\n\t\t\nTo include only correct trials, drag another \"Key Code\" icon into the \"Create category\" box and set it as \"Key Code eval is 1\".",
    "At the bottom of the window, set the segment length to \"Extend segment 100 ms before and 2,300 ms after\".\n\t\tNOTE: Segments may be time-locked to the onset of either the first or second stimulus. If locked to the first stimulus, segments should extend 100 ms before to 2300 ms after (to include presentation duration of both stimuli (1,000 ms each) plus inter-stimulus interval (ISI) time (300 ms)). If locked to the second stimulus, segments should extend 100 ms before to 1,000 ms after.\nClone the category by hitting the \"Clone\" button and rename it \"picture unrelated\". Set the Code to PIC1 and the Key Code cel# to 2.\nClone the category and rename it \"word related\". Set the Code to WRD1 and the Key Code cel# to 3.\nClone the category and rename it \"word unrelated\". Set the Code to WRD1 and the Key Code cel# to 4.\nSave the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nPerform artifact detection.\nCreate a new \"Artifact Detection\" tool and name it appropriately.\nUnder \"Artifact Detection Settings\", hit the plus sign at the bottom of the window to add a new setting. Select \"Bad Channels\" from the dropdown menu under \"Operation\". Leave all of the default settings (max-min > 200 microvolts (µV); Entire segment; Moving average of 80 ms).\nAdd a new setting and select \"Eye Blink\" from the \"Operation\" dropdown menu. Leave all of the default settings (max-min > 140 µV; window size 640 ms; moving average of 80 ms).\nAdd a new setting and select \"Eye Movement\" from the \"Operation\" dropdown menu. Leave all of the default settings (max-min > 55 µV; window size 640 ms; moving average of 80 ms).",
    "Save the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nOpen the resulting file in NetStation Review and scroll through every trial by hitting the arrow buttons under the \"Categories\" menu on the right side-bar. Mark trials as good or bad by hitting the green or red circles, respectively. When done, close the file to save the results.\nPerform bad channel replacement.\nCreate a new \"Bad Channel Replacement\" tool and name it appropriately. No parameters need to be set by the user for this tool, so save the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nPerform single-subject averaging to collapse over trials.\nCreate a new \"Averaging\" tool and name it appropriately. Under \"Averaging Settings\", select \"Handle source files: Together\" and \"Handle subjects: Separately\".\nSave the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nReference data to the average reference26.\n\tNOTE: The average reference is used here because EGI provides dense-array EEG (128 and 256 channels). It has been suggested that an average reference be used with dense-array recording systems26; other semantic priming ERP studies using 128-channel or 256-channel nets have used the average reference6,27,28. Other reference choices include the average of the right and left mastoids, the nose, or the earlobe29. There is no optimal choice of reference electrode, and the experimenter should note that choice of the reference electrode may affect the resulting ERP waveforms26,29.\n\t\nCreate a new \"Montage Operations\" tool and name it appropriately.",
    "Select the appropriate net from the dropdown menu under \"List Montages for Sensor Layout\". Select \"Average Reference\" and make sure the \"Exclude bad channels from reference\" box is selected. Save the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nPerform baseline correction using the first 100 ms of the segment10,28.\n\tNOTE: A baseline period of 200 ms can also be used29.\n\t\nCreate a new \"Baseline Correction\" tool and name it appropriately.\nUnder \"Baseline Correction Settings\", select \"Select baseline from portion of segment\", \"Select baseline with respect to segment time = 0\", and \"Baseline begins 100 ms before time zero and is 100 ms long\".\nSave the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57217/57217fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental examples and timeline.
