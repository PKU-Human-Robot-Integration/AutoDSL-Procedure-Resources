  "procedures": [
    "1. Polarization Microscopy\nFor widefield laser illumination, focus a 638 nm line of a continuous diode laser (40 mW) on the aperture of multimode optical fiber for beam cleanup. Mount a linear polarizer at the output of the fiber to set the polarization of laser light.\nBlock the excitation component of the emitted light with a dichroic mirror (640 nm cut-off) and a bandpass filter (bandpass 700/75).\nLet the fluorescence signal pass through a polarizing beam splitter, which splits the emitted light into its perpendicular and parallel polarized components. Then, focus the non-reflected beam (parallel component) and the reflected beam (perpendicular component) with an achromatic lens of 200 mm focal length on the chip of a back-illuminated EM-CCD camera (Figure 1b and 1c). Use a mirror to adjust the direction of the perpendicular beam toward the lens.\n2. Design and Testing of Fluorescent-Labelled Reference DNA Oligomer\nDetermine the core sequence of the reference DNA: the method is based on a competitive assay that measures the dissociation constant (KD2) between a transcription factor and unlabeled competitor DNA oligomer that competes for binding with a fluorescently labeled DNA whose affinity to the TF acts as a references (KD1). The consensus sequence obtained from other sources like DNase footprinting or bacterial 1-hybrid can serve as a starting point5,15.\n\tNOTE: As a rule of thumb, a suitable reference DNA has a 3 to 7-fold decrease in binding affinity to the TF compared to the consensus sequence.\nMeasure by HiP-FA the KD1s of 2-3 tentative single mutations of the consensus sequence derived in the previous step. Try to mutate positions in consensus sequence that are not too specific to avoid complete loss of binding.",
    "NOTE: It is important that the reference sequence is bound by the transcription factor of interest (we used in this protocol Giant Gt), but not too strongly, so that weaker competitors can outcompete it at high concentrations.\nExtend the core motif (8-12 base pairs generally) to a length of 16 base pairs or more by adding symmetrically flanking sequence at both sides (add side chains for proper binding). If necessary (for longer biding domains, for example), use longer sequences (up to ~50 base pairs in length were tested with the HiP-FA assay).\n\tCAUTION: Be careful not to add bases that are expected to create ectopic binding sites. Use computational tools that predict binding sites from available PWMs to facilitate this process (e.g., PySite22).\nAs labeled reference DNA, order oligomers that are fluorescently labeled on either forward or reverse strand at the 3' or 5' end. Use, for example Cy5, Bodipy-650 or any other suitable dye at a concentration of 10 µM (100 µM 10x stock) in water, and dilute stepwise as described in step 3.1.\nPrepare 500 mL of 1x binding buffer by adding 33 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0), 90 mM NaCl, and 0.01% non-ionic detergent in distilled water. Also prepare 3x binding buffer, which contains the same components, except at threefold concentrations. If using 3x binding buffer as stock solution for the 1x binding buffer, prepare volumes > 500 mL; otherwise, prepare 250 mL.\n\tNOTE: This composition was optimized for transcription factor stability and to prevent glutathione S-transferase (GST) dimerization.",
    "Measure with the microscopy setup described in step 1 the FA of 200 µL of binding buffer containing 0.8 nM labeled reference DNA in the presence of different amount of TF in a glass bottom microscopy 96-well plate (5-6 wells with different TF concentrations) to determine the TF concentration to use. Perform a titration series with increasing amounts of TF and choose for the assay the concentration for which the curve reaches a plateau, indicating complete binding of the DNA reference oligomer.\n\tNOTE: The optimal TF concentration depends on the values of the TF-DNA dissociation constants. Generally, lower KDs require lower concentrations.\n3. Oligomer Annealing\nTo anneal the DNA oligomers of the labeled reference DNA (sequence determined in the previous step), mix 7 µL of a 10 mM dye-labeled forward single-stranded DNA solution and 7 µL of a 10 mM concentration of its unlabeled reverse complement in 186 µL of water.\nFor the competitor DNA sequences, mix 20 µL of 100 mM solutions (in water, provided by the manufacturer) of forward single-stranded DNA with 20 µL of 100 mM of the corresponding reverse single-stranded DNA for each individual competitor sequence to be measured.\nPerform the annealing separately in a standard PCR cycler by heating up the solutions to 70 °C for 3 min and decreasing the temperature to RT at a rate of 0.1 K/s. If the PCR machine used does not support temperature gradients at that rate, simply do stepwise incubations with decreasing temperatures (tested were 99 cycles of 3 s with -0.4 K per cycle).\n4. Gel Preparation",
    "NOTE: The following section explains the preparation of two different kind of gels: 1) the titration wells contain gels with protein and are used to determine the KDs for the respective competitor DNA sequences, and 2) the calibration wells make use of NB to determine the DNA concentration at every given time point and acquisition height. The focus is on the preparation of the experiment in a 96-well plate, but the corresponding volumes for a 384-well plate format are also indicated.\nDissolve 0.5% w/v low melting point agarose in the binding buffer by boiling it in a laboratory microwave oven. After complete dissolution, adjust the volume again with ddH2O to compensate for possible evaporation.\n\tNOTE: For convenience, prepare a stock of 10-20 10 mL aliquots of the gels and melt them at 75°C when they are needed. Gel stocks can be stored at RT.\n\tCAUTION: Be careful to avoid superheating of the gel solution in the microwave oven. Short heating time intervals with shaking in between are preferable.\nTo prepare titration and calibration wells, first melt two 10 mL gel stock aliquots at 75 °C under shaking.\n\t\nUse 240 µL (including 20% overhead) for each competitor (n = number of competitor sequences).\nUse the same volume of gel for the NB calibration well to ensure an equal temperature and viscosity of both gels.\nThen set the temperature to 35 °C and wait for the temperature to equilibrate.",
    "For the titration wells, add 1.4 nM (final concentration) hybridized reference DNA (obtained in step 3), TF protein (final concentration CTF = 20-60 nM, as determined in step 2.6), DTT (0.2 mM), and binding buffer in a total volume of n x 200 µL or n x 13 µL in a 96- or 384-well plate format, respectively (plus overhead). Mix thoroughly by inverting/shaking (do not vortex).\nSlowly add 200 µL per well in 96-well plate format (13 µL/well for 386 wells) of the gel solution prepared in the previous step into the titration wells the well plate.\nFor the calibration wells, first add 5 nM NB to the melted gel outside the wells (total volume depending on the well plate format used and on the number of calibration wells; usually 5-6 per well plate is enough).\nPipette 200 µL (13 µL for 384-well plate format) of NB containing gel slowly within the titration wells of the well plate and make sure to avoid air bubbles.\n\tNOTE: The usage of electronic pipets or robotics significantly increases reproducibility.\nLet the gel solidify for 10 min at RT, and another 10 min at 4 °C (remove condensation from the glass afterwards if necessary). Make sure to conduct all these steps on a perfectly horizontal surface to avoid inhomogeneous gel surfaces.\n\tNOTE: The protein containing gels are usually stable for at least several hours at 4 °C.\n5. Adding the Competitor DNA Solution\nNOTE: The following solutions should be prepared before starting the titration and are added on top of the calibration and titration wells simultaneously.\nAdd the annealed labeled reference DNA and protein in 3x binding buffer at 3 times higher concentrations than the gel stock aliquots.",
    "Mix 20 µL of the obtained solution with 40 µL of each annealed competitor DNA solution obtained in step 3.\nFor each calibration well, mix 20 µL of 3x binding buffer containing 15 mM NB solution with 40 µL of annealed competitor DNA (any sequence of the same length is suitable).\n\t\tNOTE: For the 384-well plates, use 21 µL instead of 60 µL in total.\nOptionally, check the homogeneity of the gel height levels in the different wells of the plate spectroscopically by measuring the absorbance at 380 nm, using a multi-well plate reader (the absorbance values are proportional to the gel heights).\nAdd 50 µL (7 µL for 384-well plate format) of the mixed competitor DNA solutions (annealed in step 3) on top of the gels. Try to add all the competitor solutions as simultaneously as possible by using electronic multichannel pipets or a 96-channel pipetting head, if available. After addition of the competitor solutions, place the plate on the microscope stage and start the measurements immediately (step 7).\n6. Image Acquisition\nSequentially acquire times series of z-stacks (e.g., use 12 planes and 100-300 ms of illumination time). Avoid taking images too close to the well surface (< ~1.4 µm with the plates used herein) to exclude any polarization bias.\nPerform 10-25 cycles of measurements until complete unbinding of the labeled reference DNA from the TF. The endpoint is typically reached after 1-2 h, depending on the binding kinetics and diffusivity of the competitor DNA.\n7. Extraction of FA(z,t) from Raw Data\nOnce a well plate has been imaged, compute from the raw fluorescence images the average pixel values of regions of interest for the parallel (I=) and perpendicularly (I+) polarized intensity components (Figure 1c). This can be done automatically using the HiP-FA software23.",
    "NOTE: The HiP-FA software, an instruction manual, and a test dataset can be downloaded23. Alternatively, use any other custom-written software to extract I= and I+ and perform the downstream analysis of the titration curves, as described in detail below.\nCalculate FA for each well. For each well, the script computes FA(z,t) at each z-position and time point t according to:\n\tEquation 1:   imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq1.jpg\n\tWhere G is the instrument G-factor that corrects for any bias toward the perpendicular channel.\nDetermine the G-factor of the microscopy setup by measuring the FA of any solutions containing a fluorescent dye of known anisotropy. Extract the two polarization components of the signal and then use Equation 1 to obtain G, knowing the FA of the solution (G = 1.15 in this setup).\n8. Calibration Curve for Determination of Competitor DNA Concentration from FANB\nAnneal 120 µL of each forward and reverse reference oligomer (100 mM stock concentration; any random sequence with the same length as the competitor sequence can be used) and mix with 120 µL of 3x binding buffer containing NB (15 nM).\nPrepare a dilution series with 1:2 dilutions in 1x binding buffer with 6 dilutions in total. Mix 50 µL of these dilutions with 200 µL of 0.5% low melting point agarose (T > 35 °C) gel in 1x binding buffer containing 5 nM of NB in triplicates.\nAdd 200 µL of each of the 6 solutions prepared in the previous step in a 96-well plate and store the plate for 1 h at 4 °C to ensure complete gelation, then 1 h at RT. Measure the FANB of the solutions by using the HiP-FA setup.\nExtract FANB (z,t) according to the previous step and fit the data using a Hill equation:\n\tEquation 2:   imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq2.jpg",
    "Where CDNA is the concentration of the DNA oligomer; k the concentration of the DNA oligomers at which half of the binding sites are occupied; FAmax is a normalization constant; and n is the Hill coefficient. k, FAmax, and n are set as free parameters during the fitting procedure.\nEnter the three parameters obtained from the fitting procedure in the HiP-FA software (in the left lower panel).\nRepeat the determination of the calibration curve every few months or after making changes in the microscopy setup.\n9. Determination of Competitor DNA Concentrations\nUse the HiP-FA software to extract c(z,t) from the FANB(z,t) measurements (Figure 3). First obtain the calibration curve as described in the previous section and enter the fitting parameters to the software (see manual for details).\nUse the program to automatically extrapolate c(z,t) for c < 100 nM (see manual for details) using Equation 3 (Figure 3b), which describes the one-dimensional diffusion of the competitor DNA within the agarose gel matrix, assuming free diffusion.\n\tEquation 3:   imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq3.jpg\n\tWhere C0 is the initial concentration of the competitor DNA; erf is the error function; z is the position; D is the diffusion coefficient of the competitor DNA; and t0 is the starting time of the measurements. The free parameters used are C0 and z/imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq4.jpg.\n10. Conventional Competitive Titration with HIP-FA for Very Strong DNA Binding",
    "Serially dilute the different competitor DNA oligomers in the rows of a 96-well plate (or 384-well plate) at the concentrations of: 0, 1.25, 3.5, 9, 19, 45, 90, 190, 425, 900, 1900, and 4000 nM. Add the Cy5-labeled reference DNA (1 nM) and TF (20-50 nM) at a constant concentration, with a total volume of 200 µL per well in binding buffer (Figure 5a). Wait 40 min until thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved and acquire (with the HiP-FA setup) z-stacks for each well (acquiring several images per well reduces variability by averaging the calculated FA values).\nConstruct the equilibrium binding titration curves and fit them with Equation 4 (Figure 5b). The KDs determined by conventional competitive titration are identical to those obtained by HIP-FA using an agarose gel matrix20.\n11. Fitting Procedure of the FA Titration Curves\nDisplay in the HiP-FA software the reconstructed titration curves for the individual competitor sequences FA(z,t) = f[c(z,t)] and visually check the data quality (see manual for details). If needed, refine the parameters used for the determination of the competitor DNA concentrations in step 10.\nFit each individual titration curve automatically using Equation 4, which gives an analytical solution for competitive titration assays24.\n\tEquation 4:   imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq5.jpg\n\tWith:    imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq6.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq7.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq8.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58763/58763eq9.jpg\n\tWhere RT is the protein concentration; LT is the unlabeled and LST is the labeled DNA concentration; KD2 is the dissociation constant to be determined; RT is the concentration of active protein; and A and B are normalization parameters.\n\tFirst determine KD1, which serves as a reference for the determination of the different KD2 values. KD1 is can be readily determined with the assay by choosing the sequence of dye-reference DNA as the sequence of the unlabeled competitor DNA (see manual).",
    "Enter the obtained value of KD1 in the software and compute the KD2 values for all the competitor DNA on the plate.\n\tNOTE: The free parameters of the fitting procedure are KD2, RT, A, and B.\nExport the dissociation constant KD2 and concentration of active protein RT for all the individual titration wells of the plate by clicking the \"Export\" button in the software.\n12.
