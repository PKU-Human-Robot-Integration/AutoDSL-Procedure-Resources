    "The animal protocol has been approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Record number: 2020-34). Female C57BL/6J mice (12-week old, n = 14) were divided into two groups randomly, a sham-operated group (Sham group, n = 7) and a model group (OVX group, n = 7). Animals were purchased from a commercial supplier (see Table of Materials). All mice were kept in individual cages at 22-26 °C with 45%-55% humidity, allowed to adapt to their new environment for 1 week, and provided free access to water and diet. All animal experimental studies were conducted at Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.\n1. Animal model preparation\nAnesthetize the 12-week-old mouse by intraperitoneal injection with 1.25% Avertin (Tribromoethanol in tert-amyl alcohol, see Table of Materials) at a dosage of 0.02 mL/g. Position the mouse prone on a sterile surgical operating table, and immobilize its limbs by taping them securely.\nUse scissors (see Table of Materials) to trim any hair that may affect the surgical operation.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to avoid skin damage while preparing the surgical site.\nWash hands thoroughly and put on surgical gloves. Disinfect the mouse's back three times with povidone-iodine (see Table of Materials), and use medical gauze (see Table of Materials) to dry it off.\n\tNOTE: Be cautious; getting the hair too wet during disinfection may lead to postoperative hypothermia in mice.",
    "Make an incision approximately 0.5-1.0 cm long, located 1 cm away from one-third of the midline of the mouse's back, using a scalpel (see Table of Materials). Gently separate the fascia and cut through the muscle with tissue scissors (see Table of Materials) until the ovary is visible. Ligate the surrounding blood vessels with non-absorbable sutures (see Table of Materials) and remove the ovary.\nRinse the cavity using 0.9% saline solution, then suture the skin, muscle, and fascia separately (see Table of Materials).\nRepeat the same sequence of steps on the other side.\nRemove peri-ovarian fat of the same size as the ovary, and perform the same surgery procedure mentioned above for the remaining steps to establish the sham-operated model.\nAllow a recovery period of 1 week after the surgery. After 8 weeks, osteoporotic mouse models will be successfully established9,10.\n2. Micro-CT scanning\nEuthanize the mouse by excess CO2 inhalation. Remove as much soft tissue as possible from the mouse femur after euthanasia and obtain a fresh sample for scanning.\n\tNOTE: While there is no perfect solution for sample preservation, certain steps can be taken to maximize the quality of Micro-CT scan results. Before fixation, take care to remove as much surrounding tissue as possible. Formalin or buffered formalin is the most preferred method of fixation with storage in PBS11,12.\nDouble-click the micro-CT imaging system software icon on the desktop to start the system (see Table of Materials). Select a sample bed compatible with the sample field of view (FOV) of 18 mm x 18 mm. Load the appropriate sample bed into the machine and close the hatch.\nClick the Warm-up button in the Control Panel.",
    "NOTE: A short warm-up time was required. Do not attempt to open the hatch when X-rays are being generated. Check the X-Ray On light on the front panel and computer monitor to confirm if X-rays are being generated.\nClick the Menu button to set a new database, then create a new sample and study.\nSelect Manual from the Menu drop-down list and enter custom voltage and current values in the Control Panel. Set Voltage (kV) to 90, Current (µA) to 80, Scan Mode to High resolution, 14 min, and FOV (mm) to 18 mm x 18 mm.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the manual for different micro CT systems to set the appropriate parameters.\nPosition the bone securely with plastic film in the sample bed. Close the hatch. Ensure that the subject is centered precisely in the X-capture window by pressing the adjustment buttons on the machine.\n\tNOTE: Adjusting the sample must be slow and gentle to avoid it falling into the machine by accident.\nClick the Start button to start the CT scan.\n3. CT data analysis\nEnter the software (see Table of Materials), and select the data to be analyzed. Click Sub and set Pixel Size to 10 µm. Move and resize the region of interest (ROI) to include the distal femur above the growth plate. Click on Start (see Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The subvolume reconstruction pixel size was selected at 10 µm since the thickness of the imaging trabeculae was estimated to be about 20-30 µm based on histological data from previous studies13. If the signal-to-noise ratio is insufficient for data processing, a high-resolution 1 h scan must be performed.\nClick the Analysis 3D button to get the resulting 3D reconstruction.\nExport the data from the micro-CT system to the computer for analysis.",
    "Import the reconstructed CT data. Click Process > Image Calculator, then click Region Pad > Interactive. Adjust the yellow checkbox to the appropriate ROI.\n\tNOTE: The region of interest (ROI) begins approximately 540 µm proximal to the growth plate and extends 1600 µm proximally to assess the actual bone metabolism and remodeling.\nSelect the Bone Microarchitecture Analysis (BMA) add-on (see Table of Materials). Click Segment Cortex and then Segment Trabeculae.\n\tNOTE: Both trabecular and cortical boneare automatically selected. Normally no manual adjustment is required.\nClick on Save Final Object Map and then click Measure Bone to calculate bone morphometric indices.\n\t​NOTE: Only relative bone mineral density (BMD) was calculated here since no control was added.\n4. Decalcification of bone tissue\nFix the bone specimens in 4% paraformaldehyde (see Table of Materials) for 24 h. Wash the specimens thrice with PBS (see Table of Materials) for 20 min each time.\nRinse the tissue thrice with distilled water for 20 min each time. Transfer the tissue to a decalcification solution containing EDTA (see Table of Materials) and decalcify for 30 days with a weekly solution change until endpoint.\n\tNOTE: Needle pricking, hand pinching, and clamping are used to terminate decalcification when the bone tissue becomes soft, or there is no sense of resistance when needling. The physical method of detection can cause some damage to the tissue structure, so try to avoid excessive force or repeated testing.\nTake the tissue out of the fixative and use a scalpel to trim the tissue in a fume hood. Put the trimmed tissue and the corresponding label in a dehydration box.",
    "Put the dehydration box in a basket and dehydrate it in a tissue processor (see Table of Materials) with gradient alcohol (75% ethanol for 4 h, 85% ethanol for 2 h, 90% ethanol for 2 h, 95% ethanol for 1 h, anhydrous ethanol for 30 min, anhydrous ethanol II for 30 min, xylene I for 5-10 min, xylene II for 5-10 min, wax I for 1 h, wax II for 1 h, wax III for 1 h).\nUse an embedding machine (see Table of Materials) to embed the wax-soaked tissue. Pour the melted wax into an embedding box and place the tissue from the dehydration box before the wax hardens.\nOrient the tissue according to the embedding surface and attach the corresponding label. Cool on a -20 °C freezing table (see Table of Materials). Remove the wax block from the embedding box after solidifying and trim the wax block as needed (see Table of Materials).\nCut the trimmed wax block into 3 µm thick slides on a microtome (see Table of Materials). Float the slides on 40 °C warm water on a tissue spreading machine (see Table of Materials) to flatten the tissue and scoop them up with a slide.\nBake in a 60 °C oven (see Table of Materials) until the water evaporates and the wax melts. Take out and store at room temperature (RT) for later use.\n5. HE staining\nPut the slides in xylene I for 20 min, then in xylene II for 20 min. Further, put the slides in anhydrous ethanol I and anhydrous ethanol II for 5 min each, 75% alcohol for 5 min, and then wash the slides with tap water (see Table of Materials).",
    "Incubate in hematoxylin (see Table of Materials) for 3-5 min. Differentiate the specimens with a hydrochloric acid solution (see Table of Materials). Treat the slides with an ammonia solution (see Table of Materials) for bluing, and then wash the slides with water.\nPut the slides in 85%, 95% gradient alcohol for dehydration, and stain with eosin solution (see Table of Materials) for 5 min.\nPut the slides in anhydrous ethanol I for 5 min, anhydrous ethanol II for 5 min, and anhydrous ethanol III for 5 min. Treat the slides with xylene I for 5 min, xylene II for 5 min, and mount with neutral balsam (see Table of Materials).\nExamine each slide under the microscope. Then, choose the representative slices for panoramic scanning (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: At least three consecutive slices are required for each sample. Before panoramic scanning, the slices must be examined under a microscope to ensure that they are complete and clear. Ensure that the bone marrow cavity, cortical bone, and cancellous bone are fully displayed and that different types of bone cells can be seen.\n6. HE image analysis\nOpen HE images with CaseViewer software (see Table of Materials). Select the region of interest (ROI) on the slide, and save it as a color image.\n\tNOTE: The selection of ROI is consistent with the above-mentioned software.\nOpen the image in ImageJ (see Table of Materials). Select the Wand tool from the toolbar. Click on the trabecular bone.\nAdjust the tolerance and contiguous settings as needed. Go to Image > Adjustments > Black & White and click OK. Repeat the steps for other areas of the bone.\nInvert the selection and fill it with white color. Save the image as a mask for analysis (see Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: For the detailed methodology, refer to the previously published work14.\nOpen the mask in the analysis software15,16 (see Table of Materials). Run Process > Binary > Make Binary to convert the color image to a binary image.\nUse plugin17 (see Table of Materials) in the software to analyze structural parameters: Run Area/Volume Fraction to calculate bone volume to total volume of bone (BV/TV [%])18,19.\n\tNOTE: This method is applicable for bone trabeculae and bone marrow, filling the entire ROI in the HE images.\nSubscription Required.
