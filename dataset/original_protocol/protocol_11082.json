    "An overview of the protocol described here is depicted in Figure 1.\n1. Plasmid construction\npCAGGS-Cre: This plasmid was provided by Dr. E. Makeyev21.\npRD-miR-17-92:\n\t\nAmplify pre-miR-17-92 by PCR using 0.5 µM of each specific primer (Table of Materials), 150 ng of cDNA, 1 mM dNTPs, 1x Taq PCR buffer, and 5 U of high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase. Perform a no-template control PCR reaction (use water instead of cDNA) to check for DNA contamination.\nLigate the PCR product into pRD-RIPE (kindly provided by Dr. E. Makeyev, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)21 inside the intron between the EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites using DNA ligase, creating pRD-miR-17-92. Confirm sequence integrity by Sanger sequencing.\npmiRGLO-RAP-IB\n\t\nDesign forward and reverse primers flanked by XhoI/XbaI restriction sites and with one NotI restriction site inside. Mix equimolar amounts of forward and reverse primers and incubate the mixture at 90 °C for 5 min, then transfer to 37 °C for 15 min. As controls, use primers with scrambled target sequences (Table of Materials).\nCleave the annealed fragments using XhoI/XbaI restriction enzymes and ligate them downstream of the luc2 sequence into pmiR-GLO, generating pmiRGLO-RAP-IB-3ʹ-UTR (Luc-RAP-1B) and pmiRGLO-scrambled-3ʹ-UTR (Luc-scrambled) reporter constructs. Confirm ligation with NotI cleavage.\n\t\t​NOTE: Ensure that the overhangs created after primer annealing are complementary to the vector after cleavage reaction.\npFLAG-HuR\n\t\nTo generate a HuR over-expressing plasmid, amplify the HuR sequence with specific primers. Mix 300 ng of cDNA, 0.5 µM of each specific primer, 1 mM dNTPs mix, 1x PCR buffer, and 5 U of high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase.\nLigate the PCR product into pGEM-T and confirm the DNA sequence integrity by Sanger sequencing. Remove the HuR fragment from pGEM-T and subclone it into pFLAG-CMV-3 mammalian expression vector to generate the pFLAG-HuR vector.\n2. Cell culture",
    "NOTE: The HeLa-Cre cell line was a gift from Dr. E. Makeyev21, and the papillary thyroid cancer cell (BCPAP) was kindly provided by Dr. Massimo Santoro (University \"Federico II\", Naples, Italy). HeLa cell, papillary thyroid cancer cell (BCPAP), and HEK-293T were used to overexpress HuR.\nMaintain the cells in DMEM/high-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 200 mM L-glutamine, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin) in 100 mm Petri dishes, unless otherwise indicated. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified, controlled-atmosphere incubator (5% CO2).\nIncubate adherent cells with trypsin/EDTA (0.5% solution mixture) at 37 °C for 3-5 min. Let them detach from the plate (incubation period can vary according to the cell type).\nPerform transfections with a lipid-based transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure that the cell cultures are approximately 70% confluent. Use similar amounts of DNA for all transfection combinations, as described below, by adding the appropriate DNAs. Perform transfection experiments in replicates.\n\t\nMix 200 ng of DNA and 1.25 µL of transfection reagent in 100 µL of the culture medium. Add the transfection mixture to the cells. Incubate the cells with the transfection mixtures for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, replace the medium with medium containing 10% FBS, and incubate for another 24 h before adding the antibiotics for selection.\n3. HuR overexpression\nTransfect pFLAG-HuR and empty pFLAG into HeLa. Select cells by increasing the concentration of geneticin (G418) (1 µg/mL) from 100 µg/mL to 1000 µg/mL, generating stable cell lines.\nConfirm overexpression with quantitative PCR using specific primers for HuR mRNA, as described in step 7.\n4. Total RNA isolation\nUse freshly collected cells. Trypsinize 70% confluent cell cultures (for this assay, HeLa-Cre cells were used), as described in step 2.2.",
    "Collect the cell pellet by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C and wash it with 1x PBS (phosphate-buffered saline); repeat the centrifugation.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS and transfer it to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C.\nWeigh the dry cell pellet, and adjust the volumes and size of tubes accordingly. 1 mg of cells yields approximately 1 µg of total RNA.\nIn a hood, add 500-1,000 µL of phenol/chloroform to the cell pellet (ideally 750 µL per 0.25 g of cells) and homogenize it by pipetting up and down and mixing with the vortex.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) to allow the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 200 µL of chloroform per 1 mL of phenol:chloroform used. Cap the sample tubes securely.\nMix vigorously for 15 s (by hand or briefly vortexing at a lower speed) and incubate at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) for 2 min to 3 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nCheck for the presence of a lower red phenol-chloroform phase, an intermediary phase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains in the upper aqueous phase. In a hood, collect the aqueous phase, avoiding contacting the intermediary phase, and transfer to a fresh tube.",
    "Precipitate RNA by mixing the aqueous phase with 400 µL of molecular grade isopropanol (1:1 ratio to phenol/chloroform used) and 2 µL of glycogen in each tube (it will help to visualize the presence of the pellet).\nMix vigorously by hand or homogenize with the tip for ~10 s. Incubate for 15 min or overnight at −20 °C.\nCentrifuge the sample at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the RNA pellet by adding 3 volumes of 100% ethanol (approximately 1 mL, diluted using DEPC water) and mix the sample by vortexing until the pellet is released and floats from the bottom.\nCentrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nWash the RNA pellet 1x by adding 1 mL of 75% ethanol and mix the sample by vortexing until the pellet is released and floats from the bottom. Repeat the centrifugation as described in step 4.17.\nPerform an additional 5 s centrifugation spin to collect residual liquid from the side of the tube and remove any residual liquid with a pipette without disturbing the pellet.\nBriefly air-dry the RNA pellet by opening the cap of the tube at room temperature for 3-5 min and dissolve the RNA pellet in 20-50 µL of RNase-free DEPC-treated water. Incubate the RNA for 10 min at 55-60 °C to facilitate resuspension of the pellet.\n5. Determination of total RNA concentration and quality\nDetermine the RNA concentration by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a spectrophotometer. Obtain full-spectral data before using the samples in downstream applications.",
    "Control the RNA quality by resolving 800-1000 ng on a 1.5% agarose gel using 0.5X TBE buffer (45 mM Tris base, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). Total RNA separates into two bands referring to 28S and 18S rRNAs.\n\t\nMake all reagents and wash all equipment used for running the gel with DEPC-treated water. DEPC-treated water is prepared in the hood by adding 1 mL of diethylpyrocarbonate to 1000 mL of ultra-pure water. Incubate for ~2 h at room temperature or at 37 °C and autoclave. Store at room temperature for up to 10 months.\n\t\tNOTE: Electrophoresis of mammalian total RNAs leads to the separation of 28S and 18S rRNAs at a ratio of approximately 2:1. The bands should be intact and visible as two sharp bands. Degraded RNA will result in blurry bands.\n6. Reverse transcription\nSet the reverse transcription reaction using 1 µg of total RNA.\nPerform reverse transcription (RT) using reverse transcriptase enzyme (see Table of Materials) and 50 ng/µL random decamer primers.\n\t\nMix RNA, random primers, and 1 mM dNTP mix (10 mM) in 10 µL. Incubate at 65 °C for 5 min and on ice for 1 min. Add the following reagents: 1x RT buffer, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 40 U of RNase inhibitor, and 200 U of Reverse Transcriptase.\nIncubate for 10 min at 25 °C and for 1 h at 50 °C (temperatures may change if different enzymes are used). Terminate the reaction by incubating at 85 °C for 5 min. cDNAs can be stored at −20 °C.\n7. Quantitative PCR\nTo assemble the reaction in a final volume of 15 µL, mix 3 µL of cDNA (100 ng/µL), 3.2 pmol of each primer, 6 µL of master mix containing the dNTPs and enzyme, and 2.8 µL of ultrapure water.",
    "NOTE: Use primers for endogenous constitutive genes as controls (housekeeping genes) to normalize the expression levels of HuR mRNA and miRNAs. β-Actin and snRNA U6 (RNU6B) are available options for the normalization of mRNAs and miRNAs, respectively, but other genes might also be suitable depending on the case.\nQuantify the expression levels using the delta-delta Ct (2-ΔΔCt) method20.\n8. The reporter assay\nCells used for the assay\n\t\nTransfect the plasmids in HeLa-Cre cells as follows. Transfect with pTK-Renilla (40 ng), then pRD-miR-17-92, generating HeLa-Cre-miR-17-92, and selecting with 1 µg/mL puromycin.\nTransfect HeLa-Cre-miR-17-92-pTK-Renilla with pmiRGLO-RAP-IB-3ʹ-UTR or pmiRGLO-scrambled-3ʹ-UTR, separately. Select using penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL). These transfections generate Luc-RAP-1-B and Luc-scrambled.\nTransfect the cells with pFLAG-HuR or empty pFLAG (step 3).\nProceed to cell culture, as detailed in step 2.2., with HeLa-Cre miR-17-92-luc, HeLa-Cre miR-17-92-scrambled, HeLa-Cre miR-17-92-HuR, and HeLa-Cre miR-17-92-HuR-luc until approximately 80% of confluence. Induce with 1 µL of doxycycline (1 µg/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C. Also, keep all the cells without doxycycline as controls, for the same period.\n\t\tNOTE: The final concentration of doxycycline depends on the cell line of choice. An excess of doxycycline can be toxic for mammalian cells.\nLuminescent assay\n\t\nTo quantify and compare different luminescence intensities, use the Dual-luciferase reporter assay kit. Thaw luciferase assay solutions and leave them at room temperature before beginning the assay.\nPrepare the mix Stop and Glo (blue cap tubes) by mixing 200 µL of the substrate in 10 mL of Luciferase Assay Buffer II. Prepare the mix LAR II (green cap tubes) by mixing 10 mL of Luciferase Assay Buffer II into the amber vial of Luciferase Assay Substrate II and shake well.\nTransfer the solutions to 15 mL centrifuge tubes previously identified and protected from light.",
    "NOTE: As an alternative, the solutions can be previously prepared in 1-2 mL aliquots and frozen at −80 °C protected from light in aluminum foil.\nPerform the luminescence readings using an equipment such as Synergy; measure expressed luciferase as relative light units (RLU).\nExport the results to a spreadsheet for further statistical analysis.\nPerform normalization of firefly-luciferase activity by the control Renilla (luciferase/Renilla) and plot that as relative light units (RLU) in a graphic. Repeat this for groups with and without doxycycline induction.\nCalculate the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). Perform a Student's t-test or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test to allow group comparison. These analyses are available in a package such as GraphPad Prism. Differences at p-values < 0.05 are considered significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
