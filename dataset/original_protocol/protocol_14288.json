    "Animal care and the experimental protocols used in this study complied with EU directive 2010/63 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (2015/VSC/PEA/00049).\nNOTE: The protocol consists of the chronic administration of a high-fat, high-sucrose diet for 28 weeks, and the assessment of the main components of MetS. We used 11 adult male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits weighing 4.39 ± 0.14 (s.d.) kg, which were 20 - 22 weeks old at the beginning of the experimental protocol. They were housed in a room with humidity (50 ± 5%) and temperature (20 ± 1.5 °C) controlled conditions with a 12-h light cycle. The words \"chow\" and \"diet\" may be used interchangeably in the protocol steps.\n1. Diet Administration\nObtain or prepare diets\nObtain a commercially available high fat diet with added hydrogenated coconut oil (10%) and lard (5%)19. This diet will provide 3.7 kcal·g-1.\nPrepare 5 to 15% sucrose solutions by dissolving the appropriate amounts of sucrose in sterilized water (e.g., use 300 g sucrose in 2 L stock for a 15% sucrose solution). A 15% solution will provide 0.6 kcal·mL-1.\nObtain a commercially available control diet19, which provides 2.7 kcal·g-1.\nAcclimate the animals for 4 weeks\nFeed each animal in the control group 120 g of control diet daily. Provide water ad libitum.\nFeed animals in MetS group 250 g chow starting with a 50% control and 50% high-fat chow, increasing progressively to 100% high-fat chow by the end of week 4.",
    "NOTE: The aim would be to achieve: (i) 35% control and 65% high-fat chow by the end of week 1; (ii) 25% control and 75% high-fat chow by the end of week 2; (iii) 15% control and 85% high-fat chow by the end of week 3. (iv) 100% high-fat chow by the end of week 4.\nGive animals in the MetS group water with 5% sucrose at the start, and increase sucrose concentration to 15% by the end of the 4th week.\nRegister the daily intake of chow and sucrose solution to calculate caloric intake as per values provided in 1.1.1. and 1.1.2.\nInduce MetS (28 weeks)\nFeed each animal in control group 120 g of control chow and water ad libitum daily.\nFeed the animals in the MetS group 250 g of high-fat chow and 15% sucrose in water. Replace chow daily and the sucrose solution every third day.\nWeigh the remaining chow and water daily to estimate daily intake.\n2. Morphological Assessment\nMeasure animal bodyweight on a weekly basis.\nMeasure height, length, abdominal contour, and tibial length, and estimate BMI before administration of the experimental diet and at weeks 14 and 28 in anesthetized animals.\n\t\nCannulate right ear marginal vein with a sterile disposable catheter (18 - 22 G) and inject propofol (8 mgkg-1) followed by 1.5 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution. In the anesthetized rabbit, perform the measurements listed in the subsequent steps.\nMeasure height and length. Using measuring tape, measure and record the distance from the nose to the heel in lateral decubitus position (length). In the same position, take the distance from the acromion in the shoulder to the tip of the paw (height).\nCalculate Body mass index (BMI)20 as bodyweight (kg) · [body length (m) × height (m)]-1.",
    "Place the measuring tape gently around the abdominal contour and take a measurement with the animal in supine position.\nMeasure tibial length from the lower part of the knee joint to the insertion of Achilles tendon.\n3. Fasting Glycemia and Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT)\nNOTE: It is advisable to start the procedures the same time of day (i.e., 2 - 3 PM).\nPrepare a glucose stock solution (60%) with 60 g glucose in 100 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution. \nFast the animal for 7 h (removing food and maintaining water), then place the conscious rabbit in a restrainer in the prone position. Prepare the glucose meter (insert a new strip into the meter), and take the first sample from the left ear marginal vein using a lancet to get a drop of blood. Then touch the blood drop with the test strip and measure blood glucose levels using the glucose meter to determine fasting glycemia.\nCannulate right ear marginal vein with a disposable catheter (18 - 22 G) and inject a bolus of a 60% glucose solution (0.6 g·kg-1).\n\tNOTE: To prepare the bolus, add 1 mL/kg of the glucose stock.\nTake blood samples using the lancet (one drop of blood) at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after glucose injection and analyze them with the glucose meter as in 3.2.\nRemove the disposable catheter and pinch the site of catheter insertion with a gauze. Once blood has coagulated, remove the gauze and check the status of the animal.\n4. Blood Pressure\nPrepare the acquisition system including a pressure transducer, a 10-mL syringe with 0.9% NaCl, a three-way stopcock, an amplifier, and a PC/laptop with the acquisition software (for blood pressure recording).",
    "Set up the equipment. First, place the three-way stopcock and the syringe in the pressure transducer, between the transducer and the catheter, and connect the pressure transducer to the amplifier. Then connect the amplifier to the PC/laptop.\nPerform the pressure transducer calibration according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPlace the conscious animal in a rabbit restrainer in the prone position. Warm up the ear before cannulation, then topically apply a local anesthetic (2.5% lidocaine/prilocaine) in the ear around the site of insertion. Gently tap the area where the vascular package runs to easily identify the artery. Then insert a sterile catheter (18 - 22 G) in the left ear central artery. Loosen the restraints and allow the animal to stay quiet for 30 min.\nRecord blood pressure continuously for 20 min directly from the arterial catheter, placing the pressure transducer positioned next to the animal at the heart level (sampling frequency: 1 KHz, see Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: To keep the blood pressure (BP) recording free from blood coagulation interference (BP signal loses amplitude or disappears), an NaCl (0.9%) injection should be made. Using the three-way stopcock, close the circuit that goes from the transducer to the catheter, open the circuit that goes from the syringe to the catheter, and inject 1 - 2 mL. This will remove blood clots that may form in the catheter. Then, open the circuit between the transducer and the catheter, and continue the recording once the signal has been recovered.\nOnce the recording is finished, remove the catheter and pinch with a gauze in the site of catheter insertion to stop blood loss. Once the blood has coagulated, remove the gauze and check the status of the animal.\n5. Plasma Measurements",
    "NOTE: It is advisable to start the procedures the same time of day (i.e., 2 - 3 PM).\nFast the animal for 7 h (removing food and maintaining water), then place the conscious animal in a restrainer in the prone position and insert a sterile 21 G needle in the left ear marginal vein. Once blood begins to drip, discard the first drop and collect the blood samples in EDTA tubes up to the level indicated in the tube. Store the samples on ice.\nCentrifuge blood samples at 1,500 x g, 15 min, 4 °C. After centrifugation, suction the plasma using a pipette and prepare aliquots of 250 µL.\nAnalyze the fresh samples immediately. Basic control parameters are as follows: triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL cholesterol.\n\tNOTE: Samples not freshly analyzed should be stored immediately in a -80 °C freezer. If interested in analyzing blood glucose from plasma samples, the blood glucose test should use tubes with Fluoride Oxalate instead of EDTA.\nSubscription Required.
