    "All these experiments follow the animal care and ethical guidelines of the Centro Académico de Medicina de Lisboa.\n1. Incubation of Fertilized Quail and Chicken Eggs\nIncubate Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and chicken (Gallus gallus) fertilized eggs for 3 and 8 days, respectively.\n\t\nPlace the eggs with the air chamber (egg blunt end) facing up in a humidified incubator at 38 °C.\nUse around 20 quail eggs and 40 chicken eggs to perform this experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: These numbers should be doubled when establishing this procedure for the first time.\n2. Isolation of Quail Embryonic Region Containing the Presumptive Territory of Thymic and Parathyroid Rudiments\nNote: Perform egg manipulation procedures in sterile conditions using a horizontal laminar flow hood and sterilized instruments and materials.\nPrepare a large borosilicate glass bowl about 3/4 filled with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution.\nOpen a quail egg after 3 days of incubation by tapping the shell and cutting a circular opening on the opposite side of its blunt end with curved scissors. Carefully remove pieces of shell and transfer the embryo to the glass bowl filled with cold PBS.\nHold the quail (q) embryo at E3 (qE3) (the quail stage corresponding to the HH-stage 21 of the chicken) with the help of thin forceps. Make a cut into the vitelline membrane enveloping the yolk using curved scissors. Continue to cut around and externally to the circumference of extra-embryonic vessels.\nTransfer the embryo to a small bowl about 3/4 filled with cold PBS with the help of thin forceps. Thoroughly wash the embryo from the remaining attached yolk.\nUse a skimmer to transfer the embryo to a 100 mm glass Petri dish with black base (see Table of Materials) containing 10 mL of cold PBS.\nPlace the Petri dish under a stereomicroscope.",
    "Note: From this point forward, perform the microsurgery procedures under a stereomicroscope for progressive magnification. As an illumination source, it is advised to use LED lights incorporated in the stereomicroscope or in the optic fibers, considering the limited heat load.\nHold the embryo to the bottom of the plate with thin insect pins. Place four pins forming a square shape in the extra-embryonic region.\nRemove the extra-embryonic membranes of the cephalic region with the help of thin forceps and place a fifth pin there.\n\tNote: If the embryo is correctly positioned, then the otic vesicle, the heart tube, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pharyngeal arches (PAs) should be visible.\nDissect the embryonic region of interest, i.e., the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arch region (3/4PAR), using Wecker eye scissors.\n\t\nStart cutting longitudinally and parallel to the embryo axis, between the somite/neural tube area and the PAs.\nRemove the ventrally positioned heart tube by cutting it. Keeping the scissors in the same position, rotate the Petri dish to reposition the embryo according to the direction of the cut.\nCut between the 2nd and 3rd PAs and below the 4th PA.\nDetach the remaining membranes from the 3/4PAR with the help of thin forceps.\nAspirate the isolated tissues (the 3/4PAR) and transfer them to a glass dish 3/4 filled with cold PBS using a 2 mL sterile plastic pipette.\n\tNote: Hereafter, tissues can be grown in vitro up to 48 h or be immediately grafted onto the CAM of a chicken embryo at E8.\nKeep the glass dish containing the isolated 3/4PAR on ice during the preparation of the in vitro assay.\n3. In Vitro  Organotypic Assay: Culture of the Embryonic Region Containing the Presumptive Territory of Thymic and Parathyroid Rudiments",
    "Prepare the culture medium with RPMI-1640 Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: Soluble pharmacological reagents can be added to the medium (for example, LY-411.575 (Ly) and di-benzazepine or cyclopamine and vismodegib, to inhibit Notch and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways, respectively. For this assay, use 50-200 nM of Ly or 5-15 µM of Di-benzazepine to inhibit Notch signaling in the 3/4PAR. Use 20 µM of cyclopamine or 10 µM of vismodegib to inhibit Hh signaling in the 3/4PAR5.\nPrepare the in vitro culture of the 3/4PP explant in a 6-well plate.\n\t\nFill one well from the 6-well plate with 5 mL of culture medium. Place a 24 mm Polycarbonate Membrane Insert (see Table of Materials) on the well with the help of thin forceps.\nUnder the stereomicroscope, transfer the 3/4PAR explant from the glass dish to the membrane surface by gently sliding with the help of a transplantation spoon (or spatula) and thin forceps. Place the explants with the ventral side up and the dorsal side in contact with the membrane. Add up to seven explants per membrane insert. Proceed to step 3.4.\nAlternatively, culture explants in floating membrane filters.\n\t\nPrepare a 35 mm Petri dish with 5 mL of culture medium. With the help of thin forceps, float a membrane filter (see Table of Materials) and keep a dry surface in contact with air.\nUnder the stereomicroscope, transfer the 3/4PAR explant from the glass dish to the membrane filter by gentle sliding with the help of a transplantation spoon (or spatula) and thin forceps. Place the explants with the ventral side up and the dorsal side in contact with the membrane. Add up to 8 explants per membrane filter.",
    "Carefully place the explants prepared in steps 3.2 and 3.3 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nAfter a 48 h incubation period, remove the 6-well plate and the 35 mm Petri dish from the incubator.\n\t\nCollect the cultured explants from the membrane insert of the 6-well plate.\n\t\t\nAdd PBS at room temperature (RT) to the membrane insert.\nDetach the explants from the membrane by vigorous flushing using a 2 mL sterile plastic pipette.\nWith the help of the spatula and thin forceps, transfer the cultured explants to a glass dish 3/4 filled with PBS at RT.\nSimilarly, collect the cultured explants from the floating membrane filter in the 35 mm Petri dish.\n\t\t\nTransfer the membrane filter with thin forceps to a new 35 mm Petri dish filled with PBS at RT.\nDetach the explants from the membrane filter by vigorous pipetting using a 2 mL sterile plastic pipette.\nWith the help of thin forceps, discharge the explant-free membrane filter after confirming that no explants remained attached to it.\nWith a spatula and thin forceps, transfer the explants to a glass dish filled with PBS at RT.\nTransfer the cultured explants with a spatula to 1 mL of a reagent for total RNA isolation and use for gene-expression studies.\nCAUTION: Exposure to this reagent (see Table of Materials) can be a serious health hazard. Wear appropriate protective eyewear, clothing, and gloves. Follow the handling instructions and read the safety data sheets provided by the manufacturer.\nAlternatively, graft the cultured tissues onto CAM of chicken embryos at E8. Follow to step 4.\n4. Preparation of the CAM\nRemove the chicken eggs with 8 days of embryonic development from the incubator.\n\tNOTE: Eggs were incubated with air chamber facing upwards at 38 °C in a humidified incubator.",
    "Cover the blunt end of the egg with clear plastic tape to prevent pieces of the shell from falling into the air chamber. Tap the shell and cut a circular opening in the egg with curved scissors. The air chamber should be visible.\nRemove with caution the white membrane of the air chamber with thin forceps. CAM is then visible and accessible for ectopic tissue transplantation.\n\tNote: Do not use PBS to hydrate the CAM, before or after transplantation, since PBS promotes sliding and misplacement of the explants. If the membrane dries out, discard the egg.\n5. Grafting of Cultured Explants onto the CAM\nCreate small vascular lesions/wounds in the smaller vessels of the CAM with a microscalpel in a holder.\n\tNote: Use the tip of a Pasteur pipette to remove blood by capillarity in the case of excess bleeding.\nUse a spatula and thin forceps to transfer the cultured explant to the wounded area of the CAM.\nCut a piece of a filter paper slightly larger than the explant and place it on the top of the explant.\n\tNote: The filter paper helps tracking the explant location after its development in the CAM. Also, it allows daily drug delivery to the explant during in ovo development, if necessary (described in step 5.6).\nSeal the egg window with clear plastic tape and identify it using a charcoal pencil.\n\tNote: The plastic tape protects the embryo from dehydration during the incubation period.\nIncubate the manipulated egg for 10 days in a humidified incubator at 38 °C. Follow to step 6.\nOptional Step: Daily drug administration during incubation period.",
    "To access the filter, partially lift the plastic tape. Add 100 µL of drug solution, drop by drop, on top of the paper. Re-seal the window and place the egg back in the humidified incubator at 38 °C.\n\t\tNote: For this assay, the dose of 20 µM of cyclopamine will inhibit Hh signaling during in ovo development5.\n6. Ectopic Organ Formation in the CAM After 10 Days of In Ovo Development\nAfter 10 days of incubation, remove the egg from the incubator and carefully withdraw the plastic tape.\nCut the CAM around the filter region using curved scissors and transfer the CAM-derived explant with filter paper to a small glass bowl about 3/4 filled with cold PBS.\nWith the help of thin forceps transfer the CAM-derived explant to a 100 mm Petri dish with black base containing 10 mL of PBS. Gently remove the filter paper and the excess of membrane using Wecker eye scissors and thin forceps.\nTransfer the CAM-explant to fixative solution (3.7% PFA in PBS) with a skimmer. Euthanize the chicken embryos without removing them from the egg by making a precise cut in the neck region of the embryo with the help of large scissors.\nAssess the organ formation in paraffin sections of the CAM-derived explants by conventional histology and immunohistochemistry.\nSubscription Required.
