    "The animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the Committee on Animal Research and Ethics of the Hebei Yiling Medical Research Institute (approval number: N2022148). Male C57BL/6J mice weighing 18-22 g (see Table of Materials) were housed in the new drug evaluation center of Hebei Yiling Medical Research Institute. They were provided with normal food and clean water and exposed to artificial light for 12 h daily. The rooms maintained a controlled temperature range of 20-26 °C and relative humidity of 40%-70%.\n1. Establishment of a chronic hypoxia mouse model (Figure 1)\nBefore commencing the experiment, prepare animal cages under normal atmospheric pressure and cages with a continuous low-oxygen environment. Establish a continuous low-oxygen environment by utilizing an automated gas control delivery system to flush the chamber with a mixture of pure oxygen and nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: This system is programmed to control the electromagnetic valve switch, thereby ensuring precise delivery of gas in terms of both time and concentration.\nRandomly divide mice into three groups: a control group (Con), a model group (CH), and an electro-acupuncture group (EA + CH). Place control and model/electro-acupuncture mice separately in the two cages, with 10 mice per cage. Maintain the light cycle at 12 h/12 h (light/dark).\n\tNOTE: No treatment or hypoxia is induced in the control group (Con). The model group (CH) consists of mice with chronic hypoxia. The electro-acupuncture group (EA + CH) comprises hypoxia-induced mice treated with electro-acupuncture.",
    "For developing chronic hypoxia, establish the parameters of the low-oxygen chamber by utilizing a digital oxygen meter to regulate the gas flow rate and maintain an oxygen concentration of 10%. Place the animals within the low-oxygen chamber at 9:00 am and remove them at 5:00 pm, resulting in a total of 8 h of uninterrupted exposure to low oxygen per day for 3 months.\n\tNOTE: When setting up the delivery of nitrogen gas to reduce the oxygen concentration, it is advised to proceed slowly to prevent an excessive introduction of nitrogen gas at once, as it will lead to animal fatalities.\nEvaluate the chronic hypoxia-induced cognitive dysfunction model using histology examination and behavioral tests: the open field test15 and the water maze test16.\n2. Anesthesia (Figure 2)\nPrepare the small animal anesthesia machine (see Table of Materials) and the constant temperature heating pad.\n\tNOTE: During anesthesia, animals are susceptible to hypothermia, underscoring the necessity of employing a constant-temperature heating pad for insulation.\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia induction box and quickly induce with 2%-2.5% isoflurane (see Table of Materials) for approximately 1 min.\n\tNOTE: This short-term pre-treatment is a crucial step to ensure that mice can thrive under low-concentration dosage for an extended period of time.\nOnce their excitability decreased, transfer the mouse onto the constant temperature heating pad (37 °C).\nAdjust the anesthesia flow rate to approximately 0.5% concentration. Connect a mask to the anesthesia machine and then place it over the mouth and nose of the mouse. Proceed with electro-acupuncture treatment while ensuring the maintenance of anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The effect of anesthesia was confirmed when the mice stopped blinking. The effect of anesthesia can last for at least 30 min.\n3. Electro-acupuncture treatment",
    "To effectively improve cognitive dysfunction, select specific acupoints, such as Baihui (GV20), Shenting (GV24), and bilateral Zusanli (ST36), based on traditional Chinese medicine theory and clinical experience (Figure 3). Administer electro-acupuncture treatment 2 weeks prior to the completion of the modeling process.\n\t\nLocate the GV20 acupoint on the midline of the forehead, at the midpoint of a line connecting the tips of the ears7. The depth of acupuncture needle insertion must be 2 mm.\nLocate the GV24 acupoint 1.3 mm directly above the midpoint of the mouse's eyes on the midline of the forehead17. The depth of acupuncture needle insertion must be 2 mm.\nLocate the ST36 acupoint on the outside of the knee joint, about 2 mm below the head of the fibula18,19. The depth of acupuncture needle insertion must be 3-4 mm.\nPrepare disposable acupuncture needles (see Table of Materials) and an electro-acupuncture device (see Table of Materials) for the procedure (Figure 4).\nPlace the mouse in the prone position under mild anesthesia with 0.5% isoflurane, ensuring their heads and limbs are immobilized. Hold a stainless-steel needle (diameter: 0.18 mm; length: 7 mm) with the right hand, using the thumb, index finger, and middle finger.\nPerform acupuncture at GV20 and GV24 acupoints transversely for 2 mm depth, lifting the skin on the mouse's head with the left hand. Puncture the ST36 acupoint vertically for 3-4 mm depth by touching the fibular head on the lateral side of the mouse's knee joint and pressing on the skin with the left thumb.",
    "NOTE: For the acupoints located on the head, it is advisable to insert the needles in the sequence of GV24 followed by GV20. This order facilitates operational convenience. Acupuncture points are discrete anatomical locations rather than stationary points. Consequently, slight deviations in the angle of needle insertion have no effect on the therapeutic effectiveness, similarly seen in patients receiving electro-acupuncture treatment in clinical settings.\nConnect the electronic acupuncture device to the needles, with GV20 and the left ST36 connected to one electrode set and GV24 and the right ST36 connected to another (Figure 4). Select the continuous wave mode, with an electric current intensity of 2 mA and a frequency of 2 Hz20,21. Confirm the ideal treatment by observing local mild tremors at acupoints and quiet tolerance by the mouse.\n\t\nWhen connecting the electrical acupuncture instrument, connect the proximal end of the needle. This helps minimize the impact caused by the weight of the connection line and consequently improves the prevention of needle detachment. If required, utilize adhesive tape to secure the horizontally inserted needle and the connection line.\nAdminister the daily treatment for 30 min each day for 6 consecutive days, with a single day of rest between each treatment cycle.\n4. Open field test (Figure 5)\nNOTE: The open field test is a conventional method used to assess the autonomous behavior, exploratory behavior, cognitive abilities, and anxiety behavior of experimental animals in novel and unfamiliar environments22. It consists of an open-field reaction box and a recording device.\nTo conduct the test, prepare a white-walled cube measuring 50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm, with the bottom divided into 25 equal squares measuring 10 cm × 10 cm.",
    "Place the mouse into the open field reaction box for acclimation. Allow the mouse to explore the testing room and familiarize with the new environment during the acclimation period. Conduct the open field test after acclimating the mouse to the experimental environment for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: This guarantees the minimization of anxiety or stress induced by alterations in the environment, thus enabling more precise outcomes during the subsequent behavioral assessments.\nPlace the mouse in the center of the box and monitor it for 10 min after allowing the mouse to adapt to the environment for 2 min.\n\t\nUse a video tracking system (see Table of Materials) to record the mouse's movement trajectory, total distance traveled, time spent in the central area, speed of crossing the central area, and number of entries into the central area during the test.\nPerform the relevant operations as instructed in the product manual of the video tracking system. Each mouse undergoes a single test and begins exploration from the same location within the box.\nAfter each test, clean the open field box with 75% ethanol to prevent any false results caused by odor interference when using a mouse.\n5. Water maze (Figure 5)\nNOTE: The water maze test is frequently employed as a behavioral assessment tool in experiments involving mice to evaluate their spatial learning and memory capabilities23.\nPrepare a circular water tank with a diameter of 120 cm and a depth of 30 cm. Divide the tank into four equal quadrants: I, II, III, and IV. If using black mice in the experiment, use a white water tank; for white mice, use a black water tank.\nPlace curtains around the circular water tank to prevent the mouse from seeing the researchers during the test.",
    "Position different markers on the top surface of the water tank as visual cues for spatial orientation. Ensure that these markers remain stationary throughout the experiment to maintain consistency.\nSituate a circular platform with a diameter of 10 cm in quadrant III of the water tank as the designated target area. Ensure the platform can be easily moved and secured in any desired location.\nThroughout the experiment, introduce water into the tank while maintaining a temperature range of 22-24 °C.\n\t\nEnsure the water level remains consistently 1 cm above the target platform. Include a 20% concentration of non-toxic titanium dioxide in the water to achieve a distinct contrast between the black mice and the white background. This contrast facilitates the camera's recording of the mouse's movements and relevant parameters.\nConduct a 5-day continuous spatial exploration test by sequentially placing each mouse in quadrants I, II, III, and IV.\n\t\nPosition the mouse facing the wall. Move away from the maze to prevent the mouse from using the experimenter's position as a reference point. Record the time the mouse takes to find the platform.\nIf the mouse fails to locate the underwater platform within 90 s, guide the mouse to the platform and provide a 30-s learning period. Additionally, record the latency period as 90 s.\nIf the mouse locates the underwater platform within 90 s, let it remain on the platform for 10 s for learning before removing it from the water tank.\nDry the mouse with a towel and return it to its cage.",
    "Rotate the placement of each mouse in each quadrant every 20 min. Record each mouse's swimming distance, speed, and time taken to find the platform (the latency period) using the video tracking system (see Table of Materials), performing the relevant operations as instructed in the product manual.\nSet the platform 1 cm above the water surface on day 1. Place the platform at a depth of 1 cm below the water surface on days 2-5.\nOn Day 6, remove the platform from the target quadrant and conduct a spatial exploration test.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in Quadrant I to explore freely for 90 s. The computer records the swimming trajectory of the mouse, the time spent in the target quadrant, and the number of times it crosses the platform.\n\t\t​NOTE: In order to minimize experimental errors caused by human factors, it is important to keep the position of the reference point fixed in the water maze experiment. Additionally, the experimenter should immediately retreat after placing the mouse in the water. After the experiment is completed, the mice should be dried with a towel and placed back in their cages to maintain warmth.\n6. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (Figure 6)\nNOTE: Histological examination of the hippocampal region assists in assessing the establishment of the hypoxia model and determining the efficacy of acupuncture treatment.\nAfter the behavioral experiment, anesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium and perfuse it with 10% paraformaldehyde solution (see Table of Materials) to ensure complete body perfusion. Isolate the brain tissue and immerse it in 10% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature (RT) for 3 days to achieve fixation.\nPlace the brain samples in an embedding box. Subsequently, wash the processed brain samples with running water for 6 h.",
    "Employ an automated tissue processor to dehydrate the samples using a series of alcohol solutions with increasing concentrations, namely, 60% ethanol for 1 h, 70% ethanol for 1 h, 90% ethanol for 1 h, 95% ethanol for 2 h, and finally, 100% ethanol for 2 h.\nImmerse the tissue specimens in xylene for 2 h to achieve transparency. Subsequently, following the completion of the dehydration process, transfer the permeabilized samples to paraffin wax heated to 60 °C for 3 h. Finally, embed them in an automatic processor.\nUtilize a rotary slicer to obtain 4 µm sections. Subsequently, subject the sections to hematoxylin staining for a duration ranging from 3-8 min, followed by eosin staining for 1-3 min.\nSequentially transfer the stained sections to separate containers of pure alcohol and xylene. Then, seal and secure the stained sections with neutral gum in preparation for pathological examination under an optical microscope.\nEmploy a slide scanner (see Table of Materials) to scan the slices. Subsequently, utilize the viewing software to obtain the HE staining results for the hippocampal region. Compare the arrangement of neurons and the condensation of neuronal nuclei.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
