    "1. Cloning of expression vectors and transformation of an auxotrophic production strain\nHerein, the genes for nisin biosynthesis, namely nisABC, have been taken from L. lactis and transferred into T7-based plasmid expression vectors. Full DNA sequences of nisABC can be found in GenBank entry X6830734. The gene for the precursor peptide (nisA) has been placed on a pET-3a vector that confers ampicillin resistance. Genes for the dehydratase (nisB) and cyclase (nisC) have been placed on vector pRSFDuet-1, as reported earlier35, which confers kanamycin resistance.\nNOTE: For nisA, the codons of the last four amino acids (ASPR) of the leader sequence were mutated to encode VSLR36 to render the proline residue in the core peptide unique and to ensure proper prepeptide processing by NisP. At the N-terminus, a hexa-histidine tag flanked by linker residues was added for purification purposes (see Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57551/57551fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Schematic representation of the biosynthesis and PTM of NisA in E. coli as well as leader cleavage by the L. lactis indicator strain in a subsequent activity assay. In the first step, the inactive linear prenisin (composed of a leader and a core peptide region containing a unique proline (pink) at position 9) encoded by nisA is ribosomally synthesized. Next, prenisin is posttranslationally modified by dehydration of serine and threonine residues to dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) as catalyzed by NisB. The cyclase NisC forms the thioether bridges via Michael addition of cysteine sulfhydryl groups with Dha or Dhb. The inactive modified prenisin is purified from E. coli and tested for antimicrobial activity. Here, it is transported into the cell of the Gram-positive L. lactis indicator strain. The leader is cleaved by protease NisP (as indicated by an arrowhead) to release fully active nisin. It can also be removed in vitro by treatment with trypsin (*). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57551/57551fig1large.jpg]\nUse standard heat-shock protocol37 or electroporation38 to transform the proline auxotrophic E. coli strain (see above) with the plasmids pET-3a nisA(VSLR) and pRSFDuet-1 nisBC.\nPipette 25-100 µL of transformed cell suspension onto agar plates containing ampicillin, kanamycin and 1% (w/v) glucose. Use a plate spreader or glass beads to spread the solution evenly on the plates.\nIncubate plates overnight at 37 °C.\nThe following afternoon, use a single colony to inoculate 10 mL LB medium containing ampicillin, kanamycin and 1% (w/v) glucose in a 50 mL flask.\nShake culture overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C and 200 rpm.\nTake 250 µL sterile 80% glycerol and 550 µL culture, mix well in a 2 mL tube and store as frozen cell stock at 80 °C.\n2. New minimal medium (NMM) preparation",
    "NOTE: This protocol uses NMM20 as a chemically defined liquid bacterial growth medium. Also, it is advised to follow the order of preparation strictly. Otherwise, precipitation can occur. For amino acid forms differing from those listed in the Materials table (e.g., hydrochlorides), check solubility. NMM19 contains 19 amino acids except for the cAA to be replaced (here, proline) by the ncAA analog. See Table 1 for the final ingredient concentrations. Depending on the bacterial strain used for production, biotin and thiamine may be optional.\nPreparation of the amino acid mixture\n\t\nDissolve 0.5 g Phe, Trp and Tyr in 100 mL ddH2O with the addition of a few drops of concentrated HCl until dissolution.\nWeigh out 0.5 g of each of the remaining 16 amino acids. Mix with 22 mL of 1 M KH2PO4 and 48 mL of 1 M K2HPO4. Add ddH2O to ~800 mL. Stir until the solution becomes clear.\nAdd the dissolved Phe, Trp and Tyr and adjust the volume of the solution to 1 L with ddH2O.\nSterilize the amino acid mixture by vacuum filtration with a bottle top filter unit.\nStock solutions for NMM19\n\t\nFirst, prepare 1 M stock solutions of the following components: (NH4)2SO4, KH2PO4, K2HPO4, MgSO4 and a 5 M stock solution of NaCl. Sterilize by autoclaving.\nPrepare 50 mL stocks of D-glucose (1 M), CaCl2 (1 g/L), FeCl2 (1 g/L), thiamine (10 g/L), biotin (10 g/L) and trace elements (CuSO4, ZnCl2, MnCl2, (NH4)2MoO4; 1 mg/L). Sterilize each by filtration with a syringe filter.\nNMM19 preparation",
    "Mix all stock solutions to obtain a final concentration of 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1.7 mM NaCl, 22 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4, 1 mM MgSO4 and 20 mM D-glucose, 50 mg/L amino acid mix, 1 µg/L CaCl2, 1 µg/L FeCl2, 10 µg/L thiamine, 10 mg/L biotin and 0.01 µg/mL trace elements.\n3. Expression of Recombinant Nisin with Incorporation of Proline Analogs by SPI\nIn this section, recombinant expression of the prepeptide (here: nisA) and PTM genes (here: nisBC) is performed. First, cells are grown in the presence of all cAAs, since LB complex medium is used. Glucose is added to repress the target gene expression at background level, which could otherwise lead to the production of wild-type peptide (here: nisin) due to leakiness of the promoters. Only after the target cAA (here: proline) is depleted, the ncAA is added and target gene expression is induced in chemically defined medium. Incubation of liquid cultures should be performed in suitable flasks with aeration (e.g., 500 mL in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask at 200 rpm).\nUsing a sterile pipette tip, start a fresh overnight culture from frozen cell stock or fresh colony (see step 1). Use 25 mL LB medium containing ampicillin, kanamycin and 1% (w/v) glucose and incubate overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C and 200 rpm.\nInoculate 1 L of sterile fresh medium with 10 mL overnight culture (1% v/v) and incubate at 37 °C and 200 rpm until OD600 = 0.5.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min at 4,500 x g.\nPour off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 20 mL NMM19 (prepared in step 2.3) containing antibiotics and 1% (w/v) glucose. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at 4,500 x g.",
    "Resuspend cell pellet in 500 mL of the same medium and incubate at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: At this step, the cAA depletion (here, proline) takes place.\nDivide the culture into equal parts (one for each ncAA). Induce each culture with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and supply 1 mM proline analogs (4S/R-fluoroproline, 4S/R-hydroxyproline or 4S/R-methanoproline).\n\tNOTE: As control, one culture can be supplied with 1 mM proline, resulting in wild-type peptide production.\nIncubate overnight (12-16 h) at 28 °C and 200 rpm.\nCentrifuge the cell cultures in 50 mL tubes at 4 °C for 20 min at 5,000 x g. Pour off the supernatant and store pellets at -80 °C until purification.\n4. Isolation and Purification of His-tagged Nisin Analogs\nPeptides are purified under denaturing conditions with guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)39, a strong denaturant.\nCaution: GuHCl is harmful if swallowed or inhaled and causes skin and serious eye irritation. Wear eye protection and gloves.\nPrepare 250 mL of binding buffer (5 M GuHCl, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4), wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 25 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) and elution buffer (300 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). For these, transfer the solids into a 250 mL bottle and fill up to 200 mL with ddH2O. Mix well and adjust the pH to 7.4 with 1 M NaOH or HCl. Then, fill up to 250 mL with ddH2O. Filter all buffer solutions using a bottle top filter unit.\nCell lysis",
    "​Here, a sonicator (with 200 W maximum high frequency (HF) output) is used; note that power settings needed for cell disruption may differ for other instruments. All steps are performed on ice. Alternatively, chemical cell lysis, a liquid homogenizer or a French press can be used.\n\t\nAdd 12 mL binding buffer to each centrifuge tube (from step 3.8) and resuspend by vortexing.\nSubmerge the tip of the sonicator probe into the cell suspension. Set sonicator at 40% amplitude with pulse of 1 s on / 5 s off for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Clean the sonicator tip between samples to avoid carryover. Wipe the sonicator probe with 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the lysed cell suspension at 4 °C for 40 min at 15,000 x g to pellet cell debris. Transfer the supernatants to a new reaction tube.\nAffinity chromatography\n\tFor immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)40, a peristaltic pump or an FPLC system can be used with a 1 mL cartridge (here filled with Ni-NTA resin). For preparation of buffers, see step 4.1.\n\tNOTE: IMAC purification is feasible since the produced recombinant peptide carries an N-terminally His-tagged leader, which is removed in step 6 by leader peptidase NisP, releasing mature nisin. Perform purification at room temperature or at 4 °C. Use a flow rate of 1 mL per minute if applicable for the IMAC cartridge.\n\t\nFirst, wash the cartridge with 5 column volumes (cv) of ddH2O to remove storage buffer.\nEquilibrate with 10 cv of binding buffer.\nProcess cell lysate (step 4.2) using a syringe filter to remove particles, then apply to the cartridge.\nWash with 15 cv of wash buffer in order to remove nonspecific and unbound material.",
    "Elute with 10 cv of elution buffer and collect 1 mL fractions in 1.5 mL tubes. Store the fractions at 4 °C for short term (up to 3 days) or at -20 °C for longer terms.\nFor storage, wash the cartridge with 10 cv of ddH2O followed by 5 cv of 20% ethanol.\n5. LC-ESI-TOF Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Nisin Analogs\nNOTE: See Materials table for example instrumentation for liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF-MS).\nPerform HPLC separation of 15-20 µL peptide solution (prepared in step 4.3) on a C5 column with a mobile phase of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) both supplemented with 0.1% formic acid and a gradient from 5-80% B over 20 min. For mass spectrometry (MS), use elution after 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Depending on peptide content and affinity to the HPLC column, sample volumes and separation may need optimization.\nUse appropriate software to deconvolute the measured mass spectra and calculate the different peptide charge states41. Compare the observed peptide species mass to the calculated wild-type mass altered by the cAA → ncAA substitution. Take into account that the linear prepeptide is posttranslationally modified by eight dehydrations (-8 H2O) and five cyclizations (see Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Using sodium-containing buffers, MS analysis in positive mode can show sodium adducts. These become visible as additional peaks with higher deconvoluted mass (for each sodium adduct, the observed deconvoluted mass is 22.99 Da higher). To remove these adducts, HPLC purification42 or extensive dialysis43 can be performed.\n6. Antimicrobial Activity Test\nPreparation of GM17-agar plates under sterile conditions\n\t\nPrepare an overnight culture of the indicator strain L. lactis NZ9000 carrying plasmid pNG nisPT44 at 30 °C in M17 broth45 with 1% (w/v) glucose (=GM17) and 5 µg/mL chloramphenicol.",
    "Measure OD600, inoculate fresh medium to OD600 = 0.1 and incubate until OD600 = 0.4-0.6. Then place the flask on ice.\n\t\tNote: Each OD600 measurement will consume culture volume. Keep in mind that for each assay agar plate, 1 mL bacterial culture will be needed. If required, scale up the liquid culture volume accordingly.\nFor 1.5% agar, weigh out 4.5 g agar in a glass media bottle. Add 300 mL ddH2O, mix, and autoclave.\nPrepare 2x M17 broth (two-times concentrated) in 300 mL ddH2O and autoclave.\nMix 25 mL 2x M17 broth containing 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 2% glucose with 1 mL L. lactis preculture (4% v/v).\nAdd 25 mL molten 1.5% agar (freshly autoclaved or heated in a microwave).\n\t\tNOTE: Prior to this, let the bottle cool to the touch (around 50 °C). This is necessary since L. lactis is a mesophilic organism sensitive to high temperatures.\nPour the solution into a large petri dish. Dry plates for 10-15 min.\nSterilize the ends of a glass Pasteur pipette by flame. Wait for it to cool down, then use the wide end to create holes in the solidified GM17-agar.\nSample preparation\n\t\nTake 1 mL of the E. coli expression cultures (created in step 3.7) in a labelled 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 7,000 x g. Aspirate the remaining medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL Na-P (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 made from 0.5 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.5 M disodium hydrogen phosphate).\nSonicate the samples on ice (compare step 4.2.2). Submerge the tip of the sonicator probe into the cell suspension. Set sonicator at 30 % amplitude with pulse of 1 s on and 5 s off for 3 min.",
    "Centrifuge the cell lysate for 10 min at 13,000 x g to pellet cell debris. Transfer the supernatant to a new reaction tube on ice.\nDilute and normalize the cell extract supernatants to 1 mL OD600 = 0.6, relative to the harvested cell density, with Na-P.\nActivity test\n\t\nAdd 40 µL of each normalized sample into a hole of the indicator agar plate (Figure 3). Use chloramphenicol at 400 µg/mL as antibacterial control compound. Use elution buffer as a negative control. Wait until all samples are diffused into the agar. Incubate the plate overnight at 30 °C.\nTake pictures of the agar plates using a flatbed scanner or digital camera. Growth inhibition halo sizes can be measured by hand or using ImageJ46.\n7. Fluorescence Microscopy\nIn order to observe the effect of AMPs on bacterial cells, light and fluorescence microscopy can be used. Note that the nisin mode of action relies on the destabilization and the formation of pores in bacterial membranes6. Here, Nile red is used to stain the bacterial cell membrane, which becomes scattered and aggregated upon cell lysis.\nNOTE: See Materials table for example instrumentation. Amounts of added AMP solution can be adjusted depending on peptide concentration and bioactivity.\nCell preparation\n\t\nPrepare 10 mM Nile red stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nGrow L. lactis indicator strain to OD600 = 1.0 as in step 6.1.1-6.1.2.\nCentrifuge 1 mL culture for 3 min at 4 °C and 5,000 x g.\nDiscard supernatant, resuspend in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)47.\nCentrifuge and resuspend again.\nAdd 1 µL Nile red stock solution, mix gently.\nMicroscopic Image Acquisition\n\t\nAdd 30 µL of cell preparation on a cover slide while exciting at 520 nm.\nSet acquisition time 0.2 s, kinetic series 0.1 Hz, series length 200 images.",
    "Add 0.3 - 1.5 µL of cell lysate or IMAC sample (from step 6.2.4 or 4.3.5, respectively). For IMAC samples, elution buffer can be used as a negative control.\nMonitor and record fluorescence emission at λ ≥ 560 nm.\nData analysis\n\t\nMicroscopy image sequences are stored as movie files (.avi). Single images are analyzed with ImageJ46."
