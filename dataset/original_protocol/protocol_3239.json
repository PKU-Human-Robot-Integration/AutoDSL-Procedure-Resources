    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion of liver biopsy\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe following steps, depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], describe how to liberate immune cells from liver biopsy by mechanical disruption followed by enzymatic digestion of the tissue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3008-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic Illustration of isolation workflow and sample preparation for low Input-RNA sequencing\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nFor obtaining liver biopsy from mouse, use the sample corers and take a liver biopsy ex-vivo, under sterile conditions.\nTake out the biopsy from its preservation solution (MACS Tissue Storage Solution, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and transfer it to a cell culture petri-dish containing 3 mL ice-cold PBS. Keep the petri-dish on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3008-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of human or mouse liver biospecimen for cell sorting\n(A) Biopsies kept in MACS Tissue preservation solution.\n(B) Representative size of a liver biopsy from human.\n(C) Cutting liver tissue to small particles using scalpels.\n(D) Gently passing digested liver tissue through 200 μm cell strainer.\n(E) Cell pellet after enzymatic digestion and washing.\nNote: The size of liver biopsies taken with core needle biopsy systems may vary between 10–25 mm × 1.4 mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). For the human biopsies, we recommend using the following instruments: 1) A Pro-Mag Ultra automatic biopsy Instrument (Argon Medical Devices, Inc, with a 16G (20 cm) single-use biopsy needle (DNG-1020-16-0200 by Moeller Medical GmbH, Wasserkuppenstrasse 29-31, 36043 Fulda, Germany) and a throw advancement of 25 mm. 2) A PlusSpeed automatic biopsy instrument with PlusSpeed N biopsy needle with beveled tip 16G (20 cm) and a 15 mm or 22 mm throw advancement.\nCut the biopsy into small sections about 1 mm, using forceps and scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Critical: We strongly recommend keeping the tissue in solution all the time during preparation in this protocol and avoid allowing it to dry out, as this will affect cell viability.\nFurther dissociate the tissue by squishing each particle with a 5 mL syringe plunger.\nTransfer all PBS and the tissue particles into a 50 mL tube containing 45 mL enzyme digestion buffer and incubate for 45 min at 37°C.\nNote: The volume of digestion buffer can be adjusted to the size of biopsy, accordingly.\nCritical: Longer incubation of the tissue in digestion buffer may impact cell viability and surface expression of certain markers. Shorter incubation times less than 30 min might reduce leukocyte retrieval. Appropriate incubation time, balancing cell viability and leukocyte recovery is crucial.\nOccasionally shake the tube during incubation time.\nPlace a 200 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL conical tube and rinse with 1 mL wash buffer.\nTransfer digested tissue into the 50 mL tube by filtering through the cell strainer. If tissue particles formed clumps or aggregates, gently smash them using the flat end of a sterile plunger (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Rinse the cell strainer with 1 mL wash buffer.\nAssemble a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube and rinse with 1 mL wash buffer.\nFilter the solution through the cell strainer. Repeat dissociation by a plunger if needed. Rinse the cell strainer with an additional 1 mL of wash buffer.\nNote: Do not damage the cell strainer by pushing too strong. Pay attention to the fibrotic aggregates which remain undigested and might damage the mesh if too much force is applied.\nCentrifuge the collected suspension at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 50 mL tube with 1 mL wash buffer, and transfer the cells to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspend in 250 μL wash buffer. At this step a red-white cell pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNote: For the murine samples, about 2 mg of liver tissue specimens from two mice were obtained and kept in 500 μL of RNAlater buffer as a control bulk liver sample. Liver tissue samples were cut and digested as described above, lysed in 600 μL of QIAzol lysis reagent, and total RNA extracted following the same procedure for liver leukocytes as described in RNA extraction and RNA-sequencing library preparations section. At the step cell sorting, if a cell sorter instrument is not available, leukocytes can be purified by a differential density gradient10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] to remove contaminating liver tissue cells. Red cell pellet indicates presence of red blood cells (RBC). However, the few remaining RBCs will be excluded by surface CD45 staining in the next step.\nSurface antigen staining and cell sorting\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following steps describe the procedure of surface immunostaining required for sorting viable leukocytes using Sony cell sorter MA900.\nAdd anti-CD45 (mouse or human, 1–5 μg/mL final concentration) to the cells from previous step, mix gently and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nWash by adding 1 mL wash buffer and spin down at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend in 200 μL wash buffer and add PI staining buffer to the solution (1:50).\nPrepare a microcentrifuge tube coated with FBS (add 200 μL of FBS in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, briefly vortex for 10 s, and discard FBS).",
    "Sort the sample on Sony LA900 or any other cell sorting instrument. We recommend sorting by 100 μm chip on Sony LA900 instrument. As depicted in (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B) Gate on viable leukocyte (PI negative, CD45 positive).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3008-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating strategy for cell sorting and yield of leukocyte retrieval\n(A) Representative FACS plots from Murine.\n(B) Representative FACS plots from human NASH patient.\n(C) Dot plot depicting correlation between number of sorted leukocytes and the size of human biopsies. Dotted lines depict 95% confidence intervals (R squared: 0.37, p value: 0.19).\nNote: For an optimized gating on viable leukocytes, include single stains of PI and CD45. Adjust the primary gating on population containing the highest percentage of CD45 positive but PI negative.\nCentrifuge the tube at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant until about 50 μL left.\nNote: From each biopsy 5,000–11,000 sorted leukocytes can be retrieved (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). If there are multiple biopsies from the same patient or animal, they can be sorted into a single microcentrifuge tube. Although the size of biopsies varies (10–25 mm), there is no strong correlation between retrieval of immune cells and the size of biopsy (R squared = 0.37, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nRNA extraction and quality control\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this part, procedures for total RNA extraction, quality control and normalization for subsequent library preparation and sequencing are described. Integrity and purity of input RNA play a critical role in the reliability of mRNA-seq when using Poly-A enrichment as library preparation method. Therefore, it is a good practice to perform quality control of the input RNA. Only samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥7.5 were processed.",
    "Add 250 μL of QIAzol to each tube containing sorted cells, quickly mix and drop it into a flask of liquid nitrogen and store the snap frozen sample at −80°C, until all the samples are collected.\nNote: Working with liquid nitrogen requires handling training and special safety precautions. Lysed cells can be stored at −80°C for several months. We recommend extracting RNA of all the samples of an experiment in the same run, to reduce variations due to the batch effects.\nThaw the samples from −80°C freezer on ice, homogenize them by gentle pipetting and transfer them to 2 mL Phase Lock tubes.\nAdd 50 μL chloroform to each lysate and shake vigorously for 15 s.\nIncubate the samples for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C and transfer the upper aqueous phase (about 150 μL) to pre-chilled 1.5 mL microtubes.\nAdd 225 μL Isopropanol to each tube and mix well by pipetting.\nTransfer the lysates to RNeasy MinElute spin columns and extract total RNA using miRNeasy Micro Kit, with on-column DNase treatment following manufacturer’s instructions.\nFor the final elution step, use 14 μL and 30 μL of nuclease-free water to elute RNA from leukocyte and liver tissue samples respectively.\nFor highly sensitive assessment of the quality and quantity of extracted RNA samples, analyze them on a Fragment Analyzer system using Agilent DNF-472 HS RNA (15 nt) kit. Total RNA yield ranged from 1.7 ng to 13.4 ng for the liver leukocytes and around 6 μg for the liver tissue samples (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). RIN (RNA Integrity Number) for all samples was >9.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3008-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

(C) PCA analysis of liver and sorted leukocytes.\n(D) Comparison of cell markers expression in bulk liver and sorted leukocyte.\n(E) Differential gene expression between different samples, all compared to 20000 sorted leukocytes.\nStart library preparation procedure immediately or store the extracted RNA samples in a LoBind 96-well plate (Eppendorf) at −80°C using Microseal 'B' Adhesive Seals to seal the plate.\nLow input mRNA-sequencing\nTiming: 4 days\nThe following steps provide details for low-input mRNA-sequencing library preparation and sequencing on NextSeq500 Illumina platform.\nThaw RNA samples on ice.\nUse up to 10 ng of total RNA for cDNA synthesis following SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit’s instructions with a maximum of 10 amplification cycles.\nCritical: Adjust the number of cDNA amplification cycles according to the RNA input amount following Takara’s Protocol recommendations.\nAssess cDNA size distribution and concentration on a Fragment Analyzer using High Sensitivity NGS DNF-474 Kit.\nUse up to 10 ng of cDNA to generate the final sequencing libraries with the Tagmentation-based DNA Prep Kit and the IDT DNA/RNA UD Indexes Set A. Perform index PCR with 9–12 cycles and elute the final library in 30 μL EB Buffer.\nCritical: Adjust the number of PCR cycles according to the cDNA input amount following Illumina’s Protocol recommendations.\nAssess library size distribution and adapter dimer presence on a Fragment Analyzer using High Sensitivity NGS DNF-474 Kit.\nFor an accurate and optimal sample adjustment, normalize all the libraries to 10 nM using Hamilton Microlab STAR Liquid Handling System.\nPool all libraries at equimolar concentrations and spike-in 1% PhiX control V3.",
    "The library pool can be sequenced on Illumina NGS platforms. We sequenced our samples on a NextSeq500 platform with a single end, dual Index run with the following Read Parameters: Rd1: 86, Rd2: 10, Rd3:10. An average sequencing depth of 28.5 million Pass-Filter reads was obtained per sample.\nLow-input mRNA-seq analyses\nTiming: 10 h (depending on available computational capacity)\nThe following steps describe data analysis of low-input mRNA-sequencing in brief. For complete details on the use and execution of this analysis pipeline, please refer to Schlager et al. 2020.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nMap filtered reads against GRCm38 reference genome using STAR (v2.5.2b) aligner.\nNote: For mapping human sequences, GRCh38.p14 reference genome should be used as the reference sequence. This step is the computationally most demanding and usually takes several hours (depending on computational facilities).\nQuantify gene expression levels based on genome annotation files from Ensembl version 86 using RSEM (v1.3.0) and featureCounts (v1.5.1). For quality control use FastQC (v0.11.5), picardmetrics (v0.2.4) and dupRadar (v1.2.2).\nThe steps described below can all be completed in R (v4.1.2)12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]:\nPerform variance stabilizing transformation (VST) using the function varianceStabilizingTransformation (DESeq2 v1.34.0).\nPlot VST expression values per sample to ensure comparable count distribution and sequencing depth across samples and sample input numbers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPerform principal component analysis (PCA) on VST gene expression matrix using the function prcomp (scale = TRUE) (stats 4.1.2). Plot PC1 and PC2 to depict sample similarity.\nNote: All sorted leukocyte samples should cluster closely together and clearly separate from the bulk liver tissue samples (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nExamine purity of sorted leukocytes by checking expression of liver tissue marker gene Albumin (Alb). Results can be visualized for example using ggplot2 (v3.3.5) as depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D.",
    "Note: Albumin is expected to be highly expressed in liver tissue and close to zero in the sorted immune cell population. Conversely, pan-leukocyte (Ptprc), T cell (Cd3e) and neutrophil (Nampt) markers are expected to be strongly enriched in the sorted immune cell fraction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nFor proof-of-concept, calculate differential expression between high vs. low leukocyte cell inputs or liver bulk tissue, respectively. We used limma/voom based on mapped counts derived from featureCounts with a paired donor design in edgeR (v3.36.0). Define an appropriate cut-off for differentially expressed genes. We defined genes as differentially expressed if |log2 fold change|> 1 and the adjusted p-value padj ≤ 0.05. For each gene and condition, the sign of the differential expression was calculated according to sign(contrast) = 0 if p > 0.05, sign(log2 fold change) if padj ≤ 0.05.\nPlot differentially regulated genes obtained in point 6 to ensure absence of major gene expression changes between high vs. low leukocyte cell inputs. Liver bulk versus high input samples serves as positive control and should show a large number (>1000) of differentially regulated genes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: Optionally, in addition the overlap structure of differentially expressed can be depicted in a Venn diagram, e.g., using the ggVennDiagram (v1.2.0) package.\nMurine RNA sequencing data are deposited at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE230131)."
