    "The study was performed according to the guidelines of rodent handling and surgery, and the study protocol was approved by the University Health Network Animal Care Committee (UHN AUP #: 5840.3) and follows the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. The study uses male Lewis rats (strain LEW/SsNHsd), 12-14 weeks old, weighing between 250-300 g.\n1. Equipment set-up\nHold a 31 G sharp tip with a needle holder and create a blunt L-shaped injector by flexing the tip repeatedly back and forth until the tip snaps off. Using a flat metal file, blunt and smooth the end of the injector.\n\t\nCut the portal vein (PV) and infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHVC) cuffs from the 3D-printed base with a scalpel (Supplementary Material 1, Supplementary Material 2, Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: A 3D design software is used to design the cuffs and holders, which are printed on a 3D printer (Table of Materials) using autoclavable resin39,40 (specifications for all 3D-printed material included in the Supplementary Material 1-10).\nUse a new scalpel to cut the 22 G catheter into a double-sided slanted tube (3.5 mm in length). Using the scalpel, gently etch lines onto the surface of the bile duct (BD) stent (do not cut through the wall of the tube). These etchings will prevent ties from slipping during the procedure.\nUse a new scalpel to cut the 24 G catheter into a one-sided slanted-edge tube (2.0 mm in length), and create several scratches on the surface of the new arterial stent.\n\t\tNOTE: Prevent narrowing or occlusion of the lumen of the BD stent by avoiding the application of pressure to the stent. If the stent is narrowed or occluded, the recipient's survival will be compromised by biliary obstruction.\n2. Donor operation",
    "Set a heat pad to 37 °C and place it underneath the surgical platform. Turn on the temperature monitor so that the rat's core temperature can be monitored via rectal probe. Set up the isoflurane anaesthesia apparatus.\n\tNOTE: During surgery, monitor the depth of anesthesia by noting the breathing rate, heart rate, coloration of the organs/mucous membranes, and presence of any pedal withdrawal reflexes.\nArrange the surgically draped workspace with all necessary instruments and materials (i.e., scissors, forceps, gauze, heparin, retractors, midsection pad, cotton tips, 4-0 silk, 7-0 silk, 8-0 non-absorbable sterile suture, and 10-0 non absorbable monofilament suture) placed conveniently at the sides of the surgical platform.\nArrange the workstation with all solutions, including Ringer's lactate solution and 300 IU of sodium heparin (see Table of Materials).\nWeigh the animal. Anesthetize the donor rat by placing it in the anaesthetic chamber with 5% isoflurane, 5 L/min air flow, and 70% FiO2 for induction. When the rat loses consciousness, decrease anaesthesia to 3% isoflurane, 0.5 L/min air flow, and 70% FiO2. Check for the lack of pedal response by pinching the toe.\nPrepare the skin of the abdomen. Using an electric shaver, remove the fur from the ventral side. Attentively observe the donor's respiration rate until it attains a stable and deep rate.\n\t\nLay the surgically draped rat so that its ventral side is facing the ceiling. Place the nose in an anesthesia scavenger with 3% isoflurane, 0.5 L/min air flow, and 70% FiO2. Prepare the abdominal wall with povidone-iodine, working from the midline outward, followed by 70% ethanol.",
    "Make an incision from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis using a round-tipped surgical scissor, then improve exposure with a bilateral transverse incision. Stop any bleeding from the abdominal wall using a bi-polar electrosurgical unit for cautery. After the incision, decrease maintenance isoflurane to 2%, 0.5 L/min air flow, and 70% FiO2.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the isoflurane vaporizer to achieve a respiration rate of approximately one breath per second and remember to regularly assess the depth of anesthesia throughout the course of the operation.\nPlace a 4-0 silk stitch in the xiphoid process and use the suture to retract the chest wall cephalad. Tape the silk thread to the top of the structure that holds the anesthesia scavenger in place. Hold the donor rat's body cavity open with 3D-printed retractors (see Supplementary Material 3) placed on the either side of the abdomen (retractors are held in place with rubber bands attached to magnets on the surgical platform).\n\tNOTE: Mosquito forceps also can be used to grasp the xiphoid process and retract the cephalad. Fix the mosquito forceps in place using tape.\nUse a nonwoven gauze sponge (4 cm x 4 cm) dampened by Ringer's lactate solution to enclose the small and large intestines. Use a small, wet, nonwoven gauze sponge (2 cm x 4 cm) to gently cover the liver.\nPlace a small rolled gauze under the midsection to lift the abdomen and improve exposure of the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (SHVC).\nCut the falciform ligament. Separate the left diaphragmatic vein from the SHVC using micro-forceps. Ligate the left diaphragmatic vein with 7-0 silk, staying close to the SHVC.",
    "NOTE: Use the small, wet, nonwoven gauze sponge, dampened with Ringer's lactate and placed on the liver, to gently retract the liver away from the xiphoid process and expose the left diaphragmatic vein.\nCut the left triangular and the gastro-hepatic ligaments with round-tipped scissors.\nExpose the caudate lobe by carefully pulling back the left and middle lobes towards the xiphoid process using a small, wet, nonwoven gauze sponge. Release the ligament separating the caudate lobe from the rest of the liver with a round-tipped scissor.\nDivide and separate the hepato-esophageal ligament using a bi-polar electrosurgical unit close to the esophagus.\n\tNOTE: Gently shift the small and large intestines to the left side of the abdominal cavity and cover them with wet, nonwoven gauze.\nDissect the retroperitoneum and fat covering the IHVC. Expose and isolate the IHVC down to the left renal vein.\nSlightly displace the IHVC with a cotton swab to expose and then cauterize any small veins merging into the right side of the IHVC, using the bi-polar electrosurgical unit. Also cauterize any lumbar veins merging into the IHVC.\nDivide the right suprarenal (adrenal) vein between two 7-0 silk ligatures, staying close to the IHVC. Free the liver from its posterior ligaments by cutting these under gentle traction.\nIsolate the right renal vein from the right renal artery and from the neighboring tissue using a fine-tip cautery. Seal the right renal vein orifice with an 8-0 non absorbable sterile ligature.\nDetach the fat covering the PV to locate the pyloric vein (right gastric vein) and the splenic vein at the points where they merge the PV. Ligate these veins with 7-0 silk, reinforcing the side closest to the PV with an 8-0 non absorbable sterile suture stitch. Divide the veins between the ties.",
    "NOTE: Expose the PV by using small, wet gauze to draw back the duodenum. The insertion of the cuff is easier if fat is detached from the PV, which also prevents stenosis of the PV cuff.\nInject 300 IU of heparin sodium into the IHVC, diluted to 1 mL of normal saline, using a 1 mL syringe (31 G needle).\nMake an incision 5 mm below the BD bifurcation and insert the BD stent into the common BD. Secure the stent with a 7-0 silk ligature 1 mm above the incision. An extra tie can be made below the incision, which is 10 mm below the bifurcation. Once the stent is secured, cut the BD between these two ties.\nNever clip the BD or proper hepatic artery (HA). Place a 10-0 non absorbable sterile surgical monofilament suture stitch at the 3 o'clock position in the BD at the incision as a marker to prevent twisting after reconnection.\nExpose the proper HA and divide the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) between two 7-0 silk ligatures. Expose the left gastric artery, splenic artery, and celiac trunk. Tie the three arteries both distally and close to their take-offs.\nCut the left gastric artery, splenic artery, and celiac trunk between the artery ties. Slowly inject 20 mL of cold (4 °C) Ringer's lactate solution into the PV, using a 20 mL syringe with a 21.5 G needle. Cut the vena cava below the point at which the left renal vein merges with the IHVC to permit flush outflow.\n\tNOTE: The needle should be kept as far as possible from the hilum. The donor liver cold perfusion should last between 1-2 min. While flushing the liver, use the other hand to squirt cold Ringer's lactate onto the liver surface.",
    "Cut the PV trunk below the splenic vein after the flush. Cut the IHVC just above the left renal vein. Cut the SHVC directly adjacent to the diaphragm.\nCut the ligaments and connective tissue between the liver and retroperitoneum.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that there are sufficient lengths of the anterior and posterior SHVC walls to facilitate the upper caval anastomosis. It is crucial to cut immediately adjacent to the diaphragm to retain as much length as possible.\nAfter the liver has been removed from the abdomen, quickly place it into a dish filled with 4 °C Ringer's lactate solution. Place the dish on top of an ice pad to maintain a cold temperature.\nDiscard the donor rat's remains, following institutional guidelines.\n3. Donor rat liver preparation (\"back bench\")\nFill the cold Petri dish with a sufficient volume of 4 °C Ringer's lactate solution to submerge the donor rat liver. Carefully rotate the donor liver floating in the dish carefully so that the inferior surface faces upward. Put the cuffs for PV and IHVC (Supplementary Material 1 and Supplementary Material 2, respectively) into the dish.\nPull the PV through the PV cuff and fold the end of the vein over the cuff. Tie the PV securely around the cuff using 7-0 silk. Flush the PV with 10 mL of 4 °C Ringer's lactate solution.\nRepeat step 3.2 with the IHVC, without the flush.\nRemove the fat tissue around the celiac trunk. Form a larger arterial sleeve cuff by cutting open the bifurcation of the celiac trunk, splenic artery, and left gastric artery (Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: It is difficult to insert the arterial stent into the common HA. Stretch and straighten the artery out with forceps several times before inserting the stent. Make sure that the bevel of the stent faces upward and that the artery is not twisted (Figure 2B).\nPut the 1.5 mm length 24 G arterial stent into the donor common HA via the arterial cuff. Secure the stent with an 8-0 polypropylene ligature (Figure 2C) and flush the stent with Ringer's lactate solution (Figure 2D).\nPosition a micro-clamp (4-6 mm in length) onto the proximal IHVC, which is intended to prevent blood loss after portal reperfusion and avoid air embolism.\nRotate the liver and expose its superior side. Insert two 8-0 polypropylene taper point sutures on the lateral and medial edges of the SHVC.\nKeep the liver at 4 °C so it is ready for transplantation into the donor.\n4. Recipient operation\nRefer to the donor operation section above and repeat steps 2.1-2.4.\n\tNOTE: Male Lewis rats aged 12-14 weeks old are used here, weighing 5-20 g heavier than the donors. During the surgery, monitor the depth of anesthesia by noting the breathing rate, heart rate, coloration of the organs/mucous membranes, and presence of any pedal withdrawal reflexes.\nLay the surgically draped rat with its ventral side facing upwards. Place the nose in the anesthesia scavenger for isoflurane inhalation. Moisten the eyes with opthalamic lubricant. Prepare the abdominal wall with providone-iodine first, then with 70% ethanol.\nInject 5 mL of Ringer's lactate solution subcutaneously on both lower sides of the ventral abdominal wall. Use a surgical assistant's aide to inject 0.5 mL of 200 mg/kg piperacillin sodium intramuscularly into the left abdominal wall before laparotomy. In addition, administer 0.5 mL of 10 mg/mL bupivacaine subcutaneously into the right abdominal wall.",
    "NOTE: Administer the same dose of piperacillin sodium 1x/day for 3 days post-operatively.\nPrepare the abdominal wall again with providone–iodine first and then with 70% ethanol. Make a midline incision from the sternal xiphoid to 1 cm above the pubic symphysis. Decrease isoflurane to 2%, 0.5 L/min air flow, and FiO2 70% for maintenance of anesthesia after making the incision.\n\tNOTE: Mosquito forceps can be used to grasp the xiphoid process and retract the cephalad. Fix the mosquito forceps in place using tape. The body cavity is kept open by 3D-printed retractors (see Supplementary Material 3) on both sides with rubber bands magnetically held to the surgical platform.\nWrap the small and large intestines with a wet, nonwoven gauze sponge (4 cm x 4 cm) dampened with Ringer's lactate solution. Use a small (2 cm x 4 cm), wet, nonwoven gauze sponge dampened with Ringer's lactate solution to gently cover the liver.\nPlace a small 3D-printed support pad (back holder; see Supplementary Material 4) under the rat midsection to increase exposure of the SHVC by flexing the spin. This can safely be performed in rats and is executed by a surgeon assistant.\nCut the falciform ligament and use the small, wet nonwoven gauze sponge to gently retract the liver away the xiphoid process and expose the left diaphragmatic vein. Separate the left diaphragmatic vein from the SHVC using micro-forceps. Ligate the left diaphragmatic vein with 7-0 silk close to the diaphragm.\nCut the left triangular and the gastro-hepatic ligaments with round-tipped scissors.\nPull the left and middle lobes delicately toward the xiphoid process with a small, wet nonwoven gauze sponge to reveal the caudate lobe. Sever the ligament that separates the caudate lobe from the remainder of the liver.",
    "Divide the hepato-esophageal ligament and coagulate any bleeding points with the bi-polar electrosurgical unit, staying close to the liver. Cut the ligaments at the posterior aspect of the liver.\nRetract the small and large intestines carefully to the left side of the abdominal cavity and cover them with wet, nonwoven gauze.\nDissect the retroperitoneum and fat on the IHVC to expose and isolate the IHVC down to the right renal vein. Slightly displace the IHVC with a cotton swab and cauterize any small veins merging into the right side of the IHVC, using the bi-polar electrosurgical unit. Similarly, cauterize any lumbar veins entering the IHVC.\nDivide the right suprarenal (adrenal) vein between two 7-0 silk ligatures. Free the liver from its posterior ligaments by cutting them under gentle traction.\nUse small, wet gauze dampened with Ringer's lactate solution to retract the duodenum and expose the PV. Detach fat from the bifurcation of the PV and pyloric vein.\nDivide the BD 0.5 cm below its hilar bifurcation and insert a BD stent into the distal common BD. Secure the stent in position with a 7-0 ligature about 0.2 mm below the incision. An extra tie can be placed above the incision, close to the bifurcation. Cut the BD close to liver but distal to the tie.\nSeparate the BD with forceps and avoid clipping the BD or proper HA. Place a 10-0 non absorbable monofilament (e.g., ethilon) stitch at the 3 o'clock position in the BD as a marker to prevent twisting after reconnection.\nExpose the proper HA and the bifurcation of the common HA and GDA. Expose the left HA, middle HA, and right HA. Tie the three arteries distal to the CHA bifurcation and cut the arteries close to the liver, above the ties.",
    "Put a long thin piece of gauze behind the SHVC.\nPlace a 3D-printed IHVC holder or \"handle\" (Cava 150g 2.1; see Supplementary Material 5) behind the IHVC, and sew the ends of the 3D-printed \"handle\" together using 10-0 non absorbable monofilament suture (Figure 3A).\nPlace a 3D-printed PV holder or \"handle\" (Porta 1.4.1-see Supplementary Material 6) behind the PV, directly inferior to the liver, and sew the ends of the 3D-printed \"handle\" together using 10-0 non absorbable monofilament suture.\nLoosely tie a 7-0 silk ligature below both 3D-printed holders (IHVC and PV) (Figure 3A).\nClamp the IHVC just above the right renal vein, which should still be below the 3D-printed caval holder.\nClamp the PV just above the pyloric vein, which should be below the 3D-printed PV holder. Record the anhepatic time, which begins at this point. Decrease to 0.5% isoflurane, 0.5 L/min air flow, and 70% FiO2 for maintenance of anesthesia.\nFlush 2 mL of 37 °C Ringer's lactate solution via the bifurcation of the PV using a 3 mL syringe with a 27 G needle attached.\nClamp the SHVC above the liver with a Kitzmiller clamp. Cut below the same clamp, staying as close to the liver as possible.\nCut above the 3D-printed holders for both the PV and IHVC (Figure 3A). Remove the recipient's liver. Carefully orient the donor liver and position it in the recipient's body cavity in such a way that the upper caval anastomosis can be created.\nUse an 8-0 polypropylene running suture to join the donor's SHVC with the recipient's SHVC near the diaphragm. First, place stay sutures of 8-0 polypropylene to the left and right aspects of the donor and recipient SHVC. Then, tie these down on the outside of the vein wall.",
    "Use the left 8-0 polypropylene to stitch the posterior wall of the SHVC from left to right and tie to the right 8-0 polypropylene. Use the left 8-0 polypropylene to stitch the anterior wall of the SHVC anastomosis from left to right, leaving the last two-thirds of the suture line loose. Flush using 20 mL of Ringer's lactate in between the loose stitches while making sure to extract any air bubbles.\nTighten the loose stitches and make a tie on the outside of the SHVC. Cut the remaining 8-0 polypropylene suture.\n\tNOTE: The clip holds the recipient's SHVC in place, making it easier to sew the donor and recipient's SHVC together. Record the duration of SHVC anastomosis. At this point, the porta handles are attached to the holder arm apparatus (holder arm McGil + holder mini arm LAB + holder arm soft part 1.3; see Supplementary Material 7, Supplementary Material 8, and Supplementary Material 9, respectively), directly inferior to the liver. This apparatus is supported by a 3D-printed holder base (holder base 3.1; see Supplementary Material 10).\nInsert the PV cuff (Supplementary Material 1) from the donor into the recipient PV and tighten the 7-0 silk tie. Flush the PV of the donor and recipient with Ringer's lactate solution warmed to 37 °C before the connection.\nRemove the atraumatic clamp from the SHVC (first), then the microvascular clip for the PV (second). Re-perfuse the liver with warm blood; at this point, the anhepatic phase time has ended. Record this time.\nPour 10 mL of warm Ringer's lactate solution on top of the liver to warm. Remove the 3D-printed holders with round-tipped scissors (cut the securing stitch).",
    "Insert the donor IHVC cuff (Supplementary Material 2) into the recipient IHVC and secure with a 7-0 silk tie. Remove the donor IHVC clip first, then the recipient's clip (Figure 3B). The cava is attached to the holder apparatus and holder base as described above,\nRemove the 3D printer holders (porta and cava) with round-tipped scissors (cut the securing stitch; Figure 3C), resulting in a connected IHVC (Figure 3D).\nCarefully examine the area around the liver for any bleeding. Instil 3 mL of 37 °C Ringer's lactate solution inside the body cavity.\nArterial anastomosis: cut off the portion of the celiac trunk from the donor that extends beyond the stent.\nClamp the recipient's proper HA and cut off the tie at the end. Cut off any extra tissue surrounding the vessel (Figure 4A). With Ringer's lactate solution, flush the lumens of both donor and recipient vessel ends.\nPull the recipient proper HA into the sleeve of the donor HA stent to accomplish the HA anastomosis. Place a 10-0 ethilon through the left aspect of the (donor) HA, 2.5 mm above the distal orifice of the stent (from outside to inside), then out through the end of the stent, with 10-0 ethilon (4 cm length) guided by a curved needle (Figure 4B).\nTransfix the recipient proper HA 0.5 mm below the vessel orifice, placing the stitch first (from inside to outside) to the left side of the vessel, then (from outside to inside) to the right side of the artery.",
    "Place the suture through the right wall of the (donor) HA from the inside to outside, at a distance from the stent orifice identical to the original stitch. Pull up on the two ends of the 10-0 non absorbable monofilament, which will slip the recipient proper HA up and into the HA stent (Figure 4C).\n\tNOTE: Observe for pumping of blood. One option is to cut the donor GDA to confirm that blood is pumping through the anastomosis. Make sure to re-tie the artery before moving onto the next step of the procedure if the GDA is severed.\nTie the 10-0 non absorbable monofilament with itself, over the donor HA (Figure 4D). The arterial anastomosis is now complete.\nBiliary anastomosis: place a tie loosely around the recipient BD and stent (Figure 5A), then remove the BD stent. Flush the BD of both recipient and donor before the biliary connection is complete.\nInsert the donor's BD stent into the recipient's bile duct (Figure 5B) and tighten the tie that was previously placed around the recipient BD (Figure 5C).\nReturn the intestines to the body cavity. Instill 2 mL of 37 °C Ringer's lactate solution into the cavity to flush it. Soak some of the solution up with gauze.\nEnsure that the intestines are back in their original position before sewing up the parietal peritoneum and skin with 5-0 monocryl.\nClose the incision in two layers with 5-0 monocryl. Inject 0.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine around the sewn parietal peritoneum and repeat this once the skin is sewn together.",
    "Gently swaddle the recipient rat in a paper towel when transferring to the cage. Allow the animal free access to water and food from the time of awakening. Keep a warm water-circulating blanket under one-half of the cage for 24-38 h. One rat is designated to one cage during the immediate post-operative period.\n5. Post-operative care\nSoak food pellets in water and place them in a Petri dish on the cage floor.\nMonitor the heart rate, breathing rate, and skin color of the rat.\nAdminister piperacillin on post-operative days 1, 2, and 3. Administer buprenorphine subcutaneously and monitor for any signs of pain such as any behavioral changes, lethargy, ungroomed fur, depression, mutilation, or loss of appetite for the first 72 h.\n\tNOTE: Pain is assessed at least 2x daily for 3 days post-transplantation, then at least 1x daily onwards."
