Example of the Xcaliber Processing Setup for peak identification Creation of sequence setups in Xcaliber software for calibration standards and samples Create a sequence file using the “Sequence Setup” window in Xcaliber consisting of 11 entries for the calibration standards. It is important to reference the instrument method file under heading “Inst Meth” and the processing method under “Proc Meth”.Give a file path and name for the calibration file in the sequence table under the heading “Cal File”.Create a sequence file for the planned number of samples and enter the name of the calibration file to be used under the heading “Cal File”.Note that the tray holder and slot position is only important for calibration standards 1 to 6 since the remainder of injections are done manually.Details to create sequence files are further illustrated in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315190622_6083.jpgFigure 4. Steps to follow in the Xcaliber software to create sequence files Collection of plant material Detach two leaflets (one leaflet each from two terminal shoots) from the compound leaf closest to the terminal bud by manually breaking them off at the natural abscission layer. Remove up to 20 terminal buds (4–8 mm in length, depending on bud stage and size) with straight sharp Iris scissors. Insert the leaflets and buds into the 20 and 2 mL vials, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5. This will yield minimum masses for buds and leaves of 0.2 and 1.1 g, respectively. The actual mass of plant material is not critical because the calculated rate of C2H4 release is normalized to unit mass of plant material. Refer to equation 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4636/bioprotoc-13-06-4636-g005.jpgFigure 5.",
    "Leaves and buds sealed in 20 mL (left) and 2 mL (right) vials, respectively Document the time of harvesting of each individual sample as reference for the standardization of the 10 min duration required for the release of wound ethylene (see next step).Leave vials open for 10.0 ± 0.5 min after insertion to allow for release of wound ethylene. This can readily be achieved at the location of harvesting under ambient conditions.After the 10-min equilibration time, seal the 20 mL vials with 20 mm Si/PTFE septa and 20 mm aluminum crimp caps using the 20 mm hand crimper.Ensure that the septa inside the crimp caps have the PTFE face downwards as illustrated in Figure 6, i.e., the PTFE face will contact the beveled edge of the headspace vial.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315190717_7308.jpgFigure 6. Position of a Si/PTFE septum inside a crimp cap. A. Top view. B. Bottom view.Close the screw caps on the 2 mL vials hand-tight following the 10-min equilibration time.Document the time when each individual vial is sealed as starting time of the 3-h incubation period (see step H1).Preparation and GC measurements of C2H4 calibration standards by headspace vial dilution For calibration standards 1 to 6, seal 6 × 20 mL headspace vials containing ambient air with 20 mm magnetic crimp caps and 20 mm Si/PTFE septa.With a 2-stage regulator connected to a 79 μL·L-1 C2H4 gas cylinder, seal the low-pressure outlet with a custom sized Si/PTFE septum inside a nut.Set the outlet pressure of the regulator to 50 kPa. It is important not to exceed 100 kPa as it presents a danger to equipment and personnel due to the nature of the configuration of the outlet. The initial pressure setting is done as follows:The cylinder shut-off valve is in the closed position.",
    "Turn the control knob on the regulator fully counterclockwise to have the regulator outlet in the closed position.Open the cylinder shut-off valve and close it immediately again; this will charge the inlet stem and regulator with the cylinder gas.The reading on the regulator’s high-pressure gauge now indicates the cylinder pressure.Turn the regulator’s control knob slowly clockwise until the low-pressure gauge reads 50 kPa.Purge the regulator three times with the analytical gas from the valve side to the low-pressure outlet of the regulator as follows:It is important to have the cylinder shut-off valve closed at the start of the procedure.Insert a 23 gauge needle through the septum on the low-pressure outlet.Monitor the pressure on the high-pressure gauge of the regulator until it decreases close to the zero reading. Remove the needle just prior to the gauge reaching zero. This implies that the needle should be removed before the low-pressure gauge decreases from 50 kPa. A small decrease in outlet pressure from the 50 kPa setting can be tolerated as long as the gauge pressure remains positive to prevent air from flowing back into the outlet of the regulator.Open the cylinder valve and close it again to charge the inlet stem and regulator once more.Insert the needle through the septum again and repeat steps 4a–4d three times. The necessity of purging in triplicate is to ensure that all air inside the inlet stem and regulator is replaced by gas from the cylinder and thereby ensuring that the actual analytical gas is aspirated when preparing standards.Use the 100 μL and 2,500 μL syringes to aspirate volumes of analytical gas from the low-pressure outlet of the regulator that is connected to the 79 μL·L-1 C2H4 gas cylinder. Figure 7 presents the technique for extracting gas from a cylinder using a gastight syringe.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4636/bioprotoc-13-06-4636-g007.jpgFigure 7.",
    "Aspirating a volume of C2H4 through a septum from a pressure regulator The required volumes, Vsyringe, for injection into the 20 mL headspace vials are specified in column 3 of Table 4, with a photographic illustration of the use of a 100 μL syringe given in Figure 8. A needle insertion depth of 30 mm is sufficient.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4636/bioprotoc-13-06-4636-g008.jpgFigure 8. Use of a 100 μL syringe to dilute C2H4 gas in a headspace vial The syringe technique should consist of a volume extraction that exceeds the specified volume. The syringe plunger can then be pushed back to the required volume to eliminate pressure effects inside the syringe.Inject 1 mL volumes of standards 1 to 6, Vinj, into the GC using the Triplus autosampler with the configurations as described for the instrument method, as well as processing and sequence setups. An automated injection step using a headspace tool is presented by the photograph in Figure 9.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4636/bioprotoc-13-06-4636-g009.jpgFigure 9. Automated injection with a headspace tool Since an FID is a mass sensitive detector, the calibration is performed based on the quantity of analytical gas, i.e., C2H4, injected into the split liner, V’inj. The values presented in Table 4 can be obtained by means of equations 1 to 3:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315193313_8581.jpg(1),imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315203353_7987.jpg (2),imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315205808_5233.jpg (3).Definition of the variables are as follows:Ccylinder = concentration of C2H4 in the gas cylinder (μL·L-1),Vvial = volume of headspace vial (mL),Vsyringe = volume aspirated into syringe (μL),v’ = volume C2H4 in the syringe (μL),C’vial = concentration C2H4 in headspace vial (nL·L-1),Vinj = total volume gas injected into the GC liner (mL), andV’inj = volume of C2H4 injected into the GC liner (nL).Table 4.

Apply again the technique of extracting volumes in excess of the required and then moving the plunger to the required volume.Table 5.

    "Thereafter “dilute” the analytical gas with air by setting the plunger to the 1000 μL mark.Inject 1 mL of standards 7 to 11 manually into the GC during a programmed calibration sequence in the Xcaliber software.Limit the insertion depth of the needle into the split liner to 50 mm.Observe that a dead volume, Vdead, of the 2,500 μL syringe that contributes to the volume of analytical gas is indicated in Table 5. This value is syringe-specific.Calculate the volume of C2H4, V’inj-IS, injected into the liner in nL units by means of equation 4:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315222143_2174.jpg (4).Preparation and GC measurements of blanks and C2H4 quality control (QC) standards For the 20 mL headspace QC vials, seal 4 × 20 mL headspace vials, containing only ambient air, with 20 mm aluminum crimp caps and 20 mm Si/PTFE septa.For the 2 mL screw top QC vials, close the screw tops of 4 × 2 mL vials. These vials also only contain ambient air.For the C2H4 QC standards, use a 100 μL gastight syringe to aspirate 20 μL and 80 μL of the C2H4 standard to prepare three technical replicates of the 2 mL and 20 mL vials, respectively.To sample the respective gas volumes for QC samples, aspirate from the regulator in excess of the required volume, move the plunger back to the exact required volume and then inject into the respective vials.Refer to Table 6 for data on the prepared C2H4 QC samples.Table 6. Required vial and syringe volumes to prepare C2H4 QC samples table:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6\nCcylinder (μL·L-1),Vvial (mL),Vsyringe (μL),v’(μL),C’vial (nL·L-1),Vinj (mL),V’inj (nL)\n79,2,20,1.580 × 10-3,790,0.5,0.316\n79,20,80,6.320 × 10-3,316,1,0.301",
    "The total number of prepared QC vials consists of 1 × 2 mL blank (containing ambient air), 1 × 20 mL blank (containing ambient air), a 3 × 2 mL C2H4 QC standards (containing 20 μL of C2H4 standard), and a 3 × 20 mL C2H4 QC standards (containing 80 μL of C2H4 standard).Perform gas sampling from the QC vials using disposable 3 mL syringes with luer valves, each connected to a 23 gauge needle of 51 mm length. An example of a syringe with a luer valve can be seen in Figure 10.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4636/bioprotoc-13-06-4636-g010.jpgFigure 10. Disposable 3 mL syringe with luer lock and attached needle Aspirate 1 mL and 0.5 mL from the 20 mL and 2 mL vials, respectively.An advisable syringe technique is to cycle the required volume two times with the needle stationary through the septum prior to aspirating the required volume.Take care to close the luer valve while holding the plunger in position for the required aspiration volume. This is specifically relevant when sampling 0.5 mL from a 2 mL vial, i.e., air pressure will restore the plunger to a volume less than extracted, which is prevented by ensuring that the valve is closed prior to releasing the syringe plunger. The technique to achieve this is demonstrated by the sequence of photographs in Figure 11.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315190835_8729.jpgFigure 11.

Withdrawing of a gas sample by moving the plunger outwards. C. Closing the valve’s luer lock while holding the plunger in position at the required volume.Use a clean 3 mL syringe to flush needles that are alternating between vials to ensure any C2H4 gas is expelled from the needles.",
    "Inject the QC samples manually into the GC liner during a programmed sequence.The syringe can be inserted with its full length through the injector’s septum, i.e., 51 mm, to agree with the programmed injection depth setting of 50 mm. The manual injection process is illustrated by the sequence of photographs in Figure 12.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230315/20230315190915_2884.jpgFigure 12. Sequence of steps for manual injection. A. Positioning the needle on top of the injector. B. Inserting the needle through the septum. C. Opening the valve’s luer lock while maintaining control of the syringe’s plunger to prevent the head pressure from pushing the plunger upwards. D. Pressing the plunger down to inject the gas sample into the injector.GC measurements of C2H4 evolved from leaves and buds Perform gas sampling 3.00 ± 0.05 h after sealing vials using disposable 3 mL syringes with luer valves connected to 23 gauge needles of 51 mm length. The 3-h incubation period for each vial consists of the total time the plant material is allowed to release C2H4 under sealed conditions. It includes time between sealing of the vials at the location of collection (orchard), transport to the laboratory, and monitored time on the laboratory bench pending gas sampling. The 3-h incubation period is effectively terminated once gas is sampled from a vial using a syringe with a luer valve.An advisable syringe technique is to cycle the required volume twice with the needle stationary through the septum prior to aspirating the final required volume.The volumes to aspirate are 1 mL and 0.5 mL from the 20 mL and 2 mL vials, respectively. Piercing of the plant material should not occur. In the case of leaves, this is prevented by the technique with which the leaves are inserted into the vial, i.e., predominantly against the wall of the vial.",
    "In the case of the buds, the insertion of the needle is visibly controlled to avoid contact with the plant material. Moreover, the needle has a dome tip with a side hole.Take care to close the luer valve while holding the plunger in position for the required aspiration volume as described under G10.Document the sampling time of each vial.Use a clean 3 mL syringe to flush needles that are alternating between sample vials to ensure any C2H4 gas is expelled from the needles.Once a headspace volume is aspirated into a syringe and locked, the syringe can be stored for the duration of the sequence of chromatography measurements.Inject gas samples manually into the GC in accordance with a programmed sequence file.The needle can be inserted with its full length through the injector’s septum as described under G13.Weighing of plant material Following chromatography analysis, remove the 20 mL vial caps with a pair of pliers and unscrew the caps of the 2 mL vials for weighing the vials individually with their contents.Remove the contents and weigh the masses of the empty 20 mL and 2 mL vials as associated with each sample number."
