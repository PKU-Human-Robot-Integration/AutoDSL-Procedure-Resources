    "This protocol adheres to the animal care guidelines of the University of California, Los Angeles (ARC protocol #2010-075). Readers are advised to adhere to their own IACUC-approved protocol, as peri-procedure mouse care and analgesia management may be institution-specific.\n1. Preparation of isoproterenol osmotic pump\nNOTE: This procedure has been applied successfully on 9+ week-old female mice weighing 18+ g from over 100 inbred mouse strains, as well as, in male mice in a subset of strains. There is no maximum body weight limit for this procedure. Always include age-matched controls, as it is unknown whether the age of treatment affects isoproterenol-induced susceptibility to heart failure development.\nWeigh and record the body weight for each mouse.\nCalculate the appropriate amount and concentration of isoproterenol for each mouse (See Table 1 ; Supplemental File).\n\tNOTE: The osmotic pumps used in this experiment (Table of Materials) have a reservoir volume of 100 µL and are designed to deliver drugs at continuous flow rates for up to 28 days. Prepare an extra 20 µL of isoproterenol solution per pump to account for the volume loss in the filling tube during pump loading.\nWeigh out the appropriate amount of isoproterenol (Table 1) using an analytical balance and dissolve it in 120 µL of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. Pipette vigorously or vortex for 1 min to completely solubilize isoproterenol.\n\tNOTE: Prepare the osmotic pumps in a laboratory biosafety cabinet. Pumps should be handled with surgical gloves. Sterile technique is recommended throughout the preparation of the osmotic pumps and during the surgical implantation procedure.\nWeigh and record the empty osmotic pump together with its flow moderator and then remove the flow moderator.\nAspirate 120 µL of isoproterenol solution into a 1.0 mL syringe and attach the 27-gauge blunt-tipped filling tube provided with the osmotic pumps.",
    "NOTE: Make sure the syringe and filling tube are free of air bubbles.\nWhile holding the pump in the upright position, insert the filling tube through the pump opening at the top until the tip of the filling tube sits near the bottom of the pump reservoir.\nLoad the osmotic pump by pushing the syringe plunger slowly until the isoproterenol solution fills up to the pump opening.\nCarefully remove the filling tube and wipe off the excess solution.\nInsert back the flow moderator to close the pump and wipe off any excess solution.\nConfirm that over 90% of the reservoir volume has been filled by reweighing the osmotic pump.\n\tNOTE: Control pumps are prepared in the same manner by filling the pump reservoir with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution.\n2. Preparation of surgical instruments\nClean all surgical instruments, including fiber optic O-ring light microscope illuminator, 2 forceps, needle holder, hot bead sterilizers, glass beads, and scissors (Table of Materials).\nAutoclave surgical instruments at 121° C for 30 min to sterilize instruments prior to surgery.\n3. Isoproterenol osmotic pump surgical implantation\nInduce anesthesia by placing the mouse in an induction chamber with 3% isoflurane in 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Maintain anesthesia with 2% isoflurane via a nosecone.\nAdminister 5 mg/kg carprofen s.c. to the scruff of the neck between the shoulder blades for analgesia.\nPlace ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent corneal dehydration.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by monitoring the respiration rate, toe pinch reflex, and color of the mucous membrane.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on a heated pad. Remove hair from the lower abdomen and disinfect the skin with betadine or chlorhexidine.\n\tNOTE: To minimize post-operative infection, ensure that the surgical field is free of incident hair.",
    "Use a pair of surgical scissors to cut a 1 cm-long midline skin incision. Use a pair of blunt-ended scissors to carefully dissect the skin from the underlying peritoneal walls.\n\tNOTE: An intraperitoneal delivery is preferred to accommodate the size of the pump.\nPull the peritoneal walls away from the underlying bowel with forceps and cut a 0.8 cm hole in the peritoneal walls using fine surgical scissors.\nInsert the osmotic pump into the peritoneal cavity with the flow moderator end first.\nClose the hold in the peritoneal walls using 5.0 absorbable sutures in an interrupted fashion. Use 6.0 non-absorbable sutures to close the skin incision in an interrupted fashion.\nPlace the mouse in a dedicated incubator to keep it warm and dry during recovery. Assess recovery from anesthesia by monitoring the mouse every 30 mins in the first two hours for return of normal breathing and movement.\nOnce the mouse has fully recovered from anesthesia, return it to routine housing. Continue to monitor the animal for complications daily up to 3 days and then every 2 to 3 days thereafter until the end of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Animals should be monitored for evidence of post-operative pain or infection, signs of weight loss, lack of mobility, abnormal posture, failure to groom, and excessive licking or biting of the incision area.\nAdminister carprofen 5mg/kg s.c. every 24 h for up to 48 h and thereafter as needed.\nAdminister 0.25 mg/mL amoxicillin in drinking water for 5 days to prevent surgical site infections.\nRemove non-absorbable sutures after 7 to 10 days.\n4. Echocardiographic assessment under anesthesia\nNOTE: Echocardiographic assessment can be performed repeatedly to monitor serial cardiac remodeling over several weeks. We performed echocardiographic measurements at weekly intervals over 3 weeks.",
    "Induce anesthesia in an induction chamber at 1.25% to 1.5% of isoflurane. Once appropriately sedated, secure the mouse onto the echocardiography platform with tape allowing the mouse to continue receiving anesthesia through a nose cone.\nDecrease isoflurane to a maintenance dosage of 1% to minimize negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of over-sedation. Take note of respiratory and heart rates throughout the study and adjust isoflurane dosage as needed.\nRemove the chest hair with a depilatory lotion and wipe the chest free of hair.\nPlace the ultrasound gel on the chest and position the ultrasound probe to image the heart.\nIn B-mode, image the left ventricle (LV) in the parasternal long-axis view. Adjust the echocardiography platform to align the aortic valve and the LV apex in the plane of the ultrasound beam.\nTilt the echocardiography platform to place the LV long axis at 90 degrees to the ultrasound beam and the LV maximum diameter at the center of the image.\nImage the LV short axis by turning the ultrasound probe 90 degrees.\nIn M-mode measure LV wall thickness and internal dimensions.\nPlace the mouse back into the cage. Monitor for return of normal breathing and spontaneous body movements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
