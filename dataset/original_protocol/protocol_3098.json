    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMaintain and passage hPSCs (Day −5)\nCoating the dish(es) for hPSCs culture\nTiming: 2–16 h\nResuspend a frozen aliquot of BioLamina 521 (LN521, 100 μg/mL) in 1 mL PBS++ to have a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL LN521 (50 μL LN521 per mL PBS++).\nMix well without vortexing.\nAdd 1 mL to coat the dish (Ø35 mm dish).\nLeave the coated dish at 37°C incubator for 2 h or at 4°C overnight (16–20 h).\nNote: The coated dish(es) can be kept at 4°C for up to 4 weeks, make sure the coated surface does not dehydrate. LN521 coating solution can not be reused.\nPassage hPSCs\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step is to grow hPSCs to 75%–80% confluency for starting a midbrain MiCO experiment. hPSCs are cultured under feeder-free condition on Biolaminin (LN521, 0.5 μg/cm2 in PBS++) coated dishes. We used gentle cell dissociation buffer (0.5 mM EDTA in PBS- -) to passage the hPSCs and plated 40,000–50,000 cells on a dish (Ø = 35 mm, 9 cm2) and cultured for 5 days. We normally start this step on a Wednesday, and then the cells will be ready to be used on a Monday to start a vmDA MiCOs generation experiment.\nGentle cell dissociation buffer is prepared by adding 10 μL of EDTA (0.5 M) to 10 mL of PBS- - to have final 0.5 mM EDTA solution.\nPre-warm E8 media to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate LN521 solution from the pre-coated dish(es) and replace with 1 mL of fresh E8 media.\nAspirate the hPSCs culture media and wash the cells one time with PBS--.\nAspirate the PBS--, and add 1 mL of gentle cell dissociation buffer.\nWait for 6–8 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).",
    "Note: The incubation time can vary between different cell lines. It also depends on how recently the gentle cell dissociation buffer was prepared. We recommend using the gentle cell dissociation buffer within two weeks.\nAspirate the gentle cell dissociation buffer, add 1 mL fresh E8 media.\nUse P1000 pipette to scrape cells off from the dish.\nPipette the cell suspension once to twice to break the colonies into smaller pieces.\nCollect the cells and transfer them to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nUse a P200 pipette to take out 100 μL cell suspension and transfer to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nPipette up and down about 20–25 times to have single cell suspension.\nTake out 10 μL for counting the cell density.\nCalculate cell number and plate 40,000 cells on the pre-coated LN521 dish with E8 media. Make sure the cells distribute uniformly on the dish(es).\nTransfer the dish(es) into a 37°C incubator. Media change every two or three days.\nNote: Cell seeding density is cell line dependent. For GBA-002-C3 (DANi-002C) cell line, we need to seed 8000 cells/cm2.\nStart a midbrain MiCO generation experiment (Day 0)\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step is to generate MiCOs from AggreWell™400 24-well plate. We have tested cell numbers ranging from 50 to 1000 per MiCO. And we recommend that 300 to 750 cells per MiCO is a good range for generating MiCOs.\nPrepare AggreWell™400 24-well plate\nAdd 500 μL Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution to the number of wells to be used.\nCentrifuge 1300 x g for 5 min.\nCheck the microwells under a microscope to ensure that there are no bubbles in wells. If there are any bubbles, repeat step 13.\nAspirate Anti-Adherence Rising Solution from the well(s).\nRinse the well(s) with pre-warm N2B27 media (2 mL/well).",
    "Aspirate N2B27 media and add prewarm N2B27 media (1 mL/well) containing small molecules (Midbrain floor plate patterning media (day0-day9)) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.\nLeave the AggreWell™400 24-well plate in the incubator at 37°C.\nNote: A balance plate is needed for step 13.\nPrepare hPSCs\nUnder the stereomicroscope, use a glass pipette to scrape off and remove any differentiated cells.\nAspirate E8 medium from the dish.\nGently wash the cells with 1 mL PBS--.\nAspirate the PBS--, add 1 mL of Gentle Cell Dissociation Buffer.\nWait for 6–8 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate the gentle cell dissociation buffer, add 1 mL N2B27 containing Small Molecules (Midbrain floor plate patterning media (day0-day9)) and ROCK inhibitor.\nUse P1000 pipette to scrape cells off from the dish.\nPipette the cell suspension once to twice to break the colonies into smaller pieces.\nCollect the cells and transfer them to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nSeeding hPSCs on AggreWell™400 24-well plate\nUse a P200 pipette to take out 100 μL cell suspension from step 24 and transfer to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nPipette up and down about 20–25 times to have single cell suspension.\nTake out 10 μL for counting the cell density.\nRepeat cell counting and aim for the difference between the two counts is less than 20%.\nCalculate the volume of cell suspension to be used for seeding. Add the cell suspension to the well of Aggrewell™400 and add N2B27 containing Small Molecules (Midbrain floor plate patterning media (day0-day9)) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor to achieve a final volume of 2 mL/well.",
    "Note: For step 26, the cell suspension volume added should be less than 1 mL. If the cell density is too low, spin down and resuspend to have cell density above 1 million cells/mL. There are approximately 1,200 microwells per well of the AggreWell™400 24-well plate. If desired 500 cells/microwell then seed 600,000 (500∗1200) live cells per well (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nFor a new cell line, cell number titration can be done by seeding different cell amounts per MiCO. For example, if the cell numbers per MiCO are 300, 500, and 750, three wells of AggreWell™400 will be seeded with 360,000 (300∗1200), 600,000 (500∗1200), and 900,000 (750∗1200) live cells, respectively. MiCOs are maintained as described below and sizes of the MiCOs will be measured and necrotic center formation will be tested by Cleaved Caspase-3 staining. The optimized cell amount is achieved when the size of the MiCOs do not exceed 800 μm and no necrotic center is detected.\nPipette cells carefully up and down several times without introducing bubbles to the well.\nImmediately centrifuge at 100 x g for 3 min and check even cell distribution under a microscope.\nPlace the plate in the incubator. This day is day 0 of the culturing period.\nNote: For step 28, a balance plate is needed.\nHalf-medium change for AggreWell™400 24-well plate (Day 2- Day9)\nTiming: 10 min\nHalf media change with P1000 every second day (or more often if medium color changes to yellow) by slowly remove 1 mL media from the top of the liquid and add 1 mL of new media without disturbing the MiCOs.\nUse Olympus IX53 microscope to follow the size of the MiCOs. On day 4 to day 9 when the MiCO size reaches approximately 200 μm following the step 40- step 49, transfer the MiCOs to EB-Disk360.",
    "Transferring from AggreWell™400 to EB-Disk360\nCoating EB-Disk360 for MiCO culture\nTiming: 24 h\nUnder aseptic conditions add 3 mL of 5% Pluronic F-127 solution per well to the 6-well plate.\nPlace the EB-Disk360 in the well using a sterile tweezer. While placing, tilt the EB-Disk360 a little to avoid bubbles underneath the disk.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 1 min.\nSeal the 6-well plate with parafilm and keep at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nAspirate 5% Pluronic F-127 solution.\nRinse the EB-Disk360 with 3 mL PBS --.\nRinse the EB-Disk360 with 3 mL N2B27.\nAspirate and add 3 mL complete medium per well.\nNote: The coating solution 5% Pluronic F-127 for step 35 can be stored for at least 8 months at 4°C. The EB-Disk360 will not stay at the bottom of the well but will be floating in the medium.\nFor step 34, a balance plate is needed.\nHarvest MiCOs from AggreWell™400 and transfer to EB-Disk360\nTiming: 45–60 min/well\nPlace an inverted 40 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube.\nUse a 2 mL serological pipette to carefully dislodge the MiCOs from the AggreWell™400 and transfer to the inverted 40 μm cell strainer (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nUse room temperature (20°C–25°C) PBS++ to rinse the AggreWell™400 to get all of the MiCOs onto the cell strainer.\nCarefully rinse the cell strainer with the MiCOs with PBS++.\nInvert the cell strainer to its correct position and place it in a clean dish (Ø = 35 mm).\nElute the MiCOs from the cell strainer with 2 mL complete medium in the dish.\nNote: Within 1–2 hours, the MiCOs will start sticking together. Therefore, it is preferred only to harvest from one well of AggreWell™400 at a time (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nMove the MiCOs with p200 to pre-coated EB-Disk360.",
    "Under microscope carefully distribute the MiCOs in the wells of the EB-Disk360.\nNote: The EB-Disk360 contains 360 microwells with the size 900 μm. Therefore, one EB-Disk360 can hold 360 MiCOs.\nLeave on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm in the incubator.\nChange half medium every 3–4 day (or more often if medium color changes to yellow) by slowly remove 2 mL old media and add 2–3 mL fresh media.\nCollecting MiCOs for analysis\nTiming: 10 min\nPlace the EB-Disk360 under Stereomicroscope in the flow bench, use a P1000 pipette to take out MiCOs from the microwell. This can be done at different timepoint and for different assays.\nNote: We have performed analysis such as immunostaining, HPLC, RNA and protein extraction on the MiCOs.\nFixation and embedding MiCOs in O.C.T. Compound\nTiming: 2 days\nMiCOs are collected in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube or a center well plate, wash with PBS- -.\nRemove PBS- -, add 500 μL 4% PFA and leave for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRemove 4% PFA and wash 3 times with PBS--, 10 min each time.\nRemove PBS--, add 20% sucrose without disturbing the MiCOs, leave overnight (16–20 h) at 4°C.\nWhen the MiCOs sink to the bottom of the Eppendorf tube (or the center well plate), pour them to a center well plate.\nUse tweezers and transfer the MiCOs to a plastic container with O.C.T. Compound.\nUse the tweeze to move the MiCOs to the bottom and center part of the embedding container, be careful not crush the MiCOs.\nTransfer the embedded MiCO block to a 96% EtOH dry ice bath until the block change color from transparent to a white color.\nLabel the samples and store them at −80°C until sectioning with Cryostat NX70.",
    "Use a Cryostat NX70 to section the MiCOs with a thickness of 10 μm. Collect 3–4 sections on a glass slide. Store the slides at −80°C until immunostaining is to be performed.\nNote: PFA is hazardous. Wear gloves and use in a fume hood.\nWhen samples are taken out from −80°C for sectioning, it is recommended to wait for 20–30 min until the samples reach a temperature of −20°C.\nImmunostaining of midbrain MiCO sections\nTiming: 2 days\nThe slides are permeabilized with PBT (0.25% Triton X in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove PBT. Incubate with blocking solution (5% donkey serum in PBT) for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove blocking solution. Use a PAP pen to draw a circle around the MiCO sections, apply the primary antibodies in blocking solution and incubate at 4°C overnight (16–20 h).\nRemove primary antibodies and wash 3 × 10 min with PBT.\nBlock for 10 min with blocking solution.\nRemove blocking solution. Incubate with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in a humid chamber in a dark environment.\nRemove secondary antibodies. Wash 3 × 10 min with PBT.\nRemove PBT. Incubate with 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI) diluted in PBS for 5 min.\nRemove DAPI. Wash 3 × 5 min with PBS.\nRemove PBS. Mount the slides with coverslips using DABCO.\nLeave the slides to dry under a fume hood in dark. Store the stained slides at 4°C protected from light.\nUse a microscope (Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope) to take images."
