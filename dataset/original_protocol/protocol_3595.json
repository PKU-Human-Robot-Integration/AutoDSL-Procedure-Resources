    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe generation of an in vitro 3D fibrosis model consists of three main stages: (1) primary induction of fibrosis in flask; (2) fabrication of collagen hydrogels; and (3) loading of the hydrogel with cells and fibrosis induction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Stages 2 and 3 are summarized in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/520-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Fibroblasts and fibrosis\n(1) The origin and function of myofibroblasts in the skin fibrotic microenvironment (Luzina and Atamas, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Rinkevich et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Bochaton-Piallat et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). (2) In vitro modelling of skin fibrosis using fibroblast/collagen constructs. Abbreviations: TGF-β1, Transforming Growth Factor-Beta 1; α-SMA, alpha smooth muscle actin.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/520-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. General procedures for the fabrication of collagen hydrogel and cell-loaded hydrogels constructs\nInduction of fibrosis in flasks\nTiming: 2 days\nIn T-175 flasks, culture the HDFs cells in FBS-containing medium at 37°C in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere.\nAfter reaching 90% confluency, replace the medium with serum-free medium containing TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL), and culture for 48 h.\nCritical: Prepare a fresh solution of TGF-β1-containing medium by diluting 100 μL of the working solution in serum-free medium to a final volume of 5 mL (Final Concentration: 10 ng/mL). Add this medium directly to the cultured cells.\nFabrication of collagen hydrogels\nTiming: 3–4 h\nNote: A general summary for procedures to fabricate hydrogel and the cell-loaded hydrogel is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nIn each well of (a) 96-multiwell plate and for preparing 50 μL hydrogel/well, mix the components of collagen hydrogel as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_520_10.csv\nNote: These volumes are for preparing only one 50 μL hydrogel as a guide. Collagen is a viscous solution, so the mixing should be slow.",
    "Critical: The procedures for preparing the collagen hydrogel are based on the concentration of 3 mg/mL. However, in the case of the collagen 6 mg/mL, a concentration of 3 mg/mL can be prepared by diluting in 0.01 M HCl solution designed in 1× PBS. Do not sterile-filter the collagen solution.\nNote: For many samples, a mixture of 10× and 1× PBS and NaOH for a larger volume can be prepared: Example: for 46 samples, a total volume of 768.2 μL is required, so assuming preparation of 50 samples, mix 500 μL 10× PBS + 315 μL 1× PBS + 20 μL NaOH), then take 16.67 μL for each hydrogel.\nIncubate the solutions at 37°C for 2 h for gelation.\nAfter checking the formation of hydrogels, sterilize them under Ultraviolet light for 20 min.\nFabrication of cell/hydrogel construct as fibrosis model\nTiming: 5–6 days\nAfter 48 h of cell culturing in T-175 flasks, discard the medium and wash with 20 mL of DPBS to remove any medium.\nAdd 6 mL of pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the cells and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nAdd 13 mL of pre-warmed complete culture medium to neutralize the trypsin. Pipette gently 3–5 times and transfer the whole mixture to 50 mL falcon tube.\nSpin down the cells at 125 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and carefully resuspend the pellet into 1 mL of fresh complete culture medium. Count the cells using a hemocytometer and Trypan blue.\nFor one hydrogel, suspend 20 × 103 cells in 50 μL, seed on the surface of the sterile hydrogel, and incubate for 2 h at 37°C in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere.",
    "Critical: 50 μL of cell-containing medium is required for faster seeding of cells within the hydrogel matrix, without affecting the hydrogel matrix. In the case of many wells, suspend the total amount of cells in the minimum quantity of medium that suits all wells.\nComplete the total amount of medium in each well to 150 μL, and culture the cells for 48 h.\nDiscard the medium from each well and wash each hydrogel with 300 μL DPBS.\nDiscard the DPBS and replace with FBS-free medium containing TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL), and culture for 72 h.\nNote: Check the cell migration through the hydrogel daily by taking pictures using an inverted microscope from the first day of seeding to the end of the experiment.\nNote: In case of testing the possible anti-fibrotic effects of any compound/drug, it can be added with the TGF-β1, and its effects can be monitored over the 3 days of culture.\nCritical: Due to the transparency of the hydrogel, the procedures of washing and discarding of media and DPBS should be done with precaution and ensure not to lose the hydrogels and cells.\nProtein extraction for SDS-PAGE and western blotting\nTiming: 4–5 h\nFor protein extraction for the final SDS-PAGE and western blotting, the hydrogel loaded with cells is washed, degraded for cell isolation, and finally the proteins are extracted. Below are the final detailed optimized procedures for the extraction with optimum protein quantity from cells seeded in a 50 μL hydrogel in (a) 96-multiwell plate. Moreover, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] summarizes these procedures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/520-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. General procedures for the degradation of collagen hydrogel, cell isolation, and protein extraction\nDiscard the medium from the top of hydrogels.\nAdd almost 150 μL of DPBS to each well, incubate for 30 s, and discard it. Repeat this one time.",
    "Critical: Take care not to discard the transparent hydrogel while washing.\nHydrogel degradation\nAdd 100 μL of collagenase to each hydrogel.\nIncubate at 37°C for 45 min in an incubator.\nAdd 100 μL of FBS-containing medium and mix well by pipetting to inhibit the action of the enzyme.\nAspirate the solution into tapered 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: In the case of cells still attached to the well bottom, add 30 μL trypsin to each one, incubate for 5 min, neutralize by 60 μL medium, aspirate, and mix with the solution from step 25.\nCentrifuge the solution at 200 × g at 4°C for 5 min, discard the supernatant.\nProtein extractionIn the next step, all samples are incubated in ice for 10 min before performing all the procedures in ice. Each sample can be treated separately, so the extracted volume from each one can be sufficient only for one cycle of freezing and thawing. In the case of combining some samples from the same group, aliquots should be prepared at the final step.\nWash the cell pellets with 500 μL cold PBS (×2).\nDiscard the PBS and add 30 μL of lysis buffer to each pellet, vortex for 10 s and leave for 20 min in ice.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatants into pre-cooled Eppendorf tubes for storage at −80°C.\nNote: In case of mixing many samples together, prepare aliquots of 20 μL from each group for the further assays.\nNote: There are many techniques for quantification of the extracted proteins. Here, proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit using the standard procedures.",
    "Note: Fibrosis induction is confirmed through the Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting for assessing the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) at the concentration of 1 μg/mL as a marker for the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (Vozenin et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Arora et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). There are many protocols available in literature for SDS-PAGE and western blotting, and here the final results of measuring the levels of α-SMA and β-actin as the house-keeping protein are shown."
