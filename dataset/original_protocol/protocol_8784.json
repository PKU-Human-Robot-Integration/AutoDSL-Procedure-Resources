    "1. Preparation of Fly Food with Food Coloring\nTake a standard Drosophila vial with approximately 20 ml of food in the bottom (Figure 1). Use the following recipe for food mix using 1 L of boiling water: 10 g of agar, 85 g of dextrose, 60 g of maize flour, 40 g of yeast, and stir for 5 min of simmering. Add 25 ml of 10% nipagen once the mixture has cooled to 75 °C.\nAfter the food has cooled and solidified add two drops (approximately 0.5 - 1 ml) of blue food coloring to the top of the food and spread over the whole surface of the vial (Figure 1). Use a different color dye if preferred.\nLeave the food for two days in the fridge so that the dye is absorbed by the top layer of food; this avoids excessive moisture damaging the flies during the maturation period. Add a small piece of tissue paper if excessive moisture is still a problem to blot up extra moisture and then subsequently remove it.\nTransfer flies onto the food either individually or in groups.\n\tNote: Flies will gain intestinal staining within 1 day of being placed on the food. Alternatively, fully mature the flies on the dyed food prior to the experiment (increased mortality during the maturation period was not observed from exposure to food dye).\nCheck that the dyed flies can be easily distinguished from the non-dyed flies. If they cannot be distinguished, repeat steps 1.1 - 1.4 using either a higher concentration of dye, or a different dye.\n2. Two Male Mating Trials Using Food Coloring",
    "For producing progeny, set up multiple vials containing pairs of female and male flies (small groups of males and females are also suitable, although take care to avoid crowding of larvae). Allow the females to lay eggs and move the flies to new vials every 5 - 7 days. Store vials at a suitable temperature for the species of interest (22 °C for D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura and 25 °C for D. melanogaster).\nBefore collecting experimental flies remove all flies from the collecting vials at a set time before collecting males and females to ensure they will be virgins (D. melanogaster – 6 hr at 25 °C, D. pseudoobscura – 18 hr at 22 °C, and D. subobscura – 24 hr at 22 °C).\n\tNote: If flies are not virgin this will bias their behavior in mating trials15.\n\t\nStore and mature male individually in standard 75 x 20 mm plastic vials (containing ~ 20 ml of food). This avoids the negative impacts on male mating behavior and fitness seen in some species when males are kept in groups16.\nExpose half of the males to the desired treatment (CO2 anaesthesia in this case). Use a CO2 mat or tap to expose the flies for the required time. Store half of the males in each treatment on colored food until the mating takes place. This will make them visually distinguishable during the mating trials.\nFor transferring flies use an aspirator17. Label each vial to identify both the treatment and the color status of the male. Here, use four treatments (anaesthesia, non-colored = G-NC, anaesthesia, colored = G-C, no anaesthesia, non-colored, NG-NC, and no anaesthesia, colored, NG-C).\nTransfer newly emerged females into fresh food vials to mature as groups of 10.",
    "Allow flies to mature to the mating age (D. melanogaster – 3 days, D. pseudoobscura – 5 days, D. subobscura – 7 days18. Store flies at a suitable temperature for the species being studied (e.g., 22 °C for D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura and 25 °C for D. melanogaster).\nMove females to individual vials (containing ~ 20 ml of food) 1 day before the mating trial for acclimatization to the mating vial. Label these vials so that vials can be differentiated. Be careful to blind the experiment by using neutral labelling (i.e., 1 - 150) so it is not possible to guess the identity of the flies in any vial.\n\tNote: The person who places the flies into each vial will have to know the identity of the flies placed in each vial as they will note which treatment was stained. However, the observer who watches the mating should not know their identity. To do this at least two experimenters will be needed, one to set up and one to observe.\nBegin the mating trials between 10 - 12 A.M., or at a time that coincides with the light coming on in the light/dark cycle the flies are exposed to (“dawn” for the flies). Add two male flies to each mating vial (containing a single female fly) using an aspirator. Ensure that the two males are from different treatments (anaesthesia or control) and that one has intestinal staining to make it possible to differentiate them from each other, and note which male is stained.\nIf copulation occurs, record the status of the male that mates (either colored or non - colored). If trials last for 2 hr, assume the female will not mate.\n\tNote: 2 hr is suitable for these species, but other Drosophila may need more or less time.",
    "3. Single Male Mating Trials\nFor single male trials, repeat Protocol 2 with two changes:\n\t\nIn step 2.3 do not keep males on colored food.\nIn step 2.7, add only a single male to each vial.\nIn step 2.8, record the time the fly is added to the vial, the time the mating starts and the time the mating finished should be recorded. From these values, calculate mating success, latency, and duration.\n4. Data Analysis\nUse suitable statistics package for analysis. If the data are normal and only have two treatments, use t-tests or equivalent Generalized Linear Model (GLM). For two male experiments, use binomial tests or a binomial GLM that are available in any basic statistics package.\n\tNote: For the example data, all analyses were carried out in R version 3.0.319.\nCheck the mating latency and mating duration data for normality, by plotting frequency histograms of latency and duration for each treatment20, and using a test for normality such as Shapiro-Wilk. If it is not normal, transform it, or use non-parametric equivalent statistics20.\n\tNote: For the example data from the single male experiments log transformation met the requirements of normality and equal variances.\nIf the data can be normalized, use t-tests to examine differences between mating latency and duration in the single male mating trials when using two treatments21. If multiple treatments are used, try an Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA)20. If the data cannot be normalized, try equivalent non-parametric tests21.\nUse binomial tests to test for an effect of either food coloring or CO2 anaesthesia on the mating success of competing males20. If multiple treatments are used, as is the case with the example data, use a GLM with binomial error structure21.",
    "For the two male trials in the example data, use GLMs with binomial error structures. One GLM examined color as a response variable (colored = 0 and non-colored = 1) with species, gas status, and gas treatment fitted as explanatory variables.One GLM examined CO2 as a response variable (gassed = 0 and not-gassed = 1) with species, color status, and gas treatment fitted. In each case, produce the maximal model, and perform model simplification based upon AIC20."
