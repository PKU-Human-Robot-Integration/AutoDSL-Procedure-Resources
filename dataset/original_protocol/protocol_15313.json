    "1. Sciatic Nerve Chronic Constriction\nAseptic techniques should be used for the surgical procedure. Disinfect the surgical work surface with 70% ethanol and prepare in advance sterile instruments (e.g., fine scissors, forceps, and retractor), gauzes, staples and swabs by autoclaving. For multiple surgeries, clean and resterilise instruments with 70% ethanol or a dry bead steriliser between rats. A surgical mask, hair bonnet and sterile gloves should be worn.\nFor constriction of the nerve, prepare the chromic gut suture by cutting it into small pieces of about 3 cm length immersed in sterile saline, to prevent drying. For closing the wound, use commercially available sterile silk sutures.\nAnaesthetise the rat in an induction chamber using 5% isoflurane in O2, then deliver 2% isoflurane in O2 via a custom made facemask, and monitor the anesthetised animal during the procedure. Common alternative anaesthetics are inhaled halothane or intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital. Ketamine, as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, should be avoided since these receptors are important in the development of neuropathic pain.\nShave the left hind leg of the rat. Then, place the animal onto a thermo-regulated heating mat at 37°C and apply lubricating ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nSterilize the shaved area with three alternate applications of 70% isopropyl alcohol and iodine solution.\nWith the rat lying on its chest/thorax, elevate left hind leg and hold in position with the femor at 90° to the spine using masking tape on the foot.\nMake an incision in the skin parallel, but 3-4 mm below the femor, and free the skin from the muscle surrounding the incision by cutting through the connective tissue.\nUsing blunt scissors, cut through the connective tissue between the gluteus superficialis and the biceps femoris muscles.",
    "Use a retractor to widen the gap between the two muscles, allowing clear visualisation of the sciatic nerve.\nUsing curved blunt-tipped forceps and micro-scissors, gently free approximately 10 mm of the sciatic nerve (proximal to the sciatic trifurcation) from the surrounding connective tissue.\nUnder the microscope and a good light source, tie four ligatures (chromic gut 4.0, Ethicon, USA) with a double knot, 1 mm apart, proximal to the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve. For each ligature, start with a single loose loop, then grasp the two ends close to the loop and tighten until the loop is just barely snug and the ligature does not slide along the nerve. To hold the loop in its proper position, place a second loop on top of the first to complete the knot. Finally, cut the loose ends of the ligature to around 1mm. Constriction of the nerve should be minimal, and immediately stopped if a brief twitch is observed, to prevent arresting of the epineural blood flow. Over tightening the ligatures leads to axotomy, and autotomy (self-mutilation), both unwanted side-effects which preclude successful pain hypersensitivity testing.\nUse sutures (Mersilk 5.0, Ethicon) to close the muscle layer and staples (Autoclip, 9 mm) to fasten the skin. Next, use iodine solution (Riodine) to sterilise the wound.\nObserve the rat closely during the anaesthesia recovery period, and allow it to recover in a separate cage with flat paper bedding (not the standard animal husbandry bedding), in order to prevent the unconscious animal choking.",
    "Before giving any post-operative analgesia investigators should consider the fact this may interfere with pain hypersensitivity testing. In fact, there is evidence that local application of anaesthetic, lidocaine, at time of injury can alter the development of neuropathic pain, and diminish the degree of hyperalgesia in the preceding weeks7. For further discussion on this matter see review by Bennett et al8.\n2. Measurements of Pain Behaviours\nDaily handling of rats for several days before starting the experiment is recommended in order to accustom the rats to their handler, reduce stress and the risk of biting.\nPrior to behavioural testing, rats need to be habituated to the testing procedure and the animal enclosure. The testing environment should be kept quiet and well controlled, with constant temperature and humidity levels, and carried out at a similar time of day each testing session.\nPain hypersensitivity testing should be performed several times before CCI (baseline) and at different time points after CCI, as desired.\n3. Mechanical Withdrawal Threshold\nOn the day of testing, place rats into the elevated mesh floored testing cage 15-30 minutes before measuring withdrawal thresholds, allowing cage exploration and grooming activities to cease and rats to become relaxed and stationary.\nUsing a dynamic plantar von Frey aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Italy), position the touch-stimulator unit with the filament directly beneath the mid-plantar surface of the hindpaw, avoiding the metal mesh, and press the start key. This lifts the filament to mechanically stimulate the plantar surface of the hindpaw with an increasing force.",
    "Manual von Frey hairs are a series of increasing diameter filaments which are calibrated to induce a specific force when applied to the skin. They can be used as an alternative to an electronic dynamic plantar von Frey aesthesiometer for measurement of paw withdrawal threshold, as previously described4. There are also several alternative manufacturers of electronic von Frey aesthesiometers (e.g. IITC, USA and Somedic, Sweden).\nRecord the mechanical withdrawal threshold from both injured and uninjured hindpaws, in a counterbalanced order. This device applies pressure to the paw and upon withdrawal reaction the system automatically records and displays the maximum force applied (in grams). If an ambiguous response occurs (i.e. in the case of ambulation or grooming), repeat the stimulus and record the threshold again. Licking or shaking of the hindpaw following stimulation is a sign of behaviour associated with pain.\nRepeat the mechanical stimulation 3 times with an interval of about 5 min between stimuli, record the thresholds, and then calculate the mean of paw withdrawal thresholds.\n4. Thermal Withdrawal Latency\nThe infrared (I.R.) heat intensity of the plantar test instrument should be adjusted before starting the experiment. In our laboratory, we adjust the I.R. intensity to give an average paw withdrawal latency of about 10 seconds in naïve rats, and we set the cut-off latency at 20 seconds to avoid tissue damage in case of failure to remove a paw.\nOn the day of testing, place rats into the glass floored testing cage 15-30 minutes before measuring latency, allowing cage exploration and grooming activities to cease and rats to become relaxed and stationary.",
    "Using a thermal plantar analgesia instrument (Ugo Basile, Italy), position the infrared source directly beneath the mid-plantar surface of the hindpaw, and press the start key. This exposes the plantar surface of the hindpaw to a beam of radiant heat through a transparent glass surface. There are also alternative manufacturers of thermal plantar analgesia instruments (e.g. IITC, USA and Stoelting, USA).\nRecord the withdrawal latency from both injured and uninjured hindpaws, in a counterbalanced order. This device automatically records the time taken (in seconds) from the onset of the thermal stimulus to withdrawal of the paw from the heat source. If an ambiguous response occurs (i.e. in the case of ambulation or grooming), repeat the stimulus and record the latency again. Licking or shaking of the hindpaw following stimulation is a sign of behaviour associated with pain.\nRepeat the heat stimulation at least 3 times with an interval of about 5 min between stimuli, record the latencies, and then calculate the mean of paw withdrawal latencies.\n4. Representative Results\nAn example of mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency in the ipsilateral (injured) and contralateral (uninjured) paws of Wistar rats is shown before (baseline) and 2-12 days after CCI in Figure 3A, and Figure 3B. From these figures it can be seen that CCI causes a significant reduction in both mechanical withdrawal thresholds and thermal withdrawal latencies of the ipsilateral hindpaw, indicating the presence of mechanical and thermal pain hypersensitivity, both features of chronic neuropathic pain.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3393/3393fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1.  A schematic illustrating the positioning of the ligatures in the CCI model. This animal model of neuropathic pain involves placement of four loose chromic-gut ligatures on the sciatic nerve, at mid-thigh level. It results in injuring only a portion of the afferents going to the foot and subsequent pain hypersensitivity of the hindpaw.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3393/3393fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.  Diagram of the hindpaw area used for pain testing. The mid-plantar surface just posterior to the footpads, as indicated by the red dotted circle, is used for pain testing. This area is innervated mostly by terminal branches of the sciatic nerve. The heel and footpads should be avoided due to differential skin sensitivity.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3393/3393fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.  Pain hypersensitivity following chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve in rats. After CCI, there is a significant reduction in paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli (A) and paw withdrawal latency to thermal stimuli (B) in the injured (ipsilateral) hindpaw compared to the uninjured (contralateral) hindpaw (P<0.01 repeated measures 2-way ANOVA).
