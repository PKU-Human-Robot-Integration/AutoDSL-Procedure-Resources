    "1. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Protease Vector\nDesign and order custom-synthesized oligonucleotides to install a mutation of interest using a modification of standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols12. Standard desalted primers (without additional purification) are perfectly acceptable.\n\tNote: A general approach to primer designs involves creating partially overlapping primers as indicated in Table 1, using a melting temperature (Tm) calculator specific to the polymerase of interest.\nSet up polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for the site-directed mutagenesis on ice, as indicated in Table 2.\nCycle the PCRs as indicated in Table 3.\nRun 2 - 5 µL of each PCR on a 1% agarose gel and visualize the products to confirm a successful amplification.\n\tNote: A successful PCR will show a single, prominent DNA band at the approximate size marker of the template (~7.8 kB).\nAdd 0.5 µL (per 25-µL reaction) of DpnI and incubate the samples at 37 °C for 1 h.\nTransform 2 µL of the reaction into chemically competent Escherichia coli.\n\tNote: A fast-growing E. coli strain will reduce incubation times, but any cloning strain will be acceptable.\nPlate the transformations onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar containing 50 - 100 µg/mL carbenicillin. Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.\nSelect 2 - 4 colonies to grow in a small-scale culture (2 - 5 mL of LB medium with 50 - 100 µg/mL carbenicillin). Incubate the culture at 37 °C at 220 rpm until it is turbid.\nIsolate the plasmid DNA from the cells using a plasmid DNA purification (i.e., “miniprep”) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantify the concentration of eluted DNA using a microvolume spectrophotometer.",
    "Sequence the plasmid DNA extensively using a Sanger sequencing service (such as a core or commercial facility). Prepare the DNA samples according to the service’s specifications. Primers used successfully in prior sequencing reactions are noted in Table 4.\n\tNote: Due to the PCR amplification of the entire plasmid, the sequencing of the entire PCSK9 coding region is recommended for each mutant.\n2. High-throughput Luciferase-based Proteolysis Assay\nCell plating (day 0) \nUse low-passage HEK293T cells for experiments and a culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Perform all cell work under sterile conditions in a tissue culture hood until ready to assay the luciferase activity. Estimate the number of wells and plates needed for the experiment, anticipating that transfections will be performed in triplicate for each condition tested.\nDissociate HEK293T cells from a parent flask by treating them with a minimal volume of 0.05% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to cover the cells. Inactivate the trypsin-EDTA with 2 volumes of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and transfer the cells to a sterile tube. Count the cells using an automated cell counter (and staining with trypan blue). Centrifuge the tube at 500 x g for 5 min to recover cells.\nAspirate trypsin-containing medium and reconstitute the cells in the culture medium to a concentration of 2 x 105 cells/mL. Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 100 µL of the cells to each well of a white (opaque-bottom) 96-well plate, which gives a final seeding concentration of 2 x 104 cells/well.\n\t\tNote: For initial experiments, it may be useful to additionally seed a sister, clear-bottom 96-well plate, so as to monitor cell growth and adherence during the protocol and guide future troubleshooting.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "Prepare a master plate of plasmids in a 96-well format. Dilute each plasmid in elution buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) to 50 ng/µL in an individual well of a 96-well plate.\n\t\t\nPrepare 4 wells each for the positive control (WT) plasmid8, negative control (S386A) plasmid8, and plasmid-free buffer (for mock transfections). If drug or other cellular-based treatments are being planned, then prepare the master plate with the positive control (WT) plasmid in each well, along with 4 wells each of the negative control (S386A) plasmid and the plasmid-free buffer.\nTransfection (day 1)\nPrepare the transfection mixture in a 96-well plate format using deep-well 96-well plates. Perform the transfections in triplicate, being sure to prepare enough reagents to account for pipetting and transfer losses.\n\t\tNote: The following calculations prepare enough reagent to run one 96-well plate in triplicate (estimated conservatively for 420 wells).\n\t\t\nMake a master mix of a diluted lipid transfection reagent, adding 50.4 µL of reagent to 2050 µL of reduced-serum medium. Make a master mix of a DNA precomplexation reagent, adding 33.6 µL of reagent into 1730 µL of reduced-serum medium.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, aliquot 16.8 µL of the diluted DNA precomplexation reagent mixture into each well of the deep-well plate.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, aliquot 3.2 µL (160 ng) of each plasmid from the master plate into each well of the deep-well plate.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, aliquot 20 µL of the diluted lipid transfection reagent mixture to each well of the plate and mix the contents of each well using the multichannel pipette. Cover the plates and let them sit at room temperature (RT) for 10 - 15 min to form lipid:DNA complexes.",
    "Note: Upon transfection, the final components per well will be as follows: 40 ng of DNA, 0.12 µL of transfection reagent, and 0.08 µL of DNA pre-complexation reagent, and the content of each well will be 10 µL in total volume (reduced-serum medium).\nGently exchange the medium on the 293T cells in the 96-well plates using a multichannel pipette, taking care not to disrupt the cells. Replace the aspirated medium with 95 µL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\n\t\tNote: This would be an appropriate time to treat the cells with any drug of interest.\nAdd 10 µL of the transfection mixture to each appropriate well via a multichannel pipette. Gently swirl the plate to mix the contents in the wells. Incubate the plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n\t\tNote: The final volume of the wells comes to 105 µL, to account for evaporation over 24 h.\nAssay (day 2)\nPrepare a stock solution for coelenterazine reagents: 3 M sodium ascorbate [dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), prepared fresh], 5 M NaCl, 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA; dissolved in PBS, prepared fresh), and 2 mM coelenterazine (dissolved in acidified methanol containing 200 µL of 3 N HCl per 10 mL).\n\t\tNote: The 2 mM coelenterazine can be stored for 2 weeks when it is kept at -80 °C and in the absence of light.\nPrepare 2x coelenterazine reagents for the luciferase readout, with a separate reagent each for the cells and medium, according to Table 5. Mix all reagents save the coelenterazine first, filter the mixture through a 0.22-µm syringe filter, and then add the coelenterazine. Protect the reagents from light until they are ready to be added to the plates.",
    "Note: Due to the loss of solution from filtration, make enough reagent to account for both the loss from filtration, as well as from transfers. Table 5 shows the final concentration of the 2x reagents (as well as the amount of stock solution to add to read out one 96-well plate with one reagent).\nRemove the cells from the incubator 24 h after the transfection. Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 50 µL of conditioned medium from each well to a fresh, white-bottomed (opaque) 96-well plate.\n\t\t\nLabel the plates as to whether they contain medium or cells. If more than one 96-well plate was transfected, label the plates so as to ensure that each medium-containing plate is paired with its parent plate of cells.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 50 µL of 2x non-lytic coelenterazine reagent to the plate containing only conditioned medium. Gently rock or shake the plate in the absence of light for 5 - 10 min at RT.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 50 µL of 2x lytic coelenterazine reagent to the plate containing the cells. Gently rock or shake the plate in the absence of light for 5 - 10 min at RT.\nAfter the incubation, read out the luminescence of the medium-only plate in a plate reader. Then, read out the luminescence of the cell-containing plate in the same plate reader.\nDiscard the plates and save the files for data analysis.\n3. Data Analysis\nPerform an initial data analysis using spreadsheet software. Create a spreadsheet containing the results from the cell and the medium plates.",
    "Manually inspect the data from the cell plates to identify poorly transfected wells. Wells that show < 5% - 10% of the readout of the negative control (S386A) plasmid should be considered as poorly transfected, making the interpretation of those data suspect.\nCalculate the average background luminescence of each plate from the mock-transfected wells. Subtract the background of each plate from the values of that plate.\n\tNote: This value may be negligible depending on the plate reader used.\nProcess the data by calculating the proportion of luciferase activity in the medium compared to the overall luciferase activity for each well. Because the cell plate contains both conditioned medium in addition to cells, and the medium-only plate contains the same amount of conditioned medium as the cell plate, it is appropriate to use the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58265/58265eq1.jpg\n\tHere, RLU = relative luminescence units, the background-subtracted readout from the plate reader.\nCalculate the mean secreted luciferase of the positive control (WT) and the negative control (S386A) wells.\nEvaluate the overall quality of the experiment by calculating a Z-factor13:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58265/58265eq2.jpg\n\tNote: The active values come from the positive control (WT) and the inactive values come from the negative control (S386A) wells. Values closer to 1 indicate a higher experimental quality. Consider repeating the experiment or optimizing the workflow if the value is below 0.\nTransfer the data from the spreadsheet program into scientific data analysis software.\nNormalize the secreted luciferase activity to the mean values of the positive control (WT) and the negative control (S386A), setting the positive control as 1 and the negative control as 0.\nClean the data for outliers using the regression and outlier removal (ROUT) method, setting the maximum false discovery rate to 1%.",
    "Evaluate for statistically significant differences by comparing the data for each mutant condition (or mutant) to the mean of the WT activity (normalized to a value of 1). Perform multiple unpaired t-tests, correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method and α = 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
